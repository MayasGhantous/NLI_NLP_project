  i got, 
  * `` called queenland '', 
  * `` called the sunshine state '', 
  * `` so backward '', 
  * `` so hot '', 
  but my nsw results were completely different :, 
  * called that, 
  * so called, 
  * called the first state, 
  * known as the first state, 
  for victoria i ( being outside of australia at the moment , so the results would have been altered by that ) did n't get a single result about victoria the australian state . 
  i got victoria 's secret , two results about someone called victoria justice who i 've never heard of before , and one about victoria falls . 
  people realise it , and are just interested in sharing the results that they got . 
  it 's not just your search history , though . 
  it 's everything google has about you . 
  search history ( including the terms that you searched for * and * the results that you actually clicked on ) and location are the chief among these . 
  i succeeded in getting out going to only 4 pages in total one time . 
  one time . 
  one thing that i 've noticed recently is that in technology , at least , there does seem to be a big move towards marketing things as made in the usa . 
  the new mac pros are assembled in the us , as is the motorola x phone , for example . 
  what actual subject would these be in ? 
  anyway , i 'd suggest flipping a coin . 
  if you flip a coin and realise you 're disappointed with the result , or you 're secretly hoping it lands on one particular side , then that 's the one you should go with . 
  edit :, 
  but anyway , i think there 's a lot you could say about gender roles . 
  the biggest problem with it is that your ee should ideally be covering new ground , and should n't be something that has been done many times before . 
  you 'd have to try and find a unique angle . 
  if you can do that , there 's certainly a lot to go on . 
  the relative lack of female playable characters . 
  the characterisation of those characters when they do come up ( e.g. 
  chell , faith ) . 
  the phenomenon of players choosing their own gender such as in skyrim of mass effect -- how the gameplay is different with each gender , or why a player might choose one over the other . 
  player interactions with npcs of different genders . 
  those are just a few of the ideas that could be mentioned and expanded upon , depending on the angle you want to take . 
  the recommendation in australia is called the `` pressure-immobilisation '' technique . 
  you can [ see here ] ( http://www.anaesthesia.med.usyd.edu.au/resources/venom/snakebite.html ) for a more detailed explanation , but perhaps the most important bit right now is :, 
   do not cut or excise the area or apply an arterial torniquet !, 
  both these measures are ineffective and may make the situation worse . 
  no , you are wrong . 
  you can access the file structure if you jailbreak , but the file structure is completely hidden to a normal user . 
  hey , at least you have * something * . 
  netflix does n't exist at all in australia . 
   if you do n't have a metronome , get one, 
  if you ca n't be bothered to get one , get an app !, 
  there are tonnes of great metronome apps for both ios and android . 
  it 's not as handy as having a real one , but it does the job . 
  i disagree . 
  the last time i saw this on here i was n't really sure , [ so i asked ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1u4y9i/something_positive_abbott_to_recognise_indigenous/ceek9pt ) . 
  no one came up with any answer that really convinced me it 's a good idea . 
  [ this comment ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1u4y9i/something_positive_abbott_to_recognise_indigenous/ceelhhk ) did a good job of more accurately explaining what the proposed changes to the constitution would entail . 
  some of the changes there , i agree with -- in fact , i would say they are essential . 
  others pay completely unnecessary lip service . 
  [ this thread ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1hzq3n/kevin_rudd_breathes_new_life_into_proposal_to/ ) is another good one . 
  again , i agree with the top commenter ( / u/ydna _ eissua ) . 
  but / u/crazyscientist brings up some of the most important points in that thread , and they 're completely unrelated to the issue of aboriginal recognition . 
  i actually agree with you , but it 's worth noting that there are other events where there 's a difference . 
  most notably , the 110 m hurdles for men , and the 100 m hurdles for women . 
  at a non-professional level , it 's very common to see women run 300 m rather than 400 m in high school level sprints . 
  on a similar note , many of the most significant advances made in the early history of the field of psychology were made in conditions that today would never be allowed . 
  they 're unethical . 
  hey there buddy . 
  i was only 11 in '05 , 
  you might also enjoy hearing that people born in 1995 are now all old enough that in most countries they can now legally drink , smoke , and be in porn . 
  there 're like 4 games that did n't work on ps2 . 
  so yeah , technically it 's only partly backward compatible , but for so intents and purposes most people will find it completely compatible . 
  windows is . 
  a person on windows 8 will have little trouble running any game it application designed as far back as the earliest 32 bit windows os . 
  that means some applications as far back as windows 95 will work without difficulty . 
  the other response i 've seen is basically that it adds unnecessary complication that might confuse less sophisticated users . 
  it 's a load of crap if you ask me . 
  having a simple radio button with `` automatic settings '' as the default choice , and `` advanced install '' as the other would completely negate that problem . 
  yay !, 
  ^ ^ ^ / s feature creep !, 
  samsung puts heaps of their own bloat on their phones . 
  personally i think [ this ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/images/axeswithnames.gif ) is a better scale to use . 
  or [ this ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/images/internationalchart.png ) which is the same chart with slightly different labels . 
  the problem with the one you put is that it does n't quite accurately represent the difference between economic policies and social policies as being totally independent ideas . 
  instead , it conflates economic liberty and personal liberty , and suggests that the ultimate aim should be in line with what libertarians believe . 
  you can see [ here ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/ ) for more information about it , as well as take a test to see where you lie on the chart . 
  macbook pro 13 ' , the generation right before thunderbolt came in . 
  macbook pro 15 ' , non-retina , the last one before they removed that from being an option ( and i 'm so glad i got it , too -- the lack of ethernet port as well as the extreme price of the 15 ' retina one mean that the fact that they removed the 15 ' non-retina was really disappointing to me ) . 
  the simple answer is that we can look at countries with a higher minimum wage and compare , or look at previous times countries have raised their minimum wage . 
  the simple fact is that time and time again , we see that raising the minimum wage ( to a reasonable level ) does not have a significant negative effect on the economy . 
  yeah so was i. 
  it seems absurd to me that their drinking age is 21 . 
  but anyway , that was n't the only reason they were arrested . 
  [ apparently ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1w8bwh/what_is_something_you_opted_out_of_that_went/cezs96e?context=2 ) there was also a report of a stolen car involved . 
  legal right , yes , of course they do . 
  but that does n't mean it is n't a complete dick move . 
  then do n't make them jump of something 4 and a half metres tall . 
  people in queensland actually want daylight saving ? 
  damn , i just do n't believe it . 
  the petition talks about `` health benefits '' . 
  what a load of bullshit . 
  daylight saving actually causes a spike in suicides and heart problems on the day after the switch . 
  besides , it 's stupid to pretend it somehow creates more daylight . 
  you put it in during the time that * already * has the longest daylight . 
  if you really wanted more daylight you 'd shift the clock forward during the * winter * , not the summer . 
  not to mention , if people cared about it that much , people would be trying to get working hours changed . 
  it 's much simpler for work places to offer different work hours than it is for an entire region to start pretending time works in a way it does n't .
