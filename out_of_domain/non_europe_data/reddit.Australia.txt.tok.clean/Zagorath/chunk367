  his style is absolutely awful for learning any new material , not to mention so incredibly damn dull . 
  but for revising something you learnt elsewhere he can be great . 
  relevant username . 
  anyone know why it 's off this week ? 
  most of the time when shows take a week off it 's because of some american holiday or other , but as far as i 'm aware there is n't anything this week , apart from lunar new year . 
   in day to day life you hardly ever need to go below milli and above kilo, 
  what , you never talk about megabytes , gigabytes , or terabytes ? 
  america and the united kingdom are rated among the lowest socio-economic mobility in the developed/western ( not sure which ) world . 
  sounds to me like a reference to rome sweet rome . 
  would create a million pieces of junk , almost certainly . 
  you really do need infinite monkeys for this to work . 
  how many clarinetists does it take to change a lightbulb ? 
  only one , but he 'll go through a whole box of bulbs before he finds just the right one . 
  surely it would help if you specified what your degree is in , or at least what kind of area ( s ) you are most interested in ? 
  does the gun control debate really revolve around preventing crime ? 
  i certainly do n't see it that way , and i do n't think that 's the way it should be seen . 
  my experience has been that people who are against gun control tend to try and frame it this way . 
  it should be about minimising harm . 
  `` harm '' is a concept that is n't easy to quantify , but reducing the number of total deaths is a good start . 
  if someone is more likely to successfully commit suicide because they have access to guns ( and / u/cacheflow 's source suggests that they are ) , then more access to guns increases overall harm in that respect . 
  i should probably give a little context . 
  i come from australia -- a country that a little while ago very successfully implemented a gun buyback scheme and stricter gun control laws . 
  i personally do n't see the `` personal rights '' issue as particularly important in this situation . 
  my ideal balance would be :, 
  * no automatic or semi-automatic weapons *, 
  * no handguns or other easily concealable weapons *, 
  * to own a gun , one must go through an extensive background and mental health check, 
  * guns must be stored securely, 
  you still have the right to own a gun , and if you do n't have a criminal history it is relatively easy for you to obtain one and use it for your own recreational purposes . 
  but all of this is somewhat off topic . 
  my point with all that is to say that the personal rights thing is a fairly moot point . 
  i do n't see the solution australia came up with as being an attack on personal rights in any * real * way , only for those who insist on making an issue where none really exists . 
  it poses no real threat to ( legal ) hunters or target shooters , while also getting the maximum in terms of reduced harm . 
  \\* with certain exceptions , for example farmers protecting livestock , or target shooters, 
  it really depends . 
  if there were already some toads with the necessary adaptation it would certainly become ubiquitous very quickly , but i ca n't imagine the adaptation first coming about just by chance in the time between it starting and now . 
  that was exactly my thought . 
  they wo n't be getting my patronage for the simple reason that it comes across preachy and snobbish . 
  claiming that `` true '' australia is one that is without talk of politics . 
  calling its subscribers `` true '' blue aussies . 
  not to mention the fact that when someone * does * post something about politics , the mods fucking ** ban ** them . 
  it 's far too heavy handed . 
  it 's definitely not the sort of sub i want to be visiting . 
  if they called themselves something like / r/ausnopol , and deleted political posts while giving the posters a warning -- before banning repeat ( say , 3 -- 5 times ) offenders , then it might be the sort of place worth visiting . 
  it 's anti-intellectual because it has no politics , and you are claiming that this is the `` true '' australia . 
  the way australia ( or , at least , an australia subreddit ) * should * be . 
  i 'm not involved in legislature , so that 's not something i want to get into the details of . 
  i will say that the reason i left hunters off the list of exceptions for semi-autos is because -- to my knowledge -- they do n't usually use semi-autos . 
  i put target shooters in only because the wikipedia page on australian gun politics mentioned that such an exception already exists ; i was surprised that target shooters would ever need semi-autos . 
  the finer points i would leave up to the politicians , but anyone who has a legitimate reason for needing a gun ( and `` self defence '' is ** not ** one of them ) is able to get a gun under the system i proposed -- and under the system australia implemented in the late '90s . 
  because of that , it is n't functionally limiting the rights of citizens . 
  edit : fixed punctuation, 
  edit2 : to address you first question , the barrier to entry becomes prohibitive at the point at which someone with a legitimate need for a certain firearm can not get that type of weapon . 
  this does not happen in australia today . 
   its in the constitution ( which is infallible and we ca n't even discuss changing it ), 
  when americans use this argument i have to try really hard to to go all rage on them . 
  i mean , it 's [ not like they 've never overturned an amendment before , when it was decided that the amendment was no longer relevant/necessary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twenty-first_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution ) . 
  the fact that something is * currently * a law/in the constitution/whatever is * not * an argument for why it should * stay * that way . 
   it 's a sport, 
  and the thing is , most people in favour of regulating guns would not hinder those you do sport shooting . 
  they 'd merely need to show that they are sporting shooters , and have a background and mental health check done , and then they could be on their merry way . 
  this wo n't be getting my patronage for the simple reason that it comes across preachy and snobbish . 
  claiming that `` true '' australia is one that is without talk of politics . 
  calling its subscribers `` true '' blue aussies . 
  not to mention the fact that when someone does post something about politics , the mods fucking ban them . 
  it 's far too heavy handed . 
  it 's definitely not the sort of sub i want to be visiting . 
  if you called yourself something like / r/ausnopol , and deleted political posts while giving the posters a warning -- before banning repeat ( say , 3 -- 5 times ) offenders , then it might be the sort of place worth visiting . 
  a sore point ? 
  not really . 
  it 's what 's known as a micronation . 
  by definition , micronations are places that call themselves a country , but which no major country recognises as such . 
  nobody except for a handful of people in other micronations actually believes this place is anything other than a bit of land inside of western australia . 
  if they do n't pay australian taxes etc. , i 'm sure nobody really cares too much . 
  doubt the amount that they should be paying is significant enough to be worth worrying about . 
  my issue is n't with the concept of the sub , it 's with the name and the superior attitude . 
  if it was called something like / r/ausnopol i probably would subscribe . 
  except that they are n't using it in the way other subreddits use it . 
  true atheism is about taking about atheism ( supposedly ) without the constant low quality posts and so-called circle-jerk . 
  about getting to the root of the original meaning of the post . 
  this subreddit is n't like that . 
  it 's not about increasing quality of content or getting back to the roots of / r/australia . 
  it 's just about removing politics . 
  if they wanted it to really be a `` true '' subreddit they would allow politics but strictly moderate to remove low quality posts -- whether they be political or not . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/perth/comments/1wlctf/rtrueaustralia_is_now_live_xpost_from_raustralia/cf3fez9 ) . 
  but seriously , i understand how the `` true '' thing works in other subreddits , but you simply are not using it in the same way . 
  but anyway , your subreddit is n't just about having `` stricter rules '' , it 's about banning one particular type of content completely . 
  if you wanted to call it `` true australia '' , then you should be allowing politics , but being very strict about moderating and only allowing serious comments , and deleting ( but for god 's sake , not banning on sight like you do now ) the low-quality posts -- whether they be about politics or not . 
  you could do that without banning any talk of politics whatsoever if that is what you actually cared about . 
  for what it 's worth , that was the problem in the very first civ game only . 
  after that , he was deliberately coded to have a high tendancy to use nukes . 
  the hover thing is cool as fuck just from the perspective of `` holy shit you can do that '' , but personally i find it more distracting than anything else . 
  i prefer the text just appearing . 
  side note -- how did you do the hover thing ? 
  i do n't want to keep going in circles here , but a tl ; dr of my arguments :, 
  two possible scenarios for the new sub make sense :, 
  it has the name / r/trueaustralia , in which case it allows submissions on any topic , but is heavily moderated to avoid low-quality submissions/comments, 
  it bans politics , but should be named something else , for example / r/ausnopol, 
  the current situation is arrogant and preachy ; implying that removing all politics is the `` true '' australia . 
  ca n't answer what question ?
