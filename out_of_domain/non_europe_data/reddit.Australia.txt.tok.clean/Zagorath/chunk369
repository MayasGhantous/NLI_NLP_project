  anyway , you should grab the first 3 spyro games for ps2 , or at least ** spyro 2 : gateway to glimmer ** -- that was always my favourite spyro game . 
  ** spyro the dragon ** ( game 1 ) and ** spyro 3 : year of the dragon ** . 
  the series went downhill after that ( including the one you 've got for xbox ) . 
  if you 've already got god of war 1 , grab ** god of war 2 ** , too .

  he 's talking about [ responsive design ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/responsive_web_design ) . 
  designing your page specifically so that it will automatically work well on any size screen , without making a dedicated `` mobile '' version . 
  he just did n't explain it very well . 
  the best method would be responsive design . 
  design your webpage to look good and be easy to use on any size of screen without having a special `` mobile '' version . 
  the difference is you do n't have a dedicated `` mobile '' version of your site , the way wikipedia has m.wikipedia.org , instead you have one version that works on phones , tablets , and desktop pcs . 
  to be honest i 'd say it really depends on the website in question , whether a dedicated mobile version is better or a responsive design . 
  i 'm not really advocating for either , just trying to provide a more sane explanation of what / u/3dgrunge is shouting about . 
  look , i do n't particularly like tattoos , and i would never get one myself . 
  but i do respect other people 's right to get a tattoo if they want to , and in general i would n't say someone is dumb for getting a tattoo of their favourite sport team . 
  heck , i 'd say that 's a pretty damn good idea as far as tattoos go . 
  but this here ? 
  this is dumb . 
  it 's not just a tattoo of their favourite sport team . 
  it 's a tattoo saying that their sport team won one particular major event -- that ( assuming the title is correct ) they got * before the event even happened * . 
  seriously . 
  i hate people like this . 
  technology is * all about * change . 
  if you do n't like changes that can make you more productive , then you should n't call yourself a tech enthusiast . 
  it 's like when people complained about the ribbon . 
  nobody 's complaining now because people have gotten used to it and ( for the most part ) realised how useful it is . 
  you clearly do n't understand the word objectively . 
  it absolutely is not objectively worse . 
  in fact , in any objectively measurable metric , it surpasses win7 . 
  things like boot time see significant performance increases , for example . 
  but here 's the thing , does your dad consider himself good with tub technology ? 
  if not , it 's really annoying to have to explain relatively simple things to him , but i can live with that ( my parents are exactly the same ) . 
  but it 's when people who are supposedly tech enthusiasts that do this that i get really mad . 
  actually os x has been updating even more frequently then that -- yearly . 
  but apple users are generally far more likely to upgrade their os , and so fragmentation is a very minor issue . 
  mmm well said sir . 
  personally if i was on 7 i would n't see the need to upgrade to 8 , but if i was on vista or xp i think it 'd be dumb to not upgrade all the way to the latest version . 
  the version of windows branded 8.1 is actually nt 6.3 , so you 're wrong there . 
  you should also give up on this . 
  people are going to call windows by its branded name . 
  sure it 's a bit silly that the brand name is getting more and more out of sync with the actually version number , but you just got ta live with it . 
  til that kris is n't a woman ... 
  agree completely . 
  i love the pirate party 's policies , and i voted 1 for them in the senate last election , but i just ca n't see them being taken seriously by too many people with this name . 
  they explain this in the article :, 
   the ... liberal national party have slid one point down on surveillance , due to their more hardline stance on the issue , including prism and australia 's involvement in the program since forming government . 
   on the same issue the labor party have climbed one point , due in large part to their support for a senate inquiry into the telecommunications interception act . 
  i kinda agree with you on censorship , labor should be a step down . 
  only problem is that would put them on the same level as family first -- which * still * supports mandatory filtering . 
  so perhaps family first should drop down one , too . 
  no more obsession ? 
  you mean like that bit in season 3 -- a bit ** not ** from the season that everyone here loves to hate on -- where the dean is locked up and talks about jeff `` winning the bet '' so he has to take his shirt off ? 
  my point is , you might love to hate on season 4 because it 's not run by harmon , but rewatch seasons 3 and 4 . 
  you 'll see that apart from a few really bad outliers ( that damn puppet episode , for example ) , season 4 was nothing more than a continuation of what was going on in season 3 . 
  i admit i did n't read through it at first , and did n't even notice that there was anything `` weird '' about it ( other than the fact that the list was enormous ) . 
  i saw standard wind instruments at the top ( albeit huge numbers of them ) and the standard string section at the bottom and that was good enough for me . 
  so glad i went back and reread it after / u/unnatural _ rights ' comment . 
  i felt that the anticlimactic strings were one of the best bits . 
  after all that bizarreness and then just ... strings . 
  the fact that it was so normal was what made it funny . 
  if you think the contrabass sax is weird , [ check this out ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4ox-yefby ) . 
  and that is n't even the lowest clarinet , the octocontrabass is a fourth lower . 
  goodman was amazing . 
  one of the best jazz clarinetists of all time , and also did a healthy amount of classical repertoire . 
  it 's a precise conversion of 8 pounds 6 ounces . 
  in practice , people do n't measure their weight exactly , and instead round to the nearest unit . 
  that 's the nearest ounce for imperial or us units , and it would be to the nearest 10 or maybe even 100 grammes ( two or one decimal places after kilogrammes ) for metric users , if you 're measuring the weight of a baby . 
  conversion from us or imperial to metric is arbitrary , as are conversions * between * various units within the us or the imperial systems . 
  what 's not arbitrary is from one metric unit to another -- it 's always powers of 10 . 
  what 's with the hate on arrow ? 
  it 's a fantastic show . 
  the acting is n't incredible -- especially in the first few episodes -- and there are a few bad lines ( lately i 've been noticing some really bad lines from diggle ) , but the acting and writing both improved significantly as the actors and writers got into their groove , and in terms of story it 's one of the best shows on tv at the moment . 
  i believe spyro 2 was also published under a different name in some regions , so it might not have the exact same name if you 're looking for it . 
  just searching `` spyro 2 '' should do the job , though . 
  thankfully you can easily submit a better picture of an already existing portal yourself . 
  get a couple of friends to vote on it and it 'll become the new default picture . 
  still , if two people submitted it around the same time , you 'd think they 'd pick the one with the better picture . 
  not sure exactly what their method is in that case . 
  i had the same problem . 
  i submitted the [ pitch drop experiment ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pitch_drop_experiment#university_of_queensland_experiment ) at my university . 
  it 's completely publicly accessible , and pretty unique -- it 's the world 's longest-running lab experiment , and received an ig-nobel prize . 
  it got rejected . 
  what i really wish they did was tell you * why * something is rejected . 
  reddit has this really retarded bit of syntax . 
  if you start a line with `` 6 . 
  '' , or any other number , it assumes you want to start a list from 1 . 
  to get around this , start the line with `` 6 \\ . '', 
  instead . 
  see ? 
  the problem is that sometimes people do n't notice it and they could get confused about what you 're talking about . 
  ( if they think you actually meant to say 1 . ), 
  you mean how it happens in movies set today which are * filmed * today ? 
   i do n't even remember how that played out , just that it happened, 
  that 's because it * did n't * `` play out '' . 
  it quite literally just happened . 
  nah man , no way . 
  c programming language ? 
  unix ? 
  bah , they 're not * important * !, 
  on a serious note , who 's mccarthy ?
