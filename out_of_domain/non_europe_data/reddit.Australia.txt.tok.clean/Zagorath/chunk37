  if you or anyone else wants an invite to the dropbox folder just ask ( if everyone did this it would make the process a lot simpler as we would have a single common repository for all files related to this ) . 
  if you do n't have an account , you can try [ this link ] ( http://db.tt/e3puspt ) to get one with an extra 0.5 gb . 
  the sibelius file is sibelius 6 , but if anyone wants an older version ask and i 'll convert . 
  also , bonus points if anyone knows where i got the thematic material from . 
  good luck incendiary :d, 
  yeah , that 's a very good point , thanks . 
  i completely overlooked that . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  nono , what he 's saying is that * your * computer will give a warning that the certificate is untrusted ( that 's the `` something fishy '' ) , and that unless you accept it anyway ( thus allowing them to see ) , you wo n't be able to get at your email . 
  i ca n't validate or refute this myself , it 's just a clarification on what creamedunicorn was saying . 
  it 's already been specified that we can right as little or as much as we like . 
  i thought i 'd go with a bit on the longer side . 
  i do n't think i can say more as to my reasoning without breaking the rules , though :p, 
  sounds like she broke the law, 
  it 's a bright side because it pretty much guarantees a labor win next time round . 
  if what he said is true , anyway . 
  oh god did he really say that ? 
  i suppose they justify it with the cost of distributing it . 
  whether not not this justification is a valid one is another matter . 
  in the third image the guy on the left looks like he 's entertained . 
  i dunno , looks like genuine enthusiasm to me . 
  then again , he 's not got that same face in the other photos where we see him . 
  yes of course , that 's exactly what i was thinking of . 
  the opening to the first movement is the best !, 
  idea gold ? 
  damn , i thought of that about a week after the founding of this subreddit . 
  wish i 'd gone through with it . 
  nevermind . 
  off i go !, 
  beethoven 's trio for piano , clarinet , and cello , in b flat major . 
  ca n't post a link , i 'm on alien blue , but it 's a great piece , and not nearly as well known an his symphonies , piano sonatas , or quartets . 
  the success of the two youtube orchestras says otherwise . 
  to each his own . 
  personally , i find most mozart rather dull , apart from his later works ( clarinet concerto , 40th & 41st symphonies , and of course the requiem ) . 
  but then , i 'd like to think that this community , of all communities , would be able to accept people with different tastes to themselves . 
  iphones do n't have dvorak as a software keyboard option . 
  i called shenanigans . 
  ah yeah , did n't think of that . 
  ah yeah , thanks . 
  yeah definitely . 
  hey incendiary , could you [ submit a post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/feedforward/submit ) with your links in it . 
  either a single dropbox folder ( or some other site ) link , or a self post with all of them in there in text . 
  cheers . 
  with a non-retina macbook pro , yes , you can install it yourself . 
  they even give instructions on how to do it in the mini-manual thing you get . 
  as he said : `` aside from the air and retina macbooks ( where ram is soldered and not upgradable ) '' . 
  the non-retina macbook pros are still user upgradeable , and even , as he said , have instructions on how to do it . 
  no , fuck the patent system for allowing apple to get their stupid patents . 
  oh , do n't get me wrong , i completely agree . 
  what apple 's doing is deplorable . 
  i just try to see it from their point of view , which comes in two main parts . 
  ( edit : obviously , i mean that i see two main parts to it , who knows what apple really thinks ), 
  1 ) it 's good for business : personally , this as an excuse is particularly reprehensible , but it does at least make sense . 
  2 ) they feel ripped off by google : back when the iphone was first announced , apple and google were working very close together , and i think apple ( particularly jobs ) felt betrayed when they ( he ) found out they were developing android . 
  for consumers , of course , this is a great thing . 
  having the choice between two very good mobile operating systems , each competing with each other , can be nothing but good . 
  still , i think it understandable that they feel upset at this , as the initial android release was very much inspired by what apple had done . 
  and slide to unlock is probably the single most ridiculous patent that has ever been awarded . 
  shame on the system for allowing it , and shame on apple for actually using it . 
  yeah , sorry , but it will make a big difference . 
  if the cuttoff is the start of september , as in most northern hemisphere then someone born in september will be in the oldest of their year group , whereas someone born in august of the same year will be the youngest of the next year group up . 
  if you 're in the southern hemisphere , these particular months have no special difference : both are relatively young . 
  how people * perceive * themselves is of course going to be influenced by whether they actually are in the older or younger half . 
  not to mention that no doubt ** many ** people will not have given it much thought , and so they would probably benefit from a third option to that effect . 
  i agree with the not getting chatty part . 
  i have n't worked in any field related to this , but i have travelled a lot . 
  people who are travelling are generally not in the mood for too much needless talk . 
  definitely be as friendly as possible , but jokes , ice breakers , and puns i would avoid unless the customer makes it clear that 's what they want ( by making a joke first , themselves , for example ) . 
  apple 's aperture and adobe 's photoshop lightroom ( more commonly known as simply `` lightroom '' ) are the two best programmes out there for organising and editing photos . 
  as far as quality after export goes , there 's probably no real difference between them . 
  you get more video editing features in lightroom ( some basic colour-grading ) , but other than that it 's really just what you 're more comfortable using . 
  how curious . 
  did school begin around january/february , or in august/september ? 
  i 've got ta say , that system kind of confuses me . 
  to me it just makes sense that they cut off around the same time as the school year starts . 
  still , i suppose what one 's used to usually seems the more natural . 
  do n't you feel that this essentially is like `` indoctrinating '' them with atheism ? 
  why would it be different to having them go to church until they decide that they do n't want to ? 
  another huge pro : having a community to be a part of . 
  my grandparents are very loyal to their church , but i honestly do n't think their religion itself is very deep . 
  they go , and help out , because it makes them feel like they 're contributing . 
  but then those low es would be way too low . 
  or , if you meant only those three circled notes , do n't you think it would just seem odd ? 
  i think i can answer one part . 
  putting an interesting rhythm on it would not be valid to how the data was recorded , i think . 
  why semiquavers at 60 crotchets per minute , i suspect it 's just artistic . 
  also , only based on this one quote :, 
   `` after hearing the piano solo version , i created another version , more in tone with the resulting melody . 
  i added bass , percussion , marimba and xylophone , '' vicinanza said . 
  it seems that the choices were purely cosmetic . 
  also , the tagline `` life 's good '' came from australia , which is apparently where many of their products are/were tested . 
  actually , worldwide her experience is the more common one . 
  i loved that when i first found it out . 
  i was also somewhat confused when i found out it 's pronounced cy ** di ** a , with emphasis on the second syllable . 
  personally i think that for mmos the buying of items with real money is the best model . 
  the items should always be either purely cosmetic , or available naturally within the game , though , in my opinion . 
  another great model is the one taken by runescape , which gives a massively detailed and rich experience for free , but then you can pay a subscription fee to go beyond that . 
  ( especially clever on jagex 's part because after a certain amount of play becoming a subscriber does become necessary to keep advancing . ), 
  wait , have they announced it 'll be subscription-based ? 
  well , to be honest i 'm not sure the `` being surprised '' bit is , but certainly the cause thereof is more common .
