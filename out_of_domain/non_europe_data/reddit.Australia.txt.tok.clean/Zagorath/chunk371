  it really depends on what they died from . 
  if it 's something of their own making ( e.g. 
  not swimming between the flags , going out into the country with inadequate supplies and no contacts ) then you should n't make a deal out of it . 
  if it 's something else , for example a tendency for tourists to be attacked , or something similar to the bars serving drinks with methanol in them that happened in bali a little while back , * then * a deal should be made of it in a more general sense . 
   the war is mentioned in almost every class in school, 
  i 'm curious as to how it comes up in a maths class . 
  i 'm the biggest google fanboy normally , but when it comes to youtube and its content id system i go full rage . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/10lsvv/just_one_example_of_youtube_allowing_copyright/ ) is one similar example i had on my account a year ago . 
  [ and this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/copyright/comments/10ri8t/my_response_to_a_fraudulent_copyright_claim_by/ ) is my experience when trying to contact the harry fox agency , which was the company attempting to claim copyright over the pieces in my case . 
  [ another link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/screenshots/comments/10rhk7/shortly_after_i_took_this_the_post_was_deleted/ ) with the same screenshot but a different set of comments . 
  the way i think they should handle all copyright on youtube is this :, 
   instead of it being automatic take downs , it should automatically send a notification for every suspected violation ( by the automatic detection system ) to the suspected copyright holder . 
  they should then have to manually respond to each and every suspected violation . 
  if they choose to accept the claim , then the user who uploaded the video is notified and gets the chance to counter the claim . 
  if the user turns out to be right , it should be a strike against the copyright claimant . 
  10 strikes and they should be banned from launching any claims for a year . 
   this is just the way that dmca works, 
  it is * not * how dmca works . 
  dmca is a much more consumer-friendly law . 
  it would require the copyright holders to be the ones that place a claim on work found to be incorrectly used , not require youtube to constantly scan every video and take down anything vaguely resembling something that could have , at one time , been copyrighted . 
  google goes well above and beyond what is necessary to be compliant with dmca , in order to encourage large copyright holders to play nice with them ( for example , getting vevo involved ) . 
  yeah , that 's exactly what i was talking about . 
  although i had the figure wrong , [ it 's on roads marked 90 or higher ] ( http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/safety/queensland-road-rules/road-rules-refresher/keeping-left.aspx ) . 
  the tv shows usually talk about * temporary * insanity . 
  ianal , but in the shows the way they use it is that something caused the defendant to be insane at the time of the crime , but they are now perfectly fine . 
  no idea how it actually works , though . 
  edit : as a side note , researching this caused me to come across [ the twinkie defense ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twinkie_defense#origins ) , which was really interesting . 
   the expression derives from the 1979 trial of dan white , a former san francisco , california ( u.s. ) police officer and firefighter , and until just before the crime , a city district supervisor . 
  on november 27 , 1978 , white assassinated mayor george moscone and supervisor harvey milk . 
  at the trial , psychiatrist martin blinder testified that white had been depressed at the time of the crime , and pointed to several behavioral changes indicating white 's depression : he had quit his job ; he shunned his wife ; and although normally clean-cut , he had become slovenly in appearance . 
  furthermore , white had previously been a fitness fanatic and health food advocate , but had begun consuming junk food and sugar-laden soft drinks like coca-cola . 
  as an incidental note , blinder mentioned theories that elements of diet could worsen existing mood swings . 
  another psychiatrist , george solomon , testified that white had `` exploded '' and was `` sort of on automatic pilot '' at the time of the killings . 
  the fact that white had killed moscone and milk was not challenged , but -- in part because of the testimony from blinder and other psychiatrists -- the defense successfully convinced the jury that white 's capacity for rational thought had been diminished ; the jurors found white incapable of the premeditation required for a murder conviction , and instead convicted him of voluntary manslaughter . 
  public protests over the verdict led to the white night riots . 
   this makes it sound as if the man was in trouble for buying the agent when he thought he was buying a gorilla so he was tricked into buying the agent , or entrapped . 
   obviously i realize the man was in trouble for attempting to buy a gorilla, 
  i had to read this three times before i understood what was going on -- what the difference between the two sentences is . 
  yes it is , and no it is n't . 
  it does n't help that the guy forgot to use punctuation until half way through . 
  lpt : the expression is '' * could n't * care less '' . 
   the industry , and supporting industries , need to move to a better solution . 
  i still ca n't believe that my bank wo n't even allow me to use an otp authenticator to authroise transactions over $ x , it bewilders me . 
  you should have a look in to sqrl , an alternate login system designed by security expert steve gibson . 
  even if they did know about how debt can be sold like that , there 's still no way a smart person would give up their details to a third party without seeing the contract to sell said debt . 
  80 years prior ? 
  why are you comparing the date of publication for one of the books to the movies ? 
  as far as the jackson movies are concerned , the hobbit * is * a prequel . 
  it 's set in a time earlier than lotr , and it was made after . 
  that it was based on a book that came out before the lotr novel is n't pertinent . 
  what if he was talking about that * other * avatar movie ? 
   defacing a political sign is one of the lowest things you can do, 
  i do n't see how it 's any lower than defacing anything else , really . 
  yes , that 's very low , but there 's no reason that this should be extra special . 
  something something lake laogai . 
  it 's a joke among fans of avatar . 
  we pretend the movie does n't exist because it was , quite frankly , one of the worst movie adaptations of another medium that has ever been made mainstream . 
  right ahead of eragon . 
  it asked whether you 're a sophomore etc. 
  in college . 
  i said `` none of these '' because we do n't use that terminology where i am , and also because even if we did , i 'm half way between freshman ( which oddly was not an option ) and sophomore -- having finished my first year but not yet started my second . 
  the survey then kicked me out and wo n't let me continue ... 
  edit : opened it in a different browser and just selected sophomore . 
  now i ca n't complete the next question . 
  i entered my gpa ( it 's 5.33 -- on a 7 point scale ) , and it 's asking me to `` enter a positive number '' . 
  seriously dude , you need to step up your game in designing this survey . 
  i suspect you really only want american uni students in their second or further year of study . 
  in that case you really need to specify that both in the title here on sample size , and on the informed consent page of the survey itself . 
  statistics lecturer , is he ? 
  you would n't happen to know which course ( s ) he takes , would you ? 
  ah right , no problem . 
  it 's just that i 'm taking a statistics course semester 2 this year and i was wondering if i might have him . 
  i think he was confusing it for how you will lose your * trademark * if you do n't defend it . 
  people on here hate to admit it , but the earlier samsung android phones * were * blatantly ripping off the iphone . 
  they 've moved way past that now , but earlier ones it 's hard to make a case that they * were n't * trying to make it looks similar . 
  take a particular look at [ the icons ] ( http://technewsreporter.blogspot.com/2011/08/samsung-riping-off-iphone-icons.html#.uvo0_wssxl0 ) samsung used . 
  it 's pretty hard to deny they were n't deliberately making their design similar . 
  there are a bunch of things that i would do , travel a heap , buy an awesome computer and play games at high settings , put much more effort into my music . 
  but the one that i 'd really love to do is study . 
  i have a huge interest in so many different fields , even though i 'm not necessarily very * good * at them . 
  i 'd love to get ( or at least try to get ) bachelor degrees in economics , history , physics , music , filmmaking , psychology , and more , in addition to my current field of software engineering . 
  i could easily spend my life just learning things . 
  that 's not what my phone ( vanilla android ) looks like today . 
  the phone app is similar-ish , it 's a blue phone on a transparent background , but the phone is shaped more or less the same as the white bit in those logos . 
  there 's no included notes app , but the downloadable google keep logo is a lightbulb on yellow stickies , not lined note paper . 
  gallery has a piece of abstract art in a frame , and play music is a set of headphones . 
  the `` people '' and settings apps are pretty similar , but like the phone app that 's because there 's only so much you can do with them to have an easily-recognisable logo . 
  a design similar to a physical contact booklet is easily recognisable , and the industry has standardised on the use of a gear/gears to represent settings . 
  which brings me to the macbooks . 
  i do n't know of any computer that looks substantially similar to the mbps ( either the retina ones or the non-retina ones ) , but many ultrabooks certainly do bear a resemblance to the macbook air . 
  however , i do n't think they could sue for this mainly because the design is fundamentally the only way to get a super thin , super light computer that still has some power . 
  you need that tapered shape to get it as thin as possible , while still having stuff inside it ( in the thicker part ) . 
  yeah this was really weird , i just came from an / r/community thread and the first thing i see when i come back to / r/arrow was this . 
  ( side note , [ apparently arrow is n't popular among community fans ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/1wm3vn/indepth_discussion_thread_for_community_s05e06/cf6p26f?context=3 ) . ), 
  bruce ? 
  man , right after sarah took the poison i got interrupted and had to go do something else . 
  i spent that whole time wondering if this was where she dies and the rest of the season would lead up to laurel becoming cannery . 
  god dammit . 
  another break * again * ? 
  what 's it for this time ?
