  surely valentine 's day is n't a big enough holiday to warrant a break for not one but * two * weeks . 
  on the plus side , i guess this means i 'll be better able to binge house of cards when it comes out . 
  this was really minor , and you 've mentioned it heaps of times in the past , so i 'm not surprised you left it out this week , but we got another `` delta charlie 52 '' this episode . 
  oh right . 
  yeah , i know who bruce wayne is , i just did n't realise you were talking about someone not from arrow . 
  oh shit of course . 
  i 'm from a country that does n't compete in the winter olympics in a significant way , so it slipped my mind . 
  thanks !, 
  hey man , * i * do n't like comics . 
  i still love this show . 
  and heaps of other comic-based shows and movies ... just ca n't get into comics because of how convoluted they all are . 
  ( and yeah , these two are definitely among my favourite ongoing shows , too . ), 
  use of the drone was * completely * justified . 
  they were n't in spanish in my version ... 
  true , but the league of assassins and the al ghuls have been introduced already . 
   and canadians to some extent, 
  i 'm not a native french speaker , but according to those that i 've talked to , canadians do n't do this `` to some extent '' , they do it heaps ( in french , at least ) . 
  do historical places count ? 
  memphis tennessee shares its name with an ancient egyptian capital city ( not european , though , obviously ) . 
  i got really confused the first time i saw cast away when he says something about how he 'll always keep his watch on memphis time . 
  i did n't understand why an american would want to keep his watch on egyptian time ... 
  the americanisation that always grabs me is detroit . 
  it seems so much more natural to me to pronounce it the same way americans do , but without the t. kinda half way between the american pronunciation and the way the french would pronounce it . 
  ( i 'm just going to pretend notre dame university does n't exist . ), 
  all steroids do ( from what i remember from sports science class in high school ) is allow you to work out for longer periods of time and without needing as much recovery time . 
  how did they get that study past the ethics board ? 
  ( or is 600 mg a dosage that 's often used in medicines anyway ? ), 
  yup , noh-ter-dame is how they pronounce the name of a university in the us . 
  i believe detroit is deh-troyt , and while the most obvious pronunciation for me would be the actual french one ( because i studied it in high school ) , to anglicise it i would probably go `` deh-troy '' , leaving out the t ( like we do with ballet or valet ) . 
   water , fire , air and dirt, 
  long ago , the four nations lived together in harmony ... 
  when i saw your comment , i assumed it was one of those things on imgur where it says . gif in the file but it 's actually a jpg . 
  but how do you make that mistake when it actually says . jpg \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  oh shit , i did n't even realise it was n't until i saw your comment . 
  but surely if you 've got a decentralised internet then you must also have a decentralised web ? 
  ( but not necessarily the other way around . ), 
  someone tell harmon and the community writers to stop it , too . 
  i do n't know if mpc supports it or not , but i know vlc wo n't play midi files . 
  when i want to play midi i have to resort to windows media player or quicktime ( depending on the os ) , or even go to the effort of importing it into sibelius . 
  edit : just tried it . 
  it seems quicktime x does n't work with midis anymore . 
  i coulda sworn it used to in snow leopard , at least . 
  quicktime 7 plays them , but sounds awful . 
  looks like sibelius it is ... 
  ... does n't even have support for other platforms . 
  where possible i 'd prefer to be able to use the same programme on all my machines . 
  oh right !, 
  you were talking about in-universe time !, 
  sorry , i did n't realise . 
  but surely in that case it is quite clearly a prequel ( if you ignore the fact that technically prequels would be something * written * after the original ) ? 
  australia , but currently in vietnam . 
  neither of which has a major presence in winter olympics . 
  ( but both have a fairly substantial presence in the olympics . ), 
  i do n't understand what 's going on in the 2011 comic ... can anyone explain it ? 
  actually , because the definition of a `` continent '' is not very specific , many people do consider the americas , or `` america '' a single continent . 
  chiefly those in latin america . 
  personally i find it odd that you would consider them one continent when they 're separated by such a thin isthmus , but because of how vague the definition is they 're not * wrong * per se . 
  it 's even weirder to me when these same people * do n't * consider eurasia a single continent . 
  i subscribe to a six continent model , taking the 7 continents most in the anglosphere are taught , but combining europe and asia into eurasia , because it just does n't make sense that they would be separated when the land is completely connected by thousands of kilometres .

  actually , that is n't unique to us americans . 
  it 's literally everyone outside of latin america ( allowing for translations of the term into their own language ) , and even some people within latin america . 
  if you want to get really technical , latin americans and some europeans refer to the whole area as `` america '' or `` the americas '' , but most others refer to north and south america as separate continents . 
  both are correct , because the definition of a continent is very vague .

  ah right , thanks . 
  i did n't realise that was a paint swatch . 
  but if he * starts * at $ 5 , and somehow it ends up at $ 20 , then he 's somehow been convinced to pay more for something . 
  that 's how i interpreted it , anyway . 
  i still do n't get it . 
  what 's it referring to ? 
  [ this guy , too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6xuamc5zmm&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ) . 
  then why is the indian subcontinent not separate from east asia , or even worse , why is the middle-east considered the same ? 
  while we 're on it , eastern europe , western europe , and northern europe , or northern , central , and southern africa . 
  in aus i do n't even use a pin half the time . 
  if it 's under $ 100 , just tap to pay . 
  paypass and paywave are awesome . 
  in australia visa and mastercard ( with their paypass and paywave -- not sure which is which ) allow contactless payment on anything under $ 100 . 
  but even if someone does steal your card and buy things using this method , you 're still not going to be out of pocket . 
  the bank and the debit card company are both responsible for it before the user is . 
  but what he was talking about was paying with your * phone * . 
  being able to just tap your phone on the contact thing , rather than having to remember to bring your card . 
  it 's helpful for distinguishing between metre , the distance , and meter , a thing you use to measure something . 
  same with practice vs. practise . 
  one 's the verb , one 's the noun . 
  ~ ~ that 's not how they do it . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ iirc , they do it by having a single card that they give to users . 
  it 's just a normal card , tied to a normal account that they set up . 
  then , when you pay , they take whatever it 's set up to pay with , and on their end they pay using that account , going through the single account that the card is set up to pay by . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ really bad explanation , but hopefully it 's clear . 
  if it 's not i can try to explain it more carefully if you like . ~ ~,
