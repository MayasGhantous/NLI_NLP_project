  excel on os x is fucking awful , and the apple equivalent -- numbers , i think it 's called -- is even worse . 
   a country not many people want to be in, 
  huh ? 
  you talking about vietnam here ? 
  because that 's absolutely not true . 
  vietnam is a very fast growing economy , and many people with a vietnamese heritage who left during the war are now returning back to the country to invest and start businesses . 
  they even have a word for them -- vi\u1ec7t ki\u1ec1u . 
  not many people are going the other way . 
  i know many children from wealthy vietnamese families are leaving to go to uni ( chiefly to the uk or the us ) , because vietnam 's education system is really poor , but they will then also return to vietnam . 
  it really is . 
  supermarkets here sell pirated dvds completely openly . 
  plus , if anyone did try to seize his assets , he would almost certainly be able to pay them off with a nice healthy bribe , because police and other officials here are * insanely * corrupt . 
  how many clarinetists does it take to change a lightbulb ? 
  just one , but he 'll go through the whole box to find just the right one . 
  * it was a safe seat . 
  * labor already held the seat . 
  * only twice in history has a government won a seat it did n't previously hold in a by-election . 
  * the lnp nationally is sinking in popularity at the moment . 
  * the lnp in queensland has been extremely unpopular for a while . 
  there was no way labor could have possibly lost this seat . 
  i do n't know how the act does it , but i personally am firmly against nz 's mmp system because of how it institutionalises parties . 
  instead , i 'd like to see the method described in [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) adopted . 
  tl ; dw , use the same system we currently use in the senate , altered slightly to fit the house of representatives . 
  you just talked about all the same points you did previously , without actually addressing the new information i tried to bring to the table . 
  it 's a physical involuntary reaction i 'm talking about . 
  not one as severe as vomiting , but a real one nonetheless . 
  besides , this is on a spectrum . 
  one does n't have to have `` the disorder '' to suffer from the symptoms . 
  you can have them , but not have them severely enough to actually be diagnosed with the disorder , because it is n't -- for that person -- causing a large amount of distress ( on of the key factors in diagnosing any mental disorder ) . 
  vietnam , like many developing countries , has massive income inequality . 
  many people would be making much less than this in a year , but there is a not-insignificant number of people that would be making more than this per month . 
  you should always use the s. it 's * uncivilised * not to . 
  seriously , the irrational apple hate is probably in my top 5 least favourite things about reddit , and it 's so damn pervasive . 
  oh awesome . 
  that 's exactly the same method i was proposing . 
  what is ? 
  i was tempted to go 1011 . 
  that was my thought , too . 
  although i thought it would be comparing human `` random '' to true random by tossing a coin , rather than computer generated pseudorandom . 
  we 're all wondering the same thing . 
  i missed it the first time because of the bad ( lack of ) punctuation . 
  i thought that when it said `` it was n't weird he was worried she has ... '' he meant `` it was n't weird * that * he was worried she has '' , which is how it would normally be interpreted without a comma , as it should have been written `` it want weird , he was worried she has '' . 
  following on from that misinterpretation , the rest of the comment just made no sense to me until i went back and realised it was because he missed out a damn comma . 
  looking at this on mobile i am so damn confused . 
  5pm here . 
  i actually have auto rotating turned off because it 's more often annoying than useful , but i turned it back on for this and it did the job !, 
  i could explain it , but you 'll get a much clearer understanding if you watch [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt0i-sdosxu&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player ) . 
  as a tl ; dw , in mmp people actually officially vote for parties , instead of all votes technically going to the specific member you voted for . 
  actually i understood the concept just fine from text descriptions . 
  it 's only the diagram that looks really bizarre . 
  the term `` raspberry '' for that actually comes specifically from the fact that it sounds like a fart . 
  it 's rhyming slang . 
  fart rhymes with tart -  raspberry tart -  raspberry . 
  well that came out of no where . 
  dunno about the other day , but gmg [ does n't currently have bnw for $ 7 ] ( http://www.greenmangaming.com/s/vn/en/pc/games/strategy/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/ ) , it 's currently at $ 30 . 
  i 'd love it if someone could point me to where you * can * get bnw for under $ 10 , though . 
  i 've already seen the humble bundle , and $ 15 is more than i 'm willing to pay to just get bnw . 
  awesome thanks . 
  i 'll keep an eye out . 
  more like tire is the american spelling , since tyre is used by most other english dialects , too . 
  similarly , i 'd like to think that if someone had done this when i was a kid i would have gone straight to an adult . 
  in queensland they were required to not call it peanut butter because dairy farmers did n't want people confused . 
  so it 's called peanut paste . 
  betteridge 's law of headlines states that : `` any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no . '', 
  seems to hold up here . 
  i was taught about the electron in a box model and when it 's useful in highschool ... 
   most high school teachers probably believe the earth is closer to the sun when it 's summer in the northern hemisphere . 
  wait what ? 
  how does * anyone * believe this ? 
  i 'm pretty sure i learnt how it works in year 1 of primary school ... 
   do n'tchaknow . 
  the canadians invented concentration camps ? 
  who thinks beethoven is austrian ? 
  i 've certainly never heard people say that . 
  are they just mixing up him and mozart ? 
  piggy backing on the top comment here . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but surely it is n't an `` oh jb-hifi '' moment . 
  game ratings are n't done by the store , they 're done by the national [ classification board , the acb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_classification_board ) . 
  unless jb is doing their own recommended ratings in addition to that -- of which i would n't even be sure about the legality . 
  to be fair , it is the winter olympics . 
  i 'd expect a country like canada to always do really well in the winter olympics . 
  mmm yeah . 
  posted in / r/gaming twice before , each time at least a month ago , and each time got at most 8 upvotes . 
  heck , even its most successful posting was in / r/australia and got only 188 upvotes . 
  downvote and move on ? 
  sure i will , but it 'll be this comment , not the post . 
  it only really works when it hurts people . 
  on the sopa thing a while back , massive sites like reddit and wikipedia were blanked out , causing lots of people to take notice . 
  when a site that people probably were n't visiting anyway does it , it is n't quite so noticeable . 
  however , it can still be useful in that case as part of a broader campaign where lots of sites ( whether large or small ) are doing it . 
  as far as i was aware they did n't run anyone in the reps during the september election . 
  do you know where they did ( if anywhere ) ? 
  but i agree with you regarding their preference flow . 
  i really did n't agree with it in my state . 
  that said , i really liked their * method * for coming up with said preference flow , which was done [ in a very highly public manner ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/preferences ) . 
  op never claimed it was original content . 
  and yes , when it was posted and how much it was upvoted and commented on is important . 
  if not many people saw it last time , then it is appropriate to repost it in the hopes that more people will see it . 
  yes . 
  yes of course it is okay .
