  but seriously dude , you 're entitled to believe what you want , but realise most people will disagree with you because there 's literally no logical reason to suspect such a society would actually work . 
  i 've never actually looked into data only plans before . 
  i 'm curious , how much data are you looking at for those $ 5 . 
  here in aus the cheapest i can find is $ 10 for 1 gb 3g or $ 15 for 4g . 
  if i find myself running against the limit this year i 'll probably do that . 
  i played the beta last weekend from in vietnam on a far worse connection than in australia . 
  lag was noticeable but not game breaking by any means , so i 'm not too worried about it . 
  distance is n't the only thing that matters though . 
  vietnam 's connection is actually slow enough that speed does become a factor . 
  in terms of latency my experience has been that they 're more or less the same when connecting to the us . 
  i 've never really looked at it for europe but i think in both countries the us would have less latency anyway . 
  and yeah , australia . 
  i do n't know about this new sort , but traditional wind power farms actually shut down when the wind is too much because a ) there 's risk of damage and b ) they could n't store the extra power that would be generated anyway . 
  that 's a real shame , because i reckon if it was well made an mmo set in the avatarverse in the time of tla would be awesome . 
  according to [ imdb ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1402100/ ) she was meng . 
   \\ - the fortuneteller ( 2005 ) ... meng / additional voices ( voice ), 
  from memory , meng is the little girl who had a crush on aang . 
  edit : [ here 's a really low quality youtube video of meng ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgavv-wqlwa ), 
  [ html5 gfy version of this gif ] ( http://gfycat.com/prestigiousfeminineirrawaddydolphin ) . 
  it 'll play back much faster and more smoothly . 
  would be particularly useful if i had the actual original video that the gif was made from in much higher quality , since that could be made into an html5 version and loaded super quickly without sacrificing quality as much as gif does . 
  i have n't tried anything , but [ this ] ( http://download.cnet.com/dreamscene-video-wallpaper/3000-2049_4-10913980.html ) looks like it should work on windows , and [ this ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/add-movie-wallpaper-hd/id466991035?mt=12 ) for os x. 
  you might need to download something to convert the file into a format that will work with these programmes , but that 's super easy to do . 
  just google `` convert webm to [ format ] on [ operating system ] '' . 
  download the actual file by right clicking on the video and pressing `` download file as '' , `` save video as '' , or something similar . 
  it 's in the . webm file format . 
  yup . 
  not all browsers support html5 , but gfy even has that covered , with the option to switch to a gif . 
  but in cases like this i find it even worse , because by making it into a gif to begin with , you 're losing so much quality over what would be an absolutely stunning image otherwise . 
  in many english dialects , the term `` slingshot '' actually refers to what you call a sling . 
  the term `` shanghai '' is a common one to describe what you call a slingshot . 
  personally , i 'm from a place that uses that terminology , but i do n't like it . 
  i much prefer the terms sling and slingshot . 
  feels more natural to me . 
  indeed it was , but some dialects use the term slingshot to refer to that same type of weapon . 
  ( in these dialects , the thing you would refer to as a `` slingshot '' is given another name , such as a `` shanghai '' . ), 
  i wonder if perhaps * driving * someone to 123 fake st. in order for them to pick up drugs would be considered illegal . 
  i can see how some would argue ( though i would personally not be among them ) that linking to illegal material with the intention of specifically aiding others to download said material would in itself be illegal . 
  oh yay , another `` let 's all hate on season 4 '' thread . 
  give it a rest already guys , it is n't anywhere near as bad as you make out . 
  exactly . 
  i agree that season 4 was definitely the worst of the 4 seasons ( although i have to say , at the start of season 5 i thought it might take that crown from it ) , but it 's no where near as bad as people make out . 
  people talk about how the characters massively changed . 
  but they did n't . 
  it just extended the arc that they were going through from the very beginning . 
  maybe it went a little too far , but it 's still the same as what was happening previously . 
  it had more really bad episodes than any other season , and the puppet episode was absolutely abysmal , and the whale episode also one of the worst ( though i enjoyed abed 's b story ) . 
  but it also had some great episodes . 
  i really enjoyed the thanksgiving episode , the dance episode , and the final two episodes : heroic origins and the episode that the original post is from . 
  in fact , all four of those i would probably have in my top 15 total episodes . 
  i think a lot of people here are upset because of how they watched the show . 
  they watched it from the beginning , or came in some time during seasons 1 or 2 , and then suffered through all the pain that came with delayed airing and knowing how harmon got sacked etc. 
  this clouds their judgement somewhat , and it takes fresh eyes : someone who came in after season 4 was already aired and watched all of them without knowing any of the extrashow context , to give an unbiased view of the show . 
  ** tl ; dr ** season 4 is the worst of the seasons , but it 's not enormously worse, 
  edit : side note , i recently downloaded the green lantern film . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of the character or anything , but i was looking for some superhero stuff to watch that i had n't already seen . 
  is it so bad that i should just delete it now , or is it worth watching once just to know what it 's really like ? 
   i 'm the only caucasian in my class, 
  this was me in hl maths . 
  but anyway , i 'm not going to try and convince you one way or the other in terms of choosing , but i 'll add my thoughts to the process . 
  spanish is , to my knowledge , a language very widely spoken in the us , due to its location near latin american countries . 
  there 's probably more available in terms of local use of the language if you take spanish . 
  but china is a fast-growing market and i 've heard many people recommend learning mandarin for the ability to operate in a business sense with china . 
  its probably also spoken by less people in the us than spanish is , and that may increase your personal value if you speak it fluently . 
   neither should distributing copyrighted material, 
  i disagree with this . 
  copyright is important , it 's just that these days most western countries take it ** waaay ** too far . 
  for a far better explanation than what i could possible hope to give , check out the second episode of cgpgrey and brady haran ( of numberphile as well as many other youtube channels ) 's new podcast '' [ hello internet ] ( http://www.hellointernet.fm/ ) '' . 
  could you ( or someone else ) name these stories ? 
  i recognise a few , but there are others i 'm drawing a blank on , and i 'm sure others are in the same boat . 
  when i hear the name dr. seuss , i always immediately imagine an image of the cat in the hat cover , but green eggs and ham is the story that actually comes to mind . 
  i ca n't speak for others , but for me the ironic use of `` le '' or `` tips fedora '' is starting to become just as annoying as the legitimate use of it . 
  i note that you 're american , but i do n't know what your context is around here -- whether you regularly browse / r/australia and/or follow some australian politics , or you came from / r/all , or whatever . 
  the short answer is , last september , and yes indeed , they do scarily resemble your republican party , albeit with less gun madness . 
  there are certain things you can fudge , though . 
  if you 've got a fast upward run ( often in some odd tuplet ) you can usually get away with hitting the first and last notes , and just whatever in between , for example . 
  have you looked at the liszt reductions of beethoven symphonies ? 
  i 'm curious as to what you think of them . 
  as a clarinetist , could any string players here comment on this quote ? 
   a few fiddle players complained that wagner is a doddle compared to the long , exposed bows required in the slow movement of mozart 's clarinet concerto, 
  i 'm just not sure i understand why that would be the case . 
   full of octaves and monstrously hard, 
  i 'm not a very good pianist , but i looked at some of these reductions a while back . 
  that 's pretty much in line with what i thought of them . 
  but that 's what 's so great about gfy . 
  it has a button right there next to it for people who need an actual gif . 
  no they have the dlc done before the initial game is released . 
  it 's been a long time since i saw the second fantastic four film . 
  i remember it not being great , but being a whole lot better than the first one . 
  but the comparison to mos was a good one , thanks . 
  i do n't see how that line is any different to the s05e01 quip about `` a callback to my season 1 dialogue '' . 
  not a massive dc fan , but oh god i hated that film . 
  the first time i said as much online i was honestly really surprised at the negative reaction it got . 
  i think it was on here or / r/arrow , and i just said it offhand , assuming it was what the majority of people felt , and oh god was i wrong . 
  as an australian ( we use bandaid pretty much exclusively ) i have to do a double take every time i hear a british person call them plasters . 
  i always think of a cast ( for broken bones ) first . 
  you got tylenol and aspirin but left out the ubiquitous panadol ? 
  because outside of america the gelatin based dessert * is * jelly . 
  it 's not a matter of * thinking * anything , that 's just the word for it . 
  i ca n't speak for the poms , but in australia you do n't often come across what americans call jelly .
