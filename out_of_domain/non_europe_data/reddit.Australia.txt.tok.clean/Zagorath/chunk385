  i do n't know what your start menu looks like , but mine has never been neat and orderly . 
  applications constantly put themselves all over the place , in did n't folders and subfolders with no real consistency . 
  anglosphere commonwealth countries is a very small sample size . 
  there 's what , 4 countries ? 
  my understanding is that while the uk and canada had trouble with it , australia ( my own country ) and new zealand almost never use imperial units -- except in a couple of idioms . 
   the best outcome of this trend is imo veteran developers using kickstarter and the like to revive ... `` riskier '' projects without aaa publisher neck-breathing . 
  so much this . 
  games like planetary annihilation ( which seems to be coming along incredibly ) and kingdom come : deliverance ( which has n't yet finished its a kickstarter but also looks amazing ) really show what can be done without needing ( and in many ways * because * they do n't have ) a aaa backing . 
  i agree with you that the downvote button is frequently used as a `` disagree '' button , and it should n't be . 
  but i do n't think that 's the problem here . 
  it was a poorly made comment that came across more like loud wingeing than constructive criticism . 
  if he had used better grammar and avoided all-caps , we might have seen a different result . 
  i feel like the twit network in general does ads extremely well , and hello internet has basically the exact same model . 
  they 're clearly ads for products the presenter actually really likes , they 're a product that the audience is likely to be interested in , and they 're constructed to actually explain how and why it could be useful . 
  i 'm a strict republicanist , but as long as we live in a monarchy , i still prefer this term . 
  the original * is n't * synthesised . 
  at least not to my ear , or the ears of others on / r/classicalmusic . 
  [ the thread about the same link on r/classicalmusic ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1y4zdt/lara_takes_on_hbo_and_game_of_thrones_in_an_open/ ) . 
  no , deepness is appropriate . 
  bass has a more precise meaning that is n't appropriate in that sentence . 
  for what it 's worth , the musicians at / r/classicalmusic agree with you . 
  they even go further to actually point the specific musical reasons that hers is a bad performance . 
  [ relevant thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1y4zdt/lara_takes_on_hbo_and_game_of_thrones_in_an_open/ ) . 
  2 hours is a * very * long minuet . 
  [ not two hours ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2azoknkotvc ) . 
  why does it ask for the survey taker 's name ? 
  is that really necessary ? 
  were you out of pocket , or did it just refuse to let you purchase it ? 
  just got ta get the imperial edition to get the rings of mara , then you can find a wife . 
  pretty sure i 've heard him described as the john williams of video game music . 
  the winter olympic games are on at the moment , so many shows are on hiatus mid-season . 
  i 've seen plenty about ukraine and thailand in the news . 
  russia mainly only in relation to the winter games and the anti-gay controversy . 
  nothing about north korea recently ( although i did see a doco about them the other day ) . 
  this is the first time i 've heard anything about venezuela , though . 
  i ca n't think of exactly how you 'd do it , but i imagine your copy-pastes could increase exponentially in terms of how much is being copy-pasted each time . 
  yeah , my answer was basically a longer version of `` it is n't '' . 
  i just want to point out that such a sentiment is n't exclusively american . 
  while the overall feel in australia is one promoting collective rights , and i 'm very glad for that , those supporting libertarianism certainly do exist here , and we need to be wary their viewpoint does not gain significant traction . 
  yeah , seriously . 
  the importance of good healthcare ( along with education and infrastructure ) is one of the basic things taught in high school economics . 
  it has also been declared a [ basic human right ] ( http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ ) ( article 25 ( 1 ) ) . 
  all americans are from america . 
   you can see boobies on free tv here, 
  til . 
  ca n't say i ever have that i can remember . 
  uncle torrence . 
  i may have to start using that one . 
  look , i hate abbott as much as the next / r/australia regular , but you wan na provide some sources ? 
  particularly for the healthcare and food sections of your comment . 
   australians need to realise they 're not called the lucky country for no reason, 
  i think australians need to realise that they 're even called `` the lucky country '' first . 
  i , too , have travelled a lot , and have never once heard this before . 
  as long as the rules that we use * are n't * the ones in [ this game ] ( http://www.nick.com/games/legend-of-korra-pai-sho.html ) , i 'm happy . 
  it 's very clearly not how the game works in the show . 
  it seems to be designed to be essentially a clone of draughts , which does n't seem anything like how the original was . 
  oh right lol . 
  thanks for the clarification , i completely missed that . 
  wow , someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed . 
  or just a dick . 
  honestly that 's probably more likely . 
   it only gets weirder from there ... 
  please do get weird . 
  this is fascinating stuff , i 'd love to hear more examples . 
  i 'd like to see six * full * seasons and a movie . 
  count seasons four and five as one season together . 
   ( changes to a serif font on large pages ), 
  oh man , i 'm so glad this is n't only me . 
  it 's so fucking weird . 
  just randomly changes the font , but then i 'll click on some text and it all changes back . 
  i assume you mean east or west coast of the usa ? 
  by the way , which ib subject is this ? 
  geography ? 
  or that one with `` environment '' in its name ? 
  ( sorry , that other one was n't offered at my school so i 'm not familiar with it . ), 
  easier to call me dumb than to actually correct the honest mistake like the other guy did . 
  can always trust you to be in a thread about ingress , tb . 
  you could have stopped after five words of that comment and you would n't have been a dick . 
  instead you chose to get all superior and act like making simple mistakes is n't normal . 
  that says far more about you than me . 
  i do n't know how you can not get it through your thick head . 
  i saw the word `` deepness '' in the comment you replied to , and glazed over the word `` base '' entirely . 
  so i assumed you were correcting `` deepness '' to `` bass '' . 
  your correction , under the assumption i had made , * would have been incorrect * . 
  so i corrected it . 
  if you ca n't accept that this is a simple mistake , then it is certainly not i who needs to grow up . 
  oh man , i never knew this existed . 
  i mainly use a mobile app , but whenever i need to use the browser it 's always such a pain . 
  thanks for letting me know about this !, 
   you 're opinion, 
  muphry 's law in action !, 
  spend over $ 15 and get exclusive access to a live stream of the longplayer performance . 
  what was it ? 
  they 've deleted the comment . 
  prime ministers wear suits to job interviews ? 
  they 'd oppose isps doing that , but oppose government preventing isps doing it even more , would be my assumption . 
  personally i found http://senate.io easier to use . 
  i ca n't help but wonder where we 'd be today had rudd called a double dissolution election when he had the chance over the ets . 
  haha no worries mate . 
  shit happens .
