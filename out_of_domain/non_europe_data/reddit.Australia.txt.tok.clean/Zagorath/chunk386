  ( plus i agreed with you anyway . ), 
  well you could have seen what the mistake was at least as far back as [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1ya9j2/no_spoilers_canadian_violinist_lara_st_john/cfjnwzv ) comment , where i mentioned the other comment that corrected the mistake . 
  still , glad this could end civilly . 
  i have n't tried hl2 yet , and i might do so at some point -- though i strongly dislike entering series ( whether it be a game , tv show , film , or book series ) in the middle -- but i agree completely with you regarding hl1 . 
  i was playing through it late last year and again earlier this year , and i just could n't get into it . 
  the gameplay was incredibly clumsy and the story was just totally not engaging in the least . 
  it may have been revolutionary in the way it told that story at the time , but for someone going back and playing it for the first time today , it 's absolutely not worth it . 
  you need to \\ \\ # escape it , because otherwise reddit 's syntax does the dotted line thing . 
  copying and pasting it here for the lazy :, 
   `` it 's a national park , so you 'd never set up an extraction industry there , '' evans said . 
  `` but even if that were n't the case , it would still be difficult to capture this helium and purify it . 
  it just would n't be economical . '', 
  you can use mass to measure helium , because every piece of matter has mass . 
  you ca n't measure it with a set of scales , because left in open air it would just float to the top , or in a vacuum , because it would all fill the whole container and not put a lot of pressure on the scales . 
  i 'm not sure of the exact method that they use to measure the mass , although it probably makes use of the ideal gas equation , or one of its derivatives . 
  pv = mrt ( pressure * volume = mass * universal gas constant * temperature ), 
  i heard a heap about this when it first came out , but it was us only . 
  seems they 've opened it up since . 
  i 'm definitely not a hardcore player . 
  i doubt i 'd say i ever was , but i definitely am not now . 
  but anyway , shiggles seems pretty obvious to me , once you 're aware that it 's a contraction of `` shits and giggles '' . 
  it 's a matter of doing anything that 's fun for the heck of it , rather than meticulously planning out major operations in great detail . 
  i would n't say everyone plays by that mantra , but the idea of it is pretty simple . 
  dunno for certain about firefox , but that 's a feature built in to chrome . 
  i 'd be very surprised if firefox has n't adopted it , too ... 
   the basic storyline is that the enlightened ( green ) support the mind control of people by an alien race called the shapers . 
  while the resistance ( blue ) oppose it . 
  aww come on , that 's misleading and you know it !, 
  full disclosure , i 'm a member of the enlightened faction , but i 'm going to attempt to present the two sides as neutrally as i can . 
  the enlightened say that the shapers are what have , throughout history , been aiding humans in their technological and intellectual advancement . 
  we see concentrations of them at important landmarks and the sites of important events , and want to help spread their influence to help the future advancement of mankind . 
  the resistance do n't typically deny that influence , but worry about the reasons behind it . 
  why are the shapers shaping us ? 
  could it be that they are doing it purely for their own gain , and possibly helping them in the future would be detrimental to us ? 
  we just do n't know , so it 's best to hinder them in case their aims are harmful . 
  reddit has really , really awful auto-numbering . 
  want to start a numbered list with something other than 1 ? 
  too bad . 
  ( press `` source '' , and you 'll see i did n't actually choose to use 1 and 2 . ), 
  so you can do it like this, 
  and like this . 
  like this . 
  and this .

  \\* it 'll also work if you want to start a line with an asterisk rather, 
  * rather than a bullet, 
  or basically any piece of syntax . 
  the backslash is frequently used in many situations ( online syntax and programming are both very common uses ) where you want to have characters with a certain semantic meaning ( like asterisks on reddit \\* around a word or phrase * mean * make this italic * , or `` quotes in many programming languages mean this is a string type '' ) , but you want to use those characters as the character itself , rather than its actual meaning . 
  essentially , the escape character `` escapes '' it from their other meaning . 
  basically , put '' \\ '' in front of * any * character on reddit , and it will display that character , instead of using it for syntax . 
  man , the brackets in urls ( along with the auto-numbers ) have to be the absolute worst thing about reddit syntax . 
   i have a hatred for cardio, 
  a 30 minute walk is like an 8 minute bike ride , maybe 10 , tops . 
  hardly any cardio involved really !, 
  you 'd basically be unconsciously improving your fitness without ever feeling like you are . 
  it 's awesome all round . 
  if it 's hilly i 'd probably avoid it , though . 
  a comment elsewhere said that it was to do with recruitment . 
  they want to recruit people to join , and the clear windows give it this sense of romanticism that encourages people to sign up . 
  i know it feels a pity , but it 's actually an important thing . 
  others have described it much better than i could in other threads , but essentially it removes money from the game 's economy in order to minimise inflation . 
  yeah , i was going to suggest the user google '' * site : reddit.com/r\\/elderscrollsonline gold sink * '' , but i tried it myself and actually did n't come up with any of the helpful more detailed explanations that i 've seen , so i cut that bit out . 
  eso is an * incredible * example of a game that runs perfectly on os x. i played it during the last beta weekend , and it ran absolutely perfectly . 
  not a single crash or problem that was n't caused by their own network ( on account of it being a stress test ) . 
  another good example is civ v . it feels * almost * like a native version . 
  it 's definitely not as good as the windows version , but it definitely does n't feel like a shitty wine wrapper ( i 'm looking at you , the witcher ) . 
  i like the fact that you use the phrase `` rooting on my team '' , considering the other usage of the term `` root '' . 
  the op of this thread is one of those people . 
  it seems to me his reasoning is just `` i think it would be cool if it happened '' . 
  not anything about actual in-universe justification for how it would make sense , or anything like that . 
  just a desire for something that really makes no sense . 
   my understanding of the senate vote is that it whether someone votes above or below the line has no effect on how their vote is distributed ; it 's just an easier way for the person to submit their preferences . 
  my understanding is the same . 
  if you vote [ 1 ] for the australia reddit party above the line , it has the * exact * same outcome as if you were to look at australia reddit party 's recommended preference flow , and copied all of that down onto the ballot sheet below the line . 
  i 've been out of the game for a while . 
  what 's a glyph hack ? 
  nope , that was definitely chrome . 
  they made a big deal about it at the time . 
  ( opera may or may not have had it before chrome , i 've not used it extensively . ), 
  i do n't mean to be a downer , but could we keep spoilers out of the titles ? 
  ( and obviously include a mention that the post contains a spoiler for upcoming episodes . ), 
  i 'm not going to deny that it 's creepy as fuck , and anyone who watches the show just for her ( unless it 's actually for her acting or something , i guess ... ) is creepy as fuck . 
  that said , 16 is at or above the age of consent in most places . 
  just a heads up , this is multiplayer only . 
  most people see things on their front page , not coming to the subreddit specifically , so the custom rss wo n't have any effect . 
  i definitely do that , but with tv shows i mainly do that * after * an episode has aired and ( more importantly ) i 've seen it , to catch up with others ' feedback on the episode . 
  edit : also just realised , it 's a subreddit rule . 
  put in bold on the sidebar no less than twice . 
  i * really * hope that you can share the results of this with us when you 're done !, 
  this is probably the survey i 'm most interested in of all the ones i 've done in a fair while . 
  also , i 'm curious , what 's the difference between the two cases ? 
  ( pm would be preferable to posting it publicly . ), 
  nonsense , it should clearly be youdit . 
  so have i. 
  and if people would have just used rational thought , they would have * known * this was going to be the outcome when youtube changed it .
