  yeah , it 's a pretty damn big spoiler . 
  but it 's also a really old spoiler , which i think is what was intended . 
  probably should 've said `` korra season 1 spoiler '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure they 've mentioned as much in the series ... 
  i 'm not saying whether i agree or not . 
  i 'm just saying that calling the other guy a troll for disagreeing with you is stupid . 
  switzerland has a lot of guns , but the laws around them are actually quite strict compared to the us . 
  i think we have a winner for most ... unique ... / r/brisbane post of 2014 . 
  this is n't a repost complainer bot , it 's a bot that lets you know when a thread has been linked to by another thread . 
  the / r/mmorpg thread original post is actually a link right back to this thread ( i.e. , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1yso0g/upcoming_v018_patchnotes/ ) ) . 
  it 's mainly useful for tracking brigading by the likes of srs and r/bad [ insert profession here ] , but can also be useful for finding out about different conversations on the same topic , like in this case . 
  glad to see that they 're still working on improving the music through different areas . 
  i noticed a few people were complaining about it during the last beta . 
  you can add australia to places it does n't work . 
  thanks for sharing that . 
  it put a massive smile on my face . 
  wait , is falmer the name for the snow elves ? 
  i assumed it was what they became blind and deformed . 
  ( ninjaedit : that 's what [ the elder scrolls wiki says , too ] ( http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/falmer ) . ), 
  hence `` falmer '' , as in fallen mer . 
  ( second edit : '' [ amongst the few remaining snow elf survivors , they prefer the name snow elf over their original name of falmer ] ( http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/snow_elf ) '' . 
  so it kinda goes both ways , although the op is technically correct . ), 
  awesome job on this for those new to tes series . 
  that said , when i read the title , i was actually hoping it would be a glossary of eso-specific terms/mmo terms used in eso . 
  if someone were to do that , i 'm sure it would be much appreciated , too . 
  so if i 'm reading this correctly , the problem is because you get 4c/l by spending $ 30 at woolies , and you get 8c/l by spending $ 30 at woolies and then $ 5 at the petrol station , but you * do n't * get 4c/l if you just buy at the petrol station ? 
  from the r/libertarian thread :, 
   i think anti-bestiality laws are stupid to say that animals ca n't consent so it should be illegal . 
  animals ca n't consent to being eaten and killed but we do both . 
  animals do n't consent to taking a bath , but we have to do it for our cat and dog every month . 
   if you want to fuck your dog or let a horse fuck you than it should be legal . 
  get government out of it . 
  what the fuck is wrong with that guy . 
  can someone explain what exactly is wrong with this version ? 
  and also what the other team he might be interested in giving a social conscience to is . 
  your examples are both wrong , though ... ( as opposed to just sounding awkward . ), 
  you ca n't `` be [ adverb ] '' . 
  you * can * `` be [ adjective ] '' , and so you would say `` be safe '' . 
  oh wow , thanks !, 
  you know , i had heard the term `` justice league of america '' before , but i always thought it was just the name of the justice league in the comics , and that they removed the america part for the tv shows in order to appeal to a wider audience . 
  glad you set that straight . 
  that 's the argument , but it is n't actually true . 
  the best places to look with regards to this are mass killings and suicides . 
  with guns , mass killings are incredibly easy to pull off . 
  without them , they 're nearly impossible . 
  perhaps the most striking example is the sandy hook shooting . 
  26 people died at gunpoint in that event . 
  the same day , in china , a man went on a rampage with a knife . 
  22 injuries including 9 hospitalisations , but not a single death . 
  i saw a great comment a few days ago regarding attempted suicides . 
  it said that there are basically two sorts : those that are opportunistic , brought on by some acute pain such as a recent break up combined with too much drinking ; and those that are caused by a more chronic depression . 
  the former kind , if the suicide attempt is unsuccessful , they are unlikely to attempt it again . 
  it is these kinds where things such as preventing access to guns can be extremely helpful . 
  ( the context in which i actually saw this point was about putting barriers to prevent bridge jumpers , but the same point applies here . ), 
  one final point is regarding common criminals . 
  if gun control is weak , it 's likely that many muggers and petty criminals will have one . 
  especially if you combine this with other people having guns ( but even if you do n't ) , this very easily lead to escalation wherein someone -- be it the criminal , their attempted victim , or a bystander -- ends up shot dead . 
  this , again , is much less likely with a knife . 
  tl ; dr it 's not about preventing premeditated murder , but many other forms of death . 
  ah right . 
  thanks !, 
   if it 's impossible to extract the 126k coins ' given value , does n't that make them kind of worthless , in a sense ? 
  welcome to economics . 
  this particular problem is the same one that exists in other more conventional areas , like just how much money people like bill gates have , or how much a company is worth . 
  they do n't actually have all that value in cash and if they tried to sell it they 'd never get the full amount . 
  it 's just the value at current market rates . 
  not worthless , just worth less . 
  what 's the `` mythology series '' ? 
  i 'm googling and the only result is age of mythology . 
  as a side note , i have to say i 'm surprised that there is n't more of an overlap in the fan base of aoe and civ . 
  i 've always really enjoyed them both , and i guess i just assumed most other people who liked one would like the other , too . 
  his point * was * stupid , but you ca n't just link to the wikipedia page on reductio ad absurdum and say your job is done . 
  your previous example read much more like a straw man than a logical application of an argumentum ad absurdum . 
  try [ this comment thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1yvtf7/this_is_how_you_raise_awareness/cfob9wu?context=3 ) for one example of a better argument . 
  there is indeed . 
  but this example does not belong in either of those categories . 
  cheesy one liners ? 
   most age of ... 
  fans refer to aoe as empires series and aom as mythology series . 
  as a fan of the series , i have never heard this before in my life . 
  it also does n't make sense , considering aom is n't a series , it 's a single game which is a spin-off of the main aoe series .

  what 's that utc ? 
  i must say , i find that really strange . 
  here in aus you 've got zero liability for debit cards regardless of how they are compromised . 
  i 'm not sure if it 's law or not , but a quick look says all the major banks have that policy , as do both visa and mastercard . 
  zero dedicated wallets ftw . 
  phone case that doubles as a wallet . 
  might be worth crossposting to / r/auslaw . 
  but anyway , i just wanted to say i found it interesting that you posted this today , because just yesterday i checked my mail for the first time since november ( was overseas ) and discovered that in december i received a `` notice to prospective juror '' . 
  i also had only been on the electoral roll for under a year . 
  luckily , even though i did n't send in the reply form , so far i have n't been contacted about a penalty ... 
  yeah i figured that if they ever actually tried to fine me it 'd be a simple matter of showing them stamps in my passport or whatever , but seeing as they have n't done that yet , i doubt it 's going to be a problem . 
  i would actually really * like * to do jury duty . 
  i reckon it 'd be a great experience . 
  so if we could swap , i 'd totally be up for it . 
  does n't work like that , unfortunately . 
  australia actually has an 18 + rating now .
