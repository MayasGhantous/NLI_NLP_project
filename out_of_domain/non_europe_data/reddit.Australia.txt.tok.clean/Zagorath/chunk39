  you need to export audio ( which is wma or aac , depending on your os ) , and then convert to mp3 with something like audacity . 
  try to think of it this way : it 's not that people necessarily hate new jersey , but it 's that they love canada . 
  may not be true , but had i found this quiz i would have answered new jersey just because it 's a single state compared to an entire country . 
  i know little about canada , and even less about new jersey , but for me that 'd be enough reason . 
  pretty sure it 's the former . 
  the fact he says `` no transitional fossils have ever been found '' , which is a complete falsehood , makes me think he 's parodying what fundies would say . 
  i love how people always compare it to gravity . 
  i 'm no scientist , but my understanding is that we have a better knowledge of how evolution works than how gravity works . 
  ( please correct me if i 'm wrong . ), 
   it means facts , which you ca n't disbelieve * if you have an ounce of reason in your body *, 
  ftfy, 
  evolution ** is ** true . 
  what we do n't know are the exact specifics of why it happens/what causes it . 
  the fundamental idea that species change to be better adapted is law . 
  i post australia as a counter-example, 
  what i was saying is that there are many negatives to australia . 
  that 's why , despite a small population , it 's a counter-example . 
  to be fair , it 's not a horrible place . 
  i 'd much prefer it over india or china , but it has some serious problems . 
  for one , it 's crazy expensive even despite the strong ( aussie ) dollar . 
  our political debate is often on a level not too far above that of the us . 
  social security is pretty good , but no where near scandinavian levels -- same with our education system ( which , annoyingly , varies from state to state ) . 
  i 'm not quite sure how it relates to the economic theory ( principal ? ), 
  of negative externalities , but i definitely agree very strongly with the rest of your comment . 
  most likely , yes . 
  could you explain exactly what 's wrong with this picture ? 
  ( the original , i mean . ), 
  i somehow just do n't get it ... 
  wow , thanks for that good explanation . 
  and yes , it 's crazy , but that 's why we love it . 
  right , what i was referring to is just the question of some of the exact mechanics of how it works . 
  tbh i do n't understand the differences of them myself , all i know is that there are different theories, 
  that 's probably why i did n't communicate it well : i did n't understand it fully myself . 
  yeah , i know , but how does the picture imply a problem ? 
  it does n't ( seem to ) show the end of the page . 
  i agree . 
  all of these points are relevant , but i think nick names and other cultures ( particularly asians ) who have different naming conventions , as well as searchability ( there are a whole heap of john smiths , but only one js2981 ) are the most important reasons , imo . 
  yeah you 're right . 
  australia usually hangs within the top 5 of hdi . 
  i suppose i was talking about some less measurable -- but not only that , less important -- factors . 
  i can kinda see how it 'd be a negative externality of consumption . 
  i 'd still say calling it such is somewhat dubious . 
  ah fair enough , then . 
  good call . 
  yeah , if he 's not korean you need to substitute the elder scrolls . 
  second paragraph there is incredibly potent . 
   do n't become her doormat in the process, 
  by the way , what was your answer to the first paragraph ? 
   what was i thinking, 
  especially since it 's in the title and url . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure it 's a quick cooking over a metal grill or plate . 
  whether heated by charcoal , gas , or something else is n't particularly relevant . 
  clearly we 're using different definitions . 
  barbeques have always been a quick way of cooking meat , in the definitions that i 've used . 
  i assume you 're using fahrenheit when you say less than 350 degrees , so perhaps the us definition of barbeque is different to the one used in the rest of the world ? 
  edit : [ in british usage , barbecuing refers to a fast cooking process directly over high heat , while grilling refers to cooking under a source of direct , high heat -- known in the us and canada as broiling . 
  in us english usage , however , grilling refers to a fast process over high heat , while barbecuing refers to a slow process using indirect heat and/or hot smoke \\ ( very similar to some forms of roasting \\ ) . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbecue#styles ), 
  edit2 : this ( edit3 : what they say of uk barbequing ) fits with what i know of barbequeing in australia , and barbeque is fairly typically an aussie cuisine . 
  turns out it 's a difference in vocabularies . 
  i point you to the [ comment i replied to fingawkward with ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/x0z93/seriously_vegans_im_a_rapingslave_owning_nazi/c5ibiwf ), 
  and my ti-84 probably has less computing power , and still cost more than , the entire apollo 11 mission did . 
  then does n't that mean it was on the same side as it is now , but has undergone a complete orbit since then ? 
  the fact that you had to repeat it 5 times makes me think you may have ocd . 
  [ comment about how chrome is so much better ], 
  my mum insists on using it in every case , even when word would be more appropriate . 
  he does n't necessarily mean subscriber to / r/atheism , he means a subscriber to the infantile hivemind . 
  that means you agree with the infantile opinions that are stereotypical of / r/atheism . 
  huh , that 's very interesting . 
  by the way , as a deist , what are your views on religion and specifically the bible ? 
  if you do n't believe in an interventionist god , was your reason for reading the bible purely out of interest ? 
  til the matrix is a metaphor for religion . 
  of those mentioned , kfc . 
  however , i far prefer aussie fast-food chain red rooster . 
  ( edit : so i answered kfc , since it said of these , and only say other if you never eat at any of these ) also , side-note , wendy 's in australia is an icecream store , completely unrelated ( at least afaik ) to the us one . 
  also , i answered in cm and kg , since i do n't know us units , sorry about that . 
  ( edit : but not really ), 
  and for the lazy that want the alt text . 
   my decal set has no adults , just a sea of hundreds of the little girl figures closing in around a single cat . 
  it 's a feature , except when you 're playing single player . 
  and the inability to choose where you install a game is just ** horrible ** . 
  but what if one wanted certain games , or better yet steam itself , on the ssd , with most of the games on another drive ? 
  that 's not my situation , but it is one i could understand . 
  mine is this : i have two partitions of around 70 gb from when i bought my computer . 
  for some reason it 's a common practise in vietnam to split them like that . 
  i did n't think it would be a problem at the time ( i did n't game all that much , and did n't use steam at all then ) , so i did n't fix it then , and by the time it was a problem i had too much stuff sprawled over both partitions to fix it . 
  my partitions are currently both near full , so i delete and move things as necessary . 
  steam not allowing me to choose which drive a game installs on is a big problem . 
  in general , it 's a really simple feature that they have no excuse for not implementing . 
  sorry for late reply , my connection died right before i was gon na post and i 've been away since . 
  what grade did you end up getting ? 
  my only advise ? 
  fuck it . 
  the marking is completely arbitrary . 
  i spent a heap of effort on my ee , got a lot of feedback from my supervisor , did good referencing , went through the grading criteria point-for-point , and ended up with a b. 
  most likely just because i got a marker who knew nothing about the topic i chose . 
  my ee was the only part of my entire ib results i 'm disappointed with , and unfortunately i 'll never even know why . 
  ( damn ibo does n't give even the slightest detail in feedback . ), 
  edit : / rant , and sorry for the lack of good feedback . 
  ah , fair enough .
