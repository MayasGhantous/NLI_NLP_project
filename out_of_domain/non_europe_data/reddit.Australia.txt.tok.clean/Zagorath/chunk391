  i think the expression has an implied `` that you have '' , as in :, 
  it 's a sight [ that you have ] to see . 
  or words to that effect . 
  i 'm much the same . 
  i know the exact dates of my immediate family ( parents , sibling ) , and the exact dates of a few people with interesting birthdays ( born on new year 's , christmas , anzac day , etc. 
  ) , but most people i have only a vague idea of where in the year it falls . 
  you 're not actually abbrevi8 , are you ? 
  if you still like the idea of an mmo but do n't like all the grind that many games ( including wow ) have , you should take a look at elder scrolls online . 
  if you can grab a beta key for this coming weekend ( [ this might be a place to look ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1ywti7/beta_key_giveaway_megathead/ ) ) you can try it out for free this weekend . 
  it 's heaps of fun and i know i did n't feel any grind during the last beta weekend . 
  damn , how 'd that happen ? 
  just in / r/brisbane , i assume ? 
  edit : just tried going to / u/abbrevi8 ... guess i assumed wrong ... 
  i have to agree with you . 
  before the movie came out people were complaining about the choice of casting , and i was just like ... i do n't care if he did n't pick actors who have races the same as what the tv show 's characters look like , i just want people who are good actors that can do a good job of getting the personality across . 
  of course , that did n't happen , so we got the worst of both worlds , but still , i do n't think complaining about the race of characters is the best approach when there 's so much more to complain about . 
  damn that 's harsh ... 
  if they 're determined to get a tattoo , perhaps . 
  but if , like the above case , it was a drunken mistake , then people like / u/clinthammer 's acquaintance save them from the mistake . 
  the removable battery thing seems to me like people making an issue out of something that is n't an issue . 
  if you 're carrying an extra battery around anyway , why not just make it an external one ? 
  just as easy . 
  plus , by not needing to have the mechanism for swapping out the battery , you get to have a first battery that 's larger . 
  but the lack of removable * storage * is definitely a big issue , especially if you do n't have unlimited data and reliable high speed connections , which rules out most of the world , and even a huge number of people in developed countries . 
  thankfully , google realised this problem and is offering a 32 gb option with the nexus 5 , compared to 16 gb being the maximum for the nexus 4 , but it 's still not nearly as good as if they had an sd slot . 
  i 'm the same . 
  i 'd call this either a jumper or a hoodie , though hoodie would be more specific . 
  seriously , people have this image of romeo and juliet being the ultimate image of what love is/should be . 
  but that is * so * not what it 's actually about . 
  i definitely would n't put them into two distinct categories . 
  some of the best art , in my opinion , does a great job of both being nice and making you think . 
  i 'm not big on visual art , so my examples will be music , but i would see something like charles ives ' '' [ the unanswered question ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbarujbrrj0 ) '' as a great example of \u00e6sthetically pleasing and something that makes you think , if you 're willing to . 
  something like john cage 's 4:33 , on the other hand , is definitely a very thoughtful piece ( again , if you 're willing to let it be ) , but is pretty much the epitome of art that is n't `` good '' in an \u00e6sthetic way . 
  [ a mozart concerto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2onnugi3ylu ) is a good example of something \u00e6sthetically pleasing but with little in the way of deeper meaning or thought-provokingness , for lack of a better term . 
  you know how people say carrots give you good eyesight ? 
  that was a myth perpetuated by the raf to cover up the fact that they had invented radar . 
  it should work if you use a proxy , but be warned that this is against the tos and if they notice you 've done it your account could be banned . 
  if possible , see if you can find someone actually in the us ( or any country where there is n't a specific price -- in those countries it defaults to us price ) and get them to buy it for you . 
  the number 15 ? 
  i 'm guessing he 's claiming that tall people will tell you they 're tall on the internet or something ? 
  i 'm really not sure ... 
  i ca n't comment directly from personal experience ( i use android and google maps ) , but i had some relatives drive to where i am just a few days ago . 
  they 're were using an iphone , and they 're not very techy , so i imagine they were using apple maps , and they made a comment about how the maps took them a bad way . 
  this is in the third largest city in australia , near the centre of the city . 
  the only part of that first paragraph that i would really agree with was that cyrodiil is a lag-fest . 
  it was really bad . 
  but i found far fewer quests that i could n't complete this time compared to last time , and i probably had slightly less issues with needing to / reloadui than last time , though only slightly . 
  and that experience in my case is despite having a fairly poor connection . 
  [ indeed ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/9deea3c3ea73e2c9b85e275cea9343cf/tumblr_mr7tj6u1fx1qdate4o1_r1_250.gif ), 
  but part of the point is that we 're assuming google maps would direct you to a better route . 
  now , i do n't actually * know * that it would , because i 've not ever used apple 's one and done side-by-side tests , but * if * it does , then regardless of the reasons , that 's a point against apple 's navigation system . 
  the good thing is you do n't really need to use them incorrectly . 
  most people would , i feel , understand what you meant if you said `` typeface '' , and would mentally translate that to what they understand as a `` font '' . 
  76 % of people will believe any statement you make if you give them some stats . 
  oh that 's interesting . 
  i 'm not a designer , but i 've seen the word written in a designing context , and i mentally pronounced it as `` leeding '' ( the same as i would in the sense of one person `` leading '' another ) . 
  how should it be pronounced ? 
  what other meanings/names does the @ symbol have ? 
  no you would n't . 
  you 'd sound like a dick if you corrected someone else using it `` wrong '' , but if you used it correctly yourself most people would understand you . 
  no he used the right word . 
  it 's not just people who are attempting to describe the language , but people ( i noticed it was an epidemic during my short time at / r/badlinguistics ) actively arguing against others trying to correct bad usage . 
  now , this case really is n't such a bad one , but something like the phrase `` could care less '' is just awful . 
  it makes no sense from a logical perspective , it sounds bad , and it 's not in any way easier than the correct phrase . 
  there is quite literally ( and i mean literally in its original sense , not in the colloquial usage ) no reason to say `` could care less '' . 
  and yet you 'll see people who defend this for no reason other than `` language changes and you have to deal with it '' . 
  i 'm sorry , but no . 
  i do n't care if you 're a self-described linguist , or even if you have a degree in the field . 
  you can described how people use words all you want , but that does n't mean you have the right to say that their usage is correct . 
  ( using `` you '' here in the impersonal sense . ), 
  oh do n't get me wrong , i have nothing against descriptivism . 
  in fact i think it 's an incredibly useful area of knowledge , and it 's one that i actually think is really interesting , although i have n't gone into much depth with it . 
  * i just do n't think it is necessarily in opposition to prescriptivism in the way i see many linguists seem to believe * . 
  descriptivism exists to describe how people are currently using words . 
  but there 's no reason that other people ( or even the same people ) ca n't also tell people that , in some situations , the way that they are using language is detrimental to conversation . 
  for what it 's worth , i totally get that many dialects/ethnolects/sociolects etc. 
  have their own usage and phrases and i 'm totally fine with that . 
  i 'm not going to correct someone for saying `` y' all '' or `` ai n't '' , or using double negatives in situations where it is n't causing ambiguity . 
  it does n't mean i * like * those words and phrases , but i can accept their usage as normal and natural , and not in any way `` wrong '' . 
  edit : [ this guy 's comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1zeu6g/til_the_word_font_actually_only_refers_to_things/cft9bkq ) does an awesome job of expressing what i was trying to say . 
   especially since 1-0 is taken up by spells, 
  the biggest problem in my opinion is that that 's not true . 
  only 1-5 are taken up by spells , and you ca n't have more than that . 
  i really wish we had more flexibility and were able to have 10 spells set to all the number keys . 
  that said , i do n't think it 's necessarily a bad design that we * are n't * able to do that . 
  deliberate restrictions can be a very good thing . 
   whatever that random number after the x is nowadays, 
  how is it random ? 
  it increments by 1 each time they do a major release . 
  makes a lot more sense than windows 8.1 , which is actually version 6.3 . 
  except he 's correct . 
  mavericks is n't supported on really old machines . 
  granted , the most recent that is * not * supported is the 2009 mbp 13 inch , so it 's not like they 're preventing computers less than 5 years old from upgrading . 
  [ official support page ] ( http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5842 ) . 
  i found it out from the zone chat . 
  no , that makes perfect sense . 
  very well said . 
  samoa is actually way * ahead * of the us . 
  they switched to being just east of the international date line to just west of it in december 2011 . 
  from utc-11 to utc +13 .
