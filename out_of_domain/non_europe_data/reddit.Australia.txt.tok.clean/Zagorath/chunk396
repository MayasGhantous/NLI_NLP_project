  i just did it this way to emphasise the point i was making -- the idea of not showing anything if the savings are less than $ 10 is the key part of the argument , so i wrote the code so that visually that 's what stands out . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever seen it in australia , only when i was overseas ... 
  did n't seem like it to me . 
  sure , only americans use terms like sophmore and junior , but that 's pretty easy to translate into a year number for someone doing uni elsewhere . 
  none of the other questions seemed particularly geared towards americans . 
  i put `` not american '' in the extra comments box at the end , just to be safe . 
  i 'd do bol\u00e9ro to annoy * everybody * !, 
  ( especially the snare . ), 
  if you had it all year it would make a lot more sense . 
  but i 've got a bunch of reasons to be against it . 
  a lot of them are emotional/subjective , but there 's one in particular that makes me think it should absolutely never be used anywhere ( unless it were done all year round , as you suggest ) . 
  in the days after the switch , ** there 's a significant spike in suicide rates and heart problems ** . 
  the more emotional ones are that to me it just does n't make sense . 
  people who argue for it say that they want more daylight . 
  but i do n't understand this . 
  they 're getting more daylight * in the time when there 's already much more daylight than the time they do n't have it * . 
  it would make some more sense if it were a winter-only thing , because in winter there 's less daylight . 
  but in summer , in places that have dst , it can be up to 8pm before the light is completely gone * even without dst being factored in * . 
  plus , as far as i 'm concerned , if a significant number of people would prefer to work earlier and have it still be light when they finish , then those people could simply work earlier hours . 
  8 -- 4 instead of 9 -- 5 . 
  if enough people wanted this ( including managers and higher ) then it could happen . 
  the last one is that it helps keep international ( and intranational in some cases , for example some states in australia use it and some do n't ) communication much smoother without having daylight saving . 
  it 's hard enough working out when something is happening in america ( since people always refuse to give time in utc , or even to state what offset they are using ) , and what time that corresponds to where i am , but then i ca n't even just learn a time difference , i 've got to work out when they start using dst . 
  if i lived somewhere that also has dst ( if i moved just 100 km south that would be the case ) i 'd have to factor that in as well . 
  of course , the biggest of these problems -- the suicide spike and international communication -- would go away if it was all year round . 
  i would n't have much of a problem with that being the case . 
  fun fact , during wwii , england moved to dst all year round , and added one * more * hour on during summer . 
  are you sure ? 
  according to that , neutrinos are on the order of 10 ^ -24 , and the observable universe is on the order of 10 ^ 26-ish . 
  would n't that make the size difference only between 100 and 1,000 times ? 
  in a way it 's similar , though python 's syntax is much , much easier . 
  it 's an incredibly human-readable language compared to something like c++ or java . 
  python 's really convenient because there 's a * huge * amount of online resources for learning it . 
  [ coursera ] ( https://www.coursera.org/ ) has at least two courses that it regularly runs that use python . 
  [ codecademy ] ( http://www.codecademy.com/ ) has lessons in python . 
  your c++ knowledge probably wo n't help too much , except for the use of object oriented design styles , which can be useful . 
  but python is easy to pick up anyway . 
  damn , where are you that someone having 300 gb is bad ? 
  in australia having 200 gb is a pretty good package . 
  unlimited is easy to find , but generally quite expensive . 
  thankfully , i think they just throttle you ( pretty badly ) when you reach the limit , rather than charging you obscene rates . 
  it 's not an enormous problem , but it is statistically significant . 
  something like 6 % or so . 
  the thing about winter is that that 's the time when dst already * is n't * in effect . 
  with the current system you do n't get extra daylight hours in winter , you get them in summer . 
  living far north means that in summer you probably already experience something like the extreme i noted before . 
  i 'm guessing it 's still light at 9:00 pm , which means it would be light at 8 without dst . 
  as i said , if they moved to dst * all year round * , that would n't be a problem . 
  you 'd get your extra daylight , communication would n't be a problem , and there would n't be any fluctuation in suicides or heart attacks . 
  however , even in that case , i just do n't see it as necessary . 
  if work times normally start at 7 -- 8 in germany , why could n't it be 6 -- 7 and do away with daylight saving ? 
  as a side note , it might be less of a problem in germany than it is in australia , but you still communicate with america so it 's still somewhat of an issue ( especially on the internet ) . 
  i could be wrong , but i think that 's a gold feature .

  nsfw tags can be useful because you can flick a switch to automatically not even have them show up in your feed . 
  i actually [ just had a conversation on this same topic ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/1zxmcv/this_will_be_the_first_year_im_thankful_for/cfy7dms?context=3 ) , so i 'll copy and paste my initial response , before providing a brief more direct answer to your op .

  now , in your op you state that it makes sunlight hours line up better . 
  if it was moving an hour forward during the * winter * this would be true , but it does the exact opposite . 
  it shifts it forward in the * summer * , the exact time when you 're already getting more light . 
  so that makes no sense . 
  the electricity thing is flat out wrong . 
  there are various sources you can point to that will say it causes more or less electricity to be used , but all of them agree that the * amount * of change in electricity usage is minimal . 
  less than 1 % .

  odd because that metaphor sounds exactly like what one might expect from hitchiker 's guide or monty python . 
  nah sorry mate , but you 're going to have to realise that different people find different things funny , and in this particular case , while your opinion is perfectly valid , it is vastly in the minority .

  not your fault , of course , especially since you probably had n't seen the original . 
  they also have * by far * the best chips of any of the major fast food franchises . 
  for the lazy :, 
   the pc/mac control scheme is optimized for keyboard and mouse , though any of a number of commercially available emulators will allow players to use a controller . 
  i would agree with enjoying dawnguard . 
  i have to say , serena has to be one of my absolute favourite characters in any game . 
  she seemed like she had so much depth to her character . 
  some of the other story stuff in that dlc was fantastic too , especially regarding the falmer ( i wo n't say any more though for fear of spoilers ) . 
  it 's an absolute must-get , but not necessarily before you 've finished the main game .
