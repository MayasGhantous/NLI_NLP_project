  i prefer the term `` bacronym '' . 
  sounds cooler . 
  all acronyms are initialisms , but not all initialisms are acronyms . 
  i really feel for you germans . 
  you guys have some of the absolute worst laws surrounding the internet . 
  between this , the amount of blocked youtube videos , and things like what went on with google 's streetview , it really makes me wonder what your government is thinking . 
  ( still , as an australian , we 're like brothers as far as gaming censorship goes ... ), 
  not on my campaign they were n't ( assuming you 're talking about the last beta weekend ) . 
  the dominion was absolutely owning the map , with the pact having a small bit of land , and the covenant was utterly destroyed . 
  when is the next beta event ? 
  i would n't call it super short , but it certainly was super easy and kinda interesting . 
  please share the results when you 're done with them !, 
  why did you make a new account ? 
  i do n't know for sure , but that 's probably against the terms of service , so if they notice you 've done that , that could be why the account was locked . 
  as in starting on the 14th ? 
  okay cool thanks . 
  i thought it was , but the comment about `` 2 weeks '' confused me a little . 
  cheers . 
   it is ~ 22km without heading into the forest , which takes about 50-60min depending how energetic i 'm feeling, 
  from [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1zoqnw/my_commute_and_why_i_prefer_to_do_it_on_my_mtb/ ) thread, 
  if she 's 21 now , then when the show started she could n't have been any less than like 19 . 
  she has a young face , that 's how she can get away with portraying a young character . 
  yet more pedantry again :, 
  there 's a difference between the genre of `` classical music '' and the `` classical era '' . 
  the latter is what you described , but the former is what most people are referring to when they say `` classical music '' , and it spans at * least * everything from the beginning of the baroque period until the end of the romantic ( more formally known as the common practice period ) , and could arguably also consist of some 20th century or pre-baroque music . 
  what was described in this post is n't quite like an early form of rap battles . 
  this is sight reading : reading music that others have written and playing it for the first time with only a minimal amount of practice time . 
  but there was something very similar to a `` rap battle '' that did happen quite often back in the baroque era . 
  they had improvisation competitions , where two keyboardists would improvise music ( usually based on a well-known theme ) competing against each other . 
  and beethoven took that challenge and used a single theme in all * four * movements of the symphony !, 
  as a huge fan of beethoven 's music , i have to say , i really have n't enjoyed films about him very much . 
  they usually just are n't all that interesting , despite the very interesting life he had . 
  the best i 've found was probably [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3pzpkd5aca ) , which focuses not so much on his life as on one specific event/piece . 
  well admittedly it 's only been out for a day , but so far it 's got a whopping 1 -- 5 installs !, 
  one thing that may affect results that you have n't taken into account : what subjects someone is taking/degree they are doing . 
  harder subjects may have lower grade boundaries . 
  for example , i know hl maths in ib gives 7s ( the top grade ) for something like 75 % , while sl maths requires 85 % . 
  so someone who is doing a harder subject is likely to report a `` lower achievement '' even if the difficulty of their work is higher . 
  that video is private , just so you know . 
  holy shit . 
  this is exactly the system i 've been promoting for a while . 
  i had no idea tasmania already used it !, 
  [ here 's john cleese ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) explaining the system . 
  physics hl + maths hl . 
  it was hell , man . 
  when i was on holiday in europe once i met a couple from somewhere in the middle east who mentioned , upon hearing that i was australian , that they had always really wanted to travel to australia . 
  considering we were in austria at the time , i could n't help but wonder if they had ended up there accidentally ... 
  it 's a little known fact about australia that the entire country is actually in one giant ring network . 
  on the plus side , connection speeds are really fast . 
  on the down side , when dazza turns his computer off over night , the entire country goes offline . 
  why is that file called china_map . jpg ? 
  lucas probably did make a mistake with it . 
  but that 's the doyalist explanation of it . 
  the watsonian explanation is the one that makes for interesting debate . 
  personally i think the explanation that it 's just because the character of han solo was n't all that bright and was just trying to show off makes perfect sense . 
  georgia the country or georgia the us state ? 
  simple , use all three methods for a 2.4 * 10 ^ ( -4 ) % failure rate . 
  ( sorry if i spelled that wrong , it 's been a while since i lived in korea ... ), 
  to be fair , os x was such a radical departure from previous versions of mac os , and it does postdate ( is that a word ? ), 
  windows , which has for the most part been fairly incremental updates relatively speaking . 
  not to say that os x actually took specific ideas from windows , of course . 
  it was largely based on the technology developed at next ( which was itself a unix-like operating system ) . 
  there was n't really much point to this comment other than to provide some extra random bits of information for anyone reading this . 
  i have the korean keyboard layout installed on my computer . 
  you can install it just by going into your keyboard layout settings . 
  i do n't have the korean keyboard layout memorised , so i also use an onscreen keyboard to help me type . 
  [ screenshot ] ( http://imgur.com/dyystey ) ( this screenshot is in os x , but i 've done all the same things apart from having the custom programmer dvorak on windows , too . 
  it 's really easy . ), 
  oh wait , so their senate is n't based on stv ? 
  glad you enjoyed it !, 
  i pretty much stumbled across it the same way you did , it was mentioned in the comments on a / r/classicalmusic thread , and i was really glad i stopped to watch it . 
  ah right . 
  that 's not quite how i 'd like to see federal politics work , then . 
  ideally i 'd like the underlying senate system to remain as-is ( only fixing the actual voting mechanism : the above-the-line/belowe-the-line stuff ) , while merging multiple hor electorates into groups of 4 -- 6 electing 4 -- 6 members using stv . 
  removing the above-the-line voting and not requiring numbering of the whole ballot is an absolutely brilliant feature , though . 
  i 'm just curious , i 've just looked it up on wikipedia and apparently your upper house has 12/15 members as independents . 
  that 's amazing to me , i just wonder how well that works , and also which way in general the house leans . 
  any plans to take this international ? 
  it seems to only be available in the us at the moment , do you plan/hope to make it available in places like australia or the uk any time soon ? 
  i actually got paid to play this once . 
  it was used as part of a psychology experiment in team dynamics . 
  not cross platform though . 
  exactly , that 's why / u/blackout24 's comment, 
   apple intentionally cripples the graphics stack for that platform, 
  was just bullshit . 
  heaps of games do . 
  all the valve games are fine , too , as are basically all games that are released for os x that are n't just wine wrappers or similarly bad ports ( i 'm looking at you , the witcher ) . 
  most recently i 've had an incredible experience with elder scrolls online working absolutely perfectly on os x. 
  is this a reference i 'm not understanding ? 
  atlantian master race checking in !, 
  nah but i liked playing all of them . 
  norse and egyptian were some of my favourites , though . 
  i think [ this one ] ( http://aom.heavengames.com/downloads/showfile.php?fileid=6557 ) was my favourite . 
  i have n't played in ages , and in a previous thread about aom i decided to go and see if i could find it again . 
  from the description this seems like the right one . 
  mine was civ ii : test of time . 
  the 1999 remake of the original civ ii with all the same gameplay , but better graphics and a few more gameplay modes including sci fi and fantasy ( the latter of which was based on north mythology ) . 
  my absolute favourite was the `` extended original '' game mode , where after building the spaceship instead of winning , you get to actually play on alpha centauri and earth simultaneously . 
  i 'm sorry to say this , but it * really * has n't stood the test of time . 
  i 've been playing through it for the first time recently , and the gameplay is just * awful * .
