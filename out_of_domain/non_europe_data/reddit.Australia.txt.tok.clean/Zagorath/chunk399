  i think i remember reading in another thread that in the us they 're used for marijuana dispensaries ? 
  in australia ( or at least in queensland ) it 's a well-known chain of vets . 
  if nothing else , this would be great for sleep and exercise . 
  freeze time , go and sleep for like 10 hours , wake up , go for a run , unfreeze time , go about the rest of your day , and repeat . 
  i learned how to convert binary into ascii letters a while ago just for a laugh . 
  using base 2 is actually really easy , if a bit tedious . 
  two 's compliment is really easy . 
  if the msb is 0 , read it just like you would unsigned . 
  if it 's 1 , subtract one and flip all the bits , and then read it as unsigned . 
  plus it makes calculations for addition and subtraction so damn convenient . 
  that would make them the best child services officer ever . 
  that would have been an interesting twist on animorphs . 
  australia is n't * quite * as bad as the us . 
  our greens party has a substantial representation in the senate especially , and many other minor parties get an amount of votes that 's not to be laughed at , even if they do n't win any seats . 
  but as far as actually forming government goes , yeah , it 's a complete two party system . 
  yeah that 's the thing . 
  labor was n't * actually * a shit show . 
  they had some issues , but as far as actual policy went they were incredibly successful . 
  the media ( largely owned by right wing american rupert murdoch ) just did a much better job of portraying labor as being in complete turmoil . 
  labor 's biggest * real * problem was that they were poor at communicating what they were doing . 
  the term ` liberal ' has traditionally -- outside of america , at least -- been more of an economic one than a social one . 
  referring to more right-wing type economic policies like lower taxes and lower government spending , versus left-wing economics which generally consist of higher taxes but higher government spending . 
  it 's supposed to , and in a well-educated populace ( well-educated as far as politics goes , anyway ) that would be the case . 
  unfortunately , many australians do n't fully understand how our electoral system works , so you get a bit of a problem there . 
  another big part of it is that single-winner preferential systems like av ( used in australia 's house of representatives ) have a tendency to devolve to a two-party system as far as winners are concerned . 
  the big advantage is that you can still vote for a smaller party , and know that even though they wo n't win , your vote will be passed down to the major party you most agree with . 
  it would be better replaced with a system like stv ( which we already use in our senate ) , that elects multiple winners per electorate , and results in a more proportional outcome . 
  [ john cleese ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) explains how this could work in britain 's house of commons , but it could work identically in canada 's house of commons or america 's or australia 's house of reps. 
  you might not like it , but australia , and more than likely whatever country you are from , has signed the universal declaration of human rights and agreed that it * is * a good representation of what human rights are . 
  so in this case , yes , a un council * does * decide those standards . 
  good question . 
  i have n't got a clue why , but we do . 
  just guessing here , maybe it 's something to do with not being confused for the british labour party ? 
  since you 're going back to the polls soon , i wonder if [ you 've seen this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtqrfiev8gs ) already ? 
  i really hope wa has the sense to give ludlum his seat back this april , he 's seriously the best thing going in australian politics at the moment ... 
  here are just a few points that i , and most young educated people ( i assume that 's what you 're referring to when you say ` my demographic seems to think that labor is `` left wing '' ' ) , think make labor a better party than the coalition :, 
  * nbn, 
  * emissions trading scheme, 
  * * slightly * less shitty with respect to asylum seekers, 
  * considering marriage equality, 
  * not dramatically cutting csiro, 
  * not considering privatising hecs debt, 
  none of these would cause me to believe that the coalition is further left than labor . 
  now , on nearly every issue here i 'd either prefer greens policy or find them equal , but on not a single issue do i find the coalition is more left than labor . 
  oh yeah , and the cia whitlam thing is a conspiracy theory . 
  nothing more . 
  someone made a clever comment somewhere about how incredible it is that he can be delivering a speech to an empty senate room that will be watched by hundreds of thousands of people from their homes . 
  i thought it was quite touching . 
  [ nope ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rupert_murdoch ), 
   citizenship : united states, 
  he renounced his australian citizenship a long time ago . 
   the incumbent labour party were utterly fucking incompetent, 
  a popular meme , but not actually true . 
  labor was n't * actually * a shit show . 
  they had some issues , but as far as actual policy went they were incredibly successful . 
  the media ( largely owned by right wing american rupert murdoch ) just did a much better job of portraying labor as being in complete turmoil . 
  labor 's biggest * real * problem was that they were poor at communicating what they were doing . 
  that 's a problem in the senate , but is n't really an issue in the reps , which is where the pm generally comes from . 
  australia has preferential voting . 
  you have to reach 50 % of the vote in order to win your seat . 
  it 's actually not stagnation . 
  hung parliaments , despite the very popular myth , actually tend to do great jobs of getting stuff through . 
  look at much of europe , or even look at gillard 's time as pm . 
  a lot of really big stuff got through then . 
  they were just shit at communicating it . 
  a spoiler is a spoiler . 
  anything that spoils the plot for someone who has n't seen/read it yet is a spoiler . 
  now , that does n't necessarily mean it 's not unreasonable to spoil things sometimes . 
  the ending to planet of the apes is a * massive * spoiler , but it 's also so culturally engrained now that it 's perfectly acceptable to talk about it assuming that people know it . 
  but it 's still a spoiler , and if you met someone who told you they had n't seen it and did n't know the ending , and you came out and told them how it ends , that 'd be a dick move . 
  if you accidentally mentioned it because you did n't know they did n't know the ending , well that 's totally fine . 
  [ somewhat relevant ] ( http://dayssincetonyabbottwasonqanda.neocities.org/ ) . 
  after i read your first sentence i thought you were an australian making a joke about townsville . 
  because it 's a common joke in australia that anywhere that is n't one of the top 8 or so cities ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_australia_by_population ) is a tiny town full of bogans . 
  ^ ^ ^ jokes ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ funny ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ explain ^ ^ ^ them ... 
  ** sex ** . 
  he 's talking about sex . 
  i doubt it will be , but i also really hope it is . 
  parties should be allowed to put their own members in their preferred order , and the voter can just put a single number for that party . 
  but no distribution would go on beyond that party 's members . 
  plus , it 'd be nice to not have mandatory preferencing . 
  that way , one could , for example , vote [ 1 ] pirate party , [ 2 ] greens , [ 3 ] labor , and just stop there . 
  three numbers , as opposed to 82 or more , and you still get the benefits of the preferential system . 
  the big difference is that in canada , like the us or the uk , voting for a minor party actually * is * a wasted vote . 
  in australia we have preferences which mean that you can vote [ 1 ] for a minor party , but still know that eventually your vote will make its way to a major party anyway . 
  i kinda agree , but i do wonder what you would consider a better alternative . 
  you need * something * to decide which team is on top in the event that two teams are tied in the overall ladder . 
  my preferred football code , the nrl ( rugby league ) , as well as the afl ( aussie rules football ) both use point margins . 
  if one team won one game 20 -- 0 and lost the other 12 -- 14 , it has an aggregate margin of 18 , while the other team has -18 . 
  another system that i have seen used in school-age kids tournaments for soccer is number of corners awarded . 
  the idea being that if you were awarded a lot of corners , you must have been ahead in possession and `` in control '' of the game , even if you were unable to convert it to points all the time . 
  personally , i think that 's a kinda hacky way of doing it , but i 've seen it done , so i thought it worth mentioning . 
  tl ; dr , i agree , that system does n't seem the better one , but you need * something * to decide who wins in the event of a draw . 
  what would you prefer to replace the away goals rule with ? 
  not exactly . 
  by voting [ 1 ] for another party it shows them support and helps them get funding to run again in the future . 
  the biggest problem with extra time is that it , well , takes extra time . 
  as far as broadcasting etc. 
  goes , it creates further complications . 
  the australian sports do away with extra time for regular matches , but put them back in during finals etc.
