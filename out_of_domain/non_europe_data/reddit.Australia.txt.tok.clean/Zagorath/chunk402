  as someone more familiar with hotter areas , it 's at about 6 -- 8 \u02da that `` the pain starts '' . 
  especially if it 's windy . 
  i did n't even know we ever had those ... 
  i really like the symbolism of that . 
  the aborigine on one side , with a white man boat ( possibly cook arriving in botany bay ? ), 
  on the other . 
  okay i know it 's weird , but i * thought * that looked rather like a coles . 
  was n't sure enough to have said anything until i knew you were australian already . 
   i 'm learning the language now, 
  oh god man , good luck with that . 
  i lived there for nearly 6 years and i can still barely scrape together a few sentences . 
  awesome place , though . 
  i 've seen people ( usually younger than about 14 , but not always ) go shirtless . 
  they 're always complete bogans , but still ... 
  oh god that experience is just the best ( and worst ) !, 
  [ bogans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bogan ) . 
  if you 're familiar with the uk term `` chav '' , that 's not too bad a substitute . 
  i 've seen the terms `` redneck '' and `` white trash '' from the us also used from time to time as supposedly similar terms . 
  as far as i know , yes . 
  unfortunately voices is one of the major areas that sibelius is really awkward with ( another being tuplets ) . 
  i find [ this tool ] ( http://www.freemaptools.com/tunnel-to-other-side-of-the-earth.htm ) much more useful for finding the antipode of a point . 
  wage ranges for the industry seems like an awkward idea . 
  it 's in pounds , so you 're clearly expecting it to be uk-based . 
  but the thing is , even if people convert the amounts to their local currency , wage rates in different countries are different . 
  someone from , say , viet nam might put # 12,000 -- # 18,000 and think that 's actually a really large amount , while someone in australia might put # 18,000 -- # 24,000 , thinking it to be a very low amount . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmicmz9ufiq ) might interest you somewhat . 
   can get in the way of the page you are viewing, 
  eh , i 've never had a problem with it . 
  in fact i regularly leave it there and hours later will notice that it 's there and be surprised . 
   and it must be closed manually, 
  rubbish . 
  if you click to open a file ( at least if there 's only one file in it and that download is completed , ca n't be certain of other cases ) it 'll open it , and then automatically close the download pane . 
  to be honest , * that 's * a problem i have , and i wish it did n't do this . 
  i want pretty much the exact opposite of / u/cypruswhm . 
  i want an awesome set of quest lines with amazing stories . 
  i want to be able to complete them alone if i choose to , but also to be able to join a group and enjoy them with others , if i choose to do that . 
  i want interesting additions to the lore of tes , and clever references to existing lore and previous games . 
  i want some cool and interesting group dungeons with a little bit of story depth to them ( pretty much what we got already in this respect ) , and i want an epic really * smooth * pvp experience , but one where i feel as though i can accomplish something myself . 
  apart from it being * smooth * , they 've pretty much got this down pat already . 
   due to its geographic size and general lack of density, 
  australia has nearly the same geographic size and a * much * lower population density outside of the top cities , and it consistently ranks just a little below or even amongst the scandinavian countries on equality and human development indices . 
  seriously ? 
  i spent 3 years living in korea , and nearly 6 living in vietnam . 
  not at any point did i consider myself korean or vietnamese . 
  i was an australian who just happens to live overseas . 
  well , not all scale problems . 
  demographic diversity and geographical size , sure . 
  but the one i see most people refer to is population , and australia does n't even come close to matching the us in that respect . 
  you brought up some similarities to the ioc , but did n't touch upon what was going through my mind at the time . 
  how is the ioc any different ? 
  is there anyone that they have to answer to ? 
  and if not , what prevents them from being just as corrupt as fifa is ( or are they just as corrupt , and i 've just not heard about it yet ? 
  there 's a reason i did n't specifically mention that i was talking about hdi . 
  income-inequality -- adjusted hdi would be much better choice , but it 's also worth looking at indices that only measure inequality , such as the ginni coefficient . 
  i do n't have a clue who the two singers are , but reading the comment you replied to my assumption was that they are , in fact , very similar , and he was poking fun at that fact . 
  i 'm assuming they 're singers ? 
  probably rap . 
  is that wrong ? 
  what do you mean by cover spoilers ? 
  if it 's a matter of using css so that titles do n't show until hover-over if it 's marked as a spoiler , that 's a pretty much useless solution . 
  most people who are worried about spoilers will avoid coming to / r/arrow until they 're caught up . 
  but that wo n't stop spoiler posts from appearing on their front page , where the css does n't have any effect . 
   they do n't pull in ratings like the other networks where there 's less product placement . 
  now , i 'm not arguing against using product placement as an extra source of revenue . 
  but you seem to be arguing that product placement causes * ratings * to go up ? 
  that makes no sense at all . 
  i would be perfectly fine if people would just quote damn times as a gmt offset . 
  but instead we always get `` european standard time '' or `` pacific daylight time '' and shit like that . 
  if you could just tell me how to get to gmt from that , i could work out what time it is here * so easily * . 
  but people almost never do it . 
  this would be a good time to reference the [ tomorrow series ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tomorrow_series ) , but i ca n't think of a clever way to do it . 
  what 's the z ? 
  i 'm guessing probably utc , since it was nowhere near 4am in south-east asian countries 8 hours ago . 
  a better question would how did it come to mean the opposite in america . 
  the use of the term `` liberal '' in most countries is a following on from how it was originally used in france , which was referring to having a liberal economy : what would today be classed as right-wing economics . 
  that it is usually associated with more authoritarian social policies is incidental to the term . 
  i was expecting it to be another click-bait title with a discussion on how it actually * is * a true tes game and people saying otherwise are wrong . 
  but this made me laugh . 
  saw things like that all the time in korea , too . 
  haha i love the korean writing there . 
  ( for anyone that does n't read korean , that 's keu lon chi king -- roughly , i 'm not exactly sure of the best way to transliterate korean . ), 
  like / u/karranas said , should be in nearly every place with ice cream . 
  at least when i lived there ( over 6 years ago now ) , pretty much any one of [ these ] ( http://previewcf.turbosquid.com/preview/2010/12/03__02_40_01/ice_cream_freezer_4.jpg1d568c16-76a5-407a-9a91-036b04c13024larger.jpg ) ( or [ these ] ( http://continentalicecream.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/best-ice-cream-freezer.jpg ) ) that you came across would have them in it . 
  i figured the idea of this was that it means you can easily use dvorak on any computer without authority . 
  unplug the keyboard from the computer , plug it into the arduino usb shield , and plug the arduino directly into the computer . 
  assuming it 's a usb keyboard . 
  when you leave , unplug it and plug the keyboard back straight into the computer . 
  i can see what you 're getting at here , but it 's really a different situation . 
  they 've outlined exactly why they made this decision in the faq :, 
  why are motorists now allowed to cross continuous, 
  centre lines to pass a cyclist ? 
   continuous centre lines are used where it is unsafe for a, 
  vehicle to pass another vehicle travelling at a similar speed . 
  they are often used at risky locations such as sharp corners . 
   bicycles travel at slower speeds than vehicles , so motorists, 
  can pass them more quickly , and may cross centre lines safely, 
  ( provided there is no oncoming traffic or other hazards ) . 
  the, 
  road rules already permit vehicles to cross continuous centre, 
  lines to avoid an obstruction , such as a broken down truck .
