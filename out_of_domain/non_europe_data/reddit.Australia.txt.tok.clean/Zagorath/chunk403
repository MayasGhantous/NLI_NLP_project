   the road rules about continuous centre lines are therefore, 
  being updated to make the existing provision clearer and, 
  help motorists comply with the minimum passing distance, 
  rules . 
  the update will not compromise road safety . 
   before you cross continuous centre lines to pass a cyclist ,, 
  you must still ensure that it is safe to do so , and watch for, 
  oncoming traffic and other hazards . 
  got ta be honest , i 'm a cyclist and i will regularly defend cyclists online because they get a lot of undeserved hatred . 
  but that particular rule seems dumb to me . 
  if i 'm stopped at lights , i 'll always wait and let other cars go first before taking off , because i know my acceleration is * much * slower than that of cars , so it 's much safer for me to just wait a few seconds and let them get clear . 
  i 've never had any problems with mold . 
  my reed storage technique is that when i 'm finished playing , the first thing i do is wipe it down with the same cloth i use for cleaning the inside of the clarinet and put it in the plastic slide-in casing it came in . 
  i then put it in the clarinet case in the area for miscellaneous stuff . 
  after that , i 'll drop the cloth down the rest of the clarinet , piece by piece . 
  i doubt that i 'm doing anything that would help you , but i thought i 'd share it just in case . 
  as a cyclist , i agree . 
  if you 're riding in a single-laned area , then get the fuck over to the left hand edge as much as possible and make it as easy as possible for cars to pass you while giving you room for safety . 
  worth noting , though , that while the guideline in areas that are not multi-lane do say to stay as far left as is practicable , in multi-laned areas , this does not apply , and a cyclist may take up any part of the lane . 
  it 's also worth noting that in some circumstances it may not be safe to go as far left as it appears from the vantage point of a car . 
   the official community ~ ~ video game ~ ~ tabletop rpg, 
  ftfy, 
  it 'd be a tabletop game where you play as community characters playing dnd . 
  ca n't get much more meta than that . 
  both methods ? 
  what 's the second method ? 
  i must say i find this line odd :, 
   when motorists know they are being recorded , they will behave accordingly, 
  when this particular device is designed in a way that means motorists * wo n't * know they 're being recorded . 
  they 're not going to be able to see that it 's a camera . 
  i would be extremely surprised if we saw a 720p screen on a wristwatch any time in the next couple of years . 
  would be interesting if there could be a simple hardware switch to allow it to work with other keyboard layouts , like azerty and qwertz . 
  yeah i was disappointed when he and oliver broke up their relationship , and was hoping that it would n't end up being truly over . 
  then he turns up dead . 
  that was a real shame . 
  that 's funny , because my impression when that scene first started was about how it seems every time he asks them for something they have him do something first . 
  that may or may not actually be accurate , but that 's certainly the impression i had . 
  which bit ? 
  rubbing it with the cloth ? 
  i dunno , i suppose it might . 
  i do it really gently , just to get the moisture off of the surface of it . 
  i ca n't imagine it has too much of an effect . 
  right , i got that one . 
  i was wondering what the * other * method is . 
  the one that the person above was talking about as if it confuses people . 
  damn that 's really unfortunate . 
  a comment above lead me to believe they were much more of a left-wing party . 
  the pirate party here on australia is really vague about most economic issues , but it certainly seems as though they might be libertarian leaning , which is incredibly unfortunate considering how great their policies on the internet and ip law are . 
  for anyone that did n't read the article , / u/melonfarmermike is correct :, 
   the driver was subsequently charged with driving without due care and fined $ 600 ( about # 330 ) and banned from driving for three months . 
  i was under the impression it was 20 m. sure you are n't confusing the radius for the diameter ? 
  but anyway , even if it is 40 m , depending on where he was , gps can be really inaccurate sometimes , so that could be why it did n't work -- not necessarily a problem with his device rendering controls . 
  i 'd actually love it if they really did try to violently overthrow the government . 
  they 'd have no hope in the world of succeeding , and they 'd all end up in gaol or dead , so we 'd never have to hear from them again . 
  crime rates are not an important statistic . 
  we banned guns because people were dying from gun-related crimes . 
  banning them may not have reduced crimes ( and that 's debatable , although it certainly did n't reduce them a * huge * amount ) , but it * did * reduce the amount of crimes that resulted in deaths . 
  take a read of [ this ] ( http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2012/12/16/gun_control_after_connecticut_shooting_could_australia_s_laws_provide_a.html ) . 
  cheers . 
  probably was a gps problem , then . 
  i suppose one could make the argue that oliver 's hood serves much the same purpose . 
  it 's not * sex * appeal , but it 's there to make him look cool and mysterious , but is n't very practical , since it obscures his vision . 
  i 'm not sure i would agree with that argument , but i thought it was at least worth mentioning . 
  as a musician , i found it funny . 
  now to go and try carving the two lines into my reed . 
  ^ i 'm ^ sure ^ that ^ it ^ could n't ^ possibly ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ wrong , ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  well apparently you are n't the only one . 
  / u/ioneeuropa did , too . 
  got ta say , though , i could n't even think of what you misread it as until seeing that comment . 
  could 've still been tenzin , since he was around then and knew he would be the future teacher of airbending to the avatar . 
  indeed i am from australia , and many australians do spell it that way , though not all . 
  i could be wrong , but i think that spelling is also sometimes used in the uk , ireland , and nz . 
  brackets *, 
  pretty cool . 
  wish they 'd mentioned the longer-term pricing for other countries , though . 
  i know australia 's 30-day subscription is $ 15.00 , which -- because of exchange rates and purchasing power -- is actually a fair amount cheaper than the us 's $ 14.99 . 
  but what about the 90-day cost ? 
  do we get a similar discount , or do we make up for the cheaper 30-day cost by not having a significant discount for paying for a longer subscription . 
  | currency | 30-day | 90-day | 180-day |, 
  | usd | $ 14.99 | $ 13.99 / 30 days | $ 12.99 / 30 days |, 
  | euro | 12.99 | $ 11.99 / 30 days | $ 10.99 / 30 days |, 
  | gbp | 8.99 | # 7.99 / 30 days | # 6.99 / 30 days |, 
  table in case anyone did n't want to go to the article . 
  ( brackets ) [ square brackets ], 
  but honestly , it 's just a matter of different dialects . 
  i was n't sincerely \\* correcting * / u/boner22 earlier , just poking fun . 
   what time is it in ( city or country ), 
  i use this one all the time . 
  it 's so useful for finding out when i 'll be able to download some show that comes out at a certain time in the usa . 
  or for working out when various other events are taking place overseas . 
  yeah that solved it for me ( australia ) . 
  did you even read the link you posted ? 
   parentheses ... also called simply brackets, 
  like i said , it 's a matter of dialect . 
  ninjaedit : actually , [ this section ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bracket#terminology_and_names_for_various_symbols ) would 've been an even better one to use . 
   * ( ) -- parentheses , ** brackets ( uk , new zealand , and australia ) ** , parens , round brackets , soft brackets , or circle brackets, 
   * [ ] -- ** square brackets ** , closed brackets , hard brackets , or brackets ( us ), 
  emphasis mine . 
  that 's got ta be confusing . 
  on the rare occasion i 've been to a starbucks ( it 's not very big here ) i 've ignored their sizes and just said small , medium , or large , and they 've given me the appropriate size,
