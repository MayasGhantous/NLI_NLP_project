  if they 've got small * and * their `` tall '' ( which is actually the small size ) , then people may not always get what they want . 
  it may be a single novel , but the movies are a trilogy , and the bechtel test is typically applied to films . 
  they 've had a bunch of them . 
  more or less a new one every week . 
  you got a source on that ? 
  last time i saw a concrete price for australia ( admittedly that was way back just after the third-to-last beta weekend ) it was sitting at $ 15.00 , which is an incredible deal when you consider exchange rates and purchasing power . 
  ah right , your figure is just the exchange rate , and not official figures ? 
  the figure i had seen was showing that they were going to charge $ 15 aud in australia . 
  i just realised that the link i provided did n't show that screen , and unfortunately i ca n't find it at all on the website now , so i do n't know whether or not they 're still going with that price or not . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1xp752/gaming_in_australia_at_15x_the_price/cfdcre2 ) is a thread i discussed the price in when i first found out . 
  holy fuck . 
  that thing 's 10 bitcoin . 
  that little coin would be worth over $ 5500 today . 
   there are 15 different racial styles for smiths to learn !, 
  how ? 
  i can count 10 races , where do the extra 5 racial styles come from ? 
  four designs total , and whichever one is most popular , i think , will stay on the site indefinitely , while the others are only available for a limited time ( a week , i think ? ) . 
  at least , that 's the impression i 've got from watching sxephil 's show . 
  i already knew that , but hey , everyone learns something for the first time at some point . 
  now you know something you did n't before , and that 's awesome !, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://xkcd.com/1053/ ), 
  oh it 's finished ? 
  fair enough . 
  i do n't really follow fhp , or any of defranco 's stuff outside of the pds , very closely . 
  yeah , unless you 're on a highly restrictive amount of data ( i currently get 20 gb per month , albeit with many major data-users being off-quota ) , not seeding is a major dick move . 
  i do n't seed currently , but make up for it by seeding for ages ( regularly to 2.0 or more ) when i have more data . 
  i also like to concentrate on seeding older , less heavily seeded , torrents . 
  when i saw the title `` how are my freedoms '' i thought it was going to be some crazy libertarian type . 
  then i actually read the responses , and was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable he was . 
  oh man i loved gollywogs !, 
  they were the best ( right behind yowies ) !, 
  i had completely forgotten about them until that comment . 
  i 'm guessing they 've stopped making them , too ? 
  it 's rated `` m '' in australia . 
  essentially that means * recommended * for age 15 and over , but younger people are still allowed to legally purchase and play it . 
  edit : just looked it up so i could be sure . 
  here are other countries ' ages :, 
  * australia -- recommended 15, 
  * central and south america -- recommended 14, 
  * europe -- legally 16, 
  * germany -- legally 16, 
  * russia -- legally 18, 
  * us -- recommended 17, 
  \\* i could n't find solid info on this . 
  it says `` esrbca rated m '' but all searching just took me to the esrb and said canada uses the same system .

  i feel number 10 was the best example of this . 
  two nearly * completely * different meanings . 
   this is the screen on which we play the video . 
  would be said in a situation in which it is already clear that for whatever reason , a video is played on a regular recurring basis , and it 's played on this screen . 
   this is the screen on which we are playing the video . 
  describes the situation in which a video is currently being played , or will be played very shortly . 
  it exclusively describes a single instance of a video being played . 
  got ta be honest , i feel like australia and the uk have the best claim to that title ... such as it is ... due to the whole `` coalition of the willing '' thing . 
  ( combined with other things like 5 eyes , which obviously also includes other nations . ), 
  it really depends on whether the answer given is one of inevitable fate , or one that you can change . 
  both approaches have been used in stories in the past . 
  yeah i have to agree with the others saying that it 's a bad idea to touch people 's spelling . 
  too much room for problems . 
  what if it corrects ill to i 'll when you actually meant to say that you are sick ? 
  or even worse , if you were roleplaying and used ill in something similar to `` ill news is an ill guest '' . 
  many other words could have this problem ( were and we 're the `` there '' homophones , its and it 's ) . 
  if it was adjusting capitalisation , that could be a problem for when people use their capitalisation to convey a particular message . 
  for example , all capsing a word or phrase conveys shouting , removing the capital from the first word of a sentence could imply a sort of meekness , etc. 
  not to mention , i would be * pissed * if it started changing my s to z , removing u from words , or changed words entirely , such as gaol to goal . 
  damn ... who calls the sarranid shit ? 
  mamlukes are arguably the best cavalry in the game ( arguably because they have some advantages over swadian and some disadvantages ) . 
  i made it the whole way a week or two ago . 
  it 's actually a lot less far than i thought it would be , and also a lot less interesting . 
  what you mean once again ? 
  i checked through the new queue and did n't see anything . 
  yeah i used the same imgur link , why on earth would n't i ? 
  it 's the same one from [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/teso/comments/215y5g/zos_to_pro_addon_players_we_are_not_moving_the/ ) . 
  it really is heaps of fun . 
  a year ago i was in the same position you are now , and luckily i found out some of my friends had a group going , so i joined in with them . 
  so much fun , trying to do all the most random things , looting stuff that 's probably useless , and just getting up to general mayhem . 
  can i just say , mr / u/theextremistmoderate , thank you so much for setting up this community . 
  well holy fuck . 
  that was just incredible !, 
  makes me really want to do something to conspire against my team . 
  unfortunately , that would be really against the character i 'm playing at the moment . 
  anyway , if anyone 's interested in star wars/dnd crossovers , this webcomic is essentially telling the story of star wars as if it were players playing a dnd game . 
  [ darths and droids ] ( http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html ) . 
  personally i think a couple of the other ones over at the newly-created / r/dndgreentext were better than this one . 
  in particular , the gay marriage one . 
  the star wars one titled `` the mechanic '' is pretty great , too , although not technically a greentext . 
  same in most of europe ( many places it 's even younger !, 
  ) , as well as australia , new zealand , and canada , and many parts of asia . 
  i really , * really * do n't like mmp . 
  the idea of a system that formalises the existence of parties and gives the parties the ability to put people into power who were explicitly voted out by their constituents really rubs me the wrong way . 
  i 'd much rather see us move to a form of stv , like we have in the senate . 
  john cleese explains the system really well in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) . 
  it 's a much more proportional system than the one we currently have , although it is n't quite perfect ( then , neither is mmp ) . 
  it also would be incredibly easy to implement , since from the voter 's perspective it 's the same as what we currently have ( except you 'd have maybe 3 -- 6 times as many people as you currently do on the hor ballot paper ) , and the back end system would be a cross over between what we already have in the senate , and what we already have in the hor . 
  i 'm still waiting for grey 's video on stv ... 
  you should try to be accurate with your wording , then . 
  mmp is the name of the specific system described above by the op , and used currently in new zealand . 
  what tasmania has , to my knowledge , is a form of stv -- the same as what we use for the federal senate . 
  and i 'd just say , this is exactly the system i would like to see . 
  i had no idea tasmania used it until about a week ago , but i 've been talking about it since i saw [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) where john cleese explains how it would work if the uk were to implement it .
