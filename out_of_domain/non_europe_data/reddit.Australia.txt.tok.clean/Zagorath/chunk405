   australia just went through 3 years of uncertainty with a minority government, 
  no we did n't . 
  we went through 3 years of uncertainty with a government that was weak at communicating policy . 
  it has nothing to do with minority government , as demonstrated by many european countries that have been run almost exclusively by minority governments for years . 
  in fact , during the gillard minority government , a lot of very important legislation got passed . 
  they had problems with communication , but they certainly * did not * have problems passing bills . 
  stv is generally regarded as a form of proportional representation , because that is , more or less , what it results in . 
  you ca n't ban parties . 
  parties form because certain people have similar views , and are better able to present those views to the public by grouping together and presenting a unified vision , rather than all squabbling over minutia . 
  in nearly any political system , parties of some sort are an inevitable result over time . 
   each mp is elected from a specific area which encourages gerrymandering, 
  i 'd just like to point out that in this respect it is * just as bad * as our current av system . 
  mmp , unfortunately , means that you kinda get the worst of both worlds . 
  you get the local extremists who nobody cares about outside their little area , and you get parties deciding to put back in people who they party likes even though their local members may have voted them out in droves . 
  ah , right . 
  australia 's current system for the federal hor is really simple . 
  it 's known as alternative vote or instant runoff voting , and it 's basically the next step up after first past the post ( used in the uk and the us -- a simple most votes wins ) . 
  [ good video explaining ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y3je3b8hse ) . 
  if you 're not sure how it works , it may be worth watching grey 's fptp video first . 
   since most people only put a single number above the line, 
  only in the current , bizarre , implementation of stv in australia 's senate . 
  there 's no reason for it to be this way . 
  if it were done in our hor , it should be done the same as the hor currently is . 
  you put numbers on individual candidates . 
  would be awesome if you could stop numbering when you want to , rather than having to number * everybody * , though . 
  but anyway , even with above the line voting , it results in a mostly proportional result . 
  it 's just that the proportions are based on the preference flows that the voter has implicitly accepted by voting above the line , rather than explicit preferences that they chose themselves . 
  edit : sorry about the downvote . 
  it was n't me , and to be honest it 'd be good of whoever it was to undo it . 
  remember [ reddiquette ] ( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) guys . 
  fair point . 
  the good thing is that if we did stv in the hor , there probably would n't be * quite * as many candidates to number . 
  if you had about 8 candidates before , and they merged into groups of 3 -- 6 , that 'd be a maximum of 48 , and could be as low as 24 . 
  a lot better than 82 or more . 
  still , above the line preferencing is what we really need . 
  putting a [ 1 ] above the line should indicate a vote of [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , etc. 
  for all the candidates in * that party only * . 
  then [ 2 ] above the line would indicate [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] for the candidates of that party , etc. 
  that , plus stopping whenever you want . 
  that 'd completely solve our current system , i feel . 
  ah , that 's a bit different to the mmp system that i 'm familiar with , which uses party lists to decide which candidates get put in first . 
  it 's also a pretty good sounding system , although having just been introduced to it i have n't looked into it very deeply yet . 
  just so you know , it has n't been formatted correctly . 
  it 's currently saying `` mostly [ true/false - edit ] '', 
  probably somewhere between about 80 years and 40,000 years . 
  yup , end of the second age . 
  could 've also referred to it as the last alliance . 
   every single part of your body was `` baked '' in some star that went supernova, 
  nonsense . 
  molecules as heavy as iron can be produced by fusion within stars , without needing to be the result of a supernova . 
  carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen are all included in that . 
  those three atoms make up over 90 % of the human body by mass . 
  that said , your previous sentence was still correct , because even though most of your body could exist without the atoms made in supernovae , a human life could n't be created without them , and more importantly , the earth would n't be around for life to exist * on * . 
  but it 's also one of those things that once you 've seen it , you ca n't unsee it . 
  i believe so , yes . 
  i 'd just point out that this subreddit is really relaxed with tags . 
  if it 's for a school project , most people would actually tag it [ academic ] . 
  but anyway , good survey , really simple and easy to complete . 
  i do wish there was an option between `` just once '' and `` multiple times '' , though , like `` only a few times '' . 
  technically `` multiple times '' is correct , but it feels to me like it 's exaggerating things . 
  apple has surprisingly shown that they 've got a really good setup when it comes to security/encryption . 
  the latest two [ security now podcasts ] ( https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm ) ( hosted by security expert steve gibson ) discussed this in great detail . 
  that 's very true , and was a massive oversight in terms of its significance , albeit a very small one in terms of how easy it was to accidentally make , but also to fix ( literally one line of code ) . 
  but it was fixed very quickly , and before any exploits were in the wild , and was basically unrelated to their overall security strategy . 
  i 'm just curious , why na ? 
  if you 're in south africa , would n't it be more efficient for you to connect to the european server ? 
  playing in brisbane on my uni connection ( living on-campus ) it 's been pretty good . 
  during big siege battles in pvp i did have some problems , but i never had * any * issues in pve , including group dungeons , or with smaller stuff in the pvp . 
  side note , i 'm curious , where 'd you buy the game ? 
  i just tried getting my family overseas ( in south east asia ) to buy it from gmg , because the store was showing them us price . 
  it did n't work . 
  then i tried using a proxy from here in aus , and it also did n't work . 
  ( in both cases , i tried both debit card and paypal . 
  i * think * this was because of regional issues , but i 'm not sure . ), 
  i was thinking something that could convert * from * those other layouts to dvorak , in case you need to use it on a computer that uses a different layout .

   incredibly simple mistake with incredibly huge consequences, 
  sums it up * perfectly * . 
  see my reply to another comment that replied to mine for a little more perspective on that . 
  [ he 's got quite a few good videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbtongue/videos?sort=dd&amp;view=0&amp;shelf_id=1 ) . 
  the whole tun series ( `` tasteful , understated nerdrage '' ) is brilliant , as well as the latest video , which feels basically like one of his tun videos to me . 
  closure to the families , as well as understanding what caused it to try and prevent it happening again . 
  if it was a hijacking , i think most people would agree it was most likely a hijacking that failed and/or did n't end up landing safely anywhere . 
  i 'm just curious , is the two hour loop constant ? 
  i would have thought they 'd have some sort of system that causes it to automatically stop in case of an accident , to save the moments that occurred leading up to it . 
  did you just call the theory of evolution of species by natural selection `` pointless trivia '' ? 
  good luck !, 
  you 're probably close to half way there now !, 
  pretty sure i 've seen studies that show once you make enough money to comfortably cover expenses , more money has a minute impact on your happiness . 
  i do n't care if it is n't * actually * the original form of the phrase . 
   the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb, 
  stands out so much better to me than the more common form of it . 
  well duh . 
  chaotic good , lawful evil , etc. 
  ah good point . 
  actually there was a thread a little while ago that debunked this pretty thoroughly in the comments . 
  steve gibson who created spinrite , yes . 
  not sure why you called it that , or put it in quotes , though . 
  i tried buying it last night from greenman gaming .
