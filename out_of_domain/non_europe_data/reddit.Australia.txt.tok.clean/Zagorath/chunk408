  able to use exclusives to either platform . 
  calling it now , slade cuts his arm off during a fight between the two main mirakuru-injected characters . 
  is it just me , or does it feel like it 's been a while since his last update ? 
  i 'm thinking about it , and i ca n't see how that 's true . 
  reddit automatically converts any line starting with `` x. 
  '' , where x is any number , into an ordered list , starting with 1 . 
  honestly , it causes more problems than it solves , but there you go . 
  you can get around it by using '' \\ '' as an escape character before the full stop . 
  stuff, 
  becomes, 
  stuff, 
  i feel like * most * people who have never learnt a second language would have trouble with that request . 
  it 's not like they would n't know how to conjugate basic english verbs in the present tense , it 's that they do n't know what those words mean when put together like that . 
  you only really learn what verb conjugation is , or the specific names for different tenses , when learning a foreign language , or perhaps if you did linguistics . 
  you may be able to use all the tenses correctly , but you do n't learn the structure behind what you 're doing under normal circumstances . 
  it 's one of the big advantages of learning a foreign language -- outside of actually being able to communicate with people who speak that language . 
  ho chi minh city . 
  the longest viola joke . 
  it 's not about knowing/not knowing how to conjugate , it 's about explicitly knowing what it is that you 're doing at a higher level * when * you conjugate . 
  for most english speakers , at least , they do this instinctively : they know what word to use because they 've seen and heard it done that way , and they just learn from context . 
  i love playing healer/assist characters in computer games , but it just seems so dull in dnd . 
  i do n't know if there 's anything they could do to make it more enjoyable , but until they do i 'll keep playing my damage/control psion . 
  not queensland , either . 
  that was 9 words . 
  checkmate . 
  that 's why it 's '' * do n't * fret it '' . 
  i 've seen this with [ violins and violas ] ( http://youtu.be/igwt_wnqmuw?t=5m26s ) before , but never with a cello . 
  they are * written * like a cello but an octave lower , but yeah , the actual instrument is tuned in fourths . 
  it actually has the same tuning as the bass guitar . 
  it does look that way , but i suspect it may just be an artefact of the lighting . 
  see the writing on the note : it 's the correct way around . 
  so it 's not a mirror image . 
  it could still be strung backwards , but that seems even less likely to me . 
  probably just weird lighting . 
  it 's [ freebooting ] ( / r/freebooting ) . 
  it always makes me laugh when people talk about how dirty the brisbane river is . 
  i mean , sure , it 's not beautiful , but i would not be averse to swimming in it if i had to . 
  the saigon river , on the other hand ... yeah , not gon na happen . 
  of course they have . 
  bad linguistics ( and the badx subreddits in general ) are some of the worst pieces of shit on reddit . 
  but i am glad for this bot , so that we know when they 're around . 
  edit : but then you get people like / u/inscrutableted , who make me remember that they 're not * all * shits . 
  some of them can really be reasonable and present intelligent arguments . 
  yeah i got ta be honest , i basically only use whom in the case of `` to whom '' , `` from whom '' etc. 
  otherwise i play it safe and use who . 
  because saying `` whom '' when `` who '' is technically correct makes you come across like a pretentious arse . 
  saying `` who '' when `` whom '' is correct usually does n't make you look too uneducated , except for the glaringly obvious cases . 
  damn that sounds like fun . 
  i wish the rest of my group was as interested in the roleplay aspect as i am . 
  i 've got one person who seems actively out to ruin any sense of immersion , one that loosely attempts to justify relatively random actions with their character , and the rest kinda just ignore the roleplay aspect . 
  the dm 's fantastic , though . 
  even just a rule like keeping in character and out of character conversation completely separated would probably go a long way to helping , i suppose . 
  yup . 
  got it bang on the money . 
  to be quite frank , the sentences where i would use `` whom '' very rarely come up in normal conversation . 
  people are likely to say `` who did you send it to '' or `` who did it come from '' , which are perfectly fine in my books . 
  some really strict grammar nazis might insist on not ending in a preposition , but the above sentences are , in my opinion , perfectly acceptable in modern english . 
  the only sentence structure that sounds uneducated to me is if someone says `` to who did you send it '' or `` from who did it come '' . 
  if you use the same sentence * structure * as where you should use whom , but then do n't actually use whom , and instead use who . 
  the intersect of the case in the above paragraph , with the case in my previous comment , is an extremely small one , but it does sometimes happen , and that 's what 'll cause me to cringe slightly . 
  when i see people make mistakes about areas in which i am knowledgeable , i try to politely correct the matter . 
  i do n't go bitching about them behind their back , i do n't create large downvote campaigns , and i * certainly * do n't ** ban ** them from the subreddit for daring to come and ask a few questions -- politely , i might add . 
  the above is what happened to me the first time i encountered the subreddit . 
  i was linked to for a comment that others in the same thread actually said they found quite reasonable , but nonetheless i was mass downvoted . 
  i came to the subreddit to discuss the particular comment , as well as to bring up the problem of downvote brigading , but one of the mods promptly banned me . 
  no warning , no explanation , just banned . 
  i followed this up with a discussion with the other mods , who defended his decision . 
  they specifically said they were n't interested in polite debate . 
  all that subreddit cares about is bitching and whining . 
  you yourself may be a fine person , i would n't know , but that subreddit fosters of some of the most anti-intellectual behaviour i 've ever seen on this site -- or otherwise . 
  all this is without getting into my personal disagreement with many linguists about the nature of what they do . 
  i agree strongly with / u/inscrutableted 's comment in the linked thread . 
  linguists do n't have to necessarily be at odds with people trying to teach correct usage of the language . 
  linguists describe how people * are * speaking , but there is no necessary reason that others -- or even the same people -- ca n't try to correct them when they go against standard accepted usage . 
  prescriptivism and descriptivism * are not * at odds with each other . 
  i dunno , i 've always figured people who are really tough and outgoing in public life may be the opposite in their private life . 
  what was it ? 
  you only * have * to spoiler tag stuff for 5 days . 
  does n't mean it 's not still polite to spoiler tag things for longer . 
  you know , to not spoil things for others ? 
  there are a couple of mentions of keming , which is probably more appropriate in this case . 
  there 's a movie of around the world in 80 days . 
  it 's not great , but it 's far from the worst film adaption of a book . 
  wait , so malukah , the singer who did some fan songs for skyrim -- as well as her own covers of the in-game songs sung by bards -- was hired by zos to do music for the credits for eso ? 
  damn , well done to her . 
  i can understand why it would be downvoted in a non-music crowd , but i for one decided to [ head over to the / r/wtf post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/21pwtw/when_i_first_saw_this_the_first_words_out_of_my/ ) and upvote it . 
  i 'm sensing sarcasm , but when i first read the title that was my impression . 
  i 've usually only ever tipped by telling them to keep the change on whatever denomination was most convenient to give them . 
  i 'd probably be more likely to give a $ 20 and a $ 5 , because i tend not to carry around $ 2 or $ 1 coins . 
  that said , i generally do n't tip * at all * here in australia , it 's mainly something i 've done when overseas . 
  i 'm going to repeat the previous guy 's question . 
  did you deliver in the 60s ? 
  ( or , more realistically , 5 years ago . ), 
  minimum wage today is $ 16.37 for over-21s , and $ 11.18 for someone aged 18 . 
  why the fuck would you tip someone who already works at a place that 's absolutely raking in cash like a casino ? 
  that just seems stupid to me . 
  then again , i 'm pretty firmly against tipping ( or , to be more precise , tipping * culture * ) in general , so that must weigh in on it . 
  people say this all the time , but it 's certainly not been my experience . 
  i have n't been to any country where i would say the service was consistently bad , including australia and many european countries . 
  part of me thinks that what americans want is n't good service , it 's waiters to act overly nice or something , which quite honestly would creep me out .
