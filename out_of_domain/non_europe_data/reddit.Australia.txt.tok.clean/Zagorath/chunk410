  absolute genius piece of marketing . 
  ah fair enough . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  yeah you can , actually . 
  it 's a bit weird , imo , but it does do damage . 
  oh damn , i completely missed that one . 
  thanks !, 
  hmm ... it 's possible that it was a repeat . 
  it was on tuesday at around 10:30 on abc2 ( at least in brisbane ) . 
  [ looks like it 's on tomorrow , too ] ( http://www.yourtv.com.au/guide/tomorrow/ ) . 
  gruen transfer , though , not planet . 
  i think there 's no real difference . 
  nope , not american . 
  i 've managed to get 40 gb free on [ copy ] ( https://copy.com?r=upfrdn ) . 
  you `` only '' get 15 gb for signing up , but you get 5 gb for each referral , which is pretty damn sweet . 
  plus , if you share a file or folder with other users , it only counts a fraction towards each user 's storage . 
  for example if i share 12 gb with three people , each person 's storage will only have it count 4 gb . 
  they 've got clients for windows , os x , linux , ios , android , raspberry pi , and windows phone .

  that 's the doylist explanation of it , sure . 
  but many people want an explanation that fits within the universe , a watsonian explanation . 
  it 's the same as with the parsec thing . 
  the doylist explanation is probably just that lucas wanted a fancy space-sounding word . 
  but people want an explanation that fits the characters and the universe , so they come up with things like how it 's dangerous to go a shorter route , or how it 's the * character * , solo , who wanted to sound impressive . 
  you got your syntax backwards . 
  \\ [ square brackets go around the text ] ( http://while_standard_brackets_go_around_the_link.com ), 
  might wan na spoiler tag that in case someone comes across this who has n't seen the show . 
  copy this line if you do n't know how to :, 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` put your spoilers in here '' ), 
  honestly i 'd put it above justice league . 
  i watched that as a kid and enjoyed it , but more recently i tried getting back into it and it just did n't grab me the same way young justice did when i started watching it a year or two ago . 
  do n't worry , i made the same mistake . 
  i was thinking `` oh , the third one actually looks worse than the second , despite being a better setting '' , because i thought it was a line from worst to best . 
  as someone who 's generally pretty far from society 's ideal of `` masculinity '' , it does bother me sometimes that men are expected to not discuss these sorts of topics . 
  that said , i feel it 's worth mentioning that depression is more common in women than it is in men . 
  i do n't think anyone in this thread or on the podcast ever suggested or tried to imply that learning a computer programming language would help you to learn human languages . 
  the only debate is whether programming should be considered more important than human languages or not . 
  i use rss for a bunch of things , but having a good podcasting app ( i like pocketcasts ) is so much more convenient than using a computer-based rss reader . 
  i ca n't vouch for its recent version , but the older ios versions were certainly extremely high quality . 
  hopefully the newer one is also just as good as the newer android versions . 
   like all children between the ages of 4-16, 
  just want to point out that * all * major characters in the original show are in that range . 
  the all caps of nsfl stands out much more . 
  i would have seen that and not clicked , but with just a normal sentence , it did n't stand out , so i clicked before reading . 
  a bunch of my friends at uni played it and invited me to a game . 
  anyway , if you want to get into it , i 'd suggest looking around whatever local places you can . 
  your city 's subreddit/other online forums , perhaps local gaming groups/stores . 
  things like that . 
  if you 're at uni , especially a large one , i imagine it should be easy to find a group . 
  try posting on whatever university communications you can : facebook groups , a subreddit , official billboards ( physical or digital ) etc. 
  see my reply to the other guy for a little more . 
  urgh i hate timezones . 
  it 's the second here , so i had let my guard down . 
  i have a friend who did hers on music in television . 
  all evolutions start out as random mutations . 
  i did n't believe you , so i looked it up . 
  the estimate is around 108 billion people have ever lived . 
  with a current population of around 7 billion , that 's 6.4 % of all humans that have ever lived are still alive . 
  so yeah , around 7 % is accurate . 
  pretty impressive . 
  [ [ source ] ( http://www.prb.org/publications/articles/2002/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth.aspx ) ], 
  as an interesting aside , the actual calculation is done in a simpler way , computationally speaking . 
  if you make $ 10,000 , instead of deciding to take the first $ 8,925 at 10 % , they say `` $ 892.5 + ( 15 % of ( $ 10,000 - $ 8,925 ) ) '' . 
  at $ 50,000 per year , they say `` $ 4991.1 + ( 25 % of ( $ 50,000 - $ 36,251 ) ) '' . 
  the end result is exactly the same as how you described it , it 's just a simpler calculation to make this way . 
  it 's down again now . 
  i was hoping to play for 30 minutes before i went to bed . 
  woulda been the first 30 minutes i got since sunday . 
  oh is that true ? 
  so people who preordered the game will not have to start paying sub fees until 4th may ? 
  oh thanks . 
  that really helps . 
  i was looking at image 4 before and thinking it looks something like 14 , like it was the youngest one of the six . 
  the smart thing to do is create an alt that you only use for posts that would make you look more employable , and use * that * . 
  not really . 
  the complaints over that have largely died down , and that was a definite improvement , with a huge number of advantages , and only one minor disadvantage . 
  inline comment replies . 
  posting links . 
  comments longer than 500 characters . 
  better moderation tools for uploaders . 
  shitty comments more likely to be pushed to the bottom and not seen by users . 
  not to mention that people tend to be less dickish when their name is attached . 
  all for the small price of connecting through google + . 
  it really is . 
  i mean , they 're two very different shows , which makes them kinda hard to compare , but in my opinion the british show was vastly superior to the american one . 
  however , it would n't have continued being amazing if it had lasted much longer than it did . 
  the american one was not as good ( * in my opinion * ) , but was designed better for a mass audience over many seasons . 
  not to mention even on the desktop version , you can still see them if they reach your front page or / r/all , or if you have `` use subreddit style '' turned off . 
  you 've got google now to tell you when shows air ? 
  how can i get it to do that ? 
   slade said `` your brother 's secret '' because oliver is the only person she trusts, 
  that works ( rather tentatively , i might add ) as a watsonian explanation of why he says it , but to be honest in this case i think the doylist explanation is far more important . 
  he said it to build tension with the audience , who thought slade was going to reveal that oliver is the arrow . 
  the slade slate . 
   several supporting cast members of barry 's upcoming tv show the flash are set to appear on arrow next week . 
  no they are n't . 
  no episode next week . 
  does n't show up for me :(, 
  perhaps has n't been rolled out internationally yet ? 
  i usually get the response `` oh , what 's that ?
