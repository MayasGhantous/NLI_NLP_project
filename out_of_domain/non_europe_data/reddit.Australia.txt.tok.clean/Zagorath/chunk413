  important questions :, 
  * which faction are you in ? 
  * what 's your clearance level, 
  oh , and it 's not a patient game by any means , but i 've been really enjoying ** elder scrolls online ** . 
  and now i finally know why bamboo is considered a grass . 
  i agree with this , although i personally far prefer word to pages . 
  i have heard some people say that numbers is better than excel for average use . 
  these people are clearly wrong . 
  i just want to know that it 'll run nicely and not use their own custom memory manager . 
  damn thing runs like absolute crap , and does n't work properly with my keyboard layout . 
  what an inane comment . 
  by that logic , neither is linux free ( free as in without cost ) , or * any * piece of software . 
   my best story was when a friend asked if i could speak japanese well , now that i 've been living in hong kong for a while . 
  \\* facepalm *, 
  but seriously , how 's your cantonese ? 
  as a side note , i think you meant expatriates , not ex-patriots . 
  completely different words ( though they share the latin root patria for `` fatherland '' ) . 
  if in doubt , expat works fine . 
  this video ( kind of ) goes against betteridge 's law of headlines . 
   a customs territory with full autonomy in the conduct of their external commercial relations, 
  this made me curious as to whether or not taiwan is in the wto . 
  so i googled , and they are , under the name chinese taipei . 
  most major team sports , actually . 
  it 's the same for both rugby codes and cricket ( though wales is combined with england , and scotland 's team is a very minor player ) , off the top of my head . 
  edit : sports, 
  if you 're using median as the average , then fine . 
  but if you 're using mean , that 's not necessarily true , as described by / u/maz-o . 
  that said , in cases like this one i think using the median is a better choice . 
  round to the nearest 25 , followed by nearest 50 , etc. 
  [ a semi-competent genie grants you two wishes out of a predetermined list of twelve . 
  which do you choose ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/t70j8/a_semicompetent_genie_grants_you_two_wishes_out/ ), 
  my absolute favourite reddit thread of all time . 
  in particular , the story of [ happy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/t70j8/a_semicompetent_genie_grants_you_two_wishes_out/c4k7ml5 ) by / u/hijklmn0 , with the alternate ending proposed by / u/ai1265 . 
  but really the entire thread is just full of amazing stuff . 
  a , for me , is an absolute no-brainer . 
  choosing a second one was harder . 
  c is kinda tempting , but e and k are both extremely tempting . 
  the teleportation is n't necessarily very far , but it is quite frequent , and honestly that small difference ( not having to walk a few hundred extra metres ) would cause me to be late a lot less often . 
  but then , i really do pride myself on my intelligence , so being able to improve that to such a large degree would also be so beneficial . 
  if the damn cooldown was n't so long on that one i would n't hesitate to pick it . 
  honestly , your ending is what turned that story from really good , to absolutely incredible . 
  it causes the whole story to have a completely different meaning , and one that i think makes it much more powerful . 
  kudos to you for coming up with it . 
  [ it 's not even a joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkmghkgp--y ) sfw . 
  it 's meant to be 2 ! , where !, 
  means `` factorial '' . 
  would be 3 * 2 * 1 , which is 6 . 
   asian is just a term used to identify people who have similar genetics to people in the eastern part of the continent asia, 
  you wan na devalue the term even further , that 's not even universally true . 
  in the uk , the term `` asian '' is most often used with regards to the indian subcontinent . 
  i 'm not a fan of the show , but i 've heard good things about elementary , which turned watson into a female . 
  just make sure you share it to your circles , then , instead of publicly . 
  that 's the best feature of google + ( well , aside from hangouts ) , so make good use of it . 
  hell yeah it 's better now . 
  you can have conversations that last more than 500 characters , which makes a big difference if you 're trying to actually discuss stuff , rather than make offhand remarks . 
  ( for example , this comment is above 500 characters . ), 
  you can post links to relevant information . 
  sure it can be abused , but i 've not seen that very often ( and when i do , i make sure to take the time to mark it as spam . 
  let those users get banned . 
  ) , and the utility of sharing a relevant wikipedia link or another youtube video far outweighs the minor annoyance of occasional spam . 
  and finally in-line comment replies . 
  oh god it was awful before . 
  if you make a point -- especially if it 's a slightly controversial one -- you could get a bunch of replies to that all saying the same thing , because none of them could see the others . 
  then , you 'd have to reply to them all individually , because again , none would see your reply otherwise . 
  now , if one person attempts to correct you , others can see it , and everyone will see your rebuttal , and thus you do n't get redundant comments . 
  tl ; dr yeah it 's better now . 
  longer comments . 
  links . 
  in-line conversations . 
  it can even be significantly better in many cases . 
  see : google + vs. facebook as a social media platform . 
  if they were to implement this , i 'm sure it would not be difficult to work out how much they would need to charge in order to make it slightly more profitable for them than the ads themselves would be . 
  still , i doubt they would ever do something like that , because the number of people who would pay anything for it is probably so small it would n't be worth the effort . 
  pretty sure it 's only from ad views . 
  likes and favourites help their videos be seen by more people , but do n't directly contribute to income . 
  they do n't want to be a competitor to youtube . 
  vimeo is for more artistic videos . 
  things such as short films . 
  it would dilute their brand if they encouraged more vlogging-type video-makers to use vimeo regularly . 
   would you enjoy dinner at the ritz if there was a compulsory side dish of fresh dog shit ? 
  what the fuck does that have to do with anything . 
  that 's not even an * attempt * at a real analogy . 
  you 've hit the nail right on the head . 
  i mean , they fucking called it google plus for god 's sake . 
  the name 's a clear indication of what it is . 
  g + is google , plus more . 
  plus the link between all of google 's services . 
  ibm is a massively successful company , but for the average consumer they might as well be dead . 
  they 're boring and uninteresting . 
  completely ` corporate ' . 
  this is where microsoft seems to be headed . 
  i 'm guessing apple maps has integration with siri on ios the same way google maps has integration with google now on android . 
  that sort of convenience is hard to overlook . 
   term of phrase, 
  i can see how it 'd be easy to make that mistake . 
  but the phrase is actually `` turn of phrase '' . 
  [ congratulations , you 're one of today 's 10,000 !, 
  because this is google we 're talking about , and manipulating data is exactly what google is good at . 
  assuming that they can work out , for any given user , how much revenue they gain from that user ( this is the part that 's potentially difficult , but again , because it 's google i think it 's a safe bet they could do it ) , the challenge is trivial , anyway .
