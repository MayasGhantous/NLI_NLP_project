  many people already do it without realising it goes against what was previously considered acceptable . 
  these days , i think most people would agree that using they as a singular gender-neutral pronoun is perfectly acceptable . 
  god damn you guys need better consumer protection laws . 
  oh man i love the checkout !, 
  the two circles makes it mean per mille . 
  25 \u2030 is only 2.5 % , so actually the price difference was n't all that much !, 
  \\* if you take the per mille sign literally . 
  i imagine / u/vanishinglex did n't actually intend to mean per mille . 
   road etiquette is learned through experience, 
  certain parts of road etiquette , though , should be taught while they still have their learner 's , if not earlier . 
  turning your high-beams down is a * really * basic thing . 
  it 's something that i remember my parents mentioning long before i was old enough to drive . 
  if you had reasonable consumer protection laws you would n't have to worry about places doing things like this to you . 
  it would be illegal and they would be * forced * to give you what you paid for . 
  regulation can go too far . 
  there are many examples here in australia where many people would say regulation goes too far . 
  but if businesses can get away with stuff like what happened to op , that 's clearly an example of regulation not going far enough . 
  he bought something under certain assumptions , and was not given what he paid for . 
  that is absolutely not acceptable . 
  here i would n't need to sue them myself . 
  i would contact the industry ombudsman and he would take over the matter . 
   also , i kind of get this because we technically need royal assent to pass laws in canada . 
  true , but the monarch you get assent from is different to the monarch that rules england , which is different from our monarch here in australia . 
  i mean , sure , technically it 's all the same * human being * -- elizabeth alexandra mary of the house of windsor -- but the entity of the monarch is actually separate in each country . 
  she is n't the `` queen of the commonwealth '' , she 's `` the queen of the united kingdom '' , and `` the queen and australia '' , and `` the queen of canada '' , etc. , separately . 
  you do have one of those . 
  they go by a different name ( `` congressman '' , i believe ) , but the british lower house is nearly identical in structure to the american lower house , with the exception that the government executive ( the pm and other ministers ) are also within britain 's house of commons . 
  growing up , i was taught that question marks and exclamation marks can go inside or outside quotations , depending on how they are used , but that commas and full stops must always go inside . 
  i never follow that rule . 
  i 'll put my damn full stops wherever it makes the most sense , semantically . 
  the nat geo network is just as bad . 
  my bank gave me one with the card . 
  i have n't changed it from that . 
  i was just basing it on how i 've seen people tend to use it . 
  conversations i 've seen on reddit and on american tv shows seem to use the word `` congressman '' to refer to someone in hor , and senator for someone from the senate . 
  since the combined two houses is called congress , i 've always found it odd that people use the words in that way . 
  though if it 's simply a misreading on my part , that would definitely explain things . 
  come to think of it , we do much the same thing here . 
  we have a hor and senate just like you guys , only we call the combination of them parliament . 
  the term member of parliament is only ever applied to members of the house of representatives . 
  i found this on wikipedia , which seems to be in line with how i thought it worked in the us :, 
   a member of the house is referred to as a `` representative '' , `` congressman '' , or `` congresswoman '' . 
  while senators are technically `` congressmen/congresswomen '' , the two terms are generally used exclusively by members of the house of representatives . 
  it does once joffrey 's dead and does n't need to be taught shit . 
  ah that would explain it . 
  one recent episode of community was parodying g.i. 
  joe . 
   is in need of a new it department . 
  unless op * is * the way it department . 
   the defenestrations of prague ... were two incidents in the history of bohemia ... the first occurred in 1419 and the second in 1618 . 
  the best thing is it works more or less the same for both incidents . 
  change all of your passwords , everywhere . 
  while you 're at it , start using lastpass , rather than trying to remember lots of unique strong passwords , or even worse , using the same password everywhere . 
  i actually deleted the facebook app when i found out they wanted to be able to read all of my texts . 
  i 'm like , fuck no . 
  i do n't care if it 's supposedly only going to be read once to validate my phone number . 
  just let me copy and paste the code like any other fucking app/site . 
  not paypal , but i think apple lets you make itunes purchases with their fingerprint scanner . 
  i 've not heard of any vulnerabilities on their side , though . 
  security now was the podcast , and it is indeed co-hosted by leo laporte of twit . 
  the security expert on the show , steve gibson , * really * knows what he 's talking about . 
  he did a three-parter on ios security , covering every aspect of security on ios in detail . 
  * [ part 1 ] ( http://twit.tv/show/security-now/446 ), 
  * [ part 2 ] ( http://twit.tv/show/security-now/447 ), 
  * [ part 3 ] ( http://twit.tv/show/security-now/448 ), 
  i love you . 
  please stay around . 
  because it 's texts . 
  my own private communication . 
  i fully expect that they will be parsing my messages through facebook messenger in order to provide more relevant advertising . 
  but they should n't be gaining access to my communications from other media . 
  i 'm pretty fucking sure the comment you replied to was sarcastic . 
  are you really recommending people use a monospaced font for regular typing ? 
  smarties are big here in australia , too . 
  i think they have them in the uk and nz as well . 
  just a tip , if you put spoiler in the title , you do n't need to do the syntax like you would for a comment . 
  but i 'm curious , if you think there was a lot of blue , what * might * it have been hinting at ? 
  i 've not read comics , so i have n't a clue what it could be if there is anything . 
  i agree with / u/dahahawgy . 
  probably best not to follow him until you 're caught up . 
  yeah my understanding was that to `` dilute '' someone 's shares , you would basically have to release more shares , which would result in someone who was previously a majority shareholder no longer being the majority shareholder . 
   the primary reason for not being able to include ladders into environments is due to their engine , [ is that ] ladders caused problems for character ai, 
  because that 's all people really need to know . 
  opening the page for the rest of the article is pointless . 
  that 's a terrible idea , dude . 
  [ relevant study ] ( http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/41/onlinetext.asp ) . 
  tl ; dr , people read courier a lot slower than they read fonts like tahoma or verdana . 
  does it require a licensed copy of minecraft ? 
  i 'm pretty sure the accent still needs to be there on the masculine version . 
  and yeah , they 're french words . 
  spanish feminine words generally end in `` a '' and masculine ones end in `` o '' , while in french it 's `` e '' and `` not e '' ( as a general rule , there are , of course , many exceptions ) . 
  yeah i had stopped playing for a while . 
  only recently got back into it in preparation for an upcoming anomaly in my area . 
  yeah i do n't think anyone would disagree that they way the show portrayed it , they were clearly hinting that it was his feelings for annie . 
  some people do n't like that , some do . 
  that 's fine . 
  agree completely with g.i. 
  jeff . 
  it was a mediocre episode taken on its own , and was made worse by the way it placed within the overall show plot . 
  they could have redeemed it by addressing the issue in one of the later episodes , or hinting at it more in prior episodes , but they just did n't .
