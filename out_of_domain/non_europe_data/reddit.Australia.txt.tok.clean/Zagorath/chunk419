  they 'll probably want to keep in a mystery eternally . 
  is there anything to look for in a power supply other than that it has enough wattage to power all the other devices ? 
  here 's a little something from wikipedia which supports what you just said . 
   the constitution does not define the phrase natural-born citizen , and various opinions have been offered over time regarding its precise meaning . 
  a 2011 congressional research service report stated that, 
    the weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term `` natural born '' citizen would mean a person who is entitled to u.s. citizenship `` by birth '' or `` at birth '' , either by being born `` in '' the united states and under its jurisdiction , even those born to foreign parents ; by being born abroad to u.s. citizen-parents ; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for u.s. citizenship `` at birth '' . 
  such term , however , would not include a person who was not a u.s. citizen by birth or at birth , and who was thus born an `` alien '' required to go through the legal process of `` naturalization '' to become a u.s. citizen . 
  edit : actually , just realised that the extract quoted there is cited from the same link you provided . 
  anyway , now it 's at least here so people do n't need to click away to see it . 
  yeah , that 's definitely how it 's meant to be interpreted . 
  the comma placement is incredibly misleading , though , so i can see how someone would misinterpret it . 
  but if the voltage is constant , and you 've already got the wattage ( since it 's the headline spec ) , why would you need to look at the number of amps ? 
  surely that will just be the watts divided by the voltage ? 
  or am i missing something ? 
  ah right . 
  i was n't aware that different devices needed different voltages . 
  cheers . 
   this quotation probably was originated from `` franz\u00f6sischer witz '' by kurt tucholsky ( 1932 ) : `` darauf sagt ein diplomat vom quai d\u2019orsay : `` der krieg ? 
  hunderttausend tote : das ist eine statistik ! '''' ( `` at which a diplomat from france replies : `` the war ? 
  i ca n't find it too terrible !, 
  the death of one man : that is a catastrophe . 
  one hundred thousand deaths : that is a statistic ! '''' ), 
   but note : `` when one man dies it is a tragedy , when thousands die it 's statistics . '', 
  this is the exact quote from the mccullough biography of truman , books.google.de according to the citation in that book , mccullough got it from page 278 of the book `` the time of stalin : portrait of tyranny '' , by anton antonov-ovseyenko . 
  mccullough quotes stalin as having said this to churchill at teheran . 
  `` churchill had been arguing that a premature opening of a second front in france would result in an unjustified loss of tens of thousands of allied soldiers . 
  stalin responded that ` when one man dies it is a tragedy , when thousands die it 's statistics ' '' .

  many types of cancers are highly preventable . 
  lung and oral cancer can be almost completely eradicated by simply not smoking , while skin cancer can be avoided by wearing sunscreen when in the sun , and avoiding going out in the middle of the day . 
  many other cancers , including breast , prostate , and testicular , are also very preventable by various methods . ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( https://preventcancer.org/prevention/preventable-cancers/ ), 
  and a cheap laptop . 
  i 've given up waiting for you to post that . 
  that looks way too much like an extended validation ssl certificate to me , which could be extremely misleading for some users . 
  best of luck everybody !, 
  i 'm sure you 'll do amazingly !, 
  how would that help for what / u/barren23 wanted to see ? 
  south korea has had * enormous * improvements in diet and medical care over the last 50 years , but they wanted data on places which have only had marginal improvements . 
  except for that one that was just bots . 
  the central australian states do this , too . 
  utc +9:30 , with the eastern states at utc +10 . 
  the reason in our case is that the east coast is the economic and cultural hub of the country , so it makes sense for them to want to shift closer for communication purposes . 
  haha i bet a lot of soprano sax players get the opposite . 
  metallic clarinet . 
  scumbag cane more like . 
  that feels nothing like tag pro :(, 
  lacks the really detailed momentum of tag pro , which means things like blocking are virtually useless . 
  the controls are also awkward to use . 
  the brilliant thing about tag pro is that you can join it and immediately know what to do . 
  this game , i spent five minutes in it and i 'm still not sure how to control where the ball in relation to my ball . 
  behind every joke is a grain of truth , 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ so ^ ^ sorry . 
  i think some clarification on what [ academic ] means would be useful . 
  i 've seen some people use it for school assignments , while others use [ casual ] for the same purpose . 
  which is more appropriate ? 
  maybe we could use a tag specifically for that purpose ? 
  but anyway , i like the system on the whole . 
  p.s. , your examples do n't conform to the official format , which is, 
   [ tag ] topic ( demo ), 
  you used, 
   [ tag ] topic [ demo ], 
  square brackets each time , rather than using standard brackets for the second one .

  i have to do this in some applications . 
  i type using the dvorak keyboard layout , which is just so much better than qwerty , but makes common keyboard shortcuts awkward to use ( because z , x , c , and v are in less convenient locations for one-handed shortcuts ) . 
  so i use a layout that actually switches back to qwerty while cmd is held down so shortcuts can be used as normal . 
  unfortunately dinner programmes ( microsoft office and sibelius are the worst offenders that i use regularly ) have really odd behaviour with that layout and will sometimes do what i expect , and sometimes work how they would in a straight dvorak layout . 
  it 's really frustrating , so i end up right clicking or using the menu . 
  it 's called the normal left handed way . 
  about as useful as the sharp edge that comes in glad wrap rolls . 
  i 'd rather downvote and ignore , generally . 
  that way less people see it because it 's lower down and may even be collapsed by default . 
  but for the love of god do n't give them attention by commenting . 
  psh he said it 's something he 'd * never * dinner before . 
  ca n't you read ? 
  / oblivious, 
   what do they gain , except some 0.5 % of check-deposit overhead ? 
  i 'm not american and do n't know how things work over there , but if depositing cheques has a fee for the recipient , even a seemingly small one , you bet they want to be able to waive that .

  i 'm not seeing any animation with the upvote button ... 
  edit : just realised it only works on posts , not comments . 
   it 's poor programming, 
  i feel like that 's an unfair way to put it . 
  the programming is fine . 
  it does exactly what it 's supposed to do . 
  it 's just that `` what it 's supposed to do '' is something that was poorly thought out . 
  yeah , it 's working for me just fine now . 
  must have failed to load earlier . 
  i remember getting a heap of gold from rune running . 
  someone would give me a bunch of gold and some noted rune essence , which i would then take to the bank and get transferred into actual rune essence to take back to the other person , would would exchange it for more gold and more noted rune essence . 
  i was basically their mule , but hey , free and easy gp . 
  spyro also had a large head cheat you could use . 
  i think it 's a fairly common easter egg to include . 
  for context , it 's a buddhist monk in saigon , vietnam ( or south vietnam , since it took place while the two were still separated ) . 
  he burned himself in protest of the persecution of buddhists in the country . 
  i believe that his protest was successful , as it sparked protests that eventually led to the overturning of that government .
