  [ they 're in the list .

  have we got a problem with net neutrality ? 
  i ca n't say i 've heard anything about it here . 
  we 've got the nbn issue , but that 's completely unrelated . 
   i 'd almost start to use bing . 
  well , the good news is you do n't have to , since google is also in on this . 
  regarding the flash thing , apple blocked it because it would have been a battery hog and a security risk , just like it was on android until android stopped supporting it . 
  they did n't even * have * an app store at first , and yet flash was still not available at that time . 
  flash was a bad platform for the future , and it needed to die . 
  partly thanks to apple , it largely has . 
  android 's what ? 
  exactly . 
  these companies want to be able to provide the best service they can . 
  under the current environment , where anti net-neutrality actions are being allowed , that means that they need to do these deals . 
  there 's nothing to suggest that they would be doing them anyway if the service was guaranteed to be unhindered otherwise . 
  cheers . 
  a couple of things about wikipedia . 
  one is that they are * extremely * non-political . 
  they took action on sopa , but that was a completely unprecedented move , and even then there was a significant amount of debate as to whether they should , and to what extent they should . 
  the other is that i do n't really think they * would * be affected by net neutrality all that much . 
  what we mean by net neutrality in this case is simply whether or not some sites need to pay more money to get higher speed connections to their customers . 
  wikipedia does n't need very much bandwidth , because their pages are just text and a few small pictures . 
  it also is n't competing with anything that would cause providers to * want * to limit access to it , in the same way netflix or skype compete with tv and phone services , respectively . 
  he definitely is outside of america . 
  i 've only really heard of bill nye from reading nostalgic americans talk about him , and from that debate a few months back . 
  i 'm just hypothesising here , but if the drugs are produced in their country , they probably want to stop that . 
  preventing people from getting drugs overseas where they can be bought is one way to cut down on how much is produced . 
  it also , i imagine , is good for the countries ' external image : that they 're not simply allowing criminals to run rampant through their country . 
  bittorrent is a protocol , but there is also a company , [ bittorrent inc. ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bittorrent_ ( company \\ ) ), 
  they developed the protocol , and more obviously they develop a few of the biggest clients , namely bittorrent and \u00b5torrent . 
  hahaha , g ` day again . 
  edit : i just realised . 
  we signed up for reddit within less than a month of one another . 
  hahaha , indeed we do . 
  that 's creepy . 
  which , when you think about it from a worldbuilding perspective , is a * terrible * idea . 
  if you actually lived in tamriel , monsters would n't get stronger as you get stronger . 
  no , there would be some enemies that are a certain strength , and others that are much stronger . 
  this is one aspect that eso gets * really * right . 
  it is . 
  right under dropbox and above tumblr in that list . 
  the us fcc has already decided that isps must provide some sort of access to all legal sites . 
  they would n't be allowed to do what you describe . 
  eh , that has n't been my experience at all . 
  it 's got a story and individual character building every bit as strong as skyrim 's . 
  the quests are exactly the same quality , which is excellent , and the combat is quite similar to that of oblivion ( with respect to the spell bar ) crossed with skyrim ( in the way m\u00eal\u00e9e and archery work ) , with a few of its own bonuses , like clearly marked areas for aoe attacks . 
  it really does n't feel like the other mmos that i 've played in the past . 
  i 've never once had to grind in the least . 
  in fact , i 've frequently been worried that i could level up too far that completing quests would feel too easy . 
  that 's not happened , though , thankfully , i 've never been more than 1 or 2 levels higher than the recommended level for the quest . 
   hit the nail right on the head . 
  there 's some good ol' freudian penis envy . 
  4chan can be mighty dicks when they want , but you have to hand them one thing : they really care about their internet rights . 
  do n't forget , they were also one of the bug sites involved in the sopa protest stuff . 
  ah fair enough . 
  i 've not experienced veteran ranks to be able to comment on them . 
  they 're ugly by today 's standards , but they looked really nice compared to the palms and blackberrys that were out at the time . 
  julian assange is australian ... 
  i mean , looking at him , i can see why one might think he looked scandinavian , and his legal trouble is due to something that may or may not have happened when he was in sweden , so i guess it 's not that bad a mistake to make . 
  personally i 've always * hated * the ux with non-touch ipods . 
  the scrollwheel just never felt like a natural way to input controls to the device . 
  at the time of the initial release of the ipod , other companies * did n't * offer better products . 
  the ipod had a much better balance of skip protection , battery life , and number of songs held than anything on the market when it was released . 
  later , better products came around from competitors , but the ipod already had the brand recognition by then , so it stayed popular . 
  definitely true , but none of that is responsible for its popularity in the eyes of the majority of people . 
  sapphires come in ever colour ? 
  deltora quest lied to me . 
  yeah that 's why i was careful to say ux rather than ui . 
  got ta give it to them , the menu system apple used is pretty damn intuitive . 
  my problem with adding words to the dictionary is that mine seems to just randomly forget them after a while . 
  i find myself having to re-add words that i know i 've added before . 
  plus the damn thing ca n't spell words right . 
  always wanting color rather than colour ( etc. 
  ) , even though my language is n't set to us english . 
  dat game centre ( or whatever it 's called ) felt . 
   and while i really have to do something to demonstrate it , it is there, 
  for me and a friend of mine ( we both have nexus 4s ) there seems to be a really bad problem with the power button , which one could argue is an input lag , and a really serious one at that . 
  problem is the * objects * are still coloured . 
  the arrow still wears a green hood , and the canary is dressed in black . 
  it could be the lantern with a green lantern . 
  i 'm taking this way too seriously . 
  oh god of course . 
  there 's no damn s in deltora , is there ... 
  as / u/bartleby42c said , the different miles is n't really a problem . 
  what * is * a problem is things where the us measurement and the uk measurement are different , such as all the liquid measurements ( gallons , pints , fluid ounces , etc. 
  1 yard is actually 0.9144 metres ( exactly -- that 's actually what the yard is defined as today ) , so much closer to 0.9 m. thus an american football field is only ~ 90 m ( as opposed to , say , a rugby code field , which is 100 m ) . 
  other types of football ( like soccer or afl ) do n't necessarily have fixed length fields . 
  * [ the butterfly effect ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ), 
  * [ sliding doors ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120148/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ), 
  * [ mr. nobody ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ), 
  a few fantastic films exploring the butterfly effect/chaos theory , if anyone 's interested . 
  i 've also heard [ run lola run ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827/?ref_=ttawd_awd_tt ) is suposed to be really good , though i 've not seen it myself yet . 
  most likely he put the \\ in , but reddit took it as an escape character . 
  becomes, 
  so you need to escape the slash , by putting another slash :, 
  becomes, 
  do n't buy all of them . 
  buy like 20 bitcoins early on , and sell when it reaches its peak of ~ $ 1200 . 
  [ which comic is it this happens in ?
