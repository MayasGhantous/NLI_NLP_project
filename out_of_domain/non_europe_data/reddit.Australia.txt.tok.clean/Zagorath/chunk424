  i 've read the promise and the search , but i do n't remember that part . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  per cubic metre , i think you 'll find . 
  square metres are for area . 
  but definitely , your point still stands . 
  with all due respect , i totally disagree . 
  if someone completely alters the premise of someone 's argument , but still reaches the same conclusion , that 's still changing their view . 
  especially if the user explains why their original premise is a flawed one . 
  to take abortion as an example , i might respond :, 
  whether or not the bible says it is ok is n't important , because many people in the world do not hold the bible as fact or subscribe to its views , and universally imposing any morals based on that is wrong . 
  however , i do agree [ just a note here , this is just my hypothetically wanting to agree with the conclusion without agreeing to the premise , not me stating my actual views ] that abortion is wrong because it is killing a living human being and killing human beings is wrong . 
  to me , that should be a perfectly valid response . 
  sure , it reaches the same conclusion , but it fundamentally changes the perspective of the op in the example . 
  not quite . 
  the fallacy fallacy is making the assumption that because the user made a mistake ( or , more properly , used a logical fallacy ) , their entire argument is incorrect . 
  but in these cases , that is n't quite what happens . 
  instead , the responders generally see that the user has made a mistake and simply correct that one mistake , and say that this has `` changed their view '' in a minor way . 
  which is totally correct , just not really in the spirit of this subreddit . 
  that 's a fantastic photo -- brilliant composition -- but the animals at machu picchu are indeed llamas . 
  i ca n't really find a better source than [ this one ] ( http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/peru/machu-picchu/your-machu-picchu-photos/ ) `` llamas ... are a common sight at machu picchu . 
  '' , but i can also add my own memories from being there two years ago . 
  not american ips , just government ones , like in the op . 
   my least favourite episode to date, 
  really ? 
  i mean , it was far from great , but it 's worse than the puppet episode ? 
  ^ ^ * do n't * ^ ^ * give * ^ ^ * them * ^ ^ * ideas *, 
   they even could do the nathan fillion thing and just coast on the accrued nerd-worship for decades, 
  that seems really unfair to me . 
  he 's hardly coasting on the cult-popularity of firefly , really . 
  in fact , i would say he 's far more well known today as richard castle from castle . 
  huh ? 
  did you mean to quote something other than just `` bill '' ? 
  [ twits ] ( http://twit.tv/ ) ? 
  ( but seriously , it 's tweets . ), 
  how many of his symphonies have you tried ? 
  many of them are pretty tough , but i 'd say [ his first symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvujzc3n2qs&amp;list=plf1b47817cad63f50 ) is really easy to get in to . 
  but the currency is still the won . 
  \ucc9c or cheon literally just means 1,000 . 
  conspiracy theory : the government and b&j conspired deliberately in this to increase sales of b&j . 
  woolies is one of australia 's biggest grocery chains . 
  it 's completely unrelated to the company that used to exist in the us and uk , and still has a small presence in germany , austria , mexico , and south africa . 
  blockbusters is in much the same position here as it is in the us . 
  they still exist , they 're just really damn rare . 
  i know of one in my city , and it 's the third largest city in the country . 
  a quick check of their store locator and i can find two more that are apparently still around . 
  we 're letting the american businessmen win . 
  yes , the australian government * is * losing the plot , but this particular issue is n't the australian government , it 's the queensland one -- which is also losing the plot . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/business/coles-outperforms-woolies--again-20130418-2i1ju.html ) seems to imply that coles is bigger . 
  i could n't find many decent sources , though . 
  you can hardly count parties like rise up australia . 
  they get minuscule amounts of votes and media attention . 
  anyone can form a party , but to actually consider them in conversations like this one they 'd need to be at least somewhat successful . 
  bnp and fn have significantly more exposure and mindshare in their respective countries , but both also have relatively low voter results -- more akin to our family first . 
  i ca n't comment on golden dawn , i do n't know anything about them . 
  ah fair enough . 
  i was mainly speaking for brisbane , though i had assumed it would be the same elsewhere . 
  thing is , the north korean won is a different currency to the south korean won ( similar to how the australian dollar is different to the us dollar ) . 
  it 's at around 130 to the dollar , instead of a little over 1,000 . 
  sk has 100 won coins ( they were fairly common when i was living there in 2007 ) , and even rarely 50 won . 
  considering the value of kpw is around 10 times that of krw , it makes sense that they would have lower denominations . 
  ( and that 's without taking into account purchasing power , which i would imagine is much , much higher ) . 
   when it come into contact with regular matter , it releases measurable amounts of energy, 
  you sure about that ? 
  as far as i knew , dark matter does n't interact with `` normal '' matter at all . 
  there could be heaps of it in your room right now and you 'd have no way of knowing . 
  the only way it does interact is gravitationally . 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl6znhiqp9a ) . 
  you sure you 're not thinking of antimatter ? 
  yeah that would definitely make sense . 
  alchemy bitch . 
   you can do that if everyone on earth apart from one guy cares about you, 
  you can do it for any case ever . 
  it 's trivial to say that ! x & & x = = 0 . 
  if p ! = np , but integer factorisation could be quickly solved , could encryption not just move to a different type of problem ? 
  if yes , then i wonder what sort of problems they could use . 
  his solution still works for p = 0 . 
  it 's just that with p = 0 , the equation is true for any real number n. 
  [ here it is on the web ] ( http://harmontown.com/podcast ) . 
  [ here is the itunes link ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/harmontown/id542228532?mt=2 ) . 
  you can probably find it in any podcatcher 's search feature . 
  i 'd recommend [ pocket casts by shifty jelly ] ( http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts ) , on either [ ios ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8 ) or [ android ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts ) . 
  well duh . 
  the above answer was a joke response , pretending they 're simply variables . 
  i just continued the joke . 
  if youtube videos are the only problem , you can watch an age-restricted video by changing, 
  in other words , change the / watch?v = to / v / . 
  it 's not a great solution , but at least you 'll be able to watch the videos . 
  as a side note , if you ca n't get a more permanent fix , it 'll only be two more years before your account is aged 18 anyway . 
  aww but crimson would leave them room for [ a clever dc reference ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimson ) . 
  ( wikipedia 's definition of the perfect crimson is #dc 143c . ), 
  i have n't bothered keeping my collection organised at all in quite a while , but when i did , i had a method i quite liked . 
  i let itunes sort the actual file structure , but i kept its metadata meticulously correct according to my rules . 
  the composer 's name would go in the `` artist '' section . 
  for multi-movement works ( e.g. 
  symphonies ) the name of the whole work would go as the `` album '' name . 
  other details about the piece ( the title for the movement -- usually a number and the tempo ) would be the individual `` song '' titles . 
  i 'd put the conductor and orchestra in the notes or extra section , whatever it was called . 
  what do you do for borderline era pieces ? 
  where would beethoven symphony no . 
  how about symphony no .
