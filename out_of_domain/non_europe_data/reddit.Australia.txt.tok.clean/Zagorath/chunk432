  the last episode of the third season of the uk version has a massive spoiler in it , although i 'm really not sure if the us version will match it . 
  [ here 's one guy 's theory on how he wants it to end ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/houseofcards/comments/2025s4/does_anyone_else_just_want_to_see_frank_win/ ) ( no spoilers in the op -- potential spoilers in the comments ) . 
  his idea is really different from how the uk version ended , but quite frankly i can see it going either way , and working really well . 
  main point being , watching the uk version could be a * potential * spoiler , but there 's absolutely no guarantee that they will end it in the same way . 
  bang bang, 
  ninjaedit : seriously , i knew exactly what was coming , but actually seeing it still gave me awesome chills . 
  and sauron/the necromancer . 
  i had seen the downey jr film before i heard of the tv show , and then when i heard of it , my first thought was `` oh god , not another modern recreation of sherlock holmes . 
  i 'm sure it 'll be equally terrible . '', 
  it put me off watching the show for so long , because i just thought there was no way it could be good . 
  i 'm so glad i eventually allowed myself to get talked into watching it . 
  god it 's such a great show . 
  it 's not quite as good ( apart from s02e7-8 ) , but legend of korra is a show about the next avatar in the cycle , and it 's definitely worth watching . 
  there are also a series of comics that take place in between the two shows . 
  * the promise ( parts 1 -- 3 ) is the first of these , and describes the situation immediately after the events of avatar . 
  aang has to decide how to deal with the fire colonies in the earth kingdom -- some of which have now been around for over 100 years . 
  * the search ( parts 1 -- 3 ) follows on from the promise , and details zuko 's search for his mum ( spoiler alert : he finds her at the end , and it 's amazing ) . 
  * the rift ( part 1 is out already ) is about the building of republic city ( the main location for legend of korra ) and is also meant to be about toph 's relationship with her parents . 
  eh ... it 's definitely weaker than the original , but i would n't say it sucks by any means . 
  imo it 's worth it just for zuko 's character development . 
  almost everyone would agree it 's not * as * good , but i think most fans of the original would also really enjoy korra . 
  if nothing else , it 's worth putting up with the whole thing ( even on the off chance you ca n't stand it ) just to get to episodes 7 and 8 of season 2 , because they were as good as or possibly better than most of the original show . 
  definitely . 
  i watched it as a kid , but only really a few episodes here and there , and almost exclusively from the first season . 
  i rewatched it when i was older , in order , and still absolutely loved it . 
  the storyline is awesome , if predictable . 
  it 's a coming-of-age story of sorts , with heavy elements ( heh , see what i did there ? ), 
  of morality and deciding what 's right or wrong . 
  a bucketload of symbolism if you 're looking for it , too , all absolutely masterfully executed . 
  particularly powerful , i think , is the arc that zuko ( the main antagonist in season 1 ) goes through . 
  i wo n't say any more than that , but i think his character development is one of the best i 've seen in tv . 
  ca n't really say what i 'd compare it to . 
  there are only a small number of animated shows that i 've watched all the way through ( young justice and dreamworks dragons -- which i just finished tonight -- are the only two that i can think of right now , and i would n't say it 's very similar to either of those , though perhaps one could say it has a few aspects in common with the latter . 
  the movie is * universally * ( and i mean this literally : i have not come across a single person who watched the movie after liking the show , and also had anything positive to say about the movie ) despised among fans of the show . 
  try and get at least 4 episodes in if you can , it has a fairly slow start . 
  if it does n't grab you after that , it probably wo n't . 
  way too overacted most of the time . 
  avatar has quite a few childish moments in it , but they 're only small moments . 
  on the whole , it 's a really great show . 
  avatar is n't an anime , either . 
  it has a few elements borrowed from anime , but does n't have the same flaws , imo . 
   frances 's dad, 
  let 's all call him that from now on . 
  having said that , while i consider that dynamic to be equivalent , i think overall the two shows are largely incomparable . 
  they just feel like they have completely different moods to them , to the point that when watching the uk version ( after the us one ) , i rarely found myself attempting to compare them in my mind they way i have with many other shows . 
  i like them both , and i really ca n't say i prefer one . 
   aww man ~ ~ palestine and israel ~ ~ the world needs a bit of what you guys show here :(, 
  ftfy, 
  why not both ? 
  why not both of them ? 
  to be fair , i had seen the us version first , so this obviously influenced my perception of it , but i found the way they did particular scene in the us version was so much more shocking . 
  to be fair , in australia they probably would n't want you bringing in legit flour ( or flower , for that matter ) either . 
  first thing i did when i read your description text was google lifeline to see if they use the same number internationally , because i was surprised to see the australian number used . 
  shoulda just looked at the actual survey url . 
  hello fellow uq student !, 
  anyway , some tips for your survey :, 
  it 's generally advised on this subreddit to include an `` other '' option for gender . 
  the term `` aboriginal '' is * generally * understood to mean australian aboriginal , however it is * somewhat * ambiguous . 
  it would be helpful , since you 're sharing this with an international audience , to specify that you explicitly mean australian aboriginal . 
  as far as i know , tafe is a largely australian thing . 
  other countries will use different words for that kind of thing . 
  it could be helpful to clarify what is meant by tafe . 
  i must also say , the questions on the third page felt very leading . 
  my understanding ( though i 'm not a psychology student ) is that this should generally be avoided . 
  i do n't think `` affecionate '' is a word . 
   if a girl acts like a slut , eventually she is going to get into trouble . 
  this question bugs me . 
  there are two distinct ways of interpreting this question . 
  one is the way people think things * are * ( i.e. , do i believe it is likely that a girl who acts like a `` slut '' is likely to get in to trouble ) and the other is how i think things * should be * ( i.e. , do i believe it is fair that a girl who acts like a `` slut '' will get into trouble ) . 
  my own answers for the two are opposite each other . 
  i answered assuming the former , since it is the more literal interpretation . 
   a lot of times , girls who claim they were raped have emotional problems . 
  similar kind of problem . 
  is it that emotional problems are the reason they claim to be raped , or is it that they have emotional problems because they were raped ? 
  i assumed the former is what was intended . 
  still , it 's ( imo ) an important area of research , and i wish you luck with your study . 
  ninjaedit : you might want to consider x-posting to / r/uqreddit , or possibly subreddits related to men 's or women 's rights/issues , like the newly-defaulted / r/twoxchromosomes . 
  people should move to using something that can more accurately portray a variety of political opinions . 
  it 's not perfect , but the [ political compass ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/ ) does a great job of separating the most common political ideologies by plotting it on a 2-axis graph , with the x-axis being economic views and the y-axis being social views . 
  as a non-european , i was confused for a few seconds before i reconsidered it and realised it was referring to 25 % of votes within france . 
  not quite . 
  it 's a particular type of sun cream that people usually only put under their eyes that does n't rub in .

  online video . 
  not that i mind , they 've always done a spectacular job of it all , if you ask me . 
  i 'm just curious , does the bbc * really * lean left ? 
  i know that 's a common accusation against the abc here , but in fact studies show they lean slightly right to make up for the perceived bias . 
  [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/s2bqz/howto_update_the_witcher_enhanced_edition_engine/ ) was extremely helpful , but a bit out of date . 
  i pmed the op of that thread , and he linked me to [ this page ] ( http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php?page=downloads ) as a replacement for the wineskin stuff . 
  i used ws8wine1 .5.0 and the most up-to-date `` wrapper version '' . 
  i just realised , though , that i was doing this on mountain lion . 
  i do n't remember now whether i 've tried it on mavericks or not . 
  i 'll give that a go now and get back to you . 
  yeah , it still seems to be working for me . 
  i opened it up and played a few minutes , including talking to someone and fighting a small group , and it was all going just fine . 
  do n't really have the time right now to try it any longer than that .
