  but in the movies , their characters * were n't * very developed . 
  for the sake of simplicity , jackson focused on the ring plot as his primary plot , and aragorn 's ascension to the throne of gondor as his secondary plot . 
  he pretty much left out everything else . 
  scouring of the shire is the conclusion to a plot line that was left out of the movies , so it would n't have made sense to put the conclusion in . 
  it 's in the sixth book of what is often erroneously called a trilogy , but is in fact a single novel consisting of six books and appendices , sometimes published in three editions . 
  i paraphrase the forward to my single-volume edition of lotr . 
  but surely a university degree would supersede that ? 
  not to mention i 'd be pretty surprised if you could n't get away with using your ib diploma in place of some other high school certificate . 
  aragorn dying valiantly in battle would have been a complete fuck you to the lord of the rings as a novel . 
  aragorn 's growth from ranger to king is one of the most important arcs in the novel . 
  and in jackson 's movie as it stands now , it 's the second of two major plot lines . 
  to have aragorn die would be to fundamentally change the direction of the entire story . 
  no , if bean were to play aragorn he would simply have had to have a role where he does n't die . 
  [ i just thought you might like to watch this series of videos ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnkvlk3bflw&amp;list=plmuts78zxryo9nku_cem-lhcnsnac2khv ) . 
  edit : so , i originally posted this because i genuinely thought this would be of general interest for you . 
  but i 've just been watching them , and i think in particular videos 4 and 5 work as an argument against what you 've been saying in this thread . 
  nope . 
  most of my friends only did ib and that was enough to get accepted into a bunch of different unis in the us . 
  is n't he australian ? 
  but anyway , i also have n't heard of the jungle . 
  the phrase also exists outside of chicago bears and community . 
  it 's just a general english idiom . 
  [ here 's one random article i found using it ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/drier-weather-will-only-fuel-larger-more-frequent-fires/5034654 ) . 
  for that matter , i 'm pretty sure `` streets ahead '' is also a relatively common idiom . 
  most of the uses i can easily find online are real estate puns , but i found a few that were n't . 
  [ here 's one article that i found using it ] ( http://splash.abc.net.au/media/-/m/526985/bike-use-in-europe-is-streets-ahead ) ( i promise it 's a complete coincidence that it comes from the same website as the previous one ) . 
  what 's that do ? 
  it seems kinda dumb to me that a character without parents would be making jokes about the death of someone else 's father figure ... 
  i 'm gon na go ahead and assume `` uncle ben '' is a brand of rice ? 
  if not , could you explain that comment to me ? 
  cheers !, 
  ah right , thanks !, 
  you sure that 's official ? 
  why would n't they be using the uq.edu.au domain ? 
  i submitted an assignment last week that required a bunch of files in a zip file . 
  you lose 5 % if they are n't * directly * in the zip file , no subfolders allowed . 
  i realised with less than two minutes until the deadline that the version i had uploaded had all the files within one folder , which was directly in the zip file . 
  managed to get the fixed version up in time , but got that was a mini-panic attack when i noticed it . 
  / minor rant, 
   via support of an organisation, 
  my , my . 
  that does sound * ominous * . 
  thanks tone, 
   is there any * why * to cancel the mouse acceleration ? 
  [ emphasis mine ], 
  being facetious here , but imo the answer is no . 
  playing with mouse acceleration is n't objectively better , it 's a matter of personal preference . 
  and personally , i find the experience much more natural with it on . 
  being unfacetious , as far as i 'm aware , the only way to effectively remove it if you 're really insistent on getting rid of it , is by using third party tools . 
  [ this one ] ( http://triq.net/articles/mouse-acceleration-preference-pane-mac-os-x ) comes recommended from [ this thread ] ( https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2552369?start=150&amp;tstart=0 ) . 
  [ this thread ] ( http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=361844 ) suggests a terminal command you can use , but other users point out that it may also set mouse speed unusably low . 
  oh fair enough . 
  nah mate , if you tried it in australia all that 'd happen is the speaker would tell you to shut the fuck up . 
  maybe kick you out . 
  pal is 25 frames per second . 
  films are typically 24 frames per second . 
  vlc is open source and ( more importantly ) cross-platform . 
  no mpc-hc for os x or linux . 
  vlc  mpc-hc easily . 
  it 's easier to adjust the settings across multiple computers to keep them the same , due to the layout of the menu being the same . 
  it 's just generally a nicer experience to be able to use the same programme everywhere . 
  but another one for those stuck with * only * windows , that i just noticed . 
  unfortunately , mpc does n't have a windows 8 metro app , which means no ability to snap a video to the side of the screen for convenient multitasking . 
  regarding 3 , one thing that i 've found really helps is when someone else fingers the keys , and i just blow a constant volume of air . 
  this helps you realise that in order to make that break , you need to not adjust your breath . 
  it 's an instinctive thing to do , but you need to avoid it . 
  try finding someone who can do this for you . 
  if not , just practise long tones , and then try to keep the same long tones going , but just change your fingers around . 
  i think he 's conflating the term libertarian as it is used on the political compass with the term libertarian as it is typically used in ( especially us ) politics regarding libertarian parties . 
  libertarian parties are generally what the pc would call libertarian-right . 
  the greens , of course , are libertarian-left . 
  indeed it does let you do that . 
  the keys are j and k , though . 
  interesting read . 
  definitely no spoilers , in case anyone 's worried . 
  it only describes the method that they use . 
  the full interview that is linked to from this article may contain spoilers , though . 
  i have n't read it yet . 
  yeah thanks , i already saw it in the podcast . 
  it 's true . 
  if you look at it in photoshop , frame 10 is the centre one . 
  9 and 11 are identical , 8 and 12 , etc. 
  up until 1 being the same as frame 19 ( the last frame ) . 
  oh right !, 
  that helped clarify it for me . 
  i did n't realise that your use of | x | was for `` magnitude of x '' . 
  no you see , because everyone would just hire ~ ~ bodyguards ~ ~ * protection agencies * to protect them , so this would n't be possible . 
  if you 're poor enough that you ca n't afford to hire someone to protect you , then it 's probably for the best that you be sold into slavery . 
   rugby is handegg anyway, 
  god i 'm sick of this shit . 
  1 ) the oxford english dictionary defines a ball as `` a solid or hollow spherical *** or egg-shaped *** object that is kicked , thrown , or hit in a game '' ( emphasis mine ) . 
  2 ) the `` foot '' part of football is because it 's played * on foot * . 
  as opposed to being played on horseback . 
  and not because the ball is hit with the feet . 
  rugby , american football , afl , gaelic football , etc. 
  are all very much football . 
  personally , i prefer not to call * any * sport `` football '' , because it 's ambiguous . 
  depending on who you 're talking to they might think you mean soccer , one of the rugby codes , afl , american football , or something else . 
  if you call everything by its specific name , there can never be that confusion . 
  instead , use the term `` football '' in a generic way , when describing something that applies to * all * of the above sports .
