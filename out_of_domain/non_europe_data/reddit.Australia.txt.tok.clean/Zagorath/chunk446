  what matters to most people is how much it will help them get into/cope with university . 
  if you 're going to the uk , ib is quite seriously underrated as far as entrance requirements go , and so it will definitely be easier to get in to what programme you want with a levels . 
  but then , because of the difficulty of ib , you will definitely be able to adjust to uni much more easily . 
  my teachers said at the time that ib is harder than first year uni unless you 're doing medicine or engineering , and from what i 've seen that seems to be accurate . 
  the benefits that ib gives are , in my opinion , worth the extra effort and difficulty in 90 % of cases . 
  now you know the * real * reason australia got rid of their 1 cent coin . 
  two ** thousand ** ping ? 
  is n't that , like , a whole two * seconds * delay ? 
  as a community fan , the fear is that such bad treatment will lead to a premature cancellation . 
  aww man you just made me sad about young justice again ... 
  comment history suggests canadian . 
   btw its pronuced with a hard g sound, 
  he says , right after claiming to be avoiding lighting the flame . 
  the creator pronounces it with a soft g . the soft g also matches the word most close to it , which is gin . 
  the argument most often made for hard g is that it stands for `` graphics '' . 
  to that i point out that the u in scuba is not pronounced like the u in underwater , and the same is true for many other acronyms . 
  what letter it stands for is irrelevant . 
  and , personally , soft g gif just sounds much more pleasing . 
  for those reasons , i will always pronounce it with a soft g , and will attempt to get others to do the same . 
  however , both are accepted pronunciations , so really neither is * wrong * , per se . 
  the u in scuba is not pronounced like the u in underwater , and the same is true for many other acronyms . 
  what letter it stands for is irrelevant .

  the u in scuba is not pronounced like the u in underwater , and the same is true for many other examples ( nasa , nato , laser , and aids are the first to come to mind ) . 
  clearly it is you who does not understand acronyms .

  you probably made the same mistake i made at first , and did n't scroll down . 
  facebook javascript is in there because they 've used facebook 's share button . 
  you probably learnt this from cgp grey 's video . 
  he was wrong . 
  kinda . 
  the animal he talked about is one of many given the name `` daddy long-legs '' . 
  here in australia , and many other places , the term refers to * pholcus phalangioides * , which is a spider . 
  [ grey did a followup video on the matter , here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jk2dr8ei5e ) . 
  not really sure about for pre-paid , but if i were getting a new plan today i 'd definitely be going for amaysim . 
  vaya used to offer an awesome plan , which i 'm currently on , but their current offers are much less appealing . 
  for what it 's worth , i ca n't see any reason that 4g would n't work . 
  the nexus 5 supports 4g , and the major telcos here also do ( though many of the cheaper ones like amaysim do n't ) . 
  one thing i 've wondered about double dissolutions . 
  senators sit for 6 years at a time , that 's two elections . 
  half of them are being reelected each time . 
  when there 's a double dissolution , everyone has to be reelected at once . 
  so how do they get back to an alternating cycle ? 
  presumably half the senators will just have a 3 year term , but which half ? 
  not really that surprising . 
  i do the same ( or similar ) very frequently when watching tv . 
  i connect my mac to the tv with hdmi , and connect via ssh from my android phone to enable me to adjust the volume and pause the show as necessary . 
  ( note , i do n't think this app is using ssh , but i 'm not entirely sure . ), 
  just an fyi , from my experience that seems to be a very american thing . 
  here in australia , and from what i can gather from european friends , we do n't ever call university `` school '' . 
  even more obvious is this , in response to `` where do you live ?!? '', 
  small town in canada ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/25dn3c/when_my_substitute_history_teacher_claims_the/chg8lae?context=3 ), 
  but that requires adding in extra sounds . 
  most importantly , t is quite a hard sound . 
  gif and gin are similar in that both n and f are quite soft . 
  it 's hardly rigorous phonology ( n being nasal and f being fricative ) , but i think most people could generally agree that t is a hard sound while n and f are both softer . 
  again ? 
  looks like brisbane was included this time , too . 
  no it would n't , because that 's not how acronyms work . 
   but because the resulting word seems it would naturally use a hard g, 
  i very strongly disagree with this , as does everyone else who pronounces it gif . 
  ( edit : this should have read `` everyone else who pronounces it with a soft g '' . 
  i just wrote out gif because that 's how it came out in my head . 
  gif with a soft g. ), 
  we all like to argue over reasoning and justification , but fundamentally most of us pronounce gif how we first naturally pronounced it in our heads when we read it . 
  for me ( and , again , many others ) , that was with a soft g. 
  when i first saw someone writing about gif images , i naturally just read it as a soft g , because to me it seemed the more logical way of reading it . 
  you reading it with a hard g is n't * wrong * , per se , but you claiming that your way of pronouncing it is definitively better * is * . 
  yes . 
  because phonology is very similar to maths . 
  oh interesting . 
  that certainly does seem like the most logical way of going about it . 
  thanks for the information !, 
  that 's opinion . 
  i find soft-g gif rolls off the tongue far better . 
  that 's part of the reason i pronounce it that way in the first place . 
  the same reason there 's a g in giraffe ... 
  while the gene wilder film is fantastic , i can see why dahl would n't have liked it . 
  it felt -- to me , at least -- as though it was n't interested at all in keeping the essence of the original book . 
  it certainly told the same story , but it kinda changed the entire mood of it . 
  i just watched that on youtube . 
  what the hell did they do that for . 
  i do n't know anything about the chinese , but living in vietnam i found that the majority of vietnamese ( those not strongly exposed to the west , such as those who went to my international school ) are fairly apolitical . 
  they are n't pro-democratic at all , they just do n't care . 
  there are , of course , many reasons that the situation in hong kong and china may be very different , but i just thought i 'd put in my little anecdote . 
  as an australian i laugh at your voter turnouts . 
  voter turnouts in australia are usually mid-to-high 90 % s. 
  ( because we have compulsory voting . ), 
   oklahoma translates to `` land of the redskins , '', 
  very curious . 
  from what language has it been translated ? 
  send you a letter asking why . 
  if you ca n't provide a valid reason ( and as far as i 'm aware there are a lot of things that would be considered valid ) , there 's a small fine . 
  something like $ 20 . 
  still , that 's enough that the vast majority of people do show up , even if some hand in blank or spoiled ballots ( a tad under 6 % in the latest election ) . 
  honestly it is n't any more or less logical . 
  to me it sounds better , to you a hard g may sound better . 
  because pronunciation in the english language is so vague , neither is objectively more or less logical than the other . 
  g , like c , has two very common sounds , and this is a situation in which it is not necessarily clear which should be used . 
  thus , your reading is n't wrong , but you are wrong to claim that your way is definitively better .
