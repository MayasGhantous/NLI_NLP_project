  2 strikers , 1 control , 1 leader , 1 defender . 
  with 6 you 've got some more flexibility . 
  my party of six has 3 strikers , and it 's worked well . 
  i think you could also have an extra defender or an extra control . 
  but as others have said , really any composition should be doable with a good dm . 
  it 's worth pointing out that this is the incorrect response to a snake bite , anyway . 
  at best it 's ineffective , and at worst can actually be fatal . 
  instead , what 's known as the [ `` pressure immobilisation technique '' ] ( http://www.anaesthesia.med.usyd.edu.au/resources/venom/snakebite.html#firstaid ) should be used . 
  it makes sense not to call it now . 
  there 's a new senate coming in a week which will be much more favourable to them . 
  if they ca n't get the new senate to work with them on enough issues ( which is admittedly unlikely ) , then they may be forced to call a double dissolution . 
  not denying that . 
  that 's why i say it 's unlikely . 
  to be completely honest , it 's not very well known . 
  i suspect jeph just does n't know . 
  that makes me feel a little better at getting that one wrong . 
  i also got 12/15 . 
  i knew the transubstantiation one , but missed one of the us supreme court questions . 
  which , as a non-us citizen , i do n't feel bad about at all . 
  the question does specify catholicism . 
  nick there is right about one thing . 
  it is an interesting conversion . 
  may i ask how it came about ? 
  well of course it * is n't * literal . 
  you ca n't turn wine into blood . 
  but the official position of the catholic church is that it 's literal . 
  option-2 on os x \u2122 . 
  what the fuck ? 
  you ca n't buy things with a mastercard at the event ? 
  have you got a source for that , because that 's a pretty serious action to take . 
  wow . 
  that stuff should really be considered anti-competitive . 
  do you happen to know if they did that for the london olympics or the sochi winter olympics ? 
  ( or , while i 'm at it , sydney , athens , and beijing ? ), 
  seriously . 
  it 's the among most preventable types of cancer ( as is lung cancer ) . 
  avoid going out in the sun during the middle of the day , and always wear sun cream . 
  it 's not very hard . 
  that 's the one i used .

  just finished . 
  quality 's pretty terrible , but it 's all there . 
  just to clear any confusion , you are talking about ice hockey , right ? 
  because in field hockey left-handed sticks ( right hand on top ) are not allowed . 
  personally in most stick-based sports ( cricket , baseball , hockey , golf , etc. ), 
  i tend to hold them right handed . 
  if you live in europe , you may be able to use the new `` right to be forgotten '' laws to take care of this . 
  the laws themselves are terribly misguided , but it 's possible that you could use them here to make google remove the stuff . 
  on another note , could you just try filing a report again ? 
  assuming they do n't auto-deny it the second time , you might get a different person reviewing the case who will make the correct judgement . 
  your asaplive links seem to be throwing me an error . 
  yeah working now . 
  not sure i 'd call it a `` jazzy '' clarinet cover . 
  seemed pretty true to the original with the occasional little idiomatic flair . 
  still , as / u/triedtothrowthisaway said , it 's an excellent cover . 
  i was n't aware that areseholes were a thing . 
  is it like , holes of war ? 
  just a tip , whenever you use ipa it 's helpful to link to it for people that do n't already know it . 
  [ here 's a helpful link .

   the current carbon pricing is already set to become an ets, 
  this is what i really do n't get . 
  labor knew that this was the case . 
  it 's their damn policy . 
  and yet for 3 years they just sat there and let the liberals get away with calling it a `` carbon tax '' . 
  they made almost no effort to educate the public or to correct the media and the liberals on this point . 
  it 's just so damn stupid . 
  it was a test on the users . 
  to see if people bother reading messages . 
  that 's really what they should have done . 
  i 'm used to always waiting for the 720p version with arrow , so it was bound to be disappointing . 
  but you 're right , considering it 's a leak , we could have gotten much worse . 
  do n't forget alison and mad men . 
  turn it off and on again . 
  then turn it off , walk away from the computer , and never come back .

   the last airbender reminds the spectator of the pre-war crisis of masculinity through its juxtaposition of poverty and nature . 
   in order to pass legislation the government will need the support of 6 or more senators and in order to stop legislation and continue their efforts to destroy this country the alp will need the support of the greens and four other senators plus half a kilo of boiled new potatoes and a cup of grated gruyere cheese . 
  holy run-on sentence . 
   i could give a flying fuck, 
  pretty sure you meant \\* could n't \\* give a flying fuck here . 
  got ta be honest , i prefer mozart 's dies irae . 
  i 'm not a fan of much of mozart 's work , but his requiem is one of my absolute favourite pieces of choral music . 
  i 'm disappointed at how far down the thread i had to go for something classical . 
  but anyway , you should know at least the first line . 
  and as somebody suggested , here 's a link to [ the big ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh3gh7pn_ea ) . 
  i must say , i find that to be a really bizarre transliteration of `` hush '' . 
  it would be heo-swi or heo-shwi . 
  i would 've probably gone with \ud6c4\uc2a4 or \ud5c8\uc2a4 , who-sheu or heo-sheu , respectively . 
  ( note that `` eu '' is pronounced `` like m ** oo ** n , but with spread lips '' . ), 
  could be made * slightly * easier by playing the a # with the alternate fingering ( right hand second finger on the second trill key ) , but god damn that would be awful to play . 
  which is why they need to put in some serious penalties for doing it . 
  make it higher risk and prevent players from doing it . 
  that would go a long way to improving the sport in my eyes . 
  except that 's not an idiomatic expression . 
  the expression in english involves `` could n't '' . 
  some people have a habit of incorrectly saying `` could '' , but these people are in the minority and , quite frankly , do n't make sense . 
  a common rebuttal here is that `` it 's an idiom , it does n't need to make sense '' . 
  but the fact is that most idioms * do * make sense in some way , usually metaphorical , but sometimes more literal . 
  for the rest of it , [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7o0mfkmpw ) is both educational and entertaining .
