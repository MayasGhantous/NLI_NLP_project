  it has been described as darth vader 's theme `` deconstructed and written backwards '' . 
  that 's just one small example of taking some rather basic thematic material ( material that in this instance is basically a fusion of the main motif from mars and chopin 's funeral march ) , and doing something really cool with it , which is what i love about williams ' scores . 
  but the 12 labours are supposed to be a punishment for that , yet he did them in the movie . 
  clearly they 've changed that bit around . 
  firearms are n't banned at all . 
  there are enough exceptions that if one wants to get one it 's relatively easy . 
  however there are restrictions on the type , how they are stored , and of course you wo n't find people with severe mental illness able to easily get their hands on them . 
  pretty much . 
  to be fair , its audience reception was 31 % positive . 
  remember guys , [ no firing arrows into the brisbane river during g20 ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-30/17-objects-banned-from-brisbanes-g20-summit/5057354 ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ far ^ ^ ^ as ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ fine ^ ^ ^ any ^ ^ ^ other ^ ^ ^ time , ^ ^ ^ though . 
  it 's the way things are typically done on tumblr . 
  i do n't really know why , it 's an awful system . 
  i thought the grr was generally just about breaking your heart by killing people you care about . 
  your entire post was extremely well written . 
  good grammar and spelling , but then every time you mean to write `` through '' , you instead have `` thru '' . 
  it confuses me greatly . 
  my current character is a shardmind psion . 
  the key part of my backstory is that a shardslayer killed my mentor and the only person i cared for , as she prevented the shardslayer from killing me . 
  so i made it my mission to attempt to wipe out shardslayers . 
  we just wrapped up a campaign that ended with a member of our party -- another shardmind , a warlock -- betraying us after having planned for ages and building up an army of allies . 
  his character , we discovered , was a shardslayer . 
  the player that played that character is dming our next campaign , with his former pc as the bbeg ( or at least a major villain of some sort ) . 
  what precisely is it you want to do ? 
  hmm interesting . 
  is there any particular reason you ca n't use chrome 's built in custom search engines feature ? 
  i ca n't remember the exact title or research question , but it was a comparison of how the clarinet is used in mozart 's clarinet quintet and brahms ' clarinet quintet . 
  i do n't think they 're saying facebook * caused * their problems , only that it exacerbated existing ones . 
  that 's irrelevant to the ethics of the situation . 
  they may have , strictly speaking , given legal permission ( though in many places tos are not considered legally binding ) , but they sure as hell never gave informed consent to participate in this study . 
  what the fuck ? 
  i 'm not planning on going anywhere today , but if i were and i got booked i 'd be like : `` dude , no '' , and point out that it does n't start until tomorrow . 
  you sure it 's really working ? 
  mine will return a result , but if you look a little closer you 'll see that it 's suggesting you walk the whole way . 
  edit : that 's what my phone gives . 
  on my computer it just wo n't do anything . 
  `` sorry , we could not calculate transit directions from [ place ] to [ place ] . '', 
  you thought correctly . 
   catholics can fly, 
  brb going to get baptised . 
  yeah i had to open them each in a separate tab and flip between them to notice the difference . 
  the definite article is one of my favourite stand up routines . 
  i loved it at first . 
  for quite a bit longer than what you seem to have loved it . 
  i found the story so damn amazing i wanted to keep going to find out what 's going on . 
  but after a while i 've gotten to the point where i was just so sick of the combat , i 'm having to play it for only an hour or so at a time , because it 's just so dull . 
  i enjoy the story very much , so i want to finish it , but i do n't want to have to keep putting up with its actual mechanics in order to do so . 
  my version was n't through steam , so i 'm just estimating , but i think i 'm probably about 20 -- 30 hours in . 
  it 's the us , followed by a whole bunch of australia , followed by `` a '' , which represents canada . 
   mars , populated by two robots and one brave man . 
  would be a great quote if spoken by someone other than the person actually on mars . 
  if you said it it would sound pretentious . 
   earth has million of stories , the moon has thousands , mars only has one , ours . 
  i do n't get it . 
  could you explain ? 
  i 'm with / u/darwin57 . 
  `` my whole life has been one world , now it 's two . '', 
  is the best one . 
  why does the moon have thousands , then ? 
  and why is this mars 's first story ? 
  a few . 
  not even close to thousands . 
  besides , do rovers not count ? 
  some other subreddits have a message to the effect of `` discussions of illegal downloads are allowed , posting links is not '' in the sidebar . 
  maybe that would be a good idea here ? 
  it 's not something that was happening consciously , i 'm sure . 
  `` an australian you would n't want as prime minister . '', 
  no prizes for guessing the most-answered response to that one . 
  you should cross-post to / r/australia and the various city subreddits ( / r/brisbane , / r/sydney , / r/melbourne etc. ), 
  to get more respondents . 
  what was the response to that one like when it came out ? 
  ( genuine question . ), 
  parry , then faint . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ very ^ ^ ^ brave . 
  oh man i love some of goldsmith 's stuff !, 
  probably not all that surprising that he 's underrated , though . 
  he has n't really done much new stuff since the internet and social media came about . 
  112 would actually work in the us . 
  it 's the universal emergency number . 
  it also works in australia and the uk , which typically use 000 and 999 respectively . 
  and if glass is the only glasses a person has ? 
  the law frankly makes no sense . 
  a recording from glass would be worse than unusable , because nobody can keep their head straight and still for 90 minutes + . 
  maybe ban having glass off your head and pointed at the screen as you would a camera or a mobile phone . 
  but banning glass entirely is essentially discrimination . 
   the reason phones have n't been banned is because they 're used to contact others or be contacted by others . 
  incidentally , this is almost exactly why glass should not be banned either . 
  never mind all the legitimate things its technology can be used for , it 's essential a pair of glasses . 
  what if it 's the only pair of glasses someone has ? 
  are they now completely unable to watch films ? 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  dude be serious . 
  no film company is going to ever lose * any * money to google glass . 
  the video quality is crap , and nobody will be able to keep their head still enough for it to be even a little bit watchable . 
  film cams are usually terrible already , and this would be far worse . 
  besides , their usually made in east asia or russia . 
  the uk or us introducing these laws is going going to have zero impact on that . 
  looks good !, 
  it 's probably worth noting that for those in the us on a cdma network this wo n't work , since 112 is a gsm standard . 
  it certainly is universal outside of that relatively small number of people ( on a worldwide scale ) .
