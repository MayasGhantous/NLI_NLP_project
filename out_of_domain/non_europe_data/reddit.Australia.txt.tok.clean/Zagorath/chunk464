  she had been attacked by bandits ( possibly rapists ) on the highway . 
  a woman travelling alone is an easy target . 
   she managed to petrified some of them , but the others inflicted a mortal wound on her . 
   knowing she was going to die , she travelled back to her home , wrote the last note , and crawled up around the petrified body of the man she loved to die . 
   the party travelled back to where they found the people on the road . 
  they now know these people attacked her -- an innocent woman just walking along the highway -- and not , as they had claimed , the other way around . 
   the party proceeds to kill them . 
  hope that helps . 
  and basically any dslr or point and shoot since 2002 . 
  and a smartphone , with the right app . 
  actually it 's mega vs. milli , a 10 ^ 9 difference . 
  i disagree . 
  op has absolutely * no * responsibility to go and talk to the guy in person . 
  if mr penny is the kind of person to do something like this , he 's also probably the kind of person that would not * actually * respond in a polite way after being told face to face . 
  he 's just using that as justification for being an arsehole . 
  you can still do that with win8 . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , in this respect windows 8 is actually so much * better * than 7 , that when i saw your comment , i was going to reply `` i 'm pretty sure he 's talking about windows 8 when he said that '' , until i saw his reply to your comment ... 
  keynote easily beats powerpoint . 
  both are so much better than google 's spreadsheet offering . 
  nothing holds a candle to excel , though . 
  lydia 's who i killed in the quest boethia 's calling . 
  `` i am * sworn * to carry your burdens '' . 
  bitch . 
  agreed . 
  the two are definitely very different shows . 
  personally , i love the original the office , but ca n't stand the us version . 
  your mileage may vary . 
   top it all off with getting different ... composers, 
  woah woah woah there buddy . 
  john williams ' music * is * star wars . 
  you ca n't just get somebody else to do it . 
  i 'm honestly not sure if you 're being serious here , so i looked it up . 
  in episode ii , boba fett was played by one daniel logan . 
  i completely missed leliana on my first play through ( only recently started , still not finished ) . 
  did n't see her , and then the place gets overrun by darkspawn so you ca n't go back to get her . 
  it 's okay , i was n't planning on doing anything today , anyway . 
   there shouldnt be a system stopping mass downvotes, 
  yes there definitely should . 
  the people downvoting him are n't doing so on the merit or lack thereof of his comments , they 're doing it out of blind rage . 
  that 's not good rediquette , and if there 's a system in place that stops that , then that 's a good thing . 
  the tl ; dr is it got shot down by russian-backed rebels in ukraine . 
  maths hl is hard but not impossible . 
  what 's your previous maths experience ? 
  what curriculum did you do over your last two years of school ? 
  no , it 's not normal . 
  that 's the point of poe 's law . 
  it does say something about their ideological position . 
  it says that it 's an extreme viewpoint . 
  one of my favourite games growing up was [ dark cloud ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_cloud ) . 
  not a super well-known game , but it was really awesome . 
  also one of the only games that i 've downloaded the soundtrack to , it 's really good . 
  ah that 's a shame . 
  additional is a great preparation to hl ib . 
  what score did you get ? 
  [ here 's the course list for it ] ( http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program_list.html?acad_prog=2230 ) . 
  i might also suggest considering a [ bachelor of engineering majoring in software engineering ] ( http://uq.edu.au/study/plan_display.html?acad_plan=softwx2001 ) . 
  depending on the type of it you want to do , it might be essentially the same thing , but in a degree that 's generally more highly regarded . 
  holy shit that 's good . 
  you 're definitely more than capable of getting a good score in hl maths , it 's just going to be a lot of work if you do . 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't help you on that front . 
  i did n't use any resources that were n't provided by my teacher . 
  ( though doing a lot of past papers , especially in the last 6 months , is absolutely essential . ), 
  because he was n't . . ? 
  no , i 'm pretty sure you 're right . 
  i got added to that yesterday . 
  my brief excitement turned to disappointment very quickly . 
  people in the top 1 % of total combined karma count get added to it . 
  it uses [ this site ] ( http://karmalb.com/ ) 's `` total karma '' section . 
  that 's a great choice . 
  hl chem is mandatory in most unis i 've looked at , and hl bio is an obvious choice , as well . 
  hl maths is very tough , but certainly not impossible . 
  what 's your previous experience with maths ? 
  ( in particular , what curriculum have you followed in years 10/11 . ), 
  most unis seem to have very high requirements to get into medicine , so it might be advisable to do sl maths if hl is n't required ( i know it is n't for most unis here in aus ) , and do hl in english or history ( or spanish , if you 're confident in that ) . 
  i 've only ever heard of this described as sitting `` cross-legged '' ... 
  that link is staying blue . 
  and fair enough , to be honest . 
  it was a huge event ( the area was the size of germany and france combined , or a little larger than texas plus new mexico ) , but it was also a very localised one , with very little impact on the larger world . 
  we here in australia almost never hear about bushfires in california , except as brief mentions and some basic stats , for example . 
  i watched that one scene as part of a psychology experiment testing emotional reactions to cartoons a little while ago . 
  i wish i had been in the control group ... 
  i think bilbo 's scene is scarier because it 's more of a sudden shock , while galadriel kinda builds up to it , so you can brace yourself . 
  it 's showing as # 9.99 for me . 
  no , you 're exactly right . 
  it 's a really , really basic concept in economics . 
  unfortunately , a lot of countries have n't been following it , which is part of the reason the 2008 gfc was as bad as it was ( austerity measures and the like ) . 
  you sure it 's not showing dollars or euros or something ? 
  where are you located ? 
  for anyone wondering , this is a parody of an actual series of tips put out by the company that runs the trains here in my state of queensland . 
  you can see all the real ones [ on their website , here ] ( http://www.queenslandrail.com.au/aboutus/mediacentre/campaigns/pages/trainetiquette.aspx ) . 
  that 's not how betteridge 's law works . 
  it exists to describe how things usually work . 
  most of the time , when a title has a question in it , the answer is no . 
  but if you read this article , its conclusion ( whether you agree with it or not ) is clearly yes . 
  [ after 1 week i was at about 30 wpm ] ( http://imgur.com/ragyolm ) . 
  after 2 weeks , about 40 . 
  at 2 months , i was equal to my previous typing speed of about 80 , and now i 'm over 1.25 times my old average . 
  i 've got some suggestions to help you out [ here ] ( https://zagorath.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/dvorak/ ) , but mainly i would suggest practising as much as possible . 
  type exclusively in dvorak between now and then . 
  do n't print out stickers or rearrange your keys , but instead print out a copy of the keyboard and stick it next to/under your monitor .
