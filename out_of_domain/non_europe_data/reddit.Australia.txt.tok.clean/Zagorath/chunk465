  it wo n't be long before you do n't need to look at it anyway . 
  congrats on making the decision , and best of luck !, 
  yeah , i do n't know where he got that claim from , really . 
  perhaps it 's true of tumblr , but it certainly does n't apply to reddit . 
  people here frequently suggest alternative specific plans for implementing their suggested ideological approaches . 
  [ here 's one for 4e ] ( http://chaoticshiny.com/full4e.php ) . 
  other links in the sidebar can automatically generate a bunch of other stuff , but those are mostly just fluff . 
  it 's rare that i 'll find someone who agrees with me regarding samsung . 
  [ seen this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ) ? 
  it 's been a * long * time since i 've seen apple fanboys that have annoyed me as much as the anti-apple crowd . 
   why the fuck would ea want to prevent an arguably completely different genre and demographic from using the brand ? 
  because it means people who like porsche will * have * to buy ea 's games . 
  from their perspective , it 's a smart decision . 
  i 'm more wondering what advantage porsche gets out of it , unless it 's a simple cash transaction . 
  paypal is incredible if you 're a buyer . 
  they do some really shitty things to sellers , though . 
  [ one particularly egregious example ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/heartbreaking-paypal-orders-buyer-to-destroy-antique-violin-20120106-1pnwu.html ) . 
  you might , but i imagine the number of people like you are much lower than the number of people who would buy it for the porches . 
  if you 're a heavy podcast listener i would * strongly * recommend getting a dedicated podcatcher . 
  i use pocketcasts ( [ app store ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8 ) , [ google play ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts&amp;hl=en ) , [ official website ] ( http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts ) ) , and it makes everything so much easier . 
  i got mine in december 2012 , and it 's got an hdd .

  i 'm actually a little disappointed that they no longer sell 15-inch non-retina mbps . 
  is there any particular context behind the deck of cards thing ? 
   and throttling of all other secure connections, 
  that 's just stupid . 
  they could never do that . 
  every single google website ( including google.com , youtube , and gmail ) defaults to ssl . 
  all bank connections use ssl , as do any websites that involve buying things online . 
  my connection to all my university pages is secure , and so is facebook . 
  throttling all secure connections is just a completely unfeasible task . 
  this was one of my two set pieces for study in ib music . 
  the fugue in the fourth movement is brilliant . 
  \\* a massive oversimplification , of course . 
  some scholars consider beethoven 's symphony no . 
  55 ) to be the first piece of romantic era music , and sonata no . 
  22 is op . 
  54 , so was published directly before his symphony no . 
  ( i also meant to write `` arguably * one of * the last pieces . 
  oops . ), 
  let me pose a hypothetical question , then . 
  would you consider it bad etiquette to do the same thing on a clarinet ? 
  how about a piano or violin ? 
  man , i need to listen to more j.c. bach . 
  i certainly do . 
  i look at how my country enacted it in 1996 and wonder why the us could n't do the same . 
  guns are still legal . 
  you can still own them , you just have to be responsible . 
  the most obvious thing is that nobody should ever have a handgun , or be allowed to carry a loaded gun around * anywhere * . 
  that 's just insane . 
  in the us , it 's so easy for a relatively minor altercation to turn deadly when it absolutely need n't . 
  take [ this story ] ( http://abc13.com/news/veteran-kills-robbery-suspect-at-game-stop/84088/ ) for instance ( the first one from what seemed a reliable source -- i.e. , one that i recognised -- that i found on google ) . 
  if that had happened in australia , there 's absolutely no way anyone would have ended up dead . 
  the criminals would n't have been carrying guns , because they 're generally much harder to get , it just does n't happen . 
  the bystander would n't have had them , and so would n't have been tempted to kill them . 
  people say that if you have gun control , then only criminals will own guns . 
  again , that 's technically true , but incredibly misleading . 
  yes , the only people carrying around guns will be criminals , but your average store robbery or house break-in wo n't be committed by someone with a gun , because they wo n't be as easy to get a hold of . 
  if neither the robber nor the house/storeowner has a gun , it 's far less likely that one of them will end up dead . 
  besides , with gun laws ( or lack thereof ) like you have now in the us , it 's far more common for guns to increase the rate of suicide ( other methods are much less likely to succeed , and take more effort to attempt ) and you 're more likely to injure a family member or guest than an intruder . 
  and all that 's without talking about all the mass killings . 
  these happen all the time in the us , and it 's absolutely atrocious that every time they happen , gun supporters come out saying how there 's no way gun control would have helped . 
  they blame it on mental health ( which is certainly also a factor ) , they blame it on videogames ( which is generally not ) , they 'll talk about anything other than how easy it is to get a damn gun , and how sensible restrictions ( like australia put in place in 1996 ) could have prevented this kind of thing . 
  i know there 's a decent chance this 'll be downvoted , because gun laws are just about the only thing that even left-leaning americans ( such as redditors ) can side with the right on , and the second amendment is held sacred , but i 'm sorry , it 's the truth . 
  sources :, 
  i agree completely . 
  my last campaign involved a heap of deception , with one party member going behind the rest of the party 's backs , with the ultimate aim to betray us at the end . 
  luckily , we caught on early , so we planned against it . 
  there was a lot of scheming and plotting going on , but we only had a single actual combat encounter , right at the very last session of the campaign . 
  the combat itself worked really well , it was perfectly balanced etc. , but it did take a very long time . 
  that was partly because of the number of people involved , though . 
  6 players ( including the betrayer ) plus a dozen or so npcs all up ( some on each side ) . 
  the whole thing was very fun , but if we had had to fight him multiple times , it may have lost the appeal . 
  i think the scheming has a lot more value than the actual pvp combat . 
  for our current campaign ( the one right after that one ) , the player who played the betrayer is dming , with his old character being involved as an evil npc . 
  mine is definitely beethoven . 
  i love his powerful rhythms and his bold use of instrumentation . 
  i love the way he breaks down motifs , and builds his massive works out of such small themes . 
  i dunno , i just love his music . 
  a lot of people say that , but most of the arguments they give for why are either mislead or plain wrong . 
  unlike the sw prequels , which had only a few redeeming qualities . 
  that 's absolutely stupid . 
  it definitely is n't necessary , and your school is definitely not looking out for your best interests as a student by doing it ( which is what ** should ** be their top priority ) . 
  to be completely honest , in ib , schools should n't be having ** any ** internal assessment that is n't related to the actual baccalaureate programme . 
  there 's enough work to do for that , you do n't need even more stuff loaded on top of you . 
  still , if they 're determined to make you do it , there 's not much you can do . 
  still , i hope you can talk them out of it . 
  best of luck . 
  sorry for posting more arthur sullivan , but after the last one , this was recommended to me by youtube , and it was just such a fun piece to listen to . 
  [ yeah , it 's 97 per 100 people . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country ), 
  prior to the series of mass killings that occurred between 1984 and 1996 , most states in australia did n't have registries , either . 
  it serves to demonstrate your point that i did n't even realise i 'd heard of arthur sullivan before , until i saw you write g&s in the last sentence . 
  i did n't realise he was the sullivan of gilbert & sullivan fame , because the thought never occurred to me . 
  uhh , how can i tell if mine needs to be fixed ? 
  the man ended up * dead * . 
  that was absolutely not necessary . 
  it 's this attitude that causes the whole problem in the us , the idea that once someone needs to be stopped , it 's immediately okay to shoot them . 
  if you * do n't * get rid of handguns , once again , you have people -- both the innocent victims and the perpetrators -- getting killed . 
  again , remember that you 're far more likely to kill yourself or a family member with a gun than a criminal .
