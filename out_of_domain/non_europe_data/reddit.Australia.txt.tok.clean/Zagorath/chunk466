  what would have stopped sandy hook from occurring ? 
  a general lack of availability of guns . 
  he was able to easily obtain an illegal weapon , because weapons are so readily available . 
  the same was true in australia ( read about how the part arthur massacrist obtained his weapon ) , until we enacted sensible gun reform . 
  since then , not a single such event has taken place . 
  mine too . 
  did his first ironman at 51 . 
  i guess that 's so it 'll work for emergencies without needing to unlock in uk , usa , nz , and aus . 
  surprised they did n't also include 2 so it would work with the global gsm number . 
  relevant username . 
  actually you only need to be three things for it to end up at 97c , and you get 5c back . 
  clever username , by the way . 
  we really need to dump the 5c now , too . 
  damn new zealand always doing things before us . 
  .05 cents \\* 12/minute \\* 60minutes/hour = 36 dollars an hour . 
  so , unless you make * at least * 75k/year , your time is * not * more valuable than the time it takes to get that nickle , or you 're selling your labor too cheaply . 
  even christmas and easter are pretty much this way now . 
  the absolute worst of these , though , is [ pepero day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pepero#pepero_day ) , a holiday in korea where people literally give each other peperos -- a brand-name chocolate-dipped biscuit sold by lotte . 
  the `` british accent '' ? 
  britain has a huge variety of accents . 
  some sound really cool ( most scottish accents certainly do , as does the stereotypical posh english accent ) , but some sound horrible . 
  one of the worst , in my opinion , is the [ scouse accent ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9yrwebyryq ) , from liverpool . 
  it runs in seasons like a narrative tv show would ( as opposed to being all year round , like a news show ) . 
  unfortunately , said seasons are very short . 
  it only aired 8 episodes from september to october last year . 
  10 episodes between august and october in 2012 . 
  it 's a [ pea sized drop ] ( http://us.123rf.com/450wm/dianazh/dianazh1305/dianazh130500252/19675118-fresh-peas-and-child-s-hand.jpg ) , it 's not tiny . 
  i certainly did n't . 
  all i did was correct / u/xaxers ' syntax . 
  actually no , i 'm australian . 
  one of the countries with the least variety in accents in the english-speaking world . 
  it 's obviously a subjective judgement , and my feeling that way is probably coloured by the fact that the only scoucer i 've gotten to know was a right bitch , but then again most people i 've spoken to agree regarding the accent . 
  but yeah , any judgement about any accent being `` good '' or `` bad '' is inherently going to be subjective . 
  practice * . 
  americans can get away with using practice with a c all the time , but if you use practise and practice , the former is a verb only . 
  the latter is used as a noun or adjective . 
  but anyway , i agree with / u/drainedsoul , do n't have stickers , you 'll get into bad habits . 
  i would suggest printing out a copy of the keyboard and putting it under your monitor or something like that . 
  you can look at it for help , but it 'll still force you to learn where your fingers go on the keyboard . 
  anyway , 20 wpm after one day is pretty damn good . 
  congrats on making the switch !, 
  nah man , i get all my fishing advice from having a good chat with the fish . 
  the checkout ( also on the abc ) is pretty decent . 
  it does the same kind of thing , talking about consumer related issues . 
  i find that their style of delivery can be annoying sometimes , although the actual content is great . 
  on a related note , i suspect he 's not in charge of this , but they turn off the beeping noise that pedestrian crossings make at night . 
  could you perhaps mention that this is a problem because it means blind people ca n't get around at night ? 
  i listen to a few of them on abc classic fm , which airs some of them here in australia . 
  i did n't even realise they were available online . 
  might have to listen to some . 
  [ what the hell is going on in this comment ? 
  ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/2ccn2d/iam_ecka6_im_caught_in_the_middle_of_the_unidan/cjelurr ), 
  no , it 's still possible . 
  if you 've got the flag/keyboard selector in the menu bar , click it and press `` show keyboard viewer '' . 
  if the menu is n't there , go to `` keyboard '' in system preferences , and on the `` keyboard '' tab make sure `` show keyboard & character viewers in menu bar '' is selected , and `` show input menu in menu bar '' is selected from the `` input sources '' tab . 
  i actually am really interested . 
  it 's pretty easy , really . 
  just remember that 5 mi is 8 km , 10 mi is 16 km , and go from there . 
  6 mi is 5 + 1 mi , or 8 + 1.6 km . 
  i 'm hopeless at going the other way , though . 
  i do n't know if this would help or not , but i personally never feel comfortable doing static stretches cold . 
  instead , i do some dynamic stretches ( namely , i do open the gate , close the gate , and high kicks , see [ this video ] ( http://youtu.be/tydbyjk-pts?t=1m36s ) at 1:36 , 1:48 , and 2:05 ) , before running a little ( usually a couple of minutes ) , and then doing static stretches . 
  disclaimer : i 'm absolutely * not * an expert in the slightest . 
  to be honest , i 'd be surprised if this helped with your problem , but it certainly could n't hurt . 
  no , op clearly needs to break up with their so . 
  my technique is to remember 10 mi is 16 km , and go from there . 
  27 mi would be 10 \\* 2 + 5 + 2 mi . 
  that works out to 16 \\* 2 + 8 +3.2 km , or 43.2 km . 
  that was all in my head , took longer to type up than it did to think it through . 
  about 5 seconds ' work . 
  you 've gone the wrong way there . 
  1 mile is 1.6 km . 
  21 is 10 \\* 2 + 1 mile , or 16 \\* 2 + 1.6 km , or 33.6 km , by my reckoning . 
  google tells me the answer is 33.8 , so i was n't too far out . 
  that joke really does n't work well written out like that ... 
  haha no worries mate . 
  the abc a brilliant station over here . 
  shame the rest of aussie news is so damn terrible ... 
  rrr, 
  betteridges law of headlines is clever , but is certainly not universally correct . 
  [ here 's one example i came across just yesterday ] ( http://tasmaniantimes.com/index.php/article/is-the-abbott-government-fascist ) . 
  the body of the article clearly points towards a `` yes '' answer to the titular question . 
  prince of egypt , shrek , and how to train your dragon beg to differ . 
  they 've brought us a lot of great tv and films . 
  sherlock , the office ( imo much better than the us version ) , house of cards ( i like both the uk and us versions equally ) , fawlty towers , the it crowd , monty python , downton abbey ( at least the first couple of seasons ) . 
  not to mention some awesome actors . 
  sir ian mckellen , sir christopher lee , alan rickman , benedict cumberbatch , and sir patrick stewart , to name a few . 
  are you a crow ? 
  ( just based on the username , he 's probably a she . ), 
  who 's this you guys are talking about ? 
  he 's been speaking out on the issue of scottish independence , has he ? 
  they 'd be blocking scotland from entering the eu , nothing more . 
  it would still be an independent country . 
  [ not exactly ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/06/salmond-vs-darling-referendum-debate-poll-results-charts-scotland ) . 
  this poll seems to show that the young and the old favour maintaining status quo , while those in their middle ages weakly favour independence . 
  that 's actually also a reason i mentioned how to train your dragon . 
  its music is just amazing . 
  i really did n't like spirit , to be honest . 
  i ca n't remember why , it 's been so long since i saw it , but it just did n't grab me . 
  but at least he made it clear he could n't care less .
