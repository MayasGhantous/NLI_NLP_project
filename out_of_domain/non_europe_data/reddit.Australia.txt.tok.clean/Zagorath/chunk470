  and yeah , people on low incomes pay zero income tax for the exact same reason that they should n't have to pay gst on basic goods : the simply can not afford to . 
  i 'd be happy to see loopholes closed and the top end income tax raised . 
  but i also want to not see the gst affect those on lower incomes more than it currently does . 
  i 'm going to have to go with you on the nightmare of accounting for gst , although i 'm very surprised that it ca n't be done automatically by whatever software systems you use . 
  i do imagine , though , that with big companies , the problem does not grow as much , because they would be more efficient at dealing with it . 
  that ... just ... why ? 
  still , better than our ttccs here . 
  have to get a new one of them every year , if you want to use a student concession card . 
  i 'm gon na guess that they 're worried that they might be charged a ridiculous amount or something . 
  it 's probably mostly irrational fear because so many other things were fucked up . 
   so this post is going to cause me to go listen to this one tonight, 
  i suspect a great many people will be joining you in that . 
  i know i am . 
  i do n't get it , what would doing this serve ? 
   if the thief sneaks into a room trying to escape the notice of a hill giant guard , the fighter and druid probably would n't be shouting out suggestions from the other side of the door . 
  this is why i love playing a shardmind . 
  i can basically always keep in contact with people and give suggestions like that , by communicating telepathically . 
  i assume you 're familiar with [ this tale ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/21zwpt/hating_orcs_with_a_twist/ ) ? 
  wow , what the fuck . 
  people shit on translink here all the time , but they 've definitely at least got their shit together in that respect . 
  i 'm pretty sure this game is the reason my r button stopped working . 
  if you 've ever played any of the jack & daxter games on playstation , then i 'd recommend daxter for psp . 
  this kind of attention to detail is what i love about tv and film soundtracks by good composers . 
  if anyone here enjoyed op 's post , and is also a fan of game of thrones , i 'd suggest taking a look at [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bulzc/musical_themes_and_motifs_in_ramin_djawadis_score/ ? ) . 
  i 'm currently in the middle of a complete re-watch of that show in light of the details i learnt in that . 
  it really adds another dimension to the show . 
  personally i think it sounds like it would be awesome if one of them was a force user from the beginning , having to hide it from everyone . 
  using their force powers only in imperceptible ways , like using mind tricks , or reacting slightly faster to an attack . 
  finding sneaky ways to use something like force push or pull could be interesting , too . 
  what if they just send one player in at a time ? 
  that is so awesome . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  aye , but if all multicellular organisms are eukaryotes ( i do n't know if that 's true or not ) then / u/violaceum 's statement is correct . 
  next part coming tomorrow !, 
  sounds like whoever ranked it did n't watch till the end . 
  i 've not read the book of seen the movie , but from the looks of your comment , i think you may have meant `` condemn '' , not `` condone '' . 
  quite the opposite in meaning . 
  sorry if i just misinterpreted what you were talking about . 
  have you watched the original series of 5 films ? 
  the costumes are so awful i wonder if they would n't trigger the same fear reaction from you . 
  anyway , for me , i ca n't watch any if the remakes or reboots of planet of the apes , because i loved the originals so much i 'm afraid it 'll spoil them for me . 
  yeah , i 've always referred to cameron 's avatar by saying `` it 's not a movie , it 's a tech demo '' . 
  seems fitting , to me . 
  ah right . 
  yeah , i 'm on mobile so i did n't click on the actual link . 
  that thing about the sides of the brain and creativity has been so thoroughly debunked it really diminishes the argument of the person who brings it up . 
  why is that *fat*.gfycat.com ? 
  in that case , the monkey was n't in community , either . 
  her role in that went uncredited , too . 
  yes , that 's basically it . 
  yeah , op admitted elsewhere in the thread that it 's a composite . 
  actually i think it 's animodes . 
  no , it 's not . 
  anime can be used as either a countable or an uncountable noun , depending on context . 
  if it 's being used as a countable noun , then you can pluralise it by adding an s ( e.g. , the sentence `` it was one of the few animes i enjoyed '' ) . 
  if it is being used uncountable , you ca n't really pluralise it per se , in the same way you ca n't pluralise `` money '' ( e.g. 
  the sentence `` those shows are anime '' ) . 
  in the former case , it is acceptable to leave off the s. both anime and animes are accepted plural forms of the countable noun `` anime '' . 
  [ you were n't even wrong , anyway ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2de12v/the_fall_of_azula_was_one_of_the_best_story_arcs/cjozgor?context=2 ) . 
  was it a d4 ? 
  because that would just be evil . 
  and she voiced young lin beifong . 
  the same is definitely true in many sports , and i think it may also be true of many art forms . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( http://xkcd.com/606/ ) . 
  i do n't know how this thread went from discussing the legality of recording in public to carrying weapons in public , but anyway . 
  you make the point that is so often thrown about . 
  ban guns , and then only criminals will have guns . 
  sure , that 's true . 
  only criminals will have guns . 
  but you know what ? 
  it 'll also make guns a heck of a lot harder to get . 
  sure , people with them will be criminals , but ** far less ** criminals will have them , by simple virtue of the fact that they are now harder to get . 
  but honestly , i do n't know why i bother . 
  there 's no rational debate to be had on this topic . 
  those against reasonable gun control will * always * be against it . 
  they find weasley ways to simply ignore any evidence shown to them . 
  [ i ca n't be bothered typing out any more , so here 's this ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2cmz5y/judge_poses_hypothetical_in_abortion_ruling_what/cjhd57h ) , that i wrote out a few weeks back . 
  [ did you know that horses can also be used in place of seeing eye dogs ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=qi_%28h_series%29#episode_12_.22horses_and_hunting.22 ) . 
  wiktionary article for anime . 
  and thank fuck for our laws preventing them from going all the way . 
  ( and hope to fuck the current government does n't change that . ), 
  no , i think / u/twowheelsensation is correct . 
  the two commas around `` though '' act as parenthetical commas . 
  you can take out what 's between them completely and get a sentence that makes sense : `` not me , i 'm perfect and do n't make mistakes . '', 
  just thinking about the kinds of policies tony abbott is pushing through makes my blood boil . 
  there 's no reasoning with them , so it 's generally not worth trying . 
  i 'm afraid that if a part 3 exists , i 'm not aware of it . 
  i 'm surprised you did n't ask for the person 's usual hand dominance . 
  that seems like it would be useful information to compare . 
  could also be worth having a little diagram explaining your names for all the fingers . 
  while i 'm familiar with them , i suspect people from different cultures might not be . 
  a simple numbering system would work well , too ( thumb being finger 1 , pinky finger 5 , etc. 
  yeah i had to do the same . 
  just wrote it in under `` other '' . 
  haha afraid not . 
  i 'm just posting a heap of different stories that i 've found elsewhere that i liked . 
  there are pictures . 
  res 's preview fucks it up , so you 'll have to go to the actual page . 
  no , i do n't think that 's very uncommon .
