  i only know of one or two left handers that use the mouse in their left hand . 
  most that i know use their right hand . 
  do n't forget to read the comics !, 
  the promise , the search , and the rift ( each parts 1 through 3 ) . 
  i 've noticed a lot of people in debate and oratory will use `` ladies and gentlemen '' as filler speech . 
  it works really well when used sparingly , as it seems more like a way of emphasising their point . 
  but when overused it just becomes completely obvious filler and far more distracting than umms . 
  those are words that i would use interchangeably , were it not for the context . 
  i think others may have made the same mistake i nearly did . 
  i agree . 
  a lot of people mention how the characters and tone of the show had changed a lot in season 4 . 
  somehow they always seem to miss the fact that the latter half of season 3 was headed in that exact direction . 
  can i just mention how damn happy i am that this video is watchable internationally . 
  here 's hoping that the actual show will be released in the same way . 
  when korra went all-digital , i was hoping nick would do the same , but nope , i still have to pirate that . 
  hoping i do n't have to pirate community . 
  oh , also , did the voice over guy in this sound like [ the guy that does parody voice-overs on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibyfa3ztxfe ) ? 
  could be wrong , though . 
  vista was hated for the increased attempts at security ( uac ) that in fact were n't implemented all that well for either usability or security . 
  later updates fixed this problem . 
  it was also hated for lack of driver compatibility , which had far more to do with vendors not making drivers for their hardware , but users see it as `` my hardware is n't working on the new windows , microsoft dun fuck stuff up '' . 
  again , this was fixed later on in vista 's lifetime . 
  windows 8 's hate was certainly all about gui . 
  in literally * every * other respect , it 's an improvement over 7 . 
  but the problems were pretty significant . 
  and since 8.1 , it 's now fixed all the reasonable problems that it had on release . 
  people who are still complaining either do n't know what they 're talking about , or are luddites afraid of change . 
  wow thanks for that !, 
  i 've been pressing win , going into metro , and then typing . 
  did n't realise you could do it without leaving the desktop !, 
  it 's really not * since windows 8.1 came out * . 
  my * controller 's * + hit is +14 at level * 11 * . 
  you could significantly reduce the cost of operating this kind of website if you asked/encouraged users to upload their music on soundcloud or youtube , and simply embedded those , rather than needing to actually host the heavy content yourself . 
  plus , it would give people the option of monetising on youtube ( to make a few cents/dollars , even if not a significant income ) , if they want to , while still having the advantage of increasing exposure . 
  the comments are amusing . 
   pronounced `` lionhelm '', 
   he must be a lannister bannerman . 
  damn . 
  this is really good . 
  listening to the second movement now , and i ca n't help but feel it seems like just a continuation of the first , only at a slightly slower tempo . 
  that 's not necessarily a bad thing , but it is certainly unusual , when i 'm used to hearing people like beethoven or mahler , where each movement feels like it belongs to the same piece , yet clearly has its own mood , as well . 
  edit : just finished the whole symphony . 
  i love it !, 
  i went to high school at an international school in south-east asia . 
  there was a family of mormons at my school from * switzerland * . 
  fucked if i know why . 
  on most sites triple click selects by paragraph , not line , but even so , it 's a great tip . 
  some sites seem to be designed in a way that stops this working properly a lot of the time . 
  [ a bit more to the story in here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fqrtm9k.png ) . 
  i very much doubt abbott cares much , either . 
  i played for months before i even discovered couched lance was a thing . 
  and even then , only because i had someone hit me with one . 
  were it not for that , right now would probably be the first time i ever heard of it . 
  since you 've said beethoven , i 'm also going to mention [ the second movement of symphony no . 
  7 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mghxmasindk ) , and [ the second movement of symphony no . 
  3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf1kruyiujm ) . 
  the latter has been used in civ games to play when you wipe out any enemy civilisation . 
  the first time i did it , hearing the music made me not want to do it again , it felt so deep , so real . 
  i 'll link [ 1st movement of piano sonata no. 14 in c # minor , `` moonlight '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arnrfubbnyc ) , too , since you did n't add links . 
  which is funny , because iirc it was actually meant as a piece to show his love for his wife alma . 
  yeah , it 's a completely clich\u00e9d answer , but that 's because it 's such a brilliant fit . 
  [ here 's a link to adagio for strings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izqsge0l450 ) . 
  ooo yeah , that 's a great one . 
  what do you call a musician 's friend ? 
  a percussionist . 
  yeah i thought so , too . 
  that 's the idea . 
  and who are you , the comrade said ,, 
  that i must love moscow ? 
  only a ruskie of a different coat ,, 
  that 's all the truth i know . 
  with a flag of gold or a flag of red ,, 
  a russian still has nukes ,, 
  and mine are large and deadly too ,, 
  as large and deadly as the gook 's . 
  and so he spoke , and so he spoke ,, 
  [ israilov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hasan_israilov ) of chechnya ,, 
  but now the rains weep o'er his land ,, 
  with no one there to hear . 
  yes now the rains weep o'er his land ,, 
  and not a soul to hear . 
  thank god the soviet flag used red and gold . 
  that made it easier . 
  and yeah , i know the timeline of things does n't really work with israilov , but it was a name that fit with the metre , and he was involved in a rebellion , so it fit thematically , too . 
  ** edited ** to steal / u/lesser _ panjandrum 's second line . 
  i like it better . 
  i could be wrong , but i was under the impression that a bilingual diploma is when your language in group 1 is different to the language you take your group 3 or 4 subjects in ( i believe they only like offer this in english , spanish , and french , with trials in german and possibly other languages ) . 
  that would mean , assuming your papers will be in english ( since norwegian is not , to my knowledge , an option ) , you would want to take norwegian a1 . 
  you could also then take english b , which , if this post is any indication , you would do extremely well at . 
  your other option is to do your ee in a language different from your a1 language , and have it based on a group 3 or 4 subject . 
  if you 're interested in doing an ee in the humanities or physical sciences , then you could do a1 english and do an ee in norwegian . 
  but yes , if you 're capable of doing it ( which you probably are ) i would say it 's well worth going down one of the avenues that would lead to you getting a bilingual diploma . 
  to summarise :, 
  * a1 norwegian + english b + group 3 or 4 in english, 
  * a1 english + ee in group 3 or 4 , in norwegian + something language b. 
  are your two options . 
  i would suspect the first option is the easier one , since it means you do n't have to pick another language b. 
   this . 
  does it have a set story , conflicts , themes , and a higher quality than other cartoons ? 
  then it 's probably an anime .
