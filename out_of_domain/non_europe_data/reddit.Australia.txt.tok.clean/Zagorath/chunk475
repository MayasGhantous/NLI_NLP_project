  that 's a cool price !, 
  why ? 
  the person who lost their passport will know that they lost their passport , and will follow up on any potential leads ( i.e. , if they see this post , they 'll definitely go to fortitude valley train station ) . 
  they will either tell their friends about it or not , and their friends will probably do the same . 
  if they tell their friends , and their friend sees this post , they 'll inform the person about it , regardless of the limited detail . 
  the only way providing more detail could help is if op shared the * name * of the person , in which case anyone that knows this person could tell them , even if they did n't already know their passport was missing . 
  but i think we can all agree that sharing the name of the person on here is a bad idea , regardless of the potential benefits of it . 
  i wonder if it might be worth contacting the indian consulate in brisbane ? 
  i imagine that whoever you handed the passport in to probably will have done this , but it could n't hurt . 
  no is he really, 
  i 'm pretty sure / u/seleroan knows this . 
  manuel ( the spanish guy in fawlty towers ) says '' \u00bf qu\u00e9 ? '', 
  a lot . 
  how does this happen accidentally , though ? 
  do n't you have to do something specifically to make your image a part of the general imgur community ? 
  i know if i go to my imgur account and look at an image i uploaded , there 's no option for comments on it . 
  that guy looks weirdly like johnny depp . 
  in korea it 's called ondol heating , and it is absolutely glorious . 
  \\* clears throat \\*, 
  as an australian resident , you should probably know that we use the word practise when it 's a verb . 
  yeah . 
  self-driving cars could potentially do away with some local rail services , but certainly not long distance high-speed rail . 
  haha yeah , [ big fan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irony_punctuation ) . 
  unfortunately , its unicode character is n't as widely supported as the interrobang . 
  it displays correctly for me on my mac , but not on my pc ( running windows ) . 
  on a related note , is the title of that article in some way related to the blog '' [ ironic sans ] ( http://www.ironicsans.com/ ) '' ? 
  no you have n't . 
  based on your username , i 'm wondering if that barbarian was you ? 
  that 's interesting , because to me the opposite is true . 
  after having listened to a podcast for a few months , i eventually decided to watch the video version once , and it just made the people in it seem so much more real ( for the lack of a better explanation ) . 
  seeing as it * has * been done , it obviously * is * possible . 
  i 'm going to guess that the way it 's done is that the extension parses the html of the page for the bit where the channel name appears , and if it matches something in the whitelist , then it shows ads . 
  on my mac i use textexpander by smile software , and i have interrobang set to '' * !, 
  without the spaces . 
  i 've never tried it , but it would appear that [ this programme ] ( http://textexpanderwindows.com/ ) can do the same on windows . 
  ~ ~  virtually everyone lives in the state 's southwestern corner ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ yup . 
  i 'm pretty sure brisbane , sydney , and melbourne alone make up a touch under 50 % of the total population of the country . ~ ~, 
  edit : disregard this comment, 
  house of cards is another one . 
  shit you 're right . 
  i misread southwest as southeast , and state as country . 
  that was dumb . 
  my situation is virtually the same , only i was living in vietnam . 
  ( i also did n't realise there was a british version . ), 
  i had always figured star world was based in singapore , but a quick google suggests you 're right , it is hong kong . 
  i feel like downton abbey only belongs on this list if you specify `` the first three seasons '' . 
  most people i know could n't keep watching it after that , it got overly soap-opera-like . 
  i 'd also suggest house of cards . 
  personally i liked it just as much as the us version , although the two are very different . 
   [ backslash ] ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/backslash ), 
  just thought you should know , that part would 've displayed as written even without the escape characters . 
  reddit needs the http : / / to display as a url . 
  when you say `` we sang the happy birthday song '' , i 'm just curious , did you sing the well-known tune , or was it a song your restaurant had that it used for birthdays ? 
  just curious , because i thought most places would n't sing the well-known song for legal reasons . 
  the uk version got 12 episodes , not 4 , unless you mean per season . 
  i 'm not sure i agree regarding the political setting . 
  i 'm not british , and i know very little about british politics , but the show was just as easy to understand as the us version was ( i should note i 'm not american , either ) . 
  to be honest , i do n't think you need to understand that much about the setting at the time to get the show . 
  all the important context stuff ( like how long she was in office and how ruthless she was ) is described in the show , anything else is n't necessary . 
  personally i loved both versions of the story . 
  watching the uk version made the whole shakesperian vibe so much clearer to me ( in retrospect , it 's obviously there in the us version , too , but watching the uk version made me realise that ) . 
  but they both felt so different in their styles , and their characters ' motivations , that i find it hard to compare one to the other . 
  they 're just both really great shows . 
  [ op replied , just in the wrong location ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2dycuc/waiters_and_waitresses_whats_your_most_awkward/cjujvwe?context=3 ) . 
   the woman on the date looked like a deer in the headlights and very quickly got up and left . 
  she just said , `` i 'm sorry '' to the lady , did n't even look at the man . 
  the wife then spent the next 20 minutes quietly making the husband squirm , as she had sat next to him in the booth and blocked him in . 
  eventually , she left , and he awkwardly paid the bill ( big tip ) and left also . 
  it was somewhat anti-climactic , but i had mad respect for the wife . 
  i hope she left him for good . 
  eh , it 's a dumb copyright claim anyway , and if it was a one-off thing ( as in , your restaurant did n't have a policy of singing it whenever kids have their birthday there ) , i doubt it would 've mattered . 
  oooh , i did n't realise this at the time , but / u/rapgamebonjovi 's comment sounds awfully like something that manuel would say , too . 
  just for clarification , does one quarter higher mean the same as 1.25 times the current speed ? 
  you do n't know how old / u/z64dan is . 
  maybe they 're already 85 . 
  or maybe they 've been diagnosed with a fatal disease and are n't expected to live out the decade . 
  but yeah on a serious note , more than likely , they will be alive to see self-driving cars become commonplace , even if they 're not so common that it 's rare to see a manual car . 
  cheers, 
  yeah, 
  indeed there is , but people still tend to avoid using it because there is still a claim , and nobody wants to take the chance . 
   currencies that are quoted in terms of other currencies are n't doing so hot as a currency, 
  as much as i hate to say something to defend bitcoin , the guy 's right on that point . 
  currencies are * always * quoted in terms of other currencies . 
  that 's the only way of comparing them that makes sense . 
  watch the financial section of any major news station , they 'll probably take the local currency and compare it to a number of major world currencies . 
  for example , right now , the australian dollar is buying :, 
  * 0.698838 euros, 
  * 0.930841 us dollars, 
  * 0.560130 british pounds , and, 
  * 1.103933 nz dollars, 
  a news report would also usually compare it to yesterday , or over the last week . 
  yep , i 'm seeing that , too . 
  no they would n't ... none that i know , anyway . 
  if you 're discussing currencies , you do it in terms of other currencies . 
  maybe you could ask one of your party members to scan it for you ? 
  all versions of android thus far have been named after a dessert . 
  the letter that the dessert starts with has gone up gradually with each major revision . 
  the most current version released is kit-kat , with an l version to be released later this year . 
  to be fair , windows 8.1 is actually 6.3 .
