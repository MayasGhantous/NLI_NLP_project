  edit : whoops , misread . 
  thought it said * is * massive enough . 
  huh ... 
  thanks for explaining that for me . 
  i was n't aware of the american definition . 
  got ta be honest , given the root of the word ( `` home '' ) , the us definition does n't really make sense to me . 
  i 'm an australian , and the term i 've heard is fresher five . 
  fresher because that 's what we call first years ( and we do n't use terms like junior/senior/whatever that other weird word is for other years ) , and 5 kilogrammes . 
  i * think * the uk uses that phrase as well , but i could be wrong . 
  whoops . 
  damn double negatives . 
   usa censors the web as much as china, 
  look , i get what they 're trying to do when they claim that , but it 's utter bullshit . 
  china censors facebook , twitter , and google . 
  it censors anyone who speaks out against their government or against communism . 
  it censors anyone who believes taiwan is its own country , or who thinks tibet should be independent . 
  the us does n't even get * close * to the same level as china . 
  displayed fine for me when i tried it in reddit is fun . 
  i 'm just curious , for the first and second last one , what 's the liquid ? 
  ( and why does it seem to glow ? ), 
  edit : also , what does vtt mean ? 
  no , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4qunzun.png ) is what he meant to link to . 
  he linked to some shitty site that automatically redirects to what you saw when people link to images . 
  hmm yeah , that makes sense . 
  it 's kind of a sarcastic word . 
  i laughed too much at that bit . 
  everyone loves me bom bom bom . 
  someone else completed the books based on the original author 's ( copious ) notes . 
  my sister 's tumblr . 
  he 's probably using factoid incorrectly , assuming it means the same as `` fun fact '' . 
  by us standards , most previous liberal governments would be moderate left . 
  note that is by us standards , * not * world standards . 
  on a more absolute scale they 're moderate right . 
  this government , however , is right wing even by us standards . 
  not extreme right , perhaps , but certainly right wing . 
  one other thing worth noting is that the law might require that they cover certain types of things for two years . 
  apple might then choose to offer their own warranty that goes * beyond * that requirement , but they can choose to offer that for only one year . 
  very cool !, 
  [ looks vaguely avatar-ish ] ( http://static.tvtome.com/images/genie_images/news_hub/uploaded/noelrknews138158156100/varrick02.jpg ) . 
  seriously dude , right wingers are always going on about our debt , and how terrible it is . 
  it 's an absolute lie , because fearmongering is the only way that they can get people to side with them . 
  australia 's debt is absolutely * miniscule * on the world scale . 
  our debt to gdp ratio is [ one of the lowest in the world ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_public_debt ) . 
  in general i 'm sure i 'd agree with you . 
  our right wing is probably normally left of centre in the us . 
  however this current government eschews that . 
  they 're still not as extreme as the republicans ( thank god ) , but they 're definitely right of centre . 
  hmm . 
  when i was on ios i used alien blue . 
  i do n't think i ever had any problems with that . 
  regarding the edit , i prefer the [ political compass ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/ ) model for placing political views . 
  it puts economic and social policies on separate axes , making it easier to place people relative to each other when they do n't fit in the mainstream line of progressive to conservative ( which would roughly be the line y = x on the political compass ) . 
   or people who actually understand economics, 
  i see a lot of people on the right claim that they are these people , and that left wingers are not . 
  yet i consistently see far more people on the right use bizarre talking points or faulty logic in order to make their points . 
  but anyway , you seem to be making a rather arbitrary distinction between so-called `` good '' and `` bad '' debt . 
  more importantly , you seem to be grossly misinformed about how the nbn was to be financed . 
  it was quite specifically designed so that it would pay itself off by people paying to use it . 
  it certainly would n't have required the same level of maintenance and future upgrade costs that the liberal party 's alternative solution is going to . 
  cutting funding to education and healthcare definitely is n't the way to go for a good economy . 
  good healthcare and education mean that in the long run workers are able to be far more efficient in terms of how much they add to the economy ( sick workers are a drain , and more educated workers can work in higher skilled jobs ) . 
  instead , the current government is going to increase the cost of universities , and make people pay more to visit a gp . 
  that 's not smart economics , whatever abbott might try to spin it as . 
   with about 1gb of a difference between ie and firefox, 
  i feel like this should be expressed as a percentage , not an absolute amount . 
  you bet your arse it 's going to be more than 1 gb difference if you try to have 50 tabs open at once , and the difference is going to be in the megabyte range if you 've only got two or three . 
  can i just say , i 'm on a 4 gb system and my task manager is currently reporting about 63 % memory usage . 
  i 've got chrome open , and bugerall else , just a bunch of services and utilities ( e.g. 
  dropbox , copy , etc. 
   the lord of the rings is often erroneously called a trilogy , when it is in fact a single novel consisting of six books plus appendices , sometimes published in three editions . 
  that 's the forward to my single-volume copy of lotr . 
  regarding the six books thing , each of the published editions is two books . 
  books one and two are fellowship , three and four are towers , and five and six are return . 
  i think he was talking about his op as being the novella , not lotr . 
  if i was somersaulting everywhere , i would very quickly get dizzy . 
  i 'd probably vomit all over you , and then you 'd be disgusted by my somersaulting vomiting mess . 
  so what you 're saying is , [ ie is a wizard , while firefox is a warrior ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/linearwarriorsquadraticwizards ) ? 
  ( replacing `` prowess '' with `` memory usage '' and `` level progression '' with `` tabs open '' . ), 
  edit : obligatory tv tropes warning . 
  [ hotlink directly to graph ] ( http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/wizardsandmelees_9442.jpg ) if you want to avoid tv tropes . 
  to be fair , i have a shitload of tabs running at any one time , as well as a healthy handful of extensions . 
  oh right . 
  got ta admit , i only skimmed through the actual op . 
  thought the only novella reference was in that above comment ; the one you quoted in your previous comment . 
  you know what , i think he might be right about that one . 
  here , you can take some of ours ( because i 'm sure there 's * no * way that could backfire ... ) . 
  think he probably means digits . 
  they 've got no fingers . 
  with butter or margarine . 
  i ca n't speak for him , but i have a similar view on the royal family . 
  ( it particularly annoys me that she 's * my * head of state , despite only having visited my country 16 times in her life , and always siding against my country with things like bids to host events . ), 
  personally , i think inheritance taxes should be substantial , but not punitive . 
  i do n't know the current rate in my country or any other , so i ca n't comment on whether i think it suitable . 
  i have n't seen any extra data on the matter , though . 
  it 's an issue that i do n't know much about economically , and although i have my intuitive opinion on the matter , i 'd be open to hearing other views . 
  i sometimes forget tobuscus does gaming stuff . 
  i only really watch his main channel , and only really for the literal trailers , the [ music ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtef0j5gygk ) , and recently the [ rants ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7euwdcryv0 ) . 
  for complete newbies , what would you think about just creating characters for them , stat-wise ? 
  come up with some fluff/back-story on your own , but tell them they can come up with their own if they want , or they can use one you made . 
  just do this for a short one or two session campaign so that they can learn the mechanics , before later helping them make their own characters properly .
