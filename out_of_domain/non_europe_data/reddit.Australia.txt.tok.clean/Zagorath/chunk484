  [ this is the way it is taught in the vast majority of latin america ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent#separation_of_continents ) , as well as in some parts of europe . 
  do they use the terms america del sud and america del norte ? 
  yeah , they do . 
  but english speakers also use terms like northern africa and east asia . 
  that does n't mean we think they that those are continents . 
  some alternate sources since you seem to be as obstinate about this point as the person indicated in the op was in the reverse :,

  i do n't agree with it , but ** it is ** *** not *** ** wrong ** . 
  read the actual fucking article you faux-pretentious prick . 
   the six-continent combined-america model is used in spanish-speaking countries [ 26 ] and in some parts of europe including greece, 
   north america and south america are treated as separate continents in the seven-continent model . 
  however , they may also be viewed as a single continent known as america . 
  this viewpoint was common in the united states until world war ii , and remains prevalent in some asian six-continent models . 
  [ 13 ] this remains the more common vision in latin american countries , spain , portugal , france , italy and greece , where they are taught as a single continent . 
  this is the way it is taught in schools in latin america . 
  it 's the way most latin americans think about things when talking to other latin americans in their native language . 
  edit : here 's a novel idea . 
  since you 're the one claiming something that goes against ( even if it might be only tangentially against ) the sources already provided , how about you provide some decent sources to back up your viewpoint . 
  see my edit to the previous comment . 
  but perhaps it would be helpful to read the article in its original language . 
  you would see that google translate 's version has done the rather convenient ( under normal circumstances ) job of also converting cultural context , which is no use to us here when trying to compare the two cultures . 
  they refer to it as a subcontinent . 
  i fail to see how point 2 works in your favour even in the english translation . 
  it even says `` in america , only argentina ... '' . 
  clearly referring to argentina as being part of america . 
  however , a look at the spanish version :, 
  reveals that the first sentence has been translated rather unfavourably for the purposes of this discussion . 
  the actual page calls it north america , and says that saying `` north america '' is commonly used as a synonym for the usa . 
  this is australia 's national classical music radio station . 
  they unfortunately do n't have on-demand stuff available , but you can listen in internationally . 
  starting at 1:00 pm est ( that 's utc +10 ) on monday , they 'll be playing the proms concert that the op came from . 
  that 's at 0300 utc . 
  bolero 's near the end of that , though , so it 'll probably be a little after 0330 utc . 
  if you really want to , you can listen to it then . 
  ( it 's actually a really good classical station in general , so you could pop in any time for just general good music . ), 
  unfortunately for me , i only came here after googling stuff about one particular movie . 
  one of the results was a page from that subreddit , which did n't get cached by google . 
  i then found this subreddit when i decided to find out why the other one was banned . 
  i do n't know about your uni , but at mine ( uq ) , computer science is basically software engineering lite . 
  it definitely involves taking programming courses . 
  yeah , it 's not supported in ansi-c . 
  ( which is a c version , not a compiler version . ), 
  hey man , that 's not really fair . 
  medical research is one of many scientific areas in which australia punches well above its weight . 
  we invented the pacemaker , ultrasound , cochlear implants , and were involved in a joint effort with the us which developed a vaccine for cervical cancer . 
  it was an australian that first put the discovery of penicillin to use in medicine . 
  i think cpi is useful because it let 's you know how much it 's increasing relative to the rest of the economy , roughly speaking . 
  numberphile and other channels that do the same thing are the only time i ever really see annotations at all . 
  my first reaction upon seeing the op was `` why ? '' . 
  i 'm still wondering why so many people want them turned off . 
  do a lot of people go to channels where they 're used for annoying `` plz subscrive '' messages ? 
  coos i have n't seen any of those in nearly half a decade . 
  i know , right ? 
  i 'm wondering who this haydn fellow is . 
  i mean , if he taught pleyel you 'd think i 'd have at least * heard * of him before . 
  that was just too good . 
  to address your addressing of the first point , you 're thinking of first cousins . 
  with siblings , the probability of problems is significantly higher than normal even with a single generation . 
  nah that 's me , too . 
  only it 's a wired mouse . 
  my mbp is only for gaming when i 'm away from home , so i do n't have a special setup . 
  my last name would mean `` drinking human blood whilst being abusive to your significant other '' . 
  it 's probably just because chrome is now using what looks to me like anti-aliased fonts . 
  browsers on windows have been pretty terrible for this : they all used to use non-anti-aliased text . 
  os x has had font anti-aliasing for a long time now , and when i first started using it , i found it really off-putting . 
  as someone who currently uses both windows and os x in more or less equal amounts , i can definitely say you will get used to it , and eventually you will even find that it 's much , much better this way . 
  tl ; dr , you do n't like it because you 're not used to it , but once you 're used to it you 'll find that it 's actually a much nicer look . 
  [ this should probably help you ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/2f2h4a/my_font_is_blurry/ck5bwz0 ) . 
  yeah , that 's exactly the difference i 'm talking about . 
  it 's a pain at first , but once you get used to it , it 's far preferable . 
  my last campaign did it really well , i thought . 
  the first session , we were all thrown together without much explanation . 
  we were in some kind of weird space-environment , with one guy as a guide , telling us we had to stop the evil guy . 
  at the end of a dungeon with many super-fantastical traps etc. , we found the evil guy , fought with him , and he escaped through a portal . 
  we then went through the portal , and then ... we woke up . 
  each of us was in our beds . 
  none of us knew the rest of the party , but we all had the business card of the npc that was our guide during the dream , and a note saying how and where to meet him . 
  everything would be explained when we met him . 
  it 's a style that can only really work for massive `` save the universe '' type campaigns , but it worked really well for us . 
  or simply have them not know where to find the nemesis . 
  one important thing about the worf effect :, 
   when used sparingly and appropriately, 
  if it 's overused , it becomes obvious and seems contrived . 
  i 'd love to try and help you with this , but i 'm not really sure what you mean . 
  ctrl-f-ing my pdf copy of it , i do n't see any mention of `` character assets '' . 
  are you asking about some of the themes introduced in bovd ? 
  or feats ? 
  what is it you 're looking for , exactly ? 
  are chairs like this commonplace in the us ? 
  all the desks at my school were proper big rectangular desks . 
  for gaming i just switch back to qwerty ( though most games are programmed in such a way that it does n't matter and it just works ) . 
  for programming , see the [ programmer dvorak layout ] ( http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/ ) . 
  i use a customised version of that which puts numbers back into the correct order and moves some punctuation into a location i prefer , but is mostly the same in principle . 
  so much better than both qwerty and standard dvorak . 
  shout out to / r/dvorak for anyone who might be interested in switching to dvorak .
