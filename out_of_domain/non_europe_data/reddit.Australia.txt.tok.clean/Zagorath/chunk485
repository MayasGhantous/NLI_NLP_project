  i 'd highly recommend making the switch , it 's such a great keyboard layout !,

  hahaha / u/goblinruler , you seem to be on a bit of an ignaz pleyel binge at the moment . 
  really nice concerto , though . 
  yeah , using blue text on a webpage for non-link text is really bad design . 
  still , this is an absolutely brilliant link . 
  i 'd love it if we got more similar pages submitted for other pieces . 
  edit : [ this pdf ] ( http://www.sd5.k12.mt.us/cms/lib3/mt01001507/centricity/domain/114/yellow_river_2.pdf ) has , starting on page 7 , some cool detail about prokofiev 's classical symphony , if you 're interested . 
  it 's designed from the perspective of a guide for teachers to teach students who are studying the piece, 
  knew i recognised it somewhere . 
  considered x-posting to / r/brisbane ? 
  i 'm not even going to try . 
  if a paragraph on reddit is longer than about 10 lines , i just nope right out of there . 
  you do if you subscribe to / r/brisbane , 
  since the author is your brother , could you let him know that he 's repeatedly used `` it 's '' incorrectly . 
  for example :, 
   allowing the player to observe and adapt to it 's attack patterns, 
  it really should be `` adapt to its attack patterns '' . 
  in something that 's apparently supposed to be a professional article , it 's rather distracting . 
  other than that it 's a good article . 
  i particularly liked the idea of the `` rule breaker '' . 
  i would also highly recommend civ v , but i 'd recommend waiting . 
  it usually gets cheaper than this on steam during sales , and with that you get both the windows and os x versions . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , i do n't know all the technical details . 
  i 've never played around with it myself . 
  all i know is that previously , font rendering on os x looked much nicer than it did on windows ( in chrome ) . 
  now , at least with the settings i 've got ( and i have n't deliberately changed anything from the defaults ) , on windows it looks far more like it does on os x. 
  that 's a definite improvement . 
  [ this article ] ( http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/24/a-closer-look-at-font-rendering/ ) seems to have a good explanation of the difference in font rendering between the two . 
  i 'm just curious how much your peers use the two operating systems . 
  i definitely was n't a fan when i first started using it , but after having been 50/50 for a few years now , i find the windows rendering looks almost an\u00e6mic . 
  i 'm pretty sure lastpass has their own built-in 2-factor auth option . 
  i 'm not sure how/how well it works , though , because i 've never tried using it . 
  can you see it ? 
  i also use lastpass , just not their 2-factor . 
  just checked their page , and it turns out they 've got a * heap * of 2-factor options . 
  in addition to google auth , they also have toopher , duo , and transakt , none of which i 've ever heard of before . 
  there 's also an option to use yubikey , but only if you 're a lastpass premium subscriber . 
  and finally , they also have what they call their [ `` grid multifactor authentication '' ] ( https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/security-options/multifactor-authentication-options/grid-multifactor-authentication/ ) , which seems pretty cool , actually , especially if you 're overseas and do n't have internet access on your phone . 
  to be honest most games work without needing to remap keys or change layouts back anyway . 
  i * think * the way it works is that in these games , they 're programmed to recognise the signal that hardware button sends to the computer , rather than the one that the os has translated into a letter . 
  for games that do n't do this , i tend to just switch back to qwerty temporarily . 
  it 's much easier than going through and manually setting the keys how i want them , and it means that onscreen prompts work consistently . 
  hahahaha, 
  [ anemic ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anemic ), 
  of or pertaining to anemia, 
  ( by extension ) weak . 
  [ synonyms include `` feeble '' and `` frail '' ] ( http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/anemic?r=76&amp;src=ref&amp;ch=the ) . 
  that 's the usage i was going for here , not the literal scientific definition of an\u00e6mia as a disease that causes a reduction in the amount of red blood cells or h\u00e6moglobin in the blood . 
  but yeah , i would say that the fonts on windows certainly did look * sharper * , although i would say that it was sharper in a way that was n't exactly favourable . 
  yeah , that 's correct . 
  it starts out with some cool flavour text around being evil with each of the different power sources , then moves on to describe each of the themes you named . 
  depending on exactly why your player 's character is evil , they could be worth looking at . 
  disgraced nobel and vile scholar seem particularly interesting . 
  for paragon paths , berserker is only for evil fighters . 
  contract killer is for anyone trained in stealth , so would be particularly good for rogues , assassins , etc. 
  demonologist is for any arcane classes , so evil wizards etc. 
  could use it . 
  idol is for paladins and clerics , and vermin lord seems like it could be a cool paragon path for an evil druid . 
  reading the flavour text for the epic destiny exemplar of evil , i have to say it looks very cool . 
  it 's for any characters with an evil alignment . 
  the feats it gives you access to also look pretty cool . 
  the things i 've mentioned there are basically all the book has . 
  it 's definitely a worthwhile book if someone 's playing an evil character . 
  it may also be worth looking at the heroes of shadow book . 
  it 's got some cool classes like assassin , blackguard ( evil paladin ) , and vampire ; races like the shade , along with flavour text for playing shadow-based versions of a number of the phb1 races . 
  its paragon paths , epic destinies , and feats all relate to shadow , which is a good pick for evil characters . 
  high five !, 
  that 's what mine is , too . 
  [ goon ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/1qlp3j/after_drinking_goon_for_our_first_year_of_college/ ) . 
  he 's also only considering exactly one size if image . 
  in reality you can have anything from a 1x1 image to nxn for n arbitrarily large . 
  2 ) you just described the desmond story in assassin 's creed , basically . 
  wow this is awesome !, 
  i notice you said that you had lore etc. 
  for millicinia as well as some basic cultural details for the rest of the areas . 
  if you 've already got it written up , i wonder if you would n't mind sharing it here with us ? 
  i 'd be really interested to see it . 
  wow . 
  that 's some absolutely astounding world building you 've got there . 
  just ... wow . 
  so cool !, 
  til / r/ibcirclejerk is a thing . 
  [ apple has a two-factor authentication option ] ( http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5570 ) that would have prevented this . 
  it is n't apple 's fault if people choose not to use it . 
  social engineering is a technique that 's * very * difficult to protect against if users are n't doing everything they can to be secure . 
  i used to live in korea , and i remember one time school was shut down because of a horrible dust storm or something from china . 
  well you 're in luck . 
  because nobody is taking any rights away from you . 
  it 's still just as legal to smoke now as it was before , only a little more expensive . 
  would it not be true that if the course goes under a bridge or the watch otherwise loses its connection , then once the connection is re-established it will draw a direct line between when the signal was lost and when it was found ? 
  could n't that result in a significantly shorter reported distance , especially if the signal was lost for a significant amount of time and around a bend ? 
  wow . 
  you are a very kind person . 
  for clarification , are you just choosing to give away a copy of the game that you yourself bought ? 
  i find it mildly amusing that you talk about how `` female '' comes across as clinical , while using `` one '' as a pronoun . 
  ( in all seriousness , i love the pronoun `` one '' , and wish people used it more often . ), 
  wow . 
  very cool .
