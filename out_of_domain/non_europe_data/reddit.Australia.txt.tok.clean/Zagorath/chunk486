  keep being awesome . 
  personally , i think the uk 's system makes more sense at university . 
  university is the time where you learn in great depth into an area of interest . 
  you certainly need some breadth , but i feel it should be in areas specifically related to your actual degree . 
  for example , i 'm studying software engineering , but had to do some electrical engineering courses , as well as some more general engineering stuff . 
  but the uk takes this way too far , making students specialise during high school . 
  their a level system is just * awful * . 
  you do 3 subjects ( some do 4 , and a very small number of people choose to do 5 , but 3 is the standard ) . 
  just 3 . 
  there are n't any rules about which ones you can choose , either . 
  one person might do maths , physics , and chemistry , while another does music , art , and drama . 
  ( i 'm saying this , for what it 's worth , as an australian , going to uni in australia , but did the ib at an international school in high school . ), 
  does that not imply that grandma 's colonoscopy happened * at * aunt bill 's christmas party ? 
  i do n't want to think about that ... 
   and pipe to another script to detect nudity, 
  scripts that are capable of detecting nudity are easy to come by ? 
  holy fuck that 's like ... 2 metres , is n't it ? 
  if the women 's basketball team is that tall , how tall are the men in the nba ? 
  you do n't write multiple different versions . 
  you just write code that 's designed to work well on multiple screens ( e.g. 
  using percentages for widths of screen elements ) . 
  how the hell do you think programmes for windows , linux , or ( to a lesser extent ) os x get developed ? 
  you do n't think they write versions for every possible hardware configuration , do you ? 
  it 's not just the hardware . 
  apple provides tools to developers that make things a lot easier than what exists for android . 
  is it worth checking out swift if you do n't intend to write an app for ios ? 
  ( or alternatively , is it possible to write ios apps that you only distribute to friends and family , without needing to pay developer 's fees ? ), 
  australia certainly sees an enormous proportion of immigrants , and we do n't have that sort of law . 
  pretty sure britain does n't have that law , either , and immigration there is very high , too . 
  ah right . 
  so the women in this picture are probably among the tallest in their league ? 
  that * is * a fun fact . 
  i may have to quote you on that . 
  there 's nothing fun about fun sized lollies . 
  is the other gillard of rudd ? 
  but that 's interesting . 
  i knew abbott was born in the uk , but did n't realise one of the others was , too . 
  you almost literally could not have picked a location further away from where i am . 
  do you know what an ekg is ? 
  those squiggly lines that doctors read to evaluate your heart and see if you are having a heart attack ? 
  there is a guide to interpreting those squiggly ekg lines that is pretty much considered a standard in the industry -- we call it the bible of ekgs . 
  well , the cardiologist who had dutifully written and updated this manual for all these years has been doing it from prison . 
  he is a pedophile . 
  not quite . 
  that would mean what us currently 12:01 pm would become 24:01 , and then jump back to 13:00 at 1:00 pm . 
  add 12 from 1pm . 
  that 's more like it . 
  wp : npov probably put a stop to that . 
  tell ya what , i 'd rather that than the snare part in bol\u00e9ro . 
  cool . 
  i 'll have to give it a look when i get the chance . 
  from briefly skimming that page , it looks kinda like the actual language takes some of the best from python and from c-like languages . 
  i meant to ask before , can you also use this to write programmes for os x ? 
  i think the best one i 've ever read about is probably [ this one , titled `` the medusa '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2cc629/the_medusa/ ) . 
  really makes you think . 
  if you find it difficult to read ( i know i did ) , i posted a summary of the events in the comments . 
  [ this is what it should look like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6joatuc.png ) . 
  have you got anything that might be blocking content on the page ( like noscript or such ) ? 
  edit : or adblock . 
  somehow it was blocking the voting buttons on my laptop , but was n't on my desktop ... 
  over eating and lack of exercise combined . 
  the others are insignificant , but you need both of those two factors working together . 
  one 's weight is a function of the energy input ( amount and type of food ) vs. the energy output ( amount of exercise ) . 
  one can eat enormous amounts , but still remain at a healthy weight if they also exercise a heap . 
  you sure that 's it ? 
  i assumed the joke was that 's what jay thought , but it actually is his wallet . 
  perhaps i 'm thinking of it differently , but when i read the word `` eh '' like that , i 'm thinking of it being a sort of thoughtful but doubtful noise . 
  that 's how i would use it . 
  it 's like `` ehh ... 
  i get what you 're saying , but i 'm not sure i agree . '', 
  oh right . 
  that 's a detail i did n't notice . 
  i doubt it 's a deliberate design choice . 
  just a weird quirk of the adblocking software interacting with however they 've implemented it . 
  can hardly blame them , though . 
  web developers should n't have to consider people running software designed specifically to break how the web works when developing their websites . 
  right , that 's why i said i may have been thinking of it differently . 
  certainly any time i use `` eh '' at the beginning of a point , it 's to convey doubtfulness . 
  i 've used it online many times , too ( [ an example ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/2ewaaf/a_picture_of_my_friends_little_cousin_before_and/ck48k6k?context=3 ) ) . 
  i hope no one 's misinterpreted it as being dismissive ... because it certainly has never meant to be . 
  like you say , we 've got `` meh '' for that . 
  absolutely ** do not ** go with telstra , optus , or vodafone for your telco . 
  they 're just completely unnecessarily expensive . 
  you 'll easily be paying double what the alternatives cost . 
  instead , find an mvno that resells one of those networks . 
  you may have heard of ting in the us , they 're an mvno that resells sprint 's network . 
  optus 's network has the most choice here . 
  i 'm with [ vaya ] ( http://vaya.net.au/ ) , but the plan that i 'm on is no longer available , so i 'd probably recommend [ amaysim ] ( http://www.amaysim.com.au/ ) instead . 
  there are a number of others if you google . 
  there 's a lot less choice on telstra 's network , but [ boost ] ( http://www.boost.com.au/ ) and [ lycamobile ] ( http://www.lycamobile.com.au/en/ ) both seem pretty decent options . 
  a quick glance suggests their pricing is n't as great as the optus resellers , though . 
  regarding the networks , telstra 's network is undeniably better , however in brisbane and other cities this should n't really be too much of a problem . 
  you 'll only notice it if you go out into the country -- though you do n't have to go * too * far before it can start being noticeable . 
  without knowing anything about you personally , i would say that for most people optus 's network is definitely good enough that the other advantages of going with an optus mvno outweigh the coverage difference . 
  the base level mbpw/r is us$ 1299 . 
  the equivalent in australia costs au$ 1,599 , which includes au$ 146 of tax . 
  that 's $ 1453 without counting tax . 
  translate that into usd and you get $ 1358.44 . 
  a small price increase , but not a substantial one . 
  under 5 % .
