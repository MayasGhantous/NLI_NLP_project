  consider that the $ 1199 au figure includes taxes . 
  about $ 109 worth , to be precise ( according to [ this page ] ( http://store.apple.com/au/buy-mac/macbook-air ) , which is n't lenovo , but it has something worth the same price , and i already had it open , so i 'm using it ) . 
  after adjusting for the exchange rate , that gives you $ 1019.06 us . 
  so it 's down to a 25 % increase in price . 
  considering how minor the improvement in the processor is , that seems a bit steeper than is reasonably justifiable , but not quite as bad as the 50 % increase that just looking at the numbers from the beginning . 
  can confirm this . 
  looked at getting a buffet clarinet . 
  ended up being cheaper to get the * next model up * from england than it was to buy the model i wanted here . 
  i would say that the existence of a russia tax does n't change the fact that there 's an australia tax . 
  so i would define the `` australia tax '' as being when the price of something here in australia is significantly more than it is in its country of origin and/or its biggest market ( i.e. , the us , at least in most cases ) . 
  remembering to subtract gst before making the comparison , where appropriate . 
  for `` significant '' , i 'd probably place it at around the 10 % mark , but others may want to argue for a different value . 
  a bit of string attached to something . 
  actually nah , that would never work . 
  never mind . 
  i do n't really think i went to `` that level '' . 
  i would argue that my analysis is the bare minimum one should do when making this comparison , so that you 're comparing the same things . 
  in this case , though , even after the comparison is made on equal footing , there 's a 25 % difference , which i think is totally unacceptable . 
  as for shipping costs , that 's a really good point . 
  i do n't really know what the difference in cost is . 
  it would be interesting to see . 
  obviously it 's a shorter distance , which -- ceteris paribus -- would be cheaper , but then the quantity they ship to the us is probably much greater , and that may decrease the cost per unit . 
  so yeah , it 'd be interesting to see all the data . 
  i ca n't speak to itunes and the app store , i never buy from them and have n't looked at prices . 
  but for their hardware -- or at least their macs -- there is very little australia tax . 
  [ i just ran the numbers on the cheapest retina macbook pro ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2fevuw/raustralia_its_time_we_built_a_name_and_shame/ck8qnwm?context=1 ) , and once you remove gst and adjust for exchange rates , the difference is only about 5 % . 
  that 's not what / u/thesmiddy said ; do n't twist his words . 
  it should become * less * of a problem . 
  and considering the number of previously refused classification games that have since been released ( most notably just recently with l4d2 in its full form ) , it clearly is * less * of a problem . 
  not no problem at all , but less of one . 
  they might not anymore , but previously , with the boxed copies , they certainly did . 
  remember the stories about it being cheaper to fly to the us , stay a few nights , buy it there , and then return back to australia , than it would be to just buy it here ? 
  good on 'em for fixing it , though . 
  dreamspark is bloody amazing . 
  in all honesty , i 'd probably still be running windows xp were it not for being able to get windows 8.1 for free thanks to my uni 's engineering department offering access to so much free microsoft stuff through dreamspark . 
  which is perhaps why rather than adding on us state taxes , it 's better to subtract gst from the australian price in order to make the comparison . 
   still an unjustifiably large cut, 
  pretty sure from what i 've heard the norm before apple came along was much * worse * for developers . 
  you 've got to remember that they provide hosting , advertising , and really easy access to customers . 
  those are all pretty significant . 
  if you try to look at apps for android that are n't in google play , i imagine you 'll find that download numbers across the board are much lower than they are on the play store , even for free apps . 
  the difference is -- i would imagine -- even more significant when the developer wants people to pay for their app . 
  [ here 's another way of tying cables ] ( http://youtu.be/z7-l-pivwny ) , in a little-known video by a very well-known youtuber . 
  for some cables this might not be great ( i do n't know ) , but for most standard cables ( e.g. 
  usb , ethernet , and power cables ) it should have no impact whatsoever . 
  the top comment has a pretty decent explanation of it . 
  the prices in apple 's online store . 
  rrp as a concept does n't really make sense for a company for which the majority of sales are through channels it has absolute control over . 
  sure , you * can * buy them from elsewhere , but that 's not the point . 
  you ca n't accuse apple of price gauging or whatever if the prices you 're comparing are n't those sold by apple . 
  mate is n't sydney where funnel webs are ? 
  but yeah , i 'm from brisbane and the worst i 've seen is probably red back spiders . 
  or maybe magpies . 
  fuck magpies . 
  in reality it 's definitely not as bad as people like to make out . 
  considering its use within the lord of the rings ( as the main leitmotif for mordor ) , i think it 's probably fair to ascribe to it the properties of the dies irae . 
  huh , i did n't realise that pattern was the dies irae . 
  [ i used it quite extensively in my own compositions ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfvcnlsco4o ) , but at the time the only example i was really familiar with was shore 's score for the lord of the rings . 
  i did n't realise i was evoking anything greater than that . 
  i was n't even familiar with berlioz 's symphonie fantastique until my teacher told me my composition sounded similar . 
  it 's definitely a very cool motif . 
  one thing i find interesting is that the two most famous iterations of the dies irae in a full requiem ( [ mozart 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkjur8wpfym ) and [ verdi 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgvyamixuxu ) ) , do n't really follow this pattern . 
  haha that 's a good point . 
  i have to admit the only apps that i 've really gotten outside of the play store have been piracy related ... 
  and yeah , in the abstract , your other point definitely makes a lot of sense . 
  i 'm just not sure i agree that it applies here . 
  the reason i think the app store or google play store are good value is because of the exposure and advertising they provide for developers , as well as providing for bandwidth and hosting . 
  many people simply would n't find out about many apps without these stores . 
  not sure i agree about the tenuity of them ( at least the examples of lord of the rings and the berlioz are pretty blatant , and from context the horror movie -- i forget which one they did -- would make sense if it was deliberate ) , but yeah , the narration over the vocals was pretty damn annoying . 
  okay then . 
  please elaborate on your clearly far more superior understanding of businesses . 
  why is it not a video comparison to compare how much apple charges for a computer in the us to how much they charge for the same computer in australia . 
  hmm that 's interesting . 
  which are you with ? 
  i certainly do n't remember ever having to call vaya up to get wireless hotspots working on my phone . 
  wow , that 's a really good , solid , explanation of the history of it . 
  dat semantic satiation . 
  i thought 2013 was time travel . 
  was that 2012 ? 
  edit : [ yes it was ] ( http://mashable.com/2012/04/04/reddit-timeline-aftermath/ ) . 
  i 've been on this site too long ... 
  punctuation is important kids !, 
  yeah seriously . 
  google + is way better than facebook in terms of ux and features . 
  all its lacking is the users . 
  and since the switch to g + on youtube comments , the quality of said comments has increased * dramatically * . 
  the ability to post longer , more thoughtful comments , to share links , and most importantly to respond in-line have all been absolutely crucial in improving youtube 's comment section . 
  being attached to a `` real name '' seems to have decreased the amount of trolls out there , too , although since the real name aspect is easy to get around , it has n't cut it out entirely . 
  yeah , it was , i just looked it up ( see edit ) . 
  but yeah , me too . 
  i think i joined up late february that year . 
  even at 20 that 's only a touch more than one month of gold every two years . 
  wrong space show . 
  that one was more of a tongue twister for me . 
  did n't they give channels the option to have `` page '' accounts pretty soon after ? 
  i know cgpgrey has still never revealed his face ( yet ) , and his youtube account is n't tied to a real-person account . 
  yeah it definitely was n't available at launch . 
  from memory , though , i do n't think it was too long before they had it working . 
  inb4 `` nice try microsoft employee '', 
  you keep using this term `` street price '' .
