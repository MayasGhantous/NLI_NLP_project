  haha it 's definitely not a bad thing . 
  just surprised me . 
   folks already complain of too much filler, 
  which folks are they ? 
  most of what i 've seen has been people pointing out that the problem with korra is that they * have n't * had that time to allow the characters to grow . 
  until confirmed otherwise ( and i doubt that will happen ) i 'm going to continue believing that the bosco thing is only a rumour . 
  you 're kidding , right ? 
  on most images the focus is really noticeably off ( taking just the first one , it seems to be focused on her elbow , rather than her face ) , and in a few there seems to even be motion blur/shake . 
  the focus problem is understandable . 
  shooting wide open on an f/1 .4 is going to make getting accurate focus * really * difficult , but with posed photos ( as most of these seem to be ) it should n't be too hard to get a spot focus on the face of the subject . 
  that said , many of them are framed pretty nicely . 
  i particularly liked the framing on the [ first photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9pbsm6q.jpg ) and the [ matt smith/doctor who photo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/isss6ch.jpg ) ( apart from the distracting person in the very foreground -- probably should 've cropped them out ) . 
  i 'm just curious which autofocus mode you used ? 
  i would generally recommend shooting in single-point auto focus . 
  it allows you to exactly specify the point that will be in focus . 
  when taking photos of people , generally you should try to focus on the face -- or the eyes , if you 're able to be that accurate . 
  if you 're not sure how to use single-point af , it should be easy to find guides on it online , or i can try and walk you through it if you want ( though i do n't have a 5dmiii , so it may be difficult ) . 
  as for the glasses , personally i keep mine on when i shoot , but i know many people with glasses take them off to get their eye closer to the eyepiece , so not wearing glasses at all should n't be * too * much of a problem . 
  just make sure the diopter is set correctly for your eye . 
  which mode you shoot in should n't really matter . 
  i tend to go just raw , but jpeg + raw is a great option if you want to be able to quickly share any photos online , but still have the raw to do more fine-grained editing later . 
  jpeg only is generally only worthwhile if you * only * plan to share things without editing -- but be careful with this , because you ca n't get the quality back once you 've shot with jpeg-only . 
  the photos are very noticeably out of focus . 
  i was simply pointing that out . 
  getting accurate focus is one of the most basic and important aspects of photography . 
  i was offering constructive criticism to op , which [ it seems to me that op appreciated ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/2fpea9/oz_comiccon_brisbane_07_september_2014/ckbj1zg?context=2 ) . 
  wow thanks !, 
  if you ever want some advice do n't hesitate to ask . 
  i was n't there , but my experience is that in most buildings the lighting is n't great for photography . 
  still , f/1 .4 is probably still overkill . 
  to shoot without flash , i 'd probably want to be at f/2 .6 or more ( though i 've picked that number as more of an educated guess than any reasoned estimate ) . 
  and definitely , closing down the aperture would make a massive difference , especially if the focus is just a little off . 
  that , combined with single-point af set onto the face , would dramatically improve these photos . 
  got ta borrow that line . 
  i like it . 
  but fwiw , i 'm also not really an expert , but i definitely do n't think you were `` verbalising per rectum '' . 
  what should the professional gamer be doing ? 
  yeah this is exactly how most of my classes have been run -- only substituting visual studio for idle/eclipse/the terminal , depending on the language . 
  cheques are n't used very often here , so i do n't really know what they look like , but would n't your name also disappear , assuming you wrote it in the same ink ? 
  living in the dmz would be better than being in north korea . 
   and people do n't care whether or not a math major uses a computer while in school, 
  they do at my uni . 
  there are a couple of first year compulsory courses for all science , maths , and engineering bachelor degrees that has a matlab component . 
  the same is probably true for later courses in maths , but i 'm doing software engineering so i would n't know . 
  they are in romantic comedies . 
  as far as i 'm aware , on ios you can either have a 4-digit pin or a full text entry password . 
  if it 's a pin , then for any date there are at least four possibilities that make sense : ddmm , mmdd , mmyy , yymm . 
  if it 's text entry , things get much more complicated . 
  is it the full name of the month , or the three-letter-abbreviation , is it date month year or month date year , or some other combination ? 
  do you include spaces or not ? 
  perhaps you only include the date and month but not the year , and maybe you have the day of the week . 
  you can see how , at least if it was a text entry password , it would be easy to get it wrong even if you knew the correct date . 
   we can all agree that the term, 
    butter, 
   means butter, 
  actually , no we ca n't . 
  i know i use the term `` butter '' to refer to what is , in fact , margarine , all the time . 
  it 's easier to say that i want `` butter and honey '' or `` vegemite and butter '' on my toast than it is to specify margarine , and i do n't particularly care which i get ( though most of the time you 're more likely to get margarine ) . 
   in fact it upsets me that bruce wayne and gordon know each other from an early age, 
  i 'm not huge into comic book lore , but that particular aspect does n't really matter much to me . 
  other batmans have had close relationships between the two characters , and at least one adaption has played with the idea that wayne knew gordon from a young age . 
  what does bother me , though , is the idea that many iconic batman villains will be in gotham . 
  as i said , i 'm not big into comic lore , but i was under the impression that most of these villains are supposed to have arisen * because of * batman , and so for them to be around before him seems wrong . 
  yeah honestly . 
  i thought it was on the front page because of the two attractive girls , or possibly something racist regarding the guy whose face is completely covered . 
  i do n't know about listening to them , but in [ aboriginal culture ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_aboriginal_avoidance_practices#avoidance_of_naming_the_dead ) they avoid seeing the image or speaking the name of recently deceased people , as a mark of respect for the dead . 
  only if you 're defining `` average '' to be `` median '' . 
  if we 're using the mean that is n't necessarily the case . 
  for example , three people with an iq of 90 and one with an iq of 160 would result in three people below average and one above it . 
  sure , in modelling of a normal distribution , the mean and median are the same point , but that is n't * necessarily * the case for a real population . 
  in australia ( or at least queensland ) at a four way stop you are required to always give way to the right . 
  seeing as we have the driver 's seat on the right side of the car , it makes sense . 
  you can easily see right , but the other person ca n't necessarily see you ( to their left ) quite so easily . 
  in the us or canada it would make sense more sense to go counter-clockwise , i would have thought , since the driver sits on the left . 
  i 'm going to advise you . 
  spell it `` advice '' . 
  iq is , but i was only using iq as an example . 
  it 's by no means the only measure of intelligence , and the above principle applies to things completely unrelated to intelligence , too . 
  with technology-related things , sure , but going to the front page of / r/eli5 right now , many of them probably work better for 5 than 86 . 
  [ this , for example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2fqr3c/eli5_this_gif/ ) , and [ very much so this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2ful2p/eli5_why_were_germany_and_japan_allies_in_ww2/ ) . 
  as / u/monkeymanmars said , martin had originally planned to have a timeskip ( from memory , i think it was going to be 5 years ) after the first book . 
  so he had their ages at the beginning be so young to accommodate . 
  he then realised it would n't make sense to have a timeskip -- that things needed to start happening straight away -- so he removed it , and was left stuck with many characters much younger than he would have liked them . 
  starting with the characters a little older in the show , therefore , not only helps with the whole child sex vibe , but also in a way makes it * closer * to what martin would have wanted in the books originally . 
  have to agree with this . 
  i installed origin because i grabbed a few ea games in a humble bundle , and i actually liked the application much more than steam . 
  i found it had more or less the same features , but presented much more nicely . 
  the option to narrow my library by platform , or by recently played , installed , etc. 
  was much more visible than on steam . 
  it 's in more or less the same * location * , but the interface is so much less cluttered-looking . 
  even so , i 'm never going to use it except for those handful of games i got in the humble bundle and occasionally when origin gives a game away for free ( usually not games that i 'm interested in , though ) . 
  just does n't have that ecosystem of games . 
  is there actually a what if xkcd on a topic similar to this ? 
  i feel like there really * really * should be . 
  i 'm curious , is there any particular reason you did it with a document like this rather than using google drive or something similar ? 
  anyway , if possible , i 'd really like to see the results . 
  i 'm interested in starting to learn one of tolkien 's elvish languages , and it could be useful to see how other people approached it . 
  i use [ sharex ] ( https://code.google.com/p/sharex/ ) , which is open source and extremely powerful . 
  i 've got it set up so all it does is upload to imgur and copy the url automatically , but it can do a hell of a lot more than that .
