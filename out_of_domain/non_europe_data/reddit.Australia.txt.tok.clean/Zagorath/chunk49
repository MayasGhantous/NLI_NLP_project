  get rid of * all * software patents . 
  the majority of good patents i 've seen from apple are in the hardware anyway . 
  i disagree . 
  i do n't think software patents should be allowed at all , either a specific way or vague as they currently are . 
  apple also has hardware patents , and for the most part those are reasonable ones that they should be allowed to keep . 
  also , apple is n't the only one abusing the patent system . 
  virtually every major company is equally at fault , just does n't get as much press about it . 
  for example , one of samsung 's patents is for `` listening to music whilst browsing a menu '' . 
  haha fair enough , that would explain it . 
  ah ok , fair enough . 
  that does make sense . 
  i think he meant the act of getting your phone , plugging it in , transferring the code , unplugging , and testing the app is too slow compared to simply using an emulator . 
  either way , i agree you guys are right about it being an emulator for development purposes . 
  which has its own problems , namely having to set up the ssh and go to the effort of transfering using it . 
  i 'm completely talking out of my arse on this one , i do n't really know a think about it , by i imagine using the simulator probably would still be less hassle . 
  a very well spoken description of the theory , but look at it in practice . 
  look at canada , the uk , or australia . 
  not perfect systems , but they do work , and are far less broken than what the us has now . 
  if i want , in australia , i can vote 1 greens , knowing that although they wo n't win , i 'm not compromising labor 's chances of winning because i can vote 2 labor . 
  i do n't know exactly how it works in canada and the uk , but they both work well , moreso than in the us . 
  apostolate 2012, 
  you should update your alien blue version , then . 
  it does have an edit function . 
  just click on the comment ( same as you would if you were going to upvote/downvote someone else 's comment ) , then press the little pencil icon . 
  this is brilliant , but i prefer the second movement . 
  that cor anglais solo is just heavenly !, 
  what if i 'm redditing from within vietnam ? 
  i think it 's more complicated than that . 
  while they 're the same company , the divisions like these within korean companies are very different to western companies . 
  they have far more control over themselves . 
  i could be wrong , though . 
  i 'm probably wrong . 
  yeah it 'd be pretty stupid otherwise . 
  imagine a hypothetical country with tax-free up to $ 20,000 a year , then 10 % tax after that . 
  a person making $ 19,000 would keep everything , and a person making $ 21,000 would pay 10 % , or $ 2,100 in tax , leaving them with $ 18,900 . 
  obviously this does n't make sense , so they only pay tax on the excess , so 10 % of $ 1000 , or $ 100 , leaving them with $ 20,900 . 
  ( dnalchemist , obviously you know this , this is more for anyone that does n't understand the system . ), 
  this is / r/funny , not an android subreddit . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  i 'm a huge fan of apple products , but if i were to buy a smartphone right now , it 'd be the galaxy siii . 
  the iphone 's alright , but just not the best choice for me . 
  ( currently stuck with a sony ericsson dumb candybar phone . ), 
  i 'm not going to treat people differently because they have an iphone or an android , or even windows phone . 
  blackberry , on the other hand ... ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ kidding, 
  edit : it 'd * be * , not it 'd * by *, 
  i 'm pretty sure there are some sad souls that post their own original content on 9gag . 
  as much as i also would be interested to know -- does he really need to say ? 
  maybe there 's nothing specific , just a general feel . 
  ( there probably is , though . ), 
  the person i was replying to said that you get bashing of non-apple products on / r/apple , and that you should expect bashing of apple products here , because `` this place is for android '' ( that 's paraphrased as i ca n't remember the exact words he used ) . 
  why do n't you consider context before needlessly bashing someone . 
  no worries , thanks for the apology . 
  haha yeah , i 've jokingly said that to a few people before . 
  `` in a month 's time i 'll want an iphone , 6 months after that it 'll be whatever the latest android is '' etc. 
  the only thing that makes me think that may not be true is that a major part of my reason for preferring android is that i * love * google 's ecosystem . 
  gmail , google docs , etc. , then there 's also the more open nature , how you can customise it more . 
  then again , apple may surprise me . 
  i honestly did n't realise any people actually thought that this was the case . 
  if it is ... 
  wow , i feel bad for society . 
  you probably got this , but just gon na clarify in case , or for anyone else . 
  emphasis to poohunter 's comment on the word * sound * . 
  example , `` hour '' starts with a vowel * sound * , so it 's ** an ** hour . 
  `` union '' starts with a consonant * sound * , so it 's ** a ** union . 
  seriously ? 
  i had to do the lowest-level heal other type spell . 
  if you were anything like me , that was n't too far back . 
  it 's worth playing on pc just for that . 
  edit : but let 's not get into a console debate ), 
  what if the game they 're developing is a swimming game ? 
  or cycling ? 
  or , heck , a car racing game . 
  yeah , i suppose that makes sense . 
  the first time i learned about income tax brackets , i asked basically that exact question , so i guess my inquisitiveness spared me that mistake ( finally , something it 's good for ) . 
  i agree with you completely , except `` the interface is much better '' . 
  while i prefer android 's interface , that little bit of it is purely opinion and people who think different simply can not be called wrong . 
  i personally quite like the look of android , but i agree it 's not quite as polished as ios . 
  yep , i agree completely . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of too many widgets , but would like a few . 
  i also agree that at the moment ipad is easily the best tablet . 
  honestly , when they first came out i thought that by this stage they would have caught up properly , but i guess i overestimated them a little . 
  to me it seems that just now they 're starting serious progress , and hopefully in 2 years they 'll be at the same stage as they are with phones ( i.e. , as good as if not better than ios ) . 
  general certificate of secondary education , or gcse , is taken by students in britain who are in what americans would call freshman and sophmore years of high school . 
  definitely not an advanced technical certification , 
  what 's musescore 's sound set like ? 
  one reason i love sibelius is that the sounds it can export are really good , which is great when you 're composing without the intention of having the piece performed by real musicians .

  i 'm with f2u , i think that sib7 was made by the same team as older sibelius versions . 
  personally , i loved the ribbon when it was in ms office , but i do n't think it transferred well when put into sibelius . 
  that said , i did n't give it a fair chance ( only the short duration of the free trial ) . 
  i definitely think for new users the new interface will be a vast improvement , and for old users it probably will be just as good once they give it a few months of use to get used to it . 
  ( the only professional composer who 's opinion i 've heard on this says that for him , once he was used to it , he actually found it an improvement . ), 
  honestly , you ca n't blame them for it not working in older versions of windows . 
  that 's simply not a legitimate argument . 
  if you do n't like the interface , that 's fine , that 's a problem with the programme .
