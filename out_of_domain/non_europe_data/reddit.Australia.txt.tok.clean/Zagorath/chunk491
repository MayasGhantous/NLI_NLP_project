  we do n't normally come across each other so soon after the last time . 
  i 'm pretty sure the receivers they showed in the videos were paywave/paypass receivers , so that gives some hope . 
  the nob on the right hand side seems to be a pretty major user input device . 
  it also doubles as the home button . 
  being on the right , if you wear it on your right wrist ( as most lefties do ) , you 'll have to reach over the watch in an awkward way in order to use it . 
  yes it was . 
  it 'll be hard to use on the right hand . 
  what 's that got to do with it ? 
  the nob will be pointing up the arm , instead of out towards the hand . 
  that means in order to use it with your left hand , you 'll have to reach over the top of the watch . 
  it 's awkward . 
  you can use your thumb . 
  that 's how i would normally use it , between my thumb and index finger . 
  but that does n't in any way prevent me from needing to reach over . 
  the speed cap is the stupidest fucking design . 
  i 'm sure * no one * would * ever * want to play ingress on the bus , or god forbid * while another person was driving * . 
  yes it would . 
  it absolutely is cheating , and if you know of anyone doing that you should report them . 
  i just wan na say you are an awesome big sibling . 
  ( i wan na say big sister , but i 'm not entirely sure . ), 
  [ this is what it would be like to use if it were on the left hand side of the watch ] ( http://imgur.com/yxfrbpy ) . 
  whereas with it in the right side , [ you have to reach over like so ] ( http://imgur.com/esl02x0 ) . 
  it 's pretty obviously more inconvenient and awkward to use , so i 'm really not sure what point you 're trying to make here . 
   you can have 2 accounts just because you want to play in both factions , or whatever . 
  no , you ca n't . 
  in the rules , having two account is * necessarily * cheating . 
  it does n't matter why you do it , or even if they 're on the same faction . 
  if you suspect it , contact the person involved and their faction . 
  if they provide you with a reasonable explanation ( such as `` it 's me and my so '' in the case of an accusation of two accounts in the army faction ) then drop it . 
  if they do n't , then report them to google . 
  they 've got enough data that they should be able to determine the truth of the matter . 
  i did n't need to be up early , and i love technology . 
  it 's fun seeing this stuff as it happens . 
  i did the same thing at google i/o , though not wwdc , since on that occasion i did need to be up early . 
  i do n't know if you could before or not , but you definitely ca n't now . 
  yeah , i 'm definitely not `` pissed '' . 
  disappointed is more like it . 
  not that it matters . 
  i 'm a mac user , but the only ios device i 've ever owned was a 3rd gen ipod touch . 
  i was never going to buy the apple watch anyway . 
  [ did someone say `` how evil samsung is '' ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ), 
  ( but seriously , they are a really shitty company and have been for a long time . ), 
  just want to be clear , there 's a difference between a phablet and a tablet with phone functionality . 
  thing 's like the samsung note and the iphone 6 + are phablets . 
  that old samsung 7-inch tablet ( i think it might have been called `` galaxy tab '' or something ) was a tablet that could also make phone calls . 
  atheist - / -  preachy , however \u03c1 ( / r/atheism subscriber , preachy ) is some large value . 
  that could be it , but it seems more like they 're just moving away from the ibranding altogether . 
  it 's run its course . 
  their nfc payment system also does n't have the ibranding to it . 
  even better :, 
  pro tip , ctrl-shift-b or cmd-shift-b to hide the bookmarks bar before taking screenshots . 
  easier than editing it out in post . 
  good to see i 'm not the only one up at weird hours . 
  i killed its children , too . 
  and then reaped them . 
  it 's 3rd person , is n't it ? 
  not just seems , absolutely * is * less strenuous . 
  both swimming and cycling are non-load-bearing activities , which makes a massive difference . 
  pretty sure swimming in particular is often recommended for people with injuries . 
  here 's a random passage from a storm of swords . 
  it 's a catelyn chapter :, 
   ser desmond grell had served house tully all his life . 
  he had been a squire when catelyn was born , a knight when she learned to walk and ride and swim , master-at-arms by the day that she was wed. 
  he had seen lord hoster 's little cat become a young woman , a great lord ` os lady , mother to a king . 
  * and now he has seen me become a traitor as well * . 
   her brother edmure had named ser desmond castellan of riverrun when he rode off to battle ... 
  the majority of this is what would be referred to as first person limited . 
  it 's telling very strictly from the point of view of the pov character , but in the third person ( using `` he/she '' , rather than `` i '' ) . 
  it does , however , occasionally switch into first person for a brief thought from the current pov character , indicated by italics . 
  her answer character ? 
  wait what 's this story about ? 
  i missed it ... 
  on a weirdly related note , anz has the particular advantage over other australian banks that they have a much more significant international presence -- at least in south east asia -- than any other . 
  nope , it is . 
  cambodian government has a 20 % stake in it . 
  the vietnam government owns a further 15 % , and china owns 16 % . 
  anyone speak elvish ( most likely quenya based on the vowel placement ) that can translate that ? 
  that 's the transliteration of the carving on the box ( i think ... there 're a couple of characters i 'm not sure about ) . 
  no , the official dnd elvish script is called [ rellanic ] ( http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120429214149/dnd4/images/3/39/elven_script_%28rellanic%29.jpg ) . 
  it 's not very complex , though . 
  its characters map 1:1 with the standard latin alphabet used in english , and the numbers 1 through 0 . 
   the british season 2 is not very similar to the american series so far, 
  i disagree . 
  the interaction between urquhart and the king felt very similar to the interaction between underwood and the president . 
  obviously the actual roles of the king in the uk and the president in the us are not very similar , but the way their characters were portrayed , and more importantly the way the francises interacted with them was pretty similar , too . 
  add to that the stuff with other characters ( [ hoc uk s02 spoilers ] ( #s `` stamper 's death being the most obvious '' ) ) , it seems to me that season 2 of the us version was heavily based on to play the king . 
  edit : spoiler tag, 
  edit2 : removed spoiler tags , they did n't work . 
  edit3 : got css working . 
  spoiler tags back in . 
  given the amount of people asking for it , maybe you could post them as a link , for the karma . 
  what 's a bit worth in bitcoin ? 
  that 's a term i have n't heard before . 
  i asked this in the other thread , but if anyone here has an answer , i 'd love to know :, 
  anyone speak elvish ( most likely quenya based on the vowel placement ) that can translate that ? 
  that 's the transliteration of the carving on the box ( i think ... there 're a couple of characters i 'm not sure about ) . 
  i do n't know if i have a favourite , per se , but i 'm playing a shardmind at the moment and i love it . 
  playing it as a very recently awakened shardmind that loves knowledge and learning . 
  in particular , it ( playing it as a-gendered and asexual ) has difficulty understanding human emotions , but wants to learn more .
