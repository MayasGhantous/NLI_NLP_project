  fits well with the phb3 description of them as being very logical and low in emotions . 
  i ca n't help but feel it might be easier to do it with a more uniform distribution if you represented the roll of the dice as a binary number . 
  3 bits , each set to be randomly on or off on a given roll . 
  if it rolls a 0 or a 7 , just discard it . 
  you could have the same hardware also roll a d8 by counting the 0 as an 8 . 
  yeah definitely agree . 
  i do n't like 5e for a number of reasons , but being confusing is definitely not on that list . 
  this is in response to [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dnd/comments/2g5sm4/so_my_friend_made_a_d6_in_his_engineering_class/ ) . 
  it 's a java dice class i wrote which can be used to get ( pseudo ) random results for a dice of any number of sides . 
  yeah definitely not fantastic . 
  i do n't know how the version he 's got works , but the fact that it produces a single number 30 % of the time is obviously * really * bad . 
  even a crude pseudo-random generator should n't be that bad . 
  my suggestion was simply to help make it at least uniform -- because of course it is possible for the results to be perfectly or near-perfectly uniform while still having something that 's not great for crypto ( due to having some sort of pattern ) . 
  i figured using a simple yes/no result three times is probably simpler and easier to get uniform results out of than a setup that 's complicated enough to produce a single light representing a decimal number from 1 to 6 . 
  [ i also just recently submitted this response ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dnd/comments/2g6kvz/so_i_made_some_dice_of_my_own_in_my_spare_time/ ) showing how to make a dice rolling class in java . 
  because why not ? 
  are forks acceptable ? 
  representative mythology . 
  i like it . 
  good spot . 
  it probably would be semantically more correct to have this.r ... , but in java it is n't strictly speaking necessary if you do n't also have a local variable with that name . 
  it 's called a full stop ? 
  the dvorak layout that most people use today has numbers in the normal layout . 
  take a look at the images in the guides in the sidebar . 
  when you 're not programming , i would recommend using that , it 's much better for normal typing . 
  the standard dvorak layout should be included in your operating system . 
  for programming , [ i made my own version based off of programmer 's dvorak ] ( http://imgur.com/fxxvjqm ) , which i find much nicer in a few ways . 
  mainly the numbers being in the same order , but i also prefer where it places the brackets , square brackets , and braces . 
  you 're perfectly welcome to take it if you want , or to adapt it for your own use . 
  check out [ keyboard layout manager ] ( http://www.klm32.com/ ) on windows or [ ukelele ] ( http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=ukelele ) for os x to create custom keyboard layouts . 
  edit : [ this image shows the layout more accurately relative to where the actual keys are ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kbd99xg.png ) -- the other one shifts things along because of the delete and esc keys ' placement -- but at the expense of only showing the first layer of characters . 
  [ just for you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a0yiun7.png ) . 
  i think there 's a bot in this subreddit that does something like that , too . 
  [ roll 2d8 ], 
  edit : never mind . 
  bot is n't up anymore . 
  they do n't run at all ( on an ongoing basis ) . 
  you use them once to generate a keyboard layout file , and from there the operating system handles it . 
  i made it so that all of the matching bracket pairs are typed with the same finger making more or less the same action . 
  obviously i wanted the numbers to be in the right order . 
  beyond that , i just tried to keep most of the symbols in pretty much the same place as they are on the original programmer dvorak , making a few changes that had flow-on effects as a result of wanting to put numbers in the right places and moving brackets . 
  you tweaked the font yourself ? 
  that 's impressive . 
  but i 'm curious . 
  you got a link to your customised version ? 
  good call . 
  definitely got ta fix that . 
  also anything john williams , really . 
  this was definitely my first thought . 
  particularly the second movement . 
  better than clapping after tuning though , right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ eh ... ^ ^ ^ probably ^ ^ ^ not . 
  not a trumpetist , but my first thought for trumpet would probably have been the opening to mahler 's 5th . 
  i 've seen an arrangement for concert band which is more of a clarinet concerto . 
  but yeah , it 's always seemed weird to me that the piece is associated so much with clarinet . 
  my first thought for timpani would be the introduction to also sprach zarathustra . 
  i definitely found it more difficult and clumsier on windows ( i 'm running 8.1 ) than it was on os x. 
  forget how , but i definitely managed to get it working eventually . 
  you putting the file in the right place ? 
  ( also pretty sure i had to restart . ), 
  could you explain this one ? 
  i think you guys need to have something specifically in the css to support spoiler tags . 
  it does n't work correctly at the moment . 
  edit : [ this should help ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/csshelp/comments/1xdapp/looking_for_a_spoiler_tag_css_code_for/ ) . 
  works in firefox private mode ? 
  that seems ... really poorly thought out . 
  yeah i think chuck has done perhaps the best of any show i 've seen post the main characters getting together . 
  i 've heard people say castle did it well , and i do n't necessarily disagree , but for reasons unrelated to the relationship stuff i got bored and quit about 5 episodes into the fifth season . 
  but this show . 
  this was just amazing . 
  if anything i felt it got so much * better * after they were together . 
  yeah i get it . 
  i just did n't know what he meant by hm and m. 
  i 've added spoiler tags to the subreddit 's css , and modified the sidebar to include instructions . 
  ah there we go . 
  i knew there had to be one somewhere . 
  cheers . 
   kudos btw for the self-control not to watch chuck bro , that 's a whole new level i 'll never reach, 
  yeah , no kidding . 
  i have a terrible habit of binge-watching shows , but chuck may be the worst there 's been so far . 
  i started the whole thing for the first time on the 6th of september , and i 'm here now , having finished it . 
  i did n't sleep at all last night , because i just had to finish season 5 . 
  it was just ... i really do n't have words for it . 
  this is easily the most emotional i 've ever gotten over a fictional world . 
  the next contender was probably when i was 12 reading the cirque du freak saga . 
  oh man , i know * exactly * how you feel ( or rather , felt ) . 
  i just finished it myself . 
  unfortunately , i was trying to look up one particular detail relating to the show , and accidentally had a large portion of the ending spoiled to me mid way through season 3 . 
  so every happy moment , especially during season 5 , felt incredibly bitter-sweet to me , because i knew where it was going . 
  the whole thing was such an enormous emotional rollercoaster . 
  now that it 's over i feel almost ... lost . 
  i do n't really know how to feel about it . 
  unfortunately i do n't think there 's a way to fix the shortcut keys problem on windows . 
  os x has a really cool layout called `` dvorak-qwerty \u2318 '' , which switches to qwerty when the command key is held down ( most shortcuts use command rather than control , e.g. 
  copy is cmd-c ) . 
  but yeah , there 's definitely nothing wrong with the dvorak simplified keyboard layout . 
  i probably use it 99 % of the time . 
  simple and powerful . 
  edit : i 've just done a quick bit of research . 
  [ this ] ( https://code.google.com/p/dvorak-qwerty/ ) may be useful to you if you want to get a similar thing on windows .
