  i have * no * idea how well it will work , though , and it 'll probably be just as hard to get working as the previous problem . 
  nsfl is more like it .

  i think your source indicates that you are wrong , and / u/coca _ was right . 
  i just finished the show for the first time yesterday . 
  i 'm definitely game to rewatch it all , there were some points i wanted clarification on , and i 'm sure i missed some finer details entirely . 
  maybe i just want to walk into the elevator and then get out again immediately . 
  you said, 
   if you get into an elevator and ask people `` are you going up or down ? '' . 
  they can answer `` yes '', 
  implying that if you see someone get into an elevator you immediately know that their answer to the question `` are you going up or down ? '', 
  is `` yes '' . 
  of course , in practice this is true , but i provided an example of a situation where it would , in fact , be `` no '' . 
  not that it really matters , it 's a dumb bit of pedantry for a cheap ~ ~ laugh ~ ~ briefly exhaling slightly more air than normal , anyway . 
  i 'm surprised no one has said [ appassionata ] ( http://youtu.be/4c3tir2bbo0 ) yet . 
  that 's probably my pick . 
  also up there are the moonlight and path\u00e9tique sonatas . 
  the song definitely had a bunch of moments that musically were reminiscent of defying gravity . 
  it does n't matter . 
  one of wikipedia 's core pillars is [ wp : nor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wp:nor ) , which states that you ** must not ** include information that is based on your own personal research into the matter . 
  if you want to include something in wikipedia , * especially * if it contradicts something published elsewhere , you need to find some reliable published source to back it up . 
  it 's the rule that keeps wikipedia reliable , because it prevents people from making up stuff for themselves and adding it to articles as they like . 
  very closely related is [ wp : v ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wp:v ) , which talks about how the verifiability of a statement trumps whether or not it is true . 
   i did not encounter any indication that there was a vote of any kind about a protest against sopa or what form that protest would take, 
  what the fuck are you on about ? 
  they had a * huge * debate about it that was very widely advertised . 
  you can read the debate [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:sopa_initiative/action ) . 
  it was by far the biggest community involvement the site has ever had . 
  if you did n't participate in that conversation , that 's your fault . 
  regarding ( 2 ) , you will be graded exactly the same as if you were doing the subject . 
  it is for this reason that the ibo ** strongly ** recommends you do your ee in a subject that you are studying . 
  no , that 's how i read it . 
  in fact , before reading the article and realising her * name * was `` amanda pays '' , i spent a couple of minutes trying to figure it out and could n't . 
   lovely , who knew i worked for prostitutes ? 
  i did n't, 
  uhh , you may want to look up that word . 
  first of all , none of its definitions involve working * for * prostitutes , but more importantly , its most common usage has nothing to do with prostitutes at all . 
  effiminate man is most definitely the definition that is most widely used , and is what / u/brlito probably meant . 
  was n't me , by the way . 
  you might want to check who 's actually saying what when replying , rather than making assumptions . 
  i do n't have any real stake in the argument , i just wanted to clarify some words . 
  i answered maths , because that 's definitely the type of course that i 've had the most anxiety over . 
  but of the subjects given there , it 's the * only * one i 've done any of . 
  perhaps an argument could be made that some of them have been science , but for the most part it 's been maths , engineering , and it . 
  seems as though for most people , they 're going to have only experience with a limited number of areas , so without knowing what degree someone is doing , the results will be relatively meaningless . 
  my answer is `` it depends on the style of the game '' .

  ditto here . 
  the us and i think much of western europe use a weird system . 
  the first of the season is the relevant solstice/equinox . 
  makes no sense to have the season * start * with the day that is basically the most representative example of that season , but that 's how they do it over there . 
  there 's a tool available on windows called katmouse that provides os x-like scrolling on background windows . 
  i ca n't speak for other countries , up they definitely do n't take 3 days here in aus . 
  it 's just as fast as if i had put my card in and entered a pin , only without needing to actually enter the pin . 
  hmm fair enough . 
  i 'm with suncorp and it 's never taken more than a few minutes/couple of hours . 
  lots and lots of music . 
  also filmmaking . 
  the 48 hour film project and other local film competitions . 
  in australia the pm , like any minister , must be chosen from either the senate of the house of representatives . 
  by convention , it 's usually from the reps , but not always . 
  ( i.e. , unlike what happens in canada , according to / u/werno , in australia it ca n't be any person off the street . ), 
  the example you mentioned , he actually became pm briefly while in the senate ( the former pm resigned , i think ) , before moving to the reps in the next election . 
  there was one not far down the road from where i grew up in australia . 
  [ it was mostly just a simple chain-linked fence .

  she used it that one time when there was a cop with a fake badge . 
  not if you allow yourself to be hurt because of it . 
  maybe . 
  you 're absolutely right , they 're out of order . 
  for reference , [ here 's the drawing that iroh drew in the dirt when teaching zuko about lightning bending ] ( http://imgur.com/epkj1gz ) . 
  edit : i just went ahead and edited the current background to have the correct order , starting with air . 
  here it is :, 
  mods , feel free to update the background with this . 
  the wink really did it for me . 
  [ hmm ... not sure i 'd want to be tending the garden to this , either ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqsulr9fymg ), 
  i 've got a couple that i would n't mind having good quality versions of one or both of .

  and,

  [ here 's the nightmare ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfvcnlsco4o ) as a youtube video , audio taken from sibelius 5 . 
  as you can see , it 's pretty terrible with the audio , especially at the end with the molto dims . 
  have n't got the film music one online yet . 
  then award a delta . 
  read it in a clockwise direction , not like words on a page . 
  it 's air , water , earth , fire . 
  haha unfortunately not . 
  i came across it elsewhere and thought it would be good here . 
  it actually works in most of the world on gsm networks . 
  it 'll redirect to 000 in australia , or 911 in the usa .
