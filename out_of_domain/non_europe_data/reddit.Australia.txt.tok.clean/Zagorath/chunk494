  hmm ... good point . 
  i suppose they probably just hand waved that aspect of it . 
  i suppose there could be a number of potential explanations for it , if you 're willing to suspend a little disbelief . 
  there have been a number of stories on here already that have been about non d&d stories . 
  it 's perfectly acceptable . 
  ( one of my favourites is [ this star wars rpg one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/217h1w/star_wars_tabletop_the_mechanic/ ) ) . 
  i do n't know the 4 monks story you mention . 
  if it has n't already been submitted here , maybe you should submit it yourself !, 
  i know i 'm always interested in more content to this relatively quiet subreddit . 
  i 'm confused as to what the comment is doing here . 
  what does `` d o '' have to do with the gravitational constant ? 
  dumbest name that subreddit has . 
  as if the `` true '' australia is one which ignores politics entirely . 
  i 'd be in favour of a subreddit like / r/ausnopol -- i.e. , one with an accurate name -- or / r/trueaustralia if it was just attempting to remove the circlejerk without banning an entire major part of topical discourse . 
  ah right ... 
  that explains it , thanks . 
  all two of the planes , or two of the people ? 
  i still wonder why special d10s needed to be made . 
  why not just use d20 % 10 ? 
  they * are * polyhedrons . 
  what they 're not is platonic solids or * regular * polyhedrons . 
  let me preface this by saying that i am 100 % on the side of the cyclists in these sorts of discussion . 
  but this is * not * victim blaming . 
  that phrase gets used * far * too much in places where it 's not applicable . 
  to take the phrase back to its usual context , it is n't victim blaming to suggest that women be careful of how much they drink when around men they do n't know . 
  whenever someone suggests this , people inevitably come along and call it victim blaming . 
  but recommending precaution is ** not ** victim blaming . 
  victim blaming would be saying the woman deserved it for being careless , or in the current context , that the cyclist deserves to get run over for taking the lane . 
  this is how the westminster system * officially * works , but everything i 've seen about it from watching uk , canadian , and australian politics makes it seem that people tend to vote more for the party and/or the party leader , rather than actually focusing on their local mp . 
  so in practice , though not on paper , people do vote for the pm . 
  leadership changes are the obvious exception to this . 
  yeah it may have been your post that i found it from . 
  it 's well up there with my favourites already . 
  i think the only ones i liked more are the medusa , the mechanic , and `` an evil campaign gone ... good '' . 
  the h1 is the mic i 've been looking at getting . 
  from what i 've seen its audio quality seems pretty damn decent , and its price is almost scarily low . 
  being able to double as a usb mic recording straight into the computer ( or use for skype etc. ), 
  is an extra bonus . 
  i 've seen them go for around $ 100 online , i think, 
  * [ the mechanic ] ( https://i.imgur.com/mfjs5t8.jpg ) ( it 's long , but worth it ), 
  thanks !, 
  you should submit it as a post in the subreddit , so that more people can see it . 
  i should probably warn you that i personally stopped reading it near the end of the second film ( which is where they were up to at the time ) . 
  i got bored with it once i had to wait between episodes . 
  might also be worth knowing about the remindme bot . 
  just type, 
  5 days `` and a message '', 
  ( or however many days/hours , up to one year ) , and it 'll automatically remind you when the time comes . 
  and since you 're interested , here 's [ dm of the rings ] ( http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612 ) , the same concept , but with lord of the rings rather than star wars . 
  edit : oh yeah , the bot recommends you put the remindme as the last thing in your comment , because otherwise you get weird situations like the one below . 
  ( reminding me in a year and five days ? 
  where the hell did that come from ? ), 
  the mic you mentioned in your op is probably the blue yeti . 
  it 's primarily a voice mic , really popular with youtubers etc. 
  who want to talk into it . 
  even so , it 's a very good microphone , and can be found at a very good price if you look around . 
  it 'll do just fine for singing -- though a pop filter would be a very good idea . 
  [ you can see some good demonstrations on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blue+yeti+singing&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch ) . 
   there is a specification, 
  that 's / u/iamdelf 's point . 
  he 's saying in order to keep the thing sharp while improving safety , you replace the knife with scissors . 
  you * do n't * necessarily have the same specification . 
  as an aussie ( most people of asian descent here are from eastern asia -- china , vietnam , etc. ), 
  it seems weird hearing indians referred to as `` eastern '' . 
  not a criticism or anything , just an observation that interested me . 
  as a nexus 4 user myself . 
  just fuck you and people like you . 
  people who buy iphones do so for reasons that ca n't be summarised on these quaint little comparison sheets . 
  they prefer the way the experience works . 
  you certainly ca n't deny that there are some things apple does better , although they do n't get there first . 
  one extremely minor example : the interface you get [ in ios 7 when you swipe up from the bottom ] ( http://cdn.iphonehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/control-center.jpg ) looks * much * more useful and convenient to me than what you get when [ swiping with two fingers down from the top in android ] ( http://theetrain.ca/tech/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-18-17.44.44.png ) ( due to the sliders for brightness and volume , and although i 've not used it , presumably the wifi button toggles wifi on and off when you press it , instead of needing to long press like you do on android ) . 
  as for the payments thing , sure you could do it on * some * android devices at * some * locations if you were with * some * ( extremely limited selection of ) banks . 
  what apple is doing with apple pay will be much more successful and useful because they 're working to get this to the point that it 's readily usable by thousands of people on a daily basis , instead of some minor convenience a handful of people can use occasionally . 
  that said , over here we 've got paywave/paypass on most cards and at most major stores , so for most normal purchases there 's no need for a pin ( or , god forbid , a signature ) anyway ; phone payment would be less of an advantage here . 
  i love my nexus 4 , and my next phone will probably be the 6th or 7th generation nexus device , or some other relatively clean android experience ( because fuck things like samsung 's changes to android ) , but i absolutely hate it when people like you act all superior because there were some features that android had before ios . 
  / u/rcgy accidentally replied to you in the wrong location . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/composer/comments/2gc2wb/discussion_is_there_a_subreddit_for_performers_to/ckn6rgw ) is their reply . 
  [ manfred von richthofen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manfred_von_richthofen ) ( misspelled in the op , probably deliberately ) is better known as `` the red baron '' , an ace fighter pilot who fought for germany in world war i. 
  if it makes a difference , this comic is the [ 28th most-referenced comic from xkcd ] ( http://xkcdref.info/statistics/ ) . 
  it 's been referenced 198 times , but the mean is only 24 times . 
  if you do make one for android , i 'd be interested in hearing about it . 
  i 've been similarly unhappy with what 's available so far , and i rather like the look of your app . 
  i was gon na make one of my own over christmas , and i 've already made a really basic '' [ dice ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/kufl5vp7u3nighs/dice.zip?dl=0 ) '' class , if you want to use it . 
  which is * exactly * the commenter 's point . 
  making a knife out of steel , plastic , or ceramic , it 's still a knife . 
  but change it into scissors , and suddenly it 's completely different ; much safer . 
  it 's currently 10:00 pm in australia ( well , on the east coast . 
  9:30 central , 8:00 in wa ) , 12:00 pm in the uk ( or 1:00 pm if they 're on daylight saving time at the moment , i dunno , we do n't use that shit where i am ) . 
  dunno which results in more traffic for reddit , but i can tell you as an aussie , i certainly did n't upvote this . 
  it 's very counter-intuitive , but 12:00 pm is in fact noon . 
  that 's a different user ... 
  ah thought you might be . 
  ( so it was 1 at the time of my last comment . ), 
  the user that brought up the scissors analogy is the user we were discussing here . 
  you replied as if we were still discussing / u/pipocaquemada 's comment . 
  yeah , it 's been an hour since that comment , and dst is in effect . 
  ah , right . 
  i think you 're misinterpreting that part of the comment , then . 
  his only point there was that they 're made of different things . 
  their functionality is identical .
