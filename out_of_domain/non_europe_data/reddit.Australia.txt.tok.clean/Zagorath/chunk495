  arguably that is n't necessarily * true * ( a plastic knife might be hard to cut a steak with ) , but i think that was the point he was trying to make . 
  a 10 % margin is a significant victory in australian politics , too . 
  our turnout averages around the 95 % turnout mark . 
  maybe they 're even more of an arsehole when drunk or hyper from sugar ? 
  i think it 's just a reference to their username . 
  not a very clever one , mind you , but i think that 's what they were going for . 
   one party has way lower turnout compared to the other, 
  ah yeah , that 's a good point . 
  i was kinda implicitly assuming that with lower voter turnout in the us , there would be the same ratio of no-votes as from the overall population . 
  yeah i know . 
  i started out with the drunk thing , and then realised i needed something to cover the situation where they ordered juice or soft drink , so i threw in hyper . 
  [ there 's one thing i ca n't stand about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj882qyzr-m ) . 
  yes ... sorta . 
  it 's black and white in the sense that you might call [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/mb0hlbl ) a black and white image . 
  strictly speaking , it 's not really black and white , it 's greyscale . 
  true black and white is literally only black ( # 000000 in hex rgb ) and white ( #ffffff ) , with nothing in between . 
  yeah neither do i. i only noticed it this time because i was scrolling back up to it to press the [ - ] icon to close the section . 
  nah , he likes it when his phone feels like his carpets . 
  you should get a podcatcher !, 
  ( like grey mentions early in the video . ), 
  based on my calculations , if someone started listening to it right when it was posted and was listening at 3.0 x ( which is the maximum my podcatcher allows -- and i do listen to a few podcasts at that speed , though not this one ) , they would have finished almost exactly as you posted your comment . 
  so not * that * far out of the realm of possibility . 
  more than anything else , skipping the ads will help improve google 's algorithm . 
  it might make an infinitesimal negative impact on grey 's income in the short run , but in the long run it could actually help him and many other youtubers make slightly * more * than they currently do . 
  do n't feel guilty about skipping ads that do n't interest you !, 
  ( personally , i especially enjoy watching the full ad when the ad is clearly tailored for youtube , by designing it to really grab your attention in the first 5 seconds . 
  and i skip the fuck out of trailers where the first 5 seconds is logos ... ), 
  i 've only ever used podcatchers on ios and android , so i ca n't attest to how good these are , but from [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_podcatchers ) , i found a few that might be worth looking at . 
  these are the ones on both windows and os x that were significant enough to have their own wikipedia pages :, 
  * [ clementine ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clementine_ ( software \\ ) ), 
  * [ juice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/juice_ ( aggregator \\ ) ), 
  female composers , too . 
  lovely piece of music , though . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  oh man i 'm just glad i 'm not the only one who does this . 
  often i end up deleting the comment in its entirety when i get back to it ... 
  i could be wrong , but is n't it the same company that 's * huge * in parts of europe ? 
  would n't that make it much easier to travel with ? 
  ( i dunno , because where i am there 's no company with the name t-mobile at all . ), 
  email itself does n't include read/delivered notifications . 
  some clients will attach requests for the receiving client to respond when read , but this can be disabled , and is n't even supported universally . 
  the other two definitely work . 
  in my opinion the nexus line is the absolute best experience available on android . 
  samsung and many other companies add on all this crapware that you do n't need or want and will never use , and make the general experience worse than google 's flavour of android . 
  add to that the fact that the nexus phones are generally very good specs at very reasonable prices , and it 's a no-brainer to me in most circumstances . 
  ( nexus 4 user here . ), 
  i dropped my old touch from chest height onto tiled floors many times . 
  the metallic back/sides were dented , but never once did the screen have any issues . 
  yeah i have to say , the way the dm reacted to it ( at least from what we can read in this post ) was * really * poor . 
  that was some absolutely ingenious roleplaying from the bard . 
  still , at least he did n't just say `` no , you ca n't seduce her '' . 
  oh , you 're thinking of something different . 
  read notifications are when the * receiver * sends a little automated message to the * sender * once they have * opened * the email . 
  it 's not quite the same thing . 
  one is telling you the message successfully arrived at their end , the other is telling you that they actually looked at it . 
  why you would want the first one is beyond me , but my mum has it on her phone and refuses to let me turn it off , so obviously people like it . 
  it 's easy to see why some people like the latter , though again i 'm personally not a fan of it . 
  it annoys me that systems like facebook have this without letting you turn it off . 
  at least with email you can always do that . 
  ( i refuse to use whatsapp for unrelated reasons , so i do n't know if it has the option to turn it off or not . ), 
  i think the fact that she 's the lord 's daughter was important . 
  i was thinking korra should 've been made old , but that works even better . 
  i do n't know which is uk and which is us english ( from aus , here ) . 
  personally , i was taught to always put commas and full stops inside quotations , while question and exclamation marks go inside when part of the quote , outside otherwise . 
  fuck that shit . 
  that 's the stupidest fucking rule in written english . 
  if the comma does n't make sense as part of the quoted text , i 'm going to put it outside the fucking quote , because * that makes more sense * . 
  sorry , i have strong feelings about this stuff , apparently ... 
  wait what ? 
  in some parts of the us the * only * way to vote is by mail ? 
   sorry , i do n't know how to do links on reddit , but it was an easy google search, 
  worst , case scenario , you can always just copy and paste the links :, 
  but otherwise , the syntax is n't too difficult :, 
  [ text goes here ] ( link goes here ), 
  the link must include the http or https at the beginning to be recognised . 
  [ google search `` stuff '' ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=stuff ), 
  appears :, 
  [ google search `` stuff '' ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=stuff ), 
  hope this helps !, 
  i was confused until i re-read my comment . 
  gave me a good chuckle . 
  there are a bunch of really handy threads that have come up in this subreddit in the past that you might like to check out . 
  one recent one is [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/2dulzl/have_a_ps2_but_only_3_games_what_should_i_get/ ) . 
  my personal recommendations would be ** [ dark cloud ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dark_cloud ) ** :, 
   i have n't played the sequel , but the original game was one of my absolute favourites growing up . 
  it seems that not many people know about it , though . 
  it did n't get as much attention as some other games like final fantasy , kingdom hearts , or jak and daxter . 
   it 's kind of difficult to explain , but basically there 's some really great dungeoneering with a variety of different characters , each with their own unique style . 
  there 's also an outside world that the player has to rebuild , trying to keep all the villagers happy with how he 's arranged the towns . 
   it 's got some really cool mechanics , like needing to keep water in dungeons , a bunch of different effects like poisoning and stickiness ( slows you down ) . 
  the rpg element comes largely from weapons . 
  each weapon can be upgraded and improved in a variety of different ways . 
  but be careful , because they can break if you use them too much without repairing -- leaving the weapon completely destroyed . 
   the setting and story is also really well made and engaging . 
   really great fun , and incredibly unique . 
  i highly recommend . 
   and perhaps a niche interest , but the music is absolutely divine . 
  probably the only game that i 've actually downloaded the whole soundtrack to and listen to it regularly . 
  [ and ** spyro ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spyro_ ( series \\ ) ) :, 
   i loved the spyro series growing up .
