  at least the first 3 games are some of the best 3d platformers out there , with a great set of characters and enjoyable mechanics . 
   i had the most experience with spyro 2 : gateway to glimmer , but all 3 of the original three games are great . 
   unfortunately , the later games were made by a different developer , and are nowhere near as good . 
  ** star wars : battlefront ii ** is a great shooter , and i remember really enjoying ** summoner ** at the time , though i have a feeling it might have aged badly ( i 've not played it since i was really young , only briefly read a couple of things about it . 
  honestly it sounds like a terrible idea to me . 
  what * advantages * does it have over being able to walk into a polling place , get your name ticked off , marking some paper , and putting that into the box ? 
  with the additional * option * of mailing it in if you ca n't make it on the day for whatever reason . 
  one only needs to look at the comment i replied to to see a problem with the system . 
  what if you 're homeless and do n't have access to a mailbox ? 
  should you therefore just not be entitled to vote ? 
  [  ] ( http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwmqjzymac1r5gvg1o1_250.gif ), 
  the font i 'm seeing ( chrome on windows ) shows exactly zero difference until i click `` source '' . 
  while we 're at it , brackets , square brackets , and braces ( aka curly brackets ) , respectively :, 
  gon na be honest , the biggest thing this raised to me is how damn terrible the whole voting system is in the us . 
  elections where i am are always on a saturday ( so most people do n't have work ) , ballots are done by marking in pencil on paper and the voter placing the ballot in a box that remains sealed until it 's counted . 
  counting is done under rigorous scrutiny . 
  everyone who 's registered has the right to vote -- in federal elections and most states you do n't even need any id . 
  it 's really not difficult to set up , except perhaps moving it from tuesday to saturday , although even that 's only difficult because of tradition . 
  still , given the conditions you have to work with , i guess requiring mail votes is a pretty decent workaround . 
  i do n't know when we started talking about programming , but i for one never call brackets parentheses . 
  it 's such an ugly-sounding word to me , and twice as long as brackets . 
  just curious , you from the uk ? 
  you use `` full stop '' , which i know americans and ( i 'm pretty sure ) canadians do n't use , yet you use `` parentheses '' , which i 've never heard an aussie or kiwi use , to my knowledge . 
  thankfully in this case , it looks like the dm * did * allow it , although he was rather unjustly angry about it . 
  i never thought of it as being related to programming in any way , but it really makes sense . 
  it can lead to some awkward situations , though :, 
   i replied `` we do have some cheese . '' . 
  i feel like i need to end the quote and the parent sentence , but it looks awkward , so i 'll sometimes put the full stop inside the quote , sometimes outside , and sometimes do both . 
  none of them really satisfy me . 
  queensland , australia . 
  thankfully , the australian electoral commission is an independent body that overseas all things federal election , and it does a really good job of preventing things like that . 
  i could be wrong , but from what i 've seen , the us does n't have a federal body that has quite the same amount of power to keep federal elections fair and open , which is perhaps rather unfortunate . 
  there was some big talk recently when the latest election in my state ( a by-election in my electorate ) was the first after having introduced a requirement for id to be shown in state elections . 
  people were afraid that this might lead to disenfranchisement of some people . 
  thankfully the way it was done mostly prevented this , as what they would accept for id was extremely broad ( anything from passports/driver 's licences , to bank/phone statements , and they even mailed out specific id for this purpose to registered . 
  pretty sure it 's you that 's done something with the fonts there . 
  that 's definitely not how chrome/windows looks by default . 
  ( with the blue on dark grey , as well as the thick block-y font . ), 
  [ here 's what it looks like for me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8k0vonz.png ) . 
  your point ? 
  without your country information , that 's kinda meaningless here . 
  i know that this is how it 's typically done in america , and i 'm guessing / u/mech _ elf is from the uk , which it seems may use the words in the same way as the us . 
  but my experience has been that people in australia ( call these brackets ) [ and these square brackets ] . 
  i dunno frigo , but it sure sounds like one . 
  there 's actually a brand new subreddit just for this kind of thing !, 
  head over to / r/performancerequests and submit this !, 
  since you say you ca n't play with both hands , another option would be to play with one hand , record it , play it back with headphones while playing the * other * hand , record that , then listen to the result of the two together . 
  it 's also well worth ` grabbing ' a copy of sibelius . 
  a piece like this would take half an hour to notate in it , and its playback is more than adequate to be able to `` hear what it sounds like '' . 
  if you do n't get any other takers , i 'll try and give this a go later today or next weekend , but i may not get time . 
  edit :, 
  [ in the meantime , here 's what i got by exporting it from sibelius ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/3clgv6eijd92c3e/blah%20by%20balderslash.mp3?dl=0 ) . 
  turned out because of all the repetition in the left hand and how simple the right hand was , it was a lot quicker to write it than i initially thought . 
  huh ... 
  your k-marts in america must be completely unrelated to ours in australia . 
  do n't get much food in them here , except possibly a few snacks at the checkout counter . 
  they 're mainly competition for stores like target . 
  got ta be honest , the current top posts on / r/eyebleach really are n't helping me . 
  the first second or so of that dog gif just look creepy bordering on disturbing ( and extremely ugly ) , and the pit bull puppy being reunited , while the story is awesome , the dog itself is just ugly as fuck . 
  yeah , i feel like the sting is far more well known . 
  as a pianist , i used to play the entertainer * all the time * , and people would always come up to me and call it `` the sting '' , or `` that song from the sting '' , or words to that effect . 
  regarding butch cassidy , welcome to the [ baader meinhoff phenomenon ] ( http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/ ) . 
  i definitely think butch cassidy is the far superior film . 
  it could be more a function of my age when i watched them ( saw the sting at around age 12-14 , but butch cassidy at 17 or 18 ) , but i really did n't enjoy the sting very much , while i thought butch cassidy was an absolutely incredible piece of cinema . 
  i definitely thought this . 
  hated the social network . 
  it felt to me like a rip off of what 's trendy at the time , while vaguely trying to recreate the awesomeness that was pirates of silicon valley , and utterly failing . 
  now i just want to know if the time ever came , and what it was . 
  how do you hold a baseball bat ? 
  it would be * extremely * unusual for you to bat opposite hands in cricket and baseball . 
  ( on the other hand , batting one hand , bowling the other , is extremely common . ), 
  i should really get back in to castle . 
  i absolutely loved it seasons 1-4 , but got bored not long after the start of season 5 and quit watching it . 
  it was n't the romance , i actually think castle ( much like chuck did ) handled the end of the will-they-won ` t-they and the start of a real relationship * really * well . 
  the australian company was named after the american company , but has no official relation . 
  the new zealand woolies is the same as the australian one . 
  there 's one in south africa also named after the us one , but is unrelated to both the australian and the us stores . 
  the one in the uk was directly related to the us store . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woolworth ) . 
  yeah these are great !, 
  i used one just yesterday ( or two days ago , i guess , since it 's technically monday now ... ) when i was looking for something that i do n't buy very frequently in a store that i 've not been to before . 
  unfortunately although they are much better than the op , they 're still not completely comprehensive , and i know i 've run into situations in the past where they have n't had what i 'm looking for in the list . 
  honestly , i tend to prefer to shop at woolies just because i fucking hate coles ' ads and do n't want to give that any patronage . 
  [ shit like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc1mr6dixsq ) and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d0vw4axh1o ) . 
  it 's just ... urgh . 
  fuck you . 
  actually , yes , there is a rule . 
  it relies on the idea of the [ gruen transfer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gruen_transfer ) ( also the name of [ a great tv show about advertising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_gruen_transfer ) ) . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , it really amazes me how ignorant some americans can be regarding british and australian terminology sometimes . 
  i mean , the reverse is probably true in some cases , but to a * much * lesser degree . 
  would said site also include a group of people who enjoy plundering and sailing in ships ? 
  but on a serious note , honestly , that 's a pretty dumb rule for a subreddit like this to have . 
  i can perhaps see the argument for not * linking * to the content , but not discussing it ? 
  fuck that rule . 
  oh right . 
  that makes so much more sense . 
  i thought you got some really crazy coincidence where the people who took your survey were much more likely to be born 30-12 than on 01-01 , for some reason . 
   i 'm two episodes from the end, 
  of your first watch-through ? 
  i 'm gon na guess that since it 's been 12 hours now you 've probably finished it .
