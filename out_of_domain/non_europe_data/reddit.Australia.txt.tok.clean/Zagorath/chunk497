  either way , i 'm curious , did you have the ending spoiled to you by anything before you got there ? 
  what did you think of it ? 
  you should join [ chucktober ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/2garfg/chucktober/ ) !, 
  the plan is to , throughout the course of october , watch the whole of chuck . 
  at 91 episodes in 31 days , that 's only about 3 episodes per day . 
  a good opportunity to do a rewatch with some other people . 
  what makes this scene even better is that it aired about a week * before * the premier of game of thrones . 
  timed to perfection . 
  what ? 
  7up is owned by pepsi ... 
  it 's their competitor to sprite in the lemonade market . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.pepsico.eu/brands/ ) ( see the scrolling logos at the bottom ) . 
  i did a proper blind test with my mum ( who always swore she could tell the difference , though we did n't believe her ) . 
  single . 
  one * . 
  correct . 
  something like 8 different glasses . 
  that said , the only one that 's surprising there is the very first one . 
  after that , it 's easy to compare and notice the small differences . 
  what 's less easy is to notice the difference without a reference point . 
  you can always walk into a room full of mac users ( any universities near you ? ), 
  and use it to mess with people who have n't set it to require pairing . 
  just read [ the wikipedia lead on it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_up ) . 
  in the us it 's owned by dr pepper , everywhere else it 's run by pepsi . 
  never even heard of sierra mist . 
  i must say it seems odd . 
  does the us 7 up use the same logo as the international one ? 
  the fact that it has the red circle matches so well with pepsi 's korean-flag-esque red and blue circle . 
  i 'm pretty sure mine was about 100 bpm . 
  i just left it at whatever sibelius set as the default . 
  160 is quite a fast tempo really . 
  yeah , same logo . 
  it fits really well with the pepsi one , i always thought that was deliberate . 
  kinda disappointing to find out that it 's not . 
  i 've only ever seen this guy in gifs/videos like the one in op . 
  the other one i remember is the military guy and the question was something about wives , and they 're both like `` nope '' . 
  does the host have any other face ? 
  because i 've only ever really seen him make one type of face . 
  haha nah mate , no worries . 
  i 'm glad i know that it 's not an actual deliberate design choice . 
  would be weird going around thinking it was when it is n't ... 
  yeah that 's the one .

  leftie batter . 
  i think the important difference is that the ice-bucket challenge was a specific call-to-action . 
  donate $ 5 to charity and make a funny video , or donate $ 100 to charity . 
  what * specifically * is heforshe trying to accomplish ? 
  if there is n't a specific thing people are trying to do with it , something actionable , then while it may raise awareness in general , it wo n't really accomplish very much . 
  honestly i think the biggest conclusion you can make about that is how long videos of speeches are less popular than a couple of pictures . 
  but if shrek is love , does n't that make sun = 0 ? 
   you just put up with shit service, 
  definitely has not been my general experience . 
  i could count on one hand the number of times i 've had restaurant service that i would consider bad , having lived my whole life in countries where tipping is not the norm . 
  i think part of the problem is that what people expect as `` good service '' in australia ( and most of europe and asia , from my experience ) is very different from what people expect as `` good service '' in the us ( basing this only off of comments in this thread and others like it ) . 
  [ this commenter has a good explanation of it ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2h36at/what_social_norm_do_you_not_agree_with/ckp0yvh ) . 
  personally , i would absolutely hate to have service like that . 
  i generally expect the waiter to come over and ask for drinks orders not long after i 've sat down , and then a few minutes later come asking for meal orders . 
  after that , i do n't want to be interrupted until my meal is done . 
  i 'll call for them if i want anything else . 
  asking if i 'd like another drink once the previous one is empty is nice , too , * especially * if it 's a few minutes after i 've finished the previous drink , and not immediately . 
  trying to act overly friendly would just come across as false and offputting to me . 
  the aussie that you know probably came from a similar background , and would generally want similar service , which is why that 's what she gave . 
  people in the us just expect something really bizarre compared to that . 
  i came across your reply here shortly after i finished replying to another one of your comments , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2h36at/what_social_norm_do_you_not_agree_with/ckp7zng?context=1 ) . 
  that should help put things in perspective a little . 
  actually that 's a different user . 
  while one might be able to infer from the comment that they 're from the same country as the one they replied to , it 's definitely not certain . 
  triathlon master race ? 
   i 'm an ass, 
  it 's sites like this that make me want a damn * blacklist * - based adblock programme that actually works . 
  i recently uninstalled adblock because it 's just too much work to turn it off on nearly every site i visit , because of the damn whitelist-based system . 
  i lost interest when i clicked on it and saw that it was one page per woman . 
  nope . 
  fuck that . 
  if they do n't also comment in the relevant srd thread , surely you would n't even know that they were voting and commenting in the linked thread , would you ? 
   anywhere where the price is so low from slave labour, 
  so , works for china , but not korea , then ? 
  you do n't think it 's bizarre because * that 's what you 're used to * . 
  for most people , it seems false at best , and creepy at worst . 
  it may not be intended that way , but that 's how it seems . 
  and sure , i 'll tip . 
  i 'm not going to be tipping 20 % in most cases , because that 's just stupid ( especially if , as implied elsewhere in the thread , you 're paying tax * on top of * that . 
  why the fuck ca n't you just put the fucking price i have to pay in the fucking menu ) , but i 'll tip whatever seems reasonable . 
  it 's not their fault they have to basically whore themselves out , it 's a shitty system , so i 'm not going to punish them for it . 
  for a country that prides itself on being the land of the free , it 's pretty fucked that you guys ca n't drink alcohol until 3 years after you 're an adult . 
  slightly related , i wanted to be a paleontologist . 
  i was just obsessed with dinosaurs . 
  had books and books full of stuff , had the full [ walking with dinosaurs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walking_with_dinosaurs ) on tape , etc. 
  heck , i was a fucking 6 year old that knew the word `` paleontologist '' . 
  i kinda miss that , but then i could n't imagine doing physical work on dig sites . 
  my dad ( also a teacher ) has a saying . 
   follow your dreams ; welcome to teaching . 
  not the most inspiring words , but very often accurate . 
  as someone who just started watching the show a few days ago ( the originals -- i saw a few of them as a kid on the abc , but do n't really remember much ) , i do n't know what it 's like today , but what i 've been watching has been one of those `` it 's so bad it 's good '' type shows . 
  definitely agree . 
  personally i just have to avoid it during the off season , though , because i have zero interest in most of the fanart stuff . 
  korrassami shippers get on my nerves , too . 
  is there a map i can see online that shows where this city is ? 
  i used to play for ages but i do n't remember any elven city on the edge of the map . 
  yeah i agree .
