  i do n't use the [ pinky shelf ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2h0r14/how_much_youll_have_to_stretch_your_thumb_to_use/ckoc5ut ) method , but even so , on my nexus 4 ( which i believe is the same size as the iphone 6 ) i can reach about 3/4 the height on the left edge , and 1/2 the height on the right edge without stretching , and the full height on the left and 3/4s the height on the right with a fairly comfortable stretch . 
  edit : switching quickly into the pinky shelf grip makes it really easy to reach the bottom right corner of the screen , which is uncomfortable otherwise . 
  far more likely , in my opinion , is that their concept of `` decent service '' is extremely warped , because of the stuff i mentioned in my comment . 
  i understand a mark in confidence scams , but what 's a mark in a game of poker ? 
  ah , right . 
  makes sense . 
  just curious , what curriculum did you study in high school ? 
  pretty sure australia uses 000 , not 1 . 
  you need to check your syntax . 
  reddit does this stupid thing where any line starting with a number and a full stop is interpreted as an ordered list , and thus will become `` 1 . 
  to fix it , you can go ` 000 \\ . 
  stuff ` :, 
  stuff, 
  as opposed to :, 
  stuff, 
  which is, 
  stuff, 
  people still would n't read them as much as they would look at funny photos . 
  i always loved meeting people who would do that kind of thing . 
  i saw a guy get killed , and then i grabbed his gear and attacked the thing that was attacking him . 
  i ended up getting killed , and the guy ( who by this point had just arrived back at where i was -- we were n't far from lumbridge ) grabbed my stuff and brought it back to me when i respawned . 
  so you 're actually a 20-something 180 cm white woman ? 
  black woman ? 
  yup . 
  he and his brother hank green are really well-known on youtube . 
  originally from the channel vlogbrothers , and more recently they 've both started doing crash course together . 
  john does humanities ( history and literature , so far ) while hank 's done a bunch of sciences ( biology , chemistry , and he 's currently in the middle of psychology ) . 
  til canadians do n't ever get laid . 
  i want the rundown on legend of the five rings . 
  oooo that sounds really cool . 
  would you mind sharing the abstract ? 
  ( or something similar . ), 
  it 's not a roleplaying game , but my friends and i played the [ a game of thrones board game ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_game_of_thrones_ ( board_game \\ ) ) , and it probably took about 10 minutes to explain . 
  for actual roleplaying games , my only experience is with dnd . 
  there is n't a version of dnd you 're going to be able to pick up in 10 minutes , but 4e and 5e are both considerably quicker to get in to than older versions . 
  sorry for opening back up a really old thread , but i 've just seen this comment . 
  what have you got against psionics and phb3 ? 
  i 'm currently playing a shardmind psion and i love it . 
  it has such a unique flavour to it compared to most other power sources , especially because of the power point system . 
  what 's yeronga and uq ? 
  wait there 's a tagpro meetup in brisbane ? 
  if it 's at uq i might pop by . 
   he is referring to the brisbane meet up this friday, 
  yeah that 's what confused me ... 
   australian rules football ( i do n't know anything about this form ), 
  all you need to know is that it 's the greatest sport ever devised . 
  nah , who am i kidding . 
  it 's aerial ping-pong . 
  on a serious note , you can also add gaelic football , both rugby codes , international rules football ( a fusion of gaelic and aussie rules football ) , and all the various forms of `` touch '' to that list . 
  this is the reason i do n't like the word `` football '' as used to describe a single specific sport . 
  in specific contexts , i might use `` footy '' , but generally i prefer to use the specific sport 's name . 
  i like the idea of football being a generic term for all such sports . 
  okay i 'm not him , and i have n't played anything other than dnd , but i reckon a star wars rpg could be good for that , with the right gm . 
  you could even ignore the force and lightsaber aspects if you wanted to . 
  i wonder if there 's a star trek table-top rpg ? 
  because that would be perfect for travel , diplomacy , and exploration ... 
  wow , weird ... 
  i had an idea like this independently last night . 
  kinda a reverse samurai jack . 
  personally , i ( as a guy ) used to be fine with associating with the label feminist , until i came across the type of feminism that is so common on tumblr etc. 
  ( and unfortunately many of my female friends seem to hold to this type of feminism ) . 
  what i absolutely loved about watson 's speech was that she very clearly went in line with the type of feminism that i agree with , talking about how there are negative impacts of the current cultural norms on * everybody * , * including * white cishet males . 
  too many feminists ignore or even worse brush aside these concerns , and that 's why i ca n't label myself as a feminist , but i fully support the movement that watson is backing . 
  i expect nothing less of news.com.au . 
  fucking murdoch press . 
  do we not already have `` digital assistants '' that automatically pay bills ? 
  i know that my phone bill etc. 
  are automatically debited out of my account , i do n't have to do anything about it ... 
  you prefer longs , do you you ? 
   our youth now love luxury . 
  they have bad manners , contempt for authority ; they show disrespect for their elders and love chatter in place of exercise ; they no longer rise when elders enter the room ; they contradict their parents , chatter before company ; gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers . 
  that 's until 17:00 utc , i believe , for those not in the us . 
  no , because they 're talking in tiles , it 's civ . 
  relevant username . 
  i 'm not a pilot or an expert , but i 've been flying regularly since i was 10 , and there 's no way you 'd see buildings looking that large at cruising altitude . 
  what exactly does that one say ? 
  looks like d d6 me, 
  yeah , i found out that one of the leads lost their memories at some point around the middle of season 3 . 
  i did n't know * which * of them it was , and did n't know whether or not they 'd get them back . 
  but yeah , i think the biggest impact it had for me was that towards the end of season 4 , and especially throughout season 5 , every happy moment felt incredibly bitter sweet . 
  seeing the characters so happy while knowing it was n't going to end up well for them made everything incredibly poignant . 
  true , but we can get a rough idea of what that is from the angle to the horizon . 
  i 'm also having this problem . 
  is there anywhere we can submit an official bug report ? 
  there 's a minimum age to play paintball ? 
  i just recently found out about this site called [ dispostable ] ( http://www.dispostable.com/ ) . 
  you can enter any email address @dispostable.com , and emails sent there you can just access by entering the email address on their site . 
  no need to worry about passwords or setting up the email account ahead of time , or anything like that . 
  i recently went to the coles website for something and they made me sign up in order to view what i wanted to view , so i signed up using fuckyou@dispostable.com . 
  not to undermine how good basco is , but how many other famous filipino voice actors are there ? 
  so yeah ... it 's a new official reddit `` feature '' . 
  hopefully they 'll back down on it , or failing that res can fix it to put it back how it was ... 
  yeah i have to agree with the others , i really preferred the way it worked previously with reddit + res . 
  appear orangered when a message first appears , but if you view your inbox and leave something as unread , until the next time you get a * new * message , leave it white . 
  i do n't mind the count appearing showing the correct number of total unread messages ( again , like res already did ) , but just do n't have the unread count and orangered appear until a new message arrives . 
  it seems like more people liked it how it was than otherwise , so why not put it back ?

  i just always remember it from the zuko/iroh story .
