  as in playing in the pit ? 
  that is so damn cool . 
  i wish i were good enough to do that ... 
  played pit ( reed/clarinet , depending on the production ) in musical productions in high school and it was some of the most fun i 've had musically . 
  wait there 's two series ? 
  i read the ellie chronicles but found them really lacking compared to the originals . 
  what the second sequel series ? 
  anyone know how low they 're going ? 
  i coulda sworn when they went over my bus earlier it was n't much more than 10 metres high . 
  good job of the dm there for just rolling with it so well . 
   bac ig global is n't it , not everywhere use a gpa, 
  i 'm really struggling to work out what you mean by this ... 
  but yeah , i 'm not from america . 
  i know a 4.0 gpa is good ( thanks to movies etc. 
  ) , but i do n't know exactly how good it is . 
  i 'm also trying to work out what 4.0 means as a bac . 
  surely they do n't mean 4 % alcohol content in the blood , by volume , because 0.4 is enough to potentially kill a person ... 
  i 'm going to assume you 're average height for a 77 kg male ( about 185 cm ) of 20 years of age , and that you took 4 hours . 
  i do n't know what `` 90 proof '' means , but a quick google tells me that it means 45 % . 
  plugging those details into [ this website ] ( http://www.rupissed.com/ ) , at the end of the 4 hours your bac would have been roughly ... 
  are you sure you had 1.3 litres ? 
  that 's roughly 3-4 cans ' worth ( depending on your can size ) , or about two and a half standard water bottles ( at 500 ml as the standard size ) . 
  are you also sure it was 45 % alcohol , and not mixed with something ? 
  happy birthday !, 
  a couple of composers have actually written their own versions of happy birthday . 
  here 's [ stravinsky 's happy birthday ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojaeepa0npk ) , and [ copland 's happy birthday ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjncclbdg3g ) . 
  i 've got ta be completely honest , though . 
  i 'm not a fan of videos like this one . 
  ones where they say it 's `` tune x in the style of composer y '' , but really it 's just `` tune x interposed over piece z by composer y '' . 
  i much prefer when a performer can actually take their analysis of the composer 's style , like what [ this guy does ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqomm372e1y&amp;list=uuxpdiwzu-sh8ro-y5_7hnka ) . 
  ( [ another good one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh8axdjeeyy&amp;list=uuxpdiwzu-sh8ro-y5_7hnka ) . ), 
  that said , some of these versions were interposed very well . 
  the moonlight sonata version was particularly good . 
  haha i did n't really do the maths myself . 
  i just googled `` blood alcohol calculator '' and plugged in the details . 
  outside of the numbers you gave me , i made a couple of reasonable assumptions ( average height for your weight , typical age of redditors and party-goers , a time that seemed reasonable for 1.3 l of heavy drink -- that last one was the biggest guess ) . 
   i ca n't think any air force around the world will want to be caught short the way the usaf alert fighters around washington the morning of september 11 were, 
  how far away would the next responders be if there were an actual attack ? 
  surely the ones involved in the actual event would n't be carrying live missiles ? 
  i really do n't know why you put the / s at the end . 
  that 's one of the biggest problems with us tipping culture . 
  not to mention the prices of things require you to add tax onto them . 
  as a westerner who lived in vietnam for a while , if you say nwin in such a way that it seems like one syllable , it 's probably close enough to nguy\u1ec5n that most people wo n't notice . 
  my vietnamese is terrible , but having lived in vietnam for a while , my observation was that many of the pronunciations seem to sorta match the shape of their accent . 
  so yeah , the hook is the reason for the inflection in ph\u1edf . 
  i knew a hung when i lived in vietnam . 
  he pronounced it hoong , with the same oo as in hook . 
  44 % kim , lee , or park . 
  about 36 % without park , to be precise . 
  i suppose that would be a more accurate explanation of the history . 
  umm ... spoilers ? 
  the trailer , yeah, 
  i 'm not ; it appeared on my front page . 
  point is the sub has simple rules . 
  if it 's a spoiler , mark it as such . 
  also no spoilers in titles ( this one 's clean for that , but i 've come across others that had major spoilers in the title ) . 
  no , not hurray . 
  we rely on some problems being easy to verify but hard to compute in order for all encryption systems to work . 
  i would have said more or less the same thing , but with a slightly different wording . 
  my word is law . 
  yeah , i thought the same . 
  as a slogan i do n't mind it . 
  it 's their tv ( and online pre-roll ) advertising using that slogan that 's just cringe-worthingly awful . 
  oh thanks for this . 
  from the picture i thought it was at a much higher speed , making the high tackle incredibly dangerous . 
  but looking at how it actually played out , it was n't really too bad . 
  well handled by the coach . 
  a lot of people here ( australia ) pronounce h `` haych '' . 
  i ( as an australian ) was brought up saying it `` aych '' , and adding in the `` h '' sound , while it makes sense , really bothers me . 
  oddly enough , most english accents i 've heard that drop leasing hs ( cockney might be the most obvious ) tend to sound fine like that . 
  but when americans do it -- especially with the word herb -- it just sounds so incredibly wrong . 
  the english accents make it sound like part of the accent , whereas the americans that do it , it just sounds like they 've decided the h is silent for some reason ... 
  hahaha i love david mitchell 's work . 
  i could be reading it wrong , but according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zeta ) , the classical pronunciation would be [ d\u0361z\u025b\u0302 : ta ] or [ zd\u025b\u0302 : ta ] , which according to [ ipa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_greek ) means the `` e '' in zeta would be pronounced pretty much the same as the `` ei '' in heir . 
  i could only find a definitely classical greek pronunciation for one of those : [ theta ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theta ) . 
  but again , the classical pronunciation uses / \u025b\u0302\u02d0 / . 
  mu was most definitely * not * pronounced `` mee '' , it was pronounced with a / \u0177\u02d0 / sound , which is the similar to in `` cue '' . 
  i could n't find pronunciation for nu , but it stands to reason that it would have had the same pronunciation . 
   i thought i 'd have a quick game of civ 5, 
  famous last words . 
  i would n't recommend half life 1 , to be honest . 
  i really do n't think it 's held up . 
  if you 've got it anyway , for whatever reason ( part of some collection or whatever ) , you can certainly give it a go , but do n't get caught up by the hype . 
  keep your expectations low . 
  i ca n't speak for hl2 , i 've never tried it . 
  i could n't force myself to finish hl1 , so i never started half-life 2 . 
  [ i gave some explanation for why i feel this way over on / r/patientgamers a while back ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/29jt6v/which_patient_titles_did_you_pick_up_in_the_steam/ciloyj4 ) . 
  i 'm about a quarter of the way through a storm of swords part 1 at the moment . 
  i love the books , but i have to be honest , this is one rare case where i think i might like the adaption more . 
  i 'm debating whether or not to continue reading past the show once i catch up . 
  do n't move to asia . 
  ( x \u21d2 y ) ! \u21d4 ( ~ x \u21d2 ~ y ), 
  edited for symbols, 
  perhaps you could argue it * should * be , but there 's no rule i can see in this subreddit regarding stealing jokes from comedians . 
  one could make a strong case that this violates rule 6 . 
  `` no pictures of just text '' , though . 
  pretty sure they 're * still * popular on 9gag . 
  has anybody ever actually seen an animated png in the wild ? 
  that 's more or less the same as the pronunciation i was talking about . 
  at least compared to the `` zee-tuh '' pronunciation .
