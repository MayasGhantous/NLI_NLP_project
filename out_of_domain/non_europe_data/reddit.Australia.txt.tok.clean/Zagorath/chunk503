  any wikipedia article not related to animated formats would count , though . 
  how is it compressed ? 
  i know the big problem with gif is that it just stores each frame as an image , which gives true video formats like webm massive size advantages over it , thanks to inter-frame compression . 
  the apng wikipedia article did n't make it very clear how it works . 
  well it does have a bit of forestry in the background . 
  it looks like it may be on a dirt track through the forest , so it kinda fits with the text . 
  the background 's so dark , though , you can barely see it . 
  fun fact , the same character is used in chinese to mean mountain . 
  the name of korea 's second biggest city , busan , is written in chinese as '' \u91dc\u5c71 '' , and in korean as '' \ubd80\uc0b0 '' . 
  \uc0b0 ( pronounced `` san '' ) is korean for mountain . 
  i thought that shared etymology was pretty cool when i found out . 
  i 'm just curious , in spanish , what is the term for a single female police officer ? 
  would they call her `` el policia '' , using the masculine article regardless of the person 's gender , or would they use `` la policia '' , and potentially cause ambiguity ? 
  or something else entirely ? 
  yeah , the fun part is n't specifically that the same character is used , it 's the combination of the whole thing , ending with the name of the city , busan , being represented by the same character ( or set of characters , in the hangul case ) meaning `` mountain '' in the different scripts . 
  ( you run \u21d2 you die ) \u21d4 ( you do n't die \u21d2 you did n't run ), 
  i.e. ,, 
  ( x \u21d2 y ) \u21d4 ( ~ x \u21d2 ~ y ), 
  that 's correct . 
  that was the point of my initial comment . 
  i did n't realise those symbols had any meaning outside of the korean flag . 
  some languages index from 1 . 
  i try to stay away from those languages as much as possible . 
  but how do you tell which is the lsb and which is the msb ( in the context of the die , that is ) ? 
  i was n't watching at the time , but i believe it 's s03e19 , s04e13 , s04e24 , s05e13 , and two others . 
  probably midseason season 3 for one of them .

  i 'm trying to think whose the third wedding was , and the second funeral . 
  we 've got the awesomes and chuck/sarah 's , and there was the fake casey funeral , but i ca n't remember the last two events . 
  this certainly does sound like a `` the exception that proves the rule '' situation . 
  the rule being `` you do n't need a licence to play in public '' . 
  you need to upgrade to 8.1 . 
  it 's not there in straight win8 . 
  if you ca n't see the power button from the start screen , then you clearly are not running windows 8.1 , or something abnormal is going on . 
  it 's certainly not a normal part of windows 8.1 operation . 
  dude you need to take a serious chill pill . 
  haha that 's brilliant . 
  you should submit that link as a post on the subreddit . 
  woah , could we try and keep spoilers out of post titles ? 
  perhaps of more immediate concern is post spoilers . 
  it 'd be nice to have a flair to mark posts as containing spoilers ( potentially co-opting the nsfw tag ) , along with a rule to keep the spoiler out of the title . 
  [ on the other hand , when eschenbach conducts it , it looks terrifying ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlodbwuj8-s ) . 
  see , all of what you say is why i personally do n't have an apple desktop , and ca n't imagine getting one at any point in the near future . 
  laptops , on the other hand , i personally ca n't see myself getting one * not * made by apple any time soon , for much the same reasons . 
  it being in the trailer implies we 'll be seeing it very soon within the show . 
  i had assumed we would n't be seeing it for at least 2-3 seasons . 
  here 's what i get on my android phone with swiftkey :, 
  say hello to my little girl who is this the other day, 
  toto , i 've a feeling we 're not going to accept my apologies for the benefit of my family, 
  bond . 
  james bond with the actual abc, 
  i 'm a leaf on the wind . 
  watch the video and audio and visual heritage online, 
  goonies never say that i have to withdraw and then get it, 
  you have my sword . 
  and my bow . 
  and my wife, 
  ^ ( not sure where that last one came from ... i 'm not married , so i do n't think i 've ever used the phrase `` my wife '' before . ), 
  and for [ bonus points ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2hrlwy/xkcd_ios_keyboard/ckve4lm ) :, 
  no ; i am your own home, 
  edit : the one from the faux-screenshot at the top :, 
  elementary , my dear friend, 
  iirc , it was n't the soloist that fucked up , it was the communication between the cso 's director and the soloist 's manager ( or whichever two people were doing the actual communication ) that went wrong . 
  i misread you at first and thought that when you said `` giving the a clarinet a low concert c '' , it was a * written * c , which would have made this a basset clarinet , which would have been really awesome . 
  not that this is n't also really awesome , because it is . 
  i think it 's probably worth noting that people in the us make this distinction a lot more than other english-speaking places . 
  i know in australia , at least , nobody ever makes any distinction between a prison and a gaol . 
  i do n't even know if there 's a legal distinction . 
  this is the internet . 
  you do n't ask permission to take things , you just do it . 
  not really seeing the relation to chuck here , except perhaps some vague reference to casey tranquing jefster . 
  google tells me it was n't the chicago orchestra ( / u/no _ booze must have misremembered that part ) , but the [ amsterdam concertgebouw ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_concertgebouw_orchestra ) . 
  [ here 's the story ] ( http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100243153/pianist-maria-joao-pires-panics-as-she-realises-the-orchestra-has-started-the-wrong-concerto/ ) . 
  nine million metres . 
  will it work in vim ? 
  no , this is one shortcut where os x does n't use command for the same thing windows uses ctrl . 
  command backspace deletes to start of line . 
  you want option backspace to delete single words . 
  is there a vi shortcut that works while in insert mode to delete a word ? 
  an expected value of ** 70 damage ** . 
  ouch . 
  well english does give back in the form of all the tech-related words other languages take from it . 
  not quite the same thing , but good enough . 
  maybe we should call it trading rather than stealing or borrowing . 
  i dunno , it sounds like an original composition to me . 
  it reminds me vaguely of a few of the tracks on the show , including volkoff 's theme . 
  as part of [ chucktober ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/2garfg/chucktober/ ) , i 'm planning on doing an in-depth analysis of the musical themes tim jones composed for chuck , similar to [ this analysis of djawadi 's game of thrones score ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bulzc/musical_themes_and_motifs_in_ramin_djawadis_score/ ) . 
  not sure how far through the analysis i 'll actually get -- i 'm getting to the pointy end of my uni semester -- but if i manage to complete it , i may be able to provide a more definite answer to this question . 
   checques, 
  i find this amusing . 
  it 's like you could n't decide whether to go with `` check '' or `` cheque '' . 
  either that or your coach actually should be an olympic quality runner , but does n't push himself hard enough during the run . 
  i kinda wan na know more about what went down in this campaign . 
  it sounds cool . 
  my last campaign had a pretty interesting and unique start to it . 
  it would n't really have worked in anything other than an epic save-the-universe type campaign ( which is what we were playing ) , but it was really cool for what it was . 
  the first session , we were all thrown together without much explanation . 
  we were in some kind of weird space-environment , with an npc as a guide , telling us we had to stop the evil guy . 
  at the end of a dungeon with many super-fantastical traps ( e.g. 
  doors behind which is nothing but fire , doors which loop back to the starting room ad infinitum , doors leading to endless drops -- in retrospect , it 's not a surprise our barbarian developed an obsession with doors ... -- etc.
