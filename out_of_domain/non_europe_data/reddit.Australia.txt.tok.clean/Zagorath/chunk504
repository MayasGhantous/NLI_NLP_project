  ) , we found the evil guy , fought with him , and he escaped through a portal . 
  we then went through the portal , and then ... we woke up . 
  each of us was in our beds . 
  none of us knew the rest of the party , but we all had the business card of the npc that was our guide during the dream , and a note saying how and where to meet him . 
  everything would be explained when we met him . 
  the next session started with us each arriving , one by one , at docks on the mainland , where we were supposed to meet a guide to take us to the island on which we would meet the npc from our dream . 
  it was a cool way to start , because it allowed the characters to not know each other initially , but also gave us a very clear and definitive reason that we all joined a party together . 
  we kinda got the advantages of both campaigns where players already know each other , and ones where they do n't . 
  haha i know what you mean . 
  i 've certainly never used one . 
  for reference , americans typically spell it `` check '' , everyone else spells it `` cheque '' . 
  canadians may or may not count as americans for the purpose of the above rule . 
  i 'm never sure with them . 
  i 'm not judging hl2 , i just am not playing it . 
  i absolutely refuse to engage in any fictional universe without entering it from the beginning . 
  i also have n't seen any of the new doctor who because i first want to watch all of the originals ( or , at least , what 's still available ) , for example . 
  i 'm sure hl2 is an absolutely great game . 
  at the very least i expect its mechanics would be playable , which is something i ca n't say for its predecessor . 
  i just wo n't be playing it until i manage to trudge through hl1 . 
  your comment has certainly given me some inspiration to do that , though . 
  there were things about vista that `` sucked '' , but many of them were not entirely microsoft 's fault . 
  there were big problems with third party driver support , for example . 
  the default uac setting was way too obtrusive , too , blame for that one lies squarely on microsoft 's shoulders . 
  wow , that is absolutely awesome . 
  just incredible world building . 
  all the intrigue and politicking is awesome . 
  i know if i were a player in this universe i 'd want to get involved in that aspect of it , somehow , whether it be to try and unify the different alliances peacefully , or lead one to ultimate victory over the others , or even something much smaller than that . 
  it 's just got so much potential . 
  i 'm sure if you were to submit it here and on / r/worldbuilding , it would be very well received .

  it 's a unicode character . 
  for me ( chrome , windows ) it 's just showing up as an empty square . 
  your previous comment 's last character is showing up like that for me , too . 
  for some reason when i right click on it , the `` search google for ` x ' '' in the context menu shows it correctly , though . 
  ninjaedit : looking at it on my mac now ( chrome ) . 
  your previous comment 's last character now displays correctly , but / u/dcormier 's still wo n't display . 
  god i wish unicode support was better ... 
  oh man , the fact that you got voted up so much more than me is just brilliant . 
  i 'll check again in the morning , but i just shut down my windows computer . 
  i can at least tell you that you did n't mess it up on os x. 
  8 hours `` unicode stuff '', 
  just tried it in firefox on my mac and all the icons here are displaying correctly . 
  thinking of switching back to firefox . 
  the poor unicode support , and more importantly the enormous battery and memory usage are becoming a pain with chrome . 
  do n't suppose you 've got much experience with ff for android ? 
  a big part of the reason i like the google stuff is for how well everything syncs across my various computers and mobile devices , particularly bookmarks and currently open tabs . 
  also how 's search work ? 
  can you set the address bar up to function like chrome 's omnibar ? 
  ( e.g. 
  i have it set to keyword `` r '' goes to `` https://www.reddit.com/r/%s '' , so i type `` r cgpgrey '' and it takes me to / r/cgpgrey ), 
  what 's it supposed to do ? 
  my gpu 's nvidia . 
  pretty sure it was introduced in 7 . 
  it 's still there in 8 . 
  win-m can be done easily with one hand . 
  win-d is significantly more difficult on the dvorak keyboard , but even it can still be done reliably with one hand ( try win-h on qwerty to see what it 's like ) . 
  realistically , you can do pretty much any two-key keyboard shortcut with one hand . 
  that is actually ridiculously easy ... 
  it wo n't mess up if you get a string that does n't contain any unicode characters , will it ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure what the point of this comment was , in context , but it was a nice story nonetheless . 
  i 'd be happy to see the pics . 
  windows-l is such a damn annoying shortcut . 
  i have my mac connected to the same mouse/keyboard as my pc using synergy , and because of some weirdness with keyboard layouts , i end up pressing win-l in order to enact command-n on the mac . 
  despite other shortcuts being treated only on the mac when it 's the active computer , windows decides that whenever win-l is pressed , it will lock the computer no matter what . 
  then , when i go to enter my password , it treats the fucking `` shift-p '' in the bloody password as if i for some reason want to view projector properties . 
   do n't talk about `` defending '' yourself . 
  it 's a passive aggres threat . 
  you either need to , or you do n't . 
  talk about it is totally a `` come at me bro ! '', 
  move ... 
  seriously , that was a massive dick move . 
  yeah , the only time i 've ever seen an f13 key is on one of the [ full sized apple keyboards ] ( http://wpfiles.darkvertex.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/apple_keyboard.jpg ) . 
  so i 've been playing around with it for a bit now . 
  have to say , really not a fan of firefox 's `` awesome '' bar . 
  it really just feels like a nerfed version of chrome 's omnibar . 
  no particular advantages , but managing search providers is far less elegant . 
  still , it seems a small price to pay if i can get better battery life from it . 
  thanks for the feedback . 
  to be fair , it was only in the latest version of os x that apple implemented it . 
  if win9 does it , they wo n't be * that * far behind apple . 
  funnily enough , vista , 7 , 8 , and 8.1 are all actually version 6 . 
  vista was 6.0 , 7 was 6.1 , the initial release of windows 8 was 6.2 , and windows 8.1 is 6.3 . 
  yeah , it 's a head scratcher . 
  yes , 360 \u00b0 = = 0 \u00b0 . 
  however , cos ( 0 \u00b0 ) = = cos ( 360 \u00b0 ) = = 1 . 
  ( it 's a pun on the idea that `` cosine '' , shortened `` cos '' , sounds similar to the shortened form of `` because '' . ), 
  yeah , apple 's done the same thing in the past . 
  initially with os x it was 10 because the previous version was 9 , but since then they 've used `` x '' when they want to jump from a lower number up to a major revision . 
  best examples are quicktime x and final cut pro x , which both jumped from version 7 to 10 , i believe . 
  ( note that itunes 10 did not use an x , since it was a normal upgrade from the previous version 9 . ), 
  maybe the reason there were rumours that windows 9 would be free for windows 8 users was because [ * there will be no windows 9 * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfh4mhp-a6u ) . 
  o esexy ? 
  not a head scratcher in the sense that one wonders why they did it , but a head scratcher in the sense that `` huh , yeah , that 's a really weird way of doing things '' . 
   sorry , but remember , `` explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog . 
  you might understand it better , but you kill it . '', 
  from the image alone i had no fucking clue what you were on about .
