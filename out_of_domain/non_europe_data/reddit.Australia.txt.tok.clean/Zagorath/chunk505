  with the explanation i think it 's a really clever joke . 
  the fact that x is in a much more natural and easy-to-reach location is an added bonus . 
  you have n't actually rearranged the physical keys , have you ? 
  but yeah , it can be a pain sometimes . 
  i usually just switch back to qwerty before playing games that do n't just work out-of-the-box with the dvorak layout . 
  no , typically we do n't . 
  it 's far better to learn to type without rearranging them ( or putting stickers on them ) , because it prevents you from developing bad habits . 
  edit : not to mention it would put the bumps in the wrong place , which would be a huge set back . 
  my first dragon was also my first tpk . 
  definitely not a moment that i 'll forget ... 
  or at the very least , walk on with it like that . 
  pretend you 're going to be doing it , and then take it off before the actual start . 
  rocket, 
  it 's doing all sorts of weird things for me , like skipping some of them , and just not displaying others . 
  and if i 'm exactly 20 ( or 15 , or 35 ) ? 
   it is [ insert word here ] , but it is n't really . . funny, 
  that 's college humor in a nutshell . 
  for what it 's worth , though , they 've had a history of pretty progressive videos . 
  [ this one , for example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otgh0emmmc8 ) . 
  if nothing else-else , you should watch it because there have likely been some changes made , particularly to the effects , but possibly also to the content . 
  if you 're interested , i 'd really encourage you to join us on / r/dvorak . 
  making the change is definitely worth it , despite the minor annoyance with some games ( it 's not too hard to just press windows-space , or whatever keyboard shortcut you have set to switch layouts , before playing a game ) . 
  wait , windows does n't have colemak support out of the box ? 
  just checked ... yup , still no support for it in windows 8.1 . 
  maybe windows 10 will ? 
  for what it 's worth , though , os x 's implementation of colemak is n't quite standard . 
  it leaves backspace and caps lock in their normal positions \u00e0 la qwerty and dvorak . 
  programmer ? 
  i 'd recommend checking out the programmer dvorak layout , either the [ official one ] ( http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/ ) , or making one based off of it . 
  i adapted it and made my own coder 's dvorak that you 're more than welcome to copy or adapt .

  regarding ls , it 's not the nicest key combo , but i find on many keyboards i 'm able to just roll my pinky from the l to the s. 
   gender roll, 
  i 'm picturing a man and a woman in an embrace rolling down a hill . 
  i 'm not gon na say we do n't want you here . 
  quite frankly i do n't care one way or another if you go or stay . 
  i will say , whichever you choose , i do n't fucking need to hear about it . 
  fwiw , still not showing up correctly in chrome on windows . 
  i tried omnibar already , it was n't very useful . 
  did n't know about the other two , i 'll give them a go . 
  cheers . 
  holy shit . 
  haha thanks . 
  i 've found a way to create custom search engines , and figured out that firefox actually has the same feature as chrome built in regarding searching using currently set search engines . 
  it does n't have the intuitive ui to it , and getting the search engines into the system is a pain , but at least it 's there . 
  it 'll require more manual set up than i 'd like , but once that 's done it should be just as good . 
  so that 's nice . 
  that 's the point . 
  i tried openoffice . 
  found its spreadsheet application not as easy to use as excel , and its word precessor was lacking the crucial referencing tools . 
  that was enough for me that piracy was clearly better than sticking with the free legal alternative . 
  i love these beautifully ironic forms of getting back at someone . 
  when my school got a new principal , they decided that when we have assembly , during the time between entering the hall and leaving it , we had to be absolutely silent . 
  normally people would talk while waiting for the rest of the hall to fill up , and the assembly to start , but they decided we had to be absolutely silent for that whole time . 
  my solution to this was to enact a silent protest . 
  complete silence from the time we enter , until the time we exit , including ( most crucially ) no clapping . 
  it had a huge amount of attention on facebook . 
  looked like it was going to go ahead , until teachers caught wind of it before it happened and put a stop to it :(, 
  yeah this was my school , too . 
  teachers could use it , but the only time students could was if they were injured or carrying something heavy ( chiefly musical instruments or sporting equipment ) . 
  i think it 's meant to be one massive free-for-all thread . 
  edit : basically , you watch at your own pace , and discuss as you like . 
  this thread assumes you 've seen it before , so spoilers are not an issue . 
  just started s01e01 . 
  wo n't be able to watch too much until saturday , since i have an assignment due friday evening . 
  anyway , as i rewatch it , i 'm hoping to do an analysis of tim jones ' musical themes , similar to [ this guy 's analysis ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bulzc/musical_themes_and_motifs_in_ramin_djawadis_score/ ) of djawadi 's game of thrones music . 
  should be fun . 
  i saw it at one of the gaming stores in chermside shopping centre last week . 
  did n't check price or which extensions they had , though . 
  is it tradition to put wedding bands on the left hand ? 
  because whenever possible , if something is traditionally done with one hand , i make a point of doing it with the opposite hand . 
  it 's only logical . 
  yes , of course i rely on them to find my place . 
  i usually place my hands at the keyboard without looking at all , and i like to know that what i 'm typing is going to be correct , before i start typing . 
  that is , after all , what the keys are for . 
  uq 's a group of eight uni . 
  i 'm doing software engineering and the cost per semester is $ 4444 , * before * the discount for paying upfront . 
  i 'm actually surprised to hear it 's that high in sweden . 
  that 's more than here in aus ( i pay $ 4444 per semester ) . 
  i 'm not american , but how is there this much discrepency ? 
  if you 're at a proper university for literally 1/20th the price of what others pay , how can that function ? 
  surely it ca n't be worth it in the end to go to the more expensive ones . 
  is there some real difference other than quality/reputation of the degree ? 
  it 's been deleted , any chance someone could share it ? 
  [ op delivered !,

  fuck you asshat . 
  are you thinking of 4e 's hybriding ? 
  multiclass in 4e is just taking a feat in a different class ( from a selection of multiclass feats ) , and allows you to count as that class for future prerequisits . 
  it 's definitely my favourite edition . 
  i 've never taken a serious look at anything prior to 4e , to be fair , but i 've looked at 5e and it just takes out too many good things . 
  many of / u/chance4e 's points from [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dnd/comments/2eton4/ok_it_looks_like_its_pretty_successful_yay_now/ck2tvht ) from a while back , as well as some of the other replies in that subthread ( in particular the sub-subthread started by my reply to chance4e 's comment ) , do a good job of explaining how i feel regarding the changes . 
  i mean , it 's basically the same thing ( i.e. , using abilities from more than one class ) with a different name , but no , hybrid is not * a type of * multiclassing , per se . 
  hybrid is what you set your class to be when you first make your character . 
  hybrid rogue | cleric , or hybrid psion | paladin , or whatever . 
  you get starting stats that are a fusion of the two classes ' starting stats , and you choose powers from each of their power lists . 
  multiclassing is something you do as you level up . 
  you can take , as a feat , something from the multiclass feat section . 
  it 'll have [ multiclass $ class ] next to the feat 's name , for example `` arcane prodigy [ multiclass sorcerer ] '' .
