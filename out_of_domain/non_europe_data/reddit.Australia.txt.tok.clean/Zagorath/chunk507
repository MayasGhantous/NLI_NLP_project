  it 's possible that only people who are at a college use them here . 
  very few uni students in australia stay at a college , so it 's possible that most people here would n't have used them . 
  i would n't really know , i 'm not big on going to parties and such . 
  ( as for what `` college '' means in this context , it 's completely unrelated to the american usage of the term . 
  the closest thing i can think of would be that it 's sorta like a fraternity , but with perhaps less of the negative stereotypes . ), 
  when you say regular padlocks , do you mean with a key , or regular combination locks with three or four number dials ? 
  if the latter , i do n't really understand why the ones from this post would be better . 
  but anyway , i 'm curious what you algorithm was , if you would n't mind sharing it . 
  i 'd like to know if my locks are secure or not . 
  oh no , i definitely agree . 
  i 'm absolutely not going to use made up pronouns like `` xe '' , but i 'm more than happy to call people their choice of he , she , it ( doubt there 'll be many takers on that one , though ) , or they . 
  i was merely pointing out that the existance of grammatical gender can certainly impact human gender perception in a potentially negative way . 
  i 'm sure it * could * be done . 
  but why ? 
  what 's the point of it ? 
  having a single bar of 4/4 music using 8-beamed notes ( i imagine it would be called a semidemihemisemihemidemisemiquaver ) would serve exactly zero practical purpose . 
  i do n't even know of any examples of 8-beamed notes being used within normal music , the most i 've heard of is 6 beams . 
  i 'm a student of the school of information technology & electrical engineering ( itee ) within the faculty of engineering , architecture , and it ( eait ) of my university . 
  in general , the step below the university is a faculty , and each faculty generally consists of a number of schools . 
  haha the chips thing is one of my favourites . 
  you guys have [ chips ] ( http://www.womenshealthmag.com/files/wh6_uploads/images/salty-chips.jpg ) and [ fries ] ( http://robertgholtom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/chips.jpg ) , the english have [ chips ] ( http://robertgholtom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/chips.jpg ) and [ crisps ] ( http://www.womenshealthmag.com/files/wh6_uploads/images/salty-chips.jpg ) . 
  and then there 's us aussies , with [ chips ] ( http://robertgholtom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/chips.jpg ) and [ chips ] ( http://www.womenshealthmag.com/files/wh6_uploads/images/salty-chips.jpg ) . 
  wtf, 
  out of interest , what do you call the individual classes that you take ? 
  at my uni we take `` courses '' , typically four per semester ( so eight per year ) . 
  i believe in the uk they 're referred to as `` modules '' generally . 
  i certainly did n't . 
  seeing abbott awkward like that gave me the most wonderful feeling of schadenfreude . 
  when you think about it , everything bad that happened in the original trilogy is basically jar jar 's fault . 
  wait , let me change that . 
  everything bad in star wars is jar jar 's fault . 
  holy shit . 
  i did n't know you could trace it back that far . 
  i was just tracing it back to him moving to give palpatine emergency powers . 
  but this , this is just brilliant . 
  he really is a horrible character . 
  agreed . 
  now what 's that got to do with / u/blacksheepcannibal 's comment in any way ? 
  but then , anakin also helped him get into power in the first place . 
  who knows what would have happened had anakin not turned to the dark side to begin with . 
  can you get ical or other calendar applications to read it to display along with calendar data ? 
  or is it just unformatted plain text ? 
  ( i 'm on my phone so i ca n't check it myself right now . ), 
  but the ending of humar revolution did n't just depend on your choice in the last scene . 
  there are 12 possible endings , only 4 of which are available to the player at the end of the game . 
  which of the three sets of 4 is available depends entirely on how the player played through the game . 
  it 's not particularly nuanced , but there is at least a very clear and obvious consequence of the player 's choices in the game . 
  i think that there are also some * very * rare circumstances in which the me3-style ending can be appropriate . 
  [ this is a cool example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2179br/of_gay_marriage_kings_and_democracy/ ) . 
  but i definitely agree that as a near universal rule , it should be avoided . 
  agree completely with all of your other points . 
  for `` which of the following best describes your current occupation ? '', 
  i was n't sure whether `` education , training , and library occupations '' was appropriate or not for me , as a full-time student . 
  from the wording , it seemed to me that this was looking at people who are teachers and the like , so i figured it was n't . 
  i put `` other '' -  `` student '' , but considering reddit 's demographics , the lack of an actual `` student '' option could have caused some problems with your results as different people may have done different things when faced with that . 
  some may have left the whole question blank , some may have selected the `` education '' option , and some may have entered the area that they intend to go into after completing their education . 
  i 'm not sure i agree that dx : hr * had * `` good '' and `` bad '' endings . 
  never mind that the whole of the game certainly felt like it does n't have the same sort of moral absoluteness seen in canon d&d , none of the endings felt like they were particularly better than the others . 
  i thought that was the whole point of the ending -- and , indeed , the whole game : that it 's up to the player/jensen to decide what happens , despite none of the possibilities being clearly right . 
  was the ending a deus ex machina ? 
  yeah , probably , but it feels like your criticism is n't really related to that . 
  as for the 4chan story , yeah , there 's a good chance it never happened . 
  but that 's beside the point . 
  the point is that if that set up did happen , then the dm 's response is an appropriate one . 
  as for if they could happen , i do n't see why not . 
  if that 's what the players enjoy , and they roleplay it well , then imo they should be allowed to do it -- with a little luck of the dice -- if it is n't a completely ridiculous notion . 
  \\* puts a sock in it *, 
  really ? 
  i always felt that / r/arrow was pretty chill with the shipping . 
  some people go for it , some do n't , but there 's not too much hate either way . 
  you mean that most shows thing ? 
  just off the top of my head , the first 4 seasons of castle , the first two or three seasons of chuck , basically all of avatar , just to name a few different types of shows that have done it ( and done it well , imo ) . 
  got ta say , i do love the fact that they got someone who previously played superman on this show . 
  chuck was a drop out at the start of the show . 
  he got kicked out for cheating on a test ( falsely accused by bryce larkin ) . 
  later on the cia got him officially graduated , but by then he needed to keep working at the buymore for cover . 
  i 'm kinda hoping that we see her as bc in the season finale , with the rest of the season leading up to that point .

  dedicated podcatchers do * much * better job than feedly does . 
  a quick google and [ feedly themselves admit to being suboptimal ] ( https://feedly.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/178787-how-to-add-podcasts ) . 
  ca n't play in the background . 
  i downloaded it and gave it a quick try for myself , and wow is that a terrible experience . 
  ca n't even do varied playback speeds , not to mention the interface being awkward at best . 
  in my brief look i did n't see a way to actually download the episode for later listening -- though i may have simply missed that . 
  if you 're a regular podcast listener , i would ** strongly ** recommend you grab yourself a proper podcatcher . 
  any of them would be better than a general-purpose rss reader like feedly , though my personal recommendation is pocket casts , for a variety of reasons i can get into if you want . 
  as an australian , i wonder what you think of our pronunciation of water . 
  it 's one that i frequently see made fun of , but if the way we say `` yoghurt '' sounds posh to you , i can easily imagine our pronunciation of `` water '' would be , too . 
  the way i tend to use the skip feature with ads is that i 'll listen to them for at least the first time , usually the first few times , i hear the ad from a particular podcast for a particular product . 
  after that , i do n't really feel guilty skipping it , because i already know about the product and if i have n't been convinced by then , i figure i never will be . 
  what really got to me , more than her saying `` twinkle toes '' was the music there . 
  playing the old avatar theme from tla . 
  them memories . 
  i just want to say i really , * really * appreciate this new rule . 
  wo n't matter to me so much this season , with it being released digitally , so it 's pretty much available to us outside the us just as soon as it is inside the us , but with previous seasons i 've always had to wait a matter of hours before i could watch it after those in america had . 
  i 'm sure all the people who ca n't watch the episode straight away will be really glad of this . 
  just curious , will you also accept the slightly more conventional [ s04e02 ] style tag ? 
  there is n't an `` absolutely no spoilers '' policy . 
  they 're just saying that you need to mark anything that contains spoilers as containing spoilers , and , of course , not include spoilers in the title of the post .
