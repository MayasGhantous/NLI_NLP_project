  he was boxing a black dude . 
  and winning . 
  just out of interest , how did you manage to convince them to let you go to a public high school ? 
  as a jazz and classical musician , i like to listen mainly to interesting harmonies and countermelodies . 
  ( this also can include the bass that many others have said they like . ), 
  i 'm amazed that so many people have this . 
  i usually prefer to actively listen to music , but i can also turn that off and be completely passive and have it in the background , when i want to . 
  it amazes me that you and all these others ca n't . 
  very interesting that different people learn in different ways , i guess . 
  yeah , in real life it 's always lupus .

  edit : a spread made from fruit , good with bread or toast . 
  funny , only a few of those interest me . 
  beyond : two souls , amnesia , and last of us ; even though amnesia 's the only one i 'll be able to play , since i do n't actually have a ps3 . 
  for me , 2012 was ( and still will be ) a much better year . 
  dawnguard , ac iii , kingdoms of amalur : reckoning , dishonoured , and darksiders ii . 
  implying fortnight is n't a word people use today ? 
  there 're a few , but i agree , most are multi-platform . 
  last of us and beyond : two souls are the ones that stand out the most to me . 
  oh fair enough . 
  i hear the word fortnight used colloquially quite often , or rather i did when i was younger . 
  perhaps it just is n't part of american vocabulary ? 
  i do n't actually mean vocabulary , i mean their colloquial vocab . 
  i just could n't remember the term for that . 
  ah wow , very cool . 
  i agree , the current title can be answered in a word , that 's not a great title . 
  if you literally add the words `` to what extent '' to the beginning of it , it 's a great title . 
  what subject is it in ? 
  edit : by the way , that 's awesome . 
  i love the fact that you 've quoted obama 's ama !, 
  hopefully , yeah . 
  but i do n't see it happening any time soon . 
  latest rumours i 've heard , the next iphone still wo n't even have nfc , do i do n't see qi coming to it any time soon . 
  as did i , and many of the rumours from then until very recently . 
  [ here , at cult of mac ] ( http://www.cultofmac.com/187433/rumored-nfc-chip-in-the-next-iphone-more-likely-to-be-in-cell-touchscreen-controller/ ) , as well as [ this article from macworld ] ( http://www.macworld.com.au/blogs/the-latest-iphone-5-rumours-rolled-up-71001/ ) ( which talks about it as if the lack of nfc is old news ) , and then one from [ business insider ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-5-will-not-have-nfc-2012-8 ) . 
  as is usual with these sorts of rumours , they all seem to be feeding off of each other and the same sources . 
  [ anandtech ] ( http://www.anandtech.com/show/6196/preparing-for-the-iphone-next-rumors-analyzed/4 ) seems to be the originator of this particular rumour . 
  the only way i get my news for this sort of stuff normally is from the macbreak weekly podcast , as well as many others on leo laporte 's twit network . 
  to be fair the article says it is legal up to 10 weeks . 
  unfortunately she was 14 weeks pregnant when she killed him . 
  what does the 1 in tfc 1 do ? 
  edit : the 1 pauses it . 
  i thought it was a typo of toga ... 
  did n't realise it meant to go until your explanation , so thanks . 
  it 's kinda sad that this is an unusual experience ... 
  i assume everyone is an american white male at either university level , or just a tad older ( say , 20-26 or so ) . 
  but surely the t is `` toggle '' , so just typing tfc into the console will do it . 
  it 's always worked for me . 
  edit : ah , i just searched it ( could n't easily do it before , was on mobile ) . 
  the 1 pauses the game . 
  perhaps i 've missed it , but how is this classical music ? 
  but is n't it the case that in the much further distant future dark energy will apply on smaller scales , causing galaxy clusters , then galaxies , and then solar systems to break apart ? 
  yeah , it 's kinda obvious that i already knew that . 
  the question was what does the 1 mean ? 
  tfc works on its own to allow free movement of the camera . 
  i looked it up and found the 1 means the game stays paused after you close the console . 
  haha yeah , i 'm going to have to try it out . 
  i 've only recently started playing with tfc , but tfc 1 must be really cool ( and would help when those annoying characters move out of the place i want them , or get in my way ) . 
  ooh , i 'll have to remember that . 
  thanks . 
   how was i to know this bin with wheels was for waste, 
  because it 's clearly in britain ( british police officer ) , and a bin is a place that you put rubbish . 
  pretty sure that 's what he 's pointing out . 
  i just recently found out that chick-fil-a is pronounced more like chick-fil-eh , rather than , you know , chick-fil-a . 
  i know ramen from living in korea , i do n't think it 's at all really american culture . 
  ( unrelated , i have no idea why the english name drops the y. ramyeon would be a more appropriate transliteration , though lamyeon is closer to actual korean pronunciation . ), 
  ~ ~ i 'm just interested in politics , so i know a bit about this . 
  congress is made up of both the senate ( equivalent to the british house of lords , though it is voted , rather than appointed ) , and the house of representatives ( equivalent to the british house of commons ) . ~ ~, 
  i also get lost on many shows , ads , and other things from growing up , as well as the geographical ( and racial , though you did n't mention this ) stereotypes that are mainly american . 
  i feel as though australia probably got more of the same shows as america than britain did , though , so i may be slightly better off on that regard than you are . 
  edit in response to your edit : i feel that apart from my third paragraph , all of this still equally applies , since it is n't really answering what it is that you do n't know , but describing other stuff around that . 
  are you british ? 
  you guys say hoover , do n't you ? 
  i think using brand names is a common thing anywhere , just different people have different ones they use or do n't use . 
  but ramen is n't , to my knowledge , a brand name . 
  it 's a japanese or korean type of instant noodle dish . 
  that 's not what it means in britain ( and australia , fwiw ) . 
  in the uk , [ jelly ] ( http://derbywannabe.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/bowl-of-jello1.jpg ) is a dessert made from water mixed with little crystals . 
  [ jam ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uixon06pz70/sgajfpoejxi/aaaaaaaadsa/ue-fjbhua7o/s800/strawberry+and+rhubarb+jam+500.jpg ) is a spread that you put on bread or toast , and can be either smooth or chunky . 
  i believe in the uk it was an attempt to bring the language back to its french roots , was it not ? 
  whoa , australia just has two . 
  black lid , for general rubbish , and yellow lid , for recycling . 
  really ? 
  i 've only heard it said once or twice , but the last syllable sounded like `` hey '' without the h ( ipa / e\u026a / ) , as opposed to a like in comm ** a ** ( ipa [ / \u0259 / ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:ipa_for_english ) ) , which is what the spelling implies . 
  i guess wherever that was i heard it ( sorry , i ca n't remember ) must have been getting it wrong ... 
  it 's actually a little more complicated than that . 
  i ca n't remember the exact source , but the entr\u00e9e was once a part of a much larger than three-course meal . 
  i ca n't remember exactly what dish it was , but it was one that closely resembles many main meals today , and even though it was n't the main course of the time , in america they kept it as the same * type * of dish , rather than using the word 's actual meaning . 
  assuming this is correct ( i saw a source for it once , but did n't fact check beyond that ) , then both systems make some sense , apart from the fact that it would be logical for americans to switch to what everyone else uses for convenience 's sake .

  edit : sorry , i 'm in a slightly frustrated mood , and i 'm going to put this here . 
  it just annoys me that so many americans do n't understand british and aussie words for things , when we just take it for granted that we know the american terms for things . 
  it really is n't that hard to understand . 
  haha yeah , i 'd say it 's probably true , although you 're right in guessing that may be a cognitive bias . 
  curious , what do you call a pain-killing tablet that you would take for a headache ( not saying the chemical name just so it does n't add a bias in ) .
