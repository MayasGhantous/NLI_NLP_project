  in fact , reading this post was the first time i 've seen he 's an established * hero * character , so that was rather a surprise . 
  definitely agree . 
  this is a particularly egregious example of the [ liar revealed ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/liarrevealed ) trope ( warning , tv tropes link ) . 
  i 'm hoping they 'll subvert the trope by making quentin understand why she did it when he understands . 
  but when the trope is played straight , it 's just terrible . 
  hmm ... like i said , it 's been a long time since i saw the film , but my memory was that we could see bits of kryptonite around him as he lifted it . 
  edit : [ youtube is a wonderful thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znfxnwppeo8 ) . 
  yeah , he 's pretty clearly surrounded by the stuff . 
  `` i know better than members of professional medial organisations and can therefore ignore their recommendations '' . 
  ftfy, 
  i 'm curious , why is everyone calling it a presequel ? 
  is it set in between the first and second games ? 
  the post is n't made by someone that thinks this , it 's parodying people who actually think it . 
  and even if you could , if you have one identical cousin , then you have one identical cousin . 
  it does n't work even if we accept the ( already faulty ) premise . 
  but you do have choice there , it 's just not immediately obvious that they are two choices . 
  the choices are `` have a coke '' and `` have nothing '' . 
  it 's a choice to have nothing . 
  i use [ sharex ] ( https://code.google.com/p/sharex/ ) on windows . 
  it 's * incredibly * powerful , but i have it set up to a simple `` screenshot whole screen '' on ctrl-shift-3 and `` screenshot selected area '' on ctrl-shift-4 , and then automatically upload the result to imgur , and copy the url to my clipboard . 
  edit : [ nicer website link ] ( https://getsharex.com/ ), 
  i was n't aware that website was a thing . 
  i 've always pointed people to the page on [code.google.com ] ( https://code.google.com/p/sharex/ ) . 
  this is so much more user friendly . 
  really it depends on how its implemented . 
  i imagined it going through the entire page character by character , with a 5 character rolling buffer , and any time the buffer matches `` ebola '' , it inserts '' ebola '' after that . 
  that would mean it adds one each time , rather than doubling . 
  i guess you were downvoted because reddit does n't like self-promotion , but i just wanted to say that that was a rather clever story , and definitely appropriate here . 
  probably would have helped if you had copied and pasted the actual body of the message . 
  i have n't got anything really to add to what others have said . 
  what she did was stupid , and she definitely deserves to be told off for it . 
  i just want to ask , though , what do you mean by `` i 've been in a boot for 3 weeks '' ? 
  because i really doubt you were lying in the back of a car for three weeks straight , or in a very large shoe . 
  my group today had a literal chase scene . 
  much * yakety sax * was played . 
   the two got into some kinky shit which i do n't really want to further explain . 
  yes you do . 
  i roll [ [ 1d20 ] ] for persuasion . 
  + / u/rollme, 
  damn it . 
  did n't aragorn et al go up the anduin after travelling through the paths of the dead ? 
  that is so cool . 
  got a picture of the three of you together ? 
  cheers , 
  the artist did n't write `` i need help '' , they wrote `` i ca n't do this alone '' , while the character was sitting and clutching her knees to her chest . 
  it 's not that she physically ca n't do it , it 's that she does n't want to do it without her parents . 
  under the law ? 
  under any reasonable interpretation , fuck no it is n't . 
  many photography-related laws deal with `` reasonable expectations of privacy '' . 
  someone up on a roof , not surrounded by taller buildings , with no low-flying aircraft overhead , certainly has that reasonable expectation . 
  wow the cheezburger network is still around ? 
  there was a girl in my gaming group for a while , before she left because she did n't like 4e . 
  my groups old dm also plays in a group with a couple of girls . 
  i do n't think it 's really all that rare , despite what the stereotypes would tell you . 
  well yeah , that 's really what i meant by `` around '' . 
  it 's very rare that sites that were once that large will completely go offline for good . 
  eh , i do n't think i 'd agree crush the castle was a better game than angry birds . 
  to be fair , i 'm not a huge fan of either game , but angry birds had a more interesting aspect with its different types of ammo than the different sized rocks ctc had . 
  it also had a lot more personality to it . 
  unfortunately not . 
  the only awards astin got ( by himself ) for lotr were :, 
  * las vegas film critics `` best supporting actor '', 
  * seattle film critics `` best actor in a supporting role '', 
  * saturn awards `` best supporting actor '', 
  * visual effects society `` outstanding male or female actor -- effects film '', 
  as well as mtv movie awards `` best on-screen duo '' ( along with wood and gollum [ sic ? 
  ] ) , visual effects society `` best performance by an actor in an effects film '' ( along with wood and serkis ) and a couple of awards given to the whole main cast .

  minor correction , the labor government ** was not ** incompetent at policy making . 
  they were incompetent at politiking , and at communicating all the good they were doing to the general public . 
  other than that , you 're absolutely right . 
  i ca n't speak for the preferred pm stats , because i could n't find any , but the latest morganpoll puts labor ahead of the lnp 52-48 on tpp . ^ [ 1 ] ( http://www.roymorgan.com/morganpoll ), 
  of course , at the time of the election , you would have been correct . 
  source on that ? 
  last i heard it had a very * slight * right wing slant when studied using objective methods . 
  does your phone not have nfc ? 
  i tried that with my gocard here in australia , but the nfc in my phone interfered with it so it did n't work . 
  you can always use the chip n pin system , it 's supported everywhere that supports cards at all . 
  paywave/paypass is more limited , but will generally work at most places that see high volumes of traffic , like fast food restaurants and supermarkets . 
  yup , the maximum here is $ 100 . 
  from memory , i think it 's something like 20 pounds in the uk . 
  edit : i did n't know that about petrol stations , though . 
  ( i do n't drive . ), 
  it 's $ 100 for everything here in aus . 
  not inherently , no . 
  i was merely pointing out that you 're * more likely * to find it at those places . 
  smaller places are less likely to have decided it 's worthwhile for them to pay to upgrade their systems , and so at smaller places you will much more regularly find that they do n't have it . 
  the same is true of our gocards . 
  the two technologies are more or less different implementations of the same thing ( to oversimply it ) , so they interfere . 
  why is that any different to if someone else who 's paid to clean up has to clean it up later ? 
  if you leave gum lying around anywhere other than your own private home , you 're a douche . 
  same with cigarette butts , food/lolly wrappers , and any other rubbish . 
  my initial assumption was that he had died . 
  hey !, 
  what 's wrong with psionics ? 
  i 've been playing a shardmind psion since i first made a character ( after a brief 2-3 sessions playing with someone else 's old character , an eladrin wizard ) . 
  i absolutely love it . 
  the fluff is really cool ; mental powers , reaching in to opponents minds and ripping things out , really fun stuff . 
  mechanically , control is awesome because it 's something that does n't quite have an analogue in most computer games ( like striker -  dps , leader -  healer , defender -  tank ) , and i really like the idea of helping out the team by weakening enemies . 
  the psionic power point stuff makes psions really fun and interesting to play as compared to most other classes , giving me the ability to decide when to put more power into my attacks , but without having specific `` encounter '' powers that can only be used once per encounter each .
