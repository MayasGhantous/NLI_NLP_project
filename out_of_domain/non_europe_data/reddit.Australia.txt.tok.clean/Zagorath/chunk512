  like i said , i have n't had it happen in like 9 years , and i travel regularly . 
  oh right . 
  i 'm still not entirely sure they do , because i 'm pretty sure my bag is usually over the limit . 
  my most recent flights were with air asia , and even they never bothered checking . 
  but still , it 's possible that they just judged that my bag is puffy ( which is true ) and actually not very full ( which , when i 'm flying , is not true ) , or something like that . 
  ppg was my first thought . 
  my second was cobra bubbles from lilo & stitch , which made a bit more sense than the character voiced by tara strong , but still felt weird . 
  the real stuff will also often ( though by no means always ) have visible black spots throughout it . 
  also it tastes so much better . 
  ah that 'd explain it . 
  all the real maple syrup i 've had in the past has been really low viscosity and much less enjoyable than fake stuff . 
  the mona lisa ? 
  sure . 
  that other painting ? 
  eh , not so much . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever heard of it before . 
  a few that i would consider more iconic than it would be the last supper , the scream , starry starry night , and dali 's the persistance of memory ( though perhaps not by name on that one ) . 
  yeah that 's correct . 
  never been to the us . 
  i have flown a huge amount in the asia pacific region , a few times in europe , and once or twice in latin america , though , and all of those worked the way i described . 
  i once had an idea , when i read on the scales they use that they have a minimum reading of something like 100 g , that you could put all your stuff into lots of tiny bags of just under 100 g each , and get away with putting on unlimited stuff . 
  doubt they 'd actually let you do it , but it was n't an interesting thought . 
  what / u/el _ grabba is talking about is something that was the norm during the classical era . 
  since we 're talking about waltzes , it makes sense that the suggestion would be to follow those conventions , since most of the most famous waltzes came from this era . 
  in the romantic era it became far more common for composers to write two unique parts for cello and contrabass . 
  and in modern music , i would dare say that apart from composers specifically trying to recreate a classical style , you 'd be hard pressed to find music where the contrabass part and cello part are not written separately . 
  so really , whichever you want to do would be absolutely fine . 
  by the way , for orchestration tips , [ orchestration online ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/278568792265515/?fref=ts ) is a great group of people .

  it 's been said that `` if ants had nuclear weapons , they would probably end the world in a week '' . 
   war over roses, 
  clever . 
  also related , from the article , `` game of drones '' . 
  but seriously , i 'm just really glad to see that this is apparently totally natural , and not something caused by human intervention . 
  also the fact that it 's between two species of native bees , rather than being a problem caused by the introduced species . 
  [ found it on r/science ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2jvnua/bee_colonies_in_brisbane_are_waging_war_for/ ) . 
  i originally read it in an animorph book , but it was stated as being supposedly from someone famous . 
  when i went to verify the quote before making that comment , i came across [ this page ] ( http://historiesofthingstocome.blogspot.com.au/2010/11/random-internet-if-ants-had-nuclear.html ) , which claims e. o. wilson said it . 
  haha yeah . 
  as i mentioned elsewhere , the place i heard the quote first was in an animorphs book which apparently was well-researched . 
   marco : ( narating ) a month after the experience with the ants , i picked up a book about ants . 
  the author said , '' if ants had nuclear weapons they would probably end the world in a week . '', 
   he 's wrong . 
  it would n't take them that long . 
  i did n't even realise it had n't already gotten the whole season . 
  [ how about a 74 episode season and counting ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_anger_management_episodes#season_2_.282013.e2.80.9314.29 ) . 
  haha yeah , surprising i know . 
  her eyes make me think it 's more of an awkward forced smile to me . 
  is the microsoft surface still a thing ( a non tablet thing ) ? 
  how much would one of those cost ? 
  it 's the same with conservatives the world over . 
  or , at least , i know it 's also true in australia and most western european countries ( the uk included ) . 
  the horstmann style is even worse imo . 
  if only homer simpson had known about this . 
  you guys nearly did . 
  stv is the system cleese is describing in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) . 
  okay , so stv is my personal favourite voting system . 
  having local represantitives means more direct accountability , and especially compared to party-list mmp it means people are choosing who gets in to power , not the parties . 
  it 's what we use here in australia for our senate , and i 'd really like us to switch to also use it in our house of representatives , [ in the way that john cleese describes in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) . 
  ( it would also be great in the uk or the us for each of their lower houses . ), 
  it 's particularly convenient because it would n't require re-education of voters here , since people are already used to voting 1 to n ( with n being the number of candidates ) . 
  all that said , i feel you did n't do a great job of going over the negatives of this system compared to others . 
  it is n't necessarily quite as proportional as mmp , especially in smaller electorates ( 5 or 6 is an ideal minimum , really ) . 
  it also can be subject to tactical voting , albeit much less so than av or fptp . 
  perhaps the biggest issue , though , is how surplus votes get allocated . 
  different systems here can have very different effects . 
  if it 's just `` whichever votes get counted after we 've counted enough for them to reach quota '' , then voters from some parts of the electorate will be over represented and others will be unrepresented . 
  random selection is much better , but still means some people 's votes will be worth more than others . 
  alternatively , you can allocate them proportionally , rather than actually transfering real votes . 
  is n't party-list proportional basically like the mmp video you did ? 
  the only difference being mmp also has half of its election done by fptp . 
  speaking of which , why fptp ? 
  why is n't the local part of mmp done using av ? 
  it did n't play on its own . 
  you had to press play . 
  you were safe all along . 
   yet ` a ' and ` an ' work just fine before ` before ' . 
  uhh ... no they do n't . 
  it should always be `` a before '' . 
  nah man , i had an unicorn for a hour, 
  huh , [ never seen that before ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ivcmyv5.png ) . 
  this is not at all a problem with stv or preferential voting . 
  it 's a problem unique to australian politics and the absolutely awful `` group voting ticket '' system we have in place . 
  basically what it means is that , in order to make voting easier , parties register `` group voting tickets '' , which is a list of votes 1 through n ( where in is the number of candidates ) . 
  if a voter just votes `` 1 '' above the line next to their preferred party , they use that party 's gvt . 
  makes things much easier than the actual voter needing to decide which order to place each of the  70 candidates that might be running . 
  good in theory , but what has ended up happening is many parties end up engaging in convoluted deals behind the scenes , and the preferences do n't go the way people would expect . 
  for example minor parties with a left-wing lean preferencing the liberals ahead of labor or the greens . 
  while these preferences are all available ahead of time , most people do n't bother researching them , and just put a 1 next to the party they like most , disregarding where their preferences will go . 
  [ as you can see here ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/results/sendvic.htm ) , had the gvts been more logical ( with labor preferencing greens immediately , and vice versa ) , labor would have won the final seat . 
  also note that the below the line votes ( those not affected by gvts ) caused `` no significant change in the ordering of parties '' . 
  i stopped feeling the need to jailbreak my ipod touch when i got ios 4 . ios natively started including most of the things i was jailbreaking for , and i think the same was probably true for many people . 
  that , combined with android 's usability improving dramatically and attracting some of the other users who wanted apple 's usability with some more of the features they were previously jailbreaking to get , has probably resulted in a lot less jailbreaking these days than there once was . 
  i 'm also a little disappointed he did n't even touch on the different ways of distributing the surplus votes . 
  question one has a complicated answer that differs in different implementations of stv . 
  in general , though , it 's done proportionally . 
  question 2 relies on an implementation grey used that is actually not widely used . 
  the quota is more often ( number of voters / ( number of positions +1 ) ) , while he used ( number of voters/number of positions ) . 
  additionally , the quota is recalculated when votes get redistributed , to account for exhausted votes .
