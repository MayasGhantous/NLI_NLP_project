  not that it should matter too much . 
  [ the bot works without being able to post ] ( http://i.imgur.com/swjq8h0.png ) . 
   the gvts lead to the large voting paper , not the other way ` round . 
  the ` large ' voting papers that existed before gvt introduction were much , much smaller than those today . 
  can you show a causal relationship between those two ? 
  it could equally be the fact that the population has grown and there is more knowledge of and involvement in politics today . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen any evidence to suggest that the gvts are the reason ballot papers are so large . 
   the fact that any party needs three candidates to get a gvt is problem one . 
  the fact that the party controls the gvt is incentive to have one . 
  agreed, 
   compulsory numbering combined with the declaration of informality if you fuck up even a quite small amount is a terrible combination . 
  just count the ballot until the fuckup occurs !, 
  ( if you get 92 on your ballot more than once , who cares ? ), 
  agreed . 
  or , just remove compulsory voting altogether , and expire the vote when the numbers run out . 
   i kinda wish you could number some of the boxes `` last '' , `` last -1 '' and so on . 
  there are parties i 'm indifferent to , and then there 's parties i 'm actively hostile to . 
  i 'd like to not have to number the 50 people in the middle to get to the latter . 
  why ? 
  the way the system works , there would be no point to this . 
  you should only need to number your preferred candidates . 
  once that 's done , your vote expires . 
  there 's no mechanic in stv or any other common voting system for a `` negative vote '' . 
  personally , i 'd like to see optional preferencing and above the line preferencing . 
  a party can register it 's gvt , but it would only contain an ordered list of * its own candidates * . 
  numbering above the line would place that party 's candidates in your total vote . 
  for example , say this is the set-up on the ballot paper :, 
  labor | liberal | greens | other, 
  tony | 1 \\ . 
  christine | bob, 
  julia | 2 \\ . 
  joe | 2 \\ . 
  bill | 3 \\ . 
  i could number each candidate individually below the line , as i like , e.g. 
  1 christine , 2 scott , 3 kevin , 4 julia , 5 bill . 
  i could vote above the line , by going :, 
  1 greens , 2 labor . 
  which would be the same as above . 
  or i could even mix and match the two , for example :, 
  1 greens , 2 clive , 3 labor . 
  which would be the same as, 
  1 christine , 2 scott , 3 clive , 4 kevin , 5 julia , 6 bill . 
  as far as i can see , such a system would vastly improve what we currently have . 
  it 'd still have the convenience of not having to number huge numbers of candidates , but would offer maximum control over where your vote goes . 
  it would also remove the ability of minor fringe parties to get in by directing tickets into them and receiving a few from surplus votes . 
  oh my god . 
  that 's just ... 
  i ca n't even ... 
  wow . 
  really feel for you guys ... 
  i 'm honestly not entirely sure how hare-clarke differs from that . 
  it 's such a complicated set up but it seems to be pretty much the same thing , as far as i can tell by reading the wp description . 
  [ it comes from here ] ( http://archive.moe/tg/thread/17389309 ) . 
  unfortunately , as far as i can tell , there 's no more to it . 
  positive [ usually evil archetype ] stories are so frequently very good . 
  [ this the one you 're talking about ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2grdzv/an_evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game/ ) ? 
  it 's one of my all-time favourite tabletop rpg stories . 
  on the topic , have you seen [ this story ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2grdzv/an_evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game/ ) ? 
  a character is a character . 
  but you see , in unicode , every possible combination of korean `` letters '' ( for lack of a better term ) is represented as one character . 
  so \uc548 is a single unicode character , similar to how ` a ' is a single character , ' \u6f22 ' is a single character , and even ' \u265e ' is a single unicode character . 
  basically , anything that takes up a single chunk of screen space is a single character ( the exceptions being control codes like u +0000 -- the `` null '' character -- and country flags , as explained by [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stzp76jxsoy ) ) . 
  edit : hmm ... 
  i may have been wrong about the `` single chunk of screen space '' thing . 
  [ this video is really informative ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocxwrc2epg ) . 
  the arabic example would seem to go against what i said before . 
  heck even 500 characters ( which used to be youtube 's comment character limit ) is far too restrictive for any serious discussion . 
  seriously , systems that put any serious limits on the amount of content someone can put in a text post are just fundamentally useless for even the most basic of conversations . 
  under youtube 's old comment system i regularly had to split comments into two parts , sometimes even 3 , just to get my point across . 
  with reddit 's 10,000 character limit , i think i 've only needed to do that once , and the vast majority of people probably never run into it . 
  hmm ... 
  i do n't remember that quest in skyrim . 
  do you know where it starts ? 
  i may have to go back and play it . 
  there used to be . 
  microsoft has n't updated it in a long time though . 
  i do n't think it 'll even work on intel macs . 
  ninjaedit : [ just checked ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_explorer_for_mac ) , and yeah , if you have anything later than os x 10.6 it 's impossible to run . 
  they never made a version for intel macs , and you ca n't get rosetta after 10.6 . 
  i see it most often referring to half life 3 . 
  when someone uses it otherwise , i tend to assume they 're referencing that . 
  that was a great story . 
  thanks for the link . 
   obviously not possible if you did n't use a cc, 
  how else are you going to pay ? 
  i 'm assuming this is online , so virtually any method of payment is reversible . 
  credit cards , debit cards , paypal ( and any similar services ) are all easy to reverse , and tend to find in favour of the customer . 
  edit : i suppose it could be bitcoin . 
  that 's not reversible at all . 
  you got trees on your afl field . 
  hmm ... perhaps it works that way in the us , but to me that seems really backwards . 
  disputing a charge through my bank is just as easy with debit as with credit , and the very idea that they would charge you to do it seems abhorrent . 
  i 'd not be surprised if that would be considered illegal . 
  certainly you 'd never see any bank actually try that shit . 
  if you pay through paypal it 's also their money . 
  but if you dispute that , you 'll have it back with almost no effort whatsoever . 
  far easier than getting it back with either credit or debit through the bank . 
  so i 'm not really sure what the point you were trying to make there is . 
  are you logged in to the wrong account , or is that username some reference i 'm not getting ? 
  ninjaedit : oh right !,
