  wow . 
  i did n't realise that john green had a reddit account that he actively uses . 
  damn that 's cool . 
  is n't sending cash through the mail not allowed ? 
  your reasoning was that it 's easier to get your money back with a credit card because it 's the bank caring more about their money . 
  my point was that it 's * not * their money with paypal , and yet that 's even easier . 
  your conclusion may be correct , but it 's based on faulty reasoning nonetheless . 
  and anyway , you 're probably right -- in america . 
  for the rest of the developed world , we have protections in place that prevent this kind of thing . 
  no to be more of a pedant , but the script is tengwar , which is used ( with some variation ) by sindarin and quenya ( the two well-known elvish tongues ) as well as being used in the inscription on the one ring ( which is the only written black speech we have , so we do n't really know if tengwar can be considered the regular script of black speech or not ) . 
  no you were right about that . 
  black speech * is * the language of mordor . 
  it 's just that the only example of writing in black speech that we have uses the script more commonly used with elvish . 
  rather a lot . 
  teaching yourself is great , but it 's so easy to get into bad habits . 
  more importantly , while one can easily just look stuff up for themselves online , a good classroom will direct you into knowing what stuff is important to know for different tasks . 
  it 's really a far better environment to learn than just teaching yourself online ( though a combination of the two is vastly superior to either on its own ) . 
  source : i should be working on my final software engineering assignment of the year right now ... 
  an interesting theory , but to be honest i do n't think it would really have mattered if there was n't already this huge amount of fanboyism associated with technology products . 
  i doubt many people who use phone-wallets were as angry about grey 's depiction of them as being `` awful '' as some android users were about grey calling android `` not for him '' ( to summarise his reasoning ) . 
  and yet in one case he was saying `` this is bad '' , and the other it 's clearly a matter of preference , as far as he 's concerned . 
  i say this , for what it 's worth , as both an android user and a phone wallet user . 
  ( though for what it 's worth i ** despise ** a very large portion of the android community , just because of all the vitriol they have . 
  i swear , they 're far worse these days than apple fanboys are . ), 
   list of ios text editors, 
  i found this by selecting the above text with my mouse , right clicking on it and going `` search with google '' , and then clicking one more link . 
  [ this could be it ] ( http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/ ) . 
  i 'm not him , but as far as i 'm aware you ca n't actually do it , it 's more of a conceptual thing . 
  when he started with the tax analogy , i thought he was going to suggest moving to some country with simpler tax laws . 
  that would have felt to me like a pretty fair analogy . 
  as for the android/linux thing , why is one variable and the other fixed ? 
  i 'm not sure i follow what you 're saying . 
  but considering android * is * linux , i think the analogy is pretty fair ( at least until i know what your argument against it is , perhaps that 'll convince me ) . 
  i 'm a little less varied than you . 
  nexus phone , nexus tablet , windows 8 desktop , macbook pro . 
  my only linux ( if you do n't count android ) is a bunch of vms . 
   the causal relationships is in the herding that you mentioned . 
  there 's a huge incentive to run a minor party because you get to submit a gvt . 
  heck , that 's even more incentive to run like ten of 'em -- which is partly what 's going on . 
  you run a bunch of parties that attract the above-the-line votes of poorly educated voters and then preference all of the cabal highly . 
  this is all speculation . 
  sure , i agree that 's likely the case , but it 's certainly not proof of a causal relationship . 
   the reason i want to be able to number from the bottom is that i prefer some candidates that i know nothing about over candidates that i know something about . 
  rather than numbering a bunch of candidates in the middle at random i 'd like to have some scheme for those choices . 
  but the thing is , numbering them will have absolutely no effect mechanically . 
  there 's absolutely no point to doing this . 
  if you have n't numbered those in the middle , your vote will be exhausted before it gets to the negative numbers . 
  i can understand wanting to do it for the satisfaction of it , but there 's no mechanic in the voting system to deal with it . 
  try / r/uqreddit . 
  you 'll probably get a better response there . 
  einstein 's formula for ... kinetic energy ? 
  the arrowverse has had some bad technobabble in the past , but wow that was bad . 
  wanting to use kinetic energy was a clever idea , but using mass-energy equivalence and trying to pass it off as the formula for kinetic energy . 
  then again , i 'm not sure how they could turn 1/2mv ^ 2 into a clever joke . 
  i think he may have been talking about the job she had at the start of this season . 
  the chuck hommage when brandon routh 's character came in to hire her . 
  einstein 's equation for kinetic energy bothered me the most this episode . 
  that was really what the point of the opening scene this episode was , with the multitasking chess , pingpong , and that board game .

  which line is that ?

  which taxes do american citizens living overseas pay ? 
  income tax ? 
  well i guess you could always get another citizenship . 
  it 's certainly a more feasible alternative than turning into a bear . 
  why was this necessary ? 
  it displays just fine on mobile . 
  that 's just an rss setting . 
  if you deselect `` use subreddit style '' , or are submitting from a mobile application , the option will still be there . 
  you can also go to [reddit.com/submit] ( https://www.reddit.com/submit ) and submit from there . 
  it 's closer to being a megagame than a tabletop rpg . 
  / r/dndgreentext has some great stories . 
  edit : links to a few of my favourites :,

  * [ demi gods ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2k1qjk/demigods _ xpost_gametales / ) . 
  it 's extremely long , but absolutely worth it . 
  might wan na take this one a little bit at a time if it 's too long for one sitting .

  but there are many , many more really good ones worth going through . 
  it 's not quite as long , but [ the mechanic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/217h1w/star_wars_tabletop_the_mechanic/ ) is pretty lengthy . 
  careful now . 
  the set of rational numbers is n't the compliment of the set of normal numbers . 
  but yeah , wording it in a way similar to that would probably have been much better . 
  while av is a great step ahead of fptp , and i 'm really glad it 's what we use for the lower house in my country , if you guys were to make the switch , it 'd be better to go to something better . 
  stv ( [ which grey * finally * did a video on a few days ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8xozjkozfi ) ) is a great system that you could use for electing your lower house . 
  for the president , it would really depend on whether you were to abolish the electoral college or not . 
  if you * did n't * , then each state could elect its college based on stv .
