  i went to school overseas . 
  i have no idea what 's going on at the moment . 
   but a lot of employers hated them, 
  curious . 
  how come ? 
  since we 're being pedantic here , i feel i should point out that [ this is a rimshot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6dowwqcqm4 ) . 
  what you probably want is a [ `` sting '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:sting.ogg ), 
  it 's by the same guys . 
  there are two versions . 
  one works in russia , the other in the us , canada , uk , singapore , and hong kong . 
  outside there , you 're out of luck . 
  i , too , listen to all about android . 
  unfortunately , this app is useless to me , as i 'm not in one of the countries it allows you to be woken from . 
  the only thing i 've got mine doing is saving all my reddit comments to a google spreadsheet . 
  i wish i could think of more things to use it for , because it 's clearly so powerful , but i just do n't know what i want from it . 
  no point . 
  sure , you 'll then be able to download it , but it wo n't actually function for calling numbers in your country . 
  is used it on my ipod touch , before i got my android phone , and sleep cycle was n't available on android . 
  i just found it so much more reliable . 
  i do n't know if it 's because the ipod touch 's accelerometers were better , or if it 's just the app is programmed better , but i definitely had a tendency to be woken up more rested with that than i did with sleep as android . 
  he was faster than it . 
  he started a lot further behind , and he almost got there in time . 
  it had too much of a head start on him . 
  most of the time this works well . 
  but there are a few things it absolutely refuses to learn . 
  and i.e. 
  are ones i use pretty frequently , and because of the punctuation in them it does n't learn them correctly . 
   luckily you can do a long press and tell it to not remember certain words again, 
  useful to know , for ... reasons . 
  not available in most countries . 
  only uk , us , canada , hong kong , and singapore . 
  there 's a separate version available in russia . 
  the reason is probably because it uses the actual telecommunications network to call you . 
  if they do n't have a set up in your country , it 'd cost them way too much to wake people up . 
  being a waker , though , should work in any country , i think because that uses voip . 
  the only reason you 've ever heard of the greek poet homer is rome 2 ? 
   so if the app is n't waking you at your lightest cycle, 
  it is . 
  they use the accelerometer in your phone to monitor your movement , and use that to estimate what stage of sleep you 're at . 
  when you set the alarm , you 're really setting a `` latest possible time '' for the alarm to go off . 
  in reality , it will go off up to 30 minutes before that , when it perceives that you are in a light stage of sleep . 
  [ here 's their play store page ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northcube.sleepcycle ) . 
  i 'd disagree that knowing about homer 's the odyssy or the iliad is n't common knowledge . 
  i think most people would probably have heard of them , and by extension , him . 
  that said , i do find that quite interesting . 
  not judging you , just found it interesting . 
   a fight breaks out, 
   all because of a stupid fucking ring, 
  sounds weirdly familiar , 
  seriously , magic rings are never a good sign . 
  people have worked out the scale of * angry birds * using its portrayal of gravity . 
  if * someone * does n't eventually do it for the avatar universe , i 'd be surprised . 
  sounds about right , to me . 
  did they do that for the same reason as galactica 's `` frack '' ? 
  seems odd that you 'd need to censor god damn in the same way that they censored fuck . 
  wait , you do n't smite evildoers in real life ? 
  you 're really missing out , buddy . 
  remind me never to take your photo . 
  my dad ( who 's a teacher ) has the opposite advice . 
  ( regarding choosing a field of study  follow your dreams ; welcome to teaching . 
  when i was little , i wanted to be a palaeontologist . 
  other people wanted to be firemen , astronauts , etc. 
  i doubt many people end up doing what they wanted to do in primary school . 
  when you get older , you grow out of wanting to do that thing , and as they start thinking a little more realistically , they realise they have no idea . 
  that 's certainly how it was for me . 
  what if i 'm a skinny person who eats like crap but * does * exercise ? 
  what type of storyline are you going for ? 
  my last campaign started in a way that was awesome , but would only work for big , grand , save the world/universe type campaigns . 
  the first session , we were thrown together in a weird spacey area . 
  we had no idea who each other were , we were just there , with one guy who knew what was going on and was guiding us ( an npc ) . 
  at the end of the session , we encountered the bbeg , who escaped through a portal . 
  we followed through the portal , at which point ... 
  each of us woke up in our own beds . 
  in each of our pockets was a stone business-card-type thing , telling us where and how to meet that npc that was guiding us , and that it was urgent we come . 
  definitely a gag that would n't work for most campaigns , and you could only really do it once , but it worked really well for us . 
  alternatively , the tried and true method of `` they meet in a tavern '' is always good . 
  perhaps it could be someone comes into the tavern and publicly asks for volunteers/helpers , or some event at the tavern forces them all to get involved . 
  the point i was trying to make , though admittedly i rambled a bit and the point got lost , was that while they `` know '' what they want to do at a young age , they often decide against that without actually deciding what they now * do * want to do . 
  but they may not really * know * what they love . 
  they might love/like a bunch of different things , and they do n't really know what they want to do . 
  i know that 's more or less how i was at that age . 
  as someone from queensland , australia , i agree . 
  damn southerners with their random shitty clock changes . 
   hope he washed the sheets before the owners got back . 
  to be completely honest , i would hope he did that regardless . 
  [ seen this ? 
  ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2cfcbv/challenging _ death / ), 
  i do n't know what lbm and lbf are , and i 've never seen the gravitational constant written `` g_c '' ( it 's usually `` g '' ) , but if you 're talking about the one i 'm thinking of ( 6.67 * 10 ^ ( -11 ) ) , then i do n't know why the use of it is `` the worst '' . 
  it 's a useful constant with a bunch of good applications . 
  nope , most of the us and canada , pretty much all of europe , a few aussie states , nz , and some of south america use it . 
  edit : [ map ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daylight_saving_time_by_country#mediaviewer/file:dst_countries_map.png ), 
  oh man , it 's so rare that i 'll find someone from one of the southern states that agrees it 's nonsense . 
  oh right . 
  i missed that part . 
  with how well seq 's gocards work , i 'm quite amazed at how terrible everyone seems to say melbourne 's system is . 
  i bought a really basic set of 7 dice on ebay for au$ 5.94 . 
  thought that was an amazing deal since all the local stores i could find charged over $ 10 , plus ridiculous shipping costs . 
  ( never been in to a local brick and mortar store . 
  should probably try it some time ... i 've just never walked past one . ), 
  by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs , but by a two thirds majority in the case of more major ...
