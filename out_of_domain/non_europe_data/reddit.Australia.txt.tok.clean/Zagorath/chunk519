  i do n't think so . 
  by hovering over it , it tells me it was posted at 1843 on friday . 
  i 'm at utc +1000 , but converting it to new york time that would be 0343 on the friday . 
  even san francisco time puts it at 0043 on friday . 
  ( going by [ this ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=new+york+time+zone&amp;oq=new+york+time+zone&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65j69i60l4.1513j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=utf-8 ) and [ this ] ( https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=san%20francisco%20time%20zone ) , which say new york and san fran are utc-0500 and utc-0800 , respectively . ), 
  unless it was posted from somewhere like hawai'i , it was posted on a friday . 
  this might sound a little counter intuitive , but ** portal ** and ** portal 2 ** are actually really easy to play with the trackpad . 
  just remap left click and right click to q and e , and away you go . 
  that 's actually the way i played them , and while there were certainly a couple of times ( especially in portal 2 ) where moving around correctly was more difficult with the trackpad than it would have been with a mouse , but it was definitely not unplayable . 
  i played broho on my old mbp . 
  much lower specs than op 's computer . 
  it played decently most of the time . 
  very noticeable lag throughout , but i managed to get through it . 
  but the scene near the beginning with the giant battle . 
  oh man , that was absolutely awful . 
  i swear i must have been getting framerates as low as like 2 fps at some parts of that . 
  should run fine on a more recent one like op 's , though the lack of discrete graphics could potentially be a problem . 
  probably best to find a demo or something first before buying it -- if buying it is how you 're gon na get your hands on the game . 
  order , eh -- who does he think he is ? 
   approved by abc, 
  curious . 
  where have they done this ? 
  is that what their files like like on iview ? 
   about half the amount of harry potter and the philosopers stone, 
  well fuck . 
  i think i 'll wait until after my exams to read that one ... 
  really ? 
  it 's how i start most conversations . 
  that 's a pretty good point . 
  how many major marvel characters apart from spidey really do the whole `` secret identity '' thing ? 
  do you play tabletop rpgs , by any chance ? 
  yeah from my memory , that 's about right . 
  but then there 's the reason he became a blood mage , which was related to the whole `` forbidden love '' thing . 
  cracked used to be absolutely fantastic . 
  they had some brilliant material . 
  i cited one of their sources in a paper i did in highschool . 
  strictly speaking wicked is n't the same canon as baum 's oz series , though it 's certainly nice to think of them as being in the same universe , at least when there are n't direct contradictions . 
  wait , we 're getting a felicity origin story ? 
  man , does anybody else think just how amazing that is , considering she was originall supposed to be in like two or three episodes , tops ? 
  she was a hit with the fans . 
  she was originally only meant to be around to drive oliver 's stepfather 's little quest with the technology/research stuff . 
  speaking of which , what happened to him ? 
  did he die ? 
  still no mention of the kindle justification . 
  and yeah , the last election had ridiculous numbers of candidates . 
  50 would be an improvement . 
  my ballot had 72 , from memory , and that was only the third largest state . 
  new south wales had over 100 . 
  ( only really putting this here for reference from others . 
  i know grey knows this from the comments on the stv addendum videos . ), 
  ah thanks . 
  i thought he was ( did n't remember him dying ... ) , but i could n't remember what did happen to him . 
  oh good . 
  i rather liked him as a character . 
  i use it pretty regularly . 
  the first time i go to youtube on any given day , i 'll go to the subscriptions page and watch through my subscription videos , but once they dry up i find the what to watch page often has pretty good stuff . 
  i 've even found one or two channels that i subscribed to because of it , though more often it 's one off things . 
  i 've got ta be honest , i do n't understand why so many youtubers ( and it 's not just you guys , everyone seems to do it now and then ) complain about the subscription system . 
  it 's like the modern equivalent of airline food , almost , in the way it 's become the butt of every joke . 
  sure , the default page does n't show your subscriptions any more , and that 's a damn nuisance , but it 's not like you ca n't easily * get * to a page that shows videos from your subscriptions . 
  it 's only one click away from the homepage , for god 's sake . 
  the void is kratos ? 
  huh ... 
  i was never aware marvel 's universe had both the norse and greek gods . 
  ( though to be honest , until the recent marvel cinematic universe series , i was n't even aware of the norse gods being in there . 
  i was really confused when people told me there was a thor movie in the same universe as iron man . ), 
   ever since the awful g + forced integration and the obliteration of the comment system, 
  if you 'd actually bother to look , i think you 'd find that the comments have * vastly * improved as a result of the change . 
  a lot of people had a knee-jerk reaction to the change , but that 's just the way people on the internet tend to be . 
  there 's no * real * downside to the change . 
  you can write longer comments , have basic formatting , share links , reply in-line , and the sorting algorithm , while still far from great , is vastly better than it used to be . 
  plus , the link with g + has resulted in vastly fewer trolls than before ( though , of course , with how easy it is to make a g + account with a fake name , it still has n't eliminated them entirely ) . 
  i definitely agree . 
  there 's absolutely nothing wrong with * having * an email system , and even keeping it at parity with the rss feed in terms of content delivered , but rss is really not hard to get into , especially not with something like the old reader or other major online feed readers . 
  there 's really no reason that anyone should promote the email system over the rss one . 
  mention that you have email as well , but concentrate on the vastly superior system . 
  i just wish they gave me the option to set the subscription page to the default . 
  or even have both on the home page , side by side . 
  i rather liked the old system , to be honest . 
  a quick view of the most recent subscription videos at the top , with a button to view a stream of all your subscription videos . 
  below that , a few `` recommended videos '' with a button to see more recommended videos . 
  [ this message is hidden ] ( / spoiler ), 
  is how you should do it . 
  your weird syntax relies on reading the title text , which is really not a great experience . 
  [ this message is hidden ] ( / spoiler ) . 
   is this an argument against approval ? 
  yes , yes it is . 
  not in the case of `` should we use this rather than fptp '' , but in the argument of `` which voting method should we use , with everything on the table ? 
  '' , this is a very strong argument against it . 
  i 've seen a bunch of people on reddit arguing that it should be used * rather * than instant runoff , or even systems like mmp and stv , in national elections . 
  that 's always seemed really odd to me , what are your thoughts of it in that scenario ? 
   s/rub/rob /, 
  would it not be better to go with ` : % s/rub/rob / gc ` , to make sure you are substituting the right one ? 
  ( on accounting of not really being able to have the cursor on the right line , since you 're in a web browser . ), 
  instant runoff ( aka alternative vote -- i actually prefer the name alternative vote , but to make things less ambiguous with approval voting , i 'm going with irv here rather than av ) is basically the special case of stv where the number of positions available is 1 . 
  when you run stv , you choose a certain number of people who will win , and the algorithm will produce that many winners . 
  if that number is 1 , then you have exactly the same situation as with irv . 
  for what it 's worth , there are some people who choose a diet of entirely meat . 
  it 's not a very common choice , but it does happen . 
   informal vote ( donkey vote ),
