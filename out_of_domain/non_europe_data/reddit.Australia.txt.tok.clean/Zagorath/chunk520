  not the same thing . 
  an informal vote is a vote which , for whatever reason , is invalid . 
  maybe you drew a picture of a penis on the ballot paper and handed that in , maybe you numbered 1 , 2 , and 6 , or ( in australia ) failed to number every single candidate . 
  a donkey vote is numbering candidates 1 , 2 , 3 , etc. 
  in the order they appear on the ballot paper . 
  because it could theoretically be the way the voter actually preferred the candidates , it 's counted as valid , even though most of the time it 's a result of someone not caring who their vote goes to . 
  is that [ this ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9286/ ) ? 
  could you give an overview of a few of the things it does ? 
  it certainly looks interesting , so i 've been considering grabbing it , but because it 's such a massive overhaul i 've been reluctant to take the leap . 
  i can see how that might theoretically be the case , but it just is n't what 's happened . 
  combined with the simultaneous release of much stronger comment moderating tools for uploaders , i 've seen a massive drop in the amount of trolling . 
  admittedly , when it happens , it tends to be in one of the top few comments , because of the controversy , but it 's easy to just move past that , because the next comment down is usually great . 
  plus , anything that helps google + out is by definition a good thing , since it 's better in literally every way than facebook , save user count . 
  hmm , that 's curious . 
  the recommended section 's always been at the top for me on what to watch ; well , below the banner ad , anyway . 
  it 's usually followed by a bunch of lines with `` recent uploads '' from channels i subscribe to ( but not their * most * recent uploads , necessarily ) , and sometimes a `` recommended channel for you '' . 
  edit : agree with you on the maximum of 24 videos thing . 
  i 've never noticed that before , but yeah , it 'd definitely be nice to be able to expand that further . 
  i first saw about it on a doco comparing different diets . 
  and surprisingly , a carefully selected carnivorous diet was healhtier than a not particularly selective veganism . 
  hmm , unfortunately , it looks like the source was an episode of an old health education tv show . 
  they only tested 5 people , an omnivore , and vegetarian , a vegan , a careful carnivore , and a haphazard carnivore . 
  ca n't find the video , but [ here 's an online summary ] ( http://health.ninemsn.com.au/whatsgoodforyou/theshow/694264/meat-versus-a-vegetarian-diet ) . 
  i 've got ta be honest , i never even realised you could expand it a little bit before . 
  i imagine most others do n't , either , so it probably would have only a negligible impact on overall engagement . 
  i bought myself a quill & ink and a wax sealing kit to add further legitimacy to this process . 
  there are some brilliant videos about this on youtube . 
  here are a couple i found good :, 
  * http://youtu.be/dj-qhnn43bo, 
  * http://youtu.be/5ipa2xhqa7s, 
  finding other videos on the same channels as those two , or in the recommended videos on the sidebar , or searching for `` old paper '' , `` fake vellum '' etc. 
  can turn up a bunch more god ones . 
  normal a4 printer paper should work fine , and inkjet printed should work fine . 
  just make sure the ink is completely dry . 
  ** zagorath the psion shardmind ** . 
  despite being able to manipulate people 's minds through psionic powers , he has a lot of trouble understanding mortal people 's concepts of emotion and morals . 
  a few years after studying with another psion , she was struck down by a shardslayer who had torn through the town looking for zagorath , causing immense damage and killing countless innocent people . 
  it was then that he realised the strength of his feelings for her . 
  an immense feeling of ( platonic , because he 's asexual ) love . 
  he then made it his mission to hunt down and destroy shardslayers to stop them from causing harm to others . 
  weilds a staff of beech , and wears a cloak of green and silver . 
  his body is silvery crystals with bits of light blue below the surface . 
  red crystals for eyes . 
  ** krolm the barbarian goliath ** . 
  raised apart from the tribe of his people in frozen wastelands , he became a force to reckon with , wielding the power of frost . 
  he has a strong sense of honour , but a tendency to enjoy drink a little too much . 
  enjoys carrying around doors and using them as shields and weapons . 
  later in his life , he befriended a tribe of goliaths , and one young child in particular . 
  as part of a ritual to join the tribe officially , he was asked to sacrifice an elven maiden that they had captured ( the goliaths in our setting hate elves ) . 
  out of honour , he refused to do it , and instead freed her , and was expelled by the tribe . 
  the young goliath child went up to him and returned a gift he had been given . 
  ( think the end of zuko alone . ), 
  the elven maid ended up being the heir to the throne of another land , and he 's now basically royalty , and goes around wearing big royal robes and stuff . 
  typical muscly , tall , barbarian build , with a wild head of hair tied back into a pony tail . 
  he weilds his powerful sword , named `` honour '' after his decision to save an innocent life from the goliaths . 
  somewhat ironically , the sword gains bonuses to damage against elves . 
  ** s.b. , the spirit bear ** . 
  our homebrewed class/race combination , he plays much like a paladdin , including having lay on hands . 
  he spent a good amount of time helping to raise and train krolm , and as such the two of them formed a strong bond . 
  he weilds mighty claws infused with firey powers ( making the two of them `` ice and fire '' ) . 
  a very strong sense of honour and good . 
   what he thinks is a menacing look, 
  but what do others think ? 
  i absolutely love damocles ' character such a brilliantly sad back story . 
  awesome job from you as a dm introducing the young psionic girl ( i 'm assuming you added that in for him , at least , and that it 's not a part of his previous backstory ) . 
  really agree with your edit . 
  it 's really disappointing . 
  it looks like they 're downvoting the op as well , so less people see it . 
  seriously guys , just upvote the good posts , it 's only a little bit of fun , so do n't be unfair about it . 
  oh man , this is such an awesome party . 
  pretty much every character in there is fascinating . 
  a seer whose name has been lost to time , an illiterate king , a fiercely loyal ... rogue -- that 's an interesting twist . 
  seriously some great stuff there . 
  but holy shit . 
  a party of ** eight ** ? 
  how do you guys manage ? 
  my group has 6 ( i only mentioned 3 in my post because 2 others recently made new characters , and our dm swapped with one of the players , so i do n't know the other characters too well yet ) , and that 's barely manageable a lot of the time . 
  oh that 's brilliant !, 
  what was his reaction like when he discovered otherwise ? 
  love that insignia design . 
  simpel , but clearly represent 's the party 's name , with the fusion of a compass and an eye . 
  ca n't say i 'm a huge fan of the colour choice , but yeah . 
  p.s. , you guys should take a look at the book of erotic fantasy . 
  sounds like you could use it , with both ri and belgon having done the deed . 
  `` you 've been beguiled '' is a brilliant catchphrase . 
  haha yeah . 
  i do n't really know what it 's like , or even which edition ( s ) it 's for , but the fact that it exists is just brilliant . 
  they 're not even all numbers . 
  different countries use different formats , but as a general rule , they are * very * likely to contain letters . 
  phone numbers are probably a better example to use . 
  purely numeric ( sometimes letters are used to make them easier to remember , and they 're often displayed with spaces , brackets , hyphens , and a + sign , but the underlying number is just a series of digits 0 -- 9 ) , and yet still should be represented as a string , since it can start with a 0 . 
  in addition to the things mentioned by others , passport numbers * do * contain alphabetic characters . 
  scrollbars change size when someone changes the scroll sensitivity on their mouse ? 
  right , but you can see the scrollbar there , and from the looks of it , the licence agreement is fairly short . 
  haha yeah , what the fuck is going on here ? 
  every time i refresh the page it looks like my score is switching between -2 and 5 , up and down , up and down . 
  i was beginning to think it was just a weird quirk of reddit 's system . 
  gon na have to strongly recommend to op , ignore the votes completely . 
  pick the one that you think would be the most interesting/the biggest challenge/the most varied/whatever to draw . 
  make the decision for yourself , because these votes are just ridiculous .
