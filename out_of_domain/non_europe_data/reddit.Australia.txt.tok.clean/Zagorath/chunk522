  it adds a sense of weight/solemness to the character death . 
  ah right . 
  i did n't see the comment where he mentioned that . 
  most of the bicentenial bikeway has two sections , one for pedestrians , one for cyclists . 
  that said , the cylist section is also where rollerbladers are meant to go , so yeah , high speed cyclists should probably stick to the road , not the bikeway . 
  yeah ... umm ... 
  the thing about murder is that it 's deliberate . 
  if it is n't deliberate , it 's given some lesser charge . 
  hmm that 's very interesting . 
  i did n't know that was possible . 
  what 's the $ 54 fine for ? 
  if you crash into someone while riding on the footpath ? 
  wait what ? 
  it is n't in queensland . 
  that 's a pretty dumb law . 
  it 's still arguably racist . 
  just that it 's not google being racist , it 's people using google . 
  saturday is when we do it in australia . 
  works very well , imo . 
  i 'm pretty sure that happens specifically because they were * forced * to do it . 
  if a person is doing it for themselves , i doubt they would have the same negative effects . 
  i 've been doing it recently so that i could learn to write with a fountain pen or a quill . 
  there are some good videos that 'll help on youtube . 
  [ i 've found this one particularly good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jniqiooh4tg ) , as well as many of the other ones by that woman . 
  the `` down and down and down '' technique is really good . 
  but really , like the others are saying , the best thing is just to * practise , practise , practise * . 
  i try to write at least a page per day , usually quite a bit more . 
  it can also help to try doing a bunch of things in your daily life with your right hand , where possible . 
  carry things , open doors , brush your teeth ( actually , as a general rule , everyone should use both hands to brush their teeth -- it helps make sure you 've reached every spot ) , that type of thing . 
  it helps strengthen the hand . 
  not the same . 
  he does n't do the bit from op 's video in this one . 
  it 's probably best to assume queensland in this thread , unless otherwise specified ( or shown by flair ) , just because that 's where the story came out of . 
  but anyway , [ the law is basically the same here , too ] ( http://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/travel-and-transport/cycling/bike-user-guide/road-rules-for-cyclists.aspx#lanes ) . 
   you should :, 
   * always use a bicycle lane where provided , unless it is impracticable to do so, 
  however , the road mentioned above , coronation drive , does n't actually have a bike lane . 
  there 's a completely separate bike path that runs parallel to it for a fair distance , but being fully separate from the road , i doubt that this particular law applies . 
  which is , for what it 's worth , an absolutely awful route to have to go . 
  inbound , it 's got one ridiculously steep climb and a couple of fairly dangerous descents ( narrow roads and sharp corners , easy for cars to appear out of nowhere , or to slip in wet conditions ) , outbound there are two tough climbs . 
  riding along fred schonell itself would be , were it not for the danger of the actual cars which are always racing by , a much better ride . 
  a single fairly leisurely climb on a completely straight path . 
  the queensland government 's been running some ads recently that i rather like . 
  basically , they 're saying that cyclists should be considerate of drivers , but at the same time drivers need to remain patient when the cyclists ca n't move over enough to give them room . 
  seems pretty reasonable expectations for all parties . 
  edit : another good one in the series :,

  oh do n't get me wrong , i always use that bike path . 
  i 'm a fairly strong rider , but fred schonell terrifies me because of the cars . 
  i 'd just prefer it if they widened fred schonell and added a bike lane in there , or something like that . 
  yeah definitely . 
  as much as i hate that bike path , i 'll always use it rather than fred schonell . 
  i 'd just really prefer them to widen it and add a bike lane . 
  the current bike path is a bit ridiculous , and rather indicative of one of the reasons many people do n't like to ride in brisbane . 
  someone who 's not a strong rider literally ca n't do it : i often see people having to walk up the hill on hiron st. 
  it puts people off riding . 
   it 's safer than going with a body of traffic behind/adjacent to you, 
  i stop at red lights , and wait until the cars have passed before starting after it turns green ( in situations where it feels unsafe to start straight away ) . 
  yeah no . 
  just because he 's being a prick , do n't be a prick to all the law-abiding cyclists out there . 
  i tried riding from uq to bracken ridge ( just north of chermside ) once . 
  that was an absolutely awful route to ride . 
  i would very gladly see improvements to that area . 
  if you 're a transport cyclist , the bicentennial bikeway is exactly the perfect sort of place for a person like you to be riding . 
  it travels past a number of red lights , allowing you to completely avoid them . 
  it 's not really a shared path . 
  the cyclist section and the pedestrian section are themselves separated for almost all of the durating of the road . 
  [ here 's a picture from google maps ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mx9u9zc.jpg ) . 
  the green part is the bike path , and in grey is the pedestrian path .

  ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sorry . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ could n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ resist , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ given ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ how ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ worded ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that . 
  most do n't . 
  the only ones that i 've ever seen on the road are cyclists training in bunches , usually early in the morning . 
  how did i miss that the first time through ? 
  thanks . 
  i love that it 's 007 . 
   what firmly enlarged the divides in britain, 
  if you 're not australian , and you 're trying it out for the first time , then this is good advice . 
  any true australian can eat it straight out of the jar . 
  i was never a pooh fan growing up , and i 'm not a nazi or a satanist . 
  i think the theory checks out . 
   but considering it was based on true events and strongly portrayed the red scare , it 's probably better than we realized at the time, 
  perhaps i 'm reading this wrong , but it sounds like you did n't know that at the time . 
  did your teacher really not bother pointing out the incredibly important aspects of it , that it was both based on true history and was an allegory for events going on at the time ? 
  i 've got ta be honest , i feel like this has far more to do with the students than it does the classroom . 
  students go into it expecting to hate it , and so that 's what they get . 
  i 've liked maybe 80-90 % of the books and plays we had to read for school . 
  i grew up reading from a very young age , and so i 've always enjoyed it , and so when we had to read things in class , most of the time , i 'd enjoy that as well . 
   i also have an never opened safe, 
  oh god . 
  not this again . 
  ( haha , sorry , i only just noticed that bit . 
  thought it was amusing . ), 
  it 's what op asked for . 
  cut time is 2/2 , shown with the cents time signature , but he apparently wants it to actually have a breve per bar which would be 8/4 or 4/2 .
