  the only way / u/thmsbsh 's comment is wrong is if op explained something poorly , or if op 's instructor meant semibreve rather than breve . 
  it 's also by far the best wind instrument for glissandi . 
  one thing that i love is that it 's the only wind instrument ( at least out of the ones i 've tried/heard from performers ) where the lowest possible note is as easy as the middle of the range . 
  on most wind instruments , both the really high and the really low notes get difficult to play , but not so on the clarinet . 
  bottom e is as easy as middle c or the c above that . 
  the last federal election in my country was won in no small part due to a relentless media campaign from an american citizen who happens to own the world 's biggest news outlets . 
  there ai n't no requirement that a person live in a place to spend big money campaigning for what they want . 
  ( though perhaps there should be . ), 
  is this a movie about praying mantes ? 
  yeah . 
  before the ncis two people on a keyboard thing . 
  my current favourite example of technobabble in the arrowverse was on the last episode of the flash . 
  not programming , i 'm afraid , but should be interesting to most people here nonetheless . 
  they were at a pub trivia night , and their team name was e = mc hammer , which they claimed was because e = mc ^ 2 is `` einstein 's formula for kinetic energy '' . 
  i mean , i get that they want to shout out `` kinetic energy '' when talking about the flash , but seriously . 
  taking * the most famous equation in all of science * , einstein 's mass-energy equivalence equation , and calling it a formula for kinetic energy . 
  what the hell , guys ? 
  i just ca n't imagine learning about it without that being brought up before we even started reading it , as well as regular mentions of its significance both in historical context ( how certain events changed from real life ) and in terms of modern allegory . 
  it would be like reading animal farm and just thinking it 's a story about a bunch of roudy pets . 
  a fun story , but totally not worthy of study . 
  honestly the only part of that which sounded ignorant was calling the crucible , which is a play , a book . 
  but on a serious note , i can totally get it . 
  personally , i really liked it . 
  definitely not one of my favourites , but i thought it was a good story with some great imagery . 
  but it 's really just personal taste , and of course not everyone likes the same things . 
  that 's why i specified wind , to exclude brass ( specifically trombone ) and strings ( mainly orchestral ) . 
  though oddly enough , the most common definition for ccw , counter clockwise , did n't show up there either . 
  honestly , i 'd recommend the ps4 . 
  it 's worth it for no reason other than last of us . 
  everything else ( for example , uncharted , little big planet , and infamous , for example ) is only an increased incentive to go with it . 
  i 'd be happy to shut down neighbours . 
  that show has gone on for way too long . 
  unfortunately for you , that 's not what your government believes . 
  i 'm on mobile right now , so it 's hard for me to find . 
  go through my link submission history and ctrl/cmd-f ozzmar to find it . 
  i 'll edit this post with a link when i get to a computer . 
  edit : [ here 's part 1 for anyone that wants it ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dbrc7/ozzmarr _ the_broliest_paladinbarbarian_ever / ), 
  there 's actually a term for this : `` lie-to-children '' . 
  it 's very common in even formal science education . 
  for example , early highschool physics/chemistry describes electrons like little spheres of negativity that `` orbit '' the nucleus , like planets orbit a star , while later on in highschool and then at a university level , you learn about things such as the electron-in-a-box model . 
  [ here 's the comment thread from til ] ( / r/todayilearned/comments / 2le5to/til _ guy_fawkes_is_the_reason_we_call_guys_guys / ) . 
  another fun apple codeword story :, 
  there is a default sound included in os x today called sosumi . 
  the sound 's creator originally wanted to call it `` let it beep '' , but lawyers told him he had to change it . 
  while thinking of names , he got angry at having to change it , and thought `` so sue me '' . 
  he realised that `` so sue me '' could sound kinda japanese , so he changed the spelling to reflect that , and so sosumi was born . 
  [ here 's a video with the guy that created that sound ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qktwnerh1g8 ) , as well as many other apple sounds , like the startup chime , in which he explains the above story , amongst others . 
   every week there are two, 
  sorry buddy , but you 're only getting a small fraction of them . 
  google results are customised based on your interests . 
  i did actually get [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ccw ) . 
  it appeared below the bottom result of the second image and above the top image in the first image . 
  but on that page , there is a link to [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concealed_carry ) . 
  concealed carry is really only a thing in the us , so someone outside america , especially someone with no interest in guns , is n't going to see that link . 
  while an american , particularly a gun-nut , will see that kind of thing . 
  honestly , i 'm more surprised that i * did n't * see a result telling me it stands for counter clockwise . 
  just starting season 3 of arrow or chuck ? 
  `` guards , do the thing '' - zhu li lok, 
  honestly , considering how much it focused on the tech stuff this episode , i thought it did pretty well . 
  its technobabble is normally bad , and this was no exception , but i do n't think it was any worse than normal , which to me means it did very well , given the focus of the episode . 
  wow awesome !, 
  thanks !, 
   the clarinet is the only wood wind to operate in a `` register '' of 12 notes, 
  the reason for this in physics is that the clarinet can be modelled as a pipe open at one end at closed at the other . 
  all other wind instruments are open at both ends . 
  ( do n't ask me why , i do n't know . ), 
  this basically means that the clarinet skips every second overtone . 
  you have the fundamental , which is the note actually being fingered . 
  the next overtone is an octave , then a fifth above that , then a fourth above that ( 2 octaves above the fundamental ) , then a third above that , etc. 
  the clarinet skips the first overtone ( the octave ) and the third overtone ( 2nd octave ) . 
   the mozart clarinet concerto was one of the last pieces he wrote . 
  he did it at the request of anton stadler, 
  it was actually * the * last instrumental piece he finished . 
  stadler is also the person he wrote his clarinet quintet for . 
   the clarient it was originally written for was keyed in a and could play down to a c tow [ sic ] octaves below the staff, 
  the term used to describe this clarinet is a `` basset '' clarinet . 
   today , the two clarinets that have survived and thrived are the b-flat and a, 
  which is also the reason that some b-flat clarinets today have an extra e-flat key . 
  it enables them to reach a semi-tone lower , to reach the same bottom note ( in concert pitch ) as the a clarinet . 
   bands often soundmbest [ sic ] in flat keys and ... orchestras sound best in sharp keys, 
  not exactly . 
  it 's more that the instruments tend to find it easier to play in these keys . 
   the clarinet was the original jass [ sic ] woodwind , way before the sax, 
  this is one of my favourite facts , and i feel not a lot of people appreciate this . 
  the clarinet can be an absolutely * fantastic * jazz instrument . 
  it does n't really work in a big band ( unless it 's in a concerto-like situation , with clarinet solo and big band accompaniment ) , but in smaller 5-piece jazz bands it 's awesome . 
  just thought i 'd add a few little titbits ( and one minor correction ) to your absolutely excellent post . 
  just realised . 
  you accidentally got my username wrong . 
  / u/zagaroth is a real user ( and does , in fact , play dnd ) , but someone completely different . 
  it 's actually a running joke in my party that they always get my name wrong , so it 's actually kinda cool !, 
  it 's happened once or twice . 
  i 'm also confused , but hey , i got a dollar out of it , so i 'm not complaining . 
  i suppose if you think about it , this makes more sense than giving gold , since the user receiving it can then decide exactly what they want to do with it , similar to how cash is always nicer to get than gift vouchers . 
  awesome , thanks !, 
  this is actually the second time in about a week that i 've gotten tips from changetip . 
  is it a relatively new service or something ? 
  oh right . 
  yeah , i watched the video a while ago , so i forgot the details . 
  probably should have re-watched it before posting , but ah well .
