  wait what . 
  the bot actually knows how much `` 1 limited edition satoshi nakamoto action figure '' is worth and will recognise that ? 
  i 'm here because of the meta bot ( it was me that he tipped ) . 
  he gave $ 1 , which i think is just awesome . 
  no negativity from me . 
  as i said in a comment in the linked thread , i see it as no different to gifting gold , except that the recipient can use it as they wish , rather than it being spent automatically on a fixed thing . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , i saw / u/parsnipcommander 's comments in the linked thread , and thought he was going around making fun of bitcoin users by it . 
  i did n't realise it actually was giving any real money , until i saw the changetip bot reply to one of them . 
  i got an eharmony ad for it . 
  a fucking online * dating * ad on a video titled `` chimp rapes frog 's mouth '' . 
  i really do not thing they wanted that association . 
  jobs did n't work at apple between 1984 and 1997 . 
  yeah honestly , all those tips sound really good . 
  tipping $ 1 at a minimum , and avoiding going on tipping sprees , are particularly useful if people want to be taken seriously . 
  i might also suggest * not * doing the `` private '' thing , because having the comment in the thread helps other people understand what was going on . 
  the exception to this would be if you * really * want to make a second tip in the same thread . 
  haha that 's actually really clever . 
  / * make this text hard to read * /, 
  is how i imagine it going . 
  yeah , all you have to do is go see any android fan forum/group shortly after an apple announcement/release . 
  it kinda makes me ashamed to be an android user . 
  seriously . 
  * especially * because he 's a scientist , we should n't hold this idea that because he was a brilliant man in one field , he can do no wrong . 
  the whole of science is founded on the idea that people 's previous notions can be wrong . 
  no scientist would be glad to have had himself validated in something he did in his private life just because he 's made contributions to science . 
  holy fuck . 
  if that 's true he really was a massive arsehole . 
  got a source on it ? 
  if he did n't want to , he could have easily just said `` no thank you '' , or even ignored it completely . 
  no need to get his agent to send a legal notice about it . 
  ah , well that significantly changes things . 
  thanks for the extra detail . 
  once you 're caught up , join us on / r/chuck and share your feelings on the show !, 
  no scale could reasonably pick up the difference between two different optical disks . 
  there are too many other variables . 
  a bit of dust getting in the case could have as much of a difference . 
   post jobs pre jobs era, 
  i prefer to call it the `` inter-jobs era '' . 
  i 'm not sure he was angry at the lawyers so much as the message that the lawyers had to deliver . 
  what course are you taking that you 're studying bitcoin in ? 
  i should be studying for a stats final exam right now ... not nearly as interesting . 
  your penis is stuck in 2007 ? 
  that 's an interesting design choice , 
  in all seriousness , i just checked it myself . 
  wow , i really do n't get why they do that . 
  they have n't even done it with all their css . 
  [ this page , for example ] ( http://images.apple.com/au/iphone-6/overview/styles/overview.css ) has a few comments on it , and is laid out relatively nicely . 
  it 's not like it makes it that much harder to read . 
  an automated parser could get it into readable format . 
  but anyway , this is the relevant information that i saw :, 
  color : # 999, 
  color : # 666, 
  line-height : 1.3333 ;, 
  i know the semicolons are n't necessary on the last attribute , but it still bothers me that they left them out ... 
  well , either a comma or a curly bracket , depending on context , 
  the fact that bha stood for butt-head astronomer was not official . 
  kinda like how the apple lisa officially stood for local integrated system architecture , and never officially referred to jobs ' daughter ( who , at the time , he denied was his ) . 
  really ? 
  because it sounds to me like they were entirely in the right throughout this process . 
  they had an unofficial codename for a product that was named after him , which he demanded be changed . 
  they changed it to `` bha '' which unofficially stood for `` butt-head astronomer '' ( so we 're at two abstractions of unofficiality ) , for which he sued . 
  and as they said , anyone who knew not only the codename , but what it stood for , would already know enough about the whole situation to be able to take it with humour , and know that it is not libel . 
  remember , libel is n't just saying bad things about a person , it 's things that could actually harm the person 's reputation . 
  yes , thank you . 
  someone already posted that 3 hours ago . 
  i responded to it last time it was posted ... 
  i feel like guns should be involved in this saying somehow . 
  do n't fire at delivery boys ? 
  nah , that does n't quite do it . 
  haha no worries . 
  i right , i was on [ this page ] ( http://images.apple.com/v/iphone-6/a/styles/iphone-6.built.css ) . 
  interestingly , just now , i checked [ this page ] ( http://images.apple.com/anzsea/v/imac-with-retina/a/styles/imac-with-retina.built.css ) . 
  it also gives font size in pixels , like the page you found . 
  weird that they 'd flip between the two like that . 
  it was an * internal * codename . 
  it was never meant to be official . 
  if it had been , they would have had reasonable grounds to take legal action . 
  you 're not wrong about john sculley at all , but apple reached an agreement with the beatles and apple records . 
  i really do n't see how creating a programming language called `` dylan '' ( which stands for dynamic language ) . 
  it could just have easily been named after [ any of these people ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dylan_ ( name \\ ) ) , or just been generically named after the welsh name `` dylan '' . 
  suing for that is about as reasonable as apple 's current lawsuit against a polish online grocery story for the name a.pl ( which i also do not think is a reasonable law suit ) . 
  the dylan case was also settled out of court . 
  but apple did n't lose the suit against sagan . 
  it was initially thrown out of court , and then when he appealed it was , again , settled out of court . 
  being unofficial means that it can not possibly be libelous , because it can not in any way have an impact on his reputation . 
  the name was never official . 
  never intended to be used in marketing or by any consumers of the product . 
  that 's the key difference . 
  if they 've never officially stated that they named this product after him , let alone that they later renamed it `` butt head astronomer '' , then it is not in the least bit libelous . 
  you totally moved the goalposts here mate . 
  that said , if you and your mates want to name some product you make , even if it 's shitty , the zagorath for purely internal purposes , then go ahead . 
  it 's only if you name it that in advertising or somewhere else that its end consumers see it that i 'll have any issue . 
  jobs definitely was an absolute arsehole , but he was neither a liar nor a thief . 
  he had so much charisma and ( later on ) power that he could get away with his shittyness entirely above board . 
  that said , he had exactly * nothing * to do with this situation . 
  he had n't worked at apple for 10 years , and would n't again for another 3 . 
  haha yeah , so did yours . 
  tell ya what , the effect definitely works better with more characters . 
  why the scare quotes on ` see ' ? 
  right , but the point is that bha was the product codename .
