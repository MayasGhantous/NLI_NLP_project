  roku was born and grew up in a peaceful fire nation . 
  if he had been born at a time when the fire nation was involved in conquering the world , and the fire lord was on the lookout for the next fire avatar to raise as part of the firenation 's army , then things could have turned out * very * differently . 
  your point ? 
  even ( n ) spooky ( n +2 ) me only works for one particular value of n . the joke is that people try to raise the stakes by using larger values of n ( e.g. 
  ah , thanks for the clarification . 
  though i would probably recommend against shortening that particular one . 
  ah cheers . 
  yeah , i know i could have done that , but it 's so much easier to write three words than to copy the image url , go to images.google.com , select the right option , an paste the url in . 
  especially when the other person presumably already knows the answer , and so would only have to write a few words in response . 
  they literally ** just ** brought them to fight against an entire * city * of such opponents . 
  it would n't make sense to have them if they were made out of normal metal . 
  seriously . 
  there are heaps of shows that i watch and i think they 're much better shows . 
  but nothing -- ** nothing ** -- has ever had as much of an emotional impact on me as chuck did . 
  personally i think [ numberphile 's video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83ofi_l6eao ) on the topic is much more informative . 
  at a higher level of maths it has no benefit . 
  where it 's useful is in teaching . 
  i know i had a heap of trouble learning things like sin and cos values until i heard about tau , and it suddenly all clicked . 
  it 's actually a small allusion to the uk show , where francis urquhart is often known as fu by both his detractors and his allies . 
  agree completely . 
  most of the time when i watch a us remake of a uk show , i 'm tempted to try and decide which one i like more . 
  not so with this one . 
  they 're both just so beautiful , but very different . 
  i have to say , having watched the uk version after seeing the us one , i feel my understanding of the us version is so much better now . 
  the shakespearean nature of the narrative is much more obvious in the uk version ( which kinda made the ending inevitable in hindsight , even though i know i never predicted it ) , but having recognised it from the uk version , i can now clearly see it in the us one , as well . 
  which fans are those ? 
  i know i definitely do n't see it as an indictment of current politics . 
  heck , it 's based of a uk show from the 90s which was in turn based off of a novel from the late 80s . 
   ptsd is simply one of many different responses to the incredible stress of coming face to face with death, 
  umm ... no . 
  it can be the result of * any * traumatic stress . 
  sure , that 's very , * very * often the stress of coming close to death , but it does n't have to be . 
  that 's why it 's post traumatic stress disorder , and not post near-death experience disorder . 
  the max size increase was from 1 mb to 1.75 mb . 
  it 's still abysmally small , even if the percentage increase was pretty significant . 
  i 'm disappointed that it 's actually press square , when the op had press x. 
  it 's actually `` search google for this image '' , but thanks , i did n't realise that was a thing . 
  edit : though it did n't actually help . 
  it looks like in this case the image has been used in too many places that do n't directly explain the answer , anyway .

  * ( brackets ), 
  * [ square brackets ], 
  * { curly brackets/braces }, 
  * \\ who the fuck ** does n't ** call these slashes ? /, 
  to me . 
  different people call them different things . 
  `` we all do '' is just wrong . 
  i came across someone the other day that { called these set brackets } , if my memory is correct . 
  edit : actually , just remembered . 
  in britain most people call ' / ' `` stroke '' . 
  huh ? 
  azerty is n't in alphabetical order , it 's a different keyboard layout based on qwerty that 's used in france and french belgium . 
  the top row goes azertyuiop . 
  i 'll just rewrite the second half of that comment without the unicode characters , so that anyone for whom they do n't display correctly can still read it . 
   think of all the * pi * / 2 's we could avoid writing if we used * eta * = * pi * / 2 in mathematics instead of pi . 
  yes , there would be 2 * eta * 's in equations where there used to be * pi 's , but that 's not really much worse . 
  i would much rather multiply than divide . 
  ( this is the exact same rationale people give for using pi instead of tau , so if it applies there , it applies here . ), 
  if we went even smaller and used a symbol to represent 1/24 of tau , we could eliminate the fractions in all the `` standard '' angles like * pi * / 6 ( 30 \u00b0 ) , * pi * / 4 ( 45 \u00b0 ) , * pi * / 2 ( 90 \u00b0 ) , and 2 * pi * / 3 ( 120 \u00b0 ) . 
  by the way , it 's been way too long since i 've seen you bringing up tau in your comments . 
  glad to see you 're back at it . 
  basically nobody in my country calls them parentheses . 
  ah interesting . 
  i would only use chevron to refer to the double < < that the french use for quotations ( but that 's mainly because i can never remember their proper name , `` guillemet '' ) . 
  i 'm curious , when describing file locations in windows , do you refer to the backslash as an escape ? 
  university of queensland . 
  with no evidence here supporting either argument , i feel that the default assumption should be the simpler explanation , which is that by pirating , people are able to decide if they like it and want to buy it , where otherwise they would just avoid it . 
  of course , if anyone actually has any data on this , i 'd be really interested in seeing it . 
  if not , well then this seems like an interesting idea for a study . 
  oh man , imagine if steam implemented a google play-like refund scheme . 
  if they gave you one hour 's worth of playtime during which you could remove the game and ask for a refund , no questions asked . 
  the same is true in australia . 
  i do n't know what he 's on about . 
  but here 's the thing , we * do * know that people who pirate things tend to also spend more on content . 
  there 's data to reach that conclusion . 
  the question is * why * that is . 
  i 'm just offering what seems like the most obvious solution to that . 
  huh . 
  i did n't know that they did . 
  really , origin is a much better platform in just about every respect than steam is . 
  its only real disadvantage is the range of content it has . 
  a much nicer ui , it does n't have all that social crap that steam throws at you , and now i learn they have a decent refund system . 
  yeah a few of the marvel films have come out worldwide ages before the us . 
  i got really confused when americans on reddit were posting all this iron man 3 content , and i was just thinking ... this came out like two weeks ago . 
  the last few have n't kept up with that , and have tended to be same day releases ( meaning europe gets it a few hours earlier than the us , while australia gets it almost a day earlier ) . 
   the great game guarantee allows you to return ea digital game downloads ( pc/mac ) purchased on origin for a full refund within 24 hours after you first launch the game , within seven days from your date of purchase or within seven days from the game 's release date if you pre-purchased/pre-ordered , whichever comes first . 
  [ from here ] ( http://help.ea.com/au/article/returns-and-cancellations/ ) . 
  however , [ this only applies to ea base games ] ( https://www.origin.com/en-au/great-game-guarantee ) . 
  no dlc or third party games . 
  i did n't know who richard ayoade was until i read this comment . 
  then i went back and reread it in his voice . 
  it greatly improved the experience . 
  have you got reddit set to always use ssl ? 
  i wonder if that changes anything ? 
  ( and if you do n't have it set , you really should . 
  there is n't any disadvantage to it , and it prevents people snooping on what you 're doing . ), 
  eh , i get that ea has some scummy business practices , but i 'd rather encourage their good ones , whilst discouraging the bad ones , by buying games on their superior platform , but never buying ` content ' dlc from them , or buying significantly nerfed games ( like the latest sims and sim city games were ) . 
  i say this entirely hypocritically . 
  the only games i own on origin are the ones i got through the origin humble bundle ( and one or two they gave away for free ) . 
  but i do very rarely buy any games at all , i could probably also count the number of purchases i 've made on steam on two hands .
