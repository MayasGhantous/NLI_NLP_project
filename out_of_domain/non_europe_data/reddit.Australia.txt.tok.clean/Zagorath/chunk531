  also , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnamese_name#family_name ) . 
  \\ # 1 was pretty easy to spot in brisbane this past weekend . 
  it 's probably better advice to replace the ` then do the `` ye '' in `` yes '' but with your lips rounded ... ' part with ` then just make a `` we '' sound ( where the `` e '' there is the same as the e in `` yes '' ) ' . 
  perhaps not * quite * as accurate , but pronouncing it that way will impress the vietnamese enough to make them think you know how it 's pronounced . 
  if he 's saying it 's pronounced with two syllables , that is * extremely * unusual . 
  is he actually vietnamese , or a second generation immigrant from vietnam ? 
  the actual name in vietnam is always pronounced with one syllable , as indicated by the fact that it 's a single `` word '' ( in vietnamese , all things that would be identified as a single word in other language using the latin alphabet are monosyllabic ) . 
  yu-gi-oh is ( kinda ) a polite way to say `` here '' or `` come here '' in korean . 
  some portuguese monks in the area were the first to transliterate vietnamese from the older chinese script , so that they could communicate with people back home . 
  however , when the french came in and colonialised the area , they were the ones who formalised it all . 
  as for why they did it exactly how they did , i really do n't know . 
  is there any relation between the two ? 
  a particular reason that wights are starting to be a threat at the same time the others are reappearing ? 
  for reference , the quote comes at around 54:00 in that video . 
  the whole thing is worth watching , but even if you just have a few minutes , that bit of it is totally worth watching on its own . 
  just lived/grew up there . 
  i 'm as white as can be . 
  do the others have to physically go to a dead body to raise it as a wight ? 
  or is it just something about their presence in the world that causes it ? 
  it seems more likely to me that it would be the latter , since that makes it far easier to explain how the wights appeared at castle black , but i 'm not sure . 
  yeah i 've thought that since the reveal last episode . 
  my only explanation for it is that it represented the total domination that they had . 
  what i did n't get is why he bought the mobile gamers new computers so soon before announcing he was gon na close down the school entirely . 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
   wights are the thrills of the others, 
  haha that autocorrect mistake had me stumped for a few seconds there . 
  alternatively , i would have liked to see the two of them fighting side-by-side being awesome . 
  it would have made a nice contrast to the first season , and i think it would have provided great closure to their relationship . 
  this is what really disappoints me . 
  i used to live overseas , and my family still does . 
  the australia channel was run by the abc , and it was absolutely fantastic . 
  best place to get australian news , as well as showing a bunch of aussie shows ( they had deals with the other local channels and showed some of their content ) and sport . 
  thanks to the cuts , they 've had to completely drop the channel . 
  now there 's no way ( save for piracy ) to get that sort of content if you do n't live in australia . 
   although by the end of the 1950s television had expanded to also include brisbane , adelaide and perth , it was estimated that less than 5 % of the residents in melbourne , and fewer than 1 % in sydney owned a television set , which at the time cost , on average , six to ten weeks ' wages . 
  during these early years broadcast days were very short -- all stations including the abc only broadcast programs for a few hours each day and broadcast the test pattern for the rest of the time they were on air . 
  broadcast times were gradually increased over succeeding decades , although the abc did not commence 24-hour broadcasting until 1993 . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/television_in_australia ), 
  it is n't quite clear , but it seems to me that it implies that in 1993 the other channels had already begun broadcasting 24/7 . 
  yeah that really confused me . 
  i guess he probably meant `` the equivalent of a couple of hundred aussie dollars in bitcoin '' , but the comment definitely made it look like he 's gon na donate a couple hundred bitcoin . 
  a vpn located in australia would also have exactly the same problem with being filtered , anyway . 
  so if you did pay for one , they 'd probably just be linking out to another service elsewhere in the world . 
  you 'd be paying the middle-man for access to something that would be just as easy to pay for directly . 
  this sort of stuff makes me extremely glad to have family overseas . 
  gon na set up a seedbox of my own when i 'm there over chrissy , just so i 'll be safe in the event this stuff goes through . 
  makes sense . 
  i support this just because i 'm so sick of slyfox et al and their korrasami shit that everyone seems to be eating up . 
  wow that was incredible . 
  just ... an absolutely stunning film . 
  would you mind if i shared the link with some friends ? 
  most people restrict their video to one platform . 
  maybe two , if you 're lucky . 
  what specifically is your problem with vimeo , because although you 're trying to pretend to take the high road by talking about op `` restricting it '' , you clearly just have some irrational problem with vimeo specifically . 
   kill all th unncssary '' `` s !!, 
  much bttr, 
  central america is n't a continent under * any * definition . 
  most people consider north and south america two continents , and in that case they generally consider most of central america part of the north american continent . 
  it 's worth noting , though , that most people in latin america consider all of the americas a single continent . 
  an interesting theory , but vietnamese does n't really have unneccesary letters . 
  it 's actually surprisingly phonetic , if you do n't mind all the absurdly difficult accents , which , while difficult to learn and impossible to hear the difference between when spoken in a sentence ( if you 're untrained ) , do actually follow very set rules . 
  you never get words like `` mangeaient , mangeait , mangeais '' , which are all pronounced the same . 
  there 's also the fact that a hell of a lot of people * do * pronounce the n in government . 
  it 's like the first ` r ' in library . 
  [ but vimeo videos can be embedded just as well as youtube ones can . 
  ] ( http://vimeo.com/help/faq/sharing-videos/embedding-videos ) it 's not his fault reddit/res does n't support it properly . 
  vimeo is a far better platform for this kind of thing than its only real competitor , youtube , because it does n't cause nearly the same level of visual artifacting in its attempt to compress videos . 
  and anyway , reddit is a content sharing and voting site . 
  people vote on what they want to see , and in this case they liked his video enough to upvote it . 
  if you do n't want to vote , do n't . 
  if you do n't want it here at all , then downvote and move on . 
  do n't go on some self-righteous crusade complaining about the site the video was uploaded to . 
  since we 're on the topic , i feel i should point out that rogues can be kind . 
  it 's actually a * fuckload * easier on chrome than it is in firefox . 
  just go to settings , and click `` manage search engines '' . 
  then near the bottom there should be `` add a new search engine '' . 
  give it a name there , set keyword to `` r '' , and the url to ` reddit.com/r/%s` . 
  you tricky fucker !, 
  you could do that without the sidebar thing , though . 
  just head to / r/subredditone + subreddittwo, 
  for example , / r/aww + awwducational , so you do n't have to switch between them mid-fap . 
  wait , what ? 
  i must admit , i 'm rather surprised that none of this thread got gold . 
  usually they would have . 
  it 's not like they 're the only place in the world that does this . 
  the only emails i 've ever gotten from gmail are when i first created my account and when i recently got onto inbox . 
  and , as much as i am loathe to say they did anything right , the same is more or less true of facebook . 
  the only one i think i 've ever gotten was to first create the account . 
  the default dvorak layout is n't great for programming in languages with c 's syntax . 
  i use my own customised version of the [ programmer dvorak ] ( http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/ ) layout . 
  [ this is what it looks like ] ( http://imgur.com/kbd99xg ) on the first level , and [ this shows both first level and second level ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fxxvjqm.png ) , ( when shift is held down ) . 
  note that in the second image the top row is misaligned thanks to the weird placement of the ` esc ` key on windows ' on-screen keyboard . 
  it has the advantage of keeping numbers in the correct order , while still putting brackets , square brackets , and braces in more easily-reached locations than standard dvorak . 
  to create a custom layout on os x , i used [ ukelele ] ( http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=ukelele ) , and on windows i used [ keyboard layout manager ] ( http://www.klm32.com/ ) ( which was much less friendly to use , but did still work in the end ) . 
  i still use the normal dvorak when not programming , and just switch over to my coding dvorak layout when programming . 
  i got 40 gb of space on copy . 
  combined with my 11.4 gb on dropbox and 15 gb on google drive , the only things i * do n't * have backed up are pirated movies and tv shows that i do n't care about much anyway .
