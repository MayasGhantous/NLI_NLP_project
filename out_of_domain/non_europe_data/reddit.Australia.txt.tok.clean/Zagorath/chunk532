  on the matter of copy , i have no idea how they stay in business , but they give 5 gb extra per referral , and you start with something like 15 or 20 gb , i think . 
  they also do shared files by counting each item as only a fraction based on how many people it 's been shared to . 
  [ here 's my referal link , if you want to try it out ] ( https://copy.com?r=upfrdn ) . 
  i do n't really know about his description above . 
  i tried firefox again ( after a few years ' of using chrome exclusively ) last month , and after 3 or 4 weeks i just had to give up , because there were too many frustrations , one of which was creating these sorts of custom searches . 
  the only way i could figure out to do it involved going to a site specifically for custom searches , entering some data into it , and then going to firefox 's awful search bar ( seriously , how the hell have they still got that ... all the other major browsers have gotten rid of them ) and clicking something to add it . 
  the above description seems to be a weird workaround that forces you to add the site as a bookmark with a variable in it . 
  even then , if you want to actually * use * the feature , firefox gives you no feedback that it 's going to work correctly until you actually hit enter . 
  it just looks as though you had typed `` r askreddit '' into the browser , whereas on chrome after you type `` r '' , it switches to an indication that it 's about to search reddit . 
  there 's also the fact that it adds sites to search * automatically * with the keyword being their domain , so you can use them with no setup , or can easily just add a keyword of your choosing . 
  because you need to be on reddit to do that ... 
  i typically open a new tab , type `` r askreddit '' , and hit enter . 
  all of that can be done extremely quickly without needing to move my hands around , regardless of whether i 'm currently on a reddit tab or not . 
  i have n't bought a game from ubisoft since i bought a version of age of mythology published by them ( after my old copy 's cd , an original microsoft published one , broke ) came with a warning in fine print on the back of the box that it does n't support online play . 
  fuck you ubisoft , why would i even bother paying for the fucking game if i only wanted single player . 
  since then , i 've pirated a few ubisoft games , but i refuse to ever pay for their shit again . 
  the aussie shoulda put `` get fucked '' in bold just to fuck with the guy . 
  that 's youtube . 
  [ here 's the original link in / r/screenshots ] ( / r/screenshots/comments / 2mlm0c/nsfw / ) . 
  yeah you can rebind any of them in any combination you like . 
  i do n't know how to do anything more complicated than putting characters on a specific key , or a specific key after pressing shift ( like doing complicated things with alt-gr , or using combination 's like apple 's option-i + e giving \u00ea ) , but for basic rebinding you can do it in absolutely any way you want to , and it 's really easy . 
  reminds me of a less noble version of [ of gay marriage , kings , and democracy ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2179br/of _ gay_marriage_kings_and_democracy / ) . 
  holy shit man , i thought my 8 day watch was impressive . 
  granted , i did it during uni ( though near the start of semester ) , but still ... 
  there are a bunch of extra material things that you can watch . 
  that 's the first thing i did after finishing . 
  [ check here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_chuck_episodes#web-based_spin-offs ) . 
  plus there are some great cast interviews and bloopers out there . 
  i pronounce both of them exactly as written . 
  the pronunciation of library as `` libary '' kinda bothers me , though `` libry '' really does n't . 
  i tend to prefer sarranid mamlukes . 
  i do n't know about now , but at the time i bought it , it definitely was n't . 
  this was in 2007 , * maybe * 2008 , and the online community was still very active . 
  i know this because it was great when i was playing it right up until my disk stopped working . 
  but that 'll be taking you to https://reddit.com/search?q=%s&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all , or some similar page . 
  we 're not talking about actually searching reddit , but going to a specific subreddit page . 
  if i type `` r '' ( or `` r '' , and then press tab , the two are equivalent ) , and then type `` askreddit '' , it will take me to reddit.com/r/askreddit . 
  that would explain why so many russian names end in ov or ( for females ) ova . 
  i never made that connection , thanks !, 
  who 's that ? 
  it 's also known as `` draughts '' , particularly in commonwealth countries , if that helps . 
  more recently , yes , but not at the time . 
  canada is often an exception to the commonwealth . 
  i never know when they side with the english and when they side with the us . 
  haha yeah , i 'm aware of - son , o ' - , and mac - . 
  i do n't really know whether that would have worked or not , but in hindsight , yeah , that would have been the smart thing to do . 
  still , the game 's been relaunched with a new online service on steam . 
  once it goes on sale for a sufficiently low price i 'm gon na pick it up again . 
  should be fun . 
  i would just say , as an australian , even the english seem to me to be inexplicable stuck in the past . 
  how frequently they use miles in driving , feet for height , and even * stones * for weight . 
  it 's absolutely absurd . 
  when we switched over , we just did it , bang . 
  one day it was in imperial units , the next everything was required to be in metric . 
  and by god has it been beneficial in the long run , even if people at the time may not have liked it or may have found it difficult/confusing . 
  oh wow that 's awesome !, 
  i never knew that was there . 
  nah do n't worry . 
  embedding ca n't be done properly on reddit . 
  you did it pretty much exactly how you should have . 
  perhaps making it a link post and asking people to vote in a comment might have been better , but the difference is n't so much that anyone should get worked up about it . 
  i mean , that 's definitely true of the original trilogy , but how true is it in the prequels ? 
  the lava river on mustafar looked pretty damn awesome , but i 'll be very surprised if someone tells me that was n't cgi . 
  how good has jake lloyd been in other films ? 
  edit : never mind , i looked it up . 
  he 's only been in a very small number of films , and only one that was released after phantom menace , [ madison ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/madison_\\ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  that movie had an interesting history . 
  it was filmed and produced in 2000-2001 , but did n't actually get released until 2005 , for ( at least as far as wikipedia is saying ) no apparent reason . 
  it does stand as the last film produced by mgm as an independent company , so that 's rather interesting . 
  back on [ lloyd ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jake_lloyd ) , he apparently `` cited that george lucas ruined his childhood and his acting career , thus he burned all of his star wars memorabilia '' . 
  ouch . 
   he could on a whim make you say imma fat fat tuna and moonwalk indefinitely into a wall until you died of dehydration, 
  right now i want nothing more than to see that . 
  [ darths and droids ] ( http://www.darthsanddroids.net/ ) is such a brilliant comic . 
  i remember when i first found it , they were only about half way through episode ii . 
  i think i binged through it in about a month . 
  for anyone not familiar , the premise is that it 's a modern day earth in a world where star wars was never created . 
  some roleplayers are playing a dnd-like game , and basically end up playing out the star wars storyline . 
  ninjaedit : [ episode 1 ] ( http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html ), 
   attack of the clones : boring , but best music of the series . 
  ftfy . 
  as much as the anakin/padme romance may have sucked , by god if i did n't love across the stars . 
  plus , the hinting at darth vader 's theme was awesome , especially right at the end of the credits in just the contrabassi . 
   did i say `` alarmed ? '', 
  i meant `` relieved . '', 
  oh interesting . 
  i did n't realise mods could edit people 's comments , 
  op mentioned 3 20s . 
  the chance of rolling any specific permutation of three d20s is 1/8000 , or 0.0125 % . 
  yes , that 's extremely low , but let 's be realistic , the amount of people playing dnd , it 's * bound * to come up from time to time . 
  given that , it 's also bound to at least sometimes happen when the group in question is doing awesome things , worthy of a story . 
  nope . 
  the serial copy that was attached to the game was one that would not allow you to sign on to online play , even with an account you already had . 
  also on that list : free healthcare and affordable tertiary education . 
  wait ... 
  definitely not an instant sign up for me , as a poor uni student , but i 'll be keeping a close look at what 's available on it here , and if it 's good enough , i may very well sign up . 
  mean is one type of average . 
  the thing you described as `` average '' , i.e. , ( sum ( x_i ) , from i = 1 to n ) / n is , in fact , the mean . 
  another type of average is the median , which is what you described as `` mean '' . 
  it 's the middle number , or half way between the two middle numbers if the sample size is even .
