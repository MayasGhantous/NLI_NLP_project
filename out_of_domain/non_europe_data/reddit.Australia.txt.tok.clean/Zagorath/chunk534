  [ the reason for the stereotype is that it 's true ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2228rank.html ) . 
  a full third of american adults are obese . 
  you 're far from the worst in the world , but of the developed western nations , your rate does stand out significantly . 
  the uk , germany , and australia are all around the mid 20 % mark , and france is as low as 18 % . 
  your anecdotal evidence is just that , no more than an anecdote . 
  the smudging issue is big , but there 's also the fact that normal fountain pens work really poorly for lefties , especially ones who use the hook-handed technique . 
  i did n't want to have to pay more for a specialised lefty fountain pen , and i 've tried in the past to not go hook handed , but i 've never been able to . 
  since i 'm more ambidextrous than sinistral , it worked out being easier to start learning to write with my right hand from scratch than to try to override 20 years of writing with my left hand in a particular manner . 
  what am i missing here ? 
  yes , you do . 
  the end of the opening episode of season 2 , and the end of the last episode , are some of the most brilliant moments in television . 
  i would absolutely love to hear more about this character , if you could . 
  / r/dndgreentext would be a great place to share the story , too . 
  it 's not a movie , it 's a tv show produced by netflix called house of cards , based on a uk show by the same name , which was based on some books by the same name . 
  i 'd heartily recommend watching it . 
  it 's perhaps one of the best shows out there . 
  if by `` from 2008 '' you mean `` is using the most highly up-to-date accurate data available '' and by `` the cia website '' you mean `` one of the most trusted sources of worldwide demographic information '' , then yes , you 're absolutely right . 
  i must be , someone else , i must be , batman, 
  at that point in the intro ? 
  i 'd also like to see a guest appearence by zach levi with the same line .

  ( or whatever the correct syntax is ) does n't have quite the same ring to it , i suspect . 
  ai n't no fs in octal . 
  or 8s , 9s , as , etc. 
  something something my python is swift . 
  so , i 'm guessing you intended this to be for anyone studying any bachelor degree , but that 's not what you 've written . 
  there are plenty of degrees other than bachelor of arts and bachelor of science , and strictly speaking people studying one of those have no accurate answer to that question . 
  would it not have made more sense ( and , frankly , been simpler ) to put `` bachelor student '' , or `` undergraduate student '' ? 
  part 3 is out already ? 
  damn , got ta grab myself a copy !, 
  i know a few people who have had chemo that are alive at the moment . 
  oh man that 's genius !, 
  how did i not make the connection during the show, 
  i actually think it was a deliberate chuck reference . 
  it certainly would n't be the first time they 've done it this season , and the idea of breaking your thumbs to get out of hand cuffs was a minor recurring joke on chuck . 
  someone needs to edit this with the arrow symbol :, 
  nothing flies over his head . 
  his reflexes are too fast , he would catch it . 
  it still reeks of stalker city to me , but maybe that 's just the chuck fan in me speaking . 
   invincible unless around kryptonite, 
  except when plot demands it . 
  see : the end of superman returns . 
  god that was inconsistent . 
  there 're at least 2 . 
  people who do n't believe in global warming run my country . 
  actually it 's the opposite . 
  they have to pretend they believe in it for political reasons , whilst paying lip service to doing things to help . 
  but at the same time , undoing what previous governments did to * actually * help . 
   i thought it was because changing the name of the company was the final nail in the queen legacy, 
  yeah , i 'm really surprised that they did n't do more with that . 
  definitely agree . 
  i was hugely into it last season , but everything between the two of them this season has seemed really forced . 
  i 'm not entirely sure arrow is really the best show to use for an ia . 
  but if you 're set on using it , i 'd pick some scene where ollie is struggling with the morals of whether or not to kill someone . 
  perhaps the scene where he kills count vertigo . 
  for a comic book show that personally i think would be better than arrow for this , the struggles m'gann goes through in young justice season 2 might be a little better . 
  but i do n't really know , the furthest i 've ever gone into philosophy was tok . 
  that 's easy . 
  korra , of course , because it 's 20 minutes long . 
  once you get into the game , you 're gon na have a hard time stopping . 
  i like to pretend * every * time someone talks about korrasami they 're being sarcastic . 
   not quite * the brief history of time , * though , is it ? 
  seems better to me , if we 're being pedantic . 
  know what you 're gon na do your ee in ? 
  also , your username feels like it 's lying to me . 
  i suspect it had a lot to do with the lack of marketability of merchandise for the show . 
  that 's supposedly what did young justice in ; they just were n't selling toys . 
  it was just last year that cn cut young justice . 
   never let the truth get in the way of a good story . 
  this perfectly summarises you , slyfox . 
  except that it 's not a good story , it 's really fucking tiring . 
  oh thank god . 
  i was beginning to think i was the only one that did n't like those stupid anime-like faces . 
  seriously , if i wanted that shit i 'd watch an actual anime ( and there 's a reason that i * do n't * ) . 
  there are a bunch more really cool stories over at / r/dndgreentext . 
  if you want a bunch more stories like that , come over to / r/dndgreentext, 
  i go back home for the christmas holiday on tuesday . 
  i 'm definitely sending this to my sister in hopes of the same . 
  this is how i feel about half life . 
  i played it for the first time only last year , and frankly i hated it . 
  i 'm sure it was a great game in its time , but it * really * has not held up over time . 
  yet every time i bring it up , people tend to ignore all the reasoning , and harp on about how it was such a great game in its time . 
  either that , or they have their rose-tinted glasses on and they refuse to acknowledge the arguments against it ( in the modern context ) or dismiss them as not being significant . 
  i 'm surprised that an app for windows phone was in the top 500 . 
  gmail labs has a thing you can opt into that forces you to do some maths equations before it 'll let you send . 
  it 's mainly for tired people , but could work equally well to prevent you emailing drunk . 
  i 'm australian , and i 'm having a hard time understanding how you pronounce it . 
  i just go full on miss . 
   if you pronounce it `` miss '' it loses its point when spoken aloud . 
  not really . 
  i see miss as being largely like `` actor '' . 
  sure , at one time it may have been exclusively male , and the female term was actress , but these days you can just say actor for anyone . 
  similarly , and woman can be `` miss '' , even if at one time that was exclusively unmarried women , with missus for those that are married . 
  uhh , yes , you can .
