  most people do . 
  award shows keep separate actor and actress prizes because they want to give a specific prize to men and women . 
  any context in which both `` actor '' and `` actress '' is used , those words each apply only to a single gender . 
  however , in general conversation , if only actor is used , it 's gender-neutral . 
  please tell me you tried that in a vm . 
  this is why you do n't put your swap file on your ssd . 
  you fucking wat mate . 
  i swear i read somewhere that this thing only reminds up to a year ahead ... 
   the suffix - ess in names of occupations such as actress , hostess and waitress shows that the person doing the job is a woman . 
  ** many people now avoid these . 
  ** instead you can use actor or host, 
  emphasis mine . 
  from your own link . 
  similarly :, 
   the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the 1950s -- 60s , the post-war period when women 's contribution to cultural life in general was being re-evaluated, 
  from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/actor#terminology ) . 
  perhaps you could argue that in some circles , the term `` actor '' is used exclusively to refer to a male actor . 
  however , you * definitely * have no legs to stand on when arguing that the term `` actors '' as a plural only refers to men . 
  if someone said `` they 're all actors '' , nobody would ever assume you are only referring to men . 
  wow , the picture with the binary on it actually has the correct ascii code for `` barbie '' . 
  that was impressive . 
  haha nah man , i was just jesting . 
  from everything i 've seen , windows phone looks like a great os in many ways . 
  just a slight lack of software compared to the other two big platforms . 
  i rarely use any titles , so it does n't come up very often , but if i do n't know the preferred title of a woman , i 'll use miss . 
  mizz is a dumb sounding word , and to me , miss is n't assuming anything , it 's the `` marital-status-neutral '' ( in the same way `` actor '' is a `` gender-neutral '' term ) word to use . 
  if someone tells me they prefer mizz , i 'll use it , but i just think it sounds dumb , and really it 's an unnecessary word . 
   just say that you have some giftcards lying around that expire on sunday , would you like to go see x on saturday, 
  and if that 's not true , and they call you out on it later ? 
  i 'm kidding , of course , but it does sound like a really mild plot from a romcom . 
  i 've always used it that way , and i know many others who do the same . 
  i do n't think i 've * ever * heard anyone use `` mizz '' except on tv , and when someone was explaining what mizz means . 
  i thought they were going to make a joke about executing programmes . 
  just so you know , you ca n't put newlines in the link text . 
  i think that 's overly cynical . 
  i suspect many people hardly even * know * about how big of an issue it was , and still is . 
  it 's probably something that 's at the back of their mind that they vaguely know about , but that 's it . 
  doing something like that really helps raise awareness about something that people actually are n't particularly aware about . 
  sure , a lot of people will probably just do the thing and then not think about it until next year , but if even a few people learn about it and are moved enough to volunteer or donate because of it , then it 's a good thing . 
  why is there pepsi advertising ** all over ** that page ? 
  that was for charity , clark ? 
  would n't it be 3240x1920 video ? 
  1080 * 3 , since it 's hd footage shot in portrait ( i.e. , each one has a width of 1080 ) , by 1920 , the height of the full hd portrait video . 
  honestly of all the things to call out , i think a gopro would be the * last * one you should . 
  it 's got no screen , so the light ca n't distract other people , and it 's really fucking small compared to a phone , tablet , or even a normal camera . 
  if you 're gon na call every one out , fine , but it seems really odd to me that you would pick on gopros specifically . 
  ( note , using `` you '' here in the general sense , not pointed at you , / u/lcbourne ), 
  work phone , personal phone , and * personal * phone . 
  so ... i do n't know much about fruit , but if the fruit a farmer is producing is of lower quality , is n't it fair that they 'd pay less for it ? 
   swearing at everyone, 
  but he 's not the one that did the swearing ... / u/beadledom is . 
  all / u/globaltourist did was restate their point , which happened to include a swear word . 
  oh yeah your picture is just totally bizarre , and really there 's not much else to be said about it . 
  i was only responding to your comment about the artist . 
  the school i went to ( in se asia ) went from 8:00 till 14:40 , with extracurricular activities normally going until 16:00 , sometimes 17:00 . 
  honestly it seems weird to me that it would need to go longer * anywhere * , unless it was because of a french-like system with really long lunch breaks . 
  we easily had enough class time for all of our work . 
  yeah i think the only time i * ever * used formulae or any sort of maths in economics sl was to provide examples for how comparative advantage works , and why countries should specialise their production . 
  what 's the reference here ? 
  true . 
  more than any other sport ? 
  edit : to clarify , is there an existing stereotype that nba players are very likely to be unfaithful , far more so than sportspeople in general ? 
  i got the same one !, 
  it 's not uncommon that even in non-american english ( british - , australian - , etc. 
  english ) , people will write `` program '' in the context of computer software . 
  but the word `` programme '' is always used when referring to [ `` a leaflet listing information about a play , game or other activity '' ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/programme ) . 
  i assumed it was assigned per person per post . 
  i guess mine is surprisingly relevant ... 
  battery life is n't nearly good enough to do that . 
  really , their main use is as an action cam , for filming sporting activities like skiing and biking . 
  that 's why their main features include high framerate , wide angle , and sturdy bodies , but they really sacrifice audio quality , and image sharpness . 
  it 's the interrobang , and it is absolutely beautiful . 
  except it 's not a `` you 're not wrong '' moment at all , because he is wrong . 
  anyone in that thread who claims any one meaning is the only meaning is wrong . 
  the idea that people would call non cola soft drink `` coke '' is so weird to me . 
  also why does nobody ever include the word `` soft drink '' when they bring up this argument . 
  that 's like , the most common name for it in half the world . 
  when 's the next election ? 
   let 's throw some shrimp on the barbecue, 
  i just wan na point out a couple of things , not to correct you necessarily ( because obviously you 're just using the common phrase ) , but more for pure interest 's sake . 
  one is that no australian ever uses the word shrimp , except perhaps to call something small , but even that 's not very common . 
  the animal in question is called a prawn over here . 
  we also spell barbeque with a q , but far more common is just `` barbie '' . 
  but perhaps my favourite bit of trivia is that putting prawns on the barbie was not actually a common practice in austraila , until * after * the ads starring paul hogan aired in america for aussie tourism . 
  oh yeah , no worries mate . 
  i just figured i 'd inject some learning into the humour , because why not have it all ? 
  no , not never . 
  the reverse is true : `` program '' never refers to the order of an event . 
  both programme and program get used for software . 
  ah yeah , i understand what you mean now . 
  though i actually do pronounce circus circ-us , it 's just that the u is somewhat shortened , kinda like the u in missus ( and sounding kinda like a shortened a ) . 
  i 've only ever heard it applied to carbonated drinks . 
  hear , hear . 
  your case is rather extreme , but chrome is very well known to be a heavy memory user . 
  i usually have 8 -- 12 tabs open and i 'm frequently at like 80 % + usage on my 4 gb system . 
  in your case , have a look at [ chrome 's task manager ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t4cyeuj.png ) ( on windows you can get it by pressing shift-esc , on os x you 'll have to go window -  task manager ) . 
  sort it by `` memory '' , and you can see exactly who the culprits are . 
  if there are a bunch of extensions at the top , consider removing them and/or switching to an alternative . 
  but neither he nor anybody else is really saying that they should have had gustin play flash in the dccu . 
  the problem was the timing of the announcement .
