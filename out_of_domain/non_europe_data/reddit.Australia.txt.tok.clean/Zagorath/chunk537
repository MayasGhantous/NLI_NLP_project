  my name 's not tim , although it is only one letter away from that ... so yeah ... 
  i used pocketcasts when i had an ipod touch , and i 'd recommend it on ios as well . 
  i 'm rather surprised that grey has n't got it as one of his recommendations . 
  also , i know this works on android , but i 'm not sure about ios , but you do n't even need to get a notification when a new episode is available , if you do n't want to . 
  you can have it just download the episode for you . 
  i feel like i 'm cheating , since i have my podcasts in a playlist , and there 's nearly always something after hi , since i tend to move it up to the top of the playlist . 
  so when there 's a long silence , i know there must be more to come , because otherwise the next podcast would have started . 
  ( unless he put a long silence with nothing after it , i guess ... ), 
   spoilers do n't expire, 
  on the one hand , i really agree with this . 
  i hate when people feel free to spoil stuff just because it 's old . 
  on the other hand , certain spoilers are so ingrained in our culture that i feel like they * do * become fair game . 
  darth vader was luke 's father , for example , or planet of the apes takes place on earth in the distant future . 
  as much as i wish i could have seen the original pota without knowing the ending , it 's such a big cultural phenomenon i do n't think it 's reasonable to say that particular example ca n't be used publicly . 
  the same is probably true of the above quote ( the quote itself being extremely well known ) , although i was n't aware of what movie it was from , or that it was a spoiler , so i do n't know what to make of that . 
  the same name is also available if you look through his wikipedia article 's history . 
  there 's an edit made by his account removing it -- an explanation can be found on the talk page ( that 's what got me to check the history of the page in the first place ) . 
  oh awesome , thanks for the info . 
  i recently decided to start watching them , but the source i had only had the first 6 episodes . 
  personally i think it 's all down to the cinematographer . 
  sure , the acting was decent , and the script was n't bad . 
  but really , the angles that they shot him at were just so perfect , and it all had exactly the right look and feel about it , visually . 
  no because if he was , he 'd have been aware that they were filming . 
  / r/especiallywithcontext, 
  i mean , out of context you could imagine it as being somehow relevant in context . 
  but when you see it in the actual context it was posted . 
  wtf is that ? 
  i learnt c in a course at uni last semester . 
  it 's a great language , really fun to work in . 
  i did n't expect i would when i first got into programming , but i think i really like the low level stuff a heap more than higher level . 
  you really feel like you 're controlling everything that 's going on , and when you do some advanced stuff , it feels so much more satisfying . 
  does n't the audio usually pause when you pull out the headphones ? 
  that 's probably the only thing that bothered me this episode . 
  this is one case where even if they did n't have thanksgiving messing things up , we 'd still want them not to air it . 
  the next arrow episode is designed to air after the next flash episode , since the two of them are crossover episodes . 
  if they aired it this week , the two would be out of order . 
  all these and more are easy to find at / r/dndgreentext .

  the rift is the third of three main avatar comics . 
  the first is the promise ( parts 1 -- 3 ) , the second is the search ( parts 1 -- 3 ) . 
  the rift part 3 actually only came out recently , which is probably why you saw it recently . 
  strongly recommend reading them for any fans of the series , but they really should be read in order . 
  it 's not totally essential , but there are elements that carry on between them . 
  no , he by definition must be lawful , because of what the avatar represents . 
  i think a case can be made either way as to whether he 's lawful good or lawful neutral , though . 
  as / u/ordereddiscord said , sozin had justification for it . 
  he seemed deluded , but actually wanted to help people . 
  presumably azulon had that goal as well , to some extent , but by the time ozai came along the original vision was completely gone , he justed enjoyed the destruction and power . 
  in greek mythology , you would be right . 
  however , in dnd , there is a type of creature called [ a medusa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medusa_%28dungeons_%26_dragons%29 ) , which is something with snakes for hair and which turns creatures to stone by looking at them . 
  there is another type of creature called a gorgon which is [ completely different ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorgon_%28dungeons_%26_dragons%29 ) . 
  so actually , in the context of dnd lore , what they did was completely correct . 
  but anyway , hating the whole story just because of one minor nitpick about the diction in it is , to be quite frank , kinda dumb . 
  this must be why my french teacher 's favourite verb to use for examples was * manger * . 
  he mentioned ios as a competitor , so i assume android was the platform he was talking about, 
  they ca n't fine a company for ceasing to do business in the eu , because their laws have no power over any company which does n't do business in the eu . 
  what 's the reference ?

  fun sized snacks , on the other hand , are the exact opposite of fun . 
  if you want to decide this democratically , the best way to do it would be to put all the options -- ** including ** the old gliders -- up for a vote using * any * of the various voting systems * apart * from first past the post . 
  approval voting would probably be the simplest for these purposes . 
  simply allow people to vote for as many of the options as they want , and whichever gets the most votes wins . 
  [ explanation of how it works ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orybdruj4va ) . 
  google forms could do this , using `` checkboxes '' . 
  [ i made a sample that you can see with a few of the options people suggested in this thread ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o1gji5h7jhys2c8rrxkbnl5ccxdjoxie7p74p_f45sk/viewform?usp=send_form ) . 
   it 's just a little awkward topping off the card, 
  i do n't know about the oyster cards in london , but the transport cards we have in my city can be topped up online if you have the number . 
  alternatively , you go to the top up machine , tap it on the receiver , and then do the money stuff . 
  are neither of those options with oyster cards ? 
  he was talking about the idea of assassin 's creed visiting the mongols . 
  something i 've never seen , but would really like to see , is keyboard layout switching . 
  one press to automatically switch the key bindings to be in the same location on the keyboard , but work with dvorak instead . 
   renaissance europe & middle east without magitek, 
  i am so excited for kingdom come : deliverance . 
  the user you replied to deleted their comment . 
  what did it say ? 
  but since you brought up dnd ( and i noticed you want to see a dark sun like setting ) , i thought i 'd add eberron as a setting i 'd be interested in seeing something similar to . 
  yeah definitely agree . 
   he is perceived as a jerk by mainstay society . 
  wait what ? 
  when did this happen ? 
  i 've never heard very much about him at all outside of community and that one award show he did . 
  that 's what he 's referring to . 
  i swear you just threw a bunch of random words together , there . 
   cn really lets good shows flourish, 
  [ lulwat ] ( http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/young-justice-tv-series-cw-2015.jpg ), 
  could you explain ? 
  needs an `` either '' option . 
  it took me ages of staring to even see the difference , i do n't particular care for one over the other . 
  from what i 've heard , green lantern also could have gone there . 
  though i never watched it , so i do n't know how good it was . 
  i 've been watching justice league for the first time recently , and honestly i feel that young justice was * heaps * better . 
  i find jl 's one or two episode completely self-contained stories really offputting compared to yj 's ongoing story and character arcs . 
  does justice league unlimited help fix this ?
