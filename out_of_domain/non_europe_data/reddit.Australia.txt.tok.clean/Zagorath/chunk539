  similarly , what do the speedometers in cars have written on them ? 
  could someone remake this with viewing distance in metres ? 
  exactly . 
  aus , why ? 
  no , no , not exactly , and pretty good thus far -- though running with my recovering ( from injury ) father means i 've had to go a lot slower than i 'd normally like . 
  beat a pr whilst engorged by turkey ? 
  sounds pretty impressive . 
  if by mma you mean mixed martial arts , i 'm really not sure what you 're talking about . 
  i do n't follow it ( i find it extremely dull ) , but [ a quick google suggests there 's no such restriction . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mixed_martial_arts_in_australia ) if you mean something else , well , i do n't know of any other definition of mma that makes sense here , so perhaps you could elaborate . 
  the video games thing has been improved dramatically in recent years , with the introduction of at 18 + category many previously heavily censored games have been rereleased uncensored , and less games are being refused classification than before ( though still too many , i would argue ) . 
  but anyway , a bigger problem is the price gouging by retailers . 
  i 'm more likely to pirate a game than buy it , unless i particularly want multiplayer , just because of that . 
  but anyway , i do n't know why i felt the need to explain all that . 
  what you 've done there is committed an ** appalling ** * false dilemma * fallacy . 
  there is absolutely no reason that i ca n't talk about how it 's stupid that the us and uk still frequently use outdated and needlessly complicated units of measurement , while * also * having problems with game classification and other things in my own country . 
  if you 've already been typing on dvorak for at least a few months , then i would suggest the best option is either a keyboard that you can rearrange the keys on ( despite the disadvantage of the f and j nibs being in the wrong place ) , that is , a keyboard that does n't have keys in subtly different shapes and angles . 
  alternatively , some higher end keyboards use a display to show what letter they are . 
  you could try one of them . 
  they do tend to be hideously expensive , though . 
  if you * have n't * been learning for a few months . 
  if your dvorak typing speed is n't at least as fast as your qwerty speed was before you started learning , then i would agree with / u/stereo . 
  do n't do it . 
  you 're much better off learning the keyboard without being * able * to look at it , because that acts as a crutch and will hinder your learning . 
  i 'm confused . 
  i must be reading this wrong , because it looks like you failed further maths . 
  a 3 is a failing grade . 
   as with every school in the world i think, 
  every ib school , yeah . 
  but it seems to me that you 're implying the same is true of non-ib schools , which is definitely * not * the case . 
  i know that in the uk ( with ( i ) gcse and a levels ) and in australia ( with various state-based curriculae ) that there 's no requirement to take a second language . 
  i was also really bad at languages . 
  still am , really . 
  i managed to scrape a 5 in sl french after having learnt it for 5 years . 
  unfortunately , no , there 's no way around it . 
  the ib has this stupid system where groups 1 -- 5 are mandatory , but group 6 can be replaced with an elective . 
  it 's [ one of the only things i 'd like to see changed about the ib dp ] ( http://zagorath.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/problems-with-ib/ ) . 
  what is your `` non-ib language '' ? 
  are you absolutely sure it 's a non-ib language , and not just something your school does n't offer ? 
  if it 's the latter , there * may * be a way around that . 
  right , but my point was that if you can already touch type it , then it can be handy to have a keyboard with the keys rearranged at a later point , for occasions where you 're not touch typing ( for example , if you 're going one-handed because the other hand is taking notes with a pen or is on the mouse ) , or for when others use your computer . 
  if you can already touch type , there 's no harm in rearranging it later . 
  just do n't rearrange while you 're learning . 
  relevant text :, 
   ` < stdint.h  ` defines types like ` int16_t ` , ` uint32_t ` , ` int64_t ` , etc. 
  you should always use those in preference to ` short ` , ` unsigned long long ` and the like , when you need a guarantee on the size of an integer . 
  of the c integer types , only ` int ` should be used . 
  when appropriate , you are welcome to use standard types like ` size_t ` and ` ptrdiff_t ` . 
   we use ` int ` very often , for integers we know are not going to be too big , e.g. , loop counters . 
  use plain old ` int ` for such things . 
  you should assume that an ` int ` is at least 32 bits , but do n't assume that it has more than 32 bits . 
  if you need a 64-bit integer type , use ` int64_t ` or ` uint64_t ` . 
   for integers we know can be `` big '' , use ` int64_t ` . 
   you should not use the unsigned integer types such as ` uint32_t ` , unless there is a valid reason such as representing a bit pattern rather than a number , or you need defined overflow modulo 2 ^ n. 
  ** in particular , do not use unsigned types to say a number will never be negative . 
  instead , use assertions for this . 
   if your code is a container that returns a size , be sure to use a type that will accommodate any possible usage of your container . 
  when in doubt , use a larger type rather than a smaller type . 
   use care when converting integer types . 
  integer conversions and promotions can cause non-intuitive behavior . 
  emphasis mine . 
  i was using it until about a week before they stopped supporting it . 
  just never bothered upgrading . 
  it did n't help that for the whole year previous to that i did n't have my desktop because it was at a friend 's place `` getting repaired '' . 
  honestly , it 'd still probably be on xp if dreamspark did n't give me a free copy of windows 8.1 . 
  the stars are most likely like that because it was a long exposure shot -- but not long enough to get full trails . 
  and yes , the photo is definitely a composite . 
  so what ? 
  very few people these days subscribe to the belief that all photos must be untouched by editing , and anything edited is inherently inferior . 
  yes , it 's nice when you can get a great shot sooc , but there 's nothing wrong with editing if it makes a nice looking image , which , imo , this is . 
  what , you do n't pronounce it [ \\ [ h\u0289t\u0289tu\u02d0p \\ ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_english ) ? 
  if you spend $ 40 or more in the store , shipping is free . 
  so if the base game is $ 30 , you need to buy $ 10 with of extra stuff in one shopping cart ( buying expansions or whatever ) , and you 'll get free shipping . 
  harvey normal : like harvey norman , but more bell shaped . 
  all those 9s make it look way more expensive , imo . 
  i 'd say it 's a genre unto itself , with many elements from both jazz and classical . 
  the fact that [ debussy composed some rags ] ( http://youtu.be/jwz0e7la9fq ) certainly helps demonstrate this , i would say . 
  they 're only the same thing in the same way that forward and left are the same thing , kinda . 
  i got the joke , but did n't think it funny . 
  thus , no upvote . 
  on the other hand , the explanation , while entirely unnecessary , was very well-written and intelligent , so i gave it an upvote anyway . 
  i imagine many others had similar trains of thought to me . 
  the arduino is a little computer thingy that you can write programmes for that will do stuff for you . 
  it has an easy way to connect input and output devices ( e.g. 
  thermometers and a control for the sprinklers ) that you can use in your programming . 
  either not too long , or long enough . 
  although i disagree with / u/onewingtorulethemall on the merits of a composite shot , he 's absolutely right that the stars here look like blurs . 
  a shorter exposure would have made for sharper , nice-looking stars . 
  a longer exposure would have made it clear that they 're nice trails . 
  but this exposure time makes it look bad , like a blur . 
  not sure if you 've replied to the right person here . 
  but if you did , can i ask why ? 
  the link is certainly interesting , but does n't seem relevant to what i said . 
  that 's exactly how i feel about the pirate party . 
  i love their policies , especially with respect to ip law , but god , they 're never going to be taken seriously with that name . 
  so do aussies . 
  that 's what i grew up calling 'em , anyway . 
  i always thought 100s and 1000s was a brand name . 
  where in asia are you ? 
  i tend to prefer wholemeal , but from memory i do n't recall white bread here in vietnam being especially sweet .
