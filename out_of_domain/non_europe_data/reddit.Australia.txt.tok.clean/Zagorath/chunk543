  but the apple ecosystem is also brilliant , as -- for what it 's worth -- is microsoft 's . 
  the only disadvantage with apple 's is that you 're much more locked in which hardware you choose . 
  it 's much harder to get a nice experience on windows or android with apple 's ecosystem than it is to have a wide range of devices using google 's . 
  but if you * are * entirely in apple 's ecosystem . 
  by god , that shit purrs just beautifully . 
   i use chrome and i really do n't have a problem with memory or cpu, 
  fwiw , i 'm full in on the google ecosystem , but i have some serious issues with it . 
  my pc is regularly at 80 -- 90 % memory usage ( of admittedly only 4 gb ) . 
  i just tried closing chrome on my mac and it went from 7.8 gb to 3.6 . 
  that 's with 19 tabs open , only one of which is a video . 
  not that it 's really a problem . 
  on my mac , i 've never noticed speed issues because of chrome ( though on windows it has been a serious problem for me ) . 
  far more of an issue is battery life . 
  for a couple of reasons , i tried going back to firefox a couple of months ago , and i noticed battery life at least * doubled * . 
  chrome is a * massive * battery hog . 
  still , for so many other reasons , in my opinion , it 's totally worth it . 
  but anyway , for what it 's worth , [ the iphone starts at the same price ] ( http://imgur.com/mhiajkp ) . 
  but fair enough . 
  i still have a nexus 4 , i was just basing the battery stuff on reports i 'd heard . 
  oh man , you went to an awful lot of effort in that . 
  really awesome job !, 
  i probably just would 've gone `` fuck off '' . 
  not that that would have been particularly helpful , but it would make me feel good . 
  hell , the chronicals of narnia are just a * very * thinly veiled allegory for christianity . 
  what he said was basically the same thing . 
  red + blue = = white-green , to talk about light as measurable on an rgb scale . 
  but peyton manning is clearly the right choice . 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ no ^ ^ ^ idea ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ any ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ those ^ ^ ^ are . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ ^ american . 
  what do we know about richard strauss that would cause that ? 
  was he also partial to fascist ideals ? 
  650 usd is currently 775.56 aud ( though the current rate is a 4 year low ) . 
  add to that the fact that aussie prices always include gst ( unlike america where they leave it out and you only find the real cost when you go to pay ) , so all other things being equal , the price should be 853.11 . 
  so the price is actually pretty reasonable , all things considered . 
  though when you 're used to the price of the older nexus phones , that 's a really hefty price to pay , whichever country you 're in ... 
  haha this makes me glad not to be seeing the ads . 
  if you 're in america , you can sign up with the offer code twit2 and get the `` platinum '' plan free for the first month , which is two books a month . 
  you got ta be careful though , if you do n't cancel the subscription manually by the end of the month , they 'll charge you for the next month automatically . 
  my group just uses the traditional 3x3 alignment grid regardless of what the phb says . 
  it 's not like your alignment has any real mechanical effect , anyway . 
  hedwig would be unaligned , not true neutral . 
  generally animals and non sentient beings are unaligned . 
  otherwise it 's a good example . 
   i think i 'll check it out . 
  bad idea buddy . 
  i 'll see you next tuesday . 
  wtf is we todd ed ? 
  i did . 
  does n't help . 
  yeah i got the `` i am so fucking '' bit . 
  i think the cadence with which i pronounce `` we todd ed '' is too different to `` retarded '' -- in addition to the w/r thing -- so i did n't get it . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  i just want to point out that as awesome as wicked is , it 's a separate canon from baum 's oz books . 
  as far as i 'm aware , there 's nothing in baum 's books to suggest that the witch of the east could n't walk , or that the witch of the west 's name was elphaba . 
   wwotw is still alive, 
  now , i 've not read the last book in the wicked series , but as far as i 'm aware , elphaba did actually die in the first book . 
  no they do n't . 
   when dorothy arrives , she tells elphaba that the wizard did indeed send her to kill the witch , but dorothy herself came to apologize for killing her sister . 
  furious that dorothy is asking for the forgiveness when elphaba has never received absolution for her own perceived sins , elphaba waves her now-burning broom in the air and inadvertently sets her skirt on fire . 
  innocently , dorothy throws a bucket of water on her to save her . 
  instead the water kills her , melting her away to nothing but a puddle and her clothes and infamous hat on the floor where she once stood . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wicked_%28maguire_novel%29#the_murder_and_its_afterlife ), 
  but i agree . 
  i would n't say it 's not canon , but the wicked series is part of a * different * canon to baum 's . 
  it certainly is a brilliant series , however you think it relates to the original oz stories . 
  it 's also comments in python . 
  which has n't been true since 2006 . 
  4e , strictly speaking ( my group chooses to ignore this and use the traditional 3x3 alignment grid ) , does n't have neutral . 
  only lawful good , good , unaligned , evil , and chaotic evil . 
  but that 's interesting insight . 
  i 've only read the manuals for 4e and 5e , so i did n't realise they did that differently in earlier versions . 
  nah mate , reversing a jailbreak i 'd just as easy as unrooting an android device . 
  or at least , it was back when i had in ipod touch ( 3rd gen ) . 
  that said , the two are n't really comparable . 
  jailbreaking results in a device that 's roughly as customisable as android * without * root . 
  yeah , like i said , my group tends to just use the traditional 3x3 grid . 
  it 's far better than the one 4e officially uses , and it 's not like it makes any functional difference to game mechanics , anyway . 
  oh right . 
  that 's the musical , though . 
  i was specifically talking about the books . 
   isengard and orthanc, 
  but seriously , for anyone who wants to know the actual answer , it 's orthanc ( the tower in isengard ) and barad-d\u00fbr ( the tower in mordor ) . 
  i know you know this , / u/daggertrout , i 'm just supplying the information for anyone else who comes along . 
  they generalised about humans even back in wan 's day . 
  `` i think you 'll find obama said that '' - einstein, 
  haha yeah , i told myself i 'd read 24 entries , had to force myself to stop when i got to 50 . 
  i 'll definitely keep going , just think that it 'll take me a few days to get through . 
  but by god , if this is n't amazing . 
  wow . 
  edit : ended up reading all the way from 50 to the end in one night , a few nights after getting to 50 . 
  wow that was good . 
  umm ... mods ? 
  i think the bot gave this post the wrong flair . 
  yeah , i very rarely enjoy tb 's videos , i find his style and personality incredibly grating . 
  but on this issue , i definitely think he came down completely on the right side . 
  trust me mate , i gave firefox another go for a couple of weeks a few months back . 
  when you 're used to chrome , it 's just impossible to do . 
  firefox really has n't kept up with the times . 
  which is unfortunate , given it uses less memory and is far nicer on the battery . 
  til programming is `` the most ... non-computer-savvy reason '' for something .
