   in the final entry we see they 're going there by train, 
  oh shoot , i missed that bit . 
  thought it said new paris . 
  cheers . 
   i believe the desert was intentionally created to separate the technological metropolis of new paris from the rest of the world, 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i was under the impression that the story said that the people who ended up * founding * new paris did so after going into the desert to see what evil had caused it . 
  as a side note , rereading entry 355 to verify that last point , i saw this bit again `` this group 's ambition was to make each kingdom self sufficient to end the wars '' . 
  what i thought was absolutely fantastic was how the narrator 's group of terrans seemed to do the exact opposite . 
  they pushed different groups to work * together * more , and * that * seems to have done the job of creating peace . 
  a really nice message . 
  oh god yes . 
  sometimes he got `` have '' instead of `` of '' correct , but i just checked , and he used `` than '' correctly exactly once . 
  there are 265 instances of `` then '' , and i suspect less than half of them are relating time or dealing with if/else clauses . 
  still probably my favourite piece on / r/dndgreentext . 
  to be honest , the grammatical mistakes were a small element of realism to the character . 
  there 's no reason that the character would necessarily be able to use these words correctly . 
   the narrator focuses a lot on what 's happening and not on how it makes him feel . 
  he sleeps with avery and it 's just sort of glossed over as `` ha , huge mistake , that wo n't ever happen again . '', 
  we do n't really know how he feels about the other characters , even the other terrans , beyond a vague loyalty because they 're all from earth, 
  yeah , that would have to be one of the biggest problems with it . 
  definitely wanted to know how the guy was feeling about a * heap * of different events that occurred , but we never really got that . 
  hmm fair enough , i guess that does make sense . 
  it definitely makes me feel a lot more at ease with what happened to the narrator at the end . 
  got ta say , though , from a realistic standpoint , it never made sense to me that he would go and light the thing himself . 
  why would n't he just use his incorporeal form to do it while being on the ship himself ? 
  ah well . 
  thanks for all the explanations !, 
  not only is it possible , [ but by certain metrics , the `` ideal '' base to use would be base * e * ] ( http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/446664/what-is-the-most-efficient-numerical-base-system ) , which is not only not an integer , it 's not even a rational number . 
  or good for it , if you have low blood pressure . 
  ( is / r/shittymedicine a thing ? ), 
  good . 
  if you 're from most of the world ? 
  absolutely nothing . 
  i heard a story of someone who thought they had a mac because their mate had set safari ( for windows ) to open maximised on startup . 
  do n't underestimate the incompetence of users . 
  definitely agree i 'd like to see it polished up and made into a proper book . 
  the asoiaf format would definitely work well , but i also kinda like the limited viewpoint . 
  i thought this extract kinda flirted with the idea of an unreliable narrator in a really good way ( like the dragon thing that i mentioned in the gametales thread ) , though it 's a technique that works best when it 's fully committed to it . 
  either way , really , if it had a higher `` production value '' ( for lack of a better term ) it 'd be absolutely fantastic . 
   also , the reveal that marcus ' wife is a shapeshifting dragon did n't sink in for me, 
  oh god yes . 
  shortly after that part , where it said `` even though we know her secret '' , i was so confused , and went back up to reread it . 
  still did n't figure out what the secret was until over 50 entries later where it explicitly says `` she 's a dragon '' . 
  but i think that 's actually quite an interesting way of going about it . 
  i doubt it was deliberate from the author 's perspective ( the doylist approach ) , but using a watsonian analysis , it 's quite simple to say that the narrator did n't make it clear because * he * knew what was going on , and he was really only writing it for himself and his party . 
  he did n't feel the need to explain it . 
   it 's got three charges . 
  and then you have to wait twenty-four hours . 
  not all that ambiguous , imo . 
  you get three charges . 
  when those are used up , you got ta wait . 
  how does one roll 1d3 ? 
  well , 1d2 can be a coin toss , too . 
  that 's a really cool shape . 
  sort of reminds me of those impossible triangles . 
  i 'm pretty sure this is based on young justice , and he was pretty techy in that . 
  my cousin is totally blind . 
  i 've heard him listening to text messages on his phone . 
  i listen to podcasts at nearly 3x speed , and i still have trouble understanding his screen reader . 
  it 's really quite impressive . 
  nah , heaps of people like the ending . 
  imo the ones that do n't are just whingers that would n't be happy with anything less than a fairytale ending . 
  this post is just a particularly bad example of that . 
  the last season was some absolutely fantastic television . 
  they had a pretty low budget , so visually it 's not that great ( the train episode in particular looked really bad ) , but narratively i honestly think it 's some of the most compelling character stories there have ever been on tv .

  on a much less interesting note , my piano has a nice shiny sustain pedal , while the other two pedals are all rusty ... 
  i would 've liked to have taken computer science , but even if my school had offered it , i probably would n't have . 
  it being a group 5 subject ( it 's now in group 4 , i did ib a couple of years ago ) that you nevertheless had to take * in addition * to regular maths , i could n't have done it , since i did music in group 6 , and would n't have wanted to do cs instead . 
  even if my school had offered it , only way i 'd have been doing it is if ib [ worked the way i think it should regarding group 6 ] ( http://zagorath.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/problems-with-ib/ ) . 
  is the same true of tok ? 
  either way , sounds like someone needs to update [ this table ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ib_diploma_points_matrix_2008_-_simplified.svg ) . 
  have you got an official ib source detailing the changes ? 
  i had a similar problem actually . 
  i wanted to take psychology sl , but the timetable meant that the only way to take psychology sl was as a group 6 class -- i.e. , i would 've had to skip music . 
  ended up taking economics sl instead , and in hindsight i 'm actually really glad i did . 
  if nothing else , knowing economics is more useful in internet arguments !, 
  i kinda just assumed the distance was 5k because it made sense with the time . 
  i do n't watch it very often -- only occasionally if it 's on tv and nothing else is on , or on a plane -- but if you 'd asked me to guess , i definitely would have said single-camera . 
  i dunno what it is , but there 's something about it that seems more like a single-cam show , to me . 
   as did some international and syndicated airings of the show, 
  thanks for this . 
  were it not for that article , i would 've gone to `` correct '' / u/gaberussell , since i 've never seen the show with a laugh track , as far as i can remember . 
  they definitely are . 
  but when one person is seeking moral support after * they * were raped , that is ** not ** the time or place to be discussing it . 
  the laterality index for this respondent is : -50.00, 
  the respondent is in the 2d left decile, 
  the augmented ( 15 item ) index is : -40.00, 
  [ mmm hmm ] ( http://gfycat.com/unitedimpurealaskajingle ) . 
  but yeah , i agree with / u/borristehbear , it 's very odd that they did n't include anything sporty apart from throwing . 
  i bat ( both cricket and base/softball ) and golf right handed . 
  that said , i 'd generally consider myself largely ambidextrous , more so than cross-dominant , but either of those more than just `` left handed '' . 
  with tpb down at the moment , anyone got suggestions for how i can get the episode , once it 's finished ? 
  thanks so much in advance . 
  ( i know the rules say no * links * to illegal content , so either names of websites or pm a link . 
  raw seem to have nothing wrong with that . ), 
  is that 1pm est or 1pm with that fancy magic time they use down south ? 
  ( or , perhaps , 1pm central or western time ? ), 
  awesome , thanks . 
  mainland australia has 5 time zones this time of year ( 3 normally , but some states use daylight saving , which fucks things up ) .
