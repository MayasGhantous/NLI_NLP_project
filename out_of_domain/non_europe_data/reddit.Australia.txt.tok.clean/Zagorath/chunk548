  chances are you 're referring to eastern daylight time ( sydney/melbourne time ) , but eastern standard time ( brisbane ) would be far from unusual . 
  if you 're not sure , do you happen to know what time it is utc ( aka gst ) ? 
  ah right , cheers . 
  haha yeah it does . 
  5 in mainland australia this time of year ( normally 3 , but daylight saving fucks things up ) . 
  eastern standard time ( and daylight time ), 
  central standard time ( and daylight ), 
  western standard time, 
  if it were on nbc it 'd have been threatened with cancellation about 6 times so far . 
   the same thing that they did for the flash/arrow fight : it 'd be a draw, 
  just wan na point out that by absolutely no reasonable metric was the arrow/flash fight that we saw a draw . 
  ollie * clearly * won it . 
  he had barry pinned and got him to look at the flashing lights : he achieved his objective . 
  it 's much less common these days than it once was , and with the right browser settings/extensions , you can make it much , * much * less likely ( turn off scripting , for a start ) , but it certainly * is * possible to get malware on your system just by visiting a site . 
  your username gives the game away , mate . 
  `` jock '' is such a quintessentially american word , you ca n't possibly expect anyone to believe that never watch any western media . 
  forward time travel * is * possible . 
  travelling at very high velocities and/or low down in a strong gravitational field ( e.g. 
  travelling at close to the speed of light near a black hole ) can produce noticeable and significant increase at the rate at which you travel through time relative to the outside world . 
  at a smaller scale , the effects of this are enough that gps would n't work without being specifically designed with it in mind . 
  based purely on the other comment replies , i 'm guessing she was clark kent 's love interest on smallville . 
  i dunno for sure , i never watched it . 
  which is equally incredible !, 
  you need to put two spaces at the end of a line, 
  to get it to put a newline, 
  in there . 
  not a bastardised version , just an early draft . 
  tbh , i think house of cards is probably the only example of an american version of a british show where the us remake * is n't * utterly horrible . 
  in this case , both shows are just so incredibly fantastic , but in subtly different ways . 
  so , that actual actually only gets you the last 1000 comments on your account , not back to the beginning of your account lime i wanted . 
  it 's also in a human readable format , where i wanted a nicely machine readable one . 
  but thanks for trying . 
  i bet you were a big fan of howard 's work choices laws , were n't you ? 
  it 's per mille . 
  like percent is / 100 , per mille is / 1000 . 
  they were notorious for making it * far * too * easy * to fire people . 
  it 's a huge part of the reason howard ended up losing the 2007 election . 
  repealing them was one of the earliest actions of the rudd government . 
  on that note , i 'm curious what you think about the current government . 
  it seems to me that how things work in the uk ( at least according to a comment elsewhere in the thread ) is reasonable . 
  no need for any note if it 's just one or two days sick . 
  less than a week , a self-signed statement is required . 
  and if it 's any more than that , * then * you require a doctor 's certificate . 
  there 's just no reasonable justification for requiring a note from a doctor when someone has a fever or a stomach bug that lasts one or two days . 
   this guy is missing an arm . 
  this girl has no tits . 
  this is a repost . 
  but i do n't give a shit . 
  better . 
  i 'm still trying to figure out what the fuck a five dollar word is . 
  it does n't sound like a large amount , but the context seems to imply that it 's a really fancy word . 
  and i have n't got the slightest clue where the phrase comes from . 
  the easy way to remember this is that `` phone '' has to do with sound ( hence telephone ) , and nym has to do with name ( pseudonym ) . 
   homophones , words with the same pronunciation but different spelling and meaning . 
  actually not necessarily . 
  homophones just have to sound the same , regardless of spelling . 
  all homonyms are also homophones . 
   ( iii ) if it is possible to cut a word out , cut it out . 
  there , that 's better . 
  oh thanks for this . 
  i had made the same assumption the user you replied to had made -- that it came from some game show . 
  i see people use penultimate when they mean ultimate/last . 
  that 's annoying . 
  as a lefty dvorak user , the dominant finger of my dominant hand now rests on the least used vowel in english . 
  i really do wonder why he did n't switch i and u. 
  the things that made qwerty good on mechanical typewriters are the same things that make it good on touch screens . 
  with the typewriter , commonly used letter pairs were kept separated to avoid jamming . 
  similarly , with a touch screen , it allows the autocorrect and prediction algorithms to work better .

  what 's the weird blade between the lightsabers and the pok\u00e9ball ? 
  actually , come to think of it , what 's the blade to the right of the poke\u00e9ball , too ? 
  to be fair , poor guy has a history of loved ones getting murdered . 
  but she 's a prosecutor , not a defence attourney . 
  no way . 
  [ you buggered up the spoiler formatting ] ( / s `` ra 's should know better then to just impale arrow and send him falling to his doom . 
  that never works . 
  should have cut off his head , too , just to be sure . '' ) . 
  needs quotes around the text . 
  i thought it was basically known he was gon na die . 
  it really did n't come as a surprise to me at all . 
  wait , when 's the 21st month ? 
  only if felicity was the one that killed her . 
  but is n't it winter in the northern hemisphere now ? 
  reminded me of the hound-brienne fight in got . 
  i do n't know how you can say that . 
  we 've seen like 5 minutes of him actually in the league . 
  we do n't know anything about his motivations for joining , or how loyal he is . 
  dude mark that shit as spoiler . 
  just googled both of those , and it looks convincing to me . 
  the newspaper 's been showing up occasionally since the first episode . 
  if i 'm ever writing to a sony exec , i 'm gon na make sure my signature says `` sent from my sony xperia \u2122 z3 . '',

  no , i 'm not .
