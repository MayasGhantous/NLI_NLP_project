  and not only that , a lid that forces you to drink with one specific hand ? 
  that seems ... pointless . 
  how does the game of thrones board game last 8 hours ? 
  it ends after , like , the 8th turn . 
  saw this when he put it up on youtube . 
  my first thought was `` i hope this is the third movement , but just known it 'll be the first '' . 
  still , there was a comment thread of people saying they wanted the third movement , too . 
  i +1 ` ed those comments so hard . 
  go to stamps.com and use the offer code twit . 
  it 's from a podcast i listen to , but not being in america i 've never been able to take advantage of it . 
  stamps.com is basically a site that makes all your mailing much easier , and means you do n't need to stand in line . 
  he was referring to the brisbane broncos , not the ... wherever in america the broncos nrl team is . 
  america has over 100 million , but the usd is also used heavily worldwide , particularly on countries with relatively soft currencies . 
  you could make that same inane argument about why any regulation regarding disabled people should n't be in place . 
  oh , we have to have ramps available me for the 0.002 % of people in wheelchairs ? 
  no way . 
  oh , we have to allow this blind person to bring their seeing eye dog into our store ? 
  god no . 
  money should be designed so that everyone can reasonably use it . 
  this includes blind people . 
  there 's no good argument for why notes * should n't * be different sizes . 
  seriously . 
  the lack of 1 and 2c coins , and the existence of 1 and 2 dollar coins , is perhaps the best thing about the aussie dollar . 
  add to that varied sizes ( so blind people can use them more easily ) and the polymer that they 're made of ( * much * greater durability ) , and i really think it 's the best physical currency in the world . 
  the us could learn a thing or two . 
  that 's the one . 
  haha thanks . 
  but yeah , i know it 's the nfl . 
  musta gotten autocorrected to nrl since i talk about that more often . 
  ( and it is , incidentally , the name of the league the brisbane broncos play in . ), 
  ah that makes sense . 
  the longest turns when i 've played have been like 20 minutes , * maybe * 30 at the most , and that 's playing with a group of complete noobs to the game . 
  haha yeah , they 're great . 
  it 's a pretty big network now , with a whole heap of shows . 
  the ones i listen to are twit , macbreak weekly , windows weekly , this week in google , security now ! , and all about android ( the last one does n't actually feature leo , but all the others do ) , but there are a heap more on the network . 
  listening at 2.5 -- 3.0 times speed ( depending in the podcast ) definitely helps . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  that 's funny , because american money * feels * like monopoly money compared to proper modern polymer banknotes . 
  i do n't use dvorak on mobile because i like to type really quickly without care for accuracy , and allow the suggestion algorithm work out what i mean . 
  this works best with qwerty for the same reasons swiping does n't work well with dvorak . 
  all of the extra mission ones are totally worth it . 
  the extra guns/armour designs etc. 
  definitely are n't worth it . 
  it only focuses on combat . 
  the incest is merely * implied * . 
  one heart, 
  wait , colbert , as in stephen colbert , is pronounced without the t ? 
  is he french ? 
  i thought the same , except instead of being an intentional mispronunciation , it was just ignorance . 
  hanlon 's razor , and all that . 
  as far as i 'm aware , not possible . 
  might be doable using `` ideas '' , but i 'm not sure , since that 's a feature i never got into . 
  nobody i 've seen has given any * good * reason for it . 
  they 're just whinging because they hate change . 
  same reason you guys have n't gotten rid of the 1c coin , and that you still do n't use polymer notes . 
  oh fair enough . 
  that 's kinda interesting . 
  i would have assumed his ancestry was french , but i did some digging . 
  apparently `` his mother 's ancestry was irish , and his father 's ancestry was mostly irish , with some german and english '' . 
  additionally :, 
   originally , his surname was pronounced / \u02c8ko\u028alb\u0259rt / in english ; stephen colbert 's father , james , wanted to pronounce the name / ko\u028al\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r / , but maintained the / \u02c8ko\u028alb\u0259rt / pronunciation out of respect for his own father . 
  he offered his children the option to pronounce the name whichever way they preferred . 
  stephen started using / ko\u028al\u02c8b\u025b\u0259r / later in life when he transferred to northwestern university , taking advantage of the opportunity to reinvent himself in a new place where no one knew him, 
  i found that quite interesting . 
  hopefully someone else will , too . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stephen_colbert#early_life ), 
  i do n't know whether to be proud or depressed by the fact that i already knew all of that . 
  well , apart from the `` hobbits are related to men '' bit , though i 'm not exactly surprised about that , either . 
  still , brilliant video . 
  i thought it did a great job of explaining the basic important bits of the tolkien universe , without going into too much unnecessary detail ( which is certainly * very * easy to do when talking about tolkien 's works ) . 
  the only thing that i might have thought worthy of mention would be that melkor , after he became outwardly evil , was given the name morgoth . 
  ( also , potential mistake -- though could just be an easter egg -- in the animation : you put `` morgoth '' in at 1:12 as the `` fifteenth valar '' , but every other mention of him went by melkor . ), 
  yeah that 's how i do it , too . 
  i prefer it this way , though , because it means i also get the notification on a new hi and a new blog post . 
  but if you 're gon na sub to the mailing list , there 's no need to use ifttt for that . 
  you can set a special case in gmail to mark it as important , separate from all other newsletters . 
  haha yeah , i just edited a comment about that in . 
  was n't sure whether it was a mistake from a previous revision of the video ( where he * was * going to mention morgoth by that name ) or if it was just an easter egg . 
  but i think most people would already recognise the name morgoth , so leaving it out seemed a bit odd , to me . 
  honestly , i really do like the hobbit movies on the whole . 
  i like the fact that they 've added some background stuff with the white council and the necromancer/sauron , and stuff with radagast . 
  that makes it really interesting , i think . 
  i also do n't buy into the criticism that `` the hobbit is only a few hundred pages , there 's no way it could possibly fill more than one movie '' . 
  the hobbit is also * extremely * fast-paced as a novel , while the lord of the rings is such a slow novel it 's not funny . 
  good , but very slow paced . 
  that said , i * do * think that these movies are too long . 
  a few scenes in particular stood out . 
  the party escaping the goblin mine in the first film . 
  the party escaping erebor in the second , and the radagast sledding scene could have been cut out entirely apart from maybe the first few seconds . 
  and the barrel scene . 
  oh god , the barrel scene . 
  it was just awful in every way . 
  it went * waay * too long , it undermined the brilliant simplicity of the original secret escape , and it was poorly filmed -- i swear , there were a number of shots during that scene where even the first time i was watching it , i just went `` oh god , they filmed this on a * gopro * '', 
  but aside from those specific criticisms , i have actually enjoyed the acting , the cinematography , getting more of howard shore 's awesome music , and most of the story . 
  edit : i 've just been made aware of the fact that the 3rd hobbit movie is now out in some parts of the world . 
  it does n't come out here until friday , so nothing that i 've said is in any way reflective of my views of the third movie . 
  oh my god !, 
  i did n't make that connection !, 
  i think the point of that is n't that it 's anti-progress per se , but that it 's against progress when that progress comes * at the expense of * the environment and its beauty .
