  certainly , that name is far more well known than melkor is . 
  the line is * in the movies * , as / u/scrubie _ wahoooo indicated by saying `` watched '' rather than `` read '' . 
  all the more reason to bring up who he is in this video . 
  people * recognise * the name , but do n't know who it is . 
  [ i assume that this is the `` lambasting '' to which you refer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thehobbit/comments/2bzm6s/world_war_i_similarities/ ) . 
  it 's certainly an interesting theory , and i 'm not * entirely * sure it 's wrong , but it does sound very similar to some other allegories that people have read into tolkien 's work , namely wwii with lotr and even anti-communism through sauron . 
  these other two readings have been vehemently repudiated by tolkien himself . 
  for example , in relation to the latter reading , he said `` i utterly repudiate any such reading , which angers me . 
  the situation was conceived long before the russian revolution . 
  such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought . '', 
  this , as well as some of his other writings , make it seem fairly clear that tolkien was not a fan of using allegory in his work at all . 
  it certainly is possible that he wrote the battle of the five armies with wwi in mind , and that his aversion to allegory came along later , from the sources i 've found , there 's nothing that explicitly denies this . 
  however , it seems unlikely to me , based on what information we do have at hand . 
   i believe the lore of asoiaf lends itself to a video of this style in a much better way than lotr can, 
  i do n't necessarily disagree , because i think they both have some absolutely brilliant lore behind them , but i do wonder why you say that . 
  it 's very good , but hardly a greyesque 4 minute summary . 
  tolkien 's work is slightly different from much of popular fantasy ( looking at you , eragon ) in that it is n't * just * made up vocabulary . 
  every single name in his universe has a history . 
  he literally invented e\u00e4 as a place to put the languages he had invented . 
  these languages had their own vocabulary and grammatical structures , but far more than that , he had also invented fictional etymologies and roots , and related different languages through their histories . 
  of course , for your average person who 's only seen the peter jackson films , and maybe read the lord of the rings and the hobbit , none of this makes any difference . 
  it definitely presents as a bunhc of `` made up vocabulary you need to learn '' . 
  that 's actually a very good point , although i think it 's one that might have been a little too difficult to make in the context of the video . 
  and since ( as far as i can recall ) none of the other valar are ever named , i think it 's of fairly little consequence . 
  oh it 's certainly ridiculous to say that tolkien -- or any author , filmmaker , or other creative -- was not influenced by the events of his lifetime . 
  it 's also very often worth bringing up these potential subconscious influences when discussing their creation . 
  i just think -- particularly when the author has gone out of their way to mention that they do n't like this kind of thing -- we need to be careful about stating ( or even implying ) that it may have been a deliberate , conscious , choice . 
  for what it 's worth , [ grey was aware that this was a problem ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cgpgrey/comments/2pky88/the_lord_of_the_rings_mythology_explained/cmxobyz?context=1 ) . 
   the creation of the orcs is one of several contentious points for tolkien nerds . 
  i had to pick a version of the story and just run with it . 
  haha as someone who 's been watching his videos since there were like 6 videos on the channel , i ca n't believe i 've never thought of that description of it before . 
  but what i think is brilliant is that it 's both eli5 * and * surprisingly detailed , in many cases . 
  yeah tbh , in real life probably a majority of relationships are at least that closely related . 
  we just do n't have the same level of documentation . 
  to be completely honest , probably the best way to do it would be torrents . 
  youtube and most other major video sites would likely get them taken down straight away . 
  torrents would make it so that the version can spread really easily . 
  best method would be to take the version you 've got and give it to a bunch of people by usb , dvd , whatever , and ask them to help you seed ( by giving them the same torrent file , and having them put the actual video in the location used by their torrent application ) . 
  bittorrent has a bad reputation for being only pirated content , but it really is n't . 
  it also gets used frequently for downloading linux distributions and that kind of thing , and it would be perfect for distributing this sort of thing . 
  that 's a really cool idea , and i would very much like to see it . 
  personally , though , i would prefer a slightly less cut down version . 
  in particular , i like having * some * radagast ( though his chase scene on the sled could have been entirely left out , except perhaps for the first few seconds ) , and i ** love ** the white council stuff and the stuff with the necromancer/sauron . 
  massively agree that the fight/escape from the goblins was way too long , as well as a few other scenes . 
  [ my full views , because i 'm too lazy to write it all again ] ( / r/cgpgrey/comments / 2pky88/the _ lord_of_the_rings_mythology_explained / cmxmcr1?context = 3 ) , that i wrote in another thread just a little while ago . 
  honestly i agree . 
  i like what they 've done with it so far , but they could easily cut out ~ 2 -- 3 hours of material and it 'd be perfect to me . 
  there really is n't any high quality free nle software . 
  there are some open source programmes out there , but they can be extremely finicky at best . 
  imovie 's also good if you have a mac . 
  but you 're far better off using the professional software from adobe ( premier pro ) , apple ( final cut pro ) , or avid ( media composer ) , even if you have to get a pirated copy , all of which are very good . 
  everyone knows robots are overwhelmingly programmed in c , which does n't have built-in exception handling . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ case ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ was n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ clear . 
  [ hmm ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bknkrv4cduk ) , 
  considering [ how defensive he got ] ( / r/cgpgrey/comments / 2pky88/the _ lord_of_the_rings_mythology_explained / cmxlzn9 ) about choosing not to mention morgoth ( which i would argue is a far more recognisable name than melkor ) , i 'm not surprised he did n't do that . 
  haha yeah , huge fan of hi . 
  the difference with morgoth is that * that 's * the name most people know him by . 
  even the lord of the rings films mention morgoth a few times ; i do n't recall melkor ever being used . 
  the comments further down that chain have been sufficient indication that many people did n't know who ( or even * what * ) melkor was , and that even grey 's video did n't help fix that . 
  he could have just always called him morgoth and i would 've been fine with that . 
  mentioning melkor and then mentioning the name change would have been even better . 
  but using * just * melkor , it seems to me , is leaving out useful information for no particular gain . 
  especially since he made the quip about melkor 's name sounding evil -- which i really do n't agree with , though morgoth certainly * does * . 
  the only mention of morgoth was a brief easter egg in the text displayed when he says that there are 14 ( or 15 ) valar . 
  no actual spoken mention . 
  so , others have already presented some very good reasons that the films you brought up , and many other old films , may have had what you perceive as bad acting . 
  i 'd just like to present one * classic * film that i think might do a good job of fulfilling your more modern standards . 
  casablanca , i think , has fantastic acting . 
  some of the more iconic lines in that film are delivered with a fantastic subtlety that is very eas ' y to appreciate today . 
  for example '' [ of all the gin joints in all the world ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa8d-jwfwds ) '' , '' [ play it again , sam ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do2olz49m54 ) '' [ sic ] , and '' [ i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddybg9cnxcm ) '' . 
  to me , this is something that definitely does not suffer from the seinfeld effect , and the acting is of a quality that anyone today would consider superb . 
  yeah i loved dragon age 's story , but have n't finished it yet because i got bored of the gameplay . 
  i think when i get back to it i might have to try ramping down the difficulty so i can storm through those bits and get to the story . 
  i really do n't agree , i loved the first two games ( and have n't yet gotten around to trying the third one ) . 
  but god , i know what it can be like when you do n't like one of the internet 's favourite games , i ca n't stand half life . 
  so have an upvote . 
  neither does `` july the fourth '' . 
  same in australia . 
  it 's normally been 18th of december , or even just `` 18 december '' , but more recently this particular americanism has been seeping in . 
  ready use it . 
  it may very well work great with dvorak , but it works even better with qwerty . 
  i know this is weird and completely off topic , but i 'm very curious about your use of the word vacation . 
  it 's a very american word , and most other english dialects would say holiday . 
  i always thought most europeans learnt british english . 
  a god-like being from star trek , particularly tng . 
  not in the form you were expecting ? 
  i do n't know what you were expecting , but i saw her completely by accident during a brief scan over the picture . 
  did n't expect she 'd be in there at all . 
  i did n't write it correctly since that is what most people know it as , and i linked to a video of the actual quote , anyway . 
  only in spoken , people saying `` december 18th '' . 
  i 've definitely never seen 12/18 . 
  [ would the story to which you refer be this one , per chance ? 
  ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2178r7/the _ story_of_the_drunken_fighter / ), 
  or even better , he did n't * have * those rules * until * the event described by the bond . 
  he saw the consequences , and swore never again to swindle someone who could n't afford to lose it . 
  myocardial infarction is my favourite medical term ever . 
  has been since i first read it in a random wikipedia surfing session . 
  they do n't . 
  india does n't , just as the best example off the top of my head .
