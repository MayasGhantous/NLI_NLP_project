  but there are many , many more really good ones worth going through . 
  easy mistake to make . 
  as far as i 'm aware , all countries in the commonwealth did * at some point * have the same monarch as the united kingdom . 
  i 'm going to be so glad when all these annoying ships are gone for good . 
  gesture typing is absolutely faster than finger typing is . 
  the only reason i no longer use it is that the gesture algorithm in swift key is n't as good as the one in the google keyboard . 
  and i like swift key 's prediction algorithm . 
  ( i use qwerty on my phone , either way . ), 
   pretty sure t is on the fourth tier, 
  why would you put a letter that 's common enough that it 's on dvorak 's * home row * on the ** fourth ** tier of such a keyboard ? 
  just bizarre . 
  so ... i 'm not sure who they are , but i think it 's, 
  storm , i think, 
  wonderwoman, 
  ms. marvel, 
  bat girl, 
  power girl, 
  cat woman, 
  emma frost ( or possibly dazzler ), 
  hopefully someone can fill in the blanks for me . 
  edit : mistakes fixed thanks to / u/ndn _ shadow . 
  wait , i thought christianity said homosexuality was a sin . 
  yeah i know . 
  i was just having some word play . 
   police then win the case for clearly being able to make witty and excellent movie references, 
  all in favour of changing our legal system to work on this basis , say aye . 
  just so you know , the syntax for reddit links is ` [ displayed text ] ( web link ) ` . 
  i have n't seen a single zutara shipper in years . 
  though perhaps with korra it 'll be different , since it seems that the canon is going to be * no * ship , which probably leaves more room for shippers to make their shit up than when there 's a clear alternative that is correct . 
  i do sometimes , but i have zero interest in serious romance in korra , and i despise when people try to force together characters who are clearly not meant to be together according to canon . 
  so , i do n't disagree with the * point * that you 're making , but i think that reasoning leaves a lot to be desired . 
  saving a slave 's life , when that slave * might * have been in a homosexual relationship ( where the `` might '' is based only on social norms , and not anything specific to that situation that implies it ) , definitely does not in itself imply an agreement that homosexuality is okay . 
  jesus may have , on other occasions , said or done something that implies he 's okay with it . 
  i do n't know . 
  but the occasion you pointed to is -- at least from the information you 've given me -- not a good argument . 
  oh yeah , i am talking about qwerty . 
  dvorak is definitely a different matter . 
  though , that said , i prefer qwerty on the phone for the same reasons that dvorak does n't work well for gesture typing . 
  all the vowels being close to each other , as well as the most common consonants being next to each other , means that the autocorrection algorithm has a harder time doing its thing . 
  wait that episode only just aired ? 
  holy hell , i randomly stumbled across it on youtube a few hours ago . 
  assumed it had been up for months , at least . 
  pure speculation on my part here , and i 'm only commenting since you have n't got any other replies yet . 
  it could be that getting more sugar in you causes your pancreas to produce higher levels of insulin , to help regulate the increased levels of glucose . 
  perhaps because of how sugary it is , the pancreas overcompensates and makes way too much insulin , and your blood sugar levels drop too far . 
  again , pure speculation . 
  it has better features than any of the other reddit apps on android . 
  at least it did last time i was shopping around about 18 months ago . 
  ability to expand comments ( like clicking `` load more comments ( 23 replies ) '' on the desktop ) , ability to view a user 's profile , good multi-account management , easy navigation to arbitrary subreddits , navigation between comments ( like a `` parent '' button , a `` root '' button , in addition to the obvious `` hide '' ) . 
  the first two there were the most important for me at the time i made the decision , and * no * other app had them to my liking . 
  i also tried , for reference , reddit sync , reddit news , and bacon reader . 
  having a bicep on the hand is weird . 
  i 've got ta be honest , apart from minecraft videos about how to do a specific cool project , and skyrim mod videos , i really do n't enjoy let 's plays . 
  i do n't know why , i just do n't get them . 
  i did watch last of us from start to finish on youtube , since it was such a great game , but i do n't have a playstation . 
  i specifically found a version where the person * was n't * talking all over the top of it , because that would have ruined the incredible cinematic experience of it . 
  but that was more treating the game as a film than watching a true `` let 's play '' . 
   it 's one of those things where you have to meta-game a little bit sometimes, 
  this is what i do n't like . 
  i consider it a sign of bad dming if the party is strongly tempted to split the party . 
  if it seems like splitting the party would be the logical choice , for example by having the villain do the typical trope of `` you can either catch me or save the innocents , but not both '' , or , as my party recently experienced `` you can catch me , or get the gold that i stole back , but not both '' , the * obvious * thing that any group of six adventurers would do is split up in this situation . 
  splitting the party may not make for good gameplay experiences , but sometimes it 's the logical choice . 
  to avoid this , dms should avoid using this type of structure . 
  it ruins the experience from a roleplay perspective . 
  the players should n't be put in a situation where they have to meta-game like that in order to keep the game running smoothly . 
  yeah that type of thing is entirely the players ' fault . 
  the picture certainly looks similar . 
  edited . 
  it 's true that you ca n't expect a libertarian to hold any other view . 
  but i can say that libertarianism is a stupid viewpoint completely based in fantasy . 
  ah , i see your girlfriend knows your reddit account . 
  no , they do n't . 
  water does n't have a `` memory '' or anything like it . 
  and homoeopathic `` remedies '' are diluted to the point that it is literally just water . 
  we 're talking one molecule of active ingredient in an area the size of the ** solar system ** . 
  so nobody who buys it is actually getting anything with active ingredient . 
  there are ** zero ** non placebic effects of homoeopathy . 
  zero . 
  as a musician , oh god yes . 
  when you have to play the exact same concert year after year because people love to hear their bloody christmas carols ... urgh . 
  you get sick of them very quickly . 
  fuck who ? 
  i was expecting [ this ] ( http://31.media.tumblr.com/96d10da72f59c94dcd42681f51d58a40/tumblr_ncd9nfald61s46koto4_250.gif ) . 
  it 's basically the scouring of the shire . 
  yeah i just assumed that scene was the next day , or possibly even a few days later . 
  this perfectly sums up how i feel about it . 
  there 's absolutely no way they wanted to end it that way purely for artistic merit .
