  i 've never seen one in brisbane . 
  only physical store dedicated to gaming is eb games . 
  and fuck if i 'm ever setting foot in one of those except to laugh at the prices . 
  as an aussie , when i was on holiday in the uk i went and had a look at a game . 
  bought 3 games for # 10 . 
  thought it was a great deal . 
  and the guy at the counter was really nice when i went to pay for the stuff . 
  this has always annoyed me . 
  do n't deviate from standard controls if there 's no reason to !, 
  comes back next session with sir stirshit upalot the second . 
  i do n't know about mr. universe and mr. world specifically , but many , many body building competitions do not outlaw the use of steroids and hgh . 
  so it 's not * quite * the same thing . 
  this is an important point . 
  the comments are often invaluable for deciding which version of a movie to download , or how to troubleshoot a problem with a game or programme . 
  no i understand very well how steroids work . 
  does n't change the fact that with steroids it 's a hell of a lot easy to get those ridiculous bodies than it would be without . 
  wait what ? 
  at the school i went to , high school was 11 -- 18 . 
  years 7 through 13 . 
  in australia it 's generally 12 -- 18 , years 8 through 12 . 
  do american primary schools really go all the way up to 15 year olds ? 
  i imagine they add up pretty quickly . 
  each comment is at least one byte per character ( if it 's using ascii -- potentially more if it uses unicode ) plus that comment 's metadata ( at a minimum the username , date/time , and which post it 's on ) . 
  considering the number of comments is probably much greater than the number of torrents , i imagine that this adds a significant amount of size compared to just having magnet links and a torrent name . 
  [ obligatory ] ( http://xkcd.com/1000/ ) . 
  which is a massive increase on the 90 mb that they started with . 
  but yeah , i remember seeing a figure of a hundred and something gigabytes being a slightly older full backup of the pirate bay , back when it went down a few weeks ago . 
  just want to point out that a function that returns nothing and takes 0 arguments is n't * necessarily * a `` useless '' function . 
  it could be modifying a global or object variable , or even just printing some constant value . 
  def print_hello_world ( ) :, 
  print `` hello , world ! '', 
  a book is a physical good . 
  when you buy it , you * own * that copy of the book , and should be allowed to do whatever you want with it . 
  ( with very few specific exceptions -- you ca n't scan it and put the scanned copy online , for example . ), 
  if a company wants to buy a book that someone is selling overseas , then import that book here to australia , and sell it on to someone else , they should be fully allowed to do that . 
  there 's no reasonable justification that they should n't be allowed to , and yet ( at least according to my reading of / u/slowblowfuse 's comment ) they are n't allowed to do this . 
   he 's noticed that there 's no price difference between buying it in america and paying for the shipping to get it here , or buying it in australia and paying virtually nothing for delivery, 
  where 'd you get this idea ? 
  his exact words were, 
   $ 12.95 and free shipping . 
  over there it 's $ 29.95 plus shipping, 
  if he bought it in america , it would be $ 13 , and he 'd have to pay shipping for it to get to australia . 
  if he buys it in australia , he would pay $ 30 * and then * pay shipping to get it from the store to the recipient . 
  without having the actual shipping prices ( the international one if he bought it in america , and the domestic one if he bought it in australia ) , there 's no real indication of which would cost more or by how much , so claiming there 's `` no price difference '' just came out of nowhere . 
  you can use a * starbucks * gift card to pay for access to a vpn ? 
  a * debt * card , if you will . 
  how did you get that tiny little baby to hold up two of your d6s so close to the camera ? 
  but why would the vpn accept that ? 
  how do they get money from it ? 
  i can see how it 'd work with a general-purpose gift card , but a store-specific gift card just seems like it could n't possibly work . 
  a friend of mine just asked me and another friend to join in at their table . 
  we both played spare characters from others that were sitting out . 
  he and the others at the table explained the basic rules of 4e dnd ( what at-wills , encounters , and dailies were , the standard/movement/minor system , skill check and what they 're for , etc. 
  ) , but for the most part i figured it out myself reading the books . 
  pretty simple , but looking back on it i 'm just really glad it was n't an earlier edition !, 
  was playing a wizard , but i did n't play very smart at all , rushed in to the middle of combat , etc. , rather than hanging back and letting others take the brunt of the damage . 
  a couple of sessions later i ended up getting killed in a tpk ( mine was one of two characters to actually get `` killed '' properly , the others were merely unconscious and could have been revived if anyone were around to revive them ) . 
  the two of us ceremoniously ripped our character sheets in twain . 
  it felt really touching , and i 've been hooked on roleplaying ever since . 
  i had a female player when i first started playing . 
  she left soon after , though , because she preferred 3.5 and we played 4 . 
  that was the first i had ever heard that there were different versions of the game . 
  for e and f , do you do the top horizontal stroke * before * the downstroke ? 
  just curious . 
  i 'm exactly the same as you . 
  e and f from left to right , since they extend from the downward stem , and i do the downstroke first . 
  everything else goes from right to left . 
  yeah seriously . 
  why even put something on gfycat if you 're just going to link to the . gif version of it . 
  [ here 's the html5 version , for anyone that wants it ] ( http://gfycat.com/spottedpreciousflyingfish ) . 
  it 's 1/5th the size , so it 'll load faster . 
  yeah , this ship was entirely done to please all the `` fans '' that were saying they wanted it . 
  there was zero romantic chemistry between them before this season , and even then it was in really small doses until that final scene . 
  * and even then * they did n't go all the way with it . 
  one could make a * very * strong argument that it was n't romantic , and was just between two friends . 
  i have a friend who watches the show but does n't go on reddit or tumblr or anything , and when i mentioned the ship to him after the finale he was completely confused , he did n't see it at all . 
  claiming it as canon is , at best , a stretch . 
  and junior high is considered a separate school from high school ? 
  mod from / r/dndgreentext here . 
  here are some links to my personal favourite stories , to give you an idea of the sort of content we get . 
  * [ the mechanic ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 217h1w/star _ wars_tabletop_the_mechanic / ) ( set in a star wars universe , with an awesome ending ), 
  * [ demi gods ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2k1qjk/demigods _ xpost_gametales / ) . 
  this one 's extremely long , but absolutely worth it . 
  might wan na take this one a little bit at a time if it 's too long for one sitting . 
  * [ an evil necromancer in an online game ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2grdzv/an _ evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game / ), 
  * [ an evil campaign ... gone good ? 
  ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21ba53/an _ evil_campaign_gonegood / ), 
  * [ the medusa ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2cc629/the _ medusa / ) , really poignant . 
  * [ of gay marriage , kings , and democracy ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2179br/of _ gay_marriage_kings_and_democracy / ), 
  * another really , * really * long one , about [ a group of unsuspecting modern-day humans who enter a portal and find themselves stranded in a high-fantasy world ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) . 
  * and of course , perhaps the most famous one , [ sir bearington ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2179ea/sir _ bearington / ) ( but also , [ it 's origins ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dpqop/the _ original_story_of_sir_bearington / ) ) . 
  but there are many , many more really good ones worth going through . 
  nah i definitely agree . 
  i never really * felt * quinn . 
  interesting . 
  do you do top , down , bottom in roughly one stroke ? 
  this is beautiful . 
  arirang is basically the national song of korea , sort of like waltzing matilda is to australians . 
  to see musicians from both koreas playing it together is just beautiful . 
  i honestly do n't know why imgur ever put in community features .
