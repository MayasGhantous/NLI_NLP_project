  how satisfied are you with your contact with the police ? 
  comments : i live in vietnam , where police are unbearably corrupt . 
  edit : oh , feel free to ignore this in whatever it is you 're getting these answers for . 
  i understand it 's probably not quite what you were looking for . 
  yes , but as we become more mixed , accents will blend . 
  accents , unlike genetic traits , * are n't * discrete . 
  if you look at people who have lived in highly mixed populations ( say , they went to international schools when growing up ) , they will often have difficult to pick accents , or `` no '' accent at all . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b_\\ ( musical_note \\ ) ) , [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/note ) , and [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bach_motif ) . 
  i 'd say the last one , about the bach motif , is probably the easiest to read and find the relevant information . 
  edit : oh , and happy cake day !, 
  the film industry ? 
  very cool . 
  what do you do ? 
  they have a `` no , but could be worse '' option , so why not `` yes , but could be better '' ( owtte ), 
  welcome to politics . 
  thanks . 
  your example was also about something that does not qualify as a dmca takedown request . 
  you said it yourself . 
  my point is that on youtube , if you get a copyright claim against content in your videos , there 's a very simple form to complete online in order to get that claim removed , if it truly is invalid . 
  this contrasts to what you were saying about justin.tv, 
  yeah , but if you take the comma as the decimal , it makes no sense . 
  that 's tiny !, 
  yeah i agree . 
  just based on the sheer numbers of votes before reddit got involved , though , i find it very hard to believe the numbers were n't cheated somehow anyway . 
  a couple of reasons i do n't think commented is european . 
  used dollars , why not euros or an older european currency ? 
  when it 's a round number as large as one hundred , why show decimals at all ? 
  and then just the sheer fact that one hundred is way too small to be right . 
  very good point . 
  i feel that $ 100,000 does seem an awful lot . 
  it 's just that i would lean towards that based on where the comma is . 
  wow very cool . 
  best of luck to you getting your script made into a film !, 
  again , i still have n't read the study , so correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  but i thought that the karajan link was editorialising on the part of the economist , or at the very best , it 's just something mentioned in passing by the actual study . 
  yeah . 
  people call them `` no '' accent sometimes , but i prefer the term `` international '' accent . 
  it 's a very neutral accent that makes it hard to place where they 're from . 
  but remember , we do n't actually need inter * breeding * for accents to go away . 
  just a lot of people being exposed to a variety of other accents for extended periods of time , such as moving to a different country . 
  i agree though , they wo n't be going away for a very , very , long time -- if at all . 
  ah yeah , i thought that might be the case . 
  my first comment really did n't make it quite clear enough , so sorry about that . 
  exactly . 
  the article me mentions the myth that a conductor 's job is to wage his arms in time . 
  definitely not true , but it * is * true , to some extent , during the actual performance . 
  if the conductor and orchestra are good , they 'll have learnt and remembered all the minute details of how to play it during rehearsal , and really do only need the conductor for timing . 
  just to provide a little counter-argument . 
  and the number 6 is on the seventh one . 
  so does the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org/uselection2012 ), 
  random question . 
  do they have a trademark on `` jeep '' in australia ? 
  does anyone here know ? 
  i watched all except the last three videos , and nothing like that happened before i stopped . 
  but that 's exactly what i was expecting . 
  i 've had some conductors who are absolutely horrible . 
  telling musicians to play the opposite of what 's written in the score , yelling at musicians for getting things wrong , yelling at the orchestra as a whole for doing things wrong , blaming sections when an individual is to blame , blaming an individual when the section is to blame , etc. 
  i was expecting him to be a bit like this , although with greater musical knowledge . 
  i.e. , getting really mad , going crazy , but at least when he does it the person/group he gets mad at * was * playing incorrectly . 
  i hope so !, 
  i 've got the patent for that . 
  haha fair enough . 
  good luck with your study . 
  in australia it 's the standard . 
  you can get unlimited , i 'm pretty sure , but they 're expensive . 
  yeah ... imgur takes png images , ever screenshot tool i 've ever used exports png images . 
  so why do we get this horrible jpeg ? 
  i really like the play on words , but this has been [ done ] ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110923105735aahwh1n ) [ on ] ( http://nz.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110922141839aawkogx ) [ yahoo ] ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110924125056aaoym7z ) [ answers ] ( http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110924224449aajmkw8 ) [ many ] ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120707223604aa6ywt3 ) [ times ] ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120620052420aa2uppo ) [ before ] ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110925074153aagnl3b ) . 
  i find it interesting to see the different responses from the answerers . 
  sometimes they realise it 's a deliberate play on words , sometimes they seem confused by it . 
  is n't forced/arranged marriage illegal ? 
  i 'm still waiting for mods to verify this is valid . 
  something about this does n't quite feel right . 
  i do n't find the claim hard to believe , but reading the answers , something does n't feel right to me . 
  the slightest inconsistency , perhaps . 
  yeah , fair enough . 
  this makes sense . 
  that boggles my mind , but it does make sense . 
  thanks, 
  what was your mum 's response to that question ? 
  i dunno , i 've been feeling odd about this from near the beginning . 
  after reading a few different answers to similar questions , the answers just seem somewhat off . 
  i ca n't put my finger on it exactly , just something does n't seem right . 
  many of these already have answers elsewhere , but the ones that do n't are very interesting to me ( for example , about punishing , and about spending time with/talking to other men ) . 
  by the way , i think you mean `` verbally '' punish , or possibly `` psychologically '' . 
  haha yeah . 
  even native speakers have that problem sometimes . 
  do n't feel bad about it !, 
  not everything wants to kill you . 
  many snakes would rather eat you alive . 
  paint has the option to save as png . 
  but imgur does support png . 
  someone else mentioned that it automatically converts to jpg , but at least if it does , it 's a high quality . 
  edit : nevermind , saw the edit , all 's well . 
  in australia they end mid or even early december , and start in february . 
  yeah definitely . 
  both the original and 2000 are great . 
  yeah this is an awesome idea . 
  if you do n't have any good ones in your area , [ abc classic fm ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/classic/music-listings/ ) , from australia , is a really good one available online internationally . 
  the link is to their music listings , which are in aest , so if you wan na schedule specifically for something you 'll have to convert .
