  they 're half-arsed copies of reddit features , when imgur was already * literally created * to host images for reddit . 
  no it does n't . 
  it makes it an already awesome show which is suitable for adults even more awesome . 
  but there 's no reason that a show entirely aimed at children could n't do the same thing . 
  do n't forget when smartphones first came around , we had tap tap revenge ( and all of its sequels and spin offs ) , as well as rock band , and [ literally dozens of others ] ( http://appcrawlr.com/ios-apps/best-apps-music-rhythm-games ) . 
  it had that one tower that you had to climb to the top of to send a message . 
  not really sure that counts for the purposes of the argument , though . 
  haha awesome , have fun !, 
  which edition are you playing ? 
  do you have any ideas for a character in mind , or are you going to be making characters when you 're there ? 
   i 'd also like to see alignments altered - maybe not have them at all , maybe just good/neutral/evil like 4e, 
  that 's kinda funny , because alignment is one thing that my group houserules back * into * our 4e game . 
  lawful good , good , unaligned , evil , and chaotic evil just feels so nerfed compared to the standard 3x3 grid . 
  but of course , in 4e it has no * mechanical * effect whatsoever , so we use it purely as a descriptive device , where it makes more sense . 
  this is a trope called [ quadratic wizards , linear warriors ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/linearwarriorsquadraticwizards ) ( warning !, 
  tvtropes link , do not click if you have anything to do in the next few hours ) , and it 's a well-known problem in not just dnd , but many fantasy stories and games . 
  this is one thing that 4e did * extremely * well . 
  class balance was a primary focus of the system , and as such all classes are equally useful at all levels -- roughly speaking . 
  5e also seems to do this pretty well , though it seems to have made some minor concessions in order to bring back things like vancian magic . 
  this makes me want to make my next 4e character a goliath rogue . 
  what he means is * in-character * spell creation rules . 
  the rules that exist are for the player and the dm to create spells , but how the character gains spells is the same as ever . 
  he wants the wizard to have to study to create spells and adapt them in-universe . 
   character level and spell level should be the same, 
  they could have gotten around this * so * easily just be renaming the latter . 
  your level 5 wizard has access to spells of the third circle ( to use the terminology someone came up with in a previous thread like this one ) , or access to third-tier spells , even . 
  just do n't call them levels . 
  i 'm not sure how i feel about this . 
  on the one hand , the way 5e does it makes certain skills clearly less valuable than others . 
  all are going to be roughly equal in terms of offensive/active use ( obviously your class will determine which specific ones you want more power in , but in the general sense , they 're all equal ) , but for defensive/reactive use , some are basically useless . 
  you 're never going to have to do a charisma save , or a wisdom save , for example . 
  so 5e mechanically encourages dropping certain stats in that way . 
  but similarly , the 4e way of doing things encourages a similar -- potentially even worse -- behaviour . 
  stat dumping . 
  the smart thing to do in 4e was to have one of each pair be high , and the other be a dump stat . 
  playing a str/con character was bad , because you 'd be wasting points and would be forced to have a much lower reflex or will , since two of your high stats go towards fortitude , but only one actually counts for the bonus . 
   key abilities : intelligence , strength , constitution . 
  bonus to defense : +2 will, 
  what 's wrong with this , exactly ? 
  seems as though it 's specifically designed to be a pretty good all-rounder , which makes sense for something called a sword-mage . 
  its name literally says `` i do both sword fighting and magic fighting '' . 
  google is n't turning up anything remotely relevant for me . 
  needs an [ fc ] tag . 
  but damn this is really cool . 
  two very similar words/phrases with very similar meanings , coming from * entirely * different parts of the world , with absolutely no relation etymologically . 
  ah thanks . 
  yeah , avatar really does contrast quite heavily with the rest of nick 's stuff ... 
  i get what you 're saying , but the subreddits are key . 
  many of the biggest subreddits have pretty inane content , and even worse comments . 
  but i never see any of that , because i choose only to see subreddits with really good content . 
  reddit also has the big advantage of text posts and non-image links , which is kinda important for getting a strong community with intelligent conversation going . 
  okay , i wrote all that out before i re-read your comment and understood what you were actually saying ( i thought you had said `` about how reddit is better than imgur '' ) , but i 'm gon na post it anyway . 
  just treat it as a reply to the people you were talking about , instead of a reply to you . 
  oh god please tell me you 're kidding . 
  shorter than twitter 's ? 
  and i thought youtube 's comments were bad before the google + integration , with their 500 character limit . 
  my dad 's a maths teacher . 
  so i * think * he probably got laid at some point . 
  as a left handed white person , i would ... well , i probably still would n't sub to that , but i could * say * i would . 
  germany has dw . 
  france has tv5 monde . 
  australia used to have australia network , before it got cut thanks to the new government , and replaced with the much smaller `` australia plus '' . 
  i 'd say they 're probably nominally for soft diplomacy , to get people from other countries interested in the culture of their country . 
  but in reality they probably get most of their viewership from expats living in other countries . 
  sorry if this sort of content is not desirable around here , i really am not sure , though i did n't see anything in the rules that would be against it . 
  i found it [ from this thread ] ( / r/classicalmusic/comments / 2q19sz/north _ korean_and_south_korean_musicians_playing / ) in / r/classicalmusic . 
  eh , i had * serious * issues with youtube 's comment system before . 
  i know i regularly had to split comments into two separate posts , and occassionally three . 
  it 's enough to get across a basic point , but not enough to elabourate and explain yourself , especially if you need to rebut more than one or two arguments that require subtlety to properly explain . 
  the ordering system definitely has problems now ( as you said , trolls frequently float to the top ) , but it 's so much better than it was before it 's not funny . 
  following conversations was absolutely impossible , and you 'd end up making a statement , which five different people would rebut , and then you 'd have to respond to all five of them separately . 
  at least now it 's all in one continuous thread . 
  ( as a side note , this comment here is over 500 characters , though if i had only needed to make one of the points -- either the character limit thing , or the ordering thing -- it would have fit . ), 
  guys , do n't downvote him . 
  [ he 's right ] ( / r/iama/comments / 9tlwi/im _ the_imgur_guy_ama / c0edn5u ) . 
  but i 'm not sure that changes the point very much . 
  it was made specifically to be used as a hosting service for other platforms , primarily reddit and digg . 
  and even so , considering he was a reddit user well before imgur , and created a digg account specifically to talk about imgur , that certainly lends credence to the idea that it was created more for reddit than digg . 
  at least as far as i 'm aware , only one of the examples i gave would be a `` method '' . 
  if something 's altering a * global * variable , or printing some * constant * value , that 's not a method , at least by my understanding . 
  only if it 's doing things with object variables would it be a method . 
  ( could be wrong , though , i 've never really looked into the technical differences in terminology . ), 
  some guy who can only bend stairs , and only while in los angeles or laos . 
  ah ... well in that case i have * no * idea what the difference between a procedure , subroutine , or function is , or is meant to be . 
  the only thing i know is that methods are what you call it when it 's in a class in a oop language . 
  so , perhaps a bit niche for here , but this really put a smile on my face . 
  arirang is sort of the national song of korea , going back centuries ( and thus , from before the two countries were split ) -- it 's sort of like waltzing matilda is to australia , though obviously much older . 
  seeing musicians from the two countries coming together to play it was just beautiful . 
  [ here 's the / r/classicalmusic thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/2q19sz/north_korean_and_south_korean_musicians_playing/ ) . 
  oh thanks for this . 
  lack of emoji support in chrome is one of the major reasons i decided to try firefox again recently ( since it does support them ) . 
  that experiment ended up in total failure , since firefox has really fallen behind in so many other ways , but i missed having working emoji when i gave up and went back to chrome . 
  for the lazy , [ here 's a link to chromoji ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromoji-hangouts-edition/fgaiicnhcohdgegabomljlkheilficfd?hl=en-gb ) in the chrome store . 
  wait , that 's what you meant by tinsel :\\, 
  i have no idea what a garland is . 
  i 've always had tinsel that 's long bits of colourful stuff , that looks [ kinda like this ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_uivdyutnyua/sw3pj4qraxi/aaaaaaaaanc/k2i7o_9-1fs/s1600/tinsel+red+n+gold.png ) , and wraps around the tree a few times . 
  very good point . 
  multiple times . 
   that in would mean having to put some of the sled chase back into the film for continuity 's sake, 
  it 's been a while since i 've seen the film , and i have n't actually tried the edit , but my thought was just to put the very first few seconds of it , and then cut to him arriving there .
