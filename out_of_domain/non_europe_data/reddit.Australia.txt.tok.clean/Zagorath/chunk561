  anyway , regarding the torrent thing , if you want some help with it just ask . 
  i can provide a step-by-step instruction guide no problem . 
  at the very least , the conductor was south korean . 
  also i 'm pretty sure i saw some white guys in the orchestra , so i do n't think i 'd trust that description too much . 
  do n't go back in time and fuck it up . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://cdn.buzznet.com/assets/users15/petesbabiii/default/gave-her-12-roses-11real--large-msg-117414203484.jpg ) . 
   for you ` muricans, 
  and , you know , the entire rest of the world apart from sweden ( and maybe denmark , since the word there is tr\u00e6 -- kinda similar ) . 
  i 'm glad i 'm not the only one who thought of dragon age templars while reading this . 
  i see your girlfriend knows your reddit account . 
  yeah i really do wish we did n't have to protect kids from the number 6 . 
  it 's just going to stunt their education later on . 
  as others have said , i use both . 
  wired mouse on my desktop , trackpad on my laptop , except when gaming or video editing on said laptop . 
  oh that makes sense . 
  should be pretty easy to remember , too , since it 's the same as a mathematical function . 
  thanks !, 
  seriously . 
  the romance has been the worst thing about korra since the first season . 
  and it still is the worst thing in the last episode . 
  i wan na focus on the themes , the action , the music , etc. , but all that conversation is completely overshadowed by talk about this fucking ship . 
  i kinda liked the way they were leading on with zhu lee and varrick , until he suddenly proposed out of the blue in the last episode . 
  that felt forced . 
  i kinda like how they did opal/bolin . 
  thought that relationship was done perfectly . 
  jinora/kai was cute , but i wish they had n't completely ignored it this season . 
  but every relationship korra has been in throughout the show has just been horrible , imo . 
  the mako-bolin/korra stuff of the first two seasons ( and also the asami/mako stuff ) was the worst thing the avatar universe has ever come up with . 
  similarly , it felt to me like they did a poor job leading in to korra/asami , though at least it was infinitely better than the first two seasons . 
  take a look at some courses on coursera . 
  there 's some really great stuff in there . 
  there 's also cs50x , which is run by harvard , i think . 
  you can sign up for free , and you have the entire year to do the work . 
  which reminds me , i should get back to working on that . 
  i still have n't finished problem set 3 ... 
  really ? 
  i loved eclipse from the very first time i used it . 
  admittedly , all i was using it for was debugging python , rather than having to put print statements everywhere . 
  but that ( and the autocompletion ) was easily enough to love it and prefer it to what i was using before . 
  haha malukah is exactly who i was gon na recommend . 
  after her popularity doing fan music for skyrim , she actually got hired by zenimax online to do [ music for elder scrolls online ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gysf-axehbk ) . 
  i know it 's popular to hate on eclipse , but when the only thing you have to compare it to is idle , hell yeah i loved it . 
  icelandic does seem to have a word with a similar root . 
  never heard of it before just now . 
  public barbies , paid for by the city council . 
  at least in seq. 
  it 's brilliant . 
  somehow , everyone treats them with respect and clean up after themselves , does n't damage them , etc. 
  i 'm just curious , how old is your daughter . 
  mainly , are the two close enough in age to be friends ? 
   whereas in australia it would cost almost 20 aud, 
  so , i have n't actually looked into seeing the hobbit in australia , since i 'm overseas at the moment , but at my preferred cinema in brisbane , i can see most big films in 3d for $ 10 . 
  you forgot atheist . 
  but yeah , i would say every * individual * is that , until proved otherwise , but collective statements have a broader audience . 
  outlawing encryption entirely would be absolutely impossible . 
  you could never use your bank 's website , or read your email without people on the same wifi connection being able to snoop . 
  using government certificates only would be more feasible , but still really difficult for a country that 's trying to at least maintain the guise of freedom . 
  accessing websites from other countries , for example , would have to be completely insecure , unless the organisation you 're trying to access is big enough that they care to bother to get a certificate from a foreign government . 
  ( part of ) the reason japan is famous for its weird porn is that the weird porn is actually a way to get around the requirements to censor genitalia . 
  do n't have to censor tentacles . 
   redundant | r\u026a\u02c8d\u028cnd ( \u0259 ) nt | adjective, 
  not or no longer needed or useful ; superfluous : * an appropriate use for a redundant church | many of the old skills had become redundant . 
  judging from your username , i suspect you 're involved with computers and programming in some way . 
  so you 're probably more used to the engineering definition of redundant . 
   ` engineering ` ( of a component ) not strictly necessary to functioning but included in case of failure in another component . 
  * the modules are linked using a redundant fibre-optic cable . 
  but / u/arancaytar 's use of it was perfectly correct by the more general definition . 
  i prefer the rule `` i before e except most of the time '' . 
   if blood was blue without oxygen , it would be blue in the needle , but it is not . 
  i imagine most people who believe that myth just assume blood is taken from arteries , rather than veins . 
  ( or , more likely , they never really thought it through very far . ), 
  not anymore , actually . 
  google forked the webkit project to create their own engine called [ blink ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blink_\\ ( layout_engine \\ ) ) . 
  new york should be the capital of the us . 
  this joke is a lot less effective for electrical engineers . 
   j do n't think j could . 
  my absolute favourite few teachers have been ones who 've done this . 
  it just seems to be a trait of really good teachers . 
  man i do n't even know who numbers 1 -- 5 and 8 -- 10 * are * . 
  so i would n't have cared if they 're australian or otherwise . 
  yeah got ta be honest , i probably would n't have been interested in seeing it if it were n't for all the controversy . 
  as it is , i kinda wan na see it just out of morbid curiosity . 
  but i could n't find it within two searches on torrent sites , so i gave up , because it was n't worth any more effort than that . 
  you should deliberately set it to appear at a random time between midnight and 4 am , just to fuck with them . 
  that 's 1.5 hours for those of us who prefer not to use magic time . 
  haha this is awesome . 
  but can i just say , i 'm loving this influx of oc we 've been getting the last few days . 
  yeah , i like that they have the ability to do this , but it really should be an option you can turn off . 
  heck , i 'd even be okay with it being the default setting , but certain groups of people are going to need to be able to turn it off . 
  i do n't know , but you may want to ask [ tolkien ] ( http://corecanvas.s3.amazonaws.com/theonering-0188db0e/gallery/original/war_in_middle_earth_map.jpg ) ( particularly looking at fangorn ) and the [ creators of dnd ] ( http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v235/paladin_20xx/d%20and%20d%20campaign/northswordcoast_playerversion-zf-5692-67223-1-006.jpg ) ( particularly the kryptgarden forest ) . 
  point is , sure it may not be completely scientifically accurate , but it 's something that many world builders have done before . 
  you can probably argue `` magic '' or `` gods '' , or something like that , for why it happens . 
  ah fair enough . 
  i was n't aware . 
  ah fair enough . 
  i was n't aware . 
  did people with that setting unchecked not get the automatic update yesterday ? 
  yup . 
  wan na tell us about her ? 
  huh that 's really interesting .
