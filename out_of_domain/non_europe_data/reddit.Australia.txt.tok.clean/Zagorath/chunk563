  the second spoiler ( season 2 spoilers ) : [ like how she lost her connection with her past lives , but found rava again ... '' ] ( / spoiler ) not really that complicated . 
  [ in the season 2 finale , raava was mostly destroyed , and with it , the connection to the past avatars was destroyed . 
  ] ( / spoiler ) , however , [ when jinora helped her find that last remaining piece of raava that was within vaatu , she was able to connect with it . 
  the connection with raava was still there , but the past avatars were destroyed . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  my problem with the season was just that ... well , most of the episodes felt pretty meh to me , especially after season 3 's awesomeness . 
  i ca n't really point at anything specific . 
  as someone said [ in another thread ] ( / r/thelastairbender/comments / 2prhc8/b4e12 _ the_finale_wasnt_as_epic_as_tla_and_i_think / cmzcron ) , this season was a bit like a coda to the series . 
  kinda like the scouring of the shire in the lord of the rings . 
  heh , why not . 
  i love the eberron world . 
  it 's fallen out of fashion ? 
  huh , i did n't know that . 
  my current ongoing campaign is set in eberron . 
  also , you might like [ this story ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) . 
  eberron is never explicitly mentioned , but it 's pretty clearly set in an eberron-like world . 
  so , the story never explicitly mentions eberron , but the amount of magitek stuff in the story strongly implies that it 's an eberron-like world . 
  it 's an extremely long story , but trust me , it 's totally worth it . 
  probably want to take it a few entries at a time , though . 
  read it over a couple of days . 
  i know the macquarie dictionary is a really big deal on aus . 
  personally , though , i still hold the oxford dictionary of english in the highest regard . 
  if it does n't include some reference to something , as far as i 'm concerned it 's probably wrong . 
  ( including with us english , since the oed also contains american english words . ), 
  yeah , first one is windows and os x only . 
  green lantern ? 
  yes please . 
  but not hal jordan . 
  three words . 
  got ta be honest , i * never * found doge funny . 
  it 's incredibly condescending to whoever it 's being used in reply to . 
  but i 'm not even a little bit tired of this joke . 
  i know it 's old and been massively overplayed , but it still gets a good laugh out of me every time . 
  rule 1 of comics , nobody is ever * really * dead . 
  christmas is not much more religious than hallowe'en , really . 
  yes it 's got the christian aspect to it , but most of the celebration is entirely secular . 
  merry christmas grey and brady !, 
  my answer is what the fuck is eggnog ? 
  i hear people talking about it in movies and tv shows frequently , especially around chrissy , but i 've never actually seen it in real life , let alone actually tasted it . 
   does that do it for you , brady, 
  when you said that , grey , it sounded creepily sexual . 
   perfect balance of consistency , but also mystery, 
  that is a perfect explanation of tolkien 's universe . 
  you think you had problems with trying to buy tickets ? 
  [ you should try the site that i was on trying to book tickets . ] ( http://lottecinemavn.com/en-us/rap-phim/ho-chi-minh/cantavil.aspx ) . 
  first of all , the drop down options just do n't work half the time . 
  i 'll select the cinema ( cantavil ) , and then the option to select the movie is supposed to start working . 
  but i only once managed to get that to work . 
  once that finally did decide to work , i went through the process , until i got to the point of selecting which seats i wanted . 
  i selected the two seats i wanted , and it gave some pop up saying that the seats need to be contiguous . 
  they * were * contiguous . 
  i tried moving them into a bunch of different locations , before i discovered it would only work if they were against the left-most edge of the screen . 
  went and had a look at the html on the page . 
  the comments on it ( thankfully they did n't mininfy it ) made it seem that what they were trying to do was prevent you from booking seats that are n't contiguous . 
  they just buggered up the javascript code . 
  a feature that they just * really * did ** not ** need to have at all , and its buggy implementation meant i could n't properly order tickets at all . 
  want to point out that bilbo 's stone throwing thing is actually kinda canon . 
  his stone throwing is supposed to be really op . 
  i actually thought the moment where they used that in the film was just an awesome nod to the original source material . 
  i really thought that the hobbit 3 was by far the best of the three films . 
  i liked the other two a lot more than you guys did , but definitely thought they had huge problems . 
  i did n't actually have * any * problem with this one as i left the cinema . 
  but i agree with some of your specific problems . 
  legolas was definitely too sombre and did n't really need to be there . 
  it would 've been nice to have some resolution to the politics surrounding the battle . 
  the battle going on as long as it did and having people just keep popping up is a bit of a problem . 
  even there , i think all the problems had good justifications . 
  the aragorn reference had me squealing like a schoolgirl ( in my head , at least ) . 
  one of the biggest criticisms of the original trilogy was the half dozen false endings to rotk . 
  if they had included the politics stuff , that would have added a false ending . 
  i thought they actually did a really good job , and did n't really have any false endings to speak of . 
  the battle itself , i really enjoyed . 
  i do n't know why ; i found the action sequences in both the other hobbit films too long by a huge margin , but i just thought this one did it really well . 
  we actually * do * know that north korea absolutely has the capability to undertake a fairly strong cyberattack . 
  that 's one factor that is n't in question . 
  they certainly * could * have done it . 
  schneier even points this out . 
  he just questions whether , in fact , they * did * do it . 
  i never thought it was over the line . 
  it 's a harmless little joke . 
  honestly , i think a big part of this argument may stem from the differences in australian/british humour and american humour ( or humor , if you prefer ) . 
   nor have i seen the lotr movies nor have i seen the star wars movies, 
  you need to fix this . 
  i 'm gon na guess that they recorded it before the 16th december . 
  just googled that . 
  [ not what i expected to see . 
  ] ( http://swimsuit.si.com/swimsuit/assets/media/gallery/cook-islands/chrissy-teigen/op44-208847-raw1200.jpg ), 
  also ( most of ) australia , and many us states . 
  and much of europe and asia . 
  maybe she 's in new zealand and got it yesterday ? 
  still probably a bit presumptive . 
  actually , 16 is aoc is 31 us states . 
  just 'cause it 's legal does n't mean it 's not creepy . 
  interestingly , just as mardi comes from the roman god if war , tuesday comes from the t\u00fdr , the norse god of single combat , victory and heroic glory .

  the breathalyser 's all they ever use in australia . 
  i really do n't understand why they would want to use anything else . 
  i absolutely love korean . 
  it 's one of my favourite languages to listen to . 
  unfortunately , in the three years i lived in korea , i learnt numbers , how to order some basic food , and how to direct a taxi .
