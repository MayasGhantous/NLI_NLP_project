  just got ta substitute one soft consonant for another . 
  so , i 'm stuck on 3g at the moment , so i ca n't watch the video , but the title made me think it was a music video about eberron . 
  that was amusing . 
  but could you provide me with a little of the context in which he discusses eberron ? 
  like , is he talking about what they 're working on for 5e with it , or about its history and creation , or its inspirations etc. 
  lol what ? 
  i 've been upgraded to business class a few times , and i almost only ever fly international . 
  maybe things are different in `` the land of the free '' . 
  so , i do n't have the * strongest * aussie accent , but i definitely say / d\u0292\u025bf / . 
  / d\u0292ef / seems like more of a kiwi accent , to me . 
  wow this is a lovely photo . 
  i love the framing of it . 
  really nice balance . 
  would you mind sharing what focal length you had it set to ? 
  is it a panorama ?

  i 'm * really * not a fan of mmp , because of the formalisation of parties . 
  the system we use in australia is , at its base , a really good one . 
  it 's just that we 've decided to add a whole heap of crud on to it , like requiring numbering * every * candidate ( stv does n't need that -- you should be able to number 1 to however many you want , and then stop ) and the system we have for `` above the line '' votes ( where you tick 1 for your preferred party , and the votes get distributed how that party wants -- there are some really good ways that this could be changed to make things better for the voters , or it could be removed entirely , but the current system is awful ) . 
  still , both of our systems are * sooo * much better than the first past the post used in the states and the uk . 
  it really boggles my mind that they can put up with it . 
  the difference between fptp and anything else is really significant , compared to the relatively academic difference between all the others . 
  haha , sorry for the rant . 
  the intricacies of voting systems is something that really interests me . 
  he was an arsehole , yes , and an elitist , absolutely . 
  and calling him a crok is not * necessarily * wrong , as long as you know where it 's targetted -- if you 're talking about parc or just about anything in the 2000s , you 're clearly misunderstanding something . 
  if you 're talking about how he ripped of woz , then yup , he basically stole from the poor guy . 
  but despite all that , he absolutely * was * a visionary . 
  he was n't a fantastic technical guy or even designer ( though he * was * good at both of those ) , but he was very good at knowing what sort of products people would want to use , and he was * extremely * good at getting people together and helping them to make them . 
  from woz with early apple , to people like johnny ives and phil schiller in 2000s apple , helping to direct them to create products like the apple ii , the ipod , and the iphone -- the latter two of which basically * invented * their product category ( yes , similar products existed before them , but in each case , they were relatively obscure and generally poorly designed ) . 
  oh man , as much as it would annoy me for tipping to be basically mandatory , it would piss me off * so * much more to have prices all advertised falsely by excluding tax . 
  what size paper is that ? 
  what font and font-size ? 
  i 'm gon na assume a4 at 12pt verdana ( or possibly arial/helvetica ) , but hey , you could probably fit it on far fewer pages if you had 6pt font on a0 paper . 
  yeah i do n't know why it is , but i absolutely love this . 
  an airbender ... '' thing got boring to me pretty quickly , and i never found doge even the slightest bit funny . 
  but this one is still just as funny to me -- if not more funny -- as when i first saw it shortly before the last episode . 
   '' \u0292a\u026af '', 
  and, 
   `` jaif '', 
  these guys are clearly [ idea channel viewers ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwtcgsrgvsi ) . 
  i like how we pronounce nasa with the same `` a '' as in `` aeronautics '' , and `` gats '' has the same g as in `` general '' . 
  so it with a hard g if you really want to ( even though it sounds horrible ) , but do n't defend it with this bullshit argument . 
   there is no `` wrong '' with language, 
  yes there is . 
  there is n't in this case ( both hard and soft g are correct ) , but there are absolutely things that are wrong . 
  it is n't correct to write `` aye em on thee intanet '' . 
  such a sentence is just wrong , even though anyone can read it and understand what i meant by it . 
  edit : so , i 've just noticed that this comment has generated the `` controversial '' indicator . 
  apparently enough people disagree enough to downvote me for this comment . 
  anyone who downvoted or otherwise disagrees care to explain their opinion ? 
  so far no one 's replied , but it seems to me that my comment was pretty blatantly correct ... 
  i 've never heard psd pronounced pissed , but i like it . 
  and i feel that not enough people know png is meant to be pronounced ping . 
  hahaha . 
  you can always expect to get a lot of responses when the survey is both extremely easy to fill out , and extremely divisive ( people are more likely to care enough to fill it out if they know a lot of people will have the opposite `` wrong '' opinion to them ) . 
  wow i 'm loving these !, 
  absolutely brilliant compositions . 
  i might actually have to use some of them . 
  i only wish i could have afforded to pay more than i did . 
  thanks so much for offering these up !, 
  any chance you can point us towards some of the games that you 've composed for ? 
  also , as a fellow composer ( though i do it only as a personal hobby ) , i do n't suppose you could share some of the sibelius scores ( i notice you said elsewhere that you wrote them up in sibelius for musicians ) ? 
  i 'd really like to have the opportunity to study them for personal use . 
   if he does n't like them he should n't review them, 
  well , good thing he did n't review it , then . 
  he just made a passing comment about it in this video , by way of explaining why it does n't qualify for his top 5 lists . 
  okay so i just went through that iama because i thought it was cool . 
  and it was , but i just want to point out [ this exchange ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/glt5k/iam_yahtzee_croshaw_off_of_the_escapists_zero/c1ojd7o?context=2 ) . 
  holy fuck , cgp grey is a fan of yahtzee . 
  and this is from right when he was starting out on youtube . 
  he only had three of his grey-style videos up at the time . 
  just thought that was cool . 
  so , completely and totally off topic here , but in another thread i got a link to the ama yahtzee croshaw ( of zero punctuation ) did a few years back . 
  reading through that , i saw that you had made a comment in it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/glt5k/iam_yahtzee_croshaw_off_of_the_escapists_zero/c1ojd7o?context=2 ) . 
  i just thought that was really cool to see . 
  you a zp fan ? 
  well-known youtuber . 
  does informative videos . 
  here 's his [ youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/cgpgrey ) . 
  also has a subreddit at / r/cgpgrey ( which makes for a better comment section than below the youtube video ) . 
  you may have seen [ the difference between the united kingdom , great britain and england explained ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnu8xdbsn10 ) or [ what are continents ? ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ubcq1x7p34 ) . 
  ( and if you have n't already , they 're probably some of his best videos , and they 're definitely worth watching . ), 
  no , the insert option * does * require insertion . 
  most of the developed world has been using chip 'n' pin for quite a few years now , which involves inserting the card in , just like the picture in the bottom right of the screen in this image shows . 
  only more recently have visa paywave and mastercard paypass come into the scene , which work with this same standard , but allow you to tap to pay using rfid instead . 
  it 's just that because america has been so behind on getting chip 'n' pin , that you guys are getting both that and paywave at the same time , so i can see how it would be easy to conflate the two . 
  it 's not free if you want to get it legally , but [ screenflow ] ( http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm ) is absolutely amazing . 
  it gives you total flexibility over how and what you 're recording ( for example , you can turn on your webcam if you want , or you can have either on-computer audio , microphone audio , both , or neither ) , and includes a pretty good editor that you can use to edit your videos . 
  i tend to only use this for a few very preliminary edits ( like how the pip webcam shows ) before moving to my preferred dedicated editor . 
  it 's not free or cheap -- if you want to get it legally -- but it is * very * good , and if it 's your job ( or even a significant part-time income ) , and you want to keep everything above board , then it 's probably worth it . 
  i think i remember that . 
  was in one of the really early his , yeah ? 
  yay for the yowie !, 
  [ i miss the yowie chocolates , though :( ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yowie_ ( chocolate \\ ) ), 
  oh man , i loved these books when i read them !, 
  i was 13 at the time , though , and already they felt a little bit too young , so i never finished the series , even though i loved the stories and characters . 
  great series , and i 'd highly recommend it for people looking for rangers . 
  just do n't go in expecting the greatest literature .
