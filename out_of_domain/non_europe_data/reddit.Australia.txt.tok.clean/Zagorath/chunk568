  hey , if you want to add a little more formatting to your post , i 've just added some css so that if you put '' **** '' on a line by itself between two lines beginning with ''  '' , it 'll make it look kinda like a paragraph . 
   the quick brown fox, 
   jumps over, 
   the lazy dog, 
  becomes :, 
   the quick brown fox, 
   jumps over, 
   the lazy dog, 
  just to make it a little more readable . 
  ( and if anyone wants to put an actual `` hr '' line , just use **** on two separate lines . ), 
  cambodia is n't some super-undeveloped country like some parts of sub-saharan africa , nor is it under an especially large amount of censorship , like north korea or eritrea . 
  it 's just a run-of-the-mill east asian developing country , even if it is one of the poorer ones in the region , it 's still easily developed enough that jokes about people not having internet access do n't really work very well . 
   2d4 reach finesse ? 
  so , that sounds pretty reasonable to me , though i would n't consider myself especially versed in weapon design in roleplaying games . 
  but here 's a thought , perhaps when you use that extra reach , you lose the finesse . 
  seems to make sense . 
  the weapon becomes less wieldy when used at a longer range . 
  just a thought . 
  man , fucking poe should just go fuck himself . 
  i prefer `` to punish my brother and i '' . 
  some '' / \u0292a\u026af / `` s , some `` gee , eye , eff `` s , including one guy who seems to think that * all * file types should be pronounced as initialisms , rather than acronyms . 
  op posted a complete list of the `` other '' responses further up the thread . 
   `` g - i - f. all file formats are pronounced as acronyms , even though everyone seems to not know this . '', 
  you 're not this guy , are you ? 
  i agree that gif should be pronounced with a soft g. chiefly , it 's a technical word that was coined by a person ( i.e. , it does n't have a sort of `` natural '' etymology ) and that 's how he says it should be pronounced . 
  also , the soft g is just a much nicer sound . 
  but your reasoning is very lacking , i feel . 
  words of latin/greek origin with gi - might always be soft g. i do n't know if that 's correct or not , but i feel that even if it is , it 's not really applicable here . 
  sure , `` graphics interchange format '' may all be words of latin/greek origin ( again , i do n't know if that 's correct or not ) , but the coined term `` gif '' is its own word . 
  it does n't even contain significant portions of the words it stands for . 
  i do n't think the origin of the words an acronym stands for really plays any role in how said acronym is pronounced . 
  this argument seems pretty much the same to me as the one that says `` gif should be hard g because it stands for graphical , which has a hard g '' . 
  which is also a bogus argument . 
  which is two nouns ( a subject and an object ) and two adjectives describing the objective noun . 
  rondo ? 
  to me , that one sounds like a name with the same properties as `` grunka '' . 
  more importantly , i do n't think it 's about showing where people * do * typically walk , so much as where people * can * walk . 
  i just wan na know why you used camelcase there . 
  i always forget that the original iphone did n't support apps at first . 
  it was n't until the 3g and the release of the app store that the iphone was ever sold outside america . 
  intelligence is knowing frankenstein was not the monster . 
  wisdom is knowing that frankenstein truly * was * the monster . 
  no way . 
  charisma is the most fun . 
  you can have all the npcs eating out of the palm of your hand . 
  diplomacy , intimidate , and bluff are the most fun skills to use . 
  the best stats . 
  i 've seen it once on reddit before , but i do n't think it 's very widely used . 
  i have no idea what you 're on about . 
  til frankenstein 's monster in the original novel was familiar with the book of genesis . 
  that 's canon . 
  i mean , it is * a * canon , though certainly when refering to frankenstein in the general sense , it 's not * the * canon . 
  sort of like how wicked and its sequels are * a * canon , but a completely separate canon from l. frank baum 's oz books . 
  i go one step further . 
  i occasionally just click on an add that i do n't even care about , because clickthrough rates play a significant role in ad revenue . 
  haha actually my current character is int/cha ( a psychic psion ) . 
  i just think that for roleplaying purposes ( i.e. , out of combat stuff ) , charisma and dexterity tend to make for the most fun experiences . 
  that depends . 
  5th edition recommends cha & con , while 4th recommends cha & str for dragon sorcerers , and cha & dex for chaos sorcerers . 
  either one , really . 
  depends on whether you prefer diplomacy or bluff . 
  i love 4th . 
  it 's what my group plays , and i do n't see myself playing anything else at least until 5th has a fair bit more content . 
  but i 'm preparing to dm a 5th game for a group of complete newbies , and one of them is going to be playing a chaos sorcerer , so i 've been reading up on that . 
  and heck yeah it is awesome . 
  i love the idea of rolling on the random table occasionally for random effects after they cast a spell . 
  ninjaedit : just looked it up . 
  i misremembered the name , it 's called a `` wild magic '' sorcerer that i was thinking of . 
  as far as i can tell it 's the same thing as 4th 's chaos sorcerer , though . 
  especially since 4th suggests chaos sorcerers take the `` wild magic '' class feature . 
  [ kinda reminds me of this story ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) . 
  as a psychic psion , i heartily approve of your methods . 
  you should probably share whether it uses python 2.7 or python 3 . 
  the two are incompatible . 
  sounds like the setting for legend of korra . 
  6 months `` game-mat-making programme guy . 
  did she deliver ? '', 
  fixed !, 
  ( though the bot wo n't update its message . ), 
  what i love about this quote is that there are kinda two ways of looking at it . 
  one is that the wisdom is that because so many people call the monster `` frankenstein '' , then because of that , the wise thing to do is to just call the monster frankenstein . 
  the other is ( perhaps the more obvious interpretation ) that in creating the monster , and his treatment of it after it was created , victor frankenstein was a monster . 
  yeah that 's why i only do it occasionally , to make it seem like real clicks . 
  so , i never read the books of those , but i saw the first movie . 
  it was bad , but not terrible , ignoring the source material . 
  however , i 've heard it was * really * bad for those who have read the books . 
  which raises the question , how the * hell * did this one get sequels ? 
  avatar did n't , and neither did eragon or tomorrow , when the war began . 
  that 's what happens when you make a terrible film adaption , they do n't let you make more . 
  so which idiot decided to greenlight further percy jackson movies ? 
  and then he just rips the ending out of the lord of the rings and leaves the continent , except unlike lotr , in this they do it for ** no fucking reason ** . 
  i loved the magic system in the first book . 
  but it kinda got really weird , and he largely ignored the basic `` it places the same toll on your body that doing it yourself would '' rule . 
  the technical writing might get better as it goes on , but if you ask me the narrative gets worse and worse . 
  you jest , but that could be a pretty nice plot point . 
  at least , if it was n't basically the same as the last two movies . 
  yeah , it 's like game of thrones in that way . 
  trying to make a movie out now each book in a song of ice and fire would just never work . 
  plus , avatar is * already * a tv show . 
  who needs a movie based on a tv show ?
