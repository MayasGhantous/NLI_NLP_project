  that explains both points a and b. 
  in my private subreddit , i had upvoted the post ( by default , on account of it being my post ) , but not in the public one . 
  i dunno , i think if i were black i might be offended by being called `` black or asian '' . 
  sorry , could n't resist . 
  it 's clearly [ beethoven 's piano sonata no . 
  23 in f minor , op . 
  57 `` appassionata '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypr3pkcnbki ) , transcribed for orchestra . 
  [ it looks like you 're right ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equale ) , mostly . 
   three equali for four trombones of ludwig van beethoven ... two of them were later performed , with the addition ... of words from the miserere , at beethoven 's own funeral in 1827 . 
  you 've got me convinced . 
  / eyetwitch, 
  dude , i 'm pretty sure stratocaster was the right answer , there , not choppin . 
   everyone who has gotten the joke have been posting the most ridiculous imaginary or the most obscure real pieces, 
  or they 've been submitting other pieces with the same/similar motives ( e.g. 
  beethoven 's appassionata , beethoven 's 10th violin concerto , and in c -- motives 1 and 7 , particularly ) . 
  sort of like `` near misses '' . 
  the boccherini is what i organised a group to play when i was in high school and asked to get a group to play some fancy music at the graduation ceremony of the year above me . 
  you may want to take a look through [ this list ] ( http://kickassclassical.com//classical-music-popular-famous-best-top-100-list.html ) . 
  particularly , if you sort by keyword , then the ones categorised as `` formal '' . 
  and since you 're talking os x , it should also be noted that you use option , not control , to go one word at a time . 
  that 'll delete a whole line at a time . 
  option-backspace is what does single words at a time . 
  his problem is that fcp x auto-saves continually . 
  cmd-s does nothing , because there 's no need to manually save . 
   everything but saving and collaborating . 
  ftfy, 
  my tip is to do all the writing in google drive , then copy paste to a better programme when you need to get the formatting done . 
  of course , at this point , someone usually comes along to tell us that all formatting should be done in latex or you 're doing it wrong . 
  personally i 've never thought it worth the effort . 
  uhh ... this is n't actually something that makes premiere better . 
  fcp x is auto-saving continually , so there 's no need for manually saving . 
  the guy was just talking about how that means that the reflex he 's built up ca n't be sated because he 's now got auto-saving . 
  by the same token , as ctrl-tab moves between tabs in your browser , ctrl-shift-tab moves backwards between tabs . 
  same deal with alt-tab and alt-shift-tab . 
  the n is because ctrl-n is `` new window '' and ctrl-shift-n is basically `` new window for shifty things '' . 
  in all seriousness , just change `` for shifty things '' to `` with some special properties '' , and that 's more or less where the shortcut comes from . 
  how does ` vimdiff ` differ from just using ` diff ` ? 
   some computers have it the other way around ( which is a stupid design decision , imo ), 
  the best decision is to give users a choice in the matter . 
  both os x and the bootcamp utility in windows let you set whether the f keys act as f keys or to control things like brightness , keyboard backlight , etc. 
  when fn is not held down , and then makes it do the other thing with fn pressed . 
  pretty handy , really . 
  in general , on os x , having the fn keys do their special function is pretty * clearly * the better option , since the f keys are n't all that frequently used for keyboard shortcuts . 
  in windows on most computers , i 'd say having the f keys be f keys is pretty clearly the best option , since the media buttons rarely work as you 'd want them to . 
  when using windows on a mac , though , it 's a bet less cut and dry . 
  either one is good , depending on how you personally use the computer . 
  wait , dr. pepper is a product of 7up ? 
  does that make dr. pepper a product of pepsi , by the transitive property , since pepsi owns 7up ? 
  yeah i 'm pretty sure mountain dew does n't exist outside of america . 
  i know i 've never seen it outside of tv . 
  you know what `` us as a society '' would do if we * really * wanted to `` prove society is still good '' ? 
  not murder people through the court system . 
  one might say `` a bygone age '' . 
  hmm that 's an interesting one . 
  ca n't say i 've heard it before . 
  i have heard `` as old as the hills '' , and even `` as old as the grave '' ( the latter usually being in the context of a person 's age ) , but never lizards . 
  i * have * heard lizards used in `` flat out like a lizard drinking '' , which is a really fun expression . 
  i have literally never heard anyone say what either of those stand for , and i do follow the news . 
  i 'm pretty confident that the first is in each of them is `` islamic state '' , because i 've heard it called that before , as well as being called just `` is '' , but i have no idea what the rest of it stands for , or why there 's a distinction between is , isis , and isil . 
  from the sounds of it he 's playing a custom-built race , not the standard dragonborn . 
  it might be very different in terms of its mechanics and flavour to the standard dragonborn -- it may only share its visual design . 
  i 've just recently started using boot camp for the first time , in order to play some age of mythology with friends . 
  highly recommend that game , heaps of fun . 
  if you do n't want to boot camp , i 'd say the civilisation series is a great one . 
  civ v with its expansion packs , in particular . 
  yeah i was thinking the same thing , really . 
  i 'm not the op , i 'm just assuming based on what he 's written . 
  but it might not just be flavour , might also be some stat stuff . 
  still , it does seem like an unusual solution when the description sounds almost identical to what 's already in the phb . 
  in who ? 
  i love tun . 
  wish he put out videos more often . 
  just a tip , in the future , when you 're unsure whether a site is down for everyone or just you , try going to http://isup.me/sitename.com , replacing sitename.com with the domain name of the site . 
  i agree . 
  it only looks like volunteer because of how it looks back to the open mouthed `` i '' . 
  it is ? 
  last i heard its network was saying they probably did n't want to share a universe . 
  if you have n't already , i 'd highly recommend watching his video on elder scroll 6 , if you have any interest in that franchise . 
  ah right . 
  i had never heard of it before . 
  good game ? 
  precisely . 
  i always * hated * completing the square as a method for doing quadratic equations in high school . 
  remembering the formula , or factorising where possible was just so much simpler . 
  but then i got to university and we got a particular type of problem ( i ca n't remember what , now ) that required the use of completing the square in order to get it done . 
  so i relearnt that method , and the problems became so much easier . 
  if he had used the more common term `` black box '' , would that have helped ? 
  any table that does n't home rule away official dnd elvish and replace it with quenya or sindarin ( written in tengwar ) is doing it wrong . 
  okay , i do n't know what pbs is ( unless it 's related to the pbs idea channel youtube channel ) , but i 'm pretty sure sherlock is a bbc show ... 
  interesting article , though . 
  i 'm really not a fan of outright lying like that . 
  it 's too dishonest . 
  if they wanted to misdirect us by pointing out other things that * are * there ( which in turn * implies * there wo n't be khan/lazarus pit/whatever ) that 'd be one thing , but outright saying `` x will not be used in this show to revive oliver '' or `` x character is not in this movie '' and then turning around and doing exactly that really rubs me the wrong way . 
  edit : fixed autocorrect pcs idea channel -  pbs idea channel, 
  i do n't know if that 's a problem . 
  it seems to be that methods use camel case and variables use underscores . 
  it 's consistent . 
  taking it out of the for loop entirely should n't be necessary ever , unless the following syntax does n't work in the language , i guess . 
  for ( int i = 0 , l = list.length ; i < l ; + + i ), 
  : % s/varraible/variable / g,
