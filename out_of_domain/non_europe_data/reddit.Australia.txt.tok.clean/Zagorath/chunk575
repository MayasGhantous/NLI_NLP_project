  this is especially good if sold to the party for a price that 's too good to be true by a shady merchant . 
  edit : accidentally left out the `` shady merchant '' bit . 
  do you roll 1d6 twice ? 
  ( and thus have the risk of either healing or damaging up to 5 hp . ), 
  or is it rolled once , and in fact has no effect ? 
  vehemently disagree with the anti-4e circlejerk , but i 'm sick of hearing all the bullshit justifications for it , so i 'm not going to address that part . 
  what i will say is that i really agree with your last paragraph . 
  i like what they 've done with 5e thus far , but it 's lacking in content , just purely as a result of being new . 
  i 'm hoping more stuff gets added pretty quickly . 
  to copy and paste from [ a previous conversation i had ] ( / r/dnd/comments / 2ro3c2/5th _ edition_what_are_your_criticisms / cnkecrc?context = 3 ), 
   i think the idea that the edition starts out really simple -- a clone of middle earth , as you say -- just feels like the right way to go about things , but i do really hope that they can expand it really nicely very soon . 
  i 'd hope to hear at least some serious rumours about the second player 's handbook by the end of the year . 
  this goes for both races and classes , for what it 's worth . 
  i 'm hoping to see the psion ( along with other psionic classes ) , along with the aforementioned spellsword class and warlord , and some sort of blackguard ( because `` oathbreaker '' is n't the same as someone who makes an oath that 's evil ) . 
  i 'm in a very similar position to you . 
  in my second 4e campaign , and i really like 5e , but want to wait until there 's a greater variety of classes and races . 
  in particular , i 'm interested in seeing psions and other psionics classes , as well as all the races you mention apart from mul ( just because i do n't know what that one is -- i do n't have anything against it ) . 
  i 'd also like some more `` dark '' focussed things , like a blackguard ( a paladin who * plans * to be evil and takes an evil oath , rather than one who tries to be good but breaks the oath ) and a bunch of stuff similar to 4e 's heroes of shadow ( vampire class and vryloka race especially ) . 
  5e is a great game , but it lacks the awesome variety 4e has , and that 's important to me . 
  but it 's only new so far , and a more tolkienesque feel is probably the right way to start , before they expand it later . 
  i just hope they * do * expand it sufficiently at a reasonable rate . 
  wow cool . 
  i 'll have to give it a look !, 
  or , option c , they could take the phylactery and use it as leverage against the lich . 
  blackmail it to work for the party . 
  you could try reviving it !, 
  / r/eberron was only created/revived three weeks ago and it 's now a healthy small sub . 
  wan na share some of the world 's lore and history ? 
  or is that still a wip ? 
  any relation to malcolm ? 
  who can blame you ? 
  it 's the last name of a real person who 's a rather prominent figure . 
  too noisy . 
  shovel to the head us much more discreet . 
   didnt effect a thing, 
  this is a brilliant typo . 
  in a way , given the actual meaning of `` effect '' as a verb , it kinda fits . 
  not if you also want to be able to go places with the computer , which is the whole point of a laptop . 
  if someone 's looking for a laptop , telling them `` oh , you should just get a desktop instead '' is incredibly unhelpful . 
  yeah , i second the idea that you should n't rearrange the keys . 
  1 ) it moves the nubs on u and h ( qwerty 's f and j ) so you ca n't use them to find your place . 
  2 ) on keyboards with even the slightest curvature , it messes with that , making for a substandard feel . 
  3 ) perhaps most importantly , * not * rearranging the keys promotes forcing you to learn to * really * touch type . 
  i know before i switched , my qwerty touch typing was okay , but i still glanced down occasionally . 
  by forcing myself to learn dvorak without switching keys * or using stickers * , my touch typing is now perfect . 
  i can type extended passages with my eyes closed . 
  my suggestion would be to print out an image of a dvorak layout and stick it underneath the monitor , or keep it next to the keyboard . 
  use that for reference until you get good enough to remove it . 
  best of luck !, 
  oh man i love what auto awesome does . 
  i 'm not entirely sure it is that much of a minority . 
  i follow the rss feeds of two people 's tumblr accounts , my sister , and a childhood friend of mine . 
  both of these people are totally normal seeming , intelligent people . 
  but if you look at their tumblr accounts , they fit a lot of the negative stereotypes associated with feminism . 
  i think a lot of younger people have only been introduced to feminist ideas from forums like tumblr , and have only been exposed to that relatively extreme viewpoint . 
  to the point that it 's not such a rare thing any more . 
  i always liked him . 
  he fucked up , but he came and gave an apology in his usual cheery manner ( which is what made him so great , imo ) , and everyone was all over him . 
  it was pretty sick to watch . 
  but the effort is near zero -- assuming you 're a moderately competent typist . 
  the benefit is at the * least * not having to explain to people why you do it/not having to read people complaining , and at the most , having people take you a little more seriously and knowing that it 's significantly more comfortable for those reading it . 
  or india , thailand , japan , and a bunch of others . 
  i do n't know how anyone runs with music . 
  my usual running shorts do n't have pockets , but i 've run with things in my pockets before and i ca n't stand the feeling of something swinging about in there . 
  then there 's the constant nuisance of the cable waving in your face or getting tangled/running up against your arm . 
  and then you still have to make sure the damn thing stays in your ears . 
  not to mention on training runs , if you run on the road for at least part of the run , you 're either taking a ridiculous risk , or you got ta take the things out for a bit . 
  people who run with earphones , fine , it does n't affect me , so keep on doing it . 
  being out running at all is great !, 
  but i will never understand you . 
  haha same here in vietnam , too . 
  and , come to think of it , probably much of india is that way . 
   but at the same time , 6 ' 3 '' and 160 lbs is very thin . 
  just wan na point out that it 's not * that * thin . 
  i 'm sitting at 180 cm and 60 kg , and have a bmi that 's nearly 2 points * lower * than yours ( i 'm 18.5 to your 20.0 ) . 
  it 's certainly thin , but it 's not an extreme amount . 
   i would never sacrifice my speed for other peoples ' aesthetic gratification ;, 
  now , i agree that he absolutely does * not * need to gain weight where he 's at right now , but it is n't necessarily for other people 's aesthetic gratification if he does . 
  their comments may have simply made him realise it about himself , and that he actually prefers it . 
  wait why bows ? 
  i 've been making warhammers since they 're worth more . 
  actually npcs can kill followers in skyrim . 
  they wo n't * target * followers once they go down , but if the follower gets hit by an aoe attack it will still kill them . 
  i was kinda hoping the paladin would become a warlock , but this is probably cooler . 
   and they can also trade one of their lower-level spells for another 3rd level spell if they so desire . 
  i you sure about this ? 
  i was under the impression that they could only retrain ones at an equal level to what the previously were . 
   no one in the games `` world '' could tell a reload happen, 
  hmm ... that sounds like a clever idea for a game , actually . 
  ** 4 or 5 players is best ** , but anything from 3 to 7 is doable without * too * much trouble . 
  then you need ** one person to be the dm ** . 
  so a total of 4 to 8 people involved in the game , ideally 5 or 6 . 
  ** 5e is probably your best bet ** . 
  it 's brand new and shiny , and is both really simple compared to all previous editions , and really well designed . 
  if for whatever reason you do n't want to go with 5e , i 'd recommend 4e . 
  it 's much simpler than anything prior to it , and most of the arguments against it largely come from built-in bias that some players have against it . 
  it 's actually a very good edition . 
  you do n't need to buy anything , especially if you go with 5e . 
  there are free rulebooks available online .
