  you can use improvised materials for play mats ( last time i played , i used a large chessboard as the grid -- cut each square on the board into 4 -- and used [ yowies ] ( http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/m769zsycdnoautqrgzxudrg.jpg ) and lego people as monster/player tokens ) . 
  there are great dice apps out there you can use for both android and ios . 
  that said , i ** would recommend getting at least two sets of dice ** -- one for the dm , one for players -- if not more . 
  it makes it a much easier experience , but it also gives you the cool atmosphere that you 're playing d&d . you can get pretty good sets for 4 -- 6 dollars on ebay . 
  i would also really recommend ( if you are only interested in doing things legally ) buying the [ ** 5e starter set ** ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset ) . 
  it comes with paper copies of the basic rulebooks i listed above ( and paper really does make this much easier than with pdfs ) and also comes with a basic adventure that is * really * well written for a beginner dm . 
  like , it 's incredible how well they 've written this , with really minute details on how you can have npcs react based on what the players do , that the players may not ever even know was influenced by them . 
  it also comes with one set of dice . 
  official price is $ 20 . 
  if you want to ( and want to stay within the law ) , after that , you can buy the three core books . 
  the full player 's handbook , dungeon master 's guide , and the monster manual . 
  these all provide a lot more detail than the free basic editions do , along with some really cool fun options for playing more exotic races like tieflings , which can be really fun . 
  of these three -- if you 're going to legally * buy * any of them -- the order i 've written them there is probably the order i 'd recommend them in . 
  the phb would be the best to get , because giving the players more fun options is brilliant . 
  the dm 's guide gives some great options for the dm to add in to the world , as well as more exotic options like paladins who break their oath . 
  ** tl ; dr ** buy the starter set for 5e and some dice . 
  see the links for free pdfs . 
  the rest is optional . 
  ** edit ** : just had another skim through the player 's basic rules . 
  was surprised at how limiting the class options were . 
  i would now more strongly recommend obtaining a copy of the full phb by some means , even if you do n't get the other books . 
  you ca n't be a sorcerer or a bard , or even the class i would consider the most important staple of d&d , a paladin . 
  that 's a little * too * limiting , imo . 
  more edit : added some bold for emphasis . 
   very few npcs ' deaths would make that pop up appear, 
  is n't that because they only had it for the main questline ? 
  if you fucked up the mage 's guild , or the morag tong , or one of the great house questlines , they did n't let you know about that , did they ? 
  i 'd consider some of those enough that i would * want * to go back to a save before it happened , but you do n't get the warning . 
  i could be wrong , i 've never actually played morrowind . 
  there once was a violist playing in the winnipeg symphony . 
  he was n't that wonderful a player , so he sat at the back of the section . 
  one day , he was cleaning out his attic and discovered an old lamp . 
  he gave it a rub and out popped a genie . 
  `` for letting me out of my lamp , i 'll grant you three wishes ! '', 
  he said . 
  the violist thought for a moment and replied , `` make me a far better musician than i am now . '', 
  the genie told him that this would be done . 
  he was to go to sleep and in the morning , he would be a much better musician . 
  the next day , he woke up to find himself the principal violist of the symphony . 
  well , this was just great , he thought !, 
  but he knew he could do better . 
  he rubbed the lamp again and out popped the genie . 
  `` you have two more wishes ! '', 
  he said . 
  `` i want you to make me a better musician than i am even now ! '', 
  once again , the genie told him to go to bed and when he woke up , it would be so . 
  when the violist awoke , he found he was now the principal violist of the berlin philharmonic . 
  well , the violist thought this was pretty grand , but knew he could do better yet . 
  he rubbed on the lamp again and once more out came the genie . 
  `` this is your last wish . '', 
  the genie said . 
  `` i want you to make me yet a better musician still ! '', 
  yet again , he was told to go to sleep . 
  the next morning , he woke up to find himself back in winnipeg , sitting in the last desk of the second violin section . 
  you mis ... no . 
  this stops here . 
  out of curiosity , if this is the penultimate room , what did you have in the final room ? 
  facing the gods themselves ? 
  nah lots of people do act like jerks over stuff like this . 
  complain that if you do n't want spoilers you should n't be on the subreddit . 
  you were cool about it , and that 's awesome . 
  yes it is . 
  i avoid anything from the producers etc. 
  precisely * because * it 's spoiler material , and i do n't want to be spoiled . 
  yeah but you just know they chose it specifically because it would get confused with batman , while still having plausible deniability . 
  like when they said `` that man '' a while back ( i think it was in the crossover ? 
  a reference to grr martin 's `` a song of ice and fire '' would be cool , too . 
  dude , chill out . 
   let me get my time machine . 
  okay , my mac is now backed up . 
  now what ? 
  i agree with you about everything except the us . 
  i absolutely love the bare ui the game comes with , and i think adding large numbers of extra junk to the screen would just ruin the experience . 
  what are ocv and dcv ? 
  ( and also spd , if it 's not speed ? ), 
  this is correct . 
  i believe i made the clarification for someone elsewhere in the thread . 
  and what is heroes/champions ? 
  a tabletop rpg where you play as superheroes ? 
  just curious , did you add similar add-ons to skyrim ? 
  while it 's true that it is n't * necessarily * spoiler material , i would still say that stuff should be treated with caution . 
  the asoiaf/got people have done a really good job of encouraging discussions that include the source material and also avoiding spoilers for those who have n't read it . 
  i think their model would be a good one to follow . 
  i do n't think we have spoiler tags on this subreddit . 
  should we add them ? 
  random ! = uniformly distributed, 
  i knew 7 would be the most popular . 
  i went with 4 . 
  was slightly surprised to see 6 was more popular than 4 . 
  well , i mean , if that 's what most potential employers are offering , then that is , by definition , the market rate . 
  it does n't necessarily represent a * fair * rate for the work being done/experience required , but that does n't preclude it from being the market rate . 
  america has 100 senators , right ? 
  where did the abstention come from ? 
  very true , but i 'm presuming that if that 's the price they 're offering , it 's because somebody is accepting it at that level . 
  any number greater than * or equal to * one . 
  she should n't have yelled at * anyone * , but how is she supposed to know it 's the wrong person ? 
  when i 'm at a restaurant i do n't know who does what . 
  a waiter is a waiter . 
  if i need something , i 'll ask whoever 's nearby . 
  he should n't have basically said `` go ask someone else '' .
