  your title reminded me of [ this really good story ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21ba53/an _ evil_campaign_gonegood / ) . 
  it 's what priests in age of empires would say when converting enemy units . 
  it 's absolutely not worth doing computer science at uq . 
  the course is a joke . 
  if you want to do something computer-y that is n't software engineering , a bachelor of information technology would be the next best . 
  i ca n't comment on the aerospace option , i do n't know anything about it . 
  as for numbers , yeah , there 's a lot less of us than mechanical , electrical , etc. , but it should n't be a problem . 
  most of the courses in the first two years are shared with electrical engineers ( if not * all * engineers ) , and many are also with information technology or even media people . 
  it 's actually a big boon , especially in group project courses , because while other disciplines may have to do something out of their preferred area due to numbers , there 's a good chance you 'll be the only software engineer , so you 'll be able to concentrate on your area of expertise . 
  can i ask , just out of curiosity , how much prior experience you 've got with programming ? 
  knowledge , as defined in the theory of knowledge , is `` a justified true belief '' . 
  that is to say , a belief which is true , and you have justified it correctly . 
  urgh i fucking hate this . 
  it 's like they 've never considered that a significant number of people might take public transportation , or even ** be passengers in a car ** . 
  i think this is a far better argument than the research argument , primarily for reasons described by / u/shinkouhyou above . 
  the trays that in-flight meals come on are more annoying to me than this . 
  everything 's packed together to be natural and easy to use for a righty . 
  i enjoy cinema sins in a similar way to yahzee croshaw 's zero punctuation game reviews . 
  they 're entertainment first , with a touch of actual review content if you know how to look at them . 
  i still ca n't trust him after chuck , even knowing his character in arrow is a good guy , and from seeing him in superman . 
  i see this as an upper class british thing to say , and i 'm having trouble hearing it in a strong aussie accent . 
  there 's at least one in brissy , too . 
  in aspley where there used to be a texan-themed `` lone star '' restaurant . 
  getting multilayer working with piracy is generally far more trouble than it 's worth . 
  for that reason , though i rarely pay for games , if i want to play them multilayer ( i far more often just do singleplayer games ) , i always do . 
  it 's just not worth the hassle , i find . 
  haha yeah , i figured it 'd be more like `` ayy '' than `` aye '' , but it 's the `` what for '' that 's just so prototypically posh english to me . 
  5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z4kk7rwjmk ) is one of the most obvious answers , but i definitely think it 's a brilliant one . 
  i 'm also a big fan of his [ 3rd symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yobq6bp0edq ) 's opening . 
  i also love the opening to [ mahler 's 5th ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dayemyqq_hw ) , with the beautiful lone trumpet . 
  perhaps this is my bias as a clarinetist , but i 've always loved the opening to [ sibelius symphony no . 
  1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnzuayjppo0 ) to be really chilling . 
  and , to venture ever so slightly outside the realm of traditional classical music , who can deny that the brilliant glissando that opens [ rhapsody in blue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qltmanobb40 ) is n't one of the coolest things in music . 
  ah , and i nearly forgot to add this one . 
  [ the opening to le sacre du printemp ( the rite of spring ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ujoagihg7a ) , by stravinsky . 
  spoilers for future stuff ( based on the character he 's playing from the comics , rather than stuff we 've actually seen in the show ) ahead , if you do n't want to know about that stuff :, 
  he 's a good guy . 
  his character is `` the atom '' , and his suit will ( once he gets it working ) give him the ability to grow smaller and larger . 
  you can see some hints at this from the palmer industries logo , it has an electron orbital type thing going on . 
  but yeah , i definitely thought he was going to be a bad guy , and probably still would were it not for comic readers in / r/arrow informing me otherwise . 
  well , that and the heroic sounding horn theme that played the first couple of times we saw hints of the super suit . 
  it really is such a beautiful , chilling , ending . 
  for anyone who does n't know , ssa female choir is generally kept off stage , and the fade out is facilitated by closing the door to their room slowly and silently . 
  i assume so . 
  edit : from [ the wikipedia page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lone_star_steakhouse_%26_saloon ), 
   on december 22 , 2003 , the american parent sold the 11 remaining lone star restaurants operating in new south wales , victoria and queensland to robert lapointe and tim smith . 
   in april 2010 , outback jacks bar & grill purchased all five new south wales-based restaurants , intending to rebrand them once franchisees were found . 
   on 1 july 2011 lone star steakhouse announced that they would close all queensland stores immediately . 
   in late 2011 outback steakhouse added the former lone star site in penrith to its growing list of restaurants after extensive remodelling . 
   in october 2011 the original parramatta store closed its doors and is being demolished . 
  looks like the one in aspley is n't the only former lone star to become an outback . 
  exactly . 
  i hate having a monarch , but i 'd much rather keep the status quo than move to a system too much like what america has , with a ( more or less ) directly elected president who has significant political power . 
  if that was the model put forward in the referendum , i 'd be voting no . 
  what 're your hobbies ? 
  play any sports ? 
  musical instruments ? 
  video games , or perhaps non-video games ? 
   there 's no way they 'd stagger a hardware release . 
  that would be crazy and would look bad . 
  they always have in the past . 
  the original iphone was n't released outside the us at all , iirc , and only a few years ago new iphones were released in stages with us , uk , canada , and a few others ( not including australia ) getting it a month or two before the second tier countries . 
  also , the 13 '' mbps are ( or used to be , i dunno ) 1280x800 , which is the same ratio . 
  i do n't know what the american ones are like , but i went to disney world in hong kong when i was on holiday there once . 
  thoroughly underwhelming compared to other amusement parks i 've been to , such as lotte world in seoul , or the big parks on the gold coast , australia . 
  i do n't know what it 's like at the american disney parks , but the hong kong one is * really * underwhelming if you like good rides . 
  definitely fits the `` kiddie rides '' perception you have . 
  upvote * comments * you are replying to unless you vehemently disagree with them . 
  seriously , i hate when i 'm having a friendly conversation with someone else on reddit and i 'm upvoting them , but they do n't reciprocate . 
  basic manners , people !, 
  if you 're not in an * argument * with someone that you reply to , upvote them . 
  site : reddit.com/r/whateversubreddit < what you 're searching for , 
  also good if you 're looking for something specific on a specific subreddit . 
  this is very correct . 
  pedantry is a great thing , so long as you 're polite about it and not an arsehole . 
  my character is a neutral good , bordering on lawful good shardmind . 
  or was , normally . 
  but one of the major events that caused it to start adventuring was when a shardslayer came and killed the one person my character really cared about -- destroying much of the town in the process . 
  my character made it its mission at that point to destroy any shardslayers it came across , to prevent them causing similar destruction to others . 
  as a result , once it gets a whiff of a shardslayer , it gets really narrowly focussed , and will stop at almost nothing to destroy it . 
  it 's causing the character to tend far more than it 's comfortable with towards chaotic . 
  there 's also the fact that it feels very few emotions , on account of being a living construct . 
  but i do n't see this quite so much as a weakness , because it has an intense curiosity and wants to learn about how humans ( and other living races ) deal with emotions . 
  normally here i 'd suggest `` why do n't you try and start up one !, 
  '' , but since that would normally de facto make you the dm , and hence still not get to play a character , it kinda defeats the point . 
  [ reminds me of this story ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21x1fx/korg _ the_barbarian_wizard / ) . 
  i get the same feeling , and i only moved twice as a kid . 
  once to korea at age 10 , and once to vietnam at 13 ( then back to home country for uni at 18 ) . 
  neither place really feels like home . 
  out of curiosity , what curriculum did you do in high school ? 
  a levels ? 
  the american system ? 
  but yeah , being a third-culture kid is awesome . 
  true . 
  if the other guy is being reasonable and bringing good points to the table , i generally will upvote anyway . 
  but i do n't begrudge someone who does n't believe the same . 
  i * do * , however , think it 's impolite * not * to upvote in any * other * situation , though . 
  oh fair enough . 
  having moved around so much , i guess i just assumed you 'd be going to an international school and doing one of the more internationally-spread curricula . 
  just because the different mechanics that school curricula interests me , i ca n't help but ask , how does the swedish system work with regards to which subjects you do ?
