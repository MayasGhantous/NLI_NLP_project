  for example , the british a-levels are `` you do any three ( or more ) subjects , no restrictions '' , while ib is `` you take a first language , a second language , a social science , an experimental science , maths , and ` an art or elective from one of the other groups ' '' . 
   you 'd probably need to develop some criteria for what constitutes growing influence, 
  or not . 
  you could let the players decide what `` growing influence '' means to them . 
  maybe it means one of those things , maybe it 's a combination of them , or something else entirely . 
  of course , if they decide it 's something that actually makes no sense -- for example , if they decide to spread their demon would want them to be planting flowers and feeding the homeless ( with no ulterior motive ) as a way to spread influence -- then have the demon come in and correct them . 
  yep i 'm exactly the same . 
  i love my macbook pro , and i adore os x , but i still have a desktop running windows , and my phone and tablet are both nexuses . 
  i 'm all in on the google ecosystem as far as emails , contacts , documents , etc. 
  goes . 
  i just do n't trust apple 's options in these areas to be as reliable as what google does . 
   prefer their labelling system and all mail folder ... and i do n't, 
  i just can not comprehend how anyone would prefer the traditional folder model with emails . 
  with labelling , one can very easily apply multiple relevant labels , to make finding a particular email , or particular sorts of emails , really easy . 
  for example , i have a `` receipts '' label , but i also have labels for many companies that i frequently receive emails from , like microsoft and apple . 
  if i receive a receipt for a purchase from one of those companies , it gets both labels . 
  i also keep more important things in the inbox , while i archive others that are n't likely to be needed any time soon . 
  with the old `` folder '' mentality , something can only be in one folder at a time . 
  that receipt from apple , does it go in the apple folder , or the receipt folder ? 
  which am i more likely to go searching through later ? 
  i dunno ... and what if i want to keep it in my inbox until the product actually arrives ? 
  well , i 'm fucked . 
  i ca n't do that unless i also wait until it 's arrived to sort it into a relevant folder . 
  that is , unless i want to have redundant copies of each email in multiple folders , which is ridiculous . 
  i mean , it 's up to you if you prefer the old folder mentality . 
  it makes no difference to my life , and if it works for you , that 's great !, 
  i just really , * really * can not comprehend why someone would prefer it . 
  nobody reads the terms and conditions . 
  not lawyers , not it people , no one . 
   they are n't just bad at [ software ] , often they are horrible at it . 
  os x ( and the free included software ) , final cut pro , logic , and ios ( for the most part ... ) all beg to differ . 
  as others have said , what they do poorly , ** very ** poorly , much of the time , is services and the cloud . 
  seriously uk , get your shit together . 
  -- sincerely , australia , asia , and mainland europe . 
  i 'm an aussie and i was talking to an * american * once and had a similar experience . 
  was talking about [ a trip from a moderately large coastal town ( east coast ) to a small town about three hours drive inland ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/townsville+airport,+garbutt,+queensland,+australia/charters+towers,+queensland,+australia/@-19.6598728,146.1168126,9z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x6bd5f837b9a812d3:0xf00eef26260b0a0!2m2!1d146.771411!2d-19.2542!3m4!1m2!1d146.367053!2d-19.488123!3s0x6bd5a2955b5f5bf3:0x1300eef178d012d0!1m5!1m1!1s0x6bd45ef960928d4f:0x400eef17f209470!2m2!1d146.2538153!2d-20.0504796!3e0 ) ( google maps link for reference ) . 
  he asked `` so it 's on the west coast , then ? '' . 
  not even close . 
  of course , the same would be true in america , so i 'm not sure where the mistake came from . 
  except that that 's not true . 
  2007 was the version where they introduced it , before they refined it in 2010 . 
  [ probably this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hljq0gfhm8s ) . 
  i do n't feel like sitting through the 14 minute video again ( as much as i enjoyed it the first time ) to check it 's the right one . 
  i 've certainly had constructive feedback on my videos before . 
  i 've also had comments saying `` fake '' . 
  probably would be a smarter idea to share it out as https://www.youtube.com/gamingbygamers . 
  try to build that tiny bit of brand recognition into it through the link that you share . 
  is it a sex thing ? 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a sex thing . 
  depends on where in the country . 
  it 's a bloody big place . 
  my home town gets as low as 6\u00ba in the winter as something that 's considered * really * cold , but not extraordinary . 
  this past winter had the coldest morning in over 100 years at 2.6 \u00ba . 
  but further south , or further inland , and it gets much colder than that . 
  and , just in case it did n't cross your mind ( i get the impression it probably did , but just in case ) it 's currently summer in aus . 
   at least spell properly . 
  ` aye ' is pronounced ` eye ' . 
  it 's scottish for ` yes ' . 
  this is correct , but also worthy of note is that it 's often used outside of scotland for ` yes ' in situations such as voice voting ( which is used [ in our own parliament ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/division_of_the_assembly#australia ) in some circumstances ) . 
   the word you are thinking of is spelled ` eh ' . 
  it 's pronounced ` ay ' . 
  personally , i would rather spell it ` ay ' in this circumstance . 
  ` eh ' feels to me somewhat less ... australian . 
  but either way works . 
  naturally . 
  but at the same time , what our generation * is * doing , is moving away from the model of tv that they want to sell . 
  we do n't want to have to sit down at the time that they tell us the show is on . 
  instead , many people are recording shows and watching them later , or watching shows on streaming services , or turning to piracy when the former options are not available . 
  no , the spirit of the law would be that accidentally stumbling across it should be fine . 
  the issue is that police , prosecutors , juries , and everyone involved want to be seen as really hard on this issue , so they 'll often convict anyway . 
  apparently the performance was lackluster ( due to lack of rehearsal time -- in one of the pieces , they had to stop and start it again ) , and the conditions of the room were pretty terrible . 
  not to mention the sheer length of that performance would be exhausting . 
  but i 'd still give my right arm to go back and see it . 
  which editing ? 
  it 's been so long since i 've seen fantasia , i ca n't remember what they did with the 6th in it at all . 
  though i hated what they did to the 5th . 
  cutting out the entire development section and half the recapitulation -- including that marvelous oboe solo . 
  the visuals were nice , though . 
  [ this was one of the first things i saw on that page ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/b8qksdhcuaauhnf.jpg:large ) . 
  the ldp * does n't * `` go full retard '' . 
  they * are * full retard . 
  that 's what libertarianism * is * . 
  got ta be honest , i 've never liked that segment . 
  not because they play non-classical stuff , that 's totally fine . 
  i just have n't found that the interviews are particularly interesting most of the time . 
  me too , but i do it as an inverse relationship just to mess things up . 
   skepticism is n't a natural reaction for a lot of people , i think, 
  hmm , i 'm not so sure about that . 
  i wan na see some data to back it up . 
  yeah this is one thing i 'm really worried about . 
  anyone in the party would be more popular than abbott is right now . 
  god , if they put turnbull up ( not that i think they ever would ) they 'd have an almost guaranteed victory at the next election . 
  tf2 and cs : source have pretty low spec requirements , they should run just fine . 
  i ca n't comment on more recent cs games , i 've never looked at them , but it 's certainly not a series one would associate with high-end gaming , so it should probably work fine . 
  got ta be honest , i 'm not a fan of this recording . 
  i found the first movement too slow , it really dragged . 
  though i think the slower tempo does something wonderful to the piece around 9:10 -- 9:30 . 
  the second movement was fine , but then the third was back to painfully slow . 
  the big accelerando at 23:20 took it up to about the tempo it should 've started at , imo . 
  the fourth movement was paced beautifully , and while i felt the 5th movement a little fast with the clarinet at the start , it sort of settled into the right tempo by the time the horn solo came along .
