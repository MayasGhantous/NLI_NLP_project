  i do n't like it . 
  it 's lacking the only feature that keeps me tied to microsoft office -- solid referencing . 
  for everything else , google drive is more than sufficient . 
  it operates in a middle-ground between the two that just is n't relevant to me . 
  yeah i agree . 
  i do n't exactly * dislike * lindt , but i found it rather dull in comparison to some good cadbury dairy milk . 
  as an aussie : [ yowies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yowie_%28chocolate%29 ) were always so much better than kinder . 
  i 'm not sure if kinders are banned still or not , because [ yowies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yowie_%28chocolate%29 ) ( an old australian chocolate with toys inside , that stopped being sold in australia quite a while ago ) recently started selling again , but in the us . 
  solid as in good quality , and referencing as in it 'll manage your bibliography and insert in-line references and stuff for you . 
  aussie and nz cadbury is definitely inferior to british ( which i learned when i went to england on holiday once ) but oh god it is a ** world ** ahead of what passes for cadbury in asia . 
  for the price , it 's easily my favourite chocolate . 
  i 'm really not a fan of some of the other big brands like lindt . 
  haha if you think aussie cadbury is bad ( and i 'll admit , when compared to the british version , it definitely does not perform favourably ) you should try cadbury elsewhere in the world . 
  the stuff they sell here in asia is absolutely awful compared to aussie cadbury . 
  i 'm curious , is your second paragraph talking about aussie maccas , or british ? 
  ca n't see the plastic inside of yowies until after you 've bitten in to them , either . 
  it 's possible that the law has been relaxed at some point . 
  it 's usually better to ignore them and not try and debate them on their political beliefs . 
  i 've never known one to think rationally about it . 
  he 's reading into it what he * wants * to see , because it justifies his own internal beliefs . 
  damn i wish i had known this when i bought mine . 
  or can you only buy the off-the-shelf versions through them ( i.e. , not built-to-order ) ? 
  as others have said , what is your use case ? 
  i have a 15 '' non-retina ( and i 'm * so * grateful that i got it before they stopped selling those ) and personally , i do n't find it too heavy to carry around on campus with me , but some easily could . 
  if you 're not going to be doing gaming , video/photo/audio editing , or 3d design , there 's not really any point in getting a mbp , so getting a 13 '' air is probably great . 
  ( and if you are interested in gaming , join us at / r/macgaming . 
  you 'd be surprised how many games these days are available on os x , and bootcamp is * amazingly * easy to use . ), 
  probably worth adding that if you 're a user who uses a heavy amount of lighter applications -- someone who has 10 + browser tabs , or a huge number of long documents open at a time -- you might want to make sure you upgrade to 8 gb ram . 
  my windows pc has only 4 gb ram and chrome is constantly telling me it 's running out of memory , while my mac with 8 gb never has that problem . 
  the battle of bywater is also my favourite part of the series , but for reasons that are actually in the book , and not me reading my bullshit political beliefs into it . 
  it 's about how the hobbits -- merry and pippin especially -- have grown over the course of the novel from the young , na\u00efve hobbits complaining about not getting second breakfast at the start of their journey , into capable warriors who can lead a force to expel the enemy from their homeland . 
  it 's summarising their whole character arc from the rest of the series . 
  fair point . 
  his exact words were, 
   my political opinions lean more and more to anarchy ( philosophically understood , meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs ) -- or to ` unconstitutional ' monarchy . 
  i find it amusing that even back then , anarchism was somewhat associated with `` whiskered men with bombs '' . 
  seriously . 
  i would consider myself a pretty damn heavy user ( though not nearly as old as you ) , but i still rarely see reposts , and when i do , it 's generally on smaller subreddits . 
  and even then , i do n't mind . 
  most of the time the repost is pretty funny or interesting content , so it 's not such a bad thing to see it for a second time . 
   if i get bored , i just close the tab and by habit , just reddit.com all over again . 
  ctrl-w , ctrl-t , r enter ( or cmd-w , cmd-t , r enter , depending on which computer i 'm using ) is a very common workflow for me . 
  it 's people who believe the world would be better if there was no government , and instead corporations filled the vacuum . 
  the rich could pay for police-like services to protect them etc. , but the poor would , naturally , be left completely without . 
  think of it as a * really * extreme form of libertarianism . 
  it 's kinda scary to think really people believe it , but there 's always comfort in the fact that they 'll never actually get any country to convert . 
  yeah i had quite a few points i wanted to make on a number if different topics , but they were n't touched upon . 
  and i did n't want to ramble * too * much in the general feedback box at the end . 
  so i only brought up 1 or 2 of them . 
  oh god , i hate overzealous email verification . 
  guys , any email that has at least one character before the @ and at least two after it ( not including full stops ) is perfectly valid . 
  you * do n't * need any more verification than the official standard . 
  i doubt it 'll be a problem , but i just want to make sure . 
  is there any spoiler stuff in this music ? 
  i 'm still playing through dragon age : origins . 
  which benefit is that ? 
   i found it odd you could clarify on feats ( with a 500-word limit , no less ! ), 
  but could n't do so in the class analysis even a 50-word limit would have been nice !, 
  i do n't think that was meant just for feats . 
  i think it was a poorly located spot for general feedback on the whole system/survey . 
  i do n't . 
  it would seem he 's not the only one who thought the general feedback form was in fact just for feedback on feats . 
  admittedly , it was poorly located . 
  putting it on the bottom of a long page full of nothing but `` did you like this feat or not '' certainly makes it easy to see as that . 
  what the fuck does arnaze mean ? 
  do n't forget `` sonata form '' , `` ritornello '' , and `` timbre '' . 
  just wan na say , i know it 's a computer recording , but whatever you used to generate it did n't even attempt the `` steady accel until it becomes a hot mess '' at the end . 
  woulda been nice if it had . 
   `` what is better - to be born good , or to overcome your evil nature through great effort ? '', 
  how is that something that benefits conjuration cantrips ? 
  your damaging cantrips ( which is the majority of evocation cantrips ) still do half damage if the enemy would have otherwise avoided all damage . 
   i read every window and it never mentioned a 17.95 monthly fee, 
  * assuming that this is true * ( other comments are claiming it is n't , i 'm not american so i do n't care enough to check , but the rest of my comment only applies if the above is actually true ) , the charge is fraudulent and you should contact your bank/credit card company and get them to reverse the charge . 
  the flavour text implies that it should still work in this case , even if the mechanics imply otherwise . 
  seems like it 's mainly an oversight and that it might be better to play it as though the attack rolls also get the effect . 
  awesome , thanks . 
  i just wan na thank you so much for this . 
  it 's worked absolutely amazingly for me these past two or three nights that i 've been using it . 
  seriously . 
  i absolutely can not * stand * it when i say , in reply to a situation someone has presented , `` assuming x ( from your story ) is true , then you should do y '' , and then someone else comes along and downvotes me , saying `` actually , x is not true '' . 
  happened to me earlier today . 
  i make a fucking ** point ** of pointing out that my advice is * only * applicable if the given conditions were true , and somehow then coming along and saying `` actually , x is n't true , so you 're wrong '' is a valid argument . 
  i think the most important distinction there is that the eagles were introduced * before * their use was necessitated . 
  mithrandir escaped orthanc riding on the eagles , not to mention their presence in the hobbit . 
  i believe that they even , at some point , discussed why the oft-raised idea that they should have just ridden in to mordor on eagles and dropped the ring in orodruin , would n't have worked . 
  so it is n't , in any way , a deus ex machina . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , tyranny of dragons is the name encompassing both hoard of the dragon queen ( which is part 1 ) and rise of tiamat ( which is part 2 ) . 
  is this correct ? 
  that 's odd , i got the same * page * , but on wikipedia , not the marvel wikia . 
  edit : tried it a few more times , got the same link as yours sometimes , as well as the wikipedia , as well as something called `` comicvine '' related to latveria . 
  looks like someone has set up a server at 23.21.190.125 to randomly ( or sequentially , or whatever ) send you to one of those pages . 
   no dvd drive, 
  i still use mine pretty regularly . 
  it 's one of the many reasons ( though admittedly , it 's a comparatively minor one among some other more serious ones ) that i 'm really glad to have one of the last generation of 15 inch non-retina macbook pros . 
  mainly installing things that i bought on disk . 
  i use it rarely enough that an external disk reader would probably be more appropriate , but often enough that i would need at least that . 
   speaking of conspiracy theories , mine is that he is gunning for a job as some kind of spokesman or ambassador for the royals partly based out of the uk when his political career ends . 
  oh god . 
  what if he 's gunning for the role of governor general down the line ? 
  we are not amused .
