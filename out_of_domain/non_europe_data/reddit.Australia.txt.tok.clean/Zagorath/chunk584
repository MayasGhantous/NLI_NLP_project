  oh i was n't trying to criticise you at all !, 
  just providing myself as a counter-example , and also hoping to inspire anyone else who might have come along and read it . 
  from the error code , it looks like it went away 9 years ago !, 
  any app that * does n't * allow varied playback speeds is n't a podcast app . 
  i listen to most of mine at 2.5 -- 2.8 x speed , which is really handy when you have  10 hours of podcasts per week ( at regular speed ) . 
  listening to podcasts is such a brilliant way to make otherwise boring tasks like commutes and household chores into much more interesting times . 
  audiobooks probably work as well . 
  he literally decimated the world 's population . 
  actually i think he 's conflating pure water 's propensity to dissolve materials into it with actual * chemical * reactions . 
  absolutely ** do not ** do a donkey vote . 
  if you do n't want to vote for anyone , spoil the ballot , but a donkey vote is a stupid idea . 
  your vote should n't go to the party that just happens to have their member at the top of the ballot paper . 
  i 'd be happy to see the sub experiment with it at least once , and then see how that goes . 
  seems better than saying off the bat `` this is going to be every week '' . 
  it 's highly unusual for [ rouge ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rouge_\\ ( cosmetics \\ ) ) to be involved in attacks of * any * sort , let alone sneak attacks , unless perhaps it is poison designed to be absorbed through the skin . 
  rogues , on the other hand can make a sneak attack any time they have advantage on attack roles . 
  so if the enemy ca n't see you because you snuck up on them , you can use it . 
  in the middle of combat , you can also use a sneak attack * any * time you have an ally within 5 feet of the enemy -- it 's sort of like 4e 's `` flanking '' , but more flexible . 
  as for using cunning action to hide , yes , that 'll give you the ability to make a sneak attack , since any time you are hidden , you can make a sneak attack . 
  in order to hide , you have to be completely hidden from the enemy -- for example , behind a wall/pillar , or have all enemies blinded . 
  the rules are explained really well on page 177 of the phb . 
   could this tactic reasonably surprise the same enemy 3 or 4 times in a row ? 
  i would n't think so but it is ultimately your call . 
  i think , actually , given the description of sneak attack , that perhaps the name is misleading . 
  first of all , it quite explicitly says that you do n't need it any time that there is, 
   another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, 
  as long as, 
   that enemy is n't incapacitated , and you do n't have disadvantage, 
  the fluff around it is simply that you 're taking advantage of the enemy 's * distraction * . 
  such a distraction may be provided by the fact that you 're sneaking and they do n't know where you are , but it can equally be that another enemy is standing next to them that also needs attention .

  edit : though in my defence , at least both of these ones are homophonic , 
  not within a mile , but back in 2001 , [ 85 % of australians lived within 50 km of the coast ] ( http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/previousproducts/1301.0feature%20article32004 ) . 
  i suspect it 's only gone up since then . 
  i ca n't find data to support it , but i have heard that a couple of years ago it was 90 % within 50 km . 
  no not at all . 
  the way it 's been implemented in queensland was * really * well designed , and it wo n't disenfranchise anyone eligible to vote . 
  there is a * huge * variety of acceptable ids , from passports and drivers ' licences to medicare cards and utility bills . 
  and if by some chance you do n't even have a water bill or electricity bill , they mail out to everyone a piece of paper specifically designed to be id just for the election . 
  and , as others have said , there are ways to vote even if you forget all id on the day . 
  it 's just a bit more hassle for you . 
  secure boot is currently disabled . 
  the problem with that usb drive guide is that it assumes you want to create it in os x to be used * on * a mac . 
  is it still a useful guide to follow ( ignoring step 10 , of course ) to create something to use on another pc ? 
  will try switching the os thing to win7 , and i 'll see if i can find the model number . 
  win7 did n't help , and the various documents i 've got seem inconsistent with regards to model number . 
  the `` ec declaration of conformity '' page at the back of the user manual lists model name as `` x200ca , f200ca , r203ca '' . 
  the dvd included with it says `` x200ma/f200ma/r202ma '' . 
  a separate `` ec declaration of conformity '' sheet says `` x200ca , f200ca , r202ca , x200m , f200m , r202m '' . 
  edit : it also has a couple of stickrs on the back ( i think one is from the manufacturer , and the other is from the store ) saying its f200m , or f200ma-kx541d . 
  i feel like it would be really awesome if the divorce was amicable . 
  like , * really * amicable . 
  a sort of `` too good to be true '' situation . 
  yeah , it 's already disabled . 
  i do n't think so , how would i go about that ? 
  the only option in the bios menu i see that mentions legacy at all is `` hard drive bbs priorities '' , which , when hovered hover , says `` set the order of the legacy devices in this group '' over on the right hand side . 
  when i select that option , it comes up with ` boot option # 1 p0 : wdc ... ] ` ( the internal drive ) and ` boot option # 2 [ kingstondata ... ] ` ( the usb drive ) . 
  no luck , i 'm afraid . 
  no text scroll , either . 
  ninjaedit : wait , i tried it a second time , mainly because i was n't certain if it was n't just a text scroll that i missed . 
  this time there is a text scroll going on for a fair few seconds . 
  ninjaedit the second : wow , it 's running me through a gui-based setup process now !, 
  yay !, 
  thanks so much !, 
  okay , cool . 
  it looks like it 's going to work for me here straight from the `` install '' option ( i told it to completely replace freedos ) , but if it fails i 'll give that a go . 
  on a serious note , someone mentioned to me that bikies had actually donated to the lnp campaign out of irony . 
  i did n't read it in the news myself , though , so i could me wrong . 
  by default , steam saves games to ` ~ / library/application support/steam ` . 
  the location that a game saves things like save data is dependent on the game itself , so you 'll need to look at the game 's settings -- but they often are n't easily editable , if at all . 
  wow . 
  this is some weird baader-meinhoff shit . 
  i was going through my downloads folder just a few hours ago and randomly came across this , which i downloaded last time i it came up on here .

  you 're hardcore . 
  so , fun fact , but ginger beer actually * does * contain alcohol . 
  it 's just so low that it 's legally classed as a non-alcoholic drink , and is allowed to be drunk by children .

  1 scrambled egg , 48 whole live pigs , a litre of milk straight from the goat 's teat , and then i circumnavigate the globe on foot . 
  i 'm always amazed at how rare the term `` soft drink '' is within the states , considering it 's completely ubiquitous internationally . 
  does that make top deck three-quarters chocolate ? 
  i also do n't like gourmet chocolate , but cadbury is the equivalent for most of the world ( or , at least , most of western europe , eastern asia , and australia , from my experience ) of hershey 's in america , and it is vastly superior chocolate . 
   and moving in a diagonal takes 7.5 feet, 
  the method for gridded combat recommended in the phb is to use the same model as 4e . 
  moving one square in * any * direction counts as `` 1 square '' , or 5 feet . 
  it 's a little less realistic , sure , but it 's vastly simpler than using pythagoras 's theorum all the time . 
  for what it 's worth , if you want to be more accurate and not use this rule , you should n't be saying one diagonal square is 7.5 feet ( not really sure how you arrived at that , tbh ... ) , it should be ~ 7 feet . 
  7.07 , to be more precise . 
  ( sqrt ( 5 ^ 2 + 5 ^ ( 2 ) ) ), 
  a great way to both decrease confusion and to increase view counts in your videos would be to briefly mention that disengage can allow you to move away safely , and then tell the viewer that they can watch your other video on the topic by clicking an annotation . 
  ( and put an annotation saying `` coming soon '' , but remember to replace it once you do get the next video up . ), 
  it seems to me that raw would mean that a character with enough movement could stay within the threat range of the enemy and literally run circles around them , without provoking opportunity attacks at all . 
  that makes no sense to me . 
  to be honest , i 'm not a huge fan of this whole mechanic in 5e , and will likely house rule in a system more like 4e . 
  if you only slide 5 feet ( in any direction , including moving out of their reach ) , then you do n't provoke opportunity attacks .
