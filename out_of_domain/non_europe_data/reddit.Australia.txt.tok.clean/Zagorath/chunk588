  eh ... yeah , there is quite a lot of stuff that we hardly remember these days . 
  but i think most people agree that the people we today consider the greats of the classical and romantic periods were very popular in their day . 
  haydn , mozart , and beethoven were each among the most well-respected musicians of their time , and other composers like tchaikovsky , rachmaninoff , and chopin had substantial followings ( though not necessarily for the same reason as we love them today -- i remember reading that tchaikovsky 's ballets were not well received in his day , and rachmaninoff 's popularity heavily keyed off of his ability as a pianist ) . 
  yeah , that 's the 4e rules , more or less . 
  to be precise , in 4e , the rule is if you leave a space within an enemy 's reach , you proke an opportunity attack . 
  that includes if it is from one space in their reach to another , or if it 's from a space within their reach to a space away from them . 
  your option , at least in 4e , if you do n't want to provoke oa , is to `` slide '' as your movement . 
  sliding only allows you to move a single space . 
  and to be honest , i much prefer that system . 
  i 'm gon na house rule that into 5e , with the additional rule that you can also take the disengage action and then use your full movement without provoking oas . 
   otherwise , i 'd see no real reason to waste points on things when my best can fail , but it opens for free after regardless, 
  oh come on mate . 
  now you 're not even trying . 
  the entire ** point ** is that if your best is good enough and there 's no consequence of failure , you automatically succeed . 
  if your best is n't good enough , then you simply ca n't do it . 
   i 'm treating the same door as different based on what 's behind it -- not it , itself -- in your example . 
  if its the wizard , the door becomes a repeated try and if not it auto-opens, 
  sigh ... if you 're just going to ignore the points i bring up , i really do n't see the point in continuing this conversation . 
  good day . 
   no reason for pc a to get better at it because out-of-combat , he is going to open just as many doors as pc b, 
  it 's shit like this that 's the reason i do n't want to continue this conversation . 
  i 've already clearly demonstrated why this is not the case . 
  more to the point , i have ** never ** said ** anything ** that would imply this is the case . 
  if you ca n't have a conversation without bringing up blatant strawman representations of my argument , then i 'm not going to continue this . 
  if you 're willing to actually read what i say and take it as i say it , instead of reading in what you want to read , then i 'm happy to continue . 
  and note , i 'm going to downvote this comment , specifically because it seems to serve no purpose but to ( a ) deliberately misrepresent my argument in order to make yours look good and ( b ) deliberately antagonise me . 
  i 'm just letting you know because i 'll gladly take the downvote back if you are willing to engage in rational conversation . 
  i used `` normal '' to distinguish it from the lts version . 
  well this is awkward . 
  i tried that and now it 's even worse , or just as bad , depending on how you look at it . 
  attempting to boot normally displays about three lines of command line text ( something like ` ignoring bgrt : invalid status 0 ` before going black , and never recovering . 
  with shift , i 've now got one additional option ( other one installed ) . 
  the previous default still does what it did , and the option that used to work , still does . 
  i like it so far . 
  yay !, 
  one that 's released at a nice time !, 
  middle of the afternoon , here . 
  i reckon a good aussie nickname for grey would be grazza or grazzo . 
  or possibly cozza/cozzo , from the c. 
  best method xd, 
  it 's kinda the same naming system that the twit podcasts use for their titles . 
  it 's quite clever , i think . 
  or the title of the episode could just be `` podcast name episode # '' . 
  at least according to this theory . 
  hahaha . 
  which podcast did you hear about linda on , / u/mindofmetalandwheels ? 
   i do n't divide people into left and right handed, 
  thank you . 
  ambidextrous people exist , brady !, 
  i completely agree with you on the downside of youtube being so big . 
  youtube has been the big player in the industry for so long , and they 're just awful in so many ways . 
  their attitude to copyright is just insanely anti-video-maker . 
  their attitude towards fair use is that they assume it could never possibly be fair use until the uploader specifically refutes the claim . 
  people frequently get dinged for public domain content , or content that they own . 
  for example , public domain nasa broadcasts , rebroadcast by tv news , has resulted in other people using the public domain stuff getting dinged as violating the tv news station 's copyright . 
  i 've also had my own personal recordings of public domain classical music get dinged as being copyrighted -- in one case , it was even claiming it was a completely different piece of music . 
  and in some cases , just things that sound similar to other stuff that some copyright troll in brazil has put up on content id get dinged . 
  and there 's zero penalty for copyright holders making false claims to copyright against a video . 
  and now there 's this new whole story , which takes it all to a whole new level . 
  all of the above could probably be at least partly defended by laziness and just wanting to bow down to big record labels etc. 
  but this new story is * very * directly the fault of youtube itself , and nobody else . 
  it 's just ** horrible ** . 
  there desperately needs to be a viable youtube competitor . 
  but they need to keep the strong social features that youtube has ( subscriptions , comments/comment replies , good , easy monetisation options for both large and small video producers , etc. ) . 
  regarding the yahoo !, 
  thing , they 're going to distributing the next season of the tv show community , which has a pretty substantial audience . 
  yahoo 's video site , screen , is already up and running , though i must admit i 've not looked at it . 
  i think they hope to leverage community to drive a larger audience towards it . 
  hopefully their monetisation options for normal video producers are good . 
  but i 've just taken a quick look at the site , and in two or three minutes of looking i could n't find * any * option to upload a video . 
  i suspect they do n't * want * to be a youtube competitor . 
   auto text expander - great for repetitive text . 
  i ca n't help but feel in 95 % of cases this would be better handled at the os level . 
  i have textexpander by smile software on my mac , for example , and phraseexpress on windows . 
  but oh god , i desperately need clutter free . 
  thanks so much for sharing that !, 
   knighting prince phillip was n't a bad thing per say but doing it on australia day with the australian of the year awards leaves too many holes to poke at . 
  i disagree . 
  it was a bad thing in and of itself . 
  he 's fucking royalty , there 's absolutely no reason to give him an honourific that most would agree is significantly lower than that . 
  he 's also done basically * nothing * to help australia or australians . 
  when was the last time he was even in the damn country ? 
  but doing it on australia day just amplifies the stupidity tenfold . 
  by the way , just so you know for next time , the expression is actually `` per se '' . 
  but it 's a really easy mistake to make . 
  i have a few questions about this method . 
  do you put any sort of cap on how many proficiencies they can get with it ? 
  in most cases it should n't be a problem , but if the player just happens to have 5 or 6 things that their character enjoys doing as a child , that 's a bit op for a first level character to gain . 
  on a related note , i know you have n't done it with 5e yet , but do you think you would have this completely replace the mechanical benefits of backgrounds ( since it in itself grants a few proficiencies ) or would you use it to * decide * on a relevant background for them to take , and also gain proficiencies from that background ? 
  and similarly , regarding starting items , do you just take those from the phb backgrounds/classes , or do you work items into this method ( either in addition to or instead of the items they 'd have in raw ) ? 
  i have to say , though , this really does seem * very * cool . 
  i can easily see a modified version of it being used to run a campaign [ very much like this story ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) . 
  ( and fwiw , the story is an excellent read , and i 'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in dnd . 
  it 's rather long , though , so you might want to pace yourself over a few days . 
  if you just want to get the reference , you probably only need to read the first dozen or so journal entries . ), 
  on that note , do you have any thoughts on running a level zero session where the characters are all together in the same session ? 
  sorry for the massive pile of questions . 
  but thanks so much for sharing this , it 's absolutely brilliant . 
  no backup , the install is basically brand new . 
  there 's nothing worth backing up .
