  the error messages are various forms of `` could not connect to server '' . 
  it 's worth noting that the internet connection on this thing is crap in general . 
  sometimes it just refuses to connect at all , sometimes it will connect , but everything is so much slower than all the other devices on the network . 
  this goes for both wifi and wired connections , though it 's far worse on wifi . 
  i do n't know how to get an option to login without gui , so i have n't tried that . 
  but remember , i * can * get into a gui mode if i boot with an older version of linux . 
   i ( again ) see your case like this ... ... ... we do n't have a new consequence to roll against . 
  so , your summary of what i 'm saying in here is absolutely accurate . 
  that does n't change the fact that your previous comment misrepresented a number of things horribly . 
   no reason for pc a to get better at it because out-of-combat , he is going to open just as many doors as pc b, 
  because maybe the door is really heavy , and the wizard with 10 strength has no chance of opening it , but the barbarian with 18 strength can . 
  and if he put more points into strength to get it up to 20 , he 'd have even more chance of opening it . 
  maybe he can open it on a die roll of 16 rather than 17 . 
   i 'm treating the same door as different based on what 's behind it -- not it , itself -- in your example . 
  if its the wizard , the door becomes a repeated try and if not it auto-opens, 
  see , what you 're doing here is treating the door as different based on the initial roll . 
  if you set the dc to 20 , and the first roll totals 18 , you artificially decide that doing the same thing again and rolling 22 fails . 
  this just does n't make sense . 
  the door has changed based on the result of the first roll . 
  and , i 'll just add , this is n't * always * a bad thing . 
  with lockpicking , for example , perhaps the first failed attempt jams the lock somewhat , making it harder to do the second time . 
  but when there is n't a logical explanation for it , i just do n't see why you would change it . 
  the method i prefer is more free form . 
  more based in roleplay or real-world logic , rather than game mechanics and die rolling . 
  but that does n't necessarily make it better , i guess . 
  i think at this point we probably have to agree to disagree . 
  it 's different opinions on what makes the game good . 
  but i do want to thank you for turning around and making that last comment a very reasonable one . 
  my thought with running it as a group was only to play it similar to that story ( which , again , is an incredible read , highly recommend ) . 
  probably would have the set up and maybe some of their early life done separately , but they arrive in the world at some point . 
  and the issue is that coming from today 's society , obviously they 're not going to be attuned to d&d classes , so they need some way in-universe of getting a class , which would have to happen after they 've arrived in the d&d world , which means that 's when they 've started playing together as a group . 
   yes , and if you make 3 difficult rolls it 's going to be awesome, 
  and if you do n't make the rolls , it 's still gon na be awesome . 
  - ly hilarious . 
   there is no way left to communicate with people for free without giving up something . 
  yes there is . 
  email is an open system , and you can encrypt it using pgp without much difficulty . 
  no privacy or information given up there . 
  similarly , there are open source voip clients available that are encrypted . 
  i ca n't say i know how well the work , though , i 've never used one . 
  how many non-commercial foss projects offer a * service * for free ? 
  we 're not talking about a piece of free software , but something that offers an ongoing service in the way a social media site does . 
   think we could get out that tank that fought google +, 
  urgh please no , that was asinine . 
  the g + comments changeover is actually , imo , one thing that youtube does right . 
  a big part of the reason youtube is so successful is that ignoring all the copyright stuff , it 's * really * , ** really ** fucking good . 
  people occasionally have issues with their subscription boxes , but for the most part it works well . 
  they have a great model for sharing revenue with video producers . 
  their ability to stream large quantities of video to huge numbers of users , in a wide variety of content formats ( in terms of quality of video and devices it 's being played back on ) is n't even * close * to being approached by anyone else . 
  and the comments change was a massive improvement . 
  longer comments allow for more well-explained debate . 
  in-line replies allow people to have conversations better , and not repeat the same thing in eight different disparate chat threads . 
  links allow supporting sources to be provided . 
  and formatting lets you make things that are easier to read . 
  all that is why youtube has its dominant position , and why it 's so hard for someone else to break in . 
  but they 've clearly fucked up regarding copyright issues , and it 's something that i , and many other users , really hate . 
  i 'm a huge google fanboy , but i just despise the way they treat youtube and youtubers . 
  i really do hope someone can come in and match them , because more competition would hopefully force youtube to do better for users on the copyright front . 
  and if not , at least users could go elsewhere to share their content -- and viewers will doubtless follow where the good content is . 
  i really do hope this can happen . 
  i just ca n't see it happening . 
  the cost of entry is too high ... 
  yeah , it 's a chicken and egg problem that 's pretty tough to solve . 
  yahoo would be a good potential contender , definitely . 
  if that 's what they want to do . 
  it 's just that , considering users currently ca n't upload their own content at all -- or if they can , it 's at least hidden enough that i could n't find it -- i do n't think that 's what they want to do . 
  i think they 're more going for the hulu or netflix market . 
  why do you disagree with the g + thing ? 
  you 're not one of those reactionaries who hates it just because it 's integrated with a different system , are you ? 
  or do you have an actual functional criticism of the features of the new system versus the old ? 
  regarding microsoft , i definitely think they could make a splash if they tried . 
  i would n't mind seeing it . 
  does n't have to pretend to * be * the parents . 
  if her parents died , anyone who offered to comfort her and appeared nice would probably find her willing to accept . 
  regardless , that is an ** amazing ** character concept . 
  i rather like the idea of [ montagues and capulets ] ( http://youtu.be/tf8pa3vvldy ) , or the [ ghost waltz ] ( http://youtu.be/xghw21qsqsm ) . 
  a piece like toccata and fugue in dm , davy jones from pirates of the caribbean , or like [ passacaglia and fugue in cm ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f51uhph3yqk ) are great if you 're using an organ , but significantly less great on a piano . 
  edit : another good one is [ night on a bald mountain ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u2bc96z3qu ) . 
  always with the piano arrangements of orchestral works . 
  his beethoven symphony arrangements are incredible . 
  unfortunately it 's still occasionally buggy , which is a nuisance . 
  even beyond that , as designed it certainly has its flaws , for example , controversial posts tend to float to the top since lots of people are commenting and debating in the replies . 
  but conversations are * so * much easier now , since every conversation on a particular topic is in a single thread , rather than just wherever . 
  and urgh . 
  i really ca n't stand tb . 
  he talks some really good points , but the guy is so fucking up himself it just gets on my nerves . 
  his reaction to that is actually a perfect example of `` one of those reactionaries '' i was talking about in the previous comment . 
   i 'll bet more than one person has wound up doing an unnecessary full reinstall of ubuntu in order to fix this type of issue, 
  heh ... that 's what i 've just done . 
  had barely anything on there worth keeping , and i was just running in to so many issues i figured it 's better to just start from scratch . 
  thanks for the help , though !, 
  if the problems come up again i 'll try it out . 
  sort of , i guess . 
  the thing is , like many such issues , it 's a spectrum . 
  some people can do nearly everything with both hands , equally . 
  some people have varied levels of confidence with each hand with different things . 
  for example , i hold a bat ( cricket or baseball ) and swing a golf club right handed . 
  i would be absolutely hopeless left handed , flailing everywhere . 
  i fence left handed , but using my right hand i 'm still decent enough that i can stand my own against people who are a noticeable amount worse than me -- but not ridiculously worse . 
  i right with me left hand , but my right handed handwriting is better than most righties ' left hand .
