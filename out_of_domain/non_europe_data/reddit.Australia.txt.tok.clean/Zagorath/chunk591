  windows vista was 6.0 , win7 was 6.1 , and the first version of win8 was 6.2 . 
   i was raised to look the part, 
  then do that . 
  looking `` the part '' means dressing `` the part '' . 
  and in the case of a job where the part wears a polo shirt and shorts , being in a suit is very definitely * not * looking the part . 
  it 's actually built in to android . 
  samsung for some reason decided to make their own that only works on samsung ( samsung has a tendency to do shit like that ) , but any android phone with nfc can do it . 
  my headcanon : glee takes place in the arrowverse . 
  whose face , and when ? 
  i 've seen a few people also call it the cwverse , but if they end up doing a cross over with supergirl we wo n't even be able to use that :\\, 
  i believe most people would find ` while ( true ) ` more readable than ` for ( ;  ` . 
  but after using the ` #define ` in the way described , ` for ever ` is more readable again . 
  honestly , i 'm very skeptical that this happens in any developed western nation outside of the us . 
  but i would n't be all that surprised if he 's correct that it * does * happen in america . 
  have you got any sources on this ? 
  i 'd be interested in it happening anywhere , but i 'm especially skeptical that it could be happening within developed western nations other than the us . 
  particularly australia , new zealand , and the european union . 
  is this a reference to something i 'm missing , or do you actually not know ? 
  a decent nickname in a general sense . 
  i was just looking for ones that are particularly australian sounding . 
  keep watching . 
  trust me , you 'll love the show , but i also do n't want to spoil you the fun of seeing how it all develops on its own . 
  i will tell you , stay the ** fuck ** away from this subreddit , as well as the chuck wikia , and anything else remotely chuck-related , until you 've finished watching it . 
  please just trust me on this . 
  that 's not what the term conspiracy means in conspiracy theorist . 
  when people talk about conspiracy theories , they 're referring to people who believe that the information understood by the general public ( usually as a result of reporting in the media or by politicians ) is wrong , due to an intentional lie or cover up by some involved party ( again , usually media or politicians ) . 
   the stories are the content of the sub , not the edition itself, 
  which is exactly the reason i do n't really see the need for this . 
  readers do n't really * gain * anything from knowing the edition -- it is n't useful in deciding which content to read ( which is the main purpose of tagging ) , and has very limited use in terms of interpreting what they 've read ( a major secondary use ) . 
  so why have them at all ? 
  hey , sorry for the late response , i 've been away from the computer . 
  yeah , i 've disabled ipv6 and it 's still just as bad . 
  no , this came with only freedos , and ubuntu was the first usable os installed on it . 
  i 'm considering throwing a windows install on it to test if perhaps it 's the computer that 's the problem . 
  any tips for how to do this ? 
  most guides online are for installing ubuntu after having windows on it , not the other way around , and the only dual-boots i 've ever done were using bootcamp . 
  i 've never had the need for dual booting before . 
   but it muffles allot, 
  [ but this kills the alot ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_d_z-d2tzi14/s8trio4br3i/aaaaaaaacv4/zh7_gcmlrko/s400/alot.png ) . 
   who gives a shit anyway ? 
  any cardio is better than no cardio, 
  this * is * true , but if the study had achieved the results it did with a reliable method , it * would n't * be . 
  that 's why people give a shit . 
  not associating votes with voters is an absolutely * crucial * aspect of any good democratic system . 
  it has to be * impossible * , or near enough to it , once a vote has been cast , for anyone to find out who voted for whom . 
  it would be relatively easy ( though not by any means trivial ) to create an electronic system of voting that is secure but not anonymous , but such a system is inherently bad . 
  not to mention that users are terrible . 
  you can guarantee they 'd find a way to fuck up their authentication . 
  hahaha . 
  i 'm sure it does . 
  and yeah , the phrase is `` a lot '' , two words . 
  it 's difficult since they 're more or less homophonic ( sound the same ) , and also `` a lot '' , `` allot '' and `` alot '' are all correct words * . 
  `` a lot '' being a large number of things . 
  `` allot '' being a verb for `` to give out '' , and `` alot '' being the animal i showed above -- kinda . 
  \\* the `` alot '' is actually a fictional creature created specifically to make jokes about the common misspelling of `` a lot '' . 
  it 's either that , or stuff that 's so ridiculously niche or random , like [ the best method for counting a lot of vertical parallel lines ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeprotips/comments/2usa2b/lpt_it_is_easier_to_count_parallel_vertical_lines/ ) . 
   they 're not likely to release another non-retina macbook pro, 
  this makes me so sad . 
  the benefits of the mbpw/r are just not worth it compared to the mbpw/or . 
  or at least , they were n't back when there was still a 15 '' non-retina . 
  i honestly do n't know what i 'm gon na do when it comes time to replace my current laptop . 
  the retina devices are just way too expensive , and there 's no longer an option for dedicated video card unless you go retina . 
  there 's literally no way for me to get a dedicated graphics card without spending $ 3,000 . 
  it 's just ... kinda sad to think about . 
  i 've never tried it for myself on windows ( mainly because i never thought to google it before now ) , but [ this application ] ( https://code.google.com/p/dvorak-qwerty/ ) claims to be directly emulating the absolutely * fantastic * keyboard layout that 's included by default in os x , which does exactly what you 're looking for . 
  so , the other guy 's deleted his comments , so i do n't know exactly what he 's said . 
  but really , season 2 of each version is surprisingly similar if you look just a touch below the surface . 
  i ca n't really remember the plot details , but look at the character interactions . 
  look at the personality of the king versus the president , and how the respective fus deal with them . 
  it 's really very similar . 
  i do wonder if they 're gon na give him a demise . 
  i mean , given the source material as well as the heavily shakespearean-tragedy influence of the show , you 'd have to expect they will . 
  but maybe that 's exactly why they * wo n't * do it . 
  instead , if they did something like [ this original post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/houseofcards/comments/2025s4/does_anyone_else_just_want_to_see_frank_win/ ) or [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/houseofcards/comments/2q7gww/is_it_safe_to_watch_the_first_two_seasons_of_the/cn8vf4j ) ( uk version spoilers ) , it could be interesting . 
  the only thing i can think of is that they do awesome things , but they do them decades after it 's already been done down south in aus and nz . 
   efforts to remove the penny are in large part being pushed by retailers who would be allowed to advertise prices by the cent then round to the nickel, 
  this theory only works if you assume people usually only buy one thing . 
  in reality , people tend to buy multiple items at once . 
  if you buy three or four items ending in .99 c , it ends up ending in .97 or .96 ( and similarly 8 or 9 items is .92 or .91 ) and the consumer ends up saving money . 
  in the long run , assuming the amount of items you buy varies roughly uniformly , you break even . 
  and if you really wanted , you could carefully count the items that you buy to always gain money , but realistically , who 's got time for that ? 
   though an online one is a terrible idea, 
  not at all . 
  lastpass is probably the most popular of all the password safes ( saves ?? ), 
  and it 's online . 
  the catch is that they do n't store your key and all decryption is done locally , so even though you can access it from any computer in the world , you still do n't need to worry about breaches or rogue employees in lastpass . 
  if it 's a text he can easily dismiss the whole problem as `` actually , you do n't know if they 've read it or not anyway '' . 
  no need for any of the justifications for why even if they * have * read it , that does n't matter . 
  fa do do ? 
  yeah that was all i could get out of it until i read the other comments . 
  i assumed it was referencing the federal communications commission , but i could n't see the point they were making . 
  so , i realise that the pronunciation of different musical notes in the non-lettered method differs sometimes ( ti vs. si , for example ) . 
  but i do n't think i 've ever heard of a being called `` le '' before , it 's always been `` la '' in my experience . 
   lls already neglect their rental properties now anyway . 
  sounds to me like this is what needs to be fixed , not forcing them to keep the price stagnant relative to long term changes in market price . 
  question 22 referenced answers to 17 and 18 , but those questions were unrelated . 
  i think it should have been asking about 20 and 21 . 
   it 's that thingy where the tonic is always do, 
   also treble clef , mate . 
  f c c , not bass clef 's a e e.
