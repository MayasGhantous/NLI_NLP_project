  yeah i know that . 
  i mentioned `` a being called ... '' just because it got the point across that i 've never heard `` la '' , only `` le '' , and in non-moveable solfege , la is a. 
   in a minor key , you get do re me fa so le te do . 
  - i gets lowered to - e. 
  oh that 's interesting . 
  i did n't know that . 
  - i and - a both get lowered , then ? 
  how does this interact with a static do = = c system ? 
  do you just lower the third , sixth , and seventh notes to - e ? 
  yeah , wiping it 's what i 'm doing right now . 
  i 'm in the windows set up , at the stage of selecting a partition , and there are currently three partitions . 
  1 has a size of 512 mb with 507 remaining , 3 has 1.9 gb and is full , with 2 making up the balance . 
  i ca n't imagine there would be , but i just want to make sure before i go through with it , is there any potential risk in deleting and then reformatting partitions 1 and 3 ? 
  edit : in ubuntu , they 're called / dev/sda1 ( which is fat32 , mounted at / boot/efi ) , / dev/sda2 ( ext4 , mounted at / ) , and / dev/sda3 ( file system `` linux-swap '' , no mount point ) . 
  suicide is definitely an option . 
  i believe he mentioned at some point how his father was weak for being unable to even take his own life once he was no longer useful , or something like that . 
  it 's also , if i 'm not mistaken , what happened in the original novel ( which is what season 1 of this show and season 1 of the uk version of the show are based upon -- though both of those decided to have him kill the girl rather than commit suicide ) . 
  so there 's both precedent to it with the source material , and potential foreshadowing within this show . 
  i personally do n't really `` want '' it to do anything . 
  the way i see it , there are three possibilities . 
  ** spoilers ** for both the original novel and the uk show below . 
  he commits suicide after being disgraced somehow . 
  ( the original novel did this . ), 
  he gets killed . 
  especially if it 's a betrayal from someone he trusted and/or was done out of mercy by the person who killed him/ordered the kill . 
  ( this is what happened in the uk show . ), 
  he does n't die , probably with same direct reference to the idea that -- because of the show 's shakespearean influences -- by all rights , he should have . 
  sort of like [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/houseofcards/comments/2025s4/does_anyone_else_just_want_to_see_frank_win/ ) and [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/houseofcards/comments/2q7gww/is_it_safe_to_watch_the_first_two_seasons_of_the/cn8vf4j ) mention . 
  any one of these options , in theory , i 'd be happy with . 
  i 'm more interested in whether or not they execute it well when they do it . 
  and considering the quality of the show thus far , i would be extremely surprised if they * do n't * end it in a satisfying way . 
  oh wow , are you the original author ? 
  just want to say , ** massive ** props to you for this . 
  it 's probably my favourite d&d / roleplaying game-related story , and definitely at least in the top 5 . 
  and thanks for explaining all those questions . 
  so , this is just something you wrote up , right ? 
  it was n't based on an actual campaign you played ? 
  that 's certainly what it seems like for the most part , but then you mentioned just above that you had a `` gm only map '' . 
  anyway , if you 're interested in more people 's responses to it , there was another thread on / r/gametales , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2oicie/stranded_in_fantasy_xpost_from_rdndgreentext/ ) . 
  oh interesting . 
  did the campaign that you ran start out the same ? 
  with humans coming from our world to this one ? 
  i 'm just really curious about how you played that out mechanically , if so . 
  got ta be honest , i 'd be interested in reading whatever it is you actually did manage to write , though i can totally understand if you 'd rather not share an uncompleted work . 
  arsenal is n't an archaic term at all . 
  in fact , i 'm fairly sure most people would be more likely to associate it with an arsenal of modern weapons instead . 
  that 's why he usually does n't take up the name `` arsenal '' until he gives up the medieval weapons and starts using guns and stuff . 
  1 -- 3 are all definitely real problems . 
  3 in particular is annoying because many people have replies disabled * by accident * , and it is n't clear how to fix it . 
  i would n't mind 2 so much if they 'd just remove the downvote button entirely . 
  if you 're going to use a positive-only ranking method ( which is what facebook uses , and has become an important part of their brand ) , then * own * it . 
  do n't pretend to have a reddit-like system when you do n't . 
  you 've slightly simplified 1 , but pretty much , yeah . 
  real problem . 
  it is n't just a matter of `` sorted by number of replies '' , but number of replies definitely weighs in on the algorithm a little more heavily than it perhaps should . 
  a nice idea , but does n't work in practice . 
  4 , on the other hand , is something that they actually * have * improved significantly with the g + integration . 
  at the same time they introduced it , they also gave uploaders [ a suite of much more powerful moderation tools ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv4f3kgg6gi ) . 
  it 's just that they a ) did a poor job of advertising this , and as a result b ) people do n't use it very much . 
  i do n't know how creators can give others moderator status , but i read somewhere recently ( may even have been this thread ) that it is , in fact , possible . 
  it 's not an option i 've ever seen , though . 
  perhaps only available to the really heavy users . 
  and they actually do remove spam automatically by some means . 
  i 've had a few spam comments on a couple of my videos that i get an automated youtube email notifying me about ( my volume is low enough that i have it set to email me for every comment ) , but when i go to remove it , it turns out it 's already gone . 
  i think this is only in extreme cases where the whole account got banned because they were a serial offender or something , but i 'm not entirely sure . 
  what 's gort ? 
  there 's a fantastic story about a necromancer on / r/dndgreentext . 
  do n't let the title fool you , he 's definitely not evil . 
  it 's called [ an evil necromancer in an online solo game ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2grdzv/an _ evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game / ) . 
  another very good one is [ bob andyourname , the town 's incinerator ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2kk0p2/bob _ andyourname_the_towns_incinerator / ) . 
  [ easily readable for me ] ( http://imgur.com/ork7din ) , no need to view source or zoom in or anything . 
  i ca n't comment on hl2 , i 've never played it ( i ca n't stand hl1 enough to finish it , and i refuse to move on until i can play the series in order ) . 
  but gamers are n't against linear games all of a sudden recently . 
  some of the most popular games of 2013 were extremely linear . 
  the last of us works really well as a god damn * movie * , and bioshock infinite was also very linear . 
  both are overwhelmingly regarded as incredible games . 
  mate , you 're delusional if you think you 're in the minority . 
  it 's impossible to say anything negative about the half life series without getting downvoted to oblivion . 
  more uk version ** spoilers ** below :, 
  what if they were in on it ? 
  that 's basically how it happened in the uk version , the hit was organised by his wife and his bodyguard . 
  imagine if they made meechum the assassin . 
  yeah i 'm not entirely convinced it 's going to happen . 
  if it does , though , i suspect it would be a mercy killing . 
  pretty sure he means the end of the whole show . 
  and there 's certainly good reason to suspect that this may also be the end of season 3 ( but there 's also a few reasons to go against that ) . 
  yeah . 
  colleges are an important part of our education system in australia , and for a federal member of parliament to come out and criticise them is just bad form . 
   edit : [ love the image that the australian is using ] ( http://imgur.com/zfsv0hv ) ( on such an occasion , i made an exception by visiting their site ) . 
  thanks for taking the hit so the rest of us do n't have to . 
  the couple of times i 've submitted something it 's been because i heard it on the radio , or when i heard something on the radio , and then followed it up on youtube and clicked related links to that . 
  my radio station -- abc classic fm -- has a fantastic balance of the more popular music and more obscure things . 
  you can see music listings [ here ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/classic/music-listings/ ) , and they 've got a link to listen live on that page . 
  it 's available worldwide , which is pretty nice . 
  it works perfectly under windows . 
  do you think there 's any chance a different distribution of linux might work better ? 
  html5 + css3 is , yes . 
  the built-in screenshot functions in windows are crap anyway . 
  better to install a third-party utility like sharex , which -- among other things -- has custom keyboard shortcuts . 
  nah , they 're probably all on spartan .
