  ca n't disagree with that one . 
  my understanding is that reddit gold was there , but `` gilding '' comments was n't . 
  i could be wrong , though . 
  rsr is what first turned me on to reddit , and it was n't until a few months later that i actually joined . 
  this only works if * both * parties are rational . 
  torrent sites , too . 
   who does n't use adblock ? 
  anyone who wants to not be an arsehole and would prefer to actually support the sites that they frequent . 
  you really should . 
  i mean , leave it on if you want , but at least whitelist all the sites you frequent ( presumably at least reddit , facebook , and a bunch of google properties incl . 
  youtube ) . 
  this is exactly the same fallacious reasoning that some people use when they decide not to vote . 
  it 's also very closely related to the psychological phenomenon wherein a person will not help out a stranger in public because they assume `` someone else will help '' . 
  it is absolutely not good reasoning . 
  you should really rethink the `` five most upvoted '' thing . 
  last time i saw a competition do that , all people were doing was downvoting all the competition to help prop themselves up . 
  i really think it would be better for all if you hand-picked the best ones . 
   as if it were implying there were some sort of link between vaccines and cancer . 
  there is , actually . 
  but it 's not what the anti-vaxxers probably want you to think . 
  certain vaccines can prevent you getting a disease that will increase your chance of getting cancer . 
  thank god for compiler errors for small omissions , eh ? 
  precisely . 
  i say they just make stewart his middle name and call him john stewart diggle . 
  no need to retcon his name , and only a slight deviation from comic canon . 
  agree completely . 
  personally , i really do want him to reveal his middle name is stewart and become a green lantern , but if they do n't do that , there 's still plenty they could do with him , just so long as they do * something * . 
  yeah , not to mention they 've already hinted at the emotional spectrum in the arrowverse , and had some other scenes with diggle having green lantern symbolism . 
  just reveal that diggle 's middle name is stewart , and the whole thing will be such a small departure from canon it 's ridiculous . 
  more specifically , they mentioned of the colour red that it is related to anger . 
  he certainly does n't * need * to be , but the links make it the obvious choice . 
  he 's a black male named john who served time in the military . 
  the episode of the flash where they hinted at the concept of the emotional spectrum was an episode that also featured diggle . 
  not to mention the symbolism in the first scene he appeared that episode , with the green lamp . 
   i 'm waiting until its no longer a statement to be watching it though, 
  now 's probably a decent time , then . 
  the original show has been finished for over half a decade , and even the sequel show is now done for good . 
  it 's easily my favourite animated show ( and , fwiw , second place goes to young justice -- a dc property ) . 
  but i have to agree with / u/aexsburg , you probably want to avoid the fanbase , * especially * if you then go on to watch legend of korra . 
  haha i re-watched that episode just yesterday , too !, 
  season 2 , episode 10 , `` chuck versus the delorean '' . 
  huh ... 
  it never occurred to me that they 'd be a website . 
  but yes , they 're definitely a travel book series -- arguably * the * travel book series , it 's the one you see people travelling with all the time -- and i just checked , they do indeed also have a website with forums and guides and stuff . 
   use the sum function after about 13 mouse clicks, 
  is n't the auto sum button in the default toolbar ? 
  ( not to mention , '' = sum ( select range with mouse ) '' really is n't that hard , i 'd expect anyone with even a novice level of experience with excel to know it , but then people will always find a way to not learn things when it comes to computers ... ), 
  i could be wrong -- it 's been a long time since i 've done any work in excel -- but what if both `` op '' and `` monster '' were named cells ? 
  i have n't used excel in ages , but would n't this work if both `` op '' and `` monster '' were named cells ? 
   = = = is comparing, 
  most of the biggest languages do n't use this . 
  python , c ( and all the c family ) , and java certainly do n't , for example . 
  js does , and i think php does , too . 
  yeah that 's definitely possible -- even probable . 
  i would * really * like to see gl come to the show , but i 'm not especially expecting it . 
  i do think , however , that if a green lantern * does * get introduced into this series , it 'll probably be done through diggle . 
  dude !, 
  stop drawing all these awesome things . 
  you 're making me feel bad about myself !, 
  nah but seriously , it seems that each one you do is just a little better than the last , and it * started * at a really awesome place . 
  keep up the good work !, 
  haha fair enough . 
  just remember that = = = means that they 're equal in value * and type * , while = = just means equal in value . 
  in other languages , = = will either implicitly cast them to the same type ( if you try 3 = = 3.5 , it 'll convert 3 into 3.0 ) , or may just give an error , and if you want to check the type that has to be a separate operation . 
  ( and , for what it 's worth , once you 're happy with you js knowledge , i 'd personally recommend python as a next step . 
  it 's a perfect introduction to basic concepts of object oriented programming . 
  there are some great tutorials available for it online , and coursera regularly runs courses on it . ), 
  yeah that 's exactly how i felt at the end . 
  i really was n't a fan of it , but god forbid you mention anything about that in the subreddit . 
  it was all `` all hail sly fucking fox '' . 
  and as you say , perma-off-season subreddits are rarely worth staying subbed to . 
  the only one i 'm subbed to is / r/chuck , and that 's a show i did n't watch until years after it had finished airing , so the subreddit is so quiet now that it 's not so bad . 
  honestly i have a hard time believing anyone who claims they do n't sound similar . 
  seems more likely to me that they have an unrealistic expectation of what `` sounds similar '' means , than the idea that they actually pronounce them so differently that they really are n't similar . 
  i * can * imagine some accents where the two are nearly identical , though that 's not how i would say them . 
  the only reasonable force is a pvc ballista . 
  wait really ? 
  i 've felt that the last few episodes were this season finally hitting its stride after most of the first half of season 3 has been lacking . 
  someone needs to make another post complaining about all the duplicate complaint posts , just for the irony of it . 
  [ i had n't seen that post before ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/10k17b/questions_about_potato_cannon/ ) . 
  i was referring to [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/auslaw/comments/266dd7/owning_a_ballista/ ) . 
  have you any evidence that kleenex , xerox , band-aid , and hoover are * legally * genericised trademarks ? 
  if average people use it in conversation in a generic way , that does n't have any impact , legally . 
  it 's only if publications use it in that way and they do n't take action . 
  for example , if bing were to start saying `` google with bing '' in its advertising . 
  you 'll also notice that google never uses `` google '' as a verb . 
  have skill rolls ever been able to crit ? 
  all i know for certain is that they have n't worked since 4e . 
  aside from basic items -- potions , food , etc. 
  -- they could save up for big things , like a fortress or a ship . 
  if you want it to fit the idea of a duelist better in terms of roleplay , you could consider the shield to be more of a buckler . 
  it sounds like they * do * want combat , but do n't like how the dnd mechanics for fighting work . 
  honestly i agree . 
  i absolutely love 4th edition ( and i know that 's not a popular opinion on any of the dnd subreddits ) , but its combat * really * drags . 
  my group usually only gets one , * maybe * two combats per session , just because we ca n't fit any more in . 
  i ran 5e , and with only about two thirds the time , managed 3 proper encounters and one rushed one . 
  haha , well thanks for accidentally showing me that thread , then . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's not terrible . 
  certainly the degree holds the same level of reputation that any bsc at uq does . 
  i do n't know all the details , i 've only looked at the course list for the computer science major -- there might be further general bsc requirements that round it out a bit .
