  it 's just that , for learning actual programming , the software engineering degree has a much greater range of options to get a more in-depth education . 
  same with the bachelor of it , particularly with a major in `` computer systems and networks '' or `` software design '' . 
  it 's not so much about the quality as the range of choices . 
  my recommendation would be take a look over the course lists and see if you think it might be worth swapping to one of the others . 
  there 's enough overlap that you should n't have too much difficulty . 
  but even if you do n't switch , i 'm sure the bsc is a perfectly fine degree . 
  although interestingly , tom riddle is extremely like sauron . 
  not just that they 're both the main villains in their respective books , but also that both are essentially liches . 
  beings that tied their soul to a physical object ( a phylactery ) in order to extend their lives/power . 
  obviously it does n't * quite * work , since sauron was never a human to begin with , and rather than extended his life through the pouring his soul into the ring , he increased his power over others . 
  but it 's an interesting thought even so . 
   ooh . 
  so i read the hobbit , the trilogy, 
  so , fun fact , but if you 're reading them * , the lord of the rings is not actually a trilogy . 
  to quote the `` note on the text '' from my single-volume edition, 
   * the lord of the rings * is often erroneously called a trilogy , when it is in fact a single novel , consisting of six books plus appendices , sometimes published in three volumes . 
  \\* as opposed to watching the movies , which * are * a trilogy . 
  grey never forgets to make a video on a topic , he just leaves it months and months and months at a time . 
  but then you have to receive * emails * ... 
  that 's just a part of his deception . 
  he does n't want us to know that he 's truly a robot . 
  oh no , do n't be sad . 
  learning new things is great , and there 's no shame in not knowing it to begin with . 
  `` nothing happens '' in the event of a hidden character trying to remain hidden , just means `` he does n't get seen '' . 
  it 's not like the rule would prevent him from moving or anything like that . 
  just that , raw ( and rai ) , a character who was stealthed before the contest is still stealthed after it . 
  the problem is when devs * do * do something like that , they get criticised for the world not being open enough . 
  if it makes you feel better , it seemed pretty clear to me that it was off in the distance . 
   in more modern times , it has been erroneously assumed to be exclusive to the denial of the god of the abrahamic religions, 
  really ? 
  i 've never seen anyone make this mistake . 
  of course , it 's usually used in the context of someone whose cultural upbringing was within the abrahamic religions , but that 's more a result of those being among the most widely practised religions , and more importantly nearly the * only * practised religions in developed western nations , rather than people mistaking its meaning . 
  i 'm a big fan of my classical radio station . 
  they stream online without geo-restrictions . 
  a really good range of music including well-loved classics and more obscure `` gems '' ( i almost hate myself for using the term , but it seemed fitting ) . 
  my ( admittedly very brief ) search did n't turn up anything for windows or os x , but there is an [ android app ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thx.tuneup.free&amp;hl=en ) , if you have something that can run that . 
   is there shame in not caring and wanting to forget what i just read ? 
  yes . 
  there * very much * is . 
  willful ignorance is one of the worst personal traits a person can have that does n't directly harm others . 
  which is why i said `` if you have something that can run that '' , rather than `` if you have an android phone or tablet '' . 
   god exists . 
   god is all-powerful . 
   god is all-loving, 
  i know you said you do n't want these challenged , but these three points are * fundamentally * incompatible when one looks at the world today . 
  if there is a god and he is all-powerful , then the existence of immense suffering in the world , in particular , immense suffering among those who have done nothing wrong , the completely innocent -- young children , for example -- then that god * can not * be benevolent and loving . 
  if he is indeed loving , then the existence of suffering * necessitates * that he is not all-powerful , because he would have done something to stop it . 
  it 's what 's known as epicurus ' trilemma , and it fundamentally disproves the existence of the abrahamic god ( the god in christianity , judaism , and islam ) . 
  [ stephen fry puts it * very * nicely ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-suvkwnysqo ) . 
  so yeah , the science courses generally prefer it if you 've done maths c , but have a simple provision to provide the equivalent to that if you 've already done maths b. 
  doing only maths a ( or equivalent ) will probably make it much harder , and i 'm not sure if you can get in with that at all . 
  i could be wrong , though , someone else will , i 'm sure , step in to correct me . 
  a m\u00f8\u00f8se once bit my sister . 
  the thing that 's really starting to get to me about this shown is the amount of faux-science that they 've got going on . 
  it 's really distracting . 
  still a fantastic show , but it does take my mind out of it for a moment every time they say something sciencey that makes no sense . 
  / r/movies had a few good suggestions about how they could go about it . 
  throwing the character in with zero backstory would just feel wrong , but they could do something like show just the scene where uncle ben dies and have peter remember the `` great power '' speech into a post-credits scene of a movie before he makes his first real appearance . 
  people in the / r/movies thread were saying that they already mentioned parker by name in the announcement . 
  i really just do n't get it . 
  i 've heard so many people talking about how subscriptions are a problem and do n't work correctly . 
  things like subscription videos just not appearing , as well as more recently this facebook-like algorithm thing . 
  but i 've personally * never * had a problem with it . 
  as far as i 'm aware , i 've never missed a video from a channel i subscribe to . 
  still , the sheer number of people complaining about it , it 's impossible not to believe them all . 
  so i 'm sure it 's a real problem , but for whatever reason , i 've never experienced it . 
  but yeah , i just do n't want my email clogged up . 
  it 's already too busy with mail lists and stuff . 
  i 'm happy to rely on this subreddit ( which i have ifttt getting every post to as a notification on my phone ) . 
  that , plus yt 's subscriptions , plus an rss subscription to your blog , seem to do fine for me . 
  on a note vaguely related to this , has anyone else recently ( past two to three weeks or so ) started getting email notifications for a bunch of their subscriptions ' videos ? 
  i started getting them , and there was no way to stop them except on a channel-by-channel basis * as the videos came out * . 
  there was supposed to be check boxes that you could uncheck , but they already were . 
  until just a couple of days ago when the boxes started working correctly and i could uncheck them . 
  it 's not like this is a new thing , either . 
  samsung has * never * been a company that makes products that are as good for the consumer as they could . 
  they put all their stupid crap-ware on their phones rather than using native android ( or close to it ) , and they make their own versions of features already included in it . 
  this is worse for the consumer , but better for samsung , so they do it . 
  they want to have their own ecosystem . 
  the samsung ecosystem , to compete with the google ecosystem and the apple one . 
  related , i urge people to watch [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ) . 
  that guy 's story , plus the other story he mentions ( more detailed links in the description ) , really reveal just how scummy samsung can be when they think they can get away with it . 
  my approach is very simple . 
  i boycott anything * branded * samsung . 
  it 's just too hard to avoid them completely , but at least avoiding anything that they 've made from start to finish -- their phones , tablets , tvs , etc. 
  -- is better than nothing . 
  [ here 's some more reason to never buy samsung again ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ) . 
  huh ? 
  the apostrophe/single-quotes he used were to indicate `` feet '' . 
  yeah , you pretty much only have the option of a nexus device if you want to avoid that . 
  the more recent motorolla devices ( the ones made while google owned them ) have also been really good , with only minimal extra stuff above what nexus devices have , and most of it actually * improving * the device . 
  nexus is great for other reasons , too , though . 
  the devices themselves tend to be * really * nicely built , rather than the ugly plastic designs samsung uses , and they also get updates the fastest of any android device out there . 
   believe it or not , but the general public does n't want a bare minimum os ( like stock android ) . 
  true , nobody wants stock android . 
  what they want is google 's android . 
  it takes the aosp and adds on google 's `` play '' services , but nothing more , and it 's the best form of android out there . 
  but then you 're paying more than you need to , since the smart functions are still in there . 
  they definitely do . 
  i helped my parents pick out a new tv just recently .
