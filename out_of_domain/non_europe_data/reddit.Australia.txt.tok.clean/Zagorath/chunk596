  that way the onus is on the plaintiff to make sure their case is good , since they 'll be paying their own legal fees regardless . 
  this would discourage warrantless patent cases from both patent trolls and giant corporations against their smaller competitors . 
  of course , it has the downside that it also discourages suits by smaller companies against big corporations who violate their legitimate patent claims . 
  i 'm just gon na point out that we do n't actually require stories be in greentext format . 
  no need to put your well-written prose into greentext if it 's still gon na actually be prose . 
  the trans pacific partnership is a `` trade agreement '' that many countries around the pacific ( including australia , much of eastern asia , and america ) are considering . 
  it would , among other things , allow companies to sue governments for violating the terms of the treaty with things like imposing restrictions on products for safety reasons . 
  this is a really basic overview , and if you live anywhere that might be considering signing it , i strongly recommend you find somewhere else to educate yourself more about it . 
  it 's a really big deal , and a really bad idea , but most of the media is largely remaining silent about it . 
  as a side note , in australia , tpp can also stand for :, 
  * the pirate party, 
  * two party preferred, 
  i do n't know 3rd edition , but in 4 and 5 a 20 is normally the only crit ( i.e. , there are normally no crit ranges ) , but certain specific features can give a character an extended crit range , such that 19 is a crit . 
  are you ignoring these features ( if any exist in 3e ) , or is what you 're referring to there something specific to 3e ? 
  that first one is , i think , widely regarded as good dming . 
  if there 's no consequence for failure ( either because they 're under time pressure or because failure would trigger some other event ) , then if it 's at all possible , no need to roll . 
  it 's often referred to as `` taking 20 '' . 
  the second one i 'm curious about . 
  what if one character lies to another . 
  if the other suspects them and asks to roll insight , would you allow the insight to reveal if the first player was lying ? 
  i have absolutely no problem with longer and more serious stories like this one here . 
  in fact , i 'd encourage it . 
  some of my personal favourite stories have been the longer ones in multiple screenshots , like the mechanic , the demigods one , and stranded . 
  that said , i would probably say that he did n't need to put '  ' before every paragraph in this case . 
  it does n't fit the greentext format . 
  shoulda just submitted it as prose . 
  and crossposting to gametales would certainly not be a bar thing in this case , either . 
   of course , only applies to 1-handed sword use . 
  i think one could make the argument that * dropping * a weapon should n't count as your 1 free item interaction , and thus if they wanted to drop the weapon completely and draw another weapon , even if it were two-handed , that should be allowed . 
  i do n't think i 've ever heard foy-yay before . 
  have heard both nitch and neesh , though . 
  i 'm australian , fwiw , but lived in asia among many britishers . 
  oh fair enough . 
  so basically you house rule in a 4e/5e style crit system into 3rd . 
  honestly i 've never found the need . 
  i 've just recently spent the past week setting up a computer for my parents , no dvorak , and without any special practice my qwerty was good enough that it was n't a pain . 
  if you 're going to be regularly using computers where you ca n't change the layout , and you need to do a lot of typing on them , it might be useful to deliberately maintain your qwerty speed . 
  but in most normal circumstances , any computer that you have to do a lot of typing on will be one that you can switch over anyway . 
  holy shit . 
  is ff.net a real site , used for fanfiction ? 
  that domain must be worth millions . 
  you sound like the perfect candidate for something from centrelink . 
  i assume you 're an australian citizen ? 
  i used one of [ these ] ( http://img1.wfrcdn.com/lf/49/hash/9823/8301744/1/do+not+set+live!5 '' + x +7 '' + gallery + hinged + triple + picture + frame + in + satin + blue.jpg ) last time i dmed . 
  had it in the house anyway , just took the photos out to make room for rule sheets . 
  i want to know why the korean one is in south-western china . 
  i agree . 
  hans zimmer did kill it . 
  but i mean that not in the hip slang way . 
  his score felt like coitus interruptus . 
  the basic thematic material was fantastic , but it never went anywhere . 
  it felt like it was building and building and building , but it never climaxed . 
  it just felt lacking . 
  it was pretty typical of zimmer 's music , really . 
  kinda cool and exciting in the moment , but just a few seconds of further thought and it 's impossible not to realise its flaws . 
  i thought that scene was about edginess . 
  honestly , i thought that was one of the worst scenes in the film . 
  the whole `` do n't show your powers , do n't use them to help people '' shtick was just dumb . 
  but the film never did a good job of showing us that . 
  that 's the problem with it . 
  check out any forum with serious musicians in it . 
  he 's the epitome of a dumb populist composer . 
  he is to film music what skrillex is to dubstep * . 
  one of my favourite groups of composers and orchestrators had to specifically ban criticism of him just because it 's such a popular topic . 
  people like john williams , james newton howard , and howard shore are the ones to look to for good scores . 
  ramin djawadi 's game of thrones score is another fantastic example , though personally i 've found his other work to be really bland . 
  i have a really long in-depth criticism of zimmer 's work that i usually give , but i 'm having trouble finding it on my phone . 
  i might edit this when i get to a computer if i can find it . 
  \\* i actually do n't know anything about dubstep . 
  i 'm basing this only on the comments i 've seen from a few people who are serious into dubstep . 
  i thought the spiders scene was pretty lacking compared to what i imagined in my head . 
  but the troll scene was just perfect . 
  i 've always said avatar was not a film , it 's a special effects demo . 
  no i totally get that that 's what they * wanted * to show us . 
  but they never did . 
  they * told * it to us a few times , but it felt forced . 
  it was never organic . 
  and so it never really felt like there was any reason for the character of clark to actually live by that rule . 
  colleges usually resume in o-week , actually . 
  so he could try a week before uni itself starts . 
  i think one of the big issues with zimmer is that his music is really lacking in what i consider the single most important aspect of * film * music . 
  and that 's a strong use of leitmotifs representing a person , place , or idea . 
  listen to star wars , and see the use of `` the force '' theme throughout the series , or `` dark vader 's theme '' . 
  and the cleverness in the prequels ( williams ' score in the prequels is one of my favourite things about them ) where anakin 's theme resembles vader 's theme in its harmonic content , but with a more innocent sounding melody . 
  similarly , some of the things djawadi does in game of thrones are just genius . 
  mixing the various themes together as different characters meet up in different places doing different things . 
  [ there 's a great analysis of this over here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bulzc/musical_themes_and_motifs_in_ramin_djawadis_score/ ) . 
  both of these composers also make really good melodic content and harmony , and zimmer 's pretty good in that respect . 
  but he lacks what 's necessary to be a really good * film * composer . 
  in his defence , i feel mos was one of his best in this respect . 
  he certainly does make some attempt with these things , but it just is n't as in-depth as shore or williams do on a regular basis . 
  anyway , i 'm on a computer now , so [ here 's a link to a previous rant on the topic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/20oycb/whats_the_worst_movie_you_love/cg5k05v?context=2 ) . 
  and i 'll end by adding the same ** dl ; dr ** from that comment :, 
   film music geek rants about how overrated zimmer is . 
   some people remap the caps lock on their desktop pc to backspace, 
  i believe this is the standard way of going about things in colemak , too . 
  haha do n't get me wrong . 
  i do n't actually think he killed it . 
  i was just exaggerating in order to respond to the comment above claiming he ` killed it ' in a good way . 
  i do n't think he 's especially terrible , just wildly overrated and kinda mediocre .
