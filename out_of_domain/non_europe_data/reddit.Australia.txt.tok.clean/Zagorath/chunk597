  i 've definitely enjoyed quite a few of his scores . 
  for what it 's worth , my favourite of his is probably the pirates of the caribbean series , especially the second one . 
  the song at the beginning is just chilling . 
   i adore trombones - not just the instrument but the whole trombone lifestyle . 
  love it . 
  you prefaced your comment with `` no '' , and then went on to say * exactly the same point * that the comment you replied to did , just in a slightly more tactful way . 
   america is a continent, 
  [ urgh ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ubcq1x7p34 ) . 
  tl ; dw : what a `` continent '' is does n't have a definite definition . 
  most english speakers consider north and south america to be two separate continents . 
  it 's mainly only latin americans that disagree . 
  fwiw , though , to me it seems that the latin american idea that the americas are one continent is dumb . 
  they do n't consider eurasia one continent typically , do they ? 
  if you 're gon na merge any of the continents together , it should be europe and asia . 
  * then * you can consider merging the americas into one , and maybe africa into afro-eurasia , too . 
  i tend to go with the 6 continent model . 
  eurasia , africa , oceania , antarctica , north america , south america . 
  but really , the definition is vague , so whatever you believe , it 's not wrong . 
  it * is * wrong to go around `` correcting '' people like you did in that comment , though . 
  and pounds instead of kilos . 
  new zealand ca n't even get their damn flag right . 
  [ stars are n't bloody red , and there 's clearly a 5th star in the middle , there ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/crux_ ( southern_cross \\ ) _ from_hobart , _ tasmania.jpg ) . 
  and you think we can trust them with the whole english language ? 
   reverting to middle english, 
  on account of the whole lord of the rings thing , why not convert it all to middle-earthish ( i.e. , westron ) . 
   which is pretty clear to me to mean `` fitness requirement needs to be low for women or only a few rare muscular ones will get through '' . 
  i feel like that 's a really bad misinterpretation of it . 
  what they 're saying is `` there should be one fitness requirement , but perhaps it should be set at a level that women are more likely to be able to reach '' . 
   american means someone from the continent of america but also someone from usa, 
  it * only * means the former if you consider `` america '' a continent . 
  most english speakers do n't . 
  [ i gave a more detailed response to the parent comment , here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2w0hul/letter_frequency_in_different_languages_oc/comync7?context=1 ) . 
  * exactly * . 
  now you fucking get it !, 
  3rd party apps are * enormously * better . 
  my recommendation is pocketcasts , because their server-side technology means you can refresh and look for new episodes much faster and using less data . 
  the devs are also really fun . 
  i enjoy reading the changelogs when they update the app . 
  but any of these other solutions are still going to be so much better than the podcast application included with your system -- regardless of which system that is . 
  p.s. , \u2122 , 
  let us look at the current situation . 
  women * are * able to get in , and it 's often because they have a lower standard of entry than men . 
  clearly , then , the lower standard is at least * acceptable * for the job , because they would n't be hiring them if they were gon na get themselves and other people * killed * . 
  so why should the standard for men be so much higher , if the lower standard for women is acceptable ? 
  but anyway , the primary point of the comment made by / u/tripwire3 above is that the standard should be the same for men and women . 
  he merely suggested that perhaps that standard could also be the lower one , rather than the higher one . 
  / u/theshadowkick replied to the comment saying `` no '' , when they still agreed to the point . 
  in that case , i am so glad you did n't put the episode out two days ago . 
  my dad was on a malaysian airliner ( air asia , not malaysia air , but still ... ) on friday the 13th :\\, 
  oh man , you put it out at 10:30 in an episode where you ( judging by the title and other comments ) talked about maccas brekkie ending at 10:30 ? 
  please tell me that was a deliberate decision . 
   it 's 2145 here in eastern aus, 
  only in those states which use wibbly-wobbly magic time . 
  20:45 in places that believe time should be based roughly on the location of the sun in the sky only . 
  [ it 's not grey , but this video is really amusing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesoy ) . 
  ninjaedit : just remembered , it 's actually on one of brady 's channels , so that 's kinda cool . 
   either way the standards should be universal . 
  this was the * primary * point made by the comment you replied to . 
  the rest of it was -- at least as far as i can tell -- merely a suggestion made in order to help increase representation of women in these jobs , without having standards differ between men and women . 
  unfortunately i 've never used the syncing features , i do all my podcast listening on my phone ( also android ) . 
  unfortunately , it looks like the web app requires a separate purchase from the phone app , which is a bit of a nuisance . 
  they do have a two week free trial , though , so i guess that 's good . 
  plus it 's a one-time purchase ( or , two one-time purchases , one for android and one for web ) for something that you probably use every day , so it 's actually rather cheap if you compare it to a daily coffee or whatever . 
  fwiw , a quick google and it looks like podcast addict has a chrome app , and it looks like the [ dev might be working on implementing syncing ] ( https://podcastaddict.uservoice.com/forums/211997-general/suggestions/4115735-cross-device-synchronization ) , though they said `` a few weeks '' back in october last year , so who knows if that 's actually happening or not . 
  i will say this . 
  if i wanted to use syncing to use it on my computer , i 'd probably pay the price for the web version even if there were n't a free trial first . 
  i trust the devs enough to believe it 's reliable and would do the job . 
  i 'd recommend pocketcasts . 
  it has all the features he described ( except the `` smart speed '' thing -- though personally that sounds like something i would n't want , anyway , i 'd rather them not mess with the audio itself , especially on hi , with the dramatic long pauses ) , with the addition of server-side checking for new podcasts , which makes the process much faster and allows it to use much lower data on your end , especially if you have a lot of feeds to check . 
  if you 've got a good one that you already use and like , i do n't see the point . 
  maybe look around and see if something else has a couple of features that might specifically convince you to switch , but all the major third party apps are vastly better than the official ones on any platform ( such as the apple one ) . 
  the difference between popular third-party ones is relatively minor , all things considered . 
  that 's what its author called it . 
  it was submitted here under the title `` unsuspecting modern-day humans enter a portal and find themselves stranded in a high-fantasy world '' . 
  i certainly did . 
  i could type at a maximum of about 105 in qwerty with a more common base rate of about 70 . 
  after switching , my maximum is about 125 with a more common base rate around 90 . 
  i 've also got the bonus of being able to type completely without looking , whereas previously i had to occasionally glance down . 
  and as others said , it definitely feels much nicer to type with . 
  to be honest , this is what 's important . 
  unless you 're doing transcription , your typing speed in the real world is going to be limited by your thoughts , not your fingers , if you can type at anything over about 40 . 
  i definitely agree . 
  what williams did in the prequels was brilliant . 
  gradually revealing vader 's theme as anakin slowly turned evil was just chilling . 
  not to mention that the young anakin 's theme both sounded brilliantly innocent , but also hinted at vader through its unstable harmonies . 
  not to mention the love theme `` across the stars '' made me love anakin and padme 's romance despite the acting and dialogue being ... lackluster , to put it mildly . 
  it very well might . 
  and such a hypothesis is very worthy , i feel , of further study . 
  but i 'd be careful about drawing conclusions from a small handful of people 's self-reported anecdotes . 
  that 's , the joke . 
  it would help if you were a little more specific about how they 're different . 
  i did n't see the screenshot :\\, 
  my bad . 
  \u00b5block . 
  it 's a mu ( greek letter , often used for `` micro '' in the metric/si system ) , not a u with an [ ogonek ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ogonek ) . 
  wait , do people actually pronounce the `` for '' in `` foreign '' the same as the `` for '' as in `` this is for you '' ( or the number 4 ) ? 
  i would pronounce it the same as in `` forest '' -- sort of like `` faww '' . 
  [ [ f\u0254\u02d0r\u0268n ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_english ) ] , or maybe [ f\u0275r\u0268n ] . 
  hmm . 
  now that you mention it , `` foh '' is probably a better way of writing out how i pronounce foreign and forest than `` faww '' is .
