  yes , you definitely do n't want to give them something where they have to install their own os , but removing the bloat would help them significantly . 
  in many cases , the bloat can significantly impact the performance of the computer , and these users do n't have the savvy required to fix it . 
  people who buy a mac that are n't in a high-performance niche do so for a number of reasons . 
  battery life , quality of tech support , ease of use , as well as a number of convenience features like backlit keyboards and really useful trackpads ( i 've seen backlit keyboards on a few windows laptops , but not many , and i 've never seen any trackpad that 's even close to as usable as the one apple makes ) . 
  there 's also the increased security ( which , while it 's often overstated , is still a factor that does exist to enough of an extent it 's worth considering ) and the fact that * any * mac is going to be fast enough that for casual use , you will * never * run into issues with slow down ( this last factor also applies to the vast majority of similarly-priced windows laptops ) . 
  if the price difference is not a significant issue for them , i can definitely see why even a casual user might decide a mac is a better option . 
  the difference between a mac and a high-end windows laptop is slight , but also not zero . 
  i 'm pretty sure i got a wax sealing kit of the same make as you !, 
  the letter options they had were the same design as yours , anyway . 
  i 'm guessing you 've never used a mac ? 
  the trackpad on them is actually usable , unlike the vast majority of other ones . 
  heck , for average web browsing and document editing stuff , it 's probably even * better * than a regular 3 button mouse . 
   you 're thinking only headphones, 
  well , considering we 're comparing it to beats at the moment , i thought that was a given . 
  it 's actually a macbook pro 15-inch without retina . 
  but the fact that another computer fits the description does n't surprise me in the least . 
  in fact , i 'm rather glad that there is one , because it 's a bunch of specs that i could easily see a person wanting . 
  it certainly would n't he the first time a musical composition was altered in order to fit the practicalities of the instruments available . 
  there 's a really good example that 's had a lot of debate in the first movement of beethoven 's symphony no. 5 . 
  the recapitulation uses a bassoon where the exposition used horn . 
  there are good arguments for both the idea that he did it as an artistic choice and for the idea that it was just restrictions of the instruments of the time . 
  1d4 inches ? 
  yeah i agree . 
  i only ever saw annie 's and jeff 's . 
  oh , right . 
  until the last line i had just assumed his teacher was on the jury . 
   the composition was finished and that it then turned out that some notes were unavailable, 
  yeah that 's very interesting . 
  do you know if the previous finished version is available anywhere ? 
  regarding the beethoven , yup . 
  [ the wikipedia article has a good summary of it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symphony_no._5_ ( beethoven \\ ) #reassigning _ bassoon_notes_to_the_horns ) . 
  basically , the opening of the second theme opens up with a bold statement of the horn in e flat ( the key the horns are in ) . 
  the recapitulation is in c , so the horns are n't able to do it . 
  he gave it to the bassoon instead , which could play more chromatically , but has a much weaker sound . 
  but he had horns in c on stage for the 4th movement , so if he wanted to , he could have had them switch to that . 
  but then they 're playing right before , and never would have had time to switch . 
  but then , what they 're playing is just chords in a tutti orchestra , so he may have been able to leave them out during that -- to give them time to switch -- if he had wanted , without losing too much . 
  artistically , he may have wanted the weaker sound of the bassoon to represent the heroic theme being weaker as the piece ultimately ends on a darker note . 
  [ you can see the relevant bits of the score here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vvomc ) . 
  the first picture is the recapitulation , and the second is the exposition . 
  i 've heard many aussies using it , too . 
  mostly older people . 
  i very rarely use qwerty these days , but when i do , i can type at a respectable speed . 
  something like 40 -- 60 . 
   ray palmer activates his suit , which immediately shrinks to the size of a nickel . 
  ray palmer does n't shrink with it . 
  hahaha , ouch . 
   oliver and laurel are actually reincarnated lovers from ancient egypt , who keep being reborn and falling in love every generation . 
  their original selves were hawk-winged aliens from thanagar . 
  huh . 
  i only just watched this episode of justice league unlimited earlier this week . 
  side note , i do n't think i 've seen you outside dnd subreddits before . 
  if you have a read of my comment , some people have suggested it . 
  i think i 've even heard recordings of the symphony that used the horn at that point , though i ca n't remember the conductor or orchestra . 
  there are a few reasons that beethoven may not have wished it . 
  the wikipedia article i linked ( as well as my comment itself , which mostly just expands on a couple of the points from that article ) explains some of the reasons why some people believe he may not have wanted the horn playing it there , even if it could . 
  to be fair , the bassoon already has some absolutely glorious parts in that movement . 
  the countermelody at the very start of the recapitulation -- before the oboe solo -- is just divine . 
  yeah my time going to a school with a lot of brits i definitely noticed they almost always call it paracetamol . 
  in aus it 's usually called panadol . 
  this is an em dash : --, 
  it 's one way of doing parenthetical statements ( along with brackets and parenthetical commas ) . 
  this is an en dash : --, 
  it 's used for ranges , like `` you can usually find that game for $ 20 -- $ 40 '' or `` the event will be some time from 22/02 -- 28/02 '' . 
  it also sometimes gets used as a hyphen for situations when multiple words are part of each side of the hyphenated case , such as `` san francisco -- area residents '' or `` public-school -- private-school rivalries '' . 
  this is a hyphen ( technically a `` hyphen-minus '' ) : -, 
  it 's used for hyphenating words that go together ( like `` hyphen-minus '' ) , as well as in maths for indicating subtraction ( `` 5 - 2 = 3 '' ) . 
  note that the '' - '' character on computers is actually somewhere between a `` true '' hyphen and a `` true '' minus character , but unless you 're doing some serious typography stuff , it 's never going to matter . 
  on windows , you can do an em-dash by typing alt +151 , an en-dash with alt +150 , and a hyphen-minus with the key between `` 0 '' and '' = '' on your keyboard ( assuming a standard us qwerty keyboard ) . 
  on os x , an em-dash is option + shift + - , an en-dash is option + - ( where '' - '' is a hyphen-minus ) , and a hyphen-minus is the same as on windows . 
  whenever you ca n't type the more advanced options ( some mobile keyboards , or windows without a numpad ) , an em-dash is best substituted by two hyphen-minuses '' -- '' , and an en-dash can just be replaced with a standard hyphen-minus '' - '' . 
  most non -- north american english dialects use the term `` bracket '' for those . 
  what you probably call `` brackets '' ( i.e. , these : [ ] ) , get called square brackets . 
  what do you do with a musician who 's no good at his job ? 
  give him two sticks , stick him up the back , and call him a percussionist . 
  what do you do if he 's still no good at that ? 
  remove one of the sticks and bring him up front . 
  people mixing up `` i.e. 
  '' , `` aka '' , and `` e.g. '', 
  is one of my biggest pet peeves on the internet . 
  what i love about this quote is that there are kinda two ways of looking at it . 
  one is that the wisdom is that because so many people call the monster `` frankenstein '' , then because of that , the wise thing to do is to just call the monster frankenstein . 
  the other is ( perhaps the more obvious interpretation ) that in creating the monster , and his treatment of it after it was created , victor frankenstein was a monster . 
  ( as a side note , [ i made the exact same comment as you a little while back ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2r63kg/what_grated_joke_always_cracks_you_up/cnd0j3t?context=5 ) -- it 's now my top comment -- and the discussion that it resulted in is pretty interesting , particularly [ this comment and its children ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2r63kg/what_grated_joke_always_cracks_you_up/cnd11u8?context=1 ) . ), 
  the aperture is already 1.8 . 
  chances are op could n't get higher . 
  and the shutter speed was 15 seconds . 
  probably could have gone longer if they 'd wanted to , but too much longer and you 'd start getting trails , which does n't seem to be the desired effect . 
  iso 1000 would need 30 seconds for the same brightess . 
  on high end dslrs ( especially nikons , since they 're famous for a focus on low-light photography relative to canon ) , high isos like this can be used fine with minimal noise . 
  you probably knew this , a3j . 
  i 'm just adding it here for a bit of extra information for anyone who might not . 
  but i agree , in the end , the photo looks fantastic , and that 's the most important thing . 
  i think the fact that those ones are so common and easy to make is why they do n't bother me * quite * as much . 
  after all , in the vast majority of accents , `` you 're '' and `` your '' are homophonic , as are they 're / there/their . 
  and its/it 's is a perfectly reasonable mistake to make . 
  after all , in every other situation the apostrophe can be used to represent possession . 
  so i 'm pretty forgiving about that one . 
  ( same thing applies to whose/who 's . ), 
  i 'm a white aussie and i wear that sort of sandals with shorts all the time ( and for 10 months out of the year , i generally prefer to wear shorts most days to uni ) .
