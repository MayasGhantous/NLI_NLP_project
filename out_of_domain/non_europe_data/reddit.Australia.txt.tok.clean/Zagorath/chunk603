  if the only reason they 're going on a side-quest is because `` we 're not high enough level '' , then you 're not dming the game well . 
  see , i think the point is , that 's how he ( and i , for that matter ) * define * the term grinding . 
  all the other stuff you describe is totally accurate and very good advice , but to us , that is no longer grinding . 
  it 's adventuring . 
  regarding telegraphing difficulty , you might want to read up on [ the worf effect ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/theworfeffect ) . 
  it 's basically another name for the same trope . 
  warning , * do n't * read up on it if you have something else you plan on doing in the next hour or so . 
  cr is something players should never know about ( unless they 're metagaming and reading the mm and dmg ) . 
  but it 's an extremely useful tool for the dm when building encounters of a roughly appropriate difficulty for the party , and it 's an even more useful tool for situations like this one where you want to communicate a general concept of difficulty without using specific creatures . 
  he and laurel did some stuff a few times , and then in the episode where oliver returned to starling during the big fight , wildcat was shown getting beaten up by some guy . 
  dunno if he died from that , or was hospitalised , or what . 
  aside from the fact that you should n't have put an apostrophe in australians , i agree . 
  while reddit themselves do n't like to capitalise their name , i say fuck that . 
  it 's a proper noun , and should be treated as such . 
  it 's not one of those cases where they have a particular reason not to adhere to standard capitalisation , such as mastercard or ebay . 
  i doubt he wrote it himself , but he probably read over it before signing it . 
  i like to believe he chuckled to himself at the duck-horse thing , since he was probably asked that when he did an ama on here . 
   grinding is for mmos . 
  it 's bad in tabletop rpgs , and it 's bad in mmos . 
  the less an mmo relies on grinding the better . 
  in australia the government gives out student loans that are only indexed to inflation . 
   much cheaper than ** it 's ** $ 1.99 / kg suggests . 
  emphasis mine . 
  come on courier mail . 
  you should be better than that . 
  how did you make your norwegian variant of dvorak on previous versions of windows ? 
  my guess would be that whatever tool you used will still work . 
  microsoft rarely likes to break things that previously worked , so chances are their keyboard layout files are still going to be the same format , so whatever software you used before will still work . 
  the trick to seeing the `` wrong '' colour is to actually look at the photo as it is . 
  the photo is * objectively * gold-ish/bronze-ish and blue-ish light grey . 
  ( i took it into photoshop and the results are # 7f6945 and # 8a94c3 . ), 
  it 's only when your eye starts interpreting what it sees that you get the weird white/gold blue/black debate . 
  personally , my eye just ca n't see it as blue/black . 
  i 've seen the photo of it from the other angle , and i 've seen the amazon listing . 
  both of those are clearly blue/black . 
  but this photo is clearly showing something far closer to white/gold . 
  this is what i really do n't get . 
  it 's very clearly a light grey-ish blue with a bronze-gold trim . 
  that 's the objective fact of the photo . 
  what i do n't get is how anyone 's eyes are interpreting the bronze-gold colour as * black * . 
  it makes no sense . 
  there 's just no logical process i can see that would cause someone to make that deduction . 
  not to mention i ca n't see how the eye could take the very light blue and see the dark blue that is apparently on the actual dress . 
  it 's removing the context . 
  the objective truth is that in this photo , what you 're looking at is a bronze-gold colour . 
  in actuallity , the dress the photo is * of * has black on it where the photo shows bronze-gold . 
  by looking at the background , you 're able to take some hints as to the lighting conditions in which the photo was taken , and your eyes are using that to interpolate what colour it must actually have been . 
  some people are interpreting it as though the dress is in shade with bright light behind it , while other people see it as the light coming from the front . 
  i think the former group sees it as white-gold , while the latter sees blue-black . 
  removing the context by zooming in like this allows you to see the photo as it is . 
  hey man , i gave a warning . 
  yeah it 's definitely blue . 
  it 's just that it 's a fairly light , very grey-ish blue . 
  if i had to pick between calling it white and calling it the dark blue that the actual dress is , i 'd pick white . 
  but i just do n't see any way to call the bronze-gold colour `` black '' . 
  it just does n't make sense . 
  you 're clearly both wrong . 
  they use a modified encoding where the 26 letters of the alphabet are represented the same as in ascii/utf -8 , but symbols are represented by their symbol ( see the exclamation mark ) , and not any binary representation . 
  edit : jesus people , learn to take a joke ... 
  hugely so , yes . 
  i played the game in beta , and for a little while when it first came out . 
  after a month or two i ended my subscription primarily because i did n't have the time to be doing * any * gaming . 
  the game got a lot of really undeserved criticism at launch , because people were expecting something that it was n't . 
  during the time that i did play it , i did some questing ( and i really enjoyed the plots of the quests i did , they 're on par with skyrim 's for sure ) , as well as some in parties that i joined on the fly because we happened to be doing the same quest ( which was a really cool experience ) . 
  the multiplayer in cyrodiil is really damn fun , with huge epic battles as well as fun risky solo/small party quests . 
  it also has a crafting system that is by far the best i think i 've ever seen in * any * game . 
  i prefer it to even that of skyrim . 
  i have n't been following it very closely since , but from what i have read , the game 's been vastly improved since the time i quit , with new features added in like a justice system , new areas , and new content/items . 
  [ i just found this thread ] ( / r/elderscrollsonline/comments / 2x4bvu/discussion _ psa_i_was_gonna_get_the_game_but_angry / ) , which provides a bunch more explanation . 
  ( i must be honest , i really agree with [ these ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/2x4bvu/discussion_psa_i_was_gonna_get_the_game_but_angry/cowtyhx ) [ two ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/2x4bvu/discussion_psa_i_was_gonna_get_the_game_but_angry/cowr2c9 ) little comment threads . 
  angryjoe is a personality , but he 's just an awful game reviewer , at least if his eso reviews are at all indicative of his general style . ), 
  if you want to have the same effect without giving gold to some douche bag , follow him and give gold to whoever he next gets into an argument with . 
  the video about ezio 's old age was also absolutely fantastic . 
  nonsense . 
  an encoding is a mapping between data in one format and data in another . 
  it does n't have to be binary at all . 
  one can encode text in ascii , but equally valid is a morse-code encoding . 
  video content can be encoded as an mp4 file , but can also be encoded in analogue television formats such as ntsc and pal . 
  the example i described would be a really dumb encoding ( which was the point of my comment ) , but it 's still an encoding . 
  edit : downvote all you like , it does n't change the fact that this comment is entirely factually correct . 
   its blue and black, 
  no it is n't . 
  the original dress might be , but the photo is not . 
  what we see in the photo is a grey-ish light-ish blue and a bronze-gold colour . 
  you can test it out by grabbing the image in photoshop ( or similar ) and using an eyedropper tool , preferably one that can do the average of an area . 
  the exact values i got when i did it were # 7f6945 and # 8a94c3 , but your exact results may vary . 
  either way , there 's no way the photo shows deep blue and black . 
  no , i am right in this context , because i was making a fucking joke about the words said by a fucking ghost that apparently talks by saying `` zero one one zero zero ... ! '' . 
  he 's wrong because he replied to a joke in a serious manner using a factually incorrect statement . 
  the colours in the photo are approximately # 7f6945 and # 8a94c3 . 
  that 's a bronze-gold colour and a greyish lightish blue . 
  it 's easy to see how one person might imagine the blue as an actual strong blue , and another might see it as a poorly lit/exposed white . 
  what i do n't understand is how * anyone * can imagine that the bronze part of the photo is black . 
  it just looks * nothing * like black . 
  that 's assuming that the thing you 're calling a `` black cow print '' is , in fact , a black cow print . 
  it certainly does n't look like that 's what it 's meant to be to me . 
   when really only one side experiencing an actual `` optical illusion , '', 
  but that 's not the case . 
  the people who are seeing it as the dress actually is * are n't * seeing the photo correctly . 
  the photo is very badly lit and exposed , and as such the colours you 're seeing in the photo are approximately # 7f6945 and # 8a94c3 .
