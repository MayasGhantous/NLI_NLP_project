  i thought i got it at first , then i read the comments here and started thinking it was version numbering or something . 
  and now this guy 's saying my initial thought was right . 
  i do n't know what to believe any more . 
  boxing day ? 
  i thought it was black friday when that happened ? 
  i think it 'd be more accurate to say that black friday is america 's boxing day , since it is n't just in canada that boxing day is big , but also the uk , australia , and ( i presume ) new zealand . 
   and there was talk of scraping that too . 
  wait there was ? 
  i have n't heard any of that . 
  please let it happen . 
  damn things are bloody useless anyway . 
  i could be wrong , but i thought shops were supposed to still accept 1c coins , but then never give them back as change . 
  slowly draining them out of circulation . 
  not us shops , of course , that 'd be weird , but she should have been able to use them in canada . 
  since you seem to be a kiwi , i figured i 'd just point out that just across the tasman is where i 'm from . 
  the southern states and territories all use wibbly-wobbly magic time , while the northern ones set our clocks based on how time actually is . 
  america also varies by state , although their situation is [ a little more complex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84awtseb2-4&amp;t=283 ) . 
  fair enough . 
  unless they 're djinni wishes and you 're going to twist them . 
  here , 16 degrees is about the time to start wearing trousers and closed shoes for warmth .

   `` min-maxing '' , `` metagaming '' , `` railroading '' , `` alignment '' , and other four-letter words, 
  am i missing something , or are none of these four-letter words ? 
  but anyway , i agree on all accounts . 
  regarding 1 in particular , i would point people to [ this thread ] ( / r/dndbehindthescreen/comments / 2xatx1/when _ the_pcs_are_outclassed_a_treatise / ) from a few days ago . 
  agreed . 
  it 's a bit of a douche move if you 're an age grouper in a marathon or iron man ( and even then , not really so much ) , but in a proper race you 're not finished until you 're finished . 
  sorry , nope . 
  both windows and os x ( and android , if you want to count that as linux , i guess -- but i use qwerty on there anyway ) , but my experiences delving into linux have always been far less than satisfactory . 
  personally i 'm not a fan of the official one for a few reasons . 
  the biggest one being that the numbers are in the wrong order . 
  i made my own custom layout based on it that i call the coder 's keyboard . 
  [ here 's the first layer of it , layed out correctly ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kbd99xg.png ) . 
  [ here 's both layers of it with emphasis on the second layer , but with the number row misaligned because of the bad design of the windows on-screen keyboard ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fxxvjqm.png ) . 
  you can make your own layout on os x using [ ukelele ] ( http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=ukelele ) and on windows using [ keyboard layout manager ] ( http://www.klm32.com/ ) . 
  does n't the most recent version of ios allow custom keyboards ? 
  surely there must be at least on that 's got an option for dvorak ? 
  personally i use my own layout based on the programmer dvorak . 
  primarily to fix the numbers , but i made a few other changes to make things more to my liking . 
  [ more detail in a comment a little further up the thread ] ( / r/dvorak/comments / 2xr6dc/how _ many_of_us_are_linux_users / cp2z37h ) . 
  there 's a very vocal minority that did n't like the end of season 5 . 
  personally , i suspect it 's largely just people who ca n't accept anything other than a fairytale ending . 
  i 'd love to give these people a copy of death and the maiden to read , just to see their reactions to the ending . 
  a different ending might have pleased some fans better , but it would have simultaneously been less significant for others . 
  i use two different variants of dvorak , both the standard dvorak simplified keyboard and my custom variant of the programmer dvorak . 
  i also use windows and os x about equally . 
  so i could n't complete this survey , since it forces me to pick between each of these pairs , but i ca n't . 
  it would have had a much less powerful impact . 
  i know i for one probably never would have gone to the lengths i have to read more about the show and share my opinions on it with others had it not had such a powerful ending . 
  i 've heard it elsewhere but it 's always actually referring to 4 letter words . 
  fuck , cunt , dick , shit , etc. 
  big races like iron men ( iron mans ? 
  ) , if you 're an age grouper , are far more about the personal performance , and even just the ability to finish the race , than they are about inter-person competition . 
  there 's a strong spirit of comeradery . 
  it 's not unusual for complete strangers to deliberately cross the line together . 
  it definitely would n't be rude to just keep running and happen to pass someone who 's celebrating , but to make a deliberate effort to get past them and beat them would be considered incredibly unsportsmanlike . 
  all of this goes out the window if you 're a professional , or if you 're near the top of your age group ( aiming for a podium finish or something ) . 
  other commenters have given some good explanations regarding not wanting to overcomplicate things etc. 
  i just thought i 'd add a little bit of a scientific stance in it . 
  even if you try and go with more real physics , the damage from a fall is mainly from the vertical velocity . 
  if it were flying horizontally before , and then started falling , its vertical speed upon impact will still be entirely dependant on its height above the ground . 
  the horizontal speed might at best mean that they get scraped a little , but i would n't bother factoring that in to damage . 
  the only time it might be worthwhile doing something more complicated would be if he was in a nosedive before he fell unconscious , but even then , i 'd probably count falling damage just from the height the dive started at . 
  i just want to say i love the word acerbic . 
  nonsense . 
  if anything , 4e is the one version of the game where that * is n't * true . 
  it 's a game designed to make it much harder to accidentally randomly kill the pcs . 
  that said , i 'm not a fan of needless , capricious death . 
  normally i 'd say context makes it clear what 's meant , and just saying `` players '' is generally fine . 
  but in this case , the first half of the title did n't have the context necessary to make it clear , so yeah ... 
  that said , i try to stick to `` pc '' . 
  i would recommend reading the two `` guides for newbies '' in the sidebar . 
  most importantly , i would suggest you do not get stickers for your keyboard or rearrange the keys . 
  it 'll help you in the short run , but long run will hinder the development of your typing ability . 
  [ guide one ] ( http://www.theworldofstuff.com/dvorak/ ) , and [ guide two ] ( https://zagorath.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/dvorak/ ) . 
  fun fact , dr seuss is probably not pronounced how you ( or most people ) think it 's pronounced . 
  it rhymes with `` voice '' . 
  fun fact , but the clarinet 's ancestor , [ the chalumeau ] ( http://clarinetmusichistory.weebly.com/uploads/1/4/0/2/14027693/7703482_orig.jpeg ) , was played with the mouthpiece around the other way . 
  i believe some early clarinets may have been played like this , too , but i 'm not sure about that one . 
  it also states :, 
   geisel 's most famous pen name is regularly pronounced / \u02c8s ( j ) u\u02d0s / , an anglicized pronunciation inconsistent with his german surname ( the standard german pronunciation is [ \u02c8z\u0254\u028f\u032fs ] ) . 
  he himself noted that it rhymed with `` voice '' ( his own pronunciation being / \u02c8s\u0254\u026as / ) . 
  alexander liang , one of his collaborators on the dartmouth jack-o-lantern , wrote of it :, 
   you 're wrong as the deuce, 
  and you should n't rejoice, 
  if you 're calling him seuss . 
  he pronounces it soice ( or zoice ), 
  3 days `` more results '', 
  i do n't believe descriptivism and prescriptivism are necessarily mutually exclusive , like the sort of militant `` linguists '' from places like / r/badlinguistics would have you believe . 
  descriptivism is describing how people use language , but is n't actually stating that it 's just as good as other ways of speaking . 
  but more importantly , i believe that with proper nouns -- especially people 's names -- prescriptivism should be * absolute * . 
  the person whose name it is has the absolute right to say how it should be pronounced . 
  now , in seuss 's case , he actually decided later in life to just accept people saying it so it rhymes with zeus , so it actually does n't matter too much . 
  but in general , with people 's names , you absolutely can not make the `` however a significant group of people pronounce it is right '' argument . 
  oh right , sorry . 
  i misinterpreted the comment . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  definitely do this . 
  even if you do n't care about this one use-case that much , in most cases there 'll be some other dns server that will be faster than the isp 's one anyway . 
  my personal recommendation is 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 , because it 's easy to remember , pretty reliable , and relatively fast ( at least faster than the isp when i 've tried it before .
