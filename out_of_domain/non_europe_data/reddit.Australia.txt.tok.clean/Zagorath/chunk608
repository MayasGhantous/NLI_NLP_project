  yeah i was thinking of adding two more to that encounter . 
  probably a goblin and a wolf or something . 
  so would it be fair to say that the dmg calculations for encounter difficulty are probably not very accurate in general ( particularly the multiplier table for larger numbers of monsters or adjustments for smaller parties ) ? 
  i * think * most australians would know what you meant if you said ` minge ' , but i 've never heard an aussie use it . 
  they might not even know it -- i 've had a lot of exposure to brits since i went to a school where most of the teachers were british . 
  yeah that certainly sounds like a pretty smart way to go about things in general . 
  oh that 's interesting . 
  i was n't aware it had changed . 
  do you know how exactly the encounter calculation rules were changed after lmop was published ? 
  yeah , fair point . 
  but ... that 's literally what it is , is n't it ? 
  it 's a sausage in a bit of bread ... 
  ah fair enough . 
  i listen to podcasts at around 2.6 x speed , but they 're all purely informational . 
  i do n't think i could ever do that to a tv show , let alone one so carefully paced as house of cards . 
  she already had misgivings about her stepchildren being brought up and used in the debate . 
  to throw her husband into the fray -- and to do it * herself * , putting the blame on him -- would have been so much worse for her . 
  normally i love character driven shows , but for me at least this season did n't quite do it . 
  i think a big part of it is that there was a heavy focus on doug and on claire , two characters that i have n't really ever cared for all that much . 
  but hey , it 's still heads and shoulders above most other shows out there . 
  it 's funny , i also thought she might bring him down in this season , but for the opposite reason . 
  i expected that she would see frank in a pitiful position politically , and would order the assassination as a mercy to him . 
  ( basically how the uk version ended . ), 
  at least , that was one of my three theories for how the show would end . 
  still is in a way , i guess . 
  12/10 would not be alone with him with ricin . 
  i think it 's been pretty clear since the start that the show has to end in tragedy . 
  more because of its shakespearean influences than directly greek ones ( though certainly it comes to shakespeare through greek theatre ) . 
  in fact , i think it would be an incredibly bold move on the creators ' part if they * did n't * have it end in tragedy . 
  it would be -- if they executed it well -- a massive twist on expectations . 
  ooooh , there 's another fun word difference . 
  our barbies are very different to yours . 
  what you calling `` grilling '' is our barbecuing . 
  not necessarily . 
  that 's certainly one way it could end , but i see at least two other ways it could go that would be really effective . 
  one is suicide -- frank has mentioned it quite a few times , at least two of them in conversations relating to strength . 
  it would be showing that frank has the strength to know when he 's beaten , and end it . 
  worth noting that suicide is how the original book ended ( though it followed only roughly the first season of either version of the tv show -- the suicide was instead of killing mattie/zoey ) . 
  the other would be to hint at one of the other two endings , before completely subverting our expectations . 
  have him end completely on top , perhaps with a brief line to the audience to the effect of `` you did n't really think i was going to * lose * , did you ? '' . 
  imo , any one of these endings could be fantastic if they execute it as well as seasons 1 and 2 were done . 
  edit : [ here 's a link to a previous comment i made ] ( / r/houseofcards/comments / 2uuqf6/anyone _ else_hope_to_see_frank_imortalized_at_the / cobvnfm ) saying more or less the same thing , but with links to fleshed out ideas on the third point [ here ] ( / r/houseofcards/comments / 2025s4/does _ anyone_else_just_want_to_see_frank_win / ) and [ here ] ( / r/houseofcards/comments / 2q7gww/is _ it_safe_to_watch_the_first_two_seasons_of_the / cn8vf4j ) . 
  oh yeah , i totally know how the difference is used . 
  i 've seen some pretty damn heated debates on the topic on reddit before . 
  it 's quite amusing to watch , really . 
  it 's just that personally i would call them both by the same name -- though in fairness , what you call a barbecue is n't something that we do very much here at all , so there is n't much need for a name for it . 
  as much as many people deny it , season 2 of the us version was very much inspired by season 2 of the uk version . 
  they did much the same thing . 
  the king is a hugely important character in the uk version , and then in the third season he ( and even his successor ) is barely mentioned again . 
  beyond that , the actual narrative reasons they ignored them are , as / u/kallisti _ gold says , that they 're no longer relevant to the story . 
  azureus used to be a great bittorrent client . 
  early vuze was , too . 
  but then they started adding all these dumb features to do with finding torrents in the app ( not in itself too bad , necessarily ) , and also playing media and doing stuff with libraries and other devices . 
  all these extra bloat features that people do n't want . 
  what people who use bittorrent a lot want is just bittorrent . 
  they want to be able to download a . torrent file or click a magnet link and have it open in their client of choice . 
  basic features around speed limits and prioritisation are awesome . 
  labels are pretty nice as well . 
  but in general , that 's about it . 
  any more than that and it starts getting bloaty . 
  i 'm loving qbittorrent . 
  i 'm using its web interface so i can use my parents ' computer overseas ( with lax piracy laws ) as a seedbox , and for my parents i 've got it set up so that its labels put things in the right folders for the plex server i set up for them . 
  really is an awesome little client without unneccessary bloat , but enough power features as well . 
  i have qbittorrent running on my parents ' computer overseas ( where they have lax piracy laws ) as a seedbox . 
  it 's an awesome little feature . 
  i just wish you could apply damn labels from the web interface . 
  i love my scuba diving ( where the `` cub '' in scuba is the same as `` bear cub '' ) . 
  and is n't naersa an absolutely fantastic organisation ? 
  oh wait , neither of those are things , because that 's not how acronyms fucking work . 
  that 's definitely not what it was for me . 
  i was definitely thinking that the season felt fairly lackluster compared to the previous two seasons even as early as episode 5 or 6 . 
  i regularly found myself wiggling the mouse to see how long the episode had left . 
  haha yeah i was thinking the same thing . 
  well it would n't be the first time he decided the project needed to take a completely new approach . 
  oh cool , thanks for this . 
  that site seems like it could be really useful . 
  but oh god , it is unbelievably awful on mobile . 
  say , i remember a few days ago seeing a link to another encounter builder where you put in the area you want , your pc levels , and the difficulty you wanted , and it 'd spit out an encounter by itself completely randomly , without the customisation options . 
  do n't supposed you 'd know the one i 'm talking about and have a link , would you ? 
  this is a very good comment . 
  as far as i 'm concerned there 's exactly one * real * problem with 4e , and that 's that combat tends to take far too long . 
  everything else is just people whinging that it 's different from what they already know . 
  any news ? 
  yeah i was amazed that there were that many people who answered that . 
  it just seems so wrong . 
  how do you * breathe * ? 
  wow i 'm amazed that many people go to the effort to carefully fold something that goes in their bum and gets shit all over it . 
  awesome , thanks so much . 
  very interesting . 
  you should try what i do , which is have the floss by the computer , and then when i 'm watching a video ( whether it be youtube or some movie/tv show ) , i take that time to floss . 
  that way you can improve your dental hygiene without setting any time out for it . 
  oh no , i think you misunderstand . 
  i do n't * want * a deadly encounter . 
  i was just worried that the encounter as written was deadly , and thus if i were to scale it up in proportion to the party size change , it would still be deadly . 
  which seems wrong given the circumstances of the encounter . 
  it just does n't feel right that it would be any more than medium difficulty , or maybe just on the threshold of hard at the most . 
  you sure about that ? 
  if it 's try a lower quality product at at a higher cost , why on earth would they bother doing it at all ? 
  or `` just out for a drive '' or `` the city '' , or just about any other random not overly specific response . 
  [ and those people would be wrong .
