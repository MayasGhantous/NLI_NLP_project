  it was the lost mines of phandelver , in the first goblin cave , the one lead by klarg . 
  the players went up the chimney to klarg 's room , and when half the party was up , the surge happened . 
  all creatures nearby turned invisible . 
  one of the goblins decided to attack our tiefling monk , aiming at where he was before he turned invisible . 
  rolled with disadvantage , but still hit . 
  knocked him down unconscious -- but still invisible . 
  the rest of the party continued the fight with klarg and the goblins , but meanwhile , the monk passed his first saving check , but proceeded to fail the next two . 
  at this point one of the players tried to find him to help stabalise him , but because the monk was invisible , he failed to stabalise . 
  the next saving throw was a success . 
  that 's two successes and two fails : the next throw is to decide his fait . 
  and that 's how wild magic surges directly resulted in a player 's death in our second session of 5e . 
  probably did n't help that our cleric missed the session , though even if he had been there , the invisibility may have meant he would 've been ineffective . 
  my understanding is that / r/thatonesession is specifically for tabletop rpg stories ( / r/gametales is cluttered with other types of games which , while great , can be annoying if what you 're looking for is tabletop rpgs ) , and is for * real * stories about what actually happened in * your * session ( / r/dndgreentext is mainly for highly elaborate or dramatised stories that may or may not have actually happened -- and gametales has a fair few like that as well ) . 
  mod of / r/dndgreentext here . 
  i 'm mainly in favour of this sub existing because it means we can keep out some of the slightly less interesting but more personal stories . 
  the original intent of that sub was for sharing the really awesome stories like sir bearington , the demigods tale , and stranded ( note that two of these three are n't even `` greentext '' stories per se ) . 
  / r/thatonesession existing means dndgreentext can get back to its roots a little , and people just posting their own session that they just had and want to share with others can go to a subreddit more tailored to their needs . 
  that 's why he said `` then '' . 
  sounds like grey had the same sort of experience most people have with ddg . 
  a good way to advertise something like backblaze -- if you 're allowed to go off script , i do n't know -- is using a concept called 321 backup . 
  the idea is your data does n't exist unless you have three copies of it on at least two different media , one of which is `` off site '' . 
  three copies could be the original , your timemachine backup , and backblaze . 
  the original and timemachine are both the same media ( unless you have an internal ssd and external hdd ) , and backblaze is both the off site backup and the alternate medium ( that medium being `` cloud '' ) . 
   i 've beat at an opponent 's blade repeatedly just because i can tell it rattles them, 
  yeah i 've definitely done this too in sport fencing . 
  it can be quite effective . 
  similarly , repetitive fake lunges ( e.g. 
  by stamping hard on the ground ) can throw them off their game . 
   it is always commented that a lightsaber is very hard to use for an untrained person, 
  is n't this also kind of implied in episode iv , when luke first gets his lightsaber ? 
   and `` officially '' is not anymore, 
  i could be wrong , i 've never cared much for the star wars expanded universe , but i was under the impression that everything in it is still considered more or less canon , * except where explicitly overruled by the new movies * . 
  that is , the new movies will be canon , and any point where the expanded universe conflicts with the movies , the movies are the ones that are considered true . 
  however , where the two exist without being necessarily exclusive , the expanded universe is still canon . 
  people do n't eat breakfast ? 
  nah they are doing god 's work . 
  the church they blew up was to the wrong god . 
  how exactly do third rails work ? 
  would n't it require all crossings be made into over/underpasses ? 
  that could be expensive , especially out in the country . 
  i 've got to be honest , i do n't even particularly feel the desire to like it . 
  people go all crazy about how google 's `` tracking '' us and whatever . 
  but the thing is ( a ) no human is actually seeing my individual search history and ( b ) the data they get from that `` tracking '' is exactly * why * google 's results are so much better . 
  to be technical , he used a backtick rather than an apostrophe . 
  it 's `` hi '' in binary ( ascii encoding ) . 
  the high noises are `` 1 '' and the low are `` 0 '' . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean about predicting . 
  i do n't think most people want to be able to predict what they 'll get , they just want to get the best results . 
  and what the best results are is different depending on who you are and where you are . 
  if i search for `` abc '' i 'd much rather get results about the australian broadcasting corporation than the american channel of the same initials . 
  google uses my location as well as my past history of visiting the abc to rank the right abc for me much higher than it probably does for you ( unless you happen to also be australian ) . 
  the inherent problem with duckduckgo is that they specifically * do n't * want to do the thing that makes google results so great . 
  their shtick is privacy , and i get that some people like that . 
  i do n't really understand why they do , but they have every right to go after that if they want . 
  it 's just that they do pay the price in terms of lower quality search results . 
  hey while we 're on the topic , anyone know where i can get a zoom h1 ( preferably with the accessory pack ) ? 
  [ digidirect used to sell it for like $ 120 ] ( http://www.digidirect.com.au/accessories/wireless_transmitters_microphones_and_gps_units/zoom/zoom_h1_portable_audio_recorder_with_aph-1_accessory_pack ) , but i balked because of the shipping cost , and now it 's way up to $ 160 + ... 
  that 's what i love about buying on ebay . 
  three layers of protection , every one of which will usually find in your favour ( as a buyer ) . 
  if ebay knocks you back , chances are paypal wo n't . 
  and if they do , well there 's still your bank to back you up . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd call the former `` regular '' , especially seeing as most people 's writting probably does n't use it . 
  i 'd go with `` typographic '' instead . 
  for those on os x , you can write a typographic apostrophe by going ` \u2325 option + \u21e7 shift + ] ` . 
  on windows , the altcode alt-0146 will do it . 
  on linux , if you 're using the x window system , i believe ` altgr + \u21e7 shift + b ` works , though i ca n't try it myself right now . 
  based on the user 's comment history , i 'm going to * guess * that they 're not a guerilla marketer , and just a popcorn enthusiast . 
  could be a cleverly planted marketer , but honestly that seems much less likely to me . 
   vote third party, 
  sounds good . 
   preference labor and liberal last, 
  not so good . 
  i 'd definitely rather labor than family first , liberal democrats , and the right-wing single-issue parties ( like `` stop the greens '' ) . 
  eh , labor still voted down the university fee deregulation . 
  i definitely am not a fan of them on the whole , but all this talk about them being `` just as bad as the liberals '' is exaggeration . 
  they 're not good , but they definitely * are * still a * better * alternative in a number of ways . 
  is n't the sex party kinda libertarian ? 
  like , not full on nuts like the liberal democrats , but leaning that way ? 
  i like some of their social policies , but i have n't seen that much detail in economic policy . 
  what i have seen makes it seem as though they 're slightly right wing in that regard . 
  haha yeah definitely not clear why he decided to ask here rather than googling . 
   leyonjhelm is against the bill, 
  is he ? 
  how come ? 
  i thought this would be exactly the sort of thing he would support . 
  i know it 's really popular around here to complain about labor . 
  god knows they deserve it a lot of the time , including in this particular example . 
  but acting as though they 're just as bad as the liberals is just stupid . 
  not only that , it 's pretty damn counterproductive -- i can easily imagine someone on the fence who has previously always voted liberal thinking `` oh , well if there 's no difference , i 'll just keep voting how i always have '' . 
  do n't forget , labor is the one that was trying to bring us the nbn . 
  they got through real policy to combat climate change . 
  they just recently helped stop the liberals getting through their university fee deregulation . 
  yes , in many ways -- especially those ways that are in some way tied to `` national defence '' labor is pretty much just as bad as the liberals . 
  but in so many other policy areas they are a clear better option . 
  by all means , preference minor parties like the greens and the pirate party before them -- i know i will . 
  but do n't try to act as though labor and liberal are the same , because it 's just not true . 
  i do n't know what it 's like down there , but here in brissie i 've used our citycycle a couple of times . 
  i found it easy to find a bike that already had a helmet with it . 
  they do n't all have them , but enough do that at most `` stations '' ( for lack of a better word ) there 'll be at least one helmet available . 
  what you guys down south * really * need , ** especially ** for city bikes , is to be able to ride on the damn footpath .
