  perhaps the biggest and most well-known of the cheap phone providers is [ amaysim ] ( http://www.amaysim.com.au/ ) . 
  i 've heard mostly good things about them , but have no personal experience . 
  all of these run on the optus network , so you get very good coverage , though not quite as good as telstra 's . 
  amaysim is 3g only , the other two are 4g . 
  for the telstra network , which has more coverage in areas out of the city , the best options are [ aldi mobile ] ( https://aldimobile.com.au/ ) , [ lyca mobile ] ( http://www.lycamobile.com.au/en/ ) , and [ boost mobile ] ( http://www.boost.com.au/ ) . 
  all are 3g only . 
  ( if you do go with yatango , hit me up with a pm first , i can use a referal code that saves us both money . ), 
  off the topic of the phone , if you 're going to be in brisbane ( or south-east queensland in general ) for much time , you should grab a gocard as soon as you arrive . 
  it makes public transport much cheaper to use than otherwise , and also much quicker . 
  yeah , that 's like , half the definition of vegan . 
  it 's basically ` vegetarian - ( eggs + milk + a few other things that do n't really matter ) ` . 
  oh man , that 's so much cooler than the brush-turkeys that inhabit my uni . 
  you could try copying the link to the image and pasting it into imgur 's `` enter image urls '' upload option . 
  assuming they do it all server side ( rather than downloading images locally based on the url and then uploading that through the normal means ) that should work for you . 
  i 'd do it for you , but i 'm kinda curious to see if it 'll work ... 
  ninjaedit : just realised the given link was n't a direct image link . 
  [ try this link ] ( http://40.media.tumblr.com/11edb8750b8c9c3e04ea20eb45928bf0/tumblr_mxstapxgqo1r54gw9o1_1280.jpg ) , perhaps the direct image wo n't be blocked where you are ? 
  and if it still is , perhaps the imgur idea will work using that url . 
  second ninja edit : eh , [ i went ahead and did it for you , here 's the imgur mirror of the image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ytpnv5q.jpg ) . 
  if you 've got the time , though , would you mind trying the above , i 'm still curious . 
  i loved the story of the early ac games , but i actually have n't bothered playing anything more recent than revelations , just because i hate the direction they 're taking the game in . 
  ac has essentially become the parkour equivalent of call of duty , with yearly big releases of generic games with bland mechanics and dull stories . 
  these three comments below really sum up how i feel about the game :,

  woah , frisbee is trademarked ? 
  casters all have a list from which they choose their spells . 
  for example , in the sorcerer 's spell list there are spells like burning hands and magic missile but sorcerer 's ca n't use unseen servant or tasha 's hideous laughter , which are spells in the wizard 's spell list . 
  the cool thing about the eldritch knight and the arcane trickster is that they use the wizard 's spell list , which is by far the most extensive , so they have an enormous range of spells that they can choose from . 
  and similarly , yes , some magic items can only be used if they 're associated with your class . 
  for example , spell scrolls can only be used by people who have a class in one of the classes for which that spell is in the spell list . 
  since the uk and at use the wizard 's spell list , any scroll with a wizard spell on it can be used by them . 
  wow , thanks a heap for this list of permanent spells !, 
  nah i 'm not american and i agree with his sentiment . 
  in australia at least , most people would consider eggs and dairy fair game in a veggo diet . 
  wow that 's awesome . 
  fixed , 
  i saw a tip on reddit that got me to start flossing a while back . 
  you might want to consider passing it on to patients . 
  leave your floss on your desk by your computer , and whenever you 're watching a movie/show/video or doing something else at the computer that does n't require hands , take that chance to floss your teeth . 
  that plotline , as cringe-worthy as it was , was essential to lay the groundwork for the end of the season . 
  so the memory loss in the finale was n't a diabolus ex machina . 
   i have run ubuntu with probably half a dozen versions over the years ( mint as well ) , but i 've always run into some stupid hardware or software problem that made me uninstall, 
  yeah same . 
  i recently tried to set up a seedbox at my parents ' place ( overseas ) using a couple of different flavours of linux ( ubuntu and mint ) . 
  i wanted linux so that i could easily ssh/scp stuff from it on my mac . 
  unfortunately , no matter what i did , the damn thing was getting awful download speeds . 
  installed windows and bam , awesome speeds right out of the box . 
  so now i 'm stuck having to download some extra utilities on both my end and the server end in order to get it working , but at least it can now download fast . 
  i do n't know where you 're getting these numbers from . 
  5 gb for a 100 minute 1080p show sounds perfectly reasonable in my experience ( from tormenting movies ) . 
  it 's not going to be bluray quality , but should still be very good , sharp , 1080p . 
  wait they do n't have lotr/the hobbit in the us ? 
  is that available in the uk or canada ? 
  or is it an aus exclusive ? 
  nah , not really . 
  yes , dvorak improves your typing speed substantially , but it has other advantages that are -- in my opinion , at least -- my important . 
  specifically , the fact that it lowers the risk of rsis . 
  you can sign up to the version anywhere in the world and it 'll let you watch the content wherever you are * currently * . 
  that means if you 've signed up for the us version , all you need to do is turn off your vpn and you can access the australian content . 
  however , i 'd recommend cancelling your us subscription and getting an aussie one . 
  you can still use a vpn into the us to access the larger library their version has , but by paying for it in australia you would be incentivising them to bring more content to the version here . 
  mozart was one of the composers that slowly started giving celli and contrabassi separate parts in some sections ( his jupiter symphony , for example , while both are written on the same staff , has a number of sections where the two split in different voices ) . 
  beethoven continued this trend , and eventually became one of the earliest composers to regularly split the two entirely into their own staves and parts . 
  i do n't think anyone is arguing against that ... 
  i 'd rather have it pointing at the nice versions of them . 
  leave the printer friendly links as an extra ( maybe add them in brackets after the main link ) . 
  no he was n't . 
  frankly i do n't even see how you would read that into it . 
  you need to be holding your spellcasting focus in order to use it . 
  that 's not , in most cases , going to be a `` free hand '' , since it 's now a hand holding a spellcasting focus . 
  you do n't need * another * hand to be free . 
  but thanks for the downvote based on your bad reading comprehension . 
  says a lot . 
  could someone please explain what everyone 's talking about here ? 
  so basically , 75 % + 1 of votes need to pass it , with a quorum of 20 % of all possible votes ? 
  as a commuting cyclist , that law is the dumbest fucking law . 
  i am so glad my state does n't have it , though most of the other states in the country seem to ... 
  edit : glad to see the downvotes with only one person who has bothered to even attempt ( albeit weakly ) to refute my claim . 
  simply fact is , it is a stupid law . 
  bikes on the footpath are perfectly safe . 
  all of these are , in general , very good advice . 
  i would modify rule 2 a little to be `` do n't bike on the pavement faster than a brisk walk pace if there are any pedestrians nearby , and even if there are n't still keep your speed low enough to be able to easily react to anyone suddenly appearing '' . 
  but yeah , wearing headphones while running on anything other than a dedicated running track ( be it indoors or outdoors ) is dumb . 
  i 'm sorry for those that enjoy music while they run , but you 're putting your own safety and that of others at risk , and that is stupid . 
  take the headphones off while on the road or shared paths . 
  and a cyclist should * always * yield to pedestrians . 
  dumb mistake on my part . 
  i 've never heard of any serious injuries occurring when a cyclist was on the footpath . 
  a while back , a close family friend got in a serious accident riding his bike on the road -- got hit by a car . 
  had he not been wearing a helmet he would have likely died from the crash . 
  a few weeks ago a cyclist on the road in another state * was * killed thanks to a careless car passenger opening their door and knocking the cyclist into traffic . 
  that simply * can not * happen when a cyclist is on the footpath . 
  a collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian is both much easier to avoid ( the cyclist can react more quickly by stopping and swerving than a car could ) and ** far ** less dangerous when it does occur ( bikes are significantly slower and lower in mass than cars , so less injury is done ) . 
  additionally , when i 'm on the footpath , my safety is almost entirely in my own hands . 
  when i 'm on the road , i 'm trusting the hundreds of other road users not to be stupid . 
  quite frankly , that 's not trust i 'm willing to hand over on any but the most quiet of streets . 
  i 'm sure they do , though it 's not commonplace . 
  but the photo is clearly not one .
