  twenty20s are great to watch in the evenings to compete with the nrl and afl , while test matches are the best at pitting great international teams against each other . 
  odis are just this awkward middle child . 
  edit : fixed fuxked up autocorrect regarding 20-20 . 
  i knew it was happening , but nobody said the vote would be today . 
  i assumed it would n't be until at least mid april . 
  and i have seen almost nothing about it in this subreddit recently . 
  a few posts here and there , but nothing to suggest it was this close to actually getting through , and absolutely zero in the way of trying to organise a campaign . 
  sigh ... 
  the fact that labor supported it and got it through the senate , despite all but one of the cross-benchers being against it , really infuriates me . 
  if our opposition party could actually fucking oppose the government * when it matters most * , it would be a bloody miracle . 
  i 'm guessing the person you replied to probably meant pm . 
  in which case i doubt they are right , but oh god it would be awesome to see . 
  yeah definitely . 
  both are equally or near equally shitty at privacy and immigration , but outside of that the difference is enormous . 
  taxation , welfare , education , healthcare , 21st century infrastructure , and the environment , just to name a few areas where labor is forward thinking and pushing for the best for australians , while the coalition is stuck in the 20th century and has no interest in what 's best for the average australian . 
  oh , i assumed that they just decided to have a brief conversation about some really minor sport on the show for a while . 
  just wan na point out , scott ludlum is n't an mp , he 's a senator . 
  and basically the entire crossbench ( all greens senators , both the former pup senators , the libertarian guy , etc. 
  ; the only one that did n't was the single senator still in pup ) voted against it . 
  just one of the many reasons that samsung is a shit company and you should avoid their consumer-facing products at all costs . 
  [ no , they really are a shitty company ] ( http://youtu.be/sabl2wy1uzo ) . 
  i do n't read any comic books at all but i 'm still loving the portrayals of characters in this show . 
  could theoretically be a coalition of a large number of small parties . 
  much of mainland europe forms governments in this way regularly . 
  you should use the remindme bot . 
  5 minutes `` read later '', 
  they were together briefly , and then split off . 
  the , timeline we saw last episode was one barry , and this episode ( and beyond , presumably ) is the other . 
  i thought that at first , too . 
  but two years ago i saw that in australia each of the major cities has its own twenty20 team that have weekly matches heading towards a final at the end of the season . 
  it 's something fans can sit down of an evening and watch to support their home team . 
  the perfect equivalent to how the nrl and afl are things people watch in the evening . 
  international matches , who fucking cares , i never want to see one , let alone a world cup . 
  but national trophies between cities are absolutely perfect . 
  odis just take too long for this , but they 're also far too short for the bug stamina and mental game that comes with test matches ( and tests are still ** by far ** the best form of the game ) . 
  odis just do n't make much sense outside of a world cup type format . 
  ditto for alex. 
  ninjaedit : and aluminium . 
  i know how to feel about it . 
  fuck op , that was a really fucking shitty thing to do . 
  that 's how i feel about it . 
  you should have made sure it was a future spoiler . 
  i 'm up to date on the show , so i assumed i 'd be fine clicking on it . 
  you made * no * attempt to mark the fact that it was spoiling future content . 
  i definitely agree . 
  but i have to say , this episode had me enjoying the show much more than i have all season . 
  i was laughing heaps and just really enjoying it . 
  but i 'm still not nearly as invested in the overarching plot as i was in season 2 , or in this season of the flash . 
  give them a break , the season 's still airing for ~ ~ god ~ ~ grodd 's sake !, 
  at least they do have the first two seasons of arrow . 
  i think it works with his character in this . 
  he 's meant to be running on a constant lack of sleep . 
  1 ) it 's just an expression people use all the time . 
  2 ) if one really did want to use it literally , the amount of droughts , floods , and forest fires , as well as the ( fairly deserved ) stereotype of having a lot of dangerous fauna , could well justify calling the place godforsaken . 
   you could always just flip/mirror the right-handed animations , but then you 'd have brass ejecting on the wrong side of the gun, 
  not . 
  if you assume that they 're using guns made for lefties , which seems a pretty reasonable assumption to me . 
  which edition ? 
  i 'm dming 5th ( after having played 4th for a little over a year ) , and i 'm finding the dmg combined with the campaign included in the starter set , the lost mines of phandelver , are absolutely brilliant resources for getting in to dming . 
  for any edition , i would highly recommend reading as many articles from the angry dm as you can . 
  in particular the `` five simple rules for dating my teenage skill system '' and the others in that series , and one whose name i ca n't find right now , but it 's about building npcs , and has something including the four ps : personality , posture , pause , and pfidget . 
  i think it might be `` help , my players are talking to things ! '', 
  or something like that . 
  while i will say that a picture that needs no explanation is inherently going to be more powerful , like tank man , or the photo if the buddhist monk in vietnam burning himself , that does n't mean a photo that requires explanation is necessarily without value , or even with low value . 
  even the above images gain a lot when you know about the stories behind them , and in some cases it 's just near impossible for an image to stand entirely on its own . 
  the image in the op is a great example . 
  by itself , it 's an adorable photo of a little girl stretching , or playing , or whatever . 
  the explanation completely flips that on its head , and provides a very different interpretation of the photo , and one which is very impactful . 
  i used to live in korea . 
  damn piece was everywhere . 
  trucks played it whole backing up , doors would play it to tell you they 'd been left open , every single music student ever would learn it ( including myself , i must admit ) . 
  i still like it because it 's a really pretty piece of music , but it 's pretty low class to be honest . 
  i think of it as a sort of taylor swift piece of the 19th century ( or 18th , beethoven bridged the two centuries i do n't know exactly when he wrote this ) . 
  nice , easy for anyone to like , and about lovers , but with fairly little actual musical merit . 
   if you are listening closely, 
  please tell me you 're being ironic here . 
  there 's no need to listen closely , tchaikovsky fucking blasts out la marseilles over and over in the 1812 overture . 
  it 's to parody the arrogance of napoleon 's army . 
  it 's an awesome piece of music , but there 's nothing subtle about it anywhere ( which is n't a criticism in the least -- that was the * point * of it , and that 's what makes it great ) . 
  on mine it would be `` eject '' . 
  m i missing something ? 
  quick edit : just looked at my desktop keyboard . 
  on that , it 's print screen . 
  i feel like i 'm still missing something . 
  sounds like time to back up immediately . 
  or , failing that , grab a copy of spinrite . 
  depending on what you mean by red pepper ( specifically , if you 're referring to capsicum ) , i might say slice it rather than crush it . 
  does n't necessarily mean that the whole drive is damaged . 
  could just be certain sectors . 
  spinrite would cause the drive to move the data to still-functioning sectors if possible . 
  i would n't recommend this as a planned solution , but could work if you did n't have a backup and wanted to get one last chance to read the data and make a backup before the drive completely fails . 
  yeah , i now know all about the horrors of comcast and verizon thanks to reddit and a few american-based podcasts . 
  i 'm confused , are you saying you do n't like twox , or you do n't like the fact that there 's an environment in which people feel it needs to exist ? 
  seriously !, 
  while we 're on the topic , the amount of pushing of adblockers and the bile directed towards those that dare say people should n't use them is insane . 
  ads are the reason we get all these cool things on the internet , people !, 
  if you 're blocking them , that 's tantamount to stealing , but ** worse ** , since you could * already * get it for free . 
  do n't forget you can pay for it here and vpn into america to get the us content whole still supporting their venture in australia . 
  i was with them for the last two years on their old $ 29 unlimited plan . 
  unlimited domestic calls , unlimited sms ( domestic and international ) , quite a bit of international calls , and 4 gb 3g data per month .
