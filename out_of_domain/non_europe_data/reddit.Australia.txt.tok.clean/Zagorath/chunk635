  oh god i * wish * this were true , but i know far too many people who eat all that shit up . 
  reality tv is extremely cheap for them to produce , and for some reason a * lot * of people really like it . 
  until that second factor goes away , i doubt reality tv is going anywhere any time soon . 
   accept you will lose the sports , or they will get too expensive to afford, 
  we have anti-siphoning laws here . 
  at least for the big 3 sports , some matches ( including all of the biggest ones ) are required by law to be available to free-to-air channels . 
  most importantly , included in this are the rugby league , afl , and cricket , as well as the olympic games . 
  this is an incredibly good law for the country , and is a huge advantage that we have over the united states or the uk , where there are no or very few requirements for what must be available on free-to-air . 
  sports fans over there * have * to pay more in order to be able to watch the sports . 
  with it being a favourite national passtime here , and an important part of our culture , so having it readily available free-to-air is important . 
   cut the amount of ads on his tv stations, 
  i like this in theory , but i 'm not sure how they would go about it in most cases . 
  the shows they have tend to be 20 -- 22 or 40 -- 44 minutes long . 
  they use ads to fill up the gap so everything works in neat half-hour blocks . 
  as much as i 'd like there to be * far * less advertising than there is now , it 'd be difficult to do without switching to something like 25 minute blocks , or even uneven blocks . 
  to me that just does n't feel quite as nice . 
  i agree fully with all the other bullet points . 
  ** especially ** regarding unique content . 
  i 'd love to see really high quality programming come out of this country , and frankly at the moment there 's just nothing there . 
  two lanes merging into one lane in such a way that it looks like a zipper ( like you might have on a jumper , or at your fly ) . 
  first the person from one lane goes , then the person from the other lane , etc. 
  in the past most references i 've seen to her on here have been negative . 
  i do n't think she 's generally held in high regard . 
  i mean , of course she 's leaps and bounds better than me , and probably you ( saying this , of course , not actually knowing anything about you ) , but for a professional she 's dull . 
  her performances are incredibly bland . 
  i think the only reason she 's popular is that she 's managed to use social media -- in particular youtube -- very well and built up a following of fans . 
  edit : references i 've * seen * , not * done * . 
  wow , so she 's got a shitty personality to go along with the bland playing ? 
  the uk 's laws are * much * more limited than ours . 
  the soccer , for example , only requires the finals of the major competitions be shown . 
  but that 's a good point regarding free online streaming of it . 
  i guess that would be nearly just as good . 
  the one exception being that many people like to make sports -- especially the big events -- a social gathering . 
  while * i * know how to set up my computer to display stuff on the tv , most people do n't , and the current free-to-air television model works better for this kind of thing . 
  oh god that all sounds amazing and now i want it so much . 
  a sorcerer archetype that gets its power from the gods . 
  gets some features similar to clerical domains . 
  someone posted a link either in this thread or the equivalent on / r/dnd to the pdf hosted on something you should be able to access -- dropbox , i think it was -- if you 're interested . 
  i came expecting a bunch of comments asking for a less cropped photo ( showing the girl ) . 
  reddit has pleasantly surprised me on this day . 
  one big thing that 's changed is that aussies and kiwis can now very easily sign up for netflix in their own countries . 
  i agree , * if * online voting can be done entirely securely and entirely without voting losing * any * of its anonymity , then i 'm all for it . 
  but that just has n't been shown to be possible yet . 
  you can do it securely if you are willing to sacrifice anonymity . 
  that 's a nearly trivial thing to do for anyone experienced with cryptography . 
  but to maintain anonymity , and still make sure everyone votes exactly once -- keeping a record of who has n't yet voted -- is much trickier . 
  i 'd want to see absolute unanimity among crytographers and security experts in whatever solution is proposed before they actually use it . 
  haha yeah ... 
  it was right after i made this comment that i scrolled down and noticed that the very next top-level comment was asking about that . 
  are you sure that 's true ? 
  [ i go to wallet.google.com and see my play purchases ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ennb0to.png ) . 
  i ca n't find any other sort of google wallet ... 
  fwiw i 've only ever used apple support through authorised third parties ( also in a country without any official stores ) , and they honoured my apple care brilliantly . 
  seriously this shit is infuriating . 
  i unsubbed from here ages ago because i was sick of the anti-apple sentiment , and only resubbed on april fool 's because it seemed like that sentiment had mostly dissipated . 
  i do n't care what people say , apple fans are generally really agreeable and logical people . 
  there are ** far ** more rabid anti-apple haters than irrational apple fanboys . 
  threads like this one make that perfectly clear . 
  [ good job supporting a shitty company ] ( http://youtu.be/sabl2wy1uzo ) . 
  dude do you have any idea how sick it is that you 're happy two people are going to be murdered ? 
  actually wait , do n't answer that . 
  i really do n't want to know your justification for murder . 
  oh god no !, 
  do n't let them on the mainland !, 
  i do n't know about historical origin , but thinking about it logically , it makes sense . 
  a lot of swords -- at least in fiction -- are given names related to what they do . 
  frodo 's sword , * sting * was so named because bilbo used it against giant spiders in the hobbit , and it stung them . 
  a weapon could easily be used to keep an oath , especially if that oath involved avenging someone or protecting them from harm . 
  thus , if someone has taken such an oath , they may name their sword oathkeeper in order to emphasise that that is something important to them . 
  i disagree . 
  i love the idea to use unicode arrows . 
  it 's clearly better than ` & lt - ` . 
  clearly it is n't an idea op came up with himself , no purple could possible have come up with what is so clearly a brilliant idea . 
  op is a thief . 
  hmm ... thanks . 
  i 'll definitely keep this in mind , but for now i 've got it doing everything i want . 
  i 'd rather not overhaul the behaviour of a bunch of different command line utilities without a specific purpose . 
  thanks anyway !, 
  not at all an accurate assessment . 
  very well respected journalist , known among people who follow him for being someone with * extremely * good integrity -- something sorely lacking in much of his industry -- does n't get invited . 
  fine . 
  but then he * does * get invited to an event by a third party . 
  the third party was told by samsung that they can invite some guests on their behalf , and they chose this guy . 
  however , when samsung finds out who they chose to invite with * their * invitation , they instead decide to rescind the invitation . 
  they do n't tell the person involved , they do n't tell the third party , they just go behind * everyone 's * back and secretly uninvite him . 
  then , when he goes to inquire into what happened , they refuse to tell him for days until he manages to rip it out of them . 
  but then , far , ** far ** worse , is the story with the indian bloggers . 
  that shit should be * illegal * . 
  the company should have been fined , and the specific individuals responsible for that should have seen * gaol * time for what they did . 
  that was ** extortion ** , plain and simple . 
   also i got hated on a few times for abbreviating `` doctor '' in the name, 
  some people -- especially those who only became fans since the relaunch in the 2000s -- probably think that it 's wrong to abbreviate it . 
  it 's not . 
  you 'll probably also get hated on for referring to the main character as `` dr. who '' . 
  ` he 's not doctor who , ' they 'll say , ` he 's `` the doctor . '' ', 
  well , [ i 'm here to tell you that you are in fact correct , and they are wrong ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjdgxpn.jpg ) . 
  that said , these days it is * incredibly * unorthodox to refer to the character as `` doctor who '' , so i 'd probably recommend against that . 
  reading your comments makes me think that if the show took itself a little more seriously i 'd really like it . 
  but the `` lul it 's so random '' people are kinda right ... the show is really random , and that puts me off . 
  character development , subplots , and story arcs in children 's cartoons are often ... not great ... but a couple of shows that i absolutely * love * are avatar and young justice , both of which do incredible jobs of these , and i love them .
