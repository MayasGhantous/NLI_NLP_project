  according to my googling `` central standard time '' in america is utc-6 . 
  utc +10 ( which , incidentally , is `` eastern standard time '' in australia ) to utc-6 is as simple as subtracting 16 hours . 
  that makes it 6:00 pm american central standard time . 
  i dunno if you guys have started with wibbly-wobbly magic time yet , but if you have , then despite your somewhat strange methodology , you got the right time . 
  if you know your own time zone ( which everyone should ) and the time zone in which the event takes place ( which every event organiser should provide , and i 'm * very * grateful to the organisers of this event for doing it , because far too many just tell you the name of the time zone , which is useless information , or even just leave it up to you to assume ) , it 's always just one simple mental maths calculation to know what time it is for you . 
  hope that helps ( both in this case and in the future ) . 
  it showed your public ip ? 
  i did n't see the original post , but it seems more likely to me that it would be showing your local ip -- assuming you 're behind a router . 
  did the number start with 192.168 . , 172. , or 10. , or something else ? 
  honestly i 'm really surprised at the reaction in these comments . 
  i assumed most people considered her a mediocre musician . 
  that 's what comments in the past have usually agreed . 
  not to mention that actually reading what she said , it 's pretty terrible . 
  and yet the comments are mostly defending her . 
  i 'm very confused . 
  basically , if it started with 192.168 , 172 . 
  * , or 10. , it was a local ip , and there was absolutely no need to worry about it . 
  without your public ip , that information is worth literally nothing . 
  my local ip right now is 192.168.1.3 , for example . 
  \\* small caveat , 172 . is only local if it 's between 172.16 and 172.31 , inclusive . 
  remember how in the last episode barry went through that truck ? 
  and do you know how the green lantern makes structures out of his ring ( the green things you 'll have seen if you ever watched justice league , young justice , or the green lantern movie ) ? 
  well , according to this flash fact , the flash can move through the green lantern structures in the same way he did through that truck . 
   really what we need is one more new class that emphasizes intelligence as a primary ability score . 
  \\* raises hand and waves it around \\*, 
  ooh !, 
  could we * please * get psionics the psion would be the perfect intelligence based full caster . 
  i do n't know all of them , but from what i can tell , most of your suggestions seem like they would be half casters . 
  and we already have the artificer in the form of a wizard archetype . 
  interestingly , even that does n't give the same result for everyone .

   it says that the medusa `` may force '' a player to make a check , so does that mean that they petrify voluntarily ? 
  or regardless when someone looks at their face they are petrified, 
  looks to me like raw the medusa can choose to use that power or not . 
  personally , i 'd be tempted to house rule it so that they * have * to force the player to make a check . 
  mainly so that stories like [ this one ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2cc629/the _ medusa / ) could take place . 
  it makes them a much more tragic figure . 
  sibelius ca n't itself , but the related photoscore can . 
  you 'll probably need a higher end version of it in order to do pdfs . 
  it should be easy enough to ... get your hands on it ... if you want to . 
  ( ninjaedit : looks like the free version now does pdfs . ), 
  you 'll definitely need to double check its results though , especially since the score you 're doing it with is a scanned copy -- an extremely good quality , sharp scan , but still not quite as good as if it were a printed-to-pdf sibelius score . 
  it 's likely to make a few errors in some locations . 
  best of luck . 
  definitely !, 
  i 'll consider adding more based on the feedback others give . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what you mean . 
  i put up all the entries for it that i could find in the subreddit , in the order that they were posted . 
  only taking submissions from things that have been posted on here and received at least generally positive feedback from this community . 
  keeps things simpler . 
  if there are posts in that 8chan thread that you like , consider submitting them individually here -- preferably in a format that 's easier to follow than [ this link is ] ( http://8archive.moe/tg/thread/65380/#q68252 ) . 
  i have no idea how to even read the story from that . 
  but if you can get screencaps of just the actual story , or a text-based thread with it in an easy-to-read format ( like [ this one is ] ( https://archive.moe/tg/thread/32461889/ ) for the shoggy the seldom dog story ) , and submit a link to them as a submission to the subreddit , then -- depending on how the subscribers receive it -- it could get added to the hof . 
  thanks !, 
  hmm ... yeah , good point . 
  thing is , it 's been submitted to the subreddit over the course of a number of separate parts . 
  would it be better to spin it off onto its own wiki page , and have each individual post linked to on there ? 
  a ) the last sentence is grammatically incorrect . 
  so at the very least , we can * all * agree it does have * something * wrong with it . 
  b ) most rational people would be against the idea of * killing * people for this . 
  gaol time ? 
  yeah , probably , but being hanged ? 
  holy fuck is that an overreaction . 
  i do n't know about other places , but where i live this would be illegal . 
  sudo vim / etc/hosts, 
  way too easy . 
  that said , you do n't even need to know how to do that . 
  you could literally just go into the app and tell it to stop running . 
  you 've obviously set the app up , so you can also stop it . 
  these sorts of self control apps only work because they provide an extra step to stop you . 
  for many people , that 's enough . 
  turns out i * may * be wrong . 
  i ca n't actually find any laws regarding the deliberate passive blocking of a phone signal . 
  what * is * absolutely illegal is any transmission designed to jam signals . 
  i would probably assume that the same grounds by which signal jamming is outlawed ( a number of reasons , not the least of which is it prevents people from contacting emergency services ) would mean that deliberately blocking signal would also be outlawed . 
  not sure why you 're using herostratus as a counter example . 
  the guy destroyed one of the wonders of the world , that 's a pretty great accomplishment . 
  terrible , but great . 
  could i ask why your website has a giant empty grey section at the top ?
