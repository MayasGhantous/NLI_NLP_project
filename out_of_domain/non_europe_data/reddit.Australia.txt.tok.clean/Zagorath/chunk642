  it gradually developed into an underarm action with a bounce , and eventually they started doing it overarm . 
  the name bowling was never changed . 
  oh , and i agree * so * much with regards to pilots telling you stuff . 
  i absolutely hate having my movie watching interupted by him telling me inane rubbish . 
  if it was posted 5 minutes ago , people could very easily have been up to 10 minutes into the podcast . 
  i know i have done that in the past ( though i was late to this one ) . 
  they could be commenting on something specific that was said in the first 10 minutes . 
  i have n't seen many comments downvoted that do n't seem in some way to deserve it , but if they 're there , i would probably suspect the downvotes are people trying to get their own comments seen more . 
  if there are a bunch of comments at 1 vote , they can downvote the others to have theirs appear near the top . 
  it 's ridiculously selfish and kinda pointless , but i can definitely imagine some people doing it . 
  [ here 's a direct link ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bzptumctkd_humj3nnfhtfnjq0k/view ) , because there 's absolutely no reason to be using tiny url to take me to a landing page first . 
  but anyway , thanks so much for this op . 
  should be * extremely * useful in picking races , and as a reference for dms . 
  if anyone 's interested , i made a random race generating table for anyone who wants to play a random race . 
  it has all the races released so far * except * for the eberron supplement , as well as separate tables for each of the subraces . 
  [ link is here ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m38-n7l1a5xtmzar_qppfen0dtiycib_1ywkxo6j6bi/edit?usp=sharing ) . 
  any feedback would be appreciated , particularly on how the numbers are balanced . 
  it 's really a work in progress . 
  which one ? 
  the eberron one that gave us changlings , shifters and warforged ? 
  ( by the way , if that 's the one you missed , it also has dragonmarks and an artificer school for wizards . ), 
  [ link ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_eberron_v1.pdf ) . 
  or was it the player 's supplement that gave us aarakocra , goliath , genassi , and deep gnomes ? 
  ( also has a number of elemental spells . ), 
  [ link ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ee_playerscompanion.pdf ) . 
  this one 's an official supplement , not unearthed arcana wips . 
  or perhaps you just missed the section of the dmg with eladrin and aasimar ? 
  they were released in the [ eberron unearthed arcana ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_eberron_v1.pdf ) , so they 're official , but they 're also works in progress . 
  yeah definitely agree . 
  really felt like he was just being difficult for the sake of being difficult there , which is n't somethin i normally think of him doing . 
  [ i 'm kinda hoping he 'll read this brief history of the word bowling in cricket ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cgpgrey/comments/32h0px/hi_35_are_my_teeth_real/cqbaaiz ) , but with the comment being so late , i 'm not sure how many comments he gets to . 
  just an fyi , his name is grey , with an e. 
  but wow , i just noticed that the keyboard in the background of that photo is in the dvorak layout . 
  has grey mentioned before on the podcast that he uses dvorak ? 
   one was physically abused by their parents, 
  yes , obviously . 
   one was emotionally repressed due to their parents ' religion, 
  again , yes . 
  you can teach your child your religion , fine . 
  but you do n't make it so that they are uncomfortable to live the way that they want to later in life . 
   one had to practically raise them self because their parents were never around, 
  depends . 
  if their financial circumstances were terrible for reasons genuinely out of their control , and both parents had to be constantly working , then they are not bad parents . 
  if they 're constantly working due to just being really bad financial planners , or if they 're `` never around '' for pretty much any other reason , then yeah , bad parents . 
   one was raised by a single mother because their father could n't handle the responsibility, 
  well , this one kinda references [ this other recent cmv ] ( / r/changemyview/comments / 32gca4/cmva _ dead_beat_dad_is_a_guy_that_leaves_after_he / ) . 
  if the father told the mother long before the baby was born that he wanted no part in the raising of the child , then i do n't blame him . 
  particularly if he paid child support but was otherwise unavailable , i see no fault . 
  if he abandoned later , or if he is able to but chooses not to pay child support , he 's a bad parent . 
  but the mother is certainly not a bad parent simply by virtue of being a single mother . 
  see the username . 
  there are just way too many acronyms and initialisms in this thread for me . 
  i find it very amusing that the company 's name is wasd and the keyboard layout is n't qwerty . 
  you could have just pasted the same link that you put in to tiny url : https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bzptumctkd_humj3nnfhtfnjq0k/view, 
  that would have worked just fine .

   yeah but it 's almost always 3 real downs and on 4th you punt, 
  that 's actually also exactly how rugby league works . 
  except that it 's 5 tackles before you kick -- and you nearly never go for the field goal option unless it 's tied and near the end of the game . 
  it 's actually quite interesting just how many similarities rugby league and gridiron have . 
  in some ways , rugby league is more alike to gridiron than it is to rugby union ( though probably not overall , really ) . 
  could we please avoid using the word `` football '' on its own in threads like this one ? 
  there are so many different football codes , and the thread is discussing all of them ( except soccer , i have n't seen anyone discussing it yet ) . 
  it 's making unnecessary ambiguity . 
  between gridiron , rugby union , rugby league , and even some aussie rules , saying the word `` football '' is just ... unhelpful . 
  but anyway , assuming you meant gridiron , yeah , i would probably agree with you . 
  the hits are generally going to have a lot more force to them . 
  yeah , gridiron is a name for american football . 
  i tend to use that term just because it sounds cooler to me -- more distinct -- but `` american football '' , or even `` nfl '' ( even though technically that only refers to the pro-level league ) work just fine for removing ambiguity . 
  good luck with the marathon !, 
  that 's a saying that works a lot better on a sign than spoken . 
  but still , it 's a brilliant saying . 
  rugby league and union are two completely separate sports , but very similar . 
  aussie rules is completely different again . 
  whenever someone says `` rugby '' , they 're nearly always talking about rugby union . 
  you get 3 points for a field goal , 5 for a try , and when there 's a tackle , play just continues -- the tackled player passes the ball out from under them to whoever 's there . 
  in practice , the game stops * all * . 
  * the * . 
  * time * because penalties get given out so easily . 
  rugby league is a bit like a cross between union and gridiron . 
  field goals are only 1 point ( hence they rarely go for them except as tie breakers ) , and tries are 4 . 
  when tackled , the tackled player stands back up and rolls the ball under his leg to a receiving player on his team . 
  the defenders have to get back 10 metres . 
  but unlike gridiron , this all happens during the flow of the game -- neither the play nor the clock stop during this time . 
  must say , if you 're canadian , i 'm * very * impressed that you are able to say you know some cricket . 
  but yeah , regarding gridiron , i 've seen a lot of comments in this thread indicating that americans do n't know the term . 
  have to say i 'm rather surprised at that . 
  i 'd always taken it for granted as being the normal term for american football . 
  interesting to learn that it 's not actually used in america ( or canada ) . 
   you wo n't get a new set of phases unless it 's by penalty in league , so ensuring you do n't get an overload by sacrificing a yard or two is fine, 
  yeah that 's exactly right . 
  i was n't pointing it out for any reason other than to make an interesting little parallel between the two sports . 
  i do n't do it , but if i did , i probably would n't bother taking them off . 
  they 'd be on there all year round , just because the effort of putting them on every august and taking them off every october would be too much . 
  you linked the same video twice there , mate .
