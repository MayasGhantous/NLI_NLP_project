  in a real government , you 're dealing with real people 's money , and you see real effects of the policies that you put in place . 
  how does that work in a model government ? 
  mmp is bad , because it formalises the existance of parties , and allows * parties * to choose who gets in to parliament , rather than the people . 
  stv is what the real australian government uses , and it 's what we should use here -- at least at first . 
  if someone wants to try and amend the constitution via a referendum , that could be possible . 
  do you not want to have a private party room , \u00e0 la / r/modelausgreens ? 
  somewhere you can discuss policy and other party issues without others being able to listen in ? 
  would it not be best if it were a private subreddit ? 
  somewhere that model alp members can discuss policy and other party issues in private , without non-members being able to see in , \u00e0 la / r/modelausgreens ? 
   well , they 've already referred to superman in the arrow season 2.5 comics , so he 's probably already there, 
  i do n't actually read the comics , but someone posted one page of the comic that referenced superman . 
  oliver said something along the lines of `` inside joke '' . 
  if that 's the only reference , it 's * really * vague . 
  i take it far more like a fun reference than actually admitting superman exists . 
  if superman * did * exist , and * was * going around saving the day , that would be a ** huge ** thing . 
  we would have heard something far more concrete . 
  even if he was n't well known , like `` the streak '' at the beginning of flash season 1 , there would have been something . 
   frost is closer than we think, 
  that just sounds like someone was misquoting game of thrones to me . 
  i 've just taken a quick look at the lilypond website . 
  how exactly does it differ from sibelius or finale ? 
  from the looks of it , it 's mostly just a cheaper ( and less easy to use -- at least in comparison to sibelius ) version of those . 
  did you miss the joke ? 
  a common phrase associated with game of thrones is `` winter is coming '' . 
  `` frost is closer than we think '' sounds like a misquote of that , kinda . 
  yeah it 's 100 in qld , though hours supervised by a registered driving instructor count for 3 times as much -- up to a maximum of 10 real hours ( for 30 counted hours ) . 
  i do n't know what state op is in , but in my state ( queensland ) , it 's no where near as easy as op makes out . 
  you can get your learner 's at 16 , if you pass a theory exam ( from memory , it 's something like 20 questions in two sections , with a maximum of one mistake on one section , and two mistakes on the other ) . 
  with your learner 's you have to be supervised by someone with a full licence , and you have to get 100 hours of driving experience . 
  after you get 100 hours , or a year passes , whichever comes * later * , you can do a practical driving exam to move on to your provisional ( p1 ) licence . 
  this comes with a number of restrictions , including the type of car you can drive , a stricter alcohol allowance ( zero bac , as opposed to the 0.05 that i think is allowed for open licences ) , and rules regarding passengers late at night . 
  after a couple of years of that , you can move on to a second type of provisional licence ( p2 ) . 
  some restrictions are lessened . 
  then , after a time , you finally move on to your open licence . 
  i think the youngest you can be when you get your open licence is something like 21 . 
  other states do things slightly differently , but the existence of * some * type of provisional licence is fairly universal , i think , at least on the east coast . 
  personally , i think the system to get a licence is perfectly fine . 
  though i do agree with op 's point regarding * keeping * it . 
  to me it seems far too few people stop driving when they really should no longer be on the road . 
  if you ca n't drive safely , you should n't be driving on the road . 
  not being able to go to work is no excuse . 
  you could walk , ride , take public transport ( which , at least in the biggest cities in australia , is * very * good ) , or carpool . 
  failing all that , you could get a taxi . 
  but as far as the laws regarding licences go , none of that matters . 
  the only thing that matters is whether or not a person is a competent enough driver to not be putting others or themselves at significant risk . 
  i ca n't speak for jetstar , but i fly air asia very frequently , and i 've never had my carry on weighed . 
  it 's nearly always over 7 kg . 
  probably over 10 , even . 
  god dammit man !, 
  could n't you have submitted this a week earlier ? 
  my birthday was last week !, 
   free princess cake for ikea family members ( valid for one month ) . 
  melbourne , perth and adelaide only, 
  probably should just remove that . 
  if it 's not valid in brisbane ( or at least seq , in this case the logan ikea ) , i do n't see any reason for it to be in this list . 
   so is darksun, 
  i 'm not quite so sure that one is . 
  i 've definitely seen a * lot * more people asking for dark sun stuff than spelljammer . 
  yeah op , you 're really not . 
  i was in there a while back , but less than a month went by before i decided it was just totally not worth being a part of . 
  would n't a 2-level dip into paladin be even * better * ? 
  they 'd get access to the exact same spells ( cure wounds and healing word ) , with the extra bonus of being able to heal exactly how much health they want using lay on hands . 
  though i guess they do sacrifice a level 's worth of spellcasting slots ... 
  yes , it 's pretty obvious that that is what / u/nomoch meant . 
  but with an encryption algorithm , you 're almost certainly going to end up with something that does n't resemble a real phone number . 
  real phone numbers typically start consistently . 
  for example , in my country , all mobile numbers start with 04 or 01 . 
  another country i 've lived in has them all starting with 09 . 
  ( ignoring country codes , in each case . ), 
  i 'm confused . 
  what is the relevance of this ? 
  dude ... spoilers ? 
  i think it 's nearly entirely his fault . 
  he 's the one that decided to go all crazy-arse on team arrow . 
  and he ( or , rather , the justice system as a whole ) is the one that * did n't * put him in some kind of protective custody . 
  seriously , they knew he would be a target , and did nothing about it . 
  that 's not oliver 's fault ** at all ** . 
  the question is , which side did that one guy vote for ? 
  must * have * , and could * have * swor * n * . 
  the problem is that most people are going to go with who they * like * rather than who they think actually would win . 
  there 'll be some people , like you , who vote based on who they actually think would win , but i think the majority would not . 
  and one that note , if i were to have voted , and if i were to have done it based on who i liked ( though if i actually did vote , it would n't be on those grounds ) , i would have ended up voting all the same ones in that actually won . 
  i ca n't stand hulk , captain america , or wonder woman . 
  they 're just terrible characters . 
  and i 've never heard of lobo . 
  he also murdered two people on-screen -- one of them a fan favourite character -- by phase shifting his arm through their chest . 
  seriously what the fuck lance . 
  * you * decided to have this fucking vendetta against team arrow based solely on oliver respecting * your * daughter 's wishes ( so be mad at her only , if anything ) . 
  * you * , and the justice system that you so love , are the ones responsible for not putting harper in some sort of protective custody even though you * knew * he would be a target for the other inmates . 
  take some fucking responsibility for your own actions , dude . 
  eh , i dunno how to feel about it . 
  on the one hand , yes , blackthorne 's performance was amazing . 
  but on the other , the people writing the script are making his character so fucking awful at this point . 
  the original age of mythology was released for mac -- but the expansion was n't . 
  because the expansion was n't , the steam rerelease is n't on os x. 
  but you might be able to get your hands on the original release if you know where to look . 
  ( \\* hint hint * ), 
  age of empires iii and both expansions were released on os x. 
  hahaha . 
  ouch .
