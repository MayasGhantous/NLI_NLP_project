   captain america can be okay, 
  i find him just stupid . 
  all the patriotic shit does n't belong in super heroes , in my opinion . 
  he 's basically superman without the more `` supernatural '' powers ( flying , heat vision , etc. 
  ) , and with even more patriotism . 
  oh , and a dumb shield . 
  wonder woman i do n't mind so much , i just really do n't understand why she 's considered one of the `` big three '' . 
  she 's never felt like a really major dc character to me . 
  if they acknowledged her as a second-tier character like the flash , green lantern , and basically everyone else that 's a major character , but not as major as supes and bats , i probably would n't mind her as much . 
   in fact i think in the comic it is implied that xavier payed lobo to throw the fight, 
  hahaha that 's brilliant . 
  the comic 's basically going `` fuck you , fans , you made the wrong decision , so here it is . '', 
  i love it . 
  it is now . 
  people also rarely say `` break my fast '' or `` sup '' as verbs related to eating . 
  heck , even `` dine '' is somewhat uncommon these days , people more often say `` have dinner '' . 
  does n't mean that someone ca n't say that `` lunch '' * can * be a verb , and that , strictly speaking , if you 've ever had lunch , then you have `` lunched '' . 
  is `` sup '' as in `` to sip a liquid '' the past tense of the word ? 
  i dunno why , it just feels like it . 
  `` i sup my soup '' sounds like it could have been valid once . 
  when i did my ib exams , i used the [ tl-027 ] ( http://flexoffice.com.vn/userfiles/image/but/tl025.jpg ) pens that i used all through high school , that i got free from the school . 
  they 're not fancy , but they 're cheap , reliable , and have 0.5 mm tips , which are really important for me with my extremely messy left-handed handwriting . 
  this is now my head canon . 
  and only about a week to go . 
  pretty damn excited . 
  i did n't know about all that history of ww . 
  a real shame , too ... 
  i think this may not get the results you 're looking for if you do n't mark it [ serious ] . 
  unfortunately , i 'm not actually sure if you can . 
  is there a `` flair '' option ( possibly next to or near the `` delete '' and `` nsfw '' buttons ) ? 
  perhaps that can do it . 
  i ca n't see how any cipher could leave it in the correct format ( starting with the correct numbers , in particular ) , unless you just decided `` i 'm not going to apply the cipher to the first two digits '' . 
  i mean , that 's easy enough to do , my main point was simply that you ca n't just directly apply the cipher . 
  ninjaedit : and is n't sha-256 a hash ? 
  a one-way function , that could n't be used for reversible encryption , anyway ? 
  not that that was a key part of your argument , though . 
  guess it is n't possible . 
  just got ta hope you get good responses , then . 
  looks like you ( mostly ) have so far , at least . 
  oh , right . 
  i guess that it is n't a * complete * non sequitur , then ... 
  oh god , that 's brilliant !, 
  i wish google now did more of these things . 
  have a bit of a personality like siri and cortana do . 
  thanks for this . 
  i thought it was obvious that it had to be a joke . 
  if supes was around in the world ( and especially if he was supergirl 's `` famous cousin '' , indicating he was well-known , and not operating secretly , or captured by the government ) , * we would have heard about it * in arrow and the flash . 
  instead , every indication was that people had never heard of the idea of super powers prior to the particle accelerator 's malfunction . 
  so it 's nice to have first-party evidence that this interpretation was correct . 
  oh thanks , awesome !, 
  i was n't even asking if it 's * still * valid . 
  my question was really much broader than that , asking whether that was * ever * the way it was used . 
  so knowing that not only was it once used like that , but it * still * is , is definitely a definitive answer to the question !, 
  i forgot the game was that old !, 
  it was 10.7 that they removed rosetta , right ? 
   peeked my interest, 
  it 's piqued , mate , 
  side note , you still playing ? 
  i do n't think i 've seen you around in ages . 
  so it 's gambling . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  as long as there actually * is * a prize at the end , it seems perfectly okay to me . 
  ( i 'm talking about the ipad raffle thing here . 
  just clarifying because i was n't sure whether you were talking about the ipad raffle or the dead horse one . ), 
  oh right . 
  so it is n't just a raffle where each thing you put in increases your chances in a random drawing , it 's bidding on something , but even if you do n't win the bidding , you still pay the amount you bid ? 
  that 's absolutely incredible . 
  i 'm amazed at how that would n't be incredibly illegal !, 
   people will get into heated bidding wars and pay way more than an item is worth , not because they want the item , but because they do n't want to walk away completely empty-handed, 
  very interesting . 
  sounds like a sort of [ sunk cost effect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escalation_of_commitment ) . 
  say the item is worth $ 200 , but you do n't want it enough to pay full price , so you decide to bid on this . 
  you bid up to $ 100 , but someone else bids $ 110 . 
  you follow up with $ 120 , and so on until you eventually bid $ 200 . 
  now , when the other person bids over you , if you keep going , you 'll be paying more than if you had just bought the thing . 
  but of course , because you 've * already * lost that $ 200 , you figure that you have to keep going until you win , otherwise you 'll have completely * wasted * that $ 200 . 
  and of course , the other person is thinking pretty much the same thing . 
  and so you keep raising the price until one of you decides to finally cut their losses and let the other person have it , for much more than it 's worth . 
  it 's a photo , so let 's not talk video resolution , let 's talk photo resolution . 
  even so , the highest resolution camera i can find is the canon 5ds , at 8688 x 5792 ( 50.3 megapixels ) . 
  so not * much * larger than 8k . 
  the photo would presumably be in portrait , since it 's just a single person . 
  that gives you 8688 horizontal single-pixel strips . 
  but you 're absolutely right , even this is not enough to make anywhere * near * a million dollars . 
  far better to sell each pixel for $ 1 . 
  fuck , sell each pixel for one * cent * and you 'll be half way to a million . 
  that 's stupid . 
  derivative , even . 
  i 'll do something * original * . 
  i 'm making lasagna . 
  at 8000 pixels tall per photo , you 'd need 125 photos tall before you got to one million . 
  and you 'd have to balance that out with more photos wide . 
  that is a * lot * of photos to take . 
  would be ridiculously hard at every stage , from the length of time it would take to actually shoot all the photos , to the * enormous * amount of computing power to stitch all that together . 
  if you use the space as a decimal separator , yeah . 
  the problem is that [ the correct number is one hundred and forty five point six eight six ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ylwzz70.png ) . 
  you seem to be implying it 's one hundred and forty five thousand , six hundred and eighty six point zero . 
  to separate thousands , millions , etc. , commas , full stops , and spaces are all used . 
  but for the decimal separator , to my knowledge , only full stops and commas are used . 
  so a space is unambiguously separating thousands etc.
