  ( well , unless you interpret it as two separate numbers , but in most cases it 's clearly not going to be that ) . 
  right , but the point is you can * choose * exactly how much you give out up to a total of 10 hp per day . 
  if you only want to use it to get someone back up after they 're knocked unconscious , you can use that 10 times per day , or you can get someone all the way back up to 10 hp once , if you 'd prefer . 
  that 's brilliant . 
  interestingly , for me google is just not showing any separator at all . 
  i guess that 's probably what we -- officially -- do here in australia ? 
  really weirdly , though , [ it * is * showing the separator when it says how many search results there are ] ( http://i.imgur.com/npwzjtv.png ) . 
   now you did search for 3.6 million acres . 
  haha yeah that was deliberate just to make the output greater than 10 thousand square kilometres , to see if that would force it to add a comma or something . 
  but wow , all those inconsistancies are absolutely hilarious . 
  yeah i agree , phb 3 was fantastically designed . 
  phb 2 , on the other hand , is a bit of a mess . 
  primal , arcane , and divine stuff all thrown into the one unfocused book . 
   for instance , the free elemental evil thing with the races and spells did n't list spells for clerics and paladins . 
  i thought that was because there * were n't * any new spells made for those classes . 
  i 'm pretty sure i saw some other commenters saying that the published book has a bit * less * of the spells and race content than the free supplement did . 
  is there anything contained in the soft cover version that is n't also in the pdf ? 
  have you ever considered teaching in an international school ? 
  my parents were teachers in a western country , but when i was 10 , we moved to asia and they started teaching at international schools . 
  class sizes tend to be somewhat smaller ; if you 're at a good school they usually have good supply budgets ; parents who care * too much * about how their kids are doing are far more of a problem than the reverse ; and there is a ** much ** higher degree of respect for the profession all around . 
  students are easier to deal with . 
  plus you get the whole experience of living overseas . 
  cheaper costs of living ( in general ; this is less true for say korea or japan than it is for vietnam or the philippines ) , and experiencing the whole different culture . 
  it 's not for everyone , but it 's something i would highly recommend at least checking out . 
  yeah that 's what i 've figured . 
  i 've only tried it a handful of times , but here in aus it 's never worked for me . 
  second sunday of may in most countries , including australia , canada , new zealand , and the united states . 
  should be pretty easy to work out from that . 
  in the uk and ireland it 's the fourth sunday in lent . 
  i dunno about most people , but i have no idea when lent is , so if i were from these countries i 'd just be looking up the date online . 
  so you 've already missed it for this year . 
  four words : utilities , visit , locked , screen . 
  wait , what were we doing again ? 
  he also has a fantastic series of lectures on every single one of beethoven 's piano sonatas , and imo his renditions of them are among the best . 
  [ link to them here ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/music/classical/page/0,,1943867,00.html ) . 
  the sonata # 14 `` moonlight '' and # 8 `` path\u00e9tique '' are two where he has some very interesting and somewhat controversial things to say . 
  personally , i 'd recommend getting the monster manual . 
  that way you have one of each of the core books . 
  the battle map could be useful too , though my group tends to do theatre of the mind or really rough hand-drawn maps . 
  i found it amusing at first , like it was deliberately ironic . 
  but then as it goes on and on and on , it 's seeming more and more like the people saying these things actually * mean * them in some sort of weird way . 
  i thought hank was a hairstyle , not a `` who '' ... 
  i assume you 're the one that reported this ? 
  thanks for your concern , but really , come on . 
  it 's a harmless joke . 
  i hate using the term , because it 's become such a circlejerk , but you 're really acting like some sort of `` white knight '' who 's taking some sort of moral high ground just for the sake of being superior to everyone . 
  if you are n't the one that reported it , then i apologise for the assumption . 
  fair enough . 
  my apologies . 
  what if i do n't have a friend named george ? 
  can i set my friend fred instead ? 
  that really makes me sad . 
  as someone from another common law country ( not america , but somewhere else that has a jury of your peers in trials , unlike where the person you replied to is from ) i would * love * to get jury duty . 
  i once got sent a summons while i was overseas , and was upset that i missed the opportunity . 
  it 's like voting ; an important part of being a citizen of your country and you should be proud to do it . 
  out of curiosity , where are you from ? 
  i 'm gon na guess mainland europe , because i know most of the anglosphere countries have common law and verdicts are decided by juries . 
  i 'm curious , where are you from ? 
  you use practice with a `` c '' as a verb , but also spell labour with a `` u '' . 
  an interesting combination that i do n't think many americans , brits , or australians would do , which leaves canada as my first guess . 
  that 's what the phrase `` jury of your peers '' means today . 
  it may not be where the origin of the term came from , but today it nearly universally means that . 
  in the commonwealth ( possibly excluding canada -- it can be hard to tell what they 're gon na do ) if it 's a verb , it 's usually spelt `` practise '' . 
  as in `` i am practising my routine '' . 
  the noun form is still spelt with a `` c '' , though , as in `` i 'm going to do some practice '' . 
  from pet_shop import pets, 
  for pet in pets :, 
  pet.eat ( ), 
  and yes , my choice of language here was very deliberate . 
  yeah , it certainly would have been more pythonic , now that i think of it . 
  wait you can watch media files ? 
  i thought they were just a cheap source of a tiny amount of xm . 
  yeah , i really should have done ` self.eat ( pet ) ` . 
  yeah definitely agree . 
  mozart 's later works are absolutely incredible . 
  the 40th and 41st symphonies , the clarinet concerto , and of course the requiem are all among my absolute favourite pieces of the classical era . 
  i studied his jupiter symphony as one of our set pieces in high school ( the other being el sal\u00f3n m\u00e9xico by copland ) . 
  it really gave me a new appreciation for mozart 's work . 
  it 's so incredibly complex , and feels so much more powerful than many of his earlier works ( especially the early symphonies and piano stuff ) . 
  yeah , this . 
  most of his earlier works pretty much sounds like exactly what the average person is thinking of when they say `` classical music is so boring . 
  it does n't capture human emotions in the same way [ insert their preferred genre here ] does '' . 
  yeah tpg where i am is rated sd , too . 
  ca n't say that 's very accurate in my experience . 
  i 've done plenty of youtube 720p streaming without needing to wait for buffering . 
  not to mention that looking at [ their graph ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mojltwv.png ) , it really looks like they 're getting a [ really good amount of hd ] ( http://i.imgur.com/riohfoi.png ) . 
  batman 's ** one ** rule is that he * does n't * kill . 
  for me , it depends on how the characters have their backstory built . 
  if the players built their characters with each other in mind , and all know each other , doing a quieter start is much easier . 
  whereas if they do n't already know each other ( they built their characters independently of each other ) , throwing them right into the action is a great way to get them to act as a party and get them immediately hooked in to the plot . 
  of course , that 's just one of the potential factors at play . 
  / u/ferrous-bueller describes a couple of other useful factors to consider . 
   alignment is descriptive , not prescriptive, 
  this is * so * important , and i feel a lot of people do n't get it . 
  `` that action does n't match up with your alignment . '', 
  yeah , that 's because on this one particular situation , maybe my alignment does n't accurately describe how i feel . 
  i also really like your descriptive of `` evil '' as not being necessarily truly `` evil '' , but instead self-interested . 
  i do n't think that 's how many people actually use it , but to me it feels like a really `` good '' way to describe it . 
  not a huge fan of some of the examples of characters with the various alignments , though some are absolutely spot on . 
  you can edit it to put a backslash ( i.e. , '' ` \\ ` '' ) before each of the asterisks , to make it display as an actual asterisk .
