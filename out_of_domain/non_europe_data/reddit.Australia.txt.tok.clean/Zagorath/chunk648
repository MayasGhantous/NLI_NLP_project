  still , i see what you 're saying . 
  it 's certainly very different from past tr games . 
  the way i would * hope * they 'd take this series reboot is that this is the origin story , so it 's necessarily different . 
  i would hope that the next game might be a bit more like the classics , and the third game will be a true classic tomb raider game . 
  but game series rarely seem to develop narratively [ in the way that seems best ] ( / r/gaming/comments / 2j1b1s/last _ mission_assassinate_hitler_but_it_must_look / cl7jy4j?context = 1 ) to me , so what do i know ... 
  hahaha yeah . 
  it 's absolutely insane how conservative those two countries are . 
  i 'm curious , were you at one of the international schools there ? 
  just from your username i 'm guessing you are n't singaporean . 
  fair enough mate . 
   enjoy my entree, 
  hang on . 
  i thought you were british ? 
  should n't you be using entree to mean , you know , the entry ? 
  instead of the word somehow meaning `` main course '' ? 
  yeah same . 
  there are a lot of different things i would consider calling it , but all of them include the word `` battery '' . 
  you can always count on reddit to be technically correct . 
   then again , this is reddit , i 'm not gon na start ending my comments with apa bibliographies . 
  good , because the accepted style on this site is the chicago style . 
  i was taught that it should be `` aitch '' , but i really frequently hear `` haitch '' . 
  quite frankly it sounds horrible . 
  like the british poster said further up the thread , it feels like something that only chavs -- or , in our case , bogans -- would say . 
  except that i 've heard it used even by educated , normal people . 
  oh yeah , i know the school . 
  i visited there in 2008 for the fobissea music festival . 
  but oh god , that story is hilarious . 
  i assume he was there because the government required the school let him give his spiel ? 
  this is talking about adsl or cable based internet , not 3g/4g mobile internet . 
  would n't it be better for them to use a 172.16 -- 31 . 
  * ( using this rather than 10 . 
  * purely because it 's slightly less recognisable ) address , then ? 
  or perhaps a 127 . 
  * one . 
  yeah i 'm having the same problem all of a sudden . 
  only it 's not all the time , only some of the time . 
  oh man that is so awesome . 
  what 's the time in utc ? 
  so those of us that are n't in america can work out when it is . 
  oh man that sucks ... 
  i 've never had to take mine off at uq . 
  i think with internet.org the important difference is that without this , there would * be * no internet access where they are . 
  either that , or these people would simply not be able to afford to use it . 
  is it not far * better * to be able to access informational services like wikipedia , or be able to communicate for free over great distances with facebook , than to have no access at all ? 
  i 'm not sure exactly how it works , since their ads are n't really about what the service does so much as trying to explain why it 's necessary , by appealing to emotion . 
  no he 's not . 
  he * should * be , because that 's how everyone other than americans ( and maybe canadians ) use it , and he 's not american . 
  but he mentioned appetizer , entree , and dessert . 
  in that context , he 's clearly using the american use of entree , meaning main course . 
  monks do n't have any such features . 
  there 's no reason that they should have to stick to any particular set of actions . 
  they get their power from the ki within themselves , and through training . 
  paladins do n't have to stick to an alignment , they have to stick to a specific oath . 
  the oath does n't specify alignment at all , though obviously some oathes have a tendency towards some alignments . 
  but acting against your alignment does n't necessarily mean you 're also breaking your vow . 
  and , well , if you 're talking about editions prior to 4e , i personally consider that an example of poor game design . 
  because alignment by its very nature * should * be prescriptive , but they are forcing it to be otherwise . 
  4e fixed this ( though it also got rid of the 3 by 3 alignment grid -- an action i 'm not a huge fan of ) and 5e continued with this idea ( but also , thankfully , put back the classic system ) . 
  yeah the fact that the first time i ever heard of it was through advertising left a bad taste in my mouth . 
  there is n't even a call to action ( no `` please donate now '' or anything similar ) , it feels like they 're just saying `` oh , look how great we are for doing this '' , just wanking over their own philanthropy . 
  but to be honest , i do n't think they will benefit all that much from it . 
  the market they 're providing this to is n't exactly the most affluent , so advertisers are n't going to pay all that much to market to them , i would n't think . 
  how exactly do you do `` piloting rolls '' and similar ? 
  i had my characters trying to drive a cart at pace through heavy forest , and i was n't sure how to play it out mechanically . 
  i ca n't remember which stat i keyed it off , but i let them use their proficiency with vehicles ( land ) . 
   especially now that iinet is tpg, 
  no they 're not . 
  the buyout has n't yet been approved by everyone that needs to approve it ( shareholders , regulators , etc. 
  nah , do n't ban access , just have a message pop up saying `` your bad service is due to your isp , optus . 
  if you would like the service to improve , contact them here : '' , and then have links to contact them . 
  overload their customer support with complaints . 
  i loved vaya the whole time i was with them . 
  i had a fantastic plan completely uncomparible to anything else on the market . 
  early march they tell me that my plan is ending and i 'll have to switch to another plan . 
  they say that by default i 'll be put on their $ 44 plan ( i previously only paid $ 29 ) , or i can ask to be put on a different one . 
  it was after the 2 years that the guaranteed i could stay on the same plan , so fine . 
  i 'm a bit annoyed , but i can respect that business decision . 
  but just to make sure , i send their customer support a message asking if they absolutely * must * switch me off , because if so i 'm moving to another company ( purely because the current vaya offerings are n't as good for me as what other companies offer ) . 
  it 's like a week or two later that they finally respond , telling me no . 
  so i go to sign up for another company , but due to some clerical errors on their part , my sim did n't arrive before the end of the month . 
  so on the 31st i send them a message saying that i want to be put on their $ 18 plan , because there 's absolutely no way i want to be on the $ 44 one , and if they charge me $ 44 i 'll be contesting it with my bank , because i did * not * agree to that . 
  paying that much is ridiculous . 
  they reply essentially saying nope , you 're stuck on the $ 44 one , give us the money . 
  there 's no way on their website to stop it , so my auto-payment just paid it . 
  i 'm on my new plan now , and as soon as i get my security deposit back from vaya ( something they implemented just a few weeks before sending out all their `` sorry , we 've got to take you off your plan and shift you on to a more expensive one '' messages ) i 'm contesting it . 
  i 'm on [ yatango ] ( https://yatango.com.au/mobile/?referral=8457619406172&amp;utm_source=friendreferral&amp;utm_medium=dashboard&amp;utm_campaign=mgm ) * now . 
  highly recommend . 
  you build your own plan according to how much data , text , calls , and international calls you want . 
  and you can change from month to month , so if you expect to be away from home , for example , you can give yourself more data just for that month . 
  tl ; dr i thought vaya was a good company , but then they started doing really shitty ( and somewhat shady ) stuff . 
  \\* full disclosure , that link is a referral link . 
  if anyone signs up to yatango with that link , both that person and myself get $ 20 credit . 
  i 'm with [ yatango ] ( https://yatango.com.au/mobile/?referral=8457619406172&amp;utm_source=friendreferral&amp;utm_medium=dashboard&amp;utm_campaign=mgm ) . 
  i was with vaya until recently ( see [ this comment ] ( / r/australia/comments / 336w42/optus _ wants_netflix_to_pay_up_to_ensure_quality / cqibiec ) for why ) , but i have to say yatango is awesome . 
  great prices , but more importantly you can choose a custom plan to fit you . 
  you slide up and down how much call , text , data , and international calling you want , and you can change that on a month-by-month basis , if you expect to need more of something in a specific month ( in my case , some months i expect to be away from home a lot , so i 'll probably give myself more data in those months ) . 
  same coverage as vaya ( optus 4g ) . 
  on a weird note , i actually found out about them through advertising on facebook . 
  perhaps the only time i 've ever really had an ad on facebook convince me to buy something ... 
  i am a clarinetist , and i love the piece .
