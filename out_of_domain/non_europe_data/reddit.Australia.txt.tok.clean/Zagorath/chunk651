  most i 've seen still have it on by default , though they use the more secure push button rather than static pins . 
  i know when wps first came out , having it on by default was a requirement to get wifi certified . 
  is that not still the case ? 
  hmm ... 
  i do n't know when they were * built * , but i 've set up 3 new routers in the last 6 months and all of them had wps on by default . 
  but as i said , it was push-button , not pin , which is vastly more secure ( as far as i 'm aware , the only known vulnerability is physical access ) . 
  yeah definitely , it was long . 
  i thought they would fade to black just after they sat down on the bed and felicity pushed oliver down , and instead they showed like 20 or 30 seconds more ... it was ridiculous . 
  that said , i 've hated the olicity stuff this whole season , but on the whole i actually thought it was done well this episode . 
  tbh i could n't give a crap about comic lore . 
  i want this show to do what 's good for * it * . 
  on the whole i 'm still skeptical of olicity , but if they continue to handle it like this episode did , that could change . 
  i actually think that , compared to the rest of this season , olicity was handled * really * well this episode . 
  i ca n't say what it was exactly , but the pairing did n't feel awkward and forced like it has the rest of this season . 
  it 's the princess bride . 
  and do n't worry about the name , it 's actually a pretty damn good movie . 
  it gets * way * overhyped : it 's not a fantastic movie , so do n't go into it with that mindset ( and if you read too many comments on reddit about it , there 's a good chance you * will * get that mindset ) , but it is still a very good one , with two or three absolutely fantastic scenes . 
  more importantly , it 's one that 's heavily referenced in other culture and you 'll see quotes from it all over the place . 
  very worth watching . 
   replacing `` britta 's the worst '' quotes with laurels name last season was basically free karma, 
  yeah , but you would n't even need to watch community to support that !, 
  now , saying `` laurel 's the opposite of batman '' would be a more obvious community reference , while still being somewhat understandable by people that have n't watched it . 
  i disagree re lance . 
  he 's acting as though oliver is at fault for not telling him that sarah died . 
  for fuck 's sake lance , he did that because , * and only because * , ** your own fucking daughter ** told him to . 
  he respected her wishes . 
  not to mention blaming oliver for roy `` dying '' , when * you * could have been the one to put him in some sort of protective confinement instead , since you * knew * he 'd be a target . 
  oh my god . 
  when that scene happened it did n't even occur to me that the character 's name was john !, 
  i mean , the got reference was obvious enough with just `` you know nothing '' . 
  but that makes it so much more awesome . 
  [ no , the characters with guns are much worse . 
  reddit 's adoptive baby , perhaps , since the phrase by no means originated here . 
  but i agree completely , whenever you see correlation , the very next thing to do should always be to search for potential causal effects ( in either direction ) , as there 's probably a pretty decent chance that one causes the other , and if it does n't , then it 's at least worth ruling that out so you can start to look for other factors . 
  as randall munroe of xkcd said , `` correlation does n't imply causation , but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing ` look over there ' . '', 
  10 days `` find out if he uploaded it to mega ( or elsewhere ) '', 
  i 'm just curious as to why you would ask the other person 's age ? 
  it seems a reasonable question for anyone to ask . 
  just looked up that song . 
  it 's [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cno20onk9dy ) for anyone else who wants an easy link . 
  have to say , that 's only the second cake song i 've heard ( the first being short skirt , long jacket , an instrumental version of which is used as the opening theme in * chuck * ) , but i already think i love the band . 
  yeah , it annoys me . 
  but fwiw this is n't the only show to do it . 
  the flash and arrow both got off of a short hiatus this week after a few weeks , and that was the second or third ( from memory ) not including over christmas , and those explained by other holidays . 
  but lol ... i 'm also in australia and i never even considered watching it on tv . 
  is what they 're showing even remotely up-to-date ? 
  i know that aussie tv ( i think it was 9 , but i could be wrong ) only started season 3 of arrow a few weeks ago , at least based on ads i saw a while back . 
  edit : looked it up . 
  apparently it still has n't started airing here , they just start advertising it like 6 months in advance of when it actually starts airing . 
  and it 's on go . 
  what exactly is this about ? 
  i saw some guy going on about `` john '' a couple of days ago , just saying it over and over again for no reason . 
  i started coming in with famous john names like `` williams '' , `` green '' , and `` c dvorak '' . 
  oh that 's awesome !, 
  thanks for letting me know !, 
  ( and for making me the first one on reddit to find out . 
  makes me feel so special :p ), 
  oh man , this is good . 
  very subtle , but so good . 
  took me a couple of reads to get it . 
  i thought it was saying the change is from the * key * of f natural to f sharp ( which made no sense considering ( a ) what 's that got to do with `` too major '' ? 
  and ( b ) the piece is n't in f to start with ) , but it 's actually saying it changes the * note * f natural to f sharp . 
  the piece itself is , of course , in the key of d minor . 
  oh right . 
  yeah , nobody ever uses the word these days . 
  it 's an archaic term that was popular in the 1920s -- at least in england , but i suspect also in the states -- to describe young women who were progressive or modern . 
  with implications of loose sexuality . 
  you 'll generally only hear it today if you 're watching historical dramas or reading about actual history . 
  '97 age of empires . 
  ( yeah i know , odd naming . ), 
  to name a few from roughly the same time period you 've already named . 
  keeping it short because i wanted to keep it down to the games that i think * really * deserve it , and also games that i think are somewhat less likely to be mentioned . 
  my group typically does sneaky things between sessions , with the dm informing other players of anything they 'd notice . 
  if you did n't get a mobile phone until university , i find it hard to believe you 're actually a `` millenial '' . 
  i mean , i know the term is fairly vague and ill-defined , but i feel unsure about using it myself and i 'm * currently * at university . 
  that 's one perspective . 
  the other is which direction you would write it in . 
  most people write from top to bottom , and thus / goes backwards ( against the direction of the rest of the writing in ltr languages like english ) and \\ goes forwards . 
  personally , the way i remember it is that `` forward '' is normal , and '' / '' is the normal slash : the one you use when talking about this/that , or use on websites , or use in * nix filesystems . 
  \\ is the backwards way windows goes about it .

  \\ is the backwards way windows goes about it . 
  even better is if you use search keywords . 
  `` r '' is set up to https://reddit.com/r/%s '' , `` yt '' is `` https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%s '' , and `` pb '' is `` http://thepiratebay.org/search/%s '' . 
  just type `` r askreddit '' and hit enter into the browser and i get taken straight to / r/askreddit . 
  there 's really no ambiguity . 
  or not much , at least . 
  handguns , rifles , shotguns are all obviously included . 
  the only ambiguity would be if you somehow thought he also wanted to include airsoft guns , paintball guns , maybe even glue guns etc. , but that feels like a bit of a stretch . 
  i used to live in saigon , where it 's rare for the high to be under 28 . 
  i got cold living * there * during the `` winter '' months . 
  brisbane is just unbearable for me . 
  i liked expansion packs back in the day , and i like large dlcs that are the equivalent of what expansion packs were today ( skyrim 's 3 dlcs , for example ) . 
  but all the micro-purchases are just ridiculous . 
  i do n't mind them * too * much when it 's purely cosmetic stuff , though i 'm never going to buy them . 
  i had to google `` cloche and loose '' , but yeah , that 's pretty much the same image it elicits from me . 
  if i just saw the image part of the logo there 's no way i 'd recognise it . 
  though if it said `` star '' on it ( like most of the shirts i 've seen online , and the one op linked to do ) , it 's pretty hard not to get the reference . 
  fully agree . 
  personally i actually do n't mod the game very much , but to me legendary is worth it just because the dawnguard questline is my absolute favourite part of the game .
