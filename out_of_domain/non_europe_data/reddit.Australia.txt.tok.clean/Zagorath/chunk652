  serana is imo the best character in the game by a mile -- the only one with any real personality . 
  yeah definitely agree . 
  i 'd * maaaybe * give them advantage , but even that seems a bit too much . 
  more reasonable seems that you 'd be a little freer in giving out inspiration to related roleplaying . 
  should put gpa as a percentage , because it 's something everyone can more easily adjust to . 
  i have no idea how the us system works , because just based on comments i 've read , it does n't seem that a gpa of 4.0 means you get perfect scores , and a 3.0 means you get about 75 % on each test ... 
  there are two big things recently he 's blamed oliver for that male no sense . 
  the first is that ollie did n't tell him his daughter died . 
  he did that purely at the request of laurel . 
  it 's her family , and he respected her wishes . 
  the second is roy 's `` death '' . 
  lance could have seen to it that roy was put in protective custody where others could n't get to him . 
  he * knew * roy would be a target , but chose to leave him in normal public gaol anyway . 
  that 's all on him . 
  wow i 've never seen that subreddit before , but if it 's usually similar to that thread , i like it . 
  i 've avoided / r/badx subreddits mainly because the first i saw was bad linguistics , and it 's just a shit hole full of shitty people . 
   move the lines as it does with the minimal wage . 
  except that minimum wage does n't do that ? 
  i mean , yes it does , but only by a fraction of the amount the minimum wage increases . 
  small , gradual increases in minimum wage have a net positive effect on purchasing power . 
  it 's also anzac day in australia and new zealand . 
  sort of their remembrance day , though they also observe the actual remembrance day on 11/11 . 
  and i know at least 3 people irl who have their birthday today . 
  2 of them are aussies ... 
  which comments exactly were hers ? 
  i 'm assuming the reply to the top comment , but that seems totally reasonable . 
  the thread was asking who gets criticism , and she was explaining her thoughts on that criticism . 
  oh right , the whole comment is deleted , not just the username ? 
  [ my record is a little over 4,500 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vzwwhok.png ) . 
  i had a week without internet , so i got pretty damn good at the game . 
  probably just autocorrect . 
  [ the current top post of the subreddit seems to agree with you ] ( / r/australia/comments / 33qpgm/americanisation _ of_anzac_day / ) . 
  the fact that you defend the lawsuits over plain packaging laws ( well , not defend per se , but at least rationalise and say it has `` some backing '' ) clearly shows me that while you may understand the details of the laws , your political stance on this is one that i find frankly abhorrent . 
  and i find it astonishing that you can hold this opinion while purporting to be in line with greens thinking in / r/modelparliament . 
  we passed plain packaging laws because tobacco is a terrible scourge on society , and while individuals should be able to make their own decisions , businesses should not be able to get away with enticing over young people through pretty packaging . 
  this is something we as a society decided upon , and it should be up to us as a society to remove it if need be . 
  foreign corporations have no business suing our government over this just because they 're going to lose some money . 
  and using it as leverage to prevent other countries taking the same incredibly progressive steps forward makes it even worse . 
  they should simply not be * able * to make this suit in the first place . 
  that said , i * do * agree with the ethyl case . 
  but i think the important distinction here is that one is something that applies an equal penalty to all companies , and one could be clearly demonstrated to be a case of the government enacting protectionist policies . 
  i like the idea of the terms in the ttip that you quoted . 
  but anyway , for me , the biggest thing i have against the trans-pacific partnership is the intellectual property side of it , [ as described here ] ( https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp ) . 
  copyright terms are already too long , and while i 'm not a fan of australia 's current stance on ip , having american-like dmca laws required by the tpp would be even worse . 
  [ this document , in particular ] ( https://www.eff.org/document/isp-liability-and-tpp ) outlines some of the worst aspects of it . 
  but while i 'm on the topic , i 'd like to point attention to something else tpp can stand for . 
  the pirate party has [ some * incredible * policies ] ( http://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/platform#copyright ) regarding intellectual property . 
  is it wrong that i answered all of these completely `` rationally '' ? 
  calculated the expected gain/loss and went with the best outcome ? 
  the shirt one though ... it would * probably * cost just the difference in transport costs to get there , but i did n't actually bother calculating that one for sure . 
  but it certainly is a factor that will make a difference for some people , depending on their mode of transport . 
  the movie one i said yes , but not because of the sunk cost effect , but simply because i clearly already want to see the movie , so i 'm going to pay to see it . 
  anyway , this was interesting , and i 'm very interested to see the results , if you would n't mind pinging me when they 're out . 
  it was probably more a typo than anything else from / u/andoo . 
  but that 's why , if you do leave the g off in spelling , you should always add an apostrophe . 
  makes it clear that you were intendin ' it to be pronounced like that , rather than it being a typo . 
  that would be a valid potential answer . 
  it does n't make the question irrelevant , though . 
  it could be that he * was * forced to do it , or it could have been a purely artistic decision . 
  or anything else , who knows . 
  makes for a good question . 
  i honestly think i would have for most of them . 
  the ones where it 's a choice of doing a or b , at least . 
  the ones where it 's `` gamble with these odds or do n't gamble at all '' i probably just would n't gamble at all , even if the odds were in my favour . 
   the flash moves incredibly quickly, 
  for me i 'm very interested in them , just ... not yet . 
  looking at other technologies , like smartphones and tablets , there were enormous leaps in the tech between the first generation and the second or third generations . 
  so i 'll be waiting at least a few more years before i even take a serious look at them . 
  but i * do * love the idea of being able to see notifications and make short quick responses without needing to do more than glance at my wrist , or make a few quick taps . 
  that said , i do already have a garmin forerunner watch . 
  not a smartwatch per se , but it is a satellite watch that tracks my pace while running or cycling , and is light enough to double as a normal wristwatch at other times -- but without giving any other utility .

  [ haha no , not over just technical difficulties . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/33u8ac/experiencing_technical_issues_investigating/ ), 
   should we allow a technical failure to end the button ? 
  as much as i want to say yes , realistically , no . 
   what should we do for those who pressed and received flair during this period of technological capriciousness ? 
  let them keep it . 
  they earned it . 
  i do n't have an iphone , so i 'm obviously not going to be buying the watch . 
  but this argument is just stupid . 
  the potential for smart watches in general is pretty damn cool . 
  you underestimate the benefit of being able to just look at your watch to know if a particular notification is important enough to warrant an immediate response or not . 
  but more than that , you could potentially quickly respond with standard responses ( e.g. 
  `` on my way '' or `` ca n't respond now , in a meeting '' ) . 
  additionally the ability to do quick queries and get quick responses is awesome . 
  imagine if you 're having a conversation about the marvel cinematic universe , and you want to know `` who was it that played the villain in age of ultron ? '', 
  you could just say into your watch `` ultron actor '' , and the watch could simply reply `` james spader '' . 
  you would n't be reading the wikipedia article about spader on your watch , but using the google answer box ( [ here 's what you get in that example ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zxlfzpr.png ) ) for a quick bit of information is great . 
  i 'm certainly not getting anything this year -- i 'll probably wait at least two or three generations down the line , when the technology has developed a bit more , and i wo n't likely be getting the watch , i 'm more of an android guy . 
  but yeah , claiming that the only people to use it are `` too lazy to look at their phone '' is * enormously * misunderstanding the situation .
