  a smart watch could conceivably do that . 
  for other people , things like potentially being able to have others follow your run in real time could be a boon . 
  more likely , though , is that down the road smart watches will slowly replace dedicated gps watches entirely for most people . 
  they just need to improve so that they have more features and work well without pairing to a phone . 
  a less ambiguous way of stating what they wanted to get across would be `` the only situation in which i use two hands ( as opposed to one hand ) is when typing . '', 
   yeah , it 's called windows ~ ~ vista ~ ~,

   self-defense of your home is a common household activity, 
  man i do n't know where you live , but remind me not to go there . 
   we do n't have any studies showing that a gun led directly to deaths alone, 
  [ yes we do ] ( http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full ) . 
  having guns in the home results in an increase in deaths in a number of different ways . 
  from suicides , to accidental shootings , to escallating the issue in robery , to name a few . 
   a gun does not increase suicide risks , people decide to commit suicide , not the gun . 
  they could just as easily suicide with a knife or pills, 
  wrong again . 
  there are different kinds of suicides . 
  for some people , they decide to commit suicide after a long struggle with depression that they see no way out of . 
  there 's generally not much you can do to prevent these people from doing it . 
  however , for some people , it 's a more impulsive act in a fit of more temporary despair . 
  for these people , removing guns can have a dramatic positive impact . 
  shooting yourself is a much easier way to go and requires much less mental effort than something that you know will be painful like pills , hanging , or cutting yourself . ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hicrc/firearms-research/gun-ownership-and-use/ ) [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2013/12/gun_ownership_causes_higher_suicide_rates_study_shows.html ), 
  a similar example is with bridges . 
  [ overall suicide rates in the area decrease noticeably when bridges are equipped with anti-jump mechanisms . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_barrier#efficacy ) basically , being unable to immediately go through with the impulsive act will , in some cases , cause the person to decide not to commit suicide at all . 
  seriously lacking in the musical genre options here . 
  not one of the genres i usually listen to was an option . 
  jazz and classical are hardly obscure . 
  what the fuck is a credit hour ? 
  if under 5 minutes per k for over 10 km is leisurely jogging , then i proudly accept that that is what i am doing . 
  seriously , the only way to watch the last of us is with someone who just * does n't talk * . 
  ** at all ** . 
  there 's no need for that shit over such a good story . 
   the overwhelming answer was that yes , the flairs of those who pressed during that time should be reset to grey, 
  huh ? 
  that 's not the response i saw . 
  it looked to me like there was a pretty even split . 
  / u/godd2 already accounted for that , by adding the condition `` if pi is a normal number '' . 
  it is n't known for certain , but many people do believe pi to be a normal number . 
  this would mean that it does , by definition , contain every possible subsequence . 
   at most colleges, 
  perhaps in america that 's true , but different places use different systems . 
  if the information you want is `` how many hours per week do you spend in class '' , then that 's probably the question you should ask , rather than some cryptic wording that many people are n't going to understand . 
   legally allowed to be shot if they trespassed on your land up until 1992, 
  is n't that still the case in america , except for people of any race ? 
  one in brissie , too . 
  amusingly , it sits on the location of what used to be a texas-themed `` lone star '' restaurant . 
  do people really not know that ? 
  i mean ... that 's kinda the * point * of it . 
  even the most basic of high school maths classes should teach that . 
  ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ should ^ ^ ^ teach ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ratio ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ circumference ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ diameter . 
  ^ ^ ^ tau ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ much ^ ^ ^ easier ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ work ^ ^ ^ with . 
   what are the rules ? 
  generally , if you can , ride in bike lanes . 
  otherwise , stay over as far left as is safe . 
  note that `` as is safe '' : it 's important . 
  you should always stay outside the door range of parked cars , and do n't ride through stones and sticks on the side of the road just to stay out of cars ' ways . 
  if you 're riding with anyone , the two of you can ride side-by-side as long as there is at most 1.5 metres between you . 
  but at the same time , be respectful , if you 're doing that and it 's clearly holding up traffic , go single file for a while to let them pass . 
  a helmet is absolutely essential . 
  also , if you 're ever going to be riding in anything other than perfect daylight , you 'll need a white light and a red light . 
  probably a good idea to buy a decent u-lock , too , unless you 're always going to be parking somewhere you know it 'll be safe anyway ( like your own garage ) . 
  make sure to signal when turning right , and at roundabouts you * do n't * have to be in the right-hand lane when turning right . 
  otherwise , for the most part , rules are the same for you as for cars . 
   can i ride in footpaths in qld ? 
  yes !, 
  thankfully , we here do n't have the same shitty laws the other aussie states ( and many other places , e.g. 
  most us states ) that mean you ca n't do this . 
  but if you do ride on the footpath , i urge you to be extra careful of pedestrians , and also of the risk of cars pulling out of driveways and intersecting streets . 
  they wo n't be looking for you as carefully there as they would if you were on the road . 
  [ all the cycle laws in queensland can be seen here ] ( https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/nonpowered/bicycle/ ) . 
  additionally , it 's probably worth noting about [ these laws ] ( http://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/other/cyclists/ ) that apply to * drivers * as they concern cyclists . 
  basically , they must * always * give you at least 1 metre when passing . 
  1.5 metres if the speed limit is over 60 km/h . 
  it 's a great thing to do , and i wish you luck if you do end up getting a bike . 
   many motorists think if a bike can ride on the footpath they should , and many treat bikes this way, 
  that 's an education problem , and largely indicative of the general problem we have in this country of cyclists being treated like shit . 
   bikes on footpaths have way too large of a speed difference compared to pedestrians . 
  one could easily make the same argument regarding cars to bikes . 
  it 's a silly one . 
  especially since cyclists are accustomed to just going slowly until it 's safe to pass pedestrians ( unlike drivers ) . 
   most footpaths are n't wide enough to let 2 people pass much less a bike, 
  most of the ones that i ride on are . 
  having the * option * to cycle on a footpath does n't mean it 's always a good idea . 
  take [ this route ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/dir/st+lucia+qld,+australia/stafford+qld,+australia/@-27.4632539,153.0159778,16z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x6b915a09140a9515:0x502a35af3de9920!2m2!1d153.0065457!2d-27.5020447!3m4!1m2!1d153.007052!2d-27.4719695!3s0x6b9150a5946f2c41:0xa9d09814ee2df46e!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b915836a740c71d:0x502a35af3de9930!2m2!1d153.0110313!2d-27.4097974!3e1 ) , for example . 
  it 's one i often ride ( with start and end points obscured ) , and from lang park up until the bike path behind girls ' grammar i ride on the footpath . 
  it 's wide and tends to see very low foot traffic , while at the same time the roads there are often busy , and there are traffic lights on an uphill -- and i would rather avoid having to start on an uphill with traffic behind/beside me . 
  on the other hand , after i get across enoggera creek ( as well as the small bit just before it ) i stay on the road , because there the footpaths are n't a great option , and the road is much safer/easier to ride on . 
   footpaths have driveway intersections , street corners , etc. 
  again it depends on the route . 
  some places these are simply not an issue , because the corners make it easier to see anyone coming out ahead of time and react accordingly . 
  the cyclist should be allowed to make that determination for themself . 
  yeah exactly . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/33u9ze/normal_service_has_been_resumed/cqofgja ) is one such comment . 
  but unfortunately it looks like the thread has changed a lot from when i first saw it ( when it was really young ) . 
  back then it was much more evenly split . 
  i ca n't speak for most of europe , but i know through friends that britain does n't do this , and through experience that neither does australia . 
  both of these are certainly among the largest percentages of reddit 's viewership ( being [ third and fourth , respectively ] ( http://www.redditblog.com/2013/12/top-posts-of-2013-stats-and-snoo-years.html ) ) . 
  and a quick search suggests that europe uses a different system to america , as well , using something called ects .
