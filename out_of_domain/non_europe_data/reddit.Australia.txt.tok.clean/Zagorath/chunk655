   choosing to unleash your smite energy after a hit into a bolt that is 100 feet away makes you wonder why you ca n't just fire smites without the bolt, 
  this makes for an interesting idea . 
  what if you homeruled it so that paladins * can * smite on ranged attacks , but that in that case they have to choose to smite * before * the attack roll , rather than waiting till after you know it hit as is the case in melee ? 
  so , if i 'm in , say , australia , i can make it so i never connect to any servers not physically in australia ? 
  i 've tried it a few times under the current architecture , and the lag just makes it unplayable . 
  so , my networking knowledge is n't great , but this does n't seem like a good idea . 
  i 'd be worried that the fact that udp is an unreliable protocol could cause more problems than the comparatively small overhead would alleviate . 
  could n't the problem of out-of-order packets have some pretty serious effects in a game that requires such accurate and fine-tuned movement as tp ? 
  could be wrong though , my networking knowledge is n't great . 
  in fact , i 'm typing this as procrastination for a networking assignment at uni ... 
  oh fair enough . 
  thanks . 
  regarding true classical music , i ca n't think of any examples where i would compose it differently , but i have a number of opinions regarding performance practice . 
  beethoven symphony no. 5 i ca n't * stand * when they drag out those opening 4 notes . 
  the piece needs to be * allegro con brio * , fast and with energy . 
  you do n't get energy when you drag it out like it 's plodding along . 
  and i wholeheartedly agree with everything andras schiff has to say regarding the performance of beethoven 's piano sonata no. 14 `` moonlight '' in [ his lecture on the piece ] ( http://download.guardian.co.uk/sys-audio/arts/culture/2006/11/22/03_14csharpmin.mp3 ) . 
  especially so in the first movement , but also in the others . 
  similarly , i find what he has to say about the path\u00e9tique sonata ( especially regarding repeats ) very interesting , though i do n't really know where i stand on that matter . 
  not classical music per se , but in john williams ' score for the star wars prequels ( obviously very heavily classically-inspired soundtrack music ) , i would have been more sparing in my use of darth vader 's theme . 
  made it more exclusive to anakin 's darker actions ( it appears a few times largely unrelated to anakin himself ) , and also use it less . 
  only hint at it throughout the first two movies , and have the theme slowly grow and grow until it fully gets a powerful statement with full orchestra when vader dons the mask at the end of episode iii . 
  edit : whoops , thought i was in / r/askreddit , where the film music stuff might have been less out of place . 
  i 'll leave it in because i still think it interesting , but i 've edited to put it * after * the classical section . 
  [ schiff actually has lectures on every one of beethoven 's sonatas ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/music/classical/page/0,,1943867,00.html ) . 
  they 're really interesting and absolutely worth listening to , in my opinion . 
  do n't know of any on le sacre , though , unfortunately . 
  for questions 7 and 8 , my reasoning was that i do n't have a car , and so i would probably be taking public transport . 
  the round trip cost of going to the other store would probably come up to over $ 5 either way . 
  i wonder if you could speculate as to the reasoning for the outcome in questions 11/12 . 
  it certainly does seem unintuitive to me that the results would have come out the way they did . 
  that 30 % should n't be what valve personally takes , it should be the combined percentage of income taken by all parties other than the developer . 
  the industry standard is that the devs get a 70 % cut , and that 's how it should have been done here . 
  ( along with requirements that the mod be kept up to date and functioning for at least a certain period , lest they be forced to refund customers . ), 
  yeah i agree . 
  if mod devs got a fair cut ( give them 70 % and let the rest be split among valve and the game publisher ) , but are also required to meet a minimum threshold of performance , and keep it up to date -- lest they be forced to refund customers -- that seems fair to me . 
  still leave room for free mods to be fun projects by individuals that wo n't necessarily be kept up-to-date . 
  yeah , some real ted talks are shit . 
  but also some ted ^ x talks are really good . 
  on the whole , though , the reverse is true . 
  i thought that was n't part of the ring cycle ? 
  she played steel drums in the space club this episode , and also at the end of last episode , after jeff said it would `` pay off '' at the start of last episode . 
  you talking about the chatterbox from the title sequence ? 
  it looks to me like it 's working just fine . 
  only thing i 'm not sure about is the very end where it 's folder into a right angle isosceles triangle . 
  what does it do ? 
  oh right . 
  it works in singapore ? 
  i had assumed that the reason you said singapore was because they had some special message when they tell you that you ca n't access it . 
  why not set location to us ? 
  yeah it really is . 
  can you use `` penult '' in the same way ? 
  ( and also , can you say `` antepenultimate '' to talk about the third last thing when the `` thing '' is something other than syllables in a word ? ), 
   photo : reddit, 
  would n't `` photo : imgur '' be slightly more accurate ? 
   the men told another staff member who checked on them that everything was ok , and a few minutes later they were off . 
   if the vigil was a statement against the adult industry , it was not the first time such prayers were held outside an adult shop . 
  hmm ... if that second paragraph there is correct , do n't you think they 'd probably have said something when the staff asked them ? 
  maybe not though ... i do n't know how the fundy mind works . 
  tbh if i were i betting man , my money would be on / u/xenzor 's theory . 
  they probably just lost a bet . 
  plus nobody knew from the comics at the time . 
  the search did n't come out for at least a year after the first episode of korra . 
  and mary-jane watson/spiderman ( at least from the tobey maguire movies ) . 
  look forward to working in a ( hopefully ) green government with you . 
  i believe strongly that alignment exists only as a descriptive element . 
  its use as prescription is a massively outdated practice that i believe has had no place at tables for at least a decade . 
  i ban `` detect good/evil '' ( it 's probably the * only * thing aimed directly at players -- i.e. 
  the player 's handbook + player supplements -- that i explicitly ban ) . 
  it 's something that roughly describes how a character will act in general . 
  however , for various reasons , they may act against their alignment occasionally . 
  and , more importantly , that alignment can shift gradually as they interact with the rest of the party and the world at large . 
  this is good ; it 's character development . 
  paladins make an oath to uphold something specific . 
  something far more than just their alignment . 
  ideally , they should make a very specific oath and have that fit with the in-game oathes like `` oath of vengence '' , `` oath of devotion '' , etc. 
  they break their specific oath , and they fall . 
  for players less interested in building a character backstory , they would fall for going against a more general sense of what the mechanical oath they chose was . 
  i do believe that it 's still worth having alignment in some sense just for the purpose of giving a general overview of how players will act . 
  but you do n't really lose that much if you choose to get rid of it entirely . 
  only thing you lose is ease of communication . 
  well , really 6 different dice . 
  you just tend to get two d10s , one with an extra `` 0 '' marked on each face , so you can roll percentile dice . 
   d6 's ? 
  what am i ? 
  please . 
  firebolt does 1d10 damage at first level as a cantrip . 
  it 's like rolling 2d10 ( one marked in 10s ) , except in base 6 . 
  someone clearly needs to play more rpgs . 
  the numbers of any two opposite sides of a dn should add up to [ n +1 ] . 
  ( does n't work for the standard caltrop d4 , since the opposite side does n't exist ) . 
  this does n't seem like a very good method . 
  [ people are * really * bad at uniformly picking a random number ] ( / r/samplesize/comments / 2t8fr0/casual _ pick_a_random_number_between_1_and_10 / ) . 
  say n = 10 . 
  you 're going to get 4 -- 14 ( mod 4 ) a * lot * . 
  1 -- 7 +1 ( mod 4 ) -- and 8 -- 4 +4 -- are also going to be really popular . 
  also every word ending in `` ious '' . 
  they 're both d10s .
