  they can be really handy if you want to look up more information about something than is able to be shown in the original medium you saw it . 
  and proud of it . 
  age of consent is 16 or lower in most of the western world , including most us states . 
  mine does too . 
  the problem is the live interaction is important . 
  and also , while every lecture theatre is equipped with recording , the various smaller rooms used for tutorials , practicals , etc. , and those set aside for students to use outside of class time ( like for group projects , individual work , etc. 
  ) , are not . 
  14 , actually . 
  it 's also still creepy . 
  i never said it was n't . 
  my point was only that comparing it to 15/9 is unfair . 
  man , the animal in the picture looks so much more beautiful ( and a hell of a lot less evil ) than the australian magpie . 
   it 's no longer tied to skills, 
  but it is . . ? 
  it 's tied to more skills than constitution or strength are . 
  in fact , from memory , i think it has the * most * skills tied to it , tied with wisdom . 
  oh right . 
  they removed that dependency in 4e , so it 's nothing new . 
  but what he 's wondering is if the style changes as a result of the shorter length , or if they are simply shorter versions of exactly the same thing . 
  is that a word ? 
  yeah this is quite a well known quote , and it comes up here and there from time to time . 
  always worth resharing , though , because i think it really does touch on something important and accurate . 
  [ i quoted it once , and it has become my highest voted comment of all time ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2r63kg/what_grated_joke_always_cracks_you_up/cnd0j3t?context=3 ) . 
  that thread also spawned some very funny and interesting comments and other examples , etc. 
   other countries that have different populations, 
  very good point , but this is also extremely easy to adjust for . 
  literally just divide the number of deaths by the population of the country and get `` police-related deaths per capita '' . 
   different police regulations , different laws , different norms/values , different rules of engagement policies, 
  all irrelevant . 
  or rather , completely relevant , because * that 's the point * . 
  if one country is truly seeing significantly more policy-related deaths than another , then that is an indication that one or more of the above * needs to change * , because clearly there is something going wrong . 
   also ... your source is ... wikipedia, 
  oh fuck off with that . 
  you know as well as he does or i do that wikipedia articles , when properly sourced , are an extremely good source of information . 
  looking at these articles , they certainly seem to be . 
  now , that said , / u/shahhe has what might actually be a legitimate criticism of the information , so keeping a skeptical mind is a good thing . 
  it just has to be constructive , and not just saying `` oh , but we 're a different country with different culture . 
  and also wikipedia is bad . 
  '' , which is a complete cop out . 
  add up those three other populations and you get a little over half the us 's population . 
  add up the number of deaths , and you do n't even get 1/10th the number of deaths . 
  and also look at the year ranges . 
  the * smallest * of the other countries ' ranges is from 1967 to 2015 . 
  the us is only from * 2009 * . 
  but the thing is , the way humans interact with ages in normal conversation is exactly the same as how integer representations work . 
  the day before your 14th birthday , people will still call you 13 . 
  that said , for the purposes of the whole dating age thing , personally i would just use floating point ( or some other notation with room for non-integer values ) rather than integers . 
  no rounding necessary . 
  at least he used celsius not fahrenheit . 
  haha yeah , it is very interesting . 
  i had assumed that they got the name because they look similar , but seeing this photo ... they really do n't look that similar . 
  so i wonder why settlers named the australian bird after the eurasian magpie . 
  but anyway , regarding intelligence yeah i definitely agree , there 's definitely a sense that they 're very smart birds . 
  unfortunately my brief search did n't turn up any studies into the matter with them . 
  hopefully someone will see these studies and want to replicate them with the aussie bird . 
  as a side note , the first time i ever even found out that the australian magpie is unrelated to the eurasian one -- and to corvids in general -- was back when all the `` crow/jackdaw '' stuff was taking place . 
  so as bad as all that drama was , i managed to get some cool education out of it . 
  why you did n't remove the gag and throw it in there like a grenade is beyond me . 
  gouging out eyes seems over the top to me . 
  but break the right hand to force her to use her left ? 
  seems perfectly appropriate . 
  fourth year is n't last ... depending on state , it might be year 11 or year 10 , where year 12 is the last . 
  does primary school where you 're from go all the way up to year 8 ( or equivalent ) ? 
  here it goes to either year 6 or 7 from my experience , and then high school starts at year 7 or 8 . 
  bless you . 
  i did n't even know these were a thing . 
  i rarely visit the subreddit itself , so if a post does n't make my front page i wo n't see it . 
  not sure if there 's anything you can do about that to fix that , unless you were to put a link to it at the top of all the comments pages . 
  i did n't know what an ambigram was , so i just assumed it was one of those things where it looks like it can be two different things , like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k7nifai.png ) . 
  so i spent like 40 seconds looking at this trying to figure out the other meaning , before i actually went and looked up the word . 
  so yeah , that was stupid on my part . 
   a design that may be read as the same word ... when oriented in two different ways, 
  for anyone else who wants to know . 
  absolutely awesome writing , though , op . 
  oh right !, 
  this is votes in the actual parliament , yeah ? 
  not the votes that citizens make to choose who their representatives are ? 
  i was thinking how terrible an idea it is , but that was largely because i was confused about what this actually is . 
  what i do n't get is why some sites that use sha-1 have the [ red strike ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mj1yeyf.png ) , while others ( like reddit ) only have a [ yellow caution sign ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vjdppgo.png ) . 
  then , * still * others ( like [ google themselves ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iksnfxy.png ) ) appear perfectly [ fine and green ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3tqqzcm.png ) . 
  i think i heard something about it being to do with their expiry dates , though i 'm not really sure . 
  i might suggest vampire first primarily because it 'll give you the chance to play it , and then later play the witcher 1 and 2 , and potentially be able to run straight on from that to the witcher 3 if you decide you want to do that ( since it 'll almost certainly be out by then , unless you play through them * really * quickly ) . 
  can i get some screenshots of the new bookmark manager ? 
  mine 's looking no different to before at the moment ... ( running chrome beta channel . ), 
  on a related note : i miss wave and reader :(, 
  i 'm not entirely convinced . 
  we do the same thing with numbers that have nothing to do with time . 
  for example , if you have a phone number that starts 0410 , that would be read oh four one oh . 
  or australia 's emergency number sometimes being read as triple oh . 
  yeah , that definitely is a playing of it , though the timecode is a little out . 
  it actually starts at 17m37s , not 17m49s . 
  not that that 's your fault : they clearly put the wrong information in the description . 
  protip in the future , if you 're looking for a story , a good place to look would be [ our hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  this one 's in there , as are many of the others that people often come asking after . 
   `` three of five '' ( 4:57 ), 
  should n't that be ' `` three of five '' ( 5:03 ) ' ? 
  because it 's ' [ minute ] three of [ hour ] five ' ? 
  since when did `` of '' mean `` before '' ? 
  are you sure you are n't confusing it for `` off '' ? 
  you have the knowledge and will to go to the effort to use the correct \u00a9 and \u00ae symbols , but do n't bother using \u2122 ?
