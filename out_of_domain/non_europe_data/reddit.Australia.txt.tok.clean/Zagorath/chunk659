  b ) this post is n't whiny , it 's making a lighthearted joke . 
  self-deprecating humour , if you will . 
  to be honest , i find the way he 's doing it makes much more sense with the model 5e uses . 
  in 4e and previous you could be trained in both persuasion and intimidation , but have different scores in both . 
  but in 5e the only thing that matters is whether or not you 're proficient . 
  the number is always going to be either just your related attribute modifier , or that plus your proficiency bonus . 
  and considering the former can potentially change ( e.g. 
  intimidating through strength ) in some situations , it does n't make sense to me to write a fixed number in the skills section . 
  that 's a good point , actually . 
  but i think it 's worth noting that both alert and observant affect things that have a separate spot on the character sheet . 
  initiative , while it is generally a plain dexterity check , does n't have its place in the skills list , it has its own section . 
  and the observant feat only affects the * passive * perception and investigation , so it does n't affect the normal skill , but instead has its own separate part on the character sheet , as well . 
  and kiwis and the irish . 
  basically , any english speaker who is n't american . 
  as someone from a place where we use `` zed '' and `` soccer '' , i have to say , the `` zee '' pronunciation does make some sense . 
  all the other cadence points in the alphabet song rhyme `` g '' , `` p '' , `` v '' , and then `` zed '' . 
  not to mention there are so many other letters that also end in `` ee '' . 
  that said , i still say zed , because it 's what i was raised with , and there 's * something * about it that i like , though i do n't really know why . 
  as for soccer , there are just too many different types of football . 
  there 's soccer , gaelic football , aussie rules , gridiron , both the rugby codes , and even various forms of touch or semi-contact football . 
  the word football works well as an all-encompasing term , but i do n't think it should ever be used to refer to a specific sport except in very particular circumstances where context clearly points to one of them . 
  the was comparing the softball to a cricket ball in their mind . 
  yeah they did n't have cricket or touch , so i went with volleyball because of the sports on there it 's by far my favourite . 
  soft drink is the one true name . 
  also there was one answer that had `` pop '' and `` lemonade '' as different options . 
  i dunno what you have in your lemonade , but where i am , lemonade * is * a softdrink/pop/soda . 
  it 's the generic name for 7-up/sprite . 
  oh hey , did you know the tip of your tongue is more sensative to salty flavours than other parts of your mouth ? 
  yeah tagpro is what i was going to say , too . 
  really fun little browser-based game . 
  looks simple on the surface , but it 's actually surprisingly in-depth , with very finely tuned physics mechanics . 
  it 's a game that takes a minute to learn , but a lifetime to master , so to speak . 
  man , i took a brief look over that i thought it looked really cool . 
  then i looked at the `` other platforms '' option , since i use android , os x , and windows . 
  great to see that they have both of those desktop operating systems , but the lack of android support is a deal breaker for me . 
  need to be able to sync between my computers , phone , and tablet . 
  firefox is just so crap ( breaks redirecting , ctrl-tab does n't work on some pages , etc. , and the mobile app is even worse -- wo n't maintain history when i restart my phone ) , and chrome has been slowing down my desktop so much , and eating my laptop 's battery like crazy . 
  so i 'm definitely looking for a good alternative . 
  but vivaldi is n't it , for me . 
  apparently . 
  man , i do n't know what chrome these people are using though , or what firefox . 
  firefox is a total piece of shit . 
  it wo n't let me just go to my university 's student information page because it insists i click on some warning about redirects * every single * *** fucking *** * time * . 
  it breaks how ctrl-tab should work on many pages , including fucking youtube . 
  watching a video and want to ctrl-tab to go to another page ? 
  i 'm going to highlight the video instead . 
  its `` awesome bar '' is so not . 
  never mind that it wo n't automatically add sites you frequent , even adding a * custom * search engine * by hand * is a massive pain in the arse . 
  and command/ctrl clicking on things does n't always work as it should . 
  for example , if you click on something in your bookmarks bar , it opens it in a new tab ( as it should ) * and then focusses on it * . 
  no , holding command/ctrl is supposed to open it in the background . 
  and then there 's the mobile app . 
  the fucking thing wo n't let me keep my tabs open when my phone restarts , so i just lose all that stuff i had open . 
  sure , chrome is a memory hog , it destorys your battery on a laptop , and oh god it needs better tab management . 
  but its sync stuff works absolutely beautifully , and as an actual application it actually fucking works how a good browser should these days . 
  i just can not comprehend how anyone would choose firefox over chrome unless they 're one of those `` privacy '' nutjobs who also insists on using duck duck fucking go . 
  i do n't understand how anyone can use firefox . 
  it just does n't work properly . 
  i ca n't access one of my university 's main webpages without it warning me that it prevented a redirect * every fucking time * . 
  it breaks how ctrl-tab should work on some pages ( for example youtube ) . 
  its `` awesome '' bar is absolute ** shit ** compared to chrome 's . 
  it 's just awful . 
  as for google being an advertising company . 
  eh , so what ? 
  give me one * good * reason that should factor in to which browser i use one way or the other ? 
  yeah it really does . 
  as much as i hate it , i tend to use firefox when i expect to need a lot of battery life . 
  thankfully that is n't too often , as most of the time i 'm near a power plug . 
   only motorola phones come with chrome as the default browser, 
  so do all nexus phones . 
  and i have n't bought a new phone in a long time , but surely the standard on android now would be to use chrome ? 
  [ yeah , it really is n't an if ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/tvtropeswillruinyourlife ) . 
  well according to their front page they already have sync across devices in the works , which is awesome . 
  problem is that without availability on android ( and ios for users who are like me but use that platform instead ) it 's fairly limited in its utility . 
  but still , a quick google turned up a few forum entries , and there 's clearly a lot of interest in seeing vivaldi on mobile platforms , so hopefully it 'll come eventually . 
  i do n't have any beef with ddg itself . 
  it 's not as good as google , but it does a decent job for what it is . 
  i was mainly pointing out that the type of people who use it are probably the same type of people who have an irrational fear of anything google just because `` muh privacy '' , and therefore use firefox rather than the technically superior chrome for the same reason . 
  but anyway , i very much disagree with that 90 % thing . 
  for me , i want a browser that can actually * browse the fucking web * properly . 
  i do n't want it giving me warnings when i go to my university website ( if it did it the first time i visited it , but then allowed me to say `` ok just always fucking accept it '' would still be a shit bit of design , but it would at least be acceptable ) , or preventing me from ctrl-tabbing between tabs . 
  i also heavily use custom search engines with custem keywords , like `` r '' set to `` https://www.reddit.com/r/%s '' and `` wp '' set to `` http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s '' . 
  setting those up in firefox is extremely difficult , and it never just adds a search engine for you based on your usage ( i currently have kickass.to automatically registered and frequently use it ) . 
  and its mobile app , as i said , can not let me keep the same tabs open when the phone restarts . 
  that 's some really basic shit . 
  firefox just lacks really basic features necessary to have a smooth experience browsing the web . 
  being slightly faster is hardly any significant advantage , and making battery life 8 hours rather than 5 is something that 's of fairly limited utility to most people most of the time . 
  4e is n't like that , it had room for variability between skills . 
  you could be trained in both intimidation and persuasion but still have different scores in them , thanks to various different features you might have . 
  5e does n't have that . 
  if you 're proficient in two skills and both skills key off the same stat , then they have the same score . 
  so the only thing you ever really need to note is whether or not you 're proficient . 
  that 's a good point . 
  personally though , i 'd probably signal that by giving it a double tick or something . 
  i prefer to leave as much as possible unchanged . 
  if you write a number in there , you have to rub it out and write in the new number every time the stat it keys off increases , or whenever you proficiency bonus goes up . 
  you 're very unlikely to ever * lose * proficiency , so rubbing out the tick is unlikely to ever come up . 
  they do n't on d10s because they use a 0 rather than a 10 . 
  so they add up to 9 . 
  and they do n't on d4s because they do n't have an opposite side .
