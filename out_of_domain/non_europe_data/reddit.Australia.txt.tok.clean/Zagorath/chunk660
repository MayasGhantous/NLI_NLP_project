  every other die , if it 's properly designed , will obey the formula / u/itsame _ rapio showed . 
   and yes , i 'm going to keep trolling all the `` only in america hurr durr '' comments , so just keep 'em coming, 
  you are an arsehole . 
  but you 're actually not entirely wrong , anyway . 
  it 's * not * only in america . 
  in fact , it 's in most of the world . 
  britain is the exception here , not america . 
  canada , australia , new zealand , most of europe , and many countries in africa , asia , and latin america all have mother 's day on the second sunday of may . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mother%27s_day#dates_around_the_world ) . 
  yeah , our mother 's day is the same as america : second sunday of may . 
  yeah ireland and the uk celebrate `` mothering sunday '' on the fourth sunday of lent . 
  the us , canada , australia , new zealand , much of europe , and many countries in africa , asia , and latin america celebrate it on the second sunday of may . 
  [ but there are a multitude of other dates that get celebrated in various countries , too .

  weird . 
  all of my dice do . 
  one random cheap set from ebay . 
  two chessex sets from a local store , and the set that came with the 5e starter set . 
  the d6s , d8s , d12s , and d20s all follow that rule , and the d10s ( and the d10 * 10s ) add up to 9 ( or 90 ) . 
  no , best korea . 
  makes sense . 
  no , it 's a problem with firefox . 
  no other browser does the same shit . 
  not chrome , safari , or even fucking internet explorer . 
  as i said , if it let me just say `` allow always '' it would still be a shit feature , but at least an acceptable one , but it does n't even allow that . 
  ddg 's bangs are cool , but being able to do it in the browser itself is so much cooler . 
  you can set up your own custom ones , and it automatically adds more based on sites you visit . 
  plus , particularly for the latter set , next time you start typing it out , chrome suggests that you could press tab and immediately search the site . 
  really handy if that 's what you were going to do anyway -- saves you from having to visit it and then type in their on-site search bar -- but you also do n't have to have made a point to * decide * to use it . 
  the browser just suggests it for you , and if it 's helpful , you accept it . 
  people are much more likely to use something if it comes up in their natural use , rather than having to go out of their way to use it . 
  so , i 'm not american , and am thus not very familiar with your national anthem , but i actually thought this sounded pretty cool . 
  certainly not traditional , but i liked it . 
  though i will say it started out ... well , bad , to put it lightly . 
  and the grace note in bar 35 sounded like he was trying to imitate some of the decorations bagpipes add on to their melodies . 
  and not in a good way . 
  but what 's today got to do with that ? 
  ah right , that makes sense . 
  thanks . 
  sibelius is great . 
  so much easier to use than musescore or finale -- though there 's enough of a learning curve that if you 're already used to musescore it 'll take some getting used to . 
  it makes composing really , really easy , and has enough power in layout and complicated features that unless you 're doing really weird stuff with your composing ( [ graphical scores ] ( http://www.operasquad.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/graphicalscore.png ) and the like ) , it works perfectly . 
  that said , its developers got fired , and their replacements have done basically nothing since . 
  there 's a new programme in the works by steinberg . 
  since it 'll be the first brand new programme in over a decade ( musescore came out in 2008 , but was a fork of existing software . 
  sibelius and finale have been around longer . 
  ) , people are very excited about it . 
  it 'll be able to take the lessons learned by sibelius and finale and apply them using modern development techniques . 
  many of the former sibelius team are now working on this project . 
  [ here 's the development blog ] ( http://blog.steinberg.net/ ) . 
  it is n't out yet , and really we 're not sure how long it 'll be until it 's released , but it 's very much worth following . 
  oh that 's awesome . 
  i tried switching back to firefox late last year and i looked for the option to do that , but could n't find it . 
  surely they also ca n't spy on the us ? 
  or am i wrong about that ? 
  anyway , the people in each of those countries are doubtless being spied upon by someone . 
  i know in australia our government just recently passed laws requiring isps keep logs so that they can turn them over to the police ( without needing to go through the normal warrant process ) . 
  you jest , but the greater emoji support was one of the big things that pushed me other the edge late last year into looking at switching back to firefox . 
  it was n't the only thing : chrome 's heavy memory usage and the way it eats through battery life also helped . 
  ended up switching for a week or two before giving up and going back to chrome because of how crappy its address bar is , as well as a number of other frustrations . 
  and the noise for people currently listening to something else , or in an environment where noise would be a problem . 
  it 's firefox 's fucking fault for not just letting me use the web properly . 
  none of the other browsers do the same thing . 
  there 's no defending their shitty design decision . 
  it 's just a bad user experience . 
  if i was prevented from visiting a perfectly legitimate site the * first * time , but was at least allowed to say `` just always fucking remember this '' , it would still be crap design on firefox 's part , but it would at least be something i could get past . 
  but this ... this is just bullshit . 
  i have n't gotten the new bookmark manager for some reason ( and i 'm on the beta channel , so i would have thought i * should * have gotten it ages ago ... ) , but based on some screenshots i got shown in [ this thread ] ( / r/chrome/comments / 34mvjz/hate _ the_new_bookmarks_system_heres_how_to_get / ) you can switch it to a list mode . 
  once you do that , it 's actually better than what it was before ( or at least , it looks better to me based on the screenshots ) . 
  i do n't know how you go about switching it into list mode , unfortunately . 
  the problem is that the `` murica '' joke has been so overplayed that people are sick of it . 
  it 's not funny anymore to see americans talking about `` freedom '' and shit like that . 
  to be honest , it was never all that funny to begin with , imo . 
  [ this should help ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfjnahzapsc ) . 
  really simple explanation of the important rules of cricket , done in a fairly light-hearted and humorous way , and under 4 minutes . 
   the times are assumed to be est, 
  it would really be better if you 'd use utc so users anywhere in the world can easily work out the time , not just those in america . 
  you should really change that to be utc . 
  i have no idea what time american est is when compared to australian est ( never mind the fact that you just say `` est '' , when there are multiple time zones with that name ) . 
  but i do know how to adjust between my time zone and utc . 
  it makes it much easier for people anywhere in the world to communicate , since it 's a simple numerical calculation based on your own local time zone , rather than needing to figure out and remember your own local time * and * the time used on the subreddit . 
  hey so am i !, 
  similar experience , too . 
  i 've played some 4e and am currently dming 5e . 
  you should consider getting in touch with / u/jonwrona who made [ this spellbook ] ( / r/dnd/comments / 34mtyb/a _ 5th_edition_toolbox_i_made / ) , and see if you can get your stuff put in there -- especially if he does n't get permission from wizards to add stuff from the phb . 
  yeah i do n't really use emoji myself . 
  i tend to favour the basic text-based emoticons , 
  but at the time i made the ( temporary ) switch , i was coming across them quite frequently , and i wanted to be able to read what other people were writing . 
  that 's actually a really damn interesting theory . 
  one i never even thought of . 
  i personally never cared for reader 's social features . 
  i just liked it for its clean utilitarian interface to sorting and reading my favourite rss feeds .
