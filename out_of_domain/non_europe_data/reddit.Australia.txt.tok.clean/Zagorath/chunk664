  but using them in prose slows down reading time . 
  there 's really no reason to use them these days . 
  \\* [ second source ] ( http://hfs.sagepub.com/content/25/3/273.full.pdf ) , behind a paywall, 
  australia . 
  it 's good because it 's so much faster . 
  the others require 2 or even 3 strokes , lifting the pen between each , this one is a simple swish and flick . 
  [ i managed to find my state 's handwriting guide , here 's a table showing how the letters are formed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/arze85z.png ) . 
  yeah , but if you write it like that ( as opposed to being a proper crossbar like in my example ) it suffers the same problem you described of my style : it `` looks like a c that had a stroke '' . 
  also why the fuck would you link some shit that 's `` force_download '' . 
  just use imgur , or * something * that 'll let me view the image in the browser . 
  if the innocent people had had guns here , the knifeman would probably have ended up dead . 
  better than him killing half a dozen others , sure , but it 's something that should be avoided if at all possible . 
  a place where guns are rare means * nobody * ends up dead , which is the best scenario . 
  guns for self defence are * not * a good thing , overall . 
  if it helps , i thought it was obvious you were parodying people who actually believe that . 
  i do n't think anyone says it in that many words , but gun nuts sure will say things like `` if you ban guns , sure , gun crime will go down , but knife crime will just go up '' , or words to that effect . 
  i saw this in my rss feed , but i 'm glad you 've submitted it here yourself . 
  gives me the chance to ask my question . 
  what 's the implication here ? 
  is the second one meant to be a bdsm magazine ? 
  if so , i 'm not sure i get it . 
  i do n't know bdsm terminology , but it does n't * seem * that `` make your players beg for more '' makes sense in that context ... 
  in lmop there are cultists nearby that are trying to win the dragon 's favour , are n't there ? 
  if the players have n't killed them , the dragon could get them to move it for him , as a way to get in his good graces . 
  side note , are they getting it to move to cragmaw keep ? 
  because that is absolutely genius , if so . 
   and spell book features, 
  man , if they were to license / u/jonwrona 's tool that would be so awesome . 
  it 's so much better than the software that wizards had for 4e . 
  it just needs the complete spells . 
  it would save them the money/time developing their own version , which would probably end up being lower quality anyway . 
  ( or , even better , not license it , and just let him use all of their spells , but that seems less likely . ), 
  it bugs up frequently and the auto-preview is unreliable on non-imgur pages . 
  it was n't working for me at the time , so instead i clicked the link . 
  it 's working for me now , though . 
  usually just needs a page refresh when it does n't work properly . 
  oooh , let us know if they get back to you . 
  i * really * wish android let you just disable access to certain apis . 
  i hate the fact that if an app requests location access , or the ability to read my smses ( looking at you , * facebook * ) , i have no choice but to not install the app , or accept the permission . 
  if i could specifically say `` no , you do n't get access to that '' , or even if it had to ask on first use ( like they do on ios ) , that would be so much better . 
   i do n't think/hope this does n't include mystic arcanum spells, 
  yeah , it does n't . 
  it 's specifically worded to exclude those spells . 
   apparently australians write their ` g ' like a shitty big minus ` a ', 
  better than the '' [ big ` c ' with a kink in it ] ( https://i.imgur.com/xss1i7e.png ) '' that americans use , imo . 
  oh * i * do n't do a lot of snapchat . 
  lots of people i know do . 
  i basically only use it to receive pictures of the family cat from my sister who lives overseas . 
  yeah , the damn thing causes constant reboots . 
  that said , it may or may not just be because i have n't used it very much , but i do n't think i 've ever had a camera-induced reboot since updating to lollipop . 
  i do n't know if i 'd call it the * only * thing . 
  certainly it 's the only thing that matters to * me * , but there are plenty of reasons that someone else might want to use it . 
  two great comic shows . 
  i mean , i 'm sure the spinoff will also be great , but i 'm not going to say it * is * great until i 've seen it . 
  my new headcanon : kryptonite is an animate object . 
  it just gets up and moves around . 
  [ because it said so on the paper that she signed ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lxuknv8.png ) . 
  actually in many areas that * is * a valid defense . 
  in my state , normal age of consent is 16 , but if the defendant can prove :, 
   ( a ) the child was of or above the age of 14 years ; and, 
   ( b ) the accused person believed on reasonable grounds that the child was of or above the age of 16 years . 
  then that is a legal defense . 
  but also , i think many areas have laws specifically about power dynamics like teachers/students , stating that that is n't legal even if they * are * over the legal age . 
  it prevents the person in power from leveraging that power . 
  i think a lot of people just ca n't accept that he might be responsible for it . 
  they say `` oh , turnbull wanted to do the proper nbn , but he got stuck with that position by abbott so that people would n't like him , to safeguard abbott 's leadership . '', 
  does n't seem convincing to me , but that 's what some people have said . 
  i used to be a resident in vietnam , and before that , in korea . 
  we always still had to use the foreigner line at airports . 
  but on that note , does anyone know if lines at airports in the us have `` us or canadian citizen '' ? 
  or do canadians have to go through the same line as all other foreigners . 
  i ask because in australia , kiwis can go through the same line as aussies . 
  any word on superman ? 
  if he exists in the universe , i 'm really worried about how they 'll tie it in . 
  that is , unless he only starts appearing shortly after the finale of arrow s03 and flash s01 . 
  if he does n't exist , i am * super * pumped about this show being in the arrowverse . 
  if barry and ollie are her inspiration for becoming a superhero , that would be * awesome * . 
  but anyway , the article specifically said that berlanti had `` already gone on record '' . 
  that implies it 's something we * already * knew . 
  but we * did n't * know it already . 
  so i 'm wondering if this ew article is just mistaken on what information was already out there . 
  if they 're not mistaken , could someone provide a link to a more solid source where berlanti said it ? 
  yeah exactly . 
  that 's why i think either the `` famous cousin '' description actually is n't the official one ( and to be fair , i 'm not sure our source on that is 100 % reliable ) , or ew is mistaken in this article . 
  dunno which it is .

  edit : main point is , fundamentally , it is * not * confirmed , based purely on what this article says , at least , that supergirl will be in the same universe as the flash and arrow . 
  the problem with that is twofold . 
  one , there actually is a young wonderwoman , her name is wonder girl . 
  two , the backstories are significantly different . 
  the `` super '' people are kryptonians .
