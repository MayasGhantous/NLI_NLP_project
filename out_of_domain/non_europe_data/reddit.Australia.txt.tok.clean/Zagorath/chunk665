  the have a history involving the planet krypton , and they have a weakness to kryptonite . 
  the `` wonder '' people are amazons , with an association to the greek gods . 
  we already have that so-called official description of the show . 
  the one that describes supergirl as wanting to step out of the shadow of her `` famous cousin '' . 
  personally , i 'm skeptical that it actually is the official description , because i have n't seen it tied back to a source that i trusted 100 % , but it 's out there . 
  no , that was the arrow/the flash crossovers . 
   all dc tv show suck because they are not connected to their films, 
  do people actually say that ? 
  honestly i 've been saying the opposite . 
  the only movie we 've had out so far was extremely polarising . 
  personally i thought it was pretty terrible . 
  the tv shows are fantastic . 
  so i 'm really disappointed that they 're squandering what they 've got in these awesome shows by not incorporating them into the movie . 
  i think/hope they can do the same thing with the flash and arrow that normally they would do with superman . 
  but yeah , i 'm excited either way , but slightly more excited if they do it without superman . 
  any word on superman ? 
  if he exists in the universe , i 'm really worried about how they 'll tie it in . 
  that is , unless he only starts appearing shortly after the finale of arrow s03 and flash s01 . 
  if he does n't exist , i am * super * pumped about this show being in the arrowverse . 
  if barry and ollie are her inspiration for becoming a superhero , that would be * awesome * . 
  but anyway , the article specifically said that berlanti had `` already gone on record '' . 
  that implies it 's something we * already * knew . 
  but we * did n't * know it already . 
  so i 'm wondering if this ew article is just mistaken on what information was already out there . 
  if they 're not mistaken , could someone provide a link to a more solid source where berlanti said it ? 
  main point : this article does * not * confirm anything . 
  it 's specifically saying that we already knew this stuff , but we actually did n't . 
  i 've never really looked that seriously into rooting & roming because i 've never really come up against a feature that i felt i was missing . 
  i liked getting updates quickly ( on my nexus phone ) , and the features were just fine . 
  but you 've got me reconsidering that . 
  more substantial control over api access for apps would be great . 
  but probably not enough on its own . 
  what other extra features can you gain by going from vanilla to cm that might be worthwhile , if you do n't mind taking a little time to answer ? 
  he used parenthetical commas . 
  he could equally have used em dashes or brackets . 
  any of the three works here , but personally in this context i 'm more partial to the paranthetical commas . 
  brackets would be a close second , and the em dashes would n't work so well here , imo . 
  i think at least partly it 's to do with them wanting to treat the new system as completely new , to make it easier for new players to get in to the game . 
  phandelver was * perfect * for that , and perhaps they wanted the other campaigns to be similar in feel to it , at least at first . 
  i reckon it 's misreporting by ew . 
  grab an external battery , they 've way better than internal swappable ones . 
  means you can keep the phone in a case , you get a larger internal battery ( so it 'll last longer and therefore you 'll need to top it up less ) , and the external one can easily be enough for two or three more full charges . 
  agree regarding the microsd though . 
  i know google wants to push away from using them in favour of the cloud , but for some of us mobile data is too expensive for that to be a viable option , and the 16 gb in my phone is just not enough for any significant amount of music , movies , or games . 
  and the weird thing is that we already know the time stream in this world is n't deterministic . 
  thawne was able to create the flash 5 or so years early by travelling back in time and becoming wells . 
  either one works . 
  i 'm a big fan of the latter . 
  it 's so much more convenient than carrying around a spare battery and having to swap it out would be . 
  ( remove phone from case , shut it down , swap batteries , put back in case , turn it back on , vs. just plug in the thing . ), 
  i mean , either way you 're carrying * something * around with you , so it makes very little difference in that respect . 
  yeah that was the biggest factor for me when i said `` yes '' to question 3 . 
  the former . 
  since the alternative is carrying around an extra battery to swap in and out , there 's not really much penalty with regards to carrying extra shit , and you get the massive bonus of a * much * greater battery life than just a second internal battery , and the option of having it in a case that you prefer ( i use a case that doubles as a wallet , so i do n't carry a wallet around any more ) . 
  a ... zero lemon ? 
  i literally just search on ebay for `` nexus 4 wallet case '' and picked one i liked . 
  [ i think it 's this one ] ( http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/genuine-leather-full-size-cash-pocket-card-wallet-case-for-google-nexus-4-black-/271214428653?pt=lh_defaultdomain_15&amp;hash=item3f25a3c1ed ) . 
  pretty damn huge , but to me it 's worth it since it means i do n't need a wallet . 
  used to have one much more like [ this one ] ( http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/case-holder-for-lg-nexus-4-e960-magnetic-leather-wallet-stand-flip-cover-elegant-/191476431707?pt=lh_defaultdomain_15&amp;var=&amp;hash=item2c94e27b5b ) . 
  it was alright , but only being able to carry 4 cards ( i stuffed 2 into each of the holes ) was too limiting for me . 
  has the advantage of being much skinnier . 
  only way it works is if he enters the `` fly around in blue tights '' stage right after the flash s01 arrow s03 finale . 
  that way he 'll have had a couple of months of fame for supergirl to be in the shadow before the show actually starts . 
   on a professional level , he almost ripped apple apart in the 90s by trying to isolate whole parts of the company from itself . 
  umm ... he got kicked out in 1984 . 
  did n't come back until the mid-to-late 90s , at which point he saved the company from bankruptcy ( with some help from microsoft ) . 
  there sure is a lot to hate about steve jobs , but none of it relates to his actual ability to manage a business to get successful results , because at that he was exceedingly good . 
  hell i 'd be happy ( at least on the desktop ) for it to auto-download , run the checksum , and then delete duplicates if necessary . 
  i 'd like to pose an alternate view , if you would . 
  rather than letting university be completely free , and therefore 100 % taxpayer funded ( which i agree is a very good idea , mind you , it 's just hard for many people to swallow , and is * extremely * expensive ) , regulate the prices so that they are reasonable , and give out loans at 0 interest -- just index it to inflation . 
  that 's how we have it here in australia . 
  i currently pay around $ 8,000 per year ( around $ 1,000 per course , four courses per semester , two semesters per year ) . 
  for students who are n't able to pay it upfront , the government gives out loans at zero interest . 
  additionally , they do n't have to be paid back until the student is earning over a certain threshold , at which point it automatically starts coming out of some of their income . 
  it 's not * as * ideal as fully free university , but it is in many ways a more manageable system , and certainly would be much more achievable in the political climate of the us . 
  and his work with pixar and john lasseter . 
  it 's funny , i have absolutely loved the whole season except for the last episode . 
  yeah the character development was n't there , but the actual stories themselves were brilliant . 
  but the latest episode just thoroughly failed to deliver on what the first 5 minutes promised , and that was really disappointing , because it promised to be such an awesome episode . 
  i do n't even think it 's by far the worst season . 
  i rate it higher than season 5 , and i know i 'm not the only one . 
  for me it 's 3  2  1  4  5 . 
  at this rate i 'm thinking 3  2  6  1 , but that could slide up or down one depending on how the rest of the season plays out . 
  good point . 
  maybe set a limit ? 
  do n't bother with it on files larger than , say , 32 mb . 
  it 's low enough that anyone with a serious job/career will be over it . 
  but high enough that it you 're barely making end 's meat , you wo n't be paying it . 
  i thought 1812 or `` one of his ballets '' ( was the exact wording in my mind ) . 
  though swan lake would 've been the first ballet i 'd call `` his masterpiece '' . 
  yeah in brisbane my usual ping to melbourne is 50 -- 65 ms. 
  oh man , the badman series us just brilliant !, 
  probably my favourite series to have been on collegehumor . 
  i 'll start !, 
  * they both have dragons . 
  yeah +2 is an immense bonus !,
