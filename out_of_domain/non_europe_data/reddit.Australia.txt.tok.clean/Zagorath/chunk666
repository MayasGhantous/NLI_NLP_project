  the way i got my subreddit ( / r/dndgreentext ) to grow was by posting a hell of a lot of really high quality content to it ( there was a * hell * of a lot of stuff out there , and i trawled through it to find only what i thought was the cr\u00eame de la cr\u00eame , which i submitted ) , and then going in to related subreddits ( in my case , / r/dnd , / r/dndnext , and / r/dungeonsanddragons ) and mentioning it any time something came up that looked like it 's related . 
  i tried to submit exactly one post per day at roughly what i thought was the optimal time for people to see . 
  now it 's a relatively small but active community that survives on its own . 
  ( although , in my opinion , the quality of posts has decreased from when i was trying to only submit the very best stuff . ), 
  with your subreddits , i 'm sure something similar would be possible . 
  / r/imonthefence could have opportunity to be mentioned in places like / r/changemyview , and / r/noexplanation is something that you could mention regularly on comments in heaps of places , including / r/nosleep-type stories , and various comments in / r/askreddit posts . 
  we also need to decide how exactly referendums work . 
  it is my understanding that in the real world , for something to go to referendum , it first has to pass both houses like a normal bill . 
  then , it goes to referendum , where it must get a `` yes '' vote in :, 
  * a majority of all votes , ** and **, 
  * a majority of votes in a majority of states, 
  the question for us is , do we think it worth following that model , or would it be better ( given the scale ) to just say that to pass a referendum , it must pass a majority of votes . 
  my phone always goes in my right front pocket , my keys in my left . 
  putting it in the back pocket sounds terrible :\\ i 'd be afraid of constantly sitting on it . 
  my phone case doubles as a wallet , so i do n't carry a wallet around . 
  i also tend to use my phone in my right hand , if that makes any difference . 
  yeah i 'm exactly the same , except without the wallet ( phone case doubles as one ) or sunnies . 
  random stuff goes in one of the back pockets , or in mid-thigh pockets in some of my shorts . 
  the general guideline for safe drinking is for men , 2 standard drinks in the first hour , and one every hour after that . 
  for women , 1 standard drink per hour . 
  it 's only a rough guideline , though . 
  * [ a point about katanas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlwzh_1ezsc ) . 
  * [ and a whole bunch more points ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yzdb98mqnk ) . 
  tl ; dw : katanas are not these magical weapons that were enormously better than swords in india , the middle-east , or europe . 
  and weabos need to shut the fuck up about them . 
  one of them has a katana in it , and weabos wan na take any chance they can to shout about how awesome their obsession is . 
  i switch them around , but generally default to my left ear . 
  i 'm also more likely to be at a mouse and keyboard than pen and paper , though . 
  oh hahaha fair enough ... you probably shoulda made that clear at the end or something . 
  well , anyway , the videos are worth watching . 
  entertaining and educational . 
  a weabo is a derogatory term for a westerner who obsessed with japanese culture . 
  they make comments like the one i replied to about how japanese things ( in this case the katana ) are vastly superior to their western equivalents . 
  another common example would be with anime . 
  they 'll get super offended if you say that they 're watching `` cartoons '' , and will talk about how anime is clearly superior to western cartoons . 
  most often these weabos do n't even really know all that much about the culture , they only know the very basic surface of it , and from that , they get obsessed . 
  tl ; dr , no need to be offended , 
  in america ( and the uk , canada , and australia -- if you count the `` two party preferred '' only , since australia has preferential voting ) it would be possible for a party to win a majority in the lower house ( thus becoming the governing party in the three commonwealth countries i mentioned , and becoming the house majority in the us ) with just a touch over 25 % of the population voting for them . 
  get a little over half the people in a half + 1 of the seats available . 
  of course it 's never actually going to play out in this extreme way , but it does demonstrate the problem pretty nicely , i think . 
  it 's true that av is n't proportional , but it actually does come from what is ( imo ) the best proportional system . 
  alternative vote is basically the special case of single transferable vote where the number of seats available is 1 . 
  [ this video here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) is john cleese explaining stv , one particular type of proportional representation . 
  only reason i 'm mentioning this here is because electoral theory interests me . 
  it certainly does n't change the fact that av is not proportional . 
  you 'd basically merge a few local seats together into groups of 4 or 5 . 
  [ here 's a really good explanation of how it would work in the uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) . 
  the exact same principle would work for canada , the us , or australia 's lower houses . 
  the basic thing is that you 'd end up having 4 or 5 local members . 
  a much greater chance that there 'll be someone who represents you that you can agree with ( and probably at least one that you disagree with , and probably one or two that are on the fence , and who you might be able to get to change their votes in parliament by writing to them ) . 
  the problem with mmp is that it puts party lists in power , and not actual voters . 
  to me that 's an absolutely horrible outcome and should be avoided at all costs , even if it means choosing a system that is slightly less proportional . 
  oh god no . 
  they 're horrible systems . 
  they put the party in power with regards to who gets elected . 
  i mean , sure , they 're still better than fptp , but what is n't ? 
  no , the people that sit in parliament should be voted for by the people , not chosen by backroom dealings within the party room . 
  yeah , australian states elect 6 senators each election ( they have 12 total , half getting elected each time ) . 
  the terrestrial territories ( the act and nt ) each elect 1 each time ( so they each have 2 in total ) . 
  no , because mmp ends up choosing mps based on who the * party * decides , in its own behind-the-scenes dealing . 
  the actual voters do n't get to vote for the candidates that they want sitting in parliament . 
  it is , of course , miles better than fptp , but it 's a step down from electing 4 -- 5 local members using stv , in my opinion . 
  eh , mmp is better than fptp , by a long way . 
  but the problem with it is that the parties get to choose who gets elected . 
  the choose the order in which the people not elected to a specific seat get added back in . 
  this means that the decision of who gets in to parliament is taken out of the voters ' hands , and put into the hands of the party room . 
  stv as used in ireland , australia 's senate ( just remove the gvt system , which is awful ) , and [ this john cleese video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) , is a much better choice , in my opinion . 
  this is a common myth , but germany 's government is * usually * formed by coalition , and it seems to be functioning pretty damn well . 
  and australia 's gillard government ( 2010 -- 2013 , from memory ) was also a minority government , and yet it managed to pass a huge number of pieces of legislation , many of them extremely significant . 
  what actually happens in minority/coalition governments is that parties have to compromise , and the end result is usually * better * governance . 
  no one party can force through an extremist agenda . 
   plurality is by far the stupidest method , however , if you want to piss off the fewest people, 
  seriously . 
  it fucking astonishes me that * anyone , anywhere * *** ever *** still uses first past the post in this day and age . 
  there is literally ** no ** situation in which it is a good idea . 
  for serious elections like this , alternative vote is only a tiny step up in difficulty , and it is * so * much better . 
  not nearly as good as a proportional system , of course , but still . 
  and even for casual votes among small groups ( my thoughts go to my [ residential college ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/residential_college ) 's elections for executive committee and general committee members ) , it 's stupid that fptp is used . 
  approval voting is literally the same thing , but you just add on `` oh , and you can vote for as many people as you want '' . 
  so damn simple , but creates a significantly better result . 
  are `` egyptian brackets '' this :, 
  for ( stuff ), 
  stuff ( ) ;, 
  or this :, 
  for ( stuff ), 
  stuff ( ) ;, 
  because the former is a damn nuisance , but is at least kinda okay . 
  the latter is just fucking horrible . 
   which braces do you use ? 
  do n't tell me if you 're one of those people that does, 
   } else {, 
   though . 
  i just ate and want to keep it down .
