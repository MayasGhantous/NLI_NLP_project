  in return , it would grant lucy that which she most wanted , magic . 
  the girl could n't resist the creature 's bargain . 
  she accepted wholeheartedly smiling as she said the words to make the pact . 
  lucy had just become a witch , and now her life was going to change . 
  she knew that , and she was very excited . 
  but as lucy got ready to go on her mission , as she geared up to become the hero she wanted to be , the devil trapped within the book laughed . 
  it was an archdevil by the name of jezebel , who had been sealed away since ancient days . 
  she had managed to kill that meddling wizard , the one who was finally about to destroy her . 
  it had taken most of her power to do that , but thankfully lucy had rescued her . 
  the girl was perfect , gullible and filled with magical potential . 
  she did n't even notice how jezebel was slowly filling her with devilish energy , how she was trying to turn the girl into the perfect servant . 
  for now , jezebel would bide her time , but eventually , she knew that lucy would free her , corrupted by magic into becoming a powerful devil . 
  and then , the creatures that sealed her away , the devils who had betrayed her , they would pay . 
  as the levels go by : lucy would initially appear completely human , but as she gains more levels she would become more and more corrupted by the demonic energy . 
  it would start with simple things , like eye colors changing or a few bits of hair darkening . 
  by mid level she would look more like a tiefling , her skin reddening and her horns apparent . 
  by the end she would look completely devilish . 
  whether she can resist the fiendish influence on her mind is up to fate , and her will . 
  and there i was just thinking it was talking about timpani ... 
  i 'm not sure i get the reference . 
  yeah , i feel like a lot of people may have missed that wording . 
   *** finesse . 
  *** when making an attack with a finesse weapon , you use * your choice of your strength or dexterity modifier * for the attack and damage rolls . 
  you must use the same modifier for both rolls . 
  also worth noting that weapons with the `` thrown '' property essentially come in three types . 
  melee weapons ( e.g. 
  the handaxe , the spear ) , which * must * use strength ; finesse weapons ( e.g. 
  the dagger or dart ) , which can choose to use either dexterity or strength ; and purely thrown weapons ( only example at the moment is the net ) . 
  oh my god that is brilliant . 
  make lucy 12 instead of 16 , and have the pact of the chain instead of pact of the tome ( with the bear being the familiar ) , and that 's actually really cool .

  oh that 's good to know .

  oh god do n't get me started . 
  i visited literally every store in brisbane listed on wizard 's page as selling dnd . 
  every single one of them sells the books for between $ 59.95 and $ 60.00 . 
  and fucking amazon just refuses to have any worthwhile variety of stock , so they 're as useful as a pile of shit -- and that 's not just for this specific case , that 's in general . 
  it 's not even worth looking at amazon if you want anything other than a kindle or ebooks . 
  managed to find some online stores that sell things cheaper , plus i managed to get a 10 % discount for borrowing a friend 's racq account . 
  that was nice . 
  but then even that company is shit . 
  bought it during a heavy site-wide sale , so they said it would take 1 -- 2 weeks before they ship it out . 
  i thought that was fine , so i went ahead with it . 
  6 weeks later the books finally turn up , after a number of emails where i asked them when they 'd ship the books , and they answered essentially `` in the next couple of days '' . 
  edit : just had a look at the actual sale . 
  turns out that even with the ridiculous $ 42.50 shipping charge , these would 've been cheaper than buying from the online stores i did here . 
  $ 167.20 for the three core books , dm screen , and starter set . 
  would be a really good damn deal if i had n't already bought them . 
  not likely , they only released 5.0 around this time last year , and they 've said that they want to keep it around for a long time . 
  i think amazon has a * lot * of things on sale -- possibly for mother 's day ? 
  this subreddit will get shitty in the off season . 
  it is inevitable . 
  it is unavoidable . 
  yeah i 'm confused . 
  i have no idea who ritual guy is . 
  fibre nbn , or the wireless coverage that was also a part of the nbn for remote areas ? 
  the trick to using that offpeak stuff , if you 're someone that does n't stay up at those hours , is to schedule downloads . 
  most torrent clients have scheduling options where you can tell them to only download at certain times , for example . 
  unfortunately for that theory , it was his left arm that caught greyscale . 
  i 'd take brisbane 's public transport over that of saigon ( where i used to live ) any day . 
  but that 's probably not a fair comparison , what with it being a much poorer country . 
  but also , not from personal experience , what i 've heard from americans on reddit is that in most cities over there , public transport does n't exist or might as well not exist . 
  what we 've got here is a damn good service . 
  sure , it could be cheaper , and it 'd be nice if some buses ran later ( especially from the city on weekends ) , but on the whole it 's really damn good . 
  the first thing i did when i finished chuck was watch everything related to it . 
  all the interviews , panels , behind the scenes stuff , and the web shorts they made ( i 'm on mobile and ca n't look it up , but the details are on wikipedia ) . 
  there 's an enormous amount of the stuff out there . 
  not exactly true . 
  laws sit in this weird place where they can be either analogue * or * binary . 
  if a party has a majority , for example , it can pass whatever it wants , no compromise necessary . 
  that makes it entirely binary . 
  in other cases , a minority may be able to make deals with other parties to get one piece of legislation through in exchange for supporting other legislation on unrelated issues ( ones that matter to the other parties ) . 
  that 's essentially creating the same scenario as above . 
  and then finally , if that does n't work , they may have to compromise on the details of the bill , creating a more analogue scenario . 
   the system means people are represented by a local person they voted for , not someone in another country - that would be dumb . 
  av , the system we use in australia for our lower house , is entirely local representation . 
  it 's not proportional , but is still a thousand times better than first past the post . 
  it just let 's you preference your votes so that in each seat , the winner is guaranteed at least 50 % of the total votes . 
  even better is stv , which is what we use for our upper house , and what your neighbours in ireland use in both houses , i believe . 
  it gives you local representatives , but from a larger area . 
  you get 4 -- 6 representatives fly essentially merging 4 -- 6 seats . 
  and this * is * a proportional system . 
  so you end up with a much more proportional result , but get to maintain local representation . 
  perfect outcome .
