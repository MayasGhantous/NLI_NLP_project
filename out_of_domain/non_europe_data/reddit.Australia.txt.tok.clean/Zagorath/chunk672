  i am absolutely * astonished * at how terribly democracy works in the united kingdom . 
  no democratic upper house , pure first past the post voting , and actually getting to the polls to vote is hard ? 
  that is just * horrible * . 
  it makes me so much happier with the system we have in australia ( despite all the flaws in the system , especially regarding gvts ) where registering to vote is extremely easy ( you can do it online at any time ) , and you can vote at literally any polling booth in the country ( or at least state , i 'm not sure how inter-state voting works ) , though it 's generally a bit easier to vote at one of the ( many ) booths in your own electorate . 
  agree with you completely brady regarding the guy in the polling booth . 
  that is totally * not * on . 
  i actually saw some people complaining about the same thing in / r/unitedkingdom , actually . 
  you absolutely did the right thing by getting him removed . 
  regarding voting systems , personally i 'm a big fan of stv by merging electorates in the current system . 
  the way described by [ john cleese in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) . 
  the best of both local members and proportionality ( and also no formalised political parties in the system ) . 
  brady , regarding your aversion to compromise and coalition , just look at germany ( and indeed a lot of europe ) , where coalitions are basically the norm . 
  heck , look at * australia * , your own country , under the gillard government . 
  there was a lot that went wrong during those years , but * passing good legislation * was not it . 
  labor had to coalition with the greens and independents , and yet an enormous amount of legislation ended up getting through , on a * lot * of controversial areas . 
  note i 'm not trying to say whether or not i support any particular party . 
  just that from an objective point of view , the fact that it was a coalition had basically no negative effect on it . 
  any negative effect someone might or might not perceive as having happened in that era was because of other effects . 
  nah i agree too . 
  i 'd * like * to have stv like cleese described in that video for our house of representatives , but what we have now is nice . 
  the only thing that desperately needs changing is the gvt system in the senate that caused the motoring party to get a seat despite winning only 0.51 % of votes in its state . 
  that 's a problem that would be so easy to fix , but oh well . 
  i still think our system is pretty damn good . 
  in addition to the compulsory voting , having * two * democratic houses , and the ease of voting in general . 
  got ta say guys , i absolutely loved this podcast . 
  all the politics were fantastic to listen to . 
  and that you managed to do it without really making you actual political views known was incredible . 
  must say that knowing that grey would have voted in some strategic way that has nothing to do with the policies of the parties * really * makes me want to know what that would have been . 
  but i totally understand his desire not to share . 
  i think it 's more to do with communication over really long distances in a time where such communication would take a long time . 
  i just thought his interacting with the flash in this show has been so brilliant . 
  to be so damn * cold * ( and i honestly would have used that word even without the delicious pun ) in his desires and actions just made his such a fantastic villain . 
  i ca n't help but feel he 'll be weaker if they make him more of an anti-hero . 
  even the death or resignation of a president does n't . 
  heck , even if both the president and vice president die , someone else takes over without an election . 
  in fact , the [ presidential succession ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_line_of_succession#current_order ) is really long and complicated ( and interesting !, 
  ) , though it 's never actually gone any further than the vice president , as far as i 'm aware . 
  that could only happen in the uk if lords was being uncooperative though , could n't it ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure how all that works in the uk . 
  how likely is it that lords would support a no confidence vote , or refuse to pass supply ? 
  ( genuine question , not rhetorical . ), 
  actually i 'm pretty sure from interviews etc. 
  they 've said that they really do try to get people to content that they want . 
  i think you 're right , it 's something that exists mainly for the customer 's benefit . 
  but i think that for them that is also a business decision , so it works both ways . 
  people who do n't have anything to watch are much more likely to unsubscribe , after all . 
  and with that much choice out there ( at least in the us -- not quite so much choice here in aus ) , it would be easy for someone to become paralysed by choice , which could actually potentially be a negative for netflix . 
  doubt it . 
  youtube 's number one concern as a business is watch time . 
  they want people watching youtube as long as possible . 
  if they thought letting people thumbs up and thumbs down videos that they do or do n't want would help with that , it 'd be available to everyone . 
  yeah this is my biggest problem with the system . 
  really wish we had above the line preferencing . 
  and optional preferencing , while we 're at it ... would fix * so * many problems with our senate system . 
  ( though i would point out that in the podcast , you kinda implied it was our alternative vote system that had a problem . 
  i 'm sure you knew that was n't the case and just abbreviated it because there was really no need to go into more detail , but for anyone reading this , our * senate * uses a bungled version * of stv * . 
  our house of representatives uses av and it works just fine -- for what av is , at least . ), 
  yeah , i have to agree with mr redshirt for the most part , to be honest . 
  episode i was pretty terrible . 
  episode ii had a lot of terrible moments ( i do n't like sand ) , but i liked it on the whole . 
  ( largely because , imo as a bit of a film music geek , i think it has the best music of the series . ), 
  and episode iii was just great . 
  that said , i honestly think i like the prequels more for what they were * trying * to be than for what they are . 
  they * could * have been an absolutely incredible tale of a fall from grace from an innocent and promising young boy into the most powerful and ruthless evil in the galaxy . 
  and i 've only seen them a small handful of times ( probably 3 , 1 , and 2 times for episodes i , ii , and iii respectively ) , so my image of what they * could * have been is stronger than my image of what they actually * are * . 
  i have n't watched any of them since i came to this realisation because i really do n't want to spoil it ... 
  agree , he 's my absolute favourite on computerphile . 
  ( and his own channel is great , too . ), 
  step 3 : get kicked out of said exam . 
  step 4 : receive zero on said exam . 
  step 5 : fail course . 
  yay !, 
  target in australia ( largely though not completely unrelated to target in america -- the relationship is weird and not important here ) recently ran some ads where they got some fancy designer in saying it 's pronounced `` tar-zhey '' ( with the '' [ / \u0292 / ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/help:ipa_for_french ) '' sound ) . 
  really fucking pretentious . 
  [ here 's one of those ads ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pflrmm_kp1u ) ( possibly nsfw if it 's a really strict work ? ) . 
  edit : here are a couple that do n't have the rest of the ad in them , just the end ( completely sfw , as far as any video watching goes ) :, 
  * [ one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zla6e7p7r7k ), 
  * [ two ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gt0z5xv2-2i ), 
  can i ask what exactly you mean by `` ra-xel '' ? 
  because `` x '' can be pronounced in a lot of different ways . 
  is it an x like `` box '' ? 
  perhaps an x like the chinese `` xiaomi '' ? 
  or perhaps something else ? 
  on another note , i 'm really surprised this would be taken down on those other subreddits . 
  did they give a reason for it , by any chance ? 
  i find `` k-roger '' absolutely hilarious , for some reason . 
  for clarification , is the actual kroger ( it 's not a company i 've ever heard of ) meant to be pronounced with a soft or a hard g ? 
  ( because if it 's meant to be a hard g : ( a ) fuck them for having a hard g between two vowels , especially with the latter being an e , that 's not how the language fucking works : use two gs if you want that name , and ( b ) that makes the mispronunciation even funnier . ), 
   see shardmind , looks cool, 
   see psion , seems cool, 
  awesome !, 
  that was my first character , too !, 
  but that ending was brilliant . 
  haha thanks for the link . 
  i do n't know whether to be happy about the name being pronounced like that because it makes the joke funnier , or annoyed at their ineptitude at the english language . 
  i think i 'll probably do neither and just complain about the awful kerning in that video . 
  it nearly looks like it says gumey . 
  hmm ... guess youtube must be a/b testing or something then . 
  i just hope they do n't start doing that to me :\\, 
  are there any prominent examples of internetwork crossovers ?
