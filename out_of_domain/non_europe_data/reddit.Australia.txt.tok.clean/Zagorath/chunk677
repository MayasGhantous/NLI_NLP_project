  90 % of the time it 's more than enough resolution . 
  the only time it ever really bothers me is when some web player decides that it 's going to be so loud that even at a volume of 1 , it 's still too loud . 
  of course , i could just change the volume in their web player , but who wants to do that . 
  i 'm confused . 
  what happened to his no killing rule ? 
  [ you ca n't tell me you do n't find this hot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odgu_-rr1x8 ) . 
  ca n't wait to see the results !, 
  when you do post them , i would just caution you ** not ** to use the word `` random '' . 
  or rather , not to equate a non-uniform result with being non-random . 
  because they are n't of course , the same thing . 
  edit : so i can remember : 3-44-1-102, 
  okay , now put those keys back in the right way . 
  seriously , it 's best to learn dvorak on a normal keyboard , with the keys arranged for qwerty/qwertz/azerty . 
  the biggest reason for this is that the bumps on the f and j ( or u and h ) are essential for easily lining up your hand , and also because of the slight angling that you get in good quality keyboards . 
  but there 's more than just that . 
  having the keys your fingers are pressing * not * be the same as the letters you are typing helps you learn to touch type better . 
  i know that for me , while i could more or less touch-type qwerty before , i still glanced down at my hands from time to time as an aid , and this was an inefficiency . 
  since switching to dvorak , i can literally type with my eyes closed and see no real deterioration in my typing speed whatsoever . 
  because of this , i would say not only should you not rearrange the key caps , i would also recommend against buying stickers to put on the keys . 
  my suggestion would be to print out a copy of the keyboard layout and stick it under your monitor . 
  yeah personally as a dm i would say each mage can decide how they personally want their mage armour to look . 
  maybe this wizard wants it to look how yours does , while that sorcerer wants it to look like completely normal armour , and the warlock wants it to appear as a constant glowy magic armour . 
  and maybe the arcane trickster rogue who picked it up at level 8 decides he wants it to have no visible effect at all : they just somehow do n't get hurt . 
  but if a player had n't put thought into how they want theirs to look , and for ( most of ) my npcs , i 'd probably describe it exactly how you do . 
  edit : added rogue, 
  that takes a lot more effort than just clicking in the bar ( which automatically selects the whole thing ) , hitting the shortcut for copy , and hitting the shortcut for paste back in the reddit comment box . 
  personally i would have gone to the effort of making it a proper / r / link , because it means people browsing on alternate subdomains of reddit stay on their preferred subdomain ( for example if they speak german and are on de.reddit.com , or they 're browsing the mobile website on m.reddit.com ) . 
  but i can at least see why not everyone would go to the effort to do that . 
  i 'm also worried about what i 'm gon na do when it comes time to replace my 2012 non-retina 15 '' . 
  the lack of discrete graphics at anything resembling a reasonable price is disappointing to me . 
  i ca n't comment from experience , having never touched a computer with force touch . 
  but if the advice to get a good experience is to tap rather than press , that seems to me like i probably would be very disappointed by it . 
  i 've turned off the option to tap to press on all the macbooks i 've had to date , because accidentally pressing when i 'm just touching the touchpad is damn annoying , and i far prefer having the tactile feedback of actually pressing a physical button . 
  also means that you do n't have to lift your hand up , make a tap , and then put it back down , to go from moving the cursor around , pressing a button , then moving the cursor some more . 
  you can move and press without the extra steps . 
  still , i 'll reserve final judgement until i actually try it out . 
   and statistically significant enough for me to declare them not chosen at random, 
  no but that 's the thing . 
  this is n't true , and you only think they 're true because of the inherent ( and perfectly natural ) idea that they should be uniform if chosen `` randomly '' . 
  but that idea is wrong . 
  it 's still `` random '' even if the distribution it came from was n't uniform . 
  heck , it 's still random even if you ca n't model the distribution it came from using some formula . 
  if you run a test and find that when asked for a number from 1 -- 10 :, 
  * 30 % of people pick 7, 
  * 20 % of people pick 4, 
  * 1 % of people pick each 1 and 10, 
  * 8 % of people pick the remaining possibilities, 
  and you consistently find the same result . 
  that 's still random , it 's just picked from a discrete distribution with a pmf of { 0.01 , x \u2208 { 1,10 } ; 0.08 , x \u2208 { 2,3,5,6,8,9 } ; 0.2 , x = 4 ; 0.3 , x = 7 ; 0 , x \u2209 [ 1 , 10 ] } . 
  the fact that when asked to randomly pick a number do n't pick with uniform probability does n't mean it was n't random , it 's just that people have inherent biases that make their pick non-uniform . 
  but still , i 'm really looking forward to seeing what the results are . 
  especially for some of the later questions . 
  because i 'm explaining why someone else would n't do a certain thing , not that * i * would n't do it . 
  and anyway , there 's very little actual benefit in most cases of using the shorter link . 
  so it makes sense that someone might not bother . 
  actually it can be either . 
  here are a couple of different dictionary definitions i found :, 
  adjective, 
  ( of a creative work ) referring to itself or to the conventions of its genre ; self-referential . 
  * meta - | \u02c8m\u025bt\u0259 | ( also met - before a vowel or h ), 
  combining form, 
  3 denoting something of a higher or second-order kind, 
  3 , 2 , 1 backup . 
  three copies of the thing in total . 
  two different media ( cloud , hard drive , optical disk , etc. 
  are different options ), 
  one off-site backup ( a hard drive to take to you parents ' house , or cloud storage , or something like that ) . 
  `` one local backup and one cloud '' is a pretty good example of something that would count as successful 3 , 2 , 1 backup , so long as the `` local backup '' is in addition to the working copy . 
   now obviously , google drive is worlds better than a personal hdd, 
  yeah it definitely is . 
  the two biggest things i would be worried about with regards to backup are hard drive failure and my computer being stolen . 
  any cloud service makes those problems void . 
  of course , making bad changes , accidentally deleting the file , or a virus that corrupts your files , are all also problems that continuous cloud backup can suffer from . 
  i do n't know what the laws are where you are , but where i am they 're complicated . 
  so while it annoys me when i see other people do it wrong , i can at least understand it . 
  when you enter the roundabout , you indicate in the direction you will exit relative to where you got on . 
  that means if you 're heading straight , do n't indicate at all . 
  then , you keep that same indication as you go around , until you come up to the exit you 're going to get off at , then indicate left . 
  ( we drive on the left here . 
  if we drove on the right , the equivalent would obviously be indicate right when exiting . ), 
  i walk fast because walking slow just feels * wrong * to me . 
  if you wan na walk slow then fine . 
  just ( a ) do n't be blocking the path , and ( b ) do n't be all judgy of me for walking fast . 
   kill off a dmpc every now and then in a brutal fashion, 
  use this for [ the worf effect ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/theworfeffect ) ( ** warning ** tv tropes link ) , to show your players just how badass the bad guy is . 
  this works especially well if the players know the dmpc is pretty damn tough . 
  1 set of dice is just fine . 
  ideally it would be one set * per person * , or failing that , one for the dm and one for the players to share , but you can make do with just one between the whole group . 
  if it is one for the whole group though , i might suggest you download an app on your phone to do dice rolling , to speed things up a little . 
   and lastly , i have a strange group of friends that have n't seen eachother in a while, 
  do n't feel the need to rush in to the game . 
  take some time beforehand to catch up , and do n't be afraid to let the conversation wander from time to time even during the game -- unless some players seem like they 're bored , then get back into the game . 
  you do n't want people to feel like they 're being forced into playing . 
  it 's free in america . 
  i feel shitted upon for having to pay for a service here to watch something that 's free over there . 
  if it were on some payed streaming service in america ( say , like how game of thrones is/can be this year ) , then paying for stan to watch it here would be far more reasonable . 
  yeah that 's something that really annoys me . 
  they do n't have a list of their library available publicly . 
  i 'm not signing up for any service , even for a free 30 day trial ( unless that trial does * not * require handing over any information other than email address ) , if i ca n't see what i 'm getting for my money . 
  netflix is the same way , unfortunately , which is a big part of the reason i have n't jumped at it already .
