  people picking a number is the same thing . 
  it 's harder to quantify what the pmf is in that case than it is with the physical objects , in fact , the pmf may be different for different people , but it 's still a random pick . 
  it 's much easier to see how it 's random in the examples with physical things , but if you think of the psychology involved in picking a `` random '' number as equivalent to the number of balls in a bag , it becomes clear that the number thing is still random . 
  then why the previous comment ? 
  if you 're already on the subreddit 's page ( which the person obviously was , because they had to go searching for it to find the right one ) , it 's so much easier to just copy and paste than to type it out manually . 
  if you had to go and search it out specifically to copy and paste it , then in that case it would obviously be much easier to just type it . 
  that 's true , they definitely could do that . 
  in fact , that would be the perfect out . 
  i 'm doubtful that they will , though . 
  unless they 're period pieces or sci-fi ( or are otherwise specifically designed for a particular time ) , most shows tend to prefer to be set in the present as they air , because it keeps things simpler . 
  capes are lame !, 
  tell your cousin i said so . 
  actually , never ... never do that . 
  a cape aids with aerodynamics , i should have thought of that !, 
  i 'm guessing they 're talking about how some people genuinely ca n't get vaccinated for health reasons . 
  to which i say . 
  well fucking * duh * . 
  that makes no difference here . 
  * obviously * if someone can not get a vaccination for their own health reasons , then they should n't get it . 
  that 's exactly the * reason * everyone who can get it , should . 
  i have n't , and i fly very regularly . 
  that said , most of my flights are to , from , or within , south east asia . 
  not exactly a people known for their significant size . 
  but anyway , i agree that someone who physically takes up more space than a single seat can fit , should be paying for a second seat . 
  look , if you want to pronounce it with a hard g , go ahead . 
  i 'll always think you 're wrong and the way you 're saying it sounds dumb , but whatever . 
  technically , both hard and soft g pronunciations are accepted these days , because a significant amount of people use both pronunciations . 
  but do n't you ** ever fucking dare ** to justify it with that bullshit . 
  it 's just wrong . 
  the sound that a letter in an acronym makes has ** zero ** bearing on the way the acronym is pronounced . 
   and then when the vast majority do n't get autism, 
  eh ... if there actually * were * evidence of a link between vaccines and autism , even if it were small , like an increase of 5 percentage points in the chance of getting autism ( that is to say , `` the vast majority '' still do n't get autism ) , i would be open to listening to people who do n't want to vaccinate their kids . 
  but the fact is there is * no * link between them . 
  so it is n't a matter of `` the vast majority '' not getting autism , it 's `` no increase at all '' in the number that get it . 
  i 'm almost certain thedoh 's comment was a parody . 
  it 's also possible that republicans hate everyone they have n't heard of . 
  or that america has a whole hates everyone they have n't heard of . 
  everything is about sex . 
  except sex . 
  sex is about power . 
  buying is * never * a problem with them . 
  the reason they 're so popular is that as a buyer , you are basically completely safe with them . 
  the reason all these shitty stories about how a seller got fucked over in one way or another ( my favourite is the one where they [ made a buyer destroy an extremely valuable violin to get a refund ] ( http://consumerist.com/2012/01/03/paypal-tells-buyer-to-destroy-purchased-violin-instead-of-return-for-refund/ ) ) is because whenever there is even the slightest doubt , they will * always * side with the buyer . 
  so buyers feel safe using them . 
  so they do continue to use them . 
  unfortunately this comes at the expense of being really shitty to the sellers , as countless examples have demonstrated . 
  but sellers continue to use them because they 're so big , and because buyers are more likely to buy if you use them ( as a result of their size and their reliability for buyers ) . 
  yeah i know . 
  same in australia , where i 'm from . 
  3rd in the anglosphere and 21st in the world , according wikipedia . 
  yay us . 
  and , for what it 's worth , in the same region , nz is even worse than aus , second only to america in the anglosphere and 17th worldwide . 
  ( the data 's really old though ... not sure how accurate it is . ), 
  i do n't use an iphone . 
  i 'm actually an android user . 
  obviously it 's the same experience as the iphone in this respect , though . 
  but to me the experience feels different on a touchscreen versus a touchpad , at least as far as tapping vs. clicking goes . 
  on a laptop , i often rest my hand on the trackpad . 
  that is n't really possible on a phone , since it obscures the screen . 
  clicking with two fingers , or clicking and dragging ( especially clicking with one finger and dragging with another ) , are also much less common on a phone than on the apple trackpad . 
  but as i said , i have n't experienced the new thing firsthand , so i 'd have to try it before i really pass judgement . 
  might be that the other guy was weird and noticed a problem that is n't really there . 
  equally , it might be that i have the same problem , which would be another point against apple in my books when it comes time to get a new laptop -- a relatively minor one , but many minor things add up . 
  we have two great actors as eobard ? 
  edit : oh wait , is the second one the guy that we saw briefly in the flashback ? 
  the one that 's * actually * eobard ? 
  is he well-known from other things ? 
  mine too !, 
  but mine 's powered by triple a batteries , so it 's a aaa aa aardvark sim . 
   if a gm is using the warlock 's pact to manipulate the players actions , they 're just being a jerk, 
  that depends . 
  a warlock * should * be occasionally required to perform * something * for their patron . 
  this could be done between campaigns , or be really minor things in many cases . 
  but if the player is willing , it could be far more substantial things . 
  personally as a player if i were to play a warlock ( and i 'm very considering making my next character one , once i 'm done dming our current campaign ) , i would hope to get the dm to roleplay my patron pretty seriously -- between sessions , most of the time : no need to interupt everyone else 's play . 
  after all , what 's the fun in playing a character who gets their powers by making a dark pact if you * do n't * get to roleplay the consequences of said pact . 
  but if the player does n't enjoy that particular aspect , i do n't think the dm should be too heavy handed about it . 
  this contradicts nothing i said . 
  in fact , it reinforces it . 
  true , good point . 
  in some ways , the goo could be the best choice for a warlock who wants to be like a cleric but with more damagey powers . 
  but equally , it could be interesting to play the goo gradually becoming aware of the player as they become more powerful . 
  they 're probably not going to notice the level 5 warlock helping rebuild a dwarven mine , but they might notice the level 18 warlock saving the world from a power that rivals their own . 
  there are a lot of different interesting ways the warlock-patron relationship can be played out . 
  well it 's 5 if you count the two episodes in season 2 as separate . 
  but seriously , i fucking loved the last two episodes of season 4 . 
  some of the best episodes of the show . 
  but i do n't really consider advanced introduction to finality a paintball episode . 
  the paintballish stuff was only a small bit at the end , when the main plot was dealing with the darkest timeline stuff remedial chaos theory and introduction to finality set up . 
  nope . 
   you create a ghostly , skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range . 
  make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave . 
  yup !, 
  the lore around shardminds & the living gate , and their relation to the far realm , is really interesting . 
  shardminds are a fantastic race , roleplay-wise . 
  but perhaps i 'm biased , since a shardmind was my first real character . 
  oh right !, 
  an edit probably would 've been useful . 
  i saw the reply saying `` nvm my bad '' but did n't read the username . 
  assumed it was the guy you replied to correcting his perceived mistake .
