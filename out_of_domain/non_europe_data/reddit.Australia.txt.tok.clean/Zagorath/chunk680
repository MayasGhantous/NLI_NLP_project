  i know they said it was n't sarcasm , but what they then went on to say was pretty much `` this is a serious portrayal of how many people think , but it actually is n't accurate '' . 
  in other words , a parody , of sorts . 
  you forgot to mention the introduction of the grand exchange itself . 
  yay for git branches . 
  no rouge ? 
  uh huh . 
  mentally disabled people get let off , but people who have been reformed ** and ** were guilty of completely non-violent crimes to begin with are not . 
  there are plenty of things a person could say about indonesia , but saying that they have a halfway sane or humane approach to execution is ** not ** one of them . 
  eh , if it was actually known without a doubt that this doctor had something that would cure all cancers , i think people would puck him . 
  though in a less extreme example you 'd probably be right . 
  how many * fucking * times do people need to point out scuba and nasa and jpeg and all the other acronyms that clearly demonstrate this argument is bullshit before you people stop trying to use it ? 
  hey wrote it out wrong . 
  the way mike from idea channel pronounces it is more like zhaif . 
  i 'm on my phone so i ca n't copy the ipa for it , but it 's the `` voiced palato-alveolar sibilant '' . 
  the the english `` vi ** si ** on '' or `` bei ** g ** e '' or the french '' ** j ** amais '' or `` visa ** g ** e '' . 
   or an upper-vs-lower class thing, 
  oh that 's very interesting . 
  in my mind as a non-brit , if i heard someone pronounce it like `` cone '' i would instantly think `` he 's posh , or he wants to think he 's posh '' . 
  it 's how i imagine the queen pronouncing it . 
   the color maroon is generally pronounced sort of like maron and clerk is like clark . 
  i know how australians pronounce maroon ( go the maroons !, 
  ) , but i have no idea whether you 're right or wrong . 
  as far as i 'm aware , maron is n't a real word , and based on how it 's written , i ca n't see how people would arrive at a consistent understanding . 
  the `` oo '' is the same as in `` go '' or `` code '' . 
  as for clerk , i would pronounce it clerk . 
  like if something irks ( annoys ) you . 
  i dunno if that 's how most aussies pronounce it , though . 
  that said , fwiw , the wikipedia article on clerk is mostly from a very american perspective , and its pronunciation guide is like clark . 
  saving this as `` all you could ever need to know about the planes in d&d '' . 
  please do n't delete your comments !, 
  aww , why 'd you delete everything ? 
  need the extra e , lest you draw the wrath of the faith militant . 
  the way they ended that scene ( after miranda left , sansa putting her head in her hands ) made it pretty clear that what she did there took a lot of effort . 
  it was pretty much the extent of her ability to stand up for herself , at this point . 
  to become ... something ... else . 
  it 's an initialism , not an abbreviation . 
  an abbreviation is like saying christmas is 25th dec. 
  i believe his intention was that img is an abbreviation for `` image '' . 
  personally i would pronounce img `` imj '' , so that 's how i pronounce imgur , too . 
  oh ... guess the mods must have deleted it then . 
  the content of your original post is now just :, 
  [ removed ], 
  hey mods , if this post was against the rules , then i guess that 's okay . 
  i 'm guessing it 's probably rule 5 , now that i look . 
  ( and i would just say , personally i think rule 5 , and your stated reason behind it , is a really dumb rule , but whatever . ), 
  but it is ** really ** bad form to remove something without giving a public reason . 
  let anyone who found the thread before you deleted it and was keeping it open waiting to see more responses , and especially the op themselves , know what 's going on : why it was removed , and what they can do to prevent it happening again . 
  apologies if that 's not what happened here . 
  in that case , i 'm just confused what 's going on . 
  / u/famoushippopotamus , / u/ademonicspoon , / u/sibraxlis , / u/stitchlipped , / u/petrichorparticle . 
  the way you wrote how australians pronounce maroon . 
  i know how australians pronounce maroon , but i have no idea how a person who looks at `` maron '' is supposed to pronounce it . 
  so i think it makes a poor example for explaining . 
  yeah i 'm kinda surprised it 's against the rules . 
  i 'd guess it 's rule 5 , which seems a really vague and poorly thought out rule imo . 
  and yeah , if mods deleted something of yours , you yourself ca n't see it . 
  if you look in incognito mode you 'll see what it looks like . 
  you could probably repost in / r/dnd . 
  haha yeah . 
  muh rone definitely works . 
  i was implying that if you had one e , it 'd be a guy . 
  that 'd make him gay , which would incur the faith militant 's wrath . 
  hey , i was wondering if you ( or anyone else ) could give a brief summary of the approach of each of these podcasts . 
  at the moment , i listen to critical success and dungeon master 's block , but i 'd be interested in more . 
  but with so many to choose from , it 's hard to pick !, 
  [ here 's another interesting idea for a necromancer ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2grdzv/an _ evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game / ) . 
  not necessarily how you would want to play , but it 's worth reading to have more ideas . 
  it would probably fit as a neutral character , but maybe not so much chaotic neutral . 
  mechanically , if you 're playing 5e , the wizard of the necromancy school is the best choice . 
  the death domain cleric is the only other good option available . 
  you can find its details in the dmg . 
  hand crossbow does 1d6 damage at range 30/120 . 
  longbow is 1d8 at range 150/600 . 
  pistols do 1d10 at range 30/90 and are one-handed ( so you could wield two of these , or have a dagger or something ) . 
  muskets do 1d12 at range 40/120 . 
  modern weapons all do 2dx with a minimum range ( barring the shotgun , which seems weirdly underpowered and ultimately pointless from a mechanical perspective , raw ) of 40/120 . 
  so while the longbow is still a good choice if you really need that large range , firearms are a better choice for pure damage output compared to any phb weapon . 
  with the renaissance weapons , you would need a feat to get over the fact that they can normally only use 1 attack per round , but the modern weapons would not even need that . 
  i would allow either the crossbow expert feat to also count for guns , or make a gun expert feat that has the same benefits as crossbow expert , but only for guns , not sure which . 
  also all the stuff that 's listed as `` houserules '' but has a bunch of different sources that are n't homebrew . 
  would be nice if you could easily scan and see the true source . 
  for example , i 'd consider stuff from the official article by dan helmick to be more canon than the playpacket stuff , which is much more canon than the fullon homebrew stuff . 
  that was my initial interpretation of what he wrote , too ( which i thought was weird , since my * previous * understanding was that it 's super-advantage for that roll ) . 
  but he 's since tweeted an update clarifying that you can , indeed , choose * any one * of the three dice . 
  effectively , super advantage on the roll . 
  actually , no . 
  you 're right that it 's two separate events , but you do n't ignore the second dice of the first roll . 
  first , roll at disadvantage a 16 and a 6 . 
  then , you roll your lucky die , and get a 10 . 
  you can choose any of the three results to go with . 
  obviously you pick the 16 . 
  super advantage . 
  as weird as that may be . 
  crawford has confirmed that this is how it works in a tweet . 
  the smart move as a dm is to just be very careful never to give the lucky player disadvantage !, 
  disclaimer : i do n't actually condone doing this . 
  [ huh ... so he did . 
  well , sorta . 
  in that scenario , you roll two , pick the lowest ( i.e. , you get a result from rolling with disadvantage , and treat that single result as one roll ) . 
  then roll lucky , and pick the higher .
