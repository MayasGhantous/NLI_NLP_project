  you just have those effects end at the point in the initiative order that they * would * have had their turn . 
  and it 's pretty clear that rules as intended are exactly as you play it . 
  it 's not so much a home rule as using a common sense interpretation of the rules as the exist . 
  so , i 'm not trying to be rude or anything , but ... 
  people actually watch that ? 
  i 'm confused . 
  i do n't see the relation between kryptonian/ese and the . gif file format ... 
  i do n't even think that 's true . 
  people who themselves do n't know how to drive probably do n't realise it , and still complain about other people that ca n't drive . 
   people who think they can take a corner at 60 , and end up cutting 50 % into the lanes next to them, 
  oh god thank you . 
  i was cycling earlier this week and at one point someone came around a corner in the opposite direction and i was legitimately scared he 'd * run me off the road , even though i was already as far left as i could go . 
  all because he came around the corner way too wide . 
  \\* or she , i did n't see which, 
  mate , that is n't how acronyms work . 
  otherwise you 'd be pronouncing scuba with the same `` u '' as in `` underwater '' . 
  or nasa would be more like `` nuhsae '' . 
  by word structure , both hard and soft g make sense . 
  i ca n't imagine you 'll be downvoted for it . 
  it 's been fairly clear since before the leaked pilot that the only way they could do crossovers is if they do multi-dimensional stuff . 
  the leaked pilot only served to reinforce that notion . 
   i 'm not a millionaire playboy who was lost at sea, 
  wait you are n't ? 
  what sort of freak are you ? 
  no , i just rewatched it an hour ago . 
  they mention superman by that name right at the start , when they talk about how he was already known in the world by the time kara arrived . 
  oh man , the `` must be an integer '' requirement is so frustrating . 
  especially since that part of the warning was only at the very * end * of the poll , so my mind was already thinking of the best way to represent a really small number . 
   [ ~ 15 degrees ] is the best temperature, 
  oh god man . 
  i 'm sitting wrapped up in my jumper at 20 degrees right now in brisbane . 
  i ca n't stand when it gets much colder than this . 
  25 is the perfect temperature , but i 'd take 30 over 20 any day . 
  i do n't know what the terminology is in different editions . 
  but in 4e heroic was 1-10 , and epic is 21-30 . 
  that would mean there 's a heap of room for variation in between . 
  as far as i can tell , 5e does n't really have specific terminology . 
  but based on the way / u/buiamil worded their comment , it seems pretty clear to me that they meant it to be a gradual increase . 
  i 'm not sure how they 'd play that out mechanically , though . 
  nah , it 's official . 
   ## weapon properties, 
   ### ammunition, 
   ... at the end of the battle , you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield . 
  fwiw i tried it on my nexus 4 and it did n't work . 
  says who ? 
  i 've always seen c&h refere to cyanide and happiness , and i do n't think i 've ever seen calvin & hobbes shortened . 
  if that 's the convention , it 's not a very good one to `` distinguish both without confusion '' . 
  if that were the aim , they 'd use cah and cyh , since c&h is always going to be ambiguous , since you ca n't assume everyone knows the convention . 
  gin is the best example . 
  the same first two letters , and the third is a soft consonant just like f is . 
  but anyway , the english language does n't work like that . 
  people say gif with both a hard and a soft g. both are correct . 
  the only people that are wrong are the ones claiming that their preferred pronunciation is the only right one . 
  ( oh , and the weirdos that say zhaif . ), 
  eh , calvin and hobbes is a really old comic . 
  i do n't think i 've seen it referenced more than a handful of times , and to me it just has something about it that it really does n't hold up particularly well . 
  peanuts is the same ( though probably worse ) . 
  but perhaps that 's just because neither were nearly as popular where i grew up as they are in america . 
  either way , cyanide and happiness is definitely the comic i 've seen referenced far more frequently online . 
  it 's not far behind xkcd in terms of relevance today , i would say . 
  edit : and , just out of interest , i googled `` c & h '' . 
  first result was explosm.net , second and third were their youtube channel and a particular playlist made by them . 
  4 , 5 , 6 , and 8 are unrelated to any comics , and 7 was the cyh page on itunes . 
  obviously google results are tailored to a number of things , including my location and previous browsing history , so you may get different results . 
  but i did n't get a single cah related link anywhere . 
  [ eh ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/search?q=c%26h&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ), 
  looks like both get used to refer to cyanide & happiness . 
  mate , you know daylight saving would make that worse , right ? 
  your 6:30 am starts would be effectively 5:30 am starts , since what the clock says is 6:30 would actually be 5:30 . 
  wow thanks for sharing all of that . 
  i hope you 're doing better , now . 
  right . 
  daylight saving would make things worse for you , not better . 
  other way round , mate . 
  have stewart be his middle name . 
  take up swimming or cycling . 
  it 's totally accepted by society in general if you use one of those as your excuse for it . 
  i thought it was the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand . 
  the one that started world war i. 
  edit : read the wp article . 
  turns out it 's both . 
  being not-american , i 'm more familiar with the wwi one , while americans probably are more familiar with the one that started their revolutionary war . 
  i will say this , though : one of these shots was heard * more * `` around the world '' than the other . 
  it 's clearly an intentional leak to drum up hype and get feedback . 
  like he said . 
  worth noting that `` vs. armour class '' and `` vs. 
  difficulty class set by dm/spell/rule '' mean that if your total score * equals * that ac or dc , you succeed . 
  however , in skill contests ( where two people are making skill checks that oppose one another ) , whoever gets higher succeeds , and if there 's a tie , the least change occurs . 
  for example , one person trying to open a door versus another trying to keep it closed , it stays closed . 
  two people trying to grab a ring that fell on the floor , a tie means neither gets it . 
  seriously , that was such a weird moment . 
  total direwolf ex machina . 
   showing the candle lit from brienne 's pov, 
  fwiw the candle * was n't * lit from brienne 's pov . 
  she was standing watch to see if it would be lit , but it was n't . 
  hmm , guess not . 
  yeah this is definitely a better answer . 
  as far as i 'm aware , it works in all the major browsers on all three desktop platforms . 
  f6 works only on windows to my knowledge , and maybe only some browsers ? 
  it fails the grey favicon test , though .
