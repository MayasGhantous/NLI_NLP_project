  even with the federation star and the southern cross ? 
  yeah definitely . 
  i listen to hi at one of the slowest speeds of any of my podcasts , and it 's at 2x . 
  most of the podcasts i listen to , i have it at between 2.4 and 2.8 x. 
  oh god that 's awful . 
  it 's not highly recognisable , it 's not especially symbolic ( it 's literally just a rough diagram of the solar system ) , and why the fuck does a map of the solar system made in 2012 have pluto on it as a planet ? 
  to me , the only good ones on that page are the silver fern and the kyle lockwood one . 
  the james bowman one might be good . 
  i 'm not a new zealander , and i do n't associate the `` koru '' design with them . 
  but if that 's a symbol that has great significance over there , then the bowman one 's not terrible . 
  if one of the greatest musicians of all time can create his greatest works after going deaf , i 'm sure you could make do . 
  oh thanks for this . 
  i was so confused about why op was saying that they could do a 10 km race at a pace of 8:00 in 50 minutes . 
  looks like you britta 'd the title . 
  i mean , i guess if you count 4 and 5 as one season since they 're both half the length of a `` full '' season , it makes sense . 
  but from that perspective , we 've only got 5 1/2 once this season ends ... 
  well , yeah , but it 's included as a tiny part of a greater star scape , not as a standalone feature as it is on the current australian , kiwi , png , and samoan flags . 
  holy fuck that guy is totally insane . 
  he needs to be a villain on the show . 
  look , av is a great system , and it 's heaps better than what you guys have at the moment . 
  but if you 're going to go to all the effort of changing your voting system ( which would be * exceedingly * hard to do pretty much anywhere , but especially in america ) , why not skip straight to a better system ? 
  use [ stv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) . 
  av is actually the special case of stv where only a single winner is chosen . 
  if you take your current electorates ( or your new ones from shortest line ) , and merge them together into groups of 4-6 , then have each of the resulting electorates elect 4-6 representatives by the stv voting system , you end up with a mostly proportional result that still has local representation , does n't formalise parties , and is just as easy from the voter 's perspective as av is ( simply number candidates in order of preference ) . 
  edit : closing bracket, 
  which software , specifically , are you talking about ? 
  i love apple 's hardware , but personally i do n't like the direction they 're going with their hardware . 
  i have a medium-end macbook pro , but an older one . 
  it has a discrete graphics card , which is fairly important to me . 
  these days , only the highest possible model has discrete graphics . 
  but i love the software . 
  specifically , i love their professional-grade media software . 
  ca n't really give two shits about the rest of their application software ( do n't use itunes very much , never use safari , ilife , or iwork ) . 
  but their pro-level media stuff is hands down * the * best stuff for a prosumer like me . 
  final cut pro x blows all of the competition out of the water , unless you 're working on massive-scale film productions . 
  so i 'm a bit disappointed that my next laptop , when it comes time to replace this one , probably wo n't be able to run fcp , since it probably wo n't be apple . 
  it 's also nice having a full unix terminal , though obviously linux has that , too . 
  windows is utter shite from that perspective . 
  [ well , i mean , stannis has met ollie before . 
  nothing . 
  oh right , yeah . 
  i 'm mostly in agreement with you on ios . 
  i was mainly coming from an os x perspective . 
  i use android . 
  [ here are all of those on a timeline ] ( https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=click%2chighlight%2cmouse%2cicon%2cmenu%2cwindow%2cdialog%2cscroll%2cdialogue&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=1&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3b%2cclick%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2chighlight%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2cmouse%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2cicon%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2cmenu%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2cwindow%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2cdialog%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2cscroll%3b%2cc0%3b.t1%3b%2cdialogue%3b%2cc0 ) . 
  looks like the effect was most significant with `` window '' , `` menu '' , `` click '' , and `` dialog '' . 
  a couple of interesting points , for some reason `` window '' was on the way down from the mid 1940s until the late 1970s . 
  also , `` dialogue '' is significantly more popular than `` dialog '' , but has seen more steady growth since the '60s , versus `` dialog '' , which was basically non-existant until 1984 . 
  the average height of south koreans has grown by like a foot since the end of the war , thanks mostly to improved diets as the country underwent massive economic growth . 
  this is definitely the case in vietnam . 
  would n't be at all surprised to know it 's true in other places . 
  the reasoning , at least in vietnam , is that poorer people are the ones that have to work outside in the sun , and so become more tanned . 
  so there 's an association of wealth and higher class with lighter skin . 
  i think the best example of this is korea . 
  at the time of the korean war , people from north and south korea were roughly the same height today , people from south korea are nearly a foot taller on average than their northern cousins . 
  go listen to the podcast hello internet that he and brady haran ( who does numberphile and a bunch of other youtube channels ) do . 
  i think it 's unlikely that he puts on a voice for that amount of time unscripted . 
   the editor, 
  just fyi , he is his own editor . 
  i thought he was talking about something like [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1a/stuart_%26_sons_2.9m_102-note_piano.jpg ) ( not what the top and bottom notes are , and the number of connectors leading to the pedals ) . 
  it moves the hammers closer to the string , softening the tone , but affecting timbre in a different way to the una corda pedal . 
  i believe it 's called the `` dolce '' pedal . 
  my 2012 mac ca n't run it ... 
  but then , that 's because i 've only tried the mac port , which has to be one of the worst wineskin-wrapped games to have ever been wrapped . 
  i 'm sure it 'd run perfectly if i tried it in windows on this machine . 
  like potato gets used for cameras . 
  honestly i thought it was an edited version of an action ac screenshot ... so an explanation of what 's actually going on would have been helpful . 
   our house rule that intimidation can be used with a strength or charisma modifier, 
  not a house rule . 
  rules as written , skills are only loosely tied to an ability . 
  they have their main , normal ability , but can be used with other abilities if it makes sense . 
  intimidation can be done through verbal threats , where it would be charisma , or by making a physical demonstration of how powerful you are , which would be strength . 
  this is actually one of the explicit examples they give in the phb . 
  other examples include making a constitution ( athletics ) check for physical endurance in a long swim , and [ many other ideas mentioned in this thread ] ( / r/dnd/comments / 2u6rfb/skills _ with_different_abilities_5e / ) . 
  oh god , now i ca n't remember how it 's actually * meant * be be spelt ... 
  theon also asks `` what is it ? 
  mountain lion ? '', 
  as far as i 'm aware , this is just one hypothesis . 
  it 's not something that 's universally believed to be true , and it has n't been tested thoroughly . 
   and there 's no reason their value would ever need to change, 
  this is already covered in the article . 
  see the word `` immutable '' ? 
  that 's what it means . 
  they specifically asked for a live stream . 
  clearly , for whatever reason , the tv stations are n't an option , or they would n't have asked . 
   throw those dice away to be melted with the trash and burned, 
  i prefer to ` gift ' mine to someone i do n't like . 
  oh man , i just realised how condescending my previous comment sounded . 
  sorry about that , i really did n't mean in that way . 
  i 'd hardly call it * the * repost . 
  there are a few big ones ( sir bearington is undoubtably * the * repost ) and this has only been submitted once before . 
  and that was over 12 months ago , and only saw 10 comments . 
  but anyway , it looks like i accidentally overlooked this one when creating our [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) a few months back . 
  definitely want to fix that , but i ca n't think of a good quick summary for it . 
  anyone wan na help with that ? 
  yeah i had similar problems . 
  i tried a bunch of cables and chargers , and got pretty much the same results from all of them , even when i * knew * one was better than the other from experience . 
  yeah but seriously , i * really * wish android permissions worked like they do on ios . 
  i love the fact that we can see what permissions an app will require before downloading it , but there is * no * good reason that i should n't be able to say `` actually , no , i do n't want facebook having access to read my smses , or my location , but i do want to use the facebook app '' . 
  make the app ask for permission on first use ( of that specific permission ) , and allow it to explain * why * it needs it .
