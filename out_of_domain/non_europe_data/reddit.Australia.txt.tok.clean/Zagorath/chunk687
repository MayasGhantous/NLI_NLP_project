  let the user grant temporary or permanent access to what it wants , and have a central panel for managing this stuff . 
  it would make the user experience so much better . 
  god damn twilight . 
  i love my last name , but now i have to share it with a bunch of fucking sparkly vampires ... 
  i love l names . 
  lola , lois , lisa , lilly . 
  i agree with your names , though i 've kalgoorlie started using brace rather than curly bracket since i started programming in c-like languages . 
  edit : well that 's an interesting autocorrect . 
  i have no idea what i meant to type when it actually typed `` kalgoorlie '' . 
  no but seriously , funnel webs are extremely venomous , and are one of the ( if not * the * ) most aggressive spiders out there . 
  you try and relocate them with bate hands and you * will * get bitten , and it will seriously hurt . 
  [ here 's a link to the previous time this was posted here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 26vi4h/the _ tale_of_edgardo / ) , in case anyone wants to read the comments . 
  i think it 's meant to be accusing the user of being incapable of selecting options from a dropdown . 
  but it 's badly worded, 
  wait , there 's a ` required ` attribute for forms in html ? 
  what exactly is its behaviour ( as in , what happens when a person tries to hit send without filling out a required text field ) ? 
  [ the w3 website is n't exactly clear ... ] ( http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_required.asp ) and , speaking of which , what are the consequences of a lack of support in safari ? 
  i 've always just used ` class = `` required '' ` for css stuff like asterisks or whatever . 
   i saw a lot of them when visiting queensland, 
  well fuck . 
  i did n't even know we got them here ... 
  ( should we tell him ? ), 
  not a movie , a tv show . 
  but the original , uk version of ( spoiler warning , the show is currently a very popular us show , and knowing the end of the uk version * might * be a spoiler for the us one , though it also might go in a different direction ) [ house of cards ] ( / spoiler ) . 
  it ends with [ francis urquhart dying . 
  though i guess one could say that it is n't really the bad guy winning , since ( arguably ) the `` bad guy '' actually is fu . 
  but i figured since the main character of the show dies , this qualifies . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  eh , w3schools was recommended by my uni , and it 's never led me astray before . 
  indeed , even in this case , the main w3 website is n't really any better . 
  sure , it goes in to specific examples of what qualifies as satisfying `` required '' on different types of input , but that 's just elaborating on something that 's pretty obvious anyway . 
  it does nothing to help explain the actual behaviour of the browser when something that is required is not filled out . 
  so that website is no more useful than w3schools was . 
  in fact , it was less useful , since it tells me nothing about what browsers support the feature . 
  that said , thanks for the link anyway . 
  the incidental bit about ` oninput ` in the ` form ` tag was something i did n't know about already , and could be really useful . 
  so thanks for that !, 
   i tried maltesers last time i was in the uk, 
  wait what you guys do n't have maltesers in america this is absolutely astonishing to me ... 
  nah , there are at least useful reason for the current behaviour to remain as it is . 
  what really needs fixing us the god damn ordered list notation . 
  if you start a line with a number and a dot , that 's what you should get . 
  an ordered list * starting at that number * . 
  use the ` ol ` ` start ` attribute and the ` li ` ` value ` one . 
  there 's no good reason for the current behaviour . 
  it only ever confuses people . 
   they 're corner cases no one 's likely to come across, 
  oh god man . 
  i come across someone who messes up with the ordered list syntax on * at least * a weekly basis . 
  it is by far the biggest problem in markdown . 
  the superscript and strikeout stuff can be worked around in most basic cases . 
  while it would be nice if there fixed the more edge cases , they do rarely come up . 
  the paragraph thing i actually kinda like as is . 
  if they changed it , what would a single `` enter '' do ? 
  enter a line break , or start a new paragraph ? 
  if the former , all changing it would do is cause some redditors to use the syntax poorly forever . 
  they 're getting a `` new line '' , so who cares to learn the right way to make `` paragraphs '' , right ? 
  if the latter , how would one insert line breaks ? 
  if it 's the same : end with two spaces before the newline , it could have weird consequences where people accidentally put two spaces after their final full stop or whatever . 
  so , as it is now , it forces people to learn the correct syntax to get the best end result . 
  and once they have learned the correct syntax , it removes any potential ambiguity from slight errors in what they 've written . 
  no but seriously , i 've used single slash notation before when i specifically want to refer to a user or subreddit * without * linking to it or notifying them . 
  that 's great , but that link has the same problem that the one scragar posted does -- it actually provides * less * relevant information than the w3schools page does . 
  it has the same vague bit about required meaning the input is required , but like w3s , it does nothing to explain what happens when someone tries to submit without filling out the required bit . 
  and unlike w3s , it does n't have any information about which browsers currently support the feature . 
  right , in that case you did n't close your brackets . 
  if i were to substitute the smiley with an emoji version of the smiley it becomes more clear :, 
   ep ... pkd ( philip k dick especially , was right on the money . 
  see , no closing bracket . 
  oh wow that 's a really cool source !, 
  definitely gon na be referring back to that from time to time . 
  thanks !, 
  well yeah , of course that 's not what the document is for . 
  because it 's just the spec . 
  but that does n't change the fact that it makes it less useful . 
  and that second screenshot is from a different section than the one you linked last time . 
  oh fair enough . 
  that explains it . 
  i 've seen quite a few people saying w3schools was bad but it 's always seemed weird to me since my experience has been completely different . 
  i guess that just shows how strong inertia can be in people 's opinions of something . 
  but yeah , thanks for those links . 
  someone linked can i use earlier , and it looks like an absolutely amazing resource . 
    supergirl is really someone we are all going to route for !, 
   * root, 
  personally i 'd rather not even use that . 
  where i 'm from , `` root '' is a euphamism for `` have sex with '' . 
  `` cheer for '' works nicely , though . 
  wow this is absolutely lovely . 
  you clearly picked your themes carefully , because some of the music in lotr would n't fit as well with classical guitar ( the fellowship theme , the gondor theme , etc. 
  ) , and that 's really helped here : you 've managed to make the absolute best use of your instrument . 
  thanks for sharing this !, 
  do you have any more works like this ? 
   the australian progressives have a pact with the socialist alternative, 
  oh , that 's very interesting . 
  i was not aware of this . 
  has it been made known to the public ? 
  because i have n't seen anything about it , though i might have just glanced over that bit . 
  hey , sorry i only just came across this now . 
  so , i 'm the greens candidate for brisbane and surrounds . 
  i would urge people to vote green , because i believe that our policies ( as outlined in our earlier statements ) are the best for ( model ) australia .
