  most notably , we would like to get back to the * real * nbn , we want to end this mandatory metadata rubbish , and we want to continue to support education at all levels . 
  we also have firm definitive policies regarding the climate . 
  the australian progressives are a great party , and in most cases , their policies seem to be more or less the same . 
  but we have been significantly more specific in what exactly we want to get done , rather than using wishy-washy terms like `` beginning the education revolution , so we can institute the 21st century model for our children 's learning '' . 
  instead , we would like to specifically continue backing gonski reforms , provide facilities for computer science , and take a serious look at writing off hecs-help debt for stem students ( an idea first proposed by bill shorten in the budget reply speech ) . 
  both parties are great options , i just believe that we 've done a better job of showing that we are the * better * option .

  / u/petef , / u/oleksiyguy , see the above comment . 
  hey / u/phyllicanderer , i 'm just curious , over in / r/mhocpress , / u/drjalexanderphysics mentioned that the progressives and the socialist alternative had formed a pact . 
  i 'm just wondering ( a ) if that 's true , and if so ( b ) have you made it clear to the voters that this is the case ? 
  it would n't seem fair to me to have inter-party agreements formed before the election that were n't made known so that voters could consider that when they vote . 
  [ here 's a better source ] ( http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/root ) . 
  this subreddit !, 
  no , really . 
  the wiki on here has a [ list of resources ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/wiki/resourcelist ) , and in that is ( among other things ) a link to all of the material released by wizards , including the free rules , the elemental evil free pdf , and each of the unearthed arcana documents . 
  it does n't seem to be working for me . 
  i get to the page where it says, 
   hi , your public voter id is [ ... ] and you can submit your ballot vote below :, 
  then below that it has, 
   / user/zagorath cancel, 
  then below that , just a heap of blank space , until it says, 
   voting is open until 20 hours and 25 minutes from now . 
  i tried this on two computers , one with chrome on windows 8.1 , one with chrome on os x yosemite . 
  both had the same problem . 
  well i 'm not using any extensions or settings that would block scripts , and i never got a message telling me it 's blocking something or asking me if i want to allow anything . 
  ah , i had a look at the js console , this is what i 'm getting :, 
   mixed content : the page at ` https :\\ / / modelparliament.herokuapp.com/voting#button' was loaded over https , but requested an insecure resource ` http://modelaec.herokuapp.com/voting/ballot/a28cf225-5838-40d9-aa77-9b74e0cc0b5a/div-qb.rep-qb.candidate' . 
  this request has been blocked ; the content must be served over https . 
  looks like the error is that you guys have n't set up the voting thing to work properly over https . 
  considering the point of this is * voting * , that seems a pretty major oversite . 
  doubly so considering it meant the browser completely blocked any possibility of * accessing * the resource : no warning message shown publicly or anything , just blocked . 
  but anyway , i edited it using the browser 's dev tools to add in as `` s '' to the link , and then it worked . 
  i voted !, 
  i remember looking for an icon like that , but i did n't see any . 
  but anyway , i managed to fix it using the dev tools . 
  just had to add an `` s '' after the `` http '' in the link that was getting the voting resource . 
  the computer is definitely capable of running the game , it 's the operating system that ca n't . 
  or to be more precise , the wrapper is so terrible that the os just does n't know what to do with it . 
  [ it 's a well-known problem with the game ] ( / r/macgaming/comments / s2bqz/howto _ update_the_witcher_enhanced_edition_engine / ) . 
  even after following all the instructions in there , and having a long conversation with the author of that post ( over pm , because i came across it long after that post was archived ) , i still could n't solve it . 
  the game would run really smoothly for a few minutes to maybe an hour , then would just crash without warning . 
  so i had to be saving * really * regularly , lest i lose a heap of progress . 
  eventually i just got bored of that and gave up on the game . 
  often the `` reason '' is n't a very good one . 
  12 reflections after the first year of the course is * really * few , but saying that you 're just going to fail is a ** massive ** overexaggeration . 
  it 's way too early to make such a decision . 
  you definitely need to step up your game regarding reflections , but any reasonable cas coordinator would allow you to catch up . 
  his eso review was the first time i came across him . 
  i now actively avoid him . 
  god he is infuriating , and such a bad reviewer . 
  oh god i fucking hate the coles ads . 
  i try to avoid coles when i can , and go to woolies instead , just because of the damn ads . 
  both have shitty business practices , and price differences are basically nill , but just those fucking ads . 
  hell even their food is n't that overpriced . 
  that is , it 's definitely not * more * overpriced than the other cinemas . 
  there are n't any within reasonable distance of me . 
  i definitely agree with famoushippo . 
  i generally like to start campaigns * in media res * , at least to some extent . 
  i have them all be in some situation where they are forced , at least at first , to act together . 
  for example , they 're all taking a cart ride between towns ( for their own individual reasons ) , when the cart gets attacked , so they have to work together to defend it . 
  force them to act together at first , and use that as a hook for a larger plot that they can work together on . 
  it works well since if the characters do n't otherwise have a reason to work together , this gives them one . 
  alternatively , if the characters have worked together to integrate their backstories with each other and with the campaign , or if it is a party 's second campaign , more elaborate and subtle openings become possible . 
  most characters i 've seen have always used a focus . 
  thematically a staff/wand/orb is nearly always going to be a cooler option than a pouch of materials , though obviously this does depend on the specific character idea . 
  i 'm guessing that by `` phen never '' you meant to say `` phenomenon '' ? 
  if so , u definitely agree . 
  not just the duel of the fates . 
  the whole soundtrack . 
  `` across the stars '' has to be one of the most amazing love themes in cinema ( and an awesome punny name to boot ! ) . 
  it made me want to actually get invested in their romance despite the less than awesome acting and dialogue . 
  and the subtle shift from anakin 's theme into vader 's theme is just excellent . 
  are there coma theories for avatar or young justice ? 
  they 're my two favourite animated shows , and i do n't think i 've really heard * any * fan theories about them . 
  yeah it 's exactly why , as much as i love comic book characters , i do n't read * any * . 
  comics . 
  i refuse to put up with that bullshit . 
  i 'll stick here with my arrowverse , mcu , and a few cartoons ( i miss young justice ... ) , instead . 
  yeah but it 's their characters that i love . 
  that 's the problem . 
  hey thanks , well run to you . 
  i hope you continue to stick around and be involved !, 
  oh god that 's brilliant . 
  damn phone never autocorrects when i actually * want * it to ... 
  iga is * expensive * . 
  they 're great because they 're open till midnight , so i sometimes go there if i need something too late to go to woolies or coles , but i 'd rather avoid them otherwise just because of price . 
  seriously , it 's so fucking easy to do it better than this . 
  i 'm not a security expert by any means , but i 'm designing a little website just to get a little experience , and even in that storing passwords with salted hashes is literally as easy as using a single in-built function . 
  i 'm sure it 's not quite as secure as what one would * hope * a company like tpg would use , but it 's a thousand times better than just storing it in god damn plain text . 
   natalie portman , hayden christensen, 
  were they `` veteran '' actors before the star wars prequels ? 
  i do n't really know christensen from anything other than sw , and i do n't know portman from anything earlier than sw . 
  i mean , i 'm sure they had other roles before star wars , but compared to jackson with , among other things , pulp fiction , and lee who was the definitive dracula , a bond villain , and was in the wicker man , i 'd hardly have called portman and christensen veteran actors before sw . 
  wait why does that timeline not exist ? 
  and also our very own diggle being put into comics recently . 
  i dunno if i 'd say he 's barely in yj . 
  he 's not in it nearly as much as he 's in jlu , sure , but he 's the mentor to one of the original three members of the team , and he shows up a fair bit in the two roys arc . 
   the original three are robin , kid flash and aqualad, 
  my bad . 
  no it 's not .
