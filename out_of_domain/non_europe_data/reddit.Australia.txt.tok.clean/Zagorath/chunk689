  the broken window fallacy is claiming that breaking the window in order to have it repaired is a net benefit to * society * , because it increases economic activity etc. 
  the comment you replied to is claiming that this would be a net benefit to the cartographer only . 
  that 's like if you talked about the broken window and it being a benefit to the window maker : which it would be . 
  i do n't have an apple watch , but this is n't a problem i 've ever had with normal watches or my garmin forerunner . 
  in fact , i do n't think i 've ever heard of anybody having that problem . 
  i think you might be a little bit crazy . 
  i do the opposite , but then i 'm a lefty , so it makes sense to reverse it . 
  yeah bran is n't in this season . 
  yeah not at all . 
  they pretty much caught up with the books in the season 4 finale , and with so many other stories to work on , they 've put bran on the backburner this season . 
  unless they decide to do some sort of big surprise in the last scene of the last episode or something ( and i doubt they will ) , you will literally not see isaac hempstead wright on screen this season . 
  did they ? 
  i thought those that were on the boats got away safely ? 
  i was afraid he had command of some sort of sea monster . 
  nah man , [ it 's the emus you want ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emu_war ) . 
  they 've never lost a war . 
   if a certain equation is n't true, 
  yeah . 
  if it turns out that e ^ ( i\u03c0 ) ! = -1 , we might have to rethink a whole lot of stuff . 
  yeah but the comment i replied to seemed to be implying that her kids also got killed . 
  perhaps confusing the shot of the kids that ended up killing * her * with * being * her children , i guess ? 
   i think the other giants got lost at the cgi budget meeting, 
  honestly in the first few scenes in hardhome , i had no idea it was going to end up being a massive ( presumably expensive ) battle scene later on . 
  the angles they were shooting the giant at made me think `` huh , this is clever , using forced perspective and stuff so that they do n't have to use cgi or make this episode too costly . 
  and then suddenly , there he was wandering around with the giant fucking stick wrecking shit . 
  did n't help that i 've just recently watched some videos about how lotr used forced perspective with the hobbits . 
  it 's tenuous , but i 'll allow it this time . 
  maybe they 've edited it since you read the page , but paget brewster is in there . 
  is `` oscar '' referring to the academy awards , or is there a famous character named oscar known for lying ? 
  i graduated from fighting with sticks into taking up sport fencing . 
  it 's pretty damn fun . 
  alternatively , you could take up hema ( historical european martial arts ) if that 's more your thing . 
  perhaps the rules are different in other places , but where i am , shortening the yellow light really should n't make any differencre to the number of tickets -- at least according to the rules . 
  yellow means that you * must * stop if it is safe to do so . 
  you 're not supposed to decide `` hmm ... i think i can make this before it turns red , so i 'll keep going '' , or speed up to make it through . 
  the rule is simple : if you * can * stop without having the person behind you rear-end you , you should . 
  so a shorter yellow light period makes no difference , legally , and if you catch anyone extra , well it 's probably because they actually were breaking the rules before . 
  i have a cousin who got himself out of a speeding ticket because the cop did n't follow the procedure . 
  he * knew * he was speeding , but he took it to court anyway and won . 
  the same guy , on a different occasion , managed to use some legal trick or something to delay the time the ticket came into effect , so that his demerit points would reset and he would n't lose his license for it . 
   i have been detained for hours by the chinese border police because i fucked up bad with my visa and was meant to be fined about 4,000 rmb ( 700 usd approx ) but then they let me go cos i kept saying how sorry i was for the inconvenience i caused . 
  like they kinda just gave up . 
  oh man ... there is * no way * that shit would go down in vietnam ( where i used to live ) . 
  then again , they 'd probably end up `` letting you go '' for a usd $ 200 bribe or something ... 
  it 's not even a daenerys thing . 
  it 's a daenerys that one time thing . 
  i think s06e01 was the first day of the * semester * . 
  based on the dean 's comment about how he went a semester without wearing silly costumes . 
  they used it once last episode , too , but it was bleeped . 
  [ this was also submitted here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 385f9n/anon _ plays_a_necromancer_xpost_from_r4chan / ) on / r/dndgreentext , if anyone 's interested . 
  aww man ... 
  so it 's gon na be a us exclusive ? 
  amazon is crap internationally . 
  i can only buy a few really popular books from then where i am , and they always advertise with `` free shipping '' then when i go to checkout they want to charge $ 20 shipping , and also only then reveal that the price they were displaying was usd , so the price of the actual item increases , too . 
  their non-book stock is basically non-existent here . 
  ebay , on the other hand , is a truly global company where i can buy pretty much anything for usually the cheapest price available . 
  so it 's no wonder that they 're more profitable on the whole . 
  they have a much larger customer base that they actually serve . 
  and , fwiw , i 'm not in some out there eastern european or south east asian country where you might expect amazon 's service to be less thorough . 
  i 'm in australia . 
  [ betteridge 's law of headlines ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines ) . 
  not according to the pages linked by u/linkunseen , they 're not . 
  to be honest i 've never noticed any significant cultural influence from judaism here . 
  i do n't think i know any jews , and i ca n't say i 've ever come into contact with jewish culture outside of stuff gleamed from references in american film and television . 
   they have enough influence to determine the major parties views on israel, 
  i always put that down to the majority of australian foreign policy ( outside of that directly concerning the south pacific and south-east asia ) being heavily influenced by that of the united states .

  i , zagorath , do solemnly and sincerely affirm and declare that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to our sovereign , their heirs and successors according to law .

  his name is pretty easy to find in the history of his wikipedia article . 
  ( he 's the one that removed it and his username makes it clear which one 's him . ), 
  i wish to express my grateful thanks for the high honour that has been bestowed on me by the house . 
  i actually thought the felicity flashback episode was a high point as far as technology goes in this show . 
  not because it was actually good , but because despite a heavy focus on technology , i did n't think it was any * worse * than any other episode . 
  not uncropped , wider angle . 
  they 're two separate photos taken at different focal lengths . 
  yeah , and to be honest , just based on the thumbnail , it seems like disney had a pretty reasonable case in this situation . 
  disney has pushed copyright way further than it should ever reasonably go , but in this trademark case i think they were in the right . 
  nonsense !, 
  to do a triathlon , especially one like the iron man , one must be able to exhibit the peak of physical endurance . 
  in truth , i do n't believe there is a master race , because all of these different events test different aspects of human physicality . 
  there 's no large-scale event greater than the iron man for endurance , but all the other common events have their place , too . 
  ( though why you talk about the 1600 m is beyond me . 
  1500 is the standard race . ), 
  the decathlon is n't a race by any measure of the term . 
  it 's 10 completely separated events , and performance in one event has near zero effect on the others . 
  it is n't like the biathlon where a poor shooting performance means you have to ski more ( or get a time penalty ) , but ultimately the shortest time wins . 
  do n't get me wrong , it 's a great event . 
  it 's just not a `` race '' . 
  [ apparently it is a headline ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/07/asia/mh370-theories/ ) , more or less . 
  [ there 's also this ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/mh370-one-year_n_6801636.html ) , though it does n't actually * end * in a question mark . 
  it 's * especially * applicable to new projects , if you look at it the right way . 
  what is the `` card system '' ? 
  i played 4e for a year : it was my first d&d system , but i never encountered this card system -- to my knowledge , anyway . 
  and yet i 've seen references to it on here quite frequently . 
  yeah , all my high school english was reading texts ( both fiction -- poems , plays , and novels -- and non-fiction -- mostly news articles and the like ) and analysing them for things like themes and rhetoric devices . 
  have n't learnt any grammar stuff since primary school , and definitely never did this tree thing .
