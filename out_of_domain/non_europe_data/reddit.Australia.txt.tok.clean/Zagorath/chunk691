  not always like that , of course , but sometimes . 
  i really , really like this arrangement . 
  it 's not the most faithful to the source material , but clearly that was n't the intention , and it 's close enough most of the time anyway . 
  before i give any feedback , i have a couple of questions . 
  what programme did you use to notate this/get the sounds out of it ? 
  and would you like some better computer-generated sounds ? 
  ( because i know i would !, 
  i loved the composition , but the sounds felt lackluster , even for computer generated ones . ), 
  i only have a few bits of feedback on the actual score :, 
  * in the stark theme at the beginning bars 10 and 15 ( and more later ) use a dotted quaver -- semiquaver pattern . 
  most of the time , that motif uses a simple quaver pattern . 
  in the actual track that bit is imitating ( goodbye brother ) there 's more of a `` turn '' used . 
  to me , either keeping the straight quavers the stark theme normally has , or putting in the whole turn would be better . 
  the simple dotted quaver -- semiquaver pattern does n't feel right . 
  * is there a reason you did n't shift to 12/8 time at bar h ( the throne is mine ) . 
  the `` throne theme '' would fit better in that time signature without needing the triplets , and it would have no effect on the lannister scheming theme that makes up the rest of the track ( just change the quavers to dotted quavers ) . 
  * the bit where you used the rains of castamere felt too rushed to me , but the mostly empty bar right before p felt too long . 
  i 'd suggest slowing the tempo there slightly , and making that one bar a 2/4 or 3/4 one . 
  * i 'm also guessing that you do n't have access to any more percussion ? 
  the original version of a lannister always pays his debts really benefits from the heavy low percussion instruments , but if you only have access to timps , there 's not much you can do about that . 
  * from an actual notational standpoint , this is near perfect . 
  i would only suggest that you make the conductor 's score transposing ( so the instruments appear as written , rather than at concert pitch ) . 
  in sibelius this is as simple as a single button press , but i 'm not sure how you would go about it in other programmes . 
  i would also suggest that on the second and all subsequent pages , shortened versions of the instruments ' names should appear to the left of their staff . 
  for example `` vln . 
  1 '' next to the first violins , and `` cl . '', 
  next to the clarinet . 
  this is really helpful for a conductor so that they can see at a glance which part is which , and know who to cue . 
  again , i suspect you 're not using sibelius , since i know it would have set that up for you . 
  not sure how you can go about it in any other programme . 
  as you can see , all of these problems are really minor nitpicking . 
  i think you 've done an absolutely fantastic job here . 
  my most significant bit of feedback would be that i 'm not sure a lannister always pays his debts is the best track to use to get the rains of castamere into the score . 
  it might just be the awful digital sounds that 's giving me this opinion , but it seems to me that the ensemble you 've got might benefit from something that just plays the rains straight , like an arrangement of [ this piano version ] ( https://musescore.com/user/44335/scores/62661 ) , or perhaps [ this one ] ( http://en.everyonepiano.cn/stave-3547-1-the-rains-of-castamere-game-of-thrones-ost-stave-preview-1.html ) or similar . 
  but that 's entirely subjective , and i 'm not really sure just how effective it would be without hearing it first . 
  on an unrelated topic , i like your slightly faster rendition of beethoven 's sonata no . 
  14 , though personally [ i prefer it faster still ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw_dv_gnqao ) . 
   there 's not necessarily anything wrong with olicity, 
  yeah i agree . 
  i actually thought the way olicity was handled in the last four episodes of this season ( apart from the awkwardly long sex scene -- that really should have faded to black way earlier than it did ) was really good . 
  i think it 's mainly because of how terribly it was handled earlier in the season that people 's negative opinions were still there even when it was done better . 
  but we definitely need to lay the blame for the atrocity that was the first 19 episodes this season on someone , and the showrunner seems like the most logical place . 
  if it makes any difference , the version i 'm offering is still not good enough to show up any real orchestra , even a mediocre one . 
  i just have the built-in sounds in the full version of sibelius . 
  i have n't got a clue how to use proper daw software to get something better out of it . 
  how familiar are you with the actual motifs and what they refer to in got ? 
  my last comment was assuming you 'd be fully familiar with the different themes , and this one does as well , but if not , i can explain a little more . 
  anyway , regarding the stark theme , you see how in bars 10 and 15 , on the last beat , it has a dotted quaver and then a semiquaver ? 
  most of the time , when we hear the stark theme in the show , those would just be two quavers , [ like so ] ( http://imgur.com/rybwt9b ) . 
  the rhythm is the same as you have in bars 12 and 17 . 
  however , in the track `` goodbye brother '' there 's a turn or something , [ this is how i might notate it ] ( http://imgur.com/jqwcwi3 ) in a hurry . 
  either one of those would work better , imo , than the dotted quaver - semiquaver pattern you currently have . 
   lannister theme : i actually did not use rains of castamere and that 's probably why . 
  i 'm not entirely sure to what you refer here . 
  if you 're talking about this :, 
   it would have no effect on the lannister scheming theme, 
  then i should point out that i was actually referring to [ this theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-raqy1neom ) ( the one played on the dulcimer here , also [ this track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=utvosybbg68#t=74s ) at 1:14 , or [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh6acdwnlyk ) at 2:12 on the dulcimer , and then the full string seciton at 2:32 ) , not rains . 
  in season 1 in particular , that theme was heavily associated with the lannisters , though later on it became more of a general scheming motif ( with possibly an association with littlefinger ) . 
  if you were referring to this :, 
   the bit where you used the rains of castamere felt too rushed to me, 
  then i would point out that when i say `` the rains of castamere '' , i 'm not talking about the actual track on the soundtrack album named `` the rains of castamere '' . 
  i 'm referring to the melodic content of that track that gets used all over game of thrones ' soundtrack , including being the main motif of a lannister always pays his debts . 
  basically , `` rains of castamere '' is the name of one of the motifs , in the same way that `` stark theme '' or `` throne theme '' refer to their own motifs . 
  but anyway , your reasoning for using that rendition of the rains theme rather than just the straight out song is a good one . 
  having the song by itself in the middle of a piece like this probably would be awkward . 
  regarding the percussion , that 's unfortunate . 
  how does sibelius first handle instrument changes ? 
  can you have the one staff change from timps onto bass drum or similar ? 
  but yeah , to write out that percussion section in full there would be quite a challenge , and impossible without more staves . 
   and i unfortunately can not afford sibelius 7.5, 
  neither can i. 
  yet i still use it , 
  [ i found this an absolutely fascinating read when i first came across it ] ( / r/asoiaf/comments / 1bulzc/musical _ themes_and_motifs_in_ramin_djawadis_score / ) . 
  both the main post and the two other parts submitted by op in the comments . 
  i figured you might , too . 
  regarding the beethoven , i 'd highly suggest listening to the link i provided . 
  it 's one of [ a series of lectures andras schiff gave on the beethoven sonatas ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/music/classical/page/0,,1943867,00.html ) ( he 's actually done one for each of beethoven 's piano sonatas ) . 
  the whole series is really good , though he can be very rigid in his beliefs -- it gives the impression that he thinks any other interpretation is wrong , which does n't seem entirely fair . 
  but many of his insights are certainly worth listening to . 
  but the tl ; dl version of the moonlight one is basically that the first movement really should be played a * lot * faster than most people play it . 
  and his reasoning is kinda hard to argue with . 
  [ here 's my rendition of it inspired by schiff 's lecture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80zmsda5q8q ) . 
  unfortunately the piece * really * suffers on the electric piano , since you ca n't half pedal , and you lose all the beautiful sympathetic resonances that make this piece so rich on a real piano . 
  but personally , i feel the faster tempo really brings out the main melody so much better than that really slow tempo at which it is usually played , which is why i liked your rendition of it so much . 
  telltale video game seems more fitting , i think . 
  long ago , the four classes lived together in harmony ? 
  i agree with everyone else here that the player rolls and custom alignments are kinda lame , but i personally think that the vitality part is really interesting . 
  i 've only really quickly read through it so far and have n't considered all its potential consequences , but i definitely plan to read it much closer and consider how it might affect my games . 
  still disappointing that that 's the only thing we 've gotten out of this month 's ua , though . 
  the new article is pretty damn disappointing , but guys , we should at least upvote op for this . 
  people are going to want to see it , if just to know that it 's out . 
  otherwise people will get confused about where it is . 
  it is n't op 's fault that the content is lame . 
  but anyway , i 'll repeat my comment from the / r/dndnext thread :,

  edit : just want to point out that when i wrote this comment , the thread was at only 75 % upvoted . 
  it seemed more necessary at the time than it is now . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , the first thing i did when i opened this page was ctrl-f `` star wars '' , and i was disappointed that i did n't get any results .
