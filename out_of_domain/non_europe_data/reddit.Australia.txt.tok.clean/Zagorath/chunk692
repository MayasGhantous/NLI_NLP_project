  glad to see that other people made the same connection i did , and that i was just searching for the wrong particular phrase . 
  god dammit . 
  you 're telling me * both * the shows i watch with a name of the form '' [ x ] of [ y ] '' have shakespearean influences , and specifically macbeth ? 
  leningrad is today known as saint petersburg . 
  stalingrad was a city that was the site of a siege during world war ii . 
  the city is now known as volgograd . 
  i ca n't tell how serious you are , but i 'll respond as if you 're being completely serious , just in case . 
  it 's a humorous hypothetical justification for why the ua this month was lacking . 
  sounds like you 're playing as if alignment in 5e is the same as way back in 3.5 or earlier . 
  it 's not . 
  they fixed the nature of alignment in 4e , and brought that forward with improvements ( namely reintroducing the 3x3 grid rather than a line of 5 alignments ) to 5e . 
  it is purely descriptive , not prescriptive . 
  that is to say that it is * not * hypocritical or in any way wrong if a person has a few traits that conflict with their alignment , because alignment * only * serves to * describe * how the person will * generally * act . 
  it does not specify how they will act in any specific situation . 
  similarly , paladins have no alignment rules or restrictions . 
  sure , they will * generally * be good ( lawful good for oath of devotion , chaotic good for oath of vengeance , etc. 
  ) , but they do n't * have * to be . 
  spells like detect good/evil also do n't detect * anyone 's * alignment . 
  they are specifically for detecting devils/demons and their influences , rather than anything that 's evil . 
  using detect evil with tywin lannister in the room would not do anything , for example . 
  conspiracy theory . 
  the reason it 's dated 3 days ( or 5 months , if you prefer a saner dating system ) in the future is that * that 's * when the * real * one will be released . 
  this is a fake to trick us , or maybe to tide us over until the real one comes out . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ believe ^ ^ ^ ^ this , ^ ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ wish ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ were ^ ^ ^ ^ true . 
  i like your theory . 
  it seems pretty likely . 
  but i 'm confused why you chose to say it twice in the same comment . 
  in addition to being the guy that killed syrio , he was basically joffrey 's head enforcer . 
  he 's the one that slapped sansa when joffrey said his mother told him `` a king should never strike his lady '' ( s01e10 ) , and he 's the guy that repeatedly strikes her and rips her clothes before tyrion enters to stop him in front of the whole court . 
  ( s02e04, 
  i only know this because i only recently started a rewatch of the whole series . 
  that 's definitely true . 
  however , in the case of house of cards ( the other show i was referring to ) the influence is * very * direct . 
  even more so in the british series from the 90s than the recent american remake , but even the us version has some very strong parallels to things like macbeth . 
  and / u/thebochman pointed out the parallels in got with stannis 's storyline and the scottish play . 
  it 's not quite as clear cut as hoc , but it 's fairly interesting nonetheless . 
  say what you will about the movie as a whole ( and i 'll certainly agree with most of it ) , but that particular scene was awesome . 
  also worth being aware that for anyone who has seen the latest episode of the show , there are zero spoilers . 
  the title was somewhat misleading . 
  by that metric , every programme ever succeeds , because no error in code is ever * not * because of what the programmer ( or the programmers of some third-party software that gets used , like libraries or even the compiler/interpreter ) put in there . 
  talking about how a programme `` failed '' is saying it did n't work as it was * intended * , not that it did n't work as it was programmed . 
  to make it code , you have to prefix every line with four spaces :, 
  if `` account age '' not in things_to_check :, 
  write_program ( ), 
  is what you were looking for . 
  this is a stupid argument . 
  to extend the same logic , no programme * ever * fails , because they * all * do what their programmer ( combined with the programmers of any external libraries and the compiler or interpreter ) wrote they should do . 
  what someone means when they say a `` programme failed '' is that it did not perform the * function * it was * intended * to complete . 
   maybe grrm told them something about his plans for stannis that caused this, 
  the [ `` inside the episode '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nflscjvxbhq ) that they released for this episode confirmed that the idea did indeed come from martin himself . 
  however , the way it 's worded , it * could * be that martin only mentioned it specifically for the show based on how other things in the show had been done . 
  to me that seems less likely than the idea that he also intends to do it in the books , but it is a possibility . 
   if we 're being nitpicky , not `` every line '' but every line in a new condition, 
  no , reddit 's syntax requires it * every * line in order to display as a < code  block in html . 
  so to make the python syntax display correctly , the first line needs four spaces in front of it , and the second ( the one that needs to be displayed indented in your example ) needs 8 . 
   yet he does n't even show remorse, 
  [ i would n't go * quite * that far . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/nwim0 ) he 's clearly too far gone to be saved now , but it definitely was n't an * easy * decision for him . 
  even before those two screenshots , he 's clearly not happy about it . 
  he looked like he was * so * stern it was n't real . 
  like he was having to mentally convince himself that what he was doing was right . 
  was n't there some other utility type app on android that apple bought ? 
  or am i just thinking of the beats music app ( which i 'm guessing is being re-branded to apple music now ? 
  i have n't watched the wwdc keynote yet . 
  yeah same , i have no plans of switching , but an increase in mobility between the various ecosystems can * only * be a good thing . 
  well fuck me . 
  i actually read over the comment two or three times * before * i saw your comment , and i * still * misread it until i read your comment ... 
  this is * pure * speculation . 
  i have n't looked at the app at all , and i have n't used an ios device since my ipod touch 3rd gen running ios 4 . 
  but apple has pop-up notifications on apps requesting permissions to various things ( like android finally will with m ) . 
  i 'd guess that accessing your icloud data is one such thing that the app could request . 
  since the user has to explicitly grant it permission at the time the app uses it , that does n't seem too dangerous to me . 
  perhaps i was wrong , but when i read the comment you replied to , i did n't think they were talking about audio quality when they said `` quality '' . 
  i thought they were talking about things like reliability of streaming and availability of a wide enough variety of pieces . 
   in 2015 , we still have services tied to a phone number, 
  a lot of people seem to like this . 
  it 's one of the reasons i * hate * and refuse to use whatsapp , and i keep a separate app for my smses . 
  i want to keep my sms messaging and my over-the-internet messaging completely separate , and i want to know * exactly * which one i will be using and when . 
  using your phone number as your id in an app that sends messages over the internet rather than using sms is just a terrible way to go about things , in my opinion . 
  but it 's the reason people love whatsapp , imessage , and even -- at least if my memory serves me correctly -- hangouts . 
  give me a username and i 'll consider your service . 
  my phone number is for fucking * phone * stuff . 
  my guess is that the more accurate translation did n't fit as nicely into the rhyme and rhythm of the song , and that the one they went with does . 
  the prequels are an example of a lot of really brilliant ideas with just about the worst possible execution . 
  i think the idea of doing trade negotiations and showing political stuff ( look at the success of shows like house of cards or game of thrones ! ), 
  are not bad ones at all . 
  i fucking love political shit , and had it been done well in the star wars prequels , that could have been * awesome * in that universe . 
  it was not , however , done well even the slightest bit . 
  midichlorians are fine . 
  i do n't get the hate for them . 
  seems kinda dumb to me , really . 
  just a way for people to further express their already existing hatred for the prequels . 
  if the rest of the prequels had been good , people would have never had any criticism of midichlorians . 
  they 're certainly not a * good * thing , but there 's nothing bad about them either . 
  note sure what you mean by space-jesus conception . 
  i just assume padme and anakin had sex at some point . 
  there 's no reason the films should have shown us that . 
  it 's been a long time since i watched any of the sw films though , and if you were talking about some other conception , i do n't remember which one it could be . 
  jar jar binks was stupid . 
  but i never said there were only good ideas in the prequels .
