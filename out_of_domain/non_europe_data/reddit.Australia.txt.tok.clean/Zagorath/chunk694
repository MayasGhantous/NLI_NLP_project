  it makes them very unique in flavour as well as mechanics . 
  that 's a really interesting way to go about it . 
  did she know in advance that anakin would end up becoming vader ? 
  and did she know that luke and leia were anakin and padme 's children ? 
  ( i ca n't remember if we hear their names at the end of episode iii . ), 
  because going in to it without those pieces of knowledge would give a completely different perspective on it , that i think would be very interesting . 
  and while it would be nigh impossible to not have heard about vader 's '' * i * am your father '' line , knowing that anakin * is * vader is probably less pervasive in general culture . 
  present, 
  hey , sorry for the absense . 
  i had meant to move that in the absense of any further nominations , we accept both nominees in their respective positions . 
  but i wanted to wait a couple of days first in case any others came up . 
  and then when that time had passed , i had completely forgotten about it . 
  in the absense of any further nominations , i move that we accept / u/voteronaldraygun as deputy speaker and / u/voisinat as second deputy speaker , on the basis of their previous nominations for the posts . 
  zagorath [ ag ] , speaker of the house, 
  yeah , i 'm from queensland . 
  does n't help that i grew up in vietnam , where `` winter '' does n't even get nearly as cold as it does here in brisbane . 
  i never keep the heat on , for what it 's worth . 
  usually have it on for about half an hour before i go to sleep , and/or while i 'm in the shower , so that i can go to bed in comfort , and come out of the shower to something not freezing . 
  it does n't stay on all night , and definitely not during the day . 
  i did n't really have * that * much of a problem with mance , but holy shit this episode was just awful . 
  i decided to rewatch the episode but i just could n't keep going . 
  it was just so painful i had to stop around the time stannis started talking to her . 
  eh , i suspect most people who are n't canadian probably had to google that . 
  i mean , unless you happen to be australian , if i said that i need to `` invest in my super '' , you probably would n't know what i mean , either . 
  and yet any australian over the age of about 16 would probably understand me , even if they are n't actually yet concerned with superannuation . 
   i 've done a couple of monkeys and a few dogs . 
  not in the biblical sense , of course . 
  but thanks for the link , that was a great read . 
  seems reasonable to me that any member would be able to make a post . 
  / u/paulyt86 , would you like to complete the tasks described by the clerk in the post above ? 
   townsville ~ ~ was ~ ~ is a bit backward ~ ~ about the whole thing ~ ~, 
  ftfy , 
  i think op was going for the literal fuck-as-in-sex rather than the rhetorical fuck-as-in-break / destroy . 
   robb did practically everything in his power to avoid winning the war, 
  are you kidding ? 
  rob literally made * one * mistake . 
  sure , it was a pretty huge mistake that ended up costing him dearly , but every other military decision he made seemed very successful . 
  there 's absolutely nothing * just * about murdering a girl so young she ca n't have really even * known * sin . 
  he 's certainly still the better option of the two , but `` just '' is not a word i 'd even * begin * to use to describe him . 
  yeah i agree . 
  though i would also add that , if he could grow some fucking balls , tommen seems like he 's at least not a horrible ruler . 
  he 's bad because he 's weak , but i 'd take that over a tyrant any day . 
  yeah i agree . 
  though i would also add that , if he could grow some fucking balls , tommen seems like he 's at least not a horrible ruler . 
  he 's bad because he 's weak , but i 'd take that over a tyrant any day . 
  he 's also very young . 
  it 's not unreasonable that he may become much tougher as he ages and gains more experience . 
  yeah true . 
  it 's just the main area of interest to me . 
  telekinesis is also really awesome , and i 'd like to see it as well . 
  i 'll admit , i have n't read much about shaping , but from what i 've seen , it 's also pretty cool . 
  i 'd * like * to see all three of these schools , but telepathy is * essential * for me to be interested in it . 
  the elemental thing did n't exist in 4e , as far as i 'm aware ( i 've only read psionics stuff from phb3 and the psionic power supplement , so i do n't know if it was in any other books ) . 
  but to be honest , i do n't like the sound of it . 
  it sounds pointless , like it 's just wizardry or sorcery with a different source . 
  what 's the point of that ? 
  it 's from the dmg , as an alternate rule for spellcasting ( that even wizards etc. 
  could use ) . 
  but that 's the thing . 
  we can compare the two houses and decide which is the better of the two , but when deciding whether one person is `` just '' or not , we judge them solely on * their * actions . 
  one person being terrible does not make someone who is slightly less terrible just . 
  for me the one the really hurt was last episode . 
  the red wedding was shocking , sure , but the reactions of the characters were so much more muted . 
  same with the season 4 event : that one happened so fast the character had no time to react . 
  it just happened . 
  but in season 5 , all those screams were just so terrible . 
  i honestly do n't know if i 'll be able to rewatch that . 
  i tried a day after i first watched it , and i had to stop during the conversation the characters had prior to the event , just because of how horrible what it was that i knew was coming . 
  i mean , lady stark 's pleas for mercy were there , of course , but compared to the outright terror of last episode ... 
  i have n't followed this closely , but from a brief skim of the srd thread , i think the reason they were banned originally was to do with doxxing . 
  and the subsequent ones would be banned because it 's already against the rules to just create an alternate to get around a ban . 
  i would n't normally bother with the correction , but it 's brilliantly ironic since you corrected op earlier . 
  both times you said `` die '' in this comment , you meant `` dice '' . 
  the former is the singular , the latter the plural . 
  well the fact that they mentioned raid is probably because ... well , it 's a raid setup . 
  the 2x1 tb is referring to two 2 tb drives in a raid0 or raid1 configuration . 
  absolutely no reason that one would need to refer to which connection is being used , though . 
  google was willing to implement the technology required to * read * drm content . 
  that 's ** very ** different from them being the ones actively supporting the * creation * of it . 
  one is a good thing ( it allows customers to view content they 've paid for ) , the other is bad ( it is restricting where said content * can * be viewed ) . 
   this will miss some of the super-obscure videos with barely any views, 
  this wo n't miss the super-obscure videos , it will miss * most of the videos uploaded to youtube * . 
  you should be using radio buttons , not checkboxes , if only one option may be selected . 
  actually not tied , if you consider in-laws family . 
  [ s02 ] ( #s `` i agree fully that stannis was in the right earlier on . 
  in fact , had the tyrells not deserted him and joined the lannisters , he may have won the battle of the blackwater even with tywin 's arrival . '' ), 
  [ s05e09 ] ( #s `` that said , i 'm not sure i agree that stannis does n't want the throne . 
  i thought that , too , until the point where he was willing to sacrifice his only daughter * and heir * to get it . 
  edit : oh , just noticed the bit where you said `` until recently '' . 
  my eyes must have glanced over that the first time . '' ), 
  the question is put that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying aye or no . 
  the deadline for this vote will be 7:00 am est on sunday , 14th june .
