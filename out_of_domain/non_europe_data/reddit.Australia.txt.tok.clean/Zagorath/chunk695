  meta : right , so the format should be as follows ? 
  original motion, 
   putting the question, 
    paging, 
    votes, 
   ( maybe ? ), 
  possible amendment, 
    putting that the amendment be accepted, 
     paging for the amendment, 
     votes on the amendment, 
  i do n't get it . 
  what about the logo implies anything is growing strong ? 
   have votes as the same level as the pages, 
  that makes a lot more sense actually . 
  i 'm actually going to edit it because i like that a lot more . 
  but amendments as shown above already * are * direct comments . 
  is the other option that they be replies to the putting of the question ? 
   and little finger 's personal sigil is a mocking bird, 
  did you not read the commentary under each logo ? 
  the creator new this and decided they liked the `` chaos is a ladder '' speech so much that they used a ladder instead . 
  personally i would 've preferred the bird , but at least the person knew what they were doing and why . 
  maybe it 's daily because they go from the start of the day as far east as you go , to the end of the day as far west as you go , roughly speaking . 
  if that were the case , why would they give away an entire extra * meal * for free , when the alternative was to give away some sauce ? 
  having a lot of subdomains is the norm at universities . 
  at the very least you 're going to see [ school or faculty].[university].edu . [ country ] . 
  if they use www as well , that gives you 5 levels of domain as the * standard * . 
  edit : i ca n't count . 
   and without www ( foo.university.tld ) it does n't even work, 
  oh my god . 
  that really * is * horrible . 
  it 's just ... wow . 
  no words . 
  i do n't remember how many untrained she had , but yeah , they definitely say 8,000 trained , plus the untrained ones . 
  i 'd be surprised if more than 200 have died so far . 
   there might have been one or two hundred at the arena and basically all of them died, 
  really ? 
  it looked to me like most of them ended up in the circle protecting dany et al. , and that only a few died . 
  there did n't seem to be * that * many unsullied even at the event . 
  there were 8,000 fully trained unsullied that she bought . 
  add to that the untrained ones , but we do n't know how many of those there are , as far as i 'm aware . 
  and the way they were * described * is that they absolutely * are * elite fighters . 
  perhaps that 's wrong , and their reputation is undeserved/dany got oversold on them , but that is at least what we 've been told so far . 
  i do n't get why so many people are saying they were ineffective last episode . 
  sure , they had been incredibly useless prior to that , but last episode they finally stepped up their game . 
  once they got into their circle around dany et al. , not one of them died , and they managed to prevent anyone else that they were protecting from getting killed . 
  it was a toy stag , not a horse . 
  better symbolism . 
  she also asked him to make her a doe to match . 
  does n't everyone already hate olly ? 
  i think pretty much everyone even in other subs already knows olly 's going to go full retard . 
  renly was a pretender for the throne , despite stannis being the older brother of the two and therefore having * no * legitimate claim to the throne . 
  stannis also gave him fair warning `` surrender or you will be destroyed '' ( or words to that effect ) . 
  he killed shireen with * no * warning , and she was a girl so young she had never even had the * chance * to know sin . 
  she did n't even play the game of thrones , let alone play it in an immoral or dishonourable way . 
  the two situations are entirely unalike . 
  fwiw , i 'm pretty sure the two of them never got married . 
  so he 's more like her fianc\u00e9 than her husband . 
  the obvious answer is that their scales are n't as tough in young age as they would be when they 're fully grown . 
  but my head-canon is that just like the armour knights wear is fucking useless in this world , so are the scales of a dragon . 
  you can pierce through that shit really , really easily compared to what it would have been to kill a knight in medieval europe . 
  that 's because * copying * stuff was no where near as easy in 1908 . 
  heck , * stuff * that 's worth copying ( by which i mean intellectual property ) was no where near as widespread as it is today . 
  yeah that 's a good point . 
  this * may * be able to gain some serious traction even with the restrictions * if * it 's only the content creators that are restricted to america and the uk . 
  it 'll struggle when most of the world still ca n't share , but it 'll have a chance . 
  but if you ca n't even * view * it from elsewhere , it 's got fuck all chance . 
  has n't dany only burned like , three people ? 
  the magi one in s01e10 , the slavemaster right after she got control of the unsullied , and the noble earlier this season . 
  i ca n't think of any others . 
  it does n't count if the dragons do it of their own free will . 
  those are the only ones where * she * made it happen . 
  edit : just remembered another one . 
  i * think * she burned the warlock in qarth , did n't she ? 
  so that 's four . 
  i 'm not entirely sure how many stannis has burned . 
  i * imagine * it 's probably higher , but it might not be ... only 3 come to mind ( his in-law , the king beyond the wall , and his daughter ) , but i 'd be surprised if those were the only ones . 
  i 've never played another tomb raider game before , but i absolutely loved the latest tomb raider remake . 
  i really enjoyed the story . 
  i have heard , though , that if you 're a fan of the older games , this one 's a fair departure : some enjoy it , some did n't like it as much . 
  and aom is wicked . 
  consider the 4-pack if your friends do n't also already have it . 
  yeah this . 
  the title in that link ( and the brief description on the individual seasons ' links , e.g. 
  [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/community_ ( season_3 \\ ) ) ) are enough to jog my memory for which episode someone is talking about . 
  but also there are a few that i can just remember , and i imagine most people are the same . 
  remedial chaos theory , for example , and heroic origins . 
  [ try this one out ] ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1s2ejqlyq8qqlipk2otkodjygnvsmirt2jdigjftfara/viewform?usp=send_form ) . 
  see that it uses radio buttons ( which therefore only allow a single option ) , and if you view the answers , you 'll see that it has a pie chart . 
  in the google form creation page , this is made by setting the `` question type '' to `` multiple choice '' . 
  oh , right . 
  when you said something about in `` incoherent pie chart '' above , i thought you were talking about when you get multiple options for a question when it should only have one . 
  but anyway , you really should n't let google display of the results over-ride the best form design . 
  the actual experience for the user * inputting data * into the form should be the number one priority . 
  if you want a bar graph of the results , take the spreadsheet of the raw data from the results and create a bar graph from that yourself . 
  there are n't any `` archons '' in the monster manual . 
  or if there are , i ca n't find them . 
  create your own keyboard layout . 
  i do it anyway , since my day-to-day typing is done on dvorak , but i programme using my own customised `` coder 's dvorak '' ( loosely based on * the * `` programmer dvorak '' ) .
