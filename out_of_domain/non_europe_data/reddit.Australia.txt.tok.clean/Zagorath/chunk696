  it 's optimised mainly for c-like languages , so $ is n't very well placed , but one could easily rearrange things for different programming languages . 
  i know you said it 's difficult , but it really , really is the best option . 
  alternatively , if you have your own domain ( and hosting ) , or if an html page transported around on a usb is a viable option for you , you could create a really simple web page similar to [ this one for dvorak , but for your preferred custom layout ] ( http://www.theworldofstuff.com/dvorak/dvorak.html ) as a temporary measure when using computers that you * ca n't * adequately set up . 
  the code is pretty easy to read , so should n't be too hard to adapt . 
  as a side note '' ` 4 ` requires the index finger '' . 
  does it ? 
  i 've always been terrible at touch-typing numbers , but trying it just now that feels really awkward even without the shift key . 
  i type 3 , 4 , 8 , and 9 with my middle finger . 
  it feels so much more natural to me . 
  yup . 
  looks like he was in character , too ( from the later seasons ) . 
  since you 're trying to be aussie , you should know that that was a 160 kilometre trip , and you were practi * s * ing saying no . 
  my course in c programming was imo really well set up . 
  a * lot * of the marking was done automatically . 
  functionality was done using a large suite of tests , a subset of which ( containing the most obvious cases ) was available to students before the deadline . 
  style was marked with a combination of an automated checker ( also available -- in full -- well ahead of the deadline ) for what can be easily done ahead of time and manual checking for what the actual variables and functions were named and more general coding style . 
  we were taught about various options , but told that for assignments , a specific style guide was to be adheared to . 
  opening braces on the same line , after a single space , variable names underscored , function names camel case . 
  to me , all that is a perfect approach . 
  the only thing that i thought was dumb was a hard rule of no lines with more than 80 characters ( i 've had other courses where a general `` try to keep lines under 80 characters , but it 's not a hard rule '' approach was taken , which i think is much more reasonable ) , and even worse , a rule of no functions with more than 50 lines . 
  this lead to an awful lack of comments and whitespace , imo , but ah well . 
  edit : [ found someone who uploaded the style guide ] ( https://github.com/kunavarion/csse2310/blob/master/csse2310%20c%20style%20guide.pdf ) ( as well as assignment specs ) , for some further clarification . 
  i think python is great because it makes teaching the most basic features of programming like variables , functions , conditionals , loops , and recursion really easy , without getting bogged down by data types and the like . 
  it also enforces good programming style from the very beginning . 
  but it should n't be too long before students are introduced to something with stricter types and the like , such as c or java . 
  the way my uni does it :, 
  * year one ( either semester 1 or 2 , does n't matter ) is python . 
  * year 2 semester 1 is a course on java oop and one on very low level stuff ( over half the course is completely non-programming , just working with logic gates , flip flops , etc. ), 
  involving some assembly and a little c. 
  * y2s2 is more in-depth c , focussing on slightly more advanced features like multi-processes , multi-threading , and network applications . 
  there 's also a course that 's * supposed * to teach programming in large groups , where the entire class ( we had a little over 200 students when i did it ) works on a single project ( ours was essentially an mmo ) using git . 
  a worthy aim with a really important goal , but it was really poorly set up as an actual project . 
  that was in java . 
  * in y2s2 most software engineering students also take an algorithms and data structures course in java , though it 's technically listed as a third year course . 
   well i think it 's pretty clear that if we get a cw green lantern it 's going to be hal, 
  yeah , the evidence they 've presented has been pretty overwhelmingly pointing at that . 
  which is a shame , imo , because turning diggle into `` john stewart diggle '' would have been so cool . 
  but ah well . 
   this cause confusion for me since marvel has such a connected universe with the movies and tv series but at the same time othe franchises as spiderman , xmen and early fantastic 4 had nothing to do with the avengers universe, 
  i find it very interesting that you know enough about the comics lore to know the original background of scarlet witch and quicksilver , but you * did n't * know ahead of time that the marvel cinematic universe was separate from the x-men universe . 
  i would never have heard of those two characters were it not for avengers 2 , but i 've known for ages that marvel has a number of different universes . 
  namely : mcu , x-men , the older fantastic 4 , and the two different iterations of spider man . 
  just so you know , they 're rebooting spidey again , and the new one will be part of the mcu . 
  i agree with / u/vanguardwarden . 
  crawford 's clarification is clarifying what the * intended * rule was . 
  but to me , the rule as it is actually written is pretty clearly two-way . 
  not only based on the description related to telepathy , but because the word `` communicate '' implies a two-way thing , to me . 
  that was n't swearing , he wrote out his password , like so : *******, 
  for what it 's worth , i put off watching the bbc sherlock for a * long * time because i had seen the downey jr. . sherlock and it was absolutely terrible . 
  i just figured the bbc one would also be terrible because of that . 
  eventually people managed to convince me to watch the bbc one , and i 'm glad they did because it 's fantastic , but there certainly was some form of interference -- if not * confusion * per se -- between the two . 
  curious as to why you put both hong kong and china as `` country of residence '' options . 
  actually , your list of countries is just bizarre in general . 
  lithuania ? 
  more people live in two out of the * cities * i 've lived in than that country ( with the third being only slightly behind it at around 2.10 m versus lithuania 's 2.96 m ) , and yet you included it . 
  you also * did n't * include taiwan , which , considering you * did * include hong kong , i can only assume was either a really bizarre oversight , or politically motivated . 
  south korea and china but no neighbouring japan ? 
  spain but no portugal or italy ? 
  i might just be missing it because of mental fatigue , but as far as i can tell there is n't a single country from the middle east or northern africa . 
  it 's like ... did you just pick a random selection out of a hat ? 
  it makes * no * sense . 
  in the future , i 'd suggest finding a list somewhere and copy pasting it . 
  i just googled `` survey country list '' and found a number of good options . 
  obviously use a drop down menu rather than radio buttons . 
  google forms ' editor is smart enough to take a multi-lined string from your clipboard and paste it into multiple options in a drop down answer question . 
   i would have stared her in the face at trial and while on stand say `` i should have let you die . '', 
  i saved your worthless life . 
  i should have let the water kill you . 
  order !, 
  do you wish to confess ? 
  yes , your honour , i 'm guilty . 
  guilty , is that what you want to hear ? 
  you admit you paralysed the plaintiff ? 
  no , of that i 'm innocent . 
  i 'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime . 
  i 'm guilty of being a doctor . 
  you are not on trial for being a doctor . 
  oh , yes i am . 
  i have been on trial for that since i graduated med school . 
  have you nothing to say in your defence ? 
  nothing but this . 
  i did not do it . 
  i did not let the plaintiff drown , but i wish that i had . 
  watching that bitch die would have given me more relief than a thousand lying whores . 
  i wish that i was the monster that you think i am . 
  i would gladly give my life to watch you all drown . 
  escort the defendent back to his cell !, 
  i will not give my life for the plaintiff 's paralysation , and i know i will get no justice here , so i will let god decide my fate . 
  i demand a trial by combat !, 
  [ cue rains of castamere ], 
  [ sorry , i could n't help it . 
  it just seemed such a brilliant parallel . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7aogowmbqm ), 
  should 've lied and told us you only needed 5 . 
  would have made a cooler story ( and been a better parallel to the other guy , who if i recall correctly * also * only needed 5 ) . 
  still , honesty is cool , so you 've got that going for you . 
  of course there 's an other option . 
  that does n't change the fact that this was * really * bad survey design .
