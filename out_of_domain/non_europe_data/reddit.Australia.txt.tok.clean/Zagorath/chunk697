  it takes a special kind of show for the implied rape of a ~ 13 year old girl to be the * second * most disturbing scene of the episode . 
  mmm . 
  good call .

  you 'd be better off [ here ] ( http://www.flatmate.com.au/ ) . 
  i used them when i was looking for a place , and i paid for their lowest level non-free service . 
  i was hesitant to pay anything , but when i figured it 's a tiny fraction of what the rent would be for just one week , that seemed worth it . 
  got dozens of responses within days , which made it really easy . 
  but as the others said , do post photos . 
  there 's literally no reason not to , and it helps people out . 
  i can see why you 'd think that . 
  a * hell * of a lot of stuff happened in s05e09 , it feels in hindsight like at least two episodes . 
  but they actually are the same episode . 
  specifically , arya 's scene at the brothel started at around 21:30 , and shireen 's scene at 28:15 . 
  yeah when i search for `` daredevil imdb '' i get stuff about elektra . 
  which to be fair , the wikipedia article seems to imply * was * a major character in the film , though probably should n't be the one in the summary . 
  [ critical success ] ( http://peachesandhotsauce.com/category/podcasts/critical-success ) is just brilliant . 
  they only release episodes * very * rarely , unfortunately , but totally worth it . 
  it 's mostly suggestions for how to run/play the game , but really in depth and well thought out . 
  [ fear the boot ] ( http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/ ) is one that i saw a lot of people recommend , but i kept avoiding it -- probably because of the name . 
  i started listening a few weeks ago and i highly recommend it . 
  dumb name for a fantastic podcast . 
  more or less the same type of content as critical success , but delivered in a different way ( and in a much higher volume ) . 
  i liked eragon 's magic at first , but in later books they were just doing so much shit it felt like paolini was just letting them do whatever the shit they felt like . 
  same with harry potter , to be honest . 
  in the first book it 's pretty simple . 
  you use a certain wand gesture and say a certain word , and then a certain bit of magic happens . 
  later on they 're casting spells without words , and any notion of wand gestures is completely gone . 
  the movies were even worse in this , because it was like the third film when they stopped having to say the spell to do magic . 
  but i agree with your general point . 
  the argument `` oh but it 's a fantasy world , it has * magic * '' when someone says they find a world unbelievable , is a total cop out . 
  a world with a good magic system should be internally consistent , and should feel logical to the reader . 
  exactly ... 
  that 's why op said stannis 's life is a lot shorter . 
  op just realised * how close * davos and shireen were . 
   the correct pronunciation of arya is ar-ee-ah , and not ar-yah, 
  not according to martin :, 
   `` arya '' is pronounced `` are - yuh '' . 
  george r.r. 
  martin himself has pointed out that a surprisingly large number of people pronounce it incorrectly : it consists of two syllables , not three ( like how the `` aria '' of an opera is pronounced ) . 
  martin explained : `` i say it ` are-ya ' , two syllables not three . 
  not ` are-ee-uh ' , not like an operatic thing , but ` are-ya ' , very sharp . 
  i wanted something that was like a knife , that was a sharp and hard sound , to be a contrast to the flowery ` sansa ' . '', 
  ^ [ [ 1 ] ] ( http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/pronunciation_guide ), 
  but anyway , responding to op 's question it 's just a mistake on the part of the actors . 
  both pronunciations have been used quite widely in the show , not just by sansa . 
  i 'll be honest , i did n't even know that until i googled it to respond to you . 
  i had always said it that way ( mainly just because it 's faster ) , but seeing both used in the show i had no idea which would be correct . 
  oh right , yeah . 
  for what it 's worth , i would n't call that `` implied '' . 
  sure , it did n't happen explicitly on screen , but we were very much in the room at the start of it . 
  she 's also quite a bit older than 13 . 
  her got wikia page says 17 . 
  whereas with the girl , all we know is that she was clearly unwillingly forced into prostitution , and that she and ser meryn went into a room together . 
  it was all implied . 
  also i completely guessed her age , but ~ 13 seemed reasonable . 
  the first episode of this season had charles dance in the credits . 
  i remember seeing that and thinking `` huh , that 's strange , did n't he die already ? '' . 
  turned out we saw his dead body for like 20 seconds , but still . 
  there are a lot of good videos on this topic from a little circle of youtubers who specialise in historical weaponry . 
  lindy 's one , of course , but there are also good videos from [ scholagladiatoria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/scholagladiatoria ) and ( i presume -- i do n't actually watch this guy , but i 've heard references to him from the other two ) [ skallagrim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/skallagrimnilsson ) . 
  on the topic of scholagladiatora , [ his most recent video indirectly approaches the topic at hand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hqqr3pbj7q ) by way of defending the unsullied in game of thrones ( warning , major spoilers if you have n't started season 5 , very very minor spoilers if you 're at least a few episodes in to season 5 ) . 
  both black men . 
  both have military history . 
  both named john . 
  the first hints of emotional spectrum stuff were also in the episode where he first appeared on the flash , not to mention the green lamp symbolism that was associated with diggle in that episode . 
  he 's also been a pretty much fucking useless character since at least the start of season 3 , if not somewhere during season 2 . 
  this would give him something to do , in addition to tying him in to a cool well-known character , and just generally being awesome . 
  mate , that alligator is fookin ' tiny compared to a good aussie saltie . 
  totally . 
  i 've actually paid for it twice ( the devs are great and i probably could have gotten it free the second time if i 'd contacted them , but i did n't want to bother , and i figured it was worth it ) . 
  once on ios , and then once again when i switched to android . 
  it 's literally the only app on * either * platform that i have ever paid for . 
  but i listen to like 14 hours ' worth of podcasts per week , so it 's a different proposition for me than it might be for someone who does n't listen to a lot of podcasts . 
  in a plane ? 
   and year 11 in places like australia ( where he 's coming from ) is actually 12 grade . 
  just pointing that out . 
  huh ? 
  i 'll admit i did n't actually go to school in australia , but i am australian and i 've never heard this . 
  to my knowledge , high school goes from year 7 or 8 ( depending on the state ) to year 12 . 
  year 11 is year 11 . 
  it 's not like the uk situation where they actually go to year 13 , and thus to convert from the american system you have to add a year . 
  i do n't know many people in year 11 over 20 . 
  i usually watch shows from the in-flight entertainment . 
  in fact , the first time i ever started watching arrow was on a trip from sgn to bne a few years ago . 
  i had never even heard of it before ( this would have been roughly during the season 1 midseason break ) , but i saw it in the in-flight entertainment system , and being in the middle of watching season 2 of young justice at the time , i figured a dc-based live-action show would be cool . 
  ended up binge watching the first 4 and a half episodes or so on the flight , and downloading the rest as soon as i got home . 
  yeah i know it was . 
  i just did n't entirely agree with your specific example . 
  on another note , you might find brandon sanderson 's essays of the laws of magics interesting . 
  in particular , the [ first law ] ( http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/ ) , which can be summarised by :, 
   an author 's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic . 
  which explains more about how both early eragon 's magic system , but also the really vague and slightly less clear systems used in lord of the rings or a song of ice and fire/game of thrones can be considered good magic systems . 
  yeah , that 's correct . 
  how is this comment relevant to what the person you replied to said ?
