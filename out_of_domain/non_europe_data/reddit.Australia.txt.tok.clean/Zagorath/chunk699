  ( though admittedly , the lothlorian brooch made a bit more sense , since they knew the exact path they needed to track . ), 
  i did n't necessarily think he was going to be killed , but it was pretty fucking obvious that olly was going to do something stupid like that . 
  for fuck 's sake mate . 
  this is supposed to be the * one * place we can go without this bullshit book reader elitism . 
  shut up about it , or fuck off back to / r/gameofthrones and / r/asoiaf . 
   plus snow is not that good at breaking a fall, 
  [ what 's that ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnwiykccwlk ), 
  someone elsewhere in this thread estimated the height of the fall at about 15 metres . 
  that video says 5 stories , which a very quick google says is 15-20 metres . 
  definitely dothraki . 
  horses , arakhs , braided hair , and the music was the dothraki theme . 
  there 's really zero room for doubt on it . 
  yeah , at best you * might * be able to say that the * showrunners * are using the * show * to `` go on a super-lengthy / r/atheism style tirade '' . 
  but even that 's a stretch , really . 
  [ sorry buddy . 
  this is from after the boat has sailed . 
  she still has the antidote on her . 
  it 's way too easy to get out of danger or make npcs do what you want with a persuasion or deception check . 
  by internally consistent , i assume you mean what sanderson would call `` hard '' magic ? 
  something with strict rules that are mostly consistently applied ? 
  as opposed to the more vague and mysterious magics used in things like lord of the rings or a song of ice and fire ? 
  because strictly speaking , even soft magics can be internally consistent . 
  with only a few exceptions , asoiaf is actually pretty damn consistent , it 's just vague and not precisely understood . 
  i have n't read his works , but sanderson claims his own magics are `` perhaps 80 % hard , maybe a bit more '' , so they may be to your taste . 
  similarly , i 've not read it , but what i 've heard leads me to believe that the wheel of time series by robert jordan is a pretty hard magic system . 
  outside of books , comic books are absolutely * terrible * , but tv shows based on comic book characters tend to be really good , in terms of consistency . 
  young justice is one of my favourites . 
  and i would highly recommend avatar : the last airbender , which i consider * the * prime example of a `` hard '' magic system . 
  for me , this is a particularly difficult time , and it 's difficult to put as much attention as i would like into the model parliament , because real life exams are going on . 
  and i know i 'm not the only one with the same problem . 
  still , i 've been working behind the scenes getting people to join the various committees , and i expect the official announcement on that matter will come out later today , or tomorrow at the latest . 
  haha yeah , that 's been the other problem . 
  especially as speaker , figuring out all the rules and procedures to follow has made me hesitant to post things , which makes it difficult to keep the government moving . 
  but yeah , it probably would have helped to have put parliament on hold until all the exams were finished . 
  of course she has n't seen it . 
  what do you take her for , some sort of peasant ? 
  she read the * novel * . 
  am i missing some reference here , or was your spoonerism a mistake ? 
  i figured he 'd try to kill jon , but i thought he 'd do it * himself * , not organise half the watch to join him in it . 
  and i did n't think he 'd be successful ... 
  for one thing , [ the stormtroopers were not ineffective ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/w5mhii8 ) . 
  for another , once they finally got out in the open in a large group in episode 9 ( when they were in a circle around dany et al. ), 
  they were actually effective . 
  they killed a bunch of the harpies , and not one of them died ( except the guy that was holding off a bunch of harpies away from the circle , who got burned by the dragon ) . 
  yeah , but i think most people know the syrio appearance was only to remind us of ser meryn . 
  [ shunavabitch ] ( https://youtu.be/ea9oauojsiw?t=42 ), 
  i do n't use multifactor authentication with lastpass because i need to still be able to access it even when i do n't have internet access on my phone . 
  the hashes will take long enough to crack that there 's no rush . 
  wait a few hours or even a couple of days . 
  just gets . 
  no apostrophe . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i assumed that they would either push it to your device somehow , or send you an sms . 
  do they have something similar to the google authenticator or symantec 's `` vip access '' where you can log in using an offline authenticator ? 
  if so i might have to take another look . 
  i 'm pretty sure there was n't one when i looked at 2 factor ages ago . 
  what thing ? 
  my chrome on android is up to date , and it looks the same as ever . 
  i never changed any settings . 
  most non-americans i know refer to these as brackets : ` ( ) ` . 
  there are n't any consistent or `` correct '' terms to refer to any of these : ` [ ] { } ( ) <  ` . 
  i 'm on the latest version of lollipop . 
  i 'll have to take a look . 
  actually no sms access for me is a bigger problem than no internet , though most of the time both go hand in hand . 
   except for best picture which is stv again, 
  i 'm guessing it 's really more av , here ? 
  as in , stv where the number if winners is 1 ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they know this and are just being a douchey pc master racer . 
  yeah definitely . 
  i only knew it because i had just started rewatching the show between episodes 8 and 9 this season , and i was half way through season 2 , so it was really fresh in my mind in that episode . 
  i would n't have remembered any of that otherwise . 
   long live jon snow !, 
  fuck the watch . 
  present, 
  already on top of it . 
  regarding the standing committees , where did you get that list and those make ups from ? 
  i had compiled a list i was about to release that was based on a condensed version of [ the current real parliament 's standing committees ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=comm_list.htm#standing ) . 
  ( i basically took the ones listed there and merged a few , on account of the smaller size of this parliament . 
  it looked to me [ based on this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_house_of_representatives_committees#standing_committees_2 ) that precisely what committees there were changes from parliament to parliament . ), 
  it would probably take a little more time if it needs to be in the format shown above . 
  so , this actually does n't technically meet the standing orders requirement that the petitions committee have 4 non-government members ( to name just one example ) . 
  seeing as we do n't have 4 opposition members in parliament , there 's nothing that can be done about this . 
  i 'm hoping that we can get a bill passed to amend the committees and their requirements to make it a little more sensible for the scale of this model parliament . 
  the question is put that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying to this comment aye or no . 
  fair enough , though if we can expect that the majority of the time the numbers wo n't work out properly , it feels to me that it would be more appropriate if we just amended to standing orders to be more suitable on an ongoing basis . 
  but anyway , i 've made the edits to get this through . 
  because it was obvious olly was gon na do something fucking stupid since the episode before hardhome when sam told him sometimes you have to do what you think is right even if others disagree , or whatever . 
  i did n't really have any problem with it . 
  i just took it as `` oh they skipped forward a bit here '' . 
  if you like fantasy and/or political dramas ( e.g. 
  house of cards ) , you really should watch it . 
  it 's an excellently made show in everything from acting and writing to music and special effects , and having some details of it spoiled really wo n't ruin it for you . 
  if you do n't care for either of those genres , well there 's absolutely no reason you should bother with it . 
  the same has been true of most airports elsewhere that i 've visited , too . 
  but fast food restaurants are generally one of the most common things to find in the pre-security area , so the story is definitely believable . 
  ( the expression is actually hear , hear . 
  it comes from `` hear him , hear him '' . 
  but i agree nonetheless . ),
