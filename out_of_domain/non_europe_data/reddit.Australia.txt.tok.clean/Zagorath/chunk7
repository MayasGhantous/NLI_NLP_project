  i think that 's a novelty account ... 
  ad hominem is a logical fallacy where you try to discount someone 's argument by attack the person making it . 
  as in , peregrin took ? 
  i can confirm that asians can be incredibly racist . 
  not so much ( generally ) against white people , but against other asians . 
  vietnamese people can be incredibly racist against darker-skinned minorities , such as those with backgrounds in cambodia . 
  i 've also heard the same kind of thing from indians , where the lighter-skinned are racist against the darker-skinned . 
  dunno if it 's coincidence that it works that way or what , though . 
  :1800 s] if the horns could play chromatically , in any key , as do string instruments , would you want them to play in both the exposition and the recapitulation of the first movement of your fifth symphony , or would you still want the bassoon to play in the recapitulation ? 
  :1800 s] also , for whom did you write f\u00fcr elise ?

  it 's not about time spent studying , or how difficult the job is . 
  it 's about how * important * it is . 
  and yes , i ** absolutely ** think that teaching is ** every bit ** as important as medicine . 
  without good teachers ** there would be no doctors ** . 
  someone has to ** teach ** them that stuff , right from primary school up until post graduation . 
  without good teachers society simply ca n't function . 
  almost every job , and certainly every comfortable , well-paid job , requires some level of good education . 
  yes , there are bad teachers out there , and yes , they should be able to be fired . 
  but it 's ** far ** more important , in my mind , that things should be done to encourage more good teachers to join , and to stay on . 
  first and foremost in that is getting people like you to give teachers the respect they deserve . 
  upvote for replying to an ad hominem with an ad hominem :p, 
  :1800 s] sorry , let me write that down, 
  :1800 s]  scribbles the above on paper, 
  :1800 s]  hands to beethoven, 
  i 'm curious , in what way does `` handwriting , including perceived gender in handwriting '' influence examiners ? 
  how much of an effect does it have ' and what different factors make what effect ? 
   water , nitrogen , and marijuana, 
  ftfy, 
  i do n't get it ... 
  i 'm running skyrim on decent settings on a computer that would 've been 700-800 in the us ( was much more here in vietnam , all electronics are overpriced ) back in 2008 . 
  can anyone say dlc ? 
  why thank you . 
  i guess this guy is n't up for an honest discussion either . 
  1 . if you require us citizens over 18 , the survey should * really * say that in it . 
  none of the check boxes that were required stated those facts , and it was not until after watching ( or attempting to watch , read below ) that non us or uk citizens are told they can not complete the survey . 
  side point , why must it be citizens of these countries ? 
  i always feel left out not being able to do these surveys , so i often do them anyway and then do n't press the final complete button . 
  sorry if that actually sends you a set of results . 
  ( in this case , i stopped after 5 or 6 questions ), 
  2 . the video host used is , quite frankly , terrible . 
  if at all possible you should switch to something like youtube or vimeo . 
  still , good luck to you . 
  i hope you get your results , and i definitely hope you can post them here once you get them . 
  i just think it should specify at the beginning of the survey what the criteria are to participate . 
  they need to agree to what are essentially terms and conditions anyway , just an additional checkbox saying `` i am a us citizen over the age of 18 '' , or words to that effect . 
  ps , if only us citizens should participate , why does the survey allow us * or uk * to continue on ? 
  very cool . 
  i suspect you ca n't say what exactly you 're researching now , because people might read that , and that would bias the results ? 
  ** the ** red circle, 
  not gon na help of someone walks in . 
  they even tell you that [ in their opening page ] ( http://explodingpixels.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/incognito_window2.png ) . 
  there 's a close quotation mark , so you do n't go feeling awkward all day, 
  oh , i thought he was talking about a quick alt tab . 
  at the same time , i would recommend not using reddit unless you really have to , if you 're going to limit the sample too much . 
  if it only happened occasionally i would n't mind , but when almost half of the surveys are for us citizens at university i 'm tempted to take the survey anyway just to mess with them . 
  the problem is , you 've got no way of knowing that people are being reliable . 
  if they do n't have the option to take a survey honestly , you can only expect them to lie . 
  i agree . 
  percentage is probably the best unit to use if they want something anybody can do , as everyone should know the maximum on their scale . 
  if they really only want americans , they should either reconsider using reddit , or at least clearly specify . 
  i probably would have , had i known about the burning flag thing . 
  i 've heard the term young earth creationism ( yec ) to describe what is laid down in the bible , where a god specifically created the world more or less as it is today . 
  i dunno what the opposite would be . 
  it 's kinda related to deism vs theism . 
  most modern religions , when interpreted literally , are theist , which has a god or gods which interact with the world . 
  a deist basically believes that something started the world , but does n't necessarily have an impact on it . 
  a yec is much more likely to be theist , and an old earth creationist ( for lack of a better term ) is more likely to be deist , but these pairs are n't necessarily mutually exclusive . 
  true , evolution is evolution . 
  however , natural selection is a separate ( but very much related ) process . 
  take the example of the peppered moth in england . 
  there were both light and dark coloured peppered moths ( a single species ) , but the light ones were far more common . 
  during the industrial revolution , the trees and plants that the peppered moth would live on became covered in soot , and so the dark moths had an advantage in camouflage . 
  over time , the dark ones become the more common . 
  no explicit evolution needs to have taken place , but natural selection certainly has . 
  as i said , they are related and intertwined processes , but not the same thing . 
  i 'm very curious , then , to know your perspective ? 
  is genesis some sort of allegory or metaphor for how god created the universe ? 
  not attacking you , just genuinely curious . 
  i believe in natural selection and evolution , but i also believe that the two are separate ( but very much related ) processes .

  also , just out of curiosity , what is the downvote reddiquette ? 
  i 've not been here long , and i tend to avoid downvoting things except jokes that are n't funny . 
  i agree with khalexus , they are in no way similar . 
  in aus , we do n't vote for the prime minister , we vote for our local seat . 
  the winners from each of the seats then vote amongst themselves for the prime minister . 
  in essence , that means i would vote for the local representative of my preferred party , who would then vote for the party 's current leader . 
  what gillard did was within the party , and decided to lead a coup to get the other members of her party to decide to make her the leader . 
  this is all a somewhat simplified version of the truth , but that 's the essence of it .

  yes , i know ( only thanks to the great [ cgpgrey ] ( http://youtu.be/ous9mm8xbbw ) ) . 
  still , it 's closer to a direct process in america than in australia . 
  what ??
