  and your vote ? 
  unearthed arcana is still beta material . 
  in a video like this i 'd be more surprised if they * did * include ua than if they did n't . 
  while we 're talking about the ads , why did brady say `` however you like the pronounce it '' regarding hover ? 
  i was n't aware there was any debate over how you pronounce the word hover . 
  the thing that really sold me on the warlock was [ this thread ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 31j7w0/nontraditional _ warlock_ideas / ) and some of the really cool backgrounds people came up with in that thread , particularly [ this one ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 31j7w0/nontraditional _ warlock_ideas / cq2evb9 ) , which i thought was just incredible . 
  after that , i read the actual mechanics in detail . 
  and wow , do warlocks look * really * fun to play . 
  and they 're one of the most flexible classes out there !, 
  3 pacts and 3 patrons ( that 's 9 total combinations , by the way , / u/jpruinc , if you 're one of the people involved in making it :p ) , selection of a bunch of spells and a bunch of invocations , the ability to go full caster or also wield a weapon in the front lines , depending on how you build the character . 
  never used vim then , i take it ? 
  wait really ? 
  word is n't a plain text editor . 
  ctrl-l is a better one to tell people about because it 's cross platform . 
  works reliably in all browsers and on all major operating systems ( though on os x it 's cmd-l , since the cmd key takes the place of the ctrl key in standard keyboard shortcuts ) . 
  the question is proposed that the above motion is agreed to . 
  debate on this motion may proceed , and will end at 15:30 , friday 19 june , 2015 , utc +10 .

  i can confirm that neither alt-l nor alt-d work in chrome on os x. 
   and mother fucking heracules, 
  could n't decide between using hercules and heracles , i 'm guessing ? 
  yeah honestly i never noticed it until i saw someone mention it in a different thread . 
  it 's really subtle and i have no idea how anyone would notice it unless they were looking specifically for it . 
  if it 's the one i think it is , there 's a really small sort of inward indentation above her left eye ( to the right of her left eyebrow ) . 
  [ here 's an image that shows it fairly well ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n0scecv.jpg ) . 
  really subtle , and even knowing it 's there i 'll probably never notice it in the actual show . 
  definitely not something that would detract from the show in any way . 
  and other people have given great in-lore explanations for it for anyone anal enough to need that . 
  you 're really not feeling the aster , are you ? 
  no do n't blame the parents . 
  they were nice people . 
  i hear olly 's mum made the best boiled potato in westeros . 
  sometimes the kid just turns out rotten , despite the best efforts of the parents . 
  for d&d 5e all you * need * to have for these gods is which domain ( s ) they have power over ( some gods may have more than one domain , some domains may overlap and have multiple gods ruling over them ) . 
  this is necessary for clerics ( and favoured soul sorcerers , if you 're allowing unearthed arcana material ) when picking their domains . 
  if you 're going to the effort of creating your own deities , then you probably would also want descriptions and personalities as described in the other comments here -- after all , otherwise , what 's the point of creating your own ? 
  giving them their own unique personalities can really bring life to your setting . 
  when doing this , think about how the nature of the setting would influence what sort of gods rule over it . 
  just as one example , if it 's a world full of warring tribes , perhaps different tribes have different gods that are also at war . 
  or perhaps the different gods are all chummy with each other , and have made the mortals fight for sport ( but do the mortals know this ? 
  maybe not . ) . 
  that 's just one random idea i just came up with off the top of my head and it may or may not actually be a very good one . 
  basically , use your gods to help reinforce your setting in some way . 
  think about that while answering / u/garner _ adam 's questions , or completing any other more specific ideas . 
  so , i know this is really generic advice , but you should * really * , ** really ** stay out of this sub and the other game of thrones subs until you 're caught up , unless you do n't care about spoilers . 
  most people will try to do the right thing , but it 's easy to just not notice or to forget that a certain thread has restricted spoiler levels . 
  and you 'll always get the occasional arse that just wants to ruin things . 
  plus , characters in general change * a lot * over time . 
  characters that you hate now will become much more likeable , and characters that you generally like now may become among your most hated . 
  so asking questions about stuff like that is going to make answering it in a reasonable way * impossible * without spoilers . 
  people learn more about the characters ' motivations and thoughts as it goes on , and it can be difficult to separate what one has learned with what one knew at a certain point in time , when answering this sort of question . 
  it 's been submitted to other subreddits as well . 
  and besides , i suspect a lot of people from / r/clarinet probably also play at least the sax , if not some of the double reeded instruments , too . 
  i 'm gon na be honest , when i read the title and saw what subreddit this was in , but before i actually looked at the image , i thought that this might actually be hl3 . 
  my heart rate spiked a little in that half a second space . 
  fire is n't south east asia , it 's very definitively japanese culture . 
  i use it to notify my when there 's a new post on / r/cgpgrey , so i can find out about new hello internets or videos as soon as possible . 
  i also use it to archive all of my reddit comments in a google drive spreadsheet , because i sometimes like to refer back to old comments , but reddit itself does n't let you see further back than a few months . 
  it 's not a problem with nfc per se , so much as being a problem with the idea of * using * nfc for this purpose . 
  it really is amazing . 
  it 's incredible just how many chances ned had to save himself . 
  he had so many opportunities before everything started getting going to leave the capital and head back to winterfell . 
  he could have accepted renly 's deal and had renly put on the throne , or he could have said yes when littlefinger came forward with the same proposal . 
  and that 's * just * what happened in s01e07 . 
  i mean , i already knew that it was his honour that was his downfall , but rewatching it ... holy shit . 
  it 's amazing just how true that is . 
  yeah , unfortunately not . 
  the comment still exists on reddit , but you ca n't find it through the user 's profile ( e.g. 
  going to http://www.reddit.com/u/cutdownthere ) . 
  i think it 's something like 1,000 comments is as far back as you can go through the profile . 
  i 've been on reddit since 21.02.12 , but only started using ifttt to archive comments since 18.08.14 . 
  i 'm a big fan of the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) as a method for describing one 's political views . 
  libertarians are in the 2nd quadrant , so they might be somewhere around [ 8 , -8 ] , while a moderate libertarian would be more like [ 3 , -3 ] . 
  typical conservatives are around [ 5 , 5 ] , and typical progressives are around [ -5 , -5 ] . 
  ( you just have to note that the terminology of the political compass is a bit iffy . 
  they use `` libertarian '' to refer only to a stance on social policy , while normally it refers to both social and economic policy , and so `` libertarians '' would be `` right-libertarian '' according to the political compass . ), 
  socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires . 
  i 'll repost my comment from that video :, 
   d&d 5th edition * does * have rules for chasing . 
  they 're on page 252 of the dungeon master 's guide . 
  they only cover the middle of your three styles of chasing , though , and in my opinion at least , they 're rather dull . 
  something better and more interesting for this type of chase would be interesting . 
  though the `` chase complications '' tables are quite interesting . 
   for the pursuit , i do n't really think any specific new rules are necessary , regardless of what game system you use . 
  a combination of whatever middle-distance `` chase '' rules you have , rules for resting , food , & endurance , and rules for tracking can be combined to make long-distance pursuits that are engaging . 
   the short sprint could have a specific rule , though at least by the design ethos of 5th edition d&d , having specific rules for it would be unnecessary . 
  a strength ( athletics ) contest with advantage and disadvantage applied based on movement speed and distance to target , or something like that . 
  remember , the design ethos of 5e is that you want to minimise the number of cases where you 're adding or subtracting extra numbers . 
  in particular for the sprint , i do n't like the idea of adding a heap of extra stuff . 
  so for that , plus because of your weird rulings regarding the movement , i 'm not a fan of the way you 've described sprints . 
  the way i would do it is as follows :,
