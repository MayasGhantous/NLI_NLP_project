  * a strength ( athletics ) contest . 
  * gain advantage if you have higher movement speed, 
  * gain advantage if you 're closer to the destination than the other person ( in the event that two people are running for a static third party , such as the door in lindy 's example ), 
  * gain disadvantage if there is any reason the player should be at disadvantage for any reason , for example if they 're heavily encumbered or they have to run uphill ( and the other person does n't ), 
  * the winner of the contest arrives at the destination first , on a tie they arrive at the same time ( the consequences of that may vary depending on exactly why they are sprinting ) . 
  the loser arrives after the other person . 
  no weird fiddling with movement speeds or adding and subtracting extra numbers . 
  this does n't work if you 're within the initiative order ( i.e. , if you 're already in a combat encounter ) , because in the initiative order you use standard movement rules ( including chasing a person if you readied an action to do that at your normal movement speed ) . 
  i like the general structure of your chase rules , but i do n't like a couple of the specifics . 
   if the target pushes hard , make a dc 10 con check to force a con save on each chaser . 
  love it . 
   if target tries to impede the chasers , make a dc 10 dex check to force a dex save on each chaser . 
  i would say it depends on how they try to impede the chasers . 
  if they 're running through a crowd and yell out to others for help , maybe they roll a charisma ( persuasion ) check . 
  and the dc might vary depending on how likely the people are to help : if the person is a tiefling in a city of superstitious humans , the dc might be much higher than if they 're a well-known well-loved person running through a crowd of their followers . 
  if they try to impede them by, 
   if target tries to throw the chasers , make a dc 10 int check to force a int save on each chaser . 
  same as above . 
  it depends on what they try to do . 
  if they try to parkour over a fence , they might have to do either an dexterity ( acrobatics ) or strength ( athletics ) check . 
  if they run around a corner and try to hide in the crowd , maybe they have to do something unorthodox like a charisma ( stealth ) or wisdom ( stealth ) check . 
  there is an enormous range of possibilities for both the attempt to impede the chasers and the attempt to throw them off , so i do n't think you should limit it to just dex or int . 
  let the players be creative . 
  as i said in the comment on youtube , i do n't think there needs to be any rules on pursuits . 
  use something similar to the chase rules , but measure it in terms of days or hours . 
  require chasers to make some sort of check to track the person ( either a social check to ask other people where they went , or some sort of wisdom check to follow the tracks ) with a dc based on all external factors ( tracking someone through wet weather will be harder than through dry weather , tracking through snow if it 's stopped snowing and is n't too windy will be really really easy if the chasee has n't tried to cover their tracks ) . 
  a chasee might do things like cover up their tracks , set deliberately fake tracks -- wisdom ( deception ) , i would make that -- etc. 
  if they do that , treat it similar to stealth : their check imposes the dc for the chasers . 
  keep the travel pace rules from the phb , particularly regarding `` forced march '' . 
  and if you want to , make sure to keep track of encumberance rules , and require players eat and keep track of what food they have . 
   i think rai is that you are concentrating on the target , not just concentrating on keeping the spell going, 
  no , i do n't think it is . 
  you can already keep concentration when you lose line of sight , i do n't see why this would be any different to that . 
  the comma is there because you 'll note the clause directly before the `` but '' is parenthetical . 
  but you 're right that there are some odd verb tense issues . 
  specifically here :, 
   unfortunately , the paralysis does n't numb the pain of digesting for days within the belly of the giant anemone . 
  where the rest of the paragraph was past tense ( `` pursu ** ed ** '' , `` stopp ** ed ** '' ) . 
  that 's pretty common among lefties . 
  it 's not so much a genetic thing ( although ambidextrism probably has some genetic component , i would guess ) as a societal one . 
  you likely observed righties doing many of those things in the right handed way , and it became instinctive to imitate them doing it the same way . 
  additionally , in some cases , it can be sort of forced upon you by the tools available . 
  for example , scissors do have a handedness , and it can be awkward to use normal right-handed scissors in your left hand , so you learn to use scissors right-handed . 
  driving is similar : you operate the gear stick with a certain hand ( your left if you drive on the left , or vice versa ) , there 's really no choice in that matter . 
  i can certainly attest to this . 
  fencing as a lefty with mostly right handers really annoyed most of them . 
  though i have to say , on the rare occasions i 've fenced against another lefty , it 's felt really weird to me . 
  i find it very interesting that fencing in the way that is essentially the * norm * for most people ( when righties verse righties ) feels so incredible awkward to me . 
  it 's understandable , of course , but just interesting . 
  the capital `` t '' in true , the lack of brackets around `` true '' , and the colon at the end of the line mean it has to be python . 
  or at least , it 's impossible for it to be any other language that i 'm familiar with , since the c-syntax languages all require the brackets and have a small `` t '' `` true '' . 
  and no colon . 
  yeah i would absolutely love to do something like this . 
  it would be so much fun !, 
  i 'd rather go down the `` play an instrument that was entirely new to them '' route than the `` be non-musicians '' one , though . 
  lollipop easter egg ? 
  i was explaining why there really was no reason for the above comment to exist . 
  this is immensely unhelpful . 
  at least as far as i can tell , onenote does n't have the ability to do true `` comments '' , i.e. , [ comments that appear as an aside in the margin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9umqz9q.png ) . 
  obviously the format of onenote means that `` in the margin '' does n't really make sense as a concept , but it would still be helpful to be able to do asides in a way that links them to the text it 's associated with and would move up and down along with that text . 
  is this possible in onenote ? 
  i really hope it is , because i came to this subreddit also looking for more or less the same thing . 
  but if it is , it 's not very discoverable , and you should have just told op about it rather than being an arse . 
  if you 're interested , / u/vegetable _ ninja , / u/ox _ , and / u/bkstephens were all being totally legit . 
  the rest of the comments are gibberish . 
  it probably does n't help that even in the joke thread , there are a few people using real cricketing terms in the correct way , but picking their sentences carefully such that it looks like a joke to someone not familiar . 
  namely , / u/vegetable _ ninja , / u/ox _ , and / u/bkstephens 's comments . 
  now i know what the americans reading the cricked thread feel like ... 
   it 's the second most popular sport in the world, 
  even as a cricket fan myself , this comment had me * really * confused for a moment , until i remembered india . 
  i know the word `` wicket '' has a lot of different meanings in cricket , but i 'm fairly sure none of them are verbs . 
  oh well shit . 
  i just googled it . 
  i had no idea their population was as large as it is . 
  and bangladesh , too, 
  [ a position on the field . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/cricket_fielding_positions2.svg ), 
  i really , really doubt he 'll just straight up survive it . 
  that would really cheapen the finale . 
  resurrection is very much a possibility , but i do n't really think simply surviving it is . 
  out of curiosity , does that make `` okay , google '' stop working from everywhere ? 
  there are podcasts less than 20 minutes ? 
  i could n't find a date on that article , but i 'm guessing it 's old . 
  [ pocket casts has exactly the same functionality ] ( http://blog.shiftyjelly.com/2015/03/05/its-finally-here/ ) . 
  there 's one that 's literally called [ bram stoker 's dracula ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bram_stoker's_dracula ) , from 1992 . 
  weird question , but what 's the music like in that one ? 
  i 'm a huge fan of the music in some of the other renditions i 've seen , particularly the film where john williams did the music , and the musical with music by frank wildhorn . 
  yeah , frankenstein has suffered a lot more than dracula has in terms of films . 
  most of the films keep more or less the same message of dracula , but i do n't know of a single movie that 's even a little faithful to shelley 's frankenstein . 
  so overcast has the same thing but with less flexibility ... 
   when the batsmen at each end switch over and a different bowler gets to bowl, 
  uh , not quite . 
  the batsmen stay in the same place . 
  the fielders move around so that they 're bowling from the other end . 
   professional matches consist of 20 or 50 overs, 
  or an unlimited amount of overs with a limited number of days . 
  test cricket is , after all , the best form of the game , it seems odd to not mention it . 
   if the team batting second tie the score , it 's a draw, 
  no , if the second team ties , it 's a tie . 
  cricket is one of the only sports that makes a distinction between a `` tie '' and a `` draw '' .
