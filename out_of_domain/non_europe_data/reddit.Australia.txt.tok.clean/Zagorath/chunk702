  the other simplifications you made are fine ( i mean , there 's absolutely zero reason to explain the full complexities of the lbw ) , but these are some pretty crucial parts . 
  the guy above only described two forms of the game : twenty20 , which is 20 overs or 10 wickets , and one day matches , which are 50 overs or 10 wickets . 
  these only take either a few hours or a single day . 
  the greatest form of the game is known as test cricket , and it typically takes place over up to 5 days . 
  in test cricket , you can have an unlimited number of overs , and you are instead limited by the time . 
  each team gets two innings . 
  in general , one team bats , and once they 're all out , the other team bats , and then the first team bats again , and then the second team bats . 
  each innings you get 10 wickets , so in effect , in test cricket the team gets 20 wickets . 
  because of the longer nature of this form of the game , players tend to be more conservative in how they play , so they get out less regularly . 
  if the 5 day limit is reached and the game has n't already finished by either the 2nd team beating the 1st team 's score , or the 1st team getting the 2nd team all out in their second innings , the game is called a draw . 
  because of this , teams have the option to `` declare '' . 
  particularly in their first innings , if a team has scored a really high score and wants to give the other team a chance to go , they will declare . 
  this gives them more time to get the other team out and reduces the chance of a draw . 
  just to add one detail that 's in all forms of the game that the other guy did n't mention : if you hit the ball past the boundary on the full ( like a home run in baseball , i believe ) , you get 6 runs . 
  if it reaches the boundary after bouncing or rolling , that 's a 4 . 
  i agree that the chase rules in the dmg are boring , but they do have one redeeming factor : the tables in them for complications that can occur during the chase are quite interesting . 
  haha i have to be honest , that 's one feature i do n't care about either way . 
  i 've never tried fiddling with it in pocket casts , so i ca n't actually comment on how good it is . 
  i like the awkwardly long pauses grey puts in hi !, 
  but yeah , podcatchers are currently experiencing an extremely healthy amount of competition . 
  there are easily 4 or 5 strong competitors out there , which is great . 
  the worst thing that could happen would be for them to end up like rss was just before google shut down reader . 
  the shut down left people scrambling to find an alternative , because it was really the * only * viable option previously . 
  yes !, 
  if you have n't already owned it for at least 2 weeks , or played it for at least 2 hours , steam 's new refund policies are basically * specifically * designed for this kind of situation . 
  i thought their original post was fairly clear . 
   highlighting text and making a comment on it, 
  i ca n't think of anything else that this could refer to other than the exact thing that i was referring to . 
  especially since they also said it 's a feature in word . 
   before posting a question do some research yourself instead of relying on the rest of us to do it for you . 
  or how about this . 
  do n't assume that someone * did n't * do some research before asking . 
  i know i did -- lots of it -- and there was no satisfactory answer to be found . 
  i 'll agree that op could have been a bit more detailed in what they wanted . 
  but as anyone who 's ever done tech support or worked on a product for a client can attest to , eliciting requirements or determining the exact nature of the problem is an important part of that job . 
  people looking for help very rarely come to you with it all written out in a step-by-step process . 
  you have to intuit what they mean , or ask the right questions to get them to tell you . 
  if you did n't know what op meant , you should have asked them to clarify precisely what it was they wanted , or said something like `` please post a screenshot of what you want in word '' . 
  if you did n't want to do that , you could have just said nothing . 
  ignored the question and moved on with your day . 
  but instead , you chose to be an arse and * assume * they do n't know what they 're doing and that they have n't tried anything , and that immediately after they ran into a problem , they decided to come whining to reddit . 
  so yes . 
  `` an arse about it . '', 
  as a side note , my solution to the problem was [ to do this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bopx3u0.png ) . 
  it works fine in static text , but if you add or remove any extra text , obviously the aside and the brace wo n't move with it . 
  but even worse , [ it does n't sync cross-platform properly ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zgpzk89.png ) . 
  so even if you * do n't * change the text , it 's actually impossible to have it work properly . 
  the first screenshot was on the latest version of onenote for windows , and the second was on the latest onenote for os x. 
  no changes were made whatsoever . 
  and if you line up the os x version correctly , the windows one appears out of line . 
  for a note taking application , this is a pretty damn big oversight . 
  you ca n't actually note up a section of text . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.elpasoroofings.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hn999sramonrock-walls.jpg ) . 
  a bunch of latin-looking text is often used as placeholder text when demonstrating what a particular layout might look like , but when you do n't have ( or do n't want to show ) the specific actual content . 
   you can really have a floating comment that is anchored to the highlight, 
  i * really * hope that this * is n't * a typo , but i suspect it is . 
  you meant to say `` you ca n't really have ... '' , right ? 
  but anyway , thanks for this . 
  your use of the word `` anchored '' ( an obvious one in hindsight , but i could n't think of it until now ) spurred me to go google some more stuff . 
  i came across [ this ] ( http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-onenote/hot-to-make-floating-comments-on-text-notes/ad5a7089-3b09-44ec-b6ae-3c5cf7f4c3c2 ) . 
  it wo n't * quite * do the same thing , but you can `` insert space '' between paragraphs , so any text floating will move along with that paragraph . 
  [ if you make the space small enough , then as long as you 're only using windows , you 'll barely even notice the difference . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pujkm88.png ) after you insert more text , [ it looks like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8mzj3tg.png ) . 
  unfortuntately , this technique [ has weird behaviour if you need it to work on both windows and os x ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6zabxsx.png ) * ( that screenshot was from the exact same state as the second screenshot on windows ) , and you ca n't be more granular than the paragraph level , but it 's not a bad solution considering the lack of proper anchoring in onenote . 
  i guess to have it link to specific words or phrases you could use the already built-in highlighting options , [ like so ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qwwvy3q.png ) . 
  \\* though it makes it better than the same situation previously , since it at least keeps the different things in line with each other . 
  you can do unix-like stuff on linux just as well as you can on os x. 
   but if someone 's determined to kill themselves , there 's nothing you can do to really stop them, 
  sure , if they 're truly determined . 
  but [ when you make it harder to commit suicides , the rate of suicides * does * drop ] ( http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/ ) . 
  most suicide attempts are * not * from people truly determined to kill themselves . 
  they 're an impulsive act from someone who is in a moment of despair . 
  same thing goes with jump prevention on bridges and such . 
  what really scares me is that this is * reddit * . 
  a place well known for being * extremely * left leaning . 
  and even on here the insanity around guns is hard to believe . 
  makes me kinda scared to think about what it would be like in a forum full of hardcore republicans . 
   anyone who can heft a tiny , plastic gun is just as strong as any two able-bodied criminals, 
  hardly . 
  i assume you 've heard of the 21 foot rule ? 
  any criminal who intends you harm is never going to come charging at you from over 6 metres away . 
  you 're never going to be able to get that weapon out in time for it to be useful . 
  i 'll admit i 've never looked in to getting guns illegally here or in america , but i suspect it is a * lot * easier to do in america . 
  but there 's also the case where the person might own a gun * before * they start having mental health problems . 
  or if they just * know * someone with a gun who does n't keep it in a locked container separated from ammunition . 
  with how widespread gun ownership is in the us , i 'd be willing to bet it 's a lot easier for an accutely suicidal person to get their hands on a gun than it is in most other developed nations . 
  edit : and look at that . 
  the gun nuts come in force with their downvotes . 
  if anyone actually thinks i 'm wrong here , please by all means speak up , i 'd be interested to hear your opinions . 
  am i wrong in thinking that it would be much easier for a mentally ill person to get a gun in america than in australia or the uk ? 
  there was a time when i would have thought that was true , but these days i see far more support for social wealfare and fair , progressive , taxation than i do for libertarian type beliefs . 
  i think most of reddit sees libertarianism as a better alternative to conservatism , but not better than progressive politics . 
  you know , until this thread i had no idea people * did n't * think that 's what they were going to do . 
  the way they shot that end scene , it felt like a sort of `` and he kept on doing what he does '' type of thing -- like the end of the incredibles . 
  i see no reason that they should have to resolve that on screen . 
   you will look suspicious if you 've got an external battery in your pocket and a cable connected to it . 
  security officers do n't know what 's on the other end of the cable , and are trained to treat the issue as if it was `` schrodinger 's cat '', 
  that 's kinda dumb . 
  * airport * security has never once had a problem with my external battery -- as in , they 've never even asked me what it 's about -- so the thought that security at a * theme park * might get uppy at it is somewhat laughable . 
  yeah , if r+l = j , then jon is only * half * targaryen .
