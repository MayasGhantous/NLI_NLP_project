  going back on an idea when a huge number of people have shown you they really , really do n't like it is * always * a good thing . 
  it 's called listening to your customers !, 
  * google did it recently with chrome 's new bookmark manager . 
  * microsoft a while back with the xbox one, 
  * valve and bethesda with paid mods, 
  * new coke, 
  * and , of course , this . 
  just to name a few that immediately come to mind . 
   not just a cute little mildly stinging jellyfish, 
  also not a fly . 
  i read a book once that talked about how the basement was full of blue bottles littering the floor , and it made absolutely no sense to me . 
   it seriously seems like shitting on the host country is only acceptable in america, 
  i wonder how much travelling have you done ? 
  i used to live in asia , and seeing people -- both other expats and tourists -- shit over the country they 're in was relatively common . 
  it 's especially bad with the expats . 
  i 'm like : well if you liked it better in england go the fuck back there you whining bitch . 
  ( and it was , unfortunately , mostly english people who i saw do this , though in fairness being at a british school i was more exposed to english people than australians or americans . ), 
  yes , it is . 
  though to be honest , while americans * do * do this , my experience has been that brits and aussies can be just as bad . 
  especially younger people , since even without any remotely dodgy business , the minimum wage for people under 21 scales down as they get younger . 
  [ here 's a link to the comments on samplesize ] ( / r/samplesize/comments / 3amkwh/casual _ computer_specs / ) . 
  i use both a mac and a windows desktop more or less equally , which made answering this properly rather difficult . 
  i just mixed and matched which one i was talking about throughout the survey , and said `` other '' for all the first few where it was asking what i use . 
  but just an fyi , the name of the operating system used by macs is `` os x '' , not `` macos '' ( and not even `` mac os x '' , since 2012 ) . 
  when a manufacturer makes a drive and calls it 1 tb , they specifically tell you it 's 10 ^ 12 bytes . 
  unfortunately , both the 10 based ( where 1 gb is 10 ^ 9 bytes ) and the 2 based ( where 1 gb is 2 ^ 30 bytes ) get mixed and matched , depending on exactly what you 're talking about and who you 're talking to . 
  ram is nearly always 2 based , hard drive manufacturers nearly always use the 10 based . 
  and operating systems , i believe , are inconsistent ( i think windows uses the 2 based and os x uses the 10 based , but i could be wrong ) . 
  i 've heard the same , but i ca n't comment . 
  i have n't been into the city for a few weeks . 
  huh , you know what , i 've never thought of using temporary email addresses in that way . 
  that 's pretty clever . 
  i 'm hugely in favour of allowing content rather than restricting it . 
  i think that without really specific story-based reasons , dms who say `` oh you ca n't play a tiefling '' or ( in other editions ) `` you ca n't play a psion '' are grognards , and i have no interest in playing with that kind of dm . 
  i know that some dms also have , in previous editions , said things like `` only player 's handbook 1 '' or `` only this specific set of books '' are allowed . 
  and i have no interest in that kind of play . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , all official material is official and fair game . 
  that said , unearthed arcana material is not official . 
  it 's still beta material . 
  the elemental evil supplement is official stuff , as are the 3 core rulebooks . 
  but unearthed arcana has been put out there by wizards specifically with the qualifier that they do not consider it sufficiently well-balanced that they are willing to release it in its current form officially . 
  as a dm , i currently do n't allow ua material in my campaign , though i have said that if they really want it and can justify it with their character , i would be willing to allow it ( though i retain the right to alter it after-the-fact if it proves bad for balance , not that i expect that would actually happen ) . 
  that said , i certainly do n't think there 's anything wrong with a dm deciding to just flat out not allow ua . 
  honestly i forgot os x even had a notifications system . 
  i do n't think * any * of the applications on my system make use of it . 
  i never said or implied that 5e wants that . 
  indeed , 5e is specifically designed to be modular . 
  it 's supposed to be possible to add in or remove as many of the rules as you want . 
  all i said is that 's what * i * like , and i would not want to play with a dm who restricts official content . 
  but to be honest , i think the idea that feats are an explicitly `` optional '' rule is stupid . 
  realistically , they 're a core rule that can optionally be removed . 
  in fact , i feel far more strongly that feats * should * be in the game than i do about races and classes and stuff from books like elemental evil . 
  there 's just zero good reason not to allow players to choose feats . 
  [ here 's your reminder ] ( / r/samplesize/comments / 3apfrz/results _ ln_pronunciation_all_welcome / ) . 
  it came early . 
  while you 're explaining the joke , could you explain why everyone picked this guy ? 
  i do n't follow gridiron ( i 'm not american ) , so i do n't really know the people who play it . 
  why did a bunch of people think of tony here , when there must be so many possible players to pick from ? 
  here 's a weird thought . 
  in 12 months time , one could conceivably take the same cable and use it to charge their android phone from their chromebook , then turn and use it to charge the chromebook from the wall , then charge their macbook from the wall , and maybe even charge their iphone from the macbook . 
  for the first time in history , we might have a * true * ** universal ** standard for charging .

   it really is unbelievable how much ubisoft uses assassin 's creed as a crutch now, 
  yeah seriously . 
  they had something fucking amazing with their gameplay and plot at the start , and they ruined it by saying `` fuck it '' to the plot , and just redoing the same gameplay over and over again . 
  [ this comment summed it up pretty well for me ] ( / r/games/comments / 1s7i7n/ubisoft _ surveying_people_on_what_they_want_for / cdus492 ) :, 
   what i wanted in assassins creed was a concise set of games , four or five games , with a focused story the ultimately led to a modern day game where desmond miles topples the templars . 
   but no . 
   now we have a platform for games rather then a cohesive set of narratives . 
  it 's basically call of duty with assassins instead of soldiers . 
  sigil : a light grey cog and lightbulb on a darker grey background . 
  words ? 
   it seems that there is no evidence that cycle helmets actually help, 
  this is actually not true !, 
  i 've heard this going around quite a lot , and i had more or less assumed it was true because of that . 
  but just recently i found out that it 's actually misinformation . 
  it was on a programme dedicated to finding things said in the media that are wrong and calling them out for it . 
  [ it 's a really great read , or watch ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4259939.htm ) . 
  present, 
  meta : sorry for the delay . 
  i have now finished with exams . 
  yeah , i 've played the first game and the ezio trilogy . 
  i enjoyed it , and in hindsight i still would recommend playing that much , if only because ezio 's own arc is pretty damn great ( and i loved the short film they released about him later in life ) , but i certainly have no desire to play any more of the series . 
  i thought they had , though ? 
  at least with the highest branch of the targaryen line : the one doing the ruling . 
  was n't that the point of the incest , to keep the blood pure ? 
  the question is put : that the motion now be agreed to . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' .
