  but it definitely had the strongest emotional impact of anything i 've ever watched or read . 
  honestly the worst game of thrones has done for me was shireen . 
  all the other deaths have been fairly tame in how they played out on screen . 
  the death was always really quick , or silent . 
  the closest was at the red wedding where lady stark was pleading for her son 's life . 
  but shireen 's was just screaming in utter terror . 
  it was just horrible to watch . 
  not to mention that * every * other death has been someone that played the `` game '' in some way or other . 
  they may have been `` good '' , but they were involved in it . 
  shireen was completely innocent of all that . 
  shireen was episode 9 . 
  yeah seriously . 
  i hear it all the time as a common misconception , but i 'm convinced no one could possible actually believe it . 
  you ca n't . 
  [ the video got taken down from a copyright claim ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ) . 
  using all caps is n't an excuse for not using apostrophes correctly . 
  yeah , i watched the first season and i enjoyed it . 
  i would never have called myself a brony though , i never did anything related to the show outside of watching the actual show ( such as visiting the subreddit and being involved in discussions there , like i do with every other show i watch ) . 
  and i was never bothered enough to start watching the second season . 
  but i certainly do n't regret watching season 1 . 
  we 're just harder than the rest of you . 
   2 : `` mortal strife '' ; sure , so why is the `` death '' part there ? 
  that 's what `` or '' is for . 
  honestly i feel that this one is a really well-known one ( much like the `` nothing '' one above ) so even though it 's a really hard one in its own merit , chances are at least one of your players will have heard it before , which completely ruins any level of difficulty it may have had . 
  honestly i feel the exact opposite . 
  one like this with such a. . . bland ... answer feels really flat to me . 
  like it defeats the purpose of having a riddle . 
  that 's brilliant . 
  i laughed out loud when i read that answer . 
  would n't work quite so well when you spell it tonne , but it 's still a great pun . 
  yeah , a riddle that is essential to the game is kinda like a save-or-die trap in that way , i feel . 
  instead , figuring out the riddle should impose some significant advantage . 
  for example , if you were in a maze , the riddle would take you straight to the finish , while getting it wrong would leave you having to continue to explore the maze ( maybe after fighting the sphinx ) . 
  or maybe you just have to fight the sphinx ( which had better be tough , but beatable ) . 
  you can still do it , it 's just that it 'll be a heck of a lot easier with the riddle . 
  my experience ( mostly international flights within asia and australia , but a few out to europe and south america ) has been that they will * always * forward your luggage through to your final destination . 
  apart from the times i 've had to transfer between international and domestic flights , i do n't think i 've ever had to pick up my bag before reaching where i 'm finally going . 
  at least not in the last 10 years . 
   the people are free ... and enslaved by a necromancer, 
  well then they 're not exactly * free * now , are they :p, 
  on a serious note :, 
  i 'm playing through lmop , so the consequences if evil won would n't be too * immediately * terrible . 
  the bad guys would gain a significant source of wealth and power , but nothing that would immediately spell the doom of civilisation . 
  but honestly , my players have fucked around so much with random stuff unrelated to the plot , this post has made me think ... hmmm ... maybe i should change up the last encounter . 
  have the black spider have already found the forge itself , and maybe allied himself with the guardians of the cave like the spectator . 
  i wonder if anyone who knows the campaign could weigh in their thoughts on this ? 
  yeah that 's the biggest thing that bugs me . 
  puzzles have the same problem . 
  there 's really no good way to roleplay it . 
  on that note , it mildly upset me that in the thread announcing sir christopher lee 's death , basically no one addressed him by his proper title . 
  fwiw i tested it on my stock android phone too , and it also does n't reverse on the native camera app . 
  my guess is snapchat . 
  it 's not the best photo . 
  it took me a couple seconds to figure it out . 
  the older gentleman in it is sir ian mckellen , who plays gandalf in the lord of the rings and magneto in x-men . 
  on the one hand , what you were doing was a total dick move , and i feel karma ( not the reddit sort ) dictates you deserved to get punished . 
  but on the other hand , no reasonable interpretation of the rules would find that you actually broke any , and so from a legal or rules based perspective , i ca n't see that you did anything wrong . 
  definitely did n't technically deserve the ban . 
   offensive content [ to who ? ], 
  so , i know who/whom is one of the worst distinctions in the english language , and it 's nearly always impossible for any normal person to get right . 
  but there is literally * one * case where it 's really obvious that whom should be used , and it 's exactly this one, 
  the second x comes from the fact that in english , it 's common to double the final consonant before adding suffixes like ing or ed , especially if the penultimate letter is a vowel . 
  so dox becomes doxxing or doxxed . 
  of course , it 's not correct in this case , but that 's probably the reasoning in most people 's minds . 
  i fucking hate those moat people . 
  get on the damn land like the rest of us !, 
  ah right . 
  that makes sense . 
  hmm ... 
  thanks for the link and the info . 
  in hindsight , i probably would have been better off going with debian or possibly mint . 
  but i 've spent so long setting up apache the way i want it that i dread the thought of having to redo it . 
  and at this point i 'm probably not going to be interacting * too * much with the actual os , so i think for now i 'll stick with ubuntu . 
  i 'll probably change it up next time it comes to set up a new machine . 
  i would like to express my thanks to the people of brisbane for electing me to this house , and to the other members of the house for electing me to the position of speaker . 
  as a member of the greens , i believe strongly that it is the duty of the government to ensure the people of australia , regardless of race , background , or sex , get the opportunity to benefit from the great wealth of this nation . 
  a high quality education should be the * right * of every child -- and indeed every * person * -- and everyone deserves access to high quality healthcare . 
  at the same time , we as a nation must look to the future . 
  we should invest in modern infrastructure that will benefit us for years and decades to come , and we should seek to minimise the damage done to the environment , so that our children 's children for centuries to come can experience the same beautiful environment that we have been able to enjoy . 
  i would like to again thank the australian people , and i promise that your faith in the greens and in me will not be in vain . 
  you sent a message about this ? 
  i actually went looking through my messages to see if there was anything about it but could n't find anything , so i went with the advice from a much earlier post .

  i wait to get my hair cut until i 'm up visiting my grandparents . 
  but i grew up ( from ages 13-18 ) in vietnam , where if it costs fifty thou that 's an expensive haircut . 
  that 's around two dollars fifty .

  this one 's for debating , not voting . 
  for now , at least . 
  the hof is only for submissions that have actually been posted here on / r/dndgreentext . 
  but i just read the first post from it , and it looks really good . 
  if you wan na submit them ( i would suggest linking to each part individually , and staggering it out over the course of a few weeks , to get the most visibility ) , then depending on how the rest of the subreddit receives it , i might add it once you 're done .
