  for now , at least . 
  i visited the uk once . 
  it was mid 20s and sunny . 
  there were announcements all around about how dangerous the heat is and how you need to keep hydrated . 
  my thoughts were just ... it 's only like 27 degrees people . 
  after being promised cold and wet i was almost disappointed . 
  most of the price matching schemes in my country are regardless of seller . 
  sure it has it be exactly the same model , but why you would say `` we price match amazon and * only * amazon '' is beyond me . 
  the question is proposed : that the bill be considered urgent and that the bill now be read a second time without adjournment . 
  members may debate the principles of the bill , and/or the matter of urgency , and foreshadow any amendments between now and 14:00 01/07/15 utc +10 by replying to this comment . 
  ### results, 
  ** ayes ** : 1, 
  ** nos ** : 0, 
  the vote has not received a quorum and there is no result to be declared . 
  meta : i think, 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  meta : i 'm on mobile so i 'm not sure this was the right thing to do here . 
  also could someone please page other members for me ?

  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  meta : same problem as the other thread . 
  the question is put : that leave be granted and the bill be now read for the third time without adjournment . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  the deadline for voting will be 14:15 01/07/15 . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  meta : i 'm almost certain i 've done this one wrong . 
  but being on mobile i ca n't really check . 
  / u/jnd-au , could you let me know if this is right ? 
  and page other members if so . 
  additional question . 
  since this vote involves seeking leave , does that mean a single no vote causes it to fail ? 
  so , my only source is one random reddit comment a while back , but i was under the impression that they wanted to keep everything canon except that which is explicitly incompatible with the new movies . 
  there 's actually [ a really old casino royal movie ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/casino_royale_ ( 1967_film \\ ) ) . 
  its plot bears little resemblance to the 2006 casino royal though , and it 's not a part of the main bond series of films . 
  seriously . 
  in conversations like this one the doylist interpretation has absolutely zero merit . 
  we 're discussing in universe reasons for things -- watsonian interpretations . 
  both are valid and worthwhile , but not in a conversation that clearly is aimed at discussing the characters and in universe stuff . 
  my memory could be wrong , but i thought she was supposed to turn out beautiful in the end . 
  an ugly duckling of sorts . 
  no falling damage when prepared/upright , and advantage on jumping related checks seems a pretty decent amount of flavour , and pretty strong without affecting how combat balance works . 
  even better : do n't moon anyone . 
  it 's infantile . 
  the terms `` doylist '' and `` watsonian '' interpretations refer to different ways of discussing tv/film/literature . 
  it comes from the sherlock holmes books , written by arthur conan doyle . 
  they 're written from the perspective of the character john watson . 
  essentially , a watsonian interpretation is an in-universe one . 
  discussing why things happen purely from the internal perspective of the world of the fiction . 
  a doylist perspective is a meta-analysis of the reasons the author/creator made things happen the way they did . 
  my favourite example is in star wars , with han solo 's quote about how he `` made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs '' . 
  the obvious doylist justification is simple . 
  george lucas ( or the writers of the film ) probably just did n't know that what they said sounds dumb to someone that knows science . 
  that 's pretty simple . 
  a watsonian interpretation allows for more variety . 
  the most common one involves black holes and how his ship could go a shorter distance without getting in danger . 
  but there 's at least one other watsonian interpretation ( and i prefer this one ) that the * character * han solo just wanted to sound really cool and was using sciency-sounding words , assuming it would make him seem impressive . 
  yeah , i definitely agree that the forge should be allowed to be given greater power after some time . 
  i might actually re-skin the map that gets found into instructions for the ritual , or something like that , if i ca n't think of something else to use an actual map for . 
  really like the idea of the dead bodies . 
  that 's a very nice touch . 
  hmm . 
  in that case i 'm not sure what happens now with this bill . 
  ah that 's interesting . 
  i 'm normally the other way around . 
  most of the time , i find explanations for things in-universe to be more compelling . 
  though when a show had trouble behind the scenes , the doylist interpretation can certainly provide some very interesting insight into why things happened how they happened . 
  for example , a while back i saw a very good doylist defence of the avatar movie , stating that it actually was n't all m. knight shamalama 's fault : he was working under very adverse conditions . 
  oh right . 
  i missed that . 
  since debate has now officially ended with no real debate taking place ( one guy simply replied `` yes '' , but that 's it ) , i 'm not sure how to continue , though . 
  i guess when parliament reconvenes this goes to a vote ? 
  yeah i 'm really confused about why they even put it in the survey , since they 've already given it to us . 
  based on last month , it 's first monday that is n't the first day of the month ( like how us elections are the first tuesday of november , unless it 's the first day of november ) . 
  my first character was a shardmind psion , so that 's obviously a race that i 'd really like to see added in again . 
  and we were playing in eberron , so i 'd like that setting . 
  i 've never played dark sun , but from what i 've read of it , it seems really cool , so i think that 'd be great to see . 
  and one of my favourite characters that i created but have never played was a vryloka vampire . 
  so i would * love * to see the vryloka race added in ( and i also added a comment saying i 'd like to see a vampire-like class , with progression-based vampiric abilities ) . 
  and because it 's a fitting setting for vampires , i also ticked off for the ravenloft setting . 
  and shardmind . 
  agreed . 
  though i 'd add eberron to that list . 
  ( if i was ranking them , though , eberron would be the third of the three . ), 
   we collected the responses as write-in text , rather than a checklist , so it will take some time to organize the results . 
  we hope to have those results for you next month . 
  yup , you were right . 
  there are already a few non-australians in this parliament , and to be honest i do n't like that . 
  it feels to me like we really should be discouraging people who are n't either australian citizens or australian residents ( so aussies living overseas or foreigners living in australia are both fine , imo ) from joining . 
  for what it 's worth , i never saw any advertising in / r/australia . 
  in fact , i remember in the first few weeks being surprised that nobody * had * submitted it over there . 
  it 's possible that i just never saw it , but i do think that says something . 
  perhaps if it were resubmitted prior to the deadline for registration for the next elections , since it 's got a bit of a history to it now , it might be able to gain a bit more traction . 
  people would be more likely to join something that looks like it 's already alive than something brand new and possibly empty . 
  thri-keen , gith , and shardmind ? 
  i 'd think that their conversation was enough to count . 
  what excludes it from counting is that despite the girl being named , i do n't think the * mother * was . 
  yeah , my power on button has been faulty since like 4 months after i first bought mine . 
  requires a few presses before it turns the screen on or off , most of the time . 
  and recently , it 's just started shutting down randomly , and taking like 20 presses to turn back on .
