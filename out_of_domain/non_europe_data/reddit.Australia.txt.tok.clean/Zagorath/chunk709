  it 's a damn pain . 
  missed a call back from the police ( after having filed a break-in report ) today because it shut itself down and i did n't realise ... 
  but i guess i 've been lucky . 
  it 's not been so bad that i 've needed to get more than just the one . 
  probably will upgrade to the next nexus phone when it comes out , or maybe a moto x ( though with moto maker not being available here , i 'm less inclined to go for that than i would be if i were american ) or 1 +2 . 
  definitely a fan of the nexus or near-nexus experience . 
  it 's also not `` and etc. '', 
  the et in et cetera means `` and '' already . 
  i wish it was n't necessary , but people use these two incorrectly ( as well as `` aka '' ) very frequently . 
  so unfortunately , yes , it is needed here . 
  also `` aka '' means `` also known as '' . 
  not `` here 's a sarcastic description of the person/thing/place i just named '' . 
  yeah , you 're probably right . 
  this definitely is something that people need to know , and i think a lot of people do n't . 
  it is n't really a `` life pro tip '' . 
  but unfortunately ( or not , depending on one 's perspective , i guess ) , the lpt subreddit has become basically just `` here 's something you should know '' . 
  i often see it used in the form of '' [ person 's name ] aka [ a description of that person ] . '', 
  the description may or may not be one that 's sufficient to identify the individual , but either way , `` i.e. '', 
  would be more appropriate than aka . 
  for example : `` bill gates , aka the guy who founded microsoft . '', 
  just checked . 
  [ there already is one !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/youshouldknow ) and it 's even a pretty popular subreddit . 
  i 've subscribed . 
  there 's also / r/technologyprotips , which is probably about a third of what gets posted in this subreddit already . 
  there 's obviously some sort of bowed string instrument . 
  it 's a little too early to be what we would now know as a viol ( though i would n't be too surprised if it 's being played on a modern replication of a viol ) . 
  there 's a flute-like instrument in the instrumental sections and the later accompaniment : obviously an edge-blown wind instrument , but beyond that i could n't say . 
  and i * think * i 'm hearing a plucked string instrument at times ( in addition to the bowed one and the dulcimer ) , but i 'm not sure : the headphones i 've got at the moment are n't the best . 
  and of course the percussion . 
  i had something similar happen , only it was between preschool and year three . 
  as another musician , that is just about the most beautiful quaver i have ever seen hand drawn . 
  and the tie is really well placed , too . 
  if i ever tried to write out music by hand it would end up looking [ something like this ] ( http://www.thereviewcrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/md_fo6bg.jpg ) ( only it would n't be musically anywhere near as good as that ) . 
  having `` obama '' as one of the password options was weirdly specific . 
  but also , having an `` other '' option on there is a little strange . 
  everyone should have some `` other '' option , because everyone has * some * password . 
  but really it felt more appropriate to check the `` none of the above '' option . 
  the distinction between whether one should give `` other '' or should just do none of the above did n't seem clear . 
  still , it 's a pretty good survey . 
  i hope you can share the results when you get them !, 
  haha yeah , i used passwords in a very similar format for a long time . 
  though mine were * slightly * better by adding a couple of words in front of or behind the `` password '' bit . 
  these days i only have two or three passwords i actually remember ( and those are over 20 characters long where the system allows it -- i just have a system for remembering it ) . 
  the rest are in a password management service , and are pseudo-random junk . 
  well obviously you need to have at least one good password you remember to secure the password manager . 
  for that , i use a system not * too * different from the above , though the end result is significantly longer and contains more variety of the 4 types of characters . 
  a sufficiently simple hash could probably be considered `` reversible '' in that it is really easy to brute force a plaintext that results in the desired hash , i guess . 
  but yeah , by definition a hash should n't be reversible . 
  if it is * truly * reversible , it 's not a hash . 
  as long as the password used to encrypt your 1password wallet is sufficiently strong ( seriously , make it  20 characters and have a variety of upper and lower case letters , numbers , and symbols -- you can use one of a number of mnemonics or other systems to remember such a long password ) , you 're probably way better off using 1password than you are with whatever system you used to use ( probably reusing passwords on a lot of accounts , and/or having fairly weak individual passwords ) . 
  if you can , consider turning on two-factor authentication for added security . 
  same advice goes for lastpass , keepass , or any other password management service . 
  [ here 's a great ( very in-depth ) video explaining just why lastpass is a very good secure system ] ( https://youtu.be/r9q_anb7pwg?t=53m50s ) . 
  any good password manager should work on the same principles . 
  he did abandon her at first . 
  later on he realised his mistake and reconnected . 
  he realised it . 
  he was called out on it many times earlier and still denied it then . 
  probably / r/subredditdrama too . 
  how ? 
  somehow they 've made the res `` use subreddit style '' button invisible . 
  true , but that wo n't allow you to read the comments on a post . 
  in the address bar ? 
  no , there 's no buttons there , at least on chrome . 
  oh wow that 's awesome . 
  i never noticed that was there !, 
  i usually only look in that area on youtube for turn off the lights . 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , origin is better than steam in every way except the number and range of games it supports . 
  unfortunately , that 's a pretty big flaw for a game platform . 
  it 's just like google + versus facebook . 
  g + is strictly better than facebook , but people did n't want to switch . 
  just a tip , the expression is actually `` hear , hear '' . 
  it comes from `` hear him , hear him '' . 
  easy mistake to make , though . 
  / r/science is , too , but that 's mainly because the comments explain why the headline is exaggerated or plain wrong . 
  i 'm more of a skip two generations person , but i definitely agree that unless you 're in the tech press or are obscenely wealthy , going every generation is generally unnecessary . 
  if they were misinterpreting an actual law , what would be an * accurate * example of something that goes against said law ? 
  there are also a couple of mini web series that are worth watching !, 
  i ca n't speak for everyone else , but i got into programming because i was good with computers . 
  and i got good at computers because i 'm good at troubleshooting . 
  those troubleshooting skills help just as much with fixing someone 's tv as they do when working out why my internet is n't working or fixing some problem with my code . 
  not that it 's especially difficult a skill to acquire . 
  like the other comment says , just reading the damn error message that comes up rather than dismissing it as `` a red error '' goes a long damn way . 
  just for full clarification , the quiz is meant to be taken by * citizens * of the countries listed , but the question on the first page is asking for country of * residence * , right ? 
  because it 's a significant difference . 
  because publicly she was very useful to the reddit community , and she was fired without any attempt to fill her position with someone else . 
  had they communicated better and said that she had to be let go and that someone will fill her position permanently within the month , and in the meantime someone already working at reddit would act in her role temporarily , the things would have been much better . 
  as it was , all the subreddits that used her to help with amas have been completely left in the dust until they can make some new arrangements . 
  this is especially problematic for amas that were planned for the next few days . 
  i miss age of empires . 
  i 've been playing aom and aok recently , but they feel pretty dated , especially aok , which is honestly a pretty terrible game by today 's standards even in its re-released form . 
  i wish ensemble had n't been disbanded . 
  the civ games are great , but they 're a turn based strategy game , so it 's a very different type of game to aoe . 
  much larger in scale , and * much * longer to play . 
  i 've heard that quote before , only it was about economists , not jews . 
  age of empires 2 : age of kings is certainly the more popular of the two . 
  i loved then both as a kid . 
  but having gone back and played the remastered versions of both , aok has aged really poorly .
