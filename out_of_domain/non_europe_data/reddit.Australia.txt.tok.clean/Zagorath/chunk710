  the lack of shift clicking to line up commands , the large square grid , the abysmal pathfinding compared to age of mythology 's build queues that can mix units and upgrades , pixel accurate building locations , and pathfinding that 's sometimes a little * too * good . 
  well , age of kings is clearly the inferior game by modern standards . 
  wait , what was it ? 
  yeah , i have a very hard time believing hawaiian is more popular than the standard cheese pizza , or pepperoni pizza , which is nearly synonymous with just `` pizza '' . 
  all three of you are crazy . 
  both mushrooms and pineapple are awful on pizza . 
  pineapple has the redeeming factor that it 's at least nice on its own , though . 
  pineapple is one of my favourite fruits . 
  probably top three . 
  but for some reason , some people seem to have gotten the idea that it 's acceptable to mix it in with other foods that are n't fruits . 
  it 's just awful when mixed with things . 
  hawaiin pizza is n't the only monstrous example of this : basically any meal with `` sweet and sour '' sauce also thinks pineapple makes sense mixed with other foods . 
  * 4e had a really cool range of options for player vampires * . 
  there was the ** vryloka race ** , which provided some cool vampiric flavour in a well-balanced race . 
  there was the ** vampire class ** , which had progression in your vampiric powers in the same way a wizard or fighter might progress in their abilities as they gain levels . 
  both of these were in the heroes of shadow book . 
  they made great options for players that worked well with the rest of the game 's balance . 
  there were also a few other vampire related rules , like at least one feat , and at least one other rule that i ca n't remember right now . 
  * 5e , unfortunately , has no such options * . 
  the latest survey had an option for the vryloka as a race that you 'd like to see , so if you want vampires , i 'd suggest [ taking the survey ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/june_survey2015 ) and selecting vryloka . 
  maybe also write in at the bottom a request for a scaling vampire class . 
  might also be worth requesting the ravenloft setting , since it 's one that thematically works well with vampires , and if they do that setting , they might also add vampire options , even if the vryloka does n't get a lot of votes in its own right . 
  the only thing 5e has for player vampires at the moment is a sidebar in the monster manual 's `` vampire '' entry . 
  it 's completely unbalanced as an actual player option . 
  it immediately grants 18 in all the physical stats , unless they already have higher than that . 
  they also immediately gain all the powers of a vampire . 
  rules as written , they 're also supposed to immediately become lawful evil , and ca n't change that . 
  so no interesting characters where the vampire tries to fight against their innate nature . 
  nothing like serana from skyrim , either . 
  it 's clearly meant as a temporary curse rather than an actual player option . 
  i love darren shan !, 
  his saga was my first real introduction to vampires , and it 's still my favourite take on them . 
  i particularly like how it acknowledges the general vampire lore , but subverts it in some ways . 
  their explanation of the mythology for the `` vampires ca n't cross running water '' was particularly cool , i thought . 
  hope you share the results with us , this should be interesting !, 
  god damn wikipedia has specifically decided no one should be signed in more than 60 days or something . 
  i mean , at least they tell you that they do it , but it 's frustrating when i only make an edit about that often . 
  serious question : i 'm working on my first real website , mainly just as a personal project to learn the process . 
  what the correct secure way to manage keeping someone logged in across multiple sessions ? 
  specifically in a lamp stack site . 
  4e was good with it . 
  i know it 's a common criticism of 4e that `` everything was just the same sort of magic '' , and while i do n't agree with that point of view , i 'm not going to address it here . 
  as far as psionics went in 4e , they were one of the * most * unique systems . 
  it eschewed the normal at-will , encounter , daily system used by every other class , in favour of at-wills that can be enhanced with power points , and dailies as normal . 
  i had n't really realised it until now , but you are so right . 
  there 's definitely a strong amount of outcry over basically everything new that gets added for one reason or another . 
  ac 5 should be an auto hit for pretty much any character at level 5 . 
  at least a +4 stat mod , plus a minimum of 2 on the d20 ( since a 1 is an auto-fail on an attack roll ) . 
  hell , since you 'd also be adding proficiency , you should be able to auto-hit even before the level 4 stat boost . 
  +3 stat mod , +2 proficiency . 
  only reason to roll for it at all is for a 1 or 20 . 
  is this a reference to holst 's * the planets * , or am i missing something ? 
  i like it from a thematic point of view . 
  i watched young justice and absolutely loved the character of m'gann m'orzz , with her telepathic and telekinetic powers . 
  the mental battles between her and other telepaths ( psimon especially ) were particularly cool . 
  and the effect we saw of it in season 2 just made for such a great character arc . 
  i had a similar interest in mental battles between mages in eragon , and with occlumency & legilimency in harry potter , though they were less well explained . 
  i could n't give a crap about min/maxing . 
  the title of the post should never , ever , under any circumstances , contain spoilers . 
  some people subscribe to a subreddit without being completely up to date with a show , or visit it for clarification on one particular thing that they 're up to so far . 
  some people might see a post in / r/all and that could he their first introduction to the show at all . 
  no fair if the first thing they see is a major spoiler . 
  it takes very little effort to leave spoilers out of the title , and to appropriately mark all spoilers in the body or in comments , like the above commenter did . 
  it 's about equal to the best finesse weapon though , is n't it ? 
  edit : though without adding a relevant stat modifier , i guess . 
  i agree it 's a lot , but i like the flexibility it gives and i hope they do n't change it just to make it easier . 
  in 4e with my psion , i kept track of my power points by keeping physical tokens and moving them from an unspent pile to a spent pile . 
  toothpicks or something you can get a lot of cheaply work well . 
  hell , in america , the uk , or the eurozone you could use money , with 1c/p = 1 point . 
  not so great for those of us in aus , canada , or nz that got rid of the 1c coin , but still . 
  the mental workload is n't really too difficult to deal with . 
  i 've got ta be honest , i do n't like this as a dming style . 
  for me , i feel that without * really * specific reasons directly related to the plot , everything official should be open to players . 
  i do n't like the idea of saying you ca n't be a monk because i do n't like it , or you ca n't be a psion because it does n't feel right to me . 
  if you want to do it , that 's your prerogative , but it 's not a style of dming i 'd want anything to do with . 
  now , if you wanted to say something really specific like `` this campaign takes place really early in the history of the world , and magic has n't been heavily studied yet , so no wizards at first level , but you can be warlocks or sorcerers , and you might be able to multiclass into wizard later depending on where the campaign goes '' , or something relating to gods not being present and banning clerics and paladins , that 's different . 
  but then the campaign should actually use that specifically to its advantage , such as with growing understanding of magic being a theme in that first example . 
  now , restricting content that is n't official , like online homebrews or beta material from an unearthed arcana , is obviously different , and i 'm completely fine with that . 
  so obviously for now , leaving psionics out of 5e is something i 'm completely fine with . 
  again , if you and your players want to ban official stuff anyway , that 's fine for you . 
  just not my thing . 
  yeah i played it only a few weeks ago and this is what i did . 
  the gameplay is just so dull , but by god they crafted such am incredible story it was worth slogging through it on easy . 
  yeah i agree , at least with gameplay . 
  i loved mass effect . 
  pausing occasionally to give my squad specific orders , but playing mostly an over the shoulder shooter . 
  it 's a system that just works . 
  but dragon age 's birds ' eye view of the squad using fantasy powers just did n't work nearly as well . 
  i hated the gameplay . 
  loved the story in both , though . 
  so i just played through da on easy , while i played me on a harder difficulty . 
  let me mostly ignore the gameplay of da and concentrate on the story . 
  not just anime and games . 
  korean soap operas are hilariously bad if you 're someone who does n't like the melodrama . 
  and their popularity extends beyond just korea : i know i 've seen a lot of people in vietnam ( where i used to live ) watching them . 
  man , after his role on chuck , even knowing that his character in arrow was based on a real comic book hero , i could n't trust him for ages . 
  i honestly liked his superman film more than man of steel . 
  i did n't like it at the time , but in hindsight it 's more just `` meh '' , rather than shitting over what i like about superman like mos did . 
  i 've noticed that mos tends to be fairly polarising . 
  i 've met a few people who really like it , and a few that revile it like i do .
