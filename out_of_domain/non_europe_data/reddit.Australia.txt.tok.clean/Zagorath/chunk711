  not many in between . 
  but pretty much everyone thinks routh 's film was meh . 
  the key point is that if something is banned , that is explicitly a point that gets addressed . 
  you do n't just ban something because you do n't like it or because `` it does n't fit in my vision of the world '' : you ban it because its abscence is a major point that gets addressed in the setting/plot . 
  hahaha . 
  that 's really interesting . 
  not particularly surprising , since latin american soaps also have a tendency to be really melodramatic , but it is interesting . 
   peter parkour, 
  oh god i love this . 
  quite a few things . 
  i did n't like the style of its narrative with the flashbacks and what have you . 
  non-linear storytelling can be great , but i thought it was done poorly in this case . 
  i thought the whole `` you have to keep your powers secret until the right time '' thing was just complete bullshit . 
  he could have saved his father fro more tornado . 
  there was ** no ** good reason he did n't . 
  they just wanted to force a tragic backstory in , and it was ** awful ** . 
  the amount of destruction just felt wrong . 
  superman never really seemed to care about how many buildings were just being destroyed . 
  it was like he never cared about actually saving lives . 
  on a related note , i actually * do n't * necessarily mind that he killed the bad guy at the end ( though i know that some people do ) . 
  that made sense , though i sympathise with others who dislike it and think it goes against superman 's character . 
  however i do think that scene was poorly acted . 
  i also was not a fan of the music . 
  i 'm a huge fan of film & tv music , but hans zimmer is massively overrated . 
  not * bad * per se , but really overrated . 
  to specifically give one example with superman , i thought he did a decent job of writing a main theme that fit the mood of the new movie . 
  it was actually a really great motif . 
  but then he just never really developed the theme . 
  it kinda just felt like it was building and building without ever reaching a climax . 
  the igcse ( international gcse , and the gcse is the curriculum taught in years 10 & 11 of highschool in the uk ) ict course required we do this . 
  honestly the practical aspect of the course was a total joke . 
  we also had to do such things as set the margins on a word document to a specific width and print that out . 
  just a tip , since it 's an imgur album , i 'm pretty sure you can actually rearrange them after the fact to put them in the right order . 
  you may have already done so , i ca n't tell , the images are doing funny things for me on mobile and i ca n't actually read them . 
  the practical aspect of it is basically a couple of hours going through a couple of projects making use of word processing , website building ( only html and css ) , database design ( we used access ) , spreadsheet software , and i think presentation software . 
  you basically follow the instructions to the letter and print out what you 've got at a few ( specified ) points along the way . 
  with the margins thing , there would be a few paragraphs of text you had to copy and paste in from a website they set up , and they 'd measure them using that . 
  but she started by saying they `` blossomed because of decent writing . 
  they are not some pipe dream '' which sounds in support of olicity ... 
  so she 's sending mixed messages . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  the other comments seem to imply it was originally posted in the order on this album , but that the order of the actual events , the first post takes place last . 
  nope , no creativity . 
  it 's just about learning the real basics of how to use these software programmes . 
  not easy to cheat , though , since it 's not so much about knowing what to do as how to do it , and you ca n't easily see anyone else 's screen if the room is set up properly . 
  for what it 's worth , the theory aspect to the course is significantly less awful . 
  4 hours `` email address validation '', 
  then i assume you pronounce scuba so that the u is the same as the u in underwater ? 
  and nasa you pronounce more like n-air-sa ? 
  simple fact is , that 's not how acronyms work . 
  i just started using onenote recently ( its full version has been on os x for a while ) and it also has the smiley . 
  which is convenient , since it has some * really * serious flaws i needed to point out ... 
  i 'm just hoping they 've done something to make it work properly . 
  damn 2011 version runs like utter crap , and keyboard shortcuts just plain do n't work with the dvorak -- \u2318 qwerty layout . 
  yeah , i 'm not american , and even though i can get windows and a bunch of other microsoft stuff free through dreamspark thanks to my uni , one thing i * ca n't * get is the latest office . 
  i would never want to touch anything older than 4e . 
  to me they 're just needlessly complicated and terribly balanced . 
  i loved 4e , and to be honest i think 80 % of the criticism levied at it is utter bullshit from people who never gave it a fair go . 
  but i 'm not going to comment any more on that here . 
  that said , i do actually prefer 5e , so i will say that i certainly do n't prefer 4e to `` every other edition '' . 
  but from the looks of it , op * does * , and really , that 's what matters in this thread . 
  edit : the parent comment has been edited . 
  it used to say something along the lines of `` is there anyone that prefers 4e over every other edition '' . 
  player 's handbook is a good place to learn the basic rules of the game . 
  considering this got downvoted pretty badly , you might be best deleting it and resubmitting with a more appropriate title . 
  just a tip , you should check out [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) . 
  you can make the `` greentext '' look just by using standard blockquotes . 
  my thought was that it 's a variable using the syntax of a programming language like php or an environment like bash . 
  hahaha . 
  someone `` reported '' this post , and for a bit i was confused . 
  there 's clearly nothing wrong with it !, 
  in fact , it 's one of the best stories we 've had here in quite a while !, 
  then i read the message , and it turns out the person was n't trying to report it as against the rules , they wanted to get the mods ' attention to nominate this for the hof !, 
  a rather unorthodox approach , but i must say it actually seems a pretty cool idea ... 
  [ here 's a picture ] ( https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/screenshots/pics/7698e564a98735332dfb5b8d84e8b4ac/medium.jpg ) . 
  i 'm afraid you 'll have to come up with the stats yourself , though . 
  i think if anyone is using that rule today it 's probably because they 're trying to reverse engineer it based on the fact that an enemy with crx should be a moderate difficulty encounter for a party of 4 adventurers of level x. 
  of course , the maths does n't really work in reverse like that , but i can see why some people might think it would . 
  the problem is that they really ca n't make it too much more powerful , because if it starts to feel like gold is essential to having a good reddit experience , people will feel like they 're being taken advantage of . 
  kinda like it 's one of those pay to win mobile games . 
  oh god now i desperately want levi and strahovski to make appearances in the arrowverse . 
  i only know her from the music she did for the lord of the rings , and i thought she was great in that . 
  of course , that means i 'm hardly qualified to actually answer the question . 
  just thought i 'd throw in my two cents . 
  yeah , this is exactly what i thought this would be . 
  if that 's not it , then what the hell is it ? 
  is it just the ability to automatically input you start and end destinations on your phone from your desktop ? 
  what a completely dull and pointless feature if so ... 
  what 's the difference between a violin and a viola ? 
  the viola burns longer . 
  the viola holds more beer . 
  you can tune the violin . 
  what 's the difference between a viola and a trampoline ? 
  you take your shoes off to jump on a trampoline . 
  why do violists stand for long periods outside people 's houses ? 
  they ca n't find the key and they do n't know when to come in . 
  because fuck you google is an american company and fuck anyone not in america . 
  amazon is just as bad ( probably worse , actually ) , as is microsoft . 
  being non-american , this shit gets so tiring so fast . 
  is this a thing ?
