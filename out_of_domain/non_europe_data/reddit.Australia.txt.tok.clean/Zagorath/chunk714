  for something like `` pull a sword out of something it 's stuck in '' , if they 're trying to do it in combat , that 's cool . 
  but if they 're trying to do it out of combat , when there 's really no pressure on them for time or anything , i 'd think you should just let them automatically succeed . 
  my first character was asexual . 
  not for any metagaming reasons , but because i read through the races in the players handbooks , saw the shardmind , and thought `` oooh , this looks really awesome '' . 
  and to me it just made sense that a sentient bunch of crystal held together by psionic energy would probably be asexual . 
  wait , hodor is a turd ? 
  i always thought he was pretty chill . 
  honestly i think it sounds kinda fair . 
  my first campaign , one of the players named their character `` ash ketchum '' . 
  this was among others with names like krolm , zagorath , and gar . 
  i nearly put in a bit where it says `` i 'd rather they veto it , but punishment is a good alternative '' , but then i thought , well , perhaps the punishment could make sense * in character * . 
  if you 're in a world where people have names like borash ironfist and daeron swiftwind , and your name is bigus dickus , people are going to react to that . 
  so if the punishment happens in a non meta-gamey way , that seems pretty reasonable . 
  so long as you warn the player about it beforehand . 
  my players are going there next session because they burned the map that was with gundren when they rescued him , and they found out that there is a druid in thundertree who knows the location of the mines . 
  i also wrote gundren 's brothers out of the plot because they seemed an unecessary complication , so there 's no rush to find them . 
  the answer is simple . 
  he does n't give a fuck about actually getting this to happen . 
  he 's doing it for domestic reasons , because he 's found that the only thing that 's working for his polling ratings is fearmongering over security issues . 
  the poms start complaining about heat if it gets to like 25 . 
  but ... all google does is tell you the times that translink services run at ... 
  my first suggestion would be double check the books . 
  / r/dnd and / r/dndnext have problems with people coming to ask the most trivial questions that could be answered from the books , and you do n't want to be one of those people . 
  [ this was a particularly bad recent example ] ( / r/dnd/comments / 3cq4s7/bonus _ actions_5e / ) . 
  after that , some googling can help . 
  often there 'll be a post from sage advice where someone on the d&d team has stated their interpretation of the rules . 
  alternatively , you might find someone on reddit or elsewhere has already asked , and people have come together to share their thoughts on the matter already . 
  failing that , honestly , / r/dnd and / r/dndnext tend to give good advice in threads that ask for it . 
  [ may it be ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoykcydmkbs ) , from the credits to fellowship of the ring . 
  and [ an\u00edron ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq6lcxnes4u ) . 
  if you do n't share results on this one i 'm gon na find where you live and murder you in your sleep . 
  banning encryption would be so fucking retarded . 
  online commerce and banking would become utterly impossible , because no one want to send that information in the clear . 
  mac 's ubuntu htpc . 
  mac needs to watch his tv . 
  could they ? 
  absolutely !, 
  but an important part of what shardminds are is that they really do n't feel emotion , except in the most exceptional circumstances . 
  so the way i played it was that it ( and i usually referred to it as an it , rather than he or she , since i figured they 're also agendered/asexed ) would generally not feel emotion unless it was related to a person it had been close with for a long time , at which point there would be a really strong bond . 
  for me the defining precedent is gin . 
  it swaps one soft consonant for another without * adding * anything . 
  plus it just sounds nicer . 
  but personally i just accept that both are right . 
  the only people wrong are the ones who insist that theirs is the right way . 
  i certainly expect to hear this mentioned by him on the next security now . 
  look , if you prefer to pronounce it with a hard g , that 's fine . 
  i think it sounds terrible , but that 's neither here nor there . 
  but do ** not ** use that justification for it . 
  it 's utter bullshit . 
  no other acronym uses that system . 
  think about the `` u '' in scuba . 
  it stands for underwater , but you do n't pronounce the word `` scuhba '' , do you ? 
  same with nasa . 
  the first `` a '' stands for `` aeronautics '' . 
  but it 's not `` nairsa '' . 
  the * only * real justification for it is `` i prefer it that way '' , which is totally fine , since both pronunciations are accepted in general ( so it 's not like the `` aks '' situation , where there is a simple case of a mispronunciation versus a correct pronunciation ) . 
   the creators are technicians , not linguists, 
  fine , then [ let 's ask an actual linguist , shall we ? 
  ] ( https://stancarey.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/you-can-pronounce-gif-any-way-you-like/ ), 
  no other acronym is pronounced specifically * because * of that zip is pronounced how it is because that 's the only way that makes sense . 
  australia has excellent healthcare and our abc ( and the commercial free to air stations ) is completely free . 
  but then , we also do n't produce the incredible scripted content that comes out of the bbc , so i guess it 's one of those `` pick two of three '' situations . 
  i could be wrong , but was n't dracula one of his first really big roles ? 
  if so , that ca n't be a coincidence . 
  clearly he actually * is * a vampire , right ? 
  the hobbits ' swords are n't named , apart from sting . 
  as the other user said , only important swords are named . 
  sting was n't even named at the time it was found ( in the hobbit , it was found along with glamdring and orcrist in the hoard of the trolls ) . 
  it got its name because it stang the spiders . 
  welp , i guess we can retire this meme now . 
  it 's never going to be used in a more appropriate manner . 
  so does billy , tbh . 
   people are n't angry that the bible is being used to persecute others ... they 're angry that the bible is able to be used to persecute others, 
  nah , i 'm angry at both . 
  if the bible existed exactly as it does now , but there were n't any fucktard religious dickheads who use it to persecute others : if * all * christians just went `` you know what , that 's stupid , let 's just be nice to one another '' ( as i 'm sure * most * christians * do * , at least the ones i know ) , then i would n't have any problem with it being theoretically * able * to persecute someone . 
  so as a christian , how do you decide whether to act and live your life according to the following :, 
  deut 24:1, 
   when a man hath taken a wife , and married her , and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes , because he hath found some uncleanness in her : then let him write her a bill of divorcement , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house . 
  divorce is permitted . 
  matt 5:32, 
   but i say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery . 
  divorce is forbidden . 
  and the same question in general applies to any of the many , * many * contradictions within the bible . 
  you can choose to believe a book put together nearly 2000 years ago is the literal word of god if you want , but it is impossible to do so without admitting that there are some contradictions in said book . 
  have you tried eating the spines of a hedgehog while hanging upside down from a chandelier that 's gently swinging ? 
  that usually works for me . 
  no , it was footage taken on site at the time . 
  i dunno exactly why it is , but [ mine is a * little * less apple-y ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h00njrz.png ) . 
  fwiw , i did this search on my mac , but i do n't use any other apple stuff . 
  i do n't suppose you happen to use a few different apple devices ? 
  probably a location based thing , then . 
  i 'd guess most people in your area probably are more likely to use apple products . 
  or perhaps they for what ever reason do n't have enough data from your usage to determine that you * do n't * have apple stuff . 
  who knows ... 
  haha i get exactly the same ones there . 
  both look equally weirded out to me . 
  ninjaedit : actually , i might say that the left one seems more confused , and the right is disturbed . 
  but certainly i would n't say either is happier . 
  mate , green is a primary colour . 
  yellow is produced by blending green and red light .
