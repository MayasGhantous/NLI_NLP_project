  in a conversation with someone a few days ago , i found out that in certain cases , for privacy reasons , a wikipedia admin will completely remove a revision from the history . 
  the guy said that if you were to send him an email , he might be able to remove the revision from your page that had your full real name in it . 
  i can pm you the details if you want . 
  if i click my individual squad members to go behind me while i cast a spell , and they immediately turn around and go in the opposite direction and get themselves killed , that is bad gameplay . 
  i do n't care if it 's `` how the genre plays '' , if that 's the case , it is a flaw in the genre . 
  if a player has a very clear idea of what they want their squad to do , and the gameplay mechanics make that difficult to do , even though it is entirely within the party 's abilities , then that is bad game design . 
  edit : ( also , might be worth seeing the edit i made to the previous comment , in case that changes anything . ), 
  regarding `` damn '' and `` bastard '' , i certainly would n't think either of those are particularly bad . 
  damn especially is just so far from a swear word that i would honestly just completely dismiss anyone who thinks otherwise . 
  funny thing is , i 'd probably consider `` dipstick '' way more rude than damn or bastard , and in that conversation you used it completely casually . 
  though apparently the maths in the ua that gave us roll for defence was not balanced correctly . 
  the comments on those threads provided better versions . 
  [ episode 13 of the critical success podcast ] ( http://peachesandhotsauce.com/podcasts/11-voicing-characters ) has some very good advice regarding voicing characters . 
  i 'd highly recommend it . 
  in fact , i 'd highly recommend the whole podcast . 
  it has a lot of good advice for dms , or just general information for players . 
  final fantasy is a series i just totally can not even get close to . 
  i 'm sure the stories are great , but the gameplay is just really not enjoyable to me . 
  yeah i tried it once about a year or so ago and eventually gave up on it . 
  tried it again a couple of months ago and eventually managed to get through it on easy mode . 
  i 'm glad i did , though now i 'm struggling again with the dlc . 
  they need to be less than 200 runs behind , so at least 367 would be required . 
  oh thank god i 'm not the only one thinking this . 
  they 're going on and on about it , repeating basically the same stuff `` well he probably thought he did make it '' , `` he would n't have appealed it if he did n't actually think he caught it '' , `` it 's conclusively touched the ground there '' . 
  we get it . 
  you can move on now , thanks . 
  probably worth noting that , as / u/icarus82 says , test cricket is n't a series , it 's a single game that just happens to be played over 5 days . 
  the same score is kept across multiple days . 
  if at the end of the 5th day , the 4th innings has n't ended ( either by the last batter being given out , or by the last team to bat reaching the required run total ) , the match is declared a draw . 
  cricket also has series . 
  the ashes , which take place every two years ( roughly ) between england and australia , are a series of 5 test matches . 
  so that 's a total of 25 days of cricket , with a few days rest between each individual match in the series . 
  there are a number of other test series that take place , i 'm just mentioning the ashes because they 're taking place right now ( you 'll see the stickied thread in this subreddit is a live discussion of the game ) .

  people in general seem to have very little understanding of intellectual property laws , but by far the biggest problem is that people seem to have * no * understanding of the fundamental differences between copyright , trademarks , and patents . 
  the statement that `` if you do n't defend it , you lose it '' is true [ * to some extent * ] ( https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/11/trademark-law-does-not-require-companies-tirelessly-censor-internet ) for ** trademarks ** . 
  it is not true in any way about copyright . 
  basically , if you are n't actively using the d&d trademark , they * do n't * have an * obligation * to tell you to stop . 
  now , i do n't know enough about copyright law to be able to say whether or to what extent creating your own world and your own monsters in the d&d system would be considered copyright infringement , but it certainly could be done without infringing on their trademark . 
  the cases of online tools being taken down have mostly been ones where they were using material from wizards : detailing spells , rules , etc. 
  wizards has every right ( but * no obligation * ) to issue takedowns in these cases .

  really ? 
  that makes me sad :(, 
  i always smile at the bus driver and say `` hi '' when i get on , and yell a `` thanks '' on the way out . 
  i thought that was pretty standard ... 
  i 've often wondered whether it would be worth just not paying for public transport . 
  like , would the amortised cost of paying a fine if you ever get caught be more or less than the cost of just paying for the bus each time ? 
  i know that i 've never * once * had an inspector check me before , so it seems like you 'd nearly always get away with it . 
  how much are the fines ? 
  not that i 'd ever * actually * do it . 
  i like our public transport system in brisbane , i think it 's actually a really good one . 
  it would feel wrong to cheat it .

  honestly i just want a good adblocker that works properly with a * blacklist * . 
  i 've tried it using ab + a while back , and it kept forgetting my list . 
  i want to be able to manually block ads on select sites that are overly obnoxious ( namely : video or audio ads on pages where the actual * content * being consumed is silent ) , but leave all ads displaying by default , and have it * remember * that setting properly . 
  blocking youtube ads is actually one of the worst cases of ripping of content creators by continuing to consume their content while removing their revenue source . 
  apart from the absolute biggest accounts , youtube ad money is really hard to get by on , and people blocking ads only makes it worse . 
  youtube is one site where you should * really * be leaving ad-block turned off . 
  can you let me know of an adblocker that works in blacklist mode ? 
  i tried that with ab + a while back , but it would frequently forget the sites blacklisted , or would just switch back to the whitelist mode . 
  so i ended up removing the ad blocker entirely . 
  why would you want to change it ? 
  if you are n't involved in archery or shooting , i ca n't think of any case where it actually matters . 
  and it 's actually an * advantage * in certain areas . 
  photography , for example , is a pain for someone left-eye dominant , since camera eyepieces and buttons are placed such that you can easily access the important buttons with your right eye to the eyepiece , but if you use your left eye , your face blocks buttons . 
  for what it 's worth , my dad 's right-handed and left eye dominant , while i 'm left and left . 
  in general , eait does not allow be students to take a language course . 
  they do , however , say that in limited circumstances approval might be given , so if you have some extenuating circumstances , it might be worth a shot .

  edit : [ this is a much better one , though you 'd need to have seen the game to fully get it . 
  for reference , one of the referees was named hayne , as was one of the players on the nsw side -- the game was nsw vs queensland . 
  i do n't agree that it is . 
  you 're watching video content , so video ads are , in my opinion , acceptable ( as long as they are n't playing * during * the video itself ) . 
  if you 're trying to read an article , and over the side some video starts playing making a heap of noise , * that * is bad . 
  but people need to realise that these sites ca n't exist if they ca n't make money . 
  blocking ads on youtube is hurting the video producers , and it is not any more excusable than blocking them anywhere else . 
  yeah , it feels to me like you have to contort your hand to hold the thing , compared to the nice symmetry of the playstation controller .
