  ( in fact , from [ my googling ] ( http://www.macroevolution.net/hybrid-infertility.html ) , it seems like * scientists * are n't even 100 % on exactly what causes it , though it was only an extremely cursory search . ), 
  wait , that 's a dog ? 
  i thought it was a cat . 
  ctrl-l is the best shortcut to teach people since it works on all three desktop platforms , windows , linux , and os x ( swapping ctrl for cmd in the latter case , of course ) . 
  but i think op 's point was that this is if you want to * force * a search query . 
  for example if your query resembles a url . 
  present, 
  meta : ping for the update, 
   the mainstream press is actively refusing to cover the government 's legislation, 
  this is a very bold claim . 
  have they actually specifically stated as much ? 
  if so , where ? 
  if not , what evidence would you present to back up this claim ? 
  `` today you , tomorrow me '' is fine . 
  it 's the `` that is , simply beautiful '' that 's wrong . 
  a pause with a comma sounds different to a pause from an ellipsis or an em dash . 
  the comma just makes it sound awkward and wrong . 
  if it had been an ellipsis , it would have sort of `` faded out '' on the `` is '' , which would have provided the sense of wonder that / u/st0pmakings3ns3 was probably going for . 
  ( though personally i think it would 've sounded better with a pause after either `` that '' or `` simply '' . 
  putting it after `` is '' feels fairly awkward anyway . 
  but that 's just a personal preference . ), 
   i 'm only likely to view this video on my phone, 
  this is key . 
  the * only * time it is * ever * acceptable to do vertical video is if it 's * only * ** ever ** going to be viewed on a phone or at most a tablet . 
  if you plan on emailing it to people , or uploading it anywhere on the internet ( such as youtube ) , vertical video is a no , and i 've been a bit of a warrior against vertical video ( like many people in this thread , i suspect ) . 
  i 've definitely linked to that psa video quite a few times . 
  personally i often use vertical video on snapchat , but i never use it anywhere else . 
  because i know my sister ( who 's the only person i use the app with ) will be viewing it on a tablet , it works fine . 
  imo some of the longer ones are the better ones . 
  [ we have a hall of fame ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/wiki/hof ) that lists some of the stories that have been received the best by the community , and i 'd certainly recommend anyone interested in the medium start there . 
  they 're categorised ( roughly ) by length , which should help people who ca n't afford the time to read 10 pages of epic prose . 
  ah , well then that 's very worrying . 
  the press should not be in the job of actively censoring half of the political debate . 
  i wonder , would / u/doggie015 and / u/phyllicanderer care to comment on this publicly ? 
  mine is . . ? 
  that 's fine . 
  it 's just that / u/jnd-au 's post seemed to be implying that you were just refusing to cover government legislation in general , rather than one specific piece of arguably minor legislation . 
  meta : you can remove the '' [ honourable ] '' , that 's in the op so that nominations of a member who already has the title of honourable ( which i believe is earned by having previously served as either a minister or speaker , though i 'm not entirely sure ) are reminded to include it . 
  ic : seconded . 
  i thank the member for their nomination , but i must respectfully decline . 
  for this term of parliament , i have decided i would rather be involved more directly in the process of creating and passing good legislation , which i could not do as speaker or deputy speaker , as those positions are required to be as neutral as possible . 
  edit : typo, 
  sounds fair to me . 
  mr speaker , i , zagorath , move : that the member / u/zamt , member for regional victoria be elected second deputy speaker . 
  edit : added in signature, 
  zagorath , member for brisbane and surrounds, 
  mr speaker , i would point you to a slight error in the nomination summaries . 
  / u/lurker281 is not a member of the greens , they are a part of the socialist alternative .

  [ here are a few analogies for the size of ipv6 ] ( http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_ipv6addresssizeandaddressspace-2.htm ) :, 
  * it 's enough addresses for many trillions of addresses to be assigned to every human being on the planet . 
  * the earth is about 4.5 billion years old . 
  if we had been assigning ipv6 addresses at a rate of 1 billion per second since the earth was formed , we would have by now used up less than one trillionth of the address space . 
  * the earth 's surface area is about 510 trillion square meters . 
  if a typical computer has a footprint of about a tenth of a square meter , we would have to stack computers 10 billion high blanketing the entire surface of the earth to use up that same trillionth of the address space . 
  it 's crippled , sure . 
  but it 's also currently being offered completely free right now . 
  and the standard price is substantially cheaper . 
  civ v costs $ 70 on steam without any expansions . 
  the price in the mas is $ 38 and includes a couple of the minor expansions . 
  i ca n't speak for everyone , but i basically never play multilayer on civ , since a game takes so long it 's impossible to get a game finished in one session . 
  so it seems to me that the mas version is actually a really good deal even if it were n't being offered free right now . 
  [ i 'm talking about the fact that it 's $ 69.99 for the base game . 
  meta : when proposing a question , it is best ( though not required ) to also include a deadline for voting . 
  i usually made it 1 hour from submission . 
  you should also then page the other members , by replying to the comment in which the question was proposed/put and mentioning at most 3 members by their / u/name . 
  [ see this for an example ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaushr/comments/3ax0vm/33_introduction_of_the_marriage_amendment/csi0w2j?context=3 ) . 
  same goes for the other threads where the same has happened . 
  haha yes , i did mean 1 day . 
  thanks for the clarifications . 
  mr speaker , i wish to include my support for this bill . 
  it is embedded deep in the australian psyche that everyone deserves a fair go , and as such , everyone should be treated equally . 
  we decided as a nation long ago that discrimination based on race was unacceptable , and even longer before that , that discrimination based on sex should not be permitted . 
  now it has come time to end discrimination based on sexuality . 
  there are those that oppose this on religious grounds . 
  but we are a nation that strongly believes in the separation of church and state . 
  no religious institution will be forced to administer an amendment to solemnise a marriage that they do not believe should take place ( indeed , the text of this amendment explicitly notes as such ) . 
  but marriage is not a religious institution , and so discrimination by the state should not be permitted . 
  this amendment is an important step in the right direction , and i commend it to the house . 
  zagorath , member for brisbane and surrounds, 
  it 's a shame they cut most of the scenes that show this . 
  in the actual show i think there 's really only one scene that reveals him to be a fraud , and even it was fairly easy to miss . 
   not really , there is a / r/trueaustralia but it never took off, 
  for good reason . 
  they named themselves wrong . 
  you ca n't name a subreddit `` true australia '' and then have it basically be '' / r/australia but anything political is banned '' . 
  the name was just a lie . 
  it could have been a decent subreddit if they had named it `` nopolaus '' or something like that . 
  they shut down for a while , and it looks like they 're back without that rule , so i would be willing to subscribe to it if it gains any traction . 
  i read the title and thought this * had * to be satire . 
  it 's kinda scary that it 's not ... 
  yup , in ' 98 . 
  however they were n't offered the same deal as the other states in terms of representation . 
  they would have had only 3 senators . 
  and besides , a lot can change in 20 years . 
  that seems a fairly reasonable amount of time to wait between attempts at such major changes . 
  for reference , `` tony '' refers to tony abbott , prime minister of australia , getting the number of flags in the federation star wrong . 
  ( it 's 7 . 
  he said it 's 6 but implied perhaps we should change it to 7 . ), 
  yeah definitely .
