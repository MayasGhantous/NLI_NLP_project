  well , you did n't misread it per se . 
  it actually says :, 
   if you had a close friend that had a non-contagious terminal disease and few days of life left , if ** his ** dying wish was not to die a virgin , would you have sex with ** him/her ** ? 
    this person has no stds * and is of the gender you are attracted to * , ** he/she ** is also not ugly if that would be relevant to your decision . 
  if you are in a relationship you partner would not mind any of your decisions . 
  emphasis mine . 
  so most of the time it worked for either gender , but one time ( crucially , the * first * time ) op only said `` his '' . 
  yeah neither do i. 
  is the fact that the variables are called `` thing '' and `` things '' the funny bit ? 
  or are they rewriting an already built-in python function or something ? 
  because if it 's not one of those things , then this seems like a pretty well-written concise method . 
  twenty bars ? 
  i played first clarinet and i can remember many occasions when i 've had more than 20 bars rest . 
  yeah , i ca n't imagine running laps like that . 
  i 've got a nice course that goes along a dirt path for half of it , going around the nearby university . 
  it 's almost exactly 5 km per loop , so keeping track of my distance is easy . 
  this sounds great . 
  i was disappointed at / r/dndbehindthescreen 's recent rule changes because i found content that was being banned really useful . 
  i 'm glad there 's a new place for that stuff to go . 
  i hope you 've cross posted this to / r/dnd and / r/dndnext , because if a significant amount of people do n't know about it , it 'll lose its value . 
  my problem with inspiration is that my players never bloody spend it , so i ca n't give it out as much as i would like . 
  i 've found underscores seem to be * slightly * more common than hyphens , though either way , there 's certainly not much in it . 
  as matt says , wikipedia also uses underscores . 
  perhaps my perception was out since i use wikipedia and reddit far more than any blogging platform . 
  thanks for the video , though , it was really interesting . 
  ( side note : i was surprised to see what matt cutts looks like , after having heard his voice a few times on the twig podcast . ), 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/zagorath, 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/zagorath, 
   civ 5 uses steamworks so you 'll get a steam key no matter where you buy it, 
  not true . 
  the very recent free giveaways from macrumors was a mac app store version , which does n't use steam . 
  team fortress 2 , elder scrolls online , batman arkham , bioshock infinite , to name a few more from the top of my head . 
  honestly there are a lot of great games . 
  most new games worth playing are cross-platform . 
  yeah true . 
  it does say `` requires steam and a steam account to play '', 
  op asked for * good * games . 
  ^ ^ ^ kidding , ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ swear !, 
  i agree that the second point they made might not hold much weight , but the first definitely does . 
  the biggest defence google has in many legal cases is that they try to keep their results as unaltered as possible . 
  that they simply try to point people to the best content out there . 
  if they were to blacklist companies like this because they were running smear campaigns against google , that would provide * significant * ammo against them . 
  also helps prevent you from making bad spur-of-the-moment purchases by putting a small barrier in the way . 
  that was different because the lawsuit was essentially `` stop using our content on your site '' , so they did exactly that . 
  they * could * have only linked the page and not shown any snippets , but that would clearly have been detrimental to users , so it was easier to actually just unlist them . 
  it 's also an actual * lawsuit * which , if they lost it , could have basically * forced * them to make some change , whereas a smear campaign has a lot less weight behind it . 
  i 've not played it , but i 've heard that knights of the old republic is a good series . 
  the witcher is * technically * available on os x , but i would * highly * recommend avoiding it . 
  the game is utterly unplayable on os x , even after trying a custom wineskin wrapper . 
  as the user above said , tomb raider . 
  assassin 's creed 2 and brotherhood ( which are two of the three or four games from when ubisoft actually gave a shit about making a good ongoing story in the series ) . 
  going through the first 25 pages in steam 's games for os x section , those are the only ones that i 've heard of , plus a few that i 've actually played myself that i could recommend . 
  yeah it is . 
  same goes for most cases in english where the word ends in `` is '' . 
  axis -  axes . 
  hypothesis -  hypotheses . 
  analysis -  analyses . 
  ( in fact , most of the ones on [ this page ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/category:english_irregular_plurals_ending_in_%22-es%22 ) are of that form . ), 
  generally , i would say they go against passive perception unless the players actively say that they 're looking for hidden things . 
  my reading of that law is that it 's not saying that someone passing another person is required to give a horn to pass someone , it 's that if a horn is given , the passee * must * move over to allow the passer to pass them . 
  it 's illegal here in australia to ride without a bell , too . 
  though in our case the law is * completely * unenforced . 
  the expression is actually `` hear , hear '' . 
  it comes from `` hear him , hear him '' . 
  seriously , this stuff is getting old . 
  only one of these two parties gives any fucks about climate change and renewable energy . 
  only one of these two parties wanted to bring australia into the 21st century with quality internet . 
  one of these parties has a much better approach to healthcare and education than the other . 
  sure , they 're similar in a way , but anyone who 's saying that labor is `` just as bad '' as the liberals , or that they 'll `` put them both last '' is either ignorant of the facts , or just fooling themselves . 
  labor is a ** lot ** better than the liberals , and they 're certainly better than the weird minor parties like family first . 
  yeah this is true . 
  it 's kinda similar to octopus . 
  octopodes is the `` most correct '' etymologically , but octopuses is more common , and also correct . 
  octopi is wrong . 
  well , at least i now know i 'm not a psychopath . 
  [ a couple of pics in here ] ( http://dcau.wikia.com/wiki/kyle_rayner ) , as well as the name of the episodes in the dcau that he appeared in . 
  the fact that randall decided to write that comic in chronological order ( rather than reverse chronological order ) throws me off * every * time i see it . 
  i mean , i understand why he did it , but it still throws me off . 
  for reference , this is a very very strong password . 
  worst case scenario , it could take up to 7.83 hundred billion centuries to crack by brute force . 
  but even a single number , capital letter , and symbol would make it substantially stronger , and would break the ability to guess it by attacks that specifically use multiple words from a dictionary ( which you just know have to be in use , especially since the conic came out ) . 
  worst case , correcthorsebatt3rystap!e would take 89.14 trillion trillion centuries , and it 's stronger against attacks that puck multiple words from a dictionary . 
  i use lastpass for most of my passwords , and to remember my lastpass password , i have a particular formula that generate a string of over 20 characters and which involves numerous lower case , upper case , numbers , and symbols , all while being extremely east to remember . 
  [ source of the exact numbers above ] ( https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm ) . 
  that 's still bad ( though less so ) because it means they 're not salting your password hash . 
  present, 
  i think it 's probably more likely that they just have text * asking * people not to use those words , and that their system is actually completely vulnerable to sql injection . 
  the first half of his comment certainly serous . 
  i know my bank does n't allow passwords longer than 8 characters , and that the reason is because they do n't want people forgetting . 
  it 's frustrating as hell , bit i can kinda understand it . 
  at least they lock you out and require verification over phone after just 3 failed attempts , so it 's not * all * bad . 
  yeah , it sounds like the bank heard `` multifactor authentication is more secure '' , and decided `` let 's change our system to have multifactor authentication '' , but did n't actually understand what that means . 
  something you know , regardless of * what * it is you know , is still one factor . 
  got a good source on that ? 
  google uses 60 days , with the option of extensions if the disclosee notifies them . 
  if they 're comparing the first n characters , then this means they are storing it in plain text . 
  hashed passwords ( whether or not they are also salting , though they * should * be ) wo n't have the same first n characters even if the plaintext has the same first n characters . 
  fundamentally , a hash takes something of * any * size , and spits out something that looks pseudo-random of a fixed length . 
  for example , sha-256 spits out 256 bits . 
  if you hash a password that is 6 characters , the result will be 256 bits .
