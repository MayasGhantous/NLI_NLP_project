  i had never even heard of it until i heard that an orchestra i know of was playing it . 
  i 'm okay with it being posted here , because it 's not popular music , and it clearly is something that many people would have heard and recognise it without knowing the name . 
  i also think that the other guy complaining about it is being an arse . 
  but your reasoning in this comment is just wrong . 
  instrumental in a `` no lyrics '' sense this is definitely not . 
  it has very definitive lyrics . 
  it 's not like rachmaninoff 's `` vocalise '' or something . 
  it has words that just about anyone on here would be able to read and pronounce . 
  if not being in english was a valid defence , then one could post german pop songs or something . 
  your conclusion is good , but the reasoning you used to get there is not . 
   do n't know the word for it, 
  i 'm not exactly sure that there is . 
  i 'd probably call it `` choral '' , but that 's a very broad brush . 
  yeah , this * definitely * is location-dependent . 
  i 'm staying two minutes walk away from the university i go to ( which is also a 10 minute bus ride from the centre of the city ) , so it 's clearly an area that 's in very high demand . 
  the rent i 'm charging my roommate is not something i would have been willing to go lower on . 
  in fact , he offered $ 10 per week ( rent in my country is usually weekly , not monthly ) * more * than the asking price just to be considered above all the other people applying -- and it worked . 
  what are you studying exactly , and why is it that you say you `` need '' a mac ? 
  genuine question . 
  i own a mac myself , and there are a number of good reasons to recommend them , but depending on what you 're doing , i might have to disagree that you `` need '' one . 
  for me , i 'm studying software engineering , and the vast majority of it is either aimed at unix stuff or completely agnostic . 
  for example , the course that taught c programming also involved a lot of unix/bash commands that are a pain to get working on windows . 
  a lot of other courses use java , python , or matlab , which are system agnostic . 
  i ca n't stand linux , so os x is by far the best way to go . 
  i also enjoy video editing , and final cut pro is by far the best prosumer application for that . 
  just knocks the competition out of the park . 
  if you 're not doing one of those two fields , or perhaps music production ( i do n't know much about that field to be able to comment -- i 've just heard that a lot of it is done on os x ) or * maaybe * graphical design , i doubt that you really need a mac . 
  how many of the advanced features of excel and word do you use ? 
  google docs do a great job if you 're not using things like pivot tables in excel or the citations functionality in word . 
  just an fyi , the guy replied to your comment [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/samplesize/comments/3fabt3/casual_do_you_carry_a_physical_road_map_in_your/ctnen1x ) . 
  it was in the wrong place , so you wo n't have gotten a notification . 
  thought you might like to know . 
   you clicked on the survey and took it hoping for an `` i do n't have a car '' option, 
  that 's exactly what i did . 
  it 's a survey about how people navigate from location to location -- do they use paper maps , or digital ones , or perhaps they never go anywhere that they need to follow a map for ? 
  well my answer would be `` i do n't drive , i use public transport which takes me to the right place '' . 
  yeah , the op does n't make any sense . 
  if you never put a lockpick up your urethra , no matter what you roll , it should be impossible to succeed . 
  because you 're trying to do the impossible . 
  the reason they do n't message people is that it 's a system that was first created to stop spammers . 
  if spammers got a message letting them know they 'd been banned , they could easily stop using that account and make a new one . 
  unfortunately , they do n't have an alternate site-wide banning system to use against legitimate users who have broken a rule . 
  so shadowbanning is all they do . 
  by the way , i noticed you 're no longer shadowbanned . 
  out of interest , did you find out why it was ? 
  conspiracy theory : that * is * reality . 
  we * live * in that game . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  in cricket ( which i reference because it 's obviously a very similar sport to baseball in a number of ways ) to catch someone out , you must stay inside the rope . 
  if there were a scenario similar to this one , it would be not out . 
  however , what people * do * sometimes do is jump from inside the rope , catch it , and throw it back to someone else , all while in the air -- which * is * out . 
  [ see 4:19 in this video for an example . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/azlxdpu7d2y?t=259 ), 
  it also said `` all welcome '' . 
  yeah i think he meant famous in real life . 
  it 's the most famous song to real life people , * from * the a song of ice and fire universe . 
  origin is * way * better as a platform . 
  literally it 's only problem is that it does n't have the same range of games , or the same existing userbase . 
  now , admittedly , in a platform that exists to ( a ) sell games , and ( b ) provide a community around said games , that 's a * really * big flaw . 
  if origin were to put significant resources into getting more games on their platform , i think they 'd stand a pretty good chance ( so long as they can get people to ignore the existing prejudices -- as deserved as they are in many cases -- against ea ) . 
   ea [ is ] terrible at providing a platform to sell games, 
  this just is n't true . 
  as a platform , origin beats out steam by far . 
  it has a better interface , better customer support , it 's less bloated . 
  the problem with it is that it does n't have the users or the range of games that steam does . 
  that 's a big problem , but it does n't have any bearing on the fact that ea is good at * providing * a platform to sell games . 
  to be fair , it * does n't * work well as a non-solo instrument in a big band . 
  if you use it like goodman did in sing , sing sing , as a solo instrument with the band backing it , that works brilliantly , as it does when you have the clarinet as a solo instrument in like a 5 piece band or something . 
  but yeah , i 've seen a few musicians claim the clarinet does n't work well as a jazz instrument . 
  utter rubbish claim , it is . 
  chances are your uni will probably have computers available . 
  i * know * uq does , and i 'd be surprised if the others do n't , too . 
  another option is to buy one second hand . 
  mine is a mid-2012 non-retina 15 inch mbp . 
  it was the last generation where you could get a discrete graphics card without getting the * very * highest end computer they offered . 
  i do n't know if one of those would be possible to get , but mine was about $ 2,400 new way back then , so it 's probably quite reasonable now , especially second hand . 
  with '' !!, 
  '' , not '' !! '' . 
  it 's an important difference , because the latter does n't work . 
  oh that 's useful . 
  i just wish they used markdown rather than whatever markup language it is they 're using . 
  doing '' * '' and having it be bold rather than italic is annoying . 
  yeah mine runs it just fine . 
  basically any mac with a discrete graphics card will ( and to be honest , even the ones without it run it fairly well , it 's been very well optimised ) . 
  that 's not what the drone 's gps says . 
  it was never under like 270 feet . 
  even with a fairly significant error , it probably still did n't go under 200 feet . 
  oh god no , please do n't take us back to that . 
  bbcode was awful . 
  markdown is just brilliant . 
  it 's what reddit and github use , why ca n't the rest of the industry standardise on that ? 
  best of luck !, 
   if that drone did not go under 200 ' then that drone would not have been shot down . 
  you assert this as fact , but many others in this thread have given their own evidence to the contrary . 
  without some actual evidence , i 'm generally going to assume that the guy who * did n't * hotheadedly decide to shoot something is probably the one in the right ( especially since what evidence we * do * have suggests the same , even if that evidence may not be entirely reliable ) . 
  green . 
  age of empires 2 has received one new expansion * since * the steam hd release ( `` the forgotten '' ) and it 's already confirmed to be getting at least one more . 
  i have n't heard anything about a new aom expansion , though i ' b be super excited if we 're getting one . 
  new expansions for aom ? 
  has that been confirmed , because i have n't heard anything about it .
