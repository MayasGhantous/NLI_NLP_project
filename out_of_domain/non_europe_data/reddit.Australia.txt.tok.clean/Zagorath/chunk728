  the old youtube comment system was terrible , so i was really glad when they changed it ... ), 
  yeah , but who wants to do that that 's no fun !, 
  the biggest difference is the apostrophe/semicolon switch . 
  for regular typing , apostrophes are very common , and semicolons are basically never used . 
  so i find it rather uncomfortable to use programmer 's dvorak for normal writing , and frequently accidentally type a semicolon by mistake . 
  similarly , when coding , i 've trained myself to reach * up * for the semicolon at the end of lines , and in vim i write ` : wq ` without even needing to think . 
  but when i 'm in normal dvorak , i frequently mess that up . 
  basically , i 'm faster at doing each task * using * the keyboard layout designed for it . 
  that said , my suggestion would probably be to learn dvorak first . 
  once you get good at ( i would say you should reach * at least * your current top typing speed as an average typing speed ) , * then * try out a programming dvorak layout . 
  it 'll be easier to learn it that way . 
  because they 're used for distinct tasks , it 's really easy to just subconsciously do what linguists call `` code switching '' , where you instinctively know how to use each in the right situation such that the differences do n't cause confusion if you 're using the right keyboard layout for the job . 
  for clarification , when you say `` this '' are you referring to the filter being clogged , or users trying to fix their filter ? 
  haha interesting . 
  seems like more work than just typing it in , but it 's interesting to know that there 's a way to get around that in case someone does n't know their username or password ( such as if they use a password manager ) . 
  ah awesome , thanks . 
  yeah i was pretty astonished when i installed ubuntu on my desktop and found that i had to ` apt-get ` vim , since it was n't installed out of the box . 
  some key components of os x are also free as in speech . 
  it 's based on a bsd core . 
  oh cool , thanks for the info . 
  until recently it was the only good free way of doing multi-party video chat . 
  the integration with applications like whiteboards or games can be useful/fun , too . 
   ( i 'm hesitant to dole out relationship advice since i do n't know the whole picture . ), 
   i 'd also recommend ... a separate post at r/relationships . 
  good luck !, 
  but that 's exactly what would happen over there . 
  they 're famous for jumping to `` you should break up ! '', 
  straight away with very little evidence outside the one narrow issue that caused the op to make the post . 
   no it definitely was n't , at all . 
  i could n't even tell you were trying to engage in satire . 
  try going with direct logic next time . 
  mate , that says * waay * more about you than it does him . 
  the level of satire in the comment that you first replied to was so high you could see it from the moon . 
   this shit smacks of microsoft . net ... 
  i mean msn ... 
  i mean microsoft passport ... 
  i mean mocrosoft live ... 
  i mean drive ... . . for fuck 's sake . 
  it 's certainly * plausible * , but i have n't seen any actual evidence that it 's anywhere * near * as bad as fifa . 
  i 'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt . 
  does n't seem fair to * assume * that they 're just as bad when there 's no evidence that that 's the case . 
  do you mean when they do it even though it 's clear that 's what you 're talking about , or if they 're asking for clarification because you 've used it in an ambiguous way ? 
  ah cool , thanks for the info !, 
  that definitely does sound nicer than the gc one . 
  actually aluminium has a slightly more interesting story . 
  the abridged version is that its discoverer initially called it alumium , but then decided he did n't like it , and changed it to aluminum . 
  but the scientific body that was responsible for naming things decided to change it to aluminium to be consistent with other element names . 
  as an australian :, 
  schedule . 
   it 's not `` skedd-yule '' , it 's `` shed-yule '' . 
  shed-yule sounds dumb . 
   it 's not `` loo-ten-ant '' , it 's `` lef-ten-ant '' . 
  yes . 
  though i pronounce it slightly more like the french pronunciation : sort of half way between `` lef '' and `` luf '' . 
   iii . 
  herb . 
   it 's not `` erb '' , it 's `` herb '' . 
  the `` h '' is n't silent . 
  oh god yes . 
   it 's not `` bay-zill '' , it 's `` bazz-ill '' . 
  i did n't even know americans pronounced this differently, 
   it 's not `` see-sill '' , it 's `` sess-ill '' . 
  who ? 
  oregano . 
   it 's not `` orray-gannow '' , it 's `` orri-gah-no '' . 
   vii . 
  vitamin, 
   it 's not `` vite-a-min '' , it 's `` vitta-min '' . 
  i 've always hated the british pronunciation of this . 
   viii . 
   it 's not `` gunn '' , it 's `` rooty-tooty point and shooty '' . 
  / roll eyes, 
  eh , i 'm not a fan of this reasoning . 
  just because a word 's constituent parts are pronounced a certain way , does n't mean their combination also should . 
  i mean , sure , in this case that lone of reasoning agrees with my preferred pronunciation , but i would n't use that as an argument to say my way is the `` correct '' way . 
  what did the comment say ? 
  they can today , but many mathematical axioms were used as axioms before they had been proven . 
  so , for reference , my best guess is that what was going on is that it was acting as a proxy . 
  google has built into chrome some added security in that chrome itself knows what certificates should be used on google websites , and when it saw instead the proxy 's certificate , it saw that as a problem , since it did n't match . 
  or david brent . 
  maybe so , but for the prosumer level it is so far ahead of any other application out there it 's just not funny . 
  definitely not the only one . 
  the macbreak weekly podcast has been calling for this for some time ( with a couple of the hosts guessing -- incorrectly , we now know -- that when apple music came out , it would end up being a complete rewrite ) . 
  for a professional making a large scale feature film production ? 
  sure . 
  but at a prosumer level , making short films , higher quality youtube videos , etc. ? 
  not a chance . 
  fcp x just blows it out of the water . 
  how does that make zero sense ? 
  i never claimed it 's still good for professionals . 
  my point from in both my previous comments was that it 's now the * best * product for * prosumers * . 
  you 're arguing against a point i 'm not trying to make . 
  til everyone pronounces scuba , nasa , and jpeg wrong . 
  gnome is pronounced with a hard g. gnome is pronounced with a silent g. 
  one is a desktop environment , the other is a mythical creature or a lawn ornament . 
  seriously , it 's the same every fucking time . 
  people making arguments that are just fucking wrong , other people correcting them . 
  how has this not been put to rest yet ? 
  both are fine , say whatever you damn well please . 
  ninjaedit : except the zhaif people .
