  kids still have to learn the outdated imperial/us measurements , so they 're left needing to learn two different systems . 
  so how does step 1 work , precisely ? 
  would it be the party whip sending a pm to the clerk that they wish to make appointments at the following notice paper ? 
  my tendency would be to agree with the deputy leader of the opposition ( / u/phyllicanderer ) on this matter . 
  in general , having a smaller number of separate committees would , in my view , make it easier for members to keep track of which ones are doing what . 
  i would also add that it would prevent certain committees from having too little to do , and would make it simpler to decide which committee to send what to . 
  for example , i can easily see it being unclear whether a certain bill should go to the economics committee or the tax and revenue one . 
  merging them simplifies that . 
  that said , i do agree with you / u/jnd-au that the mega-merger of education , employment , health , social policy , and indigenous affairs is perhaps a little bit too much , which is why i avoided such a large merger in my own initial proposal . 
  regarding the member 's suggestion to have legal affairs separate , it certainly would * seem * like a logical step , and barring any further input into the matter , i would probably agree with it . 
  that said , the rl parliament has legal affairs as part of the same committee as social policy , and so i chose to also keep it separate , in order to keep down the number of committees whilst avoiding a mega-merger . 
  i 'm not actually sure what `` legal affairs '' entails . 
  unfortunately , as it is one of the general committees , the standing orders give no guidance on this matter . 
  the [ government webpage for the committee ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house/social_policy_and_legal_affairs ) is no help , either . 
  so that makes it kinda tricky . 
   members may wish to debate ... reduction of cross-bench/opposition representation, 
  just for what it 's worth , representation is equal to current orders . 
  general committees in the sos as they currently stand have 6 government and 4 non-government . 
  that has simply been halved to 3 and 2 . 
  the proportion remains constant . 
  wait people actually care about soccer here ? 
  and they * do n't * like the cricket , afl , or league ? 
  mate , this place is unaustralian . 
  edit : but seriously , those sports are all a thousand times better than fucking soccer is . 
  there 's a reason we do n't care about soccer in this country . 
  because we have better sports .

  right click on the ublock button and go to options , and then check `` i am an advanced user '', 
  go to the site you want to block, 
  click on the ublock icon, 
  click '' + requests blocked '', 
  click in the green section of the topmost rectangle in the left column . 
  this , unfortunately , is as far as i 've gotten so far . 
  i know that clicking the red button in the right hand column on * one * of the bold options ( e.g. 
  `` ggpht.com '' , `` gstatic.com '' , `` googlevideo.com '' ) will make this work . 
  i just do n't know which one . 
  ( and indeed , it was my googling to find which one to block that made me find this post , 3 months after it was relevant . ), 
  youtube only shows ads on videos that are either monetised by the uploader , or monetised by a third-party copyright holder ( for example if you used copyrighted music ) . 
  i find the recent development of  30 second unskippable pre-roll video ads absolutely obnoxious * , and i 've come here after googling for a way to specifically only block pre-roll videos . 
  the other forms of advertising on google are absolutely in good taste and help bring in money to small-time youtubers ( who , frankly , make little enough already without arseholes deciding to block even the more tasteful advertising ) . 
  \\* that is to say , until about the last two or three months or so , all the preroll videos i 've had have been either less than 30 seconds , or have been able to be skipped after 4 seconds . 
  lately , i 've been getting full movie trailers and other long ads that have been unskippable . 
  i feel like the only person in this subreddit that really just does n't care about that . 
  fake wrestling ( and , to be fair , real wrestling ) just does n't hold any appeal to me , even if the person doing it is a cool actor in a show i like . 
  i mean , i 'm glad for him that he 's getting to live his dream , but i just wonder why the hell he has that dream . 
  it 's not one that makes sense to me . 
  yeah , that does make sense i guess . 
  perhaps that might be the better way to go , then ? 
  hmm ... 
  what 's that in utc ? 
  [ 7 down , 0.84 up ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/4559017997.png ) . 
  though i ca n't speak for others , but my speed fluxuates like crazy . 
  i 'm getting that now , but at other times i ca n't even stream 240p youtube videos without waiting to buffer . 
  i agree . 
  pineapple is easily in my top 5 , probably top 3 standalone fruits . 
  but it just does * not * work in other food . 
  not on pizza , not cooked in `` sweet and sour '' sauce . 
  eh , i half expected it . 
  i tried to word it as respectfully as i could to try and mitigate it , but i knew it would happen . 
  i just wanted to get it off my chest , after having stayed quiet over the last few months building up to this and seeing everyone else all hyped over it . 
  oh god that sounds awful . 
  now , a smoothie or juice on the other hand ... just might work . 
  haha yes actually , and it was awful . 
  no , you 're absolutely right . 
  i just do n't like sweet and sour . 
  specifically * because * it always has pineapple . 
  i feel like i 'm missing the reference here . 
  care to fill me in ? 
  been to a brazilian steak house in vietnam ( where i used to live ) a few times . 
  i ca n't say i remember that exactly . 
  but i think i would like it . 
  it 's mostly just the pineapple with a bit of seasoning added , right ? 
  it 's not actually served mixed in with the meat , like in layers on a kebab ? 
  that 's an interesting way to look at it . 
  it does n't really help me , since that does n't sound very interesting either . 
  when i read that comment , my mind goes to cars or bikes doing stunts , and that i can * kinda * see why people would be interested in it , even if it does n't interest me myself . 
  yeah that sounds tasty . 
  apparently people have very strong opinions about this . 
  i still do n't agree , but have an upvote to counteract the guy that downvoted you . 
  let me know if you figure it out exactly !, 
  that is the worst . 
  you can make money with non-video ads . 
  it 's not a huge amount , but you certainly can make it . 
  and ads are the only reason that so much great quality content can exist . 
  were it not for advertising , so many websites , including your favourite news sites , blogs , web comics , whatever , simply could not exist . 
  similarly , advertising revenue is the only reason anyone can go from making youtube videos occasionally just for fun to being able to full time work on high quality content . 
  blocking ads is a dick move because it 's stealing the monetary source away from people who are * already letting you consume their content ** *** free *** . 
  unless you want sites putting up pay walls and shit , ads are a * good thing * . 
  if you choose not to put ads on your videos , that 's great . 
  but you also are obviously never going to be able to make a career out of it that way . 
  which is totally fine , but it 's not the choice that so many other great content creators have taken . 
  nah man , i 'm totally with you on that . 
  that sounds disturbingly sexual ...
