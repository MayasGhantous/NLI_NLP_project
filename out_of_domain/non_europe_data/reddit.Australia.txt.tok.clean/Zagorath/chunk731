  in addition to the top of all time , there 's a [ hall of fame ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/wiki/hof ) for some selected great stories , some of which did n't get upvoted quiet as much because they were posted when the subreddit was quite a lot smaller than it is now . 
  on a related note , / r/dndgreentext . 
  is this a reference to something that i 'm missing ? 
  if not , are n't they they same thing ? 
  huh ? 
  but is n't that the definition of debugging ? 
  removing bugs ( or , in the metaphor , putting out fires ) . 
  that 's definitely not how anyone i know would use it . 
  it 's the process of finding * and fixing * bugs . 
  the biggest reason , to my knowledge , is that in one case both parties are considered to be able to consent , whereas in the other , they are not . 
  we as a society have decided ( quite rightly , in my opinion ) that children under a certain age ( 16 is a common one , though some places go lower and a few go higher ) are not able to legally consent , and thus sexual attraction to someone that young is deemed a disorder , not necessarily because it * is * in and of itself , but because it could * lead * to dangerous and illegal behaviour . 
  i 've never had any problems with np links from srd breaking https . 
  regarding # 1 , that is ( or at least * should * be ) part of the * point * of the nexus line . 
  but it 's more logical to think of debugging as being `` de ... ing '' meaning `` getting rid of ... '' and `` bug '' . 
  out of interest , would it be highly unusual to have the speaker as a member of the procedure committee ? 
  / u/3fun seems like he would be perfect for the job . 
  i definitely enjoy them , but they 're far from the highlight of the show to me . 
  on rewatches , i 'm usually doing something else at the same time as watching the show , and during fights i normally tune out of the show entirely . 
  same goes for most shows with frequent fights , fwiw , like chuck ( despite it having absolutely incredible choreography some of the time ) . 
  and i 've said nothing about it for months . 
  i 've just gotten sick of seeing all this hype about something that not only do i not care about , but i just do n't even * understand * the fascination with ( like , i understand the attraction to sports like basketball and gridiron , but i personally do n't care for them , having grown up watching different sports , but fake wrestling is just something that i do n't even * understand * the appeal of ) . 
  i spoke up because i wanted to know if i was the only one , since in the months that this hype has been building , i have n't seen anyone else say a word against it . 
  but that 's what * it is * . 
  if not `` fake wrestling '' then what generic term can one use to refer to it ? 
  ( `` generic '' as in not the name of an organisation associated with it . 
  for example , i would say `` basketball '' rather than `` nba '' or `` nbl '' in the same context . ), 
  if calling something by what it is irks them , then perhaps they need to take a closer look at their interests . 
  because i ca n't think of something else that makes sense to call it . 
  as i said , i tried to be as respectful as possible . 
  i 'm really glad for amell , really , i am . 
  i just do n't understand the attraction , and i wanted to know if i 'm the only one ( or , at the least , if someone could explain it to me ) . 
  instead , i got a bunch of rude arses downvoting and calling me disrespectful . 
  and how does one disambiguate that with * actual * wrestling ? 
  still does n't help the fact that so-called `` professional wrestling '' is n't actual wrestling . 
  i 'm not going to call it by a name that is blatantly misrepresenting what it really is . 
  would `` wrestling theatre '' by less disrespectful , in your opinion ? 
  the top posts of all time are a good place to start , but there are also a bunch of good stories that did n't get upvoted as much ( because they were posted when the subreddit was much smaller ) that can be found in [ the hall of fame ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/wiki/hof ) . 
  mine 's below the `` 3 '' . 
  [ looks like the lowest is 36 ] ( http://www.skysports.com/cricket/ashes/stats/lowest-team-score-innings ) . 
  as of this comment , australia needs 3 more runs to be better than the bottom 5 worst scores in an england vs. australia test cricket innings . 
  edit : actually , not sure if those are all ashes . 
  but it 's close enough i 'd say . 
  my prediction : all over by stumps day 2 . 
  my intention was for 3fun to be the crossbencher , and have 2 coalition mps . 
  that is n't access 's fault , it 's bad training from the company . 
  access is by far the better solution for that kind of thing , and a company should be hiring people who know how to use it , or providing training to its employees so that they do . 
  mysql can be installed on any platform . 
  that 's weird . 
  [ dvorak on my mac does n't have that symbol ] ( http://imgur.com/52nn8r0 ) . 
  the only way for me to get that is with option-6 . 
  i do n't know what the `` extra '' key is . 
  i 'm guessing my keyboard does n't have one ? 
  so my windows dvorak layout is exactly the same as my os x one . 
  ( with the slight exception that holding command switches back to qwerty on my mac , to make shortcut keys easier . 
  but i tried the version of dvorak that does n't do that , and it still does n't move the backtick . ), 
  there 's really only one official dvorak layout , and that 's the dvorak simplified keyboard , which is exactly as you see it in my screenshot above ( the shifted versions are the same as the shifted version of the equivalent key on a us qwerty keyboard ) . 
  there are technically supposed to be ways of doing that sort of thing on windows , but i 've never managed to get them to work . 
  and fwiw , dvorak on my mac does n't have the \u00a7 unless i use the option key ( and then it 's option-6 , not option-backtick ) . 
  yeah sorry mate , this is n't the type of content for here . 
  a neat idea , but personally i 'd want to avoid having both the speaker and deputy speaker in the committee , just because even having * one * of them would be a big break from convention . 
  but it is something worth considering , anyway ... 
  dvorak keyboard layout . 
  but it is not this day . 
  to whomever reported this : the report button is not a `` this story is boring '' button . 
  that 's what downvoting is for . 
  please only report material that is either irrelevant ( i.e. , not a story based on a tabletop rpg ) or extremely offensive . 
  hey , it seems the spam filter does n't like your wordpress links . 
  in the future , it might be worth avoiding links to your blog . 
  i 've manually approved you this time . 
  5 is my least favourite by far , with 4 coming next , and then probably 6 . 
  i would find a lot of things very difficult if i did n't know my number of by heart . 
  when registering for things ( especially in person or over the phone , where stopping to look up your number would be awkward at best ) or when being asked to give your phone number as verification it 's helpful to just be able to recite your number . 
  it 's also convenient when you 're just giving someone your phone number so they can contact you , since it 's way faster to just tell them it than to have to look it up first . 
  that said , i literally do not remember * anyone * else 's phone number . 
  as others have said , a coles or woolies should sell them , and there are telstra stores all over the place -- it 's easy to find one in most big shopping centres . 
  that said , i wonder if there 's a particular reason you want a telstra one ? 
  if you are n't going to be going out into the country a lot ( where optus 's coverage is n't as good ) then going with an mvno that resells the optus network is a * much * cheaper option . 
  [ amaysim ] ( https://www.amaysim.com.au/?cid=gsems&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=s2%7cbrand%7ce&amp;utm_term=amaysim&amp;utm_content=swa3q7ila_dc | pcrid | 47671637993 | pkw | amaysim | pmt | e & gclid = cjwkeajwi4yubrdx_vq07yyf7l8sjaahm0rpegfw0c-q7lepz4avnu5o1dsia4v4aofo_htknhsajroci3hw_wcb ) and [ yatango ] ( https://goo.gl/vvxtpn ) are two very good options . 
  hmm , does that mean someone could n't make a piece similar to the 1812 overture ( which uses the current french and a former russian national anthem to represent the armies of those two nations during the war of 1812 ) but celebrating an american victory in some war ( at least under us law , there 'd obviously not be anything stopping a non-american using the anthem in the same way ) ? 
  the percussion & timp ones are particularly good , imo . 
  alien blue is an ios app . 
  rif is an android app . 
  so one generally wo n't be making a choice between the two . 
  i 'm slightly more ambidextrous than `` left handed '' per se , but i pretty much only write with my left hand . 
  i 've tried learning to write with my write hand on and off ( usually either to be able to keep writing in exams after my left hand gets sore , though i 've also tried it because i wanted to do some caligraphy stuff ) , and i 'm actually fairly good at it when i get some practice in . 
  my left hand writing is really quite painful . 
  i have a terrible hook hand and it 's difficult for me to write continuously for more than a few minutes , depending on how fast i 'm writing . 
  my write handed posture is much more close to classically correct . 
  no hook hand , * always * in a three finger grip , etc. 
  just a tip , if you want your post to have bits of greentext in it , prepend the lines with ''  '' , not '' * '' . 
  / r/dndgreentext would also like this . 
  does he wear glasses ? 
  and if not , is the problem with his vision one that could be corrected by glasses ? 
  i do n't know why both of you are being downvoted . 
  the rules in 5e are really great , and in my opinion the language that 's used is spectacular . 
  but the books ** are not ** well organised . 
  it 's been a very common piece of criticism in the subreddit that finding information about something is often very difficult . 
  the books seem like they were written to be a good read , front to back , with little regard to their use as a reference book . 
  i use plain dvorak for normal typing , and switch in to my own custom layout for programming ( which us usually in some language with c-like syntax , anything from c to java , or even php and js ) . 
  i have n't run any metrics on it , though .
