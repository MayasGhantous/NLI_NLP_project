  just went with intuition . 
  well he 's gon na be on an entirely new show now , so we 'll see how that goes ... 
  i would n't be so sure about that . 
  the show has very obvious shakespearean influences , and we all know what that means for the guy who took power through unnatural means . 
  not that the show will * necessarily * end that way , but i would n't be surprised if it does . 
  so , i 'm just taking the first result from a google search for `` more accidents in roundabouts than normal intersections '' -- i have n't done any extensive research into it -- but it would seem you heard wrong . 
  roundabouts seem to be safer . 
  oh shit , it was too . 
  i thought the link was australian :\\, 
  saw the `` wa.gov '' in the link and just assumed it was the western australian government . 
  did n't notice the lack of a '' . au '' . 
  but anyway , my intuition would be that if it 's true in america ( where most drivers are , at least from what i 've seen in this thread , unfamiliar with roundabouts compared to europeans or australians ) , it 's going to be even more true in places where drivers * are * familiar with how to use roundabouts . 
  but anyway , here are some more sources , from various locations :, 
  * [ monash university , australia ] ( http://www.monash.edu.au/miri/research/reports/muarc007.pdf ), 
  * [ something with data from the uk , france , australia , the netherlands , and the us ] ( http://www.nrso.ntua.gr/roadsafety2015/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/50-damaskou.pdf.pdf ) [ [ cached version ( since the normal version was n't working for me ) ] ( http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:72nljcjjllaj:www.nrso.ntua.gr/roadsafety2015/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/50-damaskou.pdf.pdf+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au ) ], 
  * [ data from a number of countries ] ( http://library.ite.org/pub/e1d0d4c8-2354-d714-5194-e24d1ee803c4 ) . 
  this one makes the interesting point that in the uk , the way roundabouts are designed causes them to have a much higher rate of accident than roundabouts in other countries . 
  it does still , however , make the point that roundabouts are safer than cross intersections in numerous ways . 
  yeah my answer was pretty much that . 
  21 year olds have two options . 
  jokes on them !, 
  guns are n't illegal in australia . 
  if you want to get one , it 's actually surprisingly simple . 
  they 're just very well regulated . 
  sure they do . 
  but so do direct downloads and dvds . 
  does n't mean it 's sensible to ban them , and it 's even less sensible to sue the companies that invented those protocols/media , or the companies that produce them . 
  there are a * lot * of good stories in / r/dndgreentext . 
  i would recommend looking at the [ hall of fame ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/wiki/hof ) , which is just filled with heaps of great stories . 
  some of the longer ones , in particular , are absolutely incredible . 
  they 're also very , very long in some cases , though , so it might be worth reading them gradually over a few sessions . 
  i know it took me a fair few to get through `` stranded '' and `` demigods '' , especially . 
  shorter ones like medusa and `` an evil campaign , gone ... good ? '', 
  are worthwhile as well . 
  i 've had similar problems on youtube . 
  posted recordings of myself playing classical pieces ( i.e. , public domain content ) on the piano , get noticed saying that it contains content owned by ... someone -- it usually says `` one or more music publishing rights collecting societies '' . 
  it happens every time . 
  one time was particularly bad . 
  normally , i 'd go through youtube 's automated process saying `` no , this is actually my own stuff '' , and the claim would disappear promptly . 
  this one time , it was a claim from the `` harry fox agency '' . 
  the claim said i had used music from `` sonata for piano no. 14 in c sharp minor '' . 
  thing is , i was playing beethoven 's sonata no. 8 , so they had n't even detected the right piece . 
  and , when i disputed it , they took the full 30 days that youtube allows before releasing their claim . 
  music publishing companies have just been allowed to get away with way too much bullshit for way too long . 
  what you expected certainly seemed to be the prevailing theory around here . 
  it never made sense to me , though . 
  it seemed so obvious that the way they had ended the season was kinda akin to the way the incredibles ended , or pirates of the caribbean 1 . 
  they wanted to give a sense that things keep going on , but it was n't necessary to show exactly * what * happened right afterwards . 
  mate , this is from your history :, 
   i work for one of the smaller australian uni 's and i 'm eyeing off the melbourne uni one as a competitor !, 
  how the fuck can you claim to not know what new south wales is , as someone who supposedly works in australia ? 
   in the hands of a samurai [ a katana is ] the most dangerous weapon on earth besides the atomic bomb, 
  i * suspect * you probably already know this , but the awesomeness of katanas is grossly exaggerated by japanophiles and some people actually believe this kind of thing , so i 'll say it anyway . 
  katanas are a good sword , do n't get me wrong , but they are nothing special , and they were n't these amazing things that just blow western swords away entirely . 
  it 's not just a lack of consequence , though that certainly is a big part of it . 
  another part of it is a fundamental disconnect where people do n't perceive the people as ` real ' in some way . 
  just like paying for things in cash means you tend to spend less than paying by credit card , there 's a fundamental underlying psychological effect at play here that people are not even aware of in many cases . 
  i dunno , i kinda got the impression that op lost their pet and want to know if perhaps someone else has taken it and is not giving it back . 
   oh , do n't complain when you ca n't access certain things on the internet or do certain things in public . 
  you are here in a foreign country with different laws and expectations . 
  do n't start bitching because you ca n't check your facebook . 
  as someone who lived in vietnam for much of my life ( where they are somewhat less totalitarian than china , bit still pretty bad ) fuck this advice . 
  censorship like that is a bad thing , and the governments of these countries should not be allowed to get away with that shit . 
  i 'm going to complain that i ca n't access my facebook , because i fundamentally believe that the chinese government is an absolutely abhorrent bunch of dick bags who should be given zero respect from anyone , anywhere . 
  trying to pass off their level of censorship as ` oh no i ca n't access my facebook woe is me ' is just an incredible level of intellectual dishonesty that i can not really fathom . 
  i loved many things about my time in vietnam . 
  it 's a lovely country with a hell of a lot going for it . 
  you 'll never see me complain about vietnamese culture or the vietnamese people ( except in a few really specific isolated cases , mostly looked at in a humorous light ) . 
  but you wo n't see me defending their government at all , because it ** is terrible ** . 
  and they 're not * half * as bad as china 's . 
  yeah ouch , that last test was * harsh * . 
  i turned it on late on day 1 and saw it was already 5/23 and just thought [ `` what the * hell * happened '' ] ( http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/shocked-troy-walks-into-fire-with-pizza-community.gif ) ? 
  fish 'n' chips ( got ta be * crumbed * , not battered , and preferably chicken salt ) on the beach . 
  bonus points if also on the beach or in a public park . 
  some very simple delicacies that just about any non-vegetarian should be able to appreciate and enjoy . 
  similarly , the many , many lost episodes of doctor who . 
  incredibles 2 . 
  back in the day , the bbc would reuse tapes to save money . 
  a lot of doctor who episodes were post this way . 
  97 out of 253 episodes from the first six years of the show are missing . 
  it would he more , but they got some back from the abc and cbc ( australia and canada 's national broadcasters ) as well as home recordings . 
  they already said in the show , all he 's got ta do is run around it really fast , just like the tornado in episode 1 . 
  wait holy shit !, 
  benedict cumberbatch played paul marshall !? 
  i never noticed !, 
  honestly i think it 's better in the long run if he stays a while longer . 
  if he gets kicked out within a few months of the next federal election that would be much worse for the coalition than if he gets voted out and there are like 8 months with the new leader before we go back to the polls . 
  you said `` federal government '' i was n't sure if you meant any particular government or just `` the survey taker 's government '' , so i assumed the latter . 
  yeah by `` late '' i just meant `` i missed the start '' . 
  yeah , it would have been worth putting an option before going to the page to fill out the matrix of agree/disagree options for each brand to basically say `` yes , i 've heard of this brand '' or `` nope , never heard of this brand at all '' . 
  also , displaying the price in great british pounds but putting commas in the number was * weird * . 
  like , it threw me off for a few seconds thinking that these were * really * expensive shoes . 
  you do know that most british people use a decimal point/full stop as the decimal separator , right ? 
  so , spoilers for the study 's debrief , but that 's actually the point . 
  they selected at least one brand that you 're not * supposed * to have heard of . 
  i do agree that it 's set up really awkwardly in that none of the answers are especially applicable to someone who has n't heard of the company before , but i guess you 're supposed to answer based on intuition from just hearing the name of the company , or how you would generally feel towards any company you do n't already know about . 
  lol are you kidding ? 
  my experience with kids in asia ( mainly from living in vietnam and korea , but i 've noticed the same in at least china and thailand ) is that under a certain age , they 're allowed to run amock * way * more than western kids usually are . 
  it 's only once they get older , usually around ~ 10 , that the serious strictness that asian parents are famous for kicks in . 
  in vietnam it 's kinda funny .
