  literally two extra lines of code and your security increases an insane amount . 
  i 'd be surprised if the same was n't true of other languages . 
  i can not comprehend how any company , especially any that deals with sensitive information , could possibly * not * do this . 
  you know if it 's highlighted then all you need to do is start typing and it 'll delete the highlighted text and replace it with what you typed , right ? 
  what are vrlas ? 
  ah right . 
  cheers . 
  oh god , now i need to rewatch the series . 
  have n't rewatched it since before the last two seasons of korra ... 
  they were pretty clear when they first came out with it . 
  retina means that at normal operating distance , a normal human eye can not resolve individual pixels . 
  now , i do n't know if the original iphone 's screen actually fulfils this , or if the later macbooks and whatever other screens are `` retina '' . 
  i 'm too lazy to run the maths on it . 
  but that 's the argument , and it would pretty pretty simple to prove whether they 've used it accurately or not . 
  yes , without a doubt . 
  honestly i think it 's dumb that they 're even presented as an optional rule , and my group never even considered not allowing them . 
  to me , a far more logical rule would be `` these are standard , but if you want , as a dm you can ban them '' . 
  same with the variant human . 
  i think the biggest difference is that while those other professions are all portrayed grossly incorrectly , they are at least shown on a positive light . 
  classical music , on the other hand , is nearly always portrayed in a negative light on some way . 
  [ here 's the story ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2hpuvq/old_man_henderson_wins_call_of_cthulhu_full_story/ ) , in case anyone has n't read it , or wants to read it again . 
  it really is an incredible one . 
  theoretically , i guess it could be possible . 
  in practice , i 'm doubtful . 
  i 've never heard of it happening here in australia , and paywave/paypass work for up to $ 100 without requiring a pin ( as opposed to just # 20 in the uk ) . 
  the strength that would be required for it to work would be quite substantial , and besides , who has only one rfid card in their wallet ? 
  i 've got two debit cards with paywave/paypass , one transport card ( my state 's equivalent to the uk 's `` oyster cards '' ) , and my student card . 
  not to mention my phone , which has nfc in it . 
  the signal if someone were to scan straight from my pocket would be way too noisy to be of value , i imagine . 
  and even if they * do * manage to swipe your details , it 's not like you really lose anything . 
  the bank or card providers are the ones liable in all cases , never the consumer . 
  18 months ? 
  i 've regularly used them for at least the last 30 months ( 2 and a half years ) , and that 's only since i moved back here . 
  as far as i 'm aware , they were pretty widespread even before then . 
  ( this is in brissy , i ca n't comment on other cities , though i 'd be surprised if at least inner sydney and melbourne were n't just as good if not better . ), 
  [ that 's probably for the best . 
  who knows how felicity would react if she knew . 
  if you have n't seen it already , `` sliding doors '' , which was mentioned in this short , is a really fantastic film . 
  i 'd highly recommend it . 
  run , lola , run !, 
  is another film that i 've heard is very good , which takes a similar premise . 
  though i have n't seen that one yet myself . 
  the thing they had for 4e where you could search for particular features was really good . 
  does `` milk '' include its use in other drinks ? 
  in other words , if you chose tea , you could n't have tea with milk ? 
  what about drinks like milo and nesquick ? 
  either way , water , juice , soft drinks are 1 2 and 3 for me . 
   if you go `` soft drinks , '' does kool-aid count ? 
  soda water ? 
  sprite ? 
  perrier ? 
  i do n't know about kool-aid or perrier ( i do n't know what they are ) , but drinks like sprite , fanta , and coke are basically the * definition * of `` soft drink '' . 
  it 's the more general term that refers to what some people call `` soda '' or `` pop '' ( in a similar way to how `` tropical cyclone '' is a generic term for what some people call hurricanes , typhoons , or cyclones ) . 
  yeah that 's basically it to my knowledge . 
  soft drink is a term for carbonated non-alcoholic drinks . 
  hey , how are the final results decided here ? 
  is each rank worth a certain amount of points ( with 1 being worth the most ) ? 
  if so , i 'd be interested in seeing how this would work out if you put it through the av voting system , or perhaps stv ( with , say , 3 or 4 winners ) . 
  do you have the raw data available ? 
  meta : not sure if we 're supposed to second nominations , but if so :, 
  i second the nomination of phyllicanderer for deputy chair . 
  present, 
  yeah i 'll just echo what the others said . 
  watch the whole thing . 
  it basically wraps up all the major plot threads from the first two seasons , but then introduces some new ones that would have provided a new conflict if there had been a season 3 . 
  works for a good satisfying ending , while giving a sort of `` life goes on '' kind of vibe . 
  like the ending of the incredibles with the underminer 's appearance . 
  if you like it , you can find heaps more great ones at [ the / r/dndgreentext hall of fame ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/wiki/hof ) . 
   i mean seriously , it 's pretty much the same as dragons from d&d . 
  where are you getting that from ? 
  d&d dragons , at least in canon , are far from generic . 
  they 're extremely intelligent beings capable of conversation . 
  each type of dragon ( i.e. , each different colour for chromatics , or metal for the metallics ) has something that makes them really unique , not to mention the large differences between the broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons . 
  and beyond that , individual dragons have their own unique personalities and aims . 
  i mean , the way a tabletop rpg works , of course it 's up to individual dms . 
  i know my first dm played dragons incredibly genericly . 
  but any dm who 's done his research will be able to put a good degree of uniqueness behind any dragon you encounter . 
  could be that it does n't act retroactively . 
  try clearing all cookies to begin with manually , and * then * turning on the setting / u/rentamob suggested . 
  if that does n't work , as / u/mrpap says , incognito mode exists for a reason , and it 's the best and easiest method to use . 
  edit : actually , make sure that when you close it , it 's * actually * closed . 
  if you 're in windows , check that chrome has n't left itself in your taskbar , which it sometimes is wont to do . 
  i 'd disagree * strongly * regarding the portrayal of cops , which is what was mainly on my mind when i made that previous comment . 
  professors , too . 
  i ca n't ever remember seeing a professor or teacher portrayed negatively , except when it 's obviously cartoonish . 
  but the rest of those are good points , so in general i 'd have to concede that i was a little hasty in my generalisation in the previous comment . 
   disappointing thing about the barrel scene was the shot that just looked like someone stuck a gopro underwater, 
  i have n't actually looked this up , but i 'm pretty sure that 's because that 's * exactly what they did * . 
  i do n't think it was cg , i think it was really fucking shitty cinematography that they thought they could get away with because of the speed of the action or whatever . 
  but i 'd be really glad to know if i 'm wrong . 
  this is dumb . 
  if they 're avoiding paying taxes , it 's because it 's entirely legal for them to do so . 
  they are doing what is clearly in the best interests of them and their shareholders . 
  it would be * irresponsible * not to . 
  do n't bloody `` name and shame '' them for it . 
  if you want them to pay more tax , then just fucking make them pay more tax . 
  change the laws to * close * the loopholes that allow them to avoid it . 
   god save the president just does n't have the same ring . 
  we should just call our president the queen . 
  on the other hand , `` god bless the united states of america '' has a much nicer ring to it than `` god bless the united kingdom '' , at least to me .
