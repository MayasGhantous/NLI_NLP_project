  there 's a very specific formula that can be used to work it out . 
  the only potentially vague bit of it is `` normal operating distance '' , but at the iphone 4 announcement they gave an exact value to that , at least from my memory . 
  the formula , if you 're interested , is theta = 1.22 lambda / b, 
  where theta is the angle ( in radians ) from one pixel to your eyes to an adjacent pixel . 
  lambda is the wavelength ( in metres ) of light from the display , and b is the diameter of the lens ' aperture ( the lens in this case being your eyes . 
  a simplified model would be to take the diameter of your pupil , though a more complicated method would take into account the fact that you have two eyes . ) . 
  the angle given by this is the absolute minimum angle where you can just barely resolve individual pixels . 
   i know , he 'll shoot with disadvantage and you get a bonus to your ac, 
  if he 's fully behind a table -- i.e. , not poking his head over the top to see what 's going on -- this should be ** total cover ** . 
  page 196 of phb :, 
   a target with ** total cover ** ca n't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell , although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect . 
  a target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle . 
  good point . 
  i was imagining a more standard kind of dining room table that could fit like 6 people around it . 
  but a little 4 person square table would be harder to hide behind . 
  in that case , i think op was a little * too * generous . 
  a +5 bonus to ac and no disadvantage would be raw for three-quarters cover . 
   but they could have quoted a ( numerical ) pixel density and avoided all this crap !, 
  but they did ... 
  i do n't remember exactly what it was , but i think it was around 305 dpi . 
  and the only weakness of the formula is that the effective `` diameter '' of the aperture changes . 
  the angle is basically measuring the distance between pixels . 
  if they 're close enough together ( i.e. , the angle is small enough ) the eye becomes unable to resolve them . 
  the difficulty is that modelling the human eyes as a single circular aperture is at best , difficult , and at worst , naive . 
  but either way , it 's good enough for a basic rule of thumb to be used for marketing purposes . 
  my main point at the beginning of all this was simply that apple gave a clear definition , because the person i replied to claimed that they `` would n't tell us what it meant '' , which was just a lie .

  i do n't know what is generally accepted , but i would feel completely comfortable using ` str ` as a variable name in a function designed to take an arbitrary string and do something with it . 
  `` arbitrary '' being the key word . 
  edit : actually , just remembered , ` str ` in python is the official name given to string variables , right ? 
  on second thought , i 'd probably use the variable name ` string ` or something else that does n't have an existing meaning . 
  my problem is that he 's basically decided right at the start of the campaign -- without giving the players any real way of getting out of it -- that he 's gon na steal their starting equipment . 
  if the players do something to antagonise someone , or otherwise bring it upon themselves , then fine . 
  but just deciding that you 're gon na steal stuff from them in the first session of a new campaign is shit . 
  find some other way to start your adventure . 
  wow these are absolutely incredible . 
  i spotted `` tyrell '' and `` snape '' in some of the name generators . 
  those added in deliberately , or did you just bulk grab a bunch of names from somewhere ? 
  ( and if the former , what other sources apart from potter and asoiaf did you grab from ? ), 
  have to say , personally , i 'm not a fan of `` the < noun  '' for a tavern name . 
  to me , it needs to be `` the < adjective | | attributive verb  < noun  '' or `` the < noun  & < noun  '' . 
  though `` the cupboard '' is so hilariously lame i can see myself making an exception . 
  looking at the picture , nothing substantial has changed . 
  it appears to be a standard boehm clarinet , so unless you happen to be in germany or austria , it would be able to function just fine -- though it 'll probably need a little repair . 
  but i would echo the other users ' suggestion that you might not want to use it . 
  its value as an heirloom is likely far greater than its performance as an instrument . 
  it 'd be better to buy a cheap ( but not * too * cheap ) new clarinet , at least at first . 
  there are clarinets in bb and ones in a ( and also in eb , but from the photo , it 's clear this is not one of those ) . 
  from the picture , i ca n't tell which it is ( the difference between them , visually , is very minute ) . 
  for most playing , you 'll need to be sure it 's a bb clarinet . 
  it probably is , but to be safe , the way to test would be to blow through it with no keys pressed down ( this is the clarinet 's written g ) , and play an f on a piano ( or pretty much any other common instrument you can find ) . 
  they should sound the same pitch . 
  if they are n't , then try playing an e on the piano . 
  if they sound the same now , you 've got an a clarinet on your hands . 
  if that 's the case , any advice on whether to buy a new one or not is moot . 
  your son wo n't be able to play in marching band with an a clarinet ( at least , not until he gets * very * good ) . 
  if neither of them sound the same , you 've got a problem with your hearing :p, 
  if it was played in a marching band , i 'm doubtful . 
  i 'm not especially familiar with marching music ( more of a classical or jazz guy , myself ) , but most band stuff tends to favour the bb clarinet , which would make me believe that if it was played in one of sousa 's bands , it 's probably a bb clarinet . 
  just a quick bit of research , most of sousa 's most well known works ( i checked liberty bell , stars and stripes forever , and washington post ) all seem to use bb clarinets . 
  not really . 
  historically , the clarinet used would be the one to best fit the key . 
  pieces with `` sharp '' keys tended to use a clarinets , and with `` flat '' keys would use bb ones . 
  ( also , historically , keys close to neutral , like f , c , and g , would use a c clarinet . 
  though c clarinets have pretty much entirely fallen out of use these days . ), 
  so both would have been more or less equally common . 
  ( many works would require switching between the two/three , even , for example beethoven 's symphony no. 5 has the first 3 movements on a bb clarinet , and then switches to a c clarinet in the last movement . ), 
  band music has a tendency to be written in flat keys , because these tend to be the easiest to use on the instruments . 
  especially as time went on , the bb trumpet and f horn became the predominant keys for their instruments , and you 've got saxes that are nearly always in bb or eb . 
  all of these instruments are easier to play in flat keys . 
  so a bb clarinet is more likely to be used in a marching or concert band than an a one . 
  i loved butterfly effect . 
  i loved mr nobody , too . 
  but i thought butterfly effect was done really well . 
  out of interest , which ending did you see ? 
  honestly if it was n't for your comment , i would n't have even realised / u/some _ evil was trying to be funny ( or , to be more accurate , i would n't have realised what it was about their comment that they thought was funny ) . 
  it never even occurred to me that they may have been mispronouncing wei ... 
  nope . 
  9x as bad . 
  emotions scale with the square of time . 
  my year one teacher did n't know the word `` visible '' . 
  we read a book that had a character go invisible , and at the end , it becomes visible again . 
  but the book says something along the lines of `` he was not invisible anymore '' or whatever -- without using the word `` visible '' . 
  so i made the comment that `` he became visible '' , and she was like `` no , he used to be invisible , and now he 's not '' . 
  she was conflating '' ** in ** visible '' with `` visible '' . 
  goddammit mrs. 
  fun fact , in korean , '' \ub124 '' ( pronounced , `` nae '' , or `` nay '' ) means yes . 
  this would be especially interesting tied in with the dark sun campaign setting , i feel . 
  what exactly are these dates of ? 
   you say `` it 's in spanish though '' as if it 's a drawback . 
  i do n't think that 's what they intended . 
  i think it 's a misplaced comma . 
  a lot of people seem to write like that , it 's a pretty common mistake , though i do n't really understand why , since it completely goes against how people normally * say * the phrase . 
  `` it 's in spanish , though i think there are subtitles '' is what i think they meant to say . 
  well , before now there were already apps that would just stop them swiping to another image . 
  that seems like it probably would 've worked . 
  not the app 's fault , i do n't think . 
  there 's a known issue with the nexus 4 that using the ~ ~ battery ~ ~ camera often causes crashes . 
  i know i basically avoid camera using apps most of the time because i 'm sick of my phone needing to restart . 
  edit : using the camera causes problems , not the battery .
