  that would be a much more significant problem if so ... 
  yeah , it actually won the academy award for best original score the year it came out . 
  honestly i 'm personally not a fan , i thought it sounded pretty generic , but then , as a general rule i tend to prefer leitmotif based scores , and ones that are orchestral or jazzy , rather than electronic . 
  it 's a variant sorcerer that was released as part of the beta material in an unearthed arcana article . 
  you can find it [ here ] ( https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/modifying-classes ) . 
  thematically , it 's a sorcerer that gets its powers in some way from a god . 
  it gets the spells from one clerical domain in addition to its normal spells . 
  be warned , though , if you allow this , it 's unplaytested and may not be entirely balanced . 
  this warning comes with any unearthed arcana . 
  if all that 's happening is the app 's crashing , then their error handling is far * better * than that of skype , snapchat , and the camera app ( which are the ones i 've had the problem with in the past ) . 
  with those ones , it causes the whole phone to instantly restart . 
  but i 'm not sure it 's their error handling that 's at fault . 
  i think that it 's a case of the camera 's firmware creating some sort of an unrecoverable error . 
  not sure exactly what , perhaps it tries writing to a page it does n't have permission to or something . 
  there 's one called [ focus ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franco.focus ) . 
  you can see a quick review of it [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/xw9nrrr8cne?t=4532 ) ( it seems to have quite a lot of functionality even outside of the swipe locking ) . 
  ca n't comment from experience , i basically never use my phone for photography/photos , so i have n't installed anything outside the stock gallery app . 
  i was on holiday in germany one time , and one time i bought a water . 
  upon drinking it in the parking lot right outside the store , i did a literal spit-take when i realised it was n't real water , it was that carbonated shit . 
  wow , our closest vote yet !, 
  hey , has anyone compiled a list of a bunch of different character sheets that have been submitted here ? 
  i 'd kinda like to take a look through them and compare them side-by-side . 
  i would just like to voice my support for this idea . 
  i would much rather see a brief ( ~ 12 months ) fixed price period , moving then into a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme . 
  but if it were put to a vote in parliament , i would be supporting just about anything that gets put . 
  fwiw , it 's actually battery . 
  assault is technically the * threat * , while battery is what it is when it 's actually carried out . 
  hence `` assault and battery '' . 
  so , for clarification , what we 're voting on here is the original motion with / u/ser _ scribbles ' amendment ? 
  this is ** not ** including clause ( 4 ) as proposed by / u/phyllicanderer further down this thread ? 
  ^ ^ meta : ^ ^ pssst ^ ^ it ^ ^ says ^ ^ the ^ ^ 21th, 
  it 's likely an effect of rolling shutter on normal lightning . 
  basically , the camera does n't take the whole image at once , it quickly scrolls across the screen ( usually top to bottom in a landscape shot , either left to right or right to left in portrait , depending on which way the camera is tilted ) . 
  if the lightning strikes part way through that process , the lines being scanned while the lighting is around will be brighter , since the whole area is brighter for that time . 
  fan fact , people would actually * always * expect the spanish inquisition , since they would give people 30 days notice . 
  not that it changes how amazingly punny this comic is . 
  not really . 
  you could go multiple days without taking a long rest . 
  the feature would be able to be reused if it 's `` once per day '' , but if it needs a long rest to be reused , then in that scenario it could n't be . 
  oh yeah i definitely agree that the rules as intended are absolutely clear . 
  but since they 've only specifically clarified those two cases , a strict rules as written interpretation ( not that i would actually advocate for that , but someone could potentially make the mistake ) could do things the way my above comment described it . 
  defining it as exclusively physical labour is insanely myopic , but i do n't get the impression that 's what op is saying . 
  my impression of the op is that they would consider considerable mental effort , like that done by a theoretical physicist , or figuring out a solution to a coding problem , would also count . 
  who 's uri geller and what 's the lawsuit over ? 
  unfortunately op 's title is n't the same as the title of the actual article , so no . 
  you there 's no real plot to it . 
  you could just watch the last like 90 seconds for the best bits . 
  maybe even 60 seconds . 
   calling someone racist is accusing them of breaking australian law ( since racism is illegal ) . 
  what ? 
  where does it say this in the law ? 
  i ca n't imagine it being true . 
  there 's a difference between `` hate speech '' and racism . 
  if i were to say `` i hate indians '' that would be racist , but it 's not hate speech , and as far as i 'm aware , not illegal . 
  saying `` we should all go bash some indians '' would be closer to hate speech , though i 'm not sure of the technical boundaries in the law . 
  yeah . 
  saying things like `` you 're asian , so you must be good at maths '' is racist . 
  it 's just less bad than saying `` you 're asian , so you must be a bad driver '' or something with a negative trait . 
  2 hours `` do this '', 
  missed the bit about needing to be 24 . 
  anyway , i 'm curious about the results of this . 
  will you be sharing them with us , op ? 
  2 hours `` do this '', 
  i agree with stage . 
  there 's no cool way to be good at mtg. 
  in my mind , being / r/top is cool , being in cc is not . 
  ( he says , knowing he 's only a few months away from being in cc ... ), 
  present, 
   as one or two might not yet be monitoring this subreddit, 
  more like `` as one or two * might * be monitoring this subreddit '' . 
   top-level comments from committee members should be motions , such as to move a resolution of the committee , to call certain witnesses , or to invite public submissions , deny leave , etc. 
  replies would include the debate and the moving of amendments . 
  so this means if we want to give general feedback/thoughts on the proposed amendment as it stands now , we ca n't ? 
  #this contains spoilers, 
  ## do n't read this unless you have first done the survey, 
   when logging into gmail to check some emails , you see that the following email has been received . 
  uhh , that depends . 
  was i in london on 30th june ? 
  i would know that , and if i was , then it 's most likely not an attack . 
  if i was in a different country entirely , then it probably is . 
  i went with `` not '' for this question . 
  similar problems with the paypal payment confirmation and the account creation , but i went with not for those , too . 
  the facebook redirect one was clever . 
  the skype one , it depends on how i know chris . 
  is he a friend or colleague whom i have asked to send my usb drivers ? 
  if so , then not an attack . 
  otherwise , i would of course be wary . 
  i went with `` attack '' , because there was no evidence that i had asked for them or was expecting them . 
  also , since the pictures were necessary for being able to answer the questions , it would be helpful if we could see the pictures on the feedback page , too . 
  there were so many where the text was `` when logging into gmail to check some emails , you see that the following email has been received . '', 
  that i ca n't remember which was which . 
  and it 'd also be nice to be able to check again to see why i got it wrong . 
  yeah it 's called a stanley knife in aus , too . 
  nah , if reddit 's search was at least moderately good , it 'd win on speed , since the convenience of just typing into a search box is way faster than going to google separately . 
  but you 're right that they 'll never beat google 's accuracy and flexibility . 
  or even site : reddit.com/r/[pick a subreddit ] if you know which subreddit you want to search . 
  the scientific consensus is clear . 
  climate change is real , and it is having an effect on the world today . 
  it will only get worse over time , especially if we do nothing to stop it . 
  while it is true that on a global scale , energy production by australia is a relatively minor portion of emissions , i believe we should be leading from the front .
