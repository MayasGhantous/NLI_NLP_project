  is this dude really big ? 
  i do n't think i 've ever heard of `` marques brownlee '' before , and it 's a fairly unique name , i 'd like to think i 'd remember it . 
  not heard of mkbhd , either . 
  but if he 's making claims like this ... well , i 'm really quite confused about how he 's apparently become a big name . 
  edit : ~ ~ what 's with the downvotes , but no one bothering to explain ? 
  it 's a genuine question . 
  is this guy big in tech or not ? 
  because i 've never heard of him . 
  what sphere is he big in ? ~ ~ yay , thanks for explanations . 
  yeah , his twit network is going strong . 
  imo it 's the best audio news source for tech stuff ( including all about android , which he is n't on himself , but it 's part of the network ) . 
  he did [ an ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/34vfcp/iama_twit_hi_its_leo_laporte_ama_about_twit_and/ ) earlier this year if you 're interested . 
   consumers : `` we demand ultra-thin , sexy devices ! '', 
  do people really ? 
  i get the impression that very few people actually care about their phones being super thin . 
  in fact , many people speak very loudly about their desire for the race to a paper phone to halt , and concentrate on other features . 
  i see a * lot * of complaints about battery life , however . 
  oh cool , thanks for the explanation . 
  he actually seems like a pretty damn good reviewer . 
  it 's a shame my first impression of him was him making an utterly stupid comment like that , because i 'd probably have subscribed , otherwise . 
  i 'll definitely be following to see if he goes back and admits his error there . 
  hear , hear . 
  i 'm trying to figure out if this is poe 's law in action or not ... 
  why do you keep putting the percentage sign before the number ? 
  it 's not money . 
  quite common among left handers . 
  are you a lefty ? 
  you left handed ? 
  it 's actually fairly common , at least in early development , for left handers to write this way . 
  except when the port is sideways . 
  but yeah , on horizontally-aligned ports , it 's really easy to get it in the right way on the first time . 
  just take a brief look at the actual plug . 
  huh ? 
  where 'd you get that from . 
  if we say `` general = public + private '' , and we have the general-public licence , then we can expand that to ( public + private ) - public licence , which simplifies to private licence . 
  exactly as the person you replied to described . 
  as far as i 'm aware , the reviews of abc bias use very simple ( arguably too simple to be of much meaning ) objective measures , taking into account which side of politics agrees or disagrees with a particular position , how many times it is reported on , and how much time is spent reporting on it . 
  things like that , which can be very easily measured . 
  the problem is that there * are no alternatives * . 
  if you want a high-end smartphone , the * only * options out there today are from companies trying to forever make their phones thinner . 
  i would just speak in defence of ( some aspects of ) the political compass . 
  i think it is an absolutely fantastic tool for generally discussing where different political views lie . 
  it 's obviously not perfect , but it 's orders of magnitude better than just `` left '' and `` right '' , and it does provide a surprisingly good amount of insight into where someone lies on the scale . 
  if you were to say `` i 'm a moderate right , far libertarian '' , i would instantly know what that means . 
  it 's also got a really good test for displaying where you , personally , lie on the scale . 
  of course , this does n't provide much more than what a little bit of introspection could , but it 's cool anyway . 
  where it really falls down is in where it places real world political parties . 
  i do n't think it does a good job of this at all . 
  labor as mid-right mid-authoritarian ? 
  come on . 
  you 're joking . 
  really , they should probably be pretty much perfectly centrist on both axes , maybe slightly on the authoritarian side . 
  i ca n't really know * why * its so bad at placing real world political parties , but to hazard a guess , i think part of it is that they place them down at some position , at some point in time , and that point is more or less good . 
  but then they want to show how the party has changed over time . 
  i think it 's this change where they go wrong , and exaggerate movements , perhaps in response to whatever specific issues are in their minds at the time . 
  again , not sure if that 's really it , but it 's my hypothesis . 
  ** tl ; dr ** the political compass is a great framework , just do n't trust where they put real-world political parties . 
  yeah , must be safari . 
  i knew it was either safari or firefox that did it , but could n't remember which . 
  it 's a damn pain , in my opinion , but i guess having variety among the browsers means anyone can get what they want out of it . 
  no , you are the one being the arse . 
  leo 's been in public life for decades , and for the last decade or so the degree to which that is true has skyrocketed , with streaming the behind the scenes of his shows . 
  as / u/snyderxc says , he 's bound to slip up sometimes , and when things get taken out of context it 's easy to make him look bad . 
  somewhere along the way , he 's somehow gained a small but ** very ** vocal following of trolls , like the guy that produced that video , who take every opportunity to harass him . 
  he 's a good , genuine guy , who just obviously does n't have the greatest impulse control . 
  all the twit content is actually released in creative commons , including the behind the scenes stuff , which is actually part of what allows these trolls to do what they do . 
  but he keeps it cc anyway , because he realises that the majority of people are going to use that for good , and not to be dicks . 
  i ca n't say i 've experienced this `` comes across as one ... on his podcasts '' . 
  in fact , i think the exact opposite is true . 
  i remember the last time he had adam curry on , he was clearly restraining himself way more than i could have . 
  the dude fucking denies the moon landing on the episode * right after buzz aldren 's death * , i 'd have just ragequit and booted him off the call ( or told him to leave the studio , dunno if he was on skype or in person ) if i was the host of someone that phenominally stupid , but not before cussing him out . 
  but leo was * extremely * restrained towards him on air . 
  the exact opposite of an arsehole , imo . 
  to be entirely honest . 
  nothing . 
  it was * very * different from previous versions , and that left oldschool fans unhappy . 
  but it made a number of very good improvements . 
  unfortunately , the oldschool fans basically never gave it a real chance , and it got this perception of being terrible . 
  among the biggest criticisms is that it 's too `` combat focussed '' . 
  the reason is basically that they put a hell of a lot of cool things that you can do in combat , so that your option , if you 're a fighter , is n't just `` i hit it with my sword '' . 
  you could do things like move opponents around the battlefield , etc. 
  it did , however , require a combat grid , which previous editions did not . 
  there 's a comparative lack of rules for roleplaying stuff , which made people think that trying to * do * roleplaying stuff was impossible . 
  in reality , the opposite is true . 
  it meant that you could do what you wanted without needing to look up countless nitpicky rules . 
  instead , you could just roll with it . 
  made that sort of thing much easier to do . 
  this is an aspect that 's carried forward into 5e . 
  there are a few other common criticisms of the edition , but once you ignore the whiny `` but it 's different to what i used to play '' , most of them are pretty dumb . 
  it * did * however , take a * very * long time to run combat encounters , especially at mid levels and above . 
  that 's one * very * valid criticism . 
  it 's actually got a surprising amount of 4th edition 's ethos under the hood , it 's just less obvious . 
  the biggest thing is balance . 
  4e was the only edition that was even remotely balanced in a reasonable way . 
  3 . x and pathfinder may have started out that way , but they were an utter broken mess by the time they 'd been out for a year or two . 
  previous editions did n't really even try . 
  5e is even better balanced than 4e was . 
  then there 's freedom . 
  3.5 and previous had stupid restrictions on things like `` paladins must be lawful good '' and stuff like that . 
  it 's dumb , it 's restricting , it 's not fun .
