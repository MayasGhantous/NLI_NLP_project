  it similarly has good videos available . 
  ( stv , obviously , could only be used for congressional elections in the us , not presidential ones , since when there 's only one winner , it devolves to av . ), 
  of course , the other counter argument is that the voter does n't * need * to know exactly how the vote counting process works . 
  all they need to know is that it * does * . 
  it works as a black box . 
  so long as it 's possible for them to find out how it works if they 're interested , that should be enough . 
  but it * is * proportional . 
  that 's the * point * of it . 
  [ here , watch this .

  hahaha , too true . 
  the technical way it 's structured means that yes , this is true on a theoretical level . 
  however , in practice the way populations tend to be distributed , it maintains proportionality over larger scales , too . 
  it is n't * as * proportional as something like mmp , it 's true . 
  but it also does n't have party lists , which to me is a * huge * advantage . 
  with 128 gb of space . 
  the difference is 8 times , not 8 * 1024 times !, 
  many companies do market 3840 as 4k , though , since it 's 4x1080p,

  i mentioned all about android because of the subreddit we 're in , that 's all .

   rouge is `` red '' in french, 
  it 's also a type of makeup ( which i 'm guessing is named for its colour ? 
  haha that is absolutely brilliant . 
  you should x-post this to / r/dndgreentext . 
  they 'd love it over there !, 
  maybe gametales as well . 
  could be half chinese by race . 
  or perhaps they 're chinese by ancestry , but grew up in a western country and culturally identify as completely being from that country . 
  unless you means tables for displaying tabular data , in which case , carry on . 
  i know they say analysing humour makes it not funny any more , but your comment made me laugh about as hard as most of the top level comments in here . 
  i skimmed this whole comment waiting for the twist . 
  was surprised not to find any . 
  no need for the `` most likely '' . 
  it says on the plane itself , `` antonov 225 '' . 
  i do n't actually have any other sources . 
  i listen to so many podcasts already that i try to avoid ones that double up on the same topic . 
  the only thing i got was ** age of empires 2 ** . 
  i 've had age of mythology since christmas , and a group of friends and i have been playing that a lot . 
  but we decided we wanted a bit more variety , so age of empires 2 it is . 
  to be honest , i really do not enjoy the game as much as i did when i was a kid . 
  unless you 're really heavy on the nostalgia , i would not recommend it . 
  it 's a pretty awful game mechanically , at least compared to age of mythology -- which does still hold up . 
  extra buttons are really useful outside of games , too . 
  i 've got 5 extras on mine ( plus one for switching profiles ) , and on the non-gaming profile i have it set to move to the next and previous tab , press back and forward , and close tab . 
  oh , well if you do n't mind spoilers , then the answer is yes . 
  i love how that 's not actually implemented using the < blink  tag . 
  i assume it 's because browsers no longer display < blink  , but it 's still amusing . 
  has there been a follow up to that ? 
  ever used wi-fi ? 
  i actually agree with your player . 
  i 'll respond to each of u/hungryghoast 's points :, 
   * it would essentially cripple one of the key rogue abilities ( cunning action ), 
  it * does n't * cripple cunning action , because it 's only moving 5 ft. cunning action allows them to move their full movement , which is clearly * much * more desirable . 
   * attacks of opportunity are reactions so each creature only gets one per round anyway and it prevents them from taking other reactions if they do . 
   * aoo 's occur only when leaving the attack range of a creature , this leaves a lot of options of movement that still do n't potentially activate an aoo, 
  i do n't see how this is a reason against . 
  it 's just a description of what aoos are . 
  it does n't make any good case for or against a `` shift '' movement . 
  additionally , for that second one , it still does n't allow for ranged attacks and spells to be made without disadvantage , so there 's a very clear reason to want to be able to shift . 
   * there are bonus action abilities and spells which can be taken in conjunction with the disengage action . 
  instead of costing movement getting out from range without being attacked costs an action , but his does n't prevent many bonus action abilities/spells from being taken . 
  again , this is literally just a description of things that a player can do . 
  it still does n't actually speak against allowing shifting . 
  yes , there are things you can do if you use disengage , but there are way more things you can do if you shift . 
   * remind the player that disengage means they do not incur aoo 's for the rest of their turn so they can move freely . 
  this is why it costs an action and not your move . 
  this is certainly a good thing about having disengage as an option . 
  but it says nothing about also including shift as an option . 
  having * both * means you can either do nothing and get the whole way away from the fight , or only get a temporary minor reprieve , but still get to fire off an arrow safely . 
   * if the character is an arcane caster and they want to be able to attack with a ranged cantrip but ca n't without disadvantage : that 's what spells ( and abilities ) like misty step are for . 
  there are also a bevy of spells and abilities where you can risk the aoo by forcing disadvantage on the attack . 
  the light domain cleric 's warding flare for example ( which costs you a reaction so you can go ahead and cast a action cost spell after that ), 
  more irrelevant description . 
  yes , you have a lot of options , but that 's no reason not to add one more . 
  to respond to you directly , op , having a shift option just makes sense . 
  to me , if someone carefully takes one step backward in combat , there 's no more reason that should grant an opportunity attack than if they were to circle all the way around the opponent twice . 
  ignoring any mechanical balance stuff , shifting as an option * logically and narratively makes sense * . 
  mechanically , it 's a tradeoff . 
  you get to make one attack safely , but opponents can still very easily attack you on the next turn , and since you did n't move a long way back , there 's even a good chance you could get flanked on your next turn . 
  personally , i never even considered * not * allowing it , because i do n't see any good reasons not to , and so many reasons to include it . 
  i would remind you that downvotes are not for disagreement . 
  if you can honestly say that my comment was irrelevant or out of place , and that it does not belong here , then by all means , downvote . 
  but otherwise , all you 're doing is being a fucking arsehole trying to silence others from sharing their opinions . 
  you should all be ashamed of yourselves . 
  ditto goes for downvoting / u/thetreavor . 
  seriously , what is wrong with you people ? 
  [ here 's another good survey ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dnd/comments/37js39/i_frequently_run_games_for_players_with_no/ ) to ask players . 
   the chances of 10 in a row do n't go up just because you 've already done 9, 
  yes , they do !, 
  the rough notation for this in statistics would be p ( getting 10 heads in a row | 9 heads in a row ) . 
  if you 've already gotten 9 heads , then the chance of you getting 10 heads in a row is now 50-50 . 
  that 's really , * really * basic statistics . 
  the reason this feels wrong is because the chance of you already * haven gotten * to where you * are * were very low ( 1/2 ) ^ ( 9 ) , to be precise . 
  but from where you are , the chances of getting further are quite high . 
  i would have thought the opposite would be more true . 
  they know that a certain hand wins , let 's say 50 % of the time . 
  they lost the last 2 times they had this hand , so the next time they have it , they raise their bet , thinking `` i 'm sure to win this time , i lost the last 2 , and there 's a 50 % chance of winning , so i 'm more likely to win now '' . 
  that said , i do n't gamble or hang around gamblers . 
  so i do find it interesting to learn that it tends to happen the opposite of what i would have thought .
