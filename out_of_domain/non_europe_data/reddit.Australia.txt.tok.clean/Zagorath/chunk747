  the guys from the fear the boot podcast refer to this as a `` group template '' , and it definitely sounds like a good idea . 
  there are a number of good resources on their website ( just google `` fear the boot group template '' ) . 
  here are a couple :, 
  * [ questionnaire for designing group template ] ( http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/wp-content/uploads/resources/2_grouptemplatequestionnaire.pdf ),

  you 're entitled to your opinion , but respectfully , i disagree . 
  the pathfinding is awful , creating build orders with mixed units and upgrades is n't possible , and you ca n't even bloody rotate the map to see ( and more importantly , accurately * click on * ) what 's behind the trees . 
  additionally , though perhaps some people might like it this way ( considering it `` hard core '' -- to me , it 's just bad design ) units get kited way too easily . 
  so often i 'll find half my army scattered across the map because i was focussed on something else for 30 seconds and the enemy sent a scout through my base . 
  plus , the original ai is way too easy , but the new ai is insanely broken , especially on water maps . 
  you can normally move ~ 30 ft. 
  if you only move 5 in the same time , to me , it 's clear that that movement is probably quite careful . 
  or at least , has the option of being careful . 
  a better analogy with the boxer would be that you can either move a long way away from the boxer while keeping your guard up the whole time , wary of anyone else that might also be around , or you can move a short distance away keeping your guard up , and then once you 've stepped away , you draw your bow and fire it . 
  ah yeah , that makes sense . 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  the difference , at least as i see it , is that with disengage , you 're essentially turning and running . 
  the actual `` action '' part of disengage is doing something to distract your opponent , or put him off his guard long enough to get away safely . 
  and you repeat that with any other enemies in melee range during your turn . 
  a shift , on the other hand , is you taking one step back . 
  at no point do you put your guard down ( until you 're already safely out of range ) , because you do n't need to . 
  you 're only moving one step back . 
  you ca n't go very far because you 're walking backwards and keeping weapons up , but you do n't provoke opportunity attacks for the same reason . 
   `` carefully '' to me means it should cost some kind of action, 
  i do n't see why . 
  in my mind , at least , `` disengage '' is an action because it involves distracting or offputting your opponent ( s ) enough to be able to turn and run safely . 
  that `` turn and run '' part is why you can use your * full * movement . 
  with a shift , you 're just taking one step backwards . 
  it does n't make sense to me that a single step back should ever provoke opportunity attacks . 
   unless you use disengage to move behind other characters in a restricted space , or the opponents have less movement than you ( rare for most pcs ) , opponents can attack you just as easily . 
  exactly , even more versatility for disengage that is n't really possible with a shift . 
   which has no mechanical effect unless your campaign uses the optional flanking rules . 
  i know they 're technically `` optional '' , but do people really * not * use them ? 
  i treat that like feats , they 're technically written in to be optional , but that 's just because 5e wants to be as modular as possible . 
  to me , the * default * with flanking , just like with how i treat feats , is to * include * them . 
   `` if i add this 5-foot step rule , will some types of character use it literally every turn , to the exclusion of other built-in actions like disengage ? '', 
  eh , i never saw it happen in my campaign . 
  it seems to me that the characters who would most use this are rogue type characters , who want to zip in and out of combat . 
  but rogues already get disengage as a bonus action , which is clearly the better option . 
  archers and casters tend to stay out of range as much as possible anyway , so it does n't matter too much . 
   if you want to include it in your own game great , but there are plenty of good reasons not to , you 're just ignoring them . 
  it 's not that i 'm * ignoring * them . 
  i just do n't see any of them that really * make sense * to me . 
  if that 's not what it is , then please , by all means , elaborate . 
  how do * you * interpret disengage ? 
  that 's funny , it 's my experience from fencing that made me think shifting makes way * more * sense than the `` disengage '' action does ( though i 'd still allow disengage because it makes combat more flexible and enjoyable . 
  if i 'm fighting with someone , there 's basically no reason i * ca n't * step back away from them safely . 
  but to turn and run is much more difficult and unrealistic to do safely . 
  d&d fights take turns . 
  it 's one of many unrealistic abstractions in the game that are necessary for it to function ( perhaps the next biggest one , if not one that 's even worse , being `` hit points '' ) . 
  you have to accept that that 's how the fights work in order for the game to even begin to function . 
  i 'm sorry , but i just really do n't agree . 
  there are certain aspects of it that i can see some people preferring because it creates greater micro , like the units kiting thing i described . 
  heck , * maaaybe * even the bad pathfinding ( though that is * really * stretching it -- frankly any good modern game should have units that can figure out how to get from a to b once the map has been explored , not necessarily in the most efficient way , but without getting stuck ) can be excused as being a different style of game . 
  but build orders and maps stuck at a particular view angle ? 
  there 's no good way to excuse that . 
  it 's just bad game design . 
  the game 's very old , so at the time it was n't a problem , because the game mechanics were just newly being developed to allow for that kind of thing . 
  but it 's something that makes the game not hold up well today to a critical eye . 
  because that 's how you have to judge it . 
  you can look at it in its historical context , and that 's just fine . 
  go ahead and do that . 
  and i 'll say this for it -- in its historical context , it was a * fantastic * game . 
  easily the best rts that was out at the time , in my opinion . 
  but it has mechanics that just do n't hold up * today * . 
  from another perspective , think of graphics . 
  anyone can agree that if you look at a game like aoe2 , or half life , or whatever , * just from the perspective of its graphics * , you 'd say they 're bad . 
  they just are . 
  there 's no getting around that . 
  but they were great graphics for the time they came out . 
  in their historical context they were great , but an objective look at them as they hold up , you have to be critical of them . 
  it 's easy to see the comparison in this context , but the same thing applies with the game mechanics . 
  you just have to * think * a little bit * critically * . 
  sure , they borrowed what was good , and * improved what was not * . 
  that 's the ** point ** . 
  as time moves on , what is still `` good '' changes . 
  in some cases its artistic/gaming preference , but in other ways , because games are such a relatively new medium , they improve in more objective ways as the technology to express the medium improves . 
  comparatively , art has changed very little `` mechanically '' over the last few centuries . 
  paints and brushes became good enough to express pretty much any idea long ago . 
  so from a technical perspective , paintings from the 1600s are just as good as today . 
  artistic tastes have evolved , but that 's not the point here . 
  a more apt comparison would be to really early cave paintings or what not . 
  you can look at them and say `` these were really cool for their time , but they simply could n't do with that technology what egyptians could do when building their grand temples , or what michelangelo did on the ceiling of the sistine chappel . '', 
  not just because their artistic tastes were different , but because they lacked the technology to do that . 
  that description is literally pure mechanics . 
  it does nothing to explain * why * you do n't provoke opportunity attacks . 
  * any * interpretation of it narratively has to make assumptions . 
  i made the assumption that seemed most logical . 
  you obviously get to use your full movement still , so whatever it is you do with your action , it has to allow moving at normal pace . 
  so distracting the enemy or carefully stepping back , or whatever , then turning and running made sense . 
  but you 're right that it ca n't be used to buy actions . 
  you obviously ca n't substitute your movement for a bonus action like you could in previous editions ( with `` minor actions '' instead of `` bonus actions '' ) . 
  perhaps i 'm describing it incorrectly , but they way you describe it is pretty much how i envision it . 
  the point is , though , that you 're still obviously moving a substantial amount , so whatever it is you 're doing , it obviously is n't something that slows you down at all . 
  yeah i do n't know of any significant podcasts that are regularly less than an hour . 
  besides , i ca n't imagine listening at less than 2x speed . 
  most of the podcasts , i listen to at 2.4 -- 2.8 x speed . 
  gradually increasing speed , you get used to it pretty quickly , and they seem really * slow * at normal speed . 
  i 'll second the other guy 's idea of listening at speed and skipping ads ( after you 've heard the ad for the product a couple of times ) . 
  i personally listen at  2x speed for most podcasts .
