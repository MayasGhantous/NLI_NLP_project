  though it 's a little creepy that someone went to that someone went to the effort to actually check it . 
  edit : just realised i misread the comment i replied to . 
  `` who is that '' was my personal facebook page . 
  and `` why did [ the person / u/tomwithasilento replied to ] link [ my ] profile '' was because the screenshot above used to contain an obfuscated link to my facebook profile . 
  the user tomwithasilento replied to had typed in the obfuscated link , and then made a comment containing a link to my facebook profile that used the vanity url . 
  obviously against reddit 's rules , but i was stupid to leave that text in there to begin with . 
  interesting . 
  it 's happening for me on both os x and windows ( though on os x it does n't have the personal information included in the original screenshot ... ) . 
  works for me on os x and on windows -- though os x is n't showing the personal information on it that was there on windows . 
  present, 
  i 'm super excited for the upcoming star wars movie , in no small part because of the music . 
  john williams is hands down the ** best ** composer of film music out there . 
  no one else comes even * close * . 
  ( many composers have one or two great scores -- i actually think the lord of the rings ' soundtrack is the best one for any particular movie/series -- but no one else has a body of work that is both as good and as consistently so as williams ' . ), 
  but this would be better posted in / r/moviemusic or / r/soundtracks . 
  it is n't strictly classical music , even if it is fairly heavily classically inspired . 
  just a tip , you can prepend each line with ''  '' to get it to look like proper greentext . 
  you can see the rest of our style guide [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/wiki/style ) . 
  yes , i 'm aware that it 's against reddiquette . 
  heck , i 'm fairly sure it 's against reddit 's * site-wide * rules . 
  but that does n't mean it was n't stupid of me to submit something that had a link in it that would get them to my personal facebook page . 
  i 've been frequently travelling since i was about 10 . 
  bloopyblob has most of the important points . 
  i would also suggest drinking something * every * opportunity you get . 
  does n't matter if it 's water , soft drink , juice , or what , but make sure you get a lot of fluids . 
  the inside of aeroplanes can dehydrate you pretty badly without you noticing . 
  it 's also nice because it 'll force you to go to the toilet , which is a good excuse to get up and walk around a bit and stretch your legs -- which you really need to do from time to time . 
  yeah , a turn based strategy was the first thing i thought of . 
  why is this purple ? 
  \\* hovers over link *, 
  clever . 
  are you sure it 's a collective noun ? 
  i thought that was a word for words that describe a group of things , like a `` herd '' describing a group of animals . 
  is n't the word you 're looking for `` uncountable '' noun ? 
  please do correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  ( also , regardless of what the correct word for this type of noun is , `` data '' can correctly be used * either * way . 
  it 's my understanding that using it as a countable/non-collective noun is fairly common in the uk . ), 
  timpani and timpano are one case where even when used in english , the italian-style pluralisation is maintained . 
   buy some things to nibble on from a duty-free, 
  duty free is usually stupid expensive . 
  buy something from your local store beforehand . 
  otherwise , i agree on all counts . 
  though having the window seat does have its advantages . 
  you can lean against the window to sleep on , for example ( though these days most flights seem to have those cool neck pull-out things on the headrest , so that 's less useful ) . 
  and also , particularly for someone new to travelling , it can just be cool to be able to look at the window and see the city as you come in . 
  i tend to prefer aisle seats , nonetheless , for the reasons you specified , and because you can put one leg out slightly in the aisle for a little extra leg room . 
  in general , you 're definitely right . 
  though i did just provide one counterexample ( albeit one that 's only used within one fairly niche community , and a community that 's already used to italian terms ) where that 's not the case . 
  ah cool , thanks for that . 
  from the article , it looks like `` mass noun '' is synonymous with `` uncountable noun '' as i used it . 
  [ here 's what i get when i type it in chrome ] ( https://www.facebook.com/help/246962205475854 ) . 
  edit : for what it 's worth , i just tried it in firefox . 
  the reason it broke ( at least for me , when i tried clicking on it ) is that it was linking to ` / selfxss . ` , with the full stop in there . 
   you ca n't get any food in your carry-on, 
  that 's very unusual . 
  what countries are you usually flying between ? 
  i 've never been to ( or from ) america , though i have certainly heard a lot of things about how security to get into america is substantially more onerous than in other countries . 
  but even so , i 've never heard about * food * not being allowed in carry-on . 
  liquids , yes . 
  you ca n't go anywhere with liquids . 
  but foods ? 
  that 's very unusual . 
  of course not , but that does n't change the fact that it was stupid of me to do it . 
  it 's like if i were walking around a rough area with an expensive phone out , and i 'm going around with no awareness of my surroundings . 
  if someone comes and mugs me , they 're clearly the ones in the wrong , not me . 
  but it was still dumb of me to do that to begin with . 
  i decided to look this up , to check . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3 ) , you can see that black people commit 38 % of murders in the us . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_the_united_states#race_and_ethnicity ) , you can see that `` non-hispanic black or african americans '' make up 12 % of the us population . 
  so the person that made that comment * was * wrong , but black people * do * commit a higher portion of murders than whites , per capita . 
  now , i would not be in favour of making judgements about this based on race . 
  there are a multitude of other socio-economic and historical factors at play that have * lead * to the situation . 
  i took the online course from harvard called cs50 last year . 
  the first project was in scratch . 
  oh god i hated it so much . 
  i first started a few years back on a different online course , in python , and that was so much easier to get my head around . 
  in accordance with standing order 94 ( b ) , and with the speaker 's naming of the member , i move that the honourable the treasurer be suspended from the service of the house . 
  zagorath , leader of the house, 
  meta , is that what you wanted ? 
  well , this is an interesting conundrum . 
  in the history of parliament , only once has the parliament * not * supported the speaker in naming a member , in 1975 under whitlam . 
  so convention strongly dictates siding with the speaker . 
  and yet , to vote in favour of naming a member of my own party ? 
  i 'm going to have to back up the speaker on this one , primarily because of my duty as leader of the house . 
  though i certainly do not expect anyone else to use the same reasoning in their votes here . 
  i 'll be entirely honest , this is one of those cases where i do n't particularly see the need for a third reading . 
  very little was said at the second reading , and i suspect this was because many of us just thought it so obviously necessary . 
  i commend this bill to the house . 
  zagorath , leader of the house, 
  even so , we 'd be more than happy to see this story reshared over there . 
  there 's no need to reformat it into `` greentext '' . 
  the name 's [ more what you 'd call a guideline ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6kgs_awuh0 ) . 
  not just pirate-style . 
  aye is used in parliaments when doing a voice vote , where it means `` yes '' . 
  it 's pronounced similar to `` eye '' . 
  it 's funny you say that , because earlier elder scrolls games supposedly ( i have n't actually played anything older than oblivion ) actually used very similar * mechanics * to d&d . this lead -- especially in morrowind , where the graphics had gotten good enough to look like a simulationist 3d world -- to confusion/frustration where it looked on the screen like you 're clearly hitting the enemy , but the game would call it a `` miss '' ( a tie-over from `` miss '' in d&d not necessarily actually meaning that you miss entirely , but fail to register a substantial enough hit to do damage -- explaining why higher armour raises your ac , as does higher dexterity ) . 
  also not a natural-born american citizen . 
  i 'd rather see it be john . 
  hank should be whatever the us equivalent of science minister is . 
  ( is there a secretary of science ? ),
