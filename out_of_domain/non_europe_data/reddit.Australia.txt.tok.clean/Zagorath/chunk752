  surely destin would be way better as secretary of education or something ? 
  is him hating the bald eagle something well known among his fans ? 
  i 've never really followed him , but he 's hosting crash course us government & politics , and he has a running gag on that where he punches an eagle . 
  i 've always found it really lame , but if it 's an in-joke for his normal fans , that 's a lot less lame . 
  was he in a wheelchair when he got elected ? 
  ( genuine question , i do n't have a clue as to the answer . ), 
  if not , it does n't really count , because that means america never * voted in * a person in a wheelchair . 
  i use canary as a secondary browser . 
  when i want to quickly load something up without having to open my main chrome with its 25 + tabs ( often when i 've first booted up the computer , since any other time my normal beta-channel chrome is already open , so i just use it ) . 
  it 's usually perfectly stable , though from time to time canary will run into issues where it will crash * very * frequently . 
  these times are rare enough to not be a significant problem , though . 
  most of essentials is garbage , but there are a few good nuggets in there . 
  i 'm a huge fan of the heroes of shadow book , which , unlike many of the other essentials books , was entirely new content -- not previous races/classes/whatever restructured to fit the essentials format . 
  yeah , i think the lack of a well-defined magic system was one of the biggest problems with the series . 
  i think potter is perhaps the best example of a series which does * not * do a good job of following [ sanderson 's first law of magics ] ( http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/ ) * , which is that :, 
   an author 's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic . 
  in potter , magic is used too frequently to solve problems , but the reader does not understand said magic well enough for that to be the case . 
  contrast with , say , asoiaf or lotr , where magic is not well understood , but also rarely used , or avatar , where bending ( `` magic '' ) is used with extreme frequency , but has very , very well defined rules that are followed strictly ( with very few rare explorations into more unusual types of bending , which are generally well explained ) . 
  \\* i should probably point out that sanderson himself thinks potter sits in a good spot in the middle of the scale . 
  so the criticism here is * not * coming from him , but from my interpretation of his laws . 
  while we 're on it , cortex 11 is showing up for me , but its thumbnail is the one reddit shows when no thumbnail can be detected , rather than being the cortex logo like all the others . 
  i think you missed the sarcasm ... 
  i actually * really * like the 1606 union flag . 
  i 've never been a fan of the current union jack because i feel it 's way too busy , and too far abstracted from its origin as a merger of the countries in the union . 
  but the 1606 one was more clearly a cross ( pardon the pun ) between the st george and st andrews crosses . 
  ( of course , either way there 's no representation for poor wales ... ) it 's also way less busy , and would be easier for kids to draw . 
  i 'm going to be completely honest , the tipping culture in the us is one of the many , very minor factors that leaves me just really not wanting to ever go to the us . 
  obviously not enough on its own , but it 's one of a number of small factors that add up substantially . 
  the guy in the picture is neil armstrong ? 
  and i 'm guessing he 's a lefty ? 
  not sure how we 're supposed to figure out either of those from the picture . 
  there 's no indication that the guy has anything to do with space , and he 's even wearing his watch on his left arm . 
  i mean , the title obviously helps , but it would 've been better if op had picked a picture that a ) actually shows it 's neil armstrong/an astronaut , and b ) is clearly left handed . 
  do n't forget that ( most of ) america uses daylight saving . 
  that would add -4 to the list . 
  that ca n't be pepsi , because [ the korean flag is already pepsi ] ( http://www.respect-authority.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pepsi_logos1.jpg ) !, 
  also on mobile browsers , long press , and then click `` open in new tab '' . 
  if brady does n't like vegemite , he has to hand in his australian citizenship immediately . 
  strawberry freddos ? 
  what are these ? 
  the only freddo frogs i know of are milk chocolate , white chocolate , or half-and-half . 
  i dunno , i 'm just giving people options if they want them . 
  wow interesting . 
  i 'm guessing it 's milk chocolate surrounding a strawberry flavoured nougat or something ? 
  yeah , when i hear `` olive skin '' , i think of someone who lives around the mediterranean . 
  definitely white , but a slightly darker range of `` white '' . 
  oh god yes . 
  the fact that tax is not included in the price is another one of those many minor factors leaving me not wanting to go there . 
  oh god vegemite chocolate bars ? 
  i 've heard of them , but i thought they stopped selling them pretty quickly . 
  it sounds awful ... 
  vegemite is amazing . 
  chocolate is amazing . 
  but there is no possible way that the two of them together could be anything other than horrible . 
   this almost seems foreign and a bit cheeky to me . 
  would you perhaps say it 's a little * naughty * ? 
  yeah , that 's another one of the little factors . 
  star wars . 
  the whole damn series is just full of some of the best film music that 's ever been made . 
  with the [ imperial march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnv5spu0c1e ) you get one of the greatest and most iconic leitmotifs representing your ultimate bad guy . 
  with [ the force theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcz9kq1h-zy ) you get this overwhelming feeling of hope and power , but also undertones of sadness , reminiscent of a time gone by . 
  [ across the stars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm_zwnd40aa ) is perhaps one of the best love themes in all of cinema . 
  so beautiful , and yet so incredibly sad . 
  it 's a real shame that the on-screen chemistry did n't match the music . 
  and of course , themes like [ duel of the fates ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzvbqbosf5w ) and [ battle of the heroes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drgxgigpkuc ) you get this incredible epicness representing the eternal struggle between the light and dark sides of the force . 
  the score as a whole is really fantastic , too . 
  the way williams uses leitmotifs throughout the score , using little snippets here and there to evoke certain places , people , or ideas , is really clever . 
  perhaps my favourite little detail is how [ anakin 's theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_rzi7y_nus ) initially sounds innocent and wonderous , but on closer inspection , it contains these unstable harmonies , and a theme that is clearly related to the vader 's theme , representing who anakin would later become . 
   no drive-by actions here, 
  does this mean you ca n't play as you 're walking by a target ? 
  because that really seems like it would take out a lot of the fun that ingress has . 
  it 'd make it impossible to be a causal player ... 
  if he us trying to make fun of religion , what 's it to you ? 
  religion happens to be a pretty good topic to make fun of . 
  i actually agree with your main point . 
  i play d&d , which is presumably what he 's referencing , and i do n't see the connection . 
  okay , a bishop is like a cleric of high enough level to cast 6th level spells . 
  but why is he able to grant that ability to lower level clerics , and what do feats or saving throws have to do with this ? 
  the courts and judges scenario makes way more sense . 
  i * think * the word you were looking for is canon , with one n. i * know * it 's one n when discussing `` truth '' in fiction like tv shows and films , so i 'm guessing that tern probably came from its use in religion . 
  cannon with two ns is generally reserved for big boomy things . 
  but i could be wrong about this . 
  umm , this link goes to the main page of the blog , not to session 4 . 
  as you add more entries , this will no longer be an accurate link . 
  [ here 's a link that will remain correct ] ( https://sayguh.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/session-4/ ) . 
  interesting . 
  how can you detect whether or not someone is connected to the public power outlet or not ? 
  also i like the fact that you 've specifically called out military bases as something that * not * available to the public . 
  ingress has been too leniant with cases like that , i feel . 
  out of interest , what would the case be with areas that anyone * can * get access to , but are n't free ? 
  i 'm thinking theme parks and airports . 
  anyway , i 've requested my invite . 
  excited to try it out . 
  how 's that ? 
  at least from the very little i 've seen of it , power banks are probably * less * important than in ingress , since part of the game is that you have to be plugged in to a power outlet to play . 
  edit : punctuation, 
  if the suggestion is seriously become a vegan , fuck off , that 's stupid . 
  veganism brings with it a struggle just to eat * healthily * . 
  not to mention how essential eggs and dairy are to people 's daily lives . 
  if it 's become vegetarian , well , that 's significantly less stupid , but still not going to happen .
