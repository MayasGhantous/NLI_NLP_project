  if it 's just stop eating beef , still not going to happen , but at least you 're trying to be a little realistic . 
  not gon na downvote , though , mainly because i 'm curious to see other people 's responses to it . 
   it 's not a sandwich !, 
  it says so in the name, 
  except it literally says `` sandwich '' , without any negator , in the name . 
  i did n't even realise there was a debate over this . 
  that said , i have no idea why one would eat one of these . 
  they seem like an awful mess . 
  honestly for me it 's just that i want to be able to easily * avoid * the homebrew stuff . 
  once you click through , it 's usually pretty easy to tell the difference , but i 'd rather stop before i get to that point . 
  honestly i think season 5 is worse . 
  both are significantly removed from the first three seasons though . 
  i think we can all agree on that . 
   especially the last two like when bilbo throws little rocks and kills orcs one by one . 
  that 's actually not a dumb thing the movie added in . 
  hobbits ' skill with throwing rocks is noted a few times in the books , and i thought that one particular scene was a really cool nod to the source material . 
  while it 's certainly true that many parts of northern europe do have * very * high rates of english fluency , i suspect that your anecdote is n't a particularly good one . 
  it 's surely subject to selection bias . 
  people of whom you have heard are bound to be more likely to speak english , since you 're more likely to have heard of them if they * do * speak it . 
  it 's hard to become an international celebrity * without * speaking english . 
  was it a [ dagger ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dagger_ ( typography \\ ) ) ? 
  that means the comment was `` controversial '' , i.e. , it received a large mix of both downvotes and upvotes . 
  my group handwaves most material costs . 
  if it says `` uses 25 gp '' , we would just say `` you pay 25 gold pieces each time you use it '' . 
  same with copying spells into a wizard 's spell book . 
  rather than requiring that they go and buy 20 gold or whatever it is worth of special inks , you just say that they pay 20 gold each time they copy a spell . 
  if you 're putting spreads like jam or vegemite on your bread , that makes sense ( and indeed , that 's what i grew up eating ) . 
  but the idea of a sandwich with solid foods like cuts of meat and vegetables going onto an open sandwich is just bizarre to me . 
  when reformatting , somewhere in the menu it should show you how much space will be available . 
  does this confirm that there should be 32 gb ?

  fwiw , it looks like op 's about to run them through lost mine of phandelver , which was created on pre-final versions of 5e . 
  as a result , its balance is a bit out , and some of the combat encounters are a lot more deadly than might be considered well-balanced . 
  so healing is somewhat more important in this adventure than in general 5e play . 
  and also , fwiw , it 's not just divine casters that can heal during combat . 
  all casters apart from the main three `` pure '' casters get cure wounds , and bards , clerics , & druids get healing word . 
  this story is a really well-known greentext , by the name of `` sir bearington '' . 
  if you 're interested , [ here 's the actual origin of the story ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2dpqop/the_original_story_of_sir_bearington/ ) ; it was n't originally put online in the greentext format . 
  as / u/the _ gibson said , / r/dndgreentext is a great place for more stories like this . 
  in particular , the [ hall of fame ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/wiki/hof ) from that subreddit has a list of some of the very best stories . 
  the short ones are a great read and can be gotten through relatively quickly . 
  the longer ones are , in my opinion , totally worth it ( `` stranded '' especially is my favourite ) , but some of them are * very * long , and might be worth reading a little bit at a time , over the course of a few days . 
  hell , if that 's the case , there 's a good chance that this and the next iphone may be able to * share * cables !, 
  would n't that be something . 
  it never even ocurred to me that there might * not * be one this coming monday . 
  what holiday is it ? 
  is it a major one in the us ? 
  the gazebo story is on / r/dndgreentext , but it did n't originate there . 
  it probably originated on 4chan , as many of the best stories did . 
  [ here 's the dndgreentext page on it , though ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/21795a/not_greentext_but_a_classic_eric_and_the_gazebo/ ) . 
  3.5 e is an edition of the dungeons and dragons roleplaying game . 
  it 's a really old and quite outdated one now , but a lot of the classic stories came out in this era . 
  the dm is the `` dungeon master '' , the person who runs the game . 
  sort of like the referee/umpire , but also the storyteller . 
  characters have classes , one such class is the `` rogue '' . 
  rogues are good at sneaking and stealing , but also at bluffing . 
  `` put every point i can '' refers to putting skill points ( which are n't a thing that exists any more -- it 's been substantially improved and simplified -- but in 3.5 you got a certain amount per level , based on your intelligence , i think ) . 
  putting more points into disguise means that they get better at disguising themselves . 
  max out bluff is referring to the same thing , only with telling lies/bluffing . 
  prestige classes are a 3.5 thing . 
  i 'm not really entirely sure what they are . 
  i think they 're sort of like specialty classes . 
  apparently getting the prestige class `` spy '' makes you better at disguising . 
  edit : missed one, 
  a `` perception check '' is when you roll a die to see if you can perceive something . 
  if you 're looking for something that 's hidden , or to see through a disguise , you make a perception check . 
  similar to bluff and disguise , perception is a skill that you can get better at . 
  the better you are , the larger number you add to the die roll . 
  [ it 's not the controversial dagger ] ( http://i.imgur.com/382wkm2.png ) . 
  or at least , if it is , the subreddit css is n't working correctly for me . 
  but i have n't turned it off ... 
  half a page is a bit limiting , but i do agree that 14 pages is a bit extreme . 
  i mean , if it 's as a personal exercise that 's totally awesome , but needing the dm to read that much is pretty unrealistic . 
  2 pages is a more reasonable amount . 
  for my current character , i gave the dm about 3.75 pages hand written . 
  it 's probably about 1.5 typed . 
  that 's about the length most of my group usually uses , and i think it 's a pretty decent sweet spot between expressing nuance in the character and not needing the dm to read * too * much . 
  what 's happened , if so , is that your reddit app has linked to ** i. 
  **imgur.com/[letters]**.jpg** , when it should be linking to imgur.com/**gallery**/[letters], 
  sounds like you need to get a better app . 
  surely an argument could be made that winnings in that lawsuit are `` proceeds of crime '' ( and if they 're not legally considered that -- indeed , i highly doubt they would be considered as such in most areas -- perhaps they * should * be ) and thus the state could confiscate the winnings ? 
  mr chair , i can not agree with this , at least as posted . 
  it 's far too broad and unspecific . 
  i would instead propose a system whereby the first instance gets a warning ( the first time it is noticed , up to a maximum of , say , 3 altered votes , secondings , and speeches ) . 
  the second instance up to , say , 5 altered votes , secondings , and speeches , or the first if more than 3 are altered in one occurence is dealt with under 94 ( a ) . 
  the third instance , or earlier if more than 5 are altered , it should be dealt with under 94 ( b ) . 
  there should also be a provision for notifying the speaker of deletions or alterations after the fact , and if it is done at the time of the alteration , and is agreed to by the house ( done by voice vote based only on the short explanation given ) , it should be forgiven . 
  if no warning is given by the time the changes are noticed , no possibility for leniency under this system should be allowed . 
  i 'm too busy at the moment to draft up a specific formal wording of this proposal , but i think it would work effectively . 
  if one person is seen to be abusing the system by changing votes , they will still get kicked out , but there is some room for accidental stuff-ups , and leniency as a one-time thing if it becomes necessary if it is for a very good reason .

  how does one `` subscribe '' to a thread on reddit ? 
  that 's really terrible and i sincerely hope your friend is doing better now . 
  but the fact is the data does n't agree that your anecdote is the norm . 
  * in general * people are much less likely to kill themselves by jumping into traffic , or even jumping off cliffs , than they are off a bridge . 
  these suicide barriers really do reduce the total rate of suicides . 
  jam . 
  people outside america refer to what americans call `` jam '' and what americans call `` jelly '' by the same name .
