  just `` jam '' . 
  personally i would think that unless it 's something you personally are interested in doing anyway , i would n't bother . 
  unless the module is specifically tailored towards the influence of religion on music and/or the arts , which could be a very interesting course . 
  as the video describes at the beginning , the piece is composed using only notes of the triad of the current chord . 
  [ skip to 1:00 ] ( https://youtu.be/shjzdegq26i?t=60 ) for the actual music to begin . 
   people outside america refer to what americans call `` jam '' and what americans call `` jelly '' by the same name . 
  just `` jam '' . 
  couple of questions . 
  how come it is n't showing up for me ? 
  i * do n't * have subreddit css turned off , but i 'm still getting the standard dagger . 
  how did the original final fantasy use mindflayers ? 
  i thought they were one of the few monsters in d&d that are actually copyrighted/trademarked by dungeons & dragons ? 
  they 've just replaced it , apparently . 
  basically , the normal css is something like, 
  . comment.controversial  . entry . score : after {, 
  content : ' \u2020 ' ;, 
  ` . comment ` represents a comment . 
  ` . controversial ` represents a comment that has been marked `` controversial '' by reddit 's secret algorithms . 
  and ` . score ` represents the bit where it actually says `` 2 points '' or whatever . 
  that 's reddit wide . 
  but if you apply something in the subreddit-specific css , it * overrides * what 's in the reddit-wide css . 
  so they 've done something like, 
  . comment.controversial  . entry . score : after {, 
  content : url ( ` the_image . png ' ) ;, 
  so it then displays the image in that place , rather than the typographical dagger . 
  in your defence , it does look an * awful * lot like an illithid . 
  and interestingly , flair is only showing up for me as text . 
  i 'm guessing they 're supposed to show images ? 
  if so , then i suppose there 's some problem on my end . 
  odd that the up/downvote buttons are displaying with the appropriate css styling , though ... 
  what i 'm guessing happened is that i watched the other one a while ago ( after having seen it on this subreddit ) , and then at some point youtube decided i must want to watch more like that , so this one showed up . 
  then i watched it and , having forgotten about the first one , decided to post it , because i thought it was pretty cool . 
  but yeah , i agree , i loved how he 's clearly really enthusiastic about what he 's doing . 
  [ here 's what it looks like normally ] ( http://i.imgur.com/382wkm2.png ) . 
  yeah , that 's a real bummer . 
  i do n't suppose the reason there 's none of that is because they 're gon na release that in a free pdf ? 
  i have n't got princes of the apocalypse , but i know there was the free pdf of player material for that . 
  was player content * also * in the printed book ? 
  if * not * , then i would n't be too worried yet . 
  if so , then i 'm a little disappointed . 
  fingers crossed , i guess ... 
  when 's the official release date ? 
  honestly on second thought , it does * feel * like it 's been around longer than 4 years . 
  but i 've just gone searching , and i ca n't find * any * greentext earlier than 2011 that 's even similar to it . 
  well that would explain why some people already have it . 
  i was under the impression that anyone who already had it must have gotten it significantly early . 
  unless you meant the 4th october ? 
  but either way , if there 's going to be a pdf ( though at the moment , i 'd guess signs point to there * not * being one ) , i 'd expect its release to coincide more with the full release of the book than some limited one . 
  the comment has been * substantially * edited since the time i made my comment . 
  as in , it apart from the contents of the second paragraph , it does n't even resemble the same comment any more . 
  assuming you 're already using alien blue , i 'm afraid i do n't know any . 
  your best bet is probably to submit a bug report or something . 
  not sure how you 'd go about that . 
  maybe / r/alienblue ? 
  niantic allowing bullshit does n't make players abusing that bullshit acceptable . 
  well hmm . 
  now i 'm completely stumped . 
  i feel the opposite . 
  * always * use the river for a guide . 
  especially if it 's from near the city , the bridges , of nothing else , make a great reference point that help you know where you are . 
  that was brilliant , thanks for sharing . 
  i definitely felt in the pilot that they were going for a similar feel to williams ' score without using it explicitly , and i thought it did a great job . 
  the idea that they might explicitly use it later down the line is so awesome , but i 'm doubtful of that ever happening . 
  first dc would have to let them actually show superman in a significant way , and second i ca n't imagine the rights to use that theme would come cheap . 
  it 's one of the most iconic film scores ever , written by the greatest film composer ever . 
  it so perfectly encompasses what superman * is * to many people . 
  i do n't think we 'll be moving past it any time soon . 
  man of steel 's score was okay for the film it was in , but that film was very tonally different to a normal portrayal of superman , so using the same style of theme for that would have been out of place . 
  what exactly is a turn-based rpg ? 
  something like pok\u00e9mon or final fantasy , where combat is done in a turn-based manner ? 
  or is it something else ? 
  there was n't really very much subjectivity in there ... all the answers were pretty cut and dry ; there are clear `` right '' and `` wrong '' answers , scientifically speaking . 
  but it was well-designed nonetheless . 
  thanks for including `` this question is not relevant to me '' for the questions where that answer was relevant . 
  obviously having people who answered they have n't experienced mental illness just automatically * skip * those questions would 've been better , but i assume that was n't possible with the survey building system . 
  out of interest , when designing this , did you ever consider also asking if someone * close * to the survey taker has experienced mental illness ? 
  i imagine that could shape one 's opinions in a way similar to experiencing it themselves . 
  also curious that there were no questions about religious belief , despite asking if they think atheism is an illness . 
  but still , very interesting . 
  i do n't know if chrome 's extensions api makes this possible , but would it not be more useful with the option to sync this between computers ? 
  if it 's encrypted as a blob with a key that only the user knows , there should n't be any security risk to that . 
  they 're ending support for spdy because they 're starting support for http/2 , which is * based * on spdy . 
  i 'm not disappointed that we 're getting the larger published book . 
  in fact , i 'm super excited . 
  i 'm disappointed that the new player content is n't coming out for two more months . 
  i feel that the * non * - variant human is stupidly underpowered . 
  +1 to every stat ? 
  who cares even the most mad characters only really need like 3 stats increased . 
  so if i want to play a human for thematic reasons , the so-called `` variant '' human is the only good option . 
  it gives the human a feature that 's mechanically strong enough to be worthwhile . 
  to me , because of this , the `` variant '' human really should be considered the standard one . 
  hell , even ignoring the fact that it makes humans mechanically not terrible , it takes them from bland and boring with no particular flavour into the extremely versatile race that 's capable of doing anything they put their minds to , as the flavour text suggests they are supposed to be . 
   you play the role of this character that already has a personality, 
  that 's not really `` role-playing '' in the true sense . 
  the * point * of roleplaying is that the * player * is giving their character its personality . 
  games where the character already has a role can be great in many cases ( games like tomb raider or the last of us -- which i consider perhaps the greatest game this decade -- put the player into a character that has its own personality , and through that tell a great story ) , but they are not role-playing games . 
  dslr lenses can uses filters . 
  i have a uv filter on my lenses -- not to actually filter uv ( because what the fuck would be the point of that ? 
  ) , but specifically because it has no appreciable impact on the image , while protecting the lens from any minor bumps . 
  nd filters and graduated filters ( like nd filters , they make the image darker , but only over half the image -- good for landscapes where the sky is bright and the land is dark ) are very commonly used .
