  ( by the way , when you say `` the south '' , are you talking southern uk , like , between cornwall and east anglia , or southern usa , like , texas and florida ? ), 
  i thought that 's what / r/funny was ? 
  someone needs to make / r/text a thing . 
  do we * want * the show revived ? 
  it ran for 5 good seasons , had just about the best ending any tv show ever has , and it 's been years since the finale . 
  i 'd love to see a movie set a few years after the final episode , but reviving the show in the tv format would n't be as good . 
  what if you also add in tucows ( the canadian company which owns the hover domain registrar and the ting telco ) ? 
  i 've never used either of them , so take this with a handful of salt , but freshbooks has sponsored a few of the podcasts i listen to , and from the ad reads , it sounds like they pretty much just do billing . 
  they 'll track billable hours and stuff like that for you , too , but it does n't sound like they do much outside of the billing process . 
  if i 'm buying something from someone i do n't already have a relationship with , i trust paypal to have my back if i get ripped off by the seller . 
  if the place i 'm buying from does n't support paypal or some other payment service like google wallet , and * only * supports direct credit/debit card payments , i 'm more likely to avoid buying . 
  and i know i 'm not the only one like that . 
  i 've never used it , and heck i would n't even really know what it does . 
  but yay for international support !, 
  the username probably shoulda given it away ! ), 
  oh definitely . 
  paypal is fucking * terrible * for sellers . 
  i 'm sure most people here have probably heard of that story where they told a buyer to destroy a priceless violin because he claimed it was fake . 
  but the fact is that consumers do trust them , and feel safer when buying through them . 
  present, 
  i can see it going either way , really . 
  `` risk '' is essentially `` likelihood of thing happening '' times `` how bad it would be if it happened '' . 
  if it 's someone on the internet , the likelihood is * waaaaaay * higher , but the severity is probably not quite as high ( though can still be pretty bad in some cases ) . 
  it being someone in real life is far less likely to happen , but if it does , it 's much easier for it to be a more severe problem . 
  somewhat ironically , the * safest * thing to do with these things is to always be logged in * on * facebook . 
  that way , when the `` connect with facebook '' comes up , if it 's legit , it 'll automatically recognise you and simply ask you to click to give it permission . 
  if it 's fake , it 'll require you to type in a username and password , which you should just avoid doing . 
  if you 're not logged in already , it 'll * always * ask you to log in , which means there 's no easy way to spot the fakes . 
  yeah , especially now that you can be more granular with what access you give them . 
  for example , on this lollipop site , they wanted access to photos , friends lists , location , etc. 
  but i figured anyone who 's stalking me 's probably not gon na be on my facebook ( since i 'm quite careful with who i add ) , so i did n't want to give them that . 
  i gave them the bare minimum instead : only what anyone logged out can view . 
  and the video ended up showing absolutely nothing useful apart from my profile pic and name . 
  back in the day , you had to give them everything they want , or nothing . 
  and on the topic , darths & droids is a great comic that uses the same premise , but with the star wars movies . 
  what does `` saving a princess '' have to do with being an overbearing liberal ? 
  if anything , it 's something i 'd associate more with conservative politics than with progressives . 
  conservatives tend to be the ones that want to hang on to the monarchy , while progressives are more likely to want to dump the queen in favour of a republican system . 
  i mean , at that speed it 's substantially faster than the speed of sound , so would n't there be a sonic boom or something ? 
  that might have some sort of mechanical benefit by startling enemies or something . 
  i 'm not really sure how sonic booms work . 
  hell , what if you made the rail gun heaps longer , such that with purely newtonian physics it would break the speed of * light * . 
  does relativistic physics exist in the world of d&d ? 
  would that have some sort of an effect ? 
  lots of interesting possibilities . 
  but of course as you say , any reasonable dm would simply step in and say `` nope , that 's dumb , not gon na allow it '' somewhere around the third peasant or so . 
  well ... this is what i get for not going on reddit before 12 today . 
  guess this is happening the long way ? 
  what does that even mean ? 
  wait , if that 's the long way , then what 's the short way ? 
  because that already seems pretty damn short . 
  yeah , i would suggest that the 24 hour time frame is probably best . 
  that way we can at least ( as far as my understanding of the procedure ) keep moving on other bills in the mean time . 
  what does '' / d/eviancy '' entail ? 
  it needs to have the protocol out front for reddit syntaxt to work . 
  the `` http : / / '' or `` https : / / '' , typically . 
  an episode based on the boardgame cluedo ? 
  i 'm not really even sure how that would work . 
  would n't it be pretty damn similar to just about any mystery/investigation style episode of a show ? 
  or exactly the opposite . 
  maybe the barbarian is feeling off his game today ( because he rolled a bunch of 3s and 4s ) , and the wizard really feels on top of his game . 
  it would actually be a really cool simulation of how a person can perform differently based on things out of their control , like minor sicknesses or whatever . 
  5 government mps , i think you 'll find . 
  i accept this motion . 
  let debate conclude at 1700 . 
  meta : i would suggest that everyone else wait until the pm makes the second speech , in direct response to the mover 's , before making their own . 
  it 's only polite . 
  if i were running this , i would still have the first hit die automatically at its maximum , same as with official rules . 
  it would be all the ones after that which get rolled for . 
  ( and also you add your con mod to each die . ), 
  classes with higher hit dice would still on average do significantly better than ones without ( average on a d12 is 6.5 , average on a d6 is only 3.5 ) , but it adds a little variety and room for off days , which i think is both more realistic , and adds some really interesting narrative depth . 
  how do you roleplay the barbarian who for this fight , only has 25 health at level 4 ? 
  no , i did n't realise there was one . 
  a movie explicitly based on cluedo ? 
  edit : i 'm guessing the picture comes from the movie ? 
  i was assuming it was some sort of cheesy '90s ad for the boardgame . 
   i find great satisfaction in building characters do certain things and then seeing those things being accomplished by the characters in game , the greater the accomplishment the more satisfying it is . 
  this rule would not negate that . 
  on average your tanky character would still do far better than one who does n't have such a high hit die . 
  assuming you are n't only playing a game that lasts like 2 sessions with like 4 combat encounters , it 's going to average out ( and personally i would n't like to run with these rules unless it were a long campaign , because the narrative benefit is minimal in a one-shot ) . 
  hell , as you level up , it 'll become rarer and rarer for your character to not have the highest health . 
  if you 're rolling 7d12 compared to the wizard 's 7d6 , the variance is low enough and the difference in expected values high enough ( a difference in the ** expected ** value of ** 21 ** coming from your expected health - wizard 's expected health , 45.5 - 24.5 ) that you * not * doing better is going to be rare . 
  the difference is that your `` bad day '' is going to be about the same as a wizard 's average day ( you 'd have to roll an * average * of 3.5 on a d12 , which is extremely unlikely even at medium levels ) , while a wizard 's really * good * day is a little less than your average day ( the * best * he can do is all 6s , which is less than your average of 6.5 ) . 
  and then you factor in the two cases we have n't considered thus far , the wizard 's bad days ( say , rolling an average of 1.5 ) or your good days ( if you get an average of like 9.5 ) , and you can easily see that a character built to be tanky is definitely not going to lose that tankiness with this rule . 
  the game 's maths is robust enough to withstand this kind of thing . 
  in fact , this rule is n't really messing with the game 's maths at all . 
  it 's already a standard option to roll for your health each level after the first . 
  this is just saying that instead of it being a one-off thing that you do each time you level up , you 're rolling them each ( and as i said in the other comment , i would probably * not * roll the very first hd if i were to use this houserule , making it even more like the official rules ) encounter . 
   something you have to roll for each encounter that benefits from a modifier each time , rather than a static stat on your character sheet, 
  interestingly , the degree of variance in that is precicely why some people elsewhere in this thread suggest using a d10 rather than a d20 : it makes the static modifier worth more . 
  which i think is really interesting . 
  though i would n't agree with those suggesting a d6 or d4 , mainly because when the variance is that low , you 're gon na get a lot of ties , and i hate dealing with ties in initiative . 
  and , as i said in another comment , the standard rules for health already basically work this way . 
  it 's just that instead of rolling each encounter , you only roll once , so you could be a terrible barbarian , but you 'll * always * be a terrible barbarian , instead of it being something that only happens occasionally on an `` off day '' like with this house rule . 
  the chinese also thought this was the plan , and because of this got involved directly in the war , which is what pushed the front line back to more or less where they started . 
  hear , hear !, 
  same with paypal , and that 's what i do in both cases ( i do n't keep any money stored in either account -- unless you count the play store credit from doing surveys ) . 
  but because the money is going * through * them , it 's an extra layer of protection . 
  you can first go to paypal/google and say `` this charge was fraudulent/i did n't get what i payed for '' in * addition * to then being able to go to the debit card provider if pp/g deny it . 
  australia , but yeah , we call it cluedo .
