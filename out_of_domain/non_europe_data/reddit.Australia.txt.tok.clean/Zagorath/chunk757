  sounds cool , i 'll have to give it a watch . 
  oh right , i did n't know that . 
  not that it matters . 
  i just googled it . 
  apparently it 's a us only thing . 
  fine then . 
  let 's ignore canada , and try australia . 
  the structure is exactly the same as america 's with regards to local , state , and federal governments . 
  but australia still has a federal law requiring parental leave in some form . 
  i did n't realise it was from a movie at all . 
  i thought it was one of those cheesy '90s style advertisements for a product with a live action family playing the game , like [ this one ] ( https://youtu.be/wllelom3gti?t=80 ) with the shark game ( among others ) . 
  mr speaker , i must say , i am deeply , deeply ashamed of the opposition . 
  many times in conversations in / r/australia , / r/australianpolitics , and even in the early days of the / r/modelparliament , i have seen people talk about their dissatisfaction with the level of negative discourse in real life politics . 
  the rl coalition , in particular , has been dispicable in the way they use negative rhetoric to force their way to power . 
  i had hoped that this parliament would be different . 
  that we could be reasonable , and discuss the issues that are important , and pass good policy , without any of the negative rhetoric that has been a cancer in the rl parliament . 
  unfortunately , for the last few weeks , the coalition has been ramping up the negative rhetoric , and this motion is the epitome of that . 
  on this very day , we have seen the royal assent of two new bills first introduced by the government . 
  this government has introduced or supported the coalition on an impressive amount of policy considering everyone involved is completely new to this and we 're figuring things out as we go , not to mention that we 're volunteers who can not spend an overwhelming amount of time on this . 
  despite all these obstacles , we now have a high court , an abc , a committee working hard on a few important technical matters . 
  the parliament has passed marriage equality , repealed the abbott telecommunications nonsense , made numerous constitutional amendments ( subject to referenda ) , and created a renewal energy target . 
  all while keeping the country running economically . 
  does this sound like the sort of thing you would expect from a government in disorganisation or chaos ? 
  i would put it to you that anyone who asks themselves that question openly and honestly would reach the same conclusion i have : no , it is not . 
  this motion is a sad sign from a party that clearly has more ambitions on power than on actually keeping parliament running smoothly and passing good legislation . 
  they have been hurling out their attack rhetoric for some time now , trying to fool you ( much like the rl coalition did during the rudd/gillard years , and even still do while in government ) into believing that their opposites are in chaos , and i think that despicable , and they should be ashamed of themselves . 
  mr speaker , i would urge the members of this great house to treat this motion for what it is , and dismiss it . 
  do not reward egotistical power-grabs : stand up for the party that has concentrated on passing good legislation . 
  leader of the house, 
  assistant minister for education & culture, 
  member for brisbane & surrounds, 
  edit : change referendum to its plural . 
  hear , hear !, 
  [ apparently people are linking speeches . 
  here 's the leader of the house 's ] ( / r/modelaushr/comments / 3jwfss/171 _ motion_of_censure_and_no_confidence_in_the / cut8atq ) . 
  why are you pronouncing the o like an a ? 
  meta : oh boy did you choose the right time to show up !, 
  ah right . 
  no , i can buy things ( at least through the google play store , like apps , nexus devices , and the link ) through google wallet . 
  i vaguely remember using it to buy something once on a third party site , in the same way i use paypal . 
  i think pretty much all the rest of its features are locked . 
  edit : just checked my transactions , yeah i used them on humble bundle once . 
  is the sergeant-at-arms also the governor-general clerk secretary of the senate house committee for press ? 
  where are you from that that 's true ? 
  i 've never heard anyone pronounce octopus `` ahck '' . 
  it 's always been `` ock '' . 
  granted , i 'm sure there are some particularly strong accents which would pronounce it `` ahck '' , but they would by far be the exception . 
  i was thinking of `` ahck '' more like `` bach '' than `` back '' , but either way , definitely does n't rhyme with `` clock '' , which is how i 'd pronounce `` oc '' in `` octopus '' . 
  obviously have n't listened yet , but i just wan na say i love the name of this episode . 
  edit : aww , it has nothing to do with sith ? 
  the only time i 've heard of asmr videos before this was when [ collegehumor did a parody of them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycgszc4grdo ) . 
  it 's nice to now know what they were actually parodying . 
  i dunno , there was n't really much of a twist in avatar ( apart from how shit it was , i guess ) . 
  so he does n't * always * use twists . 
   the main thing to remember is to keep an open mind and not to jump to early conclusions : just because someone looks nervous , or struggles to remember a crucial detail , does not mean they are guilty . 
  instead , you should be looking for more general inconsistencies . 
  oh god , this should ** not ** be a brief thing mentioned right at the bottom of the article . 
  it 's really damn key to the whole thing . 
  especially with the main scenario they 're talking about , with it being immigration/customs , if you were to probe me about what my plans are , i 'd have no fucking clue . 
  i do n't normally plan things in all that much detail , and even when i do plan , i do n't keep it in my head , i write things down , because my memory is terrible . 
  i can easily imagine myself looking * incredibly * guilty to one of these sorts of people if i were to be put to questioning . 
  yes , absolutely entirely different . 
  the o is more like the one in `` honest '' or `` christopher '' . 
  i went with option 2 , but i prefer the current g , with a straightened e. 
  one of my favourite d&d stories of all time goes by the name of '' [ an evil campaign gone ... good ? 
  ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21ba53/an _ evil_campaign_gonegood / ) '' it 's absolutely fascinating . 
  i wo n't spoil it , but it 's not too long , so i 'd highly recommend reading it . 
  i will say that its basic premise is that it starts out with an all evil campaign where everyone just does their own individual evil shit , except for one player . 
  there 's another good one called '' [ an evil necromancer in a solo online game ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2grdzv/an_evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game/ ) '' . 
  arguably , the character in this is n't * really * evil , but it 's still an interesting tale about a character that ostensibly is evil . 
  my third example is one from my own campaigns . 
  this is * not * something that would always work , and before anyone considers doing the same i would * highly * recommend they do a lot of introspection about their own abilities to play this and the way their group would react , but it went * so right * with my group , so i feel it 's worth sharing . 
  we were playing a fairly typical high-stakes `` save the world '' type campaign . 
  but throughout it , one player was planning to betray us at the end . 
  going behind our backs and sabotaging alliances we made , etc. 
  luckily , about three quarters of the way through the campaign , my character found out ( i started suspecting things out-of-character about one quarter of the way through the campaign ) , and then the rest of the party started plotting back against him . 
  when it came to the final encounter with the big bad , he did n't do anything . 
  he helped us defeat him . 
  but * after * that , he turned against us , and we had to fight him and some of his allies . 
  it also turned out that he had secretly gotten * another * member of the party on his side , so it was 2 pcs vs. 4 pcs , with npcs on either side . 
  in the end , the character who first started betraying us escaped . 
  his player dmed our next campaign , and made his former character the bbeg . 
  i think * that * was an evil character done right . 
  but it only worked because we all loved the intrigue of finding out that he was working against us , and then us trying to counter his plots , and him countering our counters . 
  it was awesome . 
  but not every group can handle that kind of stuff , so do think twice before doing it in your campaign . 
  edit : i completely forgot about one of my absolute favourites !, 
  [ this is a story called `` the mechanic '' , set in a star wars rpg ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/217h1w/star_wars_tabletop_the_mechanic/ ) . 
  by virtue of me sharing it in this thread , i 've kinda spoiled the story , but it 's still an awesome read , albeit a relatively long one . 
  i find it interesting that you would need to be told to do it that way . 
  to me , the most natural way to stir with my left hand * is * clockwise . 
  with my right , it 's acw . 
  i 'll just quickly copy-paste my thoughts from another thread where this was shared :, 
   the main thing to remember is to keep an open mind and not to jump to early conclusions : just because someone looks nervous , or struggles to remember a crucial detail , does not mean they are guilty . 
  instead , you should be looking for more general inconsistencies .
