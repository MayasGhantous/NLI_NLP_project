  i was grouping all of your amendments ( being all to so94 ) into one , with the amendments to so91 being the ones i disagree with . 
  open it in an incognito window or something , then . 
  it worked fine for me without a subscription . 
  or just google it , all i did was take the first source i saw that was n't from a company explicitly focusing on apple news . 
  what your data shows is the market share . 
  that 's not what i was referring to , i was referring to growth . 
  the rest of the market is stagnant , but apple sells more and more computers each year . 
  but even so , comparing apple on its own to the entire rest of the industry is stupid . 
  you need to compare them to other individual manufacturers , where they compete much more substantially . 
  hell , for a * really * accurate comparison , you should compare mac sales to the sales of other computers starting at $ 1,000 . 
  i do n't have data on it , but i suspect if you did that you 'd see that apple has the largest share , not the * majority * , but a plurality . 
  apple is not the most successful computer seller , but to say it is not * a * successful computer manufacturer is just ignorant . 
  [ link to the first comic ] ( http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612 ) for anyone who has n't read it , or wants to read it again . 
  oh man , it did n't even occur to me that your plan was to do one on each of the fellowship members . 
  this is so awesome . 
  out of interest , if you want to cross-post these over to / r/dndgreentext , i 'm sure it 'd be really well received over there . 
  probably [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) worthy . 
  meta : i am curious as to why this one ends at 0900 when the referendums one goes until 1200 . 
  not that it really matters , just wondering . 
  how did you rank the issues in terms of how much you care about them ? 
  no , you always exist * on * your turn . 
  50/50 that you exist * between * turns . 
  potentially a disadvantage in that you ca n't make attacks of opportunity or provide flanking for your allies , but an advantage in that you ca n't get hurt . 
   a loyal retainer would not directly turn on his king, 
  what if you suggested that it was n't really his king he was turning on , but a doppelganger that had imprisoned the true king and impersonated him ? 
  it 's also worth noting that dailies actually do n't have to be * every * day . 
  they 're just very regular . 
  you could have one that 's `` every thursday and saturday '' or `` all weekdays '' , too . 
  progressive and conservative is a better way to put it . 
  liberal has different connotations depending on where you 're from . 
  i honestly do n't know why sites do n't just redirect connections to https by default . 
  it 's like one line in the server configuration to do it , and these days the overhead is unnoticeable and you 're never going to run into compatibility problems . 
  4111 to be precise , you clever bastard . 
  haha this is brilliant . 
  i think it 's probably my favourite ( apart from the original gandalf one , of course ) so far !, 
  the 60fps animations look really sweet . 
  have you used them before ? 
  also , loved how you referenced `` the rule of two '' in both this and the last ~ ~ hi ~ ~ cortex . 
  which one did you decide upon first ? 
  my british history education ( at a british international school , not an actual school in britain ) only started with henry viii . 
  it 's insane how complicated things are even just in the time between then and just like the next 150 years were . 
  also , yay for all the jameses . 
  jamess ? 
  james 's ? 
  but it 's a back up youtube name . 
  same for australia and eastern asia . 
  at the time i watched it , 1080p/60 was the highest option i saw ( and it 's larger than my screen anyway , so that did n't matter ) , but i 'm seeing up to 4k/60 now -- musta just been processing or something . 
  so it looks like it 's worked great . 
  what 's number 2 ? 
  ( humans need not apply is obviously 1 . ), 
  actually for possession with words ending in '' s '' , either '' s ' '' or '' s 's '' are acceptable . 
  the former would be used if you pronounce it with only a single s , and the latter if you pronounce it with two of that letter . 
  so if you pronounce the possessive form of `` james '' the same as the plural , you should be spelling it '' james 's '' . 
  source : good at grammar , and also a james . 
  yeah the badx subreddits are just really fucking awful and cancerous . 
  unlike other meta subreddits ( such as srd ) they also make no attempt to keep to themselves . 
  they 'll happily invade threads and downvote people that disagree with their narrow world-view , or attempt to correct them . 
  heck , they do n't even require non-participation links . 
  the people that frequent badx subreddits are some of the worst reddit has to offer . 
  what do you mean ? 
  this subreddit is for posting stories based in some way on d&d or roleplaying . 
  that 's what the above is ; and a damn good one , at that . 
  my first character was a shardmind psion , so i definitely would like to see shardminds make a come back , as well as psionics ( though they 're obviously * already * doing stuff with psionics ) . 
  the shardmind race has such awesome flavour to it if you get into their backstory . 
  i 've always felt that they fit in thematically with eberron , so a supplement for there could be a good place to put them . 
  i also would really like to see vryloka and the vampire class from heroes of shadow make a reappearance . 
  vryloka are a really interesting race , with a flavour quite similar to the vampire lords in skyrim ( in that they 're often nobles , and that they got their vampiric abilities directly from a god ) . 
  and i 'd like to see a class that enables a progression of vampiric powers . 
  the vampire template for players in the mm is insanely overpowered . 
  instead , i want to see something that starts out having only the most basic of vampiric abilities , and gains more over time . 
  for obvious reasons , a ravenloft campaign setting ( and its associated player 's companion ) would be a good place to introduce these options . 
  but truth is a valid defence against libel . 
  on a more serious note , so is `` fair comment '' , which it would seem to me that this is . 
  weirdly enough i was thinking about just this earlier today . 
  since paladins use charisma , you could play a really suave cool kinda guy : really playing up the charisma aspect of it . 
  [ this is one of the most famous stories out there ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2178r7/the _ story_of_the_drunken_fighter / ) : tl ; dr ( ** spoilers here ** ) , the paladin pretends to be a grumpy fighter . 
  going the opposite direction , taking a warlock ( a class that is normally associated with dark brooding mentalities ) and making a really light a cheerful character out of it . 
  [ here 's a post i saw someone else make . 
  ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 31j7w0/nontraditional _ warlock_ideas / cq2evb9 ) i actually based my current idea very closely on this , with a few alterations ( for example , my character is a warlock who actually * thinks * she 's a wizard , and i dropped the tiefling thing in favour of just being human ) . 
  the whole thread that came from is actually full of good examples of unusual or different ways to play a class , albeit the class chosen is the same for all of them . 
  with the waterborne adventures unearthed arcana , you can play a rogue that 's very different from typical the typical thief or assassin that most people think of when they think rogue . 
  the swashbuckling captain of the sea . 
   i miss the days of flash video, 
  when i read just that much , i thought you meant flash-based * players * of standard pixel-based video formats , and was mildly disgusted , until i read on and found out what you really meant . 
  is ... is my name even real anymore ? 
  i was mainly thinking for sites that already have a certificate , because very many sites that * have * a certificate only use it during the explicit stage where they are logging the user on and sending the password . 
  but even so , you can get an ssl certificate for a single domain and one subdomain for free from [ start ssl ] ( https://www.startssl.com/ ) . 
  and there 's nothing stopping you from just grabbing more from them for the same main domain , but a different subdomain . 
  has a limit of 10 participants , to my knowledge . 
  do they need to be video meetings ? 
  you could use an audio-only chatroom type application like mumble or teamspeak for only whatever it costs to run the server . 
  if anything , i 'd say your discrepancy is a rather small one . 
  my 10k race pace is probably somewhere around 4 or 5 minutes faster than my training pace . 
  oh yeah , so it was . 
  there 's a guy elsewhere in this thread roleplaying as her majesty , and they seemed to think the correct time was around 5:00 pm . 
  the video went up around that time * in australia * , so it was like 10 hours early , if that user is to be trusted . 
  okay , spill . 
  how did you get so damn close to being right ? 
  addition , having a higher total number of hit, 
  dice means a ranger can more efficiently heal,
