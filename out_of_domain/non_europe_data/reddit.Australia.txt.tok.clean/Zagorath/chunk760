  with short rests , providing finer control over, 
  how much healing to shoot for when spending, 
  hit dice . 
  sorry for the bad formatting , i just copied and pasted from the pdf . 
  but it seems pretty damn clear to me . 
  with that gain in health , they do also lose out on medium armour . 
  not sure i 'd call that a fair trade off , to me the barbarian should still be substantially bigger than anyone else on raw ability to take hits , and this overshadows that . 
  but they have tried to at least balance it mechanically somewhat . 
  yeah , that 's really weird . 
  i mean , thematically it makes * so * much more sense than strength/dex that the official ranger gets , but mechanically i feel they have n't done enough to balance it . 
  so , for clarification , this completely removes the `` favoured enemy '' rule ? 
  yup . 
  that 's definitely what they were going for . 
  and to be honest , i kinda like that aspect of it . 
  i 'm not really sure i like the fact that it outshines the barbarian for total health output , though ( with an average of 7 + con per level , compared to the barb 's 6.5 + con ) . 
  just the greater degree of control is a nice unique bit of flavour . 
  i feel like making it 2d4 +1 + con or something like that would 've been better . 
  do n't forget the best health in the game !, 
  same maximum possible output as the barbarian , with a higher average . 
  * ** two strong saving throws ** ( dex and wis ) , instead of one weak and one strong that * every * other class gets, 
  * ** 2d6 hit dice ** makes it stronger than a barbarian . 
  it has the same maximum ( 12 + con ) , with a higher average ( 7 + con versus the barb 's 6.5 + con ), 
  * ** loses medium armour proficiency **, 
  * ** loses favoured enemies **, 
  * ** ambuscade ** gives them an extra turn in combat before * anyone * else . 
  * spirit companions replace animal companions . 
  that seems to be the biggest stuff . 
  personally , i like the flavour it gets from dex and wis , clearly fits the class better . 
  but mechanically , it seems like it could be too much if it is n't balanced by other features . 
  i like the idea of a more flexible health recovery . 
  but i * do n't * like it being tankier than barbarians . 
  maybe 2d4 +1 would have been a better flavourful fit . 
  ambuscade feels * way * too powerful . 
  i 'm thinking maybe it should have only applied to their favoured terrain . 
  edit : or maybe once per long rest . 
  ( or maybe both -- once per long rest when * not * on favoured terrain , unlimited otherwise . 
  i dunno , just something that 's not * this * ... ),

  i ca n't say i disagree with that . 
  it feels like the sort of thing that 's only really useful if the character has been built with a particular scenario in mind . 
  for example , the ranger in my campaign picked as his favoured enemy merfolk ( as one of his `` two humanoids '' ) , which are the major enemies in the campaign . 
  he created this as part of his backstory after knowing that disliking mer is a major cultural feature in the area . 
  so in his case , it works really well . 
  but for a case where you 're going in blind , or where there 's no one or two types of enemies that really stand out as being the `` right '' choices for the campaign , it loses out quite substantially . 
  no , not really . 
  even going back to its origins , this subreddit has had a lot of stories that are n't in the greentext format ( [ eric and the gazebo ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21795a/not _ greentext_but_a_classic_eric_and_the_gazebo / ) and [ the mechanic ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 217h1w/star _ wars_tabletop_the_mechanic / ) were two of the earliest stories to be shared here , for example ) . 
  if you have a look at the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , you 'll see that a lot of our best stories have been in a more free prose . 
  the name is more a nod to how a few of the most famous stories ( in particular sir bearington ) are in the greentext format . 
  but we 're really open to ( and encourage ! ), 
  any sort of roleplaying-based stories . 
  that 's the key difference between us and / r/gametales . 
  you wo n't find any civ stories here , or even skyrim . 
  it 's just tabletop rpgs . 
  [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/4zuynhkal1i?t=1m48s ) ( which is on a completely unrelated topic ) does a fantastic job of summarising how this whole verisimilitude/suspended disbelief thing works . 
  specifically , from about 2:00 to around 5:45 . 
  people want a watsonian explanation for things , not a doylist one . 
  doylist explanations for these things are often obvious and , therefore , uninteresting . 
  sometimes ( like in this case , to be honest ) there is n't a good watsonian explanation , but the least they can do is acknowledge that this is the case , and move on . 
  making up excuses for it * in-world * is lame . 
  i generally use facebook chat . 
  it 's awful , i know , but it 's super convenient . 
  i have n't liked any of the other messenger applications i 've installed on my phone ( including slack and telegram , which i used briefly because my local ingress faction used them ) . 
  code snippets get pasted into pastebin or some such . 
  just a tip , dvorak is a person 's name , so it is n't in all caps . 
  qwerty , azerty , etc. 
  are all caps because they 're named after the physical arrangement of the keys on the keyboard . 
  the set up wizard has an option for upbeats in it . 
  that 's the best way to do it . 
  otherwise , change the time signature in the first bar only , and hide the time signature changes from view . 
  next , you should read [ darths & droids ] ( http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html ) , which takes the same idea and applies it to star wars . 
  but muh state rights, 
  you ca n't . 
  the surveys are anonymous regardless of whether the taker is logged in or not . 
  holy ** fuck ** this guy is racist . 
  i mean , he makes a couple of good points in there , but mostly it 's racist vitriol . 
  and if he thinks sweden is like tumblr , then he 's obviously not been very deep in tumblr . 
  it 's way worse with the feminazism than what he seems to be implying sweden is . 
  he 'll never be opposition leader again . 
  his hold on the leadership is tenuous enough as it is -- if he loses an election he 'll be out of there for sure . 
  even some fairly well-liked leaders step down after losing an election . 
  yeah , the closest to that that i saw was maybe a claim that they 're the first to bring a tilt and orientation sensor on a stylus to a mass ( i.e. , not just specialist graphical applications ) market . 
  other than that , there was no claim that they truly invented anything entirely new .
