  so do make sure to double check when that happens . 
  antony green giving some * really * good explanation for the reasons that australia has had so many leadership changes over the past few years . 
  * apparently in other parliamentary systems , such as canada , there 's a much stronger culture that government has a mandate . 
  * party politics and voting along party lines is much stronger than in other countries, 
  * the media focuses on polls too much, 
  god i love the abc . 
  can send this link to my parents overseas . 
  thanks for sharing . 
   i think the difficulty is [ malcolm turnbull ] may be popular among labor voters who are n't going to vote liberal anyway and he probably be more unpopular among many conservative liberals . 
   so i think there may be a boost in terms of of the leadership ratings but it 's what his leadership does to the party support which is more important . 
  but i thought you have to be absent from parliament for quite a substantial time before you can get kicked out , do n't you ? 
  even in our model parliament , we had sooky absent for weeks , and yet he was still a week away from being replaced . 
  and we passed an amendment to shorten the timeframe in which that can happen . 
  my question was really meant to be that if you 're absent for less than that time , is there any point in getting leave , apart from being respectful and adhering to convention ( which are both , of course , very good reasons on their own -- i 'm mainly asking from a hypothetical perspective ) ? 
  yeah definitely . 
  sure , turnbull 's popularity might largely be with some more right-wing labor voters . 
  but almost by definition , he 'd also be popular with swing voters , without losing any faithful liberal voters . 
  if we had a right-wing equivalent to the greens -- a semi-mainstream party to the right of the lnp as the greens are left of labor -- the liberals might have lost votes to them , but we do n't have one of those , and preferences would lead through to the lnp anyway . 
  i get what you 're saying . 
  he certainly wo n't be losing votes of die-hard liberal voters . 
  but what this will do is increase instability within the party , because those die-hard liberals are not going to like turnbull as much as a more traditionally conservative leader . 
  aparently despite having something like 50 years more time as a country than us , canada has had significantly fewer prime ministers over the course of their existance than we have . 
  so from at least the perspective of stability , it * has * worked out well for them . 
  sure , the current government may no longer be popular , but he has been in since 2006 , so in the eyes of canadians at large , he 's obviously done something right in that time . 
  perhaps he 's been spending too much time on / r/modelparliament . 
  with `` bishop '' , `` leadership '' , and `` treasurer '' also in the top 10 . 
  edit : wait , you may have been talking about the worldwide trends . 
  libspill is currently the * global * # 1 trending topic . 
  those others are n't on the global list , but are on the australian one . 
  no i get that . 
  but you have to be absent without leave for a very long time before the timer reaches 0 , do n't you ? 
  two months in real life , or two weeks in our model ( once the referendum takes place ) . 
  so if you 're only going to be absent for a week or so , the only reason to get leave rather than going awol is ( and again , this is , in my opinion , very important ) respect for parliament . 
   it 's up to tony abbott to decide * when * the liberal party room will meet , and * at what time * . 
  mate , those are the same thing . 
  later this evening !, 
  antony green ( the abc 's election analyst , and widely regarded as australia 's foremost expert on the numbers behind politics ) had some good thoughts about it . 
  * apparently in other parliamentary systems , such as canada , there 's a much stronger culture that government has a mandate . 
  * party politics and voting along party lines is much stronger than in other countries . 
  so in our parliament , a leadership change is * necessary * for parties to change the way they vote on issues . 
  * the media focuses on polls too much , and thus what might have otherwise be a temporary dip in polls can get exacerbated until the party feels the need to ditch the leader in favour of someone else . 
  what are your thoughts on the opposition 's recommended preference flows at the last senate election ? 
  for fuck 's sake , liberal party . 
  we are not america . 
  the public ** does not ** choose the prime minister . 
  * any * party has ** every right ** to change its leader , and if they are in government , to change the prime minister . 
  all this bullshit about how the australian public has the right to do it and not parties is a load of crap that fundamentally misunderstands our westminster political system . 
  and apparently the official advice is that if you get swooped , you 're supposed to * stop * and * walk * the bike . 
  fuck that , i wan na get away from the evil monster that 's attacking me as fast as i can . 
  hear , hear !, 
  i wan na see an aussie house of cards . 
  in australia , we do n't have a directly elected president . 
  we only have a house of representatives and a senate . 
  our pm is the leader of whichever party has the most seats in the house of representatives . 
  a little like your house majority leader . 
  because the pm is chosen by the party , they can change mid-term . 
  all that has to happen is someone in the party challenges them for the leadership , and then the party votes on it . 
  that 's what 's happened here . 
  malcolm turnbull ( until recently , the minister for communications ) has decided to challenge tony abbott ( the pm ) for the leadership . 
  his reason for this is that abbott 's ratings in polls have been falling , on the basis of a number of bad policy decisions and political gaffs . 
  yeah , that 's why shorten 's speech was focussed on pointing out that malcolm winning wo n't change anything . 
  he wants to get in to attacking turnbull before he even gets into office . 
  which tpp ? 
  two party preferred ? 
  the pirate party ? 
  twitch plays pokemon ? 
  my best guess is they 're against the latter two of those , and neutral on the first . 
  but on a serious note , you 're probably talking about the trans-pacific partnership . 
  both labor and the liberals support it . 
  the greens are the only major party against it . 
  the way it generally works ( i believe ) is two votes . 
  first , a yes/no vote to decide if they want a leadership spill . 
  then , if the first vote succeeds , a vote between different candidates . 
  there can be multiple candidates , and the current pm may or may not run in this second vote , if it takes place . 
  if there are multiple candidates , i * believe * they do runoff voting . 
  not instant runoff ( more commonly known as [ alternative vote ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y3je3b8hse ) or av ) , but a multi-stage thing , where first everyone votes for their favourite candidate , then if no one got over 50 % , the lowest candidate is eliminated and another vote is taken . 
  last time a leadership spill motion happened , back in february , there was talk about some people voting * yes * in the first vote , despite actually wanting abbott to stay as leader . 
  the reasoning behind this was that if they went to that second vote for the actual leader , and abbott won , it would be a stronger show of confidence . 
  a show that they actually strongly support abbott over anyone else , rather than simply meaning that they do n't want to change . 
  if he loses both votes , he 'll ( by default ) stay in parliament as the member for warringah ( his electorate ) . 
  he does have the option to resign from parliament entirely , which would force a by-election in his electorate . 
  but i ca n't imagine that will actually happen . 
  edit : with the first vote , the yes/no one , nobody actually needs to specifically step up to challenge the leader . 
  last time it happened , the motion was moved by some backbencher , but nobody actually announced that they themselves wanted to become the next leader . 
  if the first vote succeeds , obviously specific people need to nominate as alternative leaders . 
  [ keenan not appearing , former liberal leader john hewson to appear instead . 
  yeah exactly . 
  people know einstein as someone that 's really smart ( and sherlock as someone who 's a fantastic detective ) , so they know when you call someone that , it 's meant sarcastically . 
  when buggs called elmer `` nimrod '' , people did n't know what that was referring to , so they had no frame of reference . 
  it looked like he used it as an insult , so they assumed that 's what it was . 
  well , strictly speaking , we do n't vote for the party . 
  we vote for our local representative ( same as america with your house ) . 
  in practice , most people choose which local representative to vote for based on which party they 're from ( again , the same as in america ) . 
  one of the big problems in australia compared to other parliamentary democracies ( like canada and the uk ) is that party discipline is * immensely * powerful . 
  voting against party lines is very rare , camparatively speaking . 
  so , `` does abbott have the power to go against his own party members is certain political instances ? '', 
  technically , yes , but in practice , this never happens . 
  whatever the party decides is how nearly everyone in that party votes . 
  but as leader of the party , he 's made a number of `` captain 's calls '' , where he 's decided the party position , rather than voting on it in the `` party room '' ( i.e. , rather than letting everyone in the party vote on what the party 's position will be ) . 
  yeah exactly .
