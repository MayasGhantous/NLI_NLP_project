  it 's a poor shadow of the original . 
  this comment felt so weird and out if place when it was the first one in the thread . 
   pictures did not link to your profile, 
  but this is ** wrong ** . 
  did you even bother reading the post from the creator of the site ? 
  it was n't made visible from the web interface , but it has * always * been available from the imgur app and via imgur 's api . 
  all the `` privacy '' that you previously had was just through obscurity , and not * real * privacy at all . 
  and , by the way , you still have a lot of obscurity . 
  go to one of your images in an incognito window ( logged out of imgur ) . 
  yes , you can see the username , but then follow it . 
  unless you 've deliberately shared images with the imgur public feed , you 'll actually not be able to find * any * of the * other * images you 've shared . 
  it 's not real privacy because people could still stumble across different links that you 've shared and collate them , but it 's just as useful from a security through obscurity point of view as what they used to do . 
  depends . 
  what do you mean by `` my full account '' ? 
  if you 're not sharing images with the public imgur feed , and you 're not making comments on imgur , or otherwise engaging with the social-media-like part of imgur , you 're not affected at all . 
  if you open one of your images in an incognito window ( i.e. , signed out of imgur ) , and then follow that link , you 'll be able to see what a random person could see . 
  for example , follow this link : http://imgur.com/6tisxg2 ( hopefully res wo n't change it to an i.imgur.com/letters.jpg link , if it does , remove the `` i. '', 
  and '' . jpg '' part of it ) , and then click on the link to my user profile . 
  you 'll be able to see the like four comments i 've made on imgur , and that 's it . 
  none of the other couple hundred images i 've shared on imgur under my account are discoverable . 
  i find it interesting that their number system is a simple base 10 translation of the hindu-arabic number system . 
  i wonder if it 's because they arrived at the same system independently , or if it 's a more modern creation made after contact from the west . 
  that `` pronunciation '' guide is utterly useless . 
  how the fuck am i meant to pronounce `` s@@ng5 '' ? 
  [ specifically , here is the link to the submission of this over there ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2grdzv/an _ evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game / ) . 
  this post is also in the [ dndgreentext hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  well , itunes said i could n't use it to create a weapon of mass destruction . 
  but i got around that by only using it to create a ballista out of pvc with a 500 pound draw weight . 
  present, 
  i do n't recall hearing about this happening ( the minister speaking on it , that is -- the dogs themselves were all over the news ) , but if what he really said was `` bugger off '' , then no , he might not have used some other words . 
  depending on the tone of voice in which he said it , it could quite literally have been the * least * offensive way of saying `` go away '' , even less so than actually saying `` go away '' , potentially . 
  it 's a psychological effect . 
  even if you think it does n't apply to you , it does . 
  it does n't work on a rational level like you describe , but it does work . 
  that 's a rubbish excuse . 
  shops use the same tricks everywhere in the world , but * only * america figures leaving tax out of prices is a good idea . 
  which is funny , since the people who think they 're backwards are the ones who are themselves backwards . 
  roundabouts increase safety and traffic flow . 
  you can have an opinion about them if you like , but if that opinion is a negative one , then you 're wrong . 
  i do n't know what it 's like in america , but here in aus , riding a bike on a roundabout is no issue . 
  we drive on the left , so my descriptions are for a right turn on a roundabout here . 
  flip all directions to be applicable in america . 
  stay as far on the outside as you can : all the way left , like you would be on any normal road . 
  indicate right as you first pull on to the roundabout . 
  go around , staying all the way on the outside : the left . 
  then indicate left just as you are about to get off . 
  i way prefer roundabouts to stoplights , since to turn right at a stoplight , i have to cross over into the right-hand lane . 
  if the light is red , i then also have to stop , which means a slow start up again when the light turns green . 
  and unsigned intersections ( or intersections with just a stop sign ) are even worse , since it 's the same problem as traffic lights , but with the added risk that if you do n't start fast enough , there could be traffic coming along the road orthogonal to the one you started on . 
  edit : you know what , my sleep-deprived brain misinterpreted you . 
  but i think i 've worked it out . 
  you 're already on board with all this , are n't you ? 
  you were replying to how intersections are worse than roundabouts ? 
  i had to sign after using paywave at a woolies a few days ago , because they said their network connection was down . 
  i guess that they like having the signature verefication for backup if they could n't verify over the network that it was all good . 
  yeah is n't the maximum like 20 pounds in the uk ? 
  that just seems like it 'd completely defeat the purpose . 
  here in aus it 's $ 100 ( about 46 pounds right now ) , which is way more useful . 
  last time he was in australia , [ we did this to him ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_epx61tkxky ) . 
   i really think pierce morgan should stop being, 
  ftfy, 
  only slightly . 
  roundabouts * are * safer and better for traffic flow . 
  that 's * why * you hear all these stories about places switching to them . 
  and from that perspective , people who dislike them and would rather they were n't implemented * are * being backwards . 
  but i worded it in a way that was unnecessarily confrontational . 
  a couple of sources , more can be found through google :, 
  but the store would have to have a visible sign that actually * says * `` all bags must be checked on exit of store '' for even that to apply , would n't it ? 
  most of the time when i 've had my bag searched i 've never seen such a sign . 
  i go with it anyway because i do n't really care and i 'm not an arsehole , but i ca n't imagine that without a sign it would even be theoretically enforceable in the way you describe . 
  please no . 
  not mmp , it 's a horrible system . 
  i do n't want parties officially existing in the system and being able to directly dictate which members get in . 
  we should use some form of open list-based proportional system , or we should use stv in the manner described in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsukma1cyhk ) . 
  but you do end up making the decision of in which order you place labor , greens , and lnp candidates . 
  so i think op is asking about how you make * that * decision . 
  personally i vote based on the party . 
  i do no research into the actual specific people ( although i happen to rather like my local member , despite him being from the faction i prefer less within the two-party-preferred party that i prefer more ) , and neither my vote nor my voting intentions have yet ever been swayed by the party leader . 
  yes . 
  unless the leader had moved the party on the whole in a direction that made me like them less than the next best choice . 
  but in that case , i would say that i no longer like the party , so i feel my above comment still applies . 
  well op was wondering if your local member or the party leaders influence the vote . 
  for example , if i were in wa , i would put scott ludlum first in the senate , then whoever the pirate party is putting up , then the rest of the greens , etc. 
  but for the most part i 'm with you , i do n't pay attention to specific members or leaders . 
  not much to say . 
  the current state of detention is inhumane and we should fix it . 
  yeah , it looks unnecessarily rude , but to be quite frank i ca n't think of a better way to put it . 
  i wish op the best of luck in the future , but i will certainly not be watching this show if it gets picked up . 
  i just make sure to always have bags [ that look like this ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/51tujx5ljvl.jpg ) . 
  why yes , good sir , my bag is checked , thank you for noticing . 
  i was more pointing back to the original post . 
  9 hours `` laurel oliver cut convo '', 
  why are the options iphone and samsung ? 
  i prefer android , but hate samsung , so i dunno ... 
  and ios vs. windows makes even less sense . 
  they do n't even compete in the same space !, 
  ios is a mobile operating system , on phones and tablets . 
  windows is primarily a desktop operating system that 's also on some tablety devices . 
  did you mean to ask ios vs. windows phone ? 
  seems a weird question considering the latter has negligible market share .
