  ios vs. android would make much more sense . 
  or perhaps you meant to ask os x vs. windows ? 
  you also ask about iwatch . 
  there 's ** no such thing ** . 
  apple 's watch is called the apple watch . 
  the question also does n't have an option for someone that owns a non-apple smartwatch , like the moto 360 . 
  this survey just * screams * lazy , if not ignorant . 
  hell even apple did , with the newton . 
  yeah , both spellings are common . 
  there 's only one spelling in korean , \uae40\ubc25 , but the transliteration standards have changed . 
  gimbap uses the more recent and more intuitive style , while kimbap comes from the older system . 
  it 's also why the company hyundai is spelt how it is . 
  that uses the older system , and leads many english speakers to pronounce it wrong . 
  the more accurate transliteration would be hyeondae ( the y is the same as in `` yes '' , it is only a consonant , and has no vowelness to it ) . 
  gimbap , for what it 's worth , literally just means `` seaweed rice '' . 
  \uae40 is a particular type of seaweed , and \ubc25 , a type of rice . 
  i 've always found insight to be more useful than perception , though either way , wisdom clearly has its place ( though my character is very deliberately meant to be na\u00efve , so i 've used wisdom as a dump ) . 
   the rolled scores are high enough that i would be incredulous anyways , and i 'd never allow scores that were n't rolled in front of the dm, 
  personally , i would n't allow that for * two * reasons . 
  i would require players * always * roll stats in front of the dm , because then there can never possibly be any question of trust being an issue . 
  but also , as a rule-of-thumb , a total modifier of between +2 and +5 before racial modifiers over all 6 stats . 
  if they had 20 , 18 , 18 , 12 , 12 , 12 , that means that they rolled at least an 18 , 18 , 17 before racials , which is +11 already ( without even accounting for the other three stats ) . 
  that is an * insanely * good character , and i would n't allow it even if it were rolled in front of me because it would n't be fair to the other players . 
  i agree with you on this , with the slight ( possible ? ), 
  exception of health rolls . 
  yes , they still need to roll in front of the dm , but i * would * allow mixing of rolling versus taking the average for health . 
  in fact , i allow players to choose each time they level whether they want to roll or take the average . 
  but if you roll on a given level , you ca n't change your mind after you see the roll . 
  [ this one 's in the dndgreentext hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2grdzv/an _ evil_necromancer_in_a_solo_online_game / ) . 
  that 's always a good place to start if you 're looking for a story . 
  since op said it 's government work , maybe they require not only that you are legally allowed to work in australia , but specifically require that you be an australian citizen ? 
  i do n't know much about the requirements of government work , but that seems not unlikely . 
  do n't forget the onions !, 
  ca n't have a good sausage sizzle without some barbecued onion . 
  that surprised you ? 
  that very much fits with the stereotype of ireland that i imagine . 
  i googled the question . 
  top result was about someone named chris brown who was barred from leaving the philippines in july this year . 
  i doubt that 's what op was asking about , but i 'm going to pretend it was anyway . 
  different people spend their money in different ways . 
  my parents moved overseas when i was 10 ( about 11 years ago ) , and after that , we pretty much travelled somewhere every christmas holiday and july holiday . 
  living overseas also meant that school trips ( sporting competitions or musical festivals ) often involved travelling to a new country . 
  i 've only been to about half the countries that the person you replied to has , but it 's not hard to see that if that 's what a person spends their money on , one can end up visiting a lot of countries quite quickly . 
  it 's about opportunity costs . 
  we do n't spend a lot on gadgets ( i 'm the only one in my immediate family with a phone that cost more than about $ 100 , and even that was only on the lower end of the `` high end '' smartphones when i bought it back in early 2012 and has n't been replaced since ) or content ( only go to the movies 2 or 3 times per year , and each of those visits is considerably cheaper than it would be in a more expensive country , and watching movies or tv at home is very cheap there ) . 
  but someone who puts more value in those latter things wo n't be able to travel as much . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of it . 
  i 'd love watermelon if it was seedless and i only ate the first bite or two of each slice . 
  but dealing with the seeds is a nuisance , and it loses its nice flavour if you try to eat more than about half way down the slice . 
  urban dictionary says :, 
   to ignore someone or continuously not follow through with an engagement . 
  but i 'm not entirely sure how it applies here . 
  and i 've never heard anyone use that phrase before . 
  of course it 's not all americans . 
  do n't be daft !, 
  it 's only all texans !, 
  yeah i agree completely . 
  i first started watching arrow because the on-demand in-flight entertainment on a flight i was on had the first few episodes of season 1 , and i loved it . 
  if it had been the season finale they offered , i may never have started watching . 
  there are still planes with this ? 
  i have n't been on a flight that * did n't * have those on-demand systems on the back of seats ( apart from on super-cheap airlines like air asia , where they had * no * in-flight entertainment unless you paid extra , whereupon they 'd lend you a tablet with some movies and stuff on it ) in nearly a decade . 
  i nearly left a comment saying the same thing . 
  but if you read on , you 'll see that what they mean is that it gives an * additional * 1/20 chance of a crit , * over * the normal 1/20 . 
  out of curiosity , is there any particular reason you put a paragraph gap between every line ? 
  i know it seems obvious , but it is n't necessarily the case , so having research to demonstrate that it * is * is quite useful . 
  well , it 's useful from a purely academic/interest point of view , anyway . 
  not sure how much actual utility it provides farmers or whatever . 
  a lot of things in nature are distributed in a way that is `` memoryless '' ( this is the technical term in probability ) . 
  an example of this , if we pretend it applies to cows lying down , would be that the probability of it getting up after 10 minutes is the same as the probability of it getting up after a total of 20 minutes , if it has already been lying down for 10 minutes . 
  however , the probability of it getting up after 20 minutes from the start ( if we do n't already know that it has laid down for any time ) is greater . 
  from your description , it sounds like this is not the case . 
  that cows lying down is not memoryless , which is interesting . 
  well , geographically speaking , he could n't have been much further * wrong * ( unless he had said new zealand ) , since australia is quite literally on the opposite side of the globe . 
  culturally , of course , yeah , very close . 
  i do n't even know what ccna is and i get this joke . 
  ** p ** eople ** d ** o n't ** n ** eed ** t ** hose ** s ** tupid ** p ** ackets ** a ** nyway is my favourite mnemonic for remembering the osi model . 
  ** p ** hysical , ** d ** ata link , ** n ** etwork , ** t ** ransport , ** s ** ession , ** p ** resentation , ** a ** pplication . 
  then it 's just a matter of remembering which layers actually get used in the tcp/ip stack , and which protocols run on each layer . 
  those parts are ( at least imo ) relatively simple . 
   `` database server '' is horrible to type on pleb keyboards, 
  holy shit yes it is :o, 
  but then , in dvorak , moving around a terminal can be a bit of a pain . 
  ` ls ` is particularly annoying especially because of its frequency of use , but ` chmod ` and ` rmdir ` are annoying as well . 
  the way i remember the protocols is that it 's fairly intuitive which * order * they go in , so work that out first . 
  mac is the lowest , because it 's tied directly to the hardware . 
  ip comes next , because you know the ip address has to get * used * to send stuff to . 
  tcp and udp are the next ones up , as they 're the ones that directly use the ip address . 
  then you have various user-end protocols like http and ssh , which happen over tcp or udp . 
  once you 've remembered the order they 're in , it 's nearly trivial to match them to the name of the layer . 
  the top one is the application layer , because applications happen there . 
  udp and tcp are the protocols that actually transport stuff from the source to the destination , so they 're the transport layer . 
  the actual network is formed out of the ips , but because the `` network '' in this case is the internet , we talk about it being the internet layer . 
  and then mac addresses are on the link layer . 
  yeah we almost never do the stereotypical `` dungeon crawl '' , so traps are a rare threat . 
  social interactions are * very * common for us , though , so insight to know if someone 's lying is important . 
  i certainly think they could fit in with the mcu . 
  dc 's taken a very different direction tonally with their films , so i do n't think arrowverse actors would fit in with their current universe . 
  to be honest , though , i 've never seen nearly enough of them * trying * to do acting that might fit in with the dccu . 
  i * doubt * they 'd be great at it , but i would n't write them off completely . 
  they might just be able to surprise us .
