  no worries , best of luck !, 
  i thought sony still completely owns the rights , they 've just agreed to let marvel make a movie in their universe using spidey . 
  might be because i 'm australian , but i ca n't imagine people mispronouncing kookaburra so that it has an l in it . 
  not like they pronounce brisbane like it 's the bane of their existence , canberra like it floats on air , or melbourne as though mel gibson was in the bourne trilogy . 
  oh that 's very interesting . 
  i did n't realise the deal went both ways quite so much . 
  i ca n't tell if this is an epic level of sarcasm or the sound of childhood dreams being shattered . 
  but i like it either way . 
  i do n't know any of these , so i ca n't say whether or not the following actually applies to them . 
  however , audio issues in general are likely to get better . 
  assuming the creators care at all , they 'll probably notice the issues and try to fix it by adjusting their editing process very early on . 
  if they have the budget and/or it lasts long enough , they 'll probably also buy better equipment . 
  too many people talking at once is something that i would * guess * should get better , because they 'll probably notice it 's a problem and try to correct it behind the scenes . 
  people 's voices or individual styles are less likely to change , but who knows -- if it was a serious problem for a lot of people , maybe she 'll have tried to tone it down , or stopped being on the show or something . 
  yeah , this was the sort of playing i 'd expect of a mediocre student early on in high school . 
  not good by any means , but no where near as bad as i expected . 
  i saw this same post in / r/brisbane a little over a week ago . 
  never thought i 'd see a cross-post from / r/brisbane become the 2nd highest post in / r/all . 
  [ here 's the post on the brisbane subreddit ] ( / r/brisbane/comments / 3k7z05/this _ is_mikey_hes_a_regular_at_down_under_bar / ) , if anyone wants more context or explanation about this guy 's story . 
   little exercise needed ( though obviously recommended . ), 
  especially if `` maintaining a normal weight '' is n't what you want . 
  you want to look * ripped * . 
  for that , exercise certainly * is * needed . 
  yeah , seriously , 3 hours per day ? 
  i 'm pretty sure age-grouper ( i.e. , amateur ) marathon or iron man competitors do n't do that much on average on weekdays . 
  if you 're eating anything close to healthy , one hour 3 times per week is easily enough exercise to just be healthy . 
  personally , the board games that i 've enjoyed the most have been the ones where players have to interact with each other socially in some way and have to make in-game deals and arrangements . 
  whether that 's games like risk , where you form temporary alliances ; settlers of catan , where you trade with each other ; or such games as battlestar galactica or the resistance ( which is the only game on this list that i * have n't * personally played , but of which i just recently watched [ wil wheaton 's `` tabletop '' episode ] ( https://youtu.be/g_qrczgzxqw?list=pl0y9n5ubjuxxjse6ljehrzicchym3e-as ) , and thought it looked good ) , where a subset of players are secretly working against the group on the whole . 
  that last set of games is probably my favourite . 
  it takes that backstabbing element and makes a whole awesome game out of it . 
  super fun . 
  i gave you my suggestions in the / r/dnd thread you posted this to . 
  i 'm only reposting it here because i wan na see what that bot has to say about them . 
  the bot looks cool as hell !, 
  * ** settlers of catan **, 
  * ** the resistance **, 
  * ** battlestar galactica **, 
  reposting because apparently the bot requires it be in bold . 
   not mentioning the wotc ones, 
   * betrayal at house on the hill, 
  just so you know , betrayal * is * a wizards game . 
  [ avalon hill ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avalon_hill ) ( its direct publisher ) is a subsidiary of wizards of the coast . 
  well , since we 're in a train of correcting people :, 
   mini putt, 
  i 've heard of `` mini golf '' , `` miniature gold '' , and `` putt putt '' , but never mixing the mini with the putt putt . 
  eh ... not sure i agree . 
  i mean , yeah , it 's basically a rip-off of d&d 3.5 e , but it * is * technically its own game , and wizards has no hand in publishing or in rights , as far as i 'm aware . 
  especially not in * that * iteration of it , since it 's not a d20 ruleset game . 
   even shorter is better . 
  if we had 2-4 hours to play we would play d&d, 
  honestly , this is why i rarely find myself wanting to play board games . 
  most of the ones worth playing tend to end up taking in the 2 -- 4 hour range , and at that point i would * much * rather be playing d&d . 
  only reason i play board games at all is that my circle of friends has a couple of people who no longer play d&d with us for various reasons ( regular time commitment , and not enjoying the game very much , mainly ) , and we occasionally want to get them involved . 
   attacks within 5 feet against him are automatic critical damage, 
  wait , what ? 
  where 's the source on that ? 
  i thought it was just advantage on the to-hit roll . 
   if they put the pieces into a catapult and then fired it , i would probably say it 's the definition, 
  no , cannon fodder does n't mean `` used as the ammunition for cannons , it means `` treated as expendable in the face of enemy fire '' . 
  i do n't know about japanese parliament , but from what i 've seen of korean government , it 's probably not all that extreme . 
   which is the same as fining those that do n't, 
  no it 's not . 
  it may have the same economic effect in some ways ( more babies ) , but from a moral perspective it is a * very * important difference . 
  one is providing a positive incentive to do something that is viewed as good . 
  the other is * penalising * the * absence * of an act to do something . 
  penalising inaction is n't * ipso facto * a bad thing , but it is something any government should think doubly carefully about before doing , whereas encouraging positive action ( or discouraging negative action ) is a much easier moral burden to bear . 
  as far as i 'm aware , the allies pretty handily won in the european theatre as well as the pacific one . 
  and the so-called `` 1st world '' ( i.e. , `` western '' ) countries were and still are allied with japan , at least more so than the so-called `` 2nd world '' ( i.e. , formerly soviet-allied ) countries were . 
  have good genes ? 
  yeah , if it were n't for reading reddit threads ( and * maybe * a few other online sources ) predominantly by american people , i would definitely have no idea about the `` black people like watermelon '' stereotype . 
  honestly , even though i know it 's apparently a thing , i really do n't get it . 
  ah , so it does . 
  thanks !, 
  i did n't realise there was such a difference between being unconscious and being prone for other reasons . 
  yeah , if he really * wanted * to get a proper nbn done , he could easily spin the whole thing as being forced by abbott to fuck it up , and now he 's going to be the hero and fix it . 
  it would make him come out looking * better * than if he does nothing at all . 
  that said , i doubt he will . 
  they 're too far down the path already . 
  right , but there 's no good reason for that limitation . 
  the us did n't win the war alone . 
  had they been alone they certainly would have lost , long before they even developed nuclear weapons . 
  the * allies * won the war , with the us being the most significant factor in the pacific , and the uk & soviets being the most significant in europe . 
  are you familiar with the word pantyhose ? 
  ring ? 
  i would be thoroughly confused and not know how to react , on account of not having a doorbell so far as i am aware . 
  historically , they 've only used x when it was a * huge * departure from previous versions . 
  os x , final cut pro x , and quicktime x , for example . 
  contrast with itunes which had a version 10 . 
  [ google came up with this for me ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/419_scams ) . 
  * thanks , i did n't get it from the above comment . 
  you think you had it bad with the nexus 4 ? 
  i could n't get one until 31st * december * , despite trying to get it since the beginning of the month . 
  that was over a * month * from the original release . 
  it was badly managed in the us , but it was * waaay * worse in the rest of the world . 
  holy shit this is amazing !, 
  and it 's less than * 10 * km/h ? 
  that said , i 'm doubtful about uq getting one . 
  as much as i would * love * to have a go on it , do we really * need * one here ? 
  i did n't realise that people not wearing seatbelts was a significant problem here .
