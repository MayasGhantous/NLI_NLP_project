  yeah honestly it 's an absolutely fantastic episode . 
  if it had been made while harmon was still at the helm , and the episode itself was n't any different , people would have loved it . 
  i doubt anyone would have reasonably thought a 12 year old was the one who created it , but my first thoughts definitely went to a highschooler or undergraduate uni student . 
  far too often , the question is n't a duplicate anyway . 
  it 's around a similar topic , but it 's different , and the answer for one situation does n't make sense applied to the second situation .

  unless otherwise specified , if someone says `` vi '' i assume they 're talking about vim . 
  on os x , the command ` vi ` is even automatically aliased to ` vim ` . 
  as far as i 'm aware , the guy was n't hired as an employee of google proper . 
  that is to say , his job would n't have been engineering , or design , or marketing strategy or anything serious like that . 
  he was essentially a retail employee , not a role that would have needed someone with the especially high level of skill google is typically famous for . 
  vimeo is not and * should not become * a real competitor to youtube . 
  their niche is quality artistic content , not vlogs , news programmes , or educational content . 
  i agree with you regarding sorcerer and warlock . 
  they 've obvious good fits . 
  i might say that the cleric is another good fit , particularly a type of cleric that does less up front combat and more support type stuff . 
  * maybe * a wizard if they 're a sort of child prodigy . 
  as others said , rogue works , especially the thief archetype . 
  [ order of operations , dude ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_operations ) . 
  just remember bidmas :, 
  * brackets ( that 's `` parentheses '' if you 're american ), 
  * indices ( aka exponents or orders ), 
  * division, 
  * multiplication, 
  * addition, 
  * subtraction, 
  at least in c ( and derivative languages ) , the value for an `` array '' is actually just a pointer to a spot in memory . 
  the value of the array itself is the value of the memory address of the start of the array . 
  indexing into the array is simply adding to the memory address being referenced an amount that shifts you over that many places * . 
  doing ` array [ i ] ` is the same as ` * ( array + i ) ` . 
  this makes passing arrays around different functions very simple and intuitive . 
  \\* note that the compiler is smart , when doing ` array [ i ] ` , the actual memory address it dereferences for you is ` array + ( i * sizeof ( array [ 0 ] ) ) ` . 
  [ here 's some code that shows examples of each of the above ] ( http://pastebin.com/czjddavf ) . 
  edit : fixed mistake pointed out by zantier . 
  theoretically , i 'm going to guess that they could . 
  i * know * for example that non-integer bases can theoretically exist . 
  ( [ by some metrics , for example , base `` e '' could be considered the most `` efficient '' base . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-integer_representation#base_e ) ), 
  that really is sad :(, 
  beethoven 's 5th has certainly been way overused in popular culture , but i still get great joy out of hearing a good recording of it . 
  unfortunately having heard so many recordings , my preference for styles of playing it are now really specific , so far fewer recordings of it really do anything for me , but the good ones are as great as ever . 
  it 's still my favourite piece of music . 
  glad to know you 're doing okay . 
  your presence has definitely been missed , especially as far as posting interesting news and discussion pieces . 
  but i guess the rest of us will just have to step up our game in that regard !, 
  i really do want to thank you for everything you 've done for this subreddit . 
  i 've had a love for classical music for a long time , but the time when you were a common presence in this subreddit provided some absolutely brilliant conversations , and i saw a number of people having their first introductions to the beautiful world of classical music , which made me really glad to be a part of this community . 
  so thank you for everything you 've done , and i hope life continues to treat you well . 
  that gif makes me think of respighi 's * pines of rome * . 
  god damn it , disney . 
  i love a good `` 4 ' 33 '' joke as much as anyone , but i really do feel that more people need to see this , or read in to the real thoughts behind the piece . 
  because the piece itself is not a joke , it 's actually really wonderful and thought-provoking , if you come to it with the right mindset . 
  surely if you have a router at home ( which these days most people do ) , even the most na\u00efve implementation would not involve going out onto the internet , unless all communication were being done through a central server ( i.e. , unless it was * not * peer-to-peer ) ? 
  when i wrote that line , i was not referring to code that the user could enter to see the result , but merely describing using logic the way to work out what the address will be , so i do n't see the cast as necessary . 
  but you 're definitely right that i should have used ` sizeof ( array [ 0 ] ) ` rather than ` sizeof ( i ) ` , since the latter should always be an ` int ` , but the values in the array may not be . 
  ever heard hugh laurie when he 's not playing an american ? 
  yeah , every time this comes up , i see people saying `` oh , but you 're not supposed to slather it on , you 're meant to spread it really thin '' , and i just think ... well , yeah , that 's great advice for giving it to someone who 's never tasted vegemite before , but if you 're a true blue aussie you had better be slathering it on real thick . 
  butter is essential even for the advanced vegemiter . 
  but yeah , really spread is necessary for newbs . 
  you can work them up to being a true blue aussie with it spread as thick as one might peanut paste or jam or something . 
  when it gets slightly hot over there , there really * is * panic . 
  not about barbecuing , necessarily , but over the heat . 
  i was on holiday in england a few years ago , and the temperature was like 28 degrees , and there were warnings on the train about how you need to make sure you drink a lot of water and keep out of the sun and stuff . 
  fyi , no . 
  this is not the way the words are used outside of america ( and even within america , there is a lack of consistency ) . 
  that 's not to say that america is wrong , of course , because they 're * not * . 
  but it * is * wrong to correct someone and say that the only correct way is the one you described . 
  most aussies do n't eat it at all after the age of like 8 , unless they have younger siblings or children . 
  i 'm fairly sure the british take on indian food is what people in most of the world really * want * when they think of indian food . 
  that 's not how language works , mate . 
  oh god yes . 
  typing things like `` i.e. '', 
  or `` e.g. '', 
  in swiftkey is an awful experience . 
  also , for some reason the `` australia '' layout puts `` pound '' as the primary currency symbol ( the one reached when long pressing from the letter page , or with a short press on the symbol page ) . 
  when someone asked on their forums why this is , they basically said `` deal with it '' . 
  absolutely no good reason for this , it 's just lazy as fuck on their part . 
  i just wish swiftkey could learn things with unusual capitalisation and punctuation . 
  i use `` i.e. '', 
  a lot , but it * refuses * to learn that this is a thing , and makes it impossible to fucking write . 
  `` ios '' is equally difficult to make it do . 
  basically have to write a lower case i , enter that , backspace , capital os . 
   i should not be confused when i look at infographics, 
  i agree, 
   i should not have more questions then i had to begin with, 
  i do n't agree . 
  if the infographic is informing you about something , but it can only * possibly * scratch the surface of whatever it is . 
  if it 's well-made , it 'll give you a good overview , but leave you inquisative enough to want to learn more about its subject matter . 
  but anyway , i do n't see your problem with this infographic . 
  it 's pretty basic , but it 's also really simple and easy to understand . 
  of all children who die under the age of 5 , 80 % die from preventable causes . 
  14 % die of non-communicable diseases . 
  and 6 % die from injury . 
  the only bit of that which could * possibly * be confusing is `` non-communicable diseases '' , which is easy enough to google and find out that it 's diseases like cancers , asthma , and other chronic diseases for which no cure exists . 
  even so , the infographic clearly gets its point across .
