  ** 80 % of children who die under 5 die from preventable causes ** . 
  yeah tb , i think you missed the joke on that one . 
  the timing is off ? 
  compared to what , exactly ? 
  present, 
  oh totally , i 'll have it if it 's offered . 
  but i do n't run into the situation where it 's on offer very much . 
  true , in general . 
  but op is specifically looking to get the largest number for their ac , purely as a theoretical exercise , so disadvantage is worthless . 
  some older games used the cpu 's clock speed as a timer in the game . 
  when computers got faster , the games became unplayable . 
  turbo buttons would slow down the cpu to make the experience more like the one the game was designed for . 
  well , largely i suspect because countries civilised enough to care about having the most humane form of execution also recognise that what is essentially state-sponsored murder is * inherently * inhumane , regardless of the method . 
  that fact is kinda misleading , but i think it 's also misleading to * say * that it 's misleading . 
  yes , it 's expensive because of all the retrials . 
  but those retrials are ** absolutely essential ** . 
  because if you 're going to be taking someone 's life , there is * no * extent that is too far to make sure that they 're actually guilty of the thing you 're killing them for . 
  ( though really , just abolishing the thing entirely would be a wiser and more humane course of action . ), 
  just opened firefox to have a look , and yeah , looks like they do n't support it . 
  safari does n't , either , or internet explorer . 
  it 's a feature chrome has in its standard right click menu on html5 video tags , it 's not just a youtube thing , along with the more standard ones shared by other browsers like mute , pause , and get video url . 
  oh , he was talking about screen refresh times ? 
  i thought he meant try playing skyrim with a 144 hz processor , which was just a ridiculous notion . 
  but anyway , if you 're gon na pick * one * common framerate to be divisible by , i 'd say 24 is the best one to go with . 
  i mean , if you could be divisible by both 24 and 25 that 'd be even better , and if you can add 30 to the mix that 's better again , but if you 've got ta pick one , might as well go with the cinematic standard rather than tv quality . 
  this is * so * important . 
  people are sick of all this god damn negative campaigning . 
  * both * major parties are focussing their campaigning on criticising everything the other party does ( that they perceive as ) wrong . 
  i just wan na see them start focussing on all the good stuff that they wan na do for the country . 
  personally i 'm more into the revenge gig with my sacrifices . 
  i tend to go for bitchy old women who believe games are the devil . 
   and burned them while crying and mumbling all sorts of jibberish, 
  are you sure * she * was n't the satanist ? 
  and this was part of her ritual ? 
  dual monitors ? 
  try three monitors ( where one of them is running on a different machine and a different operating system ) . 
  that 's the * real * master race !, 
  i 'm curious , you keep saying `` maths studies '' . 
  you would n't happen to be doing ib , would you ? 
  i do n't know craigslist terminology ( it 's not been a thing anywhere i 've lived ) , so i 'm just going to assume the `` ce '' section is the `` chaotic evil '' section . 
  the idea amuses me . 
  well , i was half being funny . 
  obviously it did n't actually stand for chaotic evil , but i had no idea what it * did * stand for , since craigslist is n't a thing here , so i 've never been on it . 
  thanks for the info , though . 
  [ not according to its revision history , it did n't ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9rb3bn2.png ) . 
  the page was created in 2008 , according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weeping_angel ) , weeping angels first appeared in 2007 . 
  not that i 'm saying it 's a rip-off . 
  i 've never seen that episode of dr. who ( in fact , i 've only seen one or two of the revived episodes ) , and i only skimmed the item 's description . 
  so i am definitely not qualified to make a judgement on that either way . 
  the whole website , or this particular entry , which is the 173rd entry on the site ? 
  so was i. . . 
   by the way , if you 're visiting as a tourist it 's a good idea to have travel insurance no matter where you go . 
  this is definitely true . 
  but here 's the thing , it 's expensive in america . 
  my parents ' employer provides them and my sister ( who 's still at school -- they also provided it for me while i was there ) with insurance absolutely anywhere in the world -- * except * for the united states . 
  because the cost to provide that as well would have been unjustifiably high . 
  no country in the developed world whose politics i follow ( primarily the anglosphere ) is anywhere near as bad as the us . 
  america has a system where it is very easy for people to be prevented from voting . 
  the 2000 election on florida was probably the best example of this , with stories about black people ( who are well-known for largely voting democrat ) being unable to vote . 
  additionally , it seems like gerrymandering is much more of a problem in america than other places . 
  the voting system used in my county 's lower house is in theory susceptible to gerrymandering , but electoral districts are set by an independent body that really is independent and trusted . 
  i 've never even heard any * allegations * of corruption . 
  our upper house uses a system that is not even susceptible . 
  in the us , as far as i 'm aware congress itself has a say in redistricting , and thus they are able to gerrymander the electorates substantially . 
  and so one hears about how gerrymandered they have become on a regular basis . 
  wow that 's really interesting . 
  it 's actually about half of what i pay in the green lands of not-america . 
  but i 'm curious , how well regarded is you university ? 
  mine 's a top 50 worldwide , and top 5 within my country . 
  my impression has always been that in america , anything * close * to well regarded is looking at upwards of 20 thousand per year . 
  i 'd genuinely be interested to know if that 's wrong . 
  ah , that 's true . 
  thanks for that . 
  i did n't bother running the maths beforehand . 
  wait , mount & blade works on os x ? 
  i had no idea . 
  by the way , you might like to join us at / r/macgaming for more discussion about this point . 
  normally i 'd agree , but for gaming , i 'm not so sure . 
  games take up a * heap * of space , and ssds of any reasonable size are stupendously expensive . 
  more reasonably priced ones are tiny . 
  if you 're referring to the way the electoral college works , that 's irrelevant . 
  i 'm talking about the way districts are laid out in congress , not the way elections for president take place . 
   half of the australians on here did n't even know she is bronwyn 's daughter, 
  well , to be fair , the video did n't have her name anywhere on it ( at least that i saw ) , so there 's no reason for us to have made the connection . 
  i guess they look * vaguely * similar ? 
   and i 'm not british , i meant a scientist chemist , but i like formulations work, 
  i 'm confused , do you think only british people also use the word `` chemist '' to refer to someone who works at a chemist ? 
  ( i.e. , someone whose job it is to sell pharmaceuticals ), 
  mr speaker , i want to say that i agree with this in principle , but i believe further consultation is necessary before it is brought before the house . 
  i will say , however , that i * especially * like clause 5 . 
  i think a community awareness campaign would be an incredibly helpful part of any significant potential change in the demographic make up of any part of the population . 
  it could hopefully help with some of the racism and intollerance that these people might otherwise have to face . 
  is it a scholarship or grant or something ? 
  if so then yeah , that does happen anywhere in the world , but it 's not generally the majority experience . 
  if it 's something else , i 'm curious to hear what exactly it is . 
  i thought it 's supposed to cause the crash when you just * hover * over the link ? 
  at least , that 's what it did for me ... 
  i did n't drag it into the browser , or copy-paste , or click the link . 
  weirdly , for me , this crashes the whole browser in windows ( running win 8.1 with 4 gb ram , of which task manager claims just under 50 % is being utilised ) , but only crashes the one tab in os x ( running 10.10 with 8 gb ram ) . 
  i do n't know if it 's the way chrome has been programmed differently on each os , if if it 's something to do with the operating system itself , or simply a matter of the extra memory allowing chrome to work in its most optimal way .
