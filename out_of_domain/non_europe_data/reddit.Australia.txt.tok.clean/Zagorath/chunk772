  weirdly , for me , this crashes the whole browser in windows ( running win 8.1 with 4 gb ram , of which task manager claims just under 50 % is being utilised ) , but only crashes the one tab in os x ( running 10.10 with 8 gb ram ) . 
  i do n't know if it 's the way chrome has been programmed differently on each os , if if it 's something to do with the operating system itself , or simply a matter of the extra memory allowing chrome to work in its most optimal way .

   you 're making a mountain out of a molehill,

  i was just making a comment on the reason that many people would n't have known . 
  chill out . 
  i ca n't find any option to * not * run in a sandbox , and i do n't remember ever taking it out of sandbox before , so i assume mine 's still in sandbox mode . 
  does n't work for me . 
  your comment is apparently controversial , but this is really fucking true . 
  google is absolutely * notorious * for having region restrictions on stuff that ** makes no fucking sense ** to have region restrictions , like this . 
  holy shit that 's a lot of money . 
  i pay $ 11 per month for my phone plan ... 
  i know that plans around the range of $ 60-90 are not enormously uncommon where i live , but $ 125, 
  not for me , hovering is enough to crash the browser on my windows computer . 
  no idea . 
  i find most of the `` reporters '' on morning news programmes ( and on entertainment news in general , to a lesser extent ) are similarly inane . 
  they 're teachers at an international school . 
  it probably does n't help that right now there 's ( as far as i 'm aware ) literally only * one * scroll that * is n't * a spell scroll . 
  if they had put a handful of different examples of scrolls that * are n't * spell scrolls in the dmg , that may have helped reduce the confusion to some extent . 
  yeah i 'm the same . 
  additionally , `` hehe '' or similar for laughing at something that 's not quite so much funny as clever . 
   two years before the accepted start of wwii, 
  this is true , but there is * some * ( not a * lot * , but * some * ) argument that the start of world war ii should perhaps be recognised as either earlier , when japan started invading manchuria , which was the first start of conflict that was later on a part of the big worldwide war ; or later , when america joined the war after pearl harbour , marking the time it became a truly * global * conflict , joining the east and west . 
  i do n't necessarily agree with those arguments , but it 's certainly not unreasonable . 
  i 'm not entirely sure . 
  i like what it 's trying to do , but it creates the unusual situation where someone can do it once in late december , and then again in early january , and see no special repercussions . 
  on the other hand , if someone committed it the first time in early january , and went nearly an entire year without doing anything wrong , before commiting it again late december , they * would * be facing the more serious repercussions . 
  instead , i would rather see a rolling buffer of a six month period , since that is a fixed period of time , equal to the average amount of time it would last under the current recommendation . 
  * meta : do n't know if this is the right place for it , someone let me know where a better place is if there is one . 
  i move that the committee amend / u/3fun 's proposed recommendations in the following ways :, 
  ( ii ) omit `` during the same calendar year '' , substitute `` within six months from the first occasion '' ; and, 
  ( iii ) omit `` during the same calendar year '' , substitute `` within six months from the first occasion '' . 
  leader of the house, 
  for example : every large telco or isp ever . 
   point out one tax advantage that was n't explicitly passed into law . 
  if you can not , do n't down vote . 
  well , tax structures were nearly always set up without full consideration of how modern globalised companies do business . 
  this makes it easy for companies to exploit `` holes '' that were certainly put in there for some purpose that was deemed beneficial at the time , but today , when companies can basically not exist in a country that they 're selling to , or can easily be registered for tax purposes in a different country to where they are headquartered , it 's a clear flaw in the tax system . 
  for example , apple , google , and microsoft are famous for doing this . 
  they structure themselves so that they pay tax primarily in ireland and singapore , and a fair amount in the us , but manage to avoid the vast majority around the rest of the world . 
  this is clearly what people are talking about when they say `` tax loophole '' . 
  and , for what it 's worth , i absolutely do * not * blame the companies for exploiting it . 
  especially public companies , they need to do whatever they can within the law to maintain profit and stay competitive . 
  and minimising taxation is a good way to do that , since it does n't harm customers or employees . 
  no , the blame lies with politicians , who need to * close * those loopholes . 
  this is not true . 
  yes , they * do * allow companies to pay to be included in the default white-list , but they also validate that those ones at least meet certain reasonable criteria . 
  entrapment , certainly not . 
  that 's a very particular type of law unrelated to self-defense entirely . 
  it 's when an officer of the law coerces you into doing something illegal which you otherwise would not have done . 
  self-defense does seem fairly reasonable , but i would guess legally it is * not * warranted in this case . 
  wow , that 's really impressive . 
  does n't seem like it 'd be an easy piece to do it with , either . 
  seems like some fairly technical tonguing that 'd be hard to sync with the fingering . 
   why would apple or google pay us tax on earnings not made in the united states ? 
  that 's not the problem . 
  in fact , it 's perfectly reasonable if they do pay a little us tax on earnings outside the us , on account of all the development taking place there . 
  the problem is that they * do n't * pay a reasonable amount of tax either here in australia , or in america , or basically nearly anywhere . 
  instead , they funnel the profits through ireland and singapore ( which , for what it 's worth , are both countries that they do n't have even a single apple store in ) by having local distributors `` purchase '' the products from `` affiliates '' in ireland and singapore . 
  so , on paper , the local apple appears to make very little profit in the country , while in fact they are making rather a lot . 
  here are a couple of news stories that explain what 's going on :,

  i do n't pay anything to the irs , because as i 've already specified , i 'm not american . 
  and , if you go back and re-read ( or , perhaps , * fully * read for the first time ) my first comment , you 'll have seen my response to the spirit of this comment . 
  is there someone helping him with this ? 
  i did n't learn the word `` juke '' until i had been playing for a few weeks . 
  oh interesting . 
  where is that ? 
  queensland . 
  i had never heard it before playing tagpro . 
  oh , also , for what it 's worth , i was using the word `` exploit '' here in a purely technical sense , without invoking the negative connotations it can have in other contexts . 
  haha that is brilliant . 
  the only bit that i do n't get is `` insular '' . 
  i thought the aussie stereotype was that they 're * really * outgoing , very much * not * the sort to keep to themselves and be insular . 
  the rest of it fits perfectly , though . 
   nothing but a good experience, 
  well , from a `` you get what you were expecting to get for good prices '' perspective , definitely . 
  great experience . 
  but the actual experience of browsing their site and buying stuff is so far from what i 'd call `` a good experience '' it 's not funny . 
  can you not just pay by card each time you purchase a drink , exactly as you would with cash ? 
  you know the people that dislike tipping do n't actually want to stop you doing that , right ? 
  if society decided to pay waiters properly , and remove the culturally-compulsory tipping , you could still give some tip for especially good service . 
  there should not be a `` baseline '' tip . 
  the baseline should be zero , and you can choose to give more if you wish . 
  this argument also works for tax , by the way . 
  maccas already makes different signs and labels for all the 119 different countries they 're in . 
  and besides , prices * already * are n't the same everywhere * within a country * . 
  so there 's no reason that adjusting for one more factor would be a problem . 
  wages are already different in different places , as are property prices , non-consumer facing taxes ( i.e. , any tax they have to pay * apart * from sales tax ) , and even amount of traffic the stores get . 
  all this is already factored in to their pricing , so there is no good reason that they could not include the price of sales tax in the price displayed in stores or in advertising . 
  ( hell , the latter could be solved by simply saying `` prices * from * '' . ), 
  nobody ever mentions red rooster :(, 
  by far the best chips of all the fast food restaurants . 
  no idea how they stay in business , though , i 've never seen one with more than like one customer in it .
