  with how expensive the fares have gotten , and how rare getting checked is , i wonder if the amortised cost might actually be * less * if you pay the fine whenever you get caught . 
  but i 'm too much of a goody two shoes to actually try it out . 
  hell , i bought an adult go card for a single train trip while i did n't have my second ttcc after my first expired . 
  in particular , some of the best stories can be found in the [ dndgreentext hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  there 's a van gogh guy here on reddit ? 
  yes , that 's what that is . 
  ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ feed ^ ^ the ^ ^ trolls !, 
  yeah , it 's something that could be a part of any parliamentary/representative system . 
  not westminster specifically . 
  hell , the uk has this problem to a * much * lesser degree than we do , and they * invented * the system . 
  amusingly , this means that the decisions of parliament , or at least the lower house , can be decided on the basis ( in theory ) of just over a mere 12.5 % of the australian population . 
  you need just over 50 % of the population in just over half the seats to form a majority government . 
  that 's 25 % . 
  then you only need half of * that * to get the majority opinion within the party . 
  huntology ? 
  this is grossly unfair . 
  i know plenty of people around my age who are not fully accepting of the scientific and social consensus around issues like climate change . 
  i also know plenty of people from my parents ' generation who * do * accept the facts . 
  besides , `` issues being debated today are merely generation based '' is just not true . 
  even if we accept that many of the hot-button issues like climate change and marriage equality have a significant age factor , there 's a certain degree of wisdom that comes from experience in other , less sexy issues that need to be solved . 
  just a tip , if he responds to this , do n't bother responding again . 
  it 's really not worth your effort dealing with trolls . 
  you just used pleonasm as a verb . 
  at least according to [ my quick dictionary look up ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pleonasm ) , it 's not a verb . 
  i do n't get it ... 
  what does a copper piece have to do with detect thoughts , exactly ? 
  what makes that so punny ? 
   pennies are made out of copper, 
  ah , right . 
  this is the bit i did n't know . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : out of curiosity , i looked it up . 
  turns out it 's not * quite * true . 
  whether you 're talking about the [ british penny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penny_ ( british_decimal_coin \\ ) ) or the [ 1c american coin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/penny_ ( united_states_coin \\ ) ) , it 's only copper plated . 
  the majority of the coin is steel , in the case of the british coin , and zinc in the case of the american one . 
  out of interest , the ( now long defunct ) [ australian 1c coin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_two-cent_coin ) * was * mostly made of copper . 
  though it was never called a penny , so it loses in that respect . 
  oh lol , yeah that was dumb , total mental blank . 
  but dude , have you ever heard of a little something called respect ? 
  you are allowed to be polite to other people , you know ? 
  anyway , mobile numbers are longer than the ssn . 
  so either way , it 's not all of them . 
  right , but what 's the joke referencing ? 
  this may not be the subreddit for you , then . 
  my best guess is that by undercover she means off duty . 
  are mobile numbers in america not 10 digits long ? 
  i assumed they were the same anywhere . 
  if you feel my initial comment was disrespectful , well then i appologise , but i can not see which part of it came across that way . 
  all i did was point out where you were wrong and why . 
  that is not ipso facto disrespectful . 
  on the other hand `` asshat '' certainly is .

  after the number of times i 've seen this posted in comments , i 'm surprised it has n't been shared as a link before . 
  not that i mind , it 's awesome . 
  the only thing i wish is that google now could have some of the personality of siri . 
  things like her response to `` where can i bury a body '' or `` tell me a joke '' would be nice to have on android . 
   it is server side , google does all their voice recognition on their servers . 
  my guess is that the biggest exception to this is `` okay , google '' , which is always recognised locally . 
  haha this is hilarious . 
  after they all surround the downed body , ** fireball ** murdering them all , at cost of also killing your friend . 
  meta : so , a vote of 1 aye 2 aye would be to accept 3fun 's amendment after my modifications, 
  1 aye 2 no would be accept 3fun 's amendment as they wrote it, 
  1 no 2 no would be to refuse it entirely, 
  1 no 2 aye would be nonsensical, 
  is that correct ? 
  yeah do n't do that . 
  green man gaming is shit . 
  their region restrictions are way worse than steam 's . 
  just trying to * buy * a game from them if you do n't happen to be in a place that they have specifically seen fit to bless is impossible . 
  fuck that shit , they have no idea how a business should function in today 's globalised world . 
  steam , gog , and humble bundle are way better choices . 
  well yeah , if it has to be a zero-sum game , google now is definitely the better choice . 
  but there 's no reason it has to be like that . 
  it 's about more than just the specific examples i gave there . 
  just having a little more personality would make it feel much more natural to interact with , and would improve the experience . 
  pinging / u/3fun and / u/madcreek3 , in case this applies to you . 
  yeah that makes sense . 
  [ and here 's a version of the above link that does n't look like shit on desktop operating systems ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 3emaj5/the _ saga_of_guard_one_part_1 / ) . 
  what did i just watch . . ? 
  he fudged the roll in the * opposite * direction . 
  the goblin was organically just super strong , so he fudged a roll that made it slightly less extreme . 
  i do n't know if they still are , but at least originally ( as in , when apple 's siri first started , not just before apple acquired them ) i 'm pretty sure siri used nuance 's voice recognition . 
  in theory , that * should * mean that they 'd get way better results , since nuance has been at this game way longer than anyone else , and were the clear market leaders in the area . 
  even for native english speakers , `` okay google '' is definitely a mouthful , and i wish we could set our own recognition phrases . 
  but it does have one very good advantage , and that 's that it 's * very * unlikely to get accidentally triggered . 
  siri can fairly easily get accidentally triggered by people saying things that have nothing to do with it , but because of how complicated `` ok google '' is , that 's much less likely to happen . 
   tho i wish they would implement this voice recognition to the android auto as it sucks balls, 
  this is a common problem at google . 
  for some reason , they just can not get their shit together when it comes to integrating stuff . 
  you know how google docs can now do simultaneous live editing of documents ? 
  google wave was the first product to be able to do that , and yet when they put that functionality into docs , they did n't borrow any of wave 's code , and did it completely new . 
  a * heap * of great google services are just entirely not available to google apps customers . 
  not to mention the sheer number of things that are region-locked to only the united states * without good reason * . 
  yes there are some things ( stuff that handles money , especially ) that make sense to be region-locked , but so often things are only available over there without good reason . 
  yeah seriously . 
  it was insane what the refs let the roosters get away with . 
  and damn / u/thelilrat has the gall to call it `` milking '' when the broncos were complaining about it . 
  are you even watching the same game , mate ? 
  i dunno , at least to me , `` milking '' implies that it was n't really strongly justified . 
  at least in my eyes , the broncos ' complaints about the tackles early on last half * was * completely justified .
