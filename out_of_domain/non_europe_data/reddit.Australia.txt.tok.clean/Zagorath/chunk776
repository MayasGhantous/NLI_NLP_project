  do the broncos milk things sometimes ? 
  i dunno , probably . 
  everyone probably does it to some extent . 
  my main problem was that your example was a really bad one . 
  and honestly , i usually ignore most of the absolutist statements the commentators make . 
  it 's nearly always just bullshitting to fill the silence . 
  no point arguing about it really . 
  yeah so did i. 
  ca n't say i 'm not * happy * that the video ref decided to give it no try , as a broncos supporter , but i do n't really think i * agree * with it . 
  i just feel the commentators are often so full of shit it 's basically low hanging fruit . 
  not even worth the effort it takes to refute them . 
  especially gould . 
  there are n't ? 
  that 's a shame . 
  i went on a tour of the cadbury factory in birmingham when i was there on holiday , and it was really cool . 
  honestly i 'd start the `` decent cities '' further south . 
  there 's nothing `` decent '' in northern nsw . 
  of the teams left , i would only consider the storm `` evil '' . 
  i ca n't see any reason to call brisbane or north queensland evil teams ... 
  ^ ( dude , check the post history of the guy you replied to . 
  they are themselves one of these `` salty fuccbois '' , as you so eloquently put it . ), 
  yeah , my desktop was good ( but not great ) back in 2010 . 
  it 's only just in the last 12 months or so that i 'm feeling the need to upgrade it to get decent performance out of the games i want to play . 
  being a patient gamer really does save you so much on hardware costs . 
   you should watch your mouth , boy . 
  when spoken , you would never put a pause there . 
  huh ? 
  yes you would ... at least , i would . 
  and , just by the way , `` e.g. '', 
  should basically always be followed by a comma , e.g. , like this . 
  they were level 7 susceptibles . 
  really ? 
  that 's bizarre . 
  i ca n't even give my phone to my sister and get it to work for her when she * does * say `` ok google '' . 
  the thing has actual voice recognition in it . 
   source : been here much longer than i am comfortably admitting, 
  4 years , 1 month , and 14 days , to be precise . 
  which one ? 
  theoden 's `` death '' speech , before entering into the battle of pelennor fields , or aragorn 's speech to the men of the west at the black gate ? 
   run on the opposite side to the side you drive on in your country and be generally more careful, 
  ftfy, 
  exactly . 
  my point was that you said `` left '' , which is fine advice in america and other places that drive on the right , but not in the uk or australia , or other places that drive on the left . 
  my comment makes it valid * anywhere * in the world . 
  better to change their systems to 64-bit integers . 
  unsigned 32-bit would give you double the time as compared to 32-bit signed . 
  64-bit signed gives you times 2 ^ 32 compared to 32-bit signed . 
  just a tip , the phrase is `` per se '' . 
  emojis * are * unicode characters . 
  they 're just a particular subset of unicode . 
  unicode actually has a cool workaround for different skin colours . 
  essentially , they have the generic `` unraced '' normal character , and then some sort of `` race modifiers '' that get joined together using what 's called a `` zero-width joiner '' , to create the desired race . 
  ( note , i 'm using `` unraced '' and `` race modifiers '' as general terms , i do n't know what their official name is , if there even is one . 
  zero width joiner , on the other hand , is the technical name for it . ), 
  at least according to [ this link ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-09-25/afl-live-streaming-updates/6804210 ) , the game took place at subiaco oval , which according to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subiaco_oval ) is in perth . 
  so western australian law would be the one to apply , would it not ? 
  ( i could be wrong about any of those steps . 
  i do n't follow the afl , so it was based on a very brief set of google searches . ), 
  not just tricking a person , though . 
  there are two types of content that belong here : one is the sort of tricking that you described , the other is when things appear to be going wrong , but the person recovers in a smooth way . 
  for example that gif of the guy falling off his treadmill , and recovering into pushups . 
  have you made sure gatekeeper is n't the problem ? 
  perhaps a better example ( because , as you say , there was a hell of a lot of makeup on her in hook specifically to make her look older ) would be to compare [ philosopher 's stone ] ( http://www.hotflick.net/flicks/2001_harry_potter_and_the_sorcerer_s_stone/big/fhd001hpo_maggie_smith_003.jpg ) ( 2001 ) with [ deathly hallows part 2 ] ( http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/showbiz/07/15/omg.squee.hpatdh2/t1larg.squee.jpg ) ( 2011 ) . 
  that 's a 10 year difference with virtually no change on screen . 
  not exactly . 
  slippery slope is a fallacy of you use it to support your own argument ( which this guy did , implicitly ) , and you have n't explicitly established that every step on this slope is inevitable ( as this guy had not ) . 
  so their usage * was * , a case of the slippery slope fallacy . 
  the fallacy fallacy is a little misleading . 
  simply pointing out that someone made a fallacious argument is not a fallacy . 
  the fallacy is saying `` you used a fallacy , therefore your stance in this argument is wrong '' . 
  if you simply use it to say `` you used a fallacy , therefore any deduction you made from that argument can be dismissed as not useful '' , then it 's fine . 
  it 's a very thin line , but it 's important to recognise the difference . 
  i do n't think she was ever called that on screen in earlier movies , people just assumed that she was the black girl . 
  and i believe in the books she 's described as being light skinned . 
  formatted even better :, 
   be a half-elf rogue , curved elf blade and rapier fighter, 
   one shot session in a labrynth , start at level 5 with 5000gp, 
   buy all the shit i 'll possibly need , have money left over so i buy random potions, 
   jumping potion and reduce person potion , plus two cure light wounds, 
   later on i 'm fighting my doppelganger in the labrynth , the walls and ceiling are spiked, 
   get disarmed by my doppelganger and through crit fails, 
   throw pocketsand into his face, 
   he 's blinded, 
   throw jumping potion at him, 
   he flies into the air , gets impaled on spikes , dies instantly, 
   then i hear the footsteps of the dm 's pet minotaur, 
   dm cackles with glee , i 'm about to get splattered by this charging minotaur, 
   throw my reduce person potion at it, 
   shrinks to the size of a rugby ball , armour and axe stay the same size and fall away, 
   it 's dazed and confused, 
   i sieze the oppurtunity, 
   goomba stomp it , breaking its horn, 
   land back on my feet, 
   punt that fucker 20 yards, 
   sails off into the distance and hits the spikes , somehow survives, 
   tfw just dropkicked the dms pet, 
  i suggest you have a read of our [ style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for how best to post greentext style comments in this subreddit . 
   as the existence of a slippery slope was his argument and not an element of it, 
  as i said in my reply to your previous comment , this is not true . 
  yes , all the guy * explicitly * said was `` this is a slippery slope '' , so a naive reading of the comment might come to the conclusion that the existence of a slippery slope was all he was arguing .
