  but clearly , there was an implied argument of `` and therefore this should not happen '' . 
  that 's where the fallacy comes in . 
  here 's a non-mobile version , because clicking next to the `` m '' and then pressing `` backspace '' twice is not hard , even on a phone :, 
  would it not be better to show both separately , rather than replacing one with the other ? 
  i was about to `` correct '' your os x screenshot until i came to the comments and saw that you had already been corrected in the * opposite * direction . 
  plastic bags around the outside of your shoes , maybe ? 
  with an elastic band just above your ankles ? 
  i dunno , probably a terrible idea . 
  and not even a 3 year old account , too !, 
  my friend 's mum went through the same , though she lives in vietnam , so they were a little behind on that kind of thing . 
  but even so , that 's only one generation back . 
   slightly - not quite a full octave , as far as i know, 
  fwiw , i doubt many people lower or raise their voice by an octave when talking to * anyone * . 
  a full octave is literally double the frequency of their voice ( or half it , if going down ) . 
  it 's just an expression that gets used to say that they 've raised/lowered their voice by `` a lot '' . 
  i somehow got lice earlier this year , no idea how . 
  they 're easy enough to remove on your own . 
  just go to a chemist and buy some headlice removal chemicals , and follow the instructions . 
  especially useful if the box the lice shampoo comes in also contains a lice comb . 
  haha , who 's the genius that made ordered lists count from 0 in this subreddit ? 
  i love it . 
  i floss at my computer desk , which has a bin within arm 's reach of it . 
  [ my result is mostly apple stuff ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8isvqw4.png ) . 
  uhh ... no ? 
  i do n't generally fire a lot of spit all over the place when flossing . 
  do you ? 
  and in that case , you 're ripping off all the countless sites that you visit once through google , and which were helpful that once , but you probably wo n't be returning to them . 
  no , the only ethical adblocking method is through * blacklisting * , which unfortunately none of the major adblockers support properly ( adblock , ab + , ublock , and ublock origin all have a method of doing it in theory , but they do n't work properly ) . 
  most of the sites you visit , it allows by default , but when you get to a particularly bad one ( e.g. , news sites that autoplay video over what is meant to be * text * content ) , you can block it and get rid of ads on known-bad sites . 
  by best guess is that apple pays more for advertising in australia than it does wherever you are . 
  edit : lol , just noticed telstra seems to have gained one follower on g + between the taking of those two screenshots . 
  this is why you always use braces , even for single-line consequents or alternatives . 
  or if you 're on mobile . 
  i do n't think either of your examples are good analogies . 
  tv ads , radio ads , and even ads in podcasts are all impossible for advertisers to record details . 
  they have no way of knowing if you 've skipped them , or stopped watching , or whatever . 
  a traveling salesman or telemarketers are impossing themselves in your life without offering anything in return ( other than just the product that they are advertising , which obviously does n't count , since that 's what advertising * is * ) . 
  with online advertising , they can very easily track whether or not the ad has been viewed . 
  the website using ads is serving you up with content regardless of whether or not you view the ad , so you 're costing them bandwidth either way , and you 're benefitting from being able to consume the content . 
  all without contributing to the revenue for that site , since the revenue is directly related to the number of impressions . 
   there has to be a duty on advertisers to respect the viewer if there is a duty on viewers to invite the advertiser in, 
  i agree with this entirely , which is why i do n't have any problem with blacklisting . 
  if a particular advertisor has shown itself to not respect those it is serving ads to , it deserves to be blocked . 
  but any given site should be given the * chance * , by default , to show respect . 
  blocking all ads , or even whitelisting , is not giving this chance to far too many sites . 
  i have the local ips of a bunch of devices on my network memorised ( the majority of them i have set statically ) , but i 've got no idea what the last 24 bits of my public ip are . 
  then again , i 've only had it for 8 months or so , not a few years , so maybe it 'll come in time . 
  just so you 're aware , this image ( at least seems as though it ) gives away your first name , and also quite likely the city you live in , or at least a major city near you . 
  also are n't they meant to not appear in photos or something ? 
  party happens to be in the same area for some reason ( what that reason is does n't really matter , i 've had them all travelling in a cart to the same destination for personal reasons , or them standing in a city square observing some public event , for a couple of examples ) and then start the thing * in media res * with some form of combat that forces them to work together . 
  maybe it 's a goblin ambush on the road , or a bunch of pickpockets or something . 
  preferably something tied at least loosely to the themes of the main campaign . 
  i have a feeling that if turnbull wins at the next election ( which , in all honesty , he likely will ) , we 'll be seeing far fewer people claiming `` i never voted for them '' when they actually did . 
  the policies have n't changed very much from abbott . 
  they 're still just as myopic and harmful . 
  but at least he 's not an international embarrasment like tony was , and those more economically conservative minded are probably actually happy with what he 's doing , whereas with abbott , even conservatives were embarrassed . 
  i also have a phone line bundled with my internet , and i 've never received calls . 
  actually , come to think of it , i 'm not even sure it really works properly ... 
   and this is coming from an american . 
  i dunno , australia has universal healthcare and universities that are reasonably priced ( about $ 4000 per semester at top universities ) , with the ability to get zero - ( real ) - interest loans from the government if you ca n't pay it upfront . 
  the current australian government is pretty terrible , but on the whole , i think i 'd much rather australia 's government than america 's . 
   i also did n't actually accuse that person of using the fallacy . 
  i only pointed out its existence . 
  no , you said ,, 
   calling someone 's argument wrong because they used a fallacy is also a logical fallacy, 
  which is incorrect . 
  by definition , a fallacious argument is wrong . 
  it might reach the correct conclusion , but the argument itself is wrong . 
  on the other hand , the dm who ran [ star wars ] ( http://darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html ) was really good at improvising and keeping the group going smoothly . 
  you should never , ** ever ** be allowed to roll for stats without at least the dm present . 
  the best way would be to have everyone roll up stats at the start of the first session , so everyone can see that everyone else did it fairly . 
  you make it a standard general rule which applies to * everyone * . 
  * no exceptions * . 
  and then there ca n't be any reason for complaining about a lack of trust . 
  when i rolled up my current character , i got insanely good rolls . 
  personally , that did n't seem fun to me , so with the dm 's permisison i took that , but dropped the 12 and one of the 13s to 8 and 10 , respectively . 
  i also put that 17 ( 18 after racial bonuses ) in intelligence , despite it being the all-around ideal dump stat , and my character * not * being a wizard . 
  point being , insanely good rolls * do * happen , but if you make everyone roll in public , you 'll know no cheating happened . 
  additionally , when i dm , i like to have a rule of thumb that says you re-roll if you did n't get a total of between +2 and +5 overall , before racial bonuses ( my native roll would have been +11 , and instead was +6 after dropping those two down , just for reference ) . 
   `` roll for stats '' always seems to mean `` choose good stats and say you rolled it '', 
  this is why there should ** always ** be a requirement that you roll for stats in front of * at least * the dm , and preferably the entire group ( at the first session of the campaign , or at the table after your previous character dies ) . 
  make it a general rule that applies to everyone , and then nobody can whinge about not being trusted . 
  i find it odd that you put `` liquorice '' and `` black liquorice '' . 
  to me , without a colour specified , `` liquorice '' implies that you 're talking about black liquorice . 
  if you meant to say red liquorice , you would specify . 
  yeah ? 
  well , your mother smelt of elderberries !, 
  i think it 's only liquorice in the way white chocolate is chocolate . 
  i could be wrong , but my reading of that article is n't that it 's a special species called the `` queensland crow '' , but that it 's normal crows in queensland . 
  probably the torresian crow , which is the most common one throughout queensland . 
  i 'm pretty sure vampires do n't show up in photos , either , so the mirror would be unnecessary . 
  op did say :, 
   this is an above average asking price even for shows that air on the big networks, 
  i have no idea if it 's true , but if it is , then surely that * does * say something about supergirl specifically , since it 's above the average that one would expect on its channel anyway . 
   spellcards are for rich people !, 
  this looks like it 'd be * more * expensive than spell cards ... 
  the way i 've done it is :, 
  * take a template i found online , enter the information into them ( i can get 8 to an a4 sheet on the one i 've used , though i 've seen other templates with as many as 10 to a sheet ), 
  * print that out, 
  * rip the back off spare notebooks i 've got lieing around,
