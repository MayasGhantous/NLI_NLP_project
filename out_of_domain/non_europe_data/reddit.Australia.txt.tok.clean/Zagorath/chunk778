  * glue the sheet of paper to one side of the notebook ( so i can get a total of 16 spells per notebook cover ), 
  * cut into handy little spells, 
  all without needing to get someone to do fancy binding and stuff . 
  that 's not to take away from this . 
  i think what you 've done is ** way cooler ** . 
  but it 's clearly not the * cheaper * option . 
   also , wotc has put out some eberron material already right ? 
  not really . 
  there 's the eberron unearthed arcana , but it was the first one released ( or maybe the second , i 'm not sure ) , and it was * really * rough . 
  it 's also just player options , not much about the lore of the setting . 
  there are a handful of brief mentions of eberron in the dmg , in relation to a few specific aspects of the world , but they are * very * general and not especially useful for someone not already at least vaguely familiar with the setting . 
  seriously , this does n't make sense . 
  lefties bump against the binder on the right page , righties bump it on the left page . 
  either way , you 're having a problem half the time . 
  ah fair enough . 
  yes , that probably would be a little cheaper . 
   then again , i 'm one of those weirdos who thinks the reboot and into darkness are decent star wars movies but shitty star trek movies , so take that as you will, 
  is this not the majority opinion ? 
  i do n't think i 've seen * anyone * who liked one of the older tv shows that also thinks the abrams trek movies are good as trek movies . 
  that said , i am super excited for star wars episode vii , because i did think abrams did a great job of making an action movie in space . 
  just not a great science fiction movie . 
   but besides its first season, 
  really ? 
  the majority opinion on / r/thelastairbender , at least around the time i unsubscribed , shortly after the end of the final season , seemed to be that season 3 was by far the best as a whole season , with episodes 7 and 8 of season 2 ( beginnings , parts 1 and 2 ) being the best individual episodes . 
  but definitely , outside of [ some small subset of the whole show ] ( i would say , apart from beginnings ) , it does n't compare at all to the original . 
  apart from episodes 7 and 8 of season 2 , which are the best of the whole series !, 
  it 's called an ellipsis , for what it 's worth . 
  i do n't see why we ca n't just continue to call it the arrowverse . 
  rolls off the tongue much more easily , it 's familiar to everyone here , and it pays a nice homage to the origin of the universe in arrow . 
  i 've never had a bad experience in a taxi in australia !, 
  admittedly , i can only ever recall taking a taxi in australia twice ( one of which was like 9 or 10 years ago ) , i try to avoid them whenever i can purely because of price . 
  public transport , walking , and cycling is good enough for me . 
  i 've never used uber , either . 
  though i certainly would use them rather than a taxi purely because of the price thing . 
  price being equal , i 'd choose an uber over a taxi because of convenience , ordering and paying through an app , knowing exactly when they arrive , etc. 
  not because i 've actually had a bad experience with a taxi , but just because i * have n't * had an especially * good * experience . 
  yeah , the murder-suicide was an astonishing way to end the season . 
  i 'd definitely consider season 1 the second best overall , at this point . 
  but beginnings was just so astonishing as a standalone piece , and i only wish it could have been a 2 hour special , rather than one third that length . 
  and season 3 was just so brilliantly dark , and i thought the characterisation of the villains was great . 
  not quite as good as the arcs azula and zuko went through , but still very strong characters , and incredibly iconic . 
  lavabending , flying , making hands out of waterbending ? 
  that is so awesome . 
  and seeing zaheer literally airbend all the air out of the earth queen 's lungs was astonishing . 
  really solidified these guys as a * serious * threat . 
  that they * really * mean business . 
  i do n't think that scene * quite * compares to the murder-suicide at the end of season 1 , but it was still a really striking scene . 
  and then of course there was the characterisation of jinora and ( to a lesser extent ) the other airbending kids . 
  seeing her grow into an airbending master was just great . 
  i have irrationally strong opinions about a children 's cartoon ... 
  just a tip , if you want to make it a little more legible , you can add paragraphs by putting a line of just '' **** '' . 
  normally , this would create a horizontal line , but on this subreddit , it just adds paragraphs into the greentext . 
  yeah i have to agree with others here . 
  this survey is impossible to complete . 
  i do n't consistently hold my phone in any one hand , and i usually identify as ambidextrous . 
  yeah , i usually try to make sure whenever i mention os x over there , i mention windows very soon after , or before . 
  i use both very regularly ( windows desktop , mac laptop ) , so it 's easy for me . 
  but even so , it feels like a roll of the dice some times , for how the comment will be responded to . 
  i 'll definitely be following it , but then , i 'm a google fan first , and an apple a very distant second . 
  i do n't suppose you could share what time this event is in utc ? 
  it 's much easier for those of us who * do n't * happen to live in the united states to work out what time it is for us if we have a standardised point of reference . 
  cheers !, 
  i agree , and it would be nice if we could get more discussions going on with this subreddit . 
  but i think the far bigger problem is all the homebrew junk . 
  i think they should be relegated to either a similar weekly megathread , or told to go to / r/unearthedarcana , where they belong . 
  ( as well as / r/monsteraday . ), 
  right now , there are ** 8 ** posts with the [ homebrew ] tag on the front page . 
  ** 5 ** of those are in the top 10 . 
  that 's insane . 
  not to mention that two of those have `` v2 '' in the title , which means that they were posted here once before , and that they were n't even ready for prime time then , so the same content got posted twice . 
  if we could get that content to go somewhere more appropriate , and bring more discussions into the subreddit , i think that would greatly improve the state of this sub . 
  i absolutely think it is . 
  for me , the best bits of it are ( roughly in order ) :, 
  * new class and race options, 
  * magic items, 
  * traps and poisons, 
  * a few alternate/optional rules ( like specific rulings on gridded combat , flanking rules , etc. ), 
  if you 're creating your own campaign , there are some interesting tips and suggestions that can be used to help you decide on different plot points ( like who the villain is , what their motivations are , etc. ) . 
  do n't let the fact that they 're on random tables dissuade you . 
  you do n't have to ( and probably should n't , most of the time ) roll on them for every aspect of the campaign . 
  read through them and take what you like , or use it as a launching point for your own ideas . 
  but rolling on them can be okay sometimes , too . 
  additionally , things like treasure allocation and encounter budgets are nice to have some guidelines for , but * really * make sure to treat them like guidelines , not hard rules . 
  i 'm personally not a fan of being too detailed with the encounter budgets , especially . 
  question : was she also racist against other races ? 
  against asians , subcontinentals , arabs , etc. 
  i definitely would like to see the code that actually generates the random numbers , it 'd be interesting . 
  especially considering the above user 's problem with it seeming to not generate uniform results . 
  but i 'm not sure why one would be too concerned about it being pseudo-random . 
  it 's an app for tabletop roleplaying . 
  not something being used for cryptography . 
  as long as it 's producing uniform results in something that , without doing cryptographic statistical analysis , * appears * random , it 's easily good enough . 
  probably * better * than actually throwing dice would be , really . 
  java 's random and securerandom * classes , instantiated with the default method of generating a seed when the app launches , and then just allowed to run , are more than sufficient for these purposes . 
  \\* which would obviously not actually be secure if used in the way i suggest, 
  their network is largely incompatible with the rest of the world . 
  supporting a few gsm bands gives you the vast majority of the rest of the world , and also a significant percentage of american users . 
  adding support for verizon 's cdma network really gains very little -- just a few stick-in-the-mud american users who wo n't or ca n't switch to the more compatible systems used by at&t and t-mobile -- at the cost of taking up space for more useful things in the phone . 
  or , even worse , the cost of * removing * that support for the vast majority of the world , or of manufacturing two entirely different versions of the phone . 
  yeah , that 's what ausdroid is claiming .
