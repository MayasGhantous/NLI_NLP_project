  i feel like this analogy has gone so far past the point that it 's useful that i do n't even know what 's going on any more . 
  i thought op wanted us to theorise who would win if there were a shootout * between * unis from the two cities . 
  why `` for now '' ? 
  you do n't lose trademarks with time . 
  they 're not copyrights or patents in that way . 
  copyrights are the ones disney has famously repeatedly lobied to extend the lengths of . 
  and i doubt there 's much chance of disney losing the mickey mouse trademark because it gets genericised . 
  [ here 's one of the first articles that came up when i googled it ] ( http://accreditedfirstaid.com.au/first-aid-news/heimlich-manoeuvre-australia-leading-lack-evidence/ ) . 
  apparently , the american red cross has stopped recommending it since 2006 , and it has never been advised in australia . 
  do n't worry , show subreddits are always terrible during the off season . 
  it 'll get better really soon . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  i 'm not really sure how it would be a problem . 
  it 'll be uniform and unpredictable , wo n't it ? 
  i 'm doubtful that this is true . 
  at least not nearly true enough to be worth worrying about for a game . 
  i just tried it myself . 
  generated 100,000 numbers using two different processes ( one generating a new `` dice '' object each time , one creating one `` dice '' at the start and just rolling on that dice repeatedly ) . 
  then repeated that process 4 times . 
  the results i 'm getting are extremely close to 50 % . 
  as in , of the 8 sets of results i created , the furthest away from exactly 50 % was 49.858 % even numbers . 
  all the others were between 49.95 % and 50.07 % . 
  that is correct . 
  the earliest mickey mouse cartoons will become public domain in 2036 , and with that , the character himself . 
  anyone could create any content they like using the mickey mouse character , so long as they can reasonably claim it 's based on the 1928 version of the character , and not a more recent one ( since more recent ones will still have copyright protection ) . 
  however , anything that 's also protected by * trademark * ( and i 'm not a lawyer , so i have no idea exactly how much protection is given to them by this ) will continue to be afforded the same protections it already was . 
  no idea what the actual impact of that might be , but i ca n't find much about it on google , so it 's * probably * fairly insignificant . 
  so , just for shits and giggles , i ran the test again once with 1,000,000 numbers , once with each method . 
  when you generate a new die every time it needs to be rolled , i get 49.945 % evens . 
  a z-test on that gives a p value of 0.0567 . 
  normally , it would need to be less than 0.05 to be able to say with confidence `` this is a statistically significant difference '' . 
  so it was certainly close , but is n't quite enough to deem statistically significant . 
  when a single die is created and rolled a bunch of times , i got 49.997 % even , which , on a z-test , has a p value of 0.917 . 
  enough to say * very * confidently that this method truely does come from a uniform distribution . 
  edit : oh , you know what , that was stupid . 
  i was assuming a standard deviation of ~ 28 , as though i was sampling according to individual numbers , rather than just looking for odd and even . 
  updated accordingly , the p values are 0.27 and 0.95 , meaning that in this is even less likely to have come from some sort of system biased towards even or odd numbers . 
  as far as i 'm aware , this website is not official , it 's run by same fans . 
  those fans , it would seem , are not native english speakers . 
  you might like to take a look at our [ style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) to get this to show up more nicely . 
  specifically , you need to put a * blank line * between any two lines of greentext for it to display correctly : the same as any normal paragraph of text . 
  the only thing wrong with that question was that they used `` i.e. '', 
  when they meant `` e.g. 
  the united federation of planets has a nicer ring to it , i think . 
  well , written how you wrote it , it 's a descriptive term for nasa . 
  nasa is america 's national space agency , in the same way that in australia , the abc is the national broadcaster , or in canada , canada post is the national postage service . 
  when written capitalised , how op did it , it seems to be implying that there 's an organisation known as the `` national space agency '' , which is obviously wrong . 
  the us lost the race to put a man in space , as far as i 'm aware . 
  for future reference , the difference is that `` i.e. '', 
  basically means `` that is '' , so you would use it if what follows is a complete list if every possible example . 
  `` e.g. '', 
  is `` for example '' , and you use it when you are providing only a few examples out of many possible ones . 
  haha this is hilarious . 
  i read them clockwise , starting at the top left . 
  it was n't until i got to italy that i realised what i was looking at . 
  go on google earth , rotate it funny , and take a screenshot . 
  for me , i saw the boot , and my first thought was `` huh , whoever designed this has clearly stolen some aspects straight from europe . 
  i mean , that 's not just a boot , it 's clearly exactly the same as italy . '', 
  it took me a couple more seconds before i actually realised that they did n't just take italy ... 
  [ orchestration online ] ( https://youtube.com/orchestrationonline ) is a great one . 
  i first stumbled across the channel as a result of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjct5m8jzl4 ) , which responds to some claims that leonard bernstein made in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouyy1gv8jhu ) regarding beethoven 's compositional abilities . 
  both videos are absolutely brilliant and worth watching for any composer or musician , but it 's probably not quite what you 're looking for . 
  what * could * be what you 're looking for is some of the other videos on the orchestration online channel . 
  any of the ones with `` lecture '' , `` question '' , `` tip '' , or `` intro to orchestration '' in the title . 
  the channel also has an associated facebook group with some great high-quality discussion on compositional practices . 
  but thanks for linking to johann de meij . 
  i had never heard of him before , but his videos look absolutely great . 
  i 'll be giving them a look . 
  well , really , short hoses are kinda useless . 
  i think one way they could potentially fix this is with level-restricted feats , like previous editions have had . 
  warlock invocations are sort of like feats , and they already have level restrictions in some cases . 
  that way , there could be some better ones that you have to be at a high level to get , which there being good options even at higher levels . 
  it 's like with choosing spells . 
  if all spells were the same level , you 'd have picked the best ones in the first 5 levels or so , and then you 'd just start having worse ones as you keep levelling . 
  instead , you unlock better spells as you level up , which keeps interesting choices coming . 
  how do you define `` non-combat '' feats ? 
  the wizard in my previous campaign took lucky , and in our current campaign , i ( a warlock ) took magic initiate . 
  neither of those are , strictly speaking , combat feats , but depending on how exactly you use them , they can be useful in combat . 
   taught me statistics when i just could n't get it, 
  could i please borrow your husband for a couple of months ?
