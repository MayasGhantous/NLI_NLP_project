  yes it is . 
  it 's a fairly na\u00efve interpretation of it , but it is n't * wrong * , per se . 
  as the length of an online discussion increases , the probability of a comparison to hitler or the nazis tends towards 1 . 
  that 's the most accurate description of it . 
  in layman 's terms , that means that if it 's long enough , someone * will * make the comparison ( since the probability is 1 , i.e. 
  certain ) . 
  ninjaedit : actually , i just realised op copied and pasted the title verbatim from a part of that article . 
   `` as an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving nazis or hitler approaches 1 '' -- that is , if an online discussion ( regardless of topic or scope ) goes on long enough , sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to hitler or nazism . 
  op just used the more basic of the explanations of it . 
  tends towards 1 means that , from a theoretical perspective , if it reached infinite length ( i.e. , `` gets long enough '' ) then it is certain that it will happen . 
  either way , `` that 's not what the link says at all '' is clearly wrong , since it was a copy paste from the article itself . 
  the buggers chase you . 
  i was riding through an area with an angry magpie in it a couple of years ago . 
  after it swooped me for the first time , i picked up my pace and started peddling like crazy . 
  it kept coming at me again and again , musta been for like 30 seconds or more , with me going well over 30 km/h . 
  yes , you should . 
  if you do n't at least kinda sorta follow the cricket when there 's a big match on , you need to hand in your australian citizenship right now . 
  as an aussie ex-expat who was in asia , yeah , i agree . 
  aussies are definitely the second worst tourists out there , and they 're probably not that far behind the yanks . 
  edit : actually , strike that . 
  neither aussies nor yanks have * anything * on russians . 
  the other two are at least respectful to the locals the majority of the time . 
  russians are slightly less loud and obnoxious in general , but are extremely rude to locals , and to me that 's way worse . 
  the australian ones have both auditory and tactile feedback . 
  the tactile comes in the form of a vibration that syncs up with the noise of the beep , if you touch the [ arrow above the button ] ( http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/09/07/1226713/962464-369d7060-16ba-11e3-af42-07bd3660d6b5.jpg ) . 
  that sounds like you 're describing melbourne , mate , not australia in general . 
  australian magpies are completely unrelated to european magpies . 
  completely different family . 
  european magpies are in the family corvidae , along with crows , ravens , and , yes , jackdaws . 
  aussie maggies are artamidae , along with butcherbirds . 
  i went to one overseas . 
  it was okay for a laugh . 
  there 's one in my city here in aus that i know of . 
  it sits on the location of what used to be a `` lone star '' texan-themed restaurant which i assume was equally laughable to a texan . 
  yeah we do . 
  not many , but there are a few . 
  the only one i know of specifically is in aspley in brisbane , where there used to be a `` lone star '' texan-themed restaurant . 
  it began with some australian tourism ads in the us starring paul hogan ( the actor best known for playing `` crocodile '' dundee in the eponymous films ) . 
  sorta . 
  it was started by ads for australian tourism that were aired * in * the us . 
  i believe the language was used to be more easily understandable for americans . 
  debit cards are actually kinda the norm here , but we often just call them credit cards . 
  i think it 's probably largely thanks to american film and television , where they use credit cards all the time , since actual * credit * cards are more common than debit ones over there . 
  is n't it php ? 
  echo `` rekt '' ;, 
  oh no , they are friendly . 
  they 're just very loud and easy to spot . 
  second in that regard only to americans ( who also tend to be friendly enough ) . 
  and i was referring to south east asia . 
  the indochinese peninsula , malaysia/singapore , that kind of area . 
  not so much indonesia , though . 
  haha i 've only watched a handful of afl games . 
  but being a queenslander gives me a bit of an excuse , i guess -- i do kinda follow the nrl . 
  and i 'm with you on beer . 
  not a huge fan at all . 
  see the edit . 
  in my opinion , that is definitely the case in this scenario , but is n't * always * the case . 
  why the ** fuck ** do people go to the effort of uploading to gfycat , and then ** share the fucking . gif version anyway ** . 
  [ here 's a not-retarded version of the link ] ( http://gfycat.com/dazzlingcompleteankole ) . 
  umm , i hate to break it to you , but you caught bird flu . 
  you should get that checked out . 
  i hope you pointed out how useful a unix environment is for computer science . 
  and they probably stared blankly and had no idea what you were talking about . 
  haha yeah , windows ' command prompt is just utterly useless . 
  for doing git , now that you 've learnt to do it through the command line ( which is certainly a useful way to start out ) , i would * highly * recommend grabbing sourcetree . 
  it 's a fantastic gui application for managing git projects . 
  available on os x and windows . 
  honestly it 's a pain when i go into linux now , because there are n't * any * good gui git managers for it ... 
  i also find the command line really convenient for mocking up quick c programmes using vim , and then compiling with gcc . 
  though you do need to get yourself a decent . vimrc file to make it not a huge pain . 
  but once you have it set up correctly , vim is a fantastic editor . 
  i 'm really glad for this new rule , but i wish it went further . 
  one per day is still a hell of a lot of stuff . 
  is there any chance it could be changed to one per user per week ? 
  one big dump of the monster a day and other recurring homebrew stuff would be much better than having a new post every , single , day of the stuff . 
  if people want to discuss the stuff immediately as it happens , / r/unearthedarcana is a more appropriate place . 
  instead , a lower quantity of bigger dumps would provide a good compromise between people who want to discuss homebrew stuff on the larger subreddit , and would mean that we 'd be unlikely to be inundated with so many [ homebrew ] tags on the front page . 
  i agree , i 'd rather not see the homebrew stuff on the main d&d subreddits at all . 
  but this is a nice compromise that prevents quite as much spam as we 've been getting lately . 
  personally , i think this is too small a change , because the biggest offenders are already only posting once , * maybe * twice per day . 
  one per week would be nice here . 
  it 's a good compromise that allows them to post their homebrew stuff on a fairly regular basis , while reducing the spam for those of us mostly interested in official stuff to a * much * more manageable level . 
  daily or more frequent content can go to the more appropriate subreddit . 
  [ thank god for this site ] ( http://cdecl.ridiculousfish.com/?q=void+%28%2a%28%2af%5b%5d%29%28%29%29%28%29 ) . 
  it 's the first real language they teach , but they make you do that stupid fucking thing with the cat first . 
  honestly i wish they 'd just use python . 
  my uni 's first programming course was in python , and i found that way easier than when i tried doing cs50x . 
  the cat thing was impossible to work with . 
  i liked cs50 once i got past the first week of it , though . 
  i 'm not entirely sure i agree with their decision to start with c , though . 
  throwing such strict typing and the need to compile onto people who have literally just started programming seems unnecessary . 
  let them learn basic programme flows like loops , functions , conditionals , etc. 
  first . 
  you 're all good . 
  you did get picked up by the spam filter or something , though . 
  not sure why . 
  but i 've fixed it . 
  if your experience with apple computers is that old , it 's probably * vastly * out of date . 
  since the release of os x in 2001 , macs have been unix compliant . 
  the upshot of that is that you can do * vastly * more techy stuff with them than you can on windows .
