  html5 video formats can get much higher quality and take up much less space ( and hence will download and let you watch them faster ) than gifs . 
  gfycat also offers gif versions of files just because some people are still unable to play html5 videos . 
  but because the majority of people * are * able to play the html5 versions , * that 's what people should link to normally * . 
  when people link to the gif version of it , it 's really frustrating , because the * point * of gfycat is to host html5 stuff , reduce bandwidth usage , and speed things up . 
  linking to the gif completely defeats the purpose of it all . 
  yeah , i 've certainly never heard any collective demonym for people from either the commonwealth , or commonwealths in general , despite being from a commonwealth within a commonwealth . 
  i suspect part of the reason is simply that there 's really no need for it . 
  people rarely refer collectively to all members of the commonwealth . 
  and when they do , `` commonwealth citizen '' is a sufficient descriptor . 
  i would suggest reading [ this from the sidebar ] ( https://zagorath.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/dvorak/ ) . 
  do not get key stickers or anything similar to out in your keyboard . 
  if anything , print a visual guide of the keyboard and hang that under you monitor or something . 
  do you know python ? 
  ninja edit : just realised there 's a good chance the bit you did n't get was the music reference , too . 
  the joke was that it 's franz list . 
  [ this is how i 'm imagining your kinder rogue ] ( http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/d3/e7/d3e79deb83e374e9fcdd88df076fb20c.jpg?itok=argymjym ) . 
  so , levels 1 -- 4 it does you spellcasting ability modifier , levels 5 -- 10 it 's 1d8 + mod , 2d8 + mod at lvl11 , etc. 
  that 's a really odd system to use , but it 's definitely very interesting . 
  could he very powerful in combination with shillelagh , or a rogue 's sneak attack . 
  and could mesh well with bladelocks . 
  yeah , if the weapon is d6 or lower the second target will take more damage , which is odd . 
  but assuming you can use this with sneak attack ( i do n't have my books on me , but from memory i ca n't think of any reason you could n't ) , you could still in load a heap of damage to two targets , with weapon + sneak + dex on the primary target , and d8 + mod on the secondary . 
  yeah , that 's what makes this such an odd spell . 
  each target takes a different `` base '' damage . 
  the primary one gets its normal damage ( weapon die + strength or dex mod ) , and the secondary one gets spellcasting mod . 
  then at higher levels both take an extra 1d8 . 
  really odd mechanic . 
  interesting , but odd . 
  oh good point . 
  you 're probably right . 
  still , it 's be interesting to see an official ruling on that . 
  edit : you know what , i think / u/lordzygos probably has it right . 
  unless there 's a specific ruling otherwise , i would probably allow it . 
  i 'd be super surprised if warlocks do n't get this . 
  it fits perfectly with bladelocks both mechanically and thematically . 
  it 's a pretty good fit thematically for clerics , in my opinion , too . 
  rogues could still potentially get it , since they pick from the wizard spell list ( and , iirc , they can pick a couple of spells from * any * school , even though most have to be a more limited selection ) . 
  nexus 4 is n't getting marshmallow , which means it received regular updates for 3 years before being dropped . 
  certainly makes me feel very good about buying nexus . 
   so excited for this book, 
  oh boy , so am i. 
  but even more than that , i really hope they reach $ 100,000 . 
  i want that map , and i do n't want to have to wait until november !, 
  i do n't think that 's true . 
  it says this cantrip takes an action to use . 
  i think this would make you give up your extra attacks . 
  instead , * part of * casting this cantrip involves making a single weapon attack . 
  yeah i think a better way of wording it would be range `` self '' , and part of the spell involves making a melee attack . 
  oh right , yeah . 
  i thought you were referring to the extra attack ability all fighters get , which you would have to give up to use this . 
  if your bladelock weapon is 1d8 or less , i think this would probably still work out in your favour . 
  double attack would give you 2 [ w ] +2 str per turn . 
  greenflame blade gives you , after level 5 , [ w ] + str +1 d8 to the primary target , and 1d8 + cha to the secondary one . 
  that means with a d8 weapon , double attack gives a total of 2d8 +2 str damage , while greenflame does a total of 3d8 + str+cha ( with 2d8 + str being at the primary target ) . 
  if you 're using a two-handed weapon , then gaining an extra attack will still do higher damage to the primary target ( making it better at taking on single tough bad guys ) , but you 're probably losing out in terms of total number of damage points . 
  plus , do n't forget at even higher levels . 
  at level 11 , greenflame goes up by an extra 1d8 for each of the two targets . 
  your strength modifier has probably maxed out at this point , so it ca n't increase enough to keep pace . 
  this is just really quick off the top of my head though . 
  please somebody correct me if i 've made any errors in my assumptions or in my reasoning . 
  why does it matter , in this case ? 
  either they have a different brain structure because they are actually of the opposite gender to what they appear , or they are of the opposite gender to what they appear because their brains developed differently . 
  from a scientific point of view this might be interesting , but from the perspective of society and any laws , it does n't matter . 
  what matters is that they * do * feel like their gender does n't match up with their body , and there * are * scientific explanations ( as shown by the three sources / u/tempname -3 provided ) for this : it * is n't * just some arty-farty `` i do n't like this '' type of thing . 
  but in the president example , there are other , more likely , explanations . 
  that the role of president is stressful , and being stressed leads to going grey . 
  or even just that because of the requirements to become president ( both those to be legally eligible , and also the social ones to become considered seriously by the public for the role ) , presidents tend to be elected around the time just before their hair starts going grey . 
  if you can not come up with an alternate likely explanation in this case , then you must recognise that one of the above possibilities is , with near certainty , the probable case . 
  as they say :, 
   correlation does n't imply causation , but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing ` look over there ' . 
  there is no good explanation for why those who identify as transgender could * possibly * have brain structures that match more closely with the gender they feel they belong to than the one they were born with the physical parts for , which * does n't * also lead to the conclusion that we as a society should be willing to accept them for what they feel they are . 
  the acceptable ads thing * is * a bought spot , but people often see that and think `` oh noooez !, 
  anyone can pay money and show shit ads . 
  the fact is this is completely wrong . 
  to go on the whitelist , an advertiser must first meet the acceptable ads policy , and * then * ** also ** pay the fee . 
  i like ads . 
  i 've only very rarely seen an ad on a website that taught me about something i was n't already interested in , and then became interested in ( my current telco is the * only * example i can think of ) , so that does n't matter much to me . 
  i like them because they make so much awesome stuff on the internet able to exist completely for free . 
  a normal b flat clarinet can reach to written e. 
  a normal a clarinet can reach to written e. 
  on a bb clarinet , written e is concert d. on an a clarinet , written e is concert c # . 
  some bb clarinets have an extra key to reach written e flat , so that their lowest note matches the lowest note of the a clarinet , making playing parts written for an a clarinet on the more common b flat clarinet possible . 
  ( not easy in many cases , but at least possible . ), 
  it should be noted that unlike all other wind instruments , the clarinet can reach the bottom notes of its range with absolute ease . 
  there 's no difficulty in playing bottom e , any more than there would be to play the e right above middle-c , or the e one octave above that . 
  for what it 's worth , when you do the adjustments , it is n't nearly as bad as it sounds . 
  usd500 is about aud710 at the moment . 
  remember that advertised prices in the us do n't account for tax , but ours do , so add on 10 % . 
  you end up at about $ 780 . 
  still being ripped off over $ 100 , which is a total rort , but it 's not * quite * as bad as it first seems . 
   when my dad saw it on tv and told her , she thought he was making a joke until he showed her the news on tv . 
  this is fascinating to me . 
  i learnt very little about the end of the cold war in school . 
  was it really sudden like that ? 
  like , were there not signs that this would be happening soon , and that it was inevitable ? 
  the idea that it just all of a sudden happened is amazing . 
  what exactly brought it about ? 
  no it 's not . 
  that 's * way * worse . 
  not only is there now a minimum word count of exactly 1800 , there 's a maximum word count of just 2200 .
