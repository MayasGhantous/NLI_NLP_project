  that 's an insanely narrow band to try and fit in . 
  a reasonable thing to say is `` try and make your essay between 2000 and 2500 words , but if you can get everything you need to say in less than that , or if you need a bit more than that , then that 's ok . you 'll be judged on the quality of the content , not its length . '', 
  seconded, 
  oh wow , thanks for this !, 
  i usually used \u02da ( option-k ) since i knew option-0 was wrong , but did n't know what 's right . 
  but option-k was easy to remember as `` k is for kelvin '' , even if kelven does n't actually get used with degrees , remembering one temperature scale for another was simple enough . 
  out of interest , what is the `` ordinal indicator '' actually meant to be used for ? 
  and what is the correct name for the symbol typed by option-k ? 
  apparently they 're not * quite * the same . 
  sorta like how \u2122 is n't the same as ^ ( tm ) . 
  i would n't want that because if i 'm writing about programming , i want it to stay as ` ! = ` . 
  for reference , the reason \u00df comes up on s is that it 's a german symbol that essentially represents `` ss '' . 
  like in the word `` gro\u00df '' ( meaning `` gross '' in its traditional sense : large ) . 
  were you looking for this :, 
  it 's a great mnemonic ( sorta ) . 
  kelvin is a measure of temperature , \u00b0 c is also a measure of temperature . 
  so remember that option-k gives the degree symbol . 
  works like a charm . 
  of course , everyone ( at least everyone who 's finished high school ) should aready know that you do n't actually use degrees with kelvin , but if you already know that , this mnemonic device works to help remember the key . 
  unfortunately , despite all that , it actually * is n't * a good mnemonic device , since option-k does n't give the degree symbol . 
  option-shift-8 ( or option - * ) does . 
  i dunno what option-k is , but like option-0 , it 's a lookalike that actually is n't what you want . 
  you should have a read of our [ style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) to learn how to format your post in the greentext format . 
  greenflame blade is really interesting . 
  an extremely unique cantrip that provides both good mechanical power and interesting flavour . 
  i think the background is largely underwhelming . 
  not significantly different enough from the criminal background to be worthwhile . 
  there 's a bunch of stuff from the table of contents that interests me further in this book . 
  learning about primal paths , sorcerous origins , divine domains , etc. 
  should be really interesting , assuming ( as it seems ) that this is mostly descriptive stuff about their place in the world and other flavourful aspects . 
  i 'm * particularly * interested in `` patrons in the realms '' . 
  a lot of the stuff from chapter 1 looks like it could be interesting , and the appendix about class options in other settings is also welcome . 
  but what i really want is that damn map !, 
  we need to get this thing to reach $ 100,000 !, 
   or the odd chance that you may get woken up an hour earlier, 
  or an hour later , depending on whether we 're in october or april . 
  if you 're looking at another provider , my recommendations would be [ vaya ] ( http://www.vaya.net.au/ ) , [ yatango ] ( https://goo.gl/anhujh ) , or [ amaysim ] ( https://www.amaysim.com.au/ ) . 
  they 're all resellers of the optus network , so you 'll get the same very good ( but not as good as telstra ) coverage that you would on optus , but way , * way * cheaper than actually going with optus themselves . 
  [ more detail as to the differences between those three here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/3nc4lj/australians_interested_in_the_6p_or_5x_ive_made/cvmxevo?context=2 ) . 
  in my opinion , 15 years is a good time frame for revisiting major referenda . 
  i have no idea when the last time this was brought up in queensland is , and frankly i do n't care . 
  the further away the possibility of us getting that god-awful system is , the better . 
  at the front of my mind is the republican debate , and i would n't want that stifled by people saying `` we already did this '' . 
  similarly , although i am vehemently opposed to daylight saving , it does n't seem fair that any potential debate over it should not occur just because we had that debate once ages ago . 
   studies have proven that daylight saving does the opposite actually , power consumption increases, 
  actually , studies have been inconsistent . 
  some have found increases , some have found decreases . 
  what they all say , though , is that either way , the difference is miniscule . 
   like what does it achieve, 
  a spike in heart problems , suicides , and traffic accidents , for one thing . 
  playing devil 's advocate here ( because i am against dst at any time of year , though admittedly i 'd rather see it in winter than in summer , if we had to have it at all ) , but it could be because far more people are awake at sunset to notice the difference than at sunrise . 
   and us qlders like melbourne too ( for obvious reasons ), 
  not obvious to me . 
  what 's the reason ? 
  reddit is fun is by far the best android app for reddit . 
  you 'll want to avoid the vast majority of samsung 's crapware ( unfortunately , samsung devices are nowhere close to being the beautiful google experience android ) , so make sure to pick up google calendar , inbox or gmail , keep , and maps , if they did n't come preinstalled . 
  make sure your launcher is the `` google now launcher '' . 
  ( google now is google 's alternative to apple 's siri , but it 's way , way better than siri . 
  yes , it has the voice recognition and response thing , but even better , it will surface useful information to you when you need it , as well as suggesting things that that it thinks could be interesting to you , like suggesting movies or restaurants on the weekend if you 're out , and articles that might be interesting to you based on your interests . ), 
  if you 're a podcast listener , my recommendation is pocket casts , but really there are a whole lot of great options out there . 
  google opinion rewards lets you do surveys for play store credit , which could be a great way to pay for any apps that you want that are n't free , or you can use it to buy music , movies , etc. 
  if you 're a facebook user , facebook messenger actually has a really cool little feature called chat heads , which is super convenient . 
  every 15 years if there 's enough debate in public that it seems like there might be a reasonable chance of something happening . 
  almost nobody wants prohibition : it 's very clear that if there were a referendum on that , it would get less than 10 % of people voting in favour . 
  so no , we do n't need a referendum on that . 
  but if there 's a lot of debate going on in public , and clearly the public opinion is split on it , then yeah , after 15 years it 's reasonable to consider revisiting the issue . 
  yeah , that sounds like it could be interesting . 
  yeah , this is what i want to see . 
  instead of group voting tickets be a full preference list , let them just represent a set of votes going towards that party . 
  for example , vote [ 1 ] green would actually translate to [ 1 ] di natale , [ 2 ] hanson-young , [ 3 ] ludlam ( let 's pretend they 're all running in the same state ) , if one were to vote below the line . 
  after that , maybe a vote [ 2 ] labor would start at [ 4 ] shorten , and then go [ 5 ] plibersek , [ 6 ] albanese , [ 7 ] bowen , [ 8 ] burke . 
  if , on the same ballot , someone else went [ 1 ] labor , [ 2 ] greens , it would be the same as, 
  [ 1 ] shorten , [ 2 ] plibersek , [ 3 ] albanese , [ 4 ] bowen , [ 5 ] burke , [ 6 ] di natale , [ 7 ] hanson-young , [ 8 ] ludlam . 
  potentially , this system could mix above-the-line and below-the-line votes . 
  for example , one might vote [ 1 ] ludlam , [ 2 ] di natale , [ 3 ] hanson-young , [ 4 ] labor , if i happen to like ludlam the most , and therefore do n't want to vote in the greens ' preferred order , but after the greens are exhausted , i 'm happy to go through with the order labor wanted for their members . 
  when minor parties are getting in on the back of back-room deals and preferences despite receiving less than 1 % of first-preference votes , that is a problem . 
  when people are required to either agree with how a single party wants their vote distributed , or spend their time numbering from 1 up to over 70 different candidates , and hope they do n't accidentally skip a number or use the same number twice , in order for their vote to be counted , that is a problem . 
  when those group voting tickets can be used to confuse voters so that even ones who do their research but miss some minute details of how the ticket is structured , and therefore think their preferences are going towards a party they like , but in fact they are structured to weaken that party 's chances of getting a member elected , *** that is a problem *** . 
  for what it 's worth ( and i honestly really do * not * want us to go down this road ) the bbc receives at least part of its funding directly from people who pay for tv licences . 
  even their free-to-air television is n't actually free . 
  so it is n't entirely out of taxpayer money . 
  i do n't know what percentage comes from where , though . 
  ah right , yeah , that makes sense . 
  wait this is two queensland teams ? 
  i thought it was western australia vs. victoria . 
  sounds made up to me . 
  even before abbott forced the abc to dump australia network ( their international channel ) overseas , it did n't air the nrl . 
  so i 'm doubtful that now with it 's slashed funding , it 'd be aired overseas . 
  vulcan nerve pinch . 
  no , the account being shown is the legitimate nsw rl twitter account . 
  i do n't know if they were hacked , or there was some intern running it on his last day and he wanted to troll them , or even if the screenshots are doctored . 
  but the account is n't a parody one . 
  netball came about as a woman 's version of basketball .
