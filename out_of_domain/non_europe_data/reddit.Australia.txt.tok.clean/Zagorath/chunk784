  wait , you can `` ok google '' from anywhere ? 
  how did you get it to allow that ? 
  for me , it only works when i 'm on google itself , or the new tab page . 
  i wonder , i you familiar with the [ eberron unearthed arcana ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_eberron_v1.1.pdf ) ? 
  it actually already contains a wizard tradition of the `` artificer '' . 
  i dunno how good it is , because i have n't read much about previous editions ' artificers to compare it to , but wotc has at least clearly considered this already . 
  and , if anyone 's interested , [ here is the lesser-known original tale of sir bearington ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dpqop/the _ original_story_of_sir_bearington / ) . 
  i 'm wondering about the insightful manipulator feature . 
  it 's obviously very , * very * similar to the battlemaster fighter 's `` know your enemy '' feature , only instead of focussing on physical traits , it focusses on mental ones . 
  but what i wonder about is the fact that this gives `` class levels '' , whereas the other on has both `` total class levels '' and `` fighter class levels '' . 
  does that mean that a battlemaster fighter can ascertain how many levels someone has taken in fighter , as well as how many class levels they have in total ( but not * what * those levels are in , if they 're not in fighter ) . 
  whereas this would give you a full break-down of what levels they 've taken ? 
  the lack of the word `` total '' here makes me think that 's probably the case , which is quite interesting . 
  oooh !, 
  what interests me way more here than the actual mastermind ( which is itself a pretty damn cool archetype with a lot of nice flavour to it ) is the fact that they 've shown the swashbuckler rogue is another archetype in this book . 
  does this make it the first time something from unearthed arcana has made it into official , non-beta material ? 
  that 's pretty damn awesome !, 
  they 're not imaginary !, 
  i did n't spend all this time accumulating * imaginary * internet points !, 
  they 're just worthless , is all . 
  sort of like an ejection seat on a helicopter . 
  how so ? 
  as far as i can see , all we 've seen so far is the details of the `` fancy footwork '' feature , which looks to me like it 's nearly word-for-word the same , and definitely mechanically the same . 
   during your turn , if you make a melee attack against a creature , that creature ca n't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn, 
  that part is in both . 
  only the flavour text is slightly different . 
  if by `` your own image '' you mean `` the image of yourself '' , then you 're right . 
  anyone can take a photo of you in public and use it as they wish , that is perfectly legal . 
  if by `` your own image '' you mean `` the image that you took '' , then no , you * do * have legal ownership . 
  in fact , technically speaking , you do n't even need to register your copyright to own it . 
  it 's just that , if you * have n't * registered it , it 's usually going to be unenforcable . 
  you 're wrong . 
  i considered providing an explanation in the previous comment , but decided against it basically because it 's so far wrong it 's hard to know where to begin to provide more explanation . 
  put simply : no , you do not give up copyright ownership of something just because you put it online . 
  in many cases , sites you upload it to * might * have a clause in the tos stating that you grant them some ( or unlimited ) rights to use it , but even so , strictly speaking , you still * own * it . 
  think about it for a second , and you 'll see why the idea of it all being public domain is ridiculous . 
  how many companies put a lot of high effort or high value content online ? 
   every picture has dates imprinted, 
  no they do n't . 
  most cameras and image dams add metadata including timestamps , but these can be easily faked , and so really do not hold very much significance . 
  it might be easy enough to demonstrate that you own it by some other means , for example showing that you control the account that first uploaded them to the internet , or by producing the raw file , but the point is that it 's much harder to find lawyers to take your case if you did n't register your copyright . 
  not impossible , but more difficult , compared to the trivially easy lawsuit one can bring with registered copyrighted works . 
  this is the advice i 've heard from numerous professional photographers from a number of sources online and in podcasts . 
  wait , it 's not that ? 
  i 've never once watched this ad past the point where you can skip it , and have no intention of changing that ... 
  which was also annoying as fuck . 
  i want ads that tell me how * good * a product is , not how shitty the competition is . 
  negative campaigning is shit . 
  if hiring that actor for the ad causes more people to donate , and the rise in donations is greater than the cost of making the ad , then it was a net benefit for their cause . 
  i do n't know for certain , obviously , but i would guess they know what the results of those ads usually are , and since they still produce them , they probably are beneficial . 
  plus , who knows , maybe the celebrity really believes in the cause and is doing it pro bono or for really cheap ?

  usb drive , usb stick , and just `` a usb '' are all about equal to me . 
  that 's not just you . 
  i 'm seeing that even on the web interface . 
  looks like the mods have taken down the sticky . 
  i do n't know what they 'll be doing with these new phones , but back when i bought my nexus 4 , they charged for shipping in addition to having prices that were greater than just us \\* currency conversion \\* tax rate . 
  the australian price for the cheapest 6p is over $ 100 more than can be accounted for by just currency conversion and tax rate . 
  dunno if there 'll be shipping costs in addition to that ( since outside the us and a couple of other countries , you ca n't even preorder the thing yet ) , but i would n't be at all surprised if there are .

  if you own an android phone , chances are google already knows about your whereabouts in the physical world , too .

  this is why i love tabletop rpgs . 
  by their very nature , you 're so much more free to do what you want to do : including killing ( or at least trying to ) major npcs that are important to the plot . 
  or children , if you want to .

  edit :, 
  if anyone is interested in getting in to roleplaying games , / r/dnd or / r/dndnext are great places to start out . 
  the latest edition of dungeons & dragons has free versions available . 
  the [ player 's rules can be found here ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/basicrules_playerv3.4.pdf ) , and the [ dungeon master 's rules can be found here ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/dmbasicrulesv.0.3.pdf ) . 
  games are generally run with 1 dungeon master and between 3 and 5 players , but other combinations can work . 
  a good pre-made campaign ( which also comes with some character sheets , a set of dice , and other stuff that 's useful for first-time d&d players ) is the `` dungeons & dragons starter set '' , which comes with a campaign called `` the lost mines of phandelver '' . 
  the set is about $ 20 in the us . 
  / u/zagorath has a +5 ac bonus thanks to being across the internet , and thus / u/krutonium 's attempt fails . 
  well you could always try the diplomatic solution . 
  which is one of the greatest advantages of tabletop games . 
  there are so many different ways of solving a problem . 
  yes , you can use `` bigger sword diplomacy '' , but you can also try stealthy solutions , or try and actually talk your way around what you want . 
  in computer games there are usually only a handful of ways to solve something , and if you want to try a solution the developers did n't think of , you 're out of luck . 
  in rpgs , your imagination is the limit ( well , so is your luck with the die ) . 
  i was envisaging it as an attack roll against me ( with ac12 , but with a +5 cover bonus ) . 
  rolling with advantage because of distraction . 
  ac is 12 , with a +5 cover bonus over the internet . 
  + / u/rollme, 
  the dc on that 's gon na be quite low , because ( a ) i 'm feeling in a forgiving mood , and ( b ) you failed anyway . 
  i 'd say a 10 or higher is probably a success . 
  + / u/rollme, 
  looks like / u/redshirtedcrewman 's back stab failed miserably . 
  rolling with advantage ( which means you roll twice and take the higher of the two ) . 
  with ac 12 and internet cover of +5 , you 'll need a 17 or higher to succeed . 
  + / u/rollme, 
  there definitely are people like you who enjoy that kind of thing . 
  personally i enjoy the narrative and exploration more , but you 've just got ta find the right group for you . 
   my character was an asshole, 
  this is generally looked down upon in rpgs , as it is in real life . 
  if he was going to have some form of authorities come after you , that seems totally reasonable . 
  if he was going to say `` you get hit by lightning and die '' , well , that 's not ( unless it 's already been established that the gods in the realm you 're in are * very * interventionist and would do that kind of thing , and even then it 's kinda shaky ) .
