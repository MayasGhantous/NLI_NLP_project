  i watched the first like 40 minutes of it and found it so dull i had to stop . 
  he plays frank underwood in the american version of house of cards , and does an absolutely chillingly good job of it . 
  he also played a great lex luthor in an otherwise bland superman film . 
  i also liked the music . 
  well too fucking bad . 
  they did . 
  sure , they missed out a few bits of the novel , perhaps the most striking of which was the scouring of the shire , but for the most part the plot stays * very * close to the books , and most of the narrative changes are made for good reasons . 
  for example , to keep the plot simpler , they made frodo 's quest with the ring the primary story arc , and aragorn 's ascension to king the secondary one , and mostly discarded other major arcs , including those of pippin and merry ; this * necessitated * leaving out the scouring , because without more developed hobbits , it would n't have been earned . 
  and from a thematic point of view , it was brilliant . 
  they managed to get across the same themes that were present in the novel . 
  i think this is why i 've never liked it . 
  it 's made in such a way that it appeals so perfectly the the american audience , but in doing so it loses other audiences . 
  i 've never met anyone who was not american that even * likes * the movie , let alone considers it great . 
  i know there are some who do ( especially canadians ) , i 've just not met them . 
  for what it 's worth , it really * does n't * appeal to all audiences . 
  in fact , i hold it up as a a fantastic example of a movie that so perfectly grabs one audience while being almost inaccessible to all others . 
  i 've only even * heard * of a tiny number of americans who did n't like it . 
  i do n't know what it is about the movie , but somehow it perfectly grabs the interest of americans , and nearly every one of them loves it . 
  on the other hand , i 've not met a * single * person from elsewhere who even likes it , let alone considers it great . 
  i know there are some ( especially canadians ) , but i 've never met them . 
  outside america it 's a complete non-event of a movie . 
  lol wtf ? 
  what world do you live in where you think reddit 's general opinion about jobs or apple was ever a positive one ? 
   gold is useless, 
  what ? 
  who says this ? 
  i want to smack them in the face . 
  i 'm * desperate * for some gold . 
  i 've got 3 at the moment , and i need to buy a damn pearl worth 100 so i can cast the damn identify spell . 
  yeah that 's what mine did , too . 
  there 's always going to be good comments about someone right after they die . 
  it 's considered in bad taste to do otherwise , unless the person is truly outright evil \u00e0 la pol pot or hitler . 
  what is useful to look at is the comments * before * they die , or a long time afterwards . 
  and reddit definitely was not friendly towards jobs before his death . 
  if it 's a non-linked word , it 's not a url , and that 's what we 're discussing here . 
  we already know it works otherwise . 
   cup of coffee . 
   alignment is basically a mechanic-less flavor thing , thank goodness . 
  in particular , spells like detect evil & good , and the paladin 's divine sense * do n't * actually detect based on alignment . 
  they detect fiends , celestials , fey , etc. 
  make sure to actually read the details of these spells and abilities . 
   similarly , spells do n't scale with caster level . 
  though damage cantrips * do * scale with * character * level . 
   no matter how hard the fighter tries , he ca n't fly, 
  unless he 's an eldritch knight , and chooses `` fly '' at level 14 . :p, 
  and while we 're at it , \u00ae is option-r , and \u00a9 is option-g . why it 's g i have no idea , but it ca n't be c because that 's '' \u00e7 '' , which is more common . 
  easy to remember if you use the dvorak keyboard layout , since g is right next to c . if you 're a qwerty pleb , you 're out of luck there . 
  yes , there is . 
  dvorak has the `` dvorak simplified keyboard '' , which is what you 'll find most people mean when they say dvorak , and it 's a two-handed version . 
  but there are also `` left-handed dvorak '' and `` right-handed dvorak . 
  [ here 's what the left-handed version looks like ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:kb_dvorak_left.svg ) . 
  your hand goes with your 5th finger on the left bump , and your second finger on the right bump ( that 's d and e on left-handed dvorak ) . 
  it 's a software change that works absolutely fine on any standard u.s. keyboard . 
  left-handed dvorak is supported on both windows and os x ( and probably linux , i would have to reboot to check ) , so you should be fine . 
  for dndgreentext , you can find the absolute best stories over on the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  some of the stories in the `` long stories '' section are * really * long ( particularly stranded and demigods ) , but they 're totally worth it . 
  might just need to ration out your reading over a few days or something . 
  which is why it should be a class feature , not a spell . 
  though perhaps it could have alternate * types * of marks , similar to the paladin 's `` smite '' spells , which * are * spells . 
  here 's a theory , what if the ranger could * choose * its favoured enemy on a day-by-day basis , in the same way wizards can choose which spells to prepare each day ? 
  i got the idea based on the options from this survey . 
  specifically , that they proposed perhaps the ranger might be able to choose it to apply to one specific enemy each * round * , and they also proposed an idea of it * always * applying , but applying even more to some specific types of enemies . 
  i thought of a sort of compromise between those/alternative idea that could work . 
  you think depriving all sites , even those that have gone through a process of being vetted for ads that are unobnoxious and safe , of their ability to make an income is a good thing ? 
  sites * need * to be able to make money in order to survive , and ads are the * only * good way to do that . 
  so long as they get vetted and marked off as acceptable ( i.e. , no annoying flashy things , popups , autoplay videos other than those that are pre-rolls on actual video content , etc. 
  ) , they 're fine . 
  and do n't be fooled by the talk around adblock 's acceptable ads policy being a paid buy-in . 
  yes , they do require large companies to pay to get put on that list . 
  ** however ** , they * still * require that they * also * meet the standards for acceptable ads . 
  ads are also a democratising force , allowing * anyone * to view the content * for free * , rather than the content being restricted only to those who can afford to pay for it . 
  this sort of thing is why i find the criticisms of the show mythbusters for being unscientific frankly dismissible . 
  what they do is show that something is plausible : that it * could * happen , under the right conditions . 
  that does n't require them to demonstrate repeatibility or use large sample sizes, 
  that image you 've got there is actually from australia , specifically , the state of queensland , which has some absolutely * amazing * laws regarding cyclists . 
  one such law is that cars are * required * to give the cyclist at least 1 m space when they pass ( 1.5 m if the speed limit is over 70 km/h ) . 
  although i do n't recall seeing such a space for cyclists in front of cars at stop signs/lights , at least here in brisbane , bike lanes are far from uncommon . 
   when there is no bike lane , cyclists must ride on the right side of the road , not 1m farther from the curb, 
  is this the law where you live , or what you 're suggesting cyclists should do ? 
  because either way , that 's a really fucking terrible idea . 
  1 m from the gutter is where cars are usually going to be parked , and even if they are n't , too close to the edge of the road is frequently filled with rubbish , sticks , stones , and other things that make it unsafe to ride there . 
  in my state , the law states , `` on roads that are not multi-lane , cyclists must ride as near as practicable to the left-hand side of the road . '', 
  that seems like a good rule , to me . 
  you need to be as far over as possible , but no specific numbers are given because there are too many possible extenuating circumstances . 
   they feel that they own the damn lanes and if you do n't move quick enough you will definitely hear about it or get a look thrown at you . 
  funny , this is the complaint i always hear from cyclists * about * drivers . 
  it 's funny , where i live , i * frequently * hear drivers complaining the * most * about the `` lycra wearing tour de france wannabes '' . 
  these drivers seem to have a hard-on for complaining about people for whom cycling is a hobby and a way to stay in shape far * more * than their hate for regular commuting cyclists . 
  the truth is , you should always ride as far over to the side as is safe . 
  what `` safe '' means depends on a number of factors . 
  always stay `` a door and a little bit more '' ( as the slogan my uni has taken to using says ) away from any parked cars . 
  but also , obviously , stay out of the zone of any sticks or rocks lying on the ground . 
  other than that , stay as far over as possible . 
  if people using the roads in a perfectly legal manner infuriates you , you probably should n't drive . 
  or maybe go get therapy or something , because you clearly need help . 
  we drive on the left in my country , so it 's the equivalent of a law in america saying exactly the same thing , but substitute `` left '' with `` right '' . 
  i got pinged here by a bot because someone mentioned / r/dndgreentext . 
  looks like that person deleted their comment immediately after posting it , but i still got the notification . 
  you might like to cross-post this over there .
