  no , it 's fine . 
  take a look at the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , many of the stories in there ( particularly the `` longer '' ones , but even many of the shorter ones ) are not in the greentext format . 
  it 's just a subreddit for stories about/based on tabletop rpgs . 
  i think the biggest use case for something like this , for someone with full use of both hands , would be to facilitate hand-writing and typing at the same time or in quick succession . 
  personally i do n't find it useful , but i can kinda imagine it might be for someone . 
  it could be removed from being a `` spell '' and still be a spell-like ability . 
  lay on hands and smite are both spell-like abilities , but they are n't actually spells . 
  they 're class features that just happen to behave in a very magical way . 
  yeah , this is why i did n't like their suggestion for it applying to everything , and instead thought of the favoured enemy being one that can simply change on a day-by-day basis , despite only being a * single * ( or small number of ) type of enemy that is favoured at any given time . 
  i would agree with / u/eerongal , this seems a little underpowered . 
  why not add a +1 to a secondary stat ( maybe give the option between wisdom and charisma ) ? 
  but my biggest problem is with the flavour . 
  it does n't have the stuff that made shardminds in 4e so incredibly interesting . 
  instead of being `` logical , emotionally distant , and naive to the ways of the world '' , you have `` some of them '' being `` rational and calculating '' , while others are `` empathetic , timid , or hot-tempered '' . 
  and you completely ignored the idea of them being normally fairly emotionless , but experiencing rare emotions * very * powerfully . 
  `` though they often seem dispassionate , when a strong emotion seizes them , they experience it powerfully . 
  for example , shardminds do n't get annoyed ; they become enraged . '', 
  that 's what made shardminds so interesting . 
  additionally , this has none of the lore surrounding the living gate , and the different philosophies regarding shardminds ' desire to repair it . 
  the conflict that could exist between shard slayers and the other two main schools , especially , was really interesting , and this completely ignores it . 
  love the picture on the first page . 
  kinda neutral towards the top picture on the second page . 
  really do n't like the bottom picture . 
  when you say `` my folder '' , is it a folder of artwork you created , or that you 've found and curated ? 
  because 5.jpg is the official shardmind artwork from phb3 in 4e . 
  the original lore of them in 4e was a lot more interesting and in-depth than this is . 
  if you can , i would highly suggest ... acquiring ... a copy of player 's handbook 3 and having a quick read through it . 
  ninja edit : you know what , i 'll save you the trouble . 
  here 's the flavour text of the original shardminds :, 
  [ page 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ug0gkf9.png ) ( just a brief introduction ), 
  [ page 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcr5tfl.jpg ) ( completes that introduction and goes into more detail about other stuff ) . 
  for what it 's worth , that 's not true with the canon shardminds . 
  not entirely sure why op added that in . 
  to quote phb3 :, 
   shardminds alive today are n't the same ones that sprang to life during the dawn war . 
  shardminds say that the living gate shattered into countless fragments , and each time an awakened shardmind is killed , another one somewhere in the universe stirs to consciousness . 
  there were a couple of other fairly substantial flavour things that op left out . 
  i dunno if it was for the sake of simplicity ( since it requires a lot of extra lore knowledge , like what the dawn war is , what the living gate is , and what the far realm is ) , because op does n't particularly enjoy that part of it , or just a simple oversight , or what . 
  but yeah , i find the flavour in their 4e incarnation far more interesting than what we have here . 
  if you want the rest of it :, 
  * [ page 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ug0gkf9.png ) ( just a brief introduction ), 
  * [ page 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcr5tfl.jpg ) ( completes that introduction and goes into more detail about other stuff ) . 
  i hugely agree with the first point . 
  the second one is actually something i * really * enjoy . 
  it makes playing a first level character * really * *** feel *** like i 'm playing someone who has quite literally just now started adventuring . 
  like i can write a backstory about a sorcerer who only just first realised she has natural magical abilities and is just now starting to try and master them , or a bard who just started playing and realised how much power he can create through his music , and has decided to explore that . 
  low level characters in this edition really feel like true beginners . 
  and , as you say , for people who do n't enjoy that , it 's easy enough to start at a higher level . 
  i definitely agree with you regarding point 3 . 
  but on the other hand , combat in 4e was * slow as hell * , largely because people took so long to make decisions . 
  that 's * not * something i want to bring back . 
  i think that enforcing optional rules in 5e like flanking and creatures providing cover from ranged attacks gives a nice medium between the two extremes . 
  i agree with what you perceive as a problem . 
  but i really , * really * , ** really ** do not want to go down the 3.5 era route of skill points and other needlessly nitpicky complicated maths . 
  i ca n't think of a good solution to the problem , but i 'd much rather keep the problem than go with a solution that makes things ultimately worse overall . 
  how is this the worst part of 5e ? 
  it all sounds fantastic to me . 
  yeah , i think the lycanthrope and vampire templates in the monster manual in 5e are absolutely terrible . 
  way too powerful to even * consider * giving to players . 
  4e 's `` heroes of shadow '' book had a really awesome ( if potentially underpowered ) class of `` vampire '' , which allowed for a progression in vampiric abilities . 
  combined with 5e 's much improved multiclassing system , a system like that could be * really * interesting . 
  the vryloka race was also really cool for a little bit of vampiric flavour without too much power , so i 'd like to see that come into this edition . 
  unless i 've done the maths wrong , even if every single one of the remaining seats goes to the greens or someone * other * than the coalition , the coalition * already * has an absolute majority , does it not ? 
  i 've got ta be honest , i * like * the idea of it being a standard class that can be played from first level . 
  especially if one were playing a vryloka , it makes sense . 
  plus , i had a character concept i really wanted to play that would have necessitated it . 
  plus , there 's no particular reason that one would have to be level 5 , or any other arbitrary number , to be a vampire . 
  all that 's needed is for one to be bitten or otherwise obtain the curse . 
  so i 'm not sure a prestige class would really work . 
   you must finish a short or long rest before using it again, 
  oh god this infuriates me . 
  at the * very * least why could they not just state somewhere early on in the book `` when a feature says ` you must finish a short rest before using it again ' , this means that finishing a long rest also refreshes your ability to use that feature '' , and then from then on , just say short rest . 
  i do n't think using the word `` encounter '' would work , because unlike in 4e , there is n't an implicit assumption in 5e that you take a short rest between every encounter . 
  short rests are way too long for that . 
  they probably * could * use the word `` daily '' if they wanted , though . 
  it seems like [ this link ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) might interest you . 
  someone has put a * lot * of thought into attempting to quantify the differences between races , to help make balancing them better . 
  urgh , i just remembered now ( hours after actually taking the survey ) that they did n't ask anything about saving throws or health !, 
  i thought it was insane that they broke the unspoken rule of 1 strong and 1 weak saving throw proficiency with the ua ranger . 
  i mean , the saves that they chose made sense thematically , but because they 're both `` strong '' saves , they needed to be balanced by something , and they were n't . 
  and going from a d10 to 2d6 makes them insanely tanky . 
  i feel like a d6 + d4 might be better for what they were going for , without overpowering it . 
  depending on the build , that may not even matter at all . 
  if the majority of wizard magic is necromantic , and the damagey stuff ( or healing ) is kept with the cleric 's spells , a low intelligence wo n't have much impact at all . 
  i do n't have my podcatcher 's equivalent of smart speed turned on for similar reasons . 
  but i do listen to most podcasts at high speed ( 2.0 x or more ) . 
  it means you still get the same cadence and rhythm , just sped up . 
  makes for much more natural sounding listening , while still getting through a large amount of podcasts in a relatively short time . 
  they do n't have your passwords at all . 
  it 's all stored on their servers as an encrypted blob , and your password is ( part of ) the key . 
  [ here 's a really good explanation of how it works , and why from a security standpoint , you can absolutely trust them . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/r9q_anb7pwg?t=53m52s ), 
  the only thing to be potentially worried about going forward is that they might change their business model or something . 
  you * do n't * need to worry about them reading all your passwords and stealing them , or anything like that . 
  you * do n't * need to worry about the security of your accounts . 
  lastpass 's security model is absolutely water-tight and they are not getting at your stuff . 
  there 's no need to go through changing all of your passwords . 
  the only thing to be worried about here is them going back on their word and changing their funding model , for example charging way more for premium , and removing the free option , or something like that . 
  [ this video does a really good job of explaining it from ( more or less ) first principles ] ( https://youtu.be/r9q_anb7pwg?t=53m52s ) . 
  basically , they encrypt it first using ( something derived from ) your password as a key .
