  the result of that encryption is just an unreadable `` blob '' which , without the key , is absolutely useless . 
  they do n't have the key , and thus they ca n't access your stuff . 
  it gets decrypted client-side . 
  none of those are sustainable systems for large businesses , and neither do they allow new talent to grow . 
  it only works if someone can get to a * moderate * size first somehow , and then leverage that to get donations . 
  too much smaller and you wo n't be able to get the funding necessary , too much larger and costs are going to be way too high for donations to fully cover it . 
  and you pay for your bandwidth ? 
  that 's great . 
  but irrelevant in this discussion . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with the content that you view . 
  it 's like saying you should be allowed to drive everywhere and anywhere you want for free , because you 've paid for your petrol and rego . 
  but no , toll roads/bridges/tunnels exist , and some places charge for parking . 
  if you do n't want to view ads , you should n't be viewing content that only exists because its creators are supported by the money those ads bring in . 
  your numbers are way off there . 
  $ 1.00 rpm is a very low ad rate . 
  with 10 million ad views at $ 1 rpm , you 'd have received $ 10,000 . 
  hell , even as low as just * one * *** cent *** per thousand , 10 million views is $ 100 , way more than a shirt . 
  and $ 0.01 is a stupidly low rpm . 
  if you 're interested in shardminds , i 'd suggest reading their original lore , op changed quite a lot and imo it weakened them as interesting characters . 
  one of the three main shardmind philosophies is even perfectly designed for evil characters . 
  * [ page 1 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ug0gkf9.png ) ( just a brief introduction ), 
  * [ page 2 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcr5tfl.jpg ) ( completes that introduction and goes into more detail about other stuff ) . 
  all shardminds want to reform the living gate , but that is not , in itself , an evil thing . 
  in fact , the exact opposite is true : reforming the living gate would allow them to completely cut off the far realm 's influence over the world , which is most definitely a good thing . 
  the philosophies just disagree on the best method to accomplish this . 
  not necessarily . 
  wizards has not made any definitive ruling on this either way , yet , and there are good arguments to be made . 
  to copy a few answers from a stack exchange question about whether warforged ( from the eberron unearthed arcana , and which are also living constructs ) could be healed :, 
   warforged are `` living * constructs * '' and states that they are `` constructed '' ( emphasis added ) . 
  as a construct they would not be able to be healed by spells stipulated to not work on constructs . 
  from another perspective they count as `` living creature [ s ] '' , which implies that they would be affected by healing spells , including those that do not work on constructs . 
  unfortunately wizards was not explicit with the rules governing warforged and healing spells , and thus dms will be left as final arbiters for each game that they officiate . 
  and there will likely be people on both sides at every table . 
   the cure wounds spell states `` a creature you touch ... '' ( basic rules v0 .2 , page 86 ) . 
  then again , so do attack spells and equipment . 
   if the dm rules that a warforged is not a `` creature '' then you can happily conclude that your warforged is immune to fireball and disintegrate and so on . 
   my conclusion is that cure spells and healers ' kits work on a warforged . 
   note that the potion of healing says `` a character who drinks ... '' ( basic rules v0 .2 , page 50 ) so they certainly work on a warforged . 
  i would make the extra +1 to wisdom or charisma . 
  that 's more in line with the thematics of the race , and with the mechanics of the original shardminds ( where it was +2 to int and a choice of +2 to wis or cha ) . 
  absolutely . 
  they could change the way their system works by pushing out a silent update that enables this sort of functionality . 
  however , it would get found out * very * quickly , and if you did n't manually re-enter your password before it was found out , they would n't have your stuff . 
  and what do they really have to gain from it ? 
  this is n't some shady russian hacker site . 
  they 're a reputable and very well-known business that has occasionally done some shitty things from a funding perspective , but they 've never done anything remotely close to what you 're suggesting . 
  they have nearly nothing to gain from doing something like that , and * everything * to lose . 
  my group has a divination wizard who also took the lucky feat at level 4 . 
  thankfully , he is n't also a halfling , because that would just be crazy . 
  personally i 'm not a fan . 
  shardspeakers is just lame . 
  where the hell did that even come from ? 
  ca n't speak a language that everyone else can understand ? 
  dumb , and completely not in line with the original race . 
  crystalline mind is a powerful feature , but not quite as fitting lore-wise as psychic resistance . 
  the encounter building maths is way off . 
  i 've run this encounter twice , once with 3 players , and once with 6 ( when it was with six , i added two extra goblins ) . 
  both times the players won the battle easily . 
  with 3 players , they were completely new to d&d , and with 6 , they were new to 5th edition . 
  the problem with the encounter building system is that it assumes you 're going to have about 6 encounters every day , with 2 short rests . 
  unless you 're running a pure dungeon crawl , you 're very unlikely to meet that level of activity . 
  and indeed , there 's no way lost mines gets that much done , except * maybe * in the final mine . 
  so most encounters end up being a lot easier than the encounter building maths would suggest . 
  wait , there 's a difference ? 
  looking at my home folder , i only have ` . bash_profile ` . 
  in your defence , i do n't think * anyone * pronounces euler right when they first see it . 
  out of interest , how did you pronounce centaur ? 
  and basil ? 
  and on the note of archive , i have a similar problem with orchard vs. orchid . 
  i can never remember which has which meaning , or how each is pronounced . 
  and homage vs hommage , same problem ( this one 's made even worse by the fact that some people spell it with one `` m '' regardless of the meaning ) , with whether or not to pronounce the h. 
  oh man , that is just an awesome story . 
  it kinda reminds me of [ this classic one ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21ba53/an _ evil_campaign_gonegood / ) . 
  and speaking of which , you should really consider cross-posting this story to / r/dndgreentext . 
  it 's an incredible story so i 'm sure they 'd love it over there . 
  nah , that 's just a bot that shows up occasionally to convert things to metric . 
  as someone from a country not stuck in the past , i normally really appreciate it , because it puts things into a perspective i can understand . 
  but i see it so frequently in this subreddit where it really does n't matter ( since the game uses imperial/american units as a game mechanic ) , and it 's kinda amusing , really . 
  [ [ 1d20 +8 ] ] roll 1d20 +6 int +2 for proficiency in arcana ( since you did n't actually state what yours should be ) . 
  for what it 's worth , personally i really enjoy puzzles occasionally . 
  my dm gave us a spell scroll that was encrypted with a vigen\u00e8re cipher , using a relatively simple riddle ( but one the dm had come up with himself , so googling was n't an option -- it took a few hours of thinking it through while also playing the game to actually solve the riddle ) providing the key . 
  since the dm and i are both taking a course at university on security , it was really interesting and unique . 
  if we had n't been able to think it through , he would have let us make some sort of roll to get a hint . 
  it is worth noting though , in this case , the thing was n't a chokepoint in the plot ( struggling to think of a more appropriate term to use here , may edit if it comes back to me ) , it was a little side thing . 
  we could continue on with the plot without solving the puzzle . 
  so the situation is slightly different . 
  + / u/rollme, 
  / u/cheeseducksg , you rolled only 13 . 
  you fail to solve the puzzle . 
  you do n't need to write in any particular style . 
  edit : for example , if you see the one i sent you , it 's written just as normal prose , just as yours is . 
  you could quite literally just copy and paste the exact same text you did here and it 'd be fine . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  i 'm an android user , but this comment is so ignorant it 's not funny . 
  apple supports their products with updates for way longer than anyone else . 
  nexi are well known for being among the * longest * supported of android products . 
  i 'm not getting marshmallow , though . 
  3 years after its release , it 's no longer supported . 
  and anyone who bought non-nexus back in 2012 has been unsupported for much longer than i. 
  the iphone 5 is still getting updates .
