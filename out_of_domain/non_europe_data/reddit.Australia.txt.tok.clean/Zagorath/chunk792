  in fact , one generation before that is still getting updates . 
  that 's as far back as 2011 , which means that if the next major release , in late 2016 cuts it off , that phone will have been supported for 5 years . 
  so to criticise apple for not supporting older products is just plain ignorant . 
  they have to stop supporting things at some point , because technology just moves that fast . 
  i just wish he would n't try to be so funny on it , because his comedy ( at least on the crash course videos ) is just so lame . 
  the cc economics people are even worse . 
  just tell me this shit , do n't try to be funny because you 're * not * . 
   while it 's not quite on the level of plane on a treadmill, 
  i still do n't fucking get this one . 
  if you put a plane on a giant treadmill , and the plane was off , and then moved the treadmill , the plane would move back with the treadmill . 
  so why is it any different when you turn the plane on ? 
  just because it generates its forward motion from somewhere other than the wheels , it does n't make sense !, 
   what are the rules for how many traps you should throw at your party ? 
  there are n't any . 
  good . 
  you throw however many makes sense . 
  if they 're going through a cavern inhabited by kobolds , its probably a lot . 
  if it 's some human cultists , probably none at all . 
  there should n't be rules for that : it 's a roleplay thing primarily . 
   how does * magic missile * interact with empowered evocation ? 
  i have n't seen the tweet you mention , but it 's worth noting that some of the tweets are from wizards ' story guy , someone who is well-known for being loose with the rules , and often his stated rulings go against raw . 
  i would trust the errata and just go with that . 
  most people i know pronounce it cent-or . 
   over on / r/dndgreentext posters talk about how players become literal gods in their sessions, 
  one such example is [ this one , titled `` demigods '' ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2k1qjk/demigods _ xpost_gametales / ) . 
  it 's a long read , but incredibly worth it . 
  makes for an epic tale . 
   if you were to place a finger on the plane you 'd find it easy to hold the plane in position with the engine off even if the treadmill was going super fast, 
  wait really ? 
  that 's absolutely fascinating if true !, 
  and that definitely helps explain the treadmill takeoff problem for , finally . 
  so thanks !, 
   our conductor had a little introduction and told the audience that he hates this name and would never call it like this, 
  i love when conductors give little speeches before the performance , about its history or whatever . 
  and i also am very glad that the `` symphony of fate '' moniker seems to have largely fallen out of favour . 
  out of interest , what instrument do you play ? 
  and what did the man play ? 
  ( i 'm assuming you were in the orchestra , since you said `` we were playing '' , and that he was too , since he was `` behind [ your ] seat '' , forgive me if i 'm wrong . ), 
  beethoven 's symphony no. 5 is probably the piece i would choose , too . 
  as long as you do n't refer to it by that other name ( the one americans use ) , it 's all good . 
   in which direction ? 
  that system usually helps one direction and hinders the other . 
  my guess would be ( assuming it 's true ) toward the city in the morning , away from the city in the afternoon/evening . 
  that would seem to be the most efficient system . 
   larger roundabouts ( such as double lane ones ) cause a lot of accidents, 
  smaller roundabouts increase safety quite significantly , and with larger ones the data is actually unclear : it depends on what types of accidents one concentrates on . 
   finally , roundabouts are shitty for cyclists, 
  holy ** fuck ** no . 
  as someone who uses bikes ( in addition to public transport ) as my primary means of transport , roundabouts are ** far ** preferable to lights , or even standard intersections ( with stop signs , yield signs , or no signs ) . 
  crossroad intersections mean i have to cross across traffic to get into the right-hand lane if i want to turn right . 
  and if it 's a crossroad intersection without lights , either going straight or turning right means a hurried scramble to get across before anyone on the perpendicular road arrives . 
  roundabouts are super easy , because you just go with the flow , and cyclists can always stay on the left edge , and then just slip off when they get to their exit . 
  easy as pie . 
  that said , i agree with you regarding lights on major intersections . 
  they took out the roundabout at the entrance to uq a couple of years ago and replaced it with lights . 
  it 's definitely been an improvement to traffic flow . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what you mean , could you elaborate ? 
  ah , that would explain it . 
  i was using os x. 
  so , after reading the other comments in here ( including the ones that revealed the correct answer ) , here 's how my logic goes :, 
  as / u/gazzien says , note 2 refers to red , and note 3 refers to green . 
  that means 1 has to be blue . 
  so either 2 is lying , or 3 is lying , but so far , none of the information is sufficient to tell which ( please , op , let me know if i 'm missing something here , or misinterpreting something ) . 
  if 2 is lying , then red is * not * going to kill me , it is actually the safe option . 
  if 3 is lying , that it * will * kill me , and it is not safe . 
  however , if 2 is lying , then 3 must be truthful . 
  that means that * both * are safe . 
  if 3 is lying , then * neither * is safe . 
  so i drink the blue potion , knowing that at the least , it is not going to kill me . 
  in any scenario . 
  i get told what blue tells me . 
  that does n't help me narrow down the options at all . 
  unfortunately , op , as far as i can see , this is a technically unsolvable puzzle . 
  i ca n't see any use of logic that can deduce a definitive answer to it , and in the end the character is going to be forced to make a guess . 
  additionally , from the responses to people who have guessed red or green , my deductions are incorrect . 
  could you explain exactly what the correct process to solving this is , because either i 'm missing something , or the puzzle is logically incorrect . 
  i have n't used it myself , but that 's because when i 've looked at it , it looks like an absolute pain . 
  completely unintuitive and not easy to work with at all . 
  but that 's not from personal experience , just from reading their website . 
  double lane roundabouts are fine , because ( at least in queensland ) cyclists can stay in the left lane even if turning right , so it 's exactly the same as single-lane roundabouts for a cyclist , even if it may be different for drivers . 
  i 've never come across a multiple roundabout intersection . 
  is that like [ this roundabout in the uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d22boogbpfm ) ? 
  i did n't even know we had that sort of thing here . 
   but man i 'm just a butthurt pc police right ? 
  yes you are . 
  i 've lived in asia , and the asians and half-asians i 've known who were actually from there have never been offended by this kind of thing . 
  in fact , they really enjoy it , and tell these kinds of jokes themselves . 
  for some reason it 's only people whose ancestors were from asia ( or another place ) but who themselves have grown up in america ( or another western country ) that get offended by these things . 
  in america , what we call `` tomato sauce '' , they call `` ketchup '' . 
   except either red or green does n't actually do that, 
  yeah this is the problem i have with it . 
  assuming blue is true , then one of red or green has to be lying . 
  that means that in the table below , either the first or second row must be the one we 're lying in . 
  and there 's no way to tell which one it is . 
  ( third and fouth rows included just for completeness . 
  according to the 1st card , neither of those two rows can be the correct one . ), 
  | red | green, 
  red is lying | safe | safe, 
  green is lying | death | death, 
  neither is lying | death | safe,
