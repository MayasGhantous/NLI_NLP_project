  both are lying | safe | death, 
  i feel like this gesture would be a great one on a touch screen , but doing it with the mouse is really awkward . 
  and yet it was introduced with vista , long before touch screens became as commonplace as they are today . 
  you know what , i think you 've solved it !, 
  from comments op made elsewhere , when you drink the blue one , you get * told * that the death one does n't kill you . 
  i was interpreting this as it just being a matter of `` well , it says it brings death , but that 's just a metaphor '' . 
  but if you were to instead interpret that as being `` i 'm telling you red is the liar '' , then you have a solution . 
  it * has * to be green . 
  it 's not metallic enough ( too `` wooden '' a sound ) to be glocks , and not really `` full '' enough ( sounds too thin ) to be marimba . 
  so my guess is it 's a full orchestral xylophone , played near the top register . 
  it could also be a marimba though . 
  are there glocks elsewhere in the score , perchance ? 
  i would guess it 's a xylophone over glocks , but i would n't rule out the latter entirely . 
  not in australian english , they are n't . 
  damn , that sucks ... 
  in that case , i kinda do n't understand the point of it . 
  it 's a cool idea , but it 's too difficult and awkward to execute , and what it accomplishes is n't even * that * useful . 
  the tweet has been deleted . 
  what did it say ? 
  i do n't know if there 's some sort of exception in this case , but my understanding is that according to australian consumer law , the onus is on the * seller * to make sure that a product is of the quality a consumer could reasonably expect , and to fix the problem if not . 
   goods must be of ` acceptable quality ' . 
  acceptable quality is defined in section 54 ( 2 ) of the acl such that goods are of acceptable quality if they are :, 
   * fit for all the purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly supplied ;, 
   * acceptable in appearance and finish ;, 
   * free from defects ;, 
   * safe ; and, 
   * durable . 
   this definition is subject to a ` reasonable consumer ' test , such that goods are considered to meet those standards if a reasonable consumer , who is fully acquainted with the state and condition of the goods , would regard them as acceptable . 
   in determining whether goods are of ` acceptable quality ' , a number of issues need to be considered : the nature of the goods , the price of the goods ( if relevant ) , any statement made about the goods on any packaging or label on the goods , any representation made about the goods by the supplier or manufacturer of the goods and any other relevant circumstances relating to supply of the goods . 
  and it goes on like that . 
  [ [ source ] ] ( http://www.consumerlaw.gov.au/content/the_acl/downloads/acl_guide_to_provisions_november_2010.pdf ), 
  additionally :, 
   statutory consumer guarantees eliminate the need for consumers to understand contract law in order to enforce their rights . 
  any failure made by ** a supplier ** of a statutory consumer guarantee is directly enforceable as a breach of the acl, 
  emphasis mine . 
  additionally :, 
   the retailer who sold you the product or service can not refuse to help you by sending you to the manufacturer or importer . 
  [ [ source ] ] ( https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/consumer-rights-guarantees/repair-replace-refund#approaching-the-retailer-or-manufacturer ), 
  there 's also some stuff about goods being supplied `` by reference to a sample '' , which might apply ( i do n't know ) . 
  so the important question here , from a legal standpoint , is whether or not having this software on it would be considered to be unfit for purpose . 
  ianal , so i do n't know whether that is the case or not , but it 's certainly worth investigating further . 
  cheers !, 
  i 'm a little surprised to see kriesler , cpe bach , kapustin , and scott on that list . 
  not that they are n't great composers , but they 're hardly the sort of composer most people would normally start with . 
  and i was surprised to see tchaikovsky not on the list . 
  his ballets , symphonies , piano concertos , and 1812 overture are some of the most well-known pieces of music , and for very good reason . 
  / u/kelmhill 's and / u/noodlenonger 's advice is great , so i wo n't retread what they said . 
  but if you 're interested in some more detail ( though i 'll try and explain everything from first principles , so you do n't have to feel lost ) about how different pieces are structured , and what some of the terminology is , i 'll try and explain some stuff for you . 
  but i 'm not sure how much you want , and i could go on about this for days , so i 'll save any more detailed stuff for if you ask . 
  that said , the most important thing is just to * enjoy * it !, 
  i find there 's a lot of exciting stuff to be had in analysing music in at least a really shallow way , but not everyone does . 
  you can perfectly well just listen to pieces that you like and never think about it any further , if you do n't want to . 
  i would recommend listening to all or most of the pieces that make up the `` top 100 '' and `` top 200 '' on [ this list ] ( http://kickassclassical.com//classical-music-popular-famous-best-top-100-list.html ) , because they 're pieces you 'll mostly have heard small parts of before , but to hear the whole thing in their original context can provide a much greater depth . 
  from that list , one * slightly * less obvious one that i would point out is [ `` bol\u00e9ro '' , by ravel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk23bheqvyu ) . 
  this piece is interesting because it repeats the same melody over and over and over again for about 16 minutes , but with different instruments and combinations of instruments . 
  it 's basically a study in `` timbre '' ( which literally means `` colour '' , and is used to describe the different sounds of different instruments and combinations of instruments , like how if you play a `` c '' on a piano it sounds different to a `` c '' on a guitar ) . 
  for a similar reason , i would recommend benjamin britten 's `` young person 's guide to the orchestra '' ( which begins in [ this video ] ( https://youtu.be/dxdjca3s9fu?t=5m4s ) at about 5:04 , with narration in english explaining the instruments , and continues into [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhidud68-am ) ) , which is a great introduction to the different instruments of the orchestra . 
  it can be really fun to pick out which instrument is which when listening to a full beethoven symphony or rachmaninov piano concerto . 
  please do n't hesitate to ask if you want to know more about anything , or just some more information in general . 
  helping new people get the same enjoyment out of classical music is the main reason i joined this subreddit , and it 's been fairly quiet on that front as of late . 
  edit : just gon na add some links in here to a few of my favourite other pieces, 
  * [ beethoven symphony no. 5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jh-e5m01wy ) ( aka `` duh duh duh duuuuuhhhhh '' ), 
  * [ beethoven symphony no. 9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoh_h6yxgii ) -- well known for the `` ode to joy '' theme in its fourth movement , and for one of its movements ( i think 3 , but it might have been 2 ) being included in windows xp by default, 
  * [ tchaikovsky 's 1812 overture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufcpvuqz-6g ) -- known among americans for being played around the 4th of july , known to everyone else for its cannons , and for being based on the war between russia and france in 1812 ( and as such , you 'll hear very heavy use of the french theme `` la marseillaise '' , and the russian theme `` god save the tsar '' ), 
  * [ dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's symphony no. 9 `` from the new world '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuqyfeynxqo ) -- this one has had its themes used all over the place . 
  if you 're british , you 'll recognise the second movement from an ad for bread , i think , but its been in a lot of other ads . 
  it 's been used in the `` civilization '' series of games . 
  the opening to the 4th movement bears a striking resemblance to john williams ' theme for the movie `` jaws '' . 
  * [ mozart 's clarinet concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_gm0ncabps ) . 
  it would be remiss of me not to link at least one piece for my own instrument , so here it is . 
  it was used in a fairly pivotal scene in `` the king 's speech '' . 
  ( other pieces used in that movie worth listening to include [ the marriage of figaro 's overture ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_gm0ncabps ) and [ beethoven symphony no. 7 , 2nd mvt . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uoxogm5jq4 ) , the latter of which was used during * the * titular `` king 's speech '' . ), 
  * [ adagio for strings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrmz8fkkg2g ) , which has been called the `` saddest piece of music ever '' . 
  it has also ( as i discovered just now in googling for that link ) been ~ ~ ripped off ~ ~ remixed by [ dj tiesto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tign7eicn4 ) . 
  * [ toccata and fugue in d minor ( probably by bach , but we 're not actually sure ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fxoyr_fyfw ) . 
  also known as `` that epic piece of dark organ music '' . 
  * [ gershwin 's rhapsody in blue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch2ph0autuu ) . 
  that slide at the start there on the clarinet is a really advanced technique , and really damn awesome , in my opinion !, 
  this is a heavily jazz-inspired piece , as most of gershwin 's work is . 
   show the idea that jazz and classical are pretty easily linked together, 
  surely that 's why gershwin is in there !, 
  but yeah , there 's definitely nothing wrong with getting someone started on a couple of lesser-known composers . 
  i definitely do n't think anyone on the list is too extreme for a beginner ( though some of bartok 's works might push it a bit ) , so it 's all good . 
  if you see [ elsewhere in the thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dungeonsanddragons/comments/3o66sz/a_new_dd_puzzle_id_like_to_try/cvvmniq?context=2 ) , someone else helped me uncover what could be a definitive explanation for why this puzzle works . 
  i 'm not entirely convinced about it ( in particular , i do n't know if that 's actually what you were * going for * , but if it * was * the exact solution you were working on , then it 's a perfect solution , though perhaps some tweaking to make it clear that blue is informing you that red is * lying * , rather than being metaphorical would be useful ) , but it 's definitely a workable solution . 
  in php/php devs ' defence , it 's a language primarily used for web development . 
  those others , especially c , c++ , shell , and markdown , are far less often used for web development , so even if the devs were dumb enough to that kind of thing , they would n't , because they are n't working in an environment where it even makes sense . 
  i would think it 's autocorrect on a keyboard . 
  that would be more likely to get corrected to `` was '' than `` a w s '' would , spoken aloud . 
  oh wow , thanks for that . 
  i had no idea what was going on there ... 
  did anyone else get some sort of weird notice about how google uses cookies or something from that ? 
  has google recently changed their policies regarding user data or something ? 
   any conventional sense of morality is dissipated quickly . 
  without trying to sound like an obnoxious dick : a post-modern relativism of morality is really at the practical forefront of the job ; and you soon lose any artefact of conventional morality . 
  mmm hmmm . 
  i know some of these words . 
  on a serious note , i like them for what i feel they could have been , and for what the filmmakers were * trying * to do . 
  i think the last act of episode iii was actually really damn fantastic .
