  marriage ceremonies tend to be pretty quick , anyway . 
  it 's the reception , photos , and other stuff that tends to take a while . 
  i would have linked the episode , but i 'm on mobile so finding the right one would be tricky . 
  i would n't count on it . 
  why should the person who got a grand total of +1 be punished for being unlucky ? 
  it 's about being fair to everyone . 
  randomness , but within certain limitations to keep anyone from upstaging everyone else , or from one person being overshadowed by everyone else . 
  that said , with a role that was too good , but just * slightly * too good , i might allow it if they manually dropped a couple of stats . 
  for example , i had a 17 , 16 , 13 , 13 , 13 , 12 , or something like that . 
  my dm let me drop two 13s to 8 and 10 and keep that . 
  ( i also put that 17 -- 18 after the racial bonus -- into intelligence , as a warlock , so i was deliberately not optimally built . ), 
  ultimately , it 's about finding a happy medium between the advantages of randomness ( characters that can be spread in more unique and interesting ways than point buy would allow or -- more importantly -- than point by users would likely come up with ) and the advantages of point buy ( good balance between characters ) . 
  that 's just my perspective on it , though . 
  other people disagree , and that 's totally cool . 
  i 'll speak regarding my answer on swords . 
  i answered that question largely as a joke . 
  i do n't normally do that , but this time it just seemed appropriate . 
  plus , swords are just so damn awesome . 
  who would n't want to return to a time when we could solve personal disputes with a gentlemanly duel to first blood ? 
  ( especially with modern medicine , there 'd be next to no deaths ! ), 
  i kid , of course , but it 's cool as a fantasy . 
  they both look fine to me ... 
  that sounds an awful lot like [ this very awesome tale ] ( https://reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2z089p/drow_visits_the_surface/ ) . 
  seeing more people imitate the conceit of that story is actually pretty awesome in its own right . 
  is there a chance he wrote the story ? 
  not a fan of anim\u00e9 , but thanks anyway . 
  lol sure . 
  i would n't recommend it though . 
  that thing would be crazy unwieldy . 
  grab a trusty rapier or something . 
  they ca n't check what data it 's requesting , because it 's located overseas where they do n't have the authority . 
  i probably would have gone with something that does see modern use , like pepper spray or stun guns , but yeah , i get the idea . 
  and certainly i would say i more or less agree with what i put anyway . 
  it was just difficult to express nuance in such a black and white survey , which is unfortunately the way these surveys kinda have to be designed . 
   [ crossbows ] are already prohibited and have little cultural value as collectibles, 
  how dare you deny my family 's long tradition of vampire hunters !, 
  i am * offended * !, 
  it was passed down to me by my great-great grandfather . 
  thanks . 
  this is the first time i 've seen this john cena thing in a non-textual format . 
  it 's been stupid every fucking time i 've seen it , including this one . 
  bro , museums are for things that have cultural or historical value . 
  it 's clich\u00e9d as fuck , but i have to go with the [ mozart ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_gm0ncabps ) . 
  listening to the [ second movement ] ( https://youtu.be/o_gm0ncabps?t=12m10s ) closely one time on an aeroplane is what made me first really fall in love with the clarinet , after i had already been playing for quite a few years . 
  if you got a c in add . 
  maths you 're probably about on par for a 4 in hl maths . 
  an a \\* in the normal extended maths , i assume ? 
  that 's how i did , a \\* in extended maths , and then a b in add . 
  maths , followed up with a 5 in hl . 
  other than that , your igcses were probably better than mine . 
  i 'm sure as long as you put in the effort , you 'll do fine . 
  really simple technique . 
  it 's just two photos i took on my nikon d3100 and a 16 mm wide-angle lens . 
  threw them into photoshop , made it do an `` auto align layers '' , then i created a gif out of them , and set it to automatically interpret an extra 2 frames between the two original images . 
  i certainly believe that given proper measures , controlled euthanasia should be permitted . 
  most notably , the sufferer should have expressed in some legal manner their desire to be euthanised at a stage when there were of completely sound mind . 
  for example , before , or * immediately * after receiving a diagnosis for a degenerative disease . 
  they must also either still express this wish , or be unable to express any desire whatsoever , at the time that the euthanasia would take place . 
  importantly , i do * not * think that the wishes of the family should be able to overrule the wishes of the patient . 
  if a patient has expressed a wish to be euthanised , the family should not be able to decide not to go ahead with it . 
  and similarly , a patient who has never expressed a wish to be euthanised should never end up being euthanised on the wishes of their family or doctors . 
  member for brisbane & surrounds, 
  these opinions do not necessarily represent that of any political party or organisation with which i may be affiliated . 
  hahaha that 's hilarious !, 
   if you are letting people reroll to get something more normalised , why not just use point buy ? 
  i answered this in the penultimate paragraph . 
  basically , you do n't know whether you 'll roll the standard array exactly , or an 18 and a bunch of scores between 8 and 12 , or an 18 , a 16 , a 6 , two 8s , and a couple between 10 and 12 . 
  a lot of those are n't even * options * with point buy . 
  plus , i 'll admit that at least some of my decision to try out rolled stats to begin with was because on average you get better scores than point buy . 
  you know that you can still use the arrow keys to move around in vim , right ? 
  i never understood why anyone would use the letters -- hjkl , is it ? 
  how do you remember which is which ? 
  super inefficient and unintuitive . 
  the way it uses symbols like ^ and $ for similar meanings to what they have in regular expressions is intuitive and clever . 
  for res , i 'm just glad j and k stay next to each other . 
  and in fact , res becomes easier to use , since a , j , and k can all be easily reached by one hand , whereas before , voting and navigating would require two hands . 
  i 'll just be glad if this means i no longer get those terrible tpg ads telling me that they were ranked the fastest netflixers . 
   vim is a bottomless pit but you learn to enjoy the fall, 
  haha i love this description !, 
  lol what ? 
  have you ever even * looked at * 4e or 5e ? 
  in 4e wizards are controllers . 
  admittedly , they 're absolutely restricted to that role , but they 're about controlling the battlefield , not blasting enemies . 
  they deal lower amounts of damage to a wide range of enemies , or movie enemies into places that are preferable for the party , or decrease their chances of hitting . 
  and 5e wizards can be built however you want them to be . 
  my group has one who 's built entirely around illusions and divination-style spells . 
  i 've also played with a necromancer who used at least half his spell slots outside of combat on utility applications . 
  to be precise , sydney , melbourne , and brisbane [ make up 50 % of the country 's population ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_cities_in_australia_by_population ) . 
  the top 10 cities get you to almost 3/4 of the population . 
  it 's not possible to edit a link after it 's been posted . 
  in the future , you should know that when linking to posts on reddit , you should always add `` np . '', 
  in front of the link ( replacing the `` www . '', 
  if that 's there ) . 
  additionally , it can be useful to add some context , so add '' ? context = 3 '' ( or whatever number of posts above the main post you feel is necessary , but 3 is generally a good number ) to the end of the link . 
  my warlock has played * very * similar to this idea , except that rather than explicitly `` slowly seducing '' me to the dark side through the ben franklin effect/foot-in-the - door technique , i 've played it up as a sort of dark energy that i gain simply by using my warlock powers . 
  as in , just * being * a warlock gradually turns you evil , in a way . 
  though my patron does very much encourage more evil acts ( in a way , growing my character my evil in a sort of pavlovian type way , where the only actual reward is verbal encouragment ) , he has n't explicitly * asked * me to do anything thus far ( and he has provided suggestions for paths to take when we 've been at a crossroads and i have n't already had my own mind clearly made up ) . 
  also i have a feeling that our next session ( or two ) might be my `` killing younglings '' moment ... 
  which should be interesting . 
  though in my case they totally brought it upon themselves .
