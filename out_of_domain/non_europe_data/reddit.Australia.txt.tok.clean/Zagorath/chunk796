  i do n't know what country you 're in , so i wo n't comment on your local news . 
  but personally , when i 'm travelling , i actually far prefer cnn international over bbc world . 
  bbc seems to spend like 60 % of their time doing dramatic count downs to the next programme . 
  with cnn you get way more actual content . 
  not that i can comment . 
  my country relaunched and scaled back their international channel dramatically recently , so it barely exists any more ... 
  i found [ this review ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a26jhkishja ) to be really good . 
  it tells you not only exactly what pieces of content the dmg contains , but also gives reviews of different components of it , as well as the book on the whole . 
  the only thing wrong about this comment is the claim that * 5e * `` did away with ... mechanical implications of alignment '' . 
  5e brought that improvement forward from 4e , it did n't introduce it itself . 
  everything else is spot on . 
   wotc got rid of level draining stuff, 
  wait , the game used to have actual effects in-game that drained levels ? 
  that 's really damn shitty ... is that some dumb thing they got rid of after 1st edition or something ? 
   recipocity , or , a big chunk of software, 
  man , she fucked up so bad i did n't even realise she was talking about `` repository '' until like 20 seconds in to the video ... 
  zenmate * is * a vpn . 
  says so right on [ their front page ] ( https://zenmate.com/ ) . 
  it 's just a free one that works in the browser . 
   it 's beautiful and odd for sibelius to make something so romantic, 
  why is that ? 
  sibelius is a very typical late-romantic composer , with rich chords , high expressivity , and great use of dynamic all being very integral to his composing style . 
  agree completely . 
  a while back nearly every humble bundle was a no-brainer . 
  they were all so good , with the ability to get a bunch of fantastic games at dirt-cheap prices . 
  who * would n't * do it ? 
  these days i 've never heard of any of them , and most of the time i do n't really want them based on the brief summary they give you . 
  that said :, 
   i do n't have time for audio books, 
  that 's a really weird thing to say . 
  the biggest advantage of audiobooks is that virtually everyone * does * have time for them , whereas a lot of people do n't have time ( or do n't make time ) to read physical books . 
  you can listen while commuting , while shopping , while cooking , while eating ( if you live and/or eat alone ) . 
  all times where you would otherwise be doing a single relatively mundane task , but you can enliven it by listening to a book . 
  the only reason one * would n't * have time to listen to audiobooks would be if you listen to an insane amount of podcasts that there 's no left over time for anything extra . 
  i agree with you , i just do n't really see why you needed to point that out in here . 
  now that 's absolutely fair . 
  it 's just a very different reason to `` i do n't have time '' . 
  yeah , to be honest , my first thought when i saw the title was, 
   congrats op , today you learnt about possibly the most well-known atrocity to have occurred since world war ii, 
  not that that 's necessarily a problem . 
  plenty of obvious and well-known things slip through everyone 's cracks from time to time . 
  but i just do n't think one needs to post that kind of obvious thing that they happened to not know about on a subreddit like this . 
   i assume this is your first game as a dm, 
  from the fact that op specifically said `` first * homemade * campaign '' , i would assume otherwise . 
   will never get a mine on the first click, 
  windows ' minesweeper has this , too ( unless you tell it you want to reply the same as the previous map ) . 
  it * does n't * have the guaranteed solvability ( that is , without guessing ) quality , though . 
  nope , unless it * specifically * says so , the spell component is * not * consumed or used up by the spell . 
  this is particularly important with spells like `` identify '' , which point out the requirement for a specific value of an item ( in that case , a pearl worth 100 gold ) . 
  spell foci and component pouches do n't negate the need to actually have that component with that specific value . 
  however , you only need to buy the component * once * , because it is n't used up . 
  other spells * do * mention that the component is consumed , such as resurrection , which consumes a diamond worth at least 1,000 gold . 
  it 's a show called silicon valley , which follows a tech startup in the eponymous valley . 
  here , the founder of the company is minor spoiler warning trying to negotiate naming rights with the older guy , since he found out the older guy already had a company registered under the same name . 
  definitely good advice for anyone . 
  that might be true , i ca n't say what everyone knows . 
  though i would have thought the killing of academics and glass wearers was their * most * famous bit , * maybe * just behind the baby killing . 
  the series i 'm reading at the moment is an audible frontiers recording , and the narrator is fantastic , except that he pronounces both `` fungi '' and `` sigil '' with the wrong type of `` g '' . 
  it 's really bizarre . 
  i thought that there was an implied `` bad '' in the phrase `` pardon my language '' . 
  that is , you 're implying that you mean `` pardon my bad language '' . 
  the easiest way would be to not do it at the browser level , but at the operating system level . 
  textexpander is really awesome on os x , and phraseexpress seems like a pretty good one for windows . 
  ~ ~ well , material components are still required . 
  so for spells that use those , i would imagine the spell comes directly out of the arcane focus or the components that have been drawn from the component pouch . ~ ~, 
  see below . 
  ~ ~ op asked about the source of the spell . 
  most of the iconic spells * do * visibly start from the source . 
  fireball , for example , says `` a bright streak flashes from your pointing finger '' . 
  fire bolt says `` you hurl a mote of fire '' . 
  magic missile , ray of frost , acid splash , and many more spells also have a definite source . 
  for other spells , it does n't make sense to talk about a `` discernible source '' , which is what op wanted to know about . ~ ~, 
  see below . 
  ah , yes , good point . 
  i retract my former statement . 
  i have a slightly off topic question . 
  it 's about the '' ** magic resistance ** '' feature , which you 've used here , but i was looking through the mm and noted a few creatures that have it in there , too . 
  it gives advantage on saving throws against spells , but it confers no bonus against spells which require the attacker to make a to-hit roll with their spells . 
  how does that work from a thematic perspective ? 
  obviously it 's useful mechanically because it means players wo n't actually know that the creature has advantage , whereas if you told them to roll attacks with disadvantage , they 'd quickly work it out . 
  but how does one justify this within the lore of the game ? 
  any chance of a how to ? 
  the biggest oversight ? 
  nay , it was the smartest thing they ever did . 
  because it 's ambiguous and people can take it to mean whatever they want , virtually * anyone * can be construed to have morals in line with that religion . 
  and if someone can be shown that their morals would not have to change in order to convert , well , they 're far more likely to convert . 
  a couple of things about that . 
  wizards has already broken that rule with the mystic ( wisdom and their choice of the day ) and the variant ranger ( dexterity , wisdom ) . 
  as / u/laserguidedherpes says , there 's a pretty decent chance that they 're going to try to strengthen the weaker saves . 
  to be honest , this would ( imo ) by the absolute ideal situation , as it would make a greater variety of classes to be viable . 
  as it stands currently , the 1 strong , 1 weak save is not a * rule * , it 's an * implicit guideline * ( not even a guideline that 's been explicitly stated anywhere , it 's just been implied by all the classes in the phb ) . 
  breaking it is absolutely fine , but it should be taken into account when balancing the class : the class 's other features should be slightly weaker to compensate . 
  like how mountain dwarves break the +2 to one ability and +1 to another rule , but their class features * other * than that are not as strong , to compensate . 
  so if the theme of the class absolutely demands two strong saves , go with it : just make sure to balance it out well . 
  oh man , this just made me think ... with hallowe'en coming up , i kinda wish they 'd made this month 's ua article a ravenloft unearthed arcana , like the first one was eberron . 
  maybe we can hope for that first thing * after * hallowe'en ? 
  i 've got ta be honest , as a fan of classical music and of film and television soundtracks , i * do * find most video game soundtracks to be lackluster . 
  it 's very rare that i find a game soundtrack that i want to download and listen to outside of the game . 
  they rarely have well-defined themes and leitmotifs , and for the most part the music is just there to set the mood , it ca n't stand on its own . 
  i think this is an unfortunate consequence of the medium .
