  what makes the medium brilliant in every other way , means that composers ca n't write music exactly to the scene , and know who is going to be where , doing what , when . 
  it makes the composer 's job a lot tougher than in film and telivision . 
  that said , there are a few rare exceptions to this , and there are a ** lot ** of games where the `` main theme '' ( or one or two other themes ) is ( are ) totally awesome , and the main theme seems to be what orchestras most often play . 
  the one time this has been relevant in my group , i quickly ran the numbers on it . 
  acceleration on our earth is 9.81 ms ^ ( -2 ) . 
  you can decide whether your fictional world has the same , greater , or less than that . 
  the formula you 'll want is s = ut + ( 1/2 ) at ^ 2, 
  * s is the distance ( you 'll want to use metres ), 
  * t is time ( use seconds ), 
  * a is acceleration ( use ms ^ ( -2 ) or `` metres per second squared '' ), 
  * u is the * initial * speed ( in ms ^ ( -1 ) , or `` metres per second '' ) . 
  if you 're flying perfectly horizontally , u will be 0 . 
  if you 're flying down slightly , it 'll be positive , if you 're flying upwards slightly , it 'll be negative . 
  assuming 0 vertical speed to start with , the formula becomes s = ( 1/2 ) at ^ 2, 
  rearrange that to get the time , and you can find out how long it will take to fall . 
  t = sqrt ( 2s/a ), 
  note that this ignores friction ( air resistance ) , but unless they 're falling from so high that they almost reach terminal velocity , it 's probably good enough . 
  you can find what their speed will be when they land ( ignoring air resistance ) by using v ^ 2 = u ^ 2 + 2as, 
  variables mean the same as above , with v being the * final * velocity . 
  if the result of that is less than about 175 km/h ( terminal velocity when spread-eagled is 200 ) , the above results are good enough . 
  if falling legs or head first , terminal velocity is about 250 . 
  edit : added in units, 
  except they do n't have the excuse that they drank the crazy juice .

  [ this would be the one ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dsor5/the _ wizard_who_destroyed_all_psions / ) , from the last time it was submitted here . 
  as others have said , it 's both . 
  what level are you ? 
  usually a +2 weapon would not be given out until at least level 10 or so , and even then it 's an extremely powerful weapon that would be given out rarely . 
  i 'm curious , it looks like you have the 4e psionic power supplement , but you do n't have the player 's handbook 3 ( which contains most of the base psionic stuff ) . 
  is there a particular reason for that ? 
  most countries do n't `` officially '' recognise taiwan because they want to maintain good diplomatic relations with the people 's republic . 
  in virtually every country , however , taiwan is recognised in a variety of unofficial ways . 
  trade with taiwan is very significant , and most countries even have de facto embassies in taiwan , with similar de facto embassies of taiwan in other countries ( they just ca n't call them `` embassies '' , to maintain that line of not `` officially '' recognises the republic of china ) . 
  they have participated in every olympics ( even the beijing ones ) since 1984 , and their passports are recognised virtually worldwide . 
  china `` owns '' taiwan only in the most naive sense of the word . 
  that depends . 
  are you redditing from in gaol ? 
  if not , then yes , you 're doing it right . 
  just a small nitpick , that was n't a dinosaur . 
  there actually are n't any flying or purely aquatic dinosaurs . 
  instead , the best term to refer to them is `` marine reptile '' ( or , for the pterosaurs , `` flying reptiles '' ) . 
   also , victor frankenstein was not a doctor, 
  wait really ? 
  that actually * is * news to me !, 
  you should have made * that * your submission . 
  youtube suggested [ this video , sir simon rattle : ideal sequence in beethoven 's symphony cycle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzrtmrc-si ) as a next video to watch . 
  it was also very worth watching . 
  does anyone know if there 's more videos like these ?

  wizards themselves have released a simplified edition . 
  [ it 's called monster slayers ] ( https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/monsterslayers ) . 
  the base race is about a score of +4.0 . 
  the forest subrace is about +2.0 , and the desert subtype is about +2.5 . 
  so the race goes from 6.0-6 .5 . 
  that 's about the right level to aim for .

   if your dm is cool with playtest material, 
  the upcoming sword coast adventures guide will include a finalised version of the swashbuckler . 
  so in less than a month it 'll be an option even without needing to go playtest . 
  member for brisbane & surrounds, 
  you can turn that off once per computer and it stays off . 
  i do wish it were an account-wide setting , but at least it does work so if you do n't like it , you can get rid of it . 
  well , there 's [ this calculator ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) for working out how strong races are . 
  you 'd generally want to aim between about 4.5 and 6.5 , though a couple of official races go to 7 or even 8 . 
  i 'd generally recommend erring on the side of caution though , and going underpowered rather than overpowered , when building your own race , so try to cap it at 6.5 . 
  backgrounds are so simple to make that you do n't really need any implicit guidelines . 
  just follow the official guidelines of 2 skill proficiencies and 2 of either tool proficiencies or languages . 
  give a small amount of equipment that 's mostly only for roleplay purposes , and a feature that , likewise , wo n't be too much mechanical benefit . 
  archetypes are relatively straightforward . 
  just look at the archetypes that already exist for the class you 're building it on , and provide features of roughly equal power at the same levels . 
  mixing and matching abilities between already existing archetypes could be one way to start out with that , though do try to look out for ways in which these combinations could be unexpectedly powerful . 
  classes are much harder to make . 
  i would say stay away from them until you 've got a heap of experience homebrewing other stuff and feel comfortable doing that in a balanced way . 
  that said , when you 're getting into it , look at the official classes , like at the modifying classes unearthed arcana , and look at other sources . 
  one of the most important things is to have a single primary class scaling ability . 
  rogues get sneak attack which increases as they level ; barbarians have their rages ; spellcasters get ever increasing spell slots ; etc. 
  make sure your class has something like that , preferably something very much linked to the themes of the class . 
  and always try to get feedback from others when possible . 
  / r/unearthedarcana is a great place to go for that , as well as trying it out in real life with friends . 
  edit : just found [ this ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gr9yftbxj2mmz0vykdvqizqwktw9iodpztefjshl1zo/edit ) from the same guy that does the race calculator . 
  could be useful for classes . 
  the fun thing about the png file is that its creator named it as such specifically because he wanted something with a less ambiguous pronunciation than gif . 
  he wanted it pronounced `` ping '' . 
  the letter `` g '' has two sounds . 
  soft g and hard g. c is the same , soft c ( which is the same as `` s '' ) and hard c ( the same as `` k '' ) . 
   the g sound is like in gee, 
  you realise that this would almost without a doubt be pronounced with a soft g , right ? 
  but you seemed to be trying to use it to represent a hard g. 
  first of all , the word you 're going for is `` zhaif '' . 
  `` jyfe '' would not * quite * be pronounced the same as zhaif . 
  second of all . 
  just no . 
  soft or hard g `` gif '' are both fine . 
  but this dumb attempt at appeasement mike from idea channel came up with is inane and stupid . 
  it * is * a `` wrong '' pronunciation .
