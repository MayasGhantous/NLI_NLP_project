  1 year `` see if he got back with that '', 
  you should probably let your dm know that a +2 weapon is insanely strong for such a low level character . 
  it 'll give him trouble balancing encounters . 
   from nonmagical weapons that are n't adamantine, 
  so , i know that 's the same wording used in the mm for the existing golems . 
  but i wonder , how does one get adamantine ? 
  the mm also says that drow weapons are typically made of adamantine , so if a player was a drow , would you rule that the weapons they had at the start of the game were made of it ? 
  or perhaps if they had fought some drow and looted their weapons ? 
  there are n't any actual specific rules regarding this , so i 'm just wondering how people would play it . 
  perhaps it 'd be similar to silvering weapons , with a cost of 100 gold per weapon ? 
  is it weird that i can answer this one without needing any time to stop and think about it , and give a bunch of reasons for my answer and ways it could be used ? 
  do n't ask this if you 're outside america . 
  internationally , `` yankee '' just means `` american '' , and asking that question could lead to some rather heated political debate ... usually you want to avoid politics as an icebreaker . 
  just a tip , the word you were looking for was invasive , not evasive . 
   they heavily prioritize the japanese market over the american one, 
  google ( and many other popular american tech companies ) very heavily prioritise the american market over the rest of the fucking world . 
  if you want to criticise nintendo for not listening to fans , a way better example would have been that whole debacle with youtube `` let 's plays '' of their games . 
  well my point here was n't to demonstrate what the answer was , but that it 's something i 've thought slightly obsessively about already . 
  if you 're interested , it 's time control . 
  left a project until two days before the deadline ? 
  no worries , just stop time ( or go back in time ) and work on it . 
  always get a full night 's sleep . 
  for most practical purposes , teleportation , since you can stop time , go somewhere ( as long as you can get there by foot/bike/car , and do n't need a plane or something else you ca n't control yourself ) , then restart time . 
  not to mention the more extreme stuff like going back in time to meet famous people , or forward in time to see futuristic technology and/or make heaps of money gambling . 
  and many , many more creative uses . 
   does changing light affect this invisibility once its engaged ? 
  this , of course , is the critical question . 
  the actual ability does n't specify . 
  it just says, 
   when you are in an area of dim light or darkness , you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction . 
  i would say that because it * does n't * say you * ca n't * use it in this way , that you probably could . 
  there 's nothing in the ability that says if you are no longer in darkness , you become visible . 
  there 's a reason i word it `` time control '' , and not `` the ability to stop time '' . 
  the power includes the complete ability to control everything about time . 
   not sure what the rules say, 
  in general , you should avoid making any rulings on things that you have n't read . 
  sneak attack is very misleadingly named . 
  it can be applied once per turn if you have advantage for any reason ( even if you 're not sneaking at all ) , or if an enemy of your enemy ( whether it be your ally or a member of a third faction who is fighting both you and the target of your attack ) is within 5 feet of the target . 
   as smiting does dictate that the character 's next hit, 
  not quite . 
  smiting is an ability that you choose to apply * after * the attack hits . 
  it 's not like the smiting spells where you apply it beforehand and then it applies on the next hit . 
  wait what the fuck ? 
  so we went from it being fibre to the home for nearly everyone , to significant numbers of people not even getting fibre to the node ? 
  i thought at least they 'd only changed the plan from ftth to fttn , without fucking it up even more than that does ... 
  on another note , what do `` h1 '' and `` h2 '' mean ? 
  first and second half of each year ? 
  how come for some they 're only as specific as that , while for others they 're as specific as naming the quarter , or even the exact month ? 
   a +1 nonmagical weapon, 
  uhh , there 's no such thing . 
  a +1 weapon is a really basic type of magical weapon . 
  the +1 - ness comes from magic . 
  oh interesting , thanks . 
  i did n't know that . 
  i had assumed that because it 's using cable it would be worse . 
  what 's all this about `` story origins '' ? 
  what the hell is a story origin ? 
  that seems an unusual step to take . 
  why not just change it from adamantine to silvered ? 
  whenever you 're after music to fit a particular mood , / u/scrumptiouscakes ' great subreddit , / r/classicalresources is a great source to go to . 
  [ here 's the `` dark '' page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalresources/comments/13g764/themes_saddark/ ) . 
  how your character makes the deal is your decision . 
  there are a lot of ways it could happen . 
  maybe the patron ( if it 's a fiend or fey ) sees them in danger and decides to help them out in exchange for becoming their client . 
  maybe the warlock-to-be stumbles across them or searches them out and specifically aims to make the pact . 
  maybe they somehow make a pact without even realising that 's what they 've done ( that 's what my character did ) . 
  it 's * definitely * possible to have a different alignment than your patron . 
  i might suggest that it would be most realistic ( and potentially very interesting ) if your character 's alignment is gradually shifted from what they start as towards that of your patron , sort of like they 're being `` corrupted '' by the patron over time . 
  this is especially true of fiend and goo patrons . 
  with the fiend it would be being corrupted both indirectly , with simply the devilish/demonic energy gradually causing you to turn evil , and directly , as the fiend slowly attempts to turn you evil . 
  with a goo it would only be the indirect method . 
  [ these two comments explain it a little more ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/3ohkop/rp_a_warlocks_pact/cvxwck5?context=3 ) . 
  but you do n't * have * to even do it that way , if you do n't want to . 
  especially with a fey , but even with the other two if you want , you can definitely just stay your own alignment . 
  indeed , if you enjoy d&d stories , you should check out / r/dndgreentext . 
  in particular , you should read the stories in the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which has a bunch of the best stories . 
  a couple of the stories are really , really long , but trust me , they 're worth it . 
  maybe just read them over the course of a few days or something . 
  question : do you mean [ pictures of dice towers ] or characters , or pictures of [ dice towers or characters ] ? 
  because i do n't mind people posting things that are about discussing characters . 
  in fact , i love doing that . 
  but if it were just pictures of characters , that 'd be less interesting . 
  though personally i still love seeing that stuff . 
  i do like having that mostly in a separate subreddit , though . 
  means when i want art i can easily get art , and when i want more substantive stuff , i come here . 
  it 's the same reason i wish there were less homebrew stuff here . 
  it has [ its own place it should live ] ( / r/unearthedarcana ) , to keep this place more focussed on discussing based on the official content . 
  two questions , one : what map is this ? 
  two : why does everyone who posts videos seem to play with these awful skins that make the game harder to follow ? 
  you gon na share the results with us ? 
  that was n't a rhetorical question . 
  i really do n't understand it and would like it if someone could explain . 
  i 've yet to see anything that is n't a step backwards in terms of usability . 
  no worries . 
  i 've seen a lot of people get tripped up by that rule . 
  the truth is that rogues should he getting sneak attack damage most rounds in a normal combat , usually by making use of that second option : having an ally within 5 feet of the enemy they target . 
  a rogue who targets they guy that 's distracted by the party tank will be most effective . 
  also worth noting is the swashbuckler rogue archetype in the waterborne adventures unearthed arcana article , which is going to be released officially with the sword coast adventure guide in about 2 weeks , has the ability to apply sneak attack even * without * an ally next to the enemy . 
  ( it 's possible that this may change before the official release , so do make sure to read the rules closely again before making any rulings on it . ), 
  for me , 2 of the top 5 results when i google that are related to strings in c.
