  i play on pc , and i do n't have any such reflex , nor can i think of any reason to . 
  ah thanks for that . 
  interesting that there 's a front page submission about rediquette , too . 
  i do n't know about film , but in music , if you do an ee in music , the pieces used should ** not ** be the same as the ones used for the mli ( a part of the main music course ) . 
  haha dude , i love how you 've handled the troll comments on the youtube video !, 
  great job . 
  curious , how come you take film studies , but have never made more than a single film ? 
  you should take a look at the [ 48 hour film project ] ( http://48hourfilm.com/ ) next time it 's in your area . 
  really fun contest !, 
  you chose a difficult style of film to make , so while the people criticising the quality of it are correct in saying it 's somewhat lackluster , i think you 've done a great job considering . 
  i myself have never attempted any sort of difficult cinematography or choreography . 
  i felt sorry for them , and sided with them during that quest . 
  when i next found a forsworn camp , i went up willingly to say hello to my new allies , but they attacked me !, 
  seeing that they have no respect for those that helped them enraged me , and i slayed every one of them i could find . 
  i agree , that picture describes exactly my impression too . 
  i do n't understand why he ever subscribed in the first place ... 
  this is exactly what i thought . 
  the moment i started getting attacked by them the first time after helping madanach , i put on the armour of the old gods , expecting them to stop ... 
  can honestly say i do n't remember him saying that , but i can understand them not recognising me .

  [ where i first found it ] ( http://graphjam.memebase.com/2012/04/04/funny-graphs-the-outernet/ ), 
  actually , the second link has some incredibly inconsistencies , so i think he 's very valid in distrusting it . 
  ca n't confirm or deny the first one , though . 
  do n't bother clicking if you 're not american , it 's very clearly targeted at americans . 
  not to me . 
  none of the questions on either were particularly interesting . 
  ca n't speak for daedric armour or weapons , but they definitely do n't care about summoned atronachs . 
  i came across them just after they 'd killed some atronach 's , too . 
  maybe he just does n't like the clarinet ? 
  people often do n't like the sound of a particular instrument . 
  i , for example , do n't generally like the sound of the flute in solo repertoire , although it can sound amazing within the orchestra or other ensembles . 
  of course , a completely average person like that probably wo n't be that interesting , really . 
  she could still be funny , though . 
   fun fact about people :, 
  ftfy, 
  it 's not about recoil causing the person to slow down , it 's about breaking the surface tension of the water . 
  i doubt that a 1oz slug would do enough to save you when travelling at terminal velocity , but having something break the surface tension can * significantly * increase the speed at which you can safely land in water . 
  you been on 9gag lately ? 
  i found out about it last september and it has , for the entire time i 've been on it , been made up of some of the most annoying , stupid people of any site i frequent . 
  i stay subscribed to its rss feed because it does have funny and interesting pictures , but the comments make me writhe inside . 
  i only started on reddit a month ago , but instantly * loved * it . 
  reddit may be going downhill lately , i would n't know , i 've not been here long enough . 
  but it is certainly no where ** close ** to being as bad as 9gag . 
  edit : some grammars, 
  he said the next few years , so this makes me feel it 's old enough that incognito mode very well may not have existed . 
  safari had it in 2005 , but after that it was n't until chrome in 2008 that incognito mode became commonplace . 
  firefox got it in 2009 , as did internet explorer .

  i can not believe i never noticed this before . 
  haha i hate markarth , but cool picture :d, 
  only good way to see a thalmor . 
  oh yes , definitely . 
  shame this did n't work for op , but updating drivers fixed it for me . 
  i 'm playing through a stealth character now , and with a high enough sneaking it 's possible to take out whole areas without needing to get into a fight . 
  i once had two people in a room , both sitting down , one facing toward me and one away from me . 
  i killed the one facing away , quickly rolled forward toward the other one and killed them too , and still got the sneak 15x bonus . 
  dragons are an incredible challenge for a stealth-oriented player , though . 
  you can get proudspire by talking to the guy who sells it , confirming the buy , and then quickly exiting the conversation and dropping all your money in the nearby storage unit ( i forget exactly what sort ) . 
  you just got ta stand behind him before you start talking , to be closer to it . 
  saw a guy giving instructions on how to get a refurbished mac . 
  as long as you get one that has a thunderbolt port ( it 's not the port itself that matters , but all the other upgrades that came at the same time ) , any 15 '' mbp will play skyrim just fine . 
  you 'll need to get yourself a copy of windows , and install through bootcamp ( if you do n't know how to do these things , i 'm sure the apple genuises would be more than happy to do it for you ) , so that you are running both operating systems separately . 
  i agree completely . 
  when i saw the ebony mail is heavy i was stunned . 
  the name mail . 
  the sneakiness perk . 
  everything points to light armour . 
  haha yeah . 
  i 've managed this once . 
  that one hit was n't worth much ... 
  i did n't at the time have the 2x dark brotherhood gloves , so only 15x . 
  also have n't yet got the blade of woe . 
  that is so useful . 
  out of interest , can the keys be customised ? 
  a and z are on opposite sides of the keyboard for me ( dvorak ) . 
  you should have just claimed it as part of your religion , and grown a beard . 
  there is a random encounter you can have where some bandits have stolen imperial costumes ( the naked imperial bodies will be around them ) and try to charge a toll . 
  this could be it . 
  people take any grammatical correction as douchey , even if it is n't necessarily . 
  my posse and me . 
  you always put yourself last , regardless of whether it 's `` i '' or `` me '' . 
  i play no companions . 
  fits the thief/assassin playstyle i 'm currently going with . 
  it 's also better for getting xp , since kills they get do n't give you xp . 
  too dark for me too . 
  you may want to make sure your monitor is calibrated correctly before taking any screenshots . 
  to be fair , most skyrim screenshots i see on here are too dark ... 
  when the teachers questioned you , did you immediately give in and surrender ? 
  i have on of them . 
  i 've read that usb -  ps/2 is a rare adapter , and yet i randomly have one of them somewhere in my house ... 
  it rather annoys me that manufacturers ca n't come to an agreement which of those two should be the further left . 
  is qc popular on reddit ? 
  or did i just come across another fan by accident ? 
  common day people calling it hacking when you open someone 's computer and find their facebook account open . 
  it 's certainly very likely what he did was n't true hacking , but something like you said . 
  whoa ... 
  what did you do to get that ban ? 
  what did you do that they would interpret like that ?
