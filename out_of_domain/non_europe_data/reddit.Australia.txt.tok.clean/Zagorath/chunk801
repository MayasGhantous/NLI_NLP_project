  5e was specifically designed to be played in whatever way you want in pretty much every respect of the game . 
  for running battles , theatre of the mind , rough pen and paper sketches , detailed battle maps ( on either hex or grid ) , or some combination of the above are all supported . 
  you do n't get * given * that feat for being a deep gnome . 
  you are given the opportunity to * take * that feat . 
  that means the earliest you can get it is at level 4 . 
  is / r/noyesnoyes a subreddit ? 
  because this would be the best thing ever for it if so . 
   they more or less removed him from the next two, 
  i dunno about that , he was a pretty key character in episode ii . 
  if you look at it the right way , jar jar was to blame for * everything * that happened between the end of episode ii and the death of the emperor at the end of episode vi . 
  jar jar moved the motion to give palpatine emergency powers . 
  admittedly , they made him a little more serious and less of a gag character in episode ii , and he did appear * less * . 
  and he was removed entirely as a speaking character ( as far as i remember ) in episode iii . 
   i 'm pretty sure he 's the senator who introduces the bill that gives palpatine unlimited powers in either ii or iii . 
  may be wrong on that, 
  [ nope , you 're not wrong . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjy0htrd4s ), 
  jar jar is literally directly to blame for everything bad that happens between episodes ii and vi . 
  yeah , i honestly do n't think he was all * that * bad . 
  i mean , he was n't a great character , but for the most part i thought he was okay . 
  he just exemplified the more general problems with writing in the prequels . 
  has he decided to quit reddit , or perhaps he 's been shadowbanned ? 
  actually , being shadowbanned also means that if you visit their user page it appears as though the account does n't exist . 
  but i agree , based on his previous actions , it seems likely he deleted the account . 
  oh interesting . 
  i do n't actually know what happens to shadowbanned users ' past posts , so i 'll take your word for it . 
  i think op was asking what `` dies '' means in the above context , not what `` anglosphere '' means . 
  commonwealth refers to a number of former british colonies that still maintain close ties to britain ( many , but not all , of which keep the british monarch as their own heads of state ) . 
  most of the anglosphere is in the commonwealth , but the united states and ireland are not . 
  and there are many non-anglospheric countries that * are * in the commonwealth , such as bangladesh . 
   we ca n't stand them , ok , and they ca n't play rugby , and they 're just a little island, 
  well , you got two points out of three right . 
  interesting . 
  the spell variants here seem to be a pretty strong indication that in general it 's perfectly okay to swap out spells of one level for others of the same levels as thematically appropriate . 
  and a similar argument could possibly be made for the asis . 
  did they fix up the wording of toujours l'audace ? 
  could you explain a bit about the arcana domain ? 
  in particular , what sets it apart thematically from the knowledge domain ( as well as mechanically , obviously ) , and which gods have picked up that domain ? 
  did they give a list of gods with the domain for just forgotten realms , or did they do it for the other d&d settings and real-world ancient mythologies as well ? 
  hey , so i do n't know how much thought you put in to the design of your website . 
  for the most part , it 's great : nice and simple and easy to find what you 're looking for . 
  but i might suggest changing `` hello ! '', 
  to `` about '' . 
  i get that you were going for a sort of friendly , personal feel , but in all honesty it just makes the site a * tiny * bit harder to navigate . 
  `` about '' is a standard heading that people recognise , and will go looking for on a site like this . 
  when you 're scanning for a particular known phrase , your eyes will glance over something unfamiliar and unexpected like `` hello ! '', 
  interestingly , today , the word `` delete '' is nearly never used in that context . 
  `` redacted '' is used instead . 
  i wonder if redacted became the popular term specifically because delete came to have a different meaning . 
  as a mod of / r/dndgreentext , i resemble that statement !, 
   people would of said, 
  you mean would * have * said . 
  or perhaps would * 've * said , for short . 
  but yeah , i know what you mean . 
  it 's like with the aarakocra with their flight . 
  i recall a week or two before the ee player 's companion came out , someone released a pixy race with a fly speed , and got a lot of criticism for exactly that trait . 
  dragon sorcerers do n't get flight until level 14 , after all !, 
  but i do n't think that 's necessarily a bad thing . 
  just because two classes can , in some circumstances , do the same thing , does n't mean that one necessarily overpowers the other . 
  there 's a lot of other factors to compare , so comparing two options based only on a single specific feature is unfair . 
  sun and moon elves are both under `` high elf '' in the phb , right ? 
  is there any substantive difference between the two sub-subraces ? 
  the one i had came with advertisements for age of mythology -- a game that remains my absolute all-time favourite rts . 
  not only nutri-grain , any kellog 's cereal ( or , if not `` any '' , then at least a wide variety ) . 
  i probably got mine in crispix . 
  i think most aussie kids born in the mid-to-late '90s probably got that copy of age of empires with the trailer for age of mythology from kellog 's cereal boxes . 
  oh yeah , i mostly grew up on vita-brits , but the sweet cereals were for weekends . 
  i 'd call this a nominal [ 6.5 rating ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  nominally , that 's very strong but not unbalanced . 
  but the 14 + con ac ( which i ranked as a +2 feature ) just seems insane to me . 
  personally i 'd suggest changing it to 12 + con and adding another feature worth +0.5 or * maybe * +1 . 
  you should also cross-post this to / r/unearthedarcana , they 'll be sure to be interested . 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
  yeah , well fuck you guys and your shitty out of date business practices , too . 
  that 's definitely way below average . 
  anyone got a mirror ? 
  which would you prefer , `` actual play '' podcasts , or discussion podcasts ? 
  personally i tend to prefer the latter , but people usually tend to suggest more of the former . 
  for the latter , [ critical success ] ( http://peachesandhotsauce.com/category/podcasts/critical-success ) and [ fear the boot ] ( http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/ ) are hands down the best options in terms of content , and both are highly produced and good quality audio . 
  [ dungeon master 's block ] ( http://dungeonmasterblock.podbean.com/ ) is also pretty decent in terms of content quality , and has a high quality of audio . 
  if you remove the four spaces at the start of the line , the comment will appear as actual greentext rather than being a code block . 
  that would be / r/pathfinder _ rpg . 
  but in general , questions of this nature would be more appropriate to that subreddit , / r/dnd , or / r/rpg , rather than here . 
  them 's fightin ' words !, 
  australia 's woollies is a completely unrelated business from the woolworths that used to exist in the uk . 
  it , along with coles , holds two thirds of australia 's supermarket market share . 
  i use matches , but it 's because i managed to grab like 100 of them for 50 cents . 
  i definitely do n't find them more reliable than a lighter would be ; just way cheaper . 
  i kinda hope that they 'll release digital copies of the maps once the book is released for real . 
  like they were going to do a few weeks ago if the charity thing had raised a bit more money . 
  a high resolution digital copy of the maps would be so useful . 
  much more useful for a whole party to share between them than the copy in the book could ever be . 
  ** pages 81-83 of the dungeon master 's guide ** deal with this . 
  i believe the free basic dm 's pdf also has similar instructions in it . 
  the rules are complicated enough that you 're best off reading the actual book , there really is n't a good summary that someone can make in a reddit comment . 
  that said , it 's important to note that `` easy '' , `` medium '' , `` hard '' , and `` deadly '' , as used by the dmg are assuming about 6 encounters per day , with two short rests . 
  if , like most parties , you play less than that , then you 'll need to remember that each of those labels is a bit easier than it sounds . 
  a fresh party going in to a so-called `` deadly '' encounter will usually make pretty quick work of it . 
  personally i always rolled for damage and stuff . 
  it 's more fun !,
