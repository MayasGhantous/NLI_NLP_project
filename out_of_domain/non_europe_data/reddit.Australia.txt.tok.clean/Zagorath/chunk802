  i disagree . 
  shortcuts are definitely easier on qwerty . 
  but that 's why os x has the dvorak -- \u2318 qwerty layout . 
  it switches back to qwerty while the command key is held down , so the most common shortcuts like \u2318 z , \u2318 c , etc. , are all the same . 
  actually in this case either is acceptable . 
  a good keyboard can cost you a couple thousand dollars , and in some ways can be nicer than a cheap upright piano . 
  though in other ways , even a really cheap real thing will be better than even the best digital version -- most notably regarding sympathetic string resonance . 
  no , the dvorak keyboard shortcuts are objectively worse . 
  i started out with dvorak on windows , where that keyboard layout does n't exist as an option . 
  you ca n't do the most common shortcuts as easily with just one hand , and that is very clearly a disadvantage . 
  exactly . 
  in any conversation like this , the super power is * assumed * to come with whatever other modifications are necessary to make it work properly . 
  to pretend otherwise is being obstinate purely for its own sake , and shuts down any useful or interesting conversation . 
  not just fucking up other people . 
  sure , there are a heap of ways to fuck with people using it , but it 's also extremely useful for personal gain without it being at the expense of anyone else . 
  you can get an unlimited amount of time to always get a good night 's sleep , more time to work on projects , so no worrying about meeting deadlines , and in general you can do everything at your own pace without being rushed . 
  you also get de facto teleportation to anywhere within a range you can bring yourself ( i.e. , if you can walk , bike , or drive yourself there , you can get there instantly -- if you 'd need to get on a plane , unless you yourself are a qualified pilot with access to your own plane , you 're out of luck ) by simply stopping time , going there , and then restarting it . 
  you could also go back in time and meet famous people and/or solve historical mysteries , or go forward in time and bring back futuristic technology ; negating the need for your gadgeteering idea , or for the `` make dinosaurs '' ability , and maybe even allowing you to `` fix humans '' , if its a problem that futuristic medicine can solve . 
  a 2nd level spell that can essentially negate 3rd level and higher spells like fireball ( since the description of fireball clearly indicates that it is a projectile that explodes when it reached the target ) ? 
  nah , i think this works just fine at 3rd level . 
  and which classes do you think should get this spell on their spell list ? 
  not in 4e . 
   the target is slowed ( save ends ) . 
  if the target fails its, 
  first saving throw against this power , the target becomes, 
  unconscious ( save ends ) . 
  how is the system meant to be used ? 
  and what was wrong with the rachni queen ? 
  personally i just use google . 
  just type something like `` 12 usd to aud '' into your omnibar , and the card at the top of the search page gives you the answer . 
  my biggest suggestion would be : do n't homebrew , or keep homebrewing to an absolute minimum , until you are way more experienced in how the system works . 
  * especially * avoid homebrewing classes . 
  items are relatively easy to homebrew , because you can really have them do anything you want . 
  the hard part is knowing at what level they would be appropriate to give to players . 
  in general , the best thing to do would be to look at existing items in the dmg and alter some of their properties . 
  for races , use [ this guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) , and try to stay under 6.5 . 
   or bethesda would have to implement a more meaningful romance fit for a complex character , which is a lot for one character, 
  marriage is , as all the other comments in this thread have demonstrated , an exceedingly dull mechanic in skyrim . 
  to have marriage with serana be an option would be to significantly reduce her as a character . 
  the problem is most games would present that scenario you describe as a binary choice , but there 's no reason it has to be . 
  why not wait until after the bandits have been taken care of , and * then * take out the lord . 
  or perhaps take out the lord , then take it upon yourself to lead the defense . 
  a sense of false dichotomy is something that non-tabletop rpgs so very rarely manage to avoid in their stories , even when they do have brilliant writing . 
  yeah , when i think about it , it 's clearly not as strong as counterspell is , so a 3rd level spell slot is probably unfair . 
   against any creature occupying the space in which this spell was cast, 
  i would reword that , since the spell ( at least as it 's written ) can be used to protect allies from projectiles like arrows or spells , too , as long as they are within 15 feet . 
  rogues do n't get their own spell list , they choose there 's from the wizard 's so they 're fine . 
  i can definitely see clerics , especially war and life domain clerics , wanting to have this . 
  op was n't asking `` why is voting republican good for the country '' , it was that there is no good reason that * anyone * , or at least , any significant number of people , would vote republican . 
  the comment op gave a delta to clearly demonstrated that there is a very large portion of the population that has at least one reason that voting republican is inline with their beliefs . 
  noah wyle will still always be the best portrayal of steve jobs . 
  well the second one is obviously kutcher on account of it being clear he 's standing in front of one of those media wall things that they have for interviews and such . 
  or the watch if you 're feeling fancy . 
  you need to escape that , bro . 
  reddit 's syntax automatically changes '' [ number ] . '', 
  at the start of a line into a numbered list , starting at 1 . 
  it looks like you just said you are 1 year old . 
  instead , put a backslash before the full stop , like so :, 
  but i remember ... `, 
  which comes out as :, 
  but i remember ... 
  the guy you replied to would have been 17 when the ipod came out . 
  i 'd say that 's old enough . 
  from the sounds of it you 're only a few years older . 
  the guy said 31 if you read the source of the comment ( and it * has n't * been edited ) . 
  if you did n't read the source , it just says `` 1 '' , thanks to reddit 's syntax converting it to an ordered list . 
  i have no idea where you got 21 from . 
  well the name of the queen of mithral hall is dagnabbet , which is kinda amusing . 
  but in general i think op posted this for people who are interested in information about the world . 
  press the button under the comment that says `` source '' ( next to `` permalink '' and `` embed '' , and you can see it as they wrote it , rather than with the syntax that reddit applied to it . 
  could you elaborate on how rakish audacity differs from toujours l'audace ? 
  well , i mean , a guy who recently played steve jobs in a movie who was attempting to pose for a picture where he * looks * like steve jobs could easily have something like that . 
  i 've never done it for myself , but i occasionally write in-character diaries and such for my d&d characters , and it can be fun to just practise signing * their * names over and over . 
  never turns out quite as nice as yours , though . 
  serious question , is there even such a thing ? 
  like , i 'm sure you could point to a couple here and there , but do they exist in any serious way ? 
  speaking as an outsider , it seems like gun control is one issue where the * entire * country is totally fucking crazy . 
  like , even most american liberals would be considered rightwing extremists when it comes to the issue of gun control in my country . 
  so the idea of someone who is on the right wing in general also * not * being pro-gun is somewhat confusing to me . 
  the biggest problem is n't monetary valuables , it 's stuff with sentimental value or which otherwise can not be replaced even if you get the money to do so . 
  totally agree . 
  the way some people were behaving in that thread was frankly frightening . 
  that people can actually feel justified in murdering someone who took a bunch of stuff . 
  * especially * when they 're already on there way out , and there ca n't be * any * argument to be had that it was out of fear for your safety .

  it 's really nothing special ( in concept , that is ) , just the effect of gradually increasing the recorded framerate ( which results in a gradual decrease of the speed on-screen ) over the course of a single shot , as opposed to having a single shot at normal speed , and then another single shot at high frame rate . 
  or vice versa . 
  let me guess , you 're using an android device * other * than a samsung or lg one ? 
  because emoji representations vary by platform , but it just so happens that [ the `` pedestrian '' emoji is shown walking to the left on * every * platform other than native android ] ( http://emojipedia.org/pedestrian/ ) . 
  i 'm gon na hazard a guess and say you 're running windows 10 ? 
  it 's the only platform that shows [ the `` pistol '' emoji as anything other than a fairly normal looking handgun ] ( http://emojipedia.org/pistol/ ) . 
  though i 'd probably describe what it shows as more of a toy laser gun than a power drill ... 
  it 's obviously going to depend on the sport , but i consider myself a pretty good long-distance runner . 
  i ca n't come * close * to the time of top-tier women on a 5 k or 10 k course . 
  yes , you absolutely could . 
  there 's people who are in some way `` broken '' , so to speak , on both sides of this issue . 
  [ that one wo n't look too great for people on windows ] ( http://emojipedia.org/swimmer/ ) .

  i 'm not sure i get the reference . 
  you ca n't easily replace the data on those computers , and if they steal your hard drives too , even someone who backs up regularly is fucked .
