  your livestream is n't at 8:30 pm est , it 's at 20:30 utc-5 . 
  because then i , over here in a different time zone * also * known as eastern standard time , know that i have to add on 15 hours to figure out that it 's at 11:30 am the following day for me . 
  easy-peasy . 
  but if people say `` est '' , first of all i have to work out from context * which * est it is , then go and figure out what the time zone offset for the american est is , and then do the calculation . 
  the real lpt is move somewhere sensible that does n't observe this nonsense . 
  then you know it 's always standard time . 
  umm ... no . 
  daylight saving time moves ahead an hour in the * summer * . 
  that means that when the sun is already setting at like 7:00 pm in the extrame latitudes , you 've moving it so that it does n't set until 8:00 pm . 
  it depends . 
  [ what country are you in ? 
  ] ( http://files.doobybrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/nyc-london-sydney-time-zone.jpg ), 
  oh interesting . 
  where are they from in australia ? 
  [ their blog seems to have a rough changelog on it ] ( http://inkarnate.com/blog/ ) . 
  but i do n't know how accurate it is , because it does n't even seem to be in any particular order . 
  14 july , 6 july , 30 august ? 
  when i ran lost mines , i used a bunch of different techniques . 
  honestly , i was n't very satisfied with any of them . 
  but the one that was perhaps best for an online situation was i opened the map in photoshop , and i added a bunch of black layers over the top that i gradually removed as they went through the dungeon . 
  you could do this by sharing your screen with the players over skype , or by sending them an updated version of the map with the right new amount revealed , each time they enter a new room . 
  nope again . 
  it does nothing to change the time of sunrise in winter . 
  the sun * does * rise very late in winter , but to avoid that would require shifting forward of an hour in * winter * , whereas currently places that use dst shift forward in summer and use the * correct * time in winter . 
  there really are not any good reasons for daylight saving . 
  it causes a noticeable spike in suicides , traffic accidents , and heart problems shortly after the changeover , it has no appreciable effect on the amount of energy used ( some proponents claim that it reduces energy usage , while some opponents claim it increases it , however studies have shown the magnitude of this effect in either direction to be not very significant ) . 
  it causes massive communication confusion , which is especially problematic in today 's global economy , in addition to having noticeably reduced efficiency of workers ( because people who are tired simply can not work as effectively ) . 
  all because some people would rather the sun set at 8 pm than 7 pm . 
  7 is already an insanely late time for the sun to be setting , for god 's sake !, 
  also moving * into * range of someone with the polearm master feat . 
  vampire 5 , paladin 9 , warlock 1 , rogue 5 , for a nova of 6d8 +3 d6 , plus a potential extra 1d10 from hellish rebuke . 
   it 's remarkably actually essential , because without it , a vampire player would have stats behind the rest of their peers, 
  well , not necessarily . 
  it could be replaced with a standard asi , or perhaps a stricter asi , like one where you get 2 points to place in strength , dexterity , or charisma , or something like that . 
  not saying i think you * should * have done either of those things . 
  i actually like sinister nourishment exactly as it is . 
  just pointing out that it could potentially have been replaced with something else and not made vampires significantly worse . 
  and that 's without the actual weapon damage and strength/dex mod !, 
  add an extra 9.5 ( because obviously you 're going to be doing +5 , and i kinda like the feel of a vampire wielding a longsword one-handed , or maybe a rapier ) to the total . 
  or you could do two shortswords , and add 12 , from 2 \\* 3.5 +5 . 
  by the way , should sanguine strikes work at range ? 
  if so ( actually , even if not ) , i 'm kinda wondering how you feel it works in a descriptive sense . 
  what does it look like to onlookers , and what exactly is the vampire doing ? 
   i do n't want to double up on the `` gaze '' - i 've already got one of those, 
  actually , it was specifically * because * you already have one of those that i suggested it . 
  4e 's vampire class had a number of different abilities titled '' [ something ] gaze '' . 
  paladins in 5e have a number of spells with `` smite '' in the title , in addition to the core ability divine smite . 
   it makes me think of a really elegant guy wearing a sombrero, 
  eh , to each his own . 
  that does n't sound like the sort of feature i want my vampires to have [ :p ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-avyobrrkdgi/ujf5f6ksiui/aaaaaaaadea/nt2ao0orj_0/s1600/hsvamp.jpg ), 
  but either way , the feature itself is great . 
  the name is n't too important . 
  vampires in lore are often powerful casters , and i do n't want to put a damper on that, 
  yeah , i realised after some of the theory crafting i ( and others in the thread ) did after i posted that previous comment that the class really does need that full casting , especially , as you say , for sanguine strikes . 
  and i guess their really limited spell list keeps things from getting too arcane feeling , which was my biggest concern with the high number of spell slots initially . 
  it 's more formally known as aest , but within australia people just call it est. 
  it 's utc +10 . 
  there 's also an aedt , though my state ( queensland ) does n't use it : we stay on normal time all year round . 
  new south wales ( the state sydney is in ) and victoria ( melbourne ) are both on edt ( utc +11 ) at the moment . 
  my pleasure . 
   unless i work out what city might be in that time zone , then do a world clock conversion to my country, 
  yeah definitely . 
  i could n't count the number of times i 've googled `` time in new york '' or `` time in san francisco '' so that i can work out when something is happening in terms of american est/edt or pst/pdt . 
  that map is only useful for converting between us and canadian time zones , which is pretty easy to do anyway . 
  it 's of zero utility for a european or australian who wants to work out when things are going on . 
   which are used all over the world, 
  not really . 
  it 's pretty much just europe , north america , and parts of oceania . 
  almost none of asia or africa uses it , and less than half of south america . 
  some quick back-of-the-napkin maths tells me that around 20 % or less of the world uses daylight saving , and of that it 's pretty damn concentrated in a couple of areas . 
  and regarding cet , well , that 's their own damn fault ( `` them '' being the namers of the time zone ) . 
  there 's no indication in `` central european time '' that it 's referring only to the standard time . 
  at least with the american and australian time zones , they have the word `` standard '' in their name normally , which then gets swapped out for `` daylight '' when that is in effect ( for the parts of those countries which observe dst ) . 
  do they have any similarly good deals for the 5x ? 
  i dunno , i saw it on a musical facebook group . 
  but i 'm like 90 % sure it has to be fake . 
  this fantastic subreddit was one of the trending subreddits a few weeks ago :, 
  / r/mealprepsunday /, 
  awesome , thanks . 
  the comment you initially replied to indicated he 's not american , and one of his later replies said he 's not canadian . 
  so i simply made the obvious observation that , therefore , a map of time zones in the us and canada is n't especially useful . 
  the guy you replied to previously * was * talking about europe , or asia , or australia , or somewhere else . 
  you just seem to have missed the clues of this . 
   only a corporate entity , such stuff, 
  there are some conspiracy theories in australia ( or , at least , brisbane ) that our local city council is illegitimate , and that it is in fact a corporate entity registered in the united states . 
  it 's really quite amusing to read what these people have to say . 
  holy shit . 
  someone that even ancaps think is crazy . 
  when the craziest of the crazy think * you * are crazy , that 's some fucked up shit . 
  how is it reverse chronological order ? 
  the top post was mid july . 
  the next is * earlier * in july , and the last one is * later * than both the others , in august . 
  oddly enough , i remember getting a pm from him shortly before i left the greens where he corrected * me * for not signing off with `` hon. '', 
  psa to everyone in this thread . 
  qwerty is all capitalised because it is named after the literal letters in its top row . 
  you should * not * capitalise anything but the d in dvorak , because it is named after an actual person who created the format . 
  it will almost certainly be different in a few small ways , but only small ways . 
  the point of the leaked pilot was likely to gauge the direction they should take the show over the subsequent episodes . 
  whether to play up the romcommy stuff or tone it down , how much screen time kara 's boss should have , stuff like that . 
  but these things will not have changed within episode 1 .
