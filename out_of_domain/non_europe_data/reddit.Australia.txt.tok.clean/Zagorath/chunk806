  look out mainly for better special effects , and maybe some reshot scenes with better sets , things like that . 
  hey guys , could we get a time in utc for these sorts of things , whenever a time is mentioned ? 
  i have no idea how to translate between american times and where i am , but i know what my utc offset is . 
  or , failing that , at least mention what the utc offset is for the stated above times . 
  something tells me that none of these legal methods are actually going to be legal for people outside the us , and that 's easily the biggest demographic that would * want * to be able to stream it , since watching it on tv live is n't even an option . 
  someone did , anyway . 
  my vague memory is that it was you , but i could be misremembering . 
  edit : you know what , it was n't you , it was freddy . 
  i musta confused it for you since i received other messages from you so shortly afterward . 
  in addition to the / top , the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) is a great binge . 
  present, 
  i , zagorath , do solemnly and sincerely affirm and declare that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to our sovereign , their heirs and successors according to law . 
  they 're pretty common here in australia . 
  the escalator 's surface is supposed to somehow lock the wheels in place , though it does n't always work perfectly . 
  they never slide down anywhere near as fast as they would on a smooth ramp , though . 
  the reason it failed in this case was that it was n't a store trolley , they brought their own that * was n't * designed to lock in place on the escalator . 
  on a similar note , the premier of beethoven 's 6th and 5th symphonies , as well as the * public * premier of his 4th piano concerto, 
   there was little critical response to the premiere performance , which took place under adverse conditions . 
  the orchestra did not play well -- with only one rehearsal before the concert -- and at one point , following a mistake by one of the performers in the choral fantasy , beethoven had to stop the music and start again . 
  the auditorium was extremely cold and the audience was exhausted by the length of the program . 
  it was also the last concert in which beethoven would play as the soloist in a piano concerto .

   the target 's game statistics , including mental ability scores , are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast . 
  my initial assumption was that this means that no , you could n't use features like rage . 
  but on second thought , i can kinda see it going either way . 
  yeah , officially all the shows are in the same universe as the movies , but whedon and the other major writers and directors of the movies basically ignore the shows . 
  it 's up to the shows to write around the movies , not the other way round , in effect . 
  dst was first proposed by a new zealander , and first implemented by world war i germany . 
  and you meant `` except '' , not `` accept '' . 
   `` kara youre a life saver ! '', 
  ... that scene was deleted . 
  aww man , that 's a shame . 
  i thought that line was hilarious . 
  to be fair , a lot of people felt the same way after watching the episode for the first time . 
  the only reason i knew and was able to correct you was from comments in the thread back in may . 
   sort of speak, 
  i think the expression you 're looking for is `` so to speak '' . 
  [ one 's up now . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/supergirltv/comments/3qd3gp/s01e01_pilot_postepisode_discussion_thread/ ), 
  i 'm guessing that 's in `` other '' ? 
  i thought there were infinitely many ? 
  i thought those were all between earth-1 and earth-2 , and the fact that the number was 52 was just an easter egg . 
  wait , boston legal was a spinoff ? 
  was the original show as good/better ? 
  i doubt that the high-res map released if the same as this ridiculously enormous 67 megapixel monstrosity ( in an incredibly awesome way ) . 
  it 'll probably be about half that size , which is still very large . 
  and it almost certainly wo n't come with the 66 page pdf of individual parts of the world . 
  that said , if all you want is the single high-res map , you actually do n't * really * need to donate anything . 
  it 's not like kickstarter . 
  if the * whole * extra life campaign reaches $ 100,000 , they will release the map for free to the public . 
  however , if you do want them to reach that value , i 'd highly encourage donating , because it 's slow going . 
  and the money goes to a fantastic charity anyway , even if the total does n't end up reaching the required amount . 
  [ here 's the page where you can donate or find more information ] ( http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&amp;teamid=21011 ) . 
  this is where the previews for parts of the sword coast adventurer 's guide were released , such as the greenflame blade , urban bounty hunter , and mastermind . 
  just yesterday they reached $ 90,000 and released the duergar preview . 
  they did say that it 'll be `` high res '' . 
  this one is 10200 by 6600 , which is * huge * . 
  but 1/10th that would be 1020 by 660 * , which is n't even wallpaper sized . 
  my suspicion is that they 'll release something about half the size of this full one , and that it wo n't also come with the pdf of the extra pages with more detailed versions of smaller sections . 
  \\* assuming by `` 1/10th '' you mean in each dimension , which is what seems most intuitive , and i believe it 's the way most people would use the term . 
  however the term could also be construed to mean that the total number of resultant pixels will be 1/10th , which would mean each dimension is about 1/3rd , giving a result of 3225 by 2087 . 
  what 's the pdf like ? 
  how large are each of the individual pages , and are they in what seems like a natural format for the maps , or forced into pages of a4 size or similar ? 
  follow op 's link and buy it for $ 10 . 
  but for what it 's worth , i got that 66 number from a commentor in this thread , and i 'm not * entirely * sure what they mean by it , since the description says it 's 34 pages . 
  not exactly sure what the set up is , but the difference in those two numbers seems to be related to the fact that there are labelled and unlabeled versions of each region . 
  ah right . 
  was it infinite at some point in the past ? 
  i do n't really keep up with the comic book lore . 
   for me i love chinese new year, 
  me , too , but i ca n't stand the fact that that 's what most people seem to call it here . 
  lunar new year is celebrated all across eastern asia , not just china !, 
  i do n't like hallowe'en , but i do n't have anything particularly against people that do . 
  but if you want to bring that fucking wibbly-wobbly fake time bullshit here , fuck you . 
  the days after the switch sees spikes in suicides , heart attacks , and traffic accidents . 
  there 's noticeable decreased productivity from workers due to a lack of sleep . 
  and it increases confusion regarding international communications , both between businesses and on a more casual level . 
  if you think all that is worth having a little more daylight at the time of year when the sun is * already * up for longer , then there is something * seriously * wrong with you . 
  my maths courses ( calculus and linear algebra i , multivariate calculus , and a probability/statistics course ) have all involved some programming in matlab . 
  i accept . 
  what 's the best in the game ? 
  and if you 're referring to that thing where you fit hundreds of tiny opponents in a small space , it does n't count , because ( a ) that would require a situation that would never actually happen , and ( b ) we 're talking maximum damage against a * single * opponent , not maximum total damage dealt in one turn . 
  i might suggest giving the ogier +3 strength and no other stat increase , rather than +4 , +1 , and -2 . 
  the 5e design ethos is that penalties like that should mostly be avoided , and a +4 is insanely powerful , even with the attempt at balance a -2 provides . 
  +3 would obviously be an unusual take on it , with the standard being +2 and +1 , but we already have unusual options with the mountain dwarf gaining two +2 s , and humans gaining either 6 +1 s or two +1 s and a feat . 
  having a race that gives just a +3 makes sense , to me . 
  i 'm studying software engineering at university at the moment , and my recommendation , if that sort of thing is what you 're interested in , would be oop . 
  databases would probably be my second choice . 
  i have no idea what `` web sciences '' is , but i 'd stay as far away from modelling and simulation as possible . 
  oh interesting . 
  i 'll have to give it a look myself . 
  wisdom works as well . 
  no , but you would know all the details about your own character . 
  the improv comes from the interactions between you and the other players , as well as with the world the dm creates . 
  hahaha i love this comment on that video :, 
   the only thing i hate about classical music is that we ca n't google the lyrics to find the title of the music we had in mind !, 
  also , that gives me a cool idea for a game . 
  write out a description of a piece of classical music using words like `` da '' and `` laaaaa '' , and see who can guess it . 
  so , like , beethoven 's 5th might be `` duh duh duh duuuuuuuuhhh '' , for example . 
  haha this is awesome , thanks for sharing !,
