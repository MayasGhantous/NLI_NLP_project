  i would rank his first significantly higher than most people probably do , just because watching [ eschenbach conduct the third movement ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5a5tfyxqio ) is hilarious . 
  absolutely love the opening to his 5th . 
  one of my favourite openings to * any * piece . 
  but i do n't have a definite order that i 'd list all of his symphonies in . 
  i 'm not especially familiar with them compared to some other works . 
  it would n't happen to be [ jesu , joy of man 's desiring ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6ogzccoxwc ) by j. s. bach , would it ? 
  do they have social media accounts ? 
  hound those . 
  companies tend to be more responsive to complaints that are highly visible . 
  failing that , i 'd look to the payment providers . 
  if you used paypal or a similar payment service , contact them . 
  if you paid directly by credit or debit card , contact the card provider . 
  i do n't know what country you 're in , but chances are consumer protection laws mean you will get your money back , if the goods were faulty on arrival . 
  is there any chance you could upload some low-res versions of the index and one or two of the individual pages , so we can get an idea of what they look like ? 
  since programming is the core of computer science and software engineering , i would recommend anyone interested in doing one of them have a look at some online courses on the topic . 
  harvard offers a free online course called [ cs50x ] ( https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x ) which , if you can force yourself to get through the absolutely horrible first week `` coding '' in scratch , is a really fun course . 
  [ coursera ] ( https://www.coursera.org/ ) regularly has good beginner programming courses . 
  i 'd highly recommend taking one on python , since it 's a great introductory language . 
  there will be a lot of stuff in your degree that * is n't * just programming , but having a good understanding of the coding bit before you go in will certainly help , especially with courses that * involve * code but are n't explicitly * about * it , like algorithms and data structures . 
  also , look into software engineering and it degrees , as well . 
  exactly what each of these three programmes entail differs from university to university , so which one is best for you will depend on what university you 're looking at , and what you want to do . 
  at my university , for example , computer science is a bit of a joke . 
  it 's a terrible course , really more for people interested in science in a general sense who also like computers . 
  it is a step up , for people who want computer stuff without going in too much depth , and software engineering is the real hardcore programme . 
  but that 'll be completely different at other universities . 
  point is , do n't * just * look at the programmes labelled `` computer science '' just because it 's the name you 've heard of most often . 
  on a related note , i 'm wondering why he appeared to deliberately run out . 
   then other guy doubles down and tries to claim that europe is n't a continent but an ~ idea ~, 
  this has an element of truth to it . 
  there 's really no good reason that europe and asia are considered separate continents . 
  they are n't ( for the most part ) on separate tectonic plates , there are enough cultural differences * within * asia ( and even within europe , to a lesser extent ) that cultural boundaries would have eurasia split into at * least * 4 , probably 6 or 7 `` continents '' , and there 's obviously no major geographic division like there is with the panama or suez isthmuses with the border between north and south america , and africa and ( eur ) asia , respectively . 
  so really , `` europe '' as a continent is just an idea that some europeans came up with a few centuries ago in order to keep themselves separate from people far away with different skin colour . 
  that obviously does n't seem to be what the guy was getting at , but it seems he reached the right conclusion , just for very wrong reasons . 
  yeah , i definitely prefer the 6 continent model . 
  separating europe and asia would at a * minimum * require :, 
  * east asia ( which would go as far south as vietnam , and as far west as bhutan, 
  * south asia ( the `` indian subcontinent '' as it is known today ), 
  * the middle east, 
  * europe, 
  but in all honesty would probably also need to further split up europe into western , eastern , and northern , add in something for russia , and maybe split the indochinese peninsula into being separate from north-eastern asia . 
  africa would then need to be split to have the northern muslim countries separate , and maybe further subdivided from that . 
  and lord knows mexico 's culture is so vastly different from that of america and canada , and bolivia 's is very different to brazil 's . 
   coal power stations are n't typically turned off gradually, 
  what , do you think we 're going to be using all coal power one day , and the next day switch cold turkey to nuclear and/or renewables ? 
  that does n't seem likely to me . 
  19th century indochina , and the indian subcontinent , would both beg to differ . 
  i assumed your use of the word `` march '' was metaphorical . 
  but yeah , if you meant it literally , then it works perfectly . 
   i got in trouble once for not carding a guy that was 25 . 
  now that 's just a bullshit rule . 
  the point of things like `` challenge 25 '' ( which is the official name for a typical policy in the uk , where legal age for buying alcohol is 18 , and i happen to think the idea of the scheme is a rather good one -- easy to remember catchy name and all ) , is to avoid accidentally selling to people who are underage but happen to look old enough : it 's so you do n't get 17 year olds that look like they 're 20 buying alcohol . 
  so you challenge anyone that * looks * like they 're under 25 . 
  because if you can look at them and say `` there 's no way this person could possibly be under 25 '' , then chances are they 're * definitely * not under 18 . 
  if the policy where you worked was to challenge 26 ( and first of all , if you were in the us with the ridiculous legal drinking age of 21 , that 5 year gap was too small to be a reasonable one , but that 's beside the point ) , and you saw someone that you thought * looked * over 26 , even if they were actually below that , they * still were n't below 21 * , and thus the system worked correctly , and you did your job right . 
  getting in trouble for that is bullshit . 
   greentext format encouraged , ** but not required ** . 
  oh yeah , well that 's obviously true . 
  but we do n't usually consider the precise state of any one station when discussing the national direction for power generation , we look at the scheme in aggregate . 
  i 'd say make a few subtle changes here and there , but for the most part , just trust him not to metagame . 
  if it becomes an issue , talk to him about it . 
  i 'm like 90 % sure it 's two shots , one with a proper camera rig , maybe even a dolly , and a second one that shows a guy just holding a dslr out pretending to film . 
  the first thing i really noticed was the spokes on the guard of my fan . 
  the os performs noticeably better ( not to the extent that it alone would be worth the difference , but it is noticeable ) with the same specs . 
  if you 're talking about stuff like video rendering or gaming , this * wo n't * be a factor , because the specs really do matter , but for word processing , browsing , and other basic tasks , you get a better experience for the same specs . 
  there are some great os x exclusive programmes , like pdfpen and finalcut pro both of which are , from my experience , far * far * better than their nearest rivals . 
  windows also has some great exclusives , of course , but if i had to pick just the os x exclusives or just the windows ones , outside of games , it would be os x in a heartbeat . 
  with games included , i 'd have to think about it a bit more . 
  good build quality . 
  the touchpad is actually a * better * experience than a simple three button mouse ( not as good as a gaming mouse with extra buttons , though ) , thanks to its gestures , for average use ( if you 're doing graphical design or gaming , you 'll want a mouse anyway -- though i did play through portal 1 and 2 on my touchpad , by rebinding the portal keys to q and e rather than left and right click , and it was an acceptable experience ; not great , but acceptable ) . 
  simple things like the media buttons working really smoothly and exactly as you 'd expect them to , especially the keyboard backlight . 
  a unix-based operating system . 
  absolutely essential if you 're a techy , particularly if you 're interested in programming . 
  the bash terminal is a fantastic experience . 
  linux gets this as well , but windows is just utterly crap . 
  for anything that remotely goes near the command line or anything at a lower level . 
  that 's all stuff that 's good for either everyone or techies . 
  for specifically people who are n't techies ( the typical example being `` your mum '' ) , it 's got the advantage of being a much safer experience . 
  macs are ** not ** virus proof , but they are significantly harder to fuck up . 
  every time i visit my grandparents , my grandfather ( who is actually fairly good with computers for his age ) has managed to change his default search provider to one of those spammy ones like mywebsearch , and installed a toolbar or some such thing . 
  i 've not heard of that sort of thing happening on os x. 
  all that said , i 'm typing this on a windows desktop . 
  i own a mac laptop , but i also like the higher performance per dollar gain i get out of a custom-built desktop pc . 
  it means i get all the advantages of * both * platforms , and honestly i ca n't imagine having to go back to having only one of them , regardless of which one of them it would be . 
   there 's no way to calculate the grace period, 
  it could be done with some ajax . 
  just send a message to the server when the user starts typing , and allow that message to ignore the `` locked '' restriction . 
  but i agree that they probably wo n't do it , both because it would require far more effort than it would be worth to get it working right , and because frankly it would ( at least partly ) defeat the purpose of the thread lock . 
  depends on your definition of `` imply '' . 
  if you mean the formal logical definition , then that 's correct , recursion does not imply a base case . 
  but if you mean the every day use of the term , imply basically means `` demonstrates that the following is likely '' , then yes , recursion * does * imply a base case . 
  hey , if you 've already bought it , is there any chance you could upload some low-res versions of the index and one or two of the individual pages , so we can get an idea of what they look like ? 
  i 'm a bit hesitant to fork out the money for it if i have n't been able to get a decent look at what it is i 'd be getting . 
  yeah , if it were a class ability of some sort , recompose spell could be interesting . 
  but to me , it feels completely off as a spell . 
  a spell that , when cast , permanently alters the way * another * one of your spells works ? 
  that just does n't make sense at all . 
   any kind of puplishing of the map in a way that other people would be able to extract the stand alone file, 
  exactly , hence the request for a low res version . 
  just , like , a screenshot of a really zoomed out one that 's enough to see how it works and get a feel for the logic of it , but nowhere near good enough to actually use for anything useful . 
  wow yeah , thanks .
