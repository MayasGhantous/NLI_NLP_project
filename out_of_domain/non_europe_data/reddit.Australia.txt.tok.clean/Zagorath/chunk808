  you 've sold me . 
  ( i think schley owes you a commission !, 
  wow i wish i had seen this a week or so ago . 
  the limitations of inkarnate lead me to give up on it and use photoshop . 
  admittedly , it has the advantage of being able to use as many layers as i want , and a bunch of other things that this would n't have solved , but at the very least this * would * have solved some of the most basic ones , and i probably could 've just stayed in it . 
  definitely gon na save this for future reference . 
  actually , come to think of it , mods , is there any chance this could be added to the sidebar ? 
  / u/nickrart / u/igagen ? 
  it may have been earlier on , but at this point i 've done way more than what inkarnate would have been capable of , with layers for * each * of the different terrains , for roads , for cities , towns , and other objects , etc. 
  and to be honest the only feature i really wanted was to be able to trace over my hand drawn map ... 
  well , if you 're a programmer it beats out windows thanks to the unix terminal , as i mentioned . 
  it beats linux just on basic usability , as there are some really damn serious problems with linux that make it frankly unusable as a daily driver . 
  if your field is something creative , like film , there are a number of great exclusive programmes on os x. 
  there 's very good software for windows , too , but all of the worthwhile software available for windows is also available for os x , so it makes sense to go with the platform that can run the most things . 
  on the other hand , if your field is , say , accounting or something where the office suite or other business utilities are your main programmes , windows is the better choice . 
  office exists on os x , but it 's absolutely horrible . 
  microsoft refuses to use basic os tools like standard memory management , and it makes office a pain to work with . 
  on windows its great . 
  this seems best to me . 
  i 'd rather allow discourse unless someone else brings up why they think it would not be allowed . 
  hmm ... 
  i know in general the us is rather lacking in consumer protection laws , but i 've a feeling that this is something that even over there you should be okay . 
  it 's a pretty obvious rule : if something gets to you in an a condition that is not as described , there 's no way you should have to pay for it . 
  meta : thanks for this , i knew it was a thing they did in the uk , but did n't realise it was brought over here . 
  i wish to express my grateful thanks for the high honour that has been bestowed on me by the house . 
  i detailed my problems with ubuntu [ in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3q5aw1/what_name_brands_are_you_the_most_loyal_to/cwch0hv ) rather recently . 
  from memory , i think with skype at least part of my problems were with the app itself : that it was so horribly out of date it might not have been worth keeping installed . 
  but the others were very real serious problems , and whether everyone has the same problems or not , clearly it is a problem with ubuntu , because * nobody * has the same level of difficulty on windows or os x. 
   a game designed by a lead designer of 3e and a lead designer of 4e, 
  so , 5e ? 
  / s ( sorta ), 
  5e , for me . 
  i started on 4e , and i love it for its balance , the sense that every character can do cool things , and the wider variety of options . 
  but 5e 's mechanics just play so much more smoothly , and the game runs a hell of a lot faster . 
  once 5e catches up in terms of amount of content available , it 'll be hands down the best edition of the game . 
  i ca n't stand 3 . x for its stupidly needlessly detailed rules , where it has a specific rule for just about any action you could want to do , and dozens of skills that really do n't need to be separate . 
  it 's complicated for the sake of being complicated , and does n't add to the game . 
  i do n't like editions previous to that for the weird class , race , and level system/restrictions . 
  skyrim 's dlc was proper expansion packs . 
  civ v had a bunch of bullshit tiny dlcs , but it also had brave new world and gods & kings . 
  dragon age : origins also had a * heap * of bullshitty ones , but it had awakening , which was an enormous expansion of an entire new major storyline set after the completion of the base game . 
  smaller but substantial add-ons include warden 's keep , the stone prisoner , and return to ostagar . 
  and then there were the standalone mini adventures , of which there are 5 . 
  13 years after its initial release , microsoft has announced a new major expansion to age of mythology ( which had already had one major expansion ) . 
  age of kings has had similar treatment . 
  mass effect 1 had two major dlc . 
  me :2 had 7 , plus a bunch of bullshitty ones . 
  i ca n't comment on me :3 , i have n't gotten around to playing it yet . 
  that 's just a few from some games i 've played recently . 
  i really do n't think the situation is nearly as dire as you make it out to be . 
  yes there 's a lot of bullshitty dlc that gives you an item or two , or changes cosmetics , but there 's still a hell of a lot of good content dlc out there . 
  oh sorry , i did n't realise you were being literal . 
  i thought you meant a metaphorical game designed based on the best of 3 and 4e . 
  do n't forget that pieces in sonata form in a minor key will often have a second theme in the relative major , rather than the dominant . 
  in these cases , the recapitulation of the second theme will typically be in the parallel major ( the major key with the same root note ) . 
  are you familiar with [ this prestige class ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3q7vx1/vampire _ prestige_class_v03_more_flavor_progress / ) someone else made for vampires ? 
  in general , i agree that this makes good horror . 
  but it * does n't * make for good * characters * . 
  and to me , characters are what d&d is * all about * . 
  a player who becomes a vampire , or who has some internal struggle from a different source , such as being a vryloka or tiefling , or if they made a deal with a devil and became a warlock , has * so much * potential for interesting character development , that to say that they must be utterly , entirely evil with no remorse or repentance feels to me as though it loses so much potential . 
  now , in building a villain , or creating side-npcs , what you describe is a brilliant approach . 
  strong unreasonable villains are fantastic , and there is so much that can be done with a vampire that 's very close to stoker 's original novel . 
  but telling a player that they ca n't play this type of interesting character seems needlessly restrictive to me , and it 's deliberately closing the door on some brilliant character arcs , and to me that is very unfortunate . 
  and as / u/the _ singular_anyone says , part of the fright of stoker 's vampires , and those in films that closely resemble his , is that the people in the universe do n't know what 's going on . 
  hell , around the time dracula was first released , and perhaps with some of the earlier films , i would n't be surprised if even the * viewers * did n't know very much about vampiric lore . 
  in a game , you lose that , because the players * will * know * everything * about vampires , and even if they 're * really * good at meta-gaming , completely ignoring all the signs of a vampire is just not going to happen . 
  so that sense of lovecraftian horror just is n't possible with vampires . 
  we have one proposal for deputy speaker , and none so far for second deputy speaker . 
  is there any further proposal ? 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' , or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease 30/10/2015 at 11:00 am utc +10 . 
  ## votes, 
  ** ayes ** : 6, 
  ** noes ** : 0, 
  abstentions/yet to vote : 4, 
  ### i think the ayes have it . 
  the motion has been agreed to . 
  speaker of the house, 
  paging / u/3fun / u/cyberpolis / u/iamthepotato8 for vote . 
  paging / u/madcreek3 / u/phyllicanderer / u/primeviere for vote . 
  paging / u/ser _ scribbles / u/thewhiteferret for vote . 
  paging / u/this _ guy22 / u/zamt for vote . 
  present, 
  the biggest problem here is that things do n't happen in real time . 
  it 's very possible for a question to be asked and answered before the speaker ever sees it . 
  this never happens in real parliament . 
  so if a question has been answered , i would say just allow it . 
  and because of that , to keep things consistent , i think the best approach is to just allow a question unless someone asks that it be disallowed . 
  as for a potentially biased enforcement , well , that 's obviously a factor even in real life parliament . 
  i do n't think this would impact that either way . 
  all it means is that the speaker need not even consider removing a question unless another member believes it to be offensive to the sos . 
  once it is raised as an issue , the same bias or lack thereof comes into play as in real parliament . 
  i would note that / u/ser _ scribbles is the member for regional queensland , and not for brisbane & surrounds . 
  the nomination is noted nonetheless . 
  the hon. 
  zagorath mp, 
  member for brisbane & surrounds, 
  speaker of the house, 
  an individual having a desire for revenge is n't wrong .
