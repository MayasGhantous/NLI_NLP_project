  the state sponsoring that revenge ( or treating an individual who * gets * that revenge as anything other than a murderer ) is what is wrong . 
  in the future , if you want to be reminded in the same way as a person who has already used the remind me bot , you can just click the link that says '' ** click this link ** '' , and then click send , and it will set up the same reminder for you that it did for them . 
  we have one proposal for the deputy speaker , and one for the second deputy speaker . 
  is there any further proposal ? 
   this promotion is open to residents of the fifty ( 50 ) united states and the district of columbia only, 
  are they gon na check that ? 
  is there anything stopping a tourist from walking in and taking advantage of the promotion , if they happen to be in america at the time ? 
  but why is everyone talking about him after * this * episode . 
  did he make an appearance ? 
  i do n't recall ever hearing the name mentioned ... though i could have missed it . 
  the skype problem was with the developer ( though it does n't really matter whose fault it is , it 's a reason for most people to avoid a platform if there is a lack of good software that they want for that platform ) . 
  the dropbox and chrome ones were with ubuntu 's software centre/package manager . 
  yeah like i said in the other thread , i 've reached the point now where i just use the terminal for just about everything on ubuntu . 
  i have no problem with doing that . 
  just need to google what the name of the package i want to install is . 
  the problem is that for normal users the terminal is too frightening . 
  and frankly , even installing a different software centre is something most users are never going to use . 
  so while it 's okay for you and i , it 's just not close to being usable for average users . 
  oh right . 
  i do n't watch the teasers , to avoid spoilers . 
  they 've obviously in separate universes , because superman has been active in this universe for years , but nobody in the arrowverse has ever heard of him . 
  but with flash 's multiverse stuff , they could still do a cross-over down the line . 
  imdb has a community ? 
  i just go there for cast listings etc. 
  in cases where wikipedia does n't have all the information i want . 
  the fact that he 's never been mentioned is pretty definitive proof . 
  with all the vigilantism and heroics that have gone on , * someone * would have compared them to superman at some point . 
  the fact that they have n't is proof enough . 
  plus , people seemed to have no idea about the existence of meta-humans and related superpowers , which would not have been the case if superman was about . 
  and of course there 's never an episode that * mentions * that they 've never heard of superman . 
  the very notion of that makes no sense . 
  anyone got a non-blocked version of this ? 
  anyone got a non-geo-blocked version of this ? 
  sanguine strike is the core feature of this class . 
  without it , it would be a great class for flavour , but mechanically it would be just a plain * bad * choice . 
  yeah it functions similarly to smites , and that 's not ideal , but you ca n't just remove such a core ability . 
  and there 's only so much room for new mechanics before some things are * bound * to overlap . 
  it 's better to reuse an existing mechanic than to make up a new mechanic that functions poorly or makes no sense . 
  the full-caster progression is also necessary , on account of sanguine strike using spell slots , and being the core of the class 's damage output . 
  the spell list is severely limited compared to other casters , so it wo n't come across too arcane . 
  vital reserves and blood drinker certainly could be combined into one feature . 
  but all that would do is make things more complicated to read about and understand , without changing the mechanics in any way . 
  literally the only thing it would accomplish is decrease the arbitrary number of abilities the class has , which is a stupid goal to aspire to in and of itself . 
   after the ritual is completed , the creature arises from the grave ... and lasts until it dies , ** you perform this ritual again ** , or you use an action to cause it to disintegrate into dust . 
  emphasis mine . 
  clearly you can only raise one minion . 
  the first paragraph you refer to says that when used as normal ( spending one point on your turn ) you gain resistance to psychic , radiant , and sunlight damage . 
  the second one is if you create your mist form as a * reaction * , rather than on your turn . 
  it costs two blood points , rather than one , and confers all the advantages it normally would , including resistance to the damage that you reacted to in order to become a mist form . 
  with charm person and eyes of the enticer , * you * do n't have advantage * or * disadvantage . 
  you do n't do anything . 
  the * target * makes a saving throw against the ability , and if you are engaged in combat with it , it gains advantage against the saving throw . 
  the weird flying off the highway was an excuse to make a joke about the cape . 
  it `` aids aerodynamics '' or something . 
  right before she first woke up in the government department 's lair , she was shot down with kryptonite darts . 
  is this something you actually believe , or the explanation you 're providing on their behalf ? 
  i do n't think they care too much about revealing the plot . 
  partly because hey , it 's just the first episode of a completely new show . 
  but also partly for damage-control reasons , since most people who are interested have probably already seen the * entire * first episode thanks to the leak . 
  yeah , it 's definitely possible . 
  many of us here unlearned qwerty to switch to dvorak , so i do n't see why dvorak to b\u00e9po would n't be possible . 
  if you have an ally directly behind you ( or , indeed , diagonally behind you ) , that ally is within 5 feet of you , but * not * within 5 feet of the enemy , so you do n't get sneak attack . 
  if there are two enemies within 5 feet of you , you do n't get sneak attack . 
   without an ally within 5ft of the target, 
  careful now . 
  it does n't need to be an ally within 5 feet of the target . 
  just an enemy of the target . 
  95 % of the time that 'll be an ally , but it could also be a person on a third faction who is an enemy to both you and your target . 
  also , a majority of firies ' interactions with the public are them successfully helping in some way . 
  most cops ' interactions with the public are , by virtue of the job , negative . 
  either telling them off for having done something wrong , or costing them time , or investigating a break-in that they 've got very little chance of actually solving . 
  so it 's no surprise if people 's opinion of firies tends to be better than that of cops . 
  weird fan theory : in earth-1 ( the arrowverse ) , kal-el arrives on earth , but somehow gets a tiny amount of kryptonium stuck in him , so he 's permanently weakened enough to appear purely human . 
  he gets found by some humans who have no idea where he came from , and he 's raised as completely normal . 
  earth-3 ( which is what i 'm going to dub supergirl 's universe , for now ) has the superman story play at as normal . 
  both are brandon routh . 
  this is a terrible idea , but it was funny to think of . 
  the time for proposals has expired . 
  congratulations to / u/3fun , member for western australia , for becoming the new deputy speaker , and to / u/ser _ scribbles , hon. 
  member for regional queensland , for becoming the new second deputy speaker . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  i 'd rather leave it as `` voting '' until either everyone has voted , or the time has run out , since there are 4 people still yet to vote , even if the result has already been called . 
  but jnd is free to overrule me on this if he wants . 
  4e had the fantastic book `` heroes of shadow '' , which had a great class in it for playing vampires with a sense of progression . 
  it also had the vryloka race , for some vampiric flavour without going all out into vampire . 
  they also had some * really * interesting unique lore of their own . 
  a user on / r/unearthedarcana is working on [ a really cool vampire prestige class ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3qnv6q/vampire _ prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big / ) that 's pretty much finalised at this point , and has a very nice progression from class levels 1 to 5 . 
  this violates betteridge 's law of headlines . 
  the synergy between luck and disadvantage is insane . 
  yeah , i got ta say , i 'm really hoping to see wizards repackage heroes of shadow . 
  i want an official vryloka race and vampire prestige class , in particular , because both of them are just so awesome with so many possibilities , but revenants and shades are pretty cool too . 
  abp has been selling whitelist access for a * long * time . 
  quite a few years . 
  but it 's nowhere near as insidious as it sounds . 
  before you 're allowed to pay them to unblock your ads , you have to meet their quite reasonable guidelines for an acceptable ad . 
  obvious stuff like no take-overs , no big flashy distracting ads , etc. 
  ; it 's a win-win . 
  abp makes money off the deal , consumers get ads that are n't annoying as fuck , and site owners do n't get ripped off by having to serve traffic to people who are n't helping to pay . 
  i dunno , at least one of the top comments sounds reasonable for like 90 % of its contents , and then in the last paragraph just nonchalantly turns into that type of conspiracy type thing . 
  it just tries to hide that aspect of it .
