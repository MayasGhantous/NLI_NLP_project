  you could get your friend to record if they are on a computer , though . 
  it 's a bit odd for some things , but if you 're on a mac press control-option-command-8 . 
  there 's also [ turn off the lights ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/turn-off-the-lights/bfbmjmiodbnnpllbbbfblcplfjjepjdn ) , which is mainly for viewing videos ( and is amazing for that ) , but if you do n't want to interact with the page can do a pretty good job of darkening the page . 
  i never knew this . 
  i always thought 911 was police , and the us had separate numbers for fire and ambulance . 
  in aus i know that it 's just one number for all three of them , but i guess since in the media and movies and stuff the only references to 911 are ever about police , i just never thought of it . 
  mr transcriber , i think you may have broked . 
  actually , should n't a two party system in theory result in a race to the centre on political ideals from the parties ? 
  the republicans are going to get all the crazy right-wingers anyway because they hate the democrats so much , and vice versa , so should n't they be doing everything they can to win over the centrist voters , at least in theory ? 
  socially conservative , fiscally liberal , lines up to the top right quadrant of the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org ) . 
  top right and bottom left are actually the two most popular quadrants , overall . 
  you get some extreme libertarians in the bottom right , and hard-core communists in the top left , but the majority of people fit roughly on the line y = x. 
  we 're the same in australia . 
  our current opposition party ( which has a very good chance of winning in the next election ) is lead by people who fairly clearly seem to not believe in climate change , but if he actually came out and admitted he does not believe in climate chance it would be a terrible move for him politically . 
  a virgin got pregnant by god and gave birth to jesus , who is also god . 
  i want to know what a `` web-no question '' is . 
  i 'm surprised a supposedly high-quality blog like them does n't know how to use a proper em-dash . 
  i do the same thing when it 's a `` look who i met '' post . 
  i prefer the interrogbang, 
  you do quotes by adding ''  '' to the front of the line . 
   why not just respond back to her with an honest answer ? 
  perhaps if she really is `` overly attached '' she would be inclined to not believe it . 
  tbh i would probably both forward it to the friend and reply honestly . 
  brilliant idea , but how does one go about that ? 
  ah , this one sounds more convincing than the other reply i got ( albeit less funny ) . 
  [ put the spoiler here ] ( / spoiler ), 
  i agree completely , except the last sentence . 
  i do n't think it makes sense to switch from an amazing product to another , lower quality , one , just because the amazing one has a monopoly . 
  you can block specific domains in res . 
  does question 7 refer to actual 3d ( as in , with glasses ) or just the engine ? 
  and what would qualify as 2d vs 2.5 d vs 3d ? 
  particularly what does 2.5 d actually mean ? 
  just so you know , marathon is n't part of athletics ( or , as you called it , `` track and field '' ) , it 's a road event . 
  otherwise , good survey , and i 've completed it . 
  unfortunately , i was in south america over the summer ( well , unfortunately is hardly a fair way to put it really ) , and they have absolutely no interest in the olympics , so i could n't watch any . 
  edit : oh , and i 'm not from the us , so i guessed what my gpa would have been . 
  as i always say when this comes up , ** put an option for percentage ** . 
  nearly any schooling system can be easily converted into some form of percentage mark , even lettered grades ( if you had a -- e , give e 0 points and a 4 points , for example ) . 
  since he 's asking for pounds and feet , i 'd say he 'll assume it 's gridiron . 
  better to say soccer , or say `` football , uk '' or something like that . 
  ( oh , and just because pounds and feet are so stupid , i gave my answers to those in kilos and centimetres , but wrote cm and kg after it so it 's clear . ), 
  yeah , i saw the title and first thought it was / r/technology or / r/worldnews , but after seeing it was here i was * really * surprised . 
  definitely more likely to belong in / r/atheism than / r/trueatheism , but even there it would n't fit in perfectly . 
  that escalated quickly . 
  i think her * role * is much better in downton . 
  in potter the writing for her character was less interesting . 
  at first i read that as the `` christian right [ wing ] '' . 
  it still made sense . 
  does anyone know if the blog actually owns the rights to these recordings , and if so what are the licensing deals ? 
  could one use these recordings royalty-free in videos , for example ? 
  really ? 
  i read the about page and found it did n't give an answer to that question . 
  edit : could you point out the exact line where he says that ? 
  which is more than enough to call `` high quality '' , if the quality of the recording is otherwise good ( e.g. , no clipping audio , no background noise , buzzing , etc. 
  iirc , there is a similar thing with google on android phones , and it has been used . 
  perhaps [ this ] ( http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/02/heres-samsung-flew-bloggers-halfway-around-world-threatened-leave/ ) , [ this ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/03/samsung-tech-bloggers ) ( same story , different article ) , and [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sabl2wy1uzo ) will set you straight . 
  yes , exactly . 
  if empathy was only for others in the same position as you , what would be the point in ever talking about it ? 
  it is if everyone in this thread does it !, 
  and then buys the dvd * and * bluray * and * digital copy when it comes out . 
  maybe the planet is disk shaped due to a particularly fast rotation ? 
  someone should ask / r/shittyaskscience, 
  but first make sure half a dozen other people have done the same thing before you . 
  actually if you wanted to see things in more detail on earth from space you 'd want a good telephoto lens . 
  ( sorry if this is n't what you were talking about , the post above you has been deleted . ), 
  their world could even * actually * be flat . 
  it does n't have to be in our universe with our real-world physics . 
  this also belongs on 9gag . 
  but those numbers would probably not actually work . 
  they 've chosen the price that they believe will give them the maximum profit . 
  when the price is low enough , increasing the price will result in an increase in profits , even if less people come ( the demand is price inelastic ) , but when the price gets too high , further increases in price will result in a lower profit because more and more people will decide it 's too much for them ( the demand is price elastic ) . 
  but this scenario really only needs microeconomics to work , if we assume ceteris paribus . 
  by the way , are you referring to secondary school or university ? 
  because afaik people usually use the term semester to refer to uni ( although i realise technically it can be used for secondary school ) , but i leant this stuff in high school economics . 
  i 'm no audiophile , but i would use the term high quality to refer to anything that sounds nice , especially in the case of free music like this . 
  looking through my itunes library , the lowest bitrate i have is a track from the first harry potter movie that 's at 56kbps . 
  to my ears , on my speakers , the quality is indistinguishable from other tracks from the same movie , on which the modal bitrate is 128kbps and there are a number as high as 160 . 
  another recording i have is mozart 's piano concerto no. 21 , mvt . 
  i 've got one at 56kbps and one at 256 ( variable ) . 
  the latter is noticeably better , but i would never have thought of the former as being low quality . 
  the highest bit rate i have is a voice recording a friend sent me as practice for an oral exam , at 705kbps . 
  it has a constant buzzing noise in the background . 
  i would call this a low quality recording . 
  same goes for the jpeg . 
  i could take a still frame from a bluray disk , convert it to a jpeg image and it would be high definition ( if by hd we mean 1920 x 1080 ) . 
  similarly , i can take a raw photo off of my dslr convert it to jpeg ( setting quality to 12 in photoshop ) , and if it was shot with good exposure and no major problems ( dust on the lens , shake , etc. ), 
  it would be a high quality photo from a technical perspective . 
  the key point is not that higher bit rates have high * er * quality ( that is , in general , a given ) , but that a low bit rate does not necessarily make the recording bad quality : even a very low bit rate can have a good enough quality to be describe as good . 
  edit : in short , ops use of high quality refers to the fact that free recordings are typically either amateur ( and low quality from a musical perspective ) or use low-quality/old equipment and have buzzing ( or the noise from a record player ) , whereas these are neither ; it is perfectly valid from this perspective . 
  editedit : see recordings on wikipedia or imslp for examples of that ( usually ) . 
  last year ? 
  for me they usually end up on facebook after a week or so . 
  although i have a suspicion it 's actually reddit -  9gag -  facebook . 
  yeah , if he were going to do it , advertising it on facebook before he does it is not a good idea . 
  unless he 's doing it to lure the guy there before telling police . 
  come on man , you ca n't lock up an entire country . 
  yeah , something tells me that this would work with baroque and a good portion of classical , but very little romantic . 
  bach , handel , and mozart would be good , but beethoven , wagner , and tchaikovsky probably would n't . 
  ** beethoven ** :, 
  ushered in the romantic period of music ( known for expanding the orchestra even further , especially brass and percussion , as well as for a greater degree of expression and emotion in the music ) .
