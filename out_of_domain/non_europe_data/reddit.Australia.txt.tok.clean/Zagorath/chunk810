  okay . 
  [ here 's the latest changelog ] ( https://www.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/41.0.2/releasenotes/ ) . 
  where in there does it say `` pushes suggested ads on the new tab window '' ? 
  because all i 'm seeing is security fixes . 
  [ this site seems to be one that would have a much less biased sample ] ( http://gs.statcounter.com/ ) . 
  it notes a touch over 55 % for chrome . 
  ie and firefox are each at about 17 % , safari at 4 % and opera almost makes 2 % . 
  so while chrome certainly does n't get 65 % by itself , combining it and firefox gets up to that sort of supermajority level . 
   do iranian laws still apply even if you 're abroad ? 
  in certain cases the same applies to most countries . 
  the best example is child sex abuse . 
  virtually every western country will hold you responsible under their own laws even if you go overseas and commit it elsewhere . 
  obviously iran uses this power in a way that fundamentally goes against human rights , but even so , the idea of enforcing local laws for crimes committed internationally is not a novel one . 
  yeah that 's the one i was referencing . 
  and to be honest , the absolute worst bit of that was not the gorhill quote , it was the last paragraph that the commenter added themselves . 
  total conspiracy nutballery . 
  yeah fair point . 
  that 's a much more positive way to look at it . 
  well i 'm not genuinely suggesting it , but that was the idea i was getting at , yes . 
  oh , i just picked 3 as the next number in the sequence . 
  could n't be 1 because that 's the arrowverse , and 2 seems unlikely since that 's where garrick comes from . 
  i was n't considering any extra lore beyond that . 
  yeah , palmer 's appearance on the flash was met with `` it 's a bird , it 's a plane '' . 
  attorneys general . 
  governors general ( i think -- might be wrong about that one ) . 
  the reason it works this way is quite simple . 
  `` in law '' goes through marriage . 
  it does n't just relate to * your * spouse , it goes through any marriages . 
  yikes , search engines do n't get safe harbour here ? 
  do we at least have safe harbour for content sharing sites like facebook and youtube ? 
  what would that be ? 
  i 've done this before in game . 
  a guy was falling from a dragon , and we wanted to know if he would have time to take an action during the fall . 
  so i calculated the time the fall would take , assuming standard acceleration of 9.81 ms ^ -1 . 
  as it turns out , he did not have time , it was something like 3 seconds . 
  maybe where you are it is . 
  not everywhere . 
  i doubt it , most d&d players are nerds . 
  they love this stuff . 
  cc-by-nc-sa is best cc . 
  all 2 of them ? 
  nah , who am i kidding . 
  there are n't even two . 
  running to get the best out of yourself : to score a pb , or at least to meet some sort of personal goal , is great . 
  it 's basically the only way i ever run . 
  and there is absolutely nothing wrong with doing that . 
  but it * is n't * running to win . 
  running to win means running with the aim of * winning * the race . 
  i.e. , coming first . 
  you 're right , it was n't wednesday anywhere . 
  i was n't defending the extent to which the title applies to the time of posting , i was merely stating a fact . 
  it was actually further * away * from accurate , being friday , anywhere from utc +6 onwards . 
  fwiw , you can actually get the exact time of posting by hovering over the `` 9 hours ago '' ( as it currently says ) text . 
  this one was submitted at 04:06:55 at utc +10 . 
  adblock plus has an `` acceptable ads '' programme . 
  they let certain ads through , provided that ** both ** ( a ) they get paid for it , and ( b ) * they meet the acceptable ads requirements * . 
  that means no take-overs , no annoying flashy ads , etc. 
  the acceptable ads programme is a * very good thing * . 
  it means the site still gets to make money ( because blocked ads cost the site money in bandwidth , but make zero revenue ) , abp makes some money to help continue development , and consumers still get to avoid shitty ads . 
  another way to achieve the same effect is to have some sort of patron of the party -- a guy who gives them a quest or something similar to do -- give the pcs a reward in exchange for doing something for him . 
  then he presents them with different options for the reward . 
  nope , that 's what makes lucky so powerful . 
   you have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment . 
   whenever you make an attack roll ... you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20 ... you choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll . 
  in terms of both its flavour text and its mechanics , it 's pretty specifically calling out the possibility of using it on disadvantage to turn it into a sort of `` super-advantage '' . 
  it definitely is . 
  the exact wording is :, 
   you have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment . 
   whenever you make an attack roll ... you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20 ... you choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll . 
  the flavour clearly points at the idea that the luck has the greatest effect right when you need it most . 
  and the mechanics very clearly say that you roll one * more * die than you already were going to roll , and then out of all the d20s , choose which roll gets used . 
  newegg sells a much broader variety of products ( at least in the us ) than msy . 
  msy is pretty much just the sort of stuff you 'd want for building and equipping a pc . 
  newegg also has broader consumer electronics stuff . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  australians and new zealanders get lumped in to the same group as chinese , who get lumped in with egyptians ? 
  and canadians are with western europe ? 
  what ? 
  just stick to using a list of countries , dude . 
  edit : wow , that took me way longer to write than it would have when i finished high school ... savoir vs. conna\u00eetre has always been one i 've had trouble remembering . 
  i 'll just say , while i 've never experienced chocolate covered sultanas * in a biscuit * , chocolate sultanas in general are absolutely awesome little snacks . 
  i definitely do n't regret it . 
  it 's the best academic high school programme in the world , in my opinion . 
  sure , many universities in the uk and the us do n't give it the recognition it deserves , but in my opinion one should choose a programme primarily based on the education it will provide them , and not specifically for the university . 
  a-levels in particular are an absolutely ** crap ** high school system . 
  3 ( or * maybe * 4 ) subjects , chosen with absolutely no rules ? 
  that 's just stupid . 
  you 're not in university , you 're way too young to be specialising that much yet . 
  not to mention that even if it * were * aiming to allow that sort of specialisation , its syllabi are on average about * on par * with ib hl subjects , whereas one would expect it should be significantly more in-depth . 
  maths , unfortunately , is one subject where ib is * substantially * harder than nearly any equivalent course you will come across . 
  haha yeah not google translate . 
  google translate would definitely have been way faster , though . 
  dude , regardless of the accuracy ( or lack thereof ) of this , it 's really not the place . 
  so , is there anything left to do this sitting day , or can we close up until monday ? 
  hmm , i must be missing something , then . 
  what is it i need to do ? 
  as far as i can see , that particular clause only really relates to the pm reporting on what he and i had already done . 
  i can now report that i , accompanied by the honourable members then present , proceeded to the members hall and presented myself to his excellency the governor-general as the choice of the house as its speaker and that his excellency was kind enough to congratulate me . 
  ah right , got it . 
  i musta missed that section .
