  done now . 
  it * nearly * works correctly , but when the window gets too thin , the furthest left of the sidebar just slightly overlaps the far right text . 
  [ here 's a screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x1fidfl.png ) demonstrating this . 
  if you 're on ios , you should really grab alien blue . 
  on android , reddit is fun is my favourite . 
  reddit in general is a horrible experience on mobile in the browser , and an app is basically must-have . 
   in a campaign without a cleric , the simplest wound takes days to heal . 
  much like the real, 
  world , you might be laid up in bed for a week or more . 
  this is simple not true . 
  that , in 5e ( which is what these classes are nominally built for ) , it takes days to heal basic wounds . 
   you ca n't cast 2 spells in a round, 
  this is not correct . 
  the actual rule is that if you cast a spell as a * bonus action * , you can not also cast a spell except for a cantrip * during the same turn * . 
  counterspell is a reaction , and thus technically does not take place as part of your turn , so it is exempt from this . 
  and even if it were n't for that , you can cast two spells in one turn as long as they are n't a bonus action . 
  a fighter/wizard with action surge , for example , could cast two fireballs in one turn . 
   this means that reaction spells are affected, 
  i 'm guessing you meant to say `` reaction spells are * not * affected '' ? 
  could you explain exactly what it is that you gain out of that app ? 
  i 'm hesitant to throw $ 1.30 at a thing sight unseen , especially if part of the description i 've been given is that it 's slightly large ( even if i would be paying it out of the google survey credit ... ) . 
  you should probably note that the way it 's worded , it does n't actually grant `` advantage '' . 
  so if the thing you 're referring to with your rogue was using it to sneak attack , it actually does n't let you do that , raw . 
  you say that `` one '' was against the rules ? 
  why ? 
  if it was because you said no numbers , one must remember that `` one '' is not just a number , it has other meanings as well . 
  lastpass is fantastic . 
  they have an app for basically any platform you can think of , including a web-based version so you can even use it on unfamiliar computers . 
  unfortunately , the free version does n't let you use the app on mobile platforms . 
  personally this is n't a problem , in the rare case i need to sign in to a fresh website on my phone , i use the web interface . 
  if it were more of a problem for you , it 's only $ 1 per month to unlock the ability to use it everywhere . 
  they also have two factor authentication options out the wazoo , for extra security . 
  if you 're concerned about using a tool like this , you really need n't be . 
  [ watch this video , from 53 minutes in ] ( https://youtu.be/r9q_anb7pwg ) for an explanation of why it is absolutely 100 % safe to use . 
  number or some other value , yes . 
  i 've seen a lot of people * mention * him on cc , but in the time i 've been there i do n't think i 've actually seen him post anything . 
  it looked to me like he voluntarily ran out , rather than resisting being pushed out . 
  oh man that 's a really cool idea . 
  so it does its normal sword damage , and then does 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 frost damage , or whatever ? 
  but it only actually does the difference between the two ? 
  my dm gave me a cloak of resist fire with a twist . 
  once per day , as a reaction to taking melee damage , i can activate its power , and for the next minute , every opponent that makes a melee attack against me receives half as much damage back to them as fire damage . 
  the thing is also cursed . 
  once worn , it 's bearer feels a great sense of warmth . 
  but if they then take it off , they feel an overwhelming coldness . 
  keep it off for too long and they 'll start experiencing cold damage . 
  yeah , i 'll give it a go . 
  i 've no professional experience in the area , but i 'm a software engineering student and i 've done a few courses on user experience/hci . 
  i 'm an android user . 
  you say you have dice , but really , you can never have too many dice . 
  `` australian politician '' being motherfucking scott ludlam . 
  deputy leader of the australian greens , and we 'll known for being the biggest defender of internet privacy , net neutrality , and all things technology . 
  the dude can basically do no wrong . 
  and now he plays d&d , too ? 
  wow . 
  is this gon na be recorded and uploaded somewhere afterwards ? 
  that sounds really cool . 
  and from the way you worded it , i 'm guessing you apply resistances or vulnerabilities * before * doing the subtraction ? 
  hear , hear !, 
  yeah i just use ms. and miss to mean the same thing . 
  seriously . 
  somehow segfaults sometimes occur * without * even executing the code that came before the point of the fault . 
  so using ` printf ` to try and get information about the state right before the fault is impossible . 
  [ this old story describes such a situation with an immovable rod ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2cvz5x/using _ the_dms_rules_against_him / ) . 
  surely it 's an item you ( or someone else at your table ) came up with yourself , raw is whatever you want it to be ? 
  haha you know what , that might actually have been the problem . 
  it 's been a while since i 've needed to do it , though . 
  i 've gotten relatively good at just avoiding segfaults in the first place , or using gdb to solve the problem when necessary , rather than printing values . 
  yeah that is n't working for me anymore , either . 
  * sometimes * , if i 've already voted on a particular comment , but i come back to the page and change my vote later , res will change the vote tally tag . 
  so if i upvote someone , then go back later and remove that upvote , res will look like i just downvoted them once . 
  but even that does n't always happen . 
  no idea why it stopped working properly , though ... 
  well , after [ this thread ] ( / r/brisbane/comments / 3qrgrm/redback _ spider_numbers_booming_in_queenslands / ) yesterday , it really could be either . 
  fiend warlocks get temp hp of charisma mod + warlock level whenever they kill an enemy . 
  loosely related , but i just wan na make sure you 're playing sneak attack right , because a lot of people seem to not understand how it works . 
  he does n't actually need to be hiding in order to get his bonus damage from sneak attack . 
  yes , if he 's hiding , that will give him advantage , and having advantage is one way to use sneak attack . 
  however , another way to get it is simply to have an ally within 5 feet of the enemy he 's targetting . 
  the publishers in america thought american kids would n't be smart enough to understand what the philosopher 's stone is . 
  surely this has to be a paper town , and not a real thing , right ? 
  now the obvious important question is : how would you stat out elphaba ? 
  as the article says , the security risk in practice was absolutely minimal . 
  the way password security works , it is computationally * extremely * expensive for them to have gotten from what got leaked to your actual data . 
  and indeed , it would be * impossible * for them to do anything with it once you change your password ( which , thanks to how hard it is to attack the hashed password , you have time to do ) . 
  [ here 's some more detail on the matter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujdaytxtpam ) . 
  that 's not to play down the scale of the breach . 
  it was certainly significant . 
  it 's just that users need not worry about it in practice , so long as their password is a strong one ( and after all , the point of password managers is that you * can * have a strong password , since you 're only actually memorising * one * ) and they change it as soon as they can , it 's fine . 
  and it 's certainly far better than a roll-your-own solution , since you * know * that they have done every single aspect of the security correctly . 
  just a tip , you meant to say `` i could n't care less '' . 
  but that 's bullshit . 
  at least in the us , uk , and canada , the exact opposite is true . 
  ib gets rated far less than it deserves . 
  us lte is barely better than the top-tier australian 3g tech . 
  our 4g stuff blows america out of the water . 
  now if only the same were even remotely true of our home/non-mobile internet ... 
  i 'm wondering , why does n't your wicked version have the vulnerability to water and acid ? 
  the most important spec in games is your graphics card . 
  the rest of your specs are fantastic , and there 's absolutely no way they 're causing problems .
