  but do you have a discrete graphics card ? 
  unfortunately , these days none but the absolute top most new macs tend to have them . 
  so , this is a little late , but [ incompetech ] ( http://incompetech.com/ ) is a fantastic resource for music . 
  it 's really popular with amateur film makers and the like because the music is royalty free . 
  [ this page is a collection of his music entitled `` horror soundscapes '' ] ( http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?collection=037&amp;search=search ) , so really anything from there could be good , depending on what you 're after . 
  [ this collection ] ( http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?collection=038 ) is `` horror themes '' , and has music with a bit more of a defined shape to it . 
  it 's also a great pick for spooky atmosphere . 
  the game / r/tagpro uses a track from there called [ `` evening of chaos '' ] ( http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=usuan1300041 ) for its hallowe'en event , and it 's pretty eerie . 
  uh ... that is definitely not necessarily the case . 
  it might have been in this case , but can you not see how everyone ganging up on one person could very easily be a simple case of bullying : a large group ganging up against a single person ? 
  also , you meant `` then '' , not `` than '' , `` if - then '' work in a pair ( and generally take place in the same sentence -- no need for the full stop ) . 
  yeah , i definitely would not have made the connection if it were n't pointed out to me . 
  this is one joke that actually * does * still work after it 's explained , though . 
  at least , if the extent of the explaining is `` she 's sioux '' . 
  sars can also be short for sarsaparilla . 
  so maybe she just has a lot of shitty soft drink that looks like coke but tastes nothing like it . 
  [ this thread has a heap of good pieces ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalresources/comments/13g721/themes_halloweenspookyscary/ ) . 
  only if you go with the big guys . 
  australia has a * really * healthy mvno culture . 
  companies like [ amaysim ] ( https://www.amaysim.com.au/ ) , [ vaya ] ( http://www.vaya.net.au/ ) , and [ yatango ] ( https://yatango.com.au/ ) give you access to the optus network for super cheap prices . 
  amaysim is the biggest of the mvnos , and also probably the worst in terms of prices , but even with them , you can get 5 gb per month for just $ 45 . 
  yatango is the only one of these that also sells hardware , as far as i know . 
  looking at the iphone 6 , you can get unlimited calls , sms , and 4 gb data for about the same price as your $ 75 per month estimate with the big guys , over the course of 24 months . 
  if you choose to have less sms , calls , or data ( because with yatango , you can build your own plan ) , you can get it for way less than an average of $ 75 per month over 24 months . 
  and you get the advantage of being able to leave at any time for a different plan on the same company , or for another company entirely , since it 's not a lock-in contract . 
  that 's assuming the 16 gb iphone 6 , which yatango sells for $ 870 on their website . 
  basically , anyone who goes with optus directly is just poorly informed , because it is an objectively * bad * decision . 
  and the only reason to be with telstra is if you really do need that extra coverage in rural areas , because otherwise it is also an objectively dumb decision . 
  they actually really are n't . 
  our two biggest players are insanely overpriced , but we have a very healthy mvno culture here , so if you go with someone that resells the network of one of the big guys , you can get a fantastic deal . 
  it 's a bit like ting in america , which is way better than going with at&t or verizon , except that even ting 's prices are no where near as good as the mvnos in australia . 
  witch bolt uses 1d12 per spell slot level , so theoretically could need up to 9d12 . 
  in practice i ca n't possibly imagine most casters using more than 3d12 with it , because there are just better options . 
  a warlock might use a 5th level spell slot , since all their slots are at the highest level ( up to 5th level slots ) . 
  but even that seems unlikely , since natively 5th level spells are going to be more effective anyway . 
  i 've not seen the musical , but in the book she absolutely * is * vulnerable to water . 
  she dies at the end . 
  it 's not anticompetitive to charge a fee for purchases made through the payment system that they set up . 
  i honestly do n't think either party is at fault here . 
  apple choosing to charge a fee seems reasonable , and google deciding to charge more in order to make the same net is also reasonable . 
  that 's a folk etymology for the british two fingered hand sign ( like a `` peace '' v , but in reverse ) . 
  but it 's likely incorrect . 
  there 's no real evidence that the french actually chopped off the fingers of captured englishmen . 
   when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher , the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st . 
  there 's no cap on the slot used for the initial attack ( though each subsequent turn 's continuing damage is always 1d12 , no matter the slot level ) . 
  the thing is , i really do n't think many people actually need that unlimited call and sms . 
  personally , i get by on ** zero ** of either , i payg for them i use them so rarely . 
  now , i 'm probably at the other extreme , but most people can easily get by somewhere in between , especially these days with so many good messenger clients out there ( my social circle mostly uses facebook messenger , but whatsapp seems to be popular among some groups , and google hangouts is pretty widely used ) . 
  and even voip is pretty commonplace these days . 
  so while it 's easy to look at comparisons that give unlimited call and text , really it 's an unfair comparison , because an intelligent consumer is likely not to get that if they have the choice . 
  but with optus and telstra they do n't have that much choice . 
  optus has byo plans that are actually only slightly below the curve , but they still are below the curve compared to the popular mvnos . 
  amaysim 's 1 gb + unlimited call & sms is $ 5 per month cheaper than optus 's , and their 5 gb is $ 10 cheaper . 
  yatango gives 1.5 gb for the same price as optus 's 1 gb , or 6 gb for the same price as optus 's 5 . 
  telstra 's byo plans are just utter stupidity . 
  for 500 mb , unlimited sms , and `` $ 300 worth of talk '' ( they do n't actually even bother telling you on their site what the rates are for calls in terms of flagfall and per-minute cost , but they do say that a 2 min . 
  call is $ 2 , but whatever it is , that $ x worth of talk style terminology is horribly anti-consumer ) . 
  $ 50 will get you 2.5 gb data and $ 1000 talk . 
  that 's not even close to competitive . 
  unless you really do need the extra coverage because you 're going out into the country regularly , going with telstra is just a dumb choice . 
  and even if you go with the lock-in contract version where they bundle a device , as your own calculations demonstrate , the byo version with an mvno is substantially cheaper than the locked in telstra contract . 
  a margin of almost 33 % . 
  regarding yatango 's hardware sales specifically , i merely used that to compare like for like as closely as possible . 
  the great advantage of byo is that you can buy it from wherever you want . 
  buy it through yatango , through kogan , direct from the manufacturer , or whatever you like . 
  whatever has the best balance of price , quality , and trustworthiness for your desires . 
  the other advantage is not being locked in . 
  if you discover after a month or two that you actually use a lot more data and a lot less calls than you thought , you can move to an alternate plan that fits you better . 
  yatango is * especially * good for this , because of their build-your-own-plan system , but it 's easy as hell to move to amaysim , or to optus , or whoever you want , too , if their plans fit you best . 
  if you 're locked in to a 24 month contract and discover that said plan is a bad fit for you , too bad , you 're stuck for the next two years . 
  as for support , to me it feels like you 're grossly overestimating how important it really is . 
  i had my previous telco for 2 years , and contacted them a few times . 
  once when i was first signing up with them , because i had trouble getting the sim delivered . 
  once because i wanted to notify them and make sure they knew about a scam call i had received that specifically mentioned the fact that i was a customer of theirs . 
  and then again right before i switched away , because i wanted clarification about their end-of-lifeing the plan that i was on ( which was the reason i decided to switch away ) . 
  all of that was done over their * facebook * page . 
  i never even considered calling them because honestly there was no need . 
  i 've had my current telco for only about 6 months , but the only time i contacted them so far was to resolve issues getting my sim delivered . 
  did that through their online chat support . 
  it was quick and easy . 
  and the vast majority of people are going to be similar : you rarely need to contact customer support . 
  greater hours of customer support availability might be nice , but they 're definitely not worth an extra 33 % cost except * maybe * for enterprise deals . 
  i can see dropouts or lower priority traffic being a problem in theory , but it 's certainly never been a problem i 've experienced or heard substantial reports about , so i do n't think that 's something i would be weighing in when choosing a provider for myself or to recommend to others . 
  i dunno , but with it being posted near george boole 's birthday i say it should be given a pass . 
  why the bold on celsius ? 
  it makes almost no difference in that range between celsius and fahrenheit . 
  -30 c is -22 f , according to google . 
  ( and , for reference 's sake , -30 f is -34 c. ), 
  yeah , that definitely frightens me a little . 
  winter where i live is too cold for my liking , and it has lows that * maybe * , * maaaaybe * reach like 2 degrees celsius on an insanely cold day . 
  it depends . 
  * are you allowed to put the egg in protective padding and/or a parachute ? 
  * is the egg hardboiled or fresh ? 
  * are you dropping the egg onto concrete , soft dirt , or perhaps even a swimming pool ? 
  * hell , maybe it is n't even a chicken egg . 
  reptile eggs tend to be far softer than bird eggs , and amphibian or fish eggs are softer again . 
  aye , south east queensland , to be precise . 
  look , i understand where you 're coming from , and that 's definitely how the media has been portraying it . 
  but make no mistake , turnbull is still a liberal , and his policies are , for the most part , every bit as harmful as abbott 's were , with a few minor mostly cosmetic exceptions . 
  take a look at [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/3r52h5/knights_and_dames_to_be_scrapped_from_order_of/cwl4dzb ) above for a few examples .
