   so teaches you to copy and paste code and not read why it works . 
  i find myself particularly guilty of this at work where time is always slim . 
  is this how people use so ? 
  it 's definitely not how i use it . 
  i use it because i was n't to find a solution to a problem and i do n't know how to solve it , but how i proceed from there depends on the nature of my problem . 
  if it 's making use of a function i 'm already familiar with but just brainfarted on and forgot , so often jogs my memory and i go `` oh yeah , of course ! '', 
  and i 'll just use the code as-is . 
  but if it 's teaching me some new technique , i 'll definitely take the time to understand how it works , and read the documentation on any new functions etc. , because i want to know exactly what the function does and how it might be useful in the future . 
  because blindly copying and pasting code without knowing how it works sounds like an incredibly unhealthy practice . 
  the edges of the world are still a little smooth . 
  the original map was actually probably better in this respect than the new one . 
  often large landmasses will have small islands dotted all around them , just near the coast . 
  you could add a few of those . 
  smythe is a last name that exists , and is pronounced the same as smith . 
  so yes , it is necessary . 
  this is frustrating , because obviously you probably do n't want to give out your real name online , but i 'm really curious about what it is , to see if there 's some obvious potential ambiguity in its pronunciation . 
  because it totally makes sense that someone would have to ask about how to pronounce a name with same ambiguity to it . 
  i had a similar topic for my tok essay , and i leaned quite heavily on [ this article ] ( http://www.cracked.com/article_18823_5-insane-ways-words-can-control-your-mind.html ) ( and related sources ) for examples . 
  yeah seriously . 
  in that quote he acts as though he only killed a few dozen of the northern leaders . 
  but he did n't . 
  he had them ambush and kill the entire fucking army . 
  how is that in any way more noble than meeting them in battle . 
  i might have agreed with tywin if it had just been those inside the hall that died , but he orchestrated the slaughter of thousands . 
   but it was cool because no one ever forgot my birthday . 
  this is definitely true . 
  i can remember my birthday , that of my * immediate * family members ( parents and sibling ) , and people with special birthdays . 
  my best friend in high school 's birthday was on christmas , i had a friend in middle school whose birthday was new years . 
  i know 3 people with birthdays on anzac day , one of which was only a vague acquaintance . 
  and my neighbour growing up had a birthday on hallowe'en . 
  i ca n't remember the birthdays of my closest friends , but i remember the birthday of someone i have n't met for over 10 years , because it was on an easily memorable day . 
  i 'll be voting greens 1 , especially in the senate , and preference labor next . 
  ( referring only to the major parties , a few minor parties get dotted in ahead of the greens , between them and labor , between labor and lnp , and below lnp . ), 
  it 's been a long time since i did my tok stuff , so i honestly do n't remember that well what makes a good question . 
  but from my vague memory , it looks like a good one .

  ! page for vote on leave of absence, 
  yeah . 
  it also pages the person who moved the motion , which is probably unnecessary , and the speaker . 
  but it 's easy enough to ignore pages which do n't apply to you , and would be substantially harder to constantly edit the paging list ( which is at / r/modelaushr/wiki / current_members ) with whichever members are present . 
  though conceivably someone could keep on top of that .

  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  before i page other members , i want to make sure i 've got this right . 
  is the above the correct response to the pm 's motion ? 
  i thought motions need n't be seconded when moved by ministers ?

  the bot is already set up in a very modular way , so i can get it working for the senate very easily . 
  all you need to do is create a page on the wiki that consists of nothing but the name of senators , each on their own line ( remembering that reddit requires a blank line between paragraphs ) . 
  i might suggest / r/modelaussenate/wiki / current_senators . 
  ( you can go to / r/modelaushr/wiki / current_members and view the source to see how it needs to be set up , but it 's pretty straightforward . ), 
  then just let me know what the page is and i 'll get it to start listening in the senate , too . 
  ! page to debate the leave of absence for cyberpolis, 
  it 's amazing what one can get done when procrastinating * actual * assignments . 
  you 'll also need to add the bot to the approved contributors list ( which is [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaussenate/about/contributors/ ) ) . 
  otherwise it can only comment once every 10 minutes , which slows it down substantially . 
  i was referring to when i created the bot hehe . 
   just a small clarification . 
  i 've seen the official trailers . 
  i do n't mind seeing what the producers want me to see, 
  i 've been avoiding even that . 
  i know a little bit of the stuff because parts of it have been shared all over reddit and other social media , but i 've been avoiding whatever i can . 
  okay , it should work now . 
  you can summon it with [ exclamation mark ] page followed by a message . 
  the message can be surrounded with quotation marks if you want to put some extra text after the paging message , or you can just write the message out if the paging is the last thing in the comment . 
  you can put anything you like before the [ exclamation mark ] page bit . 
  the bot will then reply in the format `` paging [ user 1 ] , [ user 2 ] , and [ user 3 ] [ message ] '' . 
  the exact wording is that `` the ** initial ** damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st '' . 
  emphasis mine . 
  the use of the term `` initial '' makes it fairly clear that the ongoing damage is still 1d12 . 
  the way the spell is worded says that on a hit , the target takes 1d12 . 
  and then on subsequent turns you can automatically deal 1d12 .
