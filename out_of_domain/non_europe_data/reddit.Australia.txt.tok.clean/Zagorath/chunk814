  the number happens to be the same , but there 's no indication that changing one number necessarily results in a change of the other . 
  haha no worries . 
  it 's just star city now . 
  not only is it a weird question , it 's a ** bad ** question . 
  there are like half a dozen different shoe size systems , * at least * 3 of which could reasonably be used with the numbers in the range used on this survey . 
  and that 's not even taking into account that the numerical `` size '' differs between men and women with the same foot length ( in cm ) in some shoe size systems . 
  and there are also separate systems for children 's sizes . 
  the question gives no indication of which system should be used . 
  when in doubt , reading the player 's handbook is a good place to start . 
   you prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast , choosing from the paladin spell list . 
  when you do so , choose a number of paladin spells equal to your charisma modifier + half your paladin level , rounded down ( minimum of one spell ) . 
  it had `` non-hispanic white '' , which i think is what most people would just call `` white '' . 
  for some reason some americans include this option , i guess because apparently some people consider hispanics to be white ? 
  i dunno , it 's always seemed odd to me . 
  the survey also had an option for `` asian american '' . 
  so if you 're actually asian there 's no answer on here for you . 
  or if you 're a pacific islander . 
  for example , did you know the first recorded use of `` bling '' was in 1999 ? 
  or `` bromance '' in 2001 . 
  `` parkour '' in 2002 , `` flash mob '' in 2003 , or `` podcast '' in 2004 . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  voting will cease no later than 2130\u00a03/11 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' .

  ### i think the ayes have it .

  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for vote on leave of absence, 
  are we just ignoring the nexus line , here ? 
  agreed , more examples would be great . 
  but i think the idea is that they want to push people into subscribing . 
  there 's some text in there that implies people who pay for a subscription can get it to tell them a word down specifically to the month . 
  ( cat ), 
  yeah , to be honest most of the '90s got given really lame words compared to the ' 00s and the '80s . 
  muggle , hacktivism , and emoticon are the only words of interest imo . 
  this is important . 
  any good campaign setting should have a compelling elevator pitch to quickly sell it . 
  so it looks like we 've got a couple of fighting styles for close quarters , a new ranger archetype , a sorcerous origin ( shadow ) , and a new warlock patron ( the undying light ) . 
  i find it odd that they 're making new ranger archetypes whilst they 're in the midst of a bunch of massive upheavals for the ranger , but i guess they wanted something to appease fans of drizzt . 
  the sorcerer archetype seems to have learnt from the changes the storm sorcerer underwent during its change from the ua to the final release : this one does n't get an expanded spell list . 
  the warlock 's spell list looks unusually small . 
  the other patrons have tended to grant 2 spells per spell level . 
  but perhaps this is meant to have been balanced by the extra cantrips it gets as its level 1 feature .

  that question is not in order . 
  the member for western australia has an opportunity to rephrase the question such that it directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the prime minister . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  meta : sorry for the delayed response . 
  had to do some research , in the form of watching an unhealthy amount of question time ... 
  the latter half of that point of order is not in order , but i will respond in accordance with the former half . 
  mearls seems to be a big fan of the quirks , as well . 
  he tweeted the following on the 24th :, 
   warlock patrons are fun to design . 
  i ca n't create one without also adding an optional table of flaws to add to your character . 
   sample from a table of quirks i just wrote up for a subclass : `` you blinked . 
  once . 
  last week . '', 
  very true . 
  as a level 5 warlock myself , i 've only taken 2 out of the possible 6 spells my patron granted me so far , one level 2 , and one level 3 . 
   also , are any ranger players fans of drizz ` t. 
  i feel like they have more reason than most to hate him, 
  drizzt fans are almost certainly ranger fans , on account of drizzt being a ranger in previous editions . 
  the reverse is probably not true , though . 
  a lot of fans of the ranger class probably do n't like drizzt . 
  i would n't know , i honestly do n't know a think about the guy . 
  order . 
  the member for sydney will refrain from interjecting . 
  yup . 
  his 3 . x build was fighter 10 , barbarian 1 , ranger 5 . 
  in 1e and 2e he was all ranger ( 10 and 16 levels , respectively ) , and in 4e he was a skirmisher . 
  they 're the oed , so i 'm generally going to assume they probably know what they 're talking about . 
  in particular , i 'd suspect that if they claim they found a reference to it in year x , then i would suggest the earliest use of it was definitely in or before the year x. 
  ( it could be before because they may not have come across an earlier reference , even though it exists . 
  but i doubt it could be later , because if they 've found even one earlier reference , that 's what they 're going to go with . ), 
  basically nothing is al legal . 
  it 's stupidly restrictive . 
  even the officially finalised and released stuff ( like in the sword coast adventurer 's guide or elemental evil player 's companion ) is n't necessarily legal . 
  so no , ua stuff definitely is not legal . 
  yeah the name issue is a really annoying one . 
  at first glance i was confused and thought they had released the undying warlock , or a modified version of it , in ua , despite it only recently being released in finalised form in the scag . 
  they 're called [ dual-flush toilets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual_flush_toilet ) , and they were first theoretically proposed by an american , but the first practical working design was australian . 
  unsurprisingly , they 're totally ubiquitous in australia and new zealand , as well as a few other countries ( the article specifically mentions singapore and israel , but i can also add vietnam into that from my experience ) . 
  somewhat more surprising to me is that apparently they * are n't * ubiquitous in america . 
  the thing that really disturbs me about american culture is that even the most liberal left-wing people seem to be * insanely * pro-gun . 
  like , most american left-wingers would be the absolute far , * extreme * right in australia when it comes it gun control . 
  they just have zero capacity to use common sense on the issue , let alone look at the examples set by other countries . 
  i think i get it . 
  the idea is that there should be no relation between shoe size and thoughts on police , so if you measure shoe size , and find that there * is * a correlation , then there 's some sort of problem with the results ( perhaps it 's not a representative sample , or something else ) . 
  does that sound about right ? 
  as a side note , if that * is * what 's going on here , it may not be a fair assessment . 
  people with larger feet are likely to be physically larger . 
  that might ( it would require an additional study to determine , though i imagine some level of related study already exists in an area related to this ) mean that they look more physically intimidating , and thus their previous encounters with police might have been more negative than smaller , less intimidating people with smaller feet .
