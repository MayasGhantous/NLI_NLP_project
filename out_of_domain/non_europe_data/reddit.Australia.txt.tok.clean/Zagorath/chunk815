  that , in turn , could lead to stronger negative feelings about police in general . 
  or there could be some entirely different but perfectly acceptable reason for a correlation between shoe size and attitude towards police . 
  on a different note , have you got a response to the criticism regarding the wording of the question ? 
  you just said `` shoe size '' , and did n't mention * which measuring system * you were referring to . 
  it could easily be us , uk , australian , or even mexican sizes . 
  that 's * bad survey design * , as surely as if you had put only `` male '' and `` female '' for gender ( which is actually a * rule * in this subreddit ) . 
  similarly , it is bad survey design that there is * no * valid option for asians ( unless they happen to be americans with asian heritage ) or pacific islanders , and the option for white people is not obvious ( you really should just put `` white '' or `` caucasian '' , rather than `` non-hispanic white '' -- if the `` non-hispanic '' part is essential to you , perhaps it should go in brackets * after * the main entry ) . 
  and the final point is of course that there 's no mention of location . 
  perhaps it does n't matter to you for this survey , but it seems * highly * unlikely that it would not be relevant that people in the us have a stronger negative opinion of police than australians , who are more negative than the uk ( hypothetically ) . 
  and even if that 's the case , you should make it clear in the survey that the respondent should answer with regards to * their local police force * . 
  $ cat food, 
  cat : food : no such file or directory, 
  well that 's way less fun . 
  edit : also :, 
  $ touch food, 
  $ chmod 000 food, 
  $ cat food, 
  cat : food : permission denied, 
  so even if you make it so that ` food ` does exist , but you 're not allowed to open it , it still is n't fun . 
  i just wish skype would use markdown rather than whatever the hell it has going on for its markup language . 
  same with google + and youtube . 
  * why is one asterisk bold , google , * *** why ***, 
   it 's a random hodgepodge of icons scattered everywhere and he never clears his notifications, 
  this might amuse you . 
  you know how google chrome on android has that little number in the square indicating how many open tabs you have ? 
  did you know that this number has a maximum limit , and if you go beyond that it just gives a little icon that basically says `` whoa , you 've got too many '' . 
  '' :d '' , it says . 
  i did n't either , until i had a look at my dad 's phone last year . 
  turns out , he did n't know tabs were a thing , and every time he opened a link from facebook , or from a search ( presumably in the search app , but i 'm not sure ) , it opened a new one . 
  and he * never * closed any of them . 
  so he ended up with well over 100 of the damn things , and had no idea . 
  reddit is , i 'm sure you 'll agree , an insanely left-wing site , en masse . 
  but on the issue of gun control , the anti-gun control side is by far the most popular : their comments get upvoted the most in general . 
  to me , that says that , while i have no doubt there are some who go too far in the other direction , and some who are in a sensible middle point , the overwhelming tendency in america just * has * to be one of being pro-gun . 
  if a sample from one of the most left-wing and urban sites on the internet is pro gun , then surely the overall population must be even more so . 
  for what it 's worth , though , i 've very rarely seen that sensible middle ground in america . 
  most americans do n't even seem to know that it exists . 
  they think australia 's laws are just `` all guns are banned forever '' . 
  and the pro-gun people point to this and say `` we must never move to be anything like australia '' , and the anti-gun people point to it and say `` yes , this clearly is the right idea '' . 
  but the fact is australia 's laws are n't nearly as horrible as all that . 
  it 's actually rather easy to get a gun if you want one . 
  you just need a good reason to own one , and among those reasons are hunting , sport shooting , or vermin control ( for farmers et al. ) . 
  and if you own a gun , there are laws about how you store it when not in use . 
  this prevents accidental injury and theft from being as much of a problem as they are in the us . 
  australian gun laws are actually really fucking good . 
  it 's just that when americans talk about them , they talk about a total straw man , not the real state of the law . 
  one of the biggest sticking points is that americans love their guns for self defense . 
  that is * not * a valid reason to own a gun in australia . 
  it 's just a scary part of american culture that they really need to get past if they want to progress . 
   a long-rest refresh , something warlocks do n't typically have until they reach their level 14, 
  unless you include invocations , some of which allow you to cast certain spells once per long rest , and one of which can be done with no level restriction ( and thus can be done from level 2 ) . 
  radiant damage is objectively one of the more rare damage types in the game . 
  in the dmg when building aasimar , wotc noted that because it 's rare , it would be unfair to substitute the tiefling 's fire resistance for radiant resistance in an aasimar , since the latter is far too rare . 
  so they added necrotic resistance as well . 
  by the very nature of tabletop rpgs , in some campaigns with some dms , any broad statement like this will be broken . 
  in some campaigns , int saves might not be rare . 
  but from an objective look at the rule system , the abilities that exist , and the monsters that are expected to be commonplace , such things are far less likely . 
  5 of them do seem to be pretty much the same thing . 
  but point # 4 is different to the others . 
  it 's in the sword coast adventurer 's guide , which officially comes out today , but some special stores got it early . 
  from what i 've gathered , it 's the same as the one in the ua , but it * does n't * get the extra spells . 
  mearls recently tweeted the following on the matter :, 
   quick note about the storm sorcerer in the sword coast adventurers guide - bonus spells were removed based on playtest feedback . 
   which might sound weird , because people really liked that sorcerer and the bonus spells . 
  however , implementing feedback is never that simple, 
   the original sorcerer is rated very well without bonus spells . 
  having sorcerous origins with them would make phb ones look weaker . 
   the class did n't need the buff , and while people like the idea of the bonus spells , they do n't fit with the game 's overall structure . 
   you can expect that kind of revision as ua material enters the environment - we sometimes try stuff in ua to get a sense of future paths . 
  the word hallowe'en is a contracting of `` all hallows ' evening '' . 
  in some parts of the world the apostrophe was dropped . 
  sort of like hawai'i , which some people spell without the apostrophe ( though in that case , i believe it represents a glottal stop , and not a contraction ) . 
  oh god those damn cookie warnings are so frustrating . 
  why is it that time and time again the eu ( and many individual countries within it ) has to do stupid shit that shows they have zero understanding of the basics of technology , and yet they have this overwhelming desire to just fuck with shit anyway . 
  they 're so damn * naughty * . 
  from the uk 's porn filters , to germany with google streetview . 
  from the bullshit `` right to be forgotten '' nonsense , to this law requiring websites to spam their users with annoying notices . 
  and yes , those of us outside the eu definitely see them : i 'm getting them here in australia . 
  \\* * twitch * \\*, 
  huh , til . 
  very cool .

  australia and new zealand army corps day . 
  25th april . 
  it 's very similar to remembrance day , though we observe that as well . 
  it commemorates aussie and kiwi diggers ( a slang term for members of the military , particularly those from the first world war ) who died . 
  the date is the one on which anzac forces landed at gallipoli , in turkey , during wwi . 
  the gallipoli campaign saw huge casualties on the anzac side , with them being used by the british as essentially a diversion . 
  no , australian . 
  the government has a surprisingly good player [ here ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/news_and_events/watch_parliament ) , and there 's a youtube channel which seems to be official [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucxkwgsgswncdnutjcxpoq7w ) . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease no later than 1530\u00a004/11 / 2015 , utc +10 .
