  ### i think the ayes have it . 
  the motion passes . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for vote on joint select committee, 
  dude , the great thing about changing your hair colour is that it 's totally easy to reverse . 
  it 's not like tattoos where it 's permanent , so you need to really fucking consider if it 's a good idea before doing it . 
  if you wan na do it , then go for it . 
  if after a few days you decide you do n't like it , change it back . 
  meta : i do n't know how you can claim an inconsistent ruling when there has * been * no ruling in the past . 
  nobody else has ever raised a point of order on the matter . 
  meta : oh my god , you terrified me for a second there . 
  i had been tweaking the bot to make it deal with errors on reddit 's side , and in doing that i broke it so that it was sending out heaps of pages when it should n't be . 
  i just thought i had the problems solved , and that there should n't be any more erroneous pages , when i got the notification that it had decided to start paging things again . 
  so i was relieved to see that it was actually a legit use this time !, 
  if you disagree with my ruling , that 's fine , i have no problem with that . 
  my only issue is that you claim `` inconsistency '' on a matter which has * zero * precedence not just from me , but from the model parliament in general . 
  something ca n't be inconsistent if it is the first time the situation has arisen . 
  there is certainly a decent argument to be made that the question was not out of order ( i came across examples of similar questions that the speaker ruled in either direction ) , but it is certainly not from an argument of inconsistency . 
  it should be every 30 seconds . 
  this latest page may have taken longer because i was fiddling with it , taking the bot down , etc. 
  it 's definitely not the most memorable of initialisms . 
  the superman in this is * not * the same as the superman in the movies . 
  the syntax for spoilers in this subreddit is ` [ spoiler ] ( #s `` your message here . 
  what you posted just shows up as the word `` spoiler '' , and users need to hover over it and read the title text in order to read the message . 
  at least this time their mentions of him have been far more natural . 
  they feel comfortable using `` superman '' where it makes sense , and using other terms ( like `` him '' , `` my/your cousin '' , etc. ), 
  when they are more natural fits . 
   although , cargo is n't kept in the front of boats lol . 
  there is absolutely zero chance of oil leaking into the water by breaking the front 5 metres off an oil tanker, 
  haha i 'm glad to see someone say this . 
  that said , i 'm really glad that the boat * did * break apart . 
  i like that they 're using some semblance of real physics , with supergirl putting dents into things , and even breaking them apart unintentionally . 
  my mind definitely goes to routh or reeve . 
  or perhaps the young justice or justice league cartoon supermans . 
  those ones seem to fit more with the superman in this universe . 
  anything but the man of steel superman . 
  that was just awful . 
  yeah seriously . 
  plus , that joke at the opening felt to me like they were deliberately poking fun at themselves from the pilot , which they must know got a lot of criticism for that kind of thing . 
  the score is absolutely fantastic . 
  it 's early days , but i 'm already picking out certain themes that go with different aspects of the show , and that 's the number one thing i look for in a good film or television soundtrack . 
  at the very least , we 've got the supergirl heroic theme , the krypton theme , and some sort of generic villainous theme . 
  and the show has been using these in really clever and subtle ways , briefly touching upon one theme here and there to subtly emphasise what 's going on on screen . 
  really brilliant . 
  man hunter as in j'onn j'onzz ? 
  yeah , i wish they had used something that has actually been hypothesised to be possible , like silicon . 
  it 's not like they used any particular property specific to chlorine elsewhere in the plot that made it necessary . 
  seriously . 
  she hired a pulitzer winning photojournalist , and then a week later decides she 's going to fire him if he ca n't get her one specific interview ? 
  what the fuck is up with that ? 
  yeah , i really did n't like the performance by young kara 's actor in the pilot , so i was hoping they 'd stay away from it . 
  but i was pleasantly surprised at how she did on today 's episode . 
  i think you need to take a moment to think about that again for a second . 
  reminded me of the scene in avatar where iroh secretly heated his tea . 
   kryptonian kids are expected to go to sleep before their sun sets ? 
  harsh . 
  we do n't know what latitude they were at . 
  this time of year , in melbourne , the sun does n't set until almost 8:00 pm , and melbourne is n't even * that * far south of the equator , and we 're only two thirds of the way through * spring * , it 's not even summer yet . 
  in the middle of summer , at really extreme latitudes , the sun can set * very * late . 
  no i know what you meant . 
  but it does n't make sense . 
  she can * fly * , and she does n't need a place to plant her feet to do that . 
  if she needed to plant her feet to get leverage on something , she would have the same problem with pulling as with pushing . 
  the exact quote , if anyone is interested but does n't want to look it up , is :,

  etymonline says :, 
   as a greeting , 1859 , but the word is attested as a sailor 's or huntsman 's utterance since early 15c . 
  modern popularity dates from world war ii ( when , it is said , it was a common response at roll calls ) and seems to have been most intense in philadelphia . 
  which does n't seem especially helpful , to me .

   the a clarinet just sounded attractive because it does n't require transposing when playing with other instruments, 
  that is n't accurate , and i 'm not really sure where you got that idea from . 
  c is the key most instruments are in . 
  all string instruments ( including piano and guitar ) are in c. flutes , oboes , and bassoons are in c. 
  the clarinet shares bb with modern trumpets , as well as tenor and soprano saxophones . 
  i ca n't think of any other instruments in c , apart from perhaps some trumpet and horn stuff from the classical and baroque era , and maybe the early romantic . 
  bb is way easier to transpose on the fly than a , in my opinion , though perhaps that 's just because i 'm more experienced with it . 
  you just shift the notes up by 1 and sharpen the key signature by two keys . 
  and on an a clarinet you read a `` c '' and play a concert `` a '' ( hence the name ) . 
  it 's an even worse transposition than bb . 
  now we just need to get rid of 5c , too . 
  i 'm pretty sure the kiwis are ahead of us on that ... 
  the member for the northern territory is relevant ; there is no point of order . 
  and even more in / r/dndnext, 
  it depends on which edition . 
  pathfinder and d&d 3.5 are very similar . 
  d&d 5th edition is a vast improvement over both of these . 
  it streamlines the game substantially , making things play much more quickly , and your character choices matter more , rather than having a lot of decisions that have little significance , or where the difference between two options is very small . 
  it 's also far more well balanced mechanically . 
  the longest bridge in the world is over 100 km long . 
  the longest over water is over 38 km . 
  the shortest point of the british channel is about 33 km . 
  it could definitely be done if they wanted to . 
  it would be utterly cost inefficient compared to the channel tunnel , i 'm sure , but it * could * be done . 
  the analytics are just a curve that shows how many people were watching at each point in the video , in aggregate .
