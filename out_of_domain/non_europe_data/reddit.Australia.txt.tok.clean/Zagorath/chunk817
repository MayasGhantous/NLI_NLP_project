  if a lot of people watch just the last 30 seconds of the video , that section will be substantially higher than anywhere earlier . 
  same if there 's a point somewhere in the middle that a lot of people skip to , or rewatch multiple times . 
  a separate option takes that curve , and normalises it to compare the number of people watching it at that point in the video compared to other videos of the same length ( because on average , less people are watching later in a video than at the start ) . 
  a perfectly average video would have a flat line on this second curve , and some sort of downward gradient in the first curve . 
  if a lot of people did the same thing as you , and happened to land on the same points , then it would show significant upticks in those areas on both curves . 
  i feel like this is more aweducational than awwducational . 
  not that there 's a problem with that , necessarily . 
  goliath was n't a ua race , it was in the elemental evil player 's companion . 
  what 's weird is that aarakocra and genasi were n't given as options , since they are also from ee . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to .

  ### i think we have a tie . 
  i have made no secret of the fact that i wish this house could maintain a higher level of debate than of real life parliament , and that i would prefer the conversation be restricted to that of debating policy , and not of internal party political matters . 
  and it goes without saying that i think concerns about media polls over who should hold what particular position should go unheeded in this house . 
  however , long standing convention is that the speaker should remain neutral in casting deciding votes , and should attempt to vote in accordance to whichever side will effect further discussion . 
  as such , i will be placing my casting vote with the ayes . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for vote on dissent motion, 
  this was the most terrified i 've been in this subreddit . 
  also : i love how he just leaves afterwards . 
  it 's like `` see ya , bitches , i 'm outta here ! '', 
   tahiti : mcu confirmed, 
  huh ? 
  atlantis was mentioned on earth 2 . 
  and jay said he had a good friend from there . 
  so , no different to the normal aquaman . 
  i 've seen a lot of people mention that . 
  is it a reference to something , or just funny because he got the name wrong ? 
   harry the dick, 
  played by [ tom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tom,_dick_and_harry ) . 
  posting it here really is n't going to do much . 
  you need to go and submit it on their feedback site . 
  yeah , that 's a really fucking serious breach of 1st amendment rights ... 
   they give all that shit to the nsa, 
  lol what . 
  no they do n't . 
  for a time the nsa was secretly tapping the unencrypted communications between their datacentres , but that was n't with google 's consent , and since the revelations have come out they 've stopped sending that stuff insecurely . 
  google 's value is that people trust them . 
  if they betray that trust -- if they deliberately provide false information , or give out personally identifiable and/or sensitive information to third parties -- people will no longer be as comfortable using them as they are today . 
  they have very little to gain from doing so , and * everything * to lose . 
  why would they risk it ? 
  as for google becoming a source of fact , well that 's a problem with people not being skeptical enough . 
  in general , top results on google are going to be accurate , but their applicability to how you think that information should be used is something that you need to always question , and it 's tricky for google to work that out for you . 
  yeah , now they 've changed it to `` do the right thing . '', 
  hardly much difference , really . 
  it 's at the top of the op , that 's why i pointed you here before . 
  i was under the impression that the witcher games were only very loosely based on the books . 
  i ca n't comment on what is or is n't the norm , but my table has a general `` everything is allowed '' policy , but we 've never seen aarakocra at our table , and since switching to 5e we 've never used genasi or goliaths . 
  i 'm glad to see , at least right now , my preferred option is the plurality . 
   i think these or similar future subclasses should be open to all by default , with an option for dms to restrict them, 
  there 's definitely good setting flavour to be had with restrictions , but by default i think everything should be allowed . 
  and even when your setting has that restriction , rare exceptions should be able to exist . 
  for example , a human who has managed to greatly endear himself to an elven leader might be allowed to learn something that would otherwise be restricted to elves . 
  there are also certain times that piercing is more useful , for example with rakshasas . 
  slashing is certainly more useful far more often , though . 
  the vast majority of the time piercing , slashing , and bludgeoning resistance/immunity go together . 
  there are rare exceptions , however , for example rakshasas are vulnerable to * piercing * from magic weapons wielded by good creatures . 
  so the games do n't follow the plot of the books , but they take place following on from them ? 
  very interesting . 
   possibly short rest being a day , long rest being a week, 
  that 's not so much a house rule as a variant official rule from the dmg . 
  [ here 's a link to a pdf ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0byjhrwzi6znomjznbvdqt0pdznm/view?usp=sharing ) . 
  i 'm a bit unsure about some of the language used to describe it . 
  i 'd especially like suggestions for better titles for the `` physical qualities '' and `` attitudes and beliefs '' sections , because they do n't fit at all with the 5e style , but i could n't think of clever names for them . 
  this is a 5e conversion of a race from the 4e book `` heroes of shadow '' . 
  vrylokas are humans that underwent some sort of ritual to gain greater lifespan , and they are essentially living vampires . 
  i built this race with / u/the _ singular_anyone 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3qnv6q/vampire _ prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big / ) in mind . 
  in particular the small blood point pool is meant to merge with that class 's pool . 
  the quote is from serana in skyrim 's dawnguard expansion , because i kinda view the vryloka as similar to the vampire lords in skyrim , as compared to the `` baser '' vampires . 
  they 're not exactly the same thing , but i view them as thematically similar . 
  i estimate this race as about a +6 in [ this race balance guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  since 2006/7 when they started using intel processors , to be precise . 
   perhaps the temp hit points could use con mod instead of just +1, 
  hmm , maybe . 
  i set it to what i did mainly because i was worried about it being overpowered , and i was mainly going for flavour . 
  but if you think it might be better balanced to change it to 1d4 + con , perhaps i could make the change . 
   when you say `` if you are suffering from the negative effects of blood dependency ... you regain the full hitpoint bonus from this ability '' , does this mean you regain 1d4 +1 hp , 5 hp , or some other value . 
  thanks for noting the ambiguity , i did n't think of that . 
  can you think of a better way of wording it ? 
  my main intention was to note that the health bonus * is n't * halved . 
   instead of using blood points , perhaps just say , if you go two days in a row without feeding on blood , healing is only half as effective on you, 
  i had it worded like that in my original draft , but decided to alter it to synergise with the vampire prestige class made by the_singular_anyone . 
   you could be a little more concise with your words, 
  in the more general sense , definitely . 
  i 've always had the problem of being somewhat over-verbose . 
  i 'll take another look over the traits section and see how i can slim it down . 
  are there any other specific bits that you think could be improved ? 
  regarding the presentation , yeah , i know it 's pretty damn awful . 
  i actually did n't do it in photoshop , except for some alterations to the images . 
  for the most part , it 's done in word . 
  dealing with text in photoshop is a massive pain , and i do n't think it can produce a multi-page pdf with selectable text . 
  it 's basically a background image that 's the same on each page , and then the four other images are placed on top of that , with different word wrapping in order to both look aesthetically pleasing and to fit all the text in ( i did n't want to spill onto a fourth page ) . 
  in my opinion , the absolute worst bit is the image on the first page , which definitely could use some improvement with how it blends . 
  the image at the bottom of page 2 could use the same , perhaps to a lesser extent . 
  i actually kinda liked the way i had inserted the sigil on the second page , and the image on the third , but i get what you 're saying about it not being consistent with the phb .
