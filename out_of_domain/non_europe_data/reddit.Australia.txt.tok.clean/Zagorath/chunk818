  what do you think about [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d2lobj0.png ) for the third page , and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rmoodsp.png ) ( but with a more blended/jagged edge ) for the second ? 
  for the other two images , i 'll try the tips in that photoshop guide . 
  from the looks of it the guide does n't use photoshop 's blending modes , and instead relies solely on transparency , so i * think * that should be doable within the model i 've used . 
   this is literally the first result when you google picka, 
  sounds like you must be someone who uses urban dictionary a lot . 
  because i rarely go there , and google has n't put a link to it in my search for `` picka '' anywhere on the first page . 
  [ here are my top few results on a search for `` picka '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rx3kwhd.png ) . 
  two things . 
  * guaranteed fail on attack rolls . 
  even if the ac is low enough that 1 + stat + proficiency is greater than it , a 1 still misses . 
  * it counts as 2 failed saves when making death saving throws . 
  sometimes i post an identical comment on two threads about the same topic in different subreddits . 
  similar to how people x-post links between multiple subreddits that would all be interested in the link , sometimes the same comment ( especially top-level ones ) is useful in multiple different threads . 
  i would suggest that , at the * very * least , if such a bot were to be enabled , it would have to require unique comments on a per-subreddit basis , not a site-wide one . 
  while playing russian music , i presume ? 
   we used english english in new zealand , for what it 's worth . 
  i think `` colour '' more closely matches the way it is pronounced by us anyway . 
  i 'm not a kiwi , so i may be wrong , but i doubt this . 
  over in australia , we use a form of english that is far closer to british english than american , but we have our own twists as well . 
  the first that comes to mind is that thongs are a type of footwear ( i believe you guys use `` jandals '' ? 
  ) , our `` lolly '' is synonymous with their `` sweet '' , and we use `` chip '' to refer to * both * what the british call crisps and what the americans call fries . 
  i 'm sure if you think hard enough you 'll be able to find a lot of unique usage and phrases from new zealand english and/or places where it borrows more from australian or american english than from british . 
  i feel like a slightly more apt analogy would be to day its like saying nee york is in canada . 
  at least that 's on the right continent . 
  you really do n't need to be a sql expert to use sql . 
  sure , there 's a lot of really advanced stuff that can be done with it , particularly with nested select queries on complicated databases , but making very simple select x where y queries is super easy , as are commands for inserting , removing , and updating . 
  plus , with mysql and phpmyadmin , a lot of that stuff can be done through a gui , if you would prefer .

  incompetech is fucking amazing . 
  every amateur filmmaker , youtuber , game designer , absolutely * anyone * who finds a need to use music in something they 're going to be sharing with others should know about it . 
  he uses a creative commons attribution ( cc-by ) licence . 
  that means you can edit the music however you want , use it in anything you want , and even make money off of the resulting product , so long as you provide credit . 
   never had a video taken down though, 
  i 'll bet you like 90 % chance the video was taken down in germany . 
  but yeah , the great thing about the content id system is that it means people can often use music they have no legal right to use , and their videos can stay up for others to watch . 
  and the owners of the music simply get the ability to monetise off of it , if they want . 
  the number one source for cc music for filmmakers etc. 
  would have to be [ incompetech ] ( http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/ ) . 
   say cnn uses the music in a video , then the cnn video gets fingerprinted, 
  you 're right that this and similar things have occurred in the past . 
  but if the music you 're using is music you * do * have the right to use , because it 's creative commons or otherwise , going through youtube 's dispute system will get you the right result . 
  it may take far longer than it has any right to \\* , but i 've never heard of someone who pursued it to the fullest * not * coming out of it with the correct result . 
  telling everyone that the only music they use is their own is stupid . 
  most video makers are n't musicians , and ca n't come up with their own . 
  but music is such an important part of video making , you ca n't expect them to just not use any . 
  and , for what it 's worth , i 've had problems even when the music * was * my own . 
  i 've posted recordings of myself playing classical , public domain , music ( beethoven , chopin , and the like ) , and * still * had copyright claims on it . 
  \\* using `` right '' here not in the legal sense , but just to say that there 's no good reason they should be given 30 * days * to respond, 
  yeah i 'm aware . 
  that 's why i brought up `` thongs '' as something that we use differently to british or us english . 
  i ca n't even make out the * notes * , the image is too low quality . 
   john did n't comment on ollie 's body, 
  how so ? 
  i wan na know why zatanna and harley seem to be on the same side there . 
  also , while i 'm on the topic , how does constantine 's magic ( and dahrk 's , for that matter ) work ? 
  as far as i can gather , constantine seemed to be speaking in some sort of made up language resembling latin . 
  not like zatanna 's backwards speak . 
  i thought it was nice that they * tried * to give some explanation for why he needs a campaign , but it did n't entirely convince me . 
  he 's not running in a parliamentary system where that kind of thing might matter . 
  it 's a us-style system with a direct election . 
  they ca n't do that now . 
  the dccu has someone cast as the flash , while the arrowverse has gustin . 
  since constantine is now a part of the arrowverse , an appearance by this constantine in the dccu would mess things up . 
  how does one improvise having a dead peacock feather ? 
  and if it 's the using the feather to scratch himself that was improvised , it makes me wonder what they had originally intended the feather to be for . 
  yeah cheers . 
  i found some other people link the tweet lower down in the thread . 
  i can only assume that comment was generated by randomly mashing keys with autocorrect turned on . 
  a sorcerer 's ( or warlock 's ) primary casting stat is cha . 
  i agree with you completely . 
  for me , story and flavour take precedence over balance and mechanics * every * time . 
  however , i do think it 's important to note that not * every * discussion about mechanics and balance is necessarily of the nature you describe . 
  yes , i 'm more than willing to play an underpowered race or class because i like the flavour . 
  but that does n't mean i would n't prefer it if i could get the same flavour from a more well-balanced mechanical class . 
  as such , many of us have a vested interest in seeing that everything is well balanced , and so we 'll discuss these things whenever new content comes out , or if we notice an interesting way abilities can synergise . 
  i definitely have seen people who worry about not playing something because of its power , like you describe . 
  but it 's important not to conflate the two types of discussions about balance . 
  i 'm not saying that * you * are conflating them , but i definitely have seen some people do so before , so i thought it was worth mentioning . 
  yeah , i could have attempted to preserve the status quo . 
  my main concern here though was that doing so might appear overly biased in favour of defending myself , which is not something i wanted to do . 
  and besides , part of denison 's rule is that casting votes should go in favour of further debate ; aiming to preserve the status quo is the action that should be taken where further debate is not possible . 
  further , i felt confident in upholding the motion of dissent knowing that [ there is precedence that a successful motion of dissent has been carried and the speaker has not resigned ] ( http://www.anzacatt.org.au/parliament/general/anzacatt/anzacatt.nsf/0/4bebe535f82a275aca256d56007f4d07 ) , and that such a motion [ is not necessarily to be interpreted as a censure of the speaker ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/house_of_representatives/powers_practice_and_procedure/practice6/practice6html?file=chapter6&amp;section=08&amp;fullscreen=1 ) . 
  hmm ... that 's a good point . 
  maybe mexico would have been a better example , then ? 
  so , just like real life ? 
  the honourable the prime minister will retract his imputations of improper motives . 
  order . 
  the member for western australia and the member for sydney will refrain from interjecting and return to their seats . 
  ( ping / u/this _ guy22 . ), 
  i note that the hon. 
  neil andrew certainly agrees that avoiding casting a vote would have been unbiased , but honestly i do n't see it that way . 
  in effect , a lack of vote would have , in this case , been the same as a `` no '' vote , so i do n't see why it really matters whether i technically cast a vote in that direction or not . 
  but i 'm curious , which were the other two occasions this week when i acted on the urging of the pm ?
