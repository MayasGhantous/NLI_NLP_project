  as far as i can tell , the only thing i 've done that has n't been entirely routine was the trigger for this dissent motion ( and my mistake w.r.t. 
  seeking leave to grant leave for the member for south australia ) . 
   the harry potter books are fiction too, 
  i refuse to believe you !, 
   to convince adults that reading children 's books was cool, 
  not to mention convincing children that * reading * books was cool . 
  i got some led lights for my place for either screw or bayonet sockets ( i do n't remember which now ) . 
  were n't hard to find at all , they were on the shelf at woollies . 
  i do n't know what they guy is talking about regarding screw and bayonet being hard to find . 
  i found them super easy at just a woollies . 
  most of the last paragraph . 
  unfortunately , ip is the thing that is most worrying about this , or at least it was from leaks . 
  mate , it 's javascript . 
  it avoids throwing errors whenever it can , even in favour of nonsensical results . 
  in this case , it does indeed result in ` your_drink ` being replaced with ` undefined ` . 
  yeah , that 's how i would have been were it not for my desire to comment in this meta chain . 
  sure , the op was js , and the above joke was java . 
  but this joke works better using java , on account of the `` coffee shop '' aspect . 
  after the most recent security concern in flash , i decided to turn off plugins in my browser by default . 
  honestly , the lack of flash is very rarely an issue except on a couple of video sites ( and since most of my video watching is on youtube , which uses html5 anyway , it 's not too much of a problem ) . 
  the fact that i have to right-click and permit it to view pdfs is more of an issue . 
  but in general , honestly i 'd highly recommend it . 
  disabling plugins increases your security , lowers the amount of processing you need to do , and cleans up the experience on trashy sites . 
  no , we call them `` grubs '' . 
  if you 're interested , personally i find the best way to remember whether to use `` who '' or `` whom '' , is that if it could be replaced with `` he '' , it 's `` who '' , or if it is `` him '' , it 's `` whom '' . 
  the word ending with m matches with the other word ending in m. 
  but honestly , the best advice is that these days , nobody really cares . 
  if you use `` who '' when `` whom '' is more technically correct , nobody is going to give two shits about it . 
  doing the opposite will make people think you 're a bit pompous , but even then it 's not going to matter too much . 
  i dunno , daddy long legs are certainly great , but if i had a funnel web in my house i 'd be nuking the place from orbit . 
  yeah , salties up in the top end get * really * big . 
  they 're not mammals , though , so the guy 's comment is still correct . 
  but that 's what 's so brilliant about it , you absolutely still can . 
  you just [ right click ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5np5swv.png ) and hit [ run this plugin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tlmtxiw.png ) , and you 're golden . 
  you can still use flash whenever you want or need to , but it wo n't run by default . 
  i think there might even be a way of whitelisting specific sites , but i 've never looked into that . 
  a sort of placebo/nocebo effect , as it were . 
  hate leads to suffering !, 
  turn back from the dark side , op !, 
  quadratically , actually . 
  exponentially would be if it were m ^ v ( that 's m \\ ^ v , for anyone using a mobile app that does n't support superscript ) . 
  exponentially is a much faster increase than quadratic , and quadratic is already significantly faster than linear . 
  a logarithmic scale on a graph is when the numbers on the axis increase exponentially , so that might be what you were confused by . 
  but if something increases logarithmically , that means it uses the logarithmic function . 
  e.g. , if it were 1/2mlog ( v ) . 
  quadratic ( as in `` quadratic equations '' , which you may remember from ~ year 6 maths ) means the highest power is 2 . 
  similarly , cubic means the highest power is 3 . 
   often ask questions on so, 
  people actually * ask * questions on so ? 
  and there i was thinking that stack overflow just * was * ; like this omnipotent * presence * . 
   among the ingredients that constantine needed for the restoration, 
  i thought that ( part of ) the joke was that he * did n't * need the peacock feather for the ritual . 
  he asked for it just because he wanted to have it to scratch himself . 
  i 'm guessing you never watched chuck ? 
  my favourite example of argument over what `` balance '' is , is to point at star wars . 
  bring balance to the force , anakin did . 
  balance , in this case , apparently means `` remove the dark side '' . 
  on the other hand , the darths & droids webcomic ( which retells star wars as if it were a d&d campaign ) refers to bringing `` balance '' as bringing a more or less equal amount of both light and dark sides , and so for the jedi , bringing balance is an undesirable thing . 
  the written joke above specifically says coffee shop . 
  for it , java makes the most sense . 
  the picture which is the op could very well be a bar . 
  they apparently controlled for ses and a number of other factors , though i do n't think number of siblings was one of those . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease no later than 1400\u00a007/11 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  ## votes, 
  ** ayes ** : 6, 
  ** noes ** : 0, 
  ### i think the ayes have it . 
  the motion passes . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for vote on motion of confidence, 
  i think the problem is that you 're not comparing based on socioeconomic status , you 're comparing education levels . 
  certainly there is a correlation between the two , but the strength of that correlation will be substantially different in different countries/cultures . 
  if you 're using the mother 's education level as a proxy for socioeconomic status , then in america that might work okay , but in saudi arabia a woman from a high socioeconomic status might not have the education to match . 
  you mean david feeney ? 
  in this case , it 's not so much about disagreeing with who should be the prime minister , so much as the fact that we 've had 5 prime ministers in 5 years . 
  if one was n't keeping close track of things , it could be easy to forget . 
   it was n't just a trick question . 
  haha now i 'm imagining them asking the question of a patient who 's been out for a day or so , and the pm changed during that time . 
  and then them marking the patient as failed when they ca n't answer . 
  if they asked me i could n't answer it because i have no idea how to pronounce palaszczuk even when i have it written in front of me , let alone from memory . 
  as far as i 'm aware , the interrobang is the only such punctuation mark to exist in unicode , and thus be usable in average text . 
  unfortunately , it is n't made easy to type . 
  you wo n't find it on any standard keyboard layout , or even on most mobile keyboards that show extra options on long press . 
  personally , i 've set up textexpander to make it easy for me to type . 
  when i type '' * !? 
  '' , it automatically gets converted to '' '' . 
  huh ? 
  it 's been released , and there has been no vote . 
  they ca n't go back in time and make the vote happen before it was released . 
  if you indeed promised savanna an apology if it was released before a vote , well then you now owe that apology . 
  the `` under siege '' description often stays for a little while after someone has stopped besieging it . 
  i think it 's in case they come back , or something . 
  we did n't get much of him , but what we did get of j'onn in young justice was pretty good . 
  his niece , m'gann m'orzz , is one of the main characters of the show . 
  do n't worry , i made the same inference , and probably would have replied with a similar comment to yours had you not done it first . 
  i dunno , i agree with you about the rest of the comment , but `` doff '' could simply point to `` i recently read the dungeons & dragons 5th edition player 's handbook '' . 
  i think it 's a perfectly fine word to use . 
  i rest my case .
