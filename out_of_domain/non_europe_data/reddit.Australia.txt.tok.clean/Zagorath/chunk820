  i would make the aasimar variants work in exactly the same way as the tiefling variants do . 
  a winged option is obvious . 
  i 'd probably give them an optional ability score change of +2 wisdom and +1 charisma , to flip around their emphasis . 
  for the spell changes , i 'd go with one where they get spare the dying , healing word ( as 2nd level ) , and beacon of hope . 
  and another that swaps lesser restoration for augury . 
  this mirror 's the variant tiefling 's options where one replaces all of the original 's spells ( at the same level ) , and one that replaces only the spell it gets at 3rd level . 
  other spells that could be interesting to be used instead are zone of truth , prayer of healing , and protection from poison . 
  i ca n't think of anything particular to replace the variant tiefling 's *** appearance *** trait . 
  obviously an appearance trait for the aasimar , but i ca n't think of what that would be . 
  there was an argument over this ? 
  if he likes vader , then give him a similar path . 
  get him a mentor , someone he trusts ( palpatine ) . 
  then , have the character desire something that he simply can not get through his current moral code ( with anakin , he wanted to save padme from dying in childbirth ) . 
  note that this thing can be an ultimately good aim like saving a loved one , or saving a larger number of unknown innocents . 
  next , the mentor offers them a way to get what it is they want , but it requires embracing darkness somehow . 
  maybe he has to do a task for a dark lord before that dark lord will grant him the power to complete what he wants ( or the dark lord could do it themselves directly on behalf of the character ) . 
  maybe simply the act of carrying out the method of achieving what he wants is enough to fall . 
  finally , if he takes the step to embrace this darkness , for added dramatic effect , you can reveal that it still failed to achieve the goal ( padme still died ) . 
  alternatively , you can have it work , and use that as leverage to prevent him going back to the light . 
  based on how i 've heard it said in the media , i * think * it 's something like anastasia ( like the russian princess , although the premier 's name is n't spelt the same ) pa-la-shek . 
  but i 'm not entirely sure . 
  yeah , the australian actor ( of polish descent ) yvonne strzechowski is better known by her anglicised name yvonne strahovski . 
  i 've always imagined it as a sort of cross between `` str '' and the `` cz '' from `` czech '' , but i 'm not actually sure . 
  that 's * sir * patrick to you . 
  lost mines of phandelver , the goblin cave at the very beginning . 
  one character climbs up the chute directly to klarg 's room . 
  the others follow after him , but he quickly gets knocked unconscious . 
  shortly after , another character accidentally triggered a wild surge , which turned everyone in the room invisible . 
  unable to see him , nobody succeeded in stabilising the first character . 
  and that 's how a sorcerous wild surge resulted in our first character death happening in our second ever session playing 5e . 
  later that same campaign , our dwarven barbarian got angry and ran off on his own . 
  i roll on a random encounter table , and he gets orcs . 
  now , part of this guy 's backstory is that he * hated * orcs . 
  he would go full rage and attack them on sight , no concern for his own safety . 
  he rollplayed it brilliantly , and he managed to slay 3 of the 4 orcs , and brought the other one down to within one , * maybe * two shots of death . 
  but they were too much for him , and he fell . 
  as he was making his death saving throws , the orc was looting his body . 
  first death save , and he rolls a 20 , and pops back to life with 1 hp . 
  the smart thing to do , obviously , would be to pretend to be unconscious still . 
  but this guy absolutely despised orcs , so he tried to kill the damn thing . 
  unfortunately , in his position , the orc easily knocked him back out by striking him with the hilt of his axe . 
  this time , he failed his death saving throws . 
  on the other hand , hungry jacks . 
   john constantine, 
  wow , weird baader-meinhof phenomenon . 
  i 'm literally watching the show right now . 
  his appearance on the latest episode of arrow piqued my interest . 
  holy shit is it a good show . 
  yep , it 's definitely okay to use evil for good . 
  however , one thing that might be interesting to try ( or it might not , totally up to you ) would be to play with the idea of the evil being a corrupting force . 
  while you might want to use it for good , and eventually get out of the pact , perhaps it subtly gradually tries to sway you to do evil . 
  this idea is mentioned quite a bit with regards to the one ring in the lord of the rings , and in star wars , anakin first turned to the dark side purely with the intention of doing good : he wanted to save padme from her death . 
  that 's correct . 
  it would * not * work for divine smite , but * would * work for searing smite . 
  i do n't know about * every * other country , but amazon video does n't exist in * any * form in most countries . 
  in fact , i was surprised to read that they have it in the uk , germany , and japan . 
  had you asked me yesterday , i would probably have guessed the us and canada are the only places with it . 
  amazon is notoriously bad for being one of the absolute * worst * of the big american tech companies when it comes to international support . 
  netflix is the same with its content . 
  you can watch house of cards on netflix anywhere that * has * netflix , but they do n't make it available to places just for their exclusive content . 
  that said , if amazon is refusing to show this in some places that it * does * ** already ** have amazon video ... well , that 's even more stupid than otherwise . 
  they actually sorta can in some limited circumstances . 
  it 's known as a `` zero-width joiner '' ( unicode character u +200 d ) . 
  it gets used in languages like arabic mainly , but more recently emoji have started using it to create more complicated emoji . 
  for example , a four-person family can be created by using zero width joiners along with the emoji for `` man '' , `` woman '' , `` girl '' , and `` boy '' . 
  similarly , different coloured emoji can be created by zero-width joining the `` neutral '' version of it and a special character that exists solely to modify the colour of other emoji . 
  it would make sense if font renderers designed their fonts to cause a zero-width joined exclamation mark and question mark into an interrobang , but as far as i 'm aware , that is n't done today . 
  surprise jets are a little too tomorrow , when the war began for me . 
  i note you specifically said `` presented on the web site '' with regards to reading reviews . 
  this was unusually specific , and i do n't know whether or not you meant it to be . 
  i typically read reviews from third-party sources , and * not * the website i 'm buying through , unless i 'm buying on ebay and want to make sure this particular seller is reliable . 
  so i answered those questions basically by saying that i rarely view the reviews * on the site * , but it 's important that this not be interpreted as saying that i do n't read reviews at all . 
  til amazon sells clothes . 
  no mention of hawkgirl , but an appearance or two . 
  [ spoiler ] ( #s `` she 's the woman that was serving cisco coffee . '' ), 
  in real life , on average , about one quarter of your cousins should have the same last name as you , in traditional western naming systems . 
  none of the cousins on your mother 's side of the family will , since they will either have your mother 's maiden name , or a different name . 
  on your father 's side of the family , the children of your * uncles * will have the same name as you . 
  so if your father has any brothers , and they have kids , those kids will share your last name . 
  yeah , we briefly see her look up at the sky . 
  not to my knowledge . 
   just pick shows with only one season, 
  i just binged constantine ( not a netflix show , but a show with just 1 season of roughly netflix length ) . 
  13 ~ 40 min episodes , over the course of a single night and morning ... 
  probably was n't healthy to do that , but i loved the character 's appearance on arrow so much i just could n't stop myself . 
  like the other guy says , routh 's movie was mediocre , and i doubt you 'll find anyone who 'll argue against that . 
  but there were a couple of good things about it , and one was definitely routh 's performance , both as clark and as superman . 
  ( two other good things about it , imo , were spacey 's performance as luther , and the score . ), 
  what was lacking was the writing , directing , and action . 
  they do n't have routh on payroll , since this is n't an arrowverse show ( at least * yet * -- with multiverse stuff , who knows what might happen down the line ) . 
  they also * really * should n't use cavill , because that would mean that this superman as the same one from that piece of shit movie a couple of years ago . 
  dc does n't want that because they do n't want to tie their films and tv shows together , and personally i do n't want that because i do n't want the shows to get tied down in that universe . 
  it 's also roughly equally about jobs and gates , as opposed to * just * being about jobs . 
  and it is , surprisingly , the most factually accurate of the movies . 
  [ here 's a link to a pdf ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0byjhrwzi6znom1dovtjjz1lmtfk/view?usp=sharing ) . 
  this is a 5e conversion of a race from the 4e book `` heroes of shadow '' . 
  vrylokas are humans that underwent some sort of ritual to gain greater lifespan , and they are essentially living vampires . 
  i built this race with / u/the _ singular_anyone 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3qnv6q/vampire _ prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big / ) in mind . 
  in particular the small blood point pool is meant to merge with that class 's pool . 
  the quote is from serana in skyrim 's dawnguard expansion , because i kinda view the vryloka as similar to the vampire lords in skyrim , as compared to the `` baser '' vampires .
