  they 're not exactly the same thing , but i view them as thematically similar . 
  i estimate this race as about a +6 in [ this race balance guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  huge thanks to / u/sakilla07 for help with a couple of the features in v1 , and especially for enormous help with formatting .

  this is a 5e conversion of a race from the 4e book `` heroes of shadow '' . 
  vrylokas are humans that underwent some sort of ritual to gain greater lifespan , and they are essentially living vampires . 
  i built this race with / u/the _ singular_anyone 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3qnv6q/vampire _ prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big / ) in mind . 
  in particular the small blood point pool is meant to merge with that class 's pool . 
  the quote is from serana in skyrim 's dawnguard expansion , because i kinda view the vryloka as similar to the vampire lords in skyrim , as compared to the `` baser '' vampires .

  very good point . 
  i 'm thinking a bit less than a glass , say , 150 ml or so . 
  substantially less than one would give irl when donating blood . 
  the lifeblood ability is related in that it will sate the blood dependency , but you can also sate it out of combat through roleplay . 
  i 've deliberately left the mechanics of that unspecified to give players and dms freedom to work with it how they feel best . 
  no additional damage . 
  it 's mainly meant to be a ribbon feature , and the amount of blood being taken is way less than one would give when donating blood , and that barely leaves one slightly dizzy . 
  haha you 're right . 
  i could n't think of a quick elegant way to inform the player that yes , even temporary healing effects are halved by blood dependency . 
  so i made use of `` the exception that proves the rule '' by pointing out the exception that the temp hit points you gain are not halved when using lifeblood , intending that to imply that temporary hit points would otherwise be halved . 
  logically there is some sense to that , but it would be a really weird game mechanic . 
  i ca n't think of any other abilities that specifically alter their effect magnitude based on the target 's stats in this way . 
  i actually initially had it as 1d4 +1 , basically half a healing potion , but changed it based on feedback that giving it a little scalability would help . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean regarding balancing mechanic . 
  as far as i can remember , very few races have any real `` negatives '' to them , apart from the ones with superior darkvision , which this does not . 
   the ` blood dependency ' could be a little more deadly . 
  maybe it should be akin to exhaustion , seeing as you probably do n't need to eat like a human . 
  that 's certainly an interesting idea . 
  though i might argue that a single level of exhaustion , hell , even two levels , is generally going to have little impact on the player in combat situations , while half healing is substantially worse , particularly if it 's a melee character . 
   it seems to be pigeon-holed as a warlock . 
  interesting . 
  i had viewed it as either the vampire prestige class or a rogue mostly , but i can definitely see why you 'd play it as a warlock ( both in terms of stats and roleplay ) . 
  stat-wise , it could also fairly easily play a paladin ( on account of the strength option ) , bard , or sorcerer fairly comfortably . 
  because it 's meant to be mostly a ribbon , and i did n't want the feature to be too powerful when used on enemies , there 's really no negative effects on the target . 
  the amount of blood being taken is substantially less than if one were to give blood irl , and that barely leaves one slightly dizzy . 
  but i agree , i absolutely love their lore , it 's incredibly interesting . 
  the heroes of shadow was my absolutely favourite thing to come out after the `` essentials '' switch . 
  yeah , hence the ` surprisingly ' . 
  well , the original write up i did of this did n't mention blood points at all . 
  it was just `` if you go two days without drinking '' . 
  i reworked it to use the blood points after i saw that prestige class , so it would mesh better with that . 
  and i feel it would weaken the race a little too much if it had to expend a point to get that advantage , considering it 's a once per day ability . 
  and is * excruciatingly * inaccurate in the portrayal of that relationship ( or so i 've heard ; i neither know much about jobs ' private life , nor have i seen the film ) . 
  he actually reconnects with her much , much earlier than the film implies . 
  am i the only one mildly annoyed that flood creek appears not to be a creek , but a lake ? 
  did you know that the size of a gallon varies depending on which side of the atlantic you 're on ? 
   if i recall my theory correctly quantum computer `` qubits '' are quaternary ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) . 
  that 's interesting . 
  i always assumed that they were binary , but could calculate in both the 1 and 0 at once . 
  but if they are quaternary , they really should be called ququits . 
  the first qu is for quantum , and the second is from `` quaternary digits '' , just like bits is `` binary digits '' . 
  yeah , i think the point buy cap at 15 is just dumb , when 18s are possible through rolling , and 17s or 16s are n't even that rare . 
  wow . 
  i had no idea that manoeuvre was even possible . 
  yup . 
  it goes against the rules of monopoly , and makes the game last way longer than it should , and ultimately makes the game way less fun . 
  other common ways people play that are actually incorrect include requiring everyone to go around the board once before buying property , and * not * auctioning off properties if someone lands on it but chooses not to buy it -- if a property is landed on , it * must * be sold off , if the person who lands there does n't want to or ca n't afford to pay the asking price , it goes to auction with the whole group . 
   tremendous bonus vs tremendous failure, 
  2x damage , unless what you mean is 2x the * max * damage ( rather than 2x the damage that you roll ) is actually only * slightly * more than max damage . 
  in fact , the way 5e does it , with 2x the dice but 1x any static modifiers , is * exactly * equal to the max damage on average . 
  it does . 
  edit : but the wording of that ability was kinda weird . 
  i think i 'll clean it up and make it clearer in the next version . 
  under lifeblood i specify that the temporary hit points gained through * lifeblood * are not halved . 
  the intent of this was to point out that otherwise , the temp hit points gained * are * halved , without increasing the wordiness of blood dependency . 
  but yeah , str or dex definitely makes sense , and would probably actually be more in line with the ability from 4e . 
  yeah , but the fact that you 're likely to get at least one score  = 16 with rolled stats makes rolling objectively the better option . 
  and being better at something is what most people find more fun . 
  to have the ability to get to 18 at level 1 ( * after * racial bonuses -- so a 16 base stat ) through point buy feels like a no brainer . 
  not allowing it is just deliberately nerfing the option of point buy . 
  should we bring similar legislation to the federal level with the model parliament ? 
  well , my aim was to produce something that resembled what wizards might produce if they get around to re-making the race . 
  though , that said , i did already do the weird thing with the blood points , to synergise with the vampire prestige class ... 
  even so , i think the * reason * wizards does n't use mechanics like that is that it would feel unsatisfying to the player . 
  how effective your ability is will be is almost arbitrary and random , rather than being something the player can control and choose to improve . 
  do people with an interest in politics really not know their local member ? 
  surely that would be one of the first things one would make sure to understand . 
  why would he have ? 
  he 's never dealt with anything occult or involving souls before . 
  the fact that he does n't call on the flash more is a way bigger problem than constantine . 
  yes , it definitely makes sense thematically . 
  but as a game mechanic it 's unsatisfying , and it 's also inconsistent with the way other game mechanics have been designed . 
  perhaps your con being higher means that you can make better use of that sickly blood , for an explanation of how it works . 
  these are the canonical names from vrylokas , i did n't make them up myself . 
  besides , vrylokas are a fantasy race with only very loose ties to real-world mythology of vampires , which itself has only loose ties to the real-world culture of eastern europe . 
  edit : and how does `` gift from god '' make no sense ? 
  given their origins it is the * perfect * name . 
  they have literally been given the gift of living vampirism by a higher entity . 
  i decided to remove the specificness of which entity in my version , but canonically it is the raven queen , a god from one of the d&d pantheons . 
  if it were in the setting of tamriel and the elder scrolls games , it would probably be molag bal . 
  you 're confusing silicon and silicone . 
  i * wish * they would sell me a $ 500 phone . 
  i ca n't get any decent phones for that low a price ... 
  cheapest nexus 6p is a touch over $ 1000 ... 
  yeah , wis would be your second most important stat as a monk . 
  plus , aarakocra have a faster fly speed . 
   that 's exactly what this post is , but from the problem players perspective, 
  really ?
