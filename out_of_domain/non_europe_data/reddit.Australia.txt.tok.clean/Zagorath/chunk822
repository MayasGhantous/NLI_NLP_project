  the first one seems to have both a problem player and a problem dm , and it 's from the perspective of the problem player , so okay . 
  the second one is a single player doing something that makes perfect sense . 
  the rest of the group is the problem . 
  the third one is hard to say . 
  yes it 's a shitty move to get everyone except one person a model ( and it 's * not * true that heroforge does n't have dragonborn -- i just checked ) , but on the other hand , they 're really expensive , and it 's a bit shitty to expect a player to buy more things than they want to . 
  so kinda both are shitty , kinda both are right . 
  the fourth is clearly the group in the wrong . 
  the fifth is clearly a bad dm . 
  and the sixth seems to be a shitty group . 
  so * none * of these were exclusively from the perspective of the problem player , and only about one and a half were from the perspective of the problem player in addition to someone else . 
  only if you refer to the `` pie '' as being `` amount of dollars '' . 
  but i do n't think that 's what this scenario refers to . 
  `` money '' is a thing that exists only to facilitate the trade of * actual * goods and services . 
  more money works as you describe , it results in inflation , which means the power of each dollar is less . 
  however , if we have more * things * . 
  if we produce a greater amount of food , cars , phones , and more people ( or robots ) providing services like transport , programming , and teaching , the real price of those things goes down , and the spending power each person has increases . 
  grey mentions this in his video . 
  in short : yes , it could be that , like in past situations , new jobs will arise and the `` doomsday scenario '' will be averted . 
  but it just does n't seem likely in this case . 
  there are a * lot * of jobs that could easily disappear over the next century ; too many for it to seem likely that they 'll be adequately replaced . 
  one of the most obvious examples , but far from the * only * one , is that the entire transport industry could be gone ( or , rather , ~ 90 % of its workers could be made redundant ) within the next 25-50 years . 
  the problem is, 
   just think of what my character would do with the knowledge they have, 
  i 'd not a straightforward task all the time . 
  the example of the wizard with the flesh golem from the op , for example . 
  with my rather bookish warlock ( i actually had higher int than cha at level 1 , and my back story involved working in a library ) when i encountered a troll , i felt very little problem with acting as though i knew it was weak against fire . 
  but a more obscure thing , like knowing raksashas ( sp . ), 
  are weak against piercing damage from a magical weapon wielded by a good-aligned character , is a trickier matter in some cases ( in my case , i can comfortably say my character would * not * know it , but other bookish or intelligent characters might have a reasonable chance of knowing ) . 
   every time one of those envelopes go through the mail , the credit card company pays for the postage, 
  i find this really interesting . 
  i 've never received a credit card letter of the sort you describe ( my guess is that they do n't do it in my country ) , but i * have * received a number of letters that include an envelope for replies . 
  from memory , they call themselves pre-paid , or use the term `` postage paid '' , which i took to mean that they 've paid for return shipping even if the person * does n't * fill it out and return it . 
  i know the one time i 've needed to send mail that could be returned to me , it involved paying for both the envelope there and another one for return in advance , and pre-labelling the return one . 
  are you sure that this is n't the case for them , too ? 
  according to my googling , i think it 's a `` delivery bar code sorter '' . 
  yeah neither do i. 
  from the name , my guess is that it scans barcodes and uses them to sort the mail somehow . 
  i 've never liked the word viscosity . 
  to me , it 's always felt like it should mean the opposite of what it does . 
  it feels like something that has a high viscosity should be more runny than something with low viscosity . 
  i ca n't be the only one , right ? 
  yeah but that 's exactly the same problem . 
  in fact , for me that 's the * root * of the problem . 
  something that 's `` viscous '' sounds like it should be really runny . 
  yes , that was the intent of it . 
  you still need the con and cha of 13 , but you do n't need to get to level 5 or go through `` grave apotheosis '' , since your vampiric nature means that you have the tendency/ability to become a fully-fledged vampire already . 
  incidentally , something i could n't work in to the more limited flavour-text format of 5e as compared to 4e was that racially , vryloka look down upon their kinsmen who choose to fully embrace the darkness . 
  of the vampire class , it says :, 
   despite their ties to vampirism , vrylokas maintain a strong taboo against the complete embrace of an undead existence . 
  they seek eternal life , not the empty shell of an undead existence . 
  a vryloka who becomes undead is an outcast , a pariah hunted for his or her corruption of the vryloka bloodlines . 
  however , rumors abound of powerful vryloka nobles who have successfully hidden their vampiric nature for decades .

  holy shit , this is a thing ? 
  that is so fucking useful !, 
  that is one regex class that i did n't know existed . 
  now , if only there were a way to replace the ctrl/cmd-f functionality in the browser to enable regexes ... 
  [ i got ta be honest , i do n't see the similarity ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3k7ibrb.jpg ) . 
  your title reminded me of [ this story ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21zwpt/hating _ orcs_with_a_twist / ) . 
  i do find it very interesting , from a flavour perspective , just * how many * ways there are of having a character that 's nature-oriented . 
  the druid is the most obvious , of course . 
  the ranger has this flavour quite strongly , too . 
  the nature cleric has it in its name , and is clearly a nice choice for a highly religious aspect of nature . 
  the oath of ancients paladin is another good fit , and to a lesser extent , the fey warlock . 
  and each of these is a great choice . 
  they all take slightly different takes on the idea of nature . 
  they focus on different aspects of it , or have characters which choose to treat it in different ways . 
  well , exactly * how * one defines the set \u2115 is up for debate , so that can be interesting . 
  in computer science and related fields , it 's common to define \u2115 as \u2124 ^ ( \u2265 0 ) , i.e. , the non-negative integers , i.e. , all whole numbers greater than or equal to 0 . 
  this is because in computing , most languages index arrays from 0 . 
  in some other fields , \u2115 may be defined as \u2124 ^ ( + ) , or the positive integers . 
  that is , numbers greater than or equal to * 1 * . 
  i got windows for free through dreamspark at my australian university , so definitely do n't write it off immediately as just an american thing . 
  that said , i think at my uni it 's only students in the engineering , architecture , and it faculty who get it . 
  as amell said around the time the flash 's second episode 's numbers were released :, 
   anybody can be trained to watch a pilot . 
  it 's the people that come back when they have n't been inundated with advertisement and they decide , `` i watched the show a week ago , i 'm going to watch it agin because i enjoyed myself the week before . '', 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' .
