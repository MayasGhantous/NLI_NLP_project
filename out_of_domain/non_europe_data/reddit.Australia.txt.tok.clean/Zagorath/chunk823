  abstentions/yet to vote :  0, 
  ### i think the ayes have it, 
  the motion passes . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for vote on remembrance day condolences motion, 
  oh dude ... hear fucking hear !, 
  i absolutely contend that prescriptivism and descriptivism are ** not ** at odds with one another . 
  descriptivism is describing how people tend to use the language , while prescriptivism is saying how one * wishes * the language were used . 
  i can acknowledge that a lot of people pronounce `` ask '' like `` ax '' , while also thinking that is the dumbest thing ever ( sidenote : this is hyperbole , i do n't mean it is * literally * the dumbest thing ever , unless you mean the hyperbolous meaning of literally ) , or that despite knowing that some people using the word `` marathon '' to refer to any long-ish run , the word should only ever be used for runs that are precisely 42.195 km . 
  this is a totally consistent and logical view to hold . 
  but badlinguistics does n't share this view . 
  they think that anyone who has any * opinion * about language is scum , and they have * zero * tolerance for anything that even slightly questions their views . 
  they do n't want to debate the merits of their stance . 
  they 'll just bad anyone that does n't join in on their circlejerk . 
  i 'm guessing it 's because the pluperfect is a form of past tense , so it feels like it should be `` ran '' . 
  i must say , i like the use of the 2dx mechanic here . 
  if it makes sense for anyone , it 's vampires . 
  it was poorly managed on wizards ' variant ranger class , but here it 's perfect . 
  i have no particular feedback on the actual features , but i will give you some advice on layout . 
  you should first put the features all vampires get at certain levels , and then go through each archetype separately , rather than going through each level , and at each level naming what abilities each archetype gets . 
  i do like the fact that you 've written specific mechanics for creating another vampire . 
  that 's a very interesting system . 
  if we 're taking bets , my money 's on episode 12 . 
  kara was stuck for 20 years , and since she arrived , it 's been about 20 or so years ( maybe a bit less ? ) . 
  does n't that mean superman has to be in his late 30s at the * least * ? 
  there 's also the first season to consider . 
  the relationship between superboy and superman was * not * a healthy one , for the longest time . 
  to be honest , i rather like that narrative . 
  the idea that while he 's publicly this great icon of humanity , but that he has difficulty managing his closest relationships . 
  contrasted with batman , whom the public sees as this dark , brooding , mysterious figure who works from the shadows , but has this large , warm , loving close family . 
  hahaha interesting . 
  at the moment , the bot only checks the list when it first starts up . 
  after exams i 'll get around to fixing that . 
  for now , it should work again : i 've restarted it . 
  i completely missed that aspect of it . 
  i have to say , i 'm * really * not a fan of this . 
  it sounds similar to how druids worked prior to 3e . 
  wizards removed that mechanic for a good reason . 
  it 's a pain for both the player and the dm , because they have to work together to put in opportunities to do this , otherwise the player ca n't get the levels that they want . 
  i was n't a fan of it with the rune scribe , but there it kinda made some sense , because of the flavour of the class . 
  but here it 's far worse , because it is both a pain mechanically , and does n't fit with most people 's visions of the way vampires work lorewise . 
  i know i 've never heard the * word * `` diablerie '' before , and i 've certainly never heard of vampires killing other vampires to gain more power . 
  i can get it for $ 50 here in australia , and over here you ca n't get any of the core books for less than $ 59.95 except online . 
  with some members absent , does that not make 5 an absolute majority ? 
  ah , fair enough . 
  just remember that if you 're googling for something , and you come across a link to the wizards forums , you can click on the arrow next to the link , and then click `` cached '' [ ( screenshot ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lljkrei.png ) , and at least for now , it 'll let you see the contents of the page before it was taken down . 
  you can also paste the link onto [archive.org 's wayback machine ] ( http://archive.org/web/ ) . 
  obviously this is useless if you want to participate in discussions , but it 's handy if you want to find something that used to exist on the wizards forums . 
  the question is put : that these motions be agreed to .

  ### results declared, 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for votes on taxation bills, 
  is this meant to be interpreted as an aye to each of the above motions , or just the first ? 
  would the honourable member please explain the purpose of his 6 surplus votes ? 
  it 's just a thing in western society ( well , really it 's more just anglophonic society ) that we are largely uncomfortable with sex and sexuality , far more than violence and death . 
  why is it ? 
  who knows . 
  religion probably plays a part in it , but that would n't explain why mainland europe is a little more forward in this respect than the anglospheric countries . 
  from random import randint, 
  randint ( 1,100000 ), 
  randint ( 1,100 ), 
  i hope that 's not cheating , but that 's how i went about answering it . 
  yeah seriously . 
  when i 'm dming i basically ignore my players ' rolls and trust that they 're being honest , and my table 's current dm does the same . 
  if you ca n't just trust your players , i honestly do n't know why you would be playing with them to begin with . 
  that 's not a table rule , it 's a variant official rule in the dmg . 
  i came across [ this thread ] ( / r/askreddit/comments / 3s9ne8/which _ war_movie_has_the_best_large_scale_battle / ) very recently . 
  just another example of the same kind of thing . 
  i think their high profile guys have a fourth option , for the unskippable less than 30 second ads . 
  that no doubt plays a part , but does n't explain why the far more liberal cultures of australia and the united kingdom have similar attitudes towards sex . 
  ah , interesting . 
  that second aspect sounds somewhat similar to the `` living dead '' trait on my [ 5e vryloka homebrew race ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3rveuc/vryloka _ race_v2 / ) . 
  the race was made mainly with singular 's prestige class in mind , but the way it 's worded would mean that it would bypass the diablerie requirements of this class , as well . 
  why is ` fireball ` extending ` conjuration ` ? 
  surely it should be ` evocation ` ? 
  i find this really bizarre . 
  the canadian dollar is currently stronger than the aussie , and as far as i can tell , canada 's gst is lower . 
  honestly as someone completely new to the series , it threw * we way off when the supernatural stuff turned out to be real . 
  i thought there was going to be some rational explanation for it . 
  so in that last little stretch of the game where the supernatural stuff came to the forefront , i was really shocked . 
  edit : thanks / u/thealienelite . 
  if you have n't gone to university and got a degree in engineering , you are n't an engineer . 
  plain and simple . 
  engineering is a profession with regulations and professional bodies . 
  you ca n't call yourself a doctor or a lawyer without the professional accreditation , and engineering is on the same lines . 
  programmers can be engineers ( as the article says , software engineering is a thing ) , but not * all * programmers are . 
  my group has had a small debate over the keen mind feat . 
  it says that you `` can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past month '' . 
  would this enable a wizard to prepare unlimited spells ? 
  the justification , some of my group has said , is that preparing spells goes as such : `` preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell '' . 
  or , if it would n't give you that , would it at least allow you to prepare spells without needing your spellbook ? 
  so that you could , for one month , still prepare a new list of spells each day even if you lost your spellbook . 
  and also recreate your * entire * spellbook if the old one was lost , instead of only being able to recreate the ones you had prepared .
