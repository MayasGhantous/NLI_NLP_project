  aid does n't give you temporary hp . 
  it temporarily increases your * actual * hp . 
  now , perhaps i 'm wrong , but i * think * that all temp hp effects are self created , which would make the question moot . 
  however , if there is an effect that someone can cast on you that grants temp hp , i would be inclined to say that no , if you 're already unconscious , you would not regain consciousness . 
  ah , so it does . 
  anyway , i just found that they do actually have a specific ruling on the matter :, 
   if you have 0 hit points , receiving temporary hit points does n't restore you to consciousness or stabilise you . 
  they can still absorb damage directed at you while you 're in that state , but only true healing can save you . 
  so , the temp hp could act as a buffer against the automatic failed death save that you receive whenever you get damaged , but they would not bring you back to consciousness . 
   if we rule however that a super long fall will take longer than 1 turn, 
  incidentally , ignoring air resistance and assuming earth-like gravity , the fall would have to be 177 m or more for it to take more than 1 turn . 
  edit : however , ignoring air resistance , you would reach a peak velocity just before landing of about 58.9 ms ^ ( -1 ) , which is slightly * more * than the real average terminal velocity reached when falling through earth 's atmosphere ( around 56 ms ^ ( -1 ) ) . 
  so you could actually fall from a substantially lower distance . 
  i 'd probably go with 150 m just to estimate a nice round , easily memorable number . 
  obviously , you also have the option of delaying a spell and using it as a reaction if you fall , if for some reason you expect you might fall . 
  that would negate any need to worry about how far you fall . 
  oh , very convenient . 
  i was * just * in the process of writing up the adjournment , too . 
  then why does amazon 's website routinely lie to customers and mislead them into expecting deals and prices that they are not actually eligible : even when said user is logged in to an account with all the information necessary to determine whether they are eligible for said deals ? 
  no , i 'm here until tomorrow . 
  what exactly is it i need to do ? 
  in accordance with the requirements of section 56 of the constitution , the governor-general recommends to the house of representatives that an appropriation be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to appropriate money out of the consolidated revenue fund for the ordinary annual services of the government , and for related purposes . 
  in accordance with the requirements of section 56 of the constitution , the governor-general recommends to the house of representatives that an appropriation be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to appropriate money out of the consolidated revenue fund for certain expenditure , and for related purposes . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  meta : is that it ? 
  meta : so , how is this going to work ? 
  i thought we were adjourning after the voting on the taxation bills was finished . 
  huh ? 
  are you two people or something , this_guy ? 
  you literally [ * just said * ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaushr/comments/3sdwt6/237a_introduction_of_appropriation_bill_no_1/cwwdmef ) to keep this open until * after * the debate . 
  i often forget that wizards makes stuff other than dungeons and dragons . 
  but yeah , they 're definitely really progressive . 
  the pictures and examples used pretty much exactly alternate between male and female , and they use a wide variety of races for pictures of humans . 
  i think the main picture in the 5e player 's handbook for the `` human '' race is a dark-skinned woman , for example . 
  am i the only one wondering why * preschool * kids are still wearing diapers ? 
   i came back to find people telling me how surprising it was that i did n't get mugged in hanoi or have an issue with corrupt police, 
  having lived in saigon for 6 years , i 'll say a couple of things about this . 
  personally i 've not really ever heard of people getting `` mugged '' in the traditional sense . 
  what does happen , particularly to women , is having their bags snatched by thieves on the back of a motorcycle . 
  they do n't threaten you with weapons or anything like that , just grab it and go . 
  corrupt police are a * serious * issue , but you 're unlikely to have to deal with them yourself as a tourist . 
  they routinely pull vehicles over ( whether it be motorbikes , cars , buses , etc. ), 
  and it 's just * expected * that you 'll pay a bribe , or they 'll find some excuse to fine you or hold you up . 
  if you traveled by bus or taxi at all , and the driver was ever pulled over , chances are he paid a bribe . 
  one time when we were trying to get some stuff delivered from overseas , we had an officer tell us we could pay a bribe of x , or pay import duties of like 10x ( i ca n't remember the exact amounts ) . 
  he sent this in writing through an email -- they 're that open about the corruption . 
  but as a normal tourist , you 're unlikely to do many things where you would encounter the police . 
  yeah , though i 'd say it 's not so much inconsistent as on a gradual downward gradient . 
  it probably is . 
  but i for one do n't give a shit . 
  it 's an awesome example of fantastic handwriting . 
  it absolutely belongs in this subreddit . 
  meta : the bot pages based on anyone who tries to page . 
  i just had it off overnight ( it runs on my desktop , which is in my bedroom ) , and forgot to turn it back on this morning . 
  am hoping to get a dedicated server at some point in the near-ish future , and i 'll throw the bot onto it . 
  it still sounds lame . 
  alignment should n't be prescriptive like that . 
  it 's an attempt to * describe * the way that they * generally * behave . 
  a character can be generally lawful good , but might have a particular soft spot for family , and would be willing to do * anything * to protect them , even if it 's unlawful . 
  that 's just * one * example of a * totally * legitimate character , and you 're * punishing * them for that . 
  characters are more than their alignment . 
  in fact , more than that : alignment is n't even an * aspect * of a character , it 's just a general , broad description . 
  this is an interesting title . 
  12,000 away from 50,000 is an over 20 % difference . 
  it would 've been more useful to say `` is about 2,000 signatures from hitting 40,000 '' . 
  honestly , i do n't know why it is , but i found this app was far less effective than sleepcycle alarm clock . 
  at the time i switched from ios ( ipod touch ) to android ( nexus 4 ) , the latter did n't have an android app , so i tried sleep as android , but it was vastly inferior . 
  i have n't tried out sleepcycle recently , but they apparently have an android app now , so i 'd recommend that . 
  since apparently your attempt to call a bot to link to it failed , here 's [ the official website ] ( http://www.sleepcycle.com/ ) , [ the ios app ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/sleep-cycle-alarm-clock/id320606217?mt=8 ) , and [ the android app ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northcube.sleepcycle&amp;hl=en ) . 
  how does this subreddit decide what 's * too * old for it ? 
  i honestly did n't even know there * was * a limit . 
  there 's only one idea of patientgaming : patient gaming . 
  it really does n't matter if millions of people start doing it , it 's still a great thing to do . 
  we buy games for way cheaper , do n't need to spend top dollars on hardware , and we get fully patched games . 
  it 's completely orthogonal to how trendy or popular the idea of doing it is . 
  so , are we going to get results ? 
  my problem is n't with the idea of penalising players in the form of negative xp . 
  it 's with the idea of penalising players for roleplaying `` out of alignment '' . 
  it 's with the idea of treating alignment as these exact boxes and you * must * ** always ** fit within exactly one of these boxes or else . 
  anyone got a list of all possible character results from this ? 
  i 'd make altmer and bosmer high elves and wood elves , respectively . 
  fairly intuitive . 
  the dunmer i would make drow , but remove the superior darkvision and sunlight sensitivity , and swap the spell they get at level 3 to burning hands . 
  alternatively , i might make the dunmer use the tiefling stats , with the same spell swap , and swapping the infernal language to elvish . 
  this would have the advantage of emphasising their fire resistance . 
  that 's not a point that needed clarifying . 
  the above suggestion was that you have one of the players ' characters kidnapped , and the doppelganger turns into that character . 
  then , to fool the rest of the players , you have the player of the character the doppelganger * looks * like actually play the doppelganger for a little while . 
  i would rate this race at * most * a +4.5 in [ this race balance guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) 's system . 
  that 's very low , you should generally be aiming for between 5.0 and 6.5 ( the lowest of official races does go as low as 4.0 , and the highest is 8.0 ) . 
  i 'd probably say give them 25 ft. movement , and * maybe * one more minor feature ( resistance to slashing seems like it might work ) . 
  also , the rule on this subreddit is homebrew stuff needs to be labelled as such with the [ homebrew ] tag . 
  for first drafts of homebrew material , i 'd recommend posting to / r/unearthedarcana rather than here , anyway , to get a bit more refined feedback without bothering people who do n't want to see homebrew stuff . 
  my issue is that the description above very clearly would penalise someone who takes an action that is undeniably against a person 's stated alignment , but only because of specific reasons . 
  to look at real life , hitler is a person that would undeniably be some sort of `` evil '' alignment ( i 'd probably say neutral evil ) . 
  but he was known to have a love of animals . 
  if he were a character , penalising him for roleplaying his love of animals because that 's `` good '' and the paper says he should be `` evil '' is unfair . 
  my example above of a lg character who might do chaotic things in a particular set of circumstances is one such scenario . 
  conversely , perhaps i 'm a human character that is largely lawful good , but who absolutely * detests * satyrs for some reason , and would do utterly evil things to them , and only them . 
  i 'm still completely lawful good in most situations , and it does n't feel appropriate to change that , so what i do if i meet satyrs goes against my `` alignment '' , but it is good characterisation , and should n't be met with penalty in the way the above comment described .
