  my bottom line is that if you want to penalise for doing stuff that does n't match the character , that 's fine ( as long as you provide generous opportunity for out-of-character discussion of why the action perhaps * was * fitting with the character , and err on the side of not penalising if you 're unsure of how well-done it was ) , but do n't do it along `` alignment '' lines . 
  look into the nuance of the character , because alignment is nothing more than a broad description . 
   4e was too few, 
  really ? 
  4e had 3 player 's handbooks , dozens of dragon magazines , a number of power source books ( arcane power , psionic power , divine power , etc. 
  ) , 5 `` heroes of '' books , and a number of setting-specific campaign guides and player 's guides . 
  i think 4e had much the same problem previous editions did . 
  it was * especially * bad when it came to feats and backgrounds . 
  i 'd say 4e hit a sweet spot when it came to race options , and was maybe * slightly * too many with regards to classes ( if you take into account 5e 's class + archetype system and treat each archetype as completely separate classes for these purposes ) , with way too many of the smaller choices like feats and backgrounds . 
  that 's how the adventurer 's league does things , but the majority of people do not play by those overly limiting rules . 
   there are nine different kinds of warlock you can play, 
  i must say , this is one thing i really love about warlocks . 
  so many different choices to make . 
  patron , pact , invocations , cantrips , and spells . 
  it 's really fun . 
  there 's really not much i want to see . 
  more monsters would obviously be nice , but as far as player material goes , i have exactly two things i 'd like to see : psionics ( and all that entails ) , and something resembling 4e 's `` heroes of shadow '' . 
  more setting material would also be nice . 
  stuff for eberron , dark sun , and ravenloft , for example . 
   would you agree , that despite the wording being unfortunate and open to uses that hamper rather than foster fun , there is still acceptable purposes for exp penalties under defined circumstances ? 
  personally , i do n't think i would enjoy it , but yes , i can support that in principle . 
  personally , i do n't enjoy counting xp at all . 
  my group goes with milestone levelling , for a few reasons . 
  one is that counting xp points is a resource that nobody can be arsed to count . 
  we also do n't keep track of rations , or count carry weight . 
  the other is that levelling that way is * so slow * . 
  one can easily go half a dozen sessions without levelling if you count xp and use the amount of xp on the monsters ' stat blocks . 
  and that 's no fun . 
   classes such as paladin , monk , barbarian , and others have an alignment requirement that removes class abilities if you change alignment, 
  oh god no . 
  those sorts of rules are dumb , and have n't been in d&d for nearly a decade . 
  it 's a relic of an older time , and games that do that sort of thing are , in my mind , inherently worse than ones which do not . 
  there 's a * reason * wizards removed the dumb alignment restrictions in 4e , and kept them out in 5e , and it was a good thing . 
   when your group 's paladin sits down to eat with villagers despite knowing they might serve a meal with meat from sentients ( cannibalism ) because he wants to earn their trust , that 's not grounds to fall , but i would expect the god of that paladin to disapprove of tacitly condoning cannibalism, 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  if he only thinks that they * might * serve him that , or he avoids actually eating the meat himself , i see no problem . 
  if he thinks gaining their trust would be ultimately beneficial to the greater good -- whether it be because said cannibal can help stop some world-ending event , can provide them with advice for stopping some greater evil ( a lich or vampire , perhaps ) , or that gaining his trust can lead you to be able to stop * his * organisation -- then i do n't see any good reason anyone should tell him he ca n't do that without penalty . 
  oh , so * she * was the character that did n't stick around . 
  in the arrow thread , people mentioned that there was a character early on who did n't stick around , but when i binged the show shortly afterwards , i never noticed who it was . 
  i 'm very glad that they decided to go with an overarching narrative , though . 
  but the thing i do n't get is that they introduced her replacement * in * episode 1 . 
  what was her replacement going to be otherwise ? 
  that would be nice , because any appearances by the character/actor would be appreciated , but what i really want is closure to the story that they did such a great job of developing . 
  you could n't get that on a crossover show like legends . 
  i agree with everything except abductions . 
  how are abductions not okay in fiction ? 
  the most stereotypical of all adventure stories is `` hero rescues abducted princess from a tower '' . 
  * mario * , a game loved by people of all ages , is fundamentally about an abduction . 
  shrek , a movie aimed at children ( with elements that make it approachable by adults , as well ) starts off being about an abduction . 
  in real life , abductions are an absolutely terrible thing , but they 're a very common staple of fiction , and can be used very easily without offending any but the most easily offended and those very rare people who have had first-hand experience . 
  why is everyone grouping rape and abductions together like this ? 
  rape is horrible , and so are abductions , but one is much easily to put into fiction in a tasteful way than the other . 
  i 've never heard of rape being used in a way that was n't shocking and intended to be so . 
  i agree that it should absolutely be avoided in your game in all but the most rare circumstances . 
  but abductions are an adventure fiction * staple * . 
  it 's a trope that has been used in everything from mario to shrek . 
  unless someone at your table has had first-hand experience with someone they know being abducted ( an unlikely scenario ) , you can easily use abductions in your game without harm . 
  haha that 's brilliant . 
  the layout is * very * typical of a vietnamese website , though most vietnamese sites tend to use pictures and other shit like normal sites that make them not look this terrible . 
  that 's not so much an inappropriate analogy as an entirely appropriate analogy to an inappropriate question . 
  seriously , it 's downright immature . 
  normally , if i find an opinion i disagree with , i neither upvote nor downvote . 
  downvoting because you disagree is immature and against rediquette , but at the same time , i find it hard to upvote something that i do n't agree with . 
  but in this thread , i 'm making an exception : upvotes for everyone who appears to be acting in good faith , just to counteract the fact that there seem to be a few people in here downvoting * every * comment ... 
  i misread that as `` repeat your sins '' . 
  that was amusing for a second . 
  hear , hear !, 
  the criticism that 4e is bad at roleplay is just bullshit . 
  yes , it 's different , but it 's equally capable of doing any type of gameplay you prefer . 
  sure , it did n't have pages of complicated mechanics for every possible situation , but that 's because it aimed to give the dm greater leeway to run with things as he felt made sense ; an improvement that was brought forward to 5e . 
  it 's a very different game to the way attacks and vancian magic worked in previous edition , and work in 5e , but it 's certainly not any * worse * in any respect because of that . 
  i would say this : the race balancing guide is a very good one , but it is a * guide * . 
  personally , i think it 's better to build a race that you think makes sense thematically first , and then analyse it and adjust until it has an appropriate score , rather than building it specifically by adding points up, 
  is lucky really that great ? 
  it 's not * quite * as good as a theoretical ability that changes your d20 rolls from ` randint ( 1,20 ) ` to ` randint ( 2,20 ) ` . 
  you 've got a 1/19 chance of getting each individual value , bumping the average from 10.5 to 11 . 
  and it 's not even * quite * that good , because on the reroll , you still can get a 1 . 
  honestly , i 'd probably put it as slightly better than natural weapons , but not much better . 
  +0.5 seems reasonable to me . 
  [ here 's a link to a pdf ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0byjhrwzi6znoc1flanq2m1i4v0k/view?usp=sharing ) . 
  this is a 5e conversion of a race from the 4e book `` heroes of shadow '' . 
  vrylokas are humans that underwent some sort of ritual to gain greater lifespan , and they are essentially living vampires . 
  i built this race with / u/the _ singular_anyone 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3qnv6q/vampire _ prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big / ) in mind . 
  in particular the small blood point pool is meant to merge with that class 's pool . 
  the quote is from serana in skyrim 's dawnguard expansion , because i kinda view the vryloka as similar to the vampire lords in skyrim , as compared to the `` baser '' vampires . 
  they 're not exactly the same thing , but i view them as thematically similar . 
  i estimate this race as about a +6 in [ this race balance guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  huge thanks to / u/sakilla07 for help with a couple of the features , and especially for enormous help with formatting . 
  i 've made a few changes since the last version . 
  a few people made notes that seemed to imply the `` lifeblood '' feature was a bit weak , so i 've extended it to also work on strength saving throws ( probably not worth very much ) and also continually work until the end of your next turn ( somewhat more useful ) . 
  i also added in the `` human heritage '' feature . 
  this was always meant to be in there , but i just realised i accidentally forgot to write it in when making the pdf . 
  it was already being accounted for in the race balance guide , even though it was n't actually included in previous releases .
