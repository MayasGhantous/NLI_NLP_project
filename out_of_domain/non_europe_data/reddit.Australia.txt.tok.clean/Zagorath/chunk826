  i estimate this race as about a +6 in [ this race balance guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  huge thanks to / u/sakilla07 for help with a couple of the features , and especially for enormous help with formatting . 
  i 've made a few changes since the last version . 
  a few people made notes that seemed to imply the `` lifeblood '' feature was a bit weak , so i 've extended it to also work on strength saving throws ( probably not worth very much ) and also continually work until the end of your next turn ( somewhat more useful ) . 
  i also added in the `` human heritage '' feature . 
  this was always meant to be in there , but i just realised i accidentally forgot to write it in when making the pdf . 
  it was already being accounted for in the race balance guide , even though it was n't actually included in previous releases . 
  this is intended to be the last version . 
  unless there are some really major errors i probably wo n't do another update . 
  it 's not quite the same thing , but i wonder if you 'd be interested in seeing the homebrow [ vryloka race ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 3sj2iq/homebrew _ vryloka_race / ) i made , based on the race of the same name from heroes of shadow . 
  could you explain how you get those numbers ? 
  my maths says with a +10 to-hit against ac16 , you have , indeed , a 75 % chance of hitting ( a 6 or higher ) . 
  with the halfling 's lucky ( not to be confused with the feat lucky , which is significantly stronger ) , you still succeed on a 6 and up , but if you roll a 1 , you get a second chance . 
  if we * assume * that you always succeed on a 1 , that would mean you have a 16/20 chance of hitting , which is 80 % . 
  and lucky * is n't * actually that powerful , because you * do n't * automatically succeed on the second throw : you have a 75 % chance of succeeding . 
  so it would in fact be 78.75 % chance of hitting , an extra 3.75 % . 
  and no , `` critical fails '' are not a normal thing . 
  unless you mean that you automatically fail on a 1 , which yeah , most people do that , but that 's because a 1 is so low that even with a large bonus , you 're going to fail at most things . 
  the same is true of a 2 or a 3 , as well . 
  whatever the case , taking into account home rules is not something one should be doing when building a race feature . 
  the tale of sir bearington is perhaps one of the most well-known ones in d&d . [ here 's the last time it was submitted in / r/dndgreentext ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2179ea/sir _ bearington / ) . 
  also , if you 're interested , it actually * was n't * originally in the greentext format that it usually gets passed around in . 
  [ here is the original story of sir bearington ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dpqop/the _ original_story_of_sir_bearington / ) . 
  wow that video was great . 
  really insightful . 
  if you liked it , you may also like [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zuynhkal1i ) . 
  it does n't deal with any of the same * specific * content details , but it takes a very similar approach to a similar problem in tes . 
  also , i have n't watched [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwetahyr4o0 ) fully yet , but it was recommended in the sidebar , and from the 1:30 that i 've watched so far , it seems like it might also do a good job of tackling similar themes . 
  yeah , i realise it 's a little awkward . 
  basically , the intent was that because this is noted as a specific * exception * , that readers will intuit that it means that * otherwise * , temporary healing effects * are * halved by this , just as real healing effects are . 
  ( i was making use of `` the exception that proves the rule '' . ), 
  but now that i think about it , that seems like a dumb idea anyway . 
  you 're not the first person to have asked about it , and when i think about it , a lot of the temp hp effects are almost vampiric or necromantic in nature anyway ( false life , the fiend-lock 's 1st level ability , etc. 
  ) , so it makes sense not to halve them from a thematic point of view . 
  so yeah , i 'll edit it to remove that . 
  edit : it 's updated . 
  i only played it earlier this year . 
  have n't finished going through the awakening or the standalone smaller dlc adventures , but i absolutely loved the base game from a story perspective . 
  the mechanics were an awful pain to sludge through , though . 
  who is mr. boner , exactly ? 
  why is everyone mentioning him ? 
  what 's wrong with the combat as included ? 
  a great place to start is [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which contains a lot of the best stories . 
  a couple of the ones in the `` long '' section are ** really ** long . 
  stranded and demigods , in particular . 
  but trust me , they 're * so * worth it . 
  you may just want to read them over a few days , reading a few pages or so at a time . 
   you need to drink 200 ml of blood but does n't say how much that is, 
  200 ml is 200 ml , as in 1/5th of a litre . 
   medium creatures have 3 blood points , large have 5 blood points, 
  creatures who are n't either vrylokas or vampires ( using singular 's vampire prestige class ) have 0 blood points . 
  they 're a mechanic that are used to represent both vampiric power and the urge to feed . 
  vaguely similar to ki or sorcery points : you have 0 of them if you have n't taken the right choices to gain them . 
  for what it 's worth , 200 ml is a tiny amount , not even a full glass . 
  when you donate blood , you 'll generally give around 500 ml , and after that , you 'll barely feel dizzy . 
  my intent was for it to be significant enough that it would realistically take a fair amount of time , but small enough to have no negative effect on the meal . 
  if a heap of people were feeding on the same person in a short span of time , that might change things , but i feel it 's enough of an edge case that it 's best just left unspecified : dms and players can work out how to deal with that as they feel is appropriate . 
  as for the power , i 've got a few possibilities , what do you like ? 
  * change from either strength * or * dex +1 to * both * +1, 
  * proficiency with deception , intimidation , or persuasion, 
  * lifeblood made a short rest power , or maybe even an at-will one ( and maybe remove the grapple aspect , if it were to be at-will ) . 
  in his defense , i 'm not entirely sure his problem is with my use of a volumetric value for amount of blood . 
  instead , he seems to be after complicated mechanics for how a loss of blood affects the character . 
   also when i say that sized creatures have blood points i just mean they have 3/6/8 blood point worth of blood in their bodies . 
  at zero you drink them dry and kill them . 
  oh fair enough , that makes a lot more sense . 
  well , the answer is that to literally suck them dry , you would have to feed approximately 20 times without giving them time to produce new blood . 
  to kill them would probably be about 10 , assuming similar constitution ( using the term more in its english language sense than its d&d stat sense ) to real humans . 
  but again , this is something i have * intentionally * left out . 
  it 's not necessary to run the race , and if i were to include something , it would be way outside the scope of what the race itself is doing : it would be essentially saying `` this is how a slow loss of blood works in all situations , and it 's something that can be applied with this race '' , rather than being `` this is how this race works '' . 
  it 's up to the dm and players to decide how blood draining would work at their table , if it becomes relevant . 
  i 'd rather stay away from the spells thing , for a couple of reasons . 
  one is that it 's a fairly complicated feature , with a lot to keep track of : i 'd rather avoid that when the class already has a few very complicated features . 
  another is that it 's an extremely powerful one ( the balance guide gives it +1.5 ) , and i certainly do n't think the class is * that * underpowered as is . 
  it also does n't fit very well thematically with vrylokas : that 's more of a thing for vampires that fully embrace the undead . 
  i had another look at heroes of shadow , and i think i 'll add stealth proficiency . 
  that would probably also help give the race a bit more viability for rogues which one user thought was lacking in a previous draft . 
  how does 1 thp per level from lifeblood sound ? 
  or perhaps con mod + 1 per level ? 
  oh haha , i completely missed that . 
  nice touch . 
  it 's not something i came up with myself , though , it 's the term used in heroes of shadow . 
   hearing some thugs brag about murdering people ... is a pretty justifiable reason for the guy to lose his shit, 
  fucking ** thank you ** . 
  i 'm meant to be the god-damn * evil * character in my campaign , and yet when i go back to the satyrs that nearly caused a tpk by setting some ravenous giant bird things on us , and probably did the same to other travellers , * not one * of my party members joined in with me when i decided to straight up murder those half-horse bitches . 
  was n't until we managed to drag it out of the satyrs , get them to admit that they had no remorse for killing travellers , that the rest of my party saw fit to join in . 
  and then we get back to our druid patrons ( and , at least in our campaign , these druids have a known dislike of satyrs ) , and they hear about this and exile us from their lands , under pain of death . 
   be me dm game of paranoia usual hijinks follow . 
   one player is actual commie manages to get ultraviolet clearance . 
   is allowed to program computer decides that while he could just reprogram computer to be communist i would screw him over ( i had idea of turning it a bit of computer computer never changes to echoe a bit of fallout ), 
   so instead he reprograms it to self destruct . 
   group agrees to go back to drd since we obviously need a break and more experience if somebody got all that high . 
  i think that 's how you meant to format it . 
  in the future , check out our [ style guide ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/wiki/style ) for tips on how to format things . 
  yeah , if it were dropbox or copy doing something like this , i could believe that . 
  but there 's no way drive is a significant enough income source for google that they 'd be doing much at all to push its profitability up . 
  more people doing more things with google in a general sense is what they want , and that includes using their reviewing system . 
   not everything has to grow to a google scale . 
  failure to grow to a google scale is not always a bug . 
  this is true .
