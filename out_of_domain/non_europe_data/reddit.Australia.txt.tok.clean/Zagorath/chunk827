  so yes , things here * do * have to grow to a google scale , since we are literally dealing with something from google . 
  you do n't even have to delete them if you 'd rather have it still look to them like you 're `` friends '' with them . 
  you can click a button to have their stuff not show up in your feed .

  the rogue should only have to roll to unlock a door if trying and failing would set off a trap , or if he needs to get it open before the guard in patrol comes around the corner and spots him , or if there is some other consequence of failure . 
  [ this fantastic article ] ( http://theangrygm.com/five-simple-rules-for-dating-my-teenaged-skill-system/ ) goes in to a lot more detail about the nuance of this , and exactly why you should use it . 
  if there 's no time penalty or consequence for trying and failing once , you should let them take 20 . 
  it 's not in the rules , but basically if the barbarian is trying to break down a door , and he rolls a 6 , there is n't necessarily anything stopping him from trying again . 
  let him keep trying until he either gets a 20 and finds out `` oh , this is too strong for me to ever break down without using a tool '' , or succeeds on the check . 
  or , simulate that without making him roll over and over again by just saying he can take 20 and automatically succeed if it is at all possible . 
  do n't do this if there 's a guard coming on patrol , or if failing to break down the door would alert someone that 's sleeping inside , or other reasons that failing would have consequence . 
  [ this great article ] ( http://theangrygm.com/five-simple-rules-for-dating-my-teenaged-skill-system/ ) explains how this works with more examples , and details exactly why it 's a good idea . 
  using the term `` football '' is generally inadvisable , because it can refer to any of half a dozen different football codes . 
  association football , or soccer , is obviously the one mentioned here . 
  but if you 're in america or maybe canada , `` football '' might refer to gridiron . 
  in australia it will usually refer to aussie rules , but can sometimes also refer to rugby league . 
  in new zealand it 's rugby union . 
  in ireland , the term sometimes refers to gaelic football . 
  in certain specific contexts , `` football '' or `` footy '' for short can even be used to refer to the sport properly known as `` touch '' . 
  and feigning ignorance -- you knew perfectly well a what soccer is -- just to make a point about the word you prefer to use is frankly infantile . 
  given all that why * is * it that people think sam was fucked over ? 
  i did n't realise that was even a thing . 
  dazza could be just about any name beginning with da . 
  darryl , for example . 
  same with shazza , really ( with sha ) . 
  yo , if you press `` reply '' under a comment , it replies directly to the person , and they get a notification . 
  but yeah , i know . 
  i fudged a few things for the sake of the story . 
  but we can all agree , fuck druids , right ? 
  after the events i described , even the druid in our party agreed with me when i said fuck druids . 
  \\* shrug *, 
  a few games do this , and it is amazing . 
  a step down is when they assume qwerty , but seem to be interpreting actual keyboard key commands , so that you can play as if you were using qwerty , even while still in dvorak . 
  a * lot * of games seem to do this . 
  the worst is when games make it so that all you can do is strafe left . 
  the problem is that take 10 still leaves a lot of room for failure . 
  it 's a reasonable interpretation for things that can only be tried once , but which they can take as much time preparing as they like : for example , jumping over a ravine when there 's nothing dangerous rushing them . 
  but if they can try again and again without failure having consequence , like continually attempting to knock down a door , or pick the lock , or untie a rope or whatever , then allowing them to `` take 20 '' is essentially as though you allowed them to roll over and over and over again until they pass , but without actually making them go through the motion of rolling . 
  as for the breaking the lock , eh , i think that 's lame . 
  it 's unrealistic , for one thing , most of the time . 
  perhaps some specialty locks for absolutely top-security situations might be designed to do that , but in general , that would cause more problems than it 's worth . 
  i highly suggest reading the article , it explains everything far better than i could .

  if you really insist on doing it with a find and replace function . 
  huh , this is the first time i 've heard of a micronation that 's actually * inside * a major city . 
  i 've always thought of them as being in the middle of the ocean , or out in the bush somewhere . 
  how does this actually work ? 
  like , the people there are still paying australian income tax , gst , etc. , right , and it 's still the queensland firies , cops , and ambulances that would come if you dialed triple zero ? 
  it 's kinda hilarious though , i must say . 
  is there any particular reason it would be a bad idea to go for a ride around the area for a bit of a lark once i 'm done with exams ? 
  oh right , thanks . 
  seriously , it 's amazing . 
  if there were any lingering questions , or you just wanted to see what other people 's thoughts were on it , there are some great discussions in both [ the dndgreentext thread ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) and [ the gametales thread ] ( / r/gametales/comments / 2oicie/stranded _ in_fantasy_xpost_from_rdndgreentext / ) about the story . 
  the author even made a small appearance in the dndgreentext thread to talk about it . 
  i got ta be honest , i felt like the entirety of season 3 of house of cards was filler . 
  i liked the stuff with not-putin , but i have * never * cared for elizabeth or for frank 's assistant as characters : their subplots with the water charity , the photographer , and the prostitute have always felt uninspired and like filler to me . 
  and those were major elements , and they were major characters , in season 3 in a way that they were not in the first two seasons . 
  i sincerely hope that season 4 brings the show to a nice close , hopefully following more in line with the original show 's third season ( though possibly with a different ending -- i can see 3 different ways it might end that would be satisfying , and only one of those is the one used in the original show ) , like the first two seasons of netflix 's show lined up with the first two seasons of the original . 
  they rereleased the game at some point in the source engine . 
  wan na see something else that 's surreal and really old ? 
  [ check out electronic arts ' original mission statement ] ( https://dantevx.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/remembering-electronic-arts-and-what-they-stood-for/ ) . 
  it 's ... a far cry from what we think of them today . 
  it 's still pretty awful in terms of gameplay . 
  particularly : ladders , moving boxes , and jumping off ledges . 
  there are a bunch of micronations that get largely ignored by the real country on which they sit . 
  river hutt , for example . 
  if they 're not causing any real harm , it 's often easiest just to ignore them and let them pretend they really are an independent nation . 
  the problem with the model t ford analogy is that you never see people saying that a model t ford is a car that stands up today . 
  sure , it was fantastic for its time : revolutionary , even . 
  but people claim half life is a game that has stood the test of time , and it really , really has n't . 
  no , [ it actually does use css ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uzx5wox.png ) . 
  it 's inline css rather than including a . css file , but it 's still there , rather than using a bunch of ` style ` attributes ( in fact , the only time the ` style ` attribute was used in the body was with the disclaimer -- guess they did n't think of using a `` disclaimer '' class ) . 
  so really , it 's just made by someone with extremely poor taste in design . 
  i 'm with you on not-putin . 
  he was fantastic . 
  it 's just the stuff with doug and with frank 's wife that i never cared for , and there was so much of that this season . 
  not true !, 
  many of the best and most famous stories in here either definitely never actually happened , or probably did n't happen . 
  for example , [ the author of stranded ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / cobease ) has stated that he wrote it purely as a story . 
  [ demigods ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2k1qjk/demigods _ xpost_gametales / ) is almost certainly either an * extremely * loose account of something that happened , or entirely fake . 
  [ why elves wear masks ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2obymk/why _ the_elves_wear_masks / ) is presented as its author 's thought process while doing some worldbuilding . 
  and i 'm * very * skeptical about [ the ballad of edgardo ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 37d520/the _ ballad_of_edgardo / ) 's veracity . 
  this subreddit is really for any stories that are about tabletop roleplaying games . 
  now , op * did * say they are asking for feedback , and that * is n't * really what the subreddit is about , per se . 
  however , if it had just been presented as a story of how the character decided to take up adventuring , that would undoubtedly have been fine , because it 's a very detailed story . 
  so it 's fine . 
  treatment about what ? 
  i really have no idea what went on between them . 
  sure , all that is true . 
  my point was n't that anyone should treat them as an actual country . 
  but sometimes it just is n't worth the effort of doing what would he necessary to relieve them of their delusions . 
  the vatican is n't a micronation . 
  it 's a true , widely recognised country that just happens to be very small and do very little stuff on the global scale . 
  ( i 'm differentiating between the acts of the pope as head of the catholic church , and the acts the vatican takes as a sovereign nation here . ), 
  nsa level spying is the opposite of `` targeted '' intelligence . 
  seriously , character goals can be completely orthogonal to each other and still get along well enough to keep the party together if they 're roleplayed well .
