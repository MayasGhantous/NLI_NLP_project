  hell , there 's really not even anything stopping an evil character from playing with a mostly good party , or vice versa , as long as the evil is n't chaotic stupid , and the good is n't lawful stupid . 
  you just need to work with the group in general and have some reason to work towards the same general end goal , whatever your personal reason for that may be . 
  you do not have to agree with every single action that every member of the group takes . 
  the person you replied to seems to be trying to imply that they work at the apple store in question . 
  now , whether that 's true or not is something that i am not going to get into . 
  my only point is that , * if * true , that would be the context you are referring to . 
  actually , you know what , i will get into it a little . 
  on the one hand , this account is clearly a throwaway . 
  it has posted once before , and that comment * would * seem to imply that perhaps this person * does * work at an apple store . 
  * on the other hand * , we have at least two top level comments that hit many of the same talking points which seem to be implying that they work at the store . 
  make of that what you will . 
   for example there are movie theaters that will not sell tickets to children in uniform when they should be in class, 
  i find this kinda hilarious . 
  what student is gon na wag , but walk around the city in their school uniform ? 
  an equal null hypothesis could be `` the manager is not racist/did not behave in a racist way '' . 
  sure , it 's * possible * that both these null hypotheses could be true , but they would at least * seem * to be at odds with each other . 
  the all guardsmen are in the [ / r/dndgreentext hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , and for very good reason , in my opinion . 
  but truly , * everything * in the hall of fame is fantastic . 
  there are a bunch of shorter stories that can be read in a few minutes or even a few seconds ( `` an evil campaign gone good '' and `` the medusa '' are stories that really tug at the emotions , and `` sir bearington '' is an absolute classic ) , and they 're great . 
  but for me , the longer stories section is where it 's at . 
  some of them are * exceptionally * long : stranded and demigods , in particular . 
  one would probably want to read them a few pages at a time over the course of a few days . 
  but they are * so * worth it . 
  [ this background story ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 3gvaf8/interesting _ and_unique_flavour_for_the_12_classes / cu25e8s ) for a slightly unconventional warlock character in d&d . 
  that 's seems a pretty reasonable take on it . 
  i might alter it slightly to be that they instead make increasingly difficult con saves ever 12 hours : starting once they 've been awake for 24 hours . 
  first save is dc 10 , each time , the dc goes up by 1 ( or maybe 2 ? ) . 
  every failed save is a point of exhaustion . 
  it 's substantially easier , but it rewards players for putting points into a stat that feels like it should be relevant , and it 's still something the average human would fail half the time at the start . 
  basically , the confusion stems from the case where * nobody * is within 5 feet of you . 
  if you 're a long way away from * everyone * , can you get sneak attack through rakish audacity ? 
  in a strict raw interpretation of the book : yes . 
  if nobody is near you , then `` no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you '' . 
  the `` other than your target '' part becomes redundant , since it is in fact nobody at all . 
  however , the intent was clearly otherwise -- that rakish audacity can only be used in melee one-on-one situations -- and crawford has just made this explicitly clear . 
  most of the podcasts i follow ( and there are a * lot * ) , i listen at between 2.2 x and 2.6 x. 
  it 's weird on the rare occasions i watch them live speaking soooo sssllllooowwwlllyyyy . 
  they do n't even need scripts to do a lot of it . 
  since you 're on their site , they can do a substantial amount server-side . 
   i 've not agreed to pay their salaries , i 've not agreed to view their ads . 
  they have published content on the web , claiming it 's free , but then they are injecting ads without my consent . 
  too had . 
  you 're viewing their content , and the implied contract there is that you 'll load up the ads . 
  not viewing ads on a website costs them in bandwidth , but gives them no opportunity to make revenue . 
  it is n't `` without your consent '' . 
  this is n't an issue of `` consent '' , because you 're visiting * their * site . 
  and the deal is that they give you content in exchange for ads . 
   they are worse than a paywall . 
  no , they very definitively are * not * . 
  ads are democratising . 
  if a site is supported by ads , it 's free . 
  that means anyone can visit it , whether rich or poor . 
  it also means the site is able to * serve * anyone . 
  paywalls are inherently elitist and unfair . 
  you can only visit the site if you can justify spending money to access the site . 
  they also make it nearly impossible for niche sites to exist , because if you ca n't get enough people to decide to pay for your stuff , possibly even site unseen , you 're never going to be able to stay in business . 
  personally , i do n't block ads . 
  but if i did , i would be using an `` acceptable ads '' list like abp has . 
  it 's a morally acceptable way of blocking the really intrusive and terrible ads , while still allowing a good-faith opportunity for sites to make revenue . 
  indiscriminate ad blocking is a shit type thing to do , just as surely as overly distracting ads . 
  ` sudo vim / etc/hosts `, 
  yeah absolutely !, 
  that kind of stuff is fun as hell . 
  we do it all the time in my group , particularly just hashing things out with npcs we 're friendly with and that kind of thing . 
  in my case it 's usually talking with my warlock patron , but plenty of other situations make sense . 
  there 's nothing to fight . 
  if it were n't for the fact that i hope this crosses over with the arrowverse in the future , i 'd think routh would be great . 
  his movie was bland , but that was n't because of his performance . 
  he was a great superman . 
  does the opera house not have the projection equipment set up all the time ? 
  i remember them using projection at the second youtube symphony orchestra back in 2011 . 
  i just figured they use projection for one thing or other often enough that it 's always set up . 
  probably closer to two thirds of the day this time of year , but yeah . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure phandalin is meant to be a few ks south of the triboar trail . 
  so did i , and frankly i was disappointed with what we got . 
  the amount of labelling is almost insultingly low . 
  on the single image you kinda expect that , but i bought it assuming the individual pages of the pdf would have more places labelled . 
  they 're insanely sparse as it is ... 
  my suggestion : go necromancy . 
  you 'll struggle up until level 5 , but once you get there , just use all your spell slots for animate dead . 
  you 'll absolutely * destroy * in the action economy . 
  if you have high enough dex and con , that should help with survivability substantially ( higher hp and ac ) , so maybe you could concentrate on your quarterstaff for damage over the first few levels . 
  you can make greentext by prefixing each line with ''  '' . 
  for more detailed information , you should have a read of [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) . 
  i look at it this way : if op had written the exact same text , but presented it as though it were the first session of a solo campaign , no one would have a problem with it . 
  the only problem , really , is the title . 
  so it 's fine . 
  ignore the title , it 's really not important , anyway . 
  hey , this does n't really fit the type of content that belongs here . 
  it 's not the fact that it 's a comic , per se , so much as it 's a comic that seems to be concentrating on the * players * from a meta perspective , rather than being about the * story * of the game .

  seems like it has good potential , but it is , by their own admission , still alpha level software . 
  it 's probably fine for text chat , but skype has built up a reputation for being * extremely * good in terms of quality and reliability when it comes to video chats . 
  even once it 's out of alpha i doubt it 's going to be able to compete even a little bit with skype when it comes to video . 
  i 'm not sure what it 's 2 days late for , but good morning to you too . 
  the comments of people involved with the this week in tech podcast network . 
  their business involves using video conferencing software quite substantially , and they 've tried a number of them , but generally settle on skype as the programme that works best in terms of quality and flexibility . 
  my own personal experience is a bit more limited : i 've only really used skype and hangouts to any significant level , and i 've found them both to be just fine . 
  the rare times i 've used other video conference programmes i 've generally found them lacking .
