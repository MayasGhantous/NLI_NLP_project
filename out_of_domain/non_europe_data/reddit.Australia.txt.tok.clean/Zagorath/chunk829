  [ this , right ? 
  you ca n't touch type full stops , commas , question marks , quotes , apostrophes , and exclamation marks , at least ? 
  i 'm totally with you on everything between # and & , but the rest of them are common enough to be easy to remember . 
  it 's `` programmer dvorak '' . 
  the letters are all arranged the same as the dvorak keyboard layout , an improvement designed to be both faster and and more ergonomic than qwerty ( which was designed specifically to slow the typist down and avoid quick pairs of keys ) but the symbols are placed to be better for programming , such as by placing the semi-colon in the place that normal dvorak has apostrophe . 
  normal dvorak keeps the same symbols above the numbers as qwerty . 
  personally i 'm not a fan of the programmer dvorak , mainly because of what it does with numbers , so i made my own version for programming .

  the way i 've heard the story in the past is not to do with the flag , but to deny hitler himself the pleasure of the view from the top without having to walk the whole way himself . 
  i 've got ta be honest , i was really disappointed with what i got from that . 
  had i known what it was going to be , i definitely would not have purchased it , and would 've just waited for this to come out . 
  i was expecting the cutout pieces to be labelled in more detail . 
  it 's frankly insane how low the detail is in labelling on the more zoomed in versions . 
  it 's pretty reasonable for the full map of the whole area , because more detail would just be cluttered . 
  but the more zoomed in versions are literally just more zoomed in version of exactly the same thing . 
  the text is stupidly large , and the number of places labelled is seriously lacking . 
  5th edition starts in 1489 dr , so i assume it 's then . 
  thanks for that clarification at the end there , i was thoroughly confused about which part of the sentence was supposed to be ungrammatical . 
  i had the same problem . 
  i consider all options equally correct , and i use all of them pretty much equally . 
  are you sure the comment you 're talking about is n't by you or someone you have in your circles on google + ? 
  because [ i do n't see any comments listing the pieces used ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vr2qqos.png ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure his point is that three 20s in a row and three 1s in a row would be equally remarkable . 
  any other combination of three rolls is mostly unremarkable . 
  p ( 20,20,20 ) = p ( 1,1,1 ) = 1/160 ,000 , so p ( 20,20,20 | 1,1,1 ) = 1/80 ,000 . 
  how is it even possible to rob banks without a gun ? 
  like , was he doing mission impossible style vault break-ins ? 
  i just ca n't imagine how a hold up or more direct robbery would even work ... 
  i 'm aware of the correct formal statistical notation . 
  i was using the pipe to represent `` or '' because that 's the meaning of the symbol in programming , and i did n't have the `` union '' symbol at hand ( edit : incidentally , here it is : \u222a , in case you want to use it ) , but i 'm really not a fan of using the letter `` u '' . 
  the comma also does not represent `` this , then this '' formally . 
  it means `` this * and * this '' , which is not what 's important here . 
  i just used simple symbols that i figured everyone would easily understand in this conversation . 
   why would rolling 3 nat 19 's in a row ( op rolled 4 btw ) be any less remarkable than 3 nat 20 's ? 
  ** just because we decide to make 20 's ** [ sic ] ** important ? 
  ** that 's not how stats works . 
  ( emphasis mine . ), 
  yes , literally because of this . 
  because in d&d , 20 has mechanical significance , and 1 has symbolic significance . 
  both of these are the most extreme cases you can have . 
  the statistics for three 19s in a row are the same as three 20s in a row ; hell , the statistics of getting a 17 , then a 14 , then a 20 ( which is what i rolled just now ) is exactly the same as three 20s , but that 's got no significance whatsoever . 
  20s and 1s are special . 
  edit :, 
   the probability of rolling 4 natural 20 's in a row would be p ( 20 | 20,20,20 ) . 
  uh , no it would n't . 
  at least , not assuming you are using the pipe to represent conditional probability , and commas to represent a sequence of events . 
  p ( 20 | 20,20,20 ) is 1/20 . 
  because p ( x | y , z , w ) = p ( x ) \u2c6f w , x , y , z independent , and dice rolls are independent . 
  the chance of rolling another 20 * given * you 've already rolled three 20s is 1/20 . 
  it feels incredibly unintuitive , but it 's true . 
  now , of course , the chance of rolling four 20s in a row is 1/20 ^ ( 4 ) , which is insanely low , but if you 've already rolled three 20s , it 's exactly the same chance as you have to roll a single 20 on any other one roll . 
  you certainly could do that . 
  the chance of that would be 20/160 ,000 , or 1/8 ,000 . 
  but personally , i would probably not even notice that in a typical game . 
  i * would * notice three 1s or three 20s in a row . 
  eat a lot , but do n't take it as an excuse to eat stupidly . 
  still make sure to eat healthily . 
  just take a larger plate of veggies , eat more fruits , and maybe a bit more protein and iron rich foods . 
  could be worse . 
  could be straight 10s . 
  \\* shrug *, 
  i 've got ta be honest , i actually prefer it to man of steel . 
  routh 's movie was bland , but i actively * despise * man of steel . 
  it felt so wrong as a superman movie . 
  the storytelling was all over the place -- i really did n't think the non-linear narrative style worked in this case , and i normally * love * non-linear stuff . 
  the character was just * bad * -- * why * , please god * why * could n't clark have gone to save the kid or whatever it was , instead of allowing his dad to go and die ? 
  it was utterly stupid and shoehorned in there to have an artificial emotional moment . 
  the music was typical hans zimmer : epic , but ultimately soulless and empty . 
  i will say one thing , the main theme was fantastic for the narrative they were going for . 
  it just never * went * anywhere . 
  even listening to [ the whole of the main theme ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=engkxf3cqh4 ) , it just falls flat shortly after the main themes have been exposed . 
  as great as the theme itself is , it feels like it 's just building and building , but never climaxes . 
  and that 's without even touching on all the god damn destruction porn . 
  i know that 's not the popular opinion in this subreddit , but i goddamn * hate * the movie . 
  in my experience , it 's an incredibly polarising one , with a lot of people who , like me , hate it , but also a lot of people that love it . 
  but pretty much everyone goes `` meh '' to routh 's movie . 
  it 's just bland . 
  yeah i could probably do with a rewatch of it , too . 
  the only things i remember are that i liked routh 's and spacey 's performances , and i liked the music , and that i thought the `` lifting an island of literal kryptonite '' thing was dumb . 
  the rest of the movie i can barely even remember . 
  i 'd guess more people can work in base 2 than in base 6 ( which is what you 're doing if you roll 2d6 to generate a number from 0 to 35 or 1 to 36 ) . 
  i found that on the [ forgotten realms wiki ] ( http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/ ) . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't remember exactly which page it was on . 
  i could n't find any specific dates for out of the abyss . 
  oh damn , this looks amazing !, 
  one thing that bothers me , though ... 
  they do n't seem to have video chat , even for one-on-ones . 
  that 's a pretty huge loss compared to skype . 
  i was all hyped up and about ready to try and get my friends , family , and gaming group to switch from skype , but lacking such a core feature pretty much killed that for me . 
  yeah , that 's pretty much a deal killer for me ... 
  then he dodged a bullet anyway . 
  no , i think they meant what they said . 
  [ the devs have gone on record as saying ] ( / r/discordapp/comments / 3hj8ip/what _ are_the_plans_for_monetization / ) that their plan for monetisation is through cosmetics . 
  they 'll sell features like voice packs , themes , stickers , etc. 
  i believe the person you replied to was referring to this . 
  video chat is an absolute must-have feature for me . 
  i simply can not start using this until it has it . 
  which is a shame , because it looks so good otherwise , but it 's lacking such a basic obvious feature ...
