  i agree completely , looking up a composer 's wikipedia article is a great way to learn more about them . 
  ( also looking up the history behind specific pieces that you 're listening to . ), 
  brilliant , detailed description of bach . 
  but i especially love your summary of the rules of counterpoint . 
  also , i ca n't believe i forgot bach 's cello suite in my recommended listening !, 
  it 's an amazing work . 
  word of god ? 
  i 'm going to regret this . 
  he had at least great great grandchildren , from * ludwig albrecht hermann ritter * and * carolina augusta wilhelmine bach * . 
  you may have heard that because his * name * did n't survive him . 
  at least according to the family tree on [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bach_family ) , the only two lines that continue end with female bachs ( the other being anna philippiana friederica bach with wilhelm ernst colson , the generation previous ) . 
  i thought he sent an order to close guantanamo but it was stopped ? 
  haha definitely . 
  i mean , a bunch of his children were famous in their own right , but definitely living under the shadow of the greatest ever must be ... odd . 
  bach also performed . 
  yeah , i knew that . 
  whoops . 
  haha , i love a good xkcd reference , but sadly no . 
  oh , right . 
  nono , i assume you 're referring to where he said `` improvisation ... in 4 or more voices '' . 
  in this context , the term voices is used to refer to separate melodic lines played on a keyboard instrument ( or , if you had say , a flute part shared between the first and second flute , that could also be two `` voices '' on one staff ) . 
  complex fugues can often have 4 voices , usually referred to in the same way as vocal parts ( soprano , alto , tenor , and bass ) , though it 's very rare to have more than that . 
  as an example , [ this image ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:bachfuguebar.png ) has four voices . 
  a simple harmony and melody ( take mozart 's piano sonata in c ) is two voices . 
  [ this image here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:wiki-fugue-analysis.jpg ) has three voices . 
  i 've never heard of either of those , but who are the other ones if you include bohemia ? 
  # 5 a month ... free music, 
  i assume you meant unlimited ? 
  wait , rock and roll does n't cause satanism ? 
  believe it or not that kind of thing is actually a thing . 
  they 're called [ micronations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micronation ) , and very few real countries actually recognise them as sovereign . 
  oh wow , i 'm pretty sure i 've heard vltava somewhere before . 
  that really is an amazing piece of music !, 
  i 'm going to have to look into smetana some more !, 
  thanks !, 
  hey man , i know heaps of people who are half-half with different races , and they tend to be the awesomest people . 
  my biggest gripe with this is the effect of the water does n't look convincing . 
  the way it wraps around at the back is like just a coupla small water droplets . 
  brilliant cosplay otherwise . 
  what i gather from a taiwanese friend of mine is that there are different parties which want different things . 
  some take the stance that they are the true china ( roc ) , whereas some would rather be known officially as taiwan ( a sort of compromise deal ) . 
  there is even a small amount of people who want to be a part of mainland china . 
  ah , i love the piano guys !, 
  it 's only a shame he ca n't actually play 8 cellos at once , because it 'd be brilliant to see it in a live-style performance . 
  got ta admit , that guy was a complete prick , but i 'm also a bit confused . 
  what does australia have to do with scotland leaving the uk ? 
  are you just referencing the fact that we still have to put up with the queen , or is it something else ? 
  as an 18 year old i can tell you the difference between now and two years ago is huge . 
  i suspect another 2 years will have at least as much a difference , but in short , * yes * , 18 year olds are a lot more rational than 16 year olds . 
  just fyi , i 'm australian , so phrases like, 
   thus we will have a different monarch to yours, 
  and, 
   i do n't know why you, 
  are n't quite correct . 
  other than that little nitpicking , thanks for all that detail . 
  i do n't know nearly enough about australian history . 
  the thing is , whatever age you pick is going to be arbitrary . 
  i do n't know scotland law specifically , but in most places 18 is the age where you can go to gaol ( although exceptions are usually made for really serious crimes committed by minors ) and drink , as well as being the age at which you do not legally require a guardian . 
  it 's considered the ( however arbitrary ) age of adulthood . 
  for that reason , and that reason alone , why would it not also be the age at which you can vote ? 
  i say only those over 65 can vote . 
  not quite . 
  `` sent from my ipad '' is the default signature from the mail app . 
  you can remove it manually on a per-message basis , or change your signature completely if you do n't want it . 
   weak to say `` oh , at 16 you can do xyz therefore you should be able to vote '', 
  i do n't think so at all . 
  the age for those things was chosen for a reason , so while it does n't necessarily mean that should be the age for all things , it does make sense if it is . 
   which is why you think that we automatically have the same monarch as the united kingdom, 
  way to be a douche . 
  nowhere did i say or imply that we have and will always have the same monarch as the uk , i simply said that we currently have to put up with the queen . 
  i said i do n't know as much as i would like about australian history , but it just so happens that this was one thing i * did * know . 
  in practice we will almost certainly keep the same monarch as them until we decide to become a republic , but of course in theory either us or they could change the rules of succession , the most likely change being that firstborn becomes the next monarch , not just firstborn son . 
  i think it was in a cgpgrey video , but i do n't know if that 's where i 've heard it . 
  i was talking about the `` you '' part of that , because the phrase that i was quoting was assuming i was british , as he was using `` we '' to refer to himself and other australians , and `` you '' to refer to me and british ( or specifically english ) citizens . 
  sorry for the misunderstanding . 
  dibs on beethoven . 
  i will edit this post when i 'm done writing it out . 
  i just picked the first main ones that came to mind , definitely shostakovich deserves a mention too . 
  what i meant was basically that i 'm not talking about the really eccentric later 20th century composers like cage , shoenberg ( though i 'd say i quite like his music compared to the others in this list ) , berg , and webern . 
  i could also add copland , britten , holst , ravel ( the latter two could arguably be romantic , though ) , and a host of others . 
  i 'm going to take beethoven , since he 's the composer i 'm most familiar with . 
  you 're most often going to hear his symphonies and piano sonatas , so i 'll focus on his style with them , but most of this could also be applied to his concertos , string quartets , and other pieces ( such as trios ) as well . 
  i 've created a pdf document , as well as exported the audio from it as a . wav file ( if you want another format just ask , i can do mp3 or aiff ) . 
  the pdf is labelled with the extract numbers that i 've referenced below . 
  [ ** here 's a link to the public dropbox folder ** ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/sh/40f1y42ib3ja2oj/yiuj1wscxk/beethoven ) with the pdf , audio , and the sibelius file i got both the others from . 
  ( a note incase anyone comes across this further in the future , i probably wo n't have the dropbox folder accessible forever , but if you come across it and want to see the files just pm me and i 'll arrange something . ), 
  the most obvious thing is beethoven 's use of tritones and diminished 7ths . 
  perhaps the most obvious example is [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz7usuepwsc ) , at the very beginning of the third movement of his `` appassionata '' piano sonata ( let me just take this moment to say lisitsa is absolutely not my favourite pianist , i do n't think her interpretations are much good at all , but her version is technically high quality , good audio and video , and was easy to find on youtube ) . 
  you can also take a look at extract ** 1 ** from the sample score , the notes bb , db , e , and g are used . 
  these notes make up a diminished 7th chord ( basically it 's a series of minor third intervals ) , with a distinctive dissonant ( clashing ) sound . 
  other examples include the mainly very light sounding first movement of sonata no. 10 , right before the end of the exposition , or 3:18 in [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw-smu22ems ) . 
  it 's even more prominent in the [ second movement ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7s63imwa3u&amp;feature=relmfu ) , happening all over the place , but extract ** 2b ** probably shows it better than anywhere else . 
  beethoven frequently uses these strong dissonances in very light and innocent ways , which is a key part of his style . 
  looking at his symphonic works , see bar 7 of the symphony no. 3 ( the third bar of extract ** 4 ** ) , between the c # in the cello and g in the violin . 
  i think that the way beethoven uses this dissonance is absolutely brilliant . 
  sure , you get * more * dissonance if you go later into the romantic period or into the 20th century with composers like shostakovich and stravinsky ( there 's a recurring theme in the rite of spring which , if you transcribe it for piano , is almost just slamming your hand down on the keys rhythmically ) , but the exact way beethoven uses very careful tritones and diminished sevenths in combination with the more consonant harmonies is second to none , in my opinion . 
  although beethoven has a lot of heavy , serious pieces , but there 's also a lovely selection of much lighter pieces . 
  the thing about beethoven , though , is that he clearly had some sort of inner turmoil , and even these light pieces have heavier , darker , moments . 
  take the famous f\u00fcr elise , the `` c '' section ( extract ** 3 ** ) , which is really sinister when compared to the lovely light famous melody of the main tune . 
  the cheerful 5th movement of symphony no. 6 also has slightly darker moments , such as at 7:07 in [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg67okrj0us ) , poorly transcribed as extract ** 5 ** .
