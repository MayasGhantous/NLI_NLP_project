  i do n't root because i do n't see the benefit . 
  there really are n't any features for which i feel it 's worth going to the effort . 
   only downside is that now the ` home ' screen never loads , but ... not really that important, 
  honestly i consider that an upside . 
  the home screen was so slow and bloated , and really provided no benefit , at least to me . 
  all it was was a page that slowed me down from getting to chats . 
  the same place as where it is on non mac keyboards . 
  shift-3 . 
  at least if you 're using the us qwerty layout or standard dvorak . 
  oh shit , it was a fucking * dog * ? 
  urgh ... wtf superman ... 
  but yeah , it was a particularly awful scene . 
  everything wrong with made a point of calling it out , too . 
  turns out a metronome helps you to work at speed with both dvorak and dvo\u0159\u00e1k !, 
  yeah i totally agree . 
  to use a similar example : in the elminster books , the language surrounding the usage of spells shows that the characters * very * clearly understand exactly how full vancian magic works ( with the specific spells filling each specific slot ) . 
  they do n't use the exact words `` vancian '' or `` spell slot '' , but clearly the characters know the mechanics . 
  no reason player characters would n't be the same . 
  they understand that a rest of about an hour helps them to regain their abilities . 
  no it is not . 
  that guy 's from the uk ... so of course the location he quoted is on the uk keyboard layout . 
  but the standard is shift 3 . 
  of the 4 keyboard layouts i have installed on my mac at the moment , 3 have shift-3 mapped to # . 
  the only one that * does n't * is my own custom variant of dvorak for programming ( which , incidentally , has * mapped to where 3 would normally be , and shift-3 gives 3 ) . 
  incidentally , i tried a bunch of other layouts , too , just to have a look . 
  it certainly is n't universal , but in addition to us and dvorak , i found : canadian , australian , spanish , norwegian , all forms of japanese , korean , vietnamese telex , a type of `` devanagiri '' ( under hindi ) , and both traditional and simplified chinese pinyin . 
  the places that * did n't * use shift-3 were ones like arabic , with a huge range of characters that needed to be represented , and a few european countries . 
  certainly more the exception than the rule . 
  and most of those used option-shift-3 for # anyway , * not * option-3 by itself . 
  it would be quite simple . 
  you would roll 3 dice , and use the middle result . 
  generally , the best place to start is by reading the handbook . 
  it quite clearly answers this question in the section where it introduces advantage and disadvantage . 
  they actually ca n't tell . 
  they can easily tell that you 're visiting a lot of pages on reddit , but since reddit implemented https , they ca n't actually see which pages you visit . 
  no , it 's because * other * people misinterpreted what he was saying . 
  his maths is spot on . 
  my best guess is that they 're referencing the fact that on his show tabletop , it 's a bit of a running joke that wheaton always does * really * badly . 
  gets terrible rolls etc. 
  hey , since i noticed you 're also the dev of the rollme bot , i 'm wondering : is there a public api or something like that which the bot uses ? 
  i reckon it 'd be really fun to play around with a little . 
  sorry for going off topic , just curious . 
  it was a link to a nsfw subreddit . 
  it 's a ... weird ... place . 
  that 's correct . 
  about a month or so ago , i think . 
  ubuntu does the same thing , but they have an extra nice little feature . 
  when you hold down the windows key ( because that 's what it 's mapped to on a standard keyboard designed for use with windows -- i dunno what the official name for it on ubuntu is ) the icons fade out slightly , and a number appears on top of them indicating which one it is . 
  because i know on windows , i rarely use this shortcut for anything higher than about win-3 , because it 's too much effort to count past that . 
  showing the number is such a useful little feature . 
  huh ... 
  i 'm not really sure why it went down this time . 
  i * think * my computer may have gone onto standby , possibly ? 
  it 's back up now . 
  there are a few factors at play there . 
  one is that if it 's same day , it may simply have been too late for them to change . 
  however , probably more significantly , as crass , ignorant , and unfair as it may sound , people in general do n't care nearly as much about stuff that happens in africa and the middle east as they do when it 's europe or north america . 
  not saying that that 's * right * , but that 's how it is . 
  you can make greentext by prefixing each line with ''  '' . 
  for more detailed information , you should have a read of [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) . 
  this post is clearly written as though it 's greentext , but is n't formatted correctly as such . 
  you apply , but it 's like a two click process . 
  some time earlier ( ca n't remember exactly , but i think it 's between 30 and 60 thousand karma ) you should get an automatic invite to / r/top , which is the `` top 1 % '' . 
  i would never have known cc was a thing if it were n't for people mentioning it in r/top . 
  and i would n't have known r/top was a thing we 're it not for the automatic invite . 
  you 're not the one he was talking about . 
  he 's talking about the libertarian dude you replied to . 
   micro nations, 
  i do not think that word means what you think it means . 
   as soon as one country closes a loop hole , another small island state will open a loop hole to attract large corporations, 
  which is why we need to close the loopholes * here * that allow them to do it . 
  we should be aiming our ire at * our own government * , not at companies like ikea and apple . 
  they are doing exactly what they * should * be doing , which is maximising profits without breaking any laws . 
  that is what * every * business is * supposed * to do , and they should not be criticised for it . 
  instead , we need to make it so that in order to minimise the amount of tax they pay , they would have to be * breaking * the law , i.e. , we need to close the loopholes and * make * them pay more tax . 
  asking a business to pay more tax than it is legally required to is just as stupid as if you were to ask an individual to voluntarily give up more tax . 
  seriously ... it was already the top post on the subreddit 7 hours before this was submitted . 
  i do n't think he * has * a real name . 
  he 's just dr. who , and he 'll never be any thing more than that . 
  that is , the organisation which conducted these surveys , `` ifop '' , is the french institute of public opinion . 
  the surveys were conducted `` sur l\u2019ensemble du territoire fran\u00e7ais d\u00e9sormais lib\u00e9r\u00e9 '' , or `` over the whole of the newly freed french territories '' . 
  yeah definitely . 
  that second one , it 's more likely that they 'll look back and think `` wow , how far we have come since then '' , or maybe even `` wow , i never thought that 's how things would have been done '' . 
  i recall a few years ago them officially changing so that they do n't even * call * themselves communist anymore . 
  it 's amazing how many times people need to explain how surprise works . 
  and people still ca n't figure it out . 
  with what ? 
  my group plays with the rule `` you can only level up during a long rest '' . 
  but we also use narrative levelling , rather than counting xp . 
  working out how much xp to give in non-combat situations is too annoying , and levelling takes way too long if you actually count xp anyway . 
  the racial hiding , warlock spells , quickened spells , surprise rounds , backgrounds , and bonus action dashes are all incredibly unambiguously clear if one actually reads the rules . 
  but many people apparently do n't bother with that , as exemplified by the fact that these questions come up time and time again , and we often get even more basic questions posted to this subreddit . 
  many of the others in this sage advice are also fairly obvious and intuitive , like extra attack and shield attacks . 
  but at least these ones are not explicitly spelled out in the book , so it 's nice to have a definitive answer given . 
  how so ? 
  grappling is * extremely * easy , quick , and intuitive in this edition . 
  it 's ridiculous , but it 's also been covered so many times already that i do n't see why they needed to do it again . 
  not true . 
  unarmed strikes are listed as `` simple melee weapons '' in the weapons table in chapter 5 , so anyone who gets proficiency with all simple weapons is proficient with unarmed strikes . 
  but not everyone gets that .
