  contrary to what / u/egamma claims , nowhere in chapter 9 does it say everyone is proficient with unarmed strikes . 
  all it says is :, 
   when you are ** unarmed ** , you can fight in melee by making an unarmed strike , as shown in the weapon table in chapter 5 . 
  oh , when you said `` second edition player 's handbook '' , i thought you were referring to 2e ad&d . if you meant the second printing , you should have said that . 
  i apparently have a first printing copy , so i did n't know this . 
  yeah cheers . 
  / u/hasire pointed this out , and i 've now printed a copy of the errata and popped it in my phb . 
  i can hardly even tell the difference between the two of them . 
  they 're both just saying fiji ... 
  sounds completely normal . 
  you do n't watch youtube ? 
  how the hell did you come to listen to hi ? 
  `` hey , excuse me ? 
  could we get some more bread please ? '', 
  you do n't have to address them with any particular title . 
  yeah , the first time i came across the notion of subvocalisation , or more specifically , the notion that other people * do n't * do it , was regarding speed reading a few years ago . 
  it just seems so weird to me . 
  i subvocalise , and i definitely agree with grey that it makes me feel like i read really slowly . 
  i actually * do * slightly put on voices when i read , at least when i 'm reading novels . 
  it rarely happens to me with reddit comments until * after * i 've seen someone suggest that . 
  putting on voices slows me down even more , though , which is a pain ... 
  his normal voice , or his tyrion voice ? 
  quite a difference there . 
  but that 's phi not phee ... 
  [ here are the comments from last time this was shared , if anyone wants to see them . 
  ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21oop6/krod _ the_halforc_rogue / ), 
  cisco wo n't meet supergirl until at * least * next season , if not later . 
  she 's getting her feet now , but by the time she meets cisco , if that ever happens , she 'll have well and truly found them . 
  yeah , this , and also the way community did it with subway and later honda were some fantastic ways of naturally integrating it into the plot . 
  but he said * he * wants to be quieter , not * other * people want him to be quieter . 
  yeah i agree . 
  playing a dog-like human is a little out there , but sure . 
  playing a dog is straight out nope . 
  cool username , btw . 
   oh , i figured it was just a sly move on your part to keep people thinking we were all `` really close '' to a goal . 
  that 's exactly what it is , just that the system is designed to do that , the petition creator does n't manage it themselves . 
  did you know that 1 +2 +3 +4 + ... , if you keep going and take the sum of all positive integers ( the sum , mind you , * not * the limit of the series ) , the result is -1 / 12 ? 
  edit : why the downvotes ? 
  [ it 's true ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-i6xtvzxww ) . 
  the parent comment asked for an example of the beauty of maths , and this definitely qualifies . 
  dice roller \u00e0 la the rollme but on reddit . 
  [ [ 6d6d1 ] ], 
  + / u/rollme, 
  you should probably edit the sidebar in / r/slygifs to point here . 
  nope , it 's running at the moment . 
  it should check roughly every minute or so , unless it encounters an error ( for example , if reddit goes down briefly ) , in which case it waits 15 minutes before trying again . 
  it last encountered an error at 18:07:00 utc +10 , so it was waiting until 6:22 before paging . 
  yeah , reddit uses a variant of a markup language called `` markdown '' for its syntax . 
  you can see more [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6ewgt/reddit_markdown_primer_or_how_do_you_do_all_that/c03nik6 ) . 
   the nexus 6p ... costs less to buy the top end 128gb model than it costs to buy the entry level 16gb 6, 
  that 's not quite true , but it 's so frighteningly close to true that it 's frankly astonishing . 
  and the 6p has already been noted as being overly expensive compared to previous nexus models . 
  oh god , i can just physically feel the awkwardness over that purchase . 
  [ no , it really is . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-i6xtvzxww ) . 
  it 's actually a result that is essential in string theory . 
  how do you get it to work ? 
   and up next we have the * smooth sultry tones * of myke hurley and brad dowdy on the pen addict . 
  the rollme bot is a really advanced die rolling bot that you can invoke on reddit . 
  i believe it taps in to roll20 to work its magic . 
  aside from doing the really obvious basic stuff like rolling simple dice like 2d6 , 6d8 , or dice with a modifier like 1d20 +4 , it can also do slightly more complex but still fundamental things like combining dice rolls such as 1d20 +1 d4 +4 . 
  but that 's the obvious basic dice stuff . 
  what makes rollme really cool is the much more advanced functionality such as rolling a bunch of dice , then dropping the lowest one , and then comparing that to a target value . 
  on reddit , it works by putting a pair of square brackets around each call and then ending the comment by naming the bot . 
  i think the equivalent on roll20 is just '' / roll '' . 
  some samples of how it works :, 
  [ [ 2d6 ] ] [ [ 6d8 ] ] [ [ 1d20 +4 ] ], 
  [ [ 1d20 +1 d4 +4 ] ], 
  [ [ 4d6d1  12 ] ], 
  + / u/rollme, 
  okay weird little request that i feel is really quite minor in terms of its scale , but is mildly infuriating to actually look at : the date format . 
  it should give the option to display dates in the correct date format . 
  the ability obviously already exists , since if you change from english to a european language option , it displays dates in a logical format . 
  but when you 're in english , you can only see it display with a nonsensical month-date-year format . 
  hmm , that 's a really good point , actually . 
  so , how is it that this technique of shifting over by one is valid in some cases , but not in others ? 
  no , i think both the 6p and 5x are too expensive for nexus devices . 
  back when i bought my nexus 4 it was $ 420 . 
  the cheapest 5x starts at $ 660 , which is crazy . 
  [ if i could get it anywhere near that cheap , i would . 
  but i ca n't , otherwise i would n't have been complaining . 
  / u/jeffdujon might like to see this . 
  and / u/mindofmetalandwheels too , i guess . 
  that has `` 0 '' under the vulnerabilities for piercing . 
  now , it 's a bit of a weird situation , but surely the rakshasa 's vulnerability to piercing damage dealt by a magical weapon wielded by a good creature should count here ? 
  that 's not really relevant to op 's question , but i just thought it was worth asking . 
  the question, 
   how would you describe your dvorak usage ? 
  was poorly designed . 
  the given answers really fit better with two separate questions . 
  to what degree do you use dvorak versus other keyboard layouts ? 
  how proficient are you with dvorak ? 
  and because people can only choose one answer , you 're going to be split between people who chose to answer one of those versus the other . 
  for example , someone might be `` exclusive '' and `` advanced '' , or might use dvorak `` equal with colemak '' and be `` intermediate '' at dvorak . 
  but they have to pick * which * of the pair they choose to identify most with to answer the question . 
  actually , because of the way eldritch blast scales ( it becomes multiple separate attack beams , instead of being a single attack that gets stronger like the other basic attack cantrips ) , if a dragon sorcerer could choose an ancestry that gave them a boost to force with elemental affinity at level 6 , that would be a huge boon , since they 'd be doing 2d10 +2 cha when they hit , scaling to 3d10 +3 cha etc. 
  of course , it 's a moot point , since they * ca n't * get bonuses to cha . 
   blasts and bursts : the jargon wotc invented for powers was fantastic once you got to know it . 
  it feels like a step backward to go back to talking about radii and cones . 
  oh god yes . 
  i think wizards could have chosen better names for them -- starting with the same letter is * never * a good idea for concepts that are so close together , it only increases confusion -- but the concept was great .
