  4e combat definitely dragged , but really , * any * combat can drag if players and the dm are n't * extremely * attentive at all times , and planning their moves in advance ( not to mention that they know the details of all spells and abilities that they can have ) . 
  and even then , the move of whoever goes right before you can do something that might mess up what you had planned . 
  basically , point is , it 's easy for stuff to slow down enough that one can have time to get bored and build a tower . 
  fully agreed . 
  apart from a few google apps , my only extensions are res , lastpass , and the great suspender . 
  simply by keeping the number of extensions to very few that can be trusted , the potential risk is basically zeroed . 
  i agree with you , but you have to admit it 's an opinion thing . 
  while you and i might love the reboots , it 's perfectly alright for someone to dislike them compared to the originals . 
  present, 
  oh god , this is amazing . 
  [ here 's a link to a pdf ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0byjhrwzi6znorfq4aklrlxpdudg/view?usp=sharing ) . 
  this is a 5e conversion of a race from the 4e book `` heroes of shadow '' . 
  vrylokas are humans that underwent some sort of ritual to gain greater lifespan , and they are essentially living vampires . 
  i built this race with / u/the _ singular_anyone 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3qnv6q/vampire _ prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big / ) in mind . 
  in particular the small blood point pool is meant to merge with that class 's pool . 
  the quote is from serana in skyrim 's dawnguard expansion , because i kinda view the vryloka as similar to the vampire lords in skyrim , as compared to the `` baser '' vampires . 
  they 're not exactly the same thing , but i view them as thematically similar . 
  i estimate this race as about a +6.5 in [ this race balance guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  huge thanks to / u/sakilla07 for help with a couple of the features , and especially for enormous help with formatting . 
  the last version was meant to be the last , but i received far more feedback than i expected . 
  i 've made lifeblood a short rest feature , and regain con + lvl instead of con +1 d4 thp . 
  i also added stealth proficiency . 
  barring any major typos or other mistakes , this is the finalised version .

  yeah , i did . 
  they 're among my most recent `` submitted '' history . 
  but i do n't mind too much if you treat familiar ground . 
  to be fair , not top many people even know of the * existence * of the dvorak simplified keyboard , let alone its exact layout . 
  if you 're interested , i think someone posted a dhampir homebrew on / r/unearthedarcana fairly recently . 
  yeah it 's a bit of a weird wording . 
  for the most part i 'm just lifting stuff from the heroes of shadow book though , so i 'm afraid i do n't have a great explanation for you . 
  the `` you can choose whether stuff affects you like an undead or as a living creature '' thing is directly from hos , and so is the `` vitality of vampires without the taint of undeath '' , the two of which are obviously at odds with one another . 
  my best guess is that it 's without subjugating them * fully * to the taint of undeath . 
  as for why not become a vampire , 4e race descriptions did this cool thing where they 'd pick out a few classes that can work well with the race , and give some lore explanations for why a member of the race might take up that class . 
  the vryloka entry mentioned the vampire class from the same book . 
  it basically said that vrylokas look down on those that fully embrace undeath and become like the `` baser '' vampires , and vryloka who do so are exiled from their clans . 
  unfortunately i could n't find a good way to put that sort of information in the 5e race structure . 
  i like this idea . 
  a lot of subreddits have weekly question threads , and i think something like that could be really helpful to new users here . 
  or even more experienced users who ran into something odd . 
  thus is one of my favourite little classical facts to quote . 
  it 's also why i get a little annoyed when even fans of classical music place beethoven in the `` classical '' era , when he so clearly belongs in both the classical and romantic eras or , if you * had * to pick one , it would clearly be romantic . 
  it was his * third * symphony for god 's sake !, 
  the vast majority of his most well known works came * after * the piece some label the first piece of the romantic era . 
  n.b. , it is n't actually elitist !, 
  the name is meant to be ironic . 
  my money is on the martian manhunter theory for the moment . 
  it certainly seems to be the most popular theory in the post-episode discussion threads , and it would be awesome to see the character on screen . 
   2 ) preschools would like to have both male and female teachers . 
   this should result in men getting higher pay for the same job . 
  this is an interesting point . 
  and it makes me wonder : do women in the tech industry make more than their male counterparts , because they are undoubtedly lower in supply . 
  my suspicion is no , but i could be wrong . 
  haha damn that 's quite an improvement . 
  i only went from about 80 to 110 or so . 
  though , speaking of command line , ` ls - l ` is just about the worst possible thing to type in dvorak ... 
  divination wizard 's 6th level ability :, 
   ## expert divination, 
   beginning at 6th level , casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts . 
  when you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot , you regain one expended spell slot . 
  the slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and ca n't be higher than 5th level . 
  that 's true , but the same is true of all the existing divination spells . 
  and really , all adding augury to the spell list would do is mean that they can cast augury as many times as they want . 
  it still costs a spell slot to cast , they just then immediately get ~ ~ that ~ ~ slot back , so it 's a net ~ ~ zero ~ ~ expenditure of slots ( see edit ) . 
  and with augury already cumulatively getting less reliable as it gets cast on the same day , i do n't think this would be an issue . 
  edit : in fact , they do n't even get * that * slot back . 
  they would regain a 1st level slot in exchange for a 2nd level one . 
  so it 's a net loss . 
  i would suggest that if you 're not playing in the sword coast , the scag is probably not a worthwhile purchase . 
  there 's only a tiny amount of new player material in it compared to the amount of sc lore . 
  that said , if you 're building your own world , having something like that can be great for getting inspiration for bits and pieces , even if you do n't use it exactly as it is presented in the book . 
  that 's a big part of the reason i bought the book . 
  the fact that the matts are so thick makes me think it 's just to get them up higher for a better framed shot . 
  but honestly i 'm not really sure what it 's about . 
  [ i made up this set of tables ] ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m38-n7l1a5xtmzar_qppfen0dtiycib_1ywkxo6j6bi/edit?usp=sharing ) for randomly rolling up races and subraces using all the official races available for 5e ( but not unearthed arcana races ) , if anyone wants to use it . 
  i think points 1 and 2 can easily be explained . 
  he could simply be trying to keep it secret from everyone , and might not have told even superman yet . 
  point 3 is a little harder to explain , partly because i 'm not * entirely * sure what you 're trying to say . 
  he may have threatened kara 's adopted parents because in this iteration , * whoever * he is , he 's clearly a bit of a dick . 
  but i do agree that the degree of dickishness would feel wrong if they do n't have further development to explain it , if he does turn out to be j'onn j'onzz . 
  the `` i work from superman '' aspect of point 3 can be explained with the same reasoning as points 1 and 2 . 
  edit : i wrote this before your edit to extend point 3 and add in the final paragraph , but most of it still stands . 
  i 'm still not exactly sure what point 3 is meant to be . 
  as for the final paragraph , yeah , maybe , but i 'm holding out hope that we 'll get to see j'onn j'onzz , partly for the same reasons as / u/samsabear , and partly because i would * love * to see m'gann m'orzz introduced . 
  she was my absolute favourite character on young justice , and with this show 's `` girl power '' aspect , i can easily see her being introduced not too long after j'onzz is , if he ever is . 
  edit the second : my first edit was written before your second edit which removed some stuff . 
  i do n't know what still applies or not any more . 
  well i 'm glad you 've got no horse in the race .
