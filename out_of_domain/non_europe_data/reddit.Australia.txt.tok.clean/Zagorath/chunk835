  that would be entirely the wrong subreddit . 
  this place is for foot running races !, 
  aasimar and the eladrin elven subrace are both in the dmg . 
  the ones named by / u/hamenopi are literally the only other adventures wizards has published for 5e so far . 
  your best bet is probably to homebrew something from scratch now . 
  oh , sorry , what i meant was `` is bogi the name of the performer '' ? 
  i 'm wondering what the `` bogi '' in the title is referring to . 
  my phone did n't register it as bogi , it wrote it out in korean . 
  i just did n't have a korean keyboard installed , so i wrote a transliterated version in the roman alphabet instead . 
  ( i can read korean , but ca n't speak it well enough to know what the word actually means . ), 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  the problem with this theory is that , as / u/kjeff23 says , it would be difficult to walk on , and might not always offer consistent height . 
  solid platforms would be far more practical . 
  but in defence of this theory , solid platforms tend to be hollow , and would therefore make a * lot * of noise , which could be problematic for shooting . 
  the mats would at least muffle that noise . 
  so there are arguments either way ... 
  if you live in a big city in america or canada , local gaming stores often run games . 
  alternatively , you can potentially use such stores to help look for players at a home game . 
  unfortunately , outside of those countries , gaming culture in such a public way does n't really exist . 
  failing that , online solutions like roll20 are great . 
  that 's a * very * generous guide for clarinet . 
  yes , a good clarinetist can reach a written d7 ( that 's concert [ c7 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/common_octave_naming_systems.png ) ) , but even for a professional clarinetist you would want to avoid that range except for a deliberately extreme sound , generally wanting to get up there and * end * up there , rather than playing full melodies in that range ( think , the end of the copland concerto ) . 
  the top of your normal range would probably be written g6 . 
  an advanced amateur should be comfortable going to that range . 
  oh no , i know you knew what it was . 
  i just wanted to make sure anyone who sees your comment wo n't be put off by the name !, 
  the ib diploma programme has ** you do 6 subjects ** ( plus the `` core '' , which i 'll get to in a moment ) . 
  you can one subject from each of the 6 groups . 
  group 1 is language and literature . 
  as an english speaker , you 'll probably take either english language a1 or english language and literature a1, 
  group 2 is second languages . 
  you take a language that you are not already a native speaker in . 
  for example , spanish or french , if you 're an english speaker . 
  if you 've already had * some * experience with it , you take language b ( e.g. 
  french b ) , if you 've never learnt it before , you would do `` ab initio '' . 
  group 3 is social sciences . 
  things like history , economics , and geography go here . 
  group 4 is sciences . 
  mainly biology , chemistry , and physics , but design technology and computer science are also in this group . 
  group 5 is maths . 
  group 6 is `` arts and electives '' . 
  you can do either an art ( music , drama , art , film , etc. ), 
  or you can take an elective by doing a second subject from any of the former groups . 
  you usually do 3 ** hl subjects ** and 3 ** sl ** . 
  some students do 4 hl and 2 sl . 
  hl is `` higher level '' , and it 's subjects that are being taken to a much higher degree . 
  sl , or `` standard level '' subjects are substantially less difficult . 
  typically , you 'll take hl in subjects that relate to what you want to study at university , if you know what that is . 
  otherwise , picking subjects that you like and/or are good at to be your hl subjects is a good idea . 
  also worth taking into consideration is that some subjects are known to have a bigger step up with hl than others . 
  this can mean it 's a lot harder and might not be worth the effort , but it can also mean you get a lot more out of the course , and that it 's more respected by higher institutions . 
  maths is the prime example of this . 
  each subject is worth up to 7 points , the higher your score , the better . 
  nearly every course has some component of '' ** ia ** '' or `` internal assessment '' . 
  these are assignments that are marked by your teacher , before a sample of them are sent away to the ibo to be moderated . 
  there 's also nearly always an examination component to them ( i * think * art is the only exception to this ) , taken at the end of your final year , probably in may . 
  each subject has certain ** papers ** , and these are of the same type each year . 
  for example , ( and i may be wrong about this , because it has been a * long * time since i did my exams : my memory may be faded , or it may have changed in the interrum ) science subjects are all paper 1 : multiple choice , paper 2 : written answers on most of the course , paper 3 : written answers on the option topics . 
  maths has one paper with a calculator and one without . 
  then there 's the `` core '' . 
  everyone has to do these . 
  theory of knowledge ( ** tok ** ) , which is a sort of introduction to a particular area of philosophy . 
  it aims to help explain how it is that we know what we know . 
  it 's got the potentially to be an incredibly interesting and insightful class , or a horrible bore , depending on your personality , the attitude of your classmates , and the quality of the teacher you get . 
  the assessment for this is one presentation and one essay , though if you get a teacher that 's even halfway good , you 'll get multiple chances at the presentation , and they 'll count your best one . 
  the extended essay ( ** ee ** ) , a 4,000 word research paper into an area of your personal interest . 
  usually you 'll do this in one of the subjects you 're taking , but some students use it as an opportunity to delve in to a subject that they could n't take properly ( my sister , for example , is studying geography , but doing her ee on the black plague , as a history ee ) . 
  creativity , action , service ( ** cas ** ) . 
  basically , mandatory extra curriculas . 
  you have to do some creative things outside of class ( play a musical instrument , make amateur films , blog , whatever ) , take part in some physical activity ( organised sports , hiking , etc. 
  are usual ) , and do some community service ( help out at charity events and such ) . 
  you have to do these consistently throughout the two years of the ibdp , and give `` reflections '' on them . 
  tok and the ee are worth a combined total of 3 extra points , based on [ this matrix ] ( http://chc.wrdsb.ca/files/2014/05/the_diploma_points_matrix_may_2015_onwards-page-001.jpg ) . 
  cas is simply a pass/fail thing . 
  if you want to study medicine , hl chemistry is a ** must ** . 
  pretty much nothing else really matters , though taking biology can certainly help . 
  i 'd recommend staying away from hl maths , as it is an infamously difficult subject , and is not generally important for medicine . 
  however , you should do maths sl , rather than maths studies , because the latter is generally considered far less rigorous a course . 
  basically , if you want to study medicine , these are my recommendations :, 
  group 1 : your native language , either lit or lang/lit is fine, 
  group 2 : if you 've had experience with a language already , take that . 
  if not , pick spanish or french . 
  they 're among the easiest and most useful . 
  group 3 : anything you enjoy and are good at . 
  group 4 : chemistry hl, 
  group 5 : maths sl, 
  group 6 : biology hl, 
  you 'll need 1 more hl from the first 3 groups , and two sls . 
  group 4 and 6 can swap , it does n't matter which you do as part of which group . 
  if you * really * want to keep up an art because you enjoy it , that 's probably not the end of the world . 
  just make sure that it 's biology you drop and not chemistry . 
  i fundamentally disagree with this assessment . 
  beethoven was well-known for being a composer whose music tied in strongly with his political ideals : a trait highly associated with romantics . 
  he was one of the first to write something with a programme more specific than `` the four seasons '' or similarly broad categories : his pastoral symphony was far closer in programmaticness ( for lack of a better word ) to pictures at an exhibition or symphonie fantastique than to the aforementioned vivaldi . 
  his compositional style is one of great passion and pathos . 
  mozart and haydn made music that was very pretty to listen to , but ultimately felt like it had far less emotion in it . 
  following on from this , we can trace a lot of the emotion in beethoven 's music to extramusical influences , another trait associated with romantics . 
  in both the purely musical way , and by looking at his writing process , we can easily see that beethoven shares more with romantics in respect to emotion than with classicalists . 
  yes , the size of his orchestra was not nearly as large as during the majority of the romantic era ( though beethoven did grow it substantially , adding more horns very early on in his career , and expanding the woodwind and brass fairly substantially later on ) , and his harmonic writing was far less rich and complex than one might expect of wagner or mahler , but these are ultimately superficial traits when compared with the deeper inspirations behind the compositions and the general emphasis on emotion in music . 
  interesting username , by the way .
