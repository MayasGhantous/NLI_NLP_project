  hello internet , by cgp grey of the eponymous educational youtube channel and brady harren of many , many educational youtube channels including numberphile and computerphile . 
  anything on the [ this week in tech network ] ( http://twit.tv ) of podcasts . 
  my personal favourites are security now ! , this week in google , and the flagship show , twit . 
  also good are all about android , windows weekly , and macbreak weekly . 
  it sounds like you may have seen [ this video of bernstein describing what made beethoven , beethoven ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouyy1gv8jhu ) . 
  it 's certainly a great video , and bernstein raises some great points . 
  but i think he was unfairly harsh on beethoven 's other abilities . 
  it made for good rhetoric and helped put forward his point : that beethoven certainly * was * a master of form , but unnecessarily portrayed beethoven as weak in other respects , which he was not . 
  [ this response video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjct5m8jzl4 ) does a great job of refuting some of the claims bernstein made . 
  for what it 's worth , even if you have n't seen either of these videos before , both are absolutely worth watching just because they 're interesting . 
  this was a very interesting read . 
  it 's nice to know what wizards plans for the future , and for the most part i 'm happy with where they say they are going . 
  however :, 
   giants are a great opponent to use , but they do provide problems to their digital partners due to scale . 
  fuck that noise . 
  dungeons and dragons is a tabletop role playing game first and foremost . 
  in deciding what type of material to cover , that should be the only thing they give any serious consideration . 
  if their secondary products have problems with that , too bad . 
  they do n't need ` digital partners ' to be doing the same stuff as the game , and they absolutely should ** not ** allow the game to be limited by what * other * media find easy to do . 
   tired of spending half an hour rolling out character sheets ? 
  in fact , i had a heap of fun designing and creating a custom character sheet for my previous character that had the information i needed , where i needed it . 
  always forget what attributes are preferred for your class ? 
  not really . 
  in fact , i could probably tell you off the top of my head what the primary , secondary , and sometimes tertiary stats are for every class in the game . 
  want an impartial roller ? 
  i have one . 
  they 're called dice . 
  failing that , personally i just open up idle and ` from random import randint `, 
   as a side note , it 's amazing the different roll sets you see when you roll as many times as i did to test this thing . 
  some characters had no stat below 16 w / 4d6b3 . 
  some had no stat above 6 . 
  imagine those characters in the same campaign . 
  haha yeah . 
  this is why even though i say `` 4d6d1 '' 6 times for stats , i also put basic rules in place . 
  in general , if the total modifier is less than +3 , i allow a reroll . 
  if it 's above +6 , i force a reroll unless that comes from a very broadly spread character , lime a 14 and a bunch of 12s , in which case i would allow a reroll if the player wants . 
  randomness is fun and can make for interesting characters , but i feel like going full random penalises players too much from the outset if they happen to roll badly , and makes it unfun . 
  not that i have anything against people who do like full random , or who like point buy . 
   have fun with the app , hopefully it 's a bit useful . 
  so yeah , obviously my above comments were really negative sounding . 
  i just want to be clear , i actually really appreciate the effort and i 'm sure this is a fantastic app . 
  my criticisms were meant in a light-hearted fun kind of way . 
  and that 's totally fine . 
  having d&d video games and books is great , and i 'm excited for the upcoming movie , though honestly i expect it 'll tank , if not quite as badly as the previous movies . 
  but i think it is absolutely crucial that they do n't allow these secondary media to hamstring the tabletop game . 
  let the game do what they want to do for its own sake , and allow everything else to work around that and fit in as best they can . 
  sort of like the marvel cinematic universe . 
  the writers for the movies mostly ignore the tv shows . 
  it 's up to the shows to fit in with the films , because the films are the main part of that universe . 
  now , i think ignoring it completely is perhaps a bit * too * far , but it is better than having to completely change what the films are doing to fit in with changes necessitated by the shows . 
  they were specific only because they were directly related to specific things mentioned in the text of the op . 
  yeah , it 's gon na be quite a way down the line though . 
  i think it 's barely started being written yet , let alone entered pre-production proper . 
  i would n't expect it out until christmas 2017 at the earliest . 
  probably later . 
  it 's going to be set in the forgotten realms , rather than a non-specific setting like the previous films , so that 's definitely one positive point in its favour . 
  i expect they 'll probably also look at the warcraft film and try to emulate whatever positive traits it ends up having , and avoiding its pitfalls , especially since that will be the first real big budget true high fantasy film in decades . 
  regarding marvel , i actually deliberately avoided mentioning the comics , because they 're pretty much entirely their own thing , separate from the mcu completely . 
  instead , i tried to draw a comparison with the relationship between the films ( iron man , avengers , thor , etc. ), 
  and the tv shows that are a part of that universe ( agents of shield , daredevil , etc. 
  ) , since joss whedon quite notably said that he was ignoring the events of the tv shows while writing avengers 2 , instead expecting them to fit in with what he and his team did with the films . 
  in my opinion , assign as rolled should be done * before * choosing a class . 
  then choose what class fits with the stats . 
  think about it , a guy with less strength than a goblin is simply not going to go into battle wielding a sword or other strength based weapon . 
  it just wo n't happen . 
  so why would he be a fighter ? 
  it 's something he knows from experience he 's no good at . 
  this was a very interesting read . 
  it 's nice to know what wizards plans for the future , and for the most part i 'm happy with where they say they are going . 
  however :, 
   giants are a great opponent to use , but they do provide problems to their digital partners due to scale . 
  fuck that noise . 
  dungeons and dragons is a tabletop role playing game first and foremost .

  if their secondary products have problems with that , too bad . 
  they do n't need ` digital partners ' to be doing the same stuff as the game , and they absolutely should ** not ** allow the game to be limited by what * other * media find easy to do . 
  but i do n't want to be negative . 
  i 'm * really * excited about the direction that they are taking this game , and it feels like a fantastic strategy for the most part . 
  i 'm especially glad that they are apparently listening to feedback from players on a variety of things . 
  muphry 's law in action . 
  well , with a standard two-handed weapon , you can let go of it with one hand at any time that you 're not attacking , so you can easily interact with items using one hand during your turn . 
  if you 're dual wielding , this becomes much harder to do , since you 've got a weapon in both hands . 
  it 's only a very minor downside , but it 's worth thinking about . 
  it definitely would not be over powered at all , as there are no benefits to be gained compared to a normal greatsword ( unless you are allowed to split up the attack into attacks against two opponents , but it does n't sound like that is your intention , and it would be a * major * departure from the idea of using greatsword stats with the flavour of two weapons ) . 
  i actually agree completely with both you and with perkins . 
  i do n't give a rat 's arse about the storylines wizards is putting out , but at the same time , i like the way that using these storylines means they gradually put out content that feels relevant to a particular theme . 
  this way , we do n't get too overloaded with stuff that it becomes difficult and/or expensive to keep up . 
  the strongly themed material means that it 's easy to just look in the core books and one or two other books depending on the theme of the campaign . 
   for some reason, 
  because it 's dumb . 
  yeah , the tone is * way * different to grey 's normal videos . 
  his voice felt deeper than normal , and it was so slow and carefully paced . 
  and the music really aided the dark serious tone of the video . 
  it felt * very * different to humans need not apply , the video closest to this in terms of depth and breadth on its chosen topic ( i would argue ) . 
  that one felt a lot more like an extended version of one of his normal videos . 
  i really liked the way this was put together . 
  honestly the problem for australia really is n't the venomous animals : it 's no where near as bad as reddit likes to joke . 
  the real problem is a complete * absence * of large mammals . 
  just about the only large mammals indigenous to australia were the tasmanian tiger . 
  the dingo was introduced later by some of the earliest humans in the area .
