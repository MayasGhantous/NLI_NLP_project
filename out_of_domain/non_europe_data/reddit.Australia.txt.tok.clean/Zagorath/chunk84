  * i think that 's the key thing about beethoven 's sound , no matter what happens there 's always an underlying struggle going on . 
  * some form of anger or sadness always shows itself within beethoven 's works . 
  an interesting extra thing about his piano sonatas is that a lot of them sound very orchestral , like they are a transcription of something written for orchestra . 
  perhaps the chief of these is [ the path\u00e9tique ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqebdklvd00 ) , with tremolo octaves ( ** 6a ** , or 1:48 in the video ) in the first movement , and a sort of call and response between the bass and treble in the second thematic section of the allegro ( ** 6b ** , or 2:17 ) , and [ the second movement ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h40j6s3ncre&amp;feature=relmfu ) having a very orchestral style middle harmony and sforzandos , with andras schiff describing the triplets like two clarinets ( ** 6c ** , or 2:43 in the video ) . 
  another good example in my opinion is the [ opening to the waldstein ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdvmcz6uwrc ) . 
  beethoven 's symphonies also have a distinct timbral style ( the way different instruments are used together ) that 's much harder to describe . 
  he uses the wind instruments a lot for chords and harmonies , but not so much for the main melody . 
  when he does use it for the melody it makes very clever use of the timbre of the instrument specifically . 
  listen to any of his symphonies played in a full orchestra and you 'll get a sense of his very unique timbre , it 's hard to describe . 
  i 'd say the best to listen to for this purpose would be the third movement of symphony no. 5 , the second movement of no. 7 , and the first ( or fourth ) movement of no. 3 . 
  my absolute favourite thing , though , is the way beethoven deals with counter-melodies and harmonies . 
  the two best examples of this i think are the moonlight sonata , mvt .1 , the left hand at a point near the end ( extract ** 7 ** , or [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arnrfubbnyc ) at 3:27 ) , listen closely to the bass or if you can play it yourself , just the bass . 
  it 's just incredibly to listen to !, 
  and the recapitulation to the first movement of [ beethoven 's 5th ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fknoyswt5bm ) ( actually , throughout this piece there are brilliant moments for this , such as the cellos playing the duh duh duh duuuuh motif during the more lyrical melody the strings and wind play at 2:58 , and many more ) , the bassoons and oboes have some amazing parts . 
  listen from 5:30 , the bassoon 's countermelody , and then the oboe 's long notes * after * its solo . 
  this is n't the best version for hearing either of those , [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4irmyue1hi ) at 4:06 is better ( in fact , this version is probably better overall ) , or [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2qw6fotamy ) from 4:19 ( just the oboe after the solo , not the bassoon before it ) . 
  beethoven is absolutely amazing at doing this kind of subtle but beautiful harmony . 
  anyway , that 's my two and a bit cents on my favourite composer , if you 're interested in learning more i would strongly recommend checking out [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouyy1gv8jhu ) in which leonard bernstein talks about beethoven 's musical style , why he 's so great but also what he believes were beethoven 's weaknesses . 
  then check out [ this response to it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjct5m8jzl4 ) from a more recent professional composer/orchestrator . 
  edit : by the way , do n't apologise for your long-windedness . 
  that 's part of what made the last thread interesting , and what i hope will make this thread equally awesome . 
  i 'm exactly the same way ( as you can see from this overly long chunk of text ) . 
  i 've just rewatched the video responding to bernstein and it reminded me of just how good it really is . 
  you * have * to find the time to watch it , even if it is quite long . 
  it 's just a fantastic insight to the quality of beethoven 's music , even if you have n't seen bernstein 's criticism ( although the response is even better if you have seen that ) . 
  guys , why are we downvoting him ? 
  what he said makes sense . 
  the controls for a 3d pok\u00e9mon rpg in the style of skyrim would be difficult with just a mouse and keyboard ( and even worse on ps3/xbox controllers ) . 
  i do n't think we would have to wait for really good voice recognition and virtual reality , but a lot more attention to controls would have to be paid for this game than for most rpgs . 
  if you 're capable of passing the diploma , you should * definitely * do the diploma . 
  only switch to certificate if you think you will fail otherwise . 
  certificate is n't `` a thing '' . 
  you get an ib certificate for every subject you pass if you do n't pass the ib diploma ( either because you failed it or because you did n't enter ) . 
  the ib diploma requires the 6 subjects from different groups at the different levels , i 'm sure you know those rules already . 
  in addition , to get your diploma you need to complete your cas , and do an extended essay and theory of knowledge . 
  additionally , you can not get an e in both the ee and tok . 
  to pass the diploma there are a number of other requirements with the total points . 
  it 's safest if you get over 28 points total ( up to 7 for each subject and up to 3 for the tok and ee ) , but here are a list of the actual rules , taken straight from [ this official ibo document ] ( http://ibo.org/become/guidance/documents/dpgeneralregulations_e_finalfile.pdf ), 
   13.3 the ib diploma will be awarded to a candidate whose total score is 24 , 25 , 26 or 27 points , provided all the following requirements have been met . 
   a. numeric grades have been awarded in all six subjects registered for the ib diploma . 
  all cas requirements have been met . 
   c . at least a grade d has been awarded for both tok and the extended essay . 
   d . there is no grade 1 in any subject . 
   e . there is no grade 2 at higher level . 
   f . there is no more than one grade 2 at standard level . 
   g. overall , there are no more than three grades 3 or below . 
   h . at least 12 points have been gained in higher level subjects ( candidates who register for four, 
  higher level subjects must gain at least 16 points at higher level ) . 
  at least 9 points have been gained on standard level subjects ( candidates who register for two, 
  standard level subjects must gain at least 6 points at standard level ) . 
  the candidate has not been found guilty of malpractice by the ib organization . 
   13.4 the ib diploma will be awarded to a candidate whose total score is 28 points or above , provided all the following requirements have been met . 
   a. numeric grades have been awarded in all six subjects registered for the ib diploma . 
  all cas requirements have been met . 
   c. grades a ( highest ) to e ( lowest ) have been awarded for both tok and an extended essay , with a grade of at least d in one of them . 
   d . there is no grade 1 in any subject . 
   e . there is no more than one grade 2 at higher level . 
   f . there are no more than three grades 2 at standard level . 
   g. overall , there are no more than three grades 3 or below . 
   h . at least 11 points have been gained on higher level subjects ( candidates who register for four, 
  higher level subjects must gain at least 14 points at higher level ) . 
  at least 8 points have been gained on standard level subjects ( candidates who register for two, 
  standard level subjects must gain at least 5 points at standard level ) . 
  the candidate has not been found guilty of malpractice by the ib organization . 
  remember , even if you aim for the ib diploma but you fail it for one of these reasons , you will still get a certificate in each of the subjects that you managed to complete . 
  for that reason it 's best not to switch unless you think you * will fail * the diploma , because that way you can pick and choose your subjects and concentrate only on the most important ones . 
  ianal , but i do n't think it matters who did it , if anything the fact that they are in a position of power could make it worse . 
  it is n't at all a stretch to say that what they did was sexual harassment . 
  the idea of this game would be very different to the normal pok\u00e9mon games , which are played in a completely 2d world , and combat is turn-based . 
  what we 're talking about here is a 3d world with real-time combat , like you see in games like skyrim . 
  it 's simple in skyrim because you control your own character , and your character is doing the fighting . 
  in pok\u00e9mon , however , you are moving around but when you get into a battle it 's your pok\u00e9mon that do the fighting , not you . 
  it would be difficult to have a good system for controlling the pok\u00e9mon in real-time whilst still having a realistic gameplay style that fits with how pok\u00e9mon works . 
  it could definitely done , but it would require more thinking than most games . 
  if there are any technical terms you do n't understand just ask and i 'll do my best to explain them . 
  wikipedia can be hard to understand , it makes everything far more complicated than it needs to be if you do n't already understand most of what you 're looking for . 
  right , but you 've got two people you have to control , yourself and your pok\u00e9mon , how do the battles play out ? 
  do you have to press a button to throw the pok\u00e9mon out , or can you have some always following you ? 
  how do you call them back into the pok\u00e9ball ? 
  can your human character get hit by attacks ? 
  if so , then how do you make sure they stay out of the way in a fight ( how can you control both pok\u00e9mon and human at once ? 
  ) , and if not what 's the disadvantage in completely ignoring wild pok\u00e9mon ? 
  or if you only indirectly control the pok\u00e9mon , how do you make it dynamic enough to not feel like it 's semi-turn-based ? 
  all these problems and more would come up in trying to make a good interface and game design . 
  they could definitely be solved , i 'm sure , but it would be no means be a simple redesign of skyrim 's graphics . 
  that 's a really simple way of implementing it , and it would work , but i do n't think it 's a particularly good solution . 
  ideally whatever the solution is would integrate the combat into the normal gameplay without interruption , at least in my opinion . 
   getting 28 in your diploma is better than getting five certificates with 6 in each of them ( 30 total ) . 
  this seems totally bizarre to me . 
  are you * absolutely * sure that 's true ? 
  i mean , in the uk ib students are competing with the pile of shit that is a levels , where most students only do 3 , sometimes 4 , subjects anyway . 
  that means that technically if you did 4 ib hl subjects on certificate , if they were being fair about it , you should have the same chance as someone doing a levels . 
  that said , from what i 've observed about british teachers and the british uni admission process , it would n't surprise me at all if that is true . 
  ^ ( no offense meant to you or any britishers , except for any teachers or university admissions people who think this is fine . ), 
  edit : one of the worst things i 've seen about the admissions process : a student from my school who is french had this happen to her when applying to uni in the uk . 
  she did ib in english ( as in , her maths , science , humanities , etc. 
  papers were in english , not french or spanish ) , she took english literature a1 ( higher level , i 'm pretty sure ) , and the school we went to has the word `` british '' in its name . 
  however , despite this , she still had to do whatever their english language ability exam was when entering . 
  i get that they need to make sure people 's ability in english is high enough , but surely taking english a1 should be enough ? 
  ( tbh , i 'd probably say just taking the ib in english would be enough , but this is a compromise . ),
