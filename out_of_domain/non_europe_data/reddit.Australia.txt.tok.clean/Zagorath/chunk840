  the member for regional victoria will retract his imputations of hatefulness . 
  meta : i assume that is what you were referring to ? 
  restricteve ? 
  just say `` i retract '' or words to that effect . 
  i ca n't draw for shit , but i 'm quite proud of the world map i designed for myself . 
  my method was very different . 
  first i got some a3 paper ( well , actually i taped two bits of a4 together ) . 
  then i drew very rough islands and continents in very lightly . 
  nothing more than just a very general shape with no real detail . 
  redo this until you 're happy with the general shape . 
  next , i 'd rub out little bits of it at a time and redo it with more detail . 
  the great thing about this stage is that you do n't need to be a good drawer . 
  coasts are extremely irregular and often have an almost fractal nature . 
  let your hand jerk back and forth for an uneven edge as much as you like . 
  doing things like having big fjords in extreme southern and northern areas can add some more variety and a touch of realism . 
  put a lot of small islands hugging the coastline , and islands in groups , especially around peninsulas and capes . 
  next add in mountains . 
  for realism , put them along large peninsulas or archipelagos ( like cape horn in south america ) , along coastlines ( like west coast usa with the rockies ) , or where two landmasses join ( like the himalayas with the indian subcontinent and mainland asia ) . 
  in hand drawings , simple triangles with the bottom left open are all you really need . 
  now rivers and forests . 
  rivers always flow down , and always join , * never * separate or split in two , unless you 're talking about a delta right near the sea . 
  rivers can be simple lines , and forests can be a series of weird fluffy things . 
  along the forest 's southernmost edge you might want to draw little sticks funder the fluffy things , like you 're looking at then from a slight angle and can see the trunks of those at the bottom . 
  [ here 's a really shitty photo of a map i made in this way ] ( http://imgur.com/qu56gtt ) . 
  i cheated a little . 
  the group of islands in the north west is a straight up rip off of the fire nation from avatar , just because i really liked the shape of that archipelago . 
  but the rest of it is all mine . 
  also you can change the 4 to a 3 to automatically do the whole screen ( 4 lets you select an area ) , or you can press spacebar after that shortcut to automatically do a whole window by clicking on it . 
  and with any of those , if you drop the control , it will throw it on your desktop as a . png file , rather than copying it to the clipboard . 
  do n't they also have that really ugly looking 3d animated batman show ? 
   so that 's why yj and gl : tas were cancelled . 
  wait , what 's the reason , exactly ? 
  i thought it was because of cn not liking them , not because of dc . 
  you 're right that learning vim probably is n't worth it just for some config files here and there . 
  if you 're doing * any * sort of command line work with text files on a regular basis , though , it 's definitely worth it . 
  it really does n't take as long as everyone jokes to figure out . 
  took me about two hours going through the tutorial and then messing around before i was fairly comfortable with it . 
  for what it 's worth , though ,, 
   investing time in one os is a large barrier , and the payoff does n't seem to be worth it, 
  vim is installed out of the box on os x , and probably some linux distros . 
  it 's certainly very easy to install on any linux distro . 
  so that 's not just one but two out of the three major operating systems . 
   and vi is . 
  this is not my experience . 
  i was mildly infuriated to discover that ubuntu does not come with vim at all . 
  of course , it 's super easy to install via ` apt-get ` , but still : it definitely did n't come with it . 
  my mobile app cuts your flair off after `` ph '' . 
  so you 're doing maths and physics , what 's your third hl ? 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease no later than 1500\u00a028/11 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  ## votes, 
  ** ayes ** : 1, 
  ** noes ** : 5, 
  abstentions/yet to vote : 5, 
  ### i think the noes have it . 
  as there has only been a single member calling for a division , that dissent will be recorded in hansard , but the house will not divide .

  i interpreted that as you gaining free movement through the use of the spell . 
  you would still have your normal movement . 
   when you cast the spell and on your turn until the spell ends, 
  i interpret this to mean that you grow horns , and they 'll last for up to 1 minute ( concentration willing ) , but once you attack with them , they disappear . 
  is that correct ? 
  if so , i think it is very poorly worded . 
  i would recommend taking a look at the way smite spells like thunderous smite and wrathful smite are worded and borrow something similar to that . 
   the next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell 's duration ...

  the member 's time has expired . 
  he will resume his seat . 
  the term for that would be whitelist , not blacklist . 
  i ca n't fathom * not * using it . 
  it makes perfect logical sense that if someone is being attacked from two opposite sides , they 're going to have a hard time defending themselves . 
  not using it is saying that somehow they can completely defend themselves despite being fully surrounded , which is dumb . 
  it 's even easier for the enemies to use it against the players , if that 's your issue . 
  there are usually greater numbers of enemies than there are players , which makes these man\u0153uvers far easier to exploit . 
  so it works both ways .
