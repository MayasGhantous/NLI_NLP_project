  i would be happy if they did this , but what i * really * want is closure for the story that constantine was building . 
  the growing darkness , manny apparently being fallen ( or possibly satan himself ? 
  ) , all of that . 
  they were building such an awesome story and i really want to see it brought to a close .

  traditionally `` hear , hear `` s go towards speeches in favour of or against a particular position , rather than to the speaker for chairing a debate . 
  but i thank the honourable member nonetheless . 
  i took econ sl and thoroughly enjoyed it . 
  it definitely feels like a course that 's worth knowing the basics of for just about anyone . 
  it 's not necessarily `` useful '' per se , unless you 're going in to a directly related field , but i find it interesting to know , and it 's probably the more applicable in average conversations or internet debates . 
  it 's also not a very difficult subject . 
  i got a 6 in it , despite having a teacher in my first year who was so incompetent we basically learnt the * entire * course in year 2 . 
  philosophy is certainly interesting , but it 's worth noting that you 'll be doing some basic philosophy-related stuff anyway , with theory of knowledge . 
  so you 'll already be getting some of that interesting stuff even if you do n't take philosophy as its own subject . 
  i ca n't comment on the difficulty of it : philosophy was n't offered at my school . 
  i think a better analogy would be `` if i 'm an effeminate male and you 're a masculine female that makes us similar '' . 
  same same , but different .

  i sure as fuck would . 
  that dude must make bank !, 
  way more than i do . 
  i 've got other instruments on which i can maintain artistic integrity . 
  i absolutely love reilly 's books !, 
  hover car racer was a very interesting one-off , but his jack west jr series , starting with '' * seven ancient wonders * '' is probably the best action-adventure i 've ever read . 
  meta : that is correct per my understanding of these bills . 
  a vote `` no '' here would be to support labor 's attempt to start charging the gst to students at private schools . 
  a vote of `` aye '' supports 3fun 's desire to remove that from the proposed bill and keep all students exempt . 
  labor 's amendment would involve * removing * the following from the gst act :, 
   38\u201155 private health insurance etc. 
   ( 1 ) a supply of * private health insurance is gst\u2011free . 
   ( 2 ) a supply of insurance against liability to pay for services supplied by ambulance is gst\u2011free . 
   ( 3 ) however , a supply of re\u2011insurance is not gst\u2011free under this section . 
  that is to say , labor 's aim is to have private health insurance have gst added to it . 
  3fun 's amendment is to remove this the above ( just like labor ) , * and then * add in the following :, 
   ( 1 ) a supply of insurance against liability to pay for services supplied by ambulance is gst\u2011free . '', 
  in other words , if you vote `` aye '' here , you would be removing sections ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) from the original act , but section ( 2 ) would remain . 
  i 'll be honest , i 'm not * entirely * sure what it is that clause 2 actually does . 
  it 's something involving an ambulance , but i 'm not sure it 's * just * getting an ambulance service . 
  if you change your vote , could you please just ping me so i know to update the running tally . 
  but at the same time , the inverse is also sorta true . 
  it 's not really fair if someone is shit at roleplaying in real life , but wants to play a high charisma character , if they are penalised because they as a * player * ca n't do what their * character * clearly can . 
  you should cross-post this over to / r/dndgreentext . 
  i would also like to know this . 
  that is why i would like to know this .

  looks like really good stuff . 
  not quite as much variety as incompetech , but more tailored to rpg background music . 
  so it has . 
  i 've even apparently seen it before , since the post and most of the comments are marked as upvoted from my account ... 
  musta just forgotten . 
  the problem is that this still penalises the weaker roleplayer . 
  i 'm not gon na lie , i do things the same way , because i like to encourage cool things , but i just feel a little uneasy about it .
