  i thought you had already not done that . 
  i thought that 's why your typing was so slow . 
  the reason is because it enables you to look down at your hands , which you should never do . 
  if you leave the keys arranged as they were for qwerty , you 're forced to learn to touch-type absolutely , without the crutch . 
  you 'll end up becoming a * much * better typist this way . 
  what i generally recommend is that you print out a copy of the dvorak layout and stick it under your monitor , or have it next to your computer if you 're using a laptop . 
  i doubt it . 
  when i was a qwerty typist , i could kinda mostly touch-type , but i found myself glancing at the keys anyway from time to time . 
  now i can type absolutely comfortably with my eyes completely closed , or ( more practically ) entirely while looking at the screen . 
  i ca n't say i 've ever really associated qwerty keys with dvorak ones , to be honest . 
  i 've always been more ambidextrous than purely left handed , though my left hand is considerably faster than my right , and neater in normal writing , too . 
  it is n't better , but it 's less convenient . 
  you 'll have to more naturally learn how to use the keyboard without looking , and as a result you 'll quickly find you do n't need the cheat sheet at all . 
  in fact , you 'll probably really only need to keep it at all for the first month or so . 
  i do n't know why it is , but for some reason , having the cheat sheet off to the side away from the keyboard forces you to still instinctively learn the mental pathways that associate finger movements with letters , rather than relying on looking . 
  to be entirely honest , you 're going to want to switch back to qwerty for gaming . 
  dvorak is far from optimised for gaming , and most games have their shortcuts designed with qwerty in mind . 
  the interaction between games and dvorak is ... an odd one . 
  some games seem to automatically switch you back to qwerty . 
  on-screen prompts will say `` w '' to go forward , and pressing the key labelled `` w '' ( assuming you * did n't * rearrange the keycaps ) will make you go forward . 
  i think this is because they 're not listening for ascii characters , but for signals directly from the keyboard . 
  and they just assume you 're using qwerty and map prompts to that . 
  others automatically pick up on the fact that you 're using dvorak , and will adjust on-screen prompts accordingly . 
  they 'll automatically tell you that '' , '' goes forward . 
  still others -- these last ones are a pain to deal with -- they just think you 're still using qwerty and give prompts accordingly , and you have to press in the location that the same key on dvorak is mapped to . 
  to strafe right in a standard wasd game , you have to press the key with `` h '' written on it , or to go back , you have to press the one labelled '' ; '' . 
  for programming , i might suggest coming up with a custom layout . 
  get things like braces and the semicolon into more convenient locations . 
  there 's a well-known `` programmer 's dvorak '' , but personally i 'm not a fan of that . 
  it has numbers in a weird order , and i do n't think its placement of symbols is ideal . 
  i adapted it and made my own coder 's dvorak that you 're more than welcome to copy or adapt .

  though i 've since switched the left bracket and the equals sign , so that the left bracket is under 5 and equals is under 6 . 
  i 've also gone back and forth over whether to flip the asterisk and plus sign or put them back as they are in that screenshot . 
  but i 'd suggest ignoring all of that until you 're more comfortable using the normal dvorak simplified keyboard . 
  it 's super useful , but it 's probably just a hinderance if you are n't already proficient with the normal layout . 
  btw , for what it 's worth , dvorak should be capitalised like a normal proper noun , and not made all-caps . 
  it 's named after the person who first came up with it . 
  qwerty is all-caps because it 's named after the literal letters on its top row . 
  ah yeah , i did n't notice the username . 
  but you 're probably right . 
  if they do end up being in the same `` universe '' , i hope they do it by making use of multiversal stuff . 
  the flash is already exploring that , with a lot of crossovers between earth-1 ( the arrowverse ) and earth-2 , so why not say that supergirl takes place in earth-4 or something ? 
  yeah , i really do n't think that 's very ambiguous . 
  you * might * be able to write fireball into your spellbook as a wizard , * maaaybe * , but that does n't override the rules for preparing spells as a multiclassed character : you definitely would not be able to * prepare * fireball until you hit your 5th level in wizard , sorcerer , fiend warlock , or light cleric . 
  yes , in that third category of games you can just change the key bindings . 
  personally i do n't bother . 
  switching back to qwerty is a simple keyboard shortcut of its own . 
  but you can certainly do that if you would prefer . 
  very good point . 
  the guiding nibs are pretty damn important . 
  also many keyboards have keys that are subtly tilted for their locations on qwerty .

  is there a way to transfer these to the senate in one message , or do i need to send three in the same format as the last one ? 
  i would say the base race is a base of +2.5 , but can be adjusted based on walking speed and size ( small is -0.5 , each 5 ft. extra or less movement gives \u00b1 0.5 ) . 
  skeleton is maybe +4.5 , maybe +5.0 . 
  i do wonder about the finesse property on the skeleton 's arm . 
  i understand that it meshes well with the increased dex , but logically why is the arm finesse ? 
  it feels like a very brute-forced type weapon . 
  i have a hard time understanding logically how * any * bludgeoning weapon would be finesse . 
  revenant is maybe +4.0 , but very situational , probably closer to +3.5 . 
  `` creature of the dm 's choosing '' . 
  i feel it would be better if that part was left out . 
  just call it a `` creature '' , and let players and dms work out together what the creature is . 
  of course , you need to prevent it from being abused by players using it to track down a mysterious behind-the-scenes type bbeg , but at the same time , it could be interesting for a player to write someone into their own backstory who killed them , so leaving it entirely to the dm does n't feel right to me . 
  with the ghost , remember that as of the [ errata ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/errata_ph.pdf ) , * everyone * is proficient with unarmed strikes , so you do n't need to specify that . 
  i like the fact that it 's necrotic damage , but i wonder if perhaps you could n't have it use something other than the standard strength for damage : maybe make it + con or something . 
  not sure , just a thought . 
  i 'd probably give the ghost about +4.5 + whatever the flight is worth . 
  so all in all , i think these are great . 
  quite powerful looking , but honestly a lot of their abilities are pretty situational , so i think they 're not as powerful as the numbers might suggest . 
  i definitely would n't be rushing to call them overpowered . 
  on reddit , you need to put a blank line between separate lines/paragraphs for it to display correctly . 
  alternatively , if you just want to write in paragraph format ( or `` prose '' ) , you do n't need to use greentext if you do n't want to . 
  if you want your text to display in greentext format , prefix each line with ''  '' .
