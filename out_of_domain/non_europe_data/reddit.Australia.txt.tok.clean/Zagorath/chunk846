  lane never commented on it , they just completely let it slide for some reason ... 
  actually it sounded to me like she was upset that she lost her `` normal '' life on krypton , not earth . 
   my normal life ended the * second * my parents put me on that ship ; and that makes me * so * mad . 
   the fire spreads around corners . 
  it ignites flammable objects in the area that are n't being worn or carried . 
  so yes , it * can * go around objects . 
  however , i would say that if the cover extends out beyond the range of the fireball , the fireball has no ability to go around it . 
  of course , that only applies if it 's * full * cover . 
  honestly i was less bothered by the conversations early on than i am now . 
  i thought for the most part they were covering obvious ground in the first episode , and the second one felt completely natural in-universe , and from a meta perspective it felt like the writers were making fun of themselves : parodying the strong feminist message from the first episode . 
  this episode i cringed at every one of those lines . 
  they felt * way * more forced than before to me . 
  meta : i 'm still trying to figure out how these considerations in detail are supposed to work .

  where are those ? 
  i 've moved everything i 've been able to find . 
  this thread has gotten ... rather lengthy now . 
  you forgot, 
   this question has been closed because it is a duplicate of [ question with a couple of similar surface features that is ultimately a different question ], 
  and, 
   this question has been closed because it is off topic, 
  no i mean , where is the actual motion that needs to be put ? 
  ah , so it is . 
  but no , there 's nothing about thp on it either in the spell itself , or as far as i can see with the undying warlock . 
  nah man , i am * totally * there with you . 
  i love it because i google problems at it 's always near the top , frequently with a perfect solution to my problem . 
  but i honestly have no interest in ever making an account and submitting stuff on there , because its community is absolutely toxic . 
  sleep sort is second best sort . 
  that 's the one i just replied to . 
  generally you append the element to an array when its time sleeping is done , but otherwise yeah . 
  well , sleep sort is much more likely to succeed . 
  you start a thread for each element , with the thread sleeping for its value seconds . 
  at the end of its sleep , it gets appended to an array . 
  there 's a relevant xkcd to this , because [ of course there is ] ( https://xkcd.com/979/ ) . 
  i musta missed that bit . 
  i thought he just started mumbling after he said `` your cousin '' ... 
  for . 
  me it 's about story vs. gameyness . 
  i find point buy to be incredibly gamey . 
  it 's about min/maxing to get your main stats really high and minimise the waste in your off stats . 
  rolling , so long as it is done within certain bounds ( reroll if you 're too strong overall , or too weak , to prevent some players from hogging the spotlight or feeling left out ) , lets you build a more organic character and fit that in to your backstory . 
  you might be really good at two stats and shit at everything else . 
  you might have 12s and 14s , and one 6 . 
  a party is going to get stats that have so much more variety in * type * than with point buy , where it 's usually going to be one or two skills maxed out at the expense of all else . 
  i do n't remember rolling even being an * option * in 4e . 
  fwiw one thing that makes me like rolling more than point buy is the chance of starting with at least an 18 ( and an even smaller chance of starting with a 20 , but i 'm not so concerned about that ) . 
  i think limiting point buy to 15 + racials was a stupid decision . 
  it should * at least * go up to 16 . 
  my table has very simple rules . 
  rolling is always done in front of the dm * at least * , preferably the whole table . 
  i trust my whole table implicitly , but we still roll stats in public because it 's a fun part of the experience , and this way there can be * no * doubt about honesty . 
  if your stats are too low or too high , you reroll . 
  that being * roughly * between a total of +3 and +6 , before you account for racial bonuses . 
  roughly , because if you had an 18 , 16 , three 6s , and a 10 , i 'd probably allow that despite being `` too low '' , and i 'd probably allow a reroll on six 12s if you wanted it . 
  main point is , rolling gets you some nice variety that you do n't see in point buy ( where it feels * wrong * if you do n't min/max ) , but you need to adjust for overall party balance to some degree so you do n't get one person hogging the spotlight , or feeling left out . 
  do you mean [ fuck it sort ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/27e3xg/my_favorite_sorting_algorithm/ci01v07 ) ? 
  because googling `` fuck sort '' just got me a bunch of porn results ... ( with the above link about half way down the page . ), 
  i did n't realise there was an old method ?

  the question is proposed : that the amendment be agreed to . 
  i believe this is still consideration in detail , so debate it below :, 
  ! page for debate, 
   if your question has been closed as a duplicate it 's not a slight against you , it 's just the truth, 
  except it so clearly is n't . 
  i 've never asked a question on there ( as i said : the community is * toxic * and i do n't want to get involved ) , but i 've googled problems , and i frequently come up with a question that so perfectly meets what i want , only to find it has no good answers , because it got closed for being a duplicate . 
  except the question that it supposedly duplicates is * clearly not the same * . 
  it might have certain similarities , but it 's regarding a different platform , or different tools , or something else , but there 's so often a subtle but important difference that the so community ignores or does n't give a shit about . 
  i do n't remember ever doing anything with cid before . 
  what is the point of order ? 
  i 'll try to remember to do that , sure . 
  the question is put : that the amendment be * now agreed to .
