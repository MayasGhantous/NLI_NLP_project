   on the other it 's completely unfair to someone playing a warlock if they get screwed over because of their pact, 
  this is definitely true , but at the same time , if the players are open to it , that can make for a really dramatic moment . 
  my character ~ ~ is ~ ~ ( edit : * was * , dunno what she is now ) a fiend warlock , and in our final session of the last campaign , an angel ( which had been summoned by one of the other players ) destroyed the devil , breaking the connection . 
  shortly afterwards i got my hands on a genie while the other characters were arguing , and tried to use it to wish my patron back , but buggered up the wording of it ( damn tricksy genies ! ) . 
  so now going in to the next campaign i do n't exactly know what i 'll be doing . 
  have to speak with the incoming dm to figure out if i can find a worthy patron or not . 
  it 's all very frustrating , but at the same time , it made for really dramatic roleplay and we all really enjoyed how it went . 
  i would agree , but the comment i replied to actually already included that . 
  i 'm not at home at the moment , but i love thinking it might be because i coded it in a way that assumed no thread would get much longer than 100 comments ... 
  i 'll have a check when i get back . 
  ! page `` see this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaushr/comments/3u7zbe/263a_resumption_2nd_session_of_a_new_tax_system/cxljf1k '', 
  exactly . 
  the majority of pirates were either never going to buy the books anyway , used the piracy as a free trial before buying , or use it because the digital copy is sometimes more convenient than the physical one that they also have . 
  the number of pirates who use piracy as a means of getting for free something that they * would * have bought if they could n't pirate is likely miniscule . 
  i do n't think i 've seen you outside the avatar subreddits before ( and i have n't visited those since shortly after the show ended ) . 
  good place to start , for anyone just discovering it now , is with the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which has some of the best stories . 
  a couple of the `` longer '' ones a * really * long , especially demigods and stranded , but trust me they are worth it . 
  i had to read them over a few days though , reading a little bit at a time . 
  here 's a fun fact that i bet you did n't know . 
  sir bearington actually was n't originally in the greentext format . 
  [ it was first posted on a forum , about a year before the greentext ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dpqop/the _ original_story_of_sir_bearington / ) . 
  i absolutely adore the seventh , especially the second movement . 
  i 'm just not sure i 'd call it revolutionary in the same way those other ones are . 
  i do n't think it had as much of a profound impact on the artform in general . 
  just an fyi , this thread is for discussing the latest episode . 
  spoilers up to and including this episode do n't really need to be marked , because anyone in the comments of this thread should have seen that far . 
  i definitely think this episode was pointing towards it being thea that dies . 
  dunno if that was a deliberate red herring or a legitimate clue , but either way this is getting interesting . 
  mmmm , that 's actually a pretty good point . 
  carry on , sir . 
  my favourites would probably be these ones ( from / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof , the dndgreentext hall of fame ) :, 
  * [ an evil campaign gone ... good ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/21ba53/an_evil_campaign_gonegood/ ), 
  * [ the medusa ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2cc629/the_medusa/ ), 
  * [ stranded ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2o99zp/unsuspecting_modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and/ ) also had some major feels , but it requires a lot of investment for the payoff . 
  it 's * really * long . 
  i 'd highly recommend it , but i 'd also say : read it over the course of a few days , a little bit at a time . 
  ah , so it is . 
  just a tip , the expression is actually `` per se '' . 
  but this was 2e ... it probably happened way before the modern open world rpg video games ever existed . 
   it 's winter, 
  admittedly , this is n't an idea that would work so well if it * were * summer , or if you 're in the tropics ( though there you 're likely to have air conditioning anyway ) . 
  in those cases , i guess a belt is your only real option . 
  edit : or longer shirts , as suggested, 
  2 is n't homebrew , that 's one of the official options presented in the book . 
  i do n't think 5 is really a homebrew rule , so much as an obvious interpretation of the already existing rules . 
  7 feels like an obvious part of building a character , but having it as a mandatory rule is a good way to encourage players who might be more rollplayers than roleplayers to think a bit more about the character . 
  my table 's biggest homebrew rule is probably allowing `` sliding '' . 
  you can spend your entire movement speed to move back just 5 ft. without provoking opportunity attacks . 
  because being able to run 60 feet in circles around your opponent without provoking an opportunity attack , but not carefully take a step backwards away from them without doing so , is stupid . 
  arrow , the flash , and constantine have been established as `` earth 1 '' . 
  earth 2 is also taken , since that 's where jay garrick and zoom are from . 
  supergirl takes place on an earth where she and superman are the only public superheroes . 
  so earth 4 or something is where she would have to be if they 're going to cross over with the arrowverse ( earth 3 being reserved for one in which the good guys are evil and vice versa ) . 
  not really possible . 
  the first episode of supergirl mentioned that she was the * second * hero earth had , and everyone was amazed at the idea of super powers when the flash first started appearing publicly . 
  i think it was the very end of the episode . 
  `` earth does n't have just one hero anymore . 
  now it has * supergirl * ! '', 
  or something like that . 
  the question is put : that the amendment be agreed to .

  oh thank god , that makes this so much easier . 
  but surely c is exactly the same , no ? 
  most of the time it 's fairly intuitive , but there are some exceptions that can be explained by etymology ? 
  out of curiosity , how do you personally pronounce gif ? 
  it 's an interesting idea , but at the same time would make it much less convenient for its most common purpose , which is paging in the two houses of parliament . 
  i 'll have a think on a potential way to go about allowing paging in this subreddit or others without decreasing the convenience in the hor and senate . 
  hear , hear !, 
  actually apparently not .
