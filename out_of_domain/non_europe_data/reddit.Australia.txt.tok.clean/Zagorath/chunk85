  i 'm a fairly good amateur clarinetist who dabbles in saxophone , and i can also definitely say that it 's much easier to go the way i did than to go the other way . 
  looking at the table , i 'm really surprised at how low the number for portuguese-spanish is considering how high french-italian is . 
  i would have thought it 'd be well into the .9 s , but it 's actually rated exactly the same as french-italian . 
  same with italian-spanish , i would have thought that would be higher than italian-french . 
  something tells me that this lexical similarity stuff has little practical use in the real world for comparing intelligibility of languages , which is what 's really important for determining dialect vs language . 
   with the exception of hl maths which is equivalent to maths and further maths at a level, 
  well . 
  i 'm amazed at people that do further maths in ib ... normal hl maths was hard enough . 
  i think i saw a thing comparing ib and a level music a little while ago , but i ca n't seem to find it again . 
  the summaries that it had made ib look like the tougher of the two . 
  i think the common statement that a levels are harder than ib is really a subject-by-subject thing , and maybe al comes out on top in a few more cases , but i do n't think it 's as extreme as many would have us believe . 
   if you choose to do the ib , you should follow it through, 
  definitely . 
  i got ta say , i 'm really glad i 'm going to australia . 
  aussie unis * love * the ib . 
  my 37 points would be equivalent to an op3 in the queensland system last year ( slight changes each year ) , where lower numbers are better , and it 's out of 25 . 
  well , not necessarily . 
  if there is an afterlife , what 's saying there are n't multiple different ones ? 
  kinda like the heaven/hell belief , but maybe less binary . 
  / devil 's advocate, 
  well done ( if you do get it ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure the best my school 's ever gotten was 43 . 
  oh no doubt . 
  an intermediary game would be brilliant , i 'm just thinking further down the line . 
  my apologies ma'am . 
  good luck . 
  your exams this may ? 
  i had my final exams last may , but this time last year i had n't finished my ee yet . 
   i was having a stupid moment, 
  welcome to ib !, 
  i know a person who had one of those old black macbooks , and when she got a newer macbook pro she kept the old one for some things , at least for a while . 
  some people like apostrophes over good grammar . 
  i agree completely , all this anti-apple stuff gets on my nerves as much as the super pro-apple stuff i see sometimes on other sites . 
  macs and pcs both have advantages and disadvantages . 
  fanboys need to get over it . 
  really ? 
  i find the bar disappears by itself when i click on the file i 've just downloaded . 
  it 's annoying , really . 
   the share/favorite/send-to-mobile button, 
  that sounds interesting . 
  could you explain a bit more about it , or send me a link where i can read more about it ? 
  [ someone found the wallpaper-sized version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/j2ick.jpg ) . 
  if your screen is 1920 x 1080 you 'll need to crop it . 
  you 'd prefer to be mobile . 
  while strictly speaking nearly any instrument can be moved , in practical terms you 'll have to rule out lower brass ( possibly including horn ) , lower wind ( bass clarinet and bassoon ) , cello ( and contrabass ) , piano , and percussion . 
  that leaves you with the upper wind , trumpet , violin , and viola . 
  as others have mentioned , britten 's [ young person 's guide to the orchestra ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vbvhu22uam ) is a great way to get acquainted with the instruments . 
  i think apart from the sound , you need to consider a few things . 
  what repertoire is available ( do you only want to play classical , or would you like to stretch out into some jazz and pop playing ? 
  ) , and how difficult it will be to start out with . 
  harder beginners ' instruments can sound lovely later , but if you 're not very dedicated it will be easy to give up early : only you can know whether this matters to you or not . 
  ** flute ** : i 'm sure you 've heard it many times , it 's that high pitched instrument . 
  it 's relatively easy at the beginner level , but because of that very common . 
  it 'll be much harder to get into orchestras where there are limited places . 
  however , it has repertoire in nearly any style of music . 
  baroque all the way to 20thc and film , as well as some ( but not much ) jazz , and even pop music . 
  its fairly neutral timbre makes it more suitable than most instruments for playing tunes that are n't written for it , in my opinion . 
  i do n't particularly like it 's sound as a solo instrument , personally , so i do n't have any good piece recommendations , but [ here 's a bach solo flute piece ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaj4i1l3y5m ) . 
  ** oboe ** : a very difficult instrument for beginners , so i 've heard , so if you choose it be prepared to take a long time before you sound any good . 
  it has a nasally sound , but not in a bad way . 
  because of its difficulty , if you want to join orchestras and other ensembles it will be much easier to do so than one of the more common instruments . 
  it is common in repertoire from the baroque all the way up to 20thc and film music , but you will rarely find good pop or jazz music here . 
  you can also take your oboe skill and learn the cor anglais , a lower-pitched relative of the oboe ( [ see here for an amazing cor anglais solo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=hox15agz3-0#t=46s ) ) obviously it 's possible to play tunes on it , but it does n't suit quite as well as the flute . 
  [ here is a brilliant piece written for an oboe soloist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wjhax7jmxs ) . 
  ** clarinet ** : my own instrument , and a fairly easy one for beginners . 
  it has the added advantage of being very similar in how you play it to the saxophone family , making it easy to learn those , too , once you are proficient on the clarinet . 
  the clarinet itself does n't appear in baroque music , but you 'll see it in classical through 20thc , film , and even a very good amount of jazz stuff ( have a look at artie shaw and benny goodman , in particular ) . 
  another instrument that does n't fit taking pop tunes very well , though . 
  [ here is one of the most beautiful works for the clarinet , in my opinion ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxgmork61yq ) . 
  ** bassoon ** : just a few brief notes since it 's rather large . 
  is difficult , but used in classical through 20thc and film , not much jazz or pop . 
  another instrument in high demand but low supply . 
  you 'll need to learn both the bass clef and the tenor clef , as high bassoon parts often go into the tenor clef . 
  [ the very beginning of this is a brilliant bassoon solo ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agfrwkqqbk4 ) , but very hard and unconventional . 
  ** horn ** : i 'll be brief again . 
  found from baroque to 20thc , and is huge in film , not much jazz or pop . 
  like the trumpet it may be dull in classical and early romantic music , but i 'd say less so there ( however , horn may be less interesting than trumpet for baroque ) . 
  a lovely dark mellow tone . 
  a lot less people play it , so it 's probably easier to get into ensembles , although the instrument is supposed to be a bit harder , too . 
  [ a brilliant horn concerto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lzfkeb1yw0 ) . 
  ** trumpet ** : i ca n't really speak for its difficulty at all , unfortunately , but it does n't * seem * too difficult at the beginning . 
  repertoire all the way through nearly any genre of music , including a heap in jazz , and a good amount of pop stuff ( not to mention military tunes like the last post ) . 
  in my experience there are usually less people playing brass than wind , so it may be easier to get into ensembles with the trumpet than any wind instrument other than oboe ( or bassoon , which i have left out because it 's quite large ) . 
  it 's great if you want to have a big sound with some oomph behind it . 
  it is n't the greatest solo instrument in classical music ( although there are some very good concertos , and probably sonatas too ) , but it 's brilliant in the orchestra , especially later music . 
  a lot of classical and early romantic pieces will be fairly dull for you . 
  [ here is one of the best solo works for trumpet ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asb6hfuat4g ) , in my opinion . 
  ** violin ** : if you learn this , be prepared for some very bad sounds in the first few weeks . 
  has the advantage of being both a soloist and in large groups within the orchestra . 
  it has a lot of great repertoire from baroque through 20thc and film , with a small amount of jazz , and a fair amount in pop . 
  it 's also very good for playing tunes written for other instruments/singer . 
  if you play the violin in an orchestra , you 'll be getting most of the melodies in baroque and classical music , and probably romantic , too . 
  it also has some great solo repertoire , with a huge number of [ concertos ] ( http://euge.ca/2012/05/11/tonic-roots/ ) , sonatas , quartets and solo works . 
  because orchestras need a lot of violins , there 's always good demand for them . 
  on the other hand , it 's probably the most popular orchestral instrument , so do n't learn it if you like being different . 
  [ here 's a great solo piece for violin ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjuqd6rr2m8 ) , but check out quartets and symphonies for two other completely different takes on the violin . 
  ** viola ** : the butt of many jokes , it was originally played by people who could n't play violin well enough . 
  it actually has a really beautiful sombre sound , but most of the time you wo n't be playing anything very interesting . 
  it 's needed in baroque through 20thc , as well as film music , but not in jazz or pop very much . 
  like the violin , orchestras need a lot of them , and you can play in string quartets , but there is less solo material available .
