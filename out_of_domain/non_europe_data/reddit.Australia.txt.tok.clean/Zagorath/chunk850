  actually , now that i think about it , it probably would n't be too much work to allow a list of members either . 
  page - l `` member_one member_two member_three '' `` for debate '' ` or something like that . 
  i 'll have to see how python handles command line arguments . 
  hear , hear, 
  i actually think origin as a platform is way better than steam . 
  its only downside is the fact that it does n't really have as many games on it . 
  i avoid uplay like the plague . 
  personally i do n't care for steam 's community features . 
  i think steam 's community is pretty toxic anyway . 
  for me , the interface to find and buy a games , and the customer support , are way more important than community stuff . 
  i 'll defer to the clerk on this , but if he 's okay with it , then i am . 
  link to the thread ? 
  that may be useful for the fbi , but for the average person , their * intent * matters far more . 
  and besides , this is still counting the people who were injured by it , so it 's not like this is disregarding the effects of their actions . 
  cheers, 
  the closest thing in 5e would be inspiration . 
  it 's awarded basically for cool roleplay , and grants `` advantage '' on a roll of the player 's choice ( roll 2d20 and choose the highest , instead of just 1d20 ) . 
  android absolutely * is * a brand . 
  it 's obviously different from apple , which is the company that manufactures their own devices , but one definition of `` brand '' ( and the most important one in this case ) is :, 
   a name , symbol , logo , or other item used to distinguish a product or service, 
  which absolutely applies to android . 
  in particular , many people specifically choose a phone because it has android on it . 
  that 's pretty much the definition of a brand . 
  as for the relative size or whelmness of it , i think you 're just kidding yourself . 
  have you ever tried looking at an android forum shortly after an apple announcement ? 
  compare it to an apple forum after a big google announcement . 
  the former is rather quite shocking , and personally it makes me a little ashamed to call myself an android fan , because other android fans are * way * worse these days than apple fans are . 
  the problem with this thinking is that it really , * really * applies * only * to great old one warlocks . 
  the whole * point * of playing a fiend or fey warlock is that the patron * does * have an impact on your life . 
  otherwise , you 're just playing a lame sorcerer . 
  you 're absolutely right that the warlock should n't overshadow other characters because of this , but a non-goo warlock that * does n't * have its patron impact the story in some way is a wasted character in many ways . 
  it can easily be balanced out by having characters or events from the other characters ' backstories also impact the plot , which honestly is a pretty basic idea that can benefit * any * campaign . 
  as for the idea of their fallibility or lack thereof , i would say look at the canonical examples . 
  probably the most well-known warlock in dungeons & dragons lore would be farideh from the brimstone angels series ( you 'll note that in the 5e player 's handbook , books in this series are referenced as the quote for both the dragonborn and the tiefling racial entry ) . 
  her patron is lorcan , a cambion , or half devil . 
  and while he usually tries to come across as infallible to farideh , he absolutely is n't in control of everything , as he vies to keep his toril thirteen intact , as well as keep himself safe from more powerful devils like those working for glasya , archduchess of the 6th . 
  that 's not necessarily something that needs to be brought to the game , but a dm should be aware of it , and maybe put tiny little hints of that sort of thing in , purely as an easter egg . 
  not because i actually like it , but because the amateur orchestra and choir i play in does it every * single * year in their christmas concert . 
  and it 's the only palestrina i know . 
  okay so [ this is n't the same scenario ] ( http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/182897/theme-libraries-yml-having-no-effect?noredirect=1#comment221417_182897 ) , but it 's very clearly an example of an overzealous mod all the same . 
  there were a number of extremely useful comments provided that helped eke out a partial solution ( which , because of how they came about , simply * could not * have been a straight forward `` answer '' ) , as detailed by the edit . 
  i attempted to report the mod for their abuse , but because they are a mod , they simply intercepted that report and dealt with it themselves : a clear conflict of interest that should not have been allowed . 
  i ca n't even post in meta about it because the same mod ( presumably : it could have been someone else ) decided to downvote the question , and se has all these stupid rules about who can and can not participate in which areas of discussion ( whether it be in the meta , or posting comments on other questions , or even just upvoting and downvoting answers ) based on their `` reputation '' bullshit . 
  like i said , the community is absolutely toxic . 
  there are good users on there for sure : `` no sssweat '' and `` ivan drago '' both really helped , but because this one dickhead mod gets to control everything , and they can just * delete * the responses and then * lock * the whole thing , preventing * any * further discussion , good content gets lost .

  sure , but the user that did that was likely just as frustrated as i. 
  there 's simply * no real way * to actually call out the abusive mod . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , a little misuse of the feature in order to do * something * to call them out feels justified . 
  regarding so vs. 
  se , the problem is that this type of thing is * possible * and that there is little that can be done to prevent it , because mods and power users have complete power to lock threads , delete content , etc. 
  as they wish , and new users ca n't even complain about it in meta . 
  order !, 
  those in the gallery will refrain from interrupting . 
  why does he place it on the outside to begin with ? 
  we 're talking about him as a sith lord , rather than him as emperor of the galaxy . 
  i always read title case as really stilted speech . 
  like they 're emphasising every word they say and speaking in a sort of staccato manner .
