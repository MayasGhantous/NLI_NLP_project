  meta : this was the bill that expands the gst so that it includes private education and healthcare . 
  it 's very much a bill targeted at increasing tax paid by the wealthy : those who are choosing to use the private system rather than the publicly funded system , which remains tax free . 
  by leave , the question is proposed : that the clauses and schedules , as amended , be agreed to , and that this bill be read now a third time .

  i 'm not really a huge fan of this . 
  it 's an awesome idea , but i just feel it 's too powerful when taken by spellcasters and ranged users , especially if , as has been my experience 99 % of the time , they just stand out of the way and rain down fire . 
  it 's basically a feat that says `` you get +1 ac '' . 
  maybe if you were to flip it around so that instead of being if you have 5 ft. movement remaining , it was that the average character only * moved * 5 ft. , it would n't be quite as bad . 
  have it say `` if you have 30 ft. of movement remaining '' instead . 
  even that 's still very , very powerful , but it would at least be somewhat more tempered . 
  this race looks * insanely * underpowered . 
  i 'm on my phone so i ca n't do it in detail , but i do n't think it could possibly score more than a +4.0 on the race guide , and i 'd be more likely to guess it 's around a +3.0 . 
  at the very least , i would suggest adding a +1 to wisdom or something , and maybe a small spellcasting type bonus , like a free cantrip , or maybe the full cantrip +2 spells like the tiefling and aasimar get . 
  i ca n't even get marshmallow :(, 
  i hate when they do this and claim it 's `` piece x in the style of composer y '' . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's `` piece x meshed with piece z by composer y '' . 
  that 's not a bad thing , and these pieces are absolutely astonishingly good . 
  i just hate the way they 're so frequently misrepresented . 
  his happy birthday meshed with beethoven piano sonata no. 14 in c # ( moonlight ) was particularly good , as was the happy blue danube . 
  i really enjoyed the mozart one too , though i do n't know his works well enough to be able to say what piece it was . 
  the shostakovich at the end was just hilarious . 
  sure , [ here it is ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  it 's not official , but i 've found it to be mostly very good . 
  there are a few wonky things , like how it treats flight and swim speeds i do n't really agree with , but most of it is very useful . 
  it 's important that it be used only as a guide though , and not gospel . 
  and i definitely do n't think it should be used as a starting point . 
  instead , do essentially what you 've done here . 
  build it how you think it should be done , and * then * see if it feels like it needs more or less . 
  i 'd take it over war caster without a second thought . 
  as for the asi , it would depend . 
  if i 'm already at 18 in my casting stat at level 1 , i would very strongly consider it at level 4 . 
  if i was a variant human , it would probably be my number one choice . 
  but honestly , my opinion has mellowed a little since i left that comment . 
  i still think it 's very strong , but i do n't think it 's necessarily light years ahead of other choices . 
  my biggest worry is the idea of combining lots of feats together to get insane ac . 
  but even then , this plus dual wielder only add up to be equal to a shield , and that 's * if * you 're dual wielding , which is n't the best mesh mechanically with the bonuses this feat grants . 
  but still , perhaps a requirement of at most half your movement used or something like that . 
  i do think all but 5 feet is a little too generous . 
  max movement , not min . 
  i 'm sure we 'll get it in the future . 
  the demon ~ ~ stration ~ ~ stuff is there because of the out of the abyss storyline . 
  edit : lol autocorrect, 
  i 'm pretty certain you only get a +1 every second level , but i do agree that the wording could be tightened up a little , because the other interpretation does n't seem to be completely ruled out , the way it 's currently worded .

  creatures of a much lower level than one could expect gods to be have ` legendary resistance ' , wherein a few times per day , they can automatically * choose * to succeed on a saving throw on which they originally failed . 
  it 's designed exactly to prevent this kind of thing . 
  if there were stats for gods , you can * bet * that they would have a few of these up their sleeves . 
  [ and the dndgreentext thread for the former ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dsor5/the _ wizard_who_destroyed_all_psions / ) , [ and the latter ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2hpuvq/old _ man_henderson_wins_call_of_cthulhu_full_story / ) , if anyone wants to see some conversation that has been had about them . 
  it 's also a trending subreddit , so congrats on that . 
  is that just because of it being featured as part of the network , or has it been linked somewhere else ?

  blame the clerk for that :p, 
  fixed . 
  yeah , the best place to find an archive of useful wizards stuff is the / r/dndnext [ resource list ] ( / r/dndnext/wiki / resourcelist ) , because the official wizards site is terrible . 
  mike mearls left a comment in the / r/dnd thread :, 
   it 's tricky giving summoning spells to the warlock . 
  anything at 5th level or below , and it becomes an encounter spell . 
  that can cause havoc with summons or other ongoing effects . 
   since the article has spells that spread across levels 1 - 5 and 6 - 9 , and the hook with demon summoning is that it 's cheaper level wise but more dangerous , i opted away from giving the spells to the warlock . 
   that said , slotting them in via mystic arcanum would work fine . 
   you also have +2 to dexterity ( acrobatics ) rolls in dim light . 
  not very in line with the spirit of 5e , this . 
  i would suggest giving advantage , or maybe just giving proficiency in acrobatics . 
  everything else looks really good . 
  pretty decent balance . 
  the base race is probably about a +3.5 , with the subraces mostly at +2.0 . 
  i 'd say the cathay are a little stronger at +2.5 , but that 's still well within acceptable levels , and the tojay are only +1.5 , which is rather weak . 
  i feel like you 've done a really good job of differentiating these and making them feel unique , as well as keeping balance reasonable . 
  nobody gets advantage or persuasion . 
  did you mean deception ? 
  even so , i agree that that feels *** really *** strong . 
  dwarves and gnomes have three subraces .
