  elves have four already , and three of those are even in the phb . 
  os x ( n.b. 
  : they dropped the `` mac '' part from the name a while back ) is still an operating system . 
  they just package the installer in an app that gets downloaded from the app store . 
  i 'd stay away from saving throws . 
  so far , that has been the exclusive domain of classes . 
  i would n't recommend breaking that . 
  and i do n't think medicine is that bad . 
  it 's used to stablise creatures if you do n't have healing or magic . 
   mister terrific and doctor light . 
  liberty belle, 
  who and who ? 
  kid flash ? 
  where 's he ? 
  and we have hal jordan as a person confirmed , but nothing to indicate that he 's actually a green lantern , so i would n't count him either . 
  personally i thought he looked fine except for the face . 
  the face was way too human for my tastes , it just looked dumb . 
  the rest of the body was fine , and the powers looked * awesome * . 
  but the face was just awful . 
  op 's is higher quality , and is a gifv so it loads faster . 
  yeah that really bugged me . 
  the four or so cables can hold up an elevator with a dozen people in it , but one of them ca n't hold a single person ? 
  i 'm sorry , but no . 
  even after an earthquake or explosion , just no . 
  less evil ? 
  he 's just starting out , but i do n't think he 's really less evil . 
  he just has n't had the chance to show his true colours yet . 
  he 's already had people killed just to show up supergirl . 
  sure , but we need an * in character * reason for it . 
  you 've given the obvious doylist explanation , but we 're looking for a watsonian one . 
   white martians ... warlike counterparts to the peaceful green martians, 
  hey !, 
  white martians [ are n't all bad ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/youngjustice/images/7/71/white_martian.png/revision/latest?cb=20120427112146 ) !, 
  i love you . 
  i 'm downvoting you for that stupid fucking meme , but upvoting because jimmy olsen is n't heavy enough to snap elevator cables . 
  jimmy olsen is wolverine confirmed ? 
  it definitely did originally . 
  i dunno if it still does though . 
  it may be one of those things where what was previously an acronym becomes just a name . 
  i think ces ( previously consumer electronic show ) did the same thing a few years ago . 
  oh cool , thanks !, 
  i did n't see any images of him * without * those , because i stay away from promotional material . 
  i 'm sure he does look a lot worse without that . 
  but honestly , [ my favourite incarnation of him ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/youngjustice/images/f/f4/red_tornado_powers.png/revision/latest?cb=20111203190401 ) does n't really have much in the way of human facial features * at all * , and i think that would have been a * much * better look to go for . 
  just a full facial mask , like anthony daniels had to wear for c-3po . 
  cast , but not appeared . 
  green lantern is perhaps a better case , because as you say , we do already know that he 's `` disappeared '' . 
  but for now , that could be no more than an easter egg , it depends on whether or not they can get the rights to the character down the line . 
  unless there 's some overwhelming evidence to the contrary , i would certainly * not * assume the green lantern film is a part of the arrowverse . 
  the events of that film were far too substantial for it to be believable that it occurred in this universe . 
  plus , i 'm sure they mention a date at least at some point in that film , and it probably was too early for it to fit in the arrowverse . 
  til how to spell nota bene . 
  instantaneous current , as in the current at an exit moment ( it gets used as a function of time ) . 
  lower case v gets used in the same way . 
  so you 'll have i ( t ) and v ( t ) . 
  imaginary numbers also get used with ac , as they represent the phase of the current . 
  the question is put : that the clauses and schedules , as amended , be agreed to , and that this bill be now read a third time .

  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for vote on tax laws amendment, 
  3fun 's is the only remaining amendment though , right ? 
  meta , edit : wait , senators vote ? 
  why was i paged exactly ( as well as this_guy and phylli ) ? 
  i was having a dig at him for writing `` senators '' . 
  would you like to move that this be voted on in the current thread , now ? 
  a great place to start with / r/dndgreentext is the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which is where many of the greatest stories are found . 
  the short ones tend to be the funny ones ( though not all of them are : some of them get surprisingly deep and emotional ) , but the long ones are great , too . 
  a couple of the long ones are * really * long , but are totally worth it in my opinion . 
  i 'd just recommend reading them a little bit at a time , over the course of a few days . 
  [ stranded ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) and [ demigods ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2k1qjk/demigods _ xpost_gametales / ) are particularly like this . 
  what are the other two questions ? 
  it kinda makes sense this way when you think about it . 
  on both axes , `` up '' is ` more towards what is generally considered `` better '' ' . 
  hmm ... no , i do n't think that 's really possible . 
  the result of the first aspect may affect how people vote on the second , which in turn may affect the third . 
  the question is put : that this bill be now read a second time .
