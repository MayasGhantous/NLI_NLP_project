  ### i think the ayes have it, 
  this bill will be now read a second time .

  what contributions ? 
  yeah , to be honest , that advice is nice , but it * really * does * not * apply to warlocks . 
  warlocks are n't to be thought of as `` casters '' in the way wizards , sorcerers , or even bards and clerics , are thought of . 
  i 've heard some describe warlocks as `` arcane archers '' , which is a fair description . 
  you 're mostly about the eldritch blast ( agonising blast is pretty much a * must have * , and repelling blast is far more useful than one might think at first ) , with potential for a little bit more burst or control . 
  i like to save at least one of my spells for more of a social or non-combat situation , though refreshing on a short rest means i 'll still shoot a couple of fireballs , or a fireball and a scorching ray , if i feel the need in combat . 
  i disagree ( edit : disagree about it being `` only situationally useful '' . 
  i agree that ab is better ) . 
  i thought that would be the case , so i did n't take it at first . 
  but i picked it up later on , and i 've found that it 's actually * incredibly * useful . 
  pushing people off cliffs , off boats , away from weaker allies , away from * me * ( with two blasts , it means that i 've got a pretty decent chance of hitting even with disadvantage for being in melee , and then i can get away without provoking opportunity attacks ) . 
  and , it synergises * really * nicely with an ally who has polearm master . 
  while being forced to move * away * does n't provoke oas , in practice , it means that the enemy is `` forced '' ( but they 're doing it of their own free will ) to move * into * the fighter 's range on their next turn , which * does * provoke an oa , so it 's a way of helping my ally get extra attacks . 
  synergises doubly well if they have the feature that means on a hit , the enemy 's speed is reduced to zero ( not sure where this one comes from ) , especially since , as a polearm user , that would mean the enemy ca n't reach them . 
  it 's definitely secondary to agonising blast , but i 'd put repelling blast as possibly the third best option out there for a tomelock . 
  you should n't need to . 
  those are the sorts of things that players should be taking initiative on and going after themselves . 
  it 's cross platform , for one . 
  you 'll need to move it in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaushr/comments/3vqlij/274a_resumption_of_appropriation_bill_no_1/ ) , as a top level comment .

  he was asked to do this . 
  the honourable prime minister will remember to address his comments to the chair .

  [ here is the dndgreentext story referenced in this ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 35cqbv/the _ divines_chapter_one_on_demigods_and_masochism / ) . 
  this is consideration in detail . 
  i was under the impression that debate was less formal than at other times . 
  actually , i believe this is more of an issue with speaking out of turn in general . 
  the member for the northern territory will refrain from interrupting . 
  the honourable prime minister will remember to direct his comments to the chair . 
  i had a class in high school where we did that . 
  we used tables for layout . 
  * tables * . 
  * for layout * . 
  paging / u/jnd-au, 
  yeah sure ? 
  i thought this was after the cid , to decide finally if it will or will not be included ? 
  oh totally . 
  it 's basically * necessary * in word . 
  but word does n't * aim * for the sort of separation between content and presentation that is considered good design on the web . 
  there 's no equivalent in word of css . 
  meta : okay , to speed things up , i think you should copy the same wording this_guy did with his top-level comment lower down in this thread , and seek leave that debate can be stopped and the amendment agreed to simultaneously . 
  by leave , the question is proposed : that the bill be now read a third time .

  this one just reached a majority . 
  whoops . 
  copy-paste fails me again . 
  edited, 
  wait , it was read an hour ago ? 
  but it was n't at a majority an hour ago . 
  edit : wait , it may have been ... 
  do n't forget to receive a call with your ringer on full blast . 
  it 's absolutely * essential * . 
  just a tip , you got your syntax backwards . 
  links go \\ [ square brackets first ] ( https://then.the.link.in.normal.brackets.next ) . 
  in the early-to-mid 00s perhaps . 
  i took my igcse ict exam in 2010 , when it most certainly was no longer best practice . 
  these days , all layout should be through css . 
  html is only for the actual content . 
  yeah , but i did n't do this in the 90s . 
  my igcse ict exam was in 2010 . 
  the member for western australia is in order . 
  there is no point of order . 
  the deputy prime minister will retract his statements comparing the member for western australia to mao . 
  made by the wonderful / u/the _ singular_anyone , imo one of the ( if not * the * ) best homebrewers we have on here . 
  i do n't have my dmg with me , but from memory that 's meant for designed npcs , not pcs . 
  a +2 and two - 4s is a terrible design for a pc race . 
  high dex is a staple of skeletons and has been for quite a while . 
  i 'm not actually sure why it is , but probably something to do with the image we have of them as archers . 
  you 're right that it probably does n't make an enormous amount of sense . 
  it 's very specifically about d&d and other roleplaying games . 
  it 's really more about the games and stories than specifically about the greentext format , though a lot of the recent content has been greentext . 
  a good place to start is [ the subreddit 's hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which has a lot of the best and most iconic stories that have been shared . 
  you 'll notice that a lot of them actually are n't in the greentext format , especially the longer ones . 
  a few of the long ones , particularly [ stranded ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) and [ demigods ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2k1qjk/demigods _ xpost_gametales / ) are ** really ** long . 
  they absolutely worth it , but you might want to read them over the course of a few days , a little bit at a time . 
  in short , yes . 
  the member for western australia used the term `` sprouting lies '' in relation to statements that he wished for the honourable deputy prime minister to withdraw , which i understood to be the reference to mao . 
  the honourable prime minister will resume his seat .

  it can all be done in css , and it * should * be done in css . 
  tables should only ever be used to display tabular data .
