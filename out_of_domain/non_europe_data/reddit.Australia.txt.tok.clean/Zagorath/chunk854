  using tables to get the layout right is considered * extremely * bad design these days . 
  content should be kept separate from layout . 
  html has all of your content in it , but should do nothing to specify how the page will look ( except insofar as it imports the css stylesheets ) , with css doing all of the display : what types of fonts you 're using , colours , and where things are positioned on screen . 
  cas has n't been assessed by hours since * at least * 2012 , probably earlier . 
   try to do an ab initio language if you can, 
  disagree . 
  yes , they 're easier , but you should be selecting subjects to * learn * , not to get high point scores . 
  if you 've got a few years of experience with a language , you should continue that . 
   standard is not worth your time if you do n't need it at uni, 
  * vehemently * disagree . 
  if you * at all * can , you should do at least sl maths . 
  it 's a proper course that teaches far more interesting stuff . 
   business management - higher or standard - is waaaay easy in comparison to other group 3 subjects, 
  it 's also kind of a dumb course . 
  if you 're interested in that area , take economics instead and take a more directly business type of course at uni . 
  bm is not well regarded by universities compared to other group 3 subjects , and frankly it 's better if you have the breadth of knowledge first . 
   if you 're not big on creative subjects , do n't do one . 
  definitely agree . 
  personally i think this is dumb design on ib 's part ( why should * everyone * have to do two languages , and * everyone * have to do a humanity , but oh , you can do an art if you feel like it , i guess ; either everything should be compulsory , or everyone should be allowed to pick a single group -- any group -- not to do , but i digress ) , but take advantage of it if you do n't like the arts . 
   try not to do a higher science unless you really need it . 
  wow , just wow . 
  this is by far the * worst * piece of advice you 've given . 
  if you like the sciences , do a higher level science . 
  if you 're interested in basically any `` tem '' ( from stem ) field , take hl physics . 
  even if you do n't specifically end up using physics , it 's an absolutely fascinating subject and incredibly worthwhile . 
  it 's also something that will be well respected by universities . 
  i 'm doing software engineering , for example : a field that never uses any physics , but it was still definitely worthwhile . 
  if you 're interested in medicine , do hl chemistry , and maybe also bio . 
  and there are lots of other good reasons to do an hl science . 
   when the time comes to select your ee topic , try go for english lit . 
  english , history , geography , and economics ( as long as it 's micro ) are the best subjects to do your ee in . 
  avoid the sciences like the plague , and avoid maths even more . 
   when you get work assigned fucking start it that day, 
  yes . 
   work hard from the beginning, 
  yes, 
   be on your best behaviour in class - engage in discussions , raise your hand , try not to slack off and show your teachers that you actually give a shit . 
  ** fuck yes ** . 
   try to finish most , if not all , your cas in your first year, 
  cas does n't work like that , and has n't for a long time . 
  you are * required * to continue making an effort with your cas activities all the way through ib . 
  there 's no `` front loading '' . 
  well , i guess there is * some * useful content coming out of that whole damn `` adventurer 's league '' thing wizards seems to love so much . 
  this whole article is brilliant . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  i 'd be careful with that . 
  i think i would actually have found it * easier * if i had written my own story rather than trying to start with phandelver ( and i think phandelver is an * exceptionally * good pre-written campaign ) . 
  keeping players within the bounds of what is written , without actually railroading them , is really hard . 
  when you 're doing your own thing , you do n't need to do that . 
  you only need to steer them back so they eventually get to a satisfying end . 
  with a prewritten campaign , they need to be fairly linear . 
  also , if you 've written it yourself , you will either ( a ) know everything about the campaign that you need to know , because you 've written it yourself and it 's just naturally easier to remember that , or ( b ) can make stuff up on the fly without worrying . 
  with a pre-written campaign , you ca n't make up nearly as much stuff on the fly , because you do n't want to muddle things up * too * much with the story or it 'll become even harder to run . 
  and it can be harder to remember , because it 's just human nature that it 's harder to remember stuff that you 've read than stuff you made up yourself . 
  note , i 'm * not * trying to say that pre-written campaigns are bad . 
  i love phandelver , and i think it 's a fantastic tool to use , especially for a beginner dm ( as i was when i ran it ) . 
  i just want to try and dispel the myth that pre-written campaigns are these magical things where you can get away with minimal preparation and do n't need to worry . 
  depending on you , your players , and the specific campaign , it can * sometimes * be easier to do your own thing than to use a campaign . 
  there are advantages and very real disadvantages * either * way you go about it . 
  i think you meant `` i.e. 
  '' , rather than `` aka '' , but holy fuck this dude is old . 
  g. h. w. bush is god confirmed ? 
   people keep saying that cas program is n't measured by hours ` anymore ', 
  that 's what everyone was saying at my school when i started ib in 2010 ( exams may 2012 ) . 
  \\* shrug \\*, 
  no , `` aka '' means `` also known as '' . 
  it gets used when referring to a person or thing that is `` also known '' by a different name or title . 
  it should n't be used when simply saying that two things are equivalent ( as you have here ) or ( and this is an extremely common misuse of the term ) attempting to emphasise certain traits of it ( for example , `` g. h. w. bush , aka the father of the worst us president to date '' would be wrong : nobody actually * calls * g.h.w. 
  bush `` father of the worst us president to date '' ) . 
  it 's certainly not quite as clear as when people misuse `` i.e. '', 
  when they should have used `` e.g. 
  '' , but this is still not really a correct use of the term . 
  aka should be used when something truly is * also known * as what you 're saying . 
  when it 's an alternate description that someone might apply as a unique identifier of the thing they are describing . 
  it 's not if you 're providing a description which can apply to the thing , but is just a general explanation that can also apply to other things . 
  oh god mate , you would n't believe how many times i 've had to struggle against swiftkey to get `` i.e. '', 
  to come out right . 
  i 'm actually using it right now . 
  this keyboard is meant to be so easy to use and intelligent , but it * refuses * to learn `` i.e. 
  '' , and also does n't like unusual casing like `` pcs '' , or * any acronym pluralised * . 
  hear , hear !, 
  ( incidentally , * not * `` here , here '' . ), 
  spoilers do n't work in titles , that 's all . 
  also if you 're on a water-based campaign , with ships etc. , the destroy half of create or destroy water could be useful for bailing out your ship . 
  but i agree , most of the time it 's pretty useless . 
  good thing is , as a cleric , you can just decide at the start of the day `` yeah , i think i 'll grab that spell today '' . 
   wizards actually does n't give that much attention the al, 
  huh ? 
  you 're talking about the company that decides to stop anyone * except * their precious `` local gaming stores '' from selling their books for a couple of weeks after they 've released them . 
  no , because wizards creates all this stuff but keeps it exclusive to people playing in the stupid `` organised play '' stuff . 
  nah mate , you 're fine . 
  there 's no actual * rule * saying that things have to be greentext . 
  though i will say , if you could upload those files somewhere that people do n't have to download them to disk to view , you 're probably going to get more people using them . 
  google drive is a great really popular solution . 
  paging / u/jnd-au,

  there is no point of order .
