  paging / u/jnd-au to make sure this is okay ( before i page anyone else ) . 
  clerk / u/jnd-au , ring division bells for four minutes . 
  the doors must remain open . 
  a member may leave the area of members ' seats unless he or she called for the division . 
  after four minutes have elapsed the doors shall be locked and no member may enter or leave the chamber until after the division . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  members voting `` aye '' to move to the right side of the chair , and the members voting `` no '' to move to the left . 
  ( meta : reply telling me which side to which you moved . ), 
  no member may move from his or her place from the commencement of the count until the result of that division is announced . 
  # the doors will be locked at 1500\u00a011/12 / 2015 , utc +10 with the final count, 
  members on my right ( ayes ) | members on my left ( noes ) | members not yet present,

  a division is called on the second reading of the superannuation bill '', 
  yay . 
  fun times . 
  meta : perhaps you meant to say `` right hand side '' ? 
  [ ^ ( i believe this was the last division we had ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaushr/comments/3jwfss/171_motion_of_censure_and_no_confidence_in_the/cutte6c ), 
  if it is combined into one and the ayes win , that would mean 3fun 's amendment is accepted and then we go to a vote on the next reading , right ? 
  what if the noes win ? 
  the amendment fails , but then we would have to separately put that the schedule be agreed to , right ? 
  my intention ( and the reason for the three answers ) was to do that in one vote . 
  first they vote on whether or not to accept 3fun 's amendment , and then they vote whether or not they would accept that the schedule as amended be agreed to in both the case where 3fun 's amendment passes , and where it does not . 
  but a normal likert scale makes so much more sense than this one . 
  the wording on this survey does n't make any sense . 
  why is `` somewhat important '' * less * than neutral ? 
  it should have been something like :, 
  ` not important -  somewhat not important -  neutral -  somewhat important -  very important `, 
  where there 's a clear progression from least important to most important . 
  ah right , cheers .

  whereas google now is the plain looking nerd with exactly zero personality , but by god is she smart . 
  it certainly * can * be friendly , but that is n't the norm . 
  the other comments provide great explanations , but i would * highly * recommend the book brimstone angels , by erin m. evans . 
  part of the prelude of the book is quoted in the phb 's tiefling quote ( and part of a later book in the series is the quote for the dragonborn ) . 
  the main character is a tiefling warlock whose patron starts out simply wanting to obtain a toril thirteen ( a collection of 13 warlocks descended from each of the 13 original tieflings who made a pact with asmodeus ) -- though you do n't actually find that out until part way through the book . 
  the book provides some * really * interesting insight into the nature of the warlock pact , and some background on one potential motivation for a fiend to maintain a pact with a warlock . 
  i have n't read further in the series yet , but from [ comments from the author ] ( / r/fantasy/comments / 2jwrkr/im _ fantasy_author_erin_m_evansama / clg2w80?context = 1 ) and the way it seemed to develop within the first book , i suspect the nature of their relation may change to a much more cordial one ( at least , as far as the relation between any fiend and humanoid can be cordial ) . 
  it was really interesting from a character development perspective . 
  the actual story is nothing special , but because of the character development , i thought it was a great read ( or listen , would be more appropriate , since i listened to the audiobook rather than grabbing a paper copy ) . 
  [ this comment from a while ago ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 31j7w0/nontraditional _ warlock_ideas / cq2evb9 ) is another pretty interesting concept for a warlock , and you can imagine her having a very different relationship with her patron than something more traditional . 
  there are a few other decent ideas in that thread , too . 
  the member should be aware that the time for this vote has expired . 
  full stop bro . 
  you sure that 's true ? 
  i remember amell saying that * he * did n't know who it was , but i do n't recall the writers saying the same . 
  even if they did claim it , i very much doubt that they were telling the truth . 
  one does n't just decide to kill off * a * major character without having a plan of who it is and how it will come about narratively . 
  my step 1 : go outside, 
  step 2 : go for a run . 
  step 0 was : do n't live in a place where it gets stupid cold . 
  in winter where i currently live , it gets to * maybe * 3 or 4 degrees over night -- that 's an extreme case . 
  even in winter , the days are generally sitting around 18 -- 20 or so . 
  for me it 's more `` oh shit , i 've got it set it km/h instead of min/k '' . 
  i 'm left handed , so wearing my watch on the right wrist is normal for me . 
  to be honest , my unpopular opinion ( though it 's not an unpopular * running * opinion , more of a / r/southpaw unpopular opinion ) is that lefties who wear their watch on their left wrist are traitorous . 
   i will not be listing those thresholds . 
  list them or get out of here . 
  you do n't come to the unpopular opinion thread to * not * share your potentially unpopular opinions !, 
  oh right . 
  her 's my potentially unpopular ( at least on / r/running , probably not so much with the wider running community ) opinion : runners should always use metric . 
  the question is put : that the bill be now read a third time . 
  members may vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease no later than 0300\u00a012/12 / 2015 , utc +10 .

  i normally would n't bother to share it , but i have a pretty anti-strength-training mentality . 
  i just do n't get the point . 
  cardio is what keeps you able to do simple things like walk briskly between places without feeling tired , it helps you get what i consider a better looking body ( this is obviously just personal taste , but i find overly muscly people offputting ) , and i 've met way too many people who were into weight lifting that were just generally douchey people that i 've built up a negative association with it . 
  plus , humans are just naturally * built * for cardio . 
  also , running is way more fun than weight lifting . 
  so are swimming and cycling . 
  how so ? 
  i 'm totally with you on everything there . 
  i ca n't stand running with earphones on .
