  i also ca n't stand to run with my phone in my pocket . 
  hell , i ca n't even run with my * keys * in my normal pockets : i take out * just * the key to my front door , and it goes in the tiny pocket on the inside of the running shorts . 
  too much weight jiggling around in normal waist pockets is weird . 
  and on top of that , while i normally run on a path , for the parts of the run that go across a road , or when my run takes me mostly on the road , being able to hear what 's going on around just feels so much safer . 
  but for what it 's worth , the `` wire annoyingly jiggling '' can be at least partially mitigated by running it up the * inside * of your shirt . 
  as i said , i do n't run with them on , so i ca n't speak to how well it works for that , but i 've taken to doing it in normal use ever since i got a flat cabled set of earphones ( flat cabled -  non-tangle , but has the disadvantage that when it bumps up against your shirt , it sends a loud noise up the earphones : putting it on the inside prevents that since it ca n't move around ), 
  a great place to start is [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which contains a lot of the best stories . 
  a couple of the ones in the `` long '' section are ** really ** long . 
  [ stranded ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) and [ demigods ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2k1qjk/demigods_xpost_gametales/ ) , in particular . 
  but trust me , they 're * so * worth it . 
  you may just want to read them over a few days , reading a few pages or so at a time . 
  the other long ones are only long in comparison to the typical `` short '' one , and can be comfortably read in a few minutes at most . 
   that 's like concerts offering pre-sale tickets to fans before offering them to the general public, 
  it 's nothing like that at all , because with a concert you do n't get to * see the concert * early if you go to the right seller . 
  the problem with it is that it is fundamentally disconnected with the way the modern world works . 
  granted , wizards has shown themselves very frequently not to be the most up-to-date ( just look at their attempts or lack thereof when it comes to online or software tools ) , but this sort of timed exclusive to purchase a physical item is just harmful . 
  they do n't even really make any attempts to provide compensation for those of us outside of america and canada , where local gaming stores and that stupid `` organised play '' thing are common . 
  there are no d&d events in the city i live in , and only a handful of magic ones . 
  and it 's not like wizards actively tries to encourage places to do those things . 
  so i simply have to wait until wizards sees fit to release the books to the public . 
  or , more likely , i download a copy off the internet , because i do n't intend to wait for their timed exclusives . 
  i 've got no other option , because none of the stores in my area are apparently worthy of special treatment . 
  as a low wis character , i took spare the dying as one of my book of shadows cantrips . 
  way more useful that trying to succeed on medicine checks with +0 to the d20 . 
  yeah , it can be done . 
  it 's kinda pointless though . 
  most people come across posts from their front page , not go directly to the subreddit . 
  and the css does n't display on the front page . 
  many people also disable subreddit styles using res . 
  hiding titles often encourages users to put spoilers in titles , which should absolutely * not * be allowed . 
   stores have to earn that `` special treatment '' by showing that they can run events and have a good community -- something they should be striving for anyway, 
  see , that 's my problem . 
  i * do n't * think they should be striving for anything of the sort . 
  to me , and the general culture where i live , a store is a place where you go and buy stuff . 
  there 's no need for a `` community '' surrounding a * store * . 
  the very idea of that is just bizarre , especially if , as you said elsewhere , some stores * charge * for the `` privilege '' . 
  it makes more sense with magic , because that 's a competitive game where individual matches can be relatively swift . 
  stores can serve as a host for tournaments and the like . 
  but d&d is a collaborative game that takes place between a small number of people over many hours . 
  because of its nature , it works better among groups who know each other -- or at least will come to know each other over the course of a campaign -- so playing with strangers who may or may not come and go each week is an inherently lesser experience . 
  not to mention i 've looked over some of the rules for wizards ' organised play , and they 're stupid . 
  they feel like they 're * designed * so that people will have worse games . 
  the extent to which dms ca n't tailor the game to the players and their characters , the stupidly limited options ( banning a significant chunk of official material , and only allowing material from a single book , etc. 
  ) , etc. 
  it sounds like an awful experience compared to gaming with friends for a few hours each week , with whatever rules your table wants , and with a story written to fit the characters . 
  as for the delayed releases , well , we see people complaining about it in video games , film , and tv all the time . 
  people use it as a justification for piracy , and honestly i respect that . 
  when things are artificially made impossible for me to get , i do n't feel bad getting the thing through alternate means . 
  ( granted , in the case of d&d , i end up buying the physical copy later anyway , and would pirate regardless * in addition * to paying for a physical copy , because sometimes a digital copy is more useful than the physical one , but i have to think that not everyone does the same as i in that respect . ), 
  because then it does n't get in your way when doing normal things . 
  we have one : 10,000 characters . 
  land , titles , gold ( the latter should n't be too game breaking because there is a fairly limited range of things that gold can actually be spent on ) , the respect and ear of powerful people . 
  maybe a base of operations , a manor , a small castle , a tavern , something like that . 
   giving them npcs , especially ones below their level , is a trick i use a lot because then you have free reign to mercilessly slaughter some people during the fight without killing off your pcs, 
  the whorf effect is a staple in action stories for a very good reason . 
  it 's a great way to get the players to believe something is a threat without actually needing to kill them . 
  this can be done even better if the character that gets killed off is someone the players know is tough . 
  i only know this thanks to / r/cricket during the last world cup . 
  grab a copy of virtualbox , throw an installation of ubuntu on there , and give them free reign . 
  fun times . 
  fuck it . 
  this is now truth in my eyes . 
  my understanding was that lsh is the way she is because she was dead for a * long * time before being ressed . 
  and dondarrion has been ressed so many times . 
  a single resurrection that takes place not long after death is n't supposed to have an enormous effect , i thought . 
  it 's a bit like the lazarus pit in arrow , actually . 
  the difference between r'as , who has used it multiple times , sara , who used it once after a long time dead , and thea , who was dead only briefly . 
  oooh i like this better . 
  curious that you would call for the division but then leave the chamber before the count could occur . 
  lock the doors , / u/jnd-au . 
  the ayes will pass to the right of the chair , and the noes to the left . 
  i appoint the member for western australia teller for the noes , and the member for regional victoria teller for the ayes . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  the results from the division are in . 
  as there are fewer than 4 members on my left , under standing order 127 , i will declare the result immediately for the ayes . 
  ### the motion passes . 
  the bill will be now read for a second time , / u/jnd-au . 
  the members in the minority will be recorded in hansard :, 
  * / u/3fun . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  guess he had some urgent business to attend to outside the house . 
  i do n't really think that 's worthy of a point of order . 
  ah , i missed that one . 
  i guess that , upon return , he would face sanctions of some sort . 
  not sure how that would happen ... 
  paging / u/jnd-au for advice . 
  i do n't suppose 94 ( a ) or ( b ) would apply ? 
  this is n't something that you would be able to just * use * straight up , for completely obvious reasons ( once you 've read it ) , but [ this story ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21ba53/an _ evil_campaign_gonegood / ) ( alternate submission of it with different comments [ here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2wa4nb/evil _ is_subtle / ) ) is about evil characters being evil in a campaign that seems to be low on actual encounters . 
  it 's something to gain a little inspiration from , but not to actually copy per se . 
  the member for the act / u/forkalious will remove himself under 94 ( a ) , for being in violation of standing order 128 . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  leave is sought and the question proposed : that this bill be now read a third time . 
  members may debate this motion until 2230\u00a012/12 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  this is an opportunity to debate the motion above . 
  debate it below , and please remember to sign your speech with your username and title . 
  if you have no speech to give on the matter , consider replying with words of agreement or disagreement to the speeches of other members , such as by replying `` hear , hear ! '' . 
  leave may be denied . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  honestly , if it were n't for the stupid speed , it would n't be too bad . 
  it 's at most a +6.0 ( that 's pretending the armour problem is with 0 , instead of the -0.5 it could arguably be ) .
