  goats charge requires you to forgo your proper action in exchange for a 1d6 ( + str , i assume ? ), 
  attack as your bonus action . 
  well less than any standard attack . 
  fey ancestry is the same as elves and kin get . 
  pipes is a standard racial casting progression , like the tiefling and a few others get . 
  so , give it a normal 30 ft. movement , or maybe give it a little extra at 35 ft. , and it would be well within the standard accepted range for playable races . 
  personally , i did n't feel any serious stress about anything until about the last third of my first year of ib . 
  or people who did n't * choose * to do ib . 
  it would n't work any better in 5e than in 4e . 
  in fact , its core assumption regarding ac and to-hit values is probably a much better fit between 3.5 and 4 than 3.5 and 5 . 
  bounded accuracy is a * huge * change to the fundamental assumptions of the game . 
  stat blocks and powers are just slightly different representations of fundamentally the same concepts . 
  that really bothered me about the windows 10 upgrade . 
  all my default applications were reset . 
  i had videos opening in some bizarre new video player ( though admittedly , it did seem a step up from wmp ) , audio files opening in something different . 
  having to go through each time i encounter a new format and reset it to vlc is frustrating . 
  irish people also use the mc prefix on names ? 
  i did n't know that . 
  but yeah , i do n't typically pronounce `` mc '' the same as `` mac '' , so this joke does n't work too well . 
  fyi , you ca n't tag more than three people in a comment and have the notifications work . 
  no problem . 
  if you 're interested in more , there 's a good section in the dmg about rewards . 
  it starts with the obvious : coins , gemstones , art , magic items ( and , incidentally , that 's another possibility , find some magic items that are mostly flavour and not too powerful ) . 
  but the section most relevant here begins on page 227 , `` other rewards '' . 
  not everything is especially appropriate in this situation , for example they can get blessings from deities or other supernatural gifts . 
  but the section with the subheading `` marks of prestige '' has a lot of great stuff . 
  i 've hated feeling with permissions in windows since forever , to be honest . 
  it 's so much more awkward and difficult to work with than on unix-like systems like os x and linux , which have an incredibly elegant way of going about things . 
  mac has a full a in it , like in apple . 
  mc has a shortened `` uh '' type of sound , like you 're attempting to pronounce the m and then the c with no vowel in between . 
   the day ends at 11:59 pm or 23:59, 
  i do n't agree . 
  we do n't say you 've finished a race the moment right * before * you cross the finish line . 
  no , we say the race ends * at * the finish line . 
  in the same way , the day ends * at * 12:00 am , or 0000 . 
  that is , it ends the * moment * that time is reached . 
  i was under the impression that internally it 's a 32 bit ( or 64 bit these days , possibly ) number representing the number of seconds since midnight on 1st january 1970 . 
  the united states , canada , the united kingdom , australia , new zealand , probably ireland , i 'm not sure about that one . 
  nobody or nearly nobody who speaks english uses 24 hour time as the norm for average communication . 
  it certainly is a better system , but we have bigger time problems that need to be solved first . 
  like getting rid of fucking daylight saving . 
  i think it would also be way more convenient if we all used utc , so there would n't be any of the confusion as to when things are happening with regards to international events . 
  honestly i think * shadow realm * sounds so much more menacing than hell . 
  we know pretty much what `` hell '' means , and people do n't gear the known , they fear the unknown . 
  what on earth is the shadow realm ? 
  what happens to creatures there ? 
  no idea ; it sounds terrifying . 
  it 's almost like people can use multiple different platforms . 
  reddit is fun does it this way . 
  if your account has reddit gold , you can disable ads in the app . 
  but also , if you pay once for the app 's premium version , no apps ever . 
  well , at least part of the reason is that we ca n't add things to the hall of fame if we 've never seen them before !, 
  anyway , if you could add a comment referencing this to the [ suggestion thread ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 3mowqk/meta _ flair_and_hall_of_fame_update / ) so that i can remember to consider it next time it comes time to add new entries to the hall of fame . 
  thanks for sharing !, 
  also , if anyone wants it , [ here 's a direct link to the image ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dwtkzdq.png ) , rather than the / gallery link from the op . 
  this one works with res . 
  yeah , he really does . 
  he tweeted not so long ago that his list of banned player options includes :, 
  * evil characters, 
  * half orcs, 
  * lightfoot halflings, 
  * necromancer wizards, 
  and he 's considered banning warlocks . 
  like , what the fuck mate ? 
  * why * ? 
  personally , i do n't like the idea of banning evil , because so far my experiences with evil pcs have actually been really good ones , and i think evil gets a bad rap because it 's an easy scapegoat for terrible players in general . 
  but i at least get that ; he 's certainly far from alone in that rule . 
  the rest of it just seems stupid . 
  and it 's not just that ; following his twitter it just feels like a lot of the rules he has , and his opinions about things that he does n't explicitly * rule * on , are just terrible . 
  and yet , so many of his articles are absolutely fascinating . 
  this one is fantastic . 
  personally , i thought the premise of this one was obvious . 
  it would be * stupid * for any dm ** not ** to allow `` converting '' an interrupted long rest into a short rest . 
  but even so , i found a lot of the history he presented in this article really interesting . 
  and many of his other articles are even better , for example [ 5 simple rules for dating my teenaged skill system ] ( http://theangrygm.com/five-simple-rules-for-dating-my-teenaged-skill-system/ ) should be * required * reading for * any * dm in my opinion . 
  extremists often do that . 
  they co-opt more moderate causes that align with their views and attempt to use them as wedge issues to get more support . 
  you see the same with with the extreme left `` socialist alliance '' types and their support for student rights or environmental causes . 
  if you want guidance on how to format things as greentext or do other special formatting , [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) would be the place to look . 
  in particular , larger breaks can be put in using a blank line of '' \\*\\*\\* \\* '' . 
  normally on reddit , this creates a horizontal rule , but on this subreddit , it places a larger break . 
  ( if you want an actual horizontal rule , put two consecutive lines of '' \\*\\*\\* \\* '' . 
  however , more generally on reddit , poetry works well by , instead of creating a newline by putting a new paragraph in ( by pressing `` enter '' twice ) , instead creating a line break , by putting two spaces at the end of the line , and then only pressing `` enter '' once . 
  roses are red, 
  violets are blue, 
  i can write poetry, 
  and so can you !, 
  the pairs of lines are separated by the two spaces , while the two separate `` stanzas '' or separated by a blank line . 
  ( and this line here comes after one of those `` larger breaks '' , by putting four asterisks . ), 
  you 're being redundant with this comment . 
  i 'm a software engineer ( ing student ) , and tbh i do n't really consider it `` proper '' engineering . 
  i mean , sure , the degree is the same , and has the same requirements ( at least at my uni ) , but the actual practical application of the knowledge outside of the university environment just looks so different for software engineers than mechanical , electrical , or civil engineers , that it 's hard to see software engineering as `` real '' engineering . 
  spotify is the * only * place i had , until recently , been able to find one particular piece of relatively obscure music i was looking for , [ schubert 's grande marche funebre ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yunnoufj-8 ) . 
  and that youtube link there only went up last week . 
  just now when i went searching for it was the first time i even knew the piece was available anywhere other than spotify . 
  so yeah , they 're great in that respect . 
  honestly , i think any system * really * designed for classical music needs a substantially different metatagging system . 
  it needs to have dedicated fields for composer , opus number , piece , movement , ensemble , conductor , genre ( where `` genre '' in classical music refers to things like `` concerto '' , `` symphony '' , `` sonata '' , etc. ) . 
  classical music just fundamentally does n't fit with the `` album , artist , song '' model used by modern popular music . 
  schubert is hardly an obscure composer , but this specific piece is so obscure that until the 6th of this month , there has n't even been a version of it available on * youtube * .
