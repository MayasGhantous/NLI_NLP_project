  it 's a ( n in my opinion ) really cool little piece for piano 4 hands . 
  this particular performance is by christoph eschenbach ( whom some of you may have seen from [ his bizarre conducting of ravel 's bol\u00e9ro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlodbwuj8-s ) ) and justus frantz . 
  oooh this sounds fantastic . 
  i nearly * never * share anything on facebook , and i only occasionally click on things or comment on things others have shared . 
  my phone does n't have the facebook app , only messenger . 
  so i can really see myself using this . 
  but ... uhh ... how do i get it in english ? 
  they seem to have autodetected my location and put it in a language that i do n't speak ( which is fine : the majority of people visiting it from where i am * would * speak the language ) , and i ca n't find a button to switch languages ... amusingly , the [ `` features '' ] ( https://www.messenger.com/features ) and [ `` platform '' ] ( https://www.messenger.com/platform ) page are in english anyway , just not the main page ...

   film scores have just changed . 
  composers either are n't concerned with or are directed to forgo earlier approaches of developing themes for characters or following more traditional compositional techniques . 
   not that it 's wrong . 
  but these days film scores can only really exist within the film for which it was written . 
  for the most part , the music is all incidental and atmospheric and does n't stand well on its own . 
  from the linked thread . 
  it 's pretty much spot on in my mind , and it 's everything that 's wrong with modern film composing . 
  it 's why john williams scores are so fantastic ( and this is like 60 % if the reason i 'm super excited for the upcoming film ) , and scores by people like james horner or hans zimmer are just dull and fall flat . 
  they do n't understand what it takes to write a great film score , or they do and they 're made to ignore it and write trite shit . 
  i do n't know where morricone fits in to this . 
  i 'm not actually familiar with his works , beyond the main themes for a few of his most famous scores , like the good , the bad , and the ugly , and gabriel 's oboe . 
  but those at least have main themes that stand on their own way better than anything by zimmer ( apart from pirates , which i do n't think he wrote the main theme of ) . 
   the first measure definitely catches attention as the oboe pulls some kind of crazy stunt i do n't even know what the fuck its doing ( might not even be an oboe ) . 
  \\* cough *, 
  as a clarinetist , i 'm a touch insulted . 
  but you 're certainly right that it is a difficult extended technique , especially over the full range that it 's done in that piece . 
  as a side note , gershwin actually did n't orchestrate that himself . 
  he wrote it out into just a few staves , and had an orchestra arrange it into the full orchestra . 
  and the orchestrator also did n't tell the clarinet to gliss like that . 
  the clarinetist did it as a joke at the first rehearsal , and gershwin liked it and told him to do it for real . 
  or maybe they were just playing a game with m&m s. 
  that would be / r/dndgreentext . 
  despite the name , it 's not only for greentext , it 's for any d&d or roleplaying game stories . 
  a good place to start , if you 're interested , would be with [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which has a number of the best stories that have been shared there , including ( of course ) [ sir bearington ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2179ea/sir _ bearington / ) , but also the less-well-known [ * original * sir bearington ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2dpqop/the_original_story_of_sir_bearington/ ) , which was shared on a forum about a year before the famous greentext . 
  if `` funny '' moments are what you 're after , you may also like [ the virgin wife ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2gyu4g/the _ virgin_wife / ) or [ eric and the gazebo ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 21795a/not _ greentext_but_a_classic_eric_and_the_gazebo / ) , or perhaps [ the ballad of edgardo ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 37d520/the _ ballad_of_edgardo / ) most of the other stories are more dramatic or touching or exciting . 
  a few of the `` longer '' ones are ** really ** bloody long . 
  [ stranded ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) and [ demigods ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2k1qjk/demigods _ xpost_gametales / ) especially . 
  but ( at least imo ) they are * totally * worth it . 
  you just might want to read them a little bit at a time over the course of a few days .

  oh , i was viewing it as the opposite . 
  computer science is ( at least according to the way i interpreted the post ) doing low level things in c , whereas computer engineering is ( again , this is based on how i interpreted the * post * , not what they actually * do * ) doing high level tasks using only c. 
  til php is an elephant . 
  is that their official mascot or something ? 
  why not ? 
  because readability , that 's why not . 
  redundant brackets help make things more human readable , since not everyone has the order of operations memorised , and even if you do , it 's not something you intuitively understand , you have to take a moment to step back and think about what goes where . 
  he 's wrong . 
  that 's not by the book , that 's making shit up . 
  the duration of an hour is for the lasting effects like making symbols appear or creating simple objects or illusions . 
  the instantaneous effects are instantaneous and are not undone . 
  i do n't really see that as an issue . 
  greyhawk , mystara , and the realms are all generic fantasy . 
  generic fantasy is nice , it 's a great genre to play in , but we do n't really need multiple settings of it . 
  it 's other settings that have substantially different tones or themes , like eberron and dark sun , that have substantial value in being resurfaced . 
   let 's murder people with explosions . 
  lol, 
  wtf dude ? 
  even without reform and rehabilitation , gaol time can serve to prevent them from committing a crime again : it serves to protect others from the convicted . 
  reform and rehabilitation obviously * should * be the * primary * goal of gaol sentences , but even without that , it serves * some * purpose beyond just revenge . 
   it is n't actually part of the oath, 
  yup . 
  the closest thing to `` first , do no harm '' in the actual modern hippocratic oath would be,
