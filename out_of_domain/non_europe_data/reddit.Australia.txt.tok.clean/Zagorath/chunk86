  you 'll also have to learn to read the alto clef , which may be difficult if you want to learn another instrument because no other instruments use it . 
  [ this orchestral excerpt is one of the best viola solos ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=pigdoa6adok#t=222s ) . 
  ** cello ** : another large instrument that 's worth mentioning anyway . 
  easier for a beginner than the violin , but still not easy . 
  there is a huge amount of repertoire of all types except jazz . 
  like the bassoon , you 'll need to read from both bass and tenor clefs , and even sometimes treble clef . 
  the second most common orchestral instrument , i 'd guess , but again , orchestras need a lot of them , and they 're also used in quartets . 
  there are a lot of concertos , sonatas , and solo works , too . 
  i think it has an absolutely beautiful sound , but you can judge that yourself . 
  [ here 's one concerto for cello ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm9dpfp7-ck ) to help you . 
  in addition , it 's definitely not portable , but it 's always worth learning piano because that 's the best way to learn a lot of music theory . 
  worthwhile , but absolutely not necessary . 
  do n't you think [ also sprach zarathustra ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=lyjwbwwg8uc#t=42s ) or [ bart\u00f3k 's concerto for orchestra ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:bart%c3%b3k_-_concerto_for_orchestra_\\ ( clip \\ ) . ogg ) ( [ this is the written timpani part ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:bart%c3%b3k_-_concerto_for_orchestra_-_timpani_pedaling.png ) ) would be cooler examples ? 
  i love the descriptions you 've given for the instruments , though . 
  both very accurate , but humorous at the same time . 
  horn and clarinet were my favourite descriptions . 
  i dunno , flute 's a pretty cooperative instrument with a lot of repertoire . 
  a good ( full-sized ) electric piano is incredibly easy to play , and when you 're just learning that 's all you need really . 
  that said , i 've never considered your statement before , and it works surprisingly well overall . 
  haha that 's true , it 's pretty hilarious when you really pay attention to it . 
  and thanks !, 
  i 've just recently started actually coming to the subreddit , rather than relying on what gets to the top of my feed , so i get to see these cool gems more often . 
  i just hope op delivers and lets us know what he decided on !, 
  hence rarely , as opposed to never . 
  i love how the cellist looks at the clarinetist at the beginning ( by which i mean 1:20 ) , like he 's amazed . 
  besides , i 'm not sure i 'd call this pop or jazz . 
  from what i gather from the description and comments , it 's an arrangement by williams ( a film/20thc composer ) of a piece by copland ( 20thc with jazz influences ) , which was itself based upon a folk tune . 
  which reminds me !, 
  clarinet is great for folk music !, 
  recommendations are always greatly appreciated !, 
  i studied death and the maiden in english literature : it 's one of the only plays i 've studied that i really really loved . 
  it got me interested in the string quartet it was named after , schubert 's string quartet no . 
  14 in d minor `` death and the maiden '' . 
  i have n't actually * played * it , because i do n't play a string instrument , but a quick look over [ the score ] ( http://erato.uvt.nl/files/imglnks/usimg/6/67/imslp04047-schubertstringquartetno14.pdf ) and it seems that the viola part is n't too hard , and where it is hard it could be simplified without too much loss to the overall sound . 
  it sounds amazing , too . 
  since you consider yourself a classical music nerd , you might like / r/elitistclassical , too !, 
  damn that 's an effing brilliant idea !, 
  maybe not quite like youtube did , but more like eric whitacre did : people record their parts and someone puts them together digitally . 
  someone get on it !, 
  the problem is , most historians generally agree jesus did exist . 
  i 'm not a historian , so i do n't know what their basis is , though . 
  oh interesting . 
  there is some actual evidence , too , is n't there ? 
  even if it is somewhat tentative ? 
  huh . 
  not sure what happened there . 
  i was getting something completely different . 
  seems to be fixed now , though . 
  edit : watched it now haha . 
  yeah , definitely cool , but the first sentence of my last comment still works . 
  i 'm the same with flute , but i was mainly thinking about how they do n't have to deal with reeds or tuning , or an extensive process in putting their instrument together . 
  slightly off-topic , but why do people use that word ? 
  when it 's one on one you always hear monogamy , so why is the word polygamy so rarely used compared to polyamory ? 
  what if you like it because you like the build quality ? 
  mainly the trackpad . 
  if that was the only reason it 's be pretty stupid , but that with the software and stuff add up . 
  ah , that explains it . 
  thanks . 
  no , it is absolutely not possible to do . 
  there are two types of eb clarinet , by the way . 
  i assume you 're talking about [ the alto one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alto_clarinet ) , but there is also a [ soprano \\ ( sometimes called sopranino \\ ) eb clarinet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e-flat_clarinet ) . 
  this is smaller than the normal bb or a clarinet , and it is more common to have a soprano eb clarinet than an alto . 
  as mr lexicon has pointed out , the distances between holes are different in each clarinet , so there is no way to convert from one instrument to the other , though often mouthpieces can be reused ( i know a and bb clarinets use the same mouthpiece , for example ) . 
  yeah , i 've always thought of the cello as being highly admired amongst classical musicians , and very deserving of it at that , especially when compared with the ( in my opinion overrated ) violin . 
  i agree . 
  especially for a beginner musician , even if they do want to eventually develop to a really good amateur musician , 30 minutes practising per day , with a single 30 -- 60 minute lesson with a teacher , is plenty . 
  when you get better you 'll need to put in more practice time , up to an hour or more per day , but at first that 's not only not necessary but quite possibly counter-productive ( in that it may put you off wanting to continue ) . 
  actually , what is considered `` left '' even in those countries [ is still right of an absolute centre ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/faq#faq22 ) based on historical policies in a variety of countries . 
  like the asian bloke said , having a piano is great . 
  even a cheapish upright piano is good . 
  just remember to keep it on an * internal * wall , not a wall that goes to the outside ( and not near fireplaces , heating , or air conditioners ) because that will cause them to go out of tune faster . 
  that said , at my house i have an electric keyboard . 
  it 's important if you get one of these that it be full-sized ( both in the number of keys and in the size of each key ) , and that it have a good hefty feel to it . 
  it 's too easy to get ones that feel to light . 
  the sound quality of decent electric keyboards is amazingly close , and the only real downsides is with relation to pedalling and harmonics ( you wo n't get the additional sympathetic vibrations a piano has , and also you ca n't half pedal ) . 
  i do n't know if you already know this , but the problem in that case is n't focus , it 's camera shake . 
  he was splicing films together . 
  something tells me they did n't have bluetooth when he was doing this . 
  while i believe you that the reason she was not there because she was interested , the fact that she was doing an arts degree does n't necessarily mean she * ca n't * have been interested in engineering . 
  huh . 
  i did n't know that , thanks . 
  where i am most cinemas are fully digital , or near to it afaik . 
  yeah that 's my thought . 
  ama requests for people who have had a specific experience get answered frequently from what i 've seen . 
  i suppose there is a difference in that the internet is defranco 's * job * , and he has a real-world business that just happens to operate online ( and was founded on the back of his previous online success ) . 
  it 's a very small difference , and i do n't think it should matter , but i think that could be a theoretical justification for it . 
  if you had been asked a month or two ago , what would you say was your least favourite ? 
  before this deal with the admins . 
  you lie !, 
  i searched for blackjack and hookers on there , and neither came up with anything . 
  better the devil you know ... 
  i really wish we had, 
  a ) a time machine, 
  b ) real life save and reload functionality, 
  that way you could go back in time and see what the world would have been like if he had made it into the art school , but would n't be stuck with it/have to try and fix it if it went wrong . 
  haha that 's probably a much more efficient way of doing it . 
  true that . 
  although my phone that i bought in 2007 does n't have speakerphone , so maybe he just had a lower end phone like that ? 
  or it could be an even older story , before mobile phones or something . 
  when i read up until,
