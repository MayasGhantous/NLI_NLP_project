  ... hashing adds another 3-4 , which , in the mindset of an inexperienced dev just trying to get this thing done , is n't worth it . 
  sure , but i addressed this issue . 
  completely insecure makes sense . 
  it 's super easy to just throw your usernames and passwords into a database and be done . 
  especially if you do n't know better . 
  my question is how does someone learn that they need to hash without also learning that they need to salt ? 
  i 've never come across a source that explains why to hash passwords and how to do it without * also * explaining why hashing is insufficient and salting is also necessary . 
  ( and note , i am * very * specifically keeping this limited to the issue of password hashing/salting , not other security issues like sql injection . ), 
  my favourite type of character ( at least at the moment ) is the corrupted good . 
  someone who sets out with good intentions , but gradually , for whatever reason , finds themselves turning evil . 
  anakin skywalker , for example , was such a beautifully conceived character ( shame about the beyond awful dialogue and subpar acting ... ) in his fall from grace . 
  my current character is a warlock who , at first , did n't know she was a warlock . 
  she formed a pact with an archdevil , thinking that it was just a way of becoming a wizard ( and not knowing that it was an archdevil she formed the pact with ) . 
  as she gradually levelled up and used more and more devilish powers , she became more and more evil and murderous , such that when she eventually found out and later accepted the fact that she was a warlock in a pact with a devil , she did n't care anymore : just wanted more power . 
  another archetype i like is the opposite . 
  someone innately evil struggling * against * that innate nature . 
  it 's why i like the [ vryloka ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 3tp1cw/homebrew _ vryloka_race_final / ) race so much , and tieflings can be used in much the same way , and why i loved the character serana from skyrim . 
  if i had to pick specifically between the two archetypes you mentioned , i 'd probably go with the evil one . 
  lawful evil is just such a fantastic archetype , and there are so many lawful evil characters in fiction that i love . 
  vader is arguably one , but so is tywin lannister , damien darhk on the latest season of arrow , vampires in general ( but particularly ones close to the dracula archetype ) , and most incarnations of lex luthor ( and maxwell lord , who mostly seems to be similar to luthor , on supergirl ) . 
  all of these are fantastic lawful evil characters , and all except dracula and * perhaps * vader have not shown a desire to cause collateral damage . 
  i start counting on my left hand . 
  out of curiosity , why ask `` count on 06 fingers , which hand has 01 finger ? 
  '' , rather than just `` count on your fingers , which hand do you start on ? '', 
  or something similarly simple ? 
   a grenade thrown into a kitchen in france would result in linoleum blown apart . 
  plz explain ? 
   but a warlock can bring a unique dynamic to a group even without their cheesy effects simply because their patron is such an integral part of their actions, 
  yeah honestly i think warlocks are pretty lame mechanically . 
  it 's an interesting theory , but i feel like 2 spells per rest ( later 3 ) is just too few . 
  if it were 3 in low levels and went up to like 6 or 7 at top levels , that would probably sit a little better with me . 
  as it is , they 're too much just `` spam eldritch blast '' , which is n't fun . 
  i just love them because they 're so cool thematically and from a roleplay perspective . 
  oh yeah , i guess it sorta does ... 
  so , a couple of things . 
  one is that i actually called out vader as one of the possible exceptions to the general rule . 
  another is that actually , i believe it was grand moff tarkin who gave the order to blow up alderaan . 
  and then finally , was n't alderaan being used quite heavily as a rebel base/stronghold ? 
  i could be wrong about that one . 
  ah , so it was . 
  the question is put : that the question be now put .

  not at all . 
  from a meta perspective it 's useful to be notified of things . 
  paging / u/jnd-au , could you provide a bit of an explanation here ? 
  does so81 just allow a member to stop a motion being debated on at all ? 
  just a tip , dropbox is n't a good place to host these sorts of things . 
  it tends to be slower than google drive , but more importantly , if they notice too many people clicking on a link , they cut off access to it . 
  well , you could just use so81 to end debate on this one , too . 
  hmm , good point . 
  i 'll put it to a vote later tonight . 
  give others a little more time to get in on the debate , but not the full normal 24 hours . 
  honestly i like it . 
  i think it 's a good convention to use in the future . 
  as long as there 's no reason that it could be denied , why should debate have to wait ? 
   there are other shows/games that do `` nice '' characters justice and make them more than interesting, 
  yeah , like the fucking original show !, 
  aang and katara were both definitely `` nice '' characters , but they were very well liked . 
  for me jinora 's a great example of did n't like at first , but grew on me . 
  i hated all the airbending kids at first , they felt like annoying little brats interrupting the story , but jinora grew into probably my favourite character in korra . 
  i still hate the other airbending kids . 
  the question is * put * : that the motion be agreed to .

  i 'm not a fan of this definition , to be honest . 
  if my code is `` cause as much mayhem as possible '' i am * not * lawful . 
  that 's textbook chaos . 
  i agree that fighting with nobles , guards , and other figures of authority is n't always at odds with the idea of lawfulness , and i * definitely * think the example of the evil party above is pretty textbook le . 
  but i do n't think it can be reduced to `` follow any kind of code '' . 
  which is exactly what * makes * both of them good characters . 
  the vast majority of the time they are good , but they 're not perfect -- they have flaws . 
  hells , especially with aang , that time he lied , he was doing something * nice * for the two factions . 
  his lie helped bring two tribes together . 
  that sounds like a nice thing , to me . 
  katara 's example is very different , obviously , because for a moment there , she definitely was * not * being nice . 
  she was quite clearly ready to commit an act that most would consider * evil * , in fact . 
  but that was a single exception based on * very * extenuating circumstances , and overall she was clearly a good character and a nice person . 
  seriously , it 's insane how slow it is . 
  [ this was on my front page ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor/comments/3wrnq3/when_you_fix_a_bug_in_production/ ) * hours * before i went to bed . 
  i just woke up and it 's * still * on my front page !, 
  he met him as part of the hello internet thing where they watched star wars at the zoo , did n't he ? 
  does n't that amount as work ? 
  they could use that in their ads . 
  jesus mate , i 'm not saying they should n't be * allowed * to run games at their stores . 
  i 'm saying it should n't be something that they `` should be striving for anyway '' .
