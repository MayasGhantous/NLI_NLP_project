  if a store wants to run games , more power to them . 
  though just allowing people to run games would be way better than the pile of crap that is the al. 
   and i never said playing at a store is a `` privilege '', 
  i never implied you did mate . 
  those were scare quotes . 
  i was being * sarcastic * . 
   very few things are banned outright ( aarakocra from eepg , variants from the dmg , and tiefling flying rules from the scag ) , a select few things have limitations that have been set ( hp/hp per level , starting gp , alignment , plus some elements from the scag ) , and yes , certain books ca n't be combined ( eepg+scag , currently ), 
  sounds like a hell of a lot to me . 
   some home brews have limitations , too ( low magic settings , some races/classes not being allowed/being limited in player-created settings , game mechanics being altered to make the game harder/easier , etc. ), 
  and that 's fine . 
  but if they 're doing organised play , the * table * does n't get to choose . 
  wizards has decided * for * them that this is how it * has * to be done , and if you want the `` privilege '' ( again -- since you did n't seem to realise it last time -- this is * sarcastic * ) of playing as part of their organisation , you 'll shut up and like it . 
   it sounds like you have n't actually created a character for it and played an al game, 
  i 've been quite explicit about this . 
  i * ca n't * , because wizards does n't give a ** shit ** about d&d for players outside of north america . 
  there are n't stores in my area ( and i live in a large city in a developed western nation -- it 's not like i 'm in bumfuck nowhere ) that do it . 
  and because of * this * , none of the stores in my area are able to sell the damn books when they 're first released . 
  not that i would want to , anyway , for the reasons previously outlined . 
  the adventurer 's league is just dumb . 
  you 're playing as part of this organisation , and you 're really gaining shit all for it . 
  you 're getting a bunch of restrictions thrown upon you without you being able to say anything about it , and you gain ... what , exactly ? 
  access to a few adventures that are n't going to be as good as the published modules anyway ? 
  and even those a dm can customise and use as they choose far more than in the al. 
  toph has no internal conflicts ? 
  her entire first episode ( not counting the one in the swamp ) was nothing * but * conflict for her character . 
  and throughout the series , she provided a great foil for aang 's personality . 
  but to be honest , i * do n't * think she was nearly as likeable a character as the rest of the gaang . 
  she 's certainly likeable , but just to a lesser degree than zuko , katara , and aang . 
  i actually did see that before , and i agree with it . 
  i did n't realise it was from the same person that i was replying to . 
  and i think i agree with the reply to your linked comment more . 
  figure out how your character acts , and then decide what alignment best matches with that . 
  i ca n't remember which of these are from the book and which are n't , but my current character had the ideal of : willing to believe that some good can be found in anyone , if you look hard enough, 
  and the flaw of : is na\u00efve and trusting of others , especially those who act like they know what they are talking about or wield authority . 
  the bond was related to my specific warlock pact/patron . 
   but he does n't want to take away from player agency, 
   i have to play a character that can heal, 
  hmm, 
   likewise , if most mps bothered to vote , we 'd reach a majority of 7 quickly instead waiting around for the time limits to expire, 
  oh god i wish . 
  it 's infuriating how long everything takes to try and get everything done . 
  as for the reason i did it in this case : well , i believe that conversation was had publicly in this thread , so you can see it yourself / u/3fun . 
  the * only * way they could cross over and not make a complete mess of verisimilitude and suspension of disbelief in my mind would be if they have supergirl take place in `` earth-4 '' or some other number that 's not 1 or 2 . 
  then just use inter-dimensional shenanigans to bring the cast of one show onto the other . 
  yeah , that 's something i really enjoyed about it . 
  unfortunately , being a warlock with an archdevil patron , the na\u00efvit\u00e9 did n't last too long . 
  if you 'll forgive my skepticism , i have to say i do n't have much faith in how much attention or care the devs have for the feedback they 're getting . 
  the second most popular request on there is video and screen sharing ( and the three other top requests are pretty obvious basic stuff ) : a feature that would be * required * to meet the claims discord makes that it can be used as a skype replacement . 
  and yet from everything i 've heard from the devs , that 's not really something planned for the near future . 
  when the second most popular overall ( and the most popular that is n't near-trivial ) feature is utterly and almost * actively * ignored , that says something about the approach to feedback , in my mind , and it kinda makes me feel like it 's not worth the effort . 
  sir ian , sir ian , sir ian ; action ; gandalf : you shall not pass , sir ian , sir ian , sir ian . 
  [ reddit had some trouble keeping up with stuff the past few hours ] ( http://www.redditstatus.com/ ) . 
  ( [ screenshot for posterity ] ( http://imgur.com/v7uwjvn ) ), 
  luckily , they were still storing comments in their database , just having trouble displaying them correctly . 
  yeah , someone else in my party convinced me to get repelling blast , and it 's been * way * more useful and fun than i ever thought it would be . 
  it was especially good because we had a polearm master , and knocking people away from melee with him meant that he got to use his reaction more often . 
  i have n't grabbed mask of many faces yet , but i 'm tossing up between it and beguiling influence for my next invocation . 
  the synergy between momf and the cantrip friends is just amazing . 
  ah interesting , thanks . 
  have admins spoken publicly anywhere about this ? 
  i 'm kinda curious to read more . 
  interesting ? 
  what 's the weakness ? 
  and what would you propose ? 
  those are just other functions for hashing , ones designed to be expensive to brute force , but still fundamentally just hashing functions . 
  i thought you were claiming that the idea of a hash and salt was a bad one . 
  no , not the dmg . 
  it 's [ an unofficial race homebrew guide that you can find here ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  it 's not perfect -- for example , i think the way it treats flight is utterly bizarre , and using its swim rules as written is a bit poor imo -- and it should not be taken too literally , but it 's a pretty good way of assessing whether or not something you ( or someone else ) made is fairly well balanced or not , in general . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  members may vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease no later than 2200\u00a016/12 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  ## votes, 
  ** ayes ** : 3, 
  ** noes ** : 4, 
  abstentions / yet to vote : 4, 
  ### i think the noes have it, 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  i 'm fairly sure i may have been responsible for a couple of those deleted by user comments . 
  oh that 's a cool idea . 
  i 'm not sure * exactly * how much time it would save , since we 'd still have to give anyone that did n't vote a chance to do so , but it certainly could be worthwhile . 
  could probably extend it from the normal 24 hours to like 30 or something . 
  / u/phyllicanderer , could we get this referred to the procedure committee ? 
  clerk / u/jnd-au , ring division bells for four minutes . 
  the doors must remain open . 
  a member may leave the area of members ' seats unless he or she called for the division . 
  after four minutes have elapsed the doors shall be locked and no member may enter or leave the chamber until after the division . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  members voting `` aye '' to move to the right side of the chair , and the members voting `` no '' to move to the left . 
  ( meta : reply telling me which side to which you moved . ), 
  no member may move from his or her place from the commencement of the count until the result of that division is announced . 
  # the doors will be locked at 1530\u00a016/12 / 2015 , utc +10 with the final count, 
  members on my right ( ayes ) | members on my left ( noes ) | members not yet present, 
  this_guy22 | 3fun | cyberpolis, 
  phyllicanderer | thewhiteferret | iamthepotato8, 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page ding ding ding , the bells are ringing for a division in the house of representatives, 
  i also liked that they particularly poked fun at the movie by saying `` superman does n't kill '' . 
  should this proposal be left until after the result of the division ? 
  yeah thanks , i 'm aware of that one .
