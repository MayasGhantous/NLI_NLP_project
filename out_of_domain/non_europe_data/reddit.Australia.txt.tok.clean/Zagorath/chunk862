  i ca n't remember if i appointed tellers last time or not , since it was less than 5 votes . 
  i know i wrote out the appointing of tellers , but i may have deleted that bit and just called the result instead . 
  wait what ?

  129 ( c ) says `` upon the doors being locked '' . 
  that 's not yet . 
  huh ? 
  but the bells are only ringing just now . 
  the doors wo n't be locked until 1530 tomorrow utc +10 . 
  oh awesome , i 've only just noticed that this is back !, 
  and working with reddit ssl turned on !, 
  only one real piece of feedback : it needs a proper human-readable date format . 
  yyyy.mm.dd is a great machine-readable format , but is n't ideal for humans . 
  mm/dd/yyyy is just plain stupid . 
  where 's the option for dd-mm-yyyy ? 
  oh ... that 's not how we 've run divisions in the past . 
  i just assumed we were allowing a longer time for the bells to ring , which is how it had been done in the previous divisions . 
  i 'm not really sure you 're using the term acquihire correctly . 
  it 's normally when they acquire a company * exclusively * for the talent , with little-to-no interest in the product itself . 
  from the sounds of it , they bought out alien blue for the product , and kept the same talent on board . 
  it 's quite complicated , so [ i made instructions for you ] ( http://imgur.com/a/mme5s ) . 
  i 'm not actually super familiar with dudamel 's conducting , but i just had a listen of a few of my favourite movements by him ( in particular , [ mvt 1 of symphony 5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ognbrabqdp4 ) , [ mvt 1 of symphony 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otnoeclce4q ) , ~ ~ mvts 4 & 5 of symphony 6 , and mvt 2 of symphony 7 ~ ~ -- actually never mind on those two , i could n't find recordings on youtube -- ( i 'd like to listen to the entire 9th , but do n't really have time right now ) ) , and his certainly are n't my favourite performances ( i thought he used a little too much rubato in the recapitulation on the 5th ) , but his performances were up there among the best i 've heard . 
  he did n't fall into the trap that far too many conductors do with the 5th of playing it -- especially the opening -- slow and pompously , and that 's always a great sign to me . 
  i 'm curious , what is it you do n't like about his beethovens ? 
  haha yeah , `` actively ignored '' probably was n't the best way to word it . 
  i guess i 'm just frustrated that the front page and other places claim that this is meant to replace skype , but other devs have stated that video is n't a feature that 's on the roadmap for now . 
  that 's what i was trying to get at . 
  yeah , that 's more or less how i was envisaging it . 
  / u/phyllicanderer , could we get this referred to the procedure committee ? 
  wow this is amazing stuff . 
  if you were to reformat it just slightly , so that it 's more like a story that actually happened than a set of instructions ( and it 's already sorta in this format , it would only need a little tweaking ) , this would be amazing over at / r/dndgreentext ( despite the name , it * does n't * need to be greentext , just ... more like a story , i guess ) . 
  the ua article was all demons ( unfortunately , the latest storyline deals * only * with demons , not the far more interesting imo devils ) , but it should n't be * too * hard to reflavour for devils . 
  i * think * that 's their intention . 
  they wants to summon a devil so they can form a pact with it . 
  though they were n't explicit , so i could be wrong . 
  honestly , the best answer is : talk to your dm . 
  let them set up an appropriate situation for you . 
  they can help you find a devil that 's more interesting that what you would be able to summon otherwise , and maybe even tailor it to the specific thematics that you 're looking for . 
   #this video is not available . 
   sorry about that . 
  initially , symphonies were a four movement piece . 
  the first movement would be in sonata-allegro form , the second would be slow , the third would be a minuet or scherzo , and the fourth would be another fast movement . 
  they generally shared related keys , going from the home key to relative major/minor , to the dominant/subdominant , or sometimes to the parallel major/minor . 
  as time went on , this strict form became less and less strictly adhered to . 
  extra movements were added , or movements were cut or merged . 
  the mood of different movements might be swapped , such as the second being the one in 3 , and the third being the slow one , or they might be altered entirely . 
  the key relation thing became even less relevant than the form going in to the romantic and 20th century eras . 
  but generally , if something is called a symphony , it can in * some * way be seen to have been derived from that basic 4 movement form . 
  and , obviously , it 's a primarily orchestral work . 
  later symphonies , starting with beethoven 's 9th , sometimes used choir . 
  yeah , you sure as hell are going to get downvoted for this . 
  and why * would n't * you ? 
  you have n't even * tried * to be constructive . 
  hell , even bngthm down below you at least gave an * opinion * on the composer being discussed . 
  it was a totally unnecessary opinion shoehorned in here where it really did n't belong , but it 's better than ... what ... just complaining about life ? 
  maybe he meant fagott ? 
  i mean , as far as i know , handel had no talent for the bassoon . 
  are you sure ? 
  i mean , officially perhaps , but as far as i 'm aware , british people normally use dd mm yyyy . 
  `` officially '' the us has adopted the metric system !, 
  meta : in the future , could you please leave your vote as a reply to the motion itself . 
  if i do n't get a notification for it , it 's * very * easy for me to miss the vote entirely . 
  haha well , of course . 
  while you 're at it , could you add an option to display it in unix time ? 
  ( kidding ! ), 
  done . 
  on both accounts . 
  ooooh , hard one . 
  options for both ? 
  lock the doors , / u/jnd-au . 
  the ayes will pass to the right of the chair , and the noes to the left . 
  i appoint the member for western australia teller for the noes , and the member for regional victoria teller for the ayes . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  the results from the division are in . 
  as there are fewer than 4 members on my left , under standing order 127 , i will declare the result immediately for the ayes .
