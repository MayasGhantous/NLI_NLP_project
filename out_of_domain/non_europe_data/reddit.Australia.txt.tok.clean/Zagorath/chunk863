  used as a source of revenue ? 
  i 'm a little confused , what sort of subreddits are quarantined , and how were they being used as sources of revenue ? 
  yes , they are . 
  the author of that was ( as you can see at the top of the post ) inspired by [ the top comment in this thread ] ( / r/dnd/comments / 3wxq4b/my _ dm_wants_to_kill_my_donkey_how_can_i_protect / cxzqngr ) .

  [ link to said basic rules ] ( https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules ) . 
  if you want to give the game a go , i would recommend picking up a copy of the `` starter set '' , which includes a physical copy of some of these basic rules , a pretty good adventure that 's * really * easy for a first-time dm to run , a set of premade characters with backgrounds that tie in to the adventure ( if you do n't want to make your own characters ) , and a set of dice . 
  in the us , it generally goes for about $ 20 . 
  also , if what you 're interested in is more cool stories about d&d or other roleplaying games , / r/dndgreentext has a bunch of fantastic ones . 
  i would recommend starting with [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which has a bunch of the best stories that have been shared there . 
  since the start , the bot has for some reason had a few comments here and there that it just randomly will not work for . 
  i have no idea why this is . 
  we 've been lucky that it seems to have mostly worked up until now and never picked a paging comment to be the one that does n't work . 
  the only comments that it 's finding at the moment in / r/modelaussenate which are causing it problems are [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaussenate/comments/3wpxgi/296a_message_received_a_fair_tax_system_tighter/cy0ffcm ) and [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/modelaussenate/comments/3wps4s/293_second_reading_of_a_new_tax_system_goods_and/cy0foxi ) . 
  i 'm going to see if i can rework how it scrapes comments from the ground up once i 'm on holiday ( next week ) , and that 's when i 'll see about adding the extra functionality , too . 
  here 's the complete output of errors currently ( from the two chambers ) , fwiw .

  the time codes are just when the bot first came across the error ( or rather , first came across it since it last started up ) , and because it scans the pages fairly quickly , when the bot gets started up afresh , it finds them all within a short amount of time . 
  but it consistently finds the same posts when restarted . 
  if you have 60 of them , they just need to spend a minute casting the spell , but start at one second intervals , so that the second one finishes the spell ( and therefore its effects take place ) one second after the last guy 's . 
  when you finish , start the casting again so you 'll be done when it comes to your turn again . 
  a * lot * of people in this subreddit and in / r/australia . 
  yeah , i can see the show ending in one of three ways , but definitely , the focus of season 4 should be with previous events coming back to haunt him . 
  the question is how the very end will end . 
  the first is the way the original book went , [ ] ( / s `` where francis committed suicide . 
  in both the shows , this was replaced by him killing the reporter girl , but i can see them moving the suicide up to the finale . '' ), 
  i consider this the least likely of the possible endings . 
  the second is to match the uk version of the show . 
  both the uk and us versions of the show have very obvious strong shakespearean themes , [ ] ( / s `` and as anyone who has studied shakespeare knows , evil always eventually gets their comeuppance . 
  in the uk show , francis 's wife conspired with his chief of staff to have him assassinated . '' ), 
  with how the third season ended , i can see them going with this route . 
  and the third possible ending would be to look like they 're going towards one of the other endings , and then subvert it . 
  [ ] ( / s `` probably make it look like they 're going towards the second ending : have someone plotting to take his life . 
  but have frank eventually come out of it , look into the camera , and say ` you did n't really think i was going to lose , did you ? 
  * tap * * tap * '' ), 
  any one of those endings , if done well , could be a very good one . 
  but whatever it is , the main theme of the season needs to be frank 's past catching up to him . 
  honestly it was the concentration on him and on frank 's wife that was a big part of what i hated about season 3 . 
  i never cared about those characters in the first two seasons , so the emphasis on them in season 3 felt painful . 
  season 3 was not well received , and i think that was at least partly because they departed entirely from the original show ( not directly , but i think the departure was a result of them focussing on the wrong themes , ones which did not forward the plot substantially ) . 
  seasons 1 and 2 pretty much aligned with seasons 1 and 2 of the uk version . 
  what made the original great was how tight it was . 
  they got in , told their piece , and got out in 12 episodes : three seasons of four . 
  if season 4 of the us version is n't the end , i suspect that it will feel as though it 's dragged on far too long . 
  haha damn , you beat me to it !, 
  but this was awesome . 
  i do n't think i 've had this much fun with a google doodle in a * long * time . 
  [ here 's a more permanent link , though ] ( https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-ludwig-van-beethovens-245th-year ) . 
  it 's actually not his birthday yet over there . 
  those of us in the far east have passed midnight on the 17th already . 
  his actual birth date is n't known , but he was baptised on the 17th , so that 's when it tends to be celebrated ( even though he was * probably * born on the 16th ) . 
  and among the first with the piccolo . 
  the whole last movement is in c major though . 
  tierce de picardie is when a piece is in minor , and then the last chord changes to major . 
  yeah , this is the most important imo . 
  the first movement is so obviously built up with that same rhythm : there 's hardly a * single * bar in the movement that is n't built on that simple motif . 
  and then it crops up with varying degrees of subtlety in other movements . 
  the third movement is very obviously and clearly built on it , except instead of being quaver rest , quaver , quaver , quaver , minum in a 2/4 time , it 's three quavers and a dotted minum , in 3/4 time . 
  the second movement uses this same variation on the rhythm : look near the end of the main motif , in bar 14 , for the first example . 
  [ many more examples can be found here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symphony_no._5_ ( beethoven \\ ) #repetition _ of_the_opening_motif_throughout_the_symphony ) . 
  also important is the symbolism in the piece . 
  now , like with any literary analysis , it 's debatable whether or not beethoven * intended * all of it specifically or if it 's something we 're reading into it , but such observations are valuable regardless . 
  the first movement in particular is like a fight between light and dark , with the main motif being the `` dark '' , and the second theme ( heralded by the horns , and then the main part of the second theme played first by the violins -- with celli and contrabassi repeating the first theme underneath ) being lighter . 
  the symbolism of the way the darker theme is always there underneath the light one , and the battle back and forth between them -- particularly in the development -- is just fascinating musically . 
  and then there 's the question of the bassoons playing in the recapitulation what the horn played in the exposition . 
  was this a deliberate bit of symbolism ? 
  the weaker sound of the bassoon symbolising the weaker `` light '' side towards the end , foreshadowing the ultimate `` victory '' of darkness ? 
  or was it a purely pragmatic change so that the horns did n't have to switch to a different key ? 
  there 's some similar analysis that could be done across the movements . 
  on the whole , it 's just a piece that has a lot of stuff that can be said about it that * is n't * \\* directly \\* related to the music itself with more traditional musical analysis techniques , and there are n't many pieces that come before it for which that can be said . 
  beethoven 's eroica is perhaps another such . 
  is it the 17th yet where you are ?
