  ### it appears the votes are tied . 
  well , this is an interesting situation to be in . 
  i am not aware of a precedent that * quite * matches the situation we find ourselves in . 
  my first thought was that the casting vote should go to encourage further debate , and thus i should cast my vote with the ayes : enabling a second division . 
  but a second division is not , in truth , further debate , and would likely end in the same result as the previous vote . 
  a vote of no , on the other hand , is one that would lead to the house debating and coming to a decision regarding the motion by the leader of the house . 
  i therefore place my casting vote with the noes .

   alternatively , cast on those who notice you doing something bad or bad for them , so they do n't raise the alarm until you escape, 
  friends has no effect on people that are already hostile towards you . 
  this does n't necessarily mean that they 're already * attacking * you . 
  still , other uses of friends are perfectly valid . 
  brilliant list though , thanks . 
  ab-initio languages are generally thought to be easier than sl language b. 
  * however * , i would argue that from a personal perspective it 's just better to be able to speak a language with some competence than it is to get the better grade . 
  still , it does n't look like there 's much you * can * do . 
  either do spanish ab , or drop one of chemistry and history in favour of a different science or social science . 
  it 's up to you which of those is the most important to you personally . 
  out of interest , what are some of the choices for what you want to do at uni ? 
  i might recommend keeping the subjects that are most applicable to the * hardest * of those to get into . 
  for example , if medicine is something you 're considering , keep chemistry for sure .

  not exactly what you 're asking for , but have you tried using google to search this site ? 
  make your search query `` site : portexaminer.com [ what you want ] '' . 
  and 6th , though that one 's a little more blatant about it . 
  you could always just subscribe to it via rss . 
   how * fucking * crass . 
  children listen to this show, 
  lol, 
  make sure to get at least the dawnguard expansion . 
  it introduces what is probably the single deepest and most well-thought-out character in the game . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  a lot of passive abilities compared to most races but i would n't say it 's unbalanced at all . 
  it 's probably about a 5.5 on the race balance guide , which is acceptable , but near the lower end of acceptable . 
  are there any cantrips or other minor features ( preferably some more active ones , to offset the fact that all the existing abilities are fairly passive ) that you could add ?

  meta : in for a penny in for a pound would be my thought . 
  leave is just as likely to be denied for that as it is for this i 'd have thought . 
  leave is sought and the question proposed : that the bill be now read for a third time .

  quite a few races get spellcasting or a cantrip , humans get a feat which in many cases can involve something active , half-orcs get relentless endurance , but you 're right , there are n't nearly as many with truly `` active '' abilities as i thought .

  no you were right the first time .

  so , not too different from `` queen consolidated '' or `` wayne enterprises '' , then ? 
  the best thing to do would probably just be pirate . 
  you paid for the game once already , and a pirated copy would work just as well as a backed-up copy from steam , if steam were to go away . 
   gyms also deny responsibility if someone uses the training devices unsupervised, 
  yeah , that 's because that 's something the * person * is choosing to do themselves . 
  but the issue at hand is valve denying responsibility if * they * get hacked . 
  if there 's a flaw in * valve 's * security , they should be the ones taking responsibility for any loss or harm that may come to their customers as a result . 
   money back from deleted accs : several other services also have this same stand on money, 
  then several other services should , according to eu law , also be sued . 
  if they shut down your account , why should they get to keep the money stored there ? 
  honestly , the * only * one of the points that i think * does n't * make sense is the resale .
