  digital goods do n't degrade like physical ones do , so there 's no incentive * not * to buy a resold copy . 
  it would kill the video game market entirely if this were allowed . 
  successfully ? 
  no , not yet . 
  [ the accc 's action against valve is still in progress ] ( http://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/06/the-accc-is-still-pursuing-legal-action-against-valve/ ) . 
  apparently valve did n't send over its two witnesses because `` they got sick '' . 
  ninjaedit : [ here 's their initial announcement of their proceedings ] ( https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/full-steam-ahead-accc-institutes-proceedings-against-valve-for-making-alleged-misleading-consumer-guarantee-representations ), 
  next hearing is march 2016 . 
  in the future , please leave your votes as replies to the act of the question being put . 
  if i do n't get a notification , i did n't `` hear '' the vote . 
  i 'll count it this time , but be aware . 
  yeah , i think people would be a lot more comfortable about downloading code from a stranger if the source is there to read , rather than just an . exe thrown up on google drive ... 
  it would also mean people can compile it for different systems , unless op has decided to use libraries that are exclusive to windows ( which , in all honesty , would be dumb and unnecessary for such a simple programme ) . 
  are you not using * any * version control ? 
  git is one of the most popular types of version control . 
  it 's insanely powerful , but for just basic things like a single person keeping track of their updates as they write a simple programme , it 's easy to use . 
  you should * definitely * be using some form of version control to keep track of your changes . 
  even if it 's just for yourself , it makes it a lot harder to accidentally fuck up and ruin everything you 've done , since you can always revert to a previous state . 
  github is a website that lets you store git repositories online to share and ( if you want ) collaborate with others around the world . 
  you should check out / r/learnprogramming and related subs for more info . 
  ( also , if you do n't mind my saying so , imo c # and . net are not a great way to start with programming . 
  something more cross-platform would be more ideal . 
  python is amazing because it 's super easy to get into , or java because it 's a pretty simple straightforward oo language , but is also cross-platform . ), 
  how exactly do you enable this ? 
  the first instruction says :, 
   load chrome : / / flags / #top - chrome-md in the address bar of the chrome browser and select material from the pulldown menu ( sets the material design elements in the browser 's top chrome ) . 
  but top-chrome-md does n't seem to exist . 
  md-policy exists , and so does enable-md-downloads , but none of the other options listed are appearing . 
  ^ ( version 48.0.2564.48 beta ( 64-bit ) ^ ), 
  hear , hear !, 
  i remember thinking it rather odd that things had to be finished before you can submit them , because surely the whole point is to figure out how to approach things and get feedback ? 
  i also really like the idea of `` the arcana forge '' , too . 
  it 's a cool name . 
  edit : / r/thearcanaforge now exists . 
   1/8 the weight, 
  you know enough about the physics to know the force of gravity is proportional to mmr ^ ( -2 ) ( and so acceleration due to gravity is proportional to mr ^ ( -2 ) ) , but go around calling mass `` weight '' . 
  to paraphrase treebeard : a wenonian should know * better * . 
  i think the rules on here are perfect as they are . 
  but i do think that there 's room for another sub where people can request homebrew content , or post only partially-completed stuff , to get it to the point where it can be submitted on here . 
  it could be as simple as someone having an idea they want to make , but not knowing where to start with homebrewing , or it could be further along and just not knowing how what few extra features they need to add . 
  if anything , such a sub existing could potentially make it a good idea to * tighten * the rules in this sub . 
  use the other sub for balance as well , and get this sub to be used for finalised submissions . 
  that 's probably a step too far , but it 's worth considering . 
  meta : this is weird . 
  if there had been one * more * vote * against * this , it would have passed ? 
  as quorum was not reached in the previous vote , we will perform a count out and vote again . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  reply present , and then vote by including `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease no later than 1200\u00a019/12 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  ## votes, 
  ** ayes ** : 4, 
  ** noes ** : 3, 
  absent / yet to vote : 4, 
  ## i think the ayes have it . 
  the motion will now be put . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for count out and vote, 
  yeah , i get that . 
  it 's just an odd voting mechanic . 
  sort of similar to failing the later-no-harm voting criterion ( but not exactly ) . 
  my thinking was that an aye vote , while it might at first glance * appear * to enable further debate , it actually would not . 
  all it would be is another vote by the house . 
  by moving on to the next stage , we can move towards debating the actual motion itself , rather than dwelling on the question of whether or not we should debate the question . 
   which is not exchangeable for cash once you buy it, 
  actually in some places , by law , it is . 
  i think california in the us has that law , and i 'd guess it 's the case in parts of the eu . 
  the member for western australia will remove himself under 94 ( a ) . 
  leave is sought and the question proposed : that this bill be now read a third time . 
  debate will cease no later than 1200\u00a019/12 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  sometimes you have to do something that is n't perfect on principle , just to be pragmatic . 
  it 's not just make up , they 're using a lot of techniques to make her look younger . 
  very soft diffused lighting , soft focus ( which is * sort of * , but not really , like deliberately shooting something out of focus , but in a way that can look nice ) , and maybe even some post-production -- though i doubt that there 's much going on there if any -- are also among the techniques used to make her look more glamorous . 
   you 'll spend every run getting into arguments with idiot bikers, 
  perhaps i 'm misunderstanding you , but from the way i 'm interpreting what you 've written , it sounds like the bike lane is a very busy one where you tried running . 
  simply put , you should n't be running in the bike lane if it 's busy . 
  it 's a * bike * lane , and pedestrians should * always * give way to bikes in it . 
  if you 're running at a time and place that you 're constantly getting into arguments with the cyclists , then frankly you should not be running there . 
  again , if i 've misinterpreted the premise , i apologise , and you can disregard all of the above . 
  if you 're talking about an iphone , my advice is do n't . 
  the things that made qwerty good on mechanical typewriters , but bad on modern computer keyboards , have again made it good on small mobile phone screens with predictive text and autocorrect . 
  dvorak , with its common letters all so close to each other on the home row ( * especially * the vowels ) is unideal on phones . 
  the questions are now put : that the member for western australia 's amendment be agreed to , and that the prime minister 's motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying with three `` ayes '' or `` noes '' , corresponding to, 
  * the question of the amendment being accepted . 
  * the question of the motion being accepted if the amendment passes . 
  * the question of the motion being accepted if the amendment fails . 
  voting will cease no later than 1500\u00a020/12 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  ## votes, 
  | ayes | noes | yet to vote / abstentions, 
  amendment | 1 | 4 | 6, 
  motion w / amendment | 3 | 2 | 6, 
  motion w/o amendment | 4 | 1 | 6, 
  for the amendment, 
  ### i think the noes have it for, 
  for the motion, 
  ### i think the ayes have it, 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for votes on hours of meeting, 
  meta : so , for clarification , you consider the motion with 3fun 's amendment to be worse than nothing at all ?
