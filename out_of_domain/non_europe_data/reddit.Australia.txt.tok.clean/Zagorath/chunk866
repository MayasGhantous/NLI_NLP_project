  [ i voted dgmdsmjjvv8j/v + gsawvch2wppvsq1xdjpme8nqibzq , 
  this is quite clearly libel , and possibly also separately against election campaign rules . 
  / u/jnd-au what course of action could be taken here ? 
  [ ah , here we go . 
  ] ( https://www.business.qld.gov.au/business/running/marketing/advertising/advertising-regulations ), 
  australian consumer law covers :, 
  * false or misleading representations, 
  * * including testimonials, 
  there certainly are such laws in some places , but not universally . 
  but the thing is , it 's way more effort to back up and keep the copy stored somewhere , than it is to just torrent it when and if steam goes away and you decide you want to play that game again . 
  if you 're right that it does not apply to campaign material , then i apologise and retract my statement . 
  but despite using a fake name , it is still very clearly an image of the real person , scott ludlam . 
  not a cartoon that resembles the aforementioned , but an actual photo . 
  the fact that a disguised name has been used is irrelevant . 
  i think one thing of significance is that the low chanting music gives the feeling that the music is truly ancient , which of course symbolises that whatever the music is repressing , whether it be plagueis or snoke ( or whether they be the same person ) either is ancient themselves , or has tapped into some truly ancient power . 
  but i do agree , the use of not just the low chant like music , but also vader 's theme , the force theme , and also that sort of `` growing darkness '' motif ( not sure if that one has an official name ) during palpatine 's teachings was fantastic . 
  speaking from one music nerd to another ( and you seem to have at least some particular interest in film music , as do i ) , i 'm curious as to your thoughts on the new music williams has written , particularly rey 's theme and kylo ren 's theme . 
  i 've put in a lot of thought of my own into it , but i 'm interested in what someone else might have to say . 
  also , i 'm sure you 'll appreciate the comedy of this , if you did n't already know it . 
  the performance anakin and palpatine are watching during that incredible scene where they discuss darth plagueis is called `` squid lake '' , performed by the mon calamari ballet . 
  yeah i noticed that as well . 
  but i 'm not sure the conclusion to reach from it is quite the same as the one you 've reached . 
  i do n't think the sith are the bad guys this time around . 
  and i do n't think the jedi order are going to be the heroes they were during the prequels . 
  i think we 're in for a much more ambiguous time where different force sensitive people use the force for good and for ill without going all in on one philosophy in the totalitarian way the jedi and sith did . 
  it 's worth noting , though , that the rule of two is kinda a myth . 
  at least within the time span that the movies cover , it has never been especially true . 
  during the phantom menace , plagueis was actually still alive . 
  sidious was the apprentice . 
  and yet he had is own apprentice in maul . 
  later on , darth tyranus ( count dooku ) had his own apprentice : asajj ventress while also being the apprentice of sidious . 
  wrong ewok party music ? 
  ( a ) there are two ewok party musics ? 
  ( b ) one of them is the right one ? 
  a short way into the movie my sister leaned over to me a whispered something to the effect of ` urgh , pointless love triangles ' , jokingly referring to rey , finn , and han ( she had earlier , and more seriously , made a comment about pointless love side plots , with just rey and finn ) . 
  i replied ` what , rey , han , and chewie ? ', 
  your comment just reminded me of that . 
  he 's been amazing in the flash as well , if you 're interested . 
  [ this scene was particularly amazing ] ( https://youtu.be/erbpdrd9wxk ) . 
  wait , so at some point during one of the many overhauls lucas has done , he decided to change the music playing during the ewok scene ? 
  exactly when did he make that particular change ? 
  are the two versions available somewhere on youtube ? 
  yeah , i 'm definitely super excited to see what williams will do with kylo ren 's theme . 
  but then , i 'm really excited to see how ren develops as a character in general , too . 
  i definitely had similar feelings regarding his music , though . 
  it definitely was n't quite a full-fledged and menacing as vader 's theme . 
  but also , it is n't nearly as `` singable '' as vader 's theme , either . 
  still , even as it already is , i think it 's a theme that grows on you . 
  later on in the movie i was digging it way more than i did early on , and now that i 've spent a lot of time listening to the soundtrack on spotify i really do like it . 
  i hope it develops a bit further than the 9 notes it is so far ( and that 's two phrases , one of 5 notes one of 4 , with the first 2 in each phrase being the same anyway ) , but even if it is n't , i think just by developing the way the same theme gets * used * in relation to other music , and by repeating it enough that even the average moviegoer associates it with kylo in the way they do vader 's theme with vader , or the hobbit theme in lotr with hobbits , there 's enough in the theme already to become a classic . 
  not , perhaps , on the same level as vader 's theme , but it could be a great nonetheless . 
   i remember the first couple times i saw ep 3 i thought that the music playing at that moment was supposed to be within the actual room they 're in, 
  i thought that too . 
  in fact , i thought that right up until i read this comment . 
  is that music * not * meant to be diegetic ? 
  i mean , just because it 's diegetic does n't mean that williams ca n't have composed it specifically to fit the mood . 
  it 's like when films deliberately set scenes in the rain for a particular mood . 
  yes , the rain exists in-universe , but it also helps the audience to establish a certain frame of mind . 
  so it had never really occurred to me that the music * was n't * diegetic . 
  but i agree with you , i definitely think those two tracks/themes are more closely related than / u/dragonfive seems to be giving them credit for . 
   completely pointless in my option like most of the special edition changes, 
  honestly , i intensely dislike the amount of vitriol people seem to have for the special editions . 
  sure , there were a bunch of pointless changes like random cgi characters in the background , rocks added in , etc. , and perhaps a few actually * negative * changes ( vader 's noooooo in episode 6 , for example , and gredo shooting first ) . 
  but i actually think that the changes , en net , have been beneficial . 
  [ this video does a pretty good job of explaining some of the * most * beneficial ones ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdejjbdlwbc ) . 
  most notably , changing the written language , changing the emperor 's hologram , and changing boba fett 's voice to match with the canonical incarnations of each of them . 
  but i ca n't comment on this one specifically . 
  i ca n't remember how the old version i had on tape growing up ended rotj , and i ca n't even remember very much about how the version i downloaded recently ended . 
  but then , i do n't have much time for arguments from nostalgia , anyway . 
  i do n't know exactly what each version is like . 
  yeah that line was absolutely incredible . 
  watching it for the first time , in context , i was super excited when he started mentioning `` the real reason i chose you '' etc. 
  i was like `` oh god , they are n't really going to do it , are they ? 
  this is so awesome ! '', 
  i probably squealed like a little girl when he actually said it . 
  hmm , yeah , that makes sense , actually . 
  i had always kinda assumed that the bubble itself , or possibly the fish , were somehow making the chanting noise . 
  but i guess that does n't make all that much sense . 
  as far as i can tell , the company that really popularised the recent trend in amusing changelogs was shifty jelly , particularly with their podcatcher pocket casts .
