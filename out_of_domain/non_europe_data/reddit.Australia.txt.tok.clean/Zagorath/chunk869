  why has it changed ? 
  where possible , i try to look for in-universe reasons . 
  but if the creators release an edited version that keeps things consistent , that 's even better . 
  incidentally , this reminds me of the kessel run thing . 
  there were two main theories for why han said that he did the kessel run in 12 parsecs . 
  one is the thing with black holes and taking the more dangerous route , and the other was simply that he was talking out of his arse . 
  ( and a third , from stick-in-the-muds who do n't care about the in-universe -- or `` watsonian '' -- point of view , and just like to go with a meta explanation -- or `` doylist '' one -- where they just say it 's because george lucas did n't know what a parsec was and was just talking out of * his * arse . ), 
  i 've always preferred the second explanation , because it adds more to han 's character , and because the first explanation never really sat well with me from a realism standpoint . 
  but rey 's having heard of this story and knowing it seems to imply that the first explanation has to be the correct one . 
  that disappoints me , but from a world consistency standpoint , i now have to accept the less satisfying explanation as the correct one , because it fits better with the entire universe as it has been shown . 
  leave is sought and the question proposed : that this bill be now read a third time .

  meta : nice to see someone not voting * strictly * along party lines with regards to whether or not the amendment passes . 
  i 'll speak for why i initially considered your party trolling . 
  it looked like you had come in from a subreddit * designed * from trolling ( i mean , that much is * true * ) , but also that the intent was purely to fuck shit up with no real interest in participating . 
  no legitimate interest in participating in the game . 
  but your single member of parliament so far has been fantastic . 
  more engaged than many of the other mps . 
  it 's made this whole thing very fun, 
  i still do n't care for most of what the party has submitted in this subreddit . 
  definitely feels like the trollish majority hangs out here , but in parliament itself it 's been fantastic . 
  i hope that whatever senators have been elected from your party are equally dedicated to their role . 
  how can you even use the words `` lazy '' and `` bicycles '' in the same sentence like that ? 
  the question is put : that the question be now put .

  this thread was up for three days and nobody thought to page me ? 
  ! page for vote on vote on suspension of standing orders, 
  honestly if they get back into good quality animated shows , i want young justice back . 
  the dcau had a fantastic run , but it 's over now . 
  to do more would be milking it , and would only cheapen the world for me . 
  supergirl especially would be a bad idea , because i do n't think there 's any satisfying way they could approach that without it coming across as cheesy . 
  it 's much better left to the imagination . 
  young justice , on the other hand , was cut short at just two seasons , with some fantastic characters that never got to have nearly as much development as they deserved . 
  thankfully , they did n't end on quite as much of a cliffhanger as , say , constantine , and they managed to close out all the major plot threads that were in progress , but it still deserves to get another two or three seasons to tell its story . 
   it has to do with the dm `` getting '' the pacing and enforcing it . 
  really , you 're going to blame the dms for this ? 
  i think most dms understand this fully , but choose to eschew it in favour of what makes narrative sense . 
  frankly , it 's a flaw in the design of the game that it 's so reliant on this exact rate of resting in order to be well balanced . 
  it 's * wizards * fault , not any dm 's . 
   eleventy-three points from gryfindor for reading comprehension, 
  i find that really amusing , because i actually have that guy tagged as `` poor reading comprehension '' from a previous thread . 
  also , you spelled gryffindor wrong . 
  it 's in the underdark edition of unearthed arcana . 
   they acknowledged the mystery of his heritage, 
  that 's the problem . 
  they really * did n't * . 
  there was this massive mystery around it for the * whole movie * . 
  but it was * never once touched upon * . 
  none of the characters seemed to care . 
  it was n't an interesting mystery , it was a frustrating one , because it felt like the movie did n't give enough of a shit to give us an answer . 
  with rey , i have absolute faith that we 're going to get a real answer in upcoming films , because they 've built up the mystery as something that we clearly are supposed to care about . 
  they used it in extremely interesting ways that added to her background which , * if * the mystery reveal is done right , make her character really interesting . 
  as i 've said before , it comes across that she 's the most naturally gifted force-sensitive there has * ever * been . 
  the reveal of this mystery * needs * to fairly explicitly explain that or it will be unsatisfying . 
  if it ends up being glossed over , as though it 's just some sort of generic power creep in the force , i will be exceedingly disappointed . 
  but if the reveal is done right ; if we get a proper explanation for why she 's as powerful as she is without any training , and if she becomes even more powerful in a noticeable way * after * she 's had some training ; this will have been a truly great character exploration . 
  all this is explained pretty clearly in the player 's handbook on pages 202 -- 203 , in the chapter about spellcasting . 
  i suggest you have a read of the rules that are relevant to the character you want to play before asking reddit to do it for you . 
  haha yeah , it 's not amazing because it 's exceptionally good acting ( it 's not ) . 
  the whole of the show the flash is not particularly good from a traditional dramatic perspective, 
  what it is , is completely self-aware . 
  it knows it 's a show made for nerds , and it plays that part extremely well . 
  lots of nods to the source material , and in general it 's just a really * fun * show . 
  this instance was just the epitome of that . 
  the creators knew that most people watching would know mark hamill played luke skywalker , and they knew that their most dedicated fans would also know that hamill played the trickster is the '90s flash tv show , and that barry 's father ( the guy who was captured ) was the guy that played barry allen/the flash in the '90s , making this the perfect culmination of all that . 
  the hokey reading is sort of a part of the genre . 
  and even more than that , it * had * to be hokey , there 's no way that a serious reading of that line -- a line so obviously ripping off one of the great classics -- would have landed . 
   i think it 's ... unfair , to simply chalk up the repugnance to the other inserted cgi as `` simply nostalgia '', 
  i do n't know why you keep going on about this point . 
  i 've been quite explicit about the fact that i also do n't really care for such changes . 
  but i 'm not sure i agree with your analogies for * why * it 's not a good idea . 
  in this case , we have the * artist * going back and deciding * he * liked it better a certain way . 
  now , we the public have every right to disagree with lucas , and i certainly do disagree with all the random bullshit background * noise * he put in . 
  but we have to accept that it is the artist 's canonical interpretation of the world . 
  it 's more like if beethoven went back and decided `` hmm ... actually , i think i like it better this way , let 's change that part '' . 
  and you know what ? 
  he actually did that a number of times . 
  [ leonard bernstein , the renowned musicologist , has a fantastic lecture about many of the changes he made in the process of composing his 5th symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1klmxuer8 ) , most of it concentrating on the first movement . 
  personally , i actually think i * prefer * one of his endings to the one he ended up using , but i would never * dream * of performing the piece in any way other than the finalised version . 
  edit : actually , i just remembered another very different example from symphony no. 5 . 
  there 's a point in the recapitulation ( the bit near the end where they repeat the main themes from the beginning , but changed somewhat ) where beethoven gives the bassoon a motif that , in the exposition ( the aforementioned bit from the beginning ) , was played by the horns . 
  many orchestras today give that same bit to the horns . 
  the reasoning is that beethoven probably gave it to the bassoons because the horns of his day were incapable of playing in both the key the rest of the piece used , and the key that one particular bit needed . 
  but there is also a counter-argument that perhaps beethoven intended this anyway -- the horns that would have been needed for that part to work were on stage already for the fourth movement , it would have been simple to ask them to change in the middle of the movement -- and that he wanted the bassoon to play it because , from a thematic point of view , the weaker sounding bassoon sort of fit in with the overall structure of the piece : playing the heroic theme at the end sounding weaker , foreshadowing the ultimate `` victory '' of the dark side in this movement . 
  bernstein seems to subscribe to this argument , since that 's what he 's used in the above lecture when the perform the whole movement at the end . 
  both of these interpretations are perfectly valid and accepted , because we can not truly know what the composer would have intended today , and both have good arguments in favour of them .

  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  i do n't think that the mere fact that they answered it on twitter is a sign that `` it 's confusing enough '' .
