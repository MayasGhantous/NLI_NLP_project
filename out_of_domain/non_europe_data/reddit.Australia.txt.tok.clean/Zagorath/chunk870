  they answer whatever questions they feel like on twitter , and sometimes those questions are actually fairly obvious . 
  if a clarification makes it into an errata , or to a lesser extent into a sage advice * column * , then that 's some sign that wizards believes there truly was ambiguity in the rule . 
  i 'm kinda disappointed that every answer here so far has been talking about mechanics . 
  what sets them apart * most * in my eyes is how they play from a roleplay perspective . 
  warlocks are one of the most fascinating classes to roleplay , if you 've got a good dm . 
  mechanically they 're good but nothing special , but it 's their flavour that truly sets them apart . 
  the fey or fiend patrons have the amazing ability to involve themselves in their warlocks ' lives . 
  get the warlock to do specific things for them , or just more generally work towards a greater end that the patron desires . 
  they can attempt to corrupt the warlock over time , or attempt to get the warlock to see that their way makes sense . 
  it 's sort of like the pull of the one ring , or ( to use an example that 's somewhat more in the zeitgeist at the moment ) the allure of the dark side of the force . 
  the more you use it , the more you * want * to use it , the more corrupted you become . 
  great old one warlocks play a little differently , since they typically will not directly inject themselves in your campaign , but they can be a corrupting force of different sort . 
  instead of the use of their power driving a warlock to evil , they drive her to madness , which has some fantastic roleplay possibilities , even without the help from the dm . 
  my warlock , for example , was a fiendlock whose patron was an archdevil trapped within a book -- my book of shadows . 
  my patron 's main goal was to get out of the book , and he hoped that by granting me the powers of the hells i would be more capable of achieving that end . 
  i also played it as an intensely corrupting force , where i started out as very innocent and na\u00efve , but mid-way through the campaign , i went and slaughtered some semi-innocent satyrs ( a scene that , as i realised * after * i had decided that 's what i wanted to do , but * before * i actually managed to go through with it , rather resembled anakin slaughtering the sand people in episode 2 ) . 
  but the thing about warlocks is that , outside of the goo , they are very reliant on your dm roleplaying the patron well for all this to reach its maximum potential . 
  ( edit : i just realised that you mentioned goo . 
  i missed that at first , and so while i touched upon all of them , i concentrated on the fiend and fey patrons , since they 're the more traditional warlocks and imo the more interesting ones . 
  still , some of what i said still applies . ), 
  sorcerers have a very different flavour . 
  a sorcerer has magic naturally within them for some reason . 
  a shadow sorcerer , in particular , has been touched in some way by the shadowfell . 
  the fun part of that is : how exactly were you `` touched '' by the shadowfell ? 
  does your character know from whence the powers come ? 
  if not , does he care ? 
  does he want to uncover the mystery ? 
  if he * does * know , is he interested in getting in touch with that aspect , or not ? 
  you have this great magical potential within you , so how do you look upon other wielders of magic ? 
  do you look upon wizards with disdain for not having that natural potential and needing to study for it , or do you look upon them with respect for working so hard to achieve what comes naturally to you ? 
  for what purpose do you want to use your powers ? 
  to further your own personal goals , or for the greater good . 
  are you glad of the powers that you have , or do you see them as a curse thrust upon you ? 
  the critical success podcast ( a fantastic podcast in general ) has [ a really good episode ] ( http://peachesandhotsauce.com/podcasts/11-voicing-characters ) that 's all about voice acting . 
  one general piece of advice from it is that the most efficient thing to do is not put on an entirely new voice ( let 's face it , you 're probably not matt mercer , who can get away with that ) , but simply put on an affect . 
  speak quicker or slower , just deepen your voice slightly , or make it more anxious . 
  things like that . 
  just adopting a different * posture * and speaking in a way that seems to befit that posture can also really help . 
  but i do highly recommend giving that episode a listen . 
  and if you liked it , listen to more episodes , because the vast majority of them are extremely good . 
  the more recent ( from `` blue rose '' and onward ) ones have n't been the same quality imo , but they 're worth a listen too .

  congratulations to all the winners . 
  this is certainly a * very * interesting result . 
  looking at the opinion polls , and even the voter verification thread , i would have expected 3-1 , or at least 2-2 with the * last * vote going to labor . 
  but 2-2 where the last elected senator was a fascist is very surprising . 
   polearm , polearm master , and the sentinel feat, 
  haha . 
  try combining that with the tunnel fighter option from the underdark unearthed arcana , and someone else on your team who is a warlock with repelling blast ( to push them away from the fighter , requiring them to move * towards * the fighter on their next turn , which triggers polearm master 's oa ) . 
  insane synergy there . 
   perhaps even creating anakin knowing that he would finally destroy palpatine, 
  not sure about this aspect , since as far as i 'm aware , anakin was born long before plagueis 's death ( or `` death '' , whichever it is ) . 
  was n't plagueis still alive during the phantom menace ? 
  and the kid was like 10 then . 
  but i do like the theory in general .

  part 2 of a review by the excellent composer and orchestrator thomas goss of the music in the latest film . 
  this part concentrates on williams ' use of trombones specifically . 
  it 's aimed chiefly at musicians , but i think there 's probably enough in there even for people with only a cursory understanding of compositional techniques . 
  [ here 's a link to `` episode i '' of the review ] ( http://orchestrationonline.com/orchestration-reviews/star-wars-force-awakens-orchestration-review-episode-fan-dom-menace/ ) , which takes a more general look at the approaches used for the score in general . 
  the honourable members will refrain from interrupting . 
  ( paging / u/3fun as well ), 
  fwiw it 's not a `` filter '' per se . 
  it 's an hdr shot , where you take two or more images at different exposure compensations and merge them into one photo . 
  you can not preemptively call for a division .
