  i was reading the second answer from everyone , because i had assumed they would answer in the order specified when the bells began to ring ... 
  clerk / u/jnd-au , ring division bells for four minutes . 
  the doors must remain open . 
  a member may leave the area of members ' seats unless he or she called for the division . 
  after four minutes have elapsed the doors shall be locked and no member may enter or leave the chamber until after the division . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  members voting `` aye '' to move to the right side of the chair , and the members voting `` no '' to move to the left . 
  ( meta : reply telling me which side to which you moved . ), 
  no member may move from his or her place from the commencement of the count until the result of that division is announced . 
  # the doors will be locked at 0700\u00a022/12 / 2015 , utc +10 with the final count, 
  zagorath , speaker of the house,

  no , i ca n't say i do . 
  but honestly , if it is n't bash , or using nearly identical syntax with the same installed programmes ( just the basic ones like ` cd ` , ` grep ` , ` find ` , ` ls ` , ` vim ` , ` ssh ` , etc. ), 
  as found on a typical linux install or on os x , i 'm still not going to like it . 
  the motion proposed in the op , by / u/phyllicanderer in your name , has succeeded . 
  we were using it as if it had succeeded already after the voice vote , but technically because a division was called , it had n't until just now . 
  another meta comment on this :, 
  is this not a bill that directly contradicts the recently passed motion which specified vote and debate times of 12 hours ? 
  my guess is it 's auto-hdr , not something manually put through photomatrix or something like that . 
  not just `` the other member '' . 
  both members who called for division appear to have left the chamber . 
  the member for the act / u/forkalious and the member for outer sydney / u/thewhiteferret will remove themselves under 94 ( a ) . 
  zagorath , speaker for the house, 
  it really depends on what you want it for . 
  for me , all the effort i went to was eventually worth it . 
  i 've got my ubuntu system now up running a personal web server , and acting as an ssh server so i can access my files and update my server even from away from home . 
  for that purpose , linux is perfect . 
  windows is just terrible from this front , and os x is n't much better ( and , since it has to be run on a mac -- barring hackintoshes -- it 's insanely badly priced to just run a server on ) . 
  but for the average user ? 
  web browsing , document processing , and a few games here and there ? 
  yeah , definitely , do n't touch it with a 10 foot pole . 
   linux 's primary focus has been headless ( no display ) servers, 
  that is absolutely true , and for these sorts of purposes , linux is frankly * perfect * . 
  but that is * not * the primary purpose of distributions such as ubuntu and mint , which are primarily focused at the same market as windows and os x : end users ' pcs . 
  i actually use ubuntu as a server , but i like having the gui too because as much as i enjoy using vim , text editing with a gui is just easier , so i often like to be able to use a gui while editing files on my web server . 
  but when i 'm not working on files associated with the server , i boot back into windows , because it 's just a better environment to do average tasks in . 
  i do n't believe so . 
  i updated it a while ago to automatically grab the current list each time it pages . 
  leave is sought and the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease no later than 1220\u00a022/12 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  ## votes, 
  ** ayes ** : 8, 
  ** noes ** : 0, 
  abstentions / yet to vote : 3, 
  i think the ayes have it . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for vote on leave of absence, 
  wait damn . 
  i thought this was one of the ones that does n't need to be chaired , like cid ... 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  vote by replying aye or no . 
  voting will cease no later than 1200 , 22/12/2015 , utc +10 . 
  ** ayes ** : 2, 
  ** noes ** : 0, 
  abstentions / yet to vote : 10, 
  it sounds like the vote did not reach a quorum . 
  the motion fails . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  i thought this definition was funnier :, 
   a person who looks after a church and churchyard , sometimes acting as bell-ringer and formerly as a gravedigger . 
  hear , hear !, 
  remember , an evil person does n't have to be all-out hating everything evil . 
  evil people can have loved ones and friends that they would n't want to hurt . 
  if you can find a reason for those to be your own party members , that 's going to work out * so * much better . 
  my character did n't start out wanting to be evil . 
  she just wanted to be an adventurer and help people , and joined the party to do that . 
  gradual influence from the devil turned her evil , but she still cares greatly about the people she was adventuring with . 
  is he correct that an absolute majority would be needed for this motion to succeed ? 
  that is , they would need to get 6 votes ? 
  the results from the division are in . 
  as there are fewer than 4 members on my right , under standing order 127 , and as this motion needs an absolute majority of the members of parliament in order to succeed , i declare the result immediately for the noes . 
  ### the motion fails . 
  the members in the minority will be recorded in hansard :, 
  * 3fun, 
  * thewhiteferret, 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  meta , assuming this is correct , someone enable it at 0700 . 
   i know something you do n't know . 
  to further clarify this , there are two types of scrolls . 
  spell scrolls help you to cast an existing spell . 
  other magical scrolls have their own special effects . 
  currently the only magic scroll that is * not * a spell scroll is the aforementioned scroll of protection , but we could theoretically get more of these in the future . 
  indeed , budget is an important question . 
  you 're probably not going to get anything worthwhile for under $ 100 , but you can go up as high as you want . 
  i recently bought a zoom h1 . 
  it 's near the lowest end of that spectrum , but it 's a nice all-around mic that works nicely for both recording myself playing and recording larger ensembles like orchestras , but i can also use for voice recording or for skype calls . 
  hear , hear !, 
  unfortunately , i fear being posted so late compared to the others , this 'll have no chance of winning . 
  i do n't think it needs to be voted on . 
  i ca n't see why it would be different to any other adjournment . 
  well , mr chair , this appears to just about cover everything . 
  i have nothing to add . 
  i must say , mr chair , i 'm not sure what the intent of any of these is . 
  ( a ) is the intent to make our current use of electorates that thoroughly do not match the real-life populations of areas more legitimate ? 
  if so , then i wholeheartedly support it . 
  if you mean something else , i 'm not sure . 
  ( b ) is this not already possible ? 
  i know it is irl .
