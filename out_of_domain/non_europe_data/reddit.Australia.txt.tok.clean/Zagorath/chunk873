  in truth , i 've not looked very much at the system used for this in the model parliament . 
  my biggest issue with it is that it could be far too easy for citizens to move seats for purely strategic reasons , and i do not believe that this should be allowed . 
  ( c ) a proportional system , but not stv ? 
  which system do you propose ? 
  if it 's mmp or any other system with party lists , i oppose the motion with every fibre of my being . 
  besides , with 11 seats , how much can we do ? 
  ( d ) i truly have n't even the slightest idea what the proposal here is . 
  but i like the current electorate names . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  the honourable member for the northern territory still appears to have a purple flair . 
  your history suggests you 've already seen episode vii , so surely you know that this technique * has * been used in canon ? 
  leia 's ship gets captured no where near tatooine , the droids land on some other random planet . 
  fair enough . 
  even easier , right click on the area , inspect element , remove the css that caused them to be spoilered . 
  take a single screenshot , no editing needed . 
  create the general shape using large and medium brushes on positive sculpt . 
  then use tiny brushes on negative to carve out the finer details . 
  except that it is . 
  anyone know what that is in a more meaningful set of units , like min/km ? 
   should there be speed limits on highways ? 
  careful now . 
  i agree with the point you 're making , but this one is not like the others . 
  speed limits affect not just the driver in question , but everyone on the road . 
  [ just sharing this because it 's relevant and interesting ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s4259939.htm ) . 
  yeah that 's it . 
  remove the newer saves from that folder in explorer . 
  i do n't actually use inkarnate anymore , i 've found it too limiting . 
  but from memory , it should automatically blend around the edges of each terrain . 
  i use photoshop . 
  it 's a lot more effort than inkarnate , but provides a lot more flexibility . 
  i use a technique very similar to inkarnate , with a layer for the areas that have land , layers for different terrains ( as opposed to a single layer that you paint on all terrains ) , a layer for roads , and one for cities , etc. 
  it requires some basic-to-intermediate knowledge of photoshop , particularly as pertains to layers and blending , but it 's really not too challenging . 
  the hardest part has honestly been following tutorials online for how to create each of the terrains , but it 's been pretty easy to find them , and the steps are usually pretty comprehensive . 
  still , it 's a lot more work than throwing something together using inkarnate , and it always will be . 
  inkarnate is surprisingly useful for such a simple tool , and i honestly would have been okay with it except i wanted to trace over a map i had drawn by hand , which i could do in photoshop easily , but inkarnate provided no way of achieving . 
  aww , there i was hoping summoner school would be somehow related to the ps2 video game ( later ported to pc ) . 
  as quorum was not reached in the previous vote , we will perform a count out and vote again . 
  the question is put : that the motion be agreed to . 
  reply present , and then vote by including `` aye '' or `` no '' . 
  voting will cease no later than 1000\u00a025/12 / 2015 , utc +10 . 
  ## votes, 
  ** ayes ** : 2, 
  ** noes ** : 0, 
  absent / yet to vote : 9, 
  the vote has failed to reach a quorum , and thus the question will be adjourned until the next sitting .

  in accordance with standing order 32 , the question is put : that the house now adjourn until 04/01/2016 . 
  voting will cease no later than 1100\u00a025/12 / 2015 , utc +10 .

  ### i think the ayes have it, 
  the house will now adjourn until the 4th january . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
  ! page for vote on adjournment until january, 
  that 's correct , but i try to keep the paging messages simple ( as they 're an informal aid to members , and not an official part of the parliamentary system ) , and a suspension of standing orders in order to allow a motion of no confidence is likely to be voted on in the same way as the vote of no confidence itself . 
  anyone who cares about the difference will read the motion anyway . 
   previous lack of quorum shows the failure that is the prime minister, 
  the member for western australia will refrain from interrupting . 
  good catch . 
  fixed . 
  the member for western australia will remove himself under 94 ( a ) . 
  the member for sydney will refrain from referring to members by name , and from interrupting . 
  the member for the act will refrain from interrupting . 
  i * name * the member for the act under 94 ( b ) . 
  standing orders state that the speaker immediately puts the question . 
  actually , on second reading , i may have been a little hasty . 
   on a motion being moved , the speaker shall put, 
  the question, 
  i missed the first part of that . 
  does it just keep going until it reaches a quorum ? 
  i mean , he has the world 's most popular notation software named after him . 
  that has to count for something , right ? 
  definitely true , but it looks ugly . 
  as the motion to suspend standing orders was moved without notice , and the vote has not achieved an absolute majority , the motion fails . 
  zagorath , speaker of the house, 
   we will aim to be more co-operative with the canadian people, 
  aww , i 'm actually kinda disappointed at this . 
  not that i agree with the anti-canadian philosophy of the republicans and fascists , but it was pretty hilarious to watch from the outside . 
  well , except when that incremental change is a step backwards , i 'm sure you will agree . 
  you may not agree on what constitutes `` backwards '' , but virtually everyone can agree that `` bad change is worse than no change '' . 
  no apostrophe when you 're referring to more than one of something , mate . 
  apostrophes are for possession or contracting ( usually of the word `` is '' or `` was '' ) . 
  nah mate , he 's clearly using the rarely-used [ noun form of `` get '' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/get#noun ) , referring to the hero 's offspring . 
  is there something wrong with google maps ? 
  what is it that needs to be done to get the things that have passed both houses to be assented to ? 
  the pm has informed me i apparently need to send them somewhere , but looking through my history i do n't think i 've done that at any point recently ... 
  so are you talking about early the morning of boxing day , or christmas ? 
  they do n't have `` superior darkvision '' , which , as you say , means 120 feet . 
  they just have `` darkvision '' , part of the description for which says `` superior vision in dark and dim conditions '' .
