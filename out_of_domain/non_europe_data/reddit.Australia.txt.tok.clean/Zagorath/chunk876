  hell , in their quest to find problems with the prequels , i 've seen people criticise some of the * best * parts of them . 
  the * incredible * lightsaber duels , like with darth maul vs. qui gon and obi wan , yoda vs. dooku , anakin vs. sidious , yoda vs. sidious , and of course anakin vs. obi wan . 
  the lightsaber battles are the single * best * bit of the damn films . 
  they 're not good films , but you do n't need to go around finding problems where there are n't any !, 
  huh , so it was . 
  whatever , it was dumb anyway , i probably just glazed over the details ... 
  mechanically it 's a great choice . 
  controlling the action economy is a sure fire way to win even the most challenging encounters with ease , and animate dead is such a powerful way to control the field . 
  up to four that can be maintained with a single spell slot ? 
  awesome !, 
  in a standard party that 's double the number of turns per round . 
  um guessing that 's where by-election comes from as well ? 
  there are probably more complicated examples , but the one you mentioned seems pretty trivial , to be frank . 
  it 's not hard , just a lot of different fields . 
  all the api call would do is trivially retrieve the data from the database , and all the details are pretty simple . 
  i would also highly suggest viewing dndgreentext by [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , since there are a few great posts in there from when the subreddit was too small for these posts to make the / top of all time . 
  and within that subreddit , [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) is a great place to start for some of the greatest stories . 
  i was gon na call you out for saying it 's `` written in c '' , and say that it could be any c-like language . 
  but then i noticed the use of `` argc '' . 
  as far as i know , that 's pretty much an exclusively c thing . 
  [ this is the d&d basic rules ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/basicrules_playerv3.4.pdf ) . 
  you 'll find information about skills on page 59 , half way down the eight hand column . 
  the bold headings for things like athletics , acrobatics , and sleight of hand are the skills . 
  the larger headings like strength and dexterity are the primary abilities that those skills under them key off of . 
  op obviously plays a very old edition of the game . 
  diplomacy has since been renamed persuasion , and sense motive now carries the far less clumsy name of insight . 
  [ ping ] ( / r/habitrpg/comments / 3yfazf/newbie _ here_while_drafting_my_habits_i_took / cydmo4t ), 
   tbh i think they should have had supergirl just replace superman from the start and crash land in the cwverse . 
  i thought this , too , before the show aired . 
  thought : what if , rather than superman providing her inspiration to get into superheroing , it was barry ? 
  and i still think that could have been good . 
  but in my opinion , they 've really done a good job with the story the way they 've gone about it , and they 've made the most of the fact that they * did n't * do that , doing things with the superman-supergirl relationship that could only be done between those two characters . 
  they still are going to have to confront the issue of `` why does n't superman help out with the huge big-bads that come up , especially kryptonians , but so far they 've just * barely * managed to avoid it being an issue . 
  it will need to be answered soon though . 
   you 're not a cat , you 're a ungrateful moron . 
  so , which is it ? 
  you ca n't have it both ways . 
  why . 
  why would you go to all the effort of uploading onto gfycat , only to then link to the gods damn gif version of the file anyway ? 
  * why ? 
  well , here 's the non shit version of the same link . 
  that was hard . 
  but by all means , go around downvoting people trying to be helpful . 
  `` still here '' ? 
  dude , it was removed in under an hour . 
  just so you know , you 've been shadowbanned . 
  you should contact the reddit admins to get that fixed . 
  sir bearington was submitted very early on in the subreddit 's history , and thus it did n't get many upvotes solely because there were n't many subscribers . 
  the best stories to be found are not in / top , but in [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  sorry , not a clue . 
  presumably at some point in the past you broke some reddit-wide rule . 
  these days , shadowbanning is supposed to * only * be used on spambots , but in the past it was used for far more minor infringements . 
  you might have been caught up in that . 
  another technical point : you should share small scores like this in the key as written , not concert pitch . 
  i do n't use musescore , but in any half-decent scoring software it should only be a single button press to toggle between concert pitch and written pitch . 
  wtf is `` dia de los innocentes '' ? 
   it 's like april fool 's day in spanish speaking countries, 
  haha thanks , i guessed that from the name :p, 
  the rest of your comment answers the question i actually had , so thanks . 
  i must say , it seems like a really bizarre step to go from `` someone tried to kill baby jesus '' to `` let 's play pranks on people '' . 
  but then , it makes about as much sense as `` we 're changing the date of the new year , so let 's play pranks on people '' . 
  i definitely think that should be dm 's discretion , and not something built in to the race , but i also think that in most standard situations , any dm that * does n't * impose some sort of penalty for it would be dming * wrong * in a very objective way . 
  it 's similar to existing races like the drow and tieflings . 
  there 's no mechanical roleplay penalty , but in a typical campaign in a standard setting , most people would be hesitant to deal with them in the same way they would with an elf or human . 
  but i also think that , frankly , in the most standard type of campaign , a dm would be better off simply not allowing an undead race that is visibly undead , like a ghost or skeleton . 
  a vryloka can * easily * pass as alive , and i can see a revenant passing for it as well , with a bit of effort . 
  instead , these sorts of races should be left for horror campaigns , or very exotic campaign settings . 
  [ this one 's actually in our hall of fame ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2178r7/the_story_of_the_drunken_fighter/ ) , as `` the drunken fighter '' , since that 's what said paladin was pretending to be . 
  if that feather is a raven feather , and the dark red vaguely resembles blood , that 's doubly awesome . 
  as a brisbanite who spends a significant portion of the year overseas in sea , sydney is by far my preference . 
  closer to brisbane while i 'm in australia , and also since most international communications go through sydney , it might make the game playable while i 'm overseas . 
   reboot is the consensus among core players, 
  i would like to voice a dissenting opinion . 
  i think a reboot is ultimately a detriment to the parliament . 
  could i get an explanation as to what exactly happened ? 
  the progressives decided to merge with the greens , as their place on the political spectrum was closer than with labor . 
  the prime minister then called for an ( early ? ), 
  election . 
  what i do n't get is , why the jump from this to the resignation of our most important member and the shutting down of parliament entirely ? 
  where did that come from ? 
  to me , it feels like a total non sequitur . 
   key players want to go for an mhoc model, 
  what exactly is an mhoc model ? 
  i have n't been involved with mhoc and frankly do n't have much interest in joining a foreign model government . 
  do they do things substantially differently from how we have ? 
  disagree . 
  the flexible election terms are an important useful part of the westminster system of government . 
  god no . 
  should not even be considered . 
  sounds good, 
  jesus no . 
  the ability to make amendments to a bill is * crucial * . 
  i do n't know how this differs from how questions without notice already works , and frankly i think the current system works fine . 
  unfortunately , i think yes , but 8 is too small . 
  if we 're going unicameral , kick it up to 16 or so . 
  vote using stv . 
  ideally i would * prefer * to use the current bicameral system and expand it to about double its current size . 
  but the number of active participants is too low for that , so in the mean time , a smaller system is necessary . 
  16 is still less than we currently have elected to parliament , so i think that 's a reasonable start . 
  eh ... i 'm not * totally * against this , but i just do n't see it as necessary .
