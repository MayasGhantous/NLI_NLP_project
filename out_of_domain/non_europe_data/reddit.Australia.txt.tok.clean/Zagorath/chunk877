  i do n't think we should change things from how real parliament works except where it would benefit the smooth running of a smaller , asynchronous , online model parliament . 
  how does having a speaker that is not an elected mp do this ? 
  we already have a robust electoral system . 
  let 's not change it to a more simplistic and probably less robust one . 
  i feel like * both * costing an action * and * reducing movement speed to ( near - ) zero is a bit harsh , but i can definitely see it being one or the other . 
  perhaps if it were to cost an action to start , and be a bonus action to keep the defensive stance active , but while it 's active , movement speed is 5 ft. ? 
  more generally , i definitely like the delayed feedback on uas . 
  you 're not the first person i 've seen compare paragon paths and epic destinies to prestige classes . 
  to be honest , i do n't see the similarity . 
  paragon paths were far more like class archetypes . 
  a mandatory selection between a select number of options related to your base class , made once you reach a certain point . 
  i 've got ta be honest i was hesitant about prestige classes at first . 
  i agree with you regarding 3 . x , and i want to see as little of the bloat from that edition come forward as possible . 
  unnecessarily fine detail in skills -- particularly regarding the different skills available , but also in choosing a number of points in each skill -- classes and races that overlap too much in their function and flavour , and things like that . 
  so i saw prestige classes as a step in the wrong direction . 
  but i 've thought about it a bit more since , and i 've seen some homebrew prestige classes , and i now think that it 's a pretty good idea . 
  it is absolutely essential that they do ** not ** step on the toes of an existing class , so `` archmage '' or similar ** must not ** come around . 
  but prestige classes that let you do completely new things are great , so long as attention is paid to their balance . 
  i think they should err on the side of caution and make them underpowered when i doubt , but obviously try to keep as close to the curve as possible , to keep it equivalent to any other multiclass . 
  prestige classes should he primarily aimed at flavour and having reasonable mechanics to make them a good enough choice anyway , rather than something powergamers will drool over with some token attempts at flavour to justify it . 
  but so long as they do all that , i think there 's a lot of good that can be done with prestige classes . 
  an example of what i consider an * extremely * good prestige class is / u/the _ singular_anyone 's [ vampire prestige class ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/3qnv6q/vampire_prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big/ ) . 
  it has really strong flavour that is n't possible within the game rules as they exist ( and no , the template in the mm does n't count -- it is n't anything close to balanced , it does n't even * try * to be ) , and at least according to the consensus of people who helped review it , it 's fairly reasonable within the balance curve of the game . 
   quirks and flaws for the shadow sorcerer and undying warlock are great and we need more of those for other classes, 
  i agree , i love the idea . 
  but my feedback for the warlock was that the specific options given were lame . 
  they 're basically all just variations of `` you like light and do n't like dark '' , except for number 4 . 
  brilliant idea , and * beautifully * executed with the sorcerer , but the warlock did n't do a good job of it . 
  what , you find `` go to website , enter vote , leave a comment verifying the vote '' too complicated ? 
  frankly , if that 's too much work , this is n't the hobby for you . 
  oh god , hear , hear !, 
  you just perfectly expressed how i 've felt about this feature , but i 've never been able to put it into words well enough to actually leave a comment about it . 
   they only get half as many bonus spells as the other patrons, 
  it 's * very * important to note that , while this is disappointing compared to other patrons , it 's not all * that * bad . 
  after all , warlocks do n't * get * the extra spells from their patron , they 're just given the * option * of choosing them as one of their already limited spells . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of using 1d2 , since the coin is not a standard rpg die . 
  even so , it seems the best way to achieve something lower than 1d4 but better than 1 . 
  for the table , why do you include rows where medium has 2d4 , 2d8 , 2d10 , and 2d12 ? 
  no weapons deal that type of damage . 
  and if you do have those , why is it that 2d4 is met with 1d2 rather than 2d2 ? 
  just a typo ? 
  or is there some particular reason for it ? 
   i believe the sp system notes that 7-9th level spells can only be cast once per long rest . 
  it 's 6th and higher . 
  which makes sense : that 's the same as when a warlock 's mystic arcanum takes over from their normal spell slots . 
  to be honest , made up names would be better than letters . 
  their names probably do n't * really * matter too much to the telling of the story . 
  just a tip , if you 're writing prose like this , you do n't need to throw greentext tags onto it . 
  it would look better if you simply wrote it out as normal text . 
  personally , i played it for the first time a few years ago , and i would say no . 
  the plot was nothing special . 
  not * terrible * , just kinda ... nonexistent , really . 
  mechanically , i 'm sure it 's true what everyone says . 
  that it was absolutely groundbreaking for its time and served as the inspiration that influenced the way first person shooters developed for the next decade and a half . 
  but as a game to play in and of itself ? 
  ladders are impossible to use , especially if you need to go * down * one in a hurry while under fire . 
  puzzles involving moving boxes around are impossible because they move half way across the room with the slightest touch . 
  and , worst of all , the graphics lie about where the edge of ledges and platforms are . 
  it can * look * like you 're just behind the edge , about to jump across to the next ledge -- and there are a fair few times in the game where this sort of platforming-like game play is required -- but when you press spacebar , you fall off the ledge instead . 
  put simply , the game is * infuriating * to play for someone used to the mechanical polish we have in even the most flawed games today , and the story is n't anywhere near sufficient to make up for that . 
  i ca n't comment on black mesa . 
  i 've personally avoided it because it is n't finished . 
  yay , first video of 2016 ( in utc +7 and greater ) !, 
  a pretty simple one , but a fun watch nonetheless . 
  no but seriously , who is that ? 
  not real brady , stick-figure brady holding the hi flag claiming the unclaimed area of antarctica . 
  that depends . 
  how many times per day do you check reddit ? 
  certainly he would consider it utc or less , since he 's likely either in britain or america , and since it 's currently winter , it could n't be greater than utc \u00b1 0 . 
  so i highly doubt grey considers this the first video of 2016 . 
  but from where i 'm sitting , it is , so i figured i 'd point that out . 
  i nominate `` the hilands '' . 
  fifa is evil . 
  so is nestle . 
  but only one of these is infamous for being evil in a way related to selling water . 
  yeah that was my best guess , too . 
   the comparison between prestige classes and paragon paths is made because it was wotc themselves that intended paragon paths to be a new iteration on the idea of `` when you hit a higher level , you get to select a further specialization and theme '', 
  that sounds just like class archetypes to me , but later on , rather than in the first three levels . 
  it 's further specialisation related to your current class . 
  multiclassing , and prestige classes , are completely different . 
  they 're the character choosing to take on a completely new area of interest . 
   of course , in 4e you 're effectively creating your own archetype out of thin air as you cherry-pick powers, 
  i do n't agree . 
  powers feel more to me like what in 5e is selecting class options . 
  spells , warlock invocations , sorcerer metamagic options , fighting styles , that kind of thing . 
   if you want to make a guardian fighter , take the sure strike and tide of iron at-will powers , the covering attack encounter power , and the comeback strike daily power, 
  helpful suggestions . 
  5e has these in the form of `` quick builds '' . 
  a great theory , and i wish that this were the model they had gone with . 
  however , i am not entirely convinced that it would be a viable solution . 
  wikipedia has an * enormous * userbase : it 's a top 5 website in the * world * . 
  as they say during the drives , they only need a fraction of those users to donate a tiny amount in order sustain themselves . 
  imslp has a * far * more niche userbase . 
  and worse than that , their bandwidth per user requirements are * far * higher than wikipedia 's . 
  the average article on wp is a few thousand characters of text , and three or four low-res images . 
  imslp users download large pdfs . 
  now , of course , there is a counterargument . 
  imslp users are probably , on average , far more dedicated and invested in the site than wp users , so you would probably get a higher percentage of donators than wp gets . 
  even so , i 'm not sure if it would be enough . 
  the wait time is 20 seconds ?
