  well fuck . 
  that should have been in the title . 
  everyone knows that nobody reads the article , and 20 seconds is a * huge * difference from where my mind went , which was a period of a day or more . 
  i guess the word `` waiting period '' made me think of the sorts of waiting periods we hear about in the news regarding things such as purchasing guns etc. 
   indeed , waiting for a file is reminiscent of the virus-ridden , advertisement-heavy illegal download websites of the past, 
  this is the key part of it . 
  i associate a waiting period to download with low quality sketchy websites . 
  but , if this is what 's needed for imslp to continue to exist and to be free to use , then fine . 
   if i want to learn a beethoven sonata , can i afford to take the time to wait for each different scan and edition to download so that i find the best ? 
  yes . 
  the answer is yes , i can . 
  as long as the waiting time is n't too punishing . 
  10 -- 20 seconds , no more . 
  to be honest , most of the time i find a score i 'm happy with on the first or at worst second try . 
  i could have a score in under a minute even with the waiting period . 
  this is going to mean i 'm going to more frequently download and save scores i find , and probably try to archive them a little better on my local hard drive , so that i 'm hitting up imslp less frequently , but my respect for the site does not change as a result of them doing what they feel necessary to stay afloat . 
  # pricing update, 
  according to [ this article ] ( http://slippedisc.com/2015/12/musicians-are-made-to-wait-as-free-site-goes-pay-for/#sthash.ikl9agma.dpuf ) , the cost of membership will be ** $ 22.80 ** , and the waiting period for free users will be ** 15 seconds ** . 
  nah man , i totally feel you . 
  i loved the model we 've been going with , and i 'm rather proud of what we 've managed to accomplished in our short time . 
  to see all of that undone would be ... disappointing in the extreme . 
  yes , a more simplified model would probably attract more users , but a huge part of the * fun * of this was in learning how the australian parliament functions and operating within those bounds . 
  any idiot can say `` yeah , let 's make gay marriage legal '' . 
  but enacting a bill to enable marriage equality within the structure of a ( n approximation of a ) real parliament ? 
  that was a real accomplishment !, 
  and you kept this whole thing running . 
  i think you have every right to want to see this subreddit left alone out of respect for all you 've helped us accomplish . 
   i have no idea about what 's going on between the progressives and greens . 
  i did n't realise there was a merger until you just mentioned it, 
  whoops . 
  hope i did n't let slip something that is n't supposed to be public yet . 
  not that it seems to matter anymore , anyway ... 
  i would say that that is * especially * true of the goo , since they can frequently view themselves ( quite rightly , in many cases ) as above it all . 
  they simply do n't care about the world and its goings-on . 
  if someone were playing a fiend - or fey-lock , it would be a bit more of a waste of a character if you * did n't * involve their patron in some way . 
  $ 1.90 per month is a terrible deal ? 
  i mean , sure , i 'm not going to be paying it , i 'm more than happy to wait , but it 's hardly an enormous amount . 
   if you 're really broke , make some contributions to the content and get a free membership, 
  you say that like it 's a feasible option for most people . 
  imslp is n't wikipedia . 
  it is n't something that just anyone * can * meaningfully contribute to . 
  you have to have access to public domain copies of scores . 
  and since imslp has been around as long as it has , you 're going to have to have a copy of really rare and obscure scores before you can contribute anything . 
  and we have a national anthem !, 
  huh ? 
  * the united kingdom is named describing what it is ( it 's a kingdom that is made up of several united entities ) . 
  * austria is named based on its location : it derives from `` eastern realm '' . 
  * netherlands derives from `` low lands '' , describing its elevation . 
  * australia derives from australis , meaning southern . 
  plenty of countries are named for things other than the people who live there . 
  was she actually supposed to appear ? 
  i was under the impression that she was always meant to be just an easter-egg , no more than what we ended up getting . 
  the best source to answer basic rules questions is your player 's handbook . 
  for me , what makes good soundtracks good , and great ones great , is use of leitmotif . 
  there is * so much * that can be said about many of williams ' scores in terms of analysing their different themes and how he uses them . 
  we see this with the theories that snoke is darth plagueis . 
  a theory that , frankly , is based * entirely * on williams ' score , and wishful thinking . 
  i just recently saw a theory on the orchestration online facebook group that suggests rey and kylo ren might be related , by analysing their themes , and noting that they [ are close to retrogrades of one another ] ( https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t31.0-8/12473612_10153479391627800_1807638877103886438_o.jpg ) ( though this is a theory that 's already out there ) . 
  other great scores like shore 's for lord of the rings , djawadi in game of thrones , or zuckerman 's avatar score also make heavy use of leitmotifs for people and places as well objects and abstract ideas . 
  sure , in many cases each of these composers grabs themes from elsewhere . 
  jaws was the opening to the 4th movement of symphony from the new world , vader 's theme might have been inspired by mars , etc. , etc. , etc. 
  but all of that is frankly irrelevant . 
  it 's what the composer * does * with the theme that matters . 
  we do n't criticise mozart for taking `` ah , vous dirai-je maman '' ( that 's twinkle twinkle , to the modern anglophile ) and making an entire piece using nothing but that theme . 
  we do n't criticise beethoven for the opening to the second movement of his 5th symphony being a carbon copy of the opening theme of the final movement of mozart 's symphony no . 
  40 , or beethoven 's sonata no . 
  14 for borrowing from the commendatore 's death scene in mozart 's don giovanni . 
  and nor should we . 
  copying themes even wholesale is and should be perfectly acceptable . 
  borrowing themes and changing them a bit even more so . 
  the same is true with john williams and other film composers . 
  criticise them on their * own * merits , not based on whether or not their themes are 100 % original . 
  john williams is one of the best composers out there today . 
  note i did not say `` film '' composers , because he surely is that . 
  he is one of the greatest composers , full stop . 
  his ability to create scores that are both supremely good background music during the film and are worth downloading and listening to on their own is a rare gift . 
  and from a critical analysis point of view , the way he uses themes is incredible . 
  anakin 's theme , from the star wars prequels ( particularly phantom menace ) was based melodically on vader 's theme , but really only in a * very * subtle way for the most part ( it has more explicit quotations later on in the piece ) . 
  more recently , you can look at rey 's theme , and see how it feels harmonically similar to the force theme ( and then listen in the credits of the film as he masterfully interweaves the melodies of each of these two themes ) , representing rey 's apparent strength in the force . 
  or look at how williams uses a motif similar to one from anakin 's dark deeds in association with kylo ren , or how the main kylo ren theme is related subtly to anakin 's betrayal . 
  it 's this use of motives which on their own do a good job of representing their subject , but also go an amazing job of showing how different things in the world are related , that marks williams as an incredible film composer . 
  you see the same kind of thing done in shore 's lord of the rings score , and a far less subtle version in the scores to game of thrones and avatar , but williams is one of the only composers that can consistently pull it off extremely well in a wide variety of genres of film . 
  tl ; dr the greatness is n't in writing memorable music ( anyone can do that ) , it 's in writing music with exceptional use of themes and motives . 
  han solo and general ( formerly princess ) leia organa were in love , last time we saw them . 
  the force is a thing . 
  passive insight would be the second most common , i 'd think . 
  if an npc is lying but rolls under passive insight for deception , the pcs can tell they 're lying even if they do n't suspect it . 
  we just called that standing long jump . 
  is spirit airlines the air asia of the americas ? 
  not hugely different . 
  it 's not like they 've rewritten enormous chunks of kernel . 
  in fact , between the releases publicly known as windows vista and 8.1 , so little changed under the hood that microsoft did n't think it was worth going from kernel version 6 . x to 7 . x. 
  yeah , i 'm on a 2012 mac and i still have n't upgraded to el capitan ( from yosemite ) . 
  i make a point of waiting to the 10 . x. 2 release before upgrading , but i just have n't gotten around to it yet . 
  my sister has a mac from , i think 2011 , maybe 2012 , and it 's still running mountain lion or mavericks , not sure which . 
   anyone with a nexus device is the first to get an update, 
  unless that nexus happens to be more than a measly two years old . 
  google 's support of old devices is frankly quite miserable . 
  and my nexus 4 is * never * going to get it . 
  you should probably be aware that most of beethoven 's music would be considered early romantic , and all of tchaikovsky 's work is romantic , and so is brahms .
