  how do you feel about wagner , mahler , chopin , liszt , and rachmaninov ? 
  these are all romantic period composers . 
  or how about some of the less extreme 20th century composers . 
  take a listen to some satie , debussy , or orff . 
  these are 20th century composers that are either fairly similar to romantic period composers , or take a fairly minimalist ( and * not * `` minimalist '' in the technical use of the term , but simply `` smaller '' ) approach to their compositions , moving back towards smaller potentially more manageable pieces than the ultra-romanticism or atonality that you get from some other 20th century composers . 
  sure , but the same is true of os x and android ( i ca n't speak for ios , i have n't got any recent experience with it ) . 
  why should windows be separated into versions and not those ? 
  player 's handbook , page 202 , under `` bonus action '', 
   you ca n't cast another spell during the same turn , except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action . 
  sure , nexus is the best we 've got on android , but frankly even compared to apple ( a company infamous for ending support easily ) the best there is on offer on our side of the divide is abysmal . 
  the iphone 5 came out earlier the same year as the nexus 4 , and is still getting updates . 
  oh , we are ? 
  well that 's very good news , i guess . 
  or the more obvious `` find the nearest petrol station on this route '' . 
  no , it 's not a simple pattern . 
  who the fuck can draw those almost medical-like staves . 
  and what is going on at the corners ? 
  ~ ~ it should have meaning that 's obvious to the vast majority of people under it . 
  if it 's no longer meaningful , then it 's time to change it . 
  and you do n't even * know * that it really was meaningful to the majority of brisbanites when it was first made . ~ ~, 
  agreed , it 's good on this front . 
  no letters is nice , but yeah , seals . 
  the rule is actually be distinctive ** or ** be related . 
  well , i 'll agree it 's distinctive , but i 'm also not familiar with any other australian city flags . 
  maybe when compared , it 's not as distinctive anymore . 
  but i 'll give it the benefit of the doubt . 
  that 's bad . ~ ~, 
  edit : actually , apparently those pretzels were a symbol associated with sir thomas brisbane . 
  i 'm now in favour of their inclusion , so i 'll give it points for meaningfulness . 
  but still , why the medicine symbols ? 
  and why does the pretzel have to be there 6 times ? 
  it 's not a terrible flag , in my eyes , but it 's far from a good one either . 
  too busy . 
  someone alert / r/vexilology and / r/cgpgrey . 
  / u/jeffdujon is n't a brisbanite , but he 's aussie at least . 
  wow thanks for this . 
  yeah , the brisbane flag definitely is better than that of sydney , perth , hobart , and melbourne . 
  i still do n't think it 's a very good flag . 
  though i will say , my mind has now been changed on its merit in terms of being related . 
  i think its use of the pretzel knots is actually really clever . 
  but it 's still far too busy . 
  as another commenter noted , it looks like 6 flags , not one . 
  and i fail to understand the purpose of the medicine symbols . 
  as for `` what kind of person is a flag expert ? '', 
  well , they 've a vexillologist . 
  they get criticised for it a lot . 
  i did n't say it was a * valid * criticism , but it 's a * very * common one . 
  it was more valid in the past . 
  i remember my third gen ipod touch only getting some of the features of ios 4 , and not being updated past that , and i know there were complaints about support for older devices being dropped around the release of os x lion . 
  oh , cool , thanks . 
  still , not sure why the caduceus has any special meaning for brisbane as compared to any other major city . 
  ditto australia and south east asia ( among english-speaking expats ) . 
  anakin turned to the dark side because ( a ) he wanted to save padme from dying , and ( b ) he felt shunned by the other jedi . 
  that 's not what i would call clinically insane or black and white at all . 
  this is how i feel about like 90 % of the prequels . 
  the idea and basic structure of them is fantastic . 
  it 's just that the actual writing was abysmal , and the acting was mediocre -- not terrible , really , but not good enough to save the films by a long shot . 
  if you gave me a one page summary of each of the prequel films , i would read them and be like `` yeah , that sounds like it 'll be a fantastic set of movies '' . 
  they were n't good movies at all , but the * idea * behind them was incredible . 
  a story about the fall of someone who was supposed to be a saviour , and who started out so innocent , set in front of a backdrop of thrilling political drama involving a corrupt senate secretly being manipulated by a dark lord . 
  the catch ? 
  `` months before '' is actually just under 2 months before , and 9/11 is , in this instance , referring to the more logical date of the 9th of november . 
  the episode aired on the 12/9 , the day after september 11 . 
  do n't be ashamed of it !, 
  no one should ever be ashamed of their laugh . 
  i love hearing jimmy carr laugh . 
  he always sounds so genuinely happy . 
  space is big . 
  really big . 
  you just wo n't believe how vastly , hugely , mind-bogglingly big it is . 
  i mean , you may think it 's a long way down the road to the chemist , but that 's just peanuts to space . 
  lawn bowls is australia 's deadliest sport ( and probably also america 's and other places ' , i just have n't seen statistics for them ) . 
   plus acting against a blue screen 95 % of the time is really difficult . 
  try australia . 
  texas would only be our 6th largest state by area * ( and even alaska slots in at 3rd ) . 
  but that 's what happens when you get a country that 's pretty much the same size ( as the 48 contiguous us states ) , with less than a fifth the number of states . 
  \\* counting the northern territory as a state , which it really is in all but name and senatorial representation . 
  too true . 
  uluru 's kinda neat , but yeah , not much else . 
  i 'll be honest , i do n't often look at episode artwork . 
  but i do recall a recent ( the most recent ? ), 
  episode of hello internet displaying different artwork to most episodes . 
  so clearly it at least works correctly in some instances . 
  what are your interests ? 
  the vast majority of podcasts i listen to are tech ones , mostly from the this week in tech network . 
  windows weekly , this week in google , macbreak weekly , security now !, 
  ( my personal favourite ) , all about android , and the eponymous twit . 
  if you 're familiar with the cgpgrey youtube channel and/or brady harran 's youtube channels like numberphile , computerphile , or sixty symbols , then hello internet is a fantastic podcast . 
  hell , even if you 're not familiar with them , it 's still a great podcast . 
  just two dudes talking to each other about a wide variety of interesting topics . 
  cortex is another podcast with cgp grey on it , but its appeal is a touch more niche than hi . 
  it 's about productivity , chiefly . 
  but really , there are podcasts out there about just about * any * topic you could be interested in . 
   if you could only get one paid app, 
  hell , it ** is ** my only paid app . 
  i think i got the premium version of reddit is fun using google opinion rewards money , but pocketcasts is the only app i 've actually paid for using real money . 
   no support for local files, 
  this one 's the biggest for me . 
  with some podcasts , it 's best if you can listen to the whole history . 
  but long-running podcasts will have their oldest episodes out of the feed , leaving the only way to get them to download them separately and copy them across to your device .
