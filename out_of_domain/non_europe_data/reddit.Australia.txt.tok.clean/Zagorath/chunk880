  i had to spend a lot of time finding a non-podcast-specific audio player that supported variable playback speeds in order to get through over 400 episodes of security now !, 
  and it was a pain . 
  the app i ended up going with was capped at only 2.0 x speed , too , which is slower than i would have liked , and than pocket casts supports . 
  do n't you get it ? 
  there are sexists and insane people on podcasts ; the medium is tainted . 
  people should n't listen to them . 
  / s , in case it was n't clear, 
  not that it makes much difference at higher levels , when your sneak attack damage massively outclasses your weapon 's native damage anyway . 
  i find that amusing , because i associate the name abigail with young girls , at most in their teens . 
  it makes me think of the crucible . 
  i am definitely in favour of mediafire 's exclusion . 
  congratulations to all the winners and runners up !, 
  and wow , 5,000 subscribers . 
  yay !, 
  very relevant username . 
  thanks so much !, 
   btw . 
  is `` might have never heard of '' or might never have heard of '' correct ? 
  i would probably go with the former , but both would be correct . 
  mate , that 's 6 , 8 , 5 . 
  that 's 5 , 7 , 7 mate . 
  anakin * was * born at a time of great need . 
  the jedi order was so utterly corrupt and extremist that they , and consequently the galaxy they were supposed to protect , were in dire need of reform . 
  it was n't the overt great need that one might expect , but it was a great need nonetheless . 
  and he ended up bringing balance to the force by being the one to kill darth sidious . 
  what he * intended * really does n't matter . 
  from my point of view , you are a thing of nature . 
  ^ ^ am ^ ^ i ^ ^ doing ^ ^ this ^ ^ right ? 
  because it 's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere . 
  by this post ? 
  i 'm not familiar with facebook 's advertising interface , but it certainly would be * well * within their capabilities to allow advertisers to exclude specific pages from having their ads shown on . 
  maybe they choose not to allow that for some reason , but it would not be difficult to implement . 
  i know google adsense has similar functionality . 
   unless you want a more obstacle course style run, 
  tbh that sounds amazing to me . 
  i use dispostable.com , because i like its punny name . 
  well , i know people have been clamouring for more bardic schools , so it 's nice to have a few more of them . 
  and i 've seen a lot of people asking for homebrew scouts , so clearly that 's a nice thing to have as a fighter archetype . 
  i ca n't comment on the actual balance or design of the specific archetypes , i have n't the time right now to read through them . 
  until the time comes . 
  unfortunately for tommy , the time will never come , unlike for the king of the dead . 
  personally i would say he goes around tapping the edge of the hole , causing bits of it to collapse , showing where it is weak and needs to be built better . 
   i think this reinforces / u/njpete 's point . 
  that 's right , it does . 
  hence the comment above . 
  that 's pretty much what i was hoping for . 
  would be vastly more entertaining than the australia-windies series has been thus far ... 
  blades make the perfect interrogators . 
  i can see this being * very * popular with some people in my group . 
   ** unnerving flourish . 
  ** ... if the, 
  creature fails this saving throw , it answers, 
  truthfully any questions you ask it, 
  i feel like ** tumbling fool ** really should only offer disengage , not either disengage or dash . 
  i just fail to see how , based on its flavour text , dash makes sense . 
  ** fool 's luck ** sounds like an * amazing * feature , but it requires a dm to run well . 
  like with the wild sorcerer , it 's awesome , but a bad dm can ruin it way more than most features . 
  or even a mostly good dm who just forgets about that one feature . 
  i feel like the lance superiority die ability should also add the die roll to the dc . 
  but it should also only be eligible for the knocking prone effect * if * the attack hits . 
  it 's not . 
  they 're just pointing out that their inspiration for this was some `` kits '' from previous editions . 
  these are straight up just subclasses today , and they make no attempt to hide that fact . 
  oh god , i missed that ... 
  that 's even worse ... 
  the advantage of mailinator , dispostable , and similar , is that you can actually temporarily access emails sent there , to clock on approval links etc. 
  forgotten realms, 
  so , i just recently finished my annual rewatch of avatar , and it got me wanting to build classes to match . 
  the most obvious choice would be to go with the elemental monk subclass , and maybe alter the spells that they get a bit to match the four elemental disciplines , and i tried playing around with that for a while , but i could n't manage to work it in a way that felt right to me . 
  so , uhh ... throwing it out there . 
  anyone got good ideas for how to make firebenders , airbenders , waterbenders , and earthbenders work as d&d classes/archetypes ? 
  i can see why one would say that , but to me the scout just * screams * `` ranger-like fighter '' . 
  i think of a scout as being part of an army , someone who goes ahead to report on enemy movements , but fundamentally still a soldier who can hold his own in a fight . 
  it 's the perfect build for a lighter-weight , maybe dex-based , fighter . 
   ranger and rogue both seem like better homes for the scout than fighter in this edition, 
  i can see why one would say that , but to me the scout just * screams * `` ranger-like fighter '' .

  yeah , it 's a really shitty argument . 
  the point of * any * fiction , or at least any good fiction , is that there should be a few ways in which it deviates from the real world , and the reader should be able to fairly quickly intuit most of these . 
  it should not deviate in random or unexpected ways without reason . 
  one way that d&d clearly is not intending to vary from the real world is that for the most part , macroscopic physics works exactly the same as in the real world , except where specifically altered by magic . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zuynhkal1i ) , while seeming to be about something completely unrelated , actually does a really good job of touching upon the concept of suspension of disbelief in fiction . 
  that 's , uhh , not the opposite at all . 
  the comment you replied to said :, 
  and you said :, 
   i ... kept messenger, 
  but for what it 's worth , i 'm the same . 
  got rid of the main facebook app a long time ago . 
  hated the fact that it required permission to read my texts , and barely use facebook for anything other than messaging anyway , so really that was the last straw . 
  i use messenger too much to get rid of it , though , even if it requires all the same permissions ... 
   no chat heads, 
  thanks . 
  i 'll stick with the official facebook messenger , then . 
  but you know , if for some reason you * want * to get rid of chat heads , you can do that from the facebook messenger settings . 
  i 'm not familiar with * any * of its previous incarnations , i 'm just purely going off the idea of a `` scout '' in general . 
  because who searches for things on reddit frequently ? 
  hear , hear !, 
  what i wanted in assassins creed was a concise set of games , four or five games , with a focused story the ultimately led to a modern day game where desmond miles topples the templars . 
  but no .
