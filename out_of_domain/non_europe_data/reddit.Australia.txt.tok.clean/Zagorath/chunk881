  now we have a platform for games rather then a cohesive set of narratives . 
  they just pump out games year after year with no real interest in that amazing story that they set up in the first few games . 
  i have n't played one since revelations . 
  i was super excited for ac3 and was going to play it , but after what i 've heard about it ... nah , never mind . 
  i know it only comes ( or came ) out in china at some point in january . 
  maybe that 's it ? 
  i dunno , seems unlikely . 
  personally when i read `` older '' in the comment you replied to , i was imagining 60 + . 
  but regardless of what age group vernand meant , there are * always * exceptions to * any * generalisation . 
  ( including this one , maybe . ), 
  agreed entirely on points 0 , 1 , and 3 . 
  though personally for 3 , i 've set up ifttt to archive all of my own comments on google drive . 
  i 've found it rather convenient . 
  but i do use that occasionally . 
  it 's just that it 's not a super common thing for most people . 
  ( fwiw , www.reddit.com is actually my third highest in the past year as well , and third of all time . ), 
  regarding 2 , i 'll admit i 've done it a few times in the past for tv shows i 've watched and books that i 've read . 
  but usually it 's only because i want to see what other people think about it , not because i actually necessarily want to engage in discussion . 
  usually the threads that come up are too old . 
  and if it 's something that only recently came out , i 'd go to the show 's subreddit , / r/movies , or similar . 
  regarding the addendum , something like that would be nice . 
  but i 'm not so sure about the shorthand . 
  wp can be wordpress just as easily as wikipedia . 
  but the shorter ` site : reddit ` or ` site : wikipedia ` would be handy . 
  they could even have it match a domain of ` * wikipedia * ` if they 're afraid of ambiguity in certain other cases ; the vast majority of the time it would work just fine ( i doubt ` wikipedia.mymalicioussite.com ` is going to rank highly anyway ) . 
  i do n't understand . 
  what 's wrong with the river near wanderwood ? 
  two little rivers conjoin on their way into that lake . 
  the weirdest thing to me is the giant bridge over the lake that is n't that wide anyway . 
  tamriel is a fake world ? 
   but it uses a 100 % retarded date format, 
  oh come now , it 's not * that * bad , surely ? 
  i 'll admit i do n't know the format they use , but they do n't ask you to enter the date range in unix epoch time , written in octal , do they ? 
  because * that * would be full retard . 
  but yeah , site : reddit.com/r/x is amazingly useful . 
  i do n't suppose you know if site : reddit.com/r/x+y works , do you ? 
  i 've never actually tried it , i tend to just do two searches , but it could be useful for when i 'm not sure which of multiple subreddits a post was in . 
  hmm ? 
  is there a meta reason that they 've decided that this is the case ? 
  does the world as a fictional world that players are playing actually benefit from this construction somehow ? 
  or is it something they 've added in just to fuck with us ? 
  is there something wrong with the default sans-serif font ? 
  probably not the best , but warlocks are pretty good . 
  at level 6 , you should be doing an average of 19 per turn if you * do n't * use hex . 
  ( that 's 5.5 +4 from eldritch blast with 18 cha and agonising blast , with two beams . ), 
  if you * do * have hex , you can add an average of 7 per turn to that . 
  ( maths assuming all attacks hit . ), 
   that is the green text, 
  mmm , not quit * e * . 
  i mean , it 's definitely up there : top five ** easily ** , but ** the ** greentext is without a doubt sir bearington . 
  edit : near-homographs suck, 
  i 've never shared a recipe before , so i do n't know how well it will work , but [ here ] ( https://ifttt.com/recipes/368384-log-reddit-comments-on-google-drive ) . 
   that 's the number of days since julian day 0, 
  i ... you ... th ... what the fuck ? 
  just ... *** why *** ? 
   i 'm pretty sure that site is just a filter by url prefix, 
  yeah , figured as much . 
  ah well . 
   a lot of story choices from various media can be deconstructed just like you just did, 
  true , i guess . 
  it 's just that this one , i dunno , it feels like a far more meta choice than a lot of things do . 
  i ca n't really even think of why it would be something that they would specifically put into the story . 
  still , thanks , for the excellent explanations . 
  no , it 's not a pain to use at all . 
  all the important keyboard shortcuts are just as easy to use as with qwerty . 
  if you 're a programmer , i would highly recommend looking in to a variant of dvorak optimised for programming in your language of choice . 
  to be frank , qwerty is a bad language for programming , and dvorak is even worse . 
  but a good programming-specific layout is fantastic . 
  there 's the well-known [ `` programmer dvorak '' ] ( http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/ ) , but i 'm not a fan of it . 
  i hate the way it rearranges numbers , and i 'm not a huge fan of where it puts symbols , either . 
  i created my own layout , which i call [ `` coder 's dvorak '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fgphjcl.png ) for programming , aimed to make c-like languages easiest , with a secondary interest in languages that use a dollar sign for variables . 
  note that all the letters are in the same place as dvorak , as are the most common punctuation marks ( apart from quotes and semicolons switching , like in programmer dvorak ) , while making programming-important symbols , like braces , square brackets , brackets , common arithmetic symbols easy to reach . 
  the paired symbols ( the different types of brackets ) are paired such that the same finger should make the same motion to open and close , but with the opposite hand . 
  for non-programming work , it 's important to note that a big advantage of dvorak is not just speed ( though you will likely , with training , get back to the same speed you currently maintain , if not improve ) , but also ergonomics . 
  due to far less finger travel needed in average english typing on dvorak as compared to qwerty , the risk of rsis is decreased . 
  p.s. , i wrote all of the above out , and then for some reason my entire computer crashed . 
  just suddenly froze , and a moment later restarted entirely . 
  no idea why . 
  maybe i have too many tabs open . 
  maybe it was something weird with the sshfs i had mounted , or it could have been ukelele ( the keyboard layout manager ) . 
  but holy shit , either google chrome or os x , or maybe it 's the interplay between the two , but something going on here is fucking amazing . 
  the entire * computer * restarted , and that text was saved when chrome reopened . 
  you 're not wrong , but why would you correct `` your '' to `` you 're '' , and not bother with all the occurrences of `` u '' , `` id '' , and `` rdy '' ? 
  no , they 're not wrong . 
  it should have been, 
   or you 're screwed, 
  and, 
   but once you 're 40, 
  seems odd to nitpick that but not all the far more obvious mistakes , though . 
  on what type of surface is it sitting ? 
  hear , hear . 
  with the same order of priority . 
  sorcerers have a third archetype in scag , and two more have been released in uas . 
  the storm sorcerer was in the waterborne ua , but later fully released in scag . 
  and we 've had a sort of divine sorcerer in the modifying/building classes guide ua , and a darkness sorcerer in the underdark ua . 
  you mean a fully released version of what we got in the underdark unearthed arcana ? 
  hjkl ? 
  i never use those keys at all . 
  are those the stupid alternative that vim provides for some reason to arrow keys ? 
  i know it has that but i 'm not sure where they are .
