  his backstory is * his * backstory , and i would be * very * hesitant to specify anything about his past without his approval . 
  now , if it 's far enough in the past , i can certainly see room for an exception , but honestly i would still highly recommend proposing it to the player ahead of time and explaining the situation , * especially * if it will or could affect the player in a direct way , and even more so if that is a mechanical way . 
  keep it a secret between you and the player , or do n't do it at all , would be my advice . 
  springing secrets about a player 's character on * that player * is a huge overstep . 
  it should n't be hard for a player to separate their knowledge of this from their character 's lack of knowledge . 
  relevant username , eh ? 
  this is awesome !, 
  only thing i might add is that you 've done an amazing job of describing the colour , but what about the other senses ? 
  how does it * sound * , or even * smell * ? 
  the main character of the brimstone angels series , [ farideh ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/mm_faridehv2.pdf ) 's eldritch blast is described as smelling strongly of brimstone . 
   the power seemed to burst into being in the air before her mouth and , channeled by her outstretched hands , streamed across the clearing and exploded against a fir tree with a sickly violet light . 
   farideh stared , agape , at the force of it . 
  the wood had splintered and charred where the blast had struck it , and embers of purple light still scintillated at its edges . 
  a single word and she 'd blown off a piece of the tree nearly as large as her head . 
  and later, 
   he blinked , and suddenly , he was coughing at the sharp taste of brimstone and looking up at the fir tree that had been a solid twenty feet to his right when she 'd first grabbed his arm . 
  i can imagine a feylock 's eldritch blast smelling more like the smoke from burning wood , or perhaps a strange sweetly smell or something . 
  hey sorry , but this subreddit is for stories about things that happened in role playing games , not image macros . 
  you son did n't lose a baby tooth until he turned 720 ? 
  that 's incredible !, 
  i ca n't point you anywhere useful for an ee about reaganomics , but i will give you this advice , which is the recommendation of econ teachers at my school . 
  try to stay away from macroeconomics . 
  it 's an area that tends to be very difficult to get good results in . 
  someone in my year did it . 
  really smart kid , great at economics , went on to study it at university -- he actually graduated just a couple of months ago . 
  but he got only a c in his ee , despite putting an enormous amount of work in . 
  it 's because of the process he went through in writing his ee , and then the result it achieved , that the teachers at the school i went to warn against doing a macro ee . 
  i do n't know exactly what the reason is , but i * believe * it 's something to do with the fact that the ee is really meant to be a * research * paper . 
  you 're meant to go out and create some new independent ideas . 
  it 's relatively easy to do a case study of a real business and use that for a microeconomics ee , or to study a couple of novels for a literature one . 
  macroeconomics is way harder to do that for . 
  i 've said since i first saw it . 
  james cameron 's avatar is n't a film , it 's a technological demonstration . 
  and it 's a damn good one , at that . 
  all that said , i would recommend talking to an economics teacher at your school . 
  they might have had more experience with macroeconomic ees , and might be able to do a better job of guiding you in the right direction to get a good result with one . 
  especially if it 's an area of personal interest , you should n't just dismiss it entirely solely because it 'll be hard !, 
  i 'm not a prequel defender , but i once was . 
  eventually , i realised that the reason , in my case , was because i was basically imaging the movies for what they * could * have been . 
  i viewed them only for the overall plot ( which i maintain was * excellent * ly conceived ) , and not for what we actually got on screen . 
  [ a lot more detail on exactly what i mean in this comment ( and more in a few of the replies and replies to replies ) from a couple of days ago ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3zkinj/in_star_wars_episode_iii_i_just_noticed_that/cyn22dp ) . 
  i 'm just wondering if perhaps something similar could be the case for you ? 
   what happened on jakku ? 
  nothing happened ? 
  the only interesting thing that would have happened was relating to rey and finn , and once they left , anyone who was after them would have left , or gone back to their day-to-day lives . 
   where was han and leia all these years ? 
  this was fairly well explained in the movie . 
  they had a kid , and when he eventually went bad , they were so distraught that they had to separate and deal with it in their own way . 
  `` i went back to the only thing i was ever good at . '', 
  `` so did i. '', 
  ( owtte ) each of them blaming themselves , at least partly , for ben 's fall . 
   what happened to the rebellion and empire ? 
  now here , you have a * very * good point . 
  no good explanation was given for why the new republic failed , how the first order came to be . 
  hell , it was n't really even clear how much the first order controlled , or how much power they had . 
  what precisely was the relation between the new republic , the rebelli -- i mean resistance , and the new order ? 
  it really depends . 
  immortal * can * mean that , but it 's not * wrong * for immortal to also encompass invulnerability , or something more akin to the nazg\u00fbl , or devils in the forgotten realms , where if `` killed '' they will reform . 
  [ have you seen this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erbpdrd9wxk ), 
  2 * is * fairly large , relatively speaking . 
  to call it `` quite short '' is * quite * the oversight . 
  even * symmetric * key cryptography these days should be using a key that 's at least double that size , and four times that size is far from rare . 
  and asymmetric cryptography requires far larger keys than symmetric to be secure . 
  anything under 512 is laughable , and 1024 or higher is what you really should be using . 
   the planet is covered in the wreckage of military vehicles - something obviously happened . 
  everyone acts like its completely normal to have a super star destroying lying around, 
  ah , right . 
  yeah . 
  i thought you were talking about what happened to jakku * after * our protagonists left the planet during episode vii . 
  it 's apparent now that you meant how it came to be the way it was at the * start * of the film . 
  anyway , i get your point , but i honestly did n't feel the need for an explanation . 
  it 's obvious that the empire did n't just give up and surrender after the battle of endor . 
  i had just assumed that there were battles throughout the galaxy resulting in ruins not being a super rare thing . 
  it 'd be nice if there 's some canon material that provides a definitive answer to the question , but i really do n't think the film needed to . 
   no it was n't - you described what we know in one line . 
  that 's hardly well explained . 
  did they keep fighting the empire ? 
  what roles did they both have in the military and civilian changes that happened in the 30 years between ? 
  i thought that was enough ( except as it relates to point three ) . 
  we know that leia at least was involved in trying to form the new republic in some way , but became upset when they refused to fight the first order , and went to form the new rebistance , which * was * directly fighting them . 
  i thought that , apart from the specific relationship between the new republic , the first order , and the resistance , * most * of the rest of the backstory was explained well enough . 
  i * really * want more stuff about luke and his attempt at a new jedi order in the next film , but it made perfect sense that they left that information out of this one . 
   i 'm sure most of this will be covered in the next movie, 
  honestly , i doubt it will be . 
  i * hope * it is , but i think they 're going to leave most of the political stuff out of the movies , unfortunately . 
  but anyway , if you want good answers , someone else linked me to [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/zprxy ) , which explains it all * really * nicely . 
  i have no idea how accurate it is , or what its sources are , but i 'm really glad to have seen it . 
   we do n't know that from the movie - that information was in the additional material someone posted, 
  no , it 's definitely in the movie . 
  i avoided all additional material before seeing the movie , and i did n't see any other extra material until very recently , but i already knew that much . 
  it was n't all explicitly spelled out , but it could quite easily be inferred from what they did explicitly tell us . 
   the default recording is a video camera pointed roughly at the lecturing area, 
  wait what ? 
  all i 've ever had is the output from their computer and/or the capture video from the lecturn 's recording station ( like an overhead projector that uses a video camera instead of light and mirrors ) . 
  i mean , sure , an average software engineer should n't be expected to be able to implement rijndael using assembler , but i * do * think it should be considered necessary knowledge to have a basic understanding of the different types of encryption and how to use them , treating the actual algorithm as a black box . 
  but at the same time , at least at the time i first loaded up this thread ( i do n't really want to go back and look if it 's still that way ) , most of the highly upvoted comments i was seeing * did * seem to have that basic understanding of encryption , or at least , they were n't showing me anything that made me specifically think they * did n't * understand it . 
  looks like the korean peninsula got turned into italy . 
  and i * really * like the shape of the island that 's more or less where real-world japan is . 
  i do n't know why , but heavily crescent-shaped islands , ones with narrow entries like `` the hook '' in there , have always really appealed to me .
