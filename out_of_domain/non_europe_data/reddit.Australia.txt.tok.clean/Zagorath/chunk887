  plz do n't ban him , mods, 
  i like the metaphor , except that with a rollercoaster you want extreme dips and falls . 
  with keynesian economics , the point is that the government tries to smooth things out . 
  it does n't actually have any bearing on your argument , i just thought it was an amusing observation . 
  yeah i agree , i really want crossovers to be a regular thing , and i want the two shows to be able to exist in the same universe . 
  it 's why i 'm disappointed that they went with the method they did . 
  i * think * that comics have previously done things where universes somehow combine and merge . 
  maybe they could do that ? 
  i 'm not really sure how time travel would achieve the same effect though . 
  mr. t was rna, 
  so they 're meant to be joffrey ? 
  or maybe renly ? 
  i heard once that the game was in development to be its own thing , but then late in the process they got the rights to use the lord of the rings ip . 
  i imagine that to play it , one would have to basically just pretend it * is n't * a lord of the rings game , because it so thoroughly does not fit in that universe . 
  it 's an excellent game in its own right , but it does n't belong in the lotr universe . 
  oh yeah , i know . 
  i was just joking/trolling there , too . 
   i do n't normally comment on spoilers , but an upcoming episode features a felicity hallucination . 
  make of that what you will . 
  see , i really like this . 
  i lost a ** lot ** of respect for j. j. abrams when he repeatedly and directly stated that khan was not in his second star trek movie , only to , surprise surprise , have khan as the main villain in his second star trek movie . 
  i get it , you want to keep secrets and leave stuff as a surprise for when the thing actually comes out . 
  but do n't do that by fucking lying * directly * to your fans . 
  use misdirection and all the other subtle tricks you like , but do n't outright state something that is utterly false . 
  does laughing out loud at this make me a bad person ? 
  the best offense feature feels really weird to me . 
  a shield bash that does * more * damage than most weapons ? 
  ( equal on average to a 1d12 weapon , and equal at maximum to 1d10 . ), 
  that just does n't feel right . 
  my feeling is that it should probably be 1d6 + mod , and have some effect , rather than 1d8 + mod + ac . 
  and the whole thing about bonus action or regular action also does n't make sense . 
  it has to be followed [ by ] or follow a normal weapon attack , or you can use both an action and bonus action , in which case it also knocks your target prone ? 
  none of that feels natural within the 5e system . 
  i would suggest this aspect ( the core of the archetype ) be * vastly * simplified . 
  the level 7 ability for fighters should ideally be a mostly non-combat flavour one ( 3 of the 4 official fighter archetypes are ) , but i actually quite like this one . 
  it makes sense for a fighter that focuses on use of the shield to be able to do something like that . 
  still , i 'm not sure it 's entirely balanced . 
  the last part of it should be reworded `` you have advantage against being knocked prone '' , or something like that . 
  what 's a `` versatile die '' ? 
  but static bonuses to attack rolls ( i.e. , to-hit rolls ) should * always * be avoided . 
  it breaks 5e 's bounded accuracy in a very bad way . 
  vengeful ( note the spelling ) seems like a pretty decent feature , but i do wonder about balance . 
  maybe it should be advantage on a * single * attack on your next turn ? 
  revel in blood also seems powerful . 
  i 'd say if it did half damage extra , and had the half health back w / hit die option , rather than being * full * damage extra , that might be a bit more reasonable . 
  note that i 'm not entirely confident about most of what i 've said regarding balance ( except for the messing with bounded accuracy thing ) . 
  the non-balance things though , like the flavour of best offense and the level 7 ability , i would highly suggest reworking . 
  fair enough . 
  i actually have n't played the game itself , all of that was based on what i 've heard others say . 
  was this reported a number of times or something ? 
  just wondering why you needed to leave this comment . 
  oh , there 's absolutely nothing wrong with the prone knock thing . 
  it 's a cool idea . 
  my biggest problem was with doing that * plus * being an attack that 's better than most weapons . 
  1d6 is not a `` love tap '' , it 's still a serious hit . 
  it 's the equivalent of being hit full on with a mace . 
  even that seems generous to me . 
  regarding the versatile thing , it could use some serious rewording , even if you keep the feature as is . 
  no other place refers to these as `` versatile dice '' . 
  i would simply say `` while wielding a versatile weapon with two hands '' or something like that . 
  come on brissy times , time to make up for all the other crap you take from / r/brisbane and do something useful !, 
  it 's definitely an improvement . 
  in america , they 're pretty much * all * universities look at . 
  you 're likely to get an unconditional offer based on your predicted scores alone . 
  in the uk , your predicted score will be necessary to get you a good offer , but it will be conditional on you actually attaining that grade , or one close enough to it . 
  in australia , they do n't matter at all . 
  only your final grade does . 
  your school should give you a predicted score at some point around the next three or four weeks at the latest , if they have n't already . 
  you send that with your application if you 're going to somewhere that needs it . 
  i do n't really know how it works , i 'm going to uni in australia , so i never needed it . 
   against your warlock spell save dc, 
  this part is unnecessary . 
  saves are * always * against your class spell save dc , unless otherwise specified . 
  if you take a look at existing spells etc. , they generally do not specify this . 
  i like channel divinity . 
  but it got me thinking about your spell list . 
  why not also do that ? 
  have the spell list correspond to the domain you 've chosen . 
  clerics all get exactly two spells per spell level , just as warlocks do ( though obviously clerics * get * the spell , warlocks get to * choose * it ) , so it 's a perfect match . 
  just a thought . 
  however , as three_flower says , i think channel divinity should probably be a long rest feature , to signify the fact that warlocks are not clerics , and do not hold * quite * the same level of attention from their deity . 
  side point , if you * do * keep it on a short rest , the wording in 5e tends to be `` when you finish a short or long rest '' , and not `` once between rests '' . 
  maledictor 's doom is a fair bit weaker than the fiend 's level 10 ability , but feels stronger than the other equivalent features . 
  considering how strong channel divinity is , i might suggest toning this down slightly . 
  maybe remove `` apply disadvantage to an enemy 's saving throw '' part . 
  stunning word does n't really fit the level . 
  the phb level 14 features are all directly targeted at a single opponent , so this is probably the best way to go with a warlock 's 14th level feature . 
  alternatively , both of the non-phb patrons we have so far ( undying light and undying ) involve healing , which is n't a terrible fit for a divine-oriented character . 
  hear , hear !, 
   the archfey features all specify that, 
  ah fair enough , certainly nothing particularly bad about it as-is . 
   i wanted something a bit more unifying, 
  yeah sure , that definitely makes sense . 
   i do n't think i 'd change it to once per long rest , though , since that would make it really weird with multiclassing, 
  hmm ... that 's a very good point , actually . 
  i 'm not really sure how to approach that .
