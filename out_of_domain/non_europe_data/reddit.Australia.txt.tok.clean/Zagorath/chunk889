  god , even censored that word disgusts me . 
  no , he 's already checked in . 
  he was * on * the plane when he wrote this . 
  and protections from extragalactic terrors . 
  * nobody * except members of the party should be able to read the private subreddit for the party . 
  it 's just goddamn common sense . 
  i do n't care if it 's the blood queen you want in there . 
  mmm , not really . 
  f.lux was already not * really * available on ios . 
  yes it was doable through workarounds , but the vast majority of people did n't have it available to them . 
  on os x , as well as windows , f.lux is still the only/best way to do things . 
  saying apple sherlocked f.lux is like saying the creators of [ redshift ] ( http://jonls.dk/redshift/ ) ( a f.lux-like tool for linux ) sherlocked it . 
  they ca n't have , because there is n't a version ( that works properly ) on the platform . 
  no , this is insane . 
  the party subreddit needs to be a private place where members of that party -- and ** only ** members of that party -- are able to debate and come to agreement on their own policy without that process being visible to people who are not members of the party . 
  besides , there 's nothing to be * gained * from having an external moderator . 
  parties sit outside the main political process . 
  they can regulate their own internal affairs easily ; there 's no need for someone else to come in and do it . 
  the fact that this is even being debated is mind boggling . 
   what 's to stop a mod creating an alt and joining a party ? 
  nothing is . 
  but there 's also precious little stopping any individual making a bunch of accounts and recking elections . 
  like anything , we rely on an honour system . 
   the fairly limited range of moderator privileges should attest to that, 
  except that they have the most important privilege : the ability to read private party discussions . 
   as an official member of this subreddit , is complying with its rules and policies, 
  which rules , exactly , are these ? 
  perhaps if i could hear exactly which rules by which parties supposedly need to abide , i would be more amenable to this suggestion . 
   democracy just makes you want to pull your hair out , sometimes , does n't it . 
  is n't it fun !, 
  no , because the issue at hand is n't one of democratic discussion . 
  it 's about preventing the massive overreach of dictatorial power . 
  but parties sit outside of the actual process of parliament 's functions , which is what 3fun , yourself , etc. 
  are in charge of . 
  there is no reason for you to concern yourselves with internal party matters , which should be managed by the parties themselves . 
  1 day `` nbn revelations ? '', 
  well , i think you just have a fundamentally different idea of what the role of moderators should be in this model than i do . 
  no spoilers , man !, 
   if it was a target tip ( often bullet shaped , same diameter as the arrow ) and not a broad head ( hunting tip , triangular shape , razor sharp ), 
  the picture 's caption says that the arrow he was shot with is similar to the one shown , and if that 's accurate , the tip was quite a bit wider than the arrow shaft . 
  why can the subreddit 's own moderators not take care of dealing with personal attacks etc. ? 
  there 's no good reason that it should be the same people who deal with those issues in the parliament and public subreddits . 
  edit : not to mention , have we ever really had problems with this so far ? 
  it seems like you 're using a boogeyman to justify unnecessary extra powers . 
  as for party participation , i have to say , i like the rule that parties need to have a number of active members in order to be allowed to remain as a party . 
  it 's a good rule that could prevent overly inactive parties from causing too much splintering . 
  and unfortunately , i do n't really see a good way of going about that . 
  but surely participation of party members in the public arena is a good enough proxy for that ? 
  edit : also , this does not require mail privileges even if access * is * required . 
  see also : betteridge 's law of headlines . 
  kinda . 
  the question then is , what happens if they lose the vote of confidence ? 
  unlikely , to be sure , but if it happens , does the head mod just appoint someone different , or does it open to other nominations ? 
  presumably whoever ends up with the role has to pass a vote of confidence anyway . 
  it seems beside the point to require a vote first to be * nominated * . 
   room points are genius, 
  i ca n't possibly be the only one that does n't agree with this , can i ? 
  perhaps i 'm just missing it , but i ca n't see anywhere that room points are explained . 
  if it 's going to introduce a new scale , that scale needs to be explained . 
  because as it is , i have no idea what a room point is meant to represent . 
  they seem like this pointless number attached to everything . 
  and if it has an explanation already , then that explanation needs to be made more prominent , because i ca n't for the life of me find it when i 'm looking for it . 
   using this method, 
  it 's called `` approval voting '' , for what it 's worth . 
  personally , i think `` and the blessing of the moderators '' should be amended to `` and does n't get vetoed by the outgoing head moderator '' , since it was initially a unilateral appointment by the head mod , not all the mods . 
  and what if nobody reaches 66 % ? 
  oh no , i agree that the * idea * is a good one . 
  my problem is that it 's never really explained properly , at least that i can see . 
  with an explanation it would be great . 
  without , it feels like a meaningless number . 
  something like a rough explanation of exactly what each value represents in-game , for example . 
  okay , i think i get it now . 
  each basic structure ( abbey , temple , etc. ), 
  has a certain number of `` room points '' . 
  each room ( animal pen , armoury , etc. ), 
  costs a certain number of room points . 
  the basic structure can have rooms up until its room point total is filled by the rooms contained in it . 
  is that correct ? 
  because if so , that 's what needed to be explained . 
  i had no idea that that was the case from the pdf itself , it was only thanks to your explanation that i 've got it . 
  this may be explained somewhere in the pdf , but i did n't see it previously when i went looking for it , so it needs to be made more clear . 
  actually , you can . 
  that 's what the above article is about . 
  the content itself may or may not be copyrighted/copyrightable , but the database , as a `` compilation '' , * can * be copyrighted . 
  it 's really not that bad . 
  all it needs is to change the end to `` in a game of morrowind '' or even `` in a morrowind game '' , or perhaps `` in morrowind '' , and it 'd be fine . 
  this shield user archetype is a ** lot ** better than the other one someone submitted a few days ago . 
  shield ride looks like an awesome flavourful feature . 
  maybe it should explicitly mention that , if you stop while still in water , you 'll begin to sink/have to swim . 
  it might not be necessary -- it is fairly obvious imo -- but it could n't hurt . 
  all the other features seem pretty good to me . 
  level appropriate both in terms of power and theme . 
  bastion has a typo . 
  it should say `` you * may * interlock '' not `` you my interlock '' . 
  the warlock patron feels really nice , thematically . 
  * really * nice . 
  the first level feature is really nice . 
  i * think * its balance is probably okay , but i 'd want to see it in practice because it could potentially be a bit too powerful . 
  blood bond feels very powerful to me for a level six feature . 
  maybe the creature should get the opportunity to break the bond after each of its turns , as well ?
