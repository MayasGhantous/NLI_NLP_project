  as for how they move , the stand up on their tails and waddle . 
  i agree with you though , strength seems more fitting than dex . 
  some guy named walter , apparently . 
   turned out to be maybe the most iconic movie music sound ever, 
  it 's certainly very iconic , but i do n't think it has anything on vader 's theme from star wars , hedwig 's theme from harry potter , or the hobbit theme from lord of the rings . 
  it 's a top 10 for sure , and probably top 5 , but i do n't think it 's a serious contender for the top spot . 
  the imperial march is the name of one specific track on the episode v soundtrack . 
  the theme itself , [ seen here ] ( http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/04-main-melody-contour.jpg ) , is darth vader 's theme . 
  there 's no need for the scare quotes . 
  borrowed is exactly the right word . 
  and there 's absolutely fucking nothing wrong with that . 
  wolfgang amadeus mozart `` borrowed '' from a well-known folk song by the name of `` ah , vous dirai-je maman '' ( that 's twinkle twinkle , to the modern anglophile ) , and made an entire piece using nothing but that theme . 
  ludwig van beethoven used a carbon copy of the opening theme of the final movement of mozart 's symphony no . 
  40 as the opening to the second movement of his symphony no . 
  5 , and his sonata no . 
  14 in c # minor ( `` moonlight '' ) borrowed heavily from the commendatore 's death scene in mozart 's don giovanni . 
  copying themes even wholesale is and should be perfectly acceptable . 
  borrowing themes and changing them a bit even more so . 
  what matters is how they use these themes , and john williams does an * amazing * job of that . 
  grrm is famous for killing off much-beloved characters . 
  2016 has , in its first 15 days , seen the deaths of two very well loved celebrities . 
   i 'm not good at detecting satire xor this is terrible satire, 
  why xor ? 
  there 's no reason that it could n't be both . 
  it was pretty obviously satire , so the fact that you missed it indicates that you are indeed not good at detecting satire . 
  but it 's * also * pretty terrible satire . 
  the headline is mildly amusing , but it 's not particularly worth reading beyond that . 
  you just got ta redirect your feels to your username . 
  i would also like to know this . 
  so far the only thing i know about the guy is that he has a pretentious-sounding name , and apparently he has a low opinion of brisbane . 
  i think that particular one-liner is an especially good one , because not only is it a mildly funny moment ( and let 's be honest , it 's not * especially * funny anyway ) , but it also says * a lot * about obi-wan as a character , and the jedi as a whole . 
  haha yeah . 
  i actually was n't counting that bit specifically because it is so obviously in counterpoint . 
  i mean , do n't get me wrong , it 's an absolutely incredible piece of scoring , it 's just that the point i wanted to make was that even the normal version of rey 's theme has subtle similarities to the force theme . 
  but that track is one of my favourite bits from the soundtrack . 
  davy jones ' theme , actually , is one i can do . 
  i think , anyway , it 's been a long time since i saw the movie and i might be remembering a different one . 
  it 's one played by music box and later organ , right ? 
  i actually think the score for the first two pirates films is * almost * of the same quality as some of williams ' mid tier stuff . 
  one day open ballots, 
  registration three days ahead . 
  new electoral roll , but priority given to previous members to get the electorate they want . 
  i trust 3fun to be impartial and not interfere in the actual politics simulation . 
  but that 's beside the point . 
  i believe that the * system * should be one that does n't * rely * on such trust where it is n't necessary , and i do n't believe that it is necessary for much of what you are trying to do . 
  but they do n't have a triangular profile . 
  better than a d10 . 
  at least d4s are platonic solids . 
  hear , hear !, 
  on all counts . 
   if they did , they had a legitimate claim to test confidence on the floor as the new government , be sworn in as the new ministry , and attempt to pass something in january, 
  i know that they certainly * could * have done this under the rules of the parliamentary system , but it would have been a massive breach of convention , would it not ? 
   maybe you should join us as a journalist when we 're up and running , your analysis pieces were good reads . 
  hear , hear !, 
  / u/jnd-au for antony green 's job !, 
  i see both of your `` hear , hears !, 
  '' , and say `` hear , hear ! '', 
  hear , hear !, 
  i think that the mods are over reaching in this model , asking for the power to do things that they have no reasonable right to do . 
  going for a model that is incredibly centralised with a lot of control and oversight over * everyone * involved in * all * aspects of the model . 
  it just does n't feel necessary or right . 
   they technically can be mutually exclusive, 
  i do n't think that means what you think it means . 
  mutually exclusive means that you * ca n't * take the two of them together . 
  however , the point you 're trying to make is a really important one . 
  an awesome thing about warlocks is the sheer number of independent decisions they make . 
  a patron , a pact boon , eldritch invocations , cantrips , and spells , and to a large extent , these are independent decisions with only a small number of restrictions based on other choices . 
  boons and patrons sure can * suggest * one another , but there should n't be any restrictions . 
  \\*\\* bang **, 
  okay , what 's this about ? 
  ah , thanks for this . 
  it really helps me understand exactly what went on . 
  well , you could always [ just listen to the soundtrack ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8ac1qg-r-8 ) . 
  just in case it was n't clear , [ in this arrangement ] ( http://s3.amazonaws.com/halleonard-pagepreviews/hl_dds_900091garml2gck4.png ) the bit i 'm talking about is the pick up to bar 4 . 
  but of course , any excuse to rewatch is a good one !, 
  personally i 'm happy with your suggestion , or with my own . 
   i say we , as mods , vote on it now, 
  but i 'm not a mod :(, 
  to be frank , warlocks are not good at support . 
  the best warlock would probably be the undying light , but because of al 's restrictions , that probably wo n't be an option for you . 
  and even if it were , it 's not a very good support character until level 10 . 
  seems reasonable . 
  to be honest i 've never really understood this sentiment . 
  a lot of people seem to dislike the idea of magic and science-fiction-like elements coexisting . 
  in d&d , there are a ** lot ** of people who just blindly hate on the idea of psionics just because they perceive it to be `` sci-fi '' , and that it therefore does n't belong in a fantasy world . 
  never mind the fact that their premise is just fucking stupid , i just do n't see how the conclusion makes any sense . 
  dc has * never * had a problem merging high-tech ( batman , green arrow ) , with pseudo-fantasy ( superman , the flash , most dc heroes ) , with full on magic ( zatanna , constantine ) , with science-fantasy/fiction ( green lantern , arguably martian manhunter ) . 
  i do n't see why people think of them as incompatible when they so demonstrably are not . 
  i have no fucking idea what the fuck you 're talking about . 
  personally my problem is n't that it 's overpowered ( i agree with you , it 's really quite a minor feature ) , but that when nearly everyone has it , the unique flavour is gone . 
  i kinda like the idea of adventurers needing to worry about bringing light sources while dungeon delving , just because it 's nice flavour . 
  everyone having darkvision ruins that . 
  yeah , but we want good quality pdfs that are properly searchable . 
  the ones out there have some ocr , but it 's not perfect , and can make ctrl/cmd-fing not work in some cases , and produces weird outputs when you copy-paste . 
   i see a lot of similarities between this and the paid mod situation from last year with skyrim and valve, 
  i thought the same thing , and mentioned as such on the bts/ua discord chat . 
  it seems really interesting to me that the reaction here has been a mostly positive one , when the paid mods on skyrim had the exact opposite reaction . 
  what * are * your house rules ? 
   i absolutely can not abide by your suggestion that the head moderator does not have jurisdiction to party subreddits, 
  and i absolutely can not abide by your suggestion that they would .
