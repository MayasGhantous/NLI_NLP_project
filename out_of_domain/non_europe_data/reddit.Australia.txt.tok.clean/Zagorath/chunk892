  party subreddits should not be under the jurisdiction of the same central authority as the public subreddits . 
  i support all of the above . 
  it seems like a reasonable compromise . 
  no , it is not okay with me . 
  nobody outside of the party should be allowed in to party subreddits . 
  full stop . 
  oh god , the complaints about bloody midichlorians are the worst . 
  they do ** nothing ** but ** add ** to the lore of that world . 
  there are a lot of problems with the prequels , but they are certainly not one of them . 
  what 's the reference ? 
  the talks of `` innocence '' and `` virtues '' definitely emphasises the themes of vampires , too . 
  was there anything else to go along with that ? 
  a title or description like we got with the escapist one ? 
  i thought beholder at first , too , but the droplets of blood on the girl , and more importantly the description and title , with talk of `` innocence '' and `` virtue '' , make me think vampire is more likely what they 're going for . 
  i doubt it 's going to be primarily ravenloft though . 
  i do n't think they want to leave the realms just yet . 
  they seem to want to stay with fr for as long as they can . 
  it 'll probably have a mention about how to convert it for ravenloft though . 
  you might very well think that . 
  i could n't possibly comment . 
  there was a tease a long time ago that the next story would be shakespearean themed ( do n't think they mentioned a specific play at any point ) , and would feature giants prominently , in the same way that the last adventure was alice in wonderland themed and featured demons . 
  but that was so long ago , that it 's possible they 've changed their mind for various reasons . 
  a woman standing in front of what looks like symbolism for a beholder , wearing one of those victorian style dresses , along with a title and associated text that talks about `` innocence '' and `` virtue '' ? 
  pretty strong hint that the story will be about vampires , in my book . 
  and what classifies as `` haunting '' if not vampires ? 
  ( zombies and ghosts , i guess , but not much else is better qualified . ), 
  what did you previously think ? 
  i 'm so sorry you had to learn it this way . 
  sometime , ignorance truly is bliss . 
  i 'm very doubtful that that 's quite the reason . 
  the ip that would be in play here is copyright , and german copyright lasts at most life + 70 . 
  i do n't know exactly how it plays out with works `` published '' as long ago as this , but at the * latest * , the castle as a work of art would be public domain in the 1950s . 
  i 'm sure there are other legitimate legal reasons that they can say no photography inside . 
  but ip law is not one of them . 
  would you care to explain why ? 
  i mean , yeah , theoretically . 
  but for a physically healthy man to drown in water that shallow , with no or minimal currents at play , is very difficult to believe . 
  especially when he 's known to be a strong swimmer . 
  no , autopsy is indeed the right word . 
  he had already been dethroned , was n't that done to stop him spending money on wagner and castles ? 
  regardless , my only point was that accidental death seems extremely unlikely . 
  i make no claim as to whether suicide or murder is more likely . 
  the reason for the 24 hours on the notice paper is , as far as i 'm aware , because of the removal of notice papers and sitting days as they exist irl . 
  the 24 hour freeze is , i think , meant to simulate the time between when something is placed on the notice paper , and when the sitting day associated with that notice paper actually begins . 
  but i do certainly think that said 24 hour freeze is probably unnecessary . 
  the first reading is apolitical anyway , so we could probably get straight into second reading debate 24 hours after it is placed on the notice . 
  i pretty much agree with you on everything regarding the way moderation should work . 
  hands off , with significant changes that occur after the start of parliament being done in universe . 
  with the new system removing notice papers and sitting days streamlines things substantially , and makes a lot of sense in the asynchronous , parallel business nature of model parliament . 
  and because of how quickly things can now get through parliament , these sorts of in-universe changes will be much easier to accomplish than they previously were . 
  the only disagreement we have is regarding party subreddits , which i wo n't get into here because this thread seems to be more about the general approach to moderating than specific powers . 
  hey , you should take a look at our [ style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) to learn how to format posts . 
  in particular , prefix lines with ''  '' to have them display as basic greentext . 
   the motto of rangers is `` jack of all trades , master of none . '', 
  i thought that was the bard . 
  right , so i was correct . 
  basically , my suggestion was that it would n't be entirely unreasonable to allow the first reading to occur immediately after the post was put on the notice paper , since after the first reading , there 's a wait of at least a day before the second reading can occur , anyway . 
  it does n't really bother me either way though . 
  the period i referred to in the second paragraph is the same one as in the first . 
  no worries at all mate . 
   other than you like realism, 
  this should be enough of a reason , in my opinion . 
  keeping it close to real is what makes model parliament worth playing compared to other model governments , imo . 
  but if you want more reason , it 's because going through the motions to change those aspects is fun !, 
  part of the point of the model is getting to implement changes to the country . 
  introducing new legislation , repealing others , and fixing the political process to be more equitable . 
  it 's about wish fulfilment , in a way , and fixing the process : the voting system , the standing orders , etc. , is a crucial part of that . 
  spoken like a true head mod . 
  i now want to play a mash-up of monopoly and cluedo . 
  trying to amass wealth and property at the same time as solving a murder . 
  as a side note , does anyone know any high fantasy variations on cluedo ? 
  i remember playing a very cluedo-like harry potter themed game when i was young . 
  a d&d or lotr themed one could be interesting . 
  not that it would add much to the game itself , just a touch of nice flavour . 
  careful . 
  it does n't cost 1000 gp to cast . 
  it requires an orb worth 1000 gp . 
  it * does n't * expend the orb , though . 
  so you have to pay 1000 gp once , but you can use that orb as many times as you like . 
  same as with spells like identify , which requires a pearl worth 100 gp , but does n't destroy it . 
  hey , sorry this was removed automatically . 
  we 've been having some serious problems with spam , so at the moment we 're automatically removing any posts from brand new accounts . 
  i 've manually enabled this one . 
  by the way , to get things to format correctly on reddit , you need to put a blank line in between paragraphs . 
  as the other reply says , the opposite is true . 
   but if a cost is indicated for a component , a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell . 
  if a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell , the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell . 
  this splits all spells into four categories , though one of them is purely theoretical so far , as there are no spells that actually do this . 
  the first is `` free '' spells . 
  spells which have material components that do not consume the component , and which have no cost for the component . 
  most spells with a material component fit into this category . 
  one can cast these spells using a spellcasting focus , such as a wand or staff , or one can handwave having the actual components indicated by using a component pouch . 
  one can also actually specifically go out and gather the components if one wishes , but even in this case , the component is * not * expended by the spell , so you can gather it once and use it as many times as you like . 
  this is the * only * category of spells where foci or component pouches can be used . 
  the second is spells which consume the component , but do not have a cost . 
  this is the theoretical type of spell , there are none of these . 
  however , if one were made , it would mean you have to go out and specifically gather that component for each casting of the spell , because casting would use it up . 
  the third is ones which have a component cost , but do * not * consume it . 
  identify and scrying are examples . 
  as described above , you have to spend the gold to obtain the component once , but after that , you can use the component as much as you want .
