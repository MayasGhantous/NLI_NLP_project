  * of course * you 're not going to be seeing black people . 
  i ca n't make any guarantees , but i 'll do the best i can to get a good recording of it . 
   and i think most of the time we end up laughing at code without giving any way for a beginner to learn from that mistakes, 
  really ? 
  because i come here mainly because i love seeing people write about the best way to do things . 
  it 's fun seeing these scenarios that are used as jokes , and then seeing a serious take on it . 
  their netflix shows are actually really damn good . 
  i 've got no interest in the other ones , though . 
   no , i do n't know that that is either, 
  someone needs to watch young justice . 
   who watch too much cw, 
  there 's a lot more of that type of thing on this show than there is on arrow or flash , though . 
  i 've got ta be honest , i 'm not a huge fan of the concept . 
  it 's a little * too * meta for me . 
  however , the balance of the patron itself looks pretty fair . 
  the level 10 feature feels a little bit weak to me , not to mention that long rest abilities are generally not super idiomatic to the warlock . 
  maybe if you made it the same ability , but a short rest reset , that could fix it on both accounts . 
  the level 6 ability might work better as a short rest feature as well . 
  the rest of the patron abilities are great , and the 14th level one probably should * not * be changed to a short rest . 
  so for the most part , very good . 
  the pact of the d20 is interesting , as are the invocations that key off of it . 
  i 'm not 100 % sure about how well balanced they are , but they seem alright to me . 
  the other invocations are not quite so great . 
  many existing invocations give you free use of level 1 spells ( and level 9 invocations that grant free use of level ** 3 ** spells , and at level 15 you can get level 4 spells ) , so one that gives you a cantrip is just lame . 
  the one that grants you a spell once without a spell slot is * too * good . 
  most of the existing warlock ones give you a spell that * does * cost a spell slot , once per day . 
  flickr is sort of a halfway point between cheap shit photos on instagram and true professional stuff on 500px , zenfolio , and similar . 
  most of its stuff is slightly more aimed at artistic intent , but the photographers are still , for the most part , not professional quality . 
  there are definitely professionals on there , but that 's not the majority . 
  i figure new monsters are a given . 
  new spells , uh , maybe ? 
  i 'd say they 're about as likely as races and archetypes are . 
  some cool magic items would also be nice . 
   dated popculture reference or meme, 
  aww ... :(, 
  i was with you on all the other points , but then you tried to take away my monty python !, 
  i really think that should be mandatory reading for every new dm , and should be considered highly recommended for players as well . 
  hahaha all good mate . 
  i was mostly just taking the piss there . 
  hey , if you want it to display correctly , you need to put a blank line in between each line of content , otherwise it all appears as one big run-on paragraph . 
  awesome job . 
  is there another way he should be saying it ? 
  fair enough . 
  but at the very least , they did n't * detract * from the story in any way , like many people claim . 
  personally though , i 've always thought of midichlorians as an * indication * of more force power , not a * cause * of it . 
  an entity that 's attracted to the force , so people with more force sensitivity have higher counts of them , but injecting them would n't have any effect . 
  sudo echo `` 127.0.0.1 xss-doc . appspot.com ''   / etc/hosts, 
  edit : hmm ... that does n't seem to work ... ` - bash : / etc/hosts : permission denied `, 
  anyone got any tips ? 
  my ` . bash_history ` now looks like i really want to learn about manatees , but ca n't spell . 
  but yes , thanks , that worked . 
  echo `` 127.0.0.1 xss-doc . appspot.com '' | sudo tee - a / etc/hosts, 
  and even then , it 's only the production that 's banned . 
  viewing it is completely legal . 
  i would assume it 's because they get their products for far cheaper , since they 're not name brands . 
   closed as too broad, 
  how you know it 's a legitimate so question . 
  on the other hand , my one time trying the drupal stackexchange was abysmal . 
  there 's one particular mod over there that 's just an arsehole who seems to take joy in shutting down useful informative conversations . 
  i 've noticed that same name popping up closing things and editing stuff on a lot of other posts that i 've found through google . 
  and the site 's admins do n't give a shit . 
  they 're more than happy to let the abusive mods keep abusing . 
  you could put cool things on your stump , like knives and mallets and stuff !, 
  i also avoided it at first , but for a slightly more considered reason . 
  i had no problem with the idea of a batman prequel without batman . 
  my problem was one perfectly summed up by [ this comment ] ( / r/gotham/comments / 4154rl/fox _ open_to_considering_gotham_spinoff / cz0db0d ) . 
   in most tellings of bats ' history , he puts on the cowl to take down common street thugs and then his big villains start appearing out of the shadows . 
  but here , gordon 's doing a good job working ( mostly ) within the law , but we already know he 's destined to fail . 
  in this universe all of his villains will already be well-established and bats will be the solution as opposed to the cause of the crazies . 
  that aspect was super important to me , and the very idea of major batman villains appearing in gotham before bats himself really turned me off . 
  but eventually , the pestering of my family about how good the show is got me to reluctantly watch it . 
  the first episode had me hooked . 
  i * hated * the fact that bruce and parents did n't leave the theatre specifically because bruce was scared . 
  i still hate that . 
  to me that 's important to bruce 's character , and there was no good reason that they did n't do it in this show ; it did n't add anything to the characters of bruce or to our main protagonist , jim gordon . 
  in fact , if anything , it detracted a little , since it made less sense for bruce to blame himself , and the death would obviously affect him less than it did if it appeared to happen because he made them leave the theatre early . 
  but i 've moved on from that . 
  whatever . 
  in the grand scheme of things , it 's a fairly minor detail . 
  the show itself is fantastic . 
  i 'm absolutely loving how they 're developing penguin . 
  he 's a character i know precious little about , so the idea of bruce and jim having had interactions with him prior to batman coming about does n't bother me very much at all . 
  using him as a lead in was a genius idea to attract viewers like me who were hesitant to see batman villains before batman himself is on the scene . 
  and just as a character in his own right , penguin is brilliant . 
  probably my favourite villain that i 've seen in any medium recently . 
  nygma is similar . 
  i 've loved his character arc . 
  however , i really hope he does n't go full-out riddler with the green suit , bowler hat , and the question mark cane during this show . 
  i think that would be a step in the wrong direction . 
  i hated what they were doing with jerome . 
  as much as i 've come to say `` fine , i 'll just accept it for the sake of the show '' with all these other villains , the joker is a step * too far * . 
  he absolutely ** must not ** make a true appearance on the show prior to batman . 
  i was so relieved when they ended up killing him off . 
  i loved his performance , but he was developing too much too soon for me . 
  i 'm not sure i like freeze appearing either , but it 's too soon to really say , since all we 've had is a brief stinger . 
  but on the whole , i 'm super glad that i watched this show . 
  the writing , acting , and directing are all far superior to the arrowverse and supergirl , and i absolutely love the way a lot of the characters have been developing . 
  the biggest negative i have with it is the damn cityscape establishing shots all look awful . 
  and if that 's the biggest negative , then it 's a damn good show . 
  why does everyone have a strong opinion about how he pronounced gcpd , though ?
