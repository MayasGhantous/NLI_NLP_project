  i ca n't think of any other way that one would pronounce it ... 
   but it feels the most comicbooky out of the other dc ones on right now, 
  really ? 
  because i honestly feel like it 's the * least * comicbooky . 
  the flash is by far the most comicbooky , really embracing its lighthearted nature and just enjoying itself for the nerdy show it is . 
  arrow is kinda going in the same direction lately , and supergirl mostly feels similar to the flash , with some added `` girl power '' type stuff . 
  gotham feels like it 's taking every effort to * distance * itself from the source material in many ways , while also making really obvious references and using foreshadowing to attract the fans of the dc universe . 
  it sits a really nice happy medium between the two , and i think the show is really strong because of it . 
  sorry , as coolgamertagbro says , this subreddit is for more or less complete material , and you can post in the [ workshop megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 41iv5q/workshop _ megathread_works_in_progress_requests / ) to get help on creating homebrew stuff from scratch . 
  one thing i really liked about gordon was just how damn * straight * he was at the start , but he 's slowly coming around to see that it 's necessary to deal with the devil sometimes . 
  by the time batman enters the scene , he 'll probably be ready to embrace someone that can mete out justice , even if he does do so outside the bounds of the law . 
  a really nice character arc . 
  i think the importance arises when it comes to deciding * if * we want to make any changes . 
  what is the current law on school uniform colours ? 
  in real life queensland , all students must wear maroon ties , but in nsw , they must wear blue . 
  ( not really , but for the sake of argument . ), 
  the members of parliament want ties to all be blue . 
  do they need to enact a new bill to do this , or have we inherited the existing laws of nsw on this issue , which would mean nothing needs to be done ? 
  i 'm in agreement on that . 
  nsw might not have the * best * laws , but it 's the most populous state , so it makes sense to use them as a starting point . 
  though i would like to grab queensland 's cycling laws , because not being able to ride on the footpath is stupid , and the new 1 m rule has proven amazing for cyclists on the road . 
   someone brought up that the show loses some of its suspense because we know these people will live or these people will die , but i have to disagree with that . 
  the show manages to capture plenty of suspense still, 
  yeah , i agree with you there . 
  i actually think the show * gains * a lot because we know how people will end up . 
  we get to see exactly how they get there . 
  seeing gordon go from this straight and narrow cop to someone willing to go outside the law and work with penguin , to knowing he 'll eventually be accepting of the fact that batman does what he does . 
  and all the references they 've made about bruce 's personality ( knowing what batman is like ) have just been brilliant . 
  fuck this region-locking bullshit . 
  wow this is fantastic . 
  definitely going to have to take a look through a lot of these !, 
  i might be biased , since i 'm a huge fan of the genre anyway , but i find a lot of classical music is fantastic for games . 
  holst 's `` the planets '' , nearly anything by beethoven , depending on the circumstances , maybe some bach . 
  really there 's just so much stuff out there you 'll always be able to find an awesome fit if you know where to look . 
  film music is great , too . 
  john williams is , of course , the master , but howard shore 's lord of the rings soundtrack , ramin djawadi 's game of thrones , and jeremy zuckerman 's score for avatar are all great picks for the right occasion . 
  with williams , it 's often worth looking off the beaten track . 
  some of his less well-known scores are really good , and you can find music for just about any setting and occasion . 
  i 'm surprised your school let you do additional with only an a in extended maths , to be honest . 
  regardless , if you 've done add maths , you 're capable of maths hl if you want to . 
  out of interest , what are you interested in ? 
  do you have any ideas of what sort of field you might want to study at university ? 
  yep , that 's my thought , too . 
  any kind of `` standard '' feeling creature . 
  humanoids , real world animals , and things that are similar to those , if they successfully sneak up on the target , they 'd automatically kill . 
  i would n't apply that ruling to highly magical beings like devils or dragons . 
  i think you 've missed the point . 
  in combat , the majority of a rogue 's damage comes from sneak attack . 
  especially as they level up , less and less of their damage will come from the weapon die . 
  if you attack once per round , then if that one attack misses , you do zero damage . 
  if you 've got two attacks , if the first misses , you 've got a second chance to hit . 
  if * either * of your two attacks hits , you get to use your sneak attack , and do pretty much the full amount of damage . 
  but i agree completely with your penultimate paragraph . 
  to me , flavour is king . 
  for me , the idea of a swashbuckling rogue fighting with a rapier is just too cool to avoid , even if it is n't as optimal with its mechanics . 
  i 've seen discussions of mains-gauches on other d&d subreddits before , but a recent conversation i 've had about rogues has got me wondering again . 
  has anyone seen some good homebrew rules to make using a main-gauche a viable option ? 
  especially for a sort of swashbuckler rogue type , wielding a rapier plus a dagger . 
  if your main hand uses a non-light weapon , you 'd have to get the feat in order to use a dagger in your off hand . 
  but if you 've gone to all the effort of grabbing that feat , it 's mechanically a waste if you * do n't * use two larger weapons . 
   it 's common sense that the combat rules have nothing to do with how you kill someone who is sleeping peacefully with no inkling that they 're even in danger, 
  agreed completely . 
  it 's really why i find most of the other answers in this thread * extremely * lacking , and something i love about 5e , since it * does n't * have any rules that look like they should apply here ( such that you would feel kinda * forced * to use them , even if they do n't really make sense ) . 
  from what i gathered from the op , statistically meaningful is n't meant to be some official term for it . 
  it seemed to me like op just needed a word to describe an effect size that is significant enough to be worth worrying about . 
  i agree with / u/shaggorama that `` practically significant '' would be a better word for it . 
   sorry , what sample size was used , with which near 0 variance , in order to show a 0.01 % increase in risk of cancer ? 
  hahaha yeah , i was going to make a similar comment . 
  it 's much easier to prove large effects with statistical significance than really small ones , simply because it 's easy to arrive at a small effect by random chance . 
  nevertheless , it is theoretically possible to arrive at statistically significant results of such a minor effect size , so whatever . 
  haha actually you 're absolutely right . 
  i left zimmer out of the list out of habit , but for this specific purpose , he 's actually a good pick . 
  the server wo n't let me connect at all , and has n't for over an hour . 
  it just constantly says `` update failed -- retrying in x seconds '' , and when it reaches 0 , it starts the counter again . 
  i ca n't get to https://status.discordapp.com , either , because it keeps making me do a captcha , and every time i submit it , it just reloads the same page with the captcha . 
   only very few subjects are frowned upon, 
   you might want to do business and management, 
  interestingly , this is one of the other subjects that is generally looked at as less academic . 
  okay , here are my thoughts , what do people think ? 
  * 1d4 damage . 
  light , finesse . 
  ( basically , the same stats as a dagger but not throwable . ), 
  * +1 ac against melee attacks when dual-wielding with a finesse weapon in the other hand . 
  * if you take the attack action on your turn , you may attack using your main-gauche as a bonus action , even if wielding a non-light weapon in your other hand . 
  however , if you do so , you lose the +1 ac until the start of your next turn . 
  thoughts ? 
  but i thought they track viewerships for * every * episode ... 
   what else in the game gives you a reroll on demand ? 
  well , lucky , for starters , and in a way , the divination wizard 's portents . 
  the only way to go about this really is to look at composers who are * today * only known for one piece , because many composers were in their time known for more , but their others have since been largely forgotten . 
  * pachelbel is probably the biggest one that comes to mind . 
  everyone knows his [ canon in d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvnqlj1_hq0 ) , but could you name anything else ? 
  * carl orff is basically only known for his [ carmina burana ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qellleco4om ) , and that in particular is largely only known ( among non classical music fans ) for the `` o fortuna '' which starts and ends it . 
  * you probably know paul dukas ' [ sorcerer 's apprentice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4yh4b9deok ) , in part because of disney 's fantasia sketch of the same name . 
  * to a lesser extent , boccherini is mostly known for his [ minuet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2azoknkotvc ) , though this is less true among classical fans . 
  * for something a bit more modern , mostly people only know samuel barber 's [ adagio for strings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izqsge0l450 ) . 
  * to a far lesser extent than any of the above , but still somewhat true , especially for people with only a very casual interest in classical music , unless you happen to be a fan of wind bands , you may only know gustav holst 's [ the planets ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahvsszw7nds ) . 
  as you say , grieg has the piano concerto and the peer gynt suite . 
  from peer gynt , there are actually two bits that are famous . 
  there 's [ morning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hayo7-bowb0 ) , which you just named , and there 's also [ in the hall of the mountain king ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klp_hh6dkwc ) .
