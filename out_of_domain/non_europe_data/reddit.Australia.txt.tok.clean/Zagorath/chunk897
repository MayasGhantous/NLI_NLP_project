  but for this game it was absolutely worth it . 
  i 'm not sure i 'd call it a true `` let 's play '' , though , since the video-er did n't speak to the audience ( which is probably the most annoying thing about most let 's plays imo , but it 's also -- as i understand it -- what makes the genre * interesting * for those that do enjoy them ) , but whatever it was , it was an amazing experience all around . 
   if you are absolutely dead-set on having a new weapon , instead of just a flavored dagger, 
  well , yeah ... a flavoured dagger is useless . 
  ca n't be dual wielded with a rapier without a feat ( in which case it 's substantially worse than a second rapier ) , and is a worse option than a second shortsword with a primary shortsword . 
  yours is certainly a better suggestion than leuku 's , if only because the idea of having to use a reaction to gain the ac is an interesting model to work with . 
  but it 's still fundamentally just a worse shield . 
  the option to use it to gain both some form of defensive bonus compared to a single weapon and empty hand , and to have some capacity to attack with both weapons without a feat , is the fundamental * point * of this . 
  it obviously should n't be able to do either of those as well as a specialist , but some capacity in both needs to be there . 
  yeah , and that reason is mostly to prevent things like dual rapiers ( 2d8 ) , or even things like a longsword and a shortsword ( 1d8 +1 d6 ) . 
  rapier + dagger gives 1d8 +1 d4 , which works out to have nearly identical stats to 2d6 \\* , which * is * already allowed . 
  which leaves me thinking , perhaps the only `` special '' property of this should be that it 's allowed to be used alongside any finesse weapon , including non-light ones . 
  you 're getting pretty much the statistics of two shortswords . 
  of course , that gives up the defensive aspect of it , which is a shame , but not too terrible . 
  perhaps an optional feat designed specifically for this weapon , to make it still a viable option compared to the dual wield feat ? 
  maybe give the same `` draw or sheath two weapons at once '' as the dual wield feat , but swap out the permanent +1 ac and the `` use any two one-handed weapons '' ( which essentially gives you 2d8 in damage ) with '' +2 ac against melee weapon attacks '' . 
  how does that sound ? 
  edit : \\* they both have the same expected value , minimum value , and maximum value , but 2d6 is more likely to land in the middle , and 1d4 +1 d8 is more likely to land very low or very high within that range , though the difference is a relatively minor one . 
  hey , you should take a look at our [ style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) to learn how to format posts . 
  in particular , prefix lines with ''  '' to have them display as basic greentext . 
  yeah , the creator of it has actually specified at some point that the lack of normal magical healing is an intended feature . 
  healthy potions and hit dice should still work , but most of the clerical-type spells will not . 
  touch\u00e9, 
   i think hinging its function with that of another weapon was this weapon design 's fatal mistake . 
  i can see why you would say that , but this is just me trying to be explicit about something that is implicitly there in the existing weapons . 
  a d6 weapon is already * designed * to be used with another d6 weapon ( e.g. , two shortswords ) . 
  a d8 weapon is designed to be used with either a shield under normal circumstances . 
  d10 weapons generally have some other special properties to justify their existance , like reach or versatility . 
  d12 and 2d6 weapons are for the heavy-hitting two handed stuff . 
   it would n't be just a d4 damage die . 
  it 'd be 1d4 + mod, 
  actually , it would n't , since it 's mainly going to be an offhand weapon . 
  the fighting style could change that , but then you 're still comparing it to d6 + mod anyway . 
   it does n't say you can use two weapon fighting with this even if the other weapon you are wielding does n't have the light property - it says that you get a bonus action attack, 
  not sure what you mean here . 
  but if you 're arguing semantics , then make it clear that that 's what you 're doing , and make your suggestions about changing the wording , rather than changing the * feature * as intended . 
   additionally , based on the above warning , you could get your bonus action attack without even wielding two weapons in your hand . 
  you could wield the main gauche in 1 hand and a shield in the other , and you would still get your bonus action attack, 
  see above . 
  in fact , the entire rest of the post needs to see above . 
  going to all the effort of showing the maths and giving all these descriptions and examples , when you know perfectly well that it was a mistake in wording and not design is just obnoxious . 
   when wielding a main gauche in one hand and a finesse weapon in your other hand , you may two weapon fight , even if the other weapon lacks the light property . 
  while wielding a main gauche in this way , you gain a +1 ac bonus against melee attacks, 
  aside from a couple of minor wording problems ( it would be better to say `` you may use two weapon fighting '' , to fit with the terminology of the game , and it should say `` against melee * weapon * attacks '' , since it should n't apply on , for example , shocking grasp ) , this actually feels a little too powerful to me . 
  i agree with you that the conditional ac bonus is a bit counter to 5e 's streamlined approach , but it 's an important part of the balance for this weapon . 
  to be able to get both the +1 ac * and * the extra attack every turn makes this seem op in my opinion . 
  but anyway , all of that is actually moot , because i did a bit of maths , and i 've worked out that even doing that is still op . 
  1d4 +1 d8 works out almost identical to 2d6 , and wielding two shortswords grants you no ac bonus at all , so neither should rapier + main-gauche . 
  see [ this comment elsewhere in this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/424pbi/maingauche/cz84dsg ) for a bit more detail . 
  i wonder if you have any thoughts about that ? 
  yeah , sorry , we do n't have the power to do that . 
  your options are to leave it as-is ( which , imo , is totally fine ) , or to delete it and repost it with the correct title . 
  so , my first thoughts ( before reading through it ) are that this is a much-needed option . 
  thanks so much for making it . 
  as you said in the previous submission , the existing options are just not viable for a character . 
  and on the topic , since they 're so often associated , and both suffer from the exact same problem with the official rules , here 's [ a vampire prestige class ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/3qnv6q/vampire_prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big/ ) for anyone that 's interested in that , too . 
  second thought , on a brief scan through . 
  it * looks * really nice . 
  great artwork , well merged with the text . 
  however , for some reason , [ pages 6 and 11 are n't displaying for me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vd6opjg.png ) . 
  that is ... obviously a problem . 
  there 's also a minor stylistic problem with the way text wraps around images . 
  if you take a look at the phb , only rarely does text wrap around images , and when it does , it 's always on the * right * edge ( and even then , it 's very subtle and ambiguous , it 's possible that the image was placed to fit with how the words wrapped anyway , rather than the words being designed to wrap around the image ) . 
  the left line is * always * strictly with the column . 
  so things like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cxe264f.png ) are inadvisable . 
  also , text wrap should be left-aligned , rather than justified . 
  and on a more detailed read through . 
  the main prerequisites seem fine , but i would remove the jokey bits from wild apotheosis . 
  i would end it with `` or eaten certain herbs '' , and ignore the bits about moons on friday or touched water drunk by a wolf . 
  the proficiency should probably be reworked as a level 1 feature , rather than a proficiency . 
  it should grant * advantage * on perception checks relying on smell or sight , rather than proficiency . 
  and the last bit should be reworded to be `` you can also determine if there are any other werewolves around , on a successful dc 10 wisdom ( perception ) check . '', 
  or something like that . 
  i 'm not sure i understand the `` spontaneous healing '' ability . 
  it 's poorly worded , so i ca n't fully understand the intent , but even so , it seems like adding dex to healing does n't really make much sense as an ability . 
  i like the first few flaws a lot . 
  they 're brilliant . 
  you should change the '' \\* may \\* '' to '' * may * '' , but otherwise that 's fine . 
  a werewolf ca n't stand its own smell ? 
  how does that work ? 
  i also am not a huge fan of moon cursed . 
  the wording , first of all , could be improved . 
  `` imposing '' is definitely not the word you want to use . 
  `` requiring '' would probably fit better , but i 'm not entirely sure it 's the best word , either . 
  and i feel like we need a better understanding of how it works . 
  what happens if you * do n't * kill ? 
  i think perhaps something similar to the way blood points play out in the vampire prestige class would work better , so that there are penalties for not doing it , and those can be sated by killing . 
  it seems odd that you would retain all skill proficiencies . 
  a werewolf is just as good at arriving at diplomatic solutions ( apart from the fact that he ca n't speak ) as his human form ? 
  just as good at determining the historical significance of an item , or controlling his horse , or applying medicinal herbs ? 
  `` you can not cast spells or maintain concentration '' . 
  not `` neither '' . 
  the final bullet point on page 5 needs some serious rewording . 
  and the one about what you wear could probably be made clearer , too . 
  anyway , i have to go now . 
  i 'll finish the rest of it up when i get back , but there 's some stuff to start with . 
  oh really ? 
  could you point them out for me ? 
  ah , thanks . 
  so it is .
