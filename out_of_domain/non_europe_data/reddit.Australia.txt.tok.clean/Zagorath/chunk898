  for / r/dndgreentext , a particularly good place to start is with the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which has a bunch of the best stories . 
   also dont feel like moneying it up, 
  d&d has a fair amount of free stuff available . 
  [ there are free pdfs of d&d basic for both players and dms ] ( https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules ) . 
  you can use a dice rolling app from the google play or apple app stores , and free character sheets are easy to find online , [ the dndnext wiki probably has a few ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/wiki/resourcelist ) . 
  there are obviously also less legal ways of going about things , if that 's more you bent . 
  the best way to play , by far , is in person with other real people . 
  if you do n't know anyone that plays , why not try and start a group up yourself ask your friends if they want to play , and run the campaign for them yourself !, 
  if you do that , i 'd highly suggest forking out $ 20 for the starter set , which comes with a physical copy of part of the above free rulebooks , as well as a basic pre-made campaign which is * really * easy to run for a new dm . 
  but if you really truly ca n't find anyone in person to play with , roll20 is a pretty good fallback . 
  yeah , that would be [ queensland rail 's `` super simple train etiquette '' campaign ] ( http://www.queenslandrail.com.au/about%20us/media%20centre/pages/trainetiquette.aspx ) from qr , which runs the train system ( in coordination with translink , which does the majority of transport in south east queensland ) in the australian state of queensland . 
  they 're kind of hilarious , but probably not in the way qr intended , especially once it became a world-wide meme . 
   when wielding a main gauche in one hand and a finesse weapon in your other hand , you may use two weapon fighting , even if the other weapon lacks the light property . 
  while wielding a main gauche , you can use a bonus action to gain a +1 bonus to ac against weapon attacks until the start of your next turn, 
  that 's a * really * clever solution . 
  my only problem with it is that it 's still just a strictly better option than standard two weapon fighting , since the option of 1d8 +1 d4 is equivalent to 2d6 , plus you 've got the added flexibility of the defensive option . 
  that 's why my idea was to leave it with just the ability to use it with two weapon fighting , and then add the option of a feat to gain some defensive capabilities , so that even with a feat involved , rapier + main-gauche is a viable option compared to other two-weapon fighting . 
  it 's unfortunate that this means the main-gauche -- a weapon * primarily * designed for defence -- grants no defensive bonus without a feat , but it helps keep it balanced in its normal form . 
  it also removes the need for any resource management ( either the loss of it from attacking , or keeping track of the bonus action or reaction that has been suggested ) , at least in the form i proposed initially -- +2 ac against melee weapon attacks ( since it is a feat , after all , and needs to compete with the two non-light weapons plus a +1 ac to everything that dual wielder provides ) . 
  perhaps conditional on * not * stacking with dual wielder , to prevent that cheese . 
  i do n't like sand . 
  it 's coarse , and rough , and irritating , and it gets everywhere . 
  there 's quite a lot of conversation about balancing this that 's gone on in [ the thread i submitted this in ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/424pbi/maingauche/ ) ( and you can go there to see a couple of options that i 'm considering at the moment ) , but the upshot of it all is that flexibility has to come at a cost . 
  if something is able to act in * two * capacities , and it 's equally good at ( or better at ) one of those capacities as something else that exists , then the flexible option is the objectively superior one , and that 's a problem for design . 
  in this case , being able to use a bonus action to do 1d4 damage , along with a 1d8 main weapon , is mathematically almost identical to two 1d6 weapons ( they have both the same expected value and the same minimum & maximum values ) . 
  so if you can do that , and * also * can choose to gain an increase in defence , that 's a bad design , since it leaves no reason to ever pick two shortswords ( at least mechanically -- there may still be flavour reasons for it ) . 
  the precise statistics of advantage and disadvantage depend on the actual target , but as a rule of thumb , it 's worth between about +3 and +5 , so yeah , the +1 ac is by far the less powerful choice . 
  posting stuff that 's completed here is completely kosher according to the rules . 
  the thing is , though , people are going to tend to be wary about anything that did n't go through a public feedback process . 
  if you 've just made this yourself , or even gotten advice from offline sources , there 's no way people can necessarily trust it to be balanced in the same way we can if you 've posted drafts here and tweaked it . 
  so posting something here and saying that your intention was `` to make people aware of the homebrew rather than seek advice '' , that 's going to rub people the wrong way . 
  so question , do you only monitor porn subs , or is there some other reason that it 's mostly only porn subs that seem to be in these lists ? 
  could be that they tend to have poor moderation , or that they 're perfect targets for spammers , or something . 
  i 'm just curious . 
  interesting . 
  how do you find brand new spammers , since their accounts seem to pop up like mushrooms ? 
  stack overflow ( and the stack exchange network in general ) is infamous for having horrible overzealous mods . 
  this is one such example . 
  the monster manual sections for each of these have stuff there , but it 's pretty terrible . 
  massively overpowered , and clearly not meant to be used as something that a player actually has for any significant amount of time . 
  if you 're actually interested in players contracting vampirism or lycanthropy and not having them immediately attempt to seek and find a cure , you 'll need some alternate rules . 
  for vampirism , [ this is fantastic ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/3qnv6q/vampire_prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big/ ) . 
  i 'm not aware of any good lycanthrope rules , but [ watch this space ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/42ahqs/werewolf_prestige_class/ ) . 
  it 's very new and far too rough to use just yet , but hopefully the creator will be receptive to feedback . 
   p. s. want that line from your post , zagorath  <, 
  you mean the ` < hr  ` / horizontal rule ? 
  just put three or more asterisks on a line by themselves :, 
   any player will try to break the game, 
  that 's a massively overly cynical view to have , and it is incredibly untrue . 
  many players , in fact i would say this is pretty much the * definition * of what differentiates good players from bad , would be capable of roleplaying a werewolf sensibly even if the rules did n't make them . 
  i 'm sorry that that has n't been your experience , but it just sounds like you 've had a string of bad players . 
  however , you 're definitely right that even so , the rules * should * be designed well . 
  there is certainly a place for deliberately leaving out rules for things in some cases , but this is not one of those cases . 
  at its most basic , i just think that a werewolf should probably only be allowed to keep proficiency in a limited set of skills while transformed . 
  athletics for sure , maybe acrobatics and intimidate , and probably pretty much nothing else . 
  yeah i have to pretty much agree with / u/slamadams . 
  i was n't a fan of barbara at the start at all , she was a dull and uninteresting character and i pretty much hated any time she was on screen . 
  but her change from that into the crazed psychopath she is now was stupidly forced . 
  i do n't know what was going on behind the scenes , but i really wish they had made that feel more natural . 
  however , in the end , it was worth it , because crazy barbara is a great character . 
  from the description , it sounds like he 's talking about top b , not any throat notes ... 
  that 's your opinion , and i certainly respect that . 
  but it is just not one that i can share . 
  i would rather listen to most of bach than most of mozart , though my favourite mozart would beat my favourite bach . 
  beethoven wins out over both of those , though , as does tchaikovsky , and rachmaninoff , and dvo\u0159\u00e1k , in my mind . 
  well , i mean , from a certain perspective , it 's not wrong . 
  we are classical music , after all , and not common practice period music, 
  honestly the weather would be the * last * thing i 'd change . 
  brisbane is already too cold for my liking in winter , and just about perfect in summer . 
  as long as you mean actual pancakes , and not those fucking cr\u00eapes that some people seem to think it 's acceptable to advertise in their menus as `` pancakes '' , then i am all in favour of this idea . 
  poached apple tesla , 2018 's android version ? 
  over on the right hand side , where it says `` show my flair on this subreddit . 
  it looks like : '' , press `` edit '' . 
   i 'm not sure how virtualenv works on ... mac, 
  i 'm not particularly familiar with virtualenv specifically , but os x is a unix-compliant system ( more so than linux is , in fact ) , so it should be easy . 
  python is installed out-of-the-box , and pip is easy to get . 
  yeah , the only way to fix the warping would be to take the panorama by gradually moving the camera down , instead of pivoting it . 
  obviously , not exactly practical for most applications . 
  normally , yeah , but they do n't have to . 
  if you take a look at a normal photo , it 's in a 3:2 ratio , which means the long side is 1.5 x the length of the short side . 
  if you hold it landscape , and only move up or down a fairly small amount , you can end up with two overlapping 3:2 rectangles which stitch together into a square . 
  no , you 're definitely right . 
  the intuitive thing to do is to hold it portrait . 
  i know that 's how i held my camera the first few times i took panoramas ( on a dslr though , not a phone ) . 
  the advantage of holding it in the opposite arrangement to the end result is fairly obvious though , once you think about it . 
  you end up taking more individual photos to stitch together over the same physical space , so you end up with a higher resolution image . 
  ah fair enough . 
  my phone has a really crappy camera so i basically never use it . 
  i prefer my dslr and manually stitching panoramas with photoshop . 
  they should really have a centralised location for user data , too . 
  like ` ~ / ` on a unix-like system . 
  do n't we need to hold the vote on things before this can go ahead ? 
  is there a tl ; dr of the difference between wright and its alternatives ? 
  i thought i was pretty up on things for knowing the difference between droop and hare quotas , but this aspect of it is beyond me . 
   and a new quota system, 
  the wikipedia article on it seemed to imply a droop quota was used . 
  but perhaps i was misinterpreting that . 
  fair enough . 
  that makes sense . 
  ah , thanks so much for this .
