  that is a truly brilliant system imo . 
  i really like the sound of it . 
  recounting each time a candidate is excluded really seems like it would simplify the process and make it far more fair . 
  the one thing i 'm still not entirely sure about is that first bit , about what happens to votes that have been used to elect candidates . 
  i understand what the intent is behind them ( and it 's a very good one ) , but i do n't understand how it plays out mechanically . 
  i 'm curious though , jnd says you 're proposing changing the quota . 
  how come , and what to ? 
  thanks again for writing all that out . 
  it definitely helps . 
  right , i get what the intent is . 
  what i 'm not sure about is exactly how it 's calculated in the case of an electoral system . 
  and yeah , that 's fair . 
  i was mainly asking because i was a touch afraid that you were suggesting hare quota . 
  i have no strong opinion either way between droop and h-b . 
  edit : removed reply to reply , since the first reply was deleted but then put back in place . 
  you know what , i had always just assumed that that 's how things would have been working anyway . 
  yeah , this is pretty much a no-brainer good idea . 
  if it was worth half before , and it gets distributed again , it should be divided based on its current weight , not get to be distributed from scratch again . 
   i know , i know . 
  these numbers do n't actually make sense . 
  get of my back !, 
  well , i was n't going to get on your back about it , because the example is so useful . 
  but now i have to get on your back about that typo . 
  it 's `` off '' , not `` of '' . 
  honestly i do n't know why trolls are so often brought up in discussions of metagaming . 
  they 're a creature that everyone in universe would doubtless have heard countless stories about . 
  their vulnerability to fire should be well-known to the characters , in most cases . 
   logically speaking , a dude walks up to you and starts chanting and waving his hands around holding some small object , in a world where magic is real , and you 'd probably be super suspicious that something might have been done to you, 
  hahaha , this image is damn hilarious . 
  but i would add that the spell does n't necessarily need to be cast quite like that . 
  hex has a range of 90 feet . 
  in the heat of combat , if someone from almost 30 metres away casts a spell and you do n't notice any effect on yourself , you 're probably not going to think that something has been done to you . 
  and even if it 's not in the heat of combat , one could quite easily hex someone from across a busy market square or similar . 
  a@bc is technically a valid email , too . 
  no email validation system ever uses the full technically valid set of email addresses , because frankly that 's stupid . 
  [ this gives some good explanation for why ] ( http://girders.org/blog/2013/01/31/dont-rfc-validate-email-addresses/ ) . 
  [ and here 's some more explanation ] ( http://markonphp.com/properly-validate-email-address-php/ ) , as well as some examples of which are and are not correctly handled by php 's ` filter_var ` function with ` filter_validate_email ` . 
  the upshot of it is that the built-in function is more enough for basically all practical use cases . 
  this is literally all the information that you need to know to answer the question . 
  but perhaps a bit more importantly , the `` running high jump world record '' is n't a `` running high jump '' world record . 
  it 's just a high jump world record . 
  if anyone thought they could do better in the high jump * without * a run up , they 'd be allowed to try -- there 's no rule that you * have * to run up . 
  but no one has , because it does n't work . 
  you 're right that you should use a library rather than roll your own . 
  but this is not an example of why . 
  even [ good email validators ] ( http://markonphp.com/properly-validate-email-address-php/ ) will reject this in many cases . 
    i have summoned othe daemons ( set and azazel ) and i need to summon lucifer . 
  no you have n't . 
  you sat in a closet and hyperventilated until you thought you saw the greek spelling of demons ; egyptian god set , mistranslation turned character * `` for absolute removal '' * in hebrew . 
  aww , that 's way more reasonable than i would have hoped for on a subreddit called `` satanism '' . 
  in your defence , this subreddit 's css seems to make the tilde look really weird when it 's put in ` < code  ` blocks . 
  it 's easy to miss . 
  what about in a duel to first blood ? 
   one good thing about this approach is allowing aliases , making it more user friendly , but when some user tries to register other account use the sanitized address to verify and show `` you already registered as user+alias@example.com '' . 
  hmm , i 'm not sure i like that . 
  first of all , is that + alias syntax a part of email ? 
  i thought it was something google just did for their users . 
  but even if it is an official thing , part of the advantage of it is being able to register multiple accounts with the same email , which is a completely legitimate use case on the vast majority of websites . 
  it 'd be nice if they gave the user a reminder , in case they were accidentally trying to register a new account when they did n't realise they already have one , but the user should at the least be able to by-pass it . 
  tell me , mr. 81 , is your email one that would be rejected by ` filter_var ( $ email81 , filter_validate_email ) ` ? 
  because i very much doubt it is , and if it is n't , then your comment is entirely irrelevant , because i was very specifically talking about that set of email addresses , which is one that no reasonable email service gives out . 
  yeah , you 're pretty much right . 
  my idea sacrifices both flavour and realism in favour of balance . 
  but i 'm okay with that . 
  for me , at least just the image of wielding the rapier and dagger is mostly enough . 
  the feat is there mainly so that rapier + dagger can be an equally viable option as 2 rapiers , if a feat is invested in each case . 
  it also helps to add back in some of that flavour and realism that was lost for the sake of balance with the basic weapon . 
  it 's a far from ideal solution , but i think it works . 
  for a touch more realism with the basic weapon , what do you think of saying that the rapier in this combo ( or , more generally , the finesse weapon wielded alongside the main-gauche ) is eligible for the dueling fighting style , but that the main-gauche is * not * eligible for the two weapon fighting fighting style . 
  it does n't make up for the lack of defensive flavour , but it does emphasise the fact that it 's used for dueling , and the fact that the main-gauche is n't very good offensively . 
  i 'm curious , what would be your opinion on wright with the droop quota as compared to the current system ? 
  and aside from that , what exactly is the nature of the difference between droop and h-b ? 
  i just am not really sure how the difference between them can be that substantial , as opposed to say , the very significant difference between droop and hare with how it substantially changes the quotient . 
  you mean e.g. , not i.e. 
  ( i.e. 
  is for an exhaustive list , not just a few examples ), 
  but to add a few more examples that i 've read others have encountered : sneak attack on undead , piercing with skeletons , and everything about alignment ( in particular , things like detect good & evil ) . 
   warlocks really rely heavily on party compositions that need short rests, 
  that 's a bit of a misnomer , actually . 
  sure , warlocks benefit * a lot * if you take frequent short rests , but it 's absolutely not essential to them playing well . 
  mechanically , they play very similar to a fighter that chooses a bow , but instead of using bows and arrows , they take eldritch blast and the agonising blast invocation . 
  spells a nice for a bit of extra burst , but honestly i tend to prefer using mine in social situations and for escaping combat rather than to actually boost combat capability . 
  wow , this is pretty much the perfect image of a cleric in my mind . 
  nearly exactly what i pictured when reading about the cleric near the end of [ stranded ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) . 
  i mean , let 's be honest , it does n't really matter either way . 
  either way , it 's within the same order of magnitude , and they 're about a ** million ** times out from reality ( and that 's if you interpret the `` e '' in `` yec '' literally , as opposed to referring to the universe ) . 
   you ca n't really believe that living in a trump run america will be worse than living in a 3rd world country ? 
  i doubt many people think that . 
  i 'm sure a lot of people would say that as a rhetorical statement , but not many people would sincerely believe it . 
  but even so , a trump run america would very much be worse off than canada , the uk , or australia , under each of their current governments . 
  i was thinking rapiers , or \u00e9p\u00e9es , or something like that . 
  i 'm guessing same reasoning applies as with knives ? 
  it definitely was n't in young justice . 
  on that show , it was implied that reading minds is a totally normal thing that martians do all the time , and m'gann had to learn not to do it automatically with people on earth . 
  i 'm not sure the wording * is * clear . 
  all it says is that it ca n't be less than 16 regardless of armour type . 
  i can definitely see why people would think that a shield should be added on top of that . 
  not to mention , from a purely logical point of view , something titled `` barkskin '' sounds like it would affect your body , and that any ac gained from away from your body , such as from a shield , or from dual wield , would still be added on top of that . 
  honestly , i doubt it 's anything nearly as rigorous as that . 
  they probably just roughly gauge what 's popular by looking at it .
