  a perfect reason not to buy an iphone ( although i do n't know of any major games that actually exist on both windows and any mobile platform , be it windows phone , android , or ios ) . 
  even mac os , which recently has been getting more and more games , is still a long way behind windows ( and linux a distant third ) . 
  do n't discount it as `` more of an opinion '' , it * is * important in your decision making process , so it 's an important point in your reasoning . 
  but again , it 's a reason not to * buy * their products , and not one to * hate * apple for . 
  i feel 5 is your best point with regards to `` hating '' apple 's philosophy . 
  but even this i think is more of a reason to dislike the products than the company . 
  with regards to your first point , actually it * is n't * a mark against microsoft itself with regards to windows . 
  only with regards to microsoft hardware like the xbox and their new surface tablets . 
  of course , many of the manufacturers that put windows on their computers , as well as much of the internal hardware , is made in these conditions , but it is possible not to go around this and buy a computer that runs windows and is entirely ( or at least mostly ) sweatshop-free . 
  in summary , it seems to me that you dislike apple products more than you hate the company apple itself . 
  that , to me , is a perfectly reasonable attitude to take , because there are serious disadvantages to each of apple 's products compared to their competitors , just like the reverse is true . 
   this came to a reasonable conclusion rather than most discussions on reddit, 
  haha , so very true . 
  in a similar vein , have you seen the original the office , and how do you think it compared to the american version ? 
  edit : saw below that you said you have seen and love the english version . 
  i 'd still like to ask how exactly you think it compares to the american version . 
  i 've also never seen an episode of the american version . 
  i have , however , seen the entire original . 
  part of the reason i have n't seen any of the american is that i do n't want to ruin it . 
  i 'm having trouble finding it . 
  the [ version for clarinet solo and concert band ] ( http://youtu.be/5lpsqykdduo ) is of course easy to find . 
  i 've managed to find [ this rather interesting version ] ( http://youtu.be/x17pr2pqtwg ) for two clarinets and orchestra . 
  best i could do for one clarinet and orchestra is [ this scene from british tv show skins ] ( http://youtu.be/izvo_w1hg88 ) , which i 'll admit is what i was thinking of in my last comment . 
  i agree with the overall premise of this , but who the hell considers indians `` white '' ? 
  i 've need heard of any asians -- east , south , or middle-eastern -- referred to as white . 
  i , on the other hand , was expecting arbitrary and random colours . 
  lots of bright vibrant colours that look completely out of place . 
  i thought he was one of them digimon . 
  i 'd put myself somewhere between casual and hardcore gamer , but i 've never played a zelda game . 
  i still know the difference ... 
  yeah i agree . 
  their prices are definitely higher in aus than the us , but no where near as bad as some companies are . 
   most laypeople did not consider them to be white people, 
  the key point . 
  yes i realise caucasian , while synonymous with `` white '' ( europeans and those of european descent ) in everyday language , does not actually equal white . 
  the point is i have never seen a person use white to refer to south asians like indians . 
   i 'm surprised he made a decent video using finalcut x. i heard version 10 was equivalent to windows movie maker since they removed a ton of critical features found in previous versions, 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  when fcp x first came out it was still miles better than any amateur programme , and indeed mostly useable for professionals , though it lacked some key features . 
  however , since then there have been a number of updates and all the key missing features have been reinstated . 
  edit : in relation to the credits thing at the end , he could have recorded the raw video on windows as normal ( in bootcamp or a different computer ) and then done the editing on the mac . 
  like the other guy said , the complete 9th symphony . 
  sure it 's an hour long , but this is the guy 's first time hearing * anything * . 
  it 's one of the greatest pieces of music ever written . 
  as long as it 's andras schiff 's version , i agree !, 
  should n't take the first movement too slow . 
  ah thanks . 
  i thought it was the appassionata but i was n't sure . 
  i 'm not so good at the specific numbers . 
  please do n't call it fate . 
  that 's got to be the worst of all the subtitles to any piece of classical music ever . 
  nevertheless , beethoven 's symphony no . 
  5 is definitely an ** amazing ** piece of music , and a great choice . 
  the whole thing , too , not just the famous first movement ( though being deaf he wo n't have heard the `` famous '' first movement , so even that would be great ) . 
  just a tip , if you ever want sheet music to classical music , you should go to the [ international music score library project \\ ( imslp \\ ) ] ( http://imslp.org/wiki ) . 
  but yeah , it 's definitely an incredibly tough piece . 
  that said , if you 're someone who does n't know much about piano music , [ even fairly easy piano music can look terrifying ] ( http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/e/ee/imslp243128-pmlp01410-beethoven__ludwig_van-werke_breitkopf_kalmus_band_20_b131_op_13_scan.pdf ) . 
  or portable speakers !, 
  yes that 's a great one !, 
  i 'd also recommend the complete planets , or at the very least mars and jupiter , in that order . 
  i found [ this particular comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/11j0zq/i_was_born_completely_deaf_22_years_ago_today_i/c6mw7q1 ) absolutely hilarious !, 
  beethoven wrote a whole heap of piano sonatas with different numbers . 
  a few of them have names , too . 
  for example number 14 is the famous `` moonlight '' sonata , and this one here , number 23 is called `` appassionata '' . 
  i know the appassionata sonata , but i did n't remember that it was number 23 . 
  worth noting that these names were not given by beethoven himself , so how valid they are varies ( moonlight , for example , is actually a terrible name with no bearing on what beethoven was thinking ) . 
  thanks for the work , though , all the youtube links are really great , and should be a huge help to people that want to find the pieces everyone 's talking about . 
  yeah , you 're so much better off [ watching it on youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hujagb7hl0e ) . 
  ah yeah , good point then . 
  [ looks like you are n't the first to suggest it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/11j0zq/i_was_born_completely_deaf_22_years_ago_today_i/c6n21i0 ) , but it did n't get much attention . 
  i 've heard this same analogy in relation to blind people before . 
  what i want to know is , how accurate is it for people who * lose * their sense of hearing/sight later in life ? 
  if you 're born seeing , but someone pokes out both your eyes , do you experience sight as being blackness , or does the entire sense disappear the same as it would in someone blind from birth ? 
  haha yeah definitely . 
  it was for me , too . 
  the key is classical vs classical . 
  upper case classical refers to the classical era , as you described between the death of bach and the middle of beethoven ( often his 3rd symphony ) . 
  lower case classical refers to the generic umbrella that would more technically be called the common practice period . 
  yep , the thumb is up for the camera . 
  haha what ? 
  we usually grab them by all four limbs , grab electronics out of their pockets while they 're hanging there , and then chuck them in . 
  sure it takes a large team of people , but it 's just as fun , maybe even more so . 
  [ bight ] ( http://www.flemmingbojensen.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/bight-map.jpg ), 
  you mean first movement ? 
  but i have seen people use the word fate to refer to symphony no . 
  5 , in the same way path\u00e9tique is used to refer to piano sonata no . 
  8 , or pastoral is used to refer to symphony no . 
  the difference with these names is that while many commonly accepted names like path\u00e9tique and appassionata are names not given by beethoven , fate is a term that is thankfully not too commonly used , because it 's a terribly inappropriate one . 
  while there is a claim by beethoven 's secretary anton schindler that beethoven himself said `` thus fate knocks at the door !, 
  '' , schindler is believed by many to have offered a romanticised view of beethoven 's life , and his testimony is not considered very reliable . 
  i do n't like the `` moonlight '' title of piano sonata no . 
  14 , either , for the same reason . 
  it 's a title that has no resemblance to what beethoven actually thought of when he was writing it , and indeed going by that title one will interpret the piece incredibly differently to its intended meaning . 
  the difference with that is that the title moonlight is known and used by everyone now , so the two are completely linked . 
  the same can thankfully not be said of symphony no . 
  5 and `` fate '' . 
  i 'm not deaf , and never have been . 
  i just thought that this particular thread was one that would interest this subreddit , because a lot of the top suggestions have been classical music . 
  the second movement is a really lovely slow movement . 
  starts out with cello melody .
