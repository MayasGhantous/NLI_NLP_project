  this is wizards of the coast we 're talking about , after all . 
  they 're not exactly known for being masters when it comes to use of technology . 
  ( but more than that , i 'm just not sure it 's worth the effort of maintaining such a rigid formal system for something like this . ), 
  infinitely recursive subthreading and sorting by some function of votes is what makes reddit work as well as it does , while forums die out . 
   you filthy mac user, 
  it 's like that on os x , too . 
  i could n't imagine them possibly using cold , anyway . 
  he 's one of the * very * few non-speedster villains that is , at least in my mind , inextricably linked with the flash . 
  like what they did with jerome and the joker , in a way ? 
  that 's a cool theory . 
  i like it . 
   laptops get hot . 
  keep them on a hard flat surface, 
  this is a really good point , and one that 's so easy to handle . 
  do n't put them on your lap , or your bed , or a pillow , or anything like that , at least while gaming or doing other intensive tasks ( video editing comes to mind ) . 
  i use a thin bit of wood -- a semi-portable chess board -- to rest my laptop on when i 'm gaming on it . 
  really simple and effective . 
  obviously with a higher budget you could get one of those laptop rests with a fan . 
  if you need to plug in a projector , you need to carry extra stuff around * anyway * . 
  a thunderbolt to vga adaptor . 
  not that it 's a super bad thing . 
  they can be bought * really * cheaply , and it 's not something most of us probably do very frequently anyway . 
  just thought i 'd point it out . 
  that really depends . 
  do you consider the piano an orchestral instrument ? 
  or a harp ? 
  i played beta and absolutely loved it . 
  bought the game ( over $ 100 -- yay australia ) and kept a subscription for a few months before life got in the way and i could n't justify the subscription when i was playing so infrequently . 
  and then when it went free , i just never got around to getting back in the game . 
  i 've been trying for the past couple of weeks , but network problems have prevented that , and customer support has been slow this week for weather reasons . 
  so i ca n't comment on how the game has changed since launch * yet * , but i 'm looking forward to seeing what 's different . 
   i dont blame them, 
  i do . 
  it 's a * beta * . 
  if those problems were persisting past launch , * then * i would n't blame them . 
  but if you entirely write off a game because its beta is buggy , that 's * your * mistake . 
  haha these are some absolutely awesome magic items !, 
   professional map makers hate him !, 
  but seriously , every one of these items are wicked cool . 
  oh god , these magic items are great !, 
  i was going to say `` especially x '' , but frankly i ca n't narrow it down to my favourite one . 
  i ca n't even narrow it down to three , there 's just too much awesome . 
  yeah , i knew misnomer was the wrong word , but my mind was blanking on the correct one , so i stuck with it . 
  thanks for that . 
  side note . 
  those things are gross as fuck . 
  i wish i had n't googled that . 
  edit : actually , misconception still is n't quite the right word , on second thought . 
  my intent was to convey the idea that a cursory look at the class will lead to a misinterpretation , in much the same way that a true misnomer is when looking at the name of something gives you the wrong impression of what it is . 
  the word misconception , on the other hand , misses this particular nuance , and instead is more generally about people thinking that the class works in a way it does n't . 
  that 's absolutely correct . 
  and after launch , the complaints were very well justified . 
  it 's the people complaining about it prior to launch , and who used that as an excuse to write the game off entirely even before it released , who were in the wrong . 
   b is bit , b is byte, 
  exactly . 
  while we 're at it , m for mega ( 10 ^ ( 6 ) ) , m for milli ( 10 ^ ( -3 ) ) . 
  waaaay too many people use mbps when they mean mbps or even mb/s . 
  if you do n't like it , you can turn it off . 
  personally , i have found in incredibly useful . 
  for anyone interested , the piece he played was [ bach 's brandeburg concerto no . 
  2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adb5bi18iw8 ) . 
  i 'm a firm believer in last-thursdayism , and i refuse to hear any arguments to the contrary . 
  this was exactly my initial warlock build , except instead of druidcraft and vicious mockery , i had acid splash and light . 
  hell , shortly before the scag was released , the mods were allowing small screenshots/photos of individual bits of the book . 
  i remember , for example , discussing a screenshot of the variant tiefling options based on an image taken from the book . 
  no , they were quite explicit in saying that small sections like the one i described were permissible . 
  the [ international association of time travelers ] ( http://www.abyssapexzine.com/wikihistory/ ) , for one . 
  i do n't think martians have laser eyes or x ray vision . 
  and they 're terrified of/vulnerable to fire . 
  so i think we can be confident that kara is the real supergirl . 
  so , i only know m'gann from young justice , but in that show , the power dynamics on mars were reversed . 
  the white martians were repressed ( more like apartheid or jim crow , rather than hitler style extermination , though we were n't given much in the way of specifics ) by the greens , who thought then dangerous savages . 
  that was an important part of m'gann 's character development . 
  it could probably be done with this different backstory . 
  hell , it might even work out better in the end . 
  but it would have to be very masterfully handled . 
  i definitely do not think that the white martian we 've already met could possibly be her . 
  it would completely defeat the purpose of her character . 
  i do hope that they introduce mm , and i hope they do it well . 
  she was my favourite character on yj . 
  but i 'm not sure that they will . 
  to whoever reported this , automod is not `` overzealous of new posters '' , it 's doing exactly what we want it to do . 
  we 've been getting a lot of spam lately , and all of it has been completely new accounts . 
  very few legitimate users are brand new accounts , so it 's a worthwhile trade off . 
  in most cases , we catch the legitimate ones and get them reinstated within a few hours . 
  that 's better than having a few hours in which spam links are getting clicks . 
  goliath we already have . 
  but i agree , i would * love * to see shardminds make a return . 
  deva we * kinda * have in the form of aasimar . 
  i 'm not actually exactly sure how similar the two are . 
  mul i 'm just not familiar with . 
  and yeah , psionics is the biggest obvious missing piece , and i 'm looking forward to that making a return as well . 
  i really liked what they had so far with the unearthed arcana . 
  the attack vs. int score is a really interesting mechanic and it fits perfectly with my idea of a psion . 
  the other things i 'd like to see , though for now i 'm happy with the homebrew options available , are things from the 4th edition heroes of shadow . 
  in particular , the vryloka race ( [ homebrew available here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/3tp1bm/vryloka_race_v5_final/ ) ) and the vampire class ( [ available here as a prestige class ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/3qnv6q/vampire_prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big/ ) ) . 
  in fact , to some extent , i 'm so happy with how these homebrews look that i almost hope they * do n't * do something official , if only because i 'm worried it would be less interesting than these are . 
  there 's already a really good [ unofficial homebrew race guide ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1viqlsen67mmd2lo_oj-h5yx0fccsfi97kfaqx7v1dmw/pub ) . 
  it 's definitely not perfect , and there are a few glaring problems with it , but it 's still * very * good . 
  i 'm sure wizards could come up with something better if they tried , and i hope they do , but for now , this is great .
