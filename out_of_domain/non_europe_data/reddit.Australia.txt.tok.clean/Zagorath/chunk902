  edit : never mind on the alphabetical order thing , looks like it 's deliberately sorted by level of canonicity first . 
  with that in mind , i would suggest moving the dmg races to directly below the phb races , and the ee races below that , with the ua races at the bottom . 
  any dm that does n't allow those now , but * would * allow them just because they 're released in a different book , is a shitty dm . 
  spells are the biggest one imo . 
  having to have both the mm and the phb open just to see the basic abilities of a spellcasting monster is a massive pain . 
  i sorta do this . 
  for me , it 's imperial for anything specifically referencing game mechanics , and metric for everything else . 
  for example , i 'll mention that hex has a range of 90 feet , but when discussing whether or not a target would notice that they had a spell cast on them , i 'll say `` the caster is nearly 30 metres away from the target , in the middle of combat '' . 
  the game mechanics require the use of 17th century units , but that does n't mean we have to hinder ourselves when discussing the game in a more general sense . 
  exactly this . 
  any time a character says `` i will not do this '' or `` i will always do this '' is just ** screaming ** for an opportunity to test their boundaries , and to introduce some internal conflict . 
  force them to make a tough choice : live up to their ideals , to the detriment of something else , or give up their ideals in this one specific circumstance for the greater good ( or for personal gain , either works ) . 
   unfortunately in the cw dc universe , the martians are basically extinct with the exception of j'onn j'onzz, 
  we do n't know anything about the cwverse . 
  supergirl is n't a part of that universe . 
  ( yet . 
  i 'm still holding out hope for some multiversal shenanigans to bring the shows together in the future . ), 
  except it is n't a part of the same universe . 
  they * ca n't * be , because if they were ( that is to say , if they * already * were ) it would have significant negative impacts on the characters of both supergirl and the flash . 
  supergirl is the second ever superhero in her universe . 
  that 's an important part of who she is . 
  she 's part way between standing in the shadows of a great figure , and paving her own path as the second hero there is . 
  the flash was the * first * true * super * hero in his universe , and that was something he had to deal with . 
  never mind that from a logical standpoint it would n't have made sense for them to have always shared a universe , since there 's been not one mention of superman in the cwverse , despite him being such an incredibly huge and significant figure . 
  people were * surprised * when they saw super powers coming into existence in the cwverse . 
  in a world where superman exists , that does n't make sense . 
   6-8 encounters with 2-3 short rests per day is balanced for short rest vs long rest classes . 
  the classes were designed around that assumption, 
  yes , but it was a faulty assumption . 
  most parties do substantially less than that , which leaves warlocks and other short-rest based classes in the lurch . 
  `` the full xp for that encounter '' is a meaningless statement in general . 
  how much is that ? 
  xp in combat is given related to the cr of the creature , but if an npc was * designed * to be overcome through non-combat means , they 're not going to have a cr , or if they do , it 'll be far lower than the difficulty of actually overcoming the challenge was . 
  it works in this case , since they 're overcoming what would have been a combat encounter , but in the more general sense , it 's not helpful . 
  what 's raw regarding cover when there 's an enemy or ally in between you and the guy shooting at you ? 
  ( my group just ignores it completely , unfortunately , so it 's one area that i 'm not read up on . ), 
  could you perhaps say that small creatures get one extra size of cover ? 
  that is , if having an ally between you and an enemy shooting at you grants half cover , then if you 're small and the ally is medium , perhaps you could get three-quarters cover ? 
  or is that something also already covered in the rules ? 
  lucky is * okay * , but i do n't think it 's great . 
  it shifts the average d20 roll from 10.5 up to 11 ( using a simplified model where we just assume you never roll a 1 on the second reroll -- in actual fact it 's not quite that good ) , but that 's really all it does . 
   at least give me two shields to choose from, 
  a buckler would be nice , but i 'm not sure about adding any other types of shields . 
  hahaha , i 'm * totally * with you on the cantrips . 
  warlock + pact of the tome + magic initiate is amazing . 
  having prestidigitation , thaumaturgy , light , and minor illusion is awesome for some spellcasting flavour , and you 've still got a couple of cantrips left over after that !, 
  but , i think i may have done a poor job of conveying my point with hex . 
  since you only need to cast it once , they means that if you get 4 slots in a day ( 2 per rest , one rest ) , only * one * of them ends up needing to be hex , which leaves you with more spare slots . 
  but i 'm not sure i see how warlocks get the same benefit from short days as full casters . 
  if you 've got two encounters and you 're fully rested for both of them , as a warlock you get 4 spells all up ( and if one of those encounters is a relatively low threat one , where the spells just are n't necessary and eb is easily enough , well then you 're left with just 2 that can actually be of any use in combat ) . 
  the wizard , on the other hand , gets to dole it out as necessary , and since the warlock is balanced around being fresh thrice per day , having less rests than that puts her below the curve . 
  and i 'm totally with you as far as sheer number of higher level ( 5 ) spell slots goes . 
  warlocks kill in that respect . 
  the problem is , as i noted in a kind of tacked-on way at the end of the last comment , that you do n't get that * on top of * a bunch of low level stuff for more minor flavourful spells . 
  it means that , as a warlock , you have to think more carefully about when you use lower level spells , since who knows if you 'll need a higher one soon . 
  wizards and other casters can do it without worry , since their higher level spells are independent of their low level ones . 
  i feel like this problem would decrease substantially if warlocks gained spells just * slightly * faster . 
  like , a third at level 6 , and fifth at 14 . 
  i think that would go a * long * way , given the way most groups seem to run their adventuring days ( it would , of course , have the effect of overpowering the warlock in what is * currently * considered the `` standard '' adventuring day , but my point is that wizards should reconsider what they consider standard ) . 
   and here 's something that never comes up in these `` warlock is disappointing as a caster '' conversation : there 's no actual limit on the number of short rests you can take in a day, 
  sure , there 's no limit in the rules . 
  but for practical purposes , having less that you can use without a rest is a big limitation . 
  you ca n't even do three spells in a row until 11th level . 
  for example , throw a fireball at an enemy , before teleporting away from him , and then on the next turn turn invisible to hide . 
  regarding the limited invocations , my feeling is that they should probably be once per day with * out * costing a slot . 
  when slots are already as limited as they are , it 's just difficult to justify wasting an invocation on the * opportunity * to * spend * one of those slots occasionally . 
  yeah , i guess i can see that extra 1 ac benefit being worth it if you 're a front liner , such as a bladelock . 
  for a more arcane-oriented blaster , though , it still seems a bit of a waste of an invocation . 
  and sure , misty step can be great in combat . 
  i know i 've used it on more than a few occasions to get out of immediate danger . 
  but for the most part , my uses have been either entirely out-of-combat . 
  one time , i was stuck in a ravine with some dangerous-sounding but unknown monsters sprinting towards me along the ravine , so i high-tailed it out of there . 
  on other occasions , it has been used for things like crossing lava , escaping capture , and during combat while cornered for getting out of the corner and running . 
  it 's more of a combat spell than , say , sending , but less than something like sleep , in my mind . 
  rituals are great . 
  i just wish more spells were rituals . 
  there are a heap that feel like they should be , but are n't . 
  clairvoyance , detect evil and good and find steed , to name a few . 
   plus the rare invocations that are once a day but do n't use a slot, 
  which ones ? 
  i do n't remember there being any like that , though i wish there were . 
  and please , do n't get me wrong . 
  i ** adore ** the warlock class from a flavour standpoint , and i 'm also a big fan of it in terms of mechanics . 
  i think the system of having cantrips + spells + invocations + patron + pact boon , allowing for so much flexibility in terms of design , where most classes only get to make far fewer or smaller decisions in their builds , is really cool . 
  i think eldritch blast is actually really cool , particularly once you grab agonising and repelling blasts . 
  having spells refresh on a short rest is nice just because of how unique it is . 
  and , at least with the fiend , i really love the features you get as you level up . 
  i 'm just not a fan of just how restrictive the class 's number of spells per short rest is , combined with the way my group plays ( and , to a lesser extent , the way the * average * group seems to play , based on surveys i 've seen ) . 
  edit : to the user that 's downvoting / u/alexandraerin , if you see this i would urge you to take it back . 
  they 're making some good points and are most definitely contributing to the conversation in a positive way . 
   bard - where 's all the songs ? 
  seriously . 
  it 's called a bard . 
  honestly , this relates to one of the things that made me really dislike 5e when i first saw it . 
  instead of each class having their abilities to choose from , there 's a centralised list of `` spells '' , and each class gets a subset of these . 
  there are a few spells limited to exactly one class , but using the general model of a unified spell list , you just naturally end up with a bunch of class using the same spells . 
  in the case of warlocks , sorcerers , and wizards , this is fine . 
  it 's cool , even . 
  but it also results in things like the exact same healing spell being used by clerics , druids , and bards , which just does n't feel right to me , and you end up with , like you alluded to , most of a bard 's repertoire just being the same spells a wizard can cast , rather than a selection of truly unique bardic techniques . 
  i think the paladin is the best handled , in this respect .
