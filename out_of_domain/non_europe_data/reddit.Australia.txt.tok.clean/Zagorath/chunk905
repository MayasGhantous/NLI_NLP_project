  i would probably suggest giving disadvantage , and increasing the check dc to 20 ( to make up for the fact that disadvantage is nowhere near as bad as -10 ) . 
   or 1d6 + 1 radiant damage ( for something in between d6 and d8, 
  on average , 1d6 +1 is actually equal to 1d8 . 
  it 'll obviously never get 8 , but it never gets 1 , either . 
   you can make a wisdom ( insight ) check against your spell save dc ( wisdom ), 
  huh ? 
  that 's a ... weird way of going about things . 
  it just ... it just makes no sense . 
   you must make a wisdom saving throw or be subject to corruption . 
  you are proficient in this saving throw if you are of a good alignment . 
  you also have advantage on this saving throw . 
  does that second sentence apply only to good creatures , or to all force users ? 
   you may choose to embrace evil and immediately have the evil alignment, 
  you * may * , but also you may not ? 
  what 's the point of this ? 
  it does n't describe what happens if you * do n't * embrace evil , and it seems like the answer is nothing happens . 
  hmm , i do n't think that 's correct . 
  i just tried registering hello { { my_normal_address } } @gmail.com , and it let me . 
  and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndgreentext/comments/2dj3i7/a_na%c3%afve_but_kind_exfisherman_in_a_highly_cynical/ ) is the last time it was submitted to the subreddit . 
  unfortunately , we never got an answer to what system the game was using . 
  ah , right . 
  but i just tried registering that address , too , and it worked fine as well . 
  ninjaedit : tried sending an email to { { my_normal_address } } test@gmail.com, and i got a `` delivery to the following recipient failed permanently '' error . 
  as a side note , it 'd be really terrible if it did work that way . 
  they would n't be able to do the whole `` oh , looks like johndoe@\u2026 is taken , guess i 'll go with johndoe1990@\u2026 instead '' thing . 
  the other thing that you can do , i believe , is put full stops anywhere in your username . 
  johndoe @ is equivalent to john.doe@, which is equivalent to j.ohndo.e@, etc. 
   when three officers from brisbane central approached the players wondered if it was stumps instead the officers asked to join in and test thier skills . 
  yowza , that 's a bad bit of writing . 
  really confusing to read .

  there we go . 
  edit : you 're welcome , qps !, 
  yeah definitely . 
  it 's the `` now ** too ** '' that really does it . 
  they know what 's up . 
  on the one hand , yeah , he very obviously did , and there are quite a few well-known examples of it . 
  [ this entire video is about some such removed sections ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1klmxuer8 ) . 
  on the other hand , i 'm pretty sure they guy you replied to knows this , and only made the comment as a joke . 
   edit : well , on windows , i have to install it, 
  i was rather disappointed to find out that it does n't come pre-installed on linux . 
  or at least , on ubuntu . 
  of course , it 's super easy to get thanks to apt-get , but it 's still a lot more work than the zero that had to be done on os x. 
  personally , on windows i avoid anything programming related except for python in idle or java in eclipse . 
  i just despise windows for most programming stuff , especially if i have to go to the command line . 
  give me a nice unix-like system any day . 
  hear , hear !, 
  sigh ... 
  i mean , i 'd agree that it looks like by far the best of the dccu movies in the near future , but it 's still a part of the dccu , and that leaves me with low hopes . 
  and thomas & martha wayne . 
  i thought the same thing after deadshot 's death . 
  it just felt so perfectly like he had deliberately staged it so that he 'd go out looking like a hero , but also have a ticket out of the suicide squad . 
  it was so long ago that it never even occurred to me that the reason was because of the shitting movies meaning they were n't allowed to keep the characters around , until i came to the subreddit and read others ' comments . 
  in fact , that is still my headcanon . 
  unless we see his dead body , i 'm assuming he 's still alive and just doing stuff that does n't intersect with star city . 
   just imagine not having batman tas ( and therefore not having harley , ffs ), 
  not to mention not having the entire dcau , including justice league . 
  and hell , if it were n't for the popularity of that show , we probably would n't have ever gotten young justice , despite that being in a separate universe . 
  they 'll have done both . 
  the shots where all we saw of blonde felicity was the back of her head ( and even then , mostly just the side of her hair ) would have almost certainly been a body double . 
  shots where we see both faces obviously take more effort . 
  yeah , i actually thought they did this just as well as orphan black . 
  obviously it 's a lot easier to pull off for a few scenes in one episode than it is for the entire premise of a show , but even so , i thought it was done very well . 
  cheers , mate . 
  est is utc +10 . 
  if you 're in one of the states with stupid wibbly-wobbly time , you 'll be utc +11 right now . 
  us est is utc-5 . 
  so if you ever hear someone talking about the time in new york , that 's 15 hours behind you , or 16 if dst is in effect . 
  it 's [ 2 hours , 18 minutes from now ] ( http://www.forgottenempires.net/ ) . 
  cracked copies are easy to find if you want , but i 'm not going to help you with that . 
  you do n't * need * to back up , but before doing * any * major changes to your system , you * should * always back up . 
  in fact , you should * always * be backed up anyway . 
  but in particular , if you 're adding/removing partitions , upgrading your os , or doing anything substantial like that , it 's a great opportunity to make sure everything is backed up . 
  i 've given my partition 100 gb . 
  at the moment the only things on there are skyrim , aom , and aoe iii , and it 's got a little more space on it , but not very much . 
  bootcamp is super easy to use . 
  they walk you through the entire process . 
  you 'll need a usb with at least a few gigabytes on it , and it 'll need to be able to be completely wiped clean , but other than that , there 's nothing really you need to know or do . 
   steam will convert that to whatever your currency might be, 
  unless you 're australian , in which case fuck you , you can have localised prices for games , but we 're going to charge you in usd anyway . 
  oh , that 's very interesting . 
  i did n't know that . 
  if you want to format things as greentext , just prefix them with ''  '' . 
  for more advanced formatting , take a look at [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) . 
  you mean like the [ rune magic unearthed arcana ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_rune_magic_prestige_class.pdf ) ? 
  more than just homogenising them , it 's adding back in things that were left out of certain races for balance reasons . 
  the norse do n't get archers . 
  greeks have * very * limited healing . 
  adding options to make the races better at things they were * designed * to be bad at just feels incredibly poorly thought through . 
  i 'm more worried about greeks getting more plentiful healing , and the norse getting archers . 
  these things were left out of the original game * for a reason * . 
   well your `` dollar '' is worth less, 
  right , but completely irrelevant , since they 're charging in usd . 
  any difference in the currency is going to be reflected in the actual cost anyway . 
   your salaries are higher, 
  factually incorrect . 
  and even if it were true , irrelevant . 
  if they want to charge localised prices , they should charge it in the god damn right currency . 
  not localise prices , but charge in a foreign currency anyway .
