  the famous duh duh duh duuuuuh is in the first movement , and when people say fate that 's what they 're referring to . 
  if you 're interested , [ here 's the wikipedia article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symphony_no._5_\\ ( beethoven \\ ) #fate _ motif ) about the `` fate motif '' . 
  i was under the assumption the picture was from the person that `` posted this a couple months ago '' , and that the op 's event with spice girls was not only at a different time , but by a different person . 
  does n't ios 6 already do something like this ? 
  or was it jellybean ? 
  i do n't have either of them , and i 've watched the announcement events from both ( i.e. , wwdc and google i/o ) , so i forget which is which . 
  but one of them has a sleep mode where it 'll receive calls and texts , but wo n't make any noise unless it 's, 
  a ) from certain pre-determined people or, 
  b ) ( optionally ) the person calls you twice within a specified time period, 
  thanks !, 
  ah yes . 
  imslp says `` is thought by some scholars to be of doubtful authencity '', 
  interesting . 
  right , but the rules are that you lose once you pick up your phone . 
  if you pick it up , find it 's not from the hospital , and put it back , technically you 've lost . 
  the best method would to set a different ringtone for whomever would be the urgent caller . 
  with bach , are you referring to toccata and fugue in d minor ? 
  i thought that was the same as this one , dubious . 
  albinoni , is that adagio in g minor ? 
  because that 's honestly the only piece by him that i know . 
  i had no idea it was n't actually by him ... 
  in aus it 's the same as the uk . 
  that was like saying thank you for being successful . 
  i do n't remember where i saw it ( probably somewhere in youtube , i 'm tempted to say boogie2988 or sxephil ) , but it was the first time i really became aware of reddit . 
  damn it was confusing . 
  you seen the office ? 
  the original ? 
  short , sweet , and a brilliant ending . 
  but like someone further up said , rsr would have made a really good hbo miniseries . 
  more cinematic , less chance for cancellation . 
  yeah very good point . 
  i think you 're missing their plot . 
  diet soft drinks are designed to make you fat . 
  think about it . 
  i think i 'm interested , but could i get a little more detail on exactly what it does first ? 
  personally i think the opposite . 
  a license would mean some people * ca n't * have kids . 
  goes against the basic right to procreate . 
  a tax after 2 children means anyone can have 1 or 2 children , but are discouraged from having more . 
  they still can if they want/can afford to , but it is discouraged . 
  do you mean one child each or one per family ? 
  if the former , then i agree . 
  it would help keep population roughly steady . 
  uhh ... only if you decide not to pronounce the h in hero . 
  ( same with herb , which i 've curiously noted recently many americans seem to pronounce without the h ), 
  it used to be , but a while back they changed to . se, 
  thanks , looks really interesting . 
  i 'd definitely like to give it a go !, 
  the link you provided ( [ this one ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/narcikarma/mogaeafejjipmngijfhdjkmjomgdicdg ) ) is giving an error , though .

  i 'll send you an email with my email address at badmonkey@networkoftheapes.net, 
  might i suggest [ beethoven symphony no . 
  9 in d minor ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3217h8jppi ) , and [ symphony no . 
  5 in c minor ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fknoyswt5bm ) , since you seem to already like a lot of beethoven . 
  he 's definitely my favourite composer . 
  for mozart , you should check out his [ requiem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia8ceqidsjw ) . 
  it 's simply stunning . 
  it 's late where i am , so i 'll leave all the theory stuff to others , but i 'll be back tomorrow morning to try and fill any gaps i notice . 
  good luck with learning about this absolutely wonderful genre of music !, 
  haha i have to be honest i do n't really like mozart all that much , only his later pieces . 
  i was writing this as an edit to my last post , but since you replied already i 'll put it here :, 
  actually , i 'll give you some tips if you want to learn different instruments . 
  [ there was a thread a little while back about someone wanting to choose an instrument to play , ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/11bqvn/how_to_decide_on_an_instrument/ ) that could be worthwhile . 
  other than that , you should listen to britten 's young person 's guide to the orchestra , as others have mentioned . 
  another good idea would be to look at concertos and sonatas of each of the instruments . 
  mozart is a very good place to go for that , because he did a lot of concertos , at least one for almost every instrument . 
  [ here is his clarinet concerto ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2onnugi3ylu ) , the last piece of instrumental ( meaning non-vocal , or music for instruments as opposed to singers ) music he completed before his death . 
  just to explain some of the terms i used above :, 
  a concerto is ( usually ) a work for orchestra and soloist . 
  in classical and romantic period concertos , the orchestra and soloist each take a more or less equal role ( obviously this means the soloist has a more important role than any * individual musician * in the orchestra ) , and they 'll interplay with each other , trading themes etc. 
  a sonata is a work for piano and soloist , or just piano . 
  not to be confused with sonata form , which i 'm sure someone else will explain ( along with other forms like tertiary , rondo , etc. ) . 
  if not , i 'll go into detail about these later . 
  ok , it looks like no one else has covered form , apart from / u/scrumptiouscakes ' description of sonata form and fugue . 
  when identifying form , it 's really important to keep / u/indeedwatson 's comment about learning to identify themes in mind . 
  i 'll start with the most basic form ** binary form **, 
  you do n't actually come across binary form very much except in some early baroque music and the renaissance , but it 's important to know about because in a way it 's the building block for a lot of other forms . 
  binary , as you may know from computers , or just basic language skills , means two . 
  in binary form there are two sections , usually called a and b. 
  the second section will be distinct from the first , and usually modulates into a different key ( i 'll describe a bit about keys at the end ) . 
  pieces in a major key ( like c major ) will usually modulate to the dominant ( or 5th , which if the tonic , or original key , was c major would mean a modulation to g major ) , and pieces in a minor key usually modulate to the relative major ( the major with the same key signature . 
  the relative major of c minor is eb major for example ) . 
  pieces in a binary form often take the form of aabb , where they play the first theme , then repeat it , and then move on to the second theme , before repeating it too . 
  the next simplest form is ** ternary form **, 
  as the name suggests , this form has three parts . 
  it expands on the binary form by repeating the first theme at the end . 
  the form is usually aba , or aabba . 
  they take the first theme , then move on to a second contrasting theme , before going back to the first theme to end . 
  most minuets and scherzos use ternary form . 
  the a section is often known as the `` minuet '' , while the b section is called a `` trio '' . 
  one example of this would be [ beethoven symphony no . 
  3 , third movement ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njdqmyhbsko ) ( indeed , most symphonies ' third movements will be a minuet or a trio , although sometimes the second and third swap around ) . 
  for a really clear example where the two themes are blindingly obvious , and the transitions clear , i 'll point you to [ my own scherzo composition ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kahrgi_twuw ) . 
  ** rondo form ** , and its baroque counterpart ** ritornello **, 
  another step up in complexity , rondo form takes a single recurring theme , and adds to it various different episodes . 
  in basic terms it usually takes the form abacada ( and can continue throughout the alphabet as desired abacadeafagaha ) . 
  its relatively rare to find a perfect rondo , as composers will often reuse the episodic content sometimes , so it 's something more like abacab ` ada , ( the b ' indicates it 's b , but slightly varied ) , and will change the main theme in various ways . 
  in baroque music the ritornello form was used , which is nearly the same thing , but the main theme is referred to as the `` ritornello '' . 
  a good example is [ bach 's brandenburg concerto no. 2 , first movement ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgvnyryzkcm ) , although it 's very complicated in the ways it differs from a perfect ritornello .
