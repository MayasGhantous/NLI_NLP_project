  what exactly marks them as so terrible ? 
  oh god i hate that crop . 
  yes i 'm aware how the naming scheme works . 
  if you reread my comment i think that 's fairly clearly implied . 
  my assumption was that the difference was 6 generations , and that after many generations even the low end would beat such an old high end card . 
  someone else already pointed out why that assumption was wrong . 
  you 'll likely get better feedback on / r/unearthedarcana .

  yeah , it 's a subreddit named after the official wizards monthly article , meant for sharing homebrew stuff . 
  yeah , one of the rules for / r/unearthedarcana is that it be either 5e or system agnostic . 
  the first thing i 've noticed is that they 've completely fucked over mind thrust . 
  it 's now only within 5 ft. 
  it does 1d6 instead of 1d8 , and scales as a cantrip with character level , rather than with power points spent on it , and it 's an intelligence saving throw , rather than the really cool , unique attack roll vs. intelligence * score * that they used in the last draft . 
  i 'm really not a fan of this . 
  it seems way more like a slight variation on normal spellcasting than the truly unique source of power that psionics should be . 
  you now just get cantrips that scale with level . 
  no spending psi points to make them more powerful , which is supposed to be the core idea of the class . 
  a basic amount of free stuff , which can be increased through psi points . 
  thought spear seems to have taken over what mind thrust is supposed to be . 
  the `` thrust '' in mind thrust is n't referring to pushing them , guys ... or at least , it did n't in the last draft or in previous editions . 
  it 's referring to mentally thrusting into their mind . 
  i 'm not a fan of the name change at all . 
  it mentions that, 
   your order grants you a benefit for using its, 
  associated disciplines, 
  but i 'm not actually seeing that in this . 
  i like the idea of disciplines and focusing on them , that feels really in line with the idea of psionics . 
  but other than that , this seems to have completely missed the mark , to me . 
  the biggest problem with it is that it makes the class 's core damaging ability a saving throw . 
  players like rolling dice . 
  the core damaging abilities for every class out there so far ( spells like fire bolt for most spellcasters , eldritch blast for warlocks , even thorn whip in druids , and weapons for most other classes ) involve the player making the action and rolling an attack . 
  if it was really necessary for balance reasons , then fine , i guess . 
  it 's highly disappointing , but if it 's truly necessary , i can put up with it . 
  what i * ca n't * put up with , and what i am very * deeply * disappointed with , is them turning it into a cantrip . 
  damage or effect scaling with the amount of psi points spent on it is the entire * point * of psionics . 
  a small effect for free , and greater effects as you spend more on it . 
  that 's the psion 's unique selling point from a mechanical point of view . 
  and this is entirely missing that . 
  and what they 've turned mind thrust into is an insult . 
  the `` thrust '' is n't supposed to refer to pushing them across the battlefield , it 's thrusting into their * mind * . 
  mind thrust should be what `` thought spear '' is in this version . 
  yeah . 
  i suppose if it was necessary for balance reasons , then they have to do it . 
  way less interesting , and will make the psion ( i refuse to call it a `` mystic '' ) way less appealing to play , but they have to keep things balanced . 
  the rest of the changes , though , are inexcusable .

  i 'm not a fan of the name change at all . 
  not to mention , while i understand it may have been necessary for balance , the change from mind thrust being an attack roll vs. int to an int save is really disappointing . 
  that was an interesting unique ability , and it made more sense with the way attack rolls vs. save throws have been used in the past . 
  attack rolls are called for when the player is directly doing something to the opponent , whereas saving throws are when the player creates something that causes an effect that the targets have to react to . 
  mind thrust and thought spear very much fall in the former category , which means flavour wise they make much more sense as attack rolls . 
  it mentions that,

  but i 'm not actually seeing that in this . 
  that needs some clarification .

  ah cheers . 
  actually , i think i 've finally figured out how to put in words what my problem with this change is . 
  the attack roll made more sense with the way attack rolls vs. save throws have been used in the past . 
  attack rolls are called for when the player is directly doing something to the opponent , whereas saving throws are when the player creates something that causes an effect that the targets have to react to .

  it would basically be impossible to multiclass into . 
  or , at least , its 4th level gets a major nerf if you multiclass . 
   personally i 'd prefer if they just kept it as spellcasting, 
  oh god no no no . 
  psionics * should * be its own very unique thing very separate from spellcasting . 
  keeping it too similar to spells is the biggest problem with this draft .
