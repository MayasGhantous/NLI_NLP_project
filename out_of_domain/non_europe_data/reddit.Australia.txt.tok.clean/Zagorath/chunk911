  trying to force it into spellcasting ruins both the interesting flavour that psionics had in previous editions , and the interesting variety they provide from a mechanical standpoint . 
  ... you do n't get class ability saves when you multiclass ... 
  lame . 
  but spellcasting * is n't * all that general . 
  spells involve somatic , material , and verbal components . 
  they have spell levels . 
  and there is a clear distinction between cantrips and levelled spells . 
  psionics does n't involve components . 
  it uses psi points rather than spell levels . 
  and there * should be * ( but sadly is n't , in this draft ) blurred lines between what 's free and what 's not . 
  a good many psionic abilities should be free in some basic form , and be scalable by spending psi points on them . 
  at least to some extent , concentration ( whether it be the general idea of concentration , or the mechanic of concentration ) should be a crucial part of the class . 
  that last bit , this draft does very well . 
  you gain substantial benefits from concentrating on a discipline , and many of the discipline features require concentration . 
  though it says `` you * can * make '' . 
  flexibility is , by definition , a buff . 
  it 's probably not an unreasonable buff , but it definitely is a buff . 
   the first version , many people felt , suffered from an immense amount of limitation on what it could do at any one time . 
  you had to be focusing on a discipline to use its effects , which meant either using your bonus action to switch disciplines every turn , or be limited into using literally one effect over and over, 
  i 'm totally fine with allowing you to use abilities from a discipline you are n't focussing on . 
  that 's totally okay . 
   this way , the psionic cantrips let you have a lot more flexibility , and the ability to use discipline powers without focusing on them does as well, 
  my biggest problem is that they scale the same as spellcasting cantrips . 
  i 'm okay with them being a separate part of the progression ( in terms of having a list of them that you choose independent of your disciplines or order ) , but i do n't think they should get the automatic buffs at higher levels . 
  instead , one should be able to spend psi points at them * from the very beginning * , to increase their power . 
   this new version actually has more powers that scale with the psi points you invest, 
  but there 's * nothing * that 's free in some form , and then scales with psi points . 
  that 's what we should be seeing from psions . 
   making cantrips scale with level was necessary , otherwise psions would fall massively behind at more powerful levels, 
  fundamentally , i do not think they should have removed one of the most interesting and unique core features of psions in order to make them balance well with wizards . 
  they should have found some way to make it work with the same paradigm that they already had , rather than taking the lazy route of just copy-pasting wizard cantrips . 
   i mean , oblivion basically puts magic as a sort of secondary style, 
  i like it that way . 
  the way in skyrim you have to go through a menu to cast a different spell is annoying as hell , and makes the game really tedious to play when you 're a spellcaster . 
  the more mmo-like action bar-style system works really well , since you can then seamlessly choose which spells to use in the moment . 
  spells should n't be something that you `` equip '' like a weapon . 
  [ this video is a great watch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zuynhkal1i ) for anyone that 's a fan of the elder scrolls series . 
  it provides some really interesting insight into the differences between morrowind , oblivion , and skyrim , and what makes some better than the others , at least from a flavour/lore perspective . 
  ( not so much with mechanics . ), 
  well yeah , duh ... 
  what 's your point ? 
  yeah , i kinda like the idea of needing a free hand to cast spells . 
  that part , i 'm fine with ( though i do think that for a paladin or cleric-like character , it makes sense to be able to use one 's shield as a spellcasting focus ) . 
  my problem was that you should n't have to `` equip '' individual spells . 
  switching between fire bolt , heal , and turn undead should be seamless . 
  when i described the mmo style , i was actually referring to oblivion as it currently stands . 
  it 's been a long time since i 've played the game , but my memory of it is that it works as a sort of hybrid between the way mmos do things and the way skyrim does things . 
  i 've been playing skyrim with [ this alternate start mod ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9557/ ? ) . 
  it has a bunch of different options for where you can start , as well as a random option . 
  each of them have their own mini quests associated . 
  i think it 's really quite cool . 
  better than playing through the default start for the fortieth time , anyway . 
   the existence of the talent-cantrips scaling mean nothing, 
  huh ? 
  right , but they 've removed it as the core scaling ability of the class . 
  in the previous draft , and in previous editions , the existence of a basic damage-dealing ability that was free , but which could be scaled by spending points , was a * huge * part of the * point * . 
  they 've removed it in this draft , just to make things work more like cantrips . 
  it 's the bread and butter of the class . 
  in what world is that * not * a core mechanic ? 
  and the discipline system is fine , so i 'm not commenting on it . 
  it 's the lame cantrips that need fixing . 
   beginning at 1st level , a psion can increase the power of their cantrips by spending psi points . 
  for instance , mind thrust can have its damage increased to 2d6 by spending 5 psi points , or to 3d6 by spending 8 psi points , or 4d6 by spending 11 psi points, 
  whoa , why so expensive ? 
  try 1 psi point per increase , like the last draft did . 
  it 's easy to say that the thing makes psions underpowered when you 're making them pay way more than they should for it . 
   my main issue with what you 're saying , though , is that you 're asking them to `` find some way to make it work with the same paradigm that they already had , rather than taking the lazy route of just copy-pasting wizard cantrips , '' when you , yourself , are taking the lazy route of complaining about something without offering any input on how it could be fixed, 
  just fuck right off with that bullshit . 
  one does ** not ** need to provide a better alternative in order to critique something . 
  film critics do not themselves ( usually ) make films . 
  art critics are not generally known for their own artwork . 
  this `` you ca n't criticise unless you can do better '' bullshit that seems to be so popular on the internet needs to fucking stop . 
  you do ** not ** need to offer a solution in order to point out flaws in something . 
  besides , i * do * have a solution . 
  go back to the fucking previous draft . 
  change it to int save if you really have to ( even though that 's lame as hell ) , but keep the psi points system the same . 
  the way i see it , psions should be a class aimed around resource management . 
  they should have enough points that in a typical adventuring day , they can more or less keep up with wizards if they want to . 
  but they should be more flexible . 
  they can choose to blow all their points early on , and they 'll be really weak later on , since their powers do n't scale automatically . 
  it 's not the small stuff , though . 
  it 's the entire point of psions . 
  disciplines might be the meat , but mind thrust is the bread and butter , and it needs to be fixed , badly . 
  the discipline system is fine . 
  there might be some specific features here and there that need tweaking , but the overall system is fine . 
  my focus is * obviously * going to be on the bad bits , and that 's the cantrips . 
   if a 1st level psion can do as much damage as a 5th level wizard by spending a single psi point , that 's broken, 
  only because you 're comparing a limited resource to an unlimited one . 
  it 's not broken at all . 
  you ca n't compare them like that . 
   now ... calm down . 
  seriously , there 's no need to do the textual equivalent of shouting, 
  i 'm sorry , but i can not possibly express how much i * detest * the argument that you were making , and its incredible popularity on the internet as a means to try to cheaply shut down any debate . 
  it 's a horribly anti-intellectual argument to make , and i really am * not * interested in engaging in discussion with someone who tries to use it . 
  and you 're still trying to use that argument . 
  i am interested in mechanics , and i take offense at your presumption otherwise . 
  if i were n't , we would n't be having this conversation . 
  but i 'm not going to build my own mechanics just because an official playtesting class is badly built currently . 
   the previous draft was slightly more balanced because you could only use one discipline 's powers at a time, 
  if the previous iteration only worked because of the limitations on disciplines , then i think they should go back to that .
