  in fact , i 'm now wondering if perhaps the reply to the comment you linked might have been where i first came across the schiff lecture . 
  i know it ca n't have been much more than four years ago that i came across it , so that post is around the right timeframe . 
  yeah , platypodes and echidnas , as members of the order monotremata ( commonly known as monotremes ) , are mammals that lay eggs . 
  what i do n't get is why you 're pointing that out in reply to the above comment . 
  it looks like it belongs in reply to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/43uryq/weird_question/czl2l6y ) further down the thread . 
  that 's exactly it . 
  my suggestion would be to take a longsword and reflavour it as a small glaive . 
  then you can wield it with a shield in your off hand if you want , but you also have the flexibility of going two-handed with it for more power , if you want to . 
  if you do that , i 'd go fighter for class . 
  battlemaster seems a cool fit for someone that 's doing cool tricks with a polearm , but champion works as well . 
  yeah that makes sense . 
  [ link ] ( https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/modifying-classes ), 
  wow ... 
  i feel like every time i learn something new about al , it just gets lamer and lamer . 
   the head mod also limits what parties exists and keeps an eye on their subreddits, 
  this really needs to be spun off as its own question . 
  / u/krispykremeguy covered the difference between a celestial warlock with a deity as the patron and a cleric fairly well . 
  but i think the far more important difference is that a celestial warlock * is n't * normally going to pact with a deity . 
  the standard fiend warlock does n't pact with asmodeus or glasya . 
  it 's more common to form a pact with a lesser devil , or even a cambion . 
  and similarly , most celestial warlocks would be pacting with lesser celestials . 
  devas , solars , and the like can all easily be the patron for warlocks . 
  my best guess is that it ties in with number 3 . 
  yeah definitely . 
  the piece is meant to be in 2/2 . 
  two minums per bar , not 4 crotchets . 
  too many people play it as 4 crotchets . 
  the above recordings are definitely faster , when you consider that [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tr0otuiquu ) , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey4n8vqlx_o ) , or even [ this monstrosity ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqveaihwwck ) are more like the `` normal '' way the piece is played , gould 's performance is positively brisk . 
  and if you listen to the gould recording , you can clearly tell that his pulse is in 2 . 
  perhaps his off beats ( that is , the second crotchet of each minum beat ) is a little stronger than it should be , but it 's a lot better than most recordings . 
  i particularly like [ mozart 's oboe quartet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wotus1vzwys ) . 
  it 's probably my favourite solo work for the instrument . 
  [ vaughan williams ' oboe concerto is also really nice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p0tarkqpbe ) . 
  but for me , the oboe stands out the most within an orchestra , when it gets smaller solo moments . 
  for example , i absolutely love the oboe in [ the recapitulation of beethoven 's symphony no . 
  5 's first movement ] ( https://youtu.be/4t3d5q6eq2w?t=284 ) . 
  from the linked time up until 5:14 , its held chords in the background are absolutely sublime , and obviously the solo at 4:55 is incredible . 
  the opening to [ swan lake ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-yvvty7abc ) is beautiful . 
  i also love its little interludes during the funeral march of [ mahler 's symphony no . 
  1 , mvt 3 ] ( https://youtu.be/u5a5tfyxqio?t=83 ) . 
  and this one 's cor anglais , not oboe , but [ the fourth movement the pines of rome ] ( https://youtu.be/pmexzqtfncy?t=76 ) has a brilliant and incredibly haunting solo for the instrument . 
  i 've heard americans talk about that one a lot , and i 've always thought `` huh , no way such a stupid las applies here '' . 
  guess i was wrong ... 
  hmm , that 's rather interesting . 
  i was mostly basing my thoughts on the schiff lecture . 
  i do n't suppose you have a source that 's a bit more authoritative than the abrsm forums for this ? 
  i want to believe it , as it 's a very believable idea , but something a bit more substantial would be nice . 
   `` quarter notes '' ? 
  what is this , a maths class ? 
  seriously , wtf dude ? 
  [ that 's an absolute wonderful recording . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/7x0qwnb5lsc ) the piece is my absolute favourite . 
  i do n't care how clich\u00e9 that is , or how well-known the piece is , it 's an absolute masterwork . 
  i can not stand it when people take that first movement too slow , especially the opening 5 bars . 
  dude does n't suggest government income comes from anywhere . 
  imagine a libertarian . 
  now imagine they 're even more retarded in their political beliefs . 
  now you have an ancap . 
  anarcho-capitalist . 
  this guy wants * no * government at all . 
  they somehow honestly believe that the country could survive -- and would even be * better off * -- with everything including all of education , medicine , and emergency services provided entirely by the private sector . 
  yeah , tenors are typically written in octave treble clef . 
  it sounds an octave lower than written . 
  altos and sopranos both use the normal treble clef , and basses use the bass clef . 
  when all four parts are reduced onto two staves , the bass and tenor share a bass clef , and altos and sops share the treble . 
  funny , when you said `` obvious answer '' , the first thing my mind went to was die gro\u00dfe fuge . 
  but the britten is a great piece , too !, 
  yeah , i 'm fairly certain demigods is just a story , not something that ever happened . 
  i ca n't even imagine what sort of system would be used to make that happen . 
  another really long one is [ stranded ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2o99zp/unsuspecting _ modernday_humans_enter_a_portal_and / ) , which is probably my favourite story that 's ever been shared here . 
  but it does n't even work under the guise of being an actual game that happened . 
  it 's pure story . 
  there are a few other really long ones , some of which are a bit more believable as game sessions , which you can find [ on our hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , under the `` longer '' section . 
  [ here 's a working link of it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grgw25dslmm ) . 
  [ video link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkt8t38aamw ) . 
  thanks !, 
  ca n't wait to read it . 
  for what it 's worth , the syntax is [ square brackets first \\ ] ( https://then.normal.brackets.with.the.link.com ), 
   you have two charges , which you may power into a single ranged spell attack or break them up into separate ranged spell attacks, 
  are you determined to have it work like this ? 
  why not have it work like scorching ray or eldritch blast , and simply say that you can fire them at targets within range , and that you can fire them at one target or multiple , and * each * blast has its own attack roll . 
  wow , that is an amazing piece !, 
  really beautiful . 
  but star city has just as much consonance as central city does ... 
   constitution has even fewer uses than strength, 
  does it , though ? 
  con is valuable to some extent for * every * character , since it impacts your health . 
  it 's also one of the `` strong '' saves , along with dex and wis , having quite a lot of built-in features which require a save . 
  strength is useful for melee oriented characters in combat , a tiny amount of non-combat activities , and that 's about it . 
  that . 
  amazing . 
  point 4 is super important . 
  ( both of the point 4s . ), 
  practise the whole thing with a friend !, 
  hop on skype , meet up in person , whatever . 
  have them select a poem for you , do the full preparation time , commentary , and questioning process . 
  then when it 's over , get them to give you feedback . 
  then you do the same for them . 
  you should benefit from this practise on * both * sides of the table . 
  doing it yourself will obviously show you your own flaws and let you know where you need improvement , but acting as the examiner can help you get in the * mind * of the examiner for when you do the real thing , so you 're better able to know what sorts of things you should cover in your initial commentary , and how to respond to questions .
