  it 's all about practise , practise , practise !, 
  i was lucky enough that a poem i practised the night before my real ioc is the one i ended up selecting in the real thing , so it was practically a breeze . 
  i actually think that might have been removed or something . 
  i remember seeing it when it was posted , but i 'm going back to search for it again and i ca n't find it . 
  wow , i had never heard any of those before . 
  the donizetti is absolutely lovely . 
  the video that went with it was ... a bit odd ... but that does n't change how lovely the piece is . 
  i think i might have a new favourite work for solo oboe . 
  the sullivan symphony was a nice fun little piece , and i really liked the bit early on in iolanthe overture with the clarinet and oboe duet , but i 've got ta be honest my favourite bit of that piece was some of the brassy bits . 
  listening to the strauss currently . 
  pretty nice so far . 
  here 's the description for material components , phb .203, 
   a character can use a ** component pouch ** ... in place of the components specified for a spell . 
  but if a cost is indicated for a component , a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell . 
   if a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell , the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell . 
  find familiar requires, 
   10 gp worth of charcoal , incense , and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier . 
  what this means is that a character needs to find a brass brazier once , and must also supply 10 gp worth of charcoal , incense , and herbs , for * each * casting of the spell . 
  because there is a cost indicated , a character can not use a component pouch to handwave away automatically having the components . 
  i would say that if they obtain the components themselves , they can * store * them in a component pouch ( the charcoal , incense , and herbs , that is , not the brazier ) , but it does n't come pre-included with the pouch . 
  now , arguably , a player could also make their own charcoal or find their own herbs , though it would be up to a dm to decide how much that 's worth per unit time spent looking for it ( based additionally on their location , and possibly some ability checks ) . 
  some groups like to handwave all of that and just have the player pay gold out of their money pouch each time they cast it , other groups prefer to require the foresight to gather components ahead of time . 
  neither side is inherently better than the other . 
  one other point worth noting is that jeremy crawford [ has stated that obtaining the brass brazier is not important ] ( http://www.sageadvice.eu/2015/07/30/find-familiar-component/ ) . 
  they just need to be burned in some kind of brazier , which could be interpreted to mean a makeshift wooden or cheap iron bowl could also be accepted . 
  races generally have a +1 and a +2 to their skills . 
  not always , but that 's the general rule . 
  in 5e , you should * strongly * avoid anything that mentions alignment . 
  it is * extremely * against the design ethos of this edition . 
  an ability like unholy presence should be altered to something like `` on any creature that is not a fiend or undead '' , or something like that . 
  you should also specify how often this ability can be used . 
  once per long rest ? 
  free invisibility is insane . 
  if you 're giving it something like that , it needs to be limited somehow . 
  all of your dcs are way too high . 
  an animal handling check of 20 is * super * high for an ability caused by your race . 
  and a perception requirement of 25 is just laughably bad design . 
  and , for what it 's worth , that 's `` wisdom ( perception ) '' , not `` wisdom save '' . 
  it does n't make sense for a saving throw to be used to see something invisible . 
  to make this a viable race , you 're going to have to make some * major * changes . 
  and you 're going to have to recognise right off the bat , * you will need to make compromises * . 
  something that really closely resembles the nazg\u00fbl from the novel or films is just going to be too powerful . 
  also , i would suggest posting on / r/unearthedarcana . 
  you 'll get far better feedback in general over there than you would here . 
  for now , stick to the arcane forge megathread , but once you 've got something a little more viable , submit it as a post . 
  that 's what i gathered , too . 
  i was just trying to be as complete as possible , for the general case . 
  for op , the important bit is at the bottom : word of god is that you do n't actually need a brass brazier . 
  conventional wisdom says that a puzzle like this , which will mostly need to be solved out of character , should not be used in a way that blocks progress . 
  instead , it should generally be used as a sort of side option . 
  now , your group might feel differently , and that 's totally okay , but in general i agree with the conventional wisdom in this case . 
  in my last campaign , the dm did something that i thought was really cool . 
  he gave my character a few high level spell scrolls as a reward for a quest . 
  the catch was , they were encrypted . 
  so before i could use the scrolls in-game , i had to decypher them out of game . 
  the first of the three was the easiest . 
  i solved it before the end of the session in which we got it . 
  it was a string of text scrambled up , and a riddle . 
  the answer to the riddle was the decryption key for the cypher , which turned out to be a vigen\u00e8re cypher . 
  the second was far harder . 
  i did n't solve it , someone else in my group did . 
  but it was a variation on a [ pig pen cypher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pigpen_cipher ) that used hexes instead of grids . 
  the third , [ we still have n't * quite * solved ] ( http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/24626/unknown-transposition-cypher-puzzle ) . 
  i had to use some in-character knowledge ( taking the scroll to a wizarding school and asking the archmagister to look at it ) to get a hint to solving it , and we 're still not quite all the way there . 
  my general opinion regarding the issue of whether one character could solve it or not , is that a character with high intelligence , like 16 or over , is probably smarter than any of the * players * at the table . 
  so to even out things a little , i say allow absolutely anyone to work together out of character to solve it , even if in character you end up saying your smartest character is the one that figured it out . 
  it 's similar to out-of-character strategising in combat . 
  sure , your characters would n't have time to talk and yell out their plans in the middle of combat , but there 's also the fact that in their downtime , your characters are probably talking with each other and learning how each other behave . 
  this is n't acted out around the table . 
  allowing players to talk about their strategy during combat is sort of simulating the fact that they would get to know one another very well just by adventuring with each other . 
   # wall of fire, 
   these are slightly vague , but i 'd say the dimensions are pretty much implying it 's just a straight wall, 
  i do n't necessarily agree . 
  to me , the fact that you can choose to make it circular -- and that if you do so , its total length ( the circumference of the circle ) is nearly identical to the length you could create otherwise -- implies that any shape you like can be created . 
  that said , your argument regarding `` the exception that proves the rule '' with wind wall is fairly convincing . 
  this seems like an area that could do with some clarification . 
  someone want to tweet crawford ? 
  have you tried photoshop ? 
  it seems like the best bet . 
  first of all , you mean hyperbolous , not metaphorical . 
  and secondly , the way you 've used it there is ... not a great example of literally being used in that way . 
  i dunno , that 's the best i would come up with . 
  it 's pretty terrible . 
  retcons are one of the worst , laziest pieces of writing . 
  they 've got multiple great ways to get supergirl in the same universe as the arrowverse , there 's no need for them to resort to something as lazy and half-arsed as just retconning it to say `` oh yeah they were always in the same universe '' . 
  i fail to see how `` pee dee oh '' sounds very much like `` pee doe '' . 
  it 's certainly a substantial enough difference that i never would have reached the conclusion if it had n't been pointed out as explicitly as these comments . 
  [ this one ] ( http://youtu.be/m6iezwgotcc ) is working for me when the op one was blocked . 
   gay gygax, 
  now we know the * real * reason fundies were so opposed to d&d !, 
  my favourite is a bit of a clich\u00e9 , but it 's the [ mozart concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_gm0ncabps ) . 
  it 's the most well known solo work for the instrument , but in my opinion that 's for a good reason . 
  also up there is [ weber 's concertino ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sr9oxnm66by ) , and [ krommer 's concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfe3qea9y_a ) , which is an absolutely beautiful piece . 
  for something a little less well known , [ brahms has a really nice clarinet quintet ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nijytozuhaw ) , and [ beethoven has a nice piano trio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua8kafasvhe ) . 
  and there 's a piece called [ croon song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kylielgxv9i ) , by william hurstone . 
  the well-known piece by rachmaninoff , vocalise , has been transcribed for just about every instrument out there . 
  now , i might be biased , as a clarinetist myself , but the clarinet version of it [ is my absolute favourite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9szfzoslrek ) . 
  for some non-clarinet solo works that * feature * clarinet nicely , probably the most obvious is [ rhapsody in blue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch2ph0autuu ) , but again , it 's famous for a reason . 
  and by god are those opening few bars fun to play !, 
  i also really like the bit right near the beginning of [ grieg 's piano concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1cmsixbsss ) where the clarinets and bassoons play a small solo .
