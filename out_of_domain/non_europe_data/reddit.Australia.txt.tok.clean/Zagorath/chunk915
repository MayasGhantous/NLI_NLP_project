  i could go on and on with my favourite of these little excerpts , but i 'll stop myself there . 
  i like your idea in theory , but unfortunately it is n't canonically correct . 
  wizards does n't * ever * capitalise their race or class names , except when otherwise dictated by the sentence . 
  ~ ~ spells are capitalised , ~ ~ class * features * are capitalised , but the classes themselves are not . 
  one thing i wondered when looking at lost mines was `` where does that water at the back of the mine go '' ? 
  i have n't actually read abyss , and i 'm not super familiar with how the underdark works , but there would have to be an `` entrance '' , so to speak , from the land to the underdark , right ? 
  perhaps the water at the back of the cave acts as an underwater entrance to the underdark . 
  [ x ^ ( -1 / 2 ) , the reciprocal ( or multiplicative inverse ) of a square root ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fast_inverse_square_root ) . 
  ah , so they are . 
  the way this is framed at first makes it look like an adult tiger sitting on a * giant * tiger . 
  it 's why i do n't blame hayden christensen at all . 
  his part was so poorly written that i do n't think * anyone * could have pulled it off convincingly . 
  though back on topic , i actually think rickards did a * fantastic * job in today 's episode . 
  it took me back to why i loved her character when she was first introduced , but also was some great character development for her , and set up what could be an interesting plot line going forward . 
  it 's worse on desktop . 
  does n't even seem to * try * to load the thing . 
   sorry for the inconvenience , but there 's an error with your location . 
  our diligent code monkeys have received this error , and if they are unable to fix it , they will be ... dealt with . 
  is all i get . 
  also , this :, 
   \u00a9 copyright < % = datetime.now.year %  game informer magazine, 
  nice , guys . 
  looks like your jsp is n't executing correctly ... 
  surely spelling would be intelligence ... 
  which bit do you not understand ? 
  i thought it was all rather simple . 
  ah yeah , that makes sense . 
  indeed they are , but the concertino is by far my favourite of them , and the post was already long enough without including too many pieces by the same composer !, 
  oh man , the liszt bits were absolutely lovely . 
  very brief , but truly sublime while they lasted ( and built into very nice moments with other instruments , too ) . 
  i 've never been very familiar with bernstein as a composer ( huge fan of him as a conductor and a musicologist ) , so thanks for introducing me to that piece . 
  the first movement especially was great . 
  but the poulenc . 
  wow . 
  that was amazing . 
  it has so much of what made me first fall in love with the instrument . 
  those beautiful dark singing melodies are just amazing . 
  and the performer in the link you gave did a particularly awesome job of getting that dark tone out even in the altissimo register . 
  i ca n't believe i had n't heard it before . 
   making the build much more viable for gish-types, 
  and for rogues who take a level of fighter , letting them get both attacks in ( for an extra opportunity at their sneak attack ) and still disengage and get away . 
   the opening of [ salome ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ildwhas43sy ), 
  oh yes , i just had a listen to that , and it was very nice . 
   [ non pi\u00f9 di fiori from la clemenza di tito ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewazx9jhqas ), 
  never really been a fan of mozart operas ( or operas in general , to be honest ) , but i did like the clarinet part in this . 
  the part in '' [ parto , parto , ma tu ben mio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dakx21earkk ) '' was nice , too . 
  mozart really seems to love his basset horn and basset clarinet parts though , does n't he ? 
   the solo in [ tchaik 6 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydqcicsutpi ), 
  oh god yes !, 
  how could i have left that one off though i 'll definitely be mentioning the opening of that symphony as one of my favourite moments for bassoon tomorrow . 
  i 'd be interested to see some more numbers-focused people give their advice , but my tendency would be to say no . 
  rogues can already get two attempts at sneak attack if they want , they just have to sacrifice their opportunity to safely get away to do so . 
  the only way it * might * get op is if they take enough levels in a different class to get extra attack , since now instead of increasing by 1 , it doubles the number of opportunities they get . 
  but in that case , they 've sacrificed so many rogue levels that their sneak attack dice are going to be way fewer than they would be in a straight rogue , so it 's probably still okay . 
  they 're trading damage amount for reliability . 
  the biggest problem with that is that the feedback seems to mostly be that this is well balanced as a fighting style . 
  feats should generally be worth quite a bit more . 
  of course , you could probably add something on to this base to make it more viable as a feat . 
   i do n't roll for race or class , nor do i roll the stats in order when rolling stats, 
  neither do i , but i 've long been quite tempted to do so . 
  never roll for class , but for race and stats in order , and * maybe * background . 
  then pick a class that a character of that upbringing might go with . 
  could be fun . 
  i kinda agree with this sentiment , to be honest . 
  point buy is a little * too * fixed for me . 
  my general method is 4d6 drop lowest , 6 times . 
  if the total modifier is not between roughly +2 and +5 , on the lower end you * can * reroll if you want , and on the higher end you * must * reroll . 
  exceptions are given for some other cases though . 
  for example all 12s , despite having a mod of +6 , would be an optional reroll . 
  four 12s and two 10s , despite being in the legal range , also allows a reroll . 
  the idea behind this is that you end up with a balanced party , so no one will feel too weak or too strong , but the distribution can be varied . 
  some players might get a 16 -- 18 and the rest around 8 -- 11 , some might get a few 10s and a few 14s , etc. 
  with point buy , it feels way more difficult to justify anything other than a 15 in your main stat ( and it annoys me to no end that 15 is the max , when 4d6 drop lowest has a roughly 15 % chance on each roll of getting that , which means a nearly 2/3 chance of at least one score reaching 16 or higher when you roll 6 stats ) , 13 -- 15 in your secondary stat , and 10s and 8s in the rest . 
  it 's rather stale , and makes for a more natural tendency towards min/maxing rather than roleplaying . 
  i see it as a happy medium between the overly gamey point buy and the unfair/unbalanced straight rolling . 
  how do you handle it if a player suspects there might be something hidden in the room and wants to search for it ? 
  i think you may have misunderstood what / u/crunchybits11 was trying to say . 
  the new twf seems to have no benefit compared to * no * fighting style , apart from freeing up your bonus action . 
  ( which , personally , i think is probably enough of a benefit on its own in many cases . ), 
  unless you 're from a few areas in the us , it 's a herb . 
  most people pronounce the h in herb . 
  i agree with trumoi regarding spiked weapons . 
  the spell is a bit weird , though . 
  i do n't think there are any existing races that get a single levelled spell . 
  the examples i can think of get either just a cantrip or a cantrip plus a progression of 2nd level and 3rd level spell . 
  and to be honest , i think this race would benefit from the same . 
  it seems a little lacking in features as-is . 
  my problem with point buy is that it strongly incentivises min/maxing . 
  even as a player who normally is more than happy to make suboptimal choices , * not * minmaxing with point buy just feels like i 'm doing something wrong . 
  it also , in 5e , stupidly makes it impossible to start with a 16 in anything , which is lame as hell . 
  i much prefer rolling within certain bounds ( and rerolling if it 's too weak or too strong -- completely negates the imbalanced party issue , which imo is the only * real * issue with rolling ) . 
  it makes for a much more interesting variety in characters that way , with some being more heavily specialised than others . 
  it gives the possibility of starting with massive 17s or 18s , as well as horrible 5s and 6s that you get to roleplay with , but you could also have a really flat character with a 14 , a few 12s , and some 10s . 
  characters that are either impossible or just do n't happen with point buy . 
  plus , for whatever psychological reason , i feel way more comfortable assigning my starting 17 to int even though my character is a warlock when i rolled that 17 , than i would with point buying a higher int than cha on the same character . 
  i wonder , how do you feel about revivify ? 
  it 's technically a resurrection spell , but is easy to flavour as just an intense healing spell , bringing someone back from the point of otherwise certain death , on account of its extremely limited window of opportunity . 
  actually if they 're decapitated , revivify does n't work raw , so yay for realism . 
   the `` adventuring day '', 
  like it or not ( i certainly do * not * ) , the game is balanced around this .
