  if your adventures are n't roughly in line with the standard adventuring day of ( going from memory here , might be somewhat off ) 6-8 encounters with two short rests , some people * will * begin to feel underpowered , while others become overpowered . 
  warlocks suffer the most for this , in my opinion , but any short rest based class will lose out if you 're doing something like 2 encounters per day , no short rest , while in such a scenario , wizards and other long rest based characters will feel * very * strong . 
  of course , the problem comes when you force the `` standard '' adventuring day into situations where they do n't make sense -- like nearly any possible adventure you could come up with that is n't a boring pure dungeon crawl -- which results in good balance , but games that narratively do n't make sense . 
  what 's my conclusion in all this rambling ? 
  do n't have one . 
  just run your game how you like . 
  it 's going to have a problem with either narrative or mechanics , there 's really not much you can do to avoid that . 
  flight is cool , it 's fun , and it 's way overrated in terms of balance . 
  ranged attackers are * easy * to come by . 
  in the 5e starter set , i think the * only * encounter that did n't have ranged stuff was with the ash zombies . 
  and a character that 's flying is * going * to make themselves an obvious prime target for * all * the archers . 
  it also gives you a great reason to use nets , which are otherwise lame as hell . 
   whenever we have a situation where one of the core features of the experience must suffer in exchange for balance, 
  but there 's the rub . 
  a big part of the problem with balance in * this * particular issue is that bad balance is going to make the game less enjoyable for some players . 
  while the wizard gets over half a dozen spells per day , the warlock gets just 2 per short rest . 
  that means that in a game that 's substantially removed from the standard adventuring day , like the one described above , the warlock feels far less useful or interesting in combat than the wizard does . 
  not all balance issues cause this specific problem , which is why i think it 's such a huge design flaw that wizards balanced the game around such an unrealistic adventuring day . 
  easiest way : create a new score , set it up with a clarinet and bb clarinet , use the right key signatures , time signatures , etc. 
  write it out on the a clarinet . 
  when you 're done , copy and paste the results onto the bb clarinet . 
  now you 're done !, 
  no need to create a new score . 
  just hit `` i '' ( keyboard shortcut to add more instruments ) , add a bb clarinet , and copy paste it within the same score . 
   i feel i would lose less *** net fun *** for my group by allowing imbalance , than by sacrificing something else like *** pace *** , *** variety *** or *** context *** in order to preserve balance . 
  that 's totally fine . 
  i actually agree with that sentiment . 
  but it is worth being aware of the consequences of it . 
  just remember , if you 're writing prose like this , you absolutely do not need to format it using greentext . 
  you can just write it out as normal text . 
  it would probably look nicer if you did . 
   how they hell do you explain a damned devilspawn or a red dragon bastard child peacefully living alongside panicky `` normal '' villagers ? 
  you do n't . 
  that 's exactly why they 're perfect player races . 
  they 're forced into adventuring , bounty hunting , acting as guards for travelling caravans , etc. , because they are n't accepted within villages . 
  besides , dragonborn would be more accepted than half-orcs would be , since they 're at least known for being honourable and not destructive . 
  tieflings would definitely be less popular , but people do n't tend to just attack them or shoo them away immediately . 
  they would , however , be * highly * wary around them . 
  one 's a curiosity , two 's a conspiracy , three 's a curse , as they say . 
  one 's a curiosity , not a threat . 
  i would * highly * suggest reading ( or listening to -- i know how you can get two books free on audible if you 've not used it before , if you want ) brimstone angels , by erin m. evans . 
  it 's the book from which the racial quote comes from for tieflings . 
  and the third book in the series is where the dragonborn entry comes from . 
  two of the main characters are tieflings , and another major one is a dragonborn . 
  i think they do a very good job of showing how the average villager tends to react to tieflings and dragonborn , as well as just being really fantastic books in their own right , with a decent story and some brilliant character development . 
  you trust your players not to metagame . 
  if you ca n't trust them , are they really people you want to be gaming with , anyway ? 
   realism . 
  why ?!, 
  this is d&d !, 
  because realism makes things feel * real * . 
  there are some situations in which sacrificing realism makes sense , but a general attempt to apply realism makes sense to me . 
  my group actually just ignores the cover that results from firing into melee . 
  but i have a feeling that if we * did * use it , we would * also * use the optional dmg rules for potentially hitting allies , because it does n't make sense that you would account for the cover but not the chance of hitting the thing providing cover . 
  we also use flanking just because it makes no fucking sense * not * to , from a realism standpoint . 
  i 've been trying to convince my party to stop using it because it 's so much easier than everything else that provides advantage , and to swap it with a small +1 or +2 static bonus ( because still , realism is important , and surrounding an enemy should provide an advantage ) , but that just somehow devolved into an argument about the merits of stacking advantages and disadvantages ... 
   custom magic items , because the dmg 's ones are boring !, 
  i agree !, 
  custom magic items are great . 
  i 've been given a couple of really awesome custom ones in my recent campaigns . 
  but the dmg 's ones are not boring . 
  sure , a plain +1 sword is dull , but plenty of other ones are cool . 
  i would * kill * to get my hands on a rod of the pact keeper , even if it was a custom +0 one ( the official ones are +1 , +2 , or +3 ) . 
  plenty of other ones are cool , too . 
  just turning to a random page , pipes of haunting look like they could be really cool , especially for a bard with a darker bent . 
   pre-determined points is clearly superior !, 
  eww gods no . 
  the standard array is the * worst * possible option , because now you end up with every character having exactly the same distribution . 
  you can never have a character that 's a true jack of all trades , or one who truly specialises in one thing . 
  point buy might * tend * to create this problem , but it does n't * force * the problem on you , at least . 
  rolling within certain bounds ( rerolling if too strong or too weak ) gets you the best result . 
   tucker 's kobolds is an excuse for dms to meta-game and use traps !, 
  tucker 's kobolds are just the way kobolds should be run . 
  they 're tricksy little buggers that would n't want to involve themselves in a direct confrontation . 
  you do n't have to tailor them specifically to the party , and thus do n't have to metagame . 
  they do n't have to be `` an excuse '' to use traps , they 're a place where traps would be commonplace because that 's what makes the most sense . 
  everything else , i agree with . 
  no , i think [ this one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/448oqu/in_a_reversal_crawford_confirms_that_cutting/czocq5o ) is . 
   the thing you have to remember with crawford 's tweets , is that they 're just his opinion, 
  nope . 
  crawford 's tweets * are * the rules . 
  anything he says is the * official * rules and the way the game is supposed to be run . 
  any dm can always choose to change things that they do n't like , but the default assumption as that his word is law , just as much as anything in the phb is law . 
  evil characters are great , as long as their players are semi-competent . 
  you do n't have to be a super genius at roleplaying to play an evil character well , you just have to not be a dick . 
  evil people do n't just go around stealing and destroying everything in sight . 
  they can love , and get attached to things , and can work together . 
  my current character did n't start out evil , but turned that way over the course of the campaign . 
  but she would * never * betray the party because she cares about them too much , having worked with them for so long . 
  even pvp can work well , in more careful situations . 
  i had a situation once where throughout the campaign , one of the other players was subtly planning things to ultimately betray us . 
  after a while , i caught on , and the rest of us started trying to scheme to stop the other character 's scheming . 
  it all culminated in a final session , after we had defeated the bbeg , where we had pvp which ended in the evil character escaping . 
  that character 's player became the dm for the next campaign , and his old character was a villain in that campaign . 
  the party really enjoyed the first campaign for the intrigue of plotting and scheming trying to undo the other side 's work . 
  that aspect of it was actually far more engaging than the main plot was . 
  but this aspect * does * rely on a group that enjoys the intrigue , and can be a bit subtle about things . 
  in my group 's case , it worked . 
  that campaign i mentioned with pvp was the first for most of us , though the dm had had a little more experience , i believe . 
  but i think we got really lucky .
