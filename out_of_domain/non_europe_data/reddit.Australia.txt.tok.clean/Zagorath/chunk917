  in general i would agree . 
  it 's best avoided for first-time players . 
  i think he * did * know . 
  i reckon the whole of the last episode was him specifically wanting to test her out . 
  + / u/rollme, 
  reminds me a bit of penalty shots like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytfc7yi9mrm ) is soccer . 
  but itunes has always been terrible . 
  it 's probably the most obvious example to point to in order to argue * against * the idea that apple software has been declining in quality . 
   those that do n't think itunes is a problem, 
  those exist ? 
  hey , sorry i took so long to approve this . 
  it seems to have gotten caught in reddit 's automatic spam filter ( not our subreddit 's automod settings ) , which does n't automatically send a report . 
  i suspect it 's because reddit does n't like the sites you linked to there for the images . 
  i 'll be honest , i 'm not very familiar with the bassoon 's solo repertoire . 
  pretty much the only pieces i 'm familiar with are the [ mozart concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnqexxhek98 ) and the [ mozart sonata for bassoon and cello ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzfqcane5ui ) . 
  i love the concerto , but to be honest i 'm not a huge fan of the concerto . 
  but i do love some of the orchestral moments the bassoon has . 
  the opening to [ le sacre du printemps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ujoagihg7a ) is just amazing , one of my top five openings to any piece , probably . 
  the opening to [ tchaikovsky 's 6th ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydqcicsutpi ) is another great moment . 
  a slightly weird one , but i am absolutely in love with the bassoon 's countermelody during the recapitulation of the 1st movement of [ beethoven 's symphony no . 
  5 ] ( https://youtu.be/7jh-e5m01wy?t=4m48s ) ( 4:48 ) . 
  it 's actually one of the things i look for when deciding how much i like the recording of that piece . 
  edit : another thing i like to listen for is whether the bassoon or horn is used at the start of the second theme in the recapitulation . 
  i think i tend to prefer the bassoon at that moment . 
  similarly , there 's a really nice bassoon countermelody in the [ 4th movement of beethoven 's symphony no . 
  9 ] ( https://youtu.be/xet17yeuj5k?t=3m9s ) . 
  back with some more obvious ones , there are some great little solos in [ rimsky-korsakov 's sheherezade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhv78zlt3ke ) and [ stravinsky 's firebird ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceipm_blsta ) . 
  much like the flute , i feel this is an instrument that honestly is n't that great in completely solo works like sonatas and concertos , but when it has briefer solos within a greater ensemble , like most of the above examples , it absolutely shines . 
  even as a more experienced player , i often like to start out new characters all the way from the beginning , even if their progression is very fast at first , just so you get to roleplay the character 's experience of going from a total beginner to someone fairly competent at what they 're doing . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtacjdn3k9m ) . 
  i had not heard that before , but listening to it now ( just finished the second movement ) , i really like it . 
  far more than the mozart works i was already familiar with . 
  oh god yes , that 's a fantastic moment !, 
  i must be honest , i 'm not as familiar with the differences between french and german ( or english , american , or whatever ) bassoonists as i am with clarinets , horns , or trumpets . 
  edit : really do love the use of bassoon in the shostakovich , though . 
  haha yeah , really fun moment . 
  side note , i really like barenboim 's decision there to have the 1st and 2nd violins sit opposite one another . 
  makes their little call and response bits right after the bassoon solo , and even more at around 34:00 , much more impactful and interesting than they already were . 
  [ here 's a working link of it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyti5g0fj-e ) . 
  [ here 's a working link of that first one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upyn0s4vsvo ) . 
  and yeah , that 's a really fun bit of bassoon writing !, 
  [ his clarinet sonata ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vxkocxa3su ) is a fantastic work for the instrument , and the [ oboe one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jdhuuceehu ) is n't half bad either . 
  so i mean , i guess he got all the * important * wind instruments done . 
  haha i was kinda hoping that with a category called dragons , age of mythology : tales of the dragon would be on sale . 
  but i guess with an expansion that 's just barely reached a week old , that was probably too much to wish for . 
  at least the base game is on sale , i suppose . 
  oh man , it 's been way too long since i 've listened to mozart 's requiem . 
  yes , that opening is absolutely chilling . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agtippyh6zi ), 
  another one that i 've never heard of before . 
  a really beautiful piece , albeit one that i feel was probably misnamed . 
  it 's really more of a concertino than a concerto . 
  at least from that link . 
  definitely one of my favourites in this thread though . 
  oh , another one that i ca n't believe i forgot . 
  [ paul dukas 's the sorcerer 's apprentice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emsxdkun1gu ) . 
  super clich\u00e9 , but hey , it 's a fun piece , so why not ? 
  from about 2:00 in that recording . 
  oh no , i 've already got it for myself and it 's way worth it . 
  heaps of fun . 
  just needs a little work an balance and a few bugs here and there , but definitely playable and very fun . 
  my quandary is with buying it as a gift . 
  and also just a matter if it being interesting to note such a recent game with dragon in the title , set in china , during what is i believe the first steam lunar new year sale . 
  looks a bit like minas morgul . 
   it 's from wotc , but it 's still considered homebrew . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's considered playtesting or beta for official material . 
  it 's a step above homebrew , but below official content . 
  the general answer is it depends on the game . 
  but most games in the last five or so years , if they 're released on steam for both os x and windows , will be cross-platform multi-player compatible . 
  the more specific answer is that gta v has n't , as far as i can tell , been released for os x , so you 'll need to install windows through bootcamp if you want to play it on your mac . 
   official rulings on how to interpret unclear rules are made, 
  in sage advice . 
  the public statements of the d&d team , or, 
  anyone else at wizards of the coast , are not official rulings ;, 
  they are advice . 
  one exception : the game 's rules manager ,, 
  but i think you may be right insofar as him using phrases like `` the intent is '' . 
  those might be able to be taken as a deliberate attempt to * not * be taken as a clarification on raw . 
  hahaha yeah i can imagine . 
  all those fast notes that need to be tongued so sharply . 
  i 'm not sure i could pull it off on the clarinet , and it 's a way easier instrument to do sharp tonguing on . 
  i feel like this post is almost cheating , just because there are so many amazing works for horn . 
  you can basically throw your media player on shuffle and find a piece with an amazing horn solo in it , and there are concertos and sonatas galore . 
  i 'll get probably the most obvious one out of the way , and leave the rest for others . 
  mozart 's horn concertos are all lovely pieces , but probably the best in my opinion of them is [ the 4th ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xelnrsn3jx8 ) . 
  and within larger works , there are so many amazing horn solos all over the place . 
  mahler , stravinsky , tchaikovsky , you name the composer , there 's probably an awesome horn solo in one of their works . 
  but again i 'm going to limit myself to a few of my favourites from just one composer , beethoven . 
  my favourite moments are in symphonies nos . 
  3 ( quite a few moments in the first movement , but my favourite is [ when the horn restates the main theme of the first movement two bars before the rest of the orchestra enters ] ( https://youtu.be/t3x1-whz6oy?t=8m20s ) ) , [ 5 ( introducing the second theme in the exposition ) ] ( https://youtu.be/6z4kk7rwjmk?t=51s ) , and [ 6 ( taking over from the clarinets with the shepherd 's theme at the start of the 5th movement ) ] ( https://youtu.be/t2vy33vxnrq?t=34m57s ) . 
  oh , and everything from john williams ever . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdvpty25omg ), 
   notturno from mendelssohn 's a midsummer night 's dream, 
  [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlsj06lghei ), 
  it 's funny , i 've always thought of using cover bonuses in this way , but it just never occurred to me that you could do the same thing with advantage and disadvantage . 
   i can show you the world ... 
  hey !, 
  that 's not for bassoon , it 's for baritone and soprano . 
  but anyway , thanks for all those links .
