  i particularly liked the bordeau . 
  and i had no idea the bassoon was capable of the sort of pitch bending in that steinmtz . 
  absolutely amazing !, 
  something i would normally only expect on clarinet and saxophone . 
  the third movement was particularly beautiful . 
  unfortunately , the davis link does n't work , and i ca n't find any other versions of it online . 
  oh no , the problem is n't your link , it 's with youtube . 
   # this video is not available . 
   sorry about that . 
  ysk that `` worse '' is a term used when comparing one thing to another , and that `` worst '' is the term when referring to something 's absolute place within its category . 
  probably , but not * necessarily * . 
  my bank only allows 8 character passwords ( though thankfully they at least tell you this up front rather than doing it silently ) , but they are using proper secure techniques server-side . 
  the limit is n't for technical reasons , it 's just to cut down on support needs from stupid users who ca n't remember their password . 
  and they cut you off from your account entirely ( requiring out of band verification over the phone to reset your password ) for just three consecutive mistakes . 
  obviously vulnerable to social engineering , but it 's still relatively decent security . 
  tl ; dr password limits are * usually * indicative of unhashed passwords , but they are n't * always * . 
  wait , there was an update after the initial story ? 
  link ? 
  some developers from the bank came to talk in one of my software engineering classes . 
  ever since studying it in high school , i 've absolutely loved [ bach 's brandenburg concerto no . 
  2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haranlw9esg ) . 
  it 's for a number of `` solo '' instruments , but i 've always felt that the trumpet was the star of the first movement . 
  [ haydn 's trumpet concerto ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuzyovw7moc ) is the only true solo work for the instrument that i 've seen live , but it 's a true beauty . 
  the opening to [ mahler 's symphony no . 
  5 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipte0gdlsr4 ) is truly one of the greatest openings to any work there is , a brilliant trumpet solo , and the trumpet reappears throughout the movement with that same theme . 
  and there are plenty of cool moments for trumpet in [ el sal\u00f3n m\u00e9xico ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69uvfyh1lke ) . 
  ooooh yes !, 
  this is something i know about !, 
  you 've covered pretty much everything , so i 'll just try and give a brief interpretation of a few bits . 
  the serpent is an interesting instrument . 
  it 's part of a family known as cornett ( with * two * `` t `` s , not to be confused with the cornet with one `` t '' , which is part of the trumpet family ) . 
  cornetts are basically woodwind instruments with brass mouthpieces . 
  [ really quite interesting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornett ) . 
  the serpent is the bass instrument of the family . 
  all the brass instruments , the trumpets and horns , of the baroque and earlier times ( which includes , importantly , the standard medieval which is the setting of most fantasy ) are valveless . 
  this means that they can only play the harmonic series . 
  if you 've ever heard military trumpet calls , such as the last post ( at any remembrance day event , for example ) , those are the [ harmonic series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n3qmb6ad_0 ) . 
  that basically means that in low notes , they can only play the basic notes of the chord , c , g , and e . as they get higher , they can play more melodic parts . 
  the shawm is an ancestor to the modern oboe . 
  also worth considering is the [ chalumeau ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voepko1wjvo ) , the ancestor to the modern clarinet . 
  it is perhaps a bit anachronistic in a medieval setting though , having come about in the late renaissance . 
  related to the shawm and oboe , in being a dual-reed instrument , is something you 've probably heard a thousand times , but probably never heard * about * , an armenian folk instrument called the [ duduk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihi5u_es1dc ) . 
  it 's been used in countless film and television scores , largely for its highly foreign sound and the somewhat ancient or reminiscent timbre it gives off . 
  got ta be honest , my favourites are the well known ones . 
  [ rhapsody in blue ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch2ph0autuu ) ( because what sort of clarinetist would i be if i * did n't * love it just for the opening few bars !? 
  ) , [ el sal\u00f3n m\u00e9xico ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69uvfyh1lke ) ( ever since we studied it in high school ) , and the like . 
  also who thought it was a good idea to make a string instrument where the strings are out of order ? 
  i 've got ta be honest , i 'm not a fan of singing in general . 
  i just tend to prefer purely instrumental works . 
  i love the instrument in an orchestra , but i have yet to hear a flute solo work ( concerto , sonata , or something like that ) that i liked at all . 
  it just has a timbre that works great in smaller doses as colour within the orchestra , but not on its own . 
  not necessarily . 
  the average roll if you roll twice the dice is going to be * slightly higher * than the max roll of a single roll of the dice , with the potential to be much higher . 
  oh shoot yeah , that * would * be dangerous . 
  this is super important . 
  riddles and puzzles should generally * not * be things that block progress . 
  they should either be unrelated to plot progress , or there should be other alternate paths to success in the plot . 
  the best example i 've had in a game was when we were given some encrypted spell scrolls as a reward . 
  they were encrypted , so to cast them as scrolls we first had to decrypt them . 
  the key to the first one was the answer to a riddle :, 
   she comes sometimes at need . 
   but never on your lead . 
   to meet with her is jolly . 
   to push her may be folly . 
  first thought is : wow , this is an awesome map, 
  second thought is : hehehe , i recognise those brushes !, 
  i used many of the same ones in [ my world map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bp3dw01.jpg ) , though it 's harder to tell with the trees because i applied them in really ugly ways . 
  i really like the design of this . 
  it seems very believable , with none of the really obvious traps a lot of people fall into like diverging rivers . 
  you even got what looks like really believable river mouths going . 
  can i ask you a few questions about it ? 
  on the technical , where did you get the texture you 've used for the ocean ? 
  i really like it . 
  and how did you do the roads ? 
  at least , i think they 're roads -- the darkish greyish lines connecting many of the cities . 
  from a lore perspective , could you tell us about randgrith ? 
  that large hex marked out on the map seems ominous . 
  if you 're security conscious , you should really be using a password manager with long pseudo-randomly generated passwords anyway . 
  personally , that 's what i use the vast majority of the time . 
  a few low-security things , and/or things for which a password manager is infeasible ( like my password to log on to university computers ) use a password that i remember , but even that 's over 10 characters . 
  i 'm wondering , where are you located ? 
  i would assume it works far better for americans than it does for me in australia , but i never get * any * while i 'm overseas in sea ( where i spend about a quarter of the year ) . 
  i 've also heard women get far more surveys/money from surveys than men do . 
  or you 're located somewhere that is n't as well supported , or the places you go are n't places google is interested in/being paid to give out surveys for , or you 're in a demographic that companies are less interested in , or any number of other possible factors . 
  you just reminded me of another ( entirely unrelated , except for the name ) piece by an american composer that i played once in concert band , [ appalachian morning ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1tx0h0bmuk ) , by robert sheldon . 
  i assume you 're excluding upright pizz bass from that last part ? 
  how is it * possibly * not terrible ? 
  their different versions seem to be awkwardly related on some occasions , but unrelated on others . 
  i could n't buy the kindle book on the . com account , because it was tied to my . com.au address , but all my audible books so far are tied to . com . 
  i am now forever going to have a split library of audible books , because the first few are all on the . com , and going forward will be . com.au . 
  amazon * recognises that they are one account * . 
  it just refuses to actually treat them like one account for the purposes of using the damn service . 
  `` that 's how it works '' is a really terrible argument . 
  lots of things are * designed * to work in ways that are bad . 
  `` that 's how it works '' could be applied to first past the post voting in the us or uk , to slavery in the 1700s , to marriage equality ( or lack thereof , rather ) , or to any other number of ways that things are or were done but should n't be or have been . 
  no , not quite . 
  sorry , nope . 
   how to generate an equally distributed random number : ` ( int ) ( 900 * math.random ( ) ) ` . 
  ( do n't use modulo for distributing , that 's bad ) . 
  considering the app he 's already managed to make , i think it 's safe to assume he already knows this .
