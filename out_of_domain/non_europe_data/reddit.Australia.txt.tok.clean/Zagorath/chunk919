  hell , i know this and i 've never developed shit . 
  but i 'm curious , why the disclaimer about modulus ? 
  i mean , i know why it would be bad ( you 'd end up with a non-uniform distribution ) , but i * do n't * get why one would even be tempted to use modulus for generating random numbers . 
  i 'm sorry i do n't remember * exactly * where i got them from , or even if the ones in question all came from the same source . 
  i got all my brushes from googling things like `` fantasy photoshop brushes '' and `` cartography photoshop brushes '' , and then clicking on various results -- i think all the ones i ended up using , including the ones you can see in the op , were from deciantart . 
  yeah i 've got ta be honest , the story was the * only * reason i kept going in portal 2 . 
  i got bored with the game 's mechanics pretty quickly and was never a fan of the goos , but the story was awesome and engaging . 
  well it 's not terrible . 
  sometimes we even end up on the qps website !, 
  yeah , that 's me . 
  i go to youtube.com , and then instinctively immediately reach for the `` subscriptions '' button with only the briefest glance at the stuff on the actual front page . 
  imo the best way to do things is to approximate doubling . 
  use `` money values '' just like most currency . 
  1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , etc. 
  basically { 1 , 2 , 5 } \u00d7 10 ^ ( n ) , \u2c6f n \u2208 \u2115 . 
  in the wake of copy announcing it 's shutting down soon , some extra space on the next best cloud storage solution is much appreciated . 
  i took ib music for examination in may 2012 , yes . 
  you ? 
  [ here 's a listicle ] ( http://www.csoonline.com/article/2358750/data-protection/data-protection-big-screen-con-artists-7-great-movies-about-social-engineering.html ) of movies with social engineering . 
  the only one of them i 've seen is catch me if you can , which is a fantastic film and features quite a lot of rather clever social engineering . 
  in general , you 'll probably find it in most films about cons , grifting , or heists . 
  since this is / r/classicalmusic , and not / r/soundtracks , [ here 's an example of one of his concert works ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdrianwmazu ) . 
  mage armour can be used in combination with a shield , so max ac st level 2 is actually 18 . 
  by the way , where did you get 17 ? 
  it 's 13 + dex , and max dex is 17 , which is +3 . 
  so 16 it should be , by my reckoning . 
  i agree . 
  across the stars is one of the best love themes of all time . 
  of * all time * . 
  shame it was wasted on an onscreen romance that was so poorly written ... 
  and anakin 's thme was just genius . 
  edit : though i will say , i think there 's a * lot * of potential in the new films ' scores . 
  one movie is n't enough to rank it properly , but i think there 's a good chance that if williams sees it through , it will surpass the prequels . 
  oh right , yeah . 
  i musta misread that . 
  but i 'm fairly sure shields do n't count as armour . 
  abilities that do n't work with armour * or * a shield generally say so , for example the monk 's unarmoured defence . 
  of course , the question then becomes : where did they get a shield ? 
  neither wizards nor sorcerers have the option to get a shield as part of their starting equipment , so unless one of the other players gave it to them , or the dm made it available to be found or purchased ( in which case the dm would obviously already * know * about it ) , they should n't have one . 
   wizards can as stated spend money on copying new spells into their spell book, 
  warlocks of the tome , also , if they have the right invocation . 
  only ritual spells , though . 
  my understanding was that the general consensus was that player options tied to adventures and campaign settings were * exactly * what people wanted . 
  people saying they just do n't want * any * new content are frankly people that i do n't give two shits about , and neither should wizards . 
  those people can just continue sticking to the core books and nothing else , easy enough . 
  for the rest of us , we want more content , it 's just a matter of making sure the content makes sense thematically , and remains well-balanced with the existing options . 
  both of those are possible with semiannual releases to coincide with new adventures . 
  getting nothing at all , especially since it 's the first time out of the realms , is * really * disappointing . 
  i want to see a return of the vryloka race , a playable vampire class/prestige class . 
  those would go perfectly with a vampire-themed campaign , as would fighter or paladin archetypes focused around slaying undead , or so many other possibilities . 
  sure , there are really good [ homebrew ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3tp1bm/vryloka _ race_v5_final / ) [ options ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3qnv6q/vampire _ prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big / ) for many of these things , but official stuff would be really great to see . 
  i think you go a bit too far with this , but at its heart i agree . 
  this post rubbed me the wrong way , but i did n't comment because i could n't directly explain why . 
  but you 've basically put into words my feelings . 
  rule 1 is the worst of them , in my opinion . 
  if someone has created something bad , they deserve to know . 
  there 's no point in staying quiet just to preserve their feelings . 
  do n't attack the * person * , of course , under any circumstances , but if the thing they 've made is bad you should ** not ** feel bad for telling them so . 
  you should , though , make every attempt to tell them * why * . 
  do n't just say `` this is terrible '' or `` this is op '' , but actually go into detail about why that is , preferably with comparisons to existing official material or high quality similar homebrews . 
  it 's okay if you do n't put a super amount of effort in to the review , particularly if it seems there was very little effort put in to making the content , but at the very least `` this is overpowered , compare it { { this } } and { { this } } '' are okay . 
  rule 5 would be massively problematic , but it does say that it 's a guideline rather than a rule . 
  the idea that one should * have * to propose alternatives in order to give feedback is an abhorrent one , but thankfully this does n't present it that way , it simply points out that it 's nice if you can do that -- and it definitely is a nice thing to do whenever you can and should be encouraged . 
  where i think you go too far is in implying that someone should have done playtesting and detailed number crunching in order to create something and expect good feedback . 
  a * big * part of the * reason * for throwing things out there is to get exactly that kind of thing . 
  one should always make an attempt to consider possible powerful synergies and work through how powerful what they 're creating will be , but i do n't think a lot of this should be necessary . 
  many times , talking stuff through with others can be the best way to figure that out . 
  the last time i shared something , it was only thanks to the feedback i got that i managed to see how it compared to other similar options . 
  no one actually specifically pointed it out to me , but the feedback i got lead me to figure out exactly which numbers to crunch , and how to compare my option to the existing options , and i was able to work out a decent balance accordingly . 
  none of that could have happened without the quality of feedback i got on here . 
  the * point * of this place is to get feedback on things , so claiming that posting here `` without showing your content to a single other soul '' is a bad thing just seems completely counter to the ethos of this subreddit . 
  this subreddit * is * the `` other soul '' for most people . 
  but that 's in complete agreement with what i said before . 
  the scag is a campaign setting guide , in essence , with a few extra player options added on . 
  it 's really not very different from the elemental evil player 's companion , which came as an extra bit of player content along with the princes of the apocalypse adventure . 
   and not a side feature of some setting primer, 
  that 's exactly what the scag was , though ... 
  how do you even get to 3 ? 
  you get max one on your turn , and max one reaction , do n't you ? 
  they can get that one reaction from commander 's strike , or by an enemy provoking an oa , or any number of other things , but they still only get one . 
  i 'm looking to revisit the main-gauche weapon i tried creating earlier in the year . 
  unfortunately , to keep it balanced , i 've dropped the defensive advantages of it , and created a feat designed to go specifically with this weapon . 
  the main-gauche itself is basically just a dagger :, 
  name | cost | damage | weight | properties, 
  * martial melee weapons * | | | |, 
  & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; main-gauche | 3 gp | 1d4 piercing | 2 lb . 
  | finesse , light , special, 
  slightly heavier and more expensive , and not throwable , but being finesse and light , and dealing 1d4 damage . 
  its special property is :, 
   this weapon may be used with two-weapon fighting even if the other weapon is not light , as long as it is finesse . 
  out of the gate , this is practically identical balance-wise to the existing option of two shortswords ( 2d6 has the same expected value , minimum value , and maximum value as 1d4 +1 d8 ) . 
  the aim is to create a feat that makes using a rapier + dagger still viable even when compared against the cost of a feat . 
  my main question is , what should that feat do , exactly ? 
  my thought is :, 
  * you gain a +2 bonus to ac against melee weapon attacks while wielding a main-gauche in one hand and a finesse weapon in the other, 
  * you can draw or stow a main-gauche and another finesse weapon when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one . 
  this feels possibly slightly weaker than the existing dual wielder feat , which allows for 2d8 , and grants +1 ac against * all * attacks , but i 'd rather err on the side of being underpowered than overpowered . 
  can anyone think of a better way to balance this feat ? 
  possibly some sort of more active option , perhaps ? 
  the best place for stories is definitely / r/dndgreentext .
