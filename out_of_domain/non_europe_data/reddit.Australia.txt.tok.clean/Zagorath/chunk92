  ( another thing that 's interesting to note about this piece , listen to 2:22 -- 2:30 , one of the ideas going on in the background ( first the flute ) , and then listen to the [ second movement of the same piece ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=8z-l5sf8vp8#t=295s ) , which uses the same idea . ), 
  ** theme and variations **, 
  pretty basic in concept , it takes a single theme and then does a whole bunch of variations of that theme . 
  each time it changes the theme slightly . 
  the classic example is [ mozart 's 12 variations on twinkle twinkle ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no-ecxhepqi ) ( the top comment is very true , and quite funny , i 've seen it happen myself ) . 
  another really good one ( in my opinion , a far better piece ) is [ rachmaninoff 's rhapsody on a theme of paganini ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl5aiukpt3q ) . 
  a rhapsody is a piece with free-flow ( i.e. , no definitive form ) but with a lot of different contrasting textures , moods , etc. 
  this particular rhapsody happens to be a rough sort of theme and variations . 
  ** strophic ** and ** medley/chain **, 
  strophic is usually used with respect to modern pop music , where it refers to a typical verse chorus format where the notes are the same each time . 
  if used in classical music , it 's basically aaaa . 
  medley is the opposite of this , abcd , with no repetition . 
  you often get medleys made from the music of a film . 
  [ here 's a really good medley ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewnc6ibypgs ) of a variety of music from john williams 's different films , for 12 horns . 
  aside from fugue , which dropped out of popularity after bach 's death , sonata form is arguably the most complex musical form . 
  it begins with an * exposition * ( sometimes there is a small introduction before this , though ) , in which the main themes are presented . 
  the exposition usually consists of two groups of contrasting themes ( in a way , the exposition could be considered binary form but that 's not something that gets mentioned very often ) . 
  the first set of ideas will be in the tonic ( before going any further it 's a really good idea to see below about keys ) , and the second ( after a bridge which links the two ) will usually be in either the dominant or the relative major ( if the tonic is minor ) . 
  once both sets of themes have been introduced , the music moves on to the * development * section where the themes are both used in a variety of different ways and in different keys . 
  after the development , we return to the main thematic idea in the * recapitulation * . 
  the first theme will be in the tonic , but then the bridge will be altered so that the second theme can be in the tonic as well ( or the parallel major if the second theme was in the relative major in the exposition ) . 
  in the recapitulation the two themes might be slightly altered , sort of like they 've learnt something during the development , or been affected by it irreversibly . 
  you then often get a coda to wrap it up . 
  mozart 's 40th is a great example of sonata form , as is his 41st `` jupiter '' . 
  that said , i 'm going to quickly walk you through the sections of beethoven 's symphony no . 
  5 in c minor , per [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrgxufnfkiy ) . 
  0:08 begins the exposition . 
  this is the first theme , in the tonic key of c minor . 
  0:50 the horns enter with the second theme , in the relative major key of eb major . 
  ( notice at 0:55 , 0:57 , and at other points the basses and cellos , in brown and dark orange , play something very similar to the first theme . ), 
  at 1:32 it repeats the entire exposition from the beginning . 
  2:58 begins the development . 
  the recapitulation begins with the main theme at around 4:18 or so , but listen to the bassoon countermelody ( it can be difficult to hear on many recordings , but i 've got a [ piano version of that bit here ] ( https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2559026/beethoven/beethoven%20extracts.wav ) , just skip to 2:15 in the wav file . 
  the bassoon plays the low countermelody . 
  you can also see it as dark green in the video ) , and of course the oboe solo at 4:36 . 
  5:11 is the start of the second theme , this time instead of eb major it 's in c major . 
  note that it 's green on the score ( which represents bassoons ) , but you hear the horns play . 
  this is because when beethoven wrote this piece , horns could n't play all the notes , only select notes from the harmonic series ( trumpets had the same problem ) . 
  because of this , the horns in eb used in this piece could n't play this idea in the recapitulation because its key is different to the exposition . 
  beethoven instead wrote it for the bassoons . 
  there is debate over whether beethoven would have wanted the horns to play it if they could , or whether he likes the weaker sound of the bassoon here because it represents some idea of the heroic theme ( the second theme from the exposition ) being weakened and eventually overpowered by the darker theme ( the first theme from the exposition ) . 
  different recordings make different choices about whether to put that bit on the horns or bassoons . 
  5:53 is the beginning of the massive coda . 
  beethoven often used really large codas in comparison to the overall work . 
  had to make a second comment , the first was longer than the limit :, 
  ** symphony and other larger structures **, 
  we 've talked a lot about symphonies as well as other types of pieces , but what are they exactly ? 
  a symphony is a work for orchestra that usually has four movements . 
  ( each movement in any type of piece with movements is basically like a separate piece of music . 
  it * could * stand on its own , but has some link to the overall work . ), 
  the first movement is usually in sonata form , the second is usually slow , the third is a minuet or trio , and the last movement is another fast movement , often a rondo , theme and variations , or another sonata form . 
  the second and third movements are sometimes switched ( [ beethoven 's 9th is an example ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3217h8jppi ) ) , and sometimes extra movements are added ( [ berlioz 's symphonie fantastique ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dwji1ulszw ) ) , or remove movements . 
  concertos , as i mentioned in a previous comment , are for orchestra and soloist . 
  in classical and romantic era music concertos are almost like a duet , where the orchestra acts as one of the musicians , and the soloist as the other . 
  in baroque concertos , however ( like vivaldi 's four seasons ) the orchestra acts much more as just an accompaniment . 
  concertos usually have three movements , usually the same as a symphony but without the minuet/scherzo . 
  classical period sonatas are mostly 3 movement , with the same movements as a concerto , but later in the classical period and romantic period 4 movement sonatas became much more popular , with the same movements as a symphony . 
  string quartets are written for two violins , one viola , and a cello . 
  they are typically in four movements the same as a symphony . 
  masses are a religious vocal music for choir and orchestra , with a certain set text . 
  each of the movements usually consists of one of the parts of the text . 
  the [ wikipedia article about masses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_\\ ( music \\ ) ) is good for seeing the different movements and their text . 
  requiems are another vocal religious music , this time about death/the dead . 
  their movements are less fixed , but follow the same basic idea as the mass . 
  ** a note on keys **, 
  it helps to understand some of the theory behind music when discussing any aspect , including form . 
  all music ( apart from some 20th century pieces ) has a particular key , and what key it is in dictates which notes are most often played . 
  each key has 7 different notes ( out of the 12 notes that exist in total ) , although sometimes the extra notes will also be used to create tension . 
  the first note , the main note of the scale , is called the tonic . 
  if we are in the key of c ( either major or minor ) the tonic is c . if we are in eb , the tonic will be eb . 
  the next note up the scale is called the supertonic , in the key of c major the supertonic is d , in the key of eb major the supertonic is f. 
  then we have the mediant , in c major it is e , in c minor it is eb . 
  in eb major the mediant is g. 
  the next note up ( the 4th ) is called the subdominant , and the note after that ( the 5th ) is the dominant . 
  these notes are particularly important because the subdominant and dominant are `` related '' keys . 
  when modulating ( changing key within a single piece ) , the subdominant and the dominant keys are ones that will sound most pleasing to the ear . 
  it 's also worth noting that the subdominant of one key will be the dominant of the other . 
  for example , the subdominant of c is f . the dominant of f is c. 
  the next is the submediant , followed by the leading note . 
  for each key signature there are two different keys , a major and a minor . 
  for example , a key signature with absolutely no flats ( b ) or sharps ( # ) could be c major or a minor . 
  a minor is therefore called the `` relative '' minor of c major , and c major is the `` relative '' major of a minor . 
  this is another nice sounding modulation . 
  note that the relationship between the relative major and minor is always three semitones ( three notes if you play every note in between , not just the notes of the scale ) , or a minor third . 
  a , a # / bb , b , c ( a # and bb are the same note ) . 
  the relative major of c minor is eb major : c , c # / db ( the same note ) , d , eb . 
  the name for the minor key with the same tonic is the `` parallel '' minor . 
  for example , c minor is the `` parallel '' minor of c major . 
  they start on the same note , and they will also always share a dominant and subdominant , but the other notes will be different . 
  oh god , i did exactly the same thing ... i heard his ebay song long before i heard i want it that way , and it took me a moment to realise which way round that worked . 
  i 'm a night owl , but i still think daylight saving is stupid . 
  to me it really just makes no sense to arbitrarily change the time just so that it 'll be light halfway through the night . 
  [ here 's an interesting video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84awtseb2-4 ) about the history of daylight saving , the advantages and disadvantages of it , and the way various different places treat daylight saving . 
   personally , i feel it 's pointless and only complicates things, 
  yeah , not to mention ( as the video describes ) a significant increase in suicides shortly after each time change . 
  is that really worth this idea that somehow there 's more time in the day ? 
  edit : also not to mention the hassle it creates in organising things across time zones . 
  you know what would make * even less * fuss , though ? 
  not changing the times at all , and not altering the working hours . 
  leave it as it is .
