  / r/dnd is kinda shitty really , a lot of people just posting pictures of their dice or books or what have you . 
  / r/dndnext is where the interesting discussion about the * game * takes place , with rules clarification questions , questions about directions they can take their character ( both from a narrative and mechanical/theorycrafting perspective ) , and discussing new content as wizards of the coast releases it . 
  but there are a lot of overlaps . 
  you get some of the game discussion in / r/dnd , and there are a few shitposts that make it to the top in / r/dndnext . 
  both of those get stories now and then , too . 
  as a side note , with / r/dndgreentext , i would highly suggest starting with [ the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) to get a lot of the best stories . 
  the ones in the `` longer '' section vary between a couple of pages and insanely long novella-lengthed pieces . 
  for stranded and demigods , in particular , i would say that they are * totally * worth the investment , but you may want to pace yourself , reading a few pages/entries at a time and coming back over a few days . 
  the only spell list it 's on is the cleric 's . 
  tieflings also get it as a racial feature , and of course there are many other ways to pick it up , such as via a warlock 's tome , or by taking magic initiate , but in general , it seems completely fair to describe thaumaturgy as `` cleric prestidigitation '' . 
  of course , the two spells are not identical , and there is even some use in having them both . 
  the only variant rule regarding dropping to 0 that i can find is potentially rolling on the lingering injuries table . 
  in real life , it was * far * from uncommon to have real shields that are * not * strapped to your arm . 
  strapped shields certainly do exist , but they are not nearly as ubiquitous as popular culture would have you believe . 
  here are a few videos from knowledgeable people on the topic :,

  \\* i 'll be honest , i 've never been a fan of thrand , and i only skimmed bits of this video , it 's * really * long . 
  but you can get the important bits of it by watching the reply to that video . 
  i think it 's * very * hard to justify a lawful character reneging on a very specifically stated promise . 
  a lawful evil character might interpret the promise in the most literal way possible ( that is , after all , what devils are infamous for ) , but when the promise is as specific as the one made here , it would be very difficult for any lawful character , * especially * lawful good , to justify the character knowingly leaving a prisoner in the hands of someone that will kill them . 
  eww plz no . 
  warlocks suffer enough as it is with two spells per short rest for most of their career . 
  do n't disincentivise short rests even more !, 
  the problem is that the official recommendations are ridiculous . 
  completely unrealistic . 
  ask around the subreddit and you 'll find almost no one who regularly has a standard adventuring day . 
  the * actual * norm , and the norm that makes narrative sense in most campaigns ( including wizards ' published ones ) is far less than that . 
  but all that is beside the point . 
  the point was that your argument was to * reduce * the amount of short rests taken . 
  even if you * were * starting from the assumption of a standard adventuring day , that would penalise warlocks ( and , to a lesser extent imo , other short rest based characters ) . 
  yeah i do n't have any particular * problem * with the rules as written , per se . 
  though i do n't see why anyone would expend any effort to argue * in favour * of them , either , because there 's no particularly good basis to it . 
  if we 're being completely honest , my group , and probably most groups , do n't really bother acknowledging this particular rule , because rarely does someone wish to drop their shield in the middle of combat . 
  it 's not something that comes up . 
  so if someone wants to make a small adjustment that makes things somewhat more realistic ( at least in some cases ) , why not ? 
  but coming to the issue of `` realism '' in general , this is something that comes up a lot , and it rubs me the wrong way something fierce . 
  realism is * super * important to me . 
  anachronisms compared to real life medieval europe happen , but they 're bound to , in a world governed by magic and gods that are actually real and interventionist . 
  and those are okay . 
  but when there 's no good justification for something non-magical that * could * work , but * does n't * , that bothers me immensely . 
  shields * could * be both strapped and non-strapped , so why do the rules assume they must be strapped ? 
  why is it that you can run circles around an enemy without provoking opportunity attacks , but taking a single step back somehow is unsafe ? 
  why does flanking not provide a bonus under the core rules ? 
  i understand the arguments for the latter two , but when such a change from realism is made * without * a decent argument in favour of either balance or fun/rule of cool , why force things to be that way ? 
  do we really need to see this every week ? 
  it 's insanely dull . 
  there 's a reason you do n't see these posted on any of the other show subreddits ... 
   which would result in a power curve with diminishing impact as more dice are added to the roll, 
  i might be misunderstanding you , but this is exactly the reason i * do n't * like the idea . 
  in my mind , the increase in reliability with more and more sources of advantage should be logarithmic : it should diminish quite substantially after the first one or two . 
  but adding more dice has an * exponential * effect . 
  each dice is more significant than the last . 
  as i said , i 'm perfectly okay with sacrificing realism if it makes for more fun or helps with balance . 
  running circles around an enemy makes the game smoother and faster , and thus more fun . 
  not giving advantage for flanking is a required adjustment because of that , to maintain balance , since you can get into a flanking position so much easier with the less realistic movement . 
  i see very little justification here . 
  requiring an action to pick up a shield and allowing dropping it with your free object interaction still prevents that cheese with the bow switching ( though if i were dming someone who tried that shit , even if donning * and * doffing shields were free , i 'd just tell them `` nope , because it 's dumb and i say so '' ) , and you can justify it as the large unwieldy shield being rather difficult to pick up and get into the right position , but being easy to toss away . 
  works just fine . 
  ideally , everything should come up with a logical flavour justification , even if it 's a relatively flimsy one -- that 's the biggest problem with the flanking/movement thing . 
  there 's really no good way to describe why things work that way in universe . 
  most other departures from realism * can * be relatively easily described away within the rules of the universe , but not those ones . 
  they 're * purely * there as mechanical constructs of the game . 
  the main point is that you should ** never ** justify a lack of realism purely because `` it 's not real life '' . 
  that 's a terrible reason , and shows immense lack of thoughtfulness on the part of the person using it . 
  the fact that it * was * intentional is irrelevant . 
  it * appeared * at first that something was going wrong , and that 's what makes it sly . 
  yeah fair enough . 
  personally , i was genuinely surprised by the outcome , as at first i * did * think something was going wrong . 
  it very quickly became clear that they intended to do that , but the initial reaction was definitely surprise for me . 
  i can see why , if that was n't what you first saw , it might feel like inappropriate content for the sub . 
   also , a0 is n't even exactly 1m2 as the defined size is 841mm x 1,189 mm , which is 999,949 mm ^ ( 2 ) . 
  maybe splitting hairs at this point . 
  to be honest , i do n't think the arguments matt made regarding the origins of the system of measurement are relevant at all . 
  the fact that a metre was originally defined in terms of the circumference of the earth , and is today defined in terms of the speed of light have * no * bearing on how useful or `` good '' the metre is . 
  what makes the metre superior to the inch is that it is exactly 1000 millimetres , exactly 1/1000th of a kilometre , and that one decimetre cubed of water is exactly 1 litre , which has a mass of one kilogramme . 
  looking at any one unit on its own , there 's no advantage or disadvantage to either metric or us customary ( or imperial , for that matter ) . 
  it 's only in the way they * combine * different units that metric is clearly superior . 
  the only exception to this is celsius . 
  0 and 100 degrees being freezing and boiling points of water is clearly more useful than approximately `` way too cold to live in '' and `` almost too hot to live in '' . 
  plus it looks like earth 2 has n't advanced culturally much since the '20s . 
   you mean the crossover that 's been confirmed for a week or so now ? 
  this is the first time it 's been confirmed in-universe ( so to speak ) , though , which is pretty damn awesome . 
   all this does is shut up the people who were , frankly , dumb enough to argue supergirl exists in the arrowverse, 
  haha , i wish . 
  but no , it wo n't . 
  those morons wo n't be shut up until we actually see the crossover and see it use multiversal stuff . 
  because this actually * does n't * provide any real evidence against the idea that they 're in the same universe . 
  earth 1 is a part of the multiverse as well , after all . 
  there 's enough evidence * already * that they ca n't be the same universe , but this does n't add anything . 
  well i 'm glad you at least seem to have finally accepted that they * ca n't * be in the same universe initially . 
  for what it 's worth i agree though . 
  i 'd be glad if they do merge universes somehow . 
  i want the shows to crossover more than just this once , and having an annual/regular crossover when they 're in different universes would be weird . 
  to be honest , the first time i saw it i thought it was grodd , but when i rewound it and watched that bit again i thought it looked nothing like grodd . 
  yeah , and the dccu looks to be a different multiverse than the arrowverse ( thank god ) , which is separate from the nolan batman films , which are separate from the dcau , etc. 
  i 've always thought it a weird flaw in the design of morse code that it does n't use the prefix property . 
  that is to say , no letter in the system that is a prefix of any other letter in the system '' .
