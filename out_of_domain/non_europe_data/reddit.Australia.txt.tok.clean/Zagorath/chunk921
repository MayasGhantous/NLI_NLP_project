  for example , j starts out as '' . _ '' , which is a. 
  if morse code used the prefix property , this would n't be allowed , because once a given code is matched , you can immediately tick it off as knowing that what you have is a certain letter . 
  telephone numbers work like this . 
  for example , you can never , in america , have a phone number that * starts * with 911 , because once you type in 911 , the phone system immediately connects you to emergency services , and nothing after that is even recognised . 
  [ here 's a good video explaining this notion ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5c_rfkvkko ) . 
  what they mean is they should n't have * announced * that there would be a crossover until after * this * episode aired . 
   dc animated universe ( justice league , young justice ), 
  young justice was n't in the dcau . 
  dcau started with batman : the animated series and ended with justice league unlimited . 
  young justice was its own thing , albeit one that fairly obviously was first created at least in part because of the popularity of the dcau . 
  would * have * leaked , would * have * looked silly . 
  and i doubt it would . 
  it certainly would leak long before the crossovers air , but before * this * episode ? 
  doubt it . 
  they could have kept the secret that long . 
  do you really think the secret could n't have been kept for less than a week ? 
  if they wanted , there could have been less than a dozen people in the * world * who knew about it prior to today . 
  with that few people , keeping it from leaking would have been trivial . 
  yeah that 's something very interesting about it . 
  it makes versatile weapons a far more interesting prospect than they are currently . 
  with the current rules , most of the time , a versatile weapon might as well just be a one-handed weapon that deals 1d8 . 
  is there word on that from crawford ? 
  mearls is not the rules guy , and his statements really are worth hardly any more than that of a random dm in terms of determining what is the official rules . 
  there is a slight difference , though . 
  hurl through hell has the side effect of making the target invulnerable to any other attacks for a whole round . 
  divine judgement makes them * more * vulnerable to any attacks . 
  all attacks against them are made with advantage ( note that , raw , they are * restrained * but * not * also prone , so even ranged attacks would be at advantage ) . 
  i would suggest making a dexterity saving throw against spellcasting dc ( most likely 18 by level 14 when you get the feature ) . 
  note that it would be at disadvantage because of the restraining . 
  i like this a lot . 
  it 's a nice refinement over the previous iteration . 
  in addition to [ my suggestion below ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/4503ed/warlock_pact_the_celestial_v2/czuw0mz?context=2 ) i also have a suggestion regarding astral step . 
  you note that it gives you `` magic resistance '' . 
  magic resistance is a fairly common ability for certain monsters , but it 's not a term that gets used for player features , as far as i 'm aware . 
  i would suggest specifically describing what it does . 
  in that case yeah , it 's fine as-is . 
  oh man , this is a brilliant story , really fun imagery . 
  i 'm guessing the barbarian was a bear totem barb ? 
  that 's the only reason i can imagine you 'd have asked if he 's raging ( since it means he 'd have resistance against your lightning attack ) . 
  unfortunately , technically speaking , this could n't have happened in one turn , rules as written . 
  you ca n't cast two levelled spells in the same turn , if one of them is a bonus action . 
  what temp hitpoints , exactly ? 
  haha unfortunately not . 
   a spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift . 
  you, 
  must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell ,, 
  provided that you have n't already taken a bonus action, 
  this turn . 
  you ca n't cast another spell during the same, 
  turn , except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action . 
  but yeah , barbarians are insanely tough . 
  makes them a bit annoying to dm for , to be honest . 
  i kinda wan na try out a bear totem barbarian with con as the primary stat , dex as the secondary stat , and a shield , to get enormous hit points , enormous ac , and take half damage most of the time . 
  sacrificing damage output for it , with either strength being tertiary or using a suboptimal dex weapon , but by the gods if you would n't be the tankiest dude on the battlefield . 
  everyone makes mistakes . 
  it 's best just to own up to it and not do it in the future . 
  you can still heal and do damage on the same turn , though , by casting a cantrip instead of a levelled spell . 
  * thorn whip * or * poison spray * , for example . 
  i would like to sign up to turtle facts . 
  if they normally only dive for about 5 minutes , any idea why they might have evolved such an efficient respiratory/circulatory system ? 
  ah yes , that does make sense . 
  thanks !, 
  i think you 're putting too much emphasis on the fact that you 're bill shorten . 
  the point was just to ask `` how could labor win the election from here ? '', 
  a player in my last game was a divination wizard who also took the lucky feat . 
  thank the gods he was n't also a halfling ... 
  the hype is real !, 
  it 's an indication of shock . 
  though that a three year old account would choose to make * this * their first comment is a bit bizarre . 
   not in , apparently , civilised countries, 
  ftfy, 
  you * should n't * need anything more than the therapist 's statement that yes , the patient needs this treatment . 
  any reasonable system would recognise that being * required * to waive confidentiality is equivalent to not having any confidentiality in the first place . 
  i think the problem is that everything you quoted * technically * also applies in america ( that is , equivalent laws , not the exact same wording , presumably ) . 
  it 's just that over there , apparently it 's legal for insurance companies to * require * the patient waive their doctor-patient confidentiality in order to keep getting funding for treatment, 
  i just interpreted it as '' :o '' ( as in , an emoticon ) with the colon being implied . 
  sure , the patient should * always * be * allowed * to waive confidentiality . 
  but the insurance company should * never * be allowed to * require * the patient does so in order to continue treatment . 
  you need a gui interface to input your pin number into the atm machine . 
  but it was clear that op * did * know how it was performed , since the title mentioned `` sixteenths '' , which is term americans use to refer to what other english-speaking musicians call semiquavers , which is what these would be played as . 
  i agree . 
  i hated her . 
  i loved season 1 to be honest , and i would even say that fish was super important to penguin 's development , but she was annoying as fuck and i really hope they do n't bring her back . 
  her narrative role has been fulfilled ; we do n't need her anymore . 
  yeah my fiend warlock started out * accidentally * in the pact , so hex was a big no no . 
  and with eb and ab , a warlock does enough damage already anyway . 
  hex definitely is n't needed to compete . 
  that said , i 've since picked hex as the character has become more corrupted by the forces from the pact . 
  picked it around level 7 . 
  thanks for taking care of that . 
  that 's true . 
  subreddits about cheap drama masquerading as sport are clearly inferior to the vast majority of other subreddits . 
  to be honest i 'm loving watching bruce , and i expected to absolutely * hate * that aspect of the show . 
  but bruce and penguin totally make the show for me . 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 'm fairly sure i understood it , and deliberately flipped it on its head . 
  but if i 'm wrong about that , then please , explain . 
  it 's a panorama . 
  the process of stitching photos together can do funky things when people move around between the individual photos . 
  ah , in that case yes , i wooshed .
