   what barlines exist are used for phrasing, 
  i think the problem is that * this * particular piece actually * is * in 4/4 . 
  there are bar lines every 4 crotchets , or every 8 quavers , whichever you prefer , for the first half of the piece . 
  and then it changes to 12/8 . 
  it changes back to 4/4 ( explicitly , this time ) around 2/3rds of the way through . 
  it 's most definitely minimalist music , but it is notated in a very standard common practice period way . 
  it 's sorta the opposite of a piece like [ satie 's 3 ^ eme gnossienne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d30lazub2gs ) , which is * notated * sans barlines , but in actual fact has an extremely regular pulse with bars of 4/4 , and a semibreve at the start of each of those `` bars '' . 
  hahaha yes !, 
  op , when the results are in , do n't just pick the most popular one . 
  assign each option a range on percentile dice equal to the percentage of votes they got , and roll . 
  and you ca n't downvote these morons , or even upvote the people who actually * did * read the question , because so 's retarded `` reputation '' system says you have n't whored yourself out enough yet . 
  edit : dammit autocorrect , let me be vulgar if i want to . 
   we expect answers to be supported by droll facts, 
  here 's a droll fact for you . 
  droll actually means the exact opposite of what it sounds like it should mean . 
  it comes from the french `` dr\u00f4le '' , meaning funny , and its english meaning has n't changed much from that . 
  incidentally , i first learnt this while studying french , and it took me quite a while to be convinced of its truth , because god dammit if droll does n't sound like the most boring word in the english language . 
  cue ? 
  i do n't know how to do it with automod , but manually it works by you setting the sort to `` new '' temporarily , and then pressing the `` set as suggested sort '' button that should be next to it . 
  edit : [ here 's how to do it with automod ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/automoderator/comments/35r496/automoderator_updates_link_to_config_page_added/ ) . 
  the quasit entry says :, 
   # quasit, 
   * tiny fiend ( demon , shapechanger ) , chaotic evil *, 
  that first bit is where you 'll find what type of creature something is . 
  all devils and demons are fiends , as well as a few other creatures like night hags , hell hounds , rakshasas , and succubi . 
  your dm is altering the rules . 
  ask them how their altered rules interact with existing rules . 
  i 'd probably say about half of what it would take to build it themselves . 
  yeah , that 's basically it . 
  paladins , clerics , and a few others are `` spells prepared '' casters , so number 1 is all the spells on the list . 
  for sorcerers , warlocks , and some others are `` spells known '' casters , so number 2 is irrelevant , and part 1 is a fixed number . 
  they can cast any spell they know at any time . 
  wizards are the only ones for whom 1 * and * 2 apply . 
  they have both a certain number of spells known ( they gain two per level , plus any that they can add to their spellbook ) , but they also have a number that they can * prepare * to cast each day . 
  i ca n't see any reason that it * would n't * be able to go invisible . 
  its *** shapechanger *** ability specifically notes that its statistics are the same , so i would assume it maintains the ability to use *** invisibility *** , *** scare *** , and *** claws *** ( though the latter changes to *** bite *** when shape changed . 
  i would also say that it * does n't * learn any additional languages , or lose its native languages . 
  yes , that 's probably it . 
  if the rest of the party enjoys pvp and you do n't , then your best bet is probably to leave the game . 
  you need to understand that for some people , interparty conflict can be an important element of realism within the game and can lead to some of the most interesting character interactions you 'll have . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that . 
  and there 's also really nothing wrong with wanting to sacrifice that to have an easier game experience , either . 
  it 's just that the two ideas are pretty much incompatible . 
  if you 're the odd one out , it 's up to you to leave the game maturely . 
  it does n't explicitly say how it plays out , so you can probably make *** scare *** work however you want . 
  personally , i would be tempted to say that it has to be apparent that the creature is doing something outwardly frightening , but you could just as easily play it off as a subtle magical effect if you prefer . 
  the glass and gershwin ones are great , imo , but most of the others are somewhere between mediocre and just terrible . 
   even the cleric 's summon celestial spell ( 7th level spell ) can only summon up to a cr 4 creature, 
  the demonic unearthed arcana had a 4th level spell that can summon a cr 5 , and might have others . 
  but even so , the equivalent of a level 3 spell summoning cr 8 is still too powerful . 
  i personally am not very interested in demons ( way more interested in devils , which is why op 's creation really appeals to me in terms of flavour ) , so i did n't spend a lot of time looking at that ua , and i do n't know how well received it was in general , but at least there 's some precedent for something stronger than the cleric spell you mentioned . 
  please let us know how it goes !, 
  ah yeah , good point . 
  i missed that . 
  out of the abyss has no useful player content in it at all . 
  [ this ua could be useful , though ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/07_ua_that_old_black_magic.pdf ) . 
  it has a number of spells for summoning demons that you could use as a basis for your archetype . 
  this thread is making me so sad . 
  i used and loved aperture for so long , but it was discontinued last year . 
  i just find its workflow so much more natural and easy to work with than lightroom , even if the latter is more recent and would probably perform better . 
  lightroom is so much more awkward to work with . 
  hey , sorry . 
  rule 6 :, 
   do not make requests for homebrew , thats not what the sub is for . 
  if you want to ask for ideas , try [ the arcane forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 44qtjd/the _ arcana_forge / ) or another subreddit . 
   not much much ... to compete with at the moment , so innovation has n't been all that impressive lately, 
  a pain that has been felt by many an industry over the years ... 
  though somehow , luckily , photoshop does n't seem to have suffered from this despite never having had any real competition . 
  instead of asking people to come up with a system , you 're asking them to use an existing system to build npcs , which * could * be considered homebrew in its own right , and would therefore be a violation of rule 6 . 
  alternatively , if one does not consider using a system to build npcs homebrew , then it 's a violation of the implicit rule 0 -- that posts actually be about * homebrew * . 
  if you had instead simply linked to the homebrew itself as the main body of the post ( so long as the content abides by other rules ) and asked for people to create stuff using it in a comment , or at the bottom of the post , that probably would have been okay . 
  it 's definitely the best there is of its genre , but personally i just do n't get the appeal . 
  i 've never enjoyed let 's plays of video games , and while i find actual plays of roleplaying games a thousand times more enjoyable than lps , i still just do n't find them very entertaining in general . 
  it 's nothing against mercer and his crew , they are amazing at what they do . 
  it 's just that ... what they do is not something i 'm interested in . 
  could you clarify this ? 
   any spell or effect that grants you swim speed instead adds to your movement speed through water , added after calculating for difficult terrain, 
  first of all , is that referring to how fast you can walk along the bottom of the water ? 
  and when you say `` added after calculating for difficult terrain '' , does that mean that if you have a speed of 30 normally , you halve that for difficult terrain to get 15 , and then any effect is added on ( so that an effect which adds 30 feet would leave you with 45 in total ) , or are you meant to halve the added stuff as well ? 
  i would merge `` construct nature '' and `` maintenance '' together into one feature . 
  there are already a * lot * of features , so merging similar ones without changing the actual result at all is probably beneficial . 
  short circuit is a * very * cool feature . 
  on the whole , i really like them . 
  they seem well balanced to me , with what i would consider a lot of very minor bonuses across the board , so they 're not especially specialised , but they do seem interesting to play . 
   i was thinking that your movement speed through water would be ( base speed + movement modifiers ) / 2 + swim speed . 
  that 's totally fine . 
  i just was n't sure what it was you meant by it with the way it was worded . 
  this is some house of cards level shit here . 
  actually fuck that . 
  this is more house of cards than house of cards is . 
  not sure if you 've noticed , but the united states is n't in the southern hemisphere . 
  the difference between fiction and reality ? 
  fiction has to make sense . 
  you would probably want to tweak the champion fighter , since one of their core abilities is the larger crit range . 
  the probability of a `` crit '' in 3d6 is 0.0046 , compared to 0.05 normally . 
  if you replaced the champion 's 19 crit on a d20 with a 17 on 3d6 , you 're now at 0.0185 versus 0.1 . 
  a champion 's 18 on d20 is 0.15 , whereas if you made it 16 on 3d6 , you 'll crit 0.0463 -- slightly less than a normal crit on a d20 . 
  now , to what degree you consider this a problem is up to you . 
  personally , my suggestion would be to make the champion 's level 15 feature extend to a crit on a roll of * 15 * , which has a probability of 0.0926 . 
  so it would be :,
