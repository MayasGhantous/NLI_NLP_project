  * normal crit : roll 18 , probability 0.46 %, 
  * champion level 3 crit : roll 17-18 , probability 1.85 %, 
  * champion level 15 crit : roll 15-18 , probability 9.26 %, 
  this rewards investment in the champion class substantially more than a small dip in the class . 
  another option would be to alter crits for everyone to make them roughly as frequent as on a d20, 
  * normal crit : roll 16-18 , probability 4.63 %, 
  * champion level 3 crit : roll 15-18 , probability 9.26 %, 
  * champion level 15 crit : roll 14-18 , probability 16.20 %, 
  this makes crits * slightly * less frequent for everyone * except * a level 15 champion , for whom crits are * slightly * more frequent , as compared to d20 . 
  or you could go for somewhere in between those , for example start at a 17 for normal characters , 16 for champions , and 15 for high level champions . 
  another consequence to be aware of is how the average roll actually interacts with things . 
  because of the range of typical acs and dcs , characters will be missing * far * less frequently under this system . 
  most enemies have acs around 10-16 , and most spellcasters will have a dc around 12-15 . 
  if a * die * roll of , say , 9 , is sufficient to succeed ( 9 +2 +3 = 14 being the * lowest * you will normally see for a character attacking at level 1 if they roll a 9 , which is sufficient to hit most enemies , and will succeed on the vast majority of saves -- if it 's a save they 're proficient in ) , the players will hit the enemy 74 % of the time with 3d6 , versus 60 % of the time with d20 . 
  this is n't unbalanced , necessarily , since enemies will presumably get the same advantage . 
  however , it * will * make combat in general more deadly with everyone hitting more often . 
  anything where a 10 or less is sufficient to succeed will succeed more frequently . 
  death saves are another example , which will succeed 63 % of the time , as opposed to 55 % . 
  on the other hand , if a 12 or more is needed , it will be less frequent . 
  one consequence this has is reducing the effects of `` bounded accuracy '' , since lower level players will have a harder time hitting stronger monsters , and lower level monsters will hit players much less frequently , reducing your ability to use them as cannon fodder/minions .

  i wanted to do france , germany , brazil , and a few others , but unfortunately i only speak english so i ca n't navigate their sites to make sure i 'm linking to a page that 's actually useful . 
  personally , the way i 'd do it is exactly the same as with d20s . 
  roll 3d6 twice and choose the greater of the two . 
  not sure how to write that into anydice 's syntax , unfortunately . 
  japanese do take offense to tipping , but most of the rest of asia views it either neutrally or positively . 
  but wherever you go in asia , it 's certainly never something that is * expected * in the same way it is in america . 
  i typically tip the change , or a fraction of the change , depending on exactly how much the thing cost and what notes i paid with , here in vietnam . 
  when in australia , i never tip at all . 
  mods , take a look at / r/fightspam to stop this sort of thing popping up in the future .

  i 've got ta be honest , i first watched the show after season 4 had finished airing . 
  i binged all 4 seasons in one go , and i never noticed any substantial problems with it . 
  it has a number of particularly bad episodes ( i wo n't say which , so as to avoid giving it away for you before you get there ) , but it also has a number of really good episodes , like herstory of dance , heroic origins , and advanced introduction to finality . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the answer is yes to the question of summing their bonuses , and i 'm absolutely sure the answer is yes to the question of regaining two spell slots by using both of them . 
  but for what it 's worth , personally i would even allow you to use them with spells that have a somatic component . 
  the rules state that the hand that is used for the material component ( or the arcane focus , as the case is here ) can be the * same * hand that is used to perform the somatic component . 
  i can see no reason that this would not be the way things work , rules as written . 
  they also do n't require a dedicated ground pin , which means you can have far smaller head on devices that do n't need the third prong . 
  and the lack of the built-in fuse means you do n't get the stupidly large plugs that drop down so you step on them like lego crossed with d4s . 
  has the big advantage over the american , european , and asian plugs which are just a pain to get plugged in and have them * stay * in properly , just like the uk plugs do . 
  i think the only advantage the uk plugs have over the aus is the shutters , which is a pretty cool idea really , but i 'm not sure it 's worth all of the downsides that come along with it . 
   also , he 'd need war caster for spells with somatic components that did not have material components, 
  i 'm not sure that 's the case . 
  war caster 's second bullet point is for gish types who have a sword and/or shield in both hands . 
  the important point is in chapter 10 , on page 203 , under the headings of somatic and material . 
  since the rod of the pact keeper is an arcane focus ( phb . 
  149 & 151 ) , which replaces material components , the somatic components can be performed by the same hand that holds the rod . 
  i 've usually heard the noun patron used in a positive context , even when used to refer to a person . 
  musicians and other artists frequently had patrons for whom they would work , and who would support them so that they can concentrate on the art without needing to worry about how to keep themselves alive . 
  it 's also used in the context of roleplaying games , in a way basically synonymous with `` quest giver '' ( especially if said patron has more than one `` quest '' to give ) . 
  the negative connotation seems mostly limited , in my experience , to the verb form , `` to patronise '' . 
  [ etymonline ] ( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=patronize ) seems to imply that the artist-patron meaning was the first to evolve , followed by the modern negative connotation , and then much later , the idea of one patronising a business . 
  but i ca n't find anything definitive on * why * this evolution happened . 
  edit : holy shit . 
  `` patronus '' means protector ? 
  god dammit rowling . 
  i * believe * 2 ( 3d6 ) drop 1 should be the same as normal advantage , at 75 % in the upper half . 
  my reasoning is : if the probability of any one roll being in the lower half is 50 % , then the probability of * two * rolls being in the lower half should be 25 % ( 0.5 \\* 0.5 ) . 
  the probability of a roll with advantage being in the upper half is 1 - p ( two rolls in the lower half ) , or 1-0 .25 , which is 75 % . 
  but it 's possible i 'm missing something . 
  yes , but that `` free hand '' can be the same one that handles the material component . 
  a spellcasting focus fulfills the material component in most cases . 
  that 's true . 
  average roll of 2 ( 3d6 ) choose best is [ 12.177 ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=18*.00924%2b17*.02746%2b16*0.05376%2b15*.08616%2b14*.12121%2b13*.15349%2b12*.15807%2b11*.14063%2b10*.10938%2b9*.07341%2b8*.04096%2b7*.01768%2b6*.00643%2b5*.0018%2b4*.00032%2b3*.00002 ) . 
  average roll of 4d6 drop lowest is [ 12.245 ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=3*0.0008%2b4*0.0031%2b5*0.0077%2b6*0.0162%2b7*.0293%2b8*.0478%2b9*.0702%2b10*.0941%2b11*.1142%2b12*.1289%2b13*.1327%2b14*.1235%2b15*.1011%2b16*.0725%2b17*.0417%2b18*.0162 ) . 
  average of 2d20 choose best is [ 13.825 ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=1*0.0025%2b2*0.0075%2b3*.0125%2b4*.0175%2b5*.0225%2b6*.0275%2b7*.0325%2b8*.0375%2b9*.0425%2b10*.0475%2b11*.0525%2b12*.0575%2b13*.0625%2b14*.0675%2b15*.0725%2b16*.0775%2b17*.0825%2b18*.0875%2b19*.0925%2b20*.0975 ) . 
  so the difference between the 2 ( 3d6 ) and 4d6 methods of doing advantage from 3d6 are fairly small , especially when compared to regular advantage . 
  but then , that 's kinda the point , is n't it ? 
  op wants something that 's `` less swingy '' , and by definition , something that 's less swingy should see less of an effect from advantage . 
  incidentally , 6d6 best 3 gives an average of [ 14.271 ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=utf-8#q=4*0.0001%2b5*0.0005%2b6*0.0017%2b7*0.0044%2b8*0.0096%2b9*.0196%2b10*.0359%2b11*.0580%2b12*.0886%2b13*.1210%2b14*.1512%2b15*.1665%2b16*.1618%2b17*.1186%2b18*.0623 ) . 
  not half bad really . 
  a smaller amount better than regular advantage than the other options are worse .

  though i must admit , i do n't get the dog reference . 
  i 'm not familiar with any connotations of sirius other than for being the brightest star in the sky . 
  also fun fact , she intended voldemort to be pronounced just like vol de mort ( or `` flight of death '' ) in french . 
  hey , sorry , but i 've removed this for not following post rule 1 . 
   the content has to be complete in terms of material presented . 
  it does n't have to be perfect or balanced but it does have to be fleshed out . 
  you might want to post this in [ the arcane forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 44qtjd/the _ arcana_forge / ) megathread instead . 
  i 'll be honest , the one time this question has come up in a game i 've run , i quickly pulled out my physics data booklet and ran the calculation . 
  in my case , it was because a player wanted to know if they 'd be able to take any actions as they fell . 
  there are a number of useful equations , but the one i would recommend is ** s = ut + ( 1/2 ) at ^ ( 2 ) **, 
  v is the final velocity . 
  u is the initial velocity ( 0 , in the case of something falling , unless it went into a deliberate dive before it started falling ) a is the acceleration ( 9.81 ms ^ ( -2 ) ) , and s is the distance , and t is the time ( 6 seconds for a round ) . 
  for convenience 's sake , we 'll roughly assume air resistance plays no factor until terminal velocity ( approximately 56 ms ^ ( -1 ) ) is reached . 
  plugging the numbers in to the above equation , we get 176 m fallen in the first round . 
  the velocity reached by the end of this is found with another formula , ** v ^ 2 = u ^ 2 + 2as ** . 
  plugging the numbers in we get 58 ms ^ ( -1 ) , which is a bit over terminal velocity .
