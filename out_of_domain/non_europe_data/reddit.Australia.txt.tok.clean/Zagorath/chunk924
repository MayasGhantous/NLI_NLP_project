  so for an easy way to just estimate things , round that down to 150 m . in game distances , that 's about 500 ft. 
  for subsequent rounds , you 're falling at terminal velocity , so it 's as simple as s = vt , the formula everyone learns in their first year of highschool . 
  v is 56 ms ^ ( -1 ) , t is 6 seconds , or 336 m ( 1100 ft , if you want it in game terms ) . 
  ~ 150 m , or 500 ft. in the first round . 
  exactly ( or near enough ) 336 m , or 1100 ft in subsequent rounds . 
  the biggest flaw with that maths is that terminal velocity is about 56 m/s , which does indeed convert to 120 mph as the author of that comment said . 
  the wrong step was that this is far closer to 1100 ft per round than to 1200 . 
  ( in fact , it 's 1056 ft per 6 second round . ), 
  other than that , they seem to have arrived at the correct answer through a very bizarre method . 
  lots of people used fcp and aperture . 
  it 's hard to find a specific list , but i know the show leverage was edited in final cut pro , and pixel corps ( which has done work with , among other people , the white house ) is an exclusively apple house . 
  back when i listened to the this week in photography podcast , they would frequently have guests on who used aperture . 
  i 'd probably guess it was somewhere around a 70-30 split in favour of lightroom , so not an overwhelming majority by any means . 
  and personally , though i 'm only a hobbyist/prosumer photographer , i had always used aperture . 
  it just had a far more natural workflow and was far easier to use than lightroom is . 
  fwiw , i * love * fcp x. i had no experience with older versions of fcp , though i did use final cut express on my first major project , and i 'm sure it was great , but fcp x is clearly the perfect programme for anyone looking to edit video at anything short of a feature length project . 
  so i am * very * glad they decided to restart that from the ground up . 
  bikes are also really easy to pass on most roads if the rider is being respectful , and it 's * impossible * for them to go much faster than about 40 in most circumstances , so it would be unreasonable to fine them . 
  from a visual standpoint , i would suggest moving the image on page 4 to * under * the `` lantern archon '' statblock . 
  this * should * be as simple as dragging and dropping in the `` layers '' toolbar of photoshop . 
  and i * think * it 's normal for sidebars ( like your `` variant : lantern archon familiar '' one ) to take up the same width as one normal column . 
  you 've got yours overhanging a bit , which does n't look very great . 
  same goes for the coure sidebar , and indeed for a lot of your text . 
  the layout should always pretend that there could be a second column of text of equal width . 
  it does n't matter too much , since it 's only the credits page , but i would still suggest moving the text down -- the vertical margin is too small . 
  could we get a list of changes ( if any ) from the previous version , in terms of actual content ? 
  i wonder , grey , are you familiar with [ this news ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/technology/2016/0205/states-consider-allowing-kids-to-learn-coding-instead-of-foreign-languages ) ? 
  reading the url should be sufficient to pique your interest , from what you 've told us before . 
  stupid reasons ? 
  poor narrative structure , characters that make ridiculous and unbelievable choices , a mediocre score , and substantial deviations from characters we have come to know and love in other media . 
  are those really `` stupid reasons '' ? 
  disagree if you want . 
  enjoy the movie if you want . 
  but do not denigrate others ' opinions or feign superiority . 
  i would also add :, 
  * disjointed storytelling ( the nonlinear narrative just did n't work in this film -- it was great in the nolan batman films , but fell flat here ) . 
  * mediocre score ( the tone of it fit the film perfectly , but it just was n't a great score in the way williams ' was ) . 
  * characters making nonsensical decisions ( letting pa kent die trying to save a god damn * dog * , when he could have either saved them both or stopped pa doing that in the first place ) . 
  funnily enough , i 'm not necessarily opposed to superman killing someone . 
  the really strict no kill rule is batman 's thing , and while i want superman to avoid killing as much as possible , i 'm * okay * with him killing if it really feels earned . 
  though i do n't think it was with zod at the end of the 140 minutes we saw . 
  wow this is great . 
  you 've pretty much summed up the vast majority of my problems with the movie far better than i ever could . 
  the * one * thing i do n't necessarily agree with is clark kent , mild-mannered reporter . 
  this is an origin story , after all , so seeing him just join at the end is okay in my books . 
  the general tip is that if you were to change it to be about a particular person rather than a question , would you use `` he/she '' or `` him/her '' ? 
  if it 's he , then you use who , if it 's him , you use `` whom '' . 
  the way i remember it is that the ones with the `` m '' match up . 
  windows ? 
  os x ? 
  all of the above ? 
   woah woah woah . 
  do you have ears lol ? 
  sorry , but go into any forum for trained musicians and that 's the opinion you 'll find of zimmer in general . 
  he 's not a terrible composer , but he 's very mediocre . 
  his scores are incredibly shallow . 
  they suit the mood of the moment okay , but there 's nothing deeper to them like you get with nearly any williams score , with shore 's lord of the rings , or djawadi 's game of thrones . 
  he writes nice enough themes , but he does n't use them very effectively either in the short term ( how the theme is used within a single track ) or the long term ( how the theme gets used throughout the film 's entire score ) . 
   when did i feign superiority ? 
  i dunno , maybe when you dismissed all of the criticism of the movie as `` really stupid reasons '' ... 
   is it superman killing zod you have a problem with ? 
  perry white being black ? 
  the first is part of it , the second does n't bother me at all . 
  mainly it 's just about the general characterisation . 
  i have * some * hope that the departure may just be because it 's an origin story , and that the character will come back to what we know and love . 
  but just generally the tone of the movie , and more so the character of superman , felt way to broody and emotional , and not at all like the icon of humanity and the great hero that superman is * supposed * to be . 
  killing zod * could * have been okay if it had been better earned within the film . 
  the strict no killing thing is batman 's schtick , and i 'm okay with * very * rare circumstances leading to superman needing to take a life . 
  but emotionally it just did n't feel right in man of steel . 
  more generally , [ this comment ] ( / r/dc _ cinematic/comments/44a5tk / what_are_peoples_most_common_complaints_for_man / czozjww ) perfectly sums up some of my biggest problems . 
  the pa kent stuff is the worst . 
  if the film had been made in a vacuum , i probably would have liked it . 
  it would n't have been * great * , since there were still problems with the way the story was told ( the non-linear narrative felt janky rather than really effective like it was in the nolan batman films ) , with character motivations ( sacrificing his * life * to save a god damn * dog * , superman not stopping that ) , with some of the awkward dialogue , and of course with the music . 
  but every aspect of the film did a great job of reinforcing the tone they were going for . 
  the music was * great * in this respect , the lighting and cinematography were great , etc. 
  the problem is that the film was not made in a vacuum . 
  it 's a * superman * film , about the single most well-known character in all of comics , quite possibly all of * fiction * . 
  there 's baggage that comes along with that , and you have to either use it to your advantage , or deliberately subvert it in some way ( like red son does ) . 
  but just doing things * different * the way this did does n't work . 
  but sure , just screw reddiquette . 
  downvote away . 
  dismiss the opinion 's of anyone that disagrees with you . 
  you know what i 'm yet to see ? 
  any of those that somehow liked the film actually justifying * that * in the face of all the glaring problems , rather than just dismissing them and claiming they * are n't * problems . 
  it 's a bit rich to claim that the detractors need to put more effort in to their arguments when they already put ** far ** more effort into explaining the many problems with the film than anyone that liked it does to explaining the opposite . 
   the decision to forego charitable donations to keep more worthless [ stuff ] in a storage closet ? 
  honestly , the fact that they were donating all that stuff to begin with felt really weird to me . 
  most of the stuff the show focused on narratively was garbage that should have been thrown out , not donated . 
   in my view superman is the only character which inspires us to do good . 
  most famous heroes are dark and anti heroes who opt for torture for justice but superman is one which gives hope, 
  you hold this opinion ( one i agree with * completely * ) and yet you still liked man of steel ? 
  i just ... i do n't understand that . 
  the exact * problem * with it was that it * did n't * portray that awesome character of superman . 
  and i 'm curious , what did you not like about nolan 's batman ? 
  i 'll admit , it 's been a long time since i watched any of them except for the first , but i thought at least the first was a * great * batman film . 
  it had all the important themes associated with batman in * droves * . 
  the importance of fear , the way he has to operate from the shadows and outside of the law in order to do what is ultimately for the greater good , and the personal pain and loss he has had to suffer in order to do it . 
  all hallmarks of any great batman story . 
  specific details might have been lost , but specific details are n't what 's important , the major themes and tones of the character are . 
  anyone on here got an answer to this question from the comments ?
