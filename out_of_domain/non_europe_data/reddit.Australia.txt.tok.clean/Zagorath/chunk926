  does it bring you joy to shit all over things ? 
  personally i would consider intelligence * by far * the weakest of the stats . 
  it 's only used mechanically by wizards ( and to some extent the couple of third-casters , though depending on what they choose , they can get away without it ) , it 's probably the rarest of all the saves , and its skills are only moderately useful , and almost * never * useful to an * individual * ( that is , you generally only need one success from the entire party for it to matter ) . 
  charisma is another one with low-valued saves , but its skills are far more useful , and there are far more classes that make use of it . 
  wisdom is one of the three `` strong '' saves to have , it has highly useful skills , and a number of classes . 
  but in general , i do n't think it would be a huge problem to change stats around . 
  in some cases it would require large amounts of reflavouring to make sense . 
  a monk , thought of in the way people normally think of d&d monks , should n't use charisma -- but maybe if you reflavoured it you could . 
  warlocks using intelligence , on the other hand , seems to make some sense without changing much thematically . 
  a wisdom paladin would also make sense , in my mind . 
  that requires you plug in to your computer , does n't it ? 
  i do n't think most people do that very often . 
  security * by definition * relies on secrets . 
  if the user gives away their secrets , there 's nothing the airline can do . 
  they could use two factor verification , i suppose , but most users do n't use that when it 's offered , as it 's too much of a hassle . 
  body mics ? 
  like , lav mics , or each getting an individual studio-style mic ? 
  only available in the us , unfortunately . 
  super worth it if you 're in america , from everything i 've heard . 
  no ads , watch offline , listen to videos as just audio , and unlimited streaming through play music -- that last one makes it an objectively good decision for anyone currently paying for spotify , since you get what spotify offers , plus all the youtube stuff . 
  but unfortunately , for most of us , it 's simply unavailable . 
   because then you 'd be able to use the internet unsupervised and feed answers to students who were n't done yet, 
  which takes us back to , `` why not just ban the entire internet and whitelist necessary sites '' . 
  i was just making a humourous observation . 
  yeah that upside down graphic was insanely weird . 
  and it appeared the same way when it was used later along with the three other themes . 
  i also found something odd with the way he pronounced leitmotif . 
  with the strong stress on the final syllable . 
  personally i 'd pronounce it with strong stress on the first syllable , and a weak stress on the final one . 
  but yeah , this video was incredible . 
  i look forward to watching yours ... when i get around it . 
  i 've had [ this thread ] ( / r/classicalmusic/comments / 44smqz/happy _ 84th_birthday_to_john_williams_film / ) open in a tab for over a week now . 
  i 'll get around to it , promise !, 
  ninja edit : listened to the start of yours . 
  the way you say leitmotif is exactly what i was referring to above . 
  edit again : lol , `` john weeyums '' :p, 
  screenshots ? 
  watch your language !, 
  oooh hey !, 
  someone else in indochina !, 
  yeah sorry , i just realised how unclear my edit was . 
  the way you pronounce leitmotif is exactly the way i pronounce it , too . 
  the shownotes seem to imply that this is n't talked about in the podcast , but i figured grey would be very interested to know that [ some us states are considering allowing programming as an alternative to foreign languages ] ( http://www.csmonitor.com/technology/2016/0205/states-consider-allowing-kids-to-learn-coding-instead-of-foreign-languages ) . 
  [ link for the lazy ] ( http://www.lazerhorse.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/zheleznogorsk-flag-bear-wrestling-atom.png ) . 
  lol , it 's brilliant . 
  [ better version . 
  ] ( http://drawception.com/pub/panels/2015/4-7/rhqpd3ccyp-2.png ), 
  yeah , i definitely understand where it comes from . 
  it just sounds weird to my ear since i 'm used to that having only a weak stress when combined with `` leit '' . 
  yeah , text is n't a great medium for conveying tone . 
  if you 're looking at it from a purely flavoured perspective , i can think of :, 
  * monks being dex and wis, 
  * rangers being dex and wis, 
  and more loosely , * maybe * druids . 
  either of the other strong saves could fit along with wis. 
  obviously for balance reasons , generally people should avoid giving a class two strong saves , but it 's certainly not hard to come up with concepts that thematically could get them . 
  this is absolutely great . 
  you should cross-post it to / r/dndnext , and get in touch with the mods of / r/unearthedarcana ( which is the * best * place for homebrewers to submit anything to try and get meaningful feedback ) . 
   if ( and only if ) you 've fixed every one of those basic problems with your class, 
  i think you 're being * far * too absolutist with this . 
  just off the top of my head , wizards has put out things that break `` rules '' 2 , 4 , 6 , and even ( in a sort of weird way that i do n't actually think counts , but one could certainly sorta argue that it does ) 7 . 
  it 's definitely possible for * any * of these `` rules '' to be broken , so long as the creator is absolutely aware that they are breaking it , and are careful about how they balance the rest of the class . 
  they 're really , ** really ** good guidelines , and they should be considered ** very ** *** strong *** guidelines , but they are not always fundamentally strict must-follow rules . 
  200 % increase in riders , surely ? 
  drivers would drop would they not ? 
  this i feel really does need to be an absolute * strict * rule . 
  if you 're building something that can cast spells ( and not just simulate spellcasting like the elemental monk can , for example ) it * needs * to follow either the full caster progression , the half caster progression , or the third caster progression . 
  op 's tips are extremely strong guidelines that can , in extremely limited circumstances , be broken . 
  but this is an absolute * rule * . 
  saving throw proficiencies : constitution , intelligence . 
  hit die : d8, 
  i 'm confused about the lore . 
  you say demonborn , but refer to the nine hells . 
  demons dwell in the abyss . 
  the hells are inhabited by devils . 
  the two are * very * distinctly different types of fiends . 
   i would say fortitude and will, 
  it 's probably worth noting that op 's tip is very specifically for 5e , even though i do n't think they ever mentioned as much . 
  5e does away with fortitude , will , and reflex in exchange for each of the six standard ability scores being your saves . 
  con , dex , and wis are considered `` strong '' saves , as they get used with * a lot * of the built in spells and effects , while str , int , and cha are `` weak '' , since they are called upon more rarely . 
  the general guideline is that a class should get one of each . 
  option - = on os x. 
  hold down the = key on most mobile keyboards . 
  there 's probably an alt code for windows , though admittedly those are way more arcane and difficult to remember . 
  \u2260 is two keystrokes on os x , and can be just two on mobile operating systems , too , though one of them is a `` long press '' . 
  mate , it 's really not worth it . 
  the guy 's either a troll or just too stupid to get it . 
  contact the accc with this . 
  steam is far from a popular company with them , and for good reason . 
  more fuel to that can only be a good thing . 
  i , / u/zagorath , wish to enroll to vote . 
  if you want to format things as greentext , just prefix them with ''  '' . 
  for more advanced formatting , take a look at [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) . 
  yeah definitely . 
  em dashes and en dashes are probably my favourite , along with the ellipsis . 
  when i 'm using os x , i use at least one of those pretty much every day . 
  for some reason , alt codes stopped working on my windows desktop , so anyone going through my history can quite easily see when i 'm using which os just by looking for those three punctuation marks , versus their us keyboard equivalents ( '' -- '' , '' - '' , and '' ... '' , respectively ) . 
  proper tm and ( c ) marks are also pretty cool . 
  edit : wait , as cool as all those are , just being able to do accents easily is * by far * the best of them . 
  option-e plus a vowel for an acute , option-grave/backtick plus a vowel for a grave , etc.
