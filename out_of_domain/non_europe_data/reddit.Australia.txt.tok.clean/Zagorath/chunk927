  top is my printing , second is my left hand cursive , bottom is my right hand cursive , because why not ? 
  with my left hand , i use a hooked grip . 
  with my right i think i use the `` normal '' grip . 
  i 'm so sorry . 
   outside the home, 
  so , has there been any study into consumption * inside * the home ? 
  this is the better advice , since it works not only across browsers , but across platforms . 
  the sidebar has a table of temperature and minutes . 
  what are the minutes for ? 
  when making a standard lipton tea , i usually just poor the water onto the tea bag , dip the bag up and down a few times , and remove it . 
  that 's like , 40 seconds , tops . 
  i ca n't even imagine 3 minutes . 
  is that referring to something else ? 
   there are absolutely no game mechanics in 5e that are dependent on it, 
  unfortunately , that 's not * quite * true , though it is close enough to true that it 's easy to homebrew away anyway . 
  there are a few magic items that have different effects based on alignment , some planar effects , and some monsters too . 
  for example rakshasas are vulnerable to piercing damage from weapons wielded by a character of good alignment . 
  it 's still easy to pretend wizards had gone all the way with removing alignment as a mechanical part of the game , of course , but they did n't * quite * do it . 
  edit : quoted the wrong bit, 
  ah thanks , that makes a lot of sense . 
   there 's 1 feat in the sword coast adventure guide for deep gnomes, 
  note that the same one is available in the elemental evil player 's companion , so it can be obtained for free . 
  hey , sorry , but questions looking for help building a homebrew that is n't complete in its own right should be posted in the [ arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 45wdr0/the _ arcana_forge / ) . 
  unfortunately reddit does n't allow `` moving '' posts . 
  you 'll have to copy and paste it by hand . 
  cheers, 
  i 'm guessing you removed it before copying it ? 
  unfortunately there 's nothing i can do now . 
  do you have a copy of it backed up ? 
  perhaps a tab that you did n't refresh yet ? 
  maybe one of the other users that commented in here before it was removed have it . 
  otherwise , you 'll need to type it up again to post in the megathread . 
  well , family guy actually * was * cancelled . 
  it was only after stellar dvd sales that they brought it back and kept it going . 
  some would argue sarah conner was cancelled before her time . 
  personally i was never a fan of the franchise , so i ca n't really comment . 
  one hears a lot about arrested development and a desire for more episodes of it , but again i never watched it so i do n't know . 
  another that i 've heard a lot of people complain about is futurama . 
  personally i think it got enough episodes easily , but it 's one that comes up a lot . 
  and one last one that i heard a lot of good things about when it first came out , but never got around to seeing myself , is terra nova . 
  there are heaps more if you google it . 
  i 'm just stating the ones that i have personally heard of and heard people complain about . 
  personally , the american station that i love to hate is nbc , for what they did to chuck , community , and constantine . 
  ( huh ... maybe they have something against the letter c ? ), 
  i 've not seen any of the ones people complain about on fox except futurama , but let 's not pretend that it 's only firefly . 
  like i said , i have n't seen it . 
  i 've just heard a lot of people say good things about it . 
  i agree . 
  or if not , at the very least the amount of power delegated to the states should be vastly reduced . 
  having different education systems , different road laws , etc. 
  just seems incredibly unnecessary and inefficient . 
  i would be very happy if states existed only as far as sports are concerned . 
  ( as long as queensland 's laws regarding cycling are the ones that become the new federal law . 
  2 skills , and 2 points to be spent on either tool proficiencies or languages . 
  i do n't think the comment you replied to was meant to be taken seriously . 
  the full show ( available on your preferred `` linux distribution '' website ) is even better !, 
  the closest thing would be ritornello or rondo form . 
  basically , you have a main theme ( or `` refrain '' ) which keeps getting used , and `` episodes '' which happen in between recurrences of the main theme . 
  often represented as abacada . 
  well-known examples include [ f\u00fcr elise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mvw8tggy_w ) by beethoven , where the famous bit is the refrain , mozart 's turkish march ( linked by / u/yoyti below ) , and beethoven 's [ piano sonata no . 
  8 `` path\u00e9tique '' , movement 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljpsqc86vaw ) . 
  for a baroque example , a ritornello piece , would be the [ first movement of bach 's brandenburg concerto no . 
  2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haranlw9esg ) . 
  my initial reaction is yes , yes we will . 
  but you 've got me curious . 
  could you explain ? 
  verse-chorus structure is nothing like ternary , it 's more like a variation of rondo/ritornello form . 
  as for sonata form , i 'm not even sure i understand where you 're coming from . 
  it 's more like ab [ messy stuff involving a and b ] ab ' . 
  the problem is that libertarians do n't just dislike government overreach , they dislike a lot * good * things that governments do , too . 
  hey , sorry , but except for specially approved submissions , posts are required to be homebrew that is complete in and of itself . 
  if you want to ask questions or get help , you could try direct messaging the creator of homebrewery , or asking in one of the other d&d homebrew subreddits , such as / r/dndhomebrew . 
   make sure the paper size is ** letter **, 
  this seems an odd requirement to me . 
  why not design it around a4 , the standard used by most people/printers , etc. 
   there are plenty of spells that could be extremely useful in certain situations but are just never taken because it 's a waste of a prepared spell unless you absolutely know that it 's coming up, 
  this is an interesting problem with the system , and someone in my group conceived very broadly of an idea to help combat it . 
  it was never fully fleshed out , and so we 've never actually tried it to see how it would work , but the basic idea was that wizards should be able to have certain spells that are just sort of innate reactions that they can use without preparing them . 
  possibly some sort of extra tag on the spells , like some spells currently have the `` ritual '' tag , some spells could also have an `` innate '' ( or whatever you want to call it ) , and wizards ( and possibly some other casters ) could select a certain number ( int/ability mod ? ), 
  of those that are * always * prepared and can be cast . 
  the idea that we were thinking of was spells like feather fall . 
  specifically ones which are * really * useful in * extremely * rare circumstances , but which are also relatively simple seeming ones . 
  blade ward and true strike are two cantrips that i would never even consider taking . 
  better to use your action actually trying to attack , or to take the dodge action . 
  cloud of daggers might be interesting if you were in a place with tight corridors , but thus far my party has only * very * rarely encountered those , so it would seem a waste of a spell . 
  feather fall and jump , which are both perfect contenders for spells that would fit in the system i explained in [ this comment ] ( / r/dnd/comments / 46vzzk/least _ used_spells / d08fr1s ) , just because they 're both so situational . 
  as cool as i think the * idea * of tenser 's floating disk is , i just ca n't ever see myself using it . 
  i definitely know what you mean . 
  i rarely see people interested in magic missile , just because it does such low damage , even if it is a guaranteed hit . 
  not sure about gem shower . 
  there 's no spell by that name in 5e , and i 'm neither familiar with nor could i find in a quick scan any spell that seems to fit your description . 
  ah yeah , that 's a very good point . 
  give up one of their attacks ( at least for levels 7-10 , giving up two attacks after 10 and giving up three at 20 ) for a bit of extra tankiness . 
  seems like its usefulness would be rather situational , but still definitely a viable option . 
  one situation i was thinking of was if you were close to death and had no healing , but could try to hold out one more turn until an ally can get to you and help out . 
  the term `` libertarian '' , when used by itself , generally refers to people who are both economically libertarian ( or , `` right wing '' , as used by the [ political compass ] ( http://politicalcompass.org/ ) ) and socially libertarian ( or `` libertarian '' ) . 
  true enough , i guess , but if you 're multiclassing to get a stronger first-round sneak , i feel like the paladin would be an even better choice . 
  5 levels into paladin gives you extra attack , which is a strictly better option than true strike , since it allows for the possibility of two hits , and potentially * each * of them could be at advantage if you got it through some other source , plus you can use divine smite * on top of * the sneak attack damage . 
  not exactly , because these would still cost spell slots , but yeah , they 're very close to cantrips otherwise . 
  i sort of agree .
