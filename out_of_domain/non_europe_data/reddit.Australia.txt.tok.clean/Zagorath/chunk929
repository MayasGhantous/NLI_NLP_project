  something with a heap of lore as well as a few mechanical options necessary to make the world work ( defiling for dark sun , artificers for eberron , psionics for both , etc. 
  you 'll need to message / u/failer10 for that . 
  they 've got editing permissions on the wiki , and i 've put them in charge of updating the hall of fame with their new posts when they release them . 
  oh , right . 
  well that 's a rather arcane way of going about that ... 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  your formatting looks fine to me . 
  or , they could have just used the widely accepted and well understood terminology , rather than making arcane references to other films ... 
  have you got a link to some of these ? 
  i thought i spent a lot of time on this sub but i 've never seen these posts ... 
  on reddit , to make things appear on separate lines , you need to put a blank line in between . 
  otherwise it 'll appear as one long run-on paragraph . 
  at least both rieu and bernstein seem to be doing * something * . 
  watching eschenbach conduct one is left thinking that the only way the orchestra stays in time is because he has psychic powers or something . 
  as others have said , it needs filters and searching . 
  looking for things on specific dates or date ranges , times of day , areas , as well as types of event -- music ( perhaps filterable by genre , classical/qso would be nice , and i 'm sure others would prefer other genres ) , theatre , exercise , etc. 
  but at a more basic level , i 'm not sure the basic ui here is the best one for the job . 
  there are currently so many categories that scrolling right to go between them is really slow . 
  i feel like a hamburger menu would be much easier to use . 
  ah , cheers . 
  surely \uc678\uad6d would be wee-gug ? 
  \uc65c\uad6d would be way-gug . 
  edit : lol autocorrect made them both the same ... 
  oh yeah , i 'm totally aware that most professional musicians could more or less keep time without the conductor . 
  i was mostly being flippant and making a joke about eschenbach 's bizarre conducting style , rather than making a serious commentary about anything . 
  just , fwiw , you should probably see my edit . 
  autocorrect seemed to have buggered up what i wanted to say . 
  but still , that 's very interesting . 
  i only learned korean for a few years , and i was never really much good at it to be honest . 
  though i thought i at least had a grasp of the alphabet . 
  interesting to see where i was mistaken . 
  thanks . 
  hey sorry , but requests need to be asked in the [ arcana forge ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 470qr5/the _ arcana_forge / ) megathread , and not as submissions . 
  the problem is that * everyone * is in * either * group 1 or 2 ( as they are partitions of the set of all people ) , ** and ** some people are in group 3 . 
  that means some people are in multiple groups . 
  except that the language `` there are n types of people '' implies mutual exclusivity . 
   you may add 1d4 to any ability check , skill check , saving throw , or attack roll a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, 
  a better wording for this would be :, 
   whenever you make an attack roll , an ability check , or a saving throw , you can add 1d4 to the total a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, 
  there 's not really any such thing as a `` skill check '' , it 's an ability check that might * use * your proficiency in a skill . 
  however , i might suggest changing it from proficiency to charisma modifier . 
  i 'm not aware of anything else that uses your proficiency in this way , it 's rather odd . 
   if an attack would reduce you to 0 or fewer hitpoints, 
  no need for `` or fewer '' . 
  you ca n't go below 0 hp . 
  from memory , other similar features simply say `` reduce you to 0 hitpoints '' . 
  it 's also worth noting that warlocks are , in general , short rest based characters . 
  as much as possible , abilities should be aimed to reset on a short rest . 
  i did n't suggest this for your level 1 feature because i was n't sure if it might be too powerful if you did , but your level 6 feature most definitely should follow this convention . 
  imbuing spirits is a very interesting feature . 
  however , i 'm a bit worried about its potential to be abused . 
  is it your intent that the feature could allow a character to move through * walls * ? 
  my suggestion would be to not allow that , because level 10 just feels too early for such a potentially game-breaking feature , in my opinion . 
  all in all , it 's a great archetype . 
  your choices of spells are * perfect * , and your level 14 feature is , of course , fine . 
  i really like the theme . 
  aside from this , queensland actually has some of the best cycling laws in the world , in my opinion . 
  note i 'm being very careful in saying that it 's the * laws * . 
  the infrastructure is ... well , it 's better than a lot of places , but it 's * far * from the best, 
  unlike many other places , cyclists are allowed on both the footpath and the road . 
  when on the road , at speed limits of up to 60 km/h , cars are required to give the cyclist at least a metre of space when passing , and 1.5 m over 60 , measured from the rightmost part of the bike to the leftmost part of the car ( including side mirrors ) . 
  these in addition to more obvious things that most places probably have to varying degrees , like being allowed in bus lanes and carpool/transit lanes , being able to stay on the outside of a roundabout the whole way around , etc. , make queensland a really great place to be a cyclist , in terms of the law . 
  the bell law is a stupid one , and it 's one that up until now has been unenforced . 
  i suspect it 's mostly being enforced now for revenue-raising purposes . 
  i 'm curious as to what the actual legislation says , because the queensland transport website simply says you must have `` a working bell , horn or a similar warning device '' , and one could argue that their voice counts as a `` similar warning device '' . 
  certainly , it * should * count , if the law were reasonable . 
  oh interesting . 
  so this is an australian rule , not a queensland one ? 
  wait , other states are following the footpath laws ? 
  that 's very interesting if so , because those ones have been around for a long time . 
  wow that 's awesome . 
  even on a normal one , i believe it automatically locks and requires a password after a certain number of failed attempts , or a certain amount of time . 
  just stall for long enough that it no longer works ( refuse and try to go to court or something , perhaps ) , or enter the wrong finger a few times , claiming you do n't know why it is n't working . 
  i could be wrong about both of those , though . 
  i do n't use one myself . 
  yes , but there 's actually a third point in this system . 
  the caster . 
  it is not guaranteed that a system with three points will be abl to have a line going through it . 
  brain spike still seems very powerful . 
  there are a bunch of other cantrips out there that deal 1d8 damage to a single target , and there 's at least on that does 1d6 to a maximum of * two * targets . 
  1d8 to theoretically up to 6 targets ( realistically , you 're going to be getting 2 or 3 if you choose to use it ) is objectively a more powerful spell than sacred flame and acid splash , which is not a good thing . 
  if it were dropped down to 1d4 , that * might * be okay , but even that seems like it 's pushing it imo . 
  split bolt 's progression seems weird . 
  the damage increases at level 5 , but the number of bolts increases at level 11 ? 
  you should keep it consistent . 
  in addition , the bit in brackets is referring to the total potential damage output of the spell , but because it comes in the form of multiple bolts , you really should n't do that . 
  look at eldritch blast for your model , rather than fire bolt . 
  healing as a cantrip is a ** big ** no no . 
  it 's something wizards very deliberately left out of the game , because it makes healing far too easy . 
  a single level dip in wizard , or even just grabbing the magic initiate feat , is enough to get any character access to * unlimited * healing , if you do that . 
  temporary hit points are what you should go for instead . 
  enemies has a few style problems . 
  first , `` m , v ( a small doll ) '' : the bit in brackets needs to be associated with the m , not the v. second , `` use it 's reaction '' should be `` use its reaction '' . 
  i like the ability itself , though . 
  i quite like summoning , but i would suggest removing the `` reaction in the first round of combat '' option . 
  makes it a little too powerful in my opinion , and it steps too much on the toes of the warlock 's pact of the blade and the eldritch knight 's weapon bond . 
  you also wrote `` weigs '' instead of `` weighs '' , and missed a space in the second set of brackets . 
  misty hand seems great . 
  i take it that it can be used to simple reach into a small lockbox and grab something out of it , in addition to the explicitly stated damage option ? 
  also , has someone been watching the flash ?
