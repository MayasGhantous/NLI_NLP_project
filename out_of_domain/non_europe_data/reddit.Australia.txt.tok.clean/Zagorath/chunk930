  probably not earth-3 , since traditionally that has been used as the world where bad guys are good and vice versa . 
  but yeah , it 's * probably * an earth other than e1 and e2 . 
  we * do n't * ( despite what a * lot * of people are claiming in this thread ) know for * certain * yet , but it 's very , * very * likely . 
   like ours ( as far as we know ), 
  actually the existence of other universes in the real ... world , for lack of a better term ... is a very popular scientific theory for explaining certain phenomena . 
  it 's not known for certain , but i believe it is the prevailing theory . 
  yeah , someone else pointed out that once this one fails , it 's likely to keep on failing , since creatures gain advantage on the saves against it . 
  i missed that when providing my initial feedback . 
  so yeah , 1d6 is probably okay . 
   that would work out a lot cheaper than wasting the time of well-paid , fully trained police officers, 
  i agree that the fine is excessive , and that cyclists without bells are * not * a major problem ( vocal warnings can be far more useful anyway !, 
  ) , but there 's no way giving out free stuff is going to be cheaper for the police than fining people . 
  one involves the police spending money , the other involves them making money . 
  my suggestion would be to just copy the fiend ability . 
  say that the spirits attacking it prevent anyone else from doing so , making it immune to all other damage . 
   it would have been fine if he got off his bike , walked it on the path and then got back on, 
  actually my understanding was that he was stopped on the road to allow pedestrians to cross * across * his path . 
  he was heading north with a red light , as pedestrians were going across east to west , for example . 
  and instead of waiting for his light to go green , he waited until the last pedestrian had crossed , before continuing . 
  very different scenario . 
  oh right . 
  i missed the bit where they named the road . 
  cheers for the clarification . 
  for what it 's worth , `` jaywalking '' is n't a thing in australia in quite the same way as in america . 
  * in general * , it 's okay to cross the road . 
  exceptions to this are if you 're at a crossing with pedestrian crossing lights , where those lights are red , or if there is a zebra crossing within 20 m . at lights , you are required to wait for the green walking man to cross , and if there 's a zebra crossing within 20 m , you are required to use that . 
  otherwise , you 're fine . 
  on os x , substitute option for ctrl in this case ( the normal substitution for windows -  os x keyboard shortcuts is command ) . 
  command and arrow keys does whole lines at a time , which is also really convenient . 
  otherwise , this tip works the same across all three major desktop operating systems . 
  i 'm disappointed this got no answer . 
  seems like it has to just be an oversight , right ? 
  i 'd be creating a custom background , the `` preyed upon one '' . 
  it gets two languages , 2 skills , and the same equipment and features as the haunted one . 
  if you 're interested , there 's quite a good [ celestial warlock ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 47g291/warlock _ pact_the_celestial_v4 / ) on / r/unearthedarcana , the subreddit for posting homebrew content ( not to be confused with the official unearthed arcana monthly column from wizards ) . 
  weekly or monthly seem like the best options . 
  some people are always going to want to be giving away games , even though there are better forums for that kind of thing , so eliminating them entirely -- as much as that might be the * ideal * solution -- is n't practical . 
  but making it a free-for-all just stifles discussion and takes focus away from the main point of this subreddit . 
  from a logistics standpoint , i 'm a bit worried about the fact that you 've used first past the post for this . 
  there 's almost * no * scenario in which fptp is a good choice . 
  people who want weekly and monthly are almost certainly going to be universally * okay * with the other one of those , so the `` use a megathread of some sort '' crowd will be split . 
  people who want none at all or want a free-for-all are probably mostly going to be mutually exclusive groups , but some in each group might be okay with some form of megathread as a compromise . 
  something like this probably should have been run using approval voting as a simple option , or alternative vote ( also known as av , instant runoff , or irv ) if you want something a bit more in-depth to account for people 's preference . 
  but since you 've started it with fptp , i 'll try and give some suggestions for how you should interpret the data you get from it . 
  first of all , ** do not ** just take the winner and go with that . 
  the winner is likely to represent somewhere between a quarter and a third of the total subreddit 's opinion , and so it will * not * be a majority . 
  i would first suggest looking at the combined result of the monthly and weekly megathread options . 
  if those combined are over 50 % , take the more popular one of those and use that . 
  if they are not , then look at the combined `` megathread '' result and see where it compares to the `` free-for-all '' and `` never '' options . 
  if it 's substantially larger than both of those ( say , it 's around 40 % and they 're around 30 % each ) , again , i 'd say go with the more popular of the megathread options . 
  if one of the extreme options is substantially more popular ( above about 40 % of the three options ) , you should probably take it as the winner ( though again , had you used a better voting system , it 's very likely that the more moderate position would have won , despite the early lead ) . 
  on the other hand , if it 's too close to call , my suggestion would be to use some mod fiat and go with whatever you feel is best . 
  ideally though , redoing this whole survey using av would produce irrefutable results . 
  and , for what it 's worth , as far as i 'm aware , survey monkey caps out results at 100 , unless you pay for it . 
  why not use google forms instead ? 
  it 's free for as many results as you could want . 
  i love a fair amount of western animation , but i just hate anime , and i have the same problem . 
  it keeps pushing anime on me , and western cartoons made for audiences under the age of like 6 . 
  give me more stuff like god damn avatar or young justice , not curious george and rurouni kenshin , whatever that is . 
  i have no idea why they decided i 'd be interested in nazi stuff , though ... 
  it got a lot of bad press when it first came out . 
  part of this is from a number of extremely ignorant reviewers expecting it to be something completely different from what it was trying to be and shitting all over it when they did n't get that , and part of it is that the game was actually fairly buggy at the time . 
  the game has improved substantially since then , and the ignorant reviews remain just as ignorant as they were at the time . 
  let me watch your god damn shows . 
  if i was the one paying for a subscription , i would have cancelled it the moment i first saw a message telling me that i could n't watch it while i have a proxy enabled . 
  lucky for them , i 'm using my parent 's account , and for them , the proxy still works . 
  looks like they only care about blocking proxy users in developed countries ... 
  mine is explaining the difference between int and wis in d&d using a well-worn analogy . 
  guess reddit just really likes d&d ? 
  someone in the [ d&d discord chat ] ( https://discordapp.com/channels/113801089362558983/113801089362558983 ) recently mentioned an alternative that was apparently listed in 1e :, 
  * roll 3d6 down the line ( that is , 3d6 6 times , putting the first one in strength , the second in dex , etc. 
  : no choosing which number goes where ) . 
  * do this * 12 * times . 
  essentially creating 12 characters . 
  * choose your favourite of the 12 . 
  it 's * a lot * of dice rolling if you do it by hand , and i 'm not sure whether or not i like it , but at the very least it 's an * interesting * alternative . 
  obviously , running the numbers on this is impossible . 
  the closest one could do is to take the `` objective '' best result of the above , but a player might not want that , because perhaps the highest stat they got on that was int , and they want to play a barbarian . 
  what is it about these weapons that you like ? 
  there 's a chance that you may be able to alter them so that you can keep that aspect of it and make them more level appropriate . 
  it 's nothing about forcing . 
  just reach out to a bunch of youtubers -- i would strongly recommend including the nostalgia critic , as the guy who started this recent resurgence in interest in fair use on youtube -- and tell them about it , and ask them to use it and promote it if they like the idea . 
  word of mouth is great , but it can only get you so far . 
  kick starting that process by asking some big creators to get involved early ca n't hurt . 
   assuming stats are 4d6 and you start with 20 cha, 
  that seems a mighty assumption you 've made there . 
  a better assumption is that you start with * 18 * cha , since there 's a 56.8 % chance of rolling at least one 16 or higher , but only a 9.3 % chance of getting an 18 . 
  an even better assumption to go with is that they start with 16 , because those that use point buy will cap out at that ( well , 17 , but it 's the same +3 modifier ) , and there 's a 92.8 % chance of rolling at least one of those . 
  i like this . 
  we do n't get enough pact boons submitted here imo . 
  the flavour is really interesting , and i trust chifii 's claim that the maths works out . 
  now for some actual critique , it should probably say `` you can store one hit die '' rather than `` dice '' , though . 
  same goes for all subsequent uses of `` dice '' as singular . 
  one thing i 'm unclear on is , do you have to have at least one remaining hit die in order to store it ? 
  does the act of storing a hit die in the ring * cost * one of your normal hit dice ? 
  and if so , does it come from yesterday 's pool of hit dice , or tomorrow 's ? 
  either way , i feel this needs to be clarified , because at the moment it 's unclear . 
  but in general , i really like it . 
  yikes , this could have gone * really * , ** really ** badly . 
  this guy is super lucky .
