  a few minor typos :, 
  * `` they fore fire to do their bidding '' , missing the c in force . 
  * `` firebenders pride themselves in their skills '' should be `` on their skills '', 
  * how do you * utulise * your skills ? 
  * in stunning touch `` send a shock through * it 's * body '' and `` you make a * mellee * spell attack '', 
  * melf 's minute * meteros *, 
  overall , i ** love ** this concept . 
  i 'm not great at telling balance compared to other classes , so i ca n't really comment on that , but i would suspect the sorcerer is the best one to look at for comparison . 
  but for flavour , and for not being * blatantly * badly balanced , it 's brilliant . 
  i really look forward to seeing more of these from you in the future . 
   this is n't a pitch , it 's a pick off attempt, 
  oh , interesting . 
  i was aware of how pick off attempts worked ( though i did n't know the term for it ) , but i figured this was a pitch because he seemed to be facing in that direction prior to the head scratch and throw . 
  any idea why he would have been facing the same direction that he was trying to pick off ? 
  haha , that hidden ball trick is pretty clever , but yeah , something like that in cricket would be considered insanely dirty . 
  though to be fair , in cricket , aiming to cause physical harm ( or , more commonly , the * fear * of physical harm ) when bowling is perfectly acceptable . 
  so it 's almost the reverse in that way . 
  strict rules against ball tampering are something the two sports have in common though , it seems . 
  incidentally , it 's been shown that corked baseball bats actually * decrease * the distance the ball travels . 
  it 's a method of `` cheating '' that actually harms the cheater . 
  but no , that definitely was n't too rambly at all , it was really interesting . 
  thanks . 
  the folks at / r/cricket are really friendly , and would be more than happy to explain the game to you if you ask . 
  it 's generally pretty easy to find online streams of most big games , if you 're interested . 
  unfortunately , there are n't any significant games going on this month . 
  the southern hemisphere 's summer season has pretty much wound to a close , and the northern hemisphere wo n't be winding up until may or june . 
   it does not take any conscious effort to open an xps file, 
  except that * everyone * already has a pdf reader . 
  people have to go out of their way to find something that can read xps . 
  i can see why you would be tempted to make it a monk subclass , because the flavour is quite similar . 
  but , to be completely honest , to make interesting benders is * impossible * using the monk as a base . 
  benders need a substantial amount of magical ability , and the elemental monk is essentially a one-third caster like the arcane trickster and eldritch knight are . 
  that 's just not a viable way to go about building benders . 
  taking the sorcerer as a base and tweaking a few of its abilities , and coming up with a new subclass seems like it * could * be a viable way to make a firebender without coming up with a whole class on its own , but that might lose some of the interesting flavour that can be achieved by doing something from scratch . 
  i agree with you regarding controlled casting though . 
  there are other abilities in this that give negative effects , and those i actually do quite like , but controlled casting just feels wrong to me . 
  the `` memes '' note in the header overlaps `` grey '' and make the y look more like a v. 
  i found economics pretty easy . 
  i had a complete loser of a teacher in the first year , and had to pretty much re-do the whole course in the second year . 
  ended up with a 6 in the subject . 
  it 's mostly stuff that 's pretty easy to get your head around . 
   our only chance is to reboot the electromagnetic insulators and * hope * the quark matter redistributes equally . 
   how do we do that ? 
   we 'll need to do it manually . 
  from s02e14 of the flash . 
  i do n't think i 've ever heard technobabble that 's quite so terrible before . 
  i had to go back and rewatch that bit twice just to get over how terrible it was . 
  i 'm still waiting for something from labor . 
  i 've got a little card from the greens and lnp , but labor 's been silent so far . 
  \\* shrug *, 
   if what that government is doing benefits the majority of voters they should have no problem getting re-elected, 
  unfortunately this is just not true . 
  many things that are good and benefit voters can be incredibly unpopular in the short term . 
  just look at what happened with , for example , the nbn and the ets ( the `` carbon tax '' as the media decided to refer to it ) . 
  longer terms make it far , * far * easier to do these kinds of things safely , and they also mean that governments do n't have to be constantly pandering to the electorate . 
  personally i 'll likely vote no at this referendum , because i do n't like fixed terms , and because i 'd be wary of longer terms , even despite their clear superiority in the general sense , without the security of a proportional upper house . 
  yeah that 's the direction i 'm leaning in right now . 
  i actually like the idea of longer terms . 
  i think the uk has the right of it in general at 5 years . 
  but without an upper house to keep things in check , and also because this involves 4 year * fixed * terms , rather than the flexible terms that have always been a part of our system , this particular instance just seems like a bad idea . 
  and yet we kicked out the government that was introducing an emissions trading scheme , and was rolling out the national broadband network . 
  like it or not , the electorate is incredibly short-sighted , and things which take time to be useful can be extremely difficult to do in short terms . 
  i 'll probably vote no on this referendum because of the specifics , but make no mistake , in the general sense , longer terms * are * better than short ones , up to a point . 
  in particular , the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) has a number of the very best stories that have been shared on there . 
  yeah sorry , this is n't really appropriate content for this subreddit . 
  if you want to share the story behind the picture , that would be fine , but a reaction gif is not on its own relevant here . 
   wisdom would be the understanding of where your powers come from ( for ... pallys, 
  careful now . 
  paladins are actually a charisma based caster . 
  they 're exerting their will on the world , rather than it being a matter of wisely understanding the source of their power and the nature of the world/gods . 
  but yeah , some more utility stuff would definitely be a very good idea . 
  all of your examples seem like great ones . 
  well , the most obvious answer would be to just shift it over about 10 or 15 pixels . 
  looking at it with my browser only taking up about 80 % of my secondary monitor ( which is itself only 1024 pixels wide ) , there 's definitely enough space that even on small screens , you should be able to see the full width of both the sticky note and the bulb and gear logo / `` c.g.p. 
  grey '' title at once . 
  it might not be the greatest answer aesthetically , but it at least kinda works . 
  alternatively , the stick could just have a rip in its top left corner for some reason . 
  how come ? 
  i thought the flash was off because people would be busy with super tuesday , but if arrow 's off too , it must be something else . 
  will legends be on tomorrow ? 
  holy * shit * that is a lot of extensions . 
  any chance we could get a rundown on them ? 
  i only recognise , like , a quarter , if that . 
  ( also , you have what looks like an aperture logo in the toolbar , but since you 're running windows it seems unlikely that that 's what it is ... ), 
  i get what you mean about the lack of int classes , but i really do n't think firebenders are the place to go about fixing that . 
  think about it , in all 113 episodes of the shows and 9 + comics , have you ever seen any indication that firebenders really need to hit the books and study in order to become better at firebending ? 
  it just is n't how they work . 
  charisma would probably be my first choice , but wisdom can make sense as well . 
  there 's nothing particularly wrong with having some overlap . 
  yeah i definitely agree regarding spells . 
  it 's difficult to come up with ones that fit . 
  but one thing worth remembering is that these spells do n't need to be entirely unique . 
  look at the life cleric . 
  i do n't think it gets * any * spells that all clerics ca n't pick . 
  the trick is that it * always * has those prepared , and they * do n't * count against the total it can prepare . 
  similarly , you could have some spells in the origin that the character * automatically * knows , and then it can have a bit more freedom in which of the others it chooses . 
  i would be tempted to give them :, 
  * colour spray , reminiscent of [ this moment ] ( https://youtu.be/uwcorlhnh4e?t=252 ) , instead of bane . 
  * continual flame instead of detect thoughts . 
  * protection from energy ( allow cold , fire , and lightning -- the cold would represent using their own internal heat to fight off the cold , and the lightning would represent some small amount of lightningbending even though that is n't their focus ) instead of dispel magic .
