  i did n't say better , i said cheaper . 
  the * best * thing to do would be nothing at all . 
  cyclists without bells are n't a threat or danger to anyone . 
  their voice can communicate far more than a bell could anyway . 
  but the guy i replied to claimed it would be * cheaper * for the police to give away free stuff than it would for them to issue fines . 
  that 's just nonsensical . 
  installing linux was much harder than any of the times i 've installed windows , but that was n't what i was referring to above . 
  i was referring primarily to the process of installing common basic applications . 
  see my reply to a different comment below for more detail . 
   a creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier . 
  ** this spell has no effect on undead ** or constructs . 
  emphasis mine . 
  most of the healing spells have similar stipulations . 
  okay , can somebody please explain to me why everyone 's randomly spouting out `` jay garrick '' the last few days ? 
  it has n't even only been on the arrowverse subreddits . 
  why , in a week where there was n't even an episode of the flash ? 
  yep and yep . 
  i did eventually get it working . 
  i do n't remember how , but it did work . 
  it was just a lot of hours of work . 
  probably spent the best part of a weekend on the whole thing . 
  i 'm okay with it , because there were other things i wanted out of linux that made it ultimately worth it , but i would be extremely hesitant to recommend to anyone else . 
  weirdly , the extension seems to have not caught that , at least for me . 
  wonder how it works ? 
  is it a simple matter of case ? 
  is it future spoilers ? 
  in that case , no , i 'd rather not know . 
  you might very well think that . 
  i could n't possibly comment . 
  [ the flash ] ( #f `` is that where he dies ? 
  or was that the second most recent episode ? '' ), 
  i ca n't remember ... it 's hard to keep track of what happened when with like 5 dc shows going on at the moment . 
  but if that * is * it , i still do n't really understand why people would be just randomly saying his name everywhere . 
   global search/replace , check in, 
  this is why i do n't understand all these other stories . 
  you notice the problem , even if it 's extremely widespread and has infested the entire large codebase , it 's still super easy to fix . 
  ditto australia and the uk . 
  oh , yeah , i 've seen that . 
  i guess i just do n't see why it 's worthy of memification . 
  no , i 've already seen it . 
  i just do n't see why it was memified . 
  imo none of the shows have had a line nearly as bad as :, 
   our only chance is to reboot the electromagnetic insulators and * hope * the quark matter redistributes equally . 
   how do we do that ? 
   we 'll need to do it manually . 
  from s02e14 of the flash . 
   you ca n't quantify the internet without hacking the visual rss feed !, 
   i 'm pretty sure he 's going to end up murdering frank . 
  a very , very interesting theory . 
  on his own , do you think , or perhaps conspiring with someone else to make it happen ? 
  it was working for me a few hours ago , but is n't right now . 
  i have n't tried restarting either the computer or the router , since i 'm currently downloading a large file that ca n't be paused , but i have tried everything else i can think of , including refreshing , clearing cache , multiple computers , changing dns back to default ( and it does work when i do that ) and then back to theirs again ( at which point it ceases working again ) . 
  thanks for the link , though . 
  i did n't realise they had a subreddit already . 
  from the looks of things , [ i 'm not the only one to have noticed the problem ] ( / r/borderlessinternet/comments / 496m2y/netflix _ not_working_with_dns_turned_on / ) . 
  # core, 
  it bothers me that they talk about cas , ee , and tok as the `` core '' and yet cas is worth nothing , and ee and tok are * combined * worth less than half a normal subject . 
  to fix this , i would change it so that ee and tok are combined worth ** 5 ** points , rather than just 3 , using the following table :, 
  | a | b | c | d | e, 
  ** e ** | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | fail, 
  and i would make cas worth 2 points , with the following requirements, 
  ** fail ** : failed to reach the level required to pass ( as currently ) . 
  ** 0 ** : reached the minimum required level to pass ( as currently ) . 
  ** 1 ** : exceeded the requirements for amount of cas done , but failed to document correctly . 
  ** 2 ** : exceeded the requirements for amount of cas done , with thorough documentation . 
  this would mean that those who just do the bear minimum amount of extracurriculas are actually seeing some benefit for their work as compared to those that barely managed to pass ib at all , thanks to struggling to get over the line to pass cas . 
  combined , this makes the so-called `` core '' worth as much as a normal subject, 
  # group 6, 
  group 6 is entitled `` arts & electives '' . 
  we all have to do a first language . 
  everyone must take a second language . 
  a social science is mandatory . 
  nobody can get out of doing maths and a science . 
  but arts ? 
  oh , you can do one of those if you like , i guess . 
  i have a couple of ideas for changing this . 
  i prefer the first one by far , but i would be okay with the second one , too , because at least both of these systems would be fair , unlike the current system . 
  allow anyone to opt out of * any * one group . 
  make group 6 mandatory . 
  option one would mean that a particularly artsy person might do both art and theatre , while eschewing maths , or someone who wants to study medicine can get the necessary chemistry and useful biology background , without needing to give up their chance to continue their musical study . 
  you still get the well-roundedness that makes ib such a fantastic system , but people who are particularly bad at or uninterested in one particular area can choose not to do that one, 
  option 2 is somewhat less savoury , but at the very least it is far more equitable than the current system , wherein the arts are a second-class citizen to all of the other subject groups . 
  the person who marks your ee does n't have to be educated in the subject that they are marking . 
  this means that if someone has written a good paper on a difficult-to-understand topic , they are at a * substantial * disadvantage . 
  i myself was a victim of this , being predicted a solid a , but ending up with only a b , which cost me a point . 
  so i would change it such that markers have to be experts in the subject of the ee that they 're marking . 
   tok , cas , and ee are what make ib ib . 
  if you do n't like them , do your national high school curriculum . 
  hear , hear !, 
  all three of them are absolutely fantastic and essential to the entire * point * of ib . 
  no edition warring . 
  hear , hear !, 
  the criticism of the gillard government based on the fact that it was a hung parliament was northing more than a huge pile of spin from a media determined to attack that government in any way it could . 
  maths does . 
  they are all transferred , but are worth only a fraction of what they previously were . 
  well , i mean , i agree with you , crits on anything other than attack rolls and death saves ( and even then , just following the actual rules and not having a 1 equal `` you accidentally stab yourself '' ) are dumb . 
  but at the same time , * in effect * a 1 is going to be an automatic failure . 
  even if it 's something you 're really good at , for a large portion of your levelling you might get +8 , which is going to fail on a 1 even for a dc as easy as 10 . 
  similarly , a 20 is in effect a success the vast majority of the time . 
  if even a 1 succeeds , or a 20 fails , the dm should * generally * not have called for a roll to begin with , and just announced success or failure .
