  as for the thing about the perception , i do n't know what goes on behind the scenes , but i suspect the ibo does the best they can . 
  there 's only so much they can do in the face of what are quite likely very stubborn organisations . 
  i would n't worry too much about people concentrating on core . 
  it 's still only worth 1/7th of the total marks available . 
   you still need art other credits to graduate , and something from all the other areas, 
  see , this is what i 'm referring to when i say you 're being american-centric . 
  it 's perhaps * so * american-centric that you do n't even realise you 're doing it . 
  other countries do n't have this notion of `` needing art credits to graduate '' . 
  if you 're doing ib , you * just do ib * . 
  you take 6 subjects , tok , cas , and an ee , and * that 's it * . 
  and that 's how ib * should * be run . 
  it 's * designed * to be an all-encompassing secondary education curriculum . 
  requiring students that are doing this to take on * any * extra academic requirements is bad design from the schools and governments , but it 's not a problem of the ibdp . 
   making a g6 art mandatory would close off that option to many people, 
  sure , but making * everything else * mandatory closes off possibilities like film and theatre , or theatre and music . 
  why should the arts be a second-class citizen ? 
  as i 've said , it would be * even better * if it 's a simple matter of `` skip * any * one group '' , but making * all * groups mandatory would be a far more fair and equitable set up than what they have currently . 
  le bac is a pretty interesting set up , i 'll grant you . 
  you ultimately have to take a bit of most things , but with a focus on your preferred area . 
  i do n't think it * quite * gets the mix right , for example with the scientific stream having to take french language but no option for literature , and the literature stream not having any option for ( let alone a basic * requirement * of ) some maths . 
  it also , at least from what i 've heard from my french teachers , is made up of a bunch of poor individual curriculae , with an emphasis on fact memorisation rather than learning and understanding . 
  but it is an interesting framework . 
  kind of the opposite of a-levels , which from what i 've heard tend to have pretty decent individual curriculae , but have a `` horrific system '' ( as you so aptly described it ) for how the overall subject selection works . 
  that 's actually also , from the very little i know about it , how i feel about the american system : good curriculae , but bad structure . 
  part of it is a philosophical issue , i suspect . 
  i quite strongly believe that students should * not * be focussing * too much * at high school , and that even students who are quite dedicated and know exactly what they want to end up studying should be strongly encouraged ( or `` forced '' even ) to get a very broad education . 
   if g6 were mandatory , these kinds of options would be cut off, 
  i do n't follow . 
  if the arts were mandatory , you could n't have a deeper experience learning french ? 
  or geography ? 
  i do n't see why not . 
  the only thing it should close off is combinations like biology and chemistry , or history and geography , things like that . 
  no individual subject would suffer at all . 
   if g6 was mandatory , lots of people could end up just taking visual arts, 
  quite possibly , but they 'd probably be shooting themselves in the foot if they choose it just because it sounds like the easiest . 
  it 's a massive time sink , if the students in my year who took it were anything to go by . 
  music is insanely hard to get a 7 in ( as far as the teachers at my school are aware , i was the only one in asia to do it in my year ) , but comparatively easy to get reasonable marks , and i suspect film may be the same . 
  but again , i can not emphasise strongly enough that * my preferred solution would be to open up all groups to being dropped * , and ** not ** the `` make group 6 mandatory '' one . 
  let all students choose any one subject they just hate and not do it , if they so choose . 
  if i really hate languages , let me not worry about french b and take both psychology and economics . 
  if someone else is just terrible at maths , let them do both music and theatre . 
  if a third person does n't much like literature , let them take maths , physics , and computer science . 
  pi and mu are n't * too * bad , but functions can get really annoying -- difficult to read , and very long line lengths -- if you 've got lambdas , deltas , and epsilons in there . 
  if you 're using os x ( which puts [ a lot of ] ( http://i.stack.imgur.com/jeyar.png ) [ very useful keys ] ( http://i.stack.imgur.com/cvvnq.png ) on simple keyboard shortcuts involving `` option '' ( an easier to use equivalent of windows ' `` alt codes '' ) ) , why * not * use some of these easier to understand symbols ? 
  i did some creeping , and they 've previously stated that `` i teach at a small university '' , so uq seems unlikely . 
  hey mike , i 've got a question about a slightly different topic that i was wondering if you could answer . 
  i bought your massive map of the sword coast : the one with the big pdf . 
  what was the brief on that one ? 
  were you specifically told which cities and towns to include , and told not to put others on ? 
  i mainly ask because i bought it hoping the pdf would contain a far greater amount of detail in its labelling . 
  i mean , as beautiful as the maps are to look at , they 're pretty useless for playing games in the realms , and there 's absolutely no need for a map that 's so large with so little detail in terms of named landmarks . 
  it 's almost certainly not your fault , i would suspect , but i 'm just curious about your perspective on the whole thing . 
  hey , just so you know , reddit does n't allow meme.am links normally . 
  i 've manually approved this one , but in the future , try uploading to a site like imgur . 
  yeah , i 'm having the same problem . 
  both windows 10 and os x 10.11 with a variety of sites . 
  located in qld . 
  it 's not * every * site , and it 's not * all * the time , but it 's definitely very noticeable . 
  it * is * every time on netflix , though . 
  yeah i thought that would be the case . 
  ah well . 
  the maps look absolutely beautiful , regardless . 
  any decent podcatcher should have the ability to set the playback speed on a per-podcast basis ( and if yours does n't , well , perhaps you should look at getting a different one ) . 
  but i find the notion that 1.1 x is too fast a rather comical one . 
  i 'm currently playing back cortex at 2x , the same speed i listen to hi , and both of these are my * slowest * podcasts . 
  but new people come in asking the same questions , so they get the same answers . 
   there 's some kinda substitution cipher in there too, 
  well , we can comfortably presume whatever it is , it 's a simple substitution cypher ( as opposed to something like vigen\u00e8re , which would * probably * make the two gs in uggc different ) . 
  the obvious one to try would be whichever caesar cypher is needed to change uggc into http . 
  conveniently , this does indeed happen to be rot13 . 
  this gives the result of :, 
  but i 'll leave it for someone else to decode what you get at that link . 
  wait , are we not supposed to do that ? 
  i 've always written it javascript ... 
   i pounce ` colonel ' as ` kur-nel ' . 
  so , assuming you meant `` pronounce '' ( i do n't know what it means to jump at a word ) , is n't that the same as kernel ? 
  ker and kur both being the same , essentially . 
  do you listen to hi and/or cortex ? 
  because you really , really should , if you like vexilology . 
  you mean `` advice '' , i believe . 
  in most english dialects , words with `` ice '' are the noun and `` ise '' are the verb . 
  american english uses `` ice '' for both , but `` ise '' is never the noun . 
  the easy way to remember this is to remember that americans often change `` ise '' to `` ize '' ( which is how `` ise '' tends to be pronounced anyway , except in the case of `` practise '' ) , which just makes a word * feel * like it should be a verb . 
   it 's more like eating a gourmet meal too quickly instead of savoring it, 
  yeah that 's the part i find amusing . 
  for me , listening at 2x * is * savouring it : most of my other podcasts are between 2.4 x and 2.8 x. 
  1.1 x is so close to 1x i can hardly even see the point . 
  but my personal recommendation would be ** pocket casts ** , which is an amazing application and absolutely worth the on-off price of a cup of coffee if you listen to podcasts regularly . 
  other ones i 've heard good things about -- i would * assume * that most of these can do variable speed by podcast , but not having used them i do n't know for certain -- include downcast , overcast , podcast addict , and dogcatcher . 
  both are acceptable . 
  edit : but `` zhaif '' is not . 
   due to bribery through campaign donations, 
  ianal , but i feel like such strong wording * could * be considered libellous . 
   continued emphasis of support on primary industry in australia, 
  this would be a * massive * vote loser . 
  the farmer 's lobby is a very strong one in this country , and farmers have a lot of support from the people of australia in general . 
   poor , mostly law abiding , not orphan, 
  so ... the exact opposite of batman in literally every important way ? 
  see , this shit right here is why i continue to use `` arrowverse '' . 
  name it after where it all started , and leave it at that .
