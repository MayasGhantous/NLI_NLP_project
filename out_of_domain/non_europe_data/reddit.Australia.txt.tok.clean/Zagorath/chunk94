  is that network related in any way to fox ? 
  i only ask because the channel that airs those ( or the ones of those that we get here ) where i am is closely associated with fox ( it advertises extra channels like fox and fox crime ) . 
  but with lower taxes any increase in i there must also be a decrease in g , surely ? 
  i do n't know about game theory but in economics the same effect is called the freeloader effect . 
  it could just be that the station we get ( it 's called star world , with another station called star movies ) has made separate deals with each of these us networks . 
  someone needs to tell them they have the worst mobile website ever created . 
  good point . 
  if they changed it because it was islamic symbolism , how is that different from it being offensive ? 
  i think we need a central repository for all the really high-quality posts all over this subreddit . 
  could you write the channel 's name so i can put it into the app directly ? 
  very cool . 
  i look forward to seeing the result . 
  very good point . 
  in economic theory it 's far too easy to always assume ceteris paribus , which of course is n't the case in real situations . 
  i 'm not 100 % certain , but i think jail is increasingly used in britain . 
  australians still mostly use gaol i think ^ ( ( i say think , because as i said i 've been mostly out of the country since i was 10 . 
  i did n't even realise until this year that officially we now say `` football '' for soccer ... urgh . 
  i do n't think most people abide by that though ) ^ ) , but even there it is becoming less common . 
  i have a midi version for clarinet and piano , and you could leave out the piano part if you wanted . 
  i can send it as a midi file , a pdf score , a sibelius file , a wave audio file , or an aiff audio file , or any combination of those you want . 
  just pm me if you want any of those . 
  i 'm of the opinion that there is no laptop better than a mac , but for desktops i love a nice powerful gaming machine , and that means windows ( though i 'd love a dual-boot hackintosh-windows if the mac side of it had zero problems ) . 
  out of interest , what sort of mac do you have ( type : mbp , air , imac etc. 
  ; screen size ; year , etc. ) . 
  you probably wo n't have any trouble using bootcamp , but that would mean shutting down to open into windows . 
  depending on how new it is you may be able to use parallels or vmware to run windows in a virtual machine ( meaning you can use the complete windows or select windows programmes in a separate window within the mac os ) , it 's super easy to do if your computer is up to it . 
  it said ios ( iphone ) . 
  i use ios on an ipod touch , but there was n't an option for this . 
  i figured it probably did n't matter much , but if your friend is assuming all ios users are iphone owners they 're going to have problems . 
  `` i have paid money to remove advertising from an app '' is a yes or no question ... 
  do not track is not supposed to be on by default , by doing it microsoft is n't adhering to the spec . 
  yeah no kidding . 
  i use both windows and mac on separate computers , and i have more trouble displaying it on windows than on mac . 
  it works in the browser both , so it 's not a huge problem , but on windows some applications ( i use it on skype in ims sometimes ) wont display it , but it works in every application on my mac ... 
  i ca n't comment on how well it imitates mozart , i do n't honestly know his quartets that well . 
  but as a string quartet on its own this does a pretty good job . 
  you 'll probably want to add some dynamics in , at the moment there seem to be some sforzandos , but other than that it 's forte the whole way , which is really dull . 
  i noticed some points that definitely could have used a drop in dynamics . 
  with regards to dynamics , if you 're going for a mozart style , you 'll want to keep all four instruments at the same dynamic level when they 're playing : the performers would work out balance themselves , the composer would n't explicitly state it . 
  looking at it from a technical perspective , the audio was very quiet . 
  i turned my volume up all the way and it was still quieter than what i 'd consider `` forte '' . 
  even if you alter nothing from your audio exporting programme ( although you probably can ) , you should turn the audio up in the process of making the video . 
  speaking of which , what programme did you use to write this in ( and more importantly , where did you export the audio from ? ) . 
  if you could get your hands on a copy of sibelius 6 or 7 you 'll probably have a much nicer composing experience , but you 'll ** definitely ** get ** much ** better quality audio exports . 
  i should probably mention that i 'm interested in any feedback i can get on this about any aspect of it . 
  i chose not to vote because while i like the composition , the title was a bit dickish . 
  i suspect some of the others may have downvoted for that reason . 
   the melodies rarely leap out and grab at you, 
  i do n't suppose you could try and elabourate on this point ? 
  i 'm not sure exactly what you 're trying to say . 
  the melody is n't supposed to be a catchy pop-tune type thing . 
  the main theme is meant to be ... kinda floaty i guess . 
   harmonies seem to hover over a few chords, 
  yeah , definitely . 
  it 's my biggest self-criticism of all my compositions . 
  i 've been trying to slowly work on it , but this piece definitely shows the trouble i 've been having with modulation . 
   the transitions you use are a little hasty, 
  another frequent problem of mine , albeit one that i 've yet to really take any serious measures to fix except where specifically pointed out . 
  i 'll try to take it on board in a more general way, 
  1:05 , i do n't know for sure what an elision is , but i gather from the meaning i found [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elision ) you mean something like bringing the viola melody forward a bar or so to have less of a sudden gap ? 
  if so yeah , that sounds like a very good idea , i 'll try it . 
  with regards to the cello at 2:12 , i can only assume you misread the alto clef as treble , because the chord at that point is b minor ( and reading the b as an a would make it d major ) . 
  in any case , i agree that in theory that seems like it could be a worthwhile idea , lowering the cello does n't actually sound right . 
  at 3:05 that could be an interesting idea , with what is currently there ( a return to a variation on the refrain ) coming afterwards . 
  thanks so much for the good criticism , i really appreciate it . 
  definitely did n't come across as dickish . 
  ( well , apart from the fact that you seem to imply it 's my fault that the tremolo sounds bad , that was kinda dickish the way you phrased it '' * you have * a bizzarre sound coming out of * your instruments * '' and `` fix ... this '' . 
  do n't get me wrong , when someone has major problems with their sounds i 'll point it out to them , too , but i 'd like to think it comes across less dickish the way i do it . ), 
  finale ? 
  odd , i always thought that was supposed to be high quality . 
  how recent is your version ? 
  i guess you 've tried whatever its mixer-type features are ? 
  i know in sibelius by default the sounds are quite quiet , but you can turn up the overall volume as well as the virtual instrument volume ( which seems to basically act as a second overall volume level ) to make a good loud sound . 
  fair enough , i never knew that . 
  thanks . 
  pretty sure it 's playing the notation right in a technical sense . 
  the sounds it was making were definitely repetitions of the same note over and over again in quick succession , which is what i wanted . 
  it 's just that it does n't sound very good when it does it . 
  i 'll try a z roll and see how that sounds , but sibelius plays back a trill as an actual trill from one note to the next ( except on percussion ) , so that would n't work . 
  ah ok , i 'll definitely have a go at that . 
  i 've had an idea in mind for doing that anyway , so it could be an interesting exercise . 
  it 's reposted ? 
  damn , i thought that was their own version on youtube , on account of it having ads on it . 
  does this mean someone else is making money off of the original creators ' stuff ? 
  i had seen there was a vimeo version that they uploaded themselves , but i did n't know they had put it on youtube , too . 
  i did n't link to vimeo because it 's an absolutely horrid experience , even if it is higher quality when it decides to work properly . 
  thanks for linking the official version . 
  only one i picked was bentham , and even that 's only because i thought to look it up . 
  could someone explain what this picture ( and its title ) have to do with heisenberg ? 
  5 when i got here . 
  oh ok , thanks . 
  when i heard heisenberg the first thing i thought of was the heisenberg uncertainty principal . 
  that may have thrown me off somewhat . 
  just curious , if you do n't mind saying which defaults other than / r/atheism ( and perhaps / r/science and / r/askscience ) would you unsubscribe from for religious reasons ? 
  i refuse to use any adblock services because websites are able to be free by serving ads to people . 
  by blocking ads you 're preventing the web from working as it really should . 
  i now have op tagged as possible nokia shill . 
  when it first came out you could do more than 2 in skype . 
  but they quickly changed that once they brought it out of beta . 
  you are indeed blessed .
