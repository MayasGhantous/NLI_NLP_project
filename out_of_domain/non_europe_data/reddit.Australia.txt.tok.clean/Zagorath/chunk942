  the one i remember is that everything is `` of sorts '' . 
   maybe if the dm gives you a whole year of downtime, 
  not ridiculous at all . 
  if you finish one campaign , having large amounts of downtime before another starts can easily make sense . 
  personally , i doubt that this was played in * any * real game , but if it was , it was almost certainly not d&d . 
  but still , it 's absolutely one of the best posts that 's ever been on / r/dndgreentext , and it has definitely earned its place [ in the hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) . 
  i was expecting it to be like / r/shittyaskscience , but for legal questions . 
  as far as i 'm aware , in c , ` #define ` works basically the same as if you as a user went through and did a find & replace before compiling , so yes , it would work perfectly . 
  ## overall score : 8.83 / 10, 
  ### wording/formatting update : 9.5 / 10, 
  the update fixed almost all the wording problems i found , and even a few that i did n't . 
  the main reason i feel like i ca n't give this a full 10/10 is the pictures . 
  the way they 're blended is n't quite as elegant as phb race entries are . 
  the art itself is beautiful , and the blending is * good * , it 's just not * great * . 
  you as a company may by about infosec , but borderless internet as a product very clearly is not . 
  bi advertises itself as , and its core feature set is about , bypassing region restrictions . 
  that is why , personally , it feels kinda scummy that bi discreetly just blocks ads . 
  it does n't tell the user it 's doing this , it does n't give them an up-front chance to opt-in , it just makes them disappear . 
  that 's * really * harmful to the web , which is a platform that exists in the incredible form it does today * because * of advertising . 
  having the * option * to block ads is fine . 
  some people just do n't care that they 're hurting the web . 
  there are always going to be selfish individuals who would just rather have a cleaner personal experience , so you might as well cater to them . 
  but indiscriminately blocking * all * advertising to users * by default * , on a service marketed around a completely unrelated set of features , is just plain * wrong * . 
  sure , there might be some portion of malvertising out there . 
  personally , i have * never * come across it , and while i 'm struggling to find any reliable statistics , i suspect there is only a * tiny * fraction of it that comes from major advertising agencies . 
  the vast majority of it would be blocked by a blacklist of known unreliable sites , or even a comprehensive whitelist of mostly reliable agencies like google , facebook , and reddit . 
  tl ; dr , once you 've created the `` light '' option , that should be the default . 
   i agree the light version should be the default once it is created, 
  honestly , that 's all i wanted to hear . 
  that puts me totally at ease . 
  there 's absolutely no problem ( in my mind , anyway ) with blocking advertisers that are already * known * to be bad . 
  seeing a wrist that can rotate 360 degrees is kinda * disturbing * . 
  question for these ship names , should it be sart , or snara , and rendra , or kay ? 
  glockenspiel -- or celeste , if you have one -- is a surprisingly nice blend with brass , especially the horn . 
  there 's a nice moment in ravel 's bolero where you can hear the effect , and there 's a brief moment of trumpet + glock ( for a similar effect ) near the end of the star trek : the next generation title theme . 
  pitched percussion in general can be a really great way of just lifting out a particular part in the score and emphasising it without getting in the way of anything . 
  3/16 , surely ?

  [ this is where it takes me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5mnaxzp.png ) . 
  ah , thanks . 
  i wondered if there might be some edge cases like that . 
  man , i remember walking down to a blockbusters with my dad to grab a movie of a weekend , early last decade . 
  that store is now a large chemist of some sort . 
  it 's certainly no surprise that these places are going out of business : the internet is just so much more convenient , and even more so now with legal * streaming * options , so you do n't even need to pay for a specific movie , download , and store it . 
  but it is a little sad to see them go . 
  are you actually recommending the [ viol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viol ) , or is this a typo where you meant to say viola ? 
   did he accidentally connect to a speaker in the other room, 
  bluetooth requires line of site , so this would n't be possible . 
  huh , so it does n't . 
  still , it 's not far from that . 
  it certainly wo n't work from one floor of a house to another in normal circumstances . 
   because the devices use a radio ( broadcast ) communications system , they do not have to be in visual line of sight of each other , however a quasi optical wireless path must be viable, 
  i suspect you looked a lot younger in 1994 , too , if you were even alive then !, 
  my general suggestion would be to never allow any homebrew that has n't gone through some form of public vetting , and had the creator respond to said feedback . 
  because of this , / r/unearthedarcana is pretty much the * best * place to go to find good homebrew . 
  not everything on there will be good , but by going there and looking at the feedback things have gotten , you can quite easily figure out what 's worth using and what is n't . 
  / r/boh5e is an even better place . 
  for the most part , pretty much * everything * that gets submitted there is worth allowing , if you like the flavour . 
  hey , sorry , but this violates post requirement 1 . 
   the content has to be complete in terms of material presented . 
  it does n't have to be perfect or balanced but it does have to be fleshed out . 
  if you want to solicit feedback on a vague idea , try posting in the latest arcana forge megathread instead . 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  seriously , what the fuck ? 
  and it 's not even just that one guy ... 
  the top answer in the meta thread basically defends him :, 
   that does not mean the poster who posted that code was necessarily being malicious . 
  in fact , it 's pretty clearly * not * malicious , just ill-advised . 
  it even includes some warnings , though they are not as obvious as one might like . 
  so , we do n't need to `` slap '' anyone , but it 's worth a few seconds to protect the hapless from themselves . 
  yeah , let 's * not * ban the guy who just posted code that can ** erase people 's hard drives ** . 
  he was n't being * malicious * at all . 
  fuck the stack exchange network and its horrible fucking culture . 
  i just had a look at the estimated calories lost on my garmin from my last few runs . 
  probably not super accurate , since it 's not measuring things like heart rate , but my last run was just 24 minutes and it estimates 323 calories lost . 
  the run before that , was 52 minutes and 684 calories . 
  about 13 per minute . 
  now , i do n't know if that 's a very efficient way to lose weight , since i 'm not very familiar with calories as a unit of energy . 
  we use kilojoules here . 
  but i do know that it 's about 3 times what you said it was . 
  my first bit of feedback ( before reading anything ) is that it 's a weird name . 
  should n't it be tinkerer ? 
  probably ? 
  there 's no probably about it . 
  the sports commentators regularly interject into their commentary with information about betting . 
  it 's not so much a secret conspiracy as it is just the way things are done at the moment . 
  hear , hear !, 
  why not ? 
  ca n't you do an ee on any subject ib offers ? 
  general advice : never allow * any * homebrew which has n't been through some form of public vetting process , and had the creator respond to said feedback . 
  because of this , / r/unearthedarcana is pretty much the best place to go to find good homebrew . 
  not everything on there will be good , but by going there and looking at the feedback things have gotten , you can quite easily figure out what 's worth using and what is n't . 
  / r/boh5e is an even better place . 
  for the most part , pretty much everything that gets submitted there is worth allowing , if you like the flavour . 
  i want to know what the context for this is . 
  what 's she * actually * talking about ?
