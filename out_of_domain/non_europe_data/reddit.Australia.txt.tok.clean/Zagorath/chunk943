  you can see it because i 've manually approved it . 
  but a mod from the subreddit would have to do this for every one of / u/idocreating 's comments ever for it to be seen . 
  no worries . 
  glad to have helped . 
  [ here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 37d520/the _ ballad_of_edgardo / ) and [ here ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 26vi4h/the _ tale_of_edgardo / ) are the two times the text version of this has been posted , if anyone is interested to read the comments from those occasions . 
   as a statement on the treatment of moderators by reddit administrators , as well as a lack of communication and proper moderation tools , / r/animalsbeingjerks has decided to go private for the time being . 
  see https://www.reddit.com/r/outoftheloop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/ for more info . 
  uhh ... no it has n't ? 
   funfax media, 
  lol . 
  ca n't help but think equalemail media would be a better name , though . 
  ( plus , the subreddit is available . ), 
  [ twig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twig_ ( template_engine \\ ) ) , which is the language used for templating in the latest version of drupal ( replacing straight php , used in older versions ) , uses { { } } to insert variables , and { % % } for other commands such as loops . 
  yeah they do it to bypass youtube 's content detection system . 
  and somehow , despite google claiming that they 'd fixed these sorts of loopholes [ back in april 2012 ] ( http://youtubecreator.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/improving-rights-management-at-youtube.html ) , it thankfully still works . 
  i might suggest checking out [ bordeless internet ] ( https://borderlessinternet.com/ ) . 
  personally i do n't use it for youtube , but it can be set to automatically treat you as being in the us ( or some other countries ) for youtube , netflix , etc. , and i 've found it works great for netflix , so it would probably work here too . 
  no it does n't . 
  * people * should ** never ** be shadowbanned . 
  shadowbanning is meant to only be used on spammers . 
  spam bots are n't going to see the comment informing them that they 're shadowbanned , and besides , it 's already super easy to check : just log out ( or go to an incognito window ) and check your user page . 
  when actual users get shadowbanned for breaking a rule , that 's a mistake . 
  reddit has other tools that it is supposed to use for such offenses . 
  the user deserves to know that they 've been sbed . 
  2016 , year of linux on desktops confirmed ? 
  i 'm fairly sure we saw jerome flash up on that little slideshow thing they had on the wall in the club . 
   alfred : now bruce , he wo n't answer his phone so my guess is he 's gone after this malone -- solo . 
  haha , that subtle pause there . 
  for anyone not aware , `` pat malone '' is cockney rhyming slang for `` alone '' . 
  my guess is that 's what he was about to say , before he realised how weird it would be . 
  the only thing i can think of is that , if that knot is truly called the `` eldritch '' knot , then its name is synonymous with `` strange '' . 
  * [ elemental evil player 's companion ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ee_playerscompanion.pdf ) is a free pdf containing * all * of the new levelled spells outside of the phb so far , as well as a number of races and subraces . 
  * the sword coast adventurers ' guide contains a few cantrips , a number of backgrounds , some race variants and subraces , and a few new subclasses . 
  no free pdf to go along with this , though . 
  you * can * get [ a small sample of the content from this for free ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/news/dd-extra-life-update ) , but otherwise will have to buy the book . 
  * curse of strahd contains a new background , but i believe that 's it in terms of player content . 
  then there are the monthly ( up until this month : from here on it looks like it 'll only be bi-monthly ) unearthed arcana articles that wizards puts out . 
  these are * playtesting * material and may not be balanced as well as official content , but they are nevertheless worth at least looking at . 
  some of them are quite good . 
  you can find a list of all of them [ in the subreddit 's wiki ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/wiki/resourcelist ) . 
  and finally , for far , far more stuff , consider homebrew . 
  my general opinion about homebrew is that it should be avoided unless it has gone through some form of public vetting , which is why i recommend against personal blogs , dandwiki , and the dm 's guild , but would instead point you towards / r/unearthedarcana and its more elite brethren / r/boh5e . 
  for the former , use care and make sure to see how much the creator responded to feedback . 
  for the latter , it just being there means it 's close to wizards quality and is probably okay to use . 
  no worries . 
  i edited in a link to where you can find all the ua stuff , and my advice regarding homebrew , if you 're interested in that in the future . 
  hey , sorry , but this violates post requirement 1 . 
   the content has to be complete in terms of material presented . 
  it does n't have to be perfect or balanced but it does have to be fleshed out . 
  if you want to solicit feedback on a vague idea , try posting in the latest arcana forge megathread instead . 
  flavour is a no from me . 
  the nidhogg , in norse mythology , is n't a humanoid , and your version has very little relation to the being . 
  if you renamed it so that it * was n't * taking the name of something it is completely unrelated to , i 'd say i quite like the flavour , though . 
  i do n't like articulated movement . 
  it seems to be massively misusing the * reaction * mechanic and i do n't think it should be so easy to just disregard the negative effects of being grappled , but even beyond that , i do n't understand what it 's doing . 
  you 're grappled , but you can move `` around your tail '' ? 
  what does that mean ? 
  balance-wise , i 'd probably give the base race a +3.0 , the coastal subrace +1.5 , desert +2.0 , and mountain +2.0 . 
  so within acceptable range , but towards the lower end of the acceptable range . 
  the convention for most races is to give a +2 and a +1 to two ability scores , and since you have n't done this currently , i would suggest changing it so that they have that . 
  maybe +2 dex for all , and then give a +1 based on subrace ( mountain could be str and desert con , for example ) . 
  ## overall score : 9.57 / 10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 9.8 / 10, 
  i 'll be honest , the only reason i 'm not giving this a 10/10 is because the rasterised text that the walrock template produces ( an unfortunate side effect of it being produce in an image editor , rather than a desktop publisher -- or even word processor ) makes it far less convenient than text that can be selected and searched . 
  there 's also the very minor problem of the headers in the class table relating to spells not being bold , the even more minor one of the first paragraph in vampiric arcana being indented ( typically only subsequent paragraphs have indentation ) , and the slightly problematic use of just `` check '' instead of `` ability check '' in *** lifeblood *** . 
  but these are so minor as to barely be worth mentioning . 
  the text is written absolutely beautifully . 
  the prose is fantastically enjoyable to read just for the sake of reading it . 
  ### theme/creativity : 9.9 / 10, 
  the tableaux are absolutely perfect . 
  some of the best i 've seen . 
  each of them captures a different aspect of what makes vampires so compelling , and each of them got me interested in the character and left me wanting more . 
  the remainder of the fluff text does a fantastic job of encompassing many of the traits , origins , and lifestyles associated with vampires in previous editions and in more general real-world folklore . 
  flavourwise , the prerequisites all make perfect sense . 
  i know i 've heard of people who like the idea of a warforged vampire , and those will be disappointed by this , but to me it feels like totally the correct set of requirements . 
  the ability to choose what your spellcasting modifier is , is an interesting one . 
  it makes this prestige class very easy to use with a wide variety of other spellcasters . 
  however , i 'm not sure i agree with the approach . 
  i 've never known vampires in lore to be particularly studious or insightful , or more particularly to use these attributes to work magical effects . 
  at least in my mind , charisma is the quintessence of vampiric spellcasting . 
  and on the matter of spellcasting , i 'm not * quite * sure that the spell list is the best it could have been . 
  particularly the level 3 spells . 
  personally , i think the undead that can be summoned using curse of eternity are sufficient to meet the degree to which vampires can do such things , and i can think of a number of other spells which could have been better thematic fits . 
  bestow curse , fear , feign death , gaseous form ( though this is already more or less gained through a class ability ) , sending , and vampiric touch are all spells that i think would be better thematic picks . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 9/10, 
  the first obvious thing to point out is that this makes characters unable to be healed by conventional clerical-type spells . 
  for some groups , that 's going to be of minimal effect , for others it might be a substantial drawback . 
  they could also be negatively affected by an allied cleric 's turn undead . 
  these are not bad mechanics at all -- it 's an important drawback to playing a vampire . 
  but it is definitely something that needs to be pointed out . 
  the flaws seem stronger than the base benefits ( those listed under child of the night ) , especially when one considers that the loss of benefits from healing spells comes from the supposed `` benefit '' of undeath . 
  again , this is n't a bad thing : becoming a vampire * should * be a net benefit , before one takes into account the more outward powers conferred by the curse . 
  most of the flaws are , quite obviously , mostly just flavour , but * sunlight hypersensitivity * is quite clearly one with potential to substantially impact gameplay . 
  mechanically , the option to use any mental ability score to cast spells is a fine choice . 
  it prevents vampires from being pigeon-holed into just the charisma casters . 
  vital reserves and blood drinker are a pair of fairly complicated mechanical features for dealing with the fairly simple concept that is `` vampires need to drink blood '' . 
  but i think that is justified here . 
  the sorcerer-like blood points provide a sensible amount of flavour to back up the basic expendable resource of this prestige class . 
  the bite attack , similarly , is a sensible option that realistically has next to no effect on balance . 
  the really specific mechanics detailing how it works with different sizes , on the other hand , just seem unnecessary .
