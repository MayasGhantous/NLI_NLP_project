  the general rule for thp is that they last for a long rest , is there a particular reason to make this an exception ? 
  the very first thing i 've noticed is that you 've said it gets proficiency with `` intelligence ( religion ) '' etc. 
  normally , one gains proficiency with just the * skill * , not the combination of ability ( skill ) . 
  remember , skills can be used with a variety of abilities depending on the circumstances . 
  if you specifically intended the proficiency to be added only to the specific combination ( and i would suggest against doing that in this case ) , you should word it as `` you may add your proficiency bonus to two of the following of your choice '' or similar , rather than saying you actually * become * proficient . 
  i would reword liar 's sanctity to say `` creatures that believe you to be of the same faith or philosophy as them have '' . 
  it just reads a little nicer . 
  i would reword faithless fervour to `` you may use a reaction to cast a spell slot available to this roguish archetype '' . 
  no need for the bits about `` instead of an action or bonus action '' or `` expend a spell slot '' , which are both really clumsy sounding and already succinctly included in the simpler explanation . 
  mechanically , i think this is perfectly sound . 
  i like the really simple mechanic of `` these are the spells you get '' , and i like the selection of spells you 've given it . 
  if you * were * going to take into account other people 's suggestions to make it more flexible , i would suggest basing it in some way on divine domains , but personally i think it 's fine now . 
  though i must say , i 'm not sure i 'm a fan of the flavour of this . 
  where do its powers come from ? 
  gods , at least in standard d&d settings like forgotten realms , are not beings a mortal can swindle into gaining powers like they might a fey warlock patron , or from which they can siphon power like a great old one . 
  if there is n't a god that actually is willing to give them power , from whence does it come ? 
  some more definite explanation of the source of the huckster 's power would not go amiss in my eyes . 
  oh , and just in case you were n't already aware , your vampire prc is [ currently in the process of being reviewed ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49mnbi/vampire _ prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone / ) or / r/boh5e . 
  it 's doing extremely well . 
  wait i 'm sorry , are you describing the real life 2016 presidential election , or the one from house of cards ? 
  then i would have to maintain a whitelist for every possible use of the bot ( not just sitting mps , but members of each party which wants to use it within their party room , potentially members of the press who want to notify particular users for comment , etc. 
  ) , which is exactly what i set out to avoid in this iteration . 
  a blacklist has never been necessary at all in the past , so i do n't envision it being necessary going forward . 
  if it is though , i can add one in . 
  nearly 60 kg seems like an overestimate to me . 
  male and i 'm 60 kg . 
  a runner 's body , but certainly not insanely skinny . 
  if you 're assuming they 're 165 , i 'd peg their weight at no more than 50 kg , and probably a bit less than that . 
  rolling for components is not a great idea . 
  if you look at existing spells , there 's a certain sort of logic applied . 
  it 's fairly difficult to explain * what * that logic is , but there 's one there . 
  rolling would mess this up and produce nonsensical results . 
  and there 's no need for `` f '' , or if there is , it definitely should n't be anywhere near that common . 
  in normal circumstances , an arcane focus is used * in place of * normal material components . 
  in some cases this is not possible , because the material components are given a specific cost , but these situations tend to be rare . 
  resurrection spells , for example . 
  for future reference , reddit does n't send notification for username mentions in self posts , so you have to call the page bot in a comment . 
  ( and also , see / u/this _ guy22 's syntax for how to do it , if the only people you want to page are members . 
  though be aware that you * can * put the paging call at the end of a comment with more substance to it -- it does n't have to be all in its own comment . ), 
  and i just want to second the honourable treasurer 's comment that you should be saying `` aye '' and `` no '' , not `` yea '' or `` nay '' . 
   it should n't be impossible ... for a huckster to find a more minor god or gods that would be willing to provide powers for ritual alone, 
  fair enough . 
  perhaps that should be explicitly stated in the flavour text somewhere . 
  another option would simply be a trickster god that wants to encourage the rogue 's swindling . 
  they could presented as a sort of `` maybe you [ this ] . 
  or perhaps you [ that ] '' format . 
  but whatever the case , i definitely think including something in the flavour text to explain it would help . 
  why would you assume that ? 
  today is 21st march , over 3 months away from 1st july . 
  and it 's working fine for me at the moment . 
  no , `` other '' is fine . 
  personally i would probably have gone with `` feat '' , just because the spells seem to be there in large part to back up the feats , but either way is okay . 
  even so , someone ( presumably a government employee ) has to take care of that garden , and it looks so nice a pretty . 
  why would people be okay with wrecking that ? 
  it seems almost malicious . 
  there are four basic types of spells . 
  * ones which do not involve attacking or affecting an unwilling target in any way ( like * darkvision * or * cure wounds * ) . 
  these are irrelevant to the conversation . 
  * ones which affect an unwilling target automatically ( like * magic missile * or * hex * ) . 
  these can not crit . 
  * ones which require the target or targets within a range to make a ** saving throw ** ( like * fireball * , * dominate person * , and * sacred flame * ) . 
  these can not crit . 
  ( if they get a 1 , they probably fail , but the damage is the same . ), 
  * ones which require * you * to make an ** attack roll ** ( like * eldritch blast * , * scorching ray * , and * shocking grasp * ) . 
  these * can * crit , and they function the same as weapon attacks . 
  look for the keywords `` spell attack '' in the spell description . 
  with regards to costs for m , there are certain spells which use it largely for flavour ( * identify * is a clear example , and arguably * scrying * ) , but for some , it is a necessary balance element ( all of the resurrection family of spells ) that should be altered only with the greatest of care . 
  oh thanks !, 
  i recognised the piece , but i did n't realise it was bach 's birthday today , so i missed the joke . 
  no , `` the british isles '' includes both the island of britain and ireland , as well as the smaller islands like man etc. 
  the term is somewhat controversial in the country of ireland , but that 's a purely political thing . 
  the geographical term is pretty clear . 
  lol poor cambodia and laos ( the actual countries -- though the areas of thailand that they 've labelled with those are amusing , too ), 
  makes me wish that they had extended the map a * liiitle * further so they could have labelled viet nam and malaysia . 
  in terms of the * written * language , where a `` word '' is demarcated as being separated by white space , punctuation , etc. , vietnamese is always ( or at least * nearly * always , there may be some exceptions ) one syllable to a word . 
  the original transliteraters could easily have done it differently if they had wished , and it probably would n't have impacted the legibility of the written language very much , because as you say , the language itself is n't structured such that words are monosyllabic . 
  curious , is that used all across the country ? 
  living in saigon , i could have sworn it was an aspirated voiceless velar plosive ( i.e. , / k\u02b0 / ) . 
  i know there are some substantial differences between northern and southern vietnamese pronunciations in some letters , and even larger differences between those two and central vietnam , so it 's certainly not infeasible that the pronunciation i 'm used to hearing would be different than the so-called `` standard '' one . 
  but then again , perhaps that 's just my anglophonic ears mishearing things entirely . 
  on second thought , that 's probably more likely . 
   england , great britain or the uk based on context . 
  however , the majority of ~ ~ vietnamese ~ ~ people can not distinguish these three concepts, 
  ftfy . 
  it 's quite amazing how often even english speakers do n't understand the difference between these things . 
  there 's a reason cgpgrey 's video from a few years ago became so popular . 
   i was just looking for a series to have on in the background, 
  oh god man , i was exactly the same . 
  i figured it 'd be a nice easy show to have on and enjoy while i did other things . 
  but it became so incredibly consuming because it 's just such a fantastic and engaging show . 
  i loved nearly every minute of it , from the start all the way to the end . 
  in fact , i would say this show has one of the greatest endings of any show out there . 
  but for what it 's worth , just a tip , i would * strongly * suggest staying away from this subreddit , the show 's wikia , wikipedia pages , etc. 
  at least until you 're finished with it . 
  it 's * very * easy to have major plot points spoiled for you by accident if you 're just looking up simple unrelated questions . 
  i know i had that happen to me when i first watched the show all the way through and it was really disappointing knowing that . 
  i still absolutely loved the show , but i feel it would have been better to go in blind . 
  i was gon na ask you where you 're from ( would 've guessed japan or korea ) , but then your username lines up so perfectly with your timezone so that becomes unnecessary . 
  did they ? 
  i had the stream on in the background as i was doing other things , and this seemed a * particularly * non-event to me .
