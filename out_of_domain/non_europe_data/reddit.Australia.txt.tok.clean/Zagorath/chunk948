  smaller ipad pros are cool i guess , but nothing nearly as significant as a whole new product category . 
  registrant :, 
  name : cgp grey, 
  organisation : grey industries, 
  looks like grey does own it . 
  is there a difference between old style vs new style and julian vs gregorian ? 
  the legal entity for grey 's business seems to be ( based on a ` whois ` i did just a moment ago further down the thread ) `` grey industries '' . 
  i 'm sure you can find out what type of business it is online somewhere . 
  i 'm not entirely sure that 's true . 
  there are a few rules that they really enjoy hammering home at every opportunity . 
  most notably the 20 cap on ability scores . 
  the ` whois ` entry says may last year . 
  and yeah , he did say that , but i doubt this would be what he was referring to anyway . 
  ` . fm ` is hardly an unusual suffix . 
  you 've said quite a few times on the show how you do n't see why anyone would start a character at level one , unless they 're brand new to the game . 
  i disagree . 
  i love starting characters at level one . 
  when i write a character backstory , i generally want to write about someone who started out as a common person and was somehow thrown into the world as an inexperienced adventurer . 
  whether it 's because they always wanted to be a hero and finally stumbled across a wizard 's spellbook that they studied to learn the art of wizardry , or they got thrown out on the street and had to start acting as a thief to survive , or anything else . 
  the typical character backstory makes sense as a level 1 character . 
  at least for me , i play d&d ( aside from the social element , obviously ) because i enjoy exploring the character and seeing how they develop as they interact with the other player characters , the npcs , and the world/adventure the dm has created . 
  it 's easiest to do this when i 've been with the character all the way from the beginning . 
  that 's your loss . 
  there 's a lot of great content out there that 's only available in the form of podcasts , and if you 've for some reason made a decision that you just wo n't listen to them , you 're going to have to live with not getting that content . 
  it 's an especially weird stance to have when one considers that they are by far the easiest form of media to consume . 
  you can listen while you commute . 
  while you shop . 
  while you cook meals . 
  while you * eat * meals , if you 're alone . 
  you can easily passively consume them at times when textual or audiovisual content would be either impossible or awkward to consume . 
  that 's not to say that you should necessarily listen to * this * podcast in particular . 
  it 's far from my favourite podcast personally . 
  hell , it 's probably only my * third * favourite * d&d * podcast . 
  but arbitrarily shutting yourself out from the entire medium seems narrow-minded . 
  well , that and the fact that they said `` the four-week murder trial '' . 
  yeah the absence of blood spatter should have been pretty damning evidence against the case . 
  yeah i 'm aware . 
  no idea what the reason is . 
  working on it now . 
  testing ( though i do n't think this will work yet ) :, 
  + / u/parliamentpagebot here [ for speeches ], 
  wtf ? 
  whoops . 
  it 's meant to say `` makes kim jong-un 's speaches ... look plausible in comparison '' . 
  no , that one 's on them . 
  i thought of putting [ sic ] in , but figured that would be a little too pretentious . 
  there 's also `` anytime '' , which should n't be a single word , and `` missleading '' which should only have one s. 
  + / u/parliamentpagebot here [ for notice ], 
  investigating . 
  i have no idea why it 's only working intermittently at the moment , but i 've added in some debugging information so that hopefully the next time it fails i should be able to track down the problem . 
  + / u/parliamentpagebot here [ for notice ], 
  you 're right about healing , but not ability scores . 
  it 's under `` beyond 1st level '' in chapter 1 . 
  features like the barbarian 's capstone are an exception to this general rule . 
  i would suspect that anyone who follows oghma should also be willing to share what they know , though i have n't actually read much about wizards who worship him . 
  mostly just paladins and clerics . 
   also surprising that 20 % of the 5e subreddit does n't mainly play 5e . 
  op submitted this on other subreddits , too . 
  as a regular from / r/samplesize , here are a few tips on the design of your survey , because it 's a rather poorly formatted one in a number of ways . 
  * it 's generally considered good design to include an `` other '' option on gender questions . 
  * likert scale questions ( like your `` i currently play d&d ... '' ) should include the options * in order * , and there should be a logic to the options included . 
  `` always '' does not make sense as an option ( unless you 're asking if someone is in a constant state of playing d&d ? ) . 
  * you 've used radio button questions in a few places where checkboxes would make more sense . 
  some people might play d&d at more than one time of day , or play more than one edition , for example . 
  * you probably should have included at the very least all of the core classes . 
  it probably does n't help that you 've said that fighters are melee ( they do n't have to be ) and rangers are ranged ( they are n't always ) . 
  * there 's no logic to the options you 've included for races . 
  eladrin , drow , and high elves are there , but not wood elves . 
  in addition to including most of the elven subraces , you 've also included an option for `` elf '' . 
  but none of the other races have any subraces mentioned . 
  * it 's generally considered good design to make * almost none * of the questions ** required ** . 
  unless it would utterly destroy the utility of your results , there 's no reason not to allow people to skip questions . 
  indeed , it 's a pretty serious case of sampling bias . 
  not that that 's necessarily a problem per se , it 's just that anyone interpreting results needs to keep in mind that these are a statistically significant representation of d&d ers * who browse d&d subreddits * , and not all d&d ers , or even all d&d redditors . 
  / u/ypresplease does . 
  you should share the results as a csv file or something , so other people can play with them !, 
  i was more addressing the general point you 've brought up quite a few times , that you do n't see why anyone experienced would play from 1st level ( and would instead be better off starting from level 2 or 3 ) , rather than specifically addressing the points you made in * this * episode about getting to top level campaigns . 
  yeah as someone with one foot in the apple system , but mostly outside of it , it was an insanely dull announcement . 
  some * extremely * iterative updates with nothing very interesting at all . 
  even the much-hyped final public word on the apple vs. fbi case prior to the ruling was less inspiring than we had hoped it would be . 
  i think that would be / r/riversandstreams, 
  fun fact : the road not taken is ironic . 
  the point is that there * is n't * actually a difference between the two paths . 
  one is n't `` less travelled by '' , we just like to think there was in hindsight . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  quite a few trolls seem to get a perverse joy out of browsing subreddits for shows they hate just to leave angry comments . 
   the crowd was generally half the parents of the students competing that day, 
  in my experience this is pretty much how * all * high school sports are . 
  students participating , parents/siblings of students participating , and * maybe * some close friends of students participating . 
  i do n't think that 's particularly surprising , actually . 
  the penultimate year of high school or first year of university are times associated with large change in social dynamics , and that 's the time people are most likely to get involved in a new social game . 
  and people tend to be 18 at the start of university , and 16 at the start of the penultimate year of high school . 
  please tell me that you run three games , and not one insanely huge one :o, 
  works fine for me on chrome for android , too . 
  works fine for chrome on android . 
  what browser and os are you using ? 
  this could have used some definitions/pictures , and options for `` no opinion '' . 
  i had to google what half of the options were , particularly `` shave ice '' , `` ice cream bars '' , and `` ice cream bites '' . 
  what 's the difference between a convenience store and a drug store ? 
  i was always under the impression that `` drug store '' was just an american vernacular for convenience store .
