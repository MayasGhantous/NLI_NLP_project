  the try at the end there was a pretty damn clear knock on once you saw the replays . 
  the earlier one was far more dubious . 
  oh right . 
  i assumed we were talking about spell levels , since that 's what op asked about . 
  in that case , the answer is one spell . 
  the actual rule book states :, 
   additionally , when you gain a level in this class , you can choose ** one ** of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list , which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots . 
  emphasis mine . 
  it 's the same with other classes . 
  warlocks , for example , have this wording used for both their spells and invocations . 
  yeah it 's only applicable to spells-known casters . 
  all the cha full casters , the warlock , the third casters , and the ranger . 
  but really , it 's most useful for warlocks , because of the combination of low number of spells known , and the fact that all spells are at the highest level ( so there 's more benefit in removing more low level spells ) . 
  hey , this is a subreddit for sharing stories . 
  you should try resubmitting this at / r/dnd or / r/dndnext . 
  angry gm would be a terrible place to * start * as a dm , because he does n't aim to teach people to go from no dming experience to being good . 
  instead , his aim , and what he 's really good at , is to take people who are already dms at some level , and fix specific problems with the way they 're dming . 
  the clickbaity title you used would have gotten a downvote from me without even watching if i had come across it naturally and not known who he was . 
  which is a shame , because his videos really are absolutely incredible and worth watching for any dm . 
  oh you 're right , technically . 
  i suspect that 's not rai , but it definitely is raw . 
  it 's particularly painful , because the warlock 's 5th level spell selection is especially mediocre . 
  yes , i agree . 
  that 's the intent ( and it 's how people * should * play ) , but because they 've just used the same boilerplate text from all the other classes , a strict rules as * written * interpretation would not allow that . 
  and `` this is a duplicate of another post that only vaguely resembles it '' . 
  i would definitely highly recommend people check out / r/boh5e . 
  their aim is to curate and review the very best homebrew available . 
  stuff has to physically * look * like it belongs in a wizards sourcebook , it has to have some strong thematic reason to exist and , of course , it must be well-balanced . 
  most reviews break things down into each of these , so if you see something you like thematically but just want some second opinions on the mechanics , you can get that easily . 
  i would honestly go so far as to say that * anything * on there is worth at least considering allowing if it fits into your world from a flavour perspective . 
  i feel like the psion could probably have a different hit die depending on their order . 
  the order of the immortal kinda * needs * that d8 hit die , since it 's fairly melee focussed , but the awakened could probably get away with a d6 . 
  i totally get that desire to enthusiastically share the awesome thing you 've found , but unfortunately it does n't cone across very well and people tend to reject it . 
  i think he just means feats with a level requirement on them . 
  kinda like warlocks ' invocations , where some can be grabbed immediately , but for some you have to have a higher level before you can get them . 
  personally , i 'm not a fan of the idea , but it is at least a lot less terrible than feat chains would be . 
  so , just for clarification , you 're saying that there should be race-locked * feats * that are designed to interact with certain thematic subclasses , and that players have the * option * to choose those feats ? 
  not that they 'd get them automatically ? 
  if his reason for banning drow is that he does n't like evil characters , it seems fairly natural that he would also ban tieflings , which have a slight tendency toward evil ( though nowhere near as strong as that of the drow ) . 
  more likely , he just does n't like anything that is n't the most basic generic fantasy . 
  yeah seriously op . 
  we need to verify this !, 
  for anyone interested , beethoven 's [ quartet no . 
  13 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvfc8uckzsk ) was not * quite * the last piece he wrote . 
  the last full piece he composed was his [ quartet no . 
  16 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvoqu481uzq ) . 
  however , after writing that , he did go back and compose a new final movement for no . 
  13 ( replacing the original final movement , which was what became [ die gro\u00dfe fuge ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xezxjw_s0qs ) ) , which is what op has linked to here . 
  that makes this movement the final one he wrote . 
  hear , hear . 
  may he rest in piece . 
  the biggest general thing i would say is just * do n't assume * . 
  do n't assume that things work the way you 're used to . 
  in some cases they might , but in others they do n't . 
  undead are not immune to sneak attacks . 
  most healing spells have no effect on them at all ( they neither heal nor harm ) , but do n't just assume any healing effect does n't affect them . 
  instead , read where the effect comes from . 
  for example cure wounds specifies it does n't affect undead , but healing potions * do not * specify this : they work fine . 
  spells like detect evil & good , and the paladin 's divine sense ability * do not * detect alignment . 
  instead , they specifically detect certain types of creatures , as written in the spell/feature 's description . 
  undead , fiends , celestials , fey , etc. 
  in fact , in the general sense , alignment in 5e is non-mechanical . 
  there are a few exceptions ( mainly high-powered magical items , and the rakshasa monster ) , but for the most part , alignment is purely a convenient way to * describe * how a character will * generally * act . 
  there 's nothing wrong with `` breaking '' alignment from time to time , because perhaps the specific situation necessitated going against the law to save a loved one , even though you 're generally lawful good , or whatever . 
  on a similar note , there are no alignment restrictions on class or race . 
  * in general * paladins who take the oath of devotion will be lg , but they do n't have to be . 
  i think something a lot of people who have come from 3 . x do n't notice is that the game has been really cleverly designed . 
  it takes all the superficial elements from 3 . x with slight modifications , but under the hood it borrows a fair amount from 2e and 4e . 
  the focus on keeping classes well balanced , the removal of mechanical alignment , the vastly simplified skill system , and the approach it takes with healing and resting , and the idea that everyone should be able to do * something * useful at any time ( no more wizards blowing their spell slots and having to resort to crossbows for the rest of the day ) , are all things it 's brought forward ( with improvements ) from 4e , for example . 
  so it 's important that you never assume things work exactly how they 're used to , and largely treat it like a new system . 
  i can see where they 're coming from -- as in , the similarities are clear once it 's pointed out -- but i do n't think i 'd have drawn the comparison on my own . 
   nobody plays humans anymore, 
  that 's unfortunate . 
  it definitely has n't been the experience my group has had . 
  since switching to 5e , out of about 14 player characters we 've had , about 6 were humans . 
  and another 4 have been dwarves , elves , or half-elves , so the basic really common races make up the vast majority of our playing experience . 
  part of it is the fact that we play a very story-oriented game , so there 's a strong internal incentive to play a human for some sense of groundedness , and keeping with the world 's majority-human demographics . 
  another part of it is probably the fact that humans get that extra feat early on . 
  yes , he was working on other things . 
  i know he had basic sketches for a tenth symphony , but i do n't think he was seriously working on it . 
  he did have other compositions more earnestly in process . 
  they 're tough , but `` not a good idea at all '' ? 
  nah , that definitely is n't accurate . 
  they 're tough but far from impossible , and they 're really useful ( or even necessary ) for a huge range of university courses . 
  engineering requires hl physics , medicine wants hl chemistry ( and bio is a convenient extra ) , etc. 
  to be fair , he 's compensating for that maths hl with itgs :p, 
  since you do n't travel much , here are some tips for the flight . 
  drink a heap of water before getting on the plane ( ca n't take any with you * on * the plane because of security theatre ) . 
  planes are really dry , and the service never brings enough around . 
  you 'll probably want a window seat on the way there , because it 's tour first time nd you 'll want the view . 
  but on the way back , an aisle seat might be a decent idea , especially if you 're tall . 
  you can spill your legs out into the aisle just a little , for a bit of extra legroom . 
  the food on aeroplanes is every bit as terrible as the jokes you 've no doubt heard . 
  i like to bring some lollies ( sorry -- * sweets * , in the uk , that 's candy to an american ) and chocolates , since these are okay with security and with customs at the other end , in a way that other foods might not always be . 
  when you 're there , be aware that chips means what you call fries , and what you call chips are referred to as crisps . 
  always stand to the side on escalators , especially at tube stations . 
  i ca n't remember which side it is , but just follow others and you 'll be fine . 
  ** never , ever ** block the path . 
  many great attractions , including most museums ( the british national museum , famous , among other things , for being home to the rosetta stone , included ) have free entry , so they 're a great way to spend a day or so . 
  london is one of the great cities for both theatre and music in the world ( arguably second only to new york in both respects ) .
