  seriously ? 
  you think that [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/yq2bcxhesow?t=49s ) was a quality performance ? 
  rewatching it now , i have to say that the last quarter or so of that clip makes me think i 've seen * better * performances in high school plays . 
  / r/borderlessinternet is a service that you can ( or at least could -- not sure if that deal is still going ) get for free until july . 
  it seems to work pretty well . 
  used to go down for a few hours a couple of times per week , but i have n't noticed that much recently . 
  hey , just a tip , if you prefix each line with ''  '' , it 'll appear as proper greentext . 
  you can see [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced greentext formatting tips . 
  it 's your full stop that messed it up here . 
  it 's currently parsing `` here . 
  '' , when it 's expecting `` here '' . 
  edit : i 've fixed how it deals with punctuation . 
  you do n't need to worry about it in the future . 
  just a tip , you can get nicer looking paragraph breaks by inserting '' *** '' on a line . 
  see [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more detail . 
  the what ? 
  oh , and there i was thinking it was a weirdly worded avatar reference ... 
  rogues are n't the only people that can deal with traps . 
  anyone can spot a trap and try to avoid setting it off , anyone can deliberately set off a trap from a distance with a spell or arrow . 
  hell , anyone can even have * some * chance of disarming the trap , though a rogue will certainly have an easier time of that last aspect . 
  just make sure that you add traps that make sense . 
  do n't just randomly pepper them around like some old school dungeon crawl . 
  think about what the location there in is for , who is using the place/living in it , what kind of traps make sense for that combination , and where those traps would logically be placed . 
  something that no one else has already mentioned is that 5e is * already * stupidly mobile . 
  you can , for some reason , run literal circles around an enemy without provoking an opportunity attack . 
  making it even more mobile would be * insane * . 
  and yet somehow , despite how insanely mobile it already is , taking * one single step * backwards away from an enemy provokes opportunity attacks . 
  the first tableau should use `` a '' instead of `` the '' , the first time the half-orc is mentioned . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of the expanded spell list . 
  command , shield , compulsion , and dominate person all feel very out of place for something of draconic origin , and stinking cloud , fire shield , and cloudkill seem like they should only be appropriate to one particular type of draconic origin . 
  the others are great fits . 
  hoard sense and ancient 's breath both work fine . 
  i particularly like the fact that you 've used ancient 's breath in a way that looks superficially similar to the dragonborn 's breath weapon , but is mechanically different enough that it does n't bring up questions of how the two interact with one another . 
  blood of dragons is perfect . 
  fits brilliantly with the other warlock level 10 features and with the draconic theme . 
  the way it interacts with spells and effects that deal half damage is a nice little flair . 
  likewise , draconic apotheosis is really cool . 
  the only thing missing is a description of how a character may choose to end the effect early , which is n't a huge deal . 
  the art is exemplary , as we have come to expect from your work , with one rather unfortunate but notable exception . 
  the main character portrait stands out quite noticeably to me . 
  it 's still extremely good , and if it were anyone else , i would n't bother pointing it out , but it does feel slightly odd compared to the other artwork in this . 
   5e does n't mention anything about eladrins, 
  as the other guy said , eladrins are in the dmg . 
   warlocks do n't get to chose to cast spells at a lower level ; at 6th level , a warlock is only going to have 3rd level spell slots, 
  not if they 've multiclassed . 
  the way it is at the moment works better for multiclassing . 
   no one wants to roll seven d4s . 
  make it d8s , or maybe d10s, 
  i see where you 're coming from , but the way it is at the moment has a really nice synergy with draconic apotheosis . 
  maybe if it were 2d6 + 1d6 for each level above 1st , that would be better . 
  a straight warlock would then cap out at 6d6 , which is pretty reasonable , compared to 11d4 . 
  the problem with that is that it 'd be substantially weaker , but if you changed it to adding 2d6 per level you wind up with something that is just as unwieldy , but which is far too much * stronger * . 
  making it 2d8 + 1d8 would make it * slightly * stronger than the d4 option early on ( `` early on '' being using 3rd level slots -- if a multiclassed warlock uses 1st level slots , the d8 option is much stronger ) , but it would fall in line later on . 
  i fully agree that scaling up to 11 dice at level 9 is a bit insane , and using higher dice would help remedy that . 
  the issue is finding some combination that ( a ) uses only one kind of die ( for the sake of simplicity ) and ( b ) feels reasonably well balanced at all spell slot levels , both with and without draconic apotheosis applied . 
  two half-orcs ? 
  i count one half-orc , one dwarf , and one eladrin . 
  though i must say , it could have been cool to see one of the tableaux be dragonborn . 
  patrons do n't get invocations . 
  at least , they have n't so far . 
  invocations are only locked by choice of * pact * and by level . 
  that 's not to say that the idea of patron-locked invocations is a terrible one , just that it 's unprecedented , and would have to be done only with an extremely good reason . 
  sure , that makes some sense when worded like that , but the problem is it does n't make sense . 
  you can spend * all * of your movement . 
  you could move ** 70 ** feet if you were a wood elf and used the dash action , and somehow that does n't provoke opportunity attacks . 
  there 's no way you 're moving over 20 metres in 6 seconds while still keeping up your guard . 
  and at the same time , if you * can * do that , there 's no way that someone * could n't * take just one or two steps back carefully but still be able to attack . 
  we 're not talking about getting 30 feet , just 5 . 
  it 's an option that 3 . x includes as a `` 5-foot step '' and 4e includes as a `` slide '' ( from memory ) , and those editions had it because it * made sense * . 
  i understand that wizards changed things in 5e to make combat more mobile , more fluid , since in previous editions moving more than just 5 feet even around an opponent would provoke opportunity attacks , and i respect that , but i have a hard time justifying it logically . 
  very good point . 
  at least personally , i am far more familiar with miller 's works than i\u00f1\u00e1rritu 's . 
  i 've seen zero of the latter 's films , and only heard of two . 
  the former , in addition to just straight up having done * more * stuff , has done more that i personally am familiar with . 
  or even more appropriately , / r/dndgreentext . 
   thank you 5th edition, 
  thank you * 4th * edition . 
  4e brought a ** lot ** of good to the game , and thankfully 5e kept most of that stuff . 
  anyone that likes this kind of thing should visit / r/dndgreentext for a place where these stories are a bit more appropriate . 
  the [ hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) is probably the best place to start . 
  not true . 
  it has n't been called `` mac os x '' since 2012 , when they officially dropped the `` mac '' from its name . 
  currently , it 's just called `` os x '' . 
   was n't mac os x called `` x '' because it 's the roman number for `` 10 '' ? 
  yes . 
  that 's why it 's called `` oh ess ten '' . 
  it makes about as much sense as 10 following on from 8.1 . 
  or referring to 6.3 as 8.1 . 
  definitely this . 
  i 've learnt far more about faer\u00fbn through novels than i ever would have with a campaign setting . 
  pick a book that touches upon something that interests you within the world and go from there . 
  if it 's the underdark , a drizzt novel is probably not a bad idea . 
  if it 's magic and wizards , elminster 's a good place to start . 
  if you like devils and the hells , grab a brimstone angels book . 
  i might also suggest audiobooks as a good way to do this , since you can be doing your research at times that you 'd otherwise be occupied with mundane tasks like commuting or cooking . 
   world cup of football -- or soccer , for you, 
  curious brady . 
  as an australian , but one who has lived in the uk for quite some time , do you find `` football '' or `` soccer '' is the more natural term for you ? 
  as an aussie myself , but one who lived overseas from age 10 to about 18 , soccer has always been the word i 've used , and referring to it as `` football '' just would never even occur to me . 
   notice they had a teenage girl with them .
