  about 14, 
   they have sex, 
   a small buff in median damage, 
  it 's actually a * very * tiny nerf in expected value at high levels ( [ 27.5 vs 27.0 ] ( http://anydice.com/program/803c ) ) . 
  it 's a * large * buff in expected value at level 1 spell slots ( [ 7.5 vs 9.0 ] ( http://anydice.com/program/803d ) ) , but since it 's a warlock , 3rd level slots are more likely the realistic minimum , in which case it 's a small buff ( [ 17.5 vs 18.0 ] ( http://anydice.com/program/803e ) ) . 
  one interesting thing about this is that it creates a much easier comparison between this and burning hands . 
  burning hands starts out at 3d6 and adds 1d6 each slot level , and does n't add anything . 
  comparing the two options , ancient 's breath is just straight up better . 
  using a first level spell slot , [ e [ ab ] is 12.0 ( assuming a modifier of +3 ) , while e [ bh ] is 10.5 ] ( http://anydice.com/program/803f ) . 
  at 3rd level slots , [ e [ ab ] is 22.0 ( assuming +4 ) , while e [ bh ] is only 17.5 ] ( http://anydice.com/program/8041 ) . 
  at 5th level slots , [ the expected values are 31.0 and 24.5 , respectively ] ( http://anydice.com/program/8042 ) , assuming +4 . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what to make of this , to be honest . 
  is it overpowered , or is it okay because of its lower availability ? 
  i do n't know that i 'm qualified to make that decision . 
  another possibility would be to start with 1d10 + cha and add 1d10 per spell level . 
  with this system , it would be [ weaker than bh with 1st level slots ] ( http://anydice.com/program/8044 ) , [ equal but swingier on 2nd level slots ] ( http://anydice.com/program/8043 ) , and [ it overtakes bh at 3rd level slots ] ( http://anydice.com/program/8045 ) . 
  that , to me , feels quite a bit nicer . 
  it 's normal for spells with a `` base '' level that 's higher to be more efficient than scaling up lower level spells . 
  so even if this ability were to technically have a base level of 1st level slots , having it come into its own in terms of efficiency at the same level of spell slots available to a pure warlock when they first get the ability feels nicer . 
  yet another possibility would be to require it expend a 3rd level or higher spell slot , and start at 4d8 + cha . 
  cutting off the time when ab is a straight up better option than bh . 
  but i am * far * from an expert in these matters . 
  i 'm definitely not confident that all this is all correct . 
  well , except for the fact that i speak neither spanish nor portuguese :p, 
  yeah but europe and half of australia have that bullshit going on , too . 
  looks like quite a few people want the wives on the show as guests . 
  also , both `` two dudes talking '' and `` grey and brady '' ( or similar ) are looking very popular for reasons to listen . 
  wtf are the 44 `` other '' computing devices people are listening on ? 
  edit : wait , there was no option for ipods or other mp3 players ( or `` smart '' mp3 players like the ipod touch ) . 
  that 's probably where they 're coming from . 
  yay for good survey design !, 
  could someone explain this to me ? 
  it feels like a reference to something , but nearest i can find is that `` sempi '' means `` teacher 's assistant '' ( though that 's just based on urban dictionary , so i do n't exactly hold it in high regard ... ) . 
  you 're just upset that queenslanders are better at league than you are . 
  hmm ... 
  separate options for east and southeast asians , but no option for pacific islanders , aboriginal australians , maori , etc. 
  are those supposed to just be lumped under `` black '' ? 
  okay , i * love * the heat . 
  the current weather in * brisbane * is starting to get * too cold * for me . 
  but 45 degrees is insane . 
  this is why you 're not top tim . 
  to be fair , you 're trying to be a soccer fan in a country with literally 3 better codes of football . 
   i swear it was my players fault !, 
   teenager wakes up, 
   immediately tries to seduce him, 
  i believe it 's the first one , making of a mage , where he 's turned into elmara . 
  i quite liked that book , and i liked myth drannor a little less but it was still good . 
  but to be honest , the third book , the temptation of elminster , i straight up hated , so i gave up on the series there . 
  i never got to elminster in hell . 
  is it worth going back to the series and picking up the 4th one ? 
  urgh fucking slyfox single-handedly ruined korra season 4 . 
  that raises two questions :, 
  is sempi just an alternate transliteration of senpai ? 
  ~ ~ what has any of that got to do with grey 's coffee anger ? ~ ~, 
  just saw your ninja edit . 
  it answers the second question . 
  the rune mage is a good suggestion , but i do n't really think modern magic counts , on since it is specifically * modern * magic , which is so fundamentally different from what most people are after in a normal d&d world . 
  if i had to guess , i 'd say she 's filipino or indonesian . 
  yeah i saw some of your comments elsewhere in the thread regarding shield . 
  i 've been convinced it 's definitely a good fit . 
  but i 'm still unconvinced regarding the charms . 
  i 've never really known dragons to be particularly hypnotic . 
  their followers and subjects , at least in my mind , tend to be so largely out of fear , or the hope of obtaining power themselves , rather than because their minds are being manipulated . 
  on reddit , to create separate paragraphs , you need to put a blank line in between each . 
  this * includes * within blockquotes ( which is what we use here on / r/dndgreentext for the greentext ) . 
  urgh no . 
  we 've already had that in the form of [ a star wars parody film ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhtn8cjm9zm ) and [ a lord of the rings/generic medieval fantasy satire web series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv3dednxn4o&amp;list=pljsmfxysojxotca_nrjym54icmsmmcygg ) . 
  i think it 's about time we got something that takes things a touch more seriously . 
  looks great now .

  careful now , do n't go conflating the infinite layers of the abyss with the nine hells of baator . 
  asmodeus would * not * be happy to have himself compared with the chaotic demons of the abyss . 
  but thanks , i 'll probably give elminster another go once i 'm finished with the series i 'm on at the moment . 
  pretty sure it 's loosse, 
  and , of course , we have to assume that google has * way * more valuable information than target . 
   health per level for both the barbarian and ranger is still 7 + con mod, 
  that 's correct , but it 's a true 7 , instead of a rounded 6.5 , which means anyone that rolls with 2d6 will get , on average , better results ( though far less swingy ones ) than 1d12 . 
  agreed . 
  this was one of the worst bits of the ua ranger imo . 
  2d4 would be a far more reasonable solution to allow it the greater healing flexibility without overpowering it . 
  i 'm disappointed that no one seemed to suggest one of the things that was my biggest suggestion back when the ua ranger was fresh , and at that time it got some fairly positive feedback . 
  make * marking * a core feature . 
  treat hunter 's mark like the paladin 's divine smite . 
  make it a class feature , not a spell . 
  and then give the ranger access to a bunch of alternative mark-like spells ( or even spells which alter the way the hunter 's mark functions -- to prevent stacking in the way smites can be ) that do slightly different more specific things . 
  for example , maybe there 's one that does n't grant increased damage , but gives your mark disadvantage on attacks against anyone other than you ( or gives you advantage to hit them ) , or maybe there 's one that 's useful for larger quantities of enemies but only grants 1d4 extra damage against each of them ( and can only be reapplied to other creatures when the last of the marks drops to 0 ) , etc. 
  p.s. , you wrote `` rouge '' over and over again . 
  rouge is french for red ( and a type of makeup ) . 
  the word you 're looking for is `` rogue '' . 
  true . 
  and if it 's a single big bad , the paladin can always just choose not to use the ability in that case . 
  or the casters could use abilities that force saving throws instead of require attack rolls . 
  what was the exact wording used ? 
  maybe she was thinking of playing around with cyphers . 
  like , creating and cracking codes ? 
  no it does n't . 
  it gives * very * slightly higher than a d8 . 
  an average of 5 compared to an average of 4.5 . 
  if you `` take the average '' , they give the same . 
  it 's obviously still less than the current 1d10 , but it makes up for that a little by being able to get substantially more healing , thanks to adding the con mod twice .
