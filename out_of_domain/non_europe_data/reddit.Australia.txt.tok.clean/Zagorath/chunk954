  they included it as a class feature , but as far as i could tell they did n't really do much else with it . 
  and no worries . 
  the rouge-rogue switch is an amusing one , and extremely common for some reason . 
   such as the whole `` standing up '' debacle in his initiative video, 
  probably because that was n't actually the point of his video , and he was n't really * wrong * about that bit , either . 
  the spell in question , thunderwave , * does n't * knock people prone . 
  the dm just added some fluff saying it knocked them down , but chose not to apply any mechanical effect to that . 
  he mentioned as such in a reply to the top comment . 
  and even if it did knock them prone , they can easily stand up and move anyway , since standing up only costs half your movement , and the spell pushes people back 10 feet within a 15-foot cone . 
  a standard 30 ft. movement human can easily get there after standing up . 
  of course , this does n't change the fact that his * main * point was , quite simply , a bit naff . 
  it 's an interesting point , and it is a minor flaw of the d&d system that the system he seems to prefer does n't suffer from . 
  but it 's a worthwhile flaw to have for the sake of a quick combat . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltmqp9u8ewk ) is far worse in my opinion , because he completely misinterprets what `` hit '' actually means in the context of d&d . as one of the comments there says :, 
   i 'll admit it 's misnamed , but in reality it does n't mean `` make contact with '' , it means `` hit in a meaningful way '' . 
  if someone has high ac due to heavy armour , then it means that you 're far more likely to have your blows strike the armour and not really hurt . 
  on the other hand , if someone has high ac due to high dexterity , it is literally saying that they 're good at dodging and avoiding blows . 
  and i personally am not a fan of [ this vido ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf8uu4pqefk ) of his , and i tend to prefer the [ angry dm 's advice on this matter ] ( http://theangrygm.com/five-simple-rules-for-dating-my-teenaged-skill-system/ ) . 
  though i do see some merit in his idea . 
  grey , i just want to say thank you * so much * for your description of national identity . 
  it just so perfectly sums up how i feel about the whole thing . 
  i moved from australia to korea at age 10 , and then to vietnam at 13 . 
  only moved back to australia at 18 . 
  my `` home '' country does n't really feel like a true home , but nor could i ever even come close to feeling like a true local in vietnam , considering i do n't even speak the same language . 
   i 'm a bit homeless , but it does n't matter because people overvalue national identities anyway . 
  in the end i feel like someone who grew up in x and is just a person in the world . 
  so beautifully worded . 
  i 've struggled for ages to put into words how i feel about it , and this really helps . 
  i 've never understood this viewpoint . 
  the idea that one would just stop watching videos/reading posts/whatever from someone just because they disagree with a political stance the person has . 
  lindy comes across as a pretty staunch conservative . 
  he 's a `` climate skeptic '' ( or at least , was in 2009 , the last time he made a video on the subject ) , and i 've noted quite frequently that he 's kinda subtly sexist ( though he colours it in `` historical fact '' and `` science '' ) , and he 's also put out at least one video against progressive taxation . 
  all of these are things that i completely and fundamentally disagree with lindy on . 
  but i watch him anyway , because as you say , his stuff about weapons and armour are great , and his rpg stuff is at least interesting , even when i disagree . 
  and those things make up a much , * much * larger percentage of his videos than the sexist/conservative stuff . 
  in fact , until this thread reminded me of that stuff ( leading to me going back to double check it ) , i ca n't even * remember * the last time i came across one of these videos from him . 
  for another example , i used to watch a youtuber who made news videos . 
  i watched him for a * long * time , even though the guy supported the absolute nutter gary johnson for the 2012 us federal election , he was against sensible gun laws , and he was a supporter ( albeit a relatively weak one ) of the death penalty . 
  but those things rarely came up on the show , so i kept watching . 
  at least until i eventually either grew out of the format , or perhaps the format changed subtly that i no longer enjoyed it . 
  this idea that seems to be very popular on the internet , that if we disagree with a person in a couple of ways , we have to completely reject everything they do on fundamental moral grounds , just seems absurd to me . 
  i agree , i want my 0.006462871 % , and not a cent less !, 
  well you had better change the banner to make it completely legit . 
  people might think you 're kidding them , otherwise . 
  not a fan of the prime directive , eh ? 
  now * that * is something i would really like to see elaborated upon on the next hello internet . 
  i had no idea you could even make two lettered subreddits . 
  always thought the minimum was 3 characters . 
  who the eff am i ? 
  edit :, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfon3bbv-gi oh ... huh . 
  cool, 
  [ this is who ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfon3bbv-gi ) . 
  someone needs to send this thread to cgp grey and brady haran of hello internet . 
  cyclists would rather not take the lane * because it annoys other road users * . 
  what fucked up logic is going through your mind where you want to insult cyclists for * doing what is convenient for other people on the road *, 
  oh yeah , totally . 
  i 'm not criticising you here . 
  i think that what you 've done in this thread is an obvious and important thing to try , in response to the previous thread . 
  it 's just that i missed the previous thread , so i 'm using this more recent one to voice my more general thoughts . 
   tasmania now belongs to nz, 
  this was n't already the case ? 
  you are aware , of course , that ( a ) bikes have a negligible effect on the road surface , and ( b ) the cost of managing a registration system for bikes would cost more than it would bring in . 
  not to mention , where would you * put * a licence plate ? 
  ca n't go on the back just under the seat , because that 's where lights and reflectors go , not to mention often those little maintenance kits . 
  ca n't have the plate reduce safety . 
  and all that is aside from the basic fact that even if you * could * solve all these problems , it 's * still * a bad idea because it would decrease the amount of people who ride bikes , which has a negative economic effect ( as cyclists place a lower burden on average on healthcare systems than non-cyclists , they reduce road maintenance costs since they 're not driving enormous vehicles around that destroy roads , they decrease the amount of traffic on the road , etc. ) . 
  given that you know all this ( as i assume you to be at least a moderately intelligent woman , and it 's all fairly intuitive stuff ) , could you please explain why you are still in favour of cyclist rego ? 
  they do the best they can , but when the demographic is `` people with landlines who can answer during the day '' , that in itself is a sample that 's not enormously representative of the entire population , and there 's only so much they can do to overcome it . 
  well one thing is that you do n't even need to * have * a license to ride . 
  how does it make sense that a cyclist who has a driving license should be penalised for a * cycling * infraction more than a cyclist who does n't drive . 
  the two are unrelated activities , so why should a person 's activity in one affect the other ? 
  except that if it were only cyclists , the road would never need to be repaved . 
  the amortised cost of cyclists is near zero . 
  with cars , trucks , etc. , it is substantial . 
  the 10 % upfront expenditure is nowhere near representative of the actual cost . 
  not to mention that it 's not like they 're making all roads 10 % wider to do this . 
  rfid 's not a bad idea to replace license plates , but you still have the problem that * administering * licensing would cost * far * more than it 's worth . 
  and it still defeats the purpose anyway . 
  you ca n't `` just nab them when they go through a red light '' , because who 's going to be doing the nabbing ? 
  is there going to be a cop on every intersection ? 
  as for your last paragraph . 
  hahahahaha . 
  i ca n't believe it took me this long to figure out that you 're clearly not being serious . 
  because if you were , you would need to take a * serious * look in the mirror . 
  well played miss , you really had me going there . 
  see , this is the thing i just do n't get . 
  this closed-mindedness that you just ca n't watch something from someone who disagrees with you about unrelated things . 
  i know this is a joke , but honestly it 's why i 've always thought that bards were kinda a dumb concept . 
  if their magic was just buffs , debuffs , and charms , that would be okay , but they 've got spells that do damage , heal , throw enemies around the battlefield , and various other things that just do n't make sense to me . 
  yeah vicious mockery i 'm okay with because of how hitpoints are an abstraction and it 's doing psychic damage . 
  it 's spells like thunderwave , unseen servant , heat metal , shatter , silence , etc. 
  that bother me . 
  they 're spells that just do n't make sense to me with the explanation you provided . 
  hey , this is an absolutely fantastic resource , but it does n't belong here on / r/unearthedarcana . 
  this subreddit is specifically for homebrew material . 
  things like extra classes and races , variant rule options , etc. 
  you should probably submit this at / r/dndnext though . 
  they 're the best place for discussions of d&d rules . 
  in terms of formatting , this leaves a lot to be desired .
