  you did n't give it a class table at the top and instead kinda awkwardly shoved in a thing down at the bottom of the second page . 
  you 've got features leaking into the third ( off-page ) column on the first page , so pirate garb 's body and the entirety of extra attack are unreadable . 
  you never explicitly give it asis . 
  it 's in the table , but not in the body . 
  you used the wrong type of heading for the class title , resulting in the giant drop cap a that does n't belong there . 
  there 's an unnecessary apostrophe in `` 100 's of years '' , and you did n't capitalise the g in dungeon master 's guide . 
  thematically i like it quite a lot more than i expected to . 
  mechanically , / u/m2viids has you covered . 
  that puts you at , according to this survey , the 97th percentile of hi listeners . 
  how does it feel to be the 3 % ? 
   when the census ( whose name escapes me ) reported that the majority of gamers were actually women in their 20s and 30s, 
  ehh ... these censi are dubious at best . 
  they tend to count `` gamers '' as anyone who plays any type of game . 
  but the fact is most people * do n't * think of that definition when they hear the term `` gamer '' . 
  they think people playing a slightly more hardcore type of game . 
  fps , rts , rpg , mmo , etc. 
  it 's difficult to create a definitive distinction in certain areas , but the basic idea that the majority of casual phone games should n't count towards whether or not one is a `` gamer '' still stands . 
  i believe it 's been mentioned on one of these podcasts , even . 
  the surveys are certainly very interesting for other reasons and there 's a lot of interesting discussion to be had and conclusions to be reached as a result , but to say that `` a majority of gamers are women '' is misleading . 
  [ reddit 's official stance ] ( https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183225-audience-and-demographics ) is that the demographics are 53/47 , * extremely * equal . 
  which of course raises the question , whence comes the disparity in hi ? 
  * is it actually that hi listeners are grossly disproportionately men ? 
  * is it that hi listeners who also use reddit are disproportionately men ? 
  * perhaps it 's only hi listeners who browse * this * subreddit . 
  * or perhaps it 's a result of self-selection bias : women are less likely to fill out this survey for some reason . 
  i 'd consider that last one fairly unlikely , since [ it has been established ] ( http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ed501717.pdf ) that in general , women are more likely to participate in surveys than men , though perhaps there 's something about online surveys in particular that changes that ( or makes them more likely to fill out incorrect information ) . 
  really , it 's hard to say what the reason is . 
  if i had to hazard a guess , i 'd say it comes in between bullets two and three , and that the * actual * demographics of hi are probably pretty equal , but that the intersection between listeners and redditors who browse this subreddit is highly skewed . 
  but that 's really just a guess . 
  this is how my table does things , too . 
  personally , i think of enthral 's verbal and somatic components as * being * the spell . 
  you 're doing something that enthrals them , and compels them to watch , rather than casting a spell and saying abrakedabra , and * then * distracting them . 
  the fact that they fail their wis save represents the fact that they fell for your trick . 
  it 's easy to think of enthral as being not so much a `` spell '' as just trickery . 
  it 's just that this conversation has already been had on cortex ( i think -- might 've been hi ) . 
  i ca n't remember exactly which episode it was . 
  i 'd suggest takaing a look at the shownotes for the last 5-10 episodes of cortex . 
  no , do n't worry about that . 
  i 've already taken care of it . 
  the problem is i think that 's an incredibly lame premise . 
  just a matter of taste , i suppose , like how some people do n't like gnomes or halflings . 
  is this fact true for both chromatic and metallic dragons , or only chromatics ? 
  wait , we have funnelwebs ? 
   you still must complete 150 hours of cas, 
  sigh ... no , this is not the case , and it has n't been for quite some time . 
   i believe they now stand for creativity , action , and service, 
  have n't they always ? 
   she did not explicitly tell me we had to complete 150 hours of cas - 50 for creativity , 50 for action and 50 for service, 
  that 's because you do n't . 
  i 'm not sure if this was * ever * true , but it definitely has n't been true since at least classes graduating may 2011 . 
  hey !, 
  aww that 's cute . 
  you think you could go mad with power in a subreddit with 8 members . 
  you got ta get yourself some * real * power before that starts happening . 
  yeah it 's a well-known bug . 
  ca n't remember if it 's with imgur , or reddit , or res , or one of the mobile apps though . 
  basically , you want to link to imgur.com/gallery/string , but it takes you to imgur.com/string , which is a single image that 's completely unrelated to the gallery you wanted to share . 
  could someone explain what 's going on here ? 
  like , is this an omegle-like app or something ? 
  wait , is dark cloud not available in australia ? 
  and there i was considering buying a ps4 just to be able to go back and replay it ... 
  ungoanam just dropped to 155 . 
  does anyone know why apeetrcar and ungoanam are n't merging ? 
  both have been waiting to merge for a long time now , and they have 160 and 155 users , respectively . 
  thanks . 
  not just entrees , drinks and main meals , too . 
  they 're just a very private restaurant . 
  ungoanam merged into goakstpeda, 
  the other party was ungoanam ( 151 , i believe ) . 
  we 've currently got 77 no voters with 17 minutes to go . 
  edit : make that 65 no voters , 1 abandon with 9 minutes to go . 
  no , there is n't , at least by the ibo 's rules . 
  though unfortunately , some cas coordinators run cas * extremely * badly , and you 'll need to conform to their requirements , since they are the ones that decide to pass you or not . 
  the * current * character has plot armour , because the dm does n't want the player playing a drow . 
  you 've just quoted something that works directly against your argument . 
  ** there are good drow ** . 
  drizzt is one example , but the passage specifically points out that there are others . 
  a player can play a good drow without breaking canon . 
  indeed , playing against your race or class 's stereotype can frequently be very interesting . 
  seriously . 
  how has it taken * this * long for somebody to point this out ? 
  yes , the vast majority of drow are evil . 
  but the vast majority of people in a d&d world are not adventurers . 
  ** by definition , the player characters are the exception . 
  ** playing against stereotypes can make for some of the most interesting characters . 
  the intelligent barbarian , the strong halfling , the kind fiend warlock , etc. 
  can all make for really interesting characters . 
  playing a good member of a race that is normally evil is interesting . 
  not to mention , restricting things goes completely against the ethos of 5th edition , which has alignment as * descriptive * of * trends * , and not absolutes . 
  wait what 's the relation between a writers ' strike and wesley ? 
  this is absolutely true . 
  when you account for education , field , experience , and job description , the gap shrinks to something like 98 cents on the dollar . 
  small enough to be ignored . 
  but that does n't mean the wage gap is worth ignoring in general . 
  there are societal factors at play that we should try and work towards fixing . 
  the easiest one to point at is that women are socially conditioned to be less likely to ask for raises , and less likely to go after promotions . 
  in some fields , they may even be less likely to be * accepted * for promotions when they * do * ask . 
  this would show up on statistics as them doing a lesser job , and thus `` deserving '' the lesser pay , when in fact they have n't been given the opportunity to `` deserve '' it . 
  a step down in terms of how big an issue it is , is the wider idea of women choosing fields and jobs that pay less . 
  this is still an issue to some extent because it 's based on what they 're encouraged to do all through childhood , schooling , and to an extent university .
