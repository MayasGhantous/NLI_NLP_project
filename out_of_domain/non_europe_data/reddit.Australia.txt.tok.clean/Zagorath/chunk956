  but this is less of an issue because it 's not something that clearly affects the individual ( any given woman has made the decision not to go into stem fields ) , but is relevant on a more societal level . 
  i have a bot that could probably be used to tag people if everyone was added to a page on a subreddit wiki . 
  we normally use it for paging people for votes and debates in / r/modelparliament . 
  the issue is that we 'd need to get a wiki page to contain every member that needs to be paged . 
  and for that we 'd need a subreddit that we can use . 
   itunes is rather annoying to access, 
  ftfy, 
  but he 's playing wagner , not beethoven . 
  3 , movement 2 , `` marcia funebre : adagio assai '' ] ( https://youtu.be/6l_bpmjifv4 ) was played in early civilisation games when you annihilated another civ completely . 
  the first time i came across this , the music hit me so hard i resolved not to repeat that . 
  just so incredibly visceral it 's impossible not to be moved by it . 
  i 'm also very partial to [ the second movement of his 7th symphony ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h-ysx8ltfc ), 
  and , of course [ adagio for string , by samuel barber ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izqsge0l450 ) is always worth mentioning . 
  it has often been called the saddest piece of all time . 
  [ the death of ase , from the peer gynt suite ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2akxf1h5r4g ) is the last one i 'll mention . 
  probably the least well-known of the four pieces in the suite ( which also includes `` morning mood '' and `` in the hall of the mountain king '' ) , but one of my favourites . 
  [ this was discussed recently on r/dnd ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dnd/comments/4cqg0t/lindybeige_discusses_a_form_of_metagaming_in_dd/ ) , if anyone is interested to read the comments from then . 
  roleplaying games are what they say on the box . 
  it 's about roleplaying a character . 
  your character would n't know exactly how high he has to roll in order to succeed at something , so there 's no reason for the player to know . 
  this is especially important because there could be factors that the player does n't know about that would alter their chances : for example , the target of their attack might cast a shield spell . 
  except for eisenluthor . 
  he was really more of a chaotic character . 
   one the easiest ways to fix this is to discuss with your colleagues what your salary is . 
  the societal norm that makes this taboo should be ignored , it only benefits the employer, 
  hear , hear !, 
  if you say `` est '' during summer months , that most certainly is * not * unambiguous . 
  especially shortly after the switch , it could easily be used to mean `` going on normal time '' , rather than daylight time . 
  edt is both correct and unambiguous . 
  of course , all of this would be moot if the world would just get rid of the damn thing . 
  it literally costs * lives * every year , for either a tiny gain or tiny loss in terms of energy expenditure ( depending on the study -- either way , it 's tiny ) . 
  that 's without going into the economic loss due to tired workers and communication difficulties . 
  better question , do we really want the sun setting at * nine o'clock at night * that 's an insane time for it to still be bright . 
  hells , even 8 's pretty extreme already . 
  yes please do this people . 
  i 'm over here at utc +10 ( est in australia ) and when you say something 's happening at 10am pacific i have * no * idea what you 're talking about . 
  most of the world is the same . 
  everyone can easily convert if you tell us what time it is as a utc offset . 
  it clears up any and all ambiguity , since a time given as a utc offset does n't change . 
  i tend to associate it with the eponymous speech in the king 's speech . 
  the introit straddles the line between sad and creepy , and the agnus dei is pretty damn sad , too . 
  in their defence , * nobody * gets this one right . 
  i mean , even better would be if they 'd just tell you the time in utc itself . 
  but yeah , at least telling us the * offset * would hurt nobody . 
  the reason is arseholes who think imperial is better and anyone who thinks otherwise should he downvoted . 
  they are less likely to reflexively downvote with the hover over . 
  i 'm not doing honours , because i started before that came in , but from what i gather not much has changed . 
  i love the course personally . 
  there 's a grand total of three real maths classes ( linear algebra & calculus 1 , multivariate calculus , and statistics ) , plus one super easy course that 's technically maths ( discrete maths ) . 
  the three real ones are pretty tough , but everything else is pretty easy as far as maths goes . 
  the main programming courses have a great progression , starting with the basics in python , then learning object-oriented techniques at the same time as going back to basics and learning logic gates . 
  a lot of great electives available too . 
  a few of personal favourites have been security , web information systems , and whatever the one joel fenwick taught was called . 
  csse2310 , i think . 
  that one 's hard , but super rewarding , and he is hands down the best lecturer at uq . 
  least favourite courses , ai , because the lecturer was a disorganised mess , and two team projects ( not the ones officially named `` team project '' , though , those are okay ) , one of which had the entire class of like 200 working on a single game with zero direction or oversight ( i believe they 've since fixed that course ) and one which was `` build some wearable technology '' , which had only the tiniest amount of actual programming in it , and was done in conjunction with designy type people . 
  i ca n't say how it is in comparison to qut , because i do n't know their curriculum , but i really do think uq has a great software engineering programme . 
  yeah my group tends to use passive insight , unless the character has a specific reason to suspect they 're lying , in which case it 's the larger of passive insight and rolling . 
  that makes ear for deceipt rather less useful . 
  how has this been downvoted ? 
  it 's pretty clearly correct . 
  all races with subraces can add this without needing anything . 
  races without it need to have specific rules applied , like humans only getting two ability score increases . 
  they 've given us a way for it to work with humans , dragonborn , and tieflings ( via the variant tiefling that * does * use subraces ) . 
  all that 's left now is the half-orc and half-elf , which would need a little tweaking along the same lines as the human and dragonborn received . 
  i believe their intention is to have it be like a religious inquisitor , rather than a noir-esque investigator . 
  in fact , i kinda wonder why they called it `` inquisitive '' rather than `` inquisitor '' . 
  / r/dndnext/wiki / resourcelist, 
   for being a character that ca n't heal from positive energy, 
  they never referred to the revenant as being `` undead '' or having the `` undead '' trait or type , so at the moment you * can * heal from all the normal healing spells . 
  maybe ( hopefully ? ), 
  they 'll add that in with a later draft/official release , but for now , they can continue healing as normal . 
  i believe schlessel 's point was that the first ua was eberron stuff , and yet it 's over a year later and still no proper eberron release . 
  so no use getting too excited for an eberron release * soon * . 
  however , given the recent survey perkins conducted , and i believe the result was that eberron and dark sun were the most popular , and i think he may have also made some mention around the same time that indicated they might be interested in expanding to new settings soon , * that * may be some better indication of near future official releases . 
  i do n't consider the downey jr. films to be very indicative of sherlock at all , in no small part * because * of those horrible fight scenes . 
  i know mercer got some input from some of the people from / r/unearthedarcana , which is a great subreddit for homebrew creation and feedback , but which is unaffiliated with wizards of the coast , on a few of his homebrew activities . 
  i dunno if he also got help from wotc . 
  the blood hunter is also [ due to be reviewed on / r/boh5e ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/boh5e/comments/4cs33n/blood_hunter_by_matthew_mercer/ ) , an elite subreddit for reviewing the best of homebrew material for 5e . 
  it should be interesting to see what kind of results it gets . 
  and sadly , we 're apparently going to get a joke `` unearthed arcana '' every other month from now on . 
  i really do wish/hope they 'd give the dm 's guild spotlights a different name , so as not to confuse people or make them think they 're the same ... 
  well not quite virtually always . 
  the swashbuckler loses sneak attack if it gets disadvantage for any reason , if there are two enemies within range , or if there 's another * ally * attacking the same enemy . 
  i am neither defending nor criticising their decision here , but i will try to point out what i think is mearls ' reasoning regarding the monster hunter . 
  it 's clear this ua is meant as something of a semi-official companion to the ravenloft adventure ; a less official equivalent to the elemental evil player 's companion , if you will . 
  the type of character that they were going for was something like van helsing , or the equivalent . 
  i do n't understand why they did n't include monstrosities on the list , but leaving off everything else seems to fit their vision for the class . 
  perhaps they should have also included lyconthropes as a specific creature ( on account of those being `` humanoid '' type ) , but for the most part their idea of what the option is designed to do seems consistent with the mechanics they 've given it . 
  no shit ... ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ my bad , completely forgot ... ~ ~, 
  edit : wait , that 's not * quite * true , because if a swashbuckler has an ally * behind * him , but not in range of the enemy , it still loses rakish audacity , but does n't gain standard sneak attack . 
  ` console.log ` is a javascript function . 
  i think it 's a great idea , but in practice it ends up being lame because they just use all these dumb languages with no use * except * for code golfing . 
  this thread , where we 're taking existing useful code and making it shorter , is way more interesting to me . 
  technically wrong because if the default case it should be `` tha value '', 
  i would second the other guy 's advice on looking into software engineering . 
  the difference between softeng and cs is basically nil ( in theory there 's a substantial difference , but in practice it varies wildly from uni to uni ) , but coming out with a `` software engineering '' degree sounds * much * more impressive than `` computer science '' does . 
  they have a chest mount too , i believe . 
  ah fair enough .
