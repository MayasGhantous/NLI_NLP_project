  i dunno seems pretty out there , but i 'm just spitballing here . 
  still ? 
  i mean , i had trouble trusting him until half way through season 3 of arrow , but to * still * not trust the guy ? 
  daymn dude , that 's some impressive level of mistrust :p, 
   with the other little nods they have ( kara 's mum and dad were both previously supergirl and superman respectively ), 
  and [ this whole entire scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erbpdrd9wxk ) from the flash . 
   it 's a good way to guarantee 3 out of every 4 students simply joins a good group and coasts, 
  i had this happen once . 
  it was a really dumb course anyway , intro to web design , with a heavy emphasis on the design aspect . 
  two assignments in two parts . 
  one was individual , the other team . 
  first part : design a website , second part : build it . 
  for my team one , we designed a thing , went through the required process of getting feedback from `` end users '' and tweaking the design . 
  then when it comes time to actually build it , one guy in my group just goes `` do n't worry , i 'll do the whole thing '' . 
  and he does . 
  it looks beautiful and everything , which is great , though it was really frustrating how he just took over and did the whole thing . 
  completely ignored the feedback stuff we did , too `` because i 've got experience in the industry '' or some bullshit . 
  i hate group assignments . 
  no , they did n't . 
  guy 's talking out of his arse . 
  closest thing is that if you 're wearing armour that you do n't have proficiency with , you straight up ca n't cast spells . 
  if you 're proficient , you can . 
  from memory , i think it was more to do with what we were designing than an actual boast of technical prowess ( though gods know , i 've seen a fair amount of that kind of person , too ) . 
  it was a website for a particular type of product , and he knew a guy who ran a website for that type of product , so he said `` oh , i know what these people want placed prominently on their sites '' , completely ignoring the fact that we had followed the procedures for user testing and found something different * which was part of the point of the assignment * . 
  i 'm just some random dude , not a mod on here . 
  ventress is probably the best example of how rule of 2 was n't followed , because dooku took her on with sidious 's full knowledge . 
  edit : typo, 
  is n't ventress a better example of an apprentice of dooku , on account of her being force sensitive and therefore a potential future sith lord ? 
  forgive me if i 'm doing this wrong , but i believe the intention when we started out was that links would be posted so that the public could take part in the same debates that were taking part in the hor . 
  i had a few things i wanted to say on this particular debate , but i did n't see a link , so i 've posted it here . 
  for ( 1 ) , i would propose not using the terms `` aedt '' or `` aest '' , but writing in terms of a clear and unambiguous utc offset . 
  if you say something happens at 1200 , utc +10 , it 's very clear what that means . 
  having the mover post threads seems pretty logical . 
  taking burden away from the speaker is a good thing . 
  the rest of it seems fairly routine iterations to make things work a little more smoothly . 
   or lucifer . 
  this one is cute . 
  hahahahahaha, 
  you jest , but honestly i rather like the sound of it as a name . 
  if it were n't for the connotations , it 'd be a cool name . 
  exactly . 
  having lived in korea , where they have those same toilets , urgh please no . 
  damn things * scare * me . 
  i just want my good reliable toilet with a seat , a bowl , and two buttons : half flush , and full flush . 
  none of this auto-flushing or spraying stuff at you business . 
  warmed seats are nice in winter , though . 
  i 'll give them that . 
  i feel like you missed the joke ... 
  as a successor to a game about a d&d setting ? 
  but they 're completely different game systems , and numenera does n't use the same cosmology as the d&d settings tend to . 
  how 's that going to work ? 
  is it actually going to be set in the same multiverse somehow , or is it more just a game in the same style that 's narratively unrelated ? 
  hahaha he did such a great job with that . 
  g gordon godfrey was so incredibly easy to hate !, 
  not appalling as a business model , but they should n't really be marketing it as unlimited . 
  unlimited means unlimited . 
  you market based on whatever the limit is , and then maybe also about what happens when someone goes over the limit . 
  some companies slow you down dramatically , some charge you exorbitant amounts per mb ( or even kb ) , and some cut you off entirely . 
  but whichever they do , you 've still reached a limit , and it is not unlimited . 
  i have no idea how any of the companies do things in practice , but the point is that it * can * be encrypted on your device , on the recipient 's device , in transport , and even on what 's app 's ( or whichever messaging service you 're talking about ) servers . 
  however , the encryption is n't `` end-to-end '' , because what 's app needs the capability to decrypt it in order to see what it says . 
  they can then immediately re-encrypt it , but because they have the keys , they are technically able to look at it at any time . 
  the message itself * can * be encrypted end-to-end , using a key that is * only * known to you and the recipient ( though the app does things for you -- you do n't actually need to know the key yourself as a person ) , because the content of the message has no bearing on the ability to deliver it . 
  it 's just a blob as far as they 're concerned . 
  the problem with that is people would still have to look it up , and there 's no clear indication within that of when things change . 
  utc offsets are clear , intuitive , and unambiguous . 
  poe 's law in action . 
  i do n't think that 's odd at all . 
  i would have loved to have seen his finalised version of the requiem , and the answer that really sparked my interest in this discussion was the idea of how a mozart symphony written * after * beethoven 's 3rd -- a mozart symphony from the romantic era -- might have affected music as a whole . 
  of course , he would have had to live nearly 15 more years to make that happen , but still , it 's not like he died an old man . 
  [ even the russians love cats ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/04/article-2551606-1b313f1a00000578-116_634x529.jpg ) . 
  [ and if you insist on something from when russia was actually communist , well they 've got you covered , too ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f3/18/bb/f318bbb5a52b0d58c255eee7517bd35d.jpg ) . 
  north korea is no longer officially communist as of 2013 ( not that it was particularly communist for a long time before then anyway ) . 
  laos it 's impossible to find anything on , because the damn country is so incredibly quiet that nothing ever gets heard from them . 
  it 's a little-known fact that [ communist china was actually * lead * by a cat ] ( http://www.northernsun.com/images/imagelarge/8271.jpg ) for most of its early history . 
  my guess is they 're overloaded at the moment from all the redditors . 
  i 'm planning on trying again in a few hours . 
  they officially changed their leadership structure . 
  personally i 'm interested in this just for the same reason i 'm interested in numberphile videos . 
  not out of any sense of practicality , but because the maths behind it is really intriguing . 
  [ here 's a good article about it . 
  ] ( http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1296394/democratic-peoples-monarchy-korea-north-korea-changes-ruling-principles ), 
  repeating jokes that are decades old and have been beaten to death by now does not count as having `` a sense of humour '' . 
  why does `` swim '' become `` swimming '' , and not `` swiming '' ? 
  the guy behind cave johnson and j. jonah jameson is playing commissioner gordon ? 
  an interesting choice , to be sure . 
  i can see it working . 
  bit odd that the article made no mention whatsoever of the latest incarnation of the character though , especially since he is , for the first time on screen , the * main * character in this version . 
  except that it 's so easy to accidentally hit the wrong button . 
  you 're not likely to get much of an answer on that front . 
  beta testers are nda 'd . 
  i 'm not sure why you 'd want to , really . 
  if you ca n't be a part of the beta review process , the app 's not currently in a state that 's particularly competitive -- too buggy ( as is to be expected of a beta ) . 
  i love that / r/panelshow and / r/britishproblems are trending on the same day . 
  the brits make the best panel shows . 
  qi , would i lie to you , 8 out of ten cats ( does countdown ) , etc. 
   now if they could stop riding 2 abreast when there is n't enough room that would be fantastic . 
  yeah . 
  they 've got the * right * to do it , and i think it 's a great right to have . 
  but a lot of times in life things we have the right to do are not polite .
