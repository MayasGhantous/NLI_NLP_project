  it uses some really nice ribbons to reinforce the flavour text in a mechanical sense , and i 'm definitely not getting the impression that the theme of the class is unclear . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 7/10, 
  the first thing that stands out is the crimson rite damage die from the table . 
  it 's quite clearly a similar concept to the monk 's martial arts damage , but it uses a different progression . 
  this does n't sit well with me . 
  it 's getting power increases at a far more rapid rate than the standard progression classes are expected to work at ( looking at cantrips and when they scale for the clearest indication of this , but the same progression is used in all classes ) . 
  of course , using exactly the same progression is n't always a * necessity * , but when it 's done without any obvious reason , i have to wonder if it would have been better using the same values . 
  pact magic has the same problem . 
  it * should * follow a progression similar to third-casters like the eldritch knight , gaining new spell slot levels at levels 1 , 7 , 13 , and 19 , just as the standard warlock follows the same progression as full casters , gaining new spell slot levels at every odd level ( when you take into account mystic arcanum as well ) . 
  but this does n't . 
  it also feels like it gains too many spells for a third-caster using pact magic . 
  it gets a third spell slot per short rest only three levels after a full warlock does . 
  strictly speaking , one third of a warlock would * never * gain a third spell slot , and would gain its second one at level 6 , though i can see making an allowance in this case to give it 3rd level slots really late in the game . 
  but certainly not as early as level 14 . 
  it has an especially big problem if multiclassing with warlock , since the profane soul will then become substantially weaker than it currently is . 
  a level 14 profane soul is adding 4 warlock levels , but on its own it has 3 spell slots . 
  if this class 's third spell slot came around level 18 , it would be better , though the multiclassing would still be wonky . 
  the revealed and unsealed arcana abilities feel like an appropriate way to give this a little bit of more powerful spellcasting . 
  the fact that , unlike mystic arcanum , they still use standard spell slots , is a good decision in terms of balance . 
  the other two orders seem to be a lot better built , in my opinion . 
  overall , i think the main features are pretty well balanced . 
  it has a reasonable amount of combat utility , but it tempers this by adding some flavourful exploration and social abilities as well . 
  its capstone ability is a particularly powerful one , but it 's one that feels like it makes sense . 
  the biggest problem it has is with when different abilities scale and by how much . 
  ### overall thoughts, 
  i like it . 
  it 's a little wonky here and there in terms of its balance , but it has a strong theme , it 's very well written , and most of it does feel well balanced . 
  that is definitely how i envisaged it at first , but reading the actual wording in terms of mechanics , that does n't seem to be what 's going on . 
  how it actually happens is up to the user . 
  perhaps it 's more abstract , and it 's a simple matter of an empowered crossbow causing magical effects . 
  maybe it 's a little more concrete and the crossbow has been imbued with the effect and thus it passes on the imbuement ( if that 's a word ) to each bolt fired . 
  main point is that how one chooses to flavour it does n't really matter all that much . 
  what matters is that mechanically , the way that it 's written , there 's no difference between how it works for melee users to how it works for those that use ranged weapons . 
  ## overall score : 8.83 / 10, 
  ### wording/formatting : 8/10, 
  the first thing that stands out when one looks at this is the giant picture at the bottom , and the awful wrapping that accompanies it . 
  the picture itself is great , but the wrapping feels bad , especially since all it 's wrapping around is the darker yellow-ish colour . 
  it could have gone straight done the column and would have looked fine . 
  other than that , i felt a little awkward while reading the intro . 
  i do n't know exactly what it was , but there were just parts of it that felt oddly worded . 
  ### theme/creativity : 9/10, 
  it 's good . 
  the spell list is a very appropriate one . 
  in fact , i might go so far as to say it is the * best * spell list in terms of fitting the theme for * any * warlock patron i 've seen outside of the player 's handbook . 
  the biggest problem is conjure elemental , which aside from being able to be used to conjure fire , earth , and air elementals , which are far too different from the theme to be worth considering , even the water elementals are n't a great fit . 
  there are n't any ice elementals currently in the game . 
  frozen shield deserves a special amount of praise , for the way it acts like the warlock using the ice of an attack against them to reinforce their own defences . 
  it could be flavoured in a large number of ways , but all of them feel brilliant and appropriate . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 9.5 / 10, 
  the dungeon master 's guide says , under `` modifying a class -  changing spell lists '', 
   be cautious when changing the warlock spell list . 
  since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest ,, 
  they have the potential to use certain spells more times, 
  in a day than other classes do . 
  this has often been taken to imply that certain types of spells , especially conjuration ones , should not be given to warlocks except as part of once-per-long-rest invocations . 
  so it feels to me that giving warlocks with an ice queen patron access to * conjure elemental * is not a great idea . 
  the rest of the spells are perfectly fine . 
  ice queen 's blessing feels a lot weaker than the other warlock features . 
  most of the warlock level 1 patron features are quite substantial , but this one feels like a ribbon . 
  compare the ability to charm/frighten enemies or gain temporary hp for every kill with access to a rather underpowered cantrip with very limited use . 
  glacial prison lacks a dc for the saving throw . 
  it should either say some static dc ( 10 or 15 would probably not be unreasonable ) , or say it is against `` your warlock save dc '' ( making sure to use the * exact * wording from similar features in the phb , rather than my paraphrasing ) . 
  icy tomb needs an answer to the same question . 
  frozen shield is a great ability . 
  it takes the basic notion of all warlocks getting a defensive buff at level 10 , and works very nicely with that . 
  cold damage is a rather weak type ( compared to ones like fire or the melee types ) , and giving this a buff in the form of temporary hit points works really nicely . 
  icy tomb is a nice feature . 
  probably roughly on par with dark delirium . 
  stronger in the sense that they get a saving throw if they take damage , rather than the feature automatically ending , but weaker in the sense that it 's petrifying them , rather than charming or frightening them . 
  definitely an appropriate power level in comparison . 
  ### overall thoughts, 
  my biggest negative is conjure elemental . 
  both thematic and mechanical reasons that this probably is n't a great idea . 
  aside from that , this is an overall great option that has been very well created . 
  the members of parliament should be * ashamed * of themselves . 
  they have just passed an amendment to the standing orders that * codifies * a number of * conventions * ( a practice that is generally avoided in the westminster system , as convention is highly respected ) that already were strongly in place to some extent . 
  one part of the amendment in particular seems as though it has been * designed * to decrease accessibility versus the old convention . 
  and yet in response to criticism raised in this thread , there was only silence , and a passing of this amendment without question . 
  members on * both * sides of the house should be ashamed .

  turn the nob/dial for `` pan '' to the centre . 
   considering that there was barely any murmur whatsoever from the house it is of relative inconsequence, 
  you 're kidding , right ? 
  the lack of murmur around it is * exactly * what 's the problem . 
  one particular variation of a convention was codified . 
  the problem is the specific variation that got codified is a terrible one , and not the one that was successfully implemented for many months . 
  instead , it 's a confusing and ambiguous one that forces people to look up what time it is rather than just performing a really simple calculation in their head : a practice clearly designed to make it more difficult for people outside of new south wales , victoria , and the act to participate . 
  and all of this * was * done without so much as a murmur inside the house , and when the issue was raised by members of the public , it was entirely * ignored * . 
  i 'm being facetious here , of course . 
  i do n't think it was * actually * designed to do that .
