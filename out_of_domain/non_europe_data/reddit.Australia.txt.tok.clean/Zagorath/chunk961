  but that * is * the effect it will have , and my point is to raise the issue that it was done without thought as to the consequences and just passed willy nilly . 
  as for the bot , it is working as intended . 
  the ability to page relevant users from anywhere was one of the core design considerations in the 2.0 release . 
  lol you were around then , were n't you ? 
  could we please get a little explanation as to what this is , for those unfamiliar ? 
   `` booleanizing '' a non-bool ( imo ) should n't be a result of syntactic sugar , it should be explicit , since the conversion may have not been intended . 
  i agree completely . 
  this wo n't actually work in java , but the way this * should * be done is something along the lines of, 
  object somevar = null ;, 
  an * explicit * conversion into a boolean . 
  either that , or just use c-like `` truthy '' values . 
  any integer other than 0 is true , any object that 's not null is true , etc. 
   in java , you ca n't just cast an object ( class ) to a primitive, 
  yes i 'm aware ( as i said , what i was doing is n't actually possible in java ) . 
  i was just referring to the * type * of explicit conversion that would be necessary . 
   someobject.gettrueobjectcase ( ) . equals ( somevar ) ;, 
  that seems awfully complicated . 
  if you 're going to create an extra method anyway , why not make it a non-static one ` istrue ( ) ` ? 
  yes , i * know this * . 
  read what i actually said rather than inferring something else . 
  if you 've already been taking maths hl for nearly a year , i might suggest dropping to sl and * not * studies . 
  studies is a very different type of course , whereas sl is basically hl but easier . 
  if you were to be deciding your subjects from the very beginning , it might have been worth doing studies , but so late into the process it 's probably not a great idea . 
   as ribbon feature , which force player to be creative is lot better , not everything should be directly usefull in combat . 
  first level warlock abilities * are * ones that are more than a ribbon . 
  fiendlocks gain temp hp every time they kill , feylocks charm or frighten enemies nearby , and undying gain a cantrip , advantage on saving throws against disease , and undead have to make a saving throw in order to attack them . 
  the new ice queen 's blessing fits perfectly with this style of ability . 
  strongly flavourful with a minor but noticeable mechanical benefit . 
  ## updated score : 9.67 / 10, 
  ### layout/formatting : 10/10, 
  the introductory paragraph reads much nicer now . 
  the full height image looks great , and the way it 's blended into the page is superb . 
  ### balance/mechanics : 10/10, 
  a much better choice of spell selection , and a first level feature that seems in keeping with the general warlock first level feature design paradigm . 
  the image seems to have been taken down . 
  anyone got a mirror ? 
  han * is * force sensitive . 
  it was canon in the eu , and the latest movie made an obvious nod to it in the form of him shooting a dude behind him that he had no reason to know was there otherwise . 
  i dunno , sure , dlc * can * be used in that way , but when i hear dlc i usually think of things like skyrim 's dawnguard , civ v 's gods & kings , and old school `` expansion packs '' like age of mythology 's the titans . 
  that , or aesthetic things like different skins etc. 
  if you 're worried about the unfreezing part ( as / u/kilhart says ) , then perhaps you might consider time travel instead . 
  all you need to do is get a rocket that can go at like 90 % of the speed of light really close to a very massive object . 
  kelvin does n't use degrees , it 's an absolute scale . 
  for example , water does not melt at 273.15 \u00b0 k , it melts at 273.15 k. 
  degrees is an indication that it 's a * relative * scale . 
  that there 's no objectively correct starting point . 
  both \u00b0 c and \u00b0 f have rather arbitrary `` zeros '' . 
  \u00b0 c is a vastly better and more useful 0 than \u00b0 f , but it 's still not an objectively * correct * point . 
  0 m is exactly no distance . 
  0 kg is an object with no mass . 
  similarly , 0 k has absolutely no enthalpy or entropy ( which is a fancy way of saying it has absolutely no temperature ) . 
  edit : as for `` what 's the difference between \u00b0 c and c ? 
  '' , well , one is a measurement of temperature , and the other is a measure of electrical charge ( coulombs -- equivalent to one amp second , that 2900 mah battery your phone has is 10.44 kc ) . 
  just a tip , / r/habitrpg is the active sub . 
  you 'll generally get more/better responses from there . 
  personally , i find it more useful to set the day start to like 7:00 am , so that no matter how late i am going to bed , it 'll always still be the same day as far as habitica/habitrpg is concerned , with the new `` day '' starting just a bit before i wake up , rather than just after going to bed . 
  an * oath * of madness ? 
  i 'll be honest , my initial reaction to that is `` contradiction '' . 
  but i suppose it could work . 
  a character * motivated * by the idea of spreading chaos . 
  someone like the joker could very easily be thought of as having taken an oath of madness . 
  what would their tenets be ? 
  `` unpredictability '' is the first that springs to mind . 
  perhaps something to do with the idea that a character focussed on madness may frequently do something that directly leads themselves to harm ( while also , presumably , furthering other goals ) . 
  something involving the word `` suffering '' in its name is probably appropriate , whether it 's targeted at the player character or others around them . 
  i think one of the most important things to focus on would probably be the idea that the character * being * insane is n't the focus so much as their desire to * impart * madness upon the world . 
  whether or not they themselves are mad does n't matter so much . 
  but even so , i think that as a fundamental idea , it 's a character that would be * exceedingly * difficult to play well . 
  it would , by necessity , skirt the line between chaotic stupid and awesome like a knife edge . 
  not impossible , to be sure , just challenging . 
  the gap is a fairly large one , i believe . 
  one of the largest in the ib . 
  if you did igcse additional maths ( which , at my school , was * highly * recommended in order to do hl maths anyway ) , you 'll probably find sl maths is mostly just revision . 
  if you only did extended maths at igcse , the jump is a more natural one , rather than the huge leap from extended to hl . 
   good dlc is good dlc . 
  bad dlc is bad dlc . 
  this is the crux of it . 
  i think the issue is that you seemed to be saying `` all dlc is bad by default , unless it shows itself to be good . '', 
  but my default assumption is of the good kind , especially from a developer like taleworlds . 
  the transparent but is my problem with it . 
  i do n't like the look of a giant transparent bar running all the way down the note . 
  what 's gyazo ? 
   i would change italics to ` / italicized / ` and bold to ` * bolded * ` and ` - strikethrough - `, 
  whatever markup skype and youtube use use asterisks for bold and it 's a pain . 
  the current way markdown functions is just fine . 
  github should not unilaterally change from the standard that is used across the web in markdown supported sites . 
  underlined though , i can kinda get on board with . 
  currently , underscores are an alternative way of doing italic , so that may cause some confusion , not to mention underlining is bad design on websites , since users associate it with hyperlinks . 
  but if underline really needed to be an option , using underscores to do it makes sense . 
  wait , paki is an acronym ? 
  what does it stand for ? 
  but yeah , - stan means `` place of '' . 
  afghanistan is the place of the afghans , etc. 
  it stands to reason that pakistan would be the place of pakis . 
  up to you how you deal with this in terms of timing . 
  looks like enough people will see it and vote in time for the original deadline to have a majority anyway . 
  i would think it 's at the discretion of the speaker and/or mods and/or members of parliament , if it 's not specified in the standing orders . 
  agreed !, 
  he and kevin spacey were both fantastic in their parts in that movie . 
  it was just a mediocre , bland story .
