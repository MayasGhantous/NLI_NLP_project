  ^ ( ( still better than man of steel , though . 
  at least it did n't shit all over what superman * is * . 
  how does that go down ? 
  do they host images themselves , rather than uploading to imgur or some other dedicated image host ? 
  i thought today 's episode was a little bit of a disappointment , but that 's only compared to how fantastic it 's been the last few episodes , and compared to today 's gotham , which was pretty damn incredible . 
  they 're called tildes . 
  do n't ask me why or what that means . 
  dude , no need to be a dick to someone just because they do n't like what you like . 
  i happen to like daredevil , though in my opinion it 's nowhere near as good as gotham or jessica jones , and it 's probably only a touch ahead of supergirl and the flash lately ( with supergirl improving significantly , and the flash getting worse , imo ) . 
  you ca n't tell me i 'm wrong about that , and you ca n't tell him he 's wrong about his opinion . 
  because enjoying media is a deeply personal thing and it 's entirely subjective . 
  the only thing here that 's bullshit is your comment . 
  i would tend to agree . 
  i thought season two was substantially weaker than season 1 of daredevil . 
  it was * okay * , but it failed to grab me in the way season 1 did , whereas i feel like gotham is continuously getting more and more exciting . 
   might end up dropping legends of tomorrow, 
  i find that really interesting , because if there was one show i would drop , it 's legends . 
  it 's just so hilariously terrible that laughing at it is the only reason i * do * watch it . 
  honestly i think the flash is just a pretty weak show overall lately . 
  barry 's actions in the last episode were just so stupid it was hard to get on board with it . 
  though i must admit , i 'm not a fan of time travel in general precisely because of how easy it is to fuck up plots with it . 
   when the show was pitched originally i rolled my eyes, 
  you and nearly everyone else who 's heard of the show . 
  i did n't watch it until this latest christmas holiday because i just could n't believe that a show where batman villains are appearing prior to batman himself could possibly feel in keeping with the spirit of batman . 
  i am * so * glad that i managed to be convinced into watching it , because it is by far the most enjoyable of the comic book shows out there at the moment , in my opinion . 
  i 'm not sure `` noir '' is really the right word for it . 
  our hero is n't really self-loathing , more just driven . 
  and the show is lacking in things like muted trumpet music and voice overs that mark a typical noir show . 
  i 'm not sure how one * would * categorise the style of gotham in this show . 
  probably some combination of gothic and art deco ? 
  those have certainly been the most popular sources of inspiration for other incarnations of gotham in film and television over the past few decades . 
   read : h ` orderve, 
  lol , that 's an amusing way of spelling `` hors d'oeuvre '' , unless that 's some reference i 'm missing . 
  french . 
  not even once . 
  umm , just so you 're aware , that ip address down the bottom there is * yours * . 
  it is n't an enormous problem in terms of network security , but it could be information that someone could use to identify you . 
   and that she has travelled vietnam so she believes it 's fine, 
  this could have been part of the problem . 
  i do n't actually know any vietnamese-australians ( okay , that 's not quite true , but those that i do know are so ignorant of politics of all sorts that this sort of thing would n't even register as a blip on their radar ) , but i lived in vietnam for a time and so know many of them . 
  ho chi minh is held in rather high regard by vietnamese people in vietnam . 
  i do n't * know * , but i certainly would not be surprised to hear that vietnamese-australians hold a very different view . 
  and that makes total sense , since these are largely the people ( and the descendants of people ) who fled the country because of the man , and have very good reason to not have good opinions of him . 
  his main enemies have so far been other speedsters , but in all honesty when he goes up against other bad guys , a lot of the time it 's just him being stupid . 
  some of said stupidity is justified by his inexperience and overconfidence , but to be honest sometimes it comes across as contrived for narrative purposes . 
  well then what 's she doin ' at gordon 's place ? 
  he does n't even know who dick is yet . 
  well , you also made a far more blanket statement :, 
   i literally will not buy the game if dlc is even mentioned . 
  the comment that started this discussion said :, 
   if this was n't an isolated incident please explain uber has done so well in australia, 
  dannyr provided an explanation for that . 
  you 're inferring something that he did n't actually say . 
  the top comment 's the most useful bit . 
  this thing happens from time to time . 
  there 's no reason to get all worked up over it . 
  just take your torrenting business elsewhere for a few days . 
  there 're plenty of good sites out there . 
  all dannyr was saying is that you ca n't * compare * taxis and uber on equal ground unless they are * operating * on equal ground . 
  but they are n't , because uber does n't have to pay the stupid license fees . 
  dannyr made no claim that the license fees are fair . 
  in fact , he said `` i think we all agree the fees are absurd '' . 
  does n't get much clearer than that . 
  their acceptable ads programme has been used as the subject of some pretty extreme negative press , none of it deserved at all . 
  in order to be a good citizen of the internet , they decided to , by default , let through certain ads that meet some reasonable restrictions , like not being animated , clearly being an ad , and not interrupting the user 's reading experience ( for example , by being in between paragraphs of text ) . 
  they also charge * large * ad providers a fee in order to be approved . 
  nobody can show ads without meeting their acceptability policies , and the fee is not charged to smaller entities , so it does n't act as a mechanism that encourages the use of google ads , for example . 
  it allows websites that use good policies to get some revenue from conscionable users who want to support the sites that they visit . 
  but if you do n't like that , you can always turn it off , because it 's an option . 
  how so ? 
  to me , it 's a strong reason to use them * over * anyone else . 
  they actually want to support sites , rather than just blankly deciding that it 's `` best '' for users if they refuse to allow the sites they visit any chance at making money . 
  to me , the developer of ublock ( or origins , ca n't remember which i saw say this ) is the one that should be avoided , with his statement that he will never make using a blacklist easy because he believes that ads must be blocked by default and websites should not have a chance to make money . 
  i 'm surprised that this is possible in the us . 
  do they not have eminent domain ? 
  you should probably be aware that you seem to have been shadowbanned . 
  you will need to contact the reddit admins in order to get this fixed . 
  hey , sorry , but submissions need, 
   to be complete in terms of material presented . 
  it does n't have to be perfect or balanced but it does have to be fleshed out, 
  if you want to ask around for things , try leaving a comment in [ the latest arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4eam1j/the _ arcana_forge / ) . 
  you should probably be aware that there are canonical reasons that tieflings are different in more recent editions . 
  as a result of the toril 13 aiding asmodeus 's ascension to godhood , all tieflings were changed into the form we see in the 4e and 5e player 's handbooks . 
  that said , i do really like the idea of a sorcerous bloodline for tieflings . 
  you should really consider writing this up on its own and submitting it to / r/unearthedarcana as a separate submission , where it can get the individual attention it deserves . 
  just a tip , prefix lines with ''  '' in order to have them appear as actual greentext .

  how does a guy who died in the 7th century end up patron saint of the internet ? 
  give the guy a break !, 
  he died over 1300 years before the internet was even invented !, 
  i agree . 
  the giant transparent strip down the middle still looks stupid and out of place , and those bacteria things are even worse . 
  assuming that 's unix time , have you made sure to adjust for all the times calendars were changed , dates skipped , etc. 
  between then and 1970 ? 
  the first big thing i 've noticed is in ** account creation : it requires alphanumeric passwords ** . 
  it 's a relief to see that you at least do n't have maximum password lengths ( or if you do , that it 's a comfortably large one ) , but not allowing special characters is just bad design . 
  i 'll probably update this with my other thoughts as i try this out . 
  currently waiting on an image to upload , and the site ** wo n't let me do anything else at the same time ** . 
  the fact that there 's ** no upload progress bar ** compounds this issue , and the fact that i ** ca n't point it at a web url ** is an additional pain . 
  ~ ~ ** generating a pdf preview currently takes way too long ** .
