  no , it could trigger up to 3 opportunity attacks . 
  they could move out of range of 3 enemies simultaneously , all of which get their attacks at the same time . 
  you could actually move out of range of up to 5 enemies at once without reach , as shown in [ this horrendous and hastily sketched diagram ] ( http://i.imgur.com/k7yoygd.png ) . 
  probably not * likely * , but if you 've got a party of 4 or 5 with 3 melee users , especially if one or two of those are rogues or paladins , it would be easy to get up some * serious * damage . 
  honestly i feel like this xkcd , as well-intentioned as it may be , is far less beneficial than it seems . 
  it does n't solve the biggest problem people have with security : the need to have * dozens * of strong passwords for * dozens * of separate accounts . 
  most people have multiple email addresses , bank accounts , a work/school/uni account , various social media accounts , accounts for various websites/stores , and the list goes on and on and on . 
  randall gave us a great way to make pretty good passwords , but not a great way to remember unique equally strong passwords ( and the relative strength of a password is far less if you use it on a lot of sites -- if * one * is doing security badly on its end , you 've just become vulnerable on ** every ** site where you use that password ) for each and every site . 
  it also places a comparatively high burden on you when it comes to creating a new password . 
  the * best * solution is a password manager . 
  it can generate long , pseudorandom passwords for every site you make an account on , and easily remember them and make it easy to sign in on multiple devices . 
  for instance , here 's one that i 've just generated now : ` 0 { 8 ( rm71ph ~ jaqobf $ hf < ; cy0 -- ' & wcpwq ) ( ( & ` . 
  if i used that to create a new reddit account , i would never have to remember that myself , i 'd just press a button in chrome whenever i want to sign in . 
  you get passwords that are actually * better * than randall 's method , since they 're far higher entropy ( using numbers , letters , symbols , and case , as well as not being vulnerable to a dictionary or dictionary-concatenation attack ) , and it 's * less * work for you both at the password generation stage and in terms of remembering things . 
  personally , i use and recommend [ lastpass ] ( http://lastpass.com/ ) because i 've seen [ its security vetted by someone i know to be highly reliable ] ( https://youtu.be/r9q_anb7pwg?t=53m48s ) . 
  however , there are a number of other good options out there , most notably [ 1 password ] ( https://1password.com/ ) and [ keepass ] ( http://keepass.info/ ) . 
  anyone who * is n't * using one of these is , in my opinion , doing it wrong . 
  the accepted term \\* is `` lagniappe '' video . 
  oh , and the term here is `` canon '' , not `` cannon '' . 
  canon with one n in the middle refers to what is true , the electronics manufacturer , and the musical genre . 
  the double-ned version is * only * for weapons . 
  \\* for some definition of `` accepted '' . 
  as grey tried to get across in this video , cryptography is a * solved problem * . 
  we can * perfectly * encrypt things so that it is computationally infeasible to decrypt them without the key . 
  if you watch the linked video , you 'll see a pretty detailed explanation of exactly why lastpass ( and , by extension , other well-made password managers ) is mathematically secure . 
  a couple of years ago there was a big scare about a breach in lastpass 's security and they made everyone update their master passwords and stuff . 
  but the thing is , the way their crypto was done , all that uproar was essentially just as a sort of `` just in case '' . 
  in fact , they would probably have been close enough to safe having done nothing at all . 
  that 's how secure these systems are . 
  just so you know , this comment was caught by reddit 's spam filter . 
  probably because of the bit.ly link . 
  i 've manually approved it for now , but in the future , avoid link shorteners . 
  here is a direct link to where that points , by the way , if anyone would like something a bit more trustworthy than a shortened link :, 
  [ go here to learn more ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shadowbanned ) . 
  \u2122 is probably the character you were looking for . 
  if the client is compromised , using a password manager is n't going to be a problem , because attackers have other ways of getting what they want . 
  i do n't know one off by heart , no , but i 'm fairly sure i have heard of a way to do it before . 
  just spitballing here , but could one not encrypt the key using another key k2 , but make k2 a product of information held by each party ? 
  for what it 's worth , when i said `` this is my area of expertise '' , that was only a relative term . 
  i am * far * from a security expert . 
  i 'm just a student of software engineering with a keen interest in security . 
   obviously no one cares about the others lol, 
  the last night of the proms would be at the * bottom * of my list of proms to go see , or near enough to it . 
  the proms put on a heap of excellent concerts with a variety of old favourites and exciting new works , why would i want to go and see the biggest one where they do the same tired pieces every year ? 
  biggest obvious thing that 's missing is prestige classes . 
  there 's [ one released in a ua ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/ua_rune_magic_prestige_class.pdf ) and many good homebrews . 
  it would be nice if there was a colour distinction between unearthed arcana and officially released material . 
  for homebrew stuff , you should probably aim to have everything from / r/boh5e in this list , currently there are a heap of great things that are n't being included . 
  it would be good if they had sources on them . 
  so many of these things i have never heard of before , and there 's no way for me to find where they 've been submitted to others to review before , if they ever have . 
  a link to the / r/unearthedarcana or / r/boh5e thread ( s ) that they had been submitted in would be * extremely * useful . 
  a couple i would particularly like to see added are [ this vampire prestige class ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0bwf09f1afxwlcvnhtk1wu1u1ztq/view ) ( [ reviewed here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/3qnv6q/vampire_prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big/ ) and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/boh5e/comments/49mnbi/vampire_prestige_class_by_uthe_singular_anyone/ ) ) , and [ this vryloka race ] ( http://www.naturalcrit.com/homebrew/share/vydfopkag ) ( a past version of which is [ reviewed here ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 3tp1bm/vryloka _ race_v5_final / ) ) . 
  i did econ sl with no prior experience in economics and only a passing interest in the subject . 
  i absolutely loved it . 
  it 's something that i 'm * extremely * glad to have studied in the amount of depth that i have . 
  history is great , but personally i find i get enough exposure to that through things like crash course and extra history . 
  economics , in my opinion , benefits far more from the formal education . 
  physics vs. chemistry is a tough one . 
  you do n't seem to have a clear idea of what you want to do at university , so my suggestion would simply be to go with whichever of the two * sciences * you enjoy more * for its own sake * , unless you decide it seems more likely that one * would * be more useful to you . 
  seriously , he did n't say something * slightly * offensive . 
  ** it was n't even directed at the bitch . 
  boh5e is ua 's sister subreddit specifically for high quality content with in-depth reviews . 
  well , according to this article , over 50 % would make it * three * months \\* . 
  \\* the article does n't say if they 're talking mean or median . 
  if it 's median , then the above is trivially true . 
  if it 's mean , then the above is true assuming incomes are roughly normal ( which , let 's be honest , they are n't , they 're probably * heavily * positiviely skewed ) , but even if it is n't , it 's probably a safe bet to say that at least 50 % can make one month . 
   the survey found , perhaps surprisingly , that gen y are actually the most financially literate . 
  \\* sigh \\* there we are again , unfounded pessimistic assumptions being made against `` young people these days '' , even in the face of data to the contrary . 
   where did you get the idea that anyone is trying to make it illegal to offend or insult someone ? 
   behaviour ... reasonably likely to offend , insult, 
  that 's probably where ... 
  i ca n't get cortana to work at all . 
  she thinks i 'm not connected to the internet :(, 
  but that 's not chrome 's fault . 
  it was happening before this update , too . 
  i knew it had to have a name !, 
  although i must admit , i was expecting it to be a sort of `` oh yeah !, 
  how did i forget '' moment when someone pointed it out . 
  instead , i think this is actually the first time i 've come across the name for it . 
  thanks a heap !, 
   and you 're sure these `` angel keys '' could never leak in any way , or used without oversight, 
  no , we 're definitely ** not ** sure of that !, 
  but that was exactly my point in the original comment . 
  the * mathematics * of the issue * can * be done perfectly , it 's just that it opens up enormous room for side-channel attacks ( a term i 'm using here in a far broader sense than it is traditionally used , to include social engineering and similar tactics ) . 
  in my opinion , these are a big enough issue that it is n't a good idea to put in such a provision . 
  i just have noticed a lot of misinformation spread around the maths of it , and i wanted to clear that up . 
  human driven evolution can happen at rates * much * faster than in the wild , and is much less susceptible to constraints of practicality and inclination . 
  that said , i 'm not really sure if this particular example would be possible or practical , but if it were practical , i would n't be surprised to see it doable in under 1,000 years . 
  oh gods this is so frustrating . 
  especially when it lets through a pop-up that the site created , but blocks the legitimate link . 
  1 ) yes , it 's an official rule in both 3.5 and 4e . 
  no direct equivalent exists in 5e . 
  there is an option to take an * action * called `` disengage '' , where you get your full movement , but it does n't provoke any opportunity attacks . 
  rogues can do this as a bonus action . 
  personally , my group homerules in an equivalent to the 3.5 and 4e option , because it does n't make sense to us that you could run circles around an enemy ( literally ** 70 feet ** around and around an enemy if you have a speed of 35 ft. and take the dash action ) and not provoke opportunity , but taking * one step * backwards * does * . 
  edit : it 's a particularly unpopular house rule for some reason , but nobody has yet been able to give me a cogent reason as to why . 
  the * best * case scenario for this guy was he thought he was neutral and was trying to rev the engines to scare the motorcyclist . 
  that would be better than what he * actually * did . 
  even that is still a massive dick move , but it 's slightly less so . 
  taking the * dash * action is certainly * not * a representation of two fighters circling each other .
