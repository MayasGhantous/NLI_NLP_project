  in particular , the raven seems to go about as far north as townsville . 
  if i 'm located in brisbane , roughly what percentage of large black birds are going to be crows versus ravens ? 
  and how would one distinguish between them ? 
  \\* oh my gods i only * just * got your username . 
  fwiw , fcpx and after effects are not direct substitutes . 
  after effects is a visual effects programme , whereas fcpx is an nle . 
  the adobe equivalent of fcpx is premiere pro , and the apple equivalent of ae is motion . 
  wait , you can do __ bold __ with double italics ? 
  now * that * i had no idea about . 
  ah cool , thanks for the thorough explanation !, 
  sorry , but what 's h3 ? 
  my googling is turning up stuff related to singapore 's high school curriculum , and i do n't * think * that 's what you were going for . 
   no playback speed option, 
  lol what the fuck ? 
  that 's like , the ** single most important part of a podcatcher ** outside of actually downloading podcasts ... why would anyone ever use this ? 
  perhaps if youtube subscriptions worked properly and were more easily accessed it would be . 
  every podcatcher ever , except apparently this one , has this as a standard feature . 
  i would second caboose127 's recommendation of pocket casts . 
  start with just slightly above 1.0 x , and you can gradually increase the speed at which you listen to podcasts . 
  by the end of the year , you can be listening at 2.0 x or more without sacrificing understanding . 
  my default these days is about 2.4 x. 
  i 'll turn it up to 2.6 x for information light episodes , or down to 2.0 x for really densely packed technical episodes . 
  yeah , the blue-ringed octopus is the one that i was thinking of . 
  they 're relatively common around where i live , so we grew up hearing about them and being told to be careful of them in tidal pools at beaches etc. 
  because there 's no reason to worry about other types of octopodes , i never really heard that much about them , so my natural association is octopus -  dangerous . 
   the movie cut out nearly everything good about h2g2, 
  true , though the song at the beginning was pretty great . 
  yeah i 'm the same . 
  normally i notice the music in shows and films a heap , but in this one i do n't think i 've noticed any themes aside from what i * would * have previously called the `` gordon '' theme , but noticed it being used with bruce this episode , so i guess i 'm back to square one ... 
  try star trek : the next generation . 
  it 's [ the trope namer ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/growingthebeard ) . 
  is that the '60s show ? 
  was that freeze 's first appearance ? 
  umm , no ? 
  being a staunch republican is one of the ( if not the * only * ) legitimate things that we can quite definitively say he * does * believe in . 
  he 's been a very public and vocal supporter of it for over a * decade * and lead the referendum in ' 99 . 
  i see what you 're getting at , but i do n't entirely agree . 
  the best republican system we could come up with ( imo , anyway ) would be one that functions exactly as it does today , just with power not officially residing in the crown . 
  using the features built into it for his own self interest might be scummy , but i do n't think it 's particularly ironic . 
  it * would * be ironic if he had been vocally in favour of a republican system wherein a directly elected president has actual political powers and by convention had discretion in their use , but i do n't think that 's been his stance . 
  [ yes , two party system ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/03%20senators%20and%20members/31%20senators/senate-numbers_2015.jpg?la=en ) . 
  honestly i just want them in for to get better ip laws . 
  their proposal for a [ bill of rights ] ( https://pirateparty.org.au/wiki/policies/bill_of_rights ) is also fantastic . 
  yes , i know the reference ( and even if i did n't , it 's linked further up the thread ) . 
  does n't change the fact that it 's inaccurate in australia . 
  let me guess , you wrote `` 4 . '' ? 
  the problem , if so , is with the way markdown parses ordered lists . 
  basically , if it sees '' { { number } } . '', 
  at the start of a line , it assumes that you must want to make an ordered list , and it starts numbering from one . 
  4 . this line begins with 4 , but you 'll see 1 . 
  10 . this line begins with 10 . 
  you 'll see 2 . 
  123456789 . this begins with 123456789 . 
  you 'll see 3 . 
  it 's kinda dumb , and it causes mistakes like yours * way * more often than it comes in useful , but it 's something to be aware of . 
  you can tell it you do n't want that by putting a backslash ( \\ \\ ) before the full stop . 
  text ` will display as :, 
  text, 
  basically , both apple and adobe have two main programmes for `` editing '' video . 
  there are the `` non-linear editors '' , that 's what you 're used to . 
  they take a bunch of video and audio clips and splice it together , as well as a few other basic keyframing tasks . 
  apple has final cut pro , adobe has premiere pro . 
  then there 's the special effects editors , motion and after effects . 
  they 're mainly for creating video effects like compositing , graphics , and animation . 
  the normal workflow is to create individual bits of animation/graphics/whatever * in * one of these , and then import them back into the nle to create the actual result . 
  it * is * possible to use the video effects programmes to make the whole project , but it 's not ideal . 
  it would be like trying to do word processing in microsoft publisher . 
  it 's doable , just not ideal . 
  no , it 's not . 
  there are currently two independents out of the 535 members of congress ( both houses ) , and zero third-parties . 
  the last time there were more than two non -- major party members was in 1943 -- ' 45 . 
  to get the same figure in the senate , it 's 1939 -- ' 41 . 
  they * very much * have a two party system entrenched by both culture and the vote system . 
  the smile afterwards is almost creepier . 
  what 's the sport ? 
   added skip back to now playing notification, 
  [ but , they already had that ? 
   it 's not all that fun, 
  you take that back , heathen !, 
  are you thinking what i 'm thinking ? 
  ah right , i see . 
  i do n't use a lock screen , so i 've never noticed . 
  i 'm guessing this is because the lockscreen can only display the `` single-line '' ( for lack of a better term ) version of the notification ? 
  and the new update will therefore probably allow both the single-line and two-line versions of the notification in the notification pane to appear with a skip back button ? 
  how did this come about ? 
  did you dress up specifically for it , or were you coming back from some sort of event , like a fancy dress party , hallowe'en , or similar ? 
  personally i 've never had any problems with them working for me , but they 're quite infamously broken , with videos from channels people subscribe to not always showing up to their subscribers . 
  the only problem i 've personally experienced is that they 've moved subscriptions from pride of place on the home page to being buried a few clicks deep . 
  pick up an interest in british television . 
  say you 're using a vpn to overcome georestrictions on british television content . 
  that 's what i was referring to . 
  personally , my suggestion would be to add the spell to the tempest cleric 's spell list . 
  not give it for free , but let you pick it as one of your normal cantrips . 
  and i 'd never fiddle with someone 's network traffic . 
  oh no , i was referring to the hotel . 
  they should n't be fiddling with their customers ' traffic . 
  / r/circlejerk is that-a-way . 
  the oathbreaker has two necromancy options . 
  at level 3 , it has control undead channel divinity . 
  this lets you control one undead creature as long as its cr is lower than your level .
