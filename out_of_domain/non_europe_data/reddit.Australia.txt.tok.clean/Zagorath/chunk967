  they also get a saving throw , so the higher you can get your charisma the better your chances of succeeding . 
  your other option is once you 're level 9 , you can cast the spell * animate dead * . 
  it works exactly as described in its entry in the phb . 
  this option does n't rely on your charisma at all . 
  wow i had no idea the lemony snicket books were written so recently !, 
  if you 'd asked me half an hour ago when they were written , i 'd have guessed late '40s , early '50s . 
  but anyway , this was hilarious :, 
   the first violins , goes the narrative , have the trickier parts to play , but the second violins are `` more fun at parties '' . 
  one second violin came up to me to say , `` that 's not true ... the first violins have the * higher * parts . '' `` do n't worry , '' i said . 
  `` no one will think you 're more fun at parties . '', 
  remember that one function of the new pagebot is that you can page as many people as you want in a single comment by listing them after the bot 's summons . 
  umm , no it should n't . 
  this is how all chat applications work and have worked for over a decade . 
  wait , the * third * tier of vsauce is * that * popular ? 
  i had no idea it was anywhere near that many subscribers . 
  most of this was free running , not parkour . 
  parkour is about efficient movement , free running has lots of flips and stuff that are purely for show . 
  it 's serious to musicians on the same way that artists today consider [ * white paintings * ] ( https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/98.308.a-c ) serious . 
  it 's am example of modern art , designed not to be `` good '' in and of itself , but instead to encourage deeper thought about its purpose . 
  the other reply does a great job of explaining exactly how and in what way 4 ' 33 '' accomplishes this . 
  i remember reading the first one in primary school , but i do n't think i read past that . 
  formatting-wise , you should not use an h1 heading in nearly all circumstances . 
  use an h2 , instead . 
  most importantly , it 'll remove the unnecessary drop-cap on the first paragraph . 
  you 've also got a problem where everything after `` drunken master '' and before `` master of many forms/warshaper '' is appearing in the `` third column '' , i.e. , off to the side of the page where it is unreadable . 
  if you fixed the original heading to remove the drop-cap , this allows it to display correctly , since the problem stems from your column break ( which you clearly intended to appear at the bottom of the first column ) occuring towards the top of the * second * column , and therefore forcing everything after it across to the mostly invisible third column . 
  you should also add the following to the top of the document . 
  it 'll get bullet points to display correctly ( a minor aspect that 's missing in the default formatting of the homebrewery template ) . 
  list-style-position : outside ;, 
  i 'd also suggest adding spaces on either side of slashes in titles . 
  the font does n't look very nice without them , with the slash overlapping the text slightly . 
  that seems like a * very * high formatting score for something that bears literally no resemblance to the official formatting . 
  just a tip , the generally accepted term for them is `` strong '' and `` weak '' saves . 
  sounds a little less definitive than `` good '' and `` bad '' . 
  if you want to store * all * of them , your best bet is a cloud backup provider . 
  carbonite and backblaze are probably the best options to look at . 
  i 'm assuming they meant [ this ] ( http://www.naturalcrit.com/homebrew/ ) . 
  dandwiki is generally best avoided . 
  look to the official unearthed arcana articles first for material beyond the officially released content . 
  if that does n't sate you , the next best place is the / r/unearthedarcana subreddit ( unaffiliated with the official ua articles ) , and / r/boh5e . 
  they have a strong culture of feedback , review , and improvement that dandwiki lacks , with boh being especially good , with in-depth reviews from experienced homebrewers . 
  sunday , us time . 
  it 's not homebrew if you 're going off of what you believe to be rai . 
  now , there 's an argument to be made either way on what * is * rai , but whichever result one goes with , it is ** not ** the same as homebrew . 
  yeah , season 1 was very much about penguin , and so was early season 2 , but lately his story has been put on the backburner a bit in favour of other villains . 
  and bruce ... 
   he was running ... making crazy close-call dodges, 
  these , i agree , are rogue-like abilities . 
   using the environment , sand thrown from the ground, 
  i think of these as very much the moves of a battlemaster fighter . 
  * especially * the trick with the sand , which could easily be one of their man\u0153uvres . 
   attacking with a short sword, 
  it 's been a while since i 've watched the episode , but i do n't * remember * him using any actual weapons other than his space sword , which would undoubtedly be statted as a longsword . 
  as someone with actual fencing training , i really do n't agree . 
  learning to hit someone with the edge is easy . 
  it 's learning to predict opponents ' movements and react to them , or to get past a good defence , that 's the hard part . 
  are you talking about the space sword ? 
  if so , no . 
  if you 're talking about something else , as i said , it 's been a while since i watched it , so you 're probably right . 
  he uses it two-handed on occasion , and it 's clearly a blade primarily designed for cutting , unlike the thrust-centric short sword ( which is , if we 're being realistic , most likely meant to be a smallsword , but could theoretically be a larger dagger like frodo 's * sting * ) . 
  but that excludes numbers beginning with 0 , which is ... most phone numbers without a country code ( 01 , 04 , and 09 are particularly popular in the countries i 've lived in , and i 'm sure other numbers are used elsewhere ) . 
  not to mention that yours is all 10 digit numbers . 
  most mobile numbers i know are 10 digits , but for landlines , 8 digits is the norm around here . 
  which actually raises an interesting point : a slider * would n't * work . 
  0123456789 is different to 123456789 , but a slider would necessarily treat them as the same number . 
  if d&d were a highly realistic system , i would agree without hesitation . 
  but this is another point where trying to think about it with too much realism causes things to fall apart . 
  no swordsman is wielding his weapon using just brute force and having `` strength '' represent your chance to hit makes for a very convenient game mechanic , but trying to use it to figure out how things would work in real life just is n't going to work . 
  i 'd stat it as a longsword because that 's what it clearly is . 
  it 's worth remembering that he was never actually very good with the sword . 
  his trusty boomerang was always his best weapon , along with his wits . 
  sokka himself would probably be dex-based , but when using the space sword , he 'd be relying on strength . 
  just a tip , if the terminology you 're using to describe a piece of homebrew is specific to some other obscure media , it 's best if you state where it 's coming from in the description . 
  hells , even if what you 're referencing is fairly well-known , it 's helpful to make things clear upfront , to avoid any possibility for confusion . 
  not really , because literally * does n't * `` mean '' the opposite of literally . 
  it 's just a word that is frequently used hyperbolously , and that hyperbole is so wide-spread that it 's made it into the dictionary . 
  the non-literal definition of `` literally '' only works because it 's making reference to the literal definition of it . 
  `` jealous '' , on the other hand , has come to truly mean both . 
  it 's arguably only a semantic difference , but i think it 's a large enough difference to be worth mentioning . 
  okay , so i just rewatched the second half of that episode ( from when he actually gets the sword ) . 
  the weapon appears to be about the length of an arm , which is just a touch shorter than [ the sword in this guy 's left hand ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/if_kxaqs_8k/maxresdefault.jpg ) , which i reckon would reach from the tips of his fingers to about the centre of his neck , or so . 
  but more importantly is to look at how he uses it . 
  he * mostly * uses it in two hands , and all the attack motions are slicing . 
  in d&d terms , that clearly marks it as a longsword . 
  a shortsword is more likely to look [ like this ] ( http://thebooktrap.weebly.com/uploads/2/7/0/0/27007717/5755495_orig.jpg ) . 
  no , it 's a smallsword . 
  they developed out of the rapier , but tend to have much smaller hilts , substantially shorter blades ( look at these ones compared to any image of a rapier -- rapiers are * big * ) , and also are more likely to have a triangular cross section , where rapiers have rectangular or maybe trapezoidal cross sections , with true cutting edges . 
  the smallsword is really more akin to the modern sporting \u00e9p\u00e9e than the rapier . 
  and it 's the best candidate for what d&d calls the `` short sword '' . 
  this is n't really the place for feedback . 
  there 's a link in the sidebar for that . 
  you can go there and add you vote to this , as it 's already one of the highest requested features . 
   * use ` sudo fs_usage ` from the terminal to show all disk read/write activity . 
  look for ` unconstrainable ` in the right-hand column . 
  would n't ` sudo fs_usage | grep unconstrainable ` be more useful , in that case ? 
  i would dispute your labelling of the appassionata as classical . 
  roughly speaking , beethoven 's third symphony is said to mark the beginning of the romantic era , and as far as i can tell , the appassionata came a few years after that . 
  plus , looking at the piece , it might not be a particularly complex one harmonically , but it certainly is full of the emotion and grandeur that was so important in the romantic era . 
  personally , it looks quite tenuous to me , but [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l3a5rkq.jpg ) is how i see it being a bat , if you really squint hard enough . 
  but his `` local address '' is n't localhost , it 's the address on the local network .
