  ah , good old muphry 's law . 
   widows of khals *, 
  yeah , it 's basically the only reference-based joke that i have never gotten tired of . 
  though this example was * especially * funny for some reason . 
  the completely smooth segue into `` and has shit fucking dialogue '' did it for me . 
  better than , like , youtube and twitch ? 
  i mean , they obviously aim to serve different markets , but i 'm * sure * their platforms ( or at least youtube -- it is backed by * google * after all -- if not twitch ) * could * do an even better job than the mlb 's platform does , if they decided to pivot . 
  shit , it is ? 
  do n't know how , but i had completely forgotten that . 
  thanks for the update . 
  i 've never finished dark cloud , but that 's not for want of trying . 
  i 've just never been able to defeat the dark genie . 
  i was only 10 the first time i got that far into the game , but then i moved overseas . 
  one holiday when i was back in my home country , about age 12 i think i tried again from the beginning , and got the whole way through the game , all cities 100 % happy , and still never managed to win that final boss fight . 
  i have n't gone back to the game since then , but i will one day . 
  i 've refused to watch the final cut scene or read anything about what happens after you win . 
  one day i will find out the right way . 
   this whole `` controversy '' only started because the mother asked for $ 30 million ( after lisa was already grown ) and he refused so she wrote a scathing memoir that was released after his death , and everyone decided to take it all at face value for some reason . 
  huh ? 
  this was well known to people who cared to follow the industry 's personalities for a long time . 
  it was a major feature of the 1999 docudrama pirates of silicon valley . 
  it would have truly been amazing . 
  looking at his later works , especially the requiem , he was clearly heading in the direction of romanticism . 
  had he remained alive , might it have been mozart , and not beethoven , that ushered in the new era ? 
  or at least , how might his continued existence have impacted the other composers around him , such as beethoven ? 
  and the other way , if mozart had heard beethoven 's third , or his ninth , what might that have done to change the way mozart himself composed ? 
  it 's kinda sad that we 'll never know . 
  i can tell you what my reaction was . 
  it was basically `` oh , they 're gon na be stuck here for a while until they can regain control of the city and then build more ships . 
  k. '' definitely not freaking out . 
  air asia is surprisingly good , as far as budget airlines go . 
  i learnt calculus in my third last year of school , so probably around age 15 or so . 
  that was in the most advanced maths class available at my school ( igcse additional mathematics ) . 
  my last two years of school , though , everyone learnt at least basic calculus ( ib maths studies ) , if not some more advanced stuff , with the most mathematically inclined students doing a heap of stuff up to but not including multivariate calculus ( hl maths ) . 
  muphry 's law , in case you 're interested , is basically the idea that whenever someone corrects someone else ( especially on the internet ) , they * will * make a mistake of their own in their `` correction '' . 
   if you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading , there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written . 
  this is actually a * really * good point . 
  australia * did * ** not ** ban guns . 
  all they did was implement a number of very strict regulations regarding the ownership of guns , along with a buyback scheme so anyone who previously owned a gun could get some money back for it . 
  it 's about sensible gun laws , and australia is one of the * best * countries to look at in this regard . 
  personally i 'm not a fan of your third bullet point , because that 's basically taking something that 's * already * a rule in 5e , but pointing out how one specific character can use it , rather than actually giving the ninja an extra option . 
  either that or , if you 're using this option as just `` a way to use wisdom on a skill even without the flavour justification '' , then you 're completely defeating the purpose of the skill . 
  i quite like your idea of having a static dc that scales at certain levels , that 's a neat idea . 
  not very elegant , but it works . 
  one thing that your comment just lead me to think of , is that perhaps some of the other existing ki options could be altered to use wisdom . 
  now , not all of the following will necessarily be appropriate , and i 'm not trying to make them so , but here 's an idea for each of them :, 
  * everything is a weapon : use wisdom in place of strength or dex, 
  * feathery tread : gain an extra 5 ft movement for every +1 to wis when using this feature, 
  * immaculate footwork : i dunno , got nothing, 
  * mastery of form : i dunno , maybe allow wisdom to replace con for concentration checks ? 
  * mastery of spirit : the weapon becomes a + ( wis mod / 2 ) minimum 1 , or maybe + ( wis mod / 2 ) rounding up ( min 1 ), 
  * stutter step : change it so that the teleportation is 10 ft per wisdom mod ( minimum 10 ), 
  * escape artist : got nothing, 
  * eyes of the ghost : 1 minute per wis mod, 
  * step upon air : no idea, 
  * veil of death : allow adding wis to the death saving throws imposed by this ability, 
  as i said , some of those are terrible ideas , some of them might be okay . 
  i was just trying to think of * any * way that a different ability could be used to them . 
  also , deathblow : restrict the number of dice rerolled to wis mod + 1, 
  mainly , i need an explanation for this thing 's flavour . 
  do they still serve a patron ? 
  they 've apparently unwillingly entered the pact , but i 'm not seeing anything here that actually says they 've * broken * the pact . 
  none of your opening paragraph makes any sense to me . 
  you need to put the spells into a table , rather than a bullet list . 
  polymorph should ** not ** be on the list . 
  it 's already a spell available through an invocation , and it 's been put there because it 's too powerful if it can be used as many times as the warlock wants , thanks to the short rest refreshing of spell slots . 
  some of the other spells you 've got might also have this problem , but i 'm not familiar with enough of them to comment . 
  an extra spell slot once per day seems like an * extremely * powerful feature for a first level one . 
  an offering in the dark seems like a pretty good ability . 
  earthly ties kind of forces the player into choosing * banishment * , but that 's not such a terrible thing , i think , for the flavour of this option . 
  and it fits as a mostly defensive ability as a level 10 warlock feature . 
  side note , spells are written in * italics * , and are not capitalised . 
  steal from the rich needs to be made a long-rest feature ( at the moment , it 's able to be used at-will , though i suspect this was just an oversight ) , but if you do that , i think it 's probably okay . 
  i personally like the charisma contest idea : it makes sense to me . 
  however , requiring the creature make a charisma saving throw against the warlock 's spell save dc is probably more appropriate . 
  hmm , yeah , that 's a good point . 
  perhaps it should say something along the lines of `` to reduce the damage taken by 2d6 '' ( or some other value ) instead of `` to reduce that damage to 0 '' . 
  but i agree completely that in terms of flavour , i just do not at all understand this . 
  a few of the spells gained make sense for someone aiming to avoid a former patron , and earthly ties is great , but the rest of it is really lacking . 
  as far as i can tell , it 's not really powers gained by breaking a pact , so much as the powers that someone who has put significant effort into avoiding a patron or would-be patron might like to have . 
  but that really does n't jive with progression in the warlock class itself . 
  a prc like you say could work . 
  i think it seems tempting to do it as a subclass , because the nearest relative of warlocks ( in terms of flavour ) -- the paladin -- has a subclass dedicated to those that break their equivalent . 
  but my response to that would be that the oathbreaker paladin is very badly named . 
  a paladin who breaks his oath should n't suddenly gain evil powers , he should lose access to everything . 
  that 's how it 's been described in novels , and that 's what makes sense with the flavour of the class . 
  the oathbreaker should have been named blackguard or something similar , and been based around a deliberate decision to be evil . 
   while the version i gave is the idea that your ninja has been trained in these skills for any situation ( and can this use wisdom in a situation-independent way ), 
  yeah , this is exactly what i have a * problem * with . 
  the flavour of a skill roll should n't change based on a class choice . 
  if a specific method of attempting to achieve something is charisma for one character , it should be charisma for everyone , and same with wisdom . 
  the difference with the ki abilities is that they 're abilities . 
  i agree , many of them are n't very good , but because they 're specific class abilities , rather than generic skill checks , it 's * slightly * more justifiable . 
  deathblow is being replaced entirely ? 
  that 's a shame . 
  i really liked the ability as-is . 
  it 's not like it was particularly weak , either . 
  it 's a little less powerful than the assassin 's death strike , perhaps , but substantially less situational , and guaranteed to work , rather than offering a save . 
  supergirl 's finished and gotham 's taking the week off . 
  if it were n't for game of thrones coming back , the start of this week would have been a very sad one , as far as my tv lineup goes .
