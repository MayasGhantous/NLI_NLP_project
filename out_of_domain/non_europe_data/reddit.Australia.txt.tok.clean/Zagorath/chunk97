  i like them because , like you said , it makes it feel like it 's one epic story rather than a series . 
  the one volume gives you the impression of how epic it really is , i do n't know how to word it properly . 
  i chose it because i thought it was funny . 
  it 's kinda ironic that he would be out of focus when he 's the dp . 
  but there is a picture , it 's just that the decided not to insert it a second time . 
  he 's in the same picture as jackson from return of the king . 
  they pointed him out with the arrow in that picture . 
  but yeah , all the other cameos are really interesting . 
  did n't mention jackson because i figured most people who care about lotr in the slightest already know that . 
  as a huge fan film music , and the music of lotr in particular , shore 's cameo was a really interesting one to me , too , as was osborne 's ( a producer ) , just because of what the role was , and the fact that the smithies in the film were smithies from the actual crew . 
  the next page , `` special extras '' has some more cool ones , like tolkien 's great-grandson , and the children of many of the actors . 
  my favourite from the second page was that tolkien 's great-grandson was given a part . 
  haha interesting thought . 
  i did n't even notice it there . 
  got ta say i do n't see the point of it , but nor do i really see the harm in it either . 
  late reply , i 've only just come across this . 
  but i would tend to agree , lifehacker can be great for til stuff , that part at least seems unfair . 
  the streisand effect is the only reason i 've heard of this story , really . 
  because of the huge outrage over it resulting in subreddits banning gawker links was what caused some podcasts i listen to to mention it , and that was the first time i ever heard about this story . 
  i 'm late to this particular page , because i 've only just now even come across the issue mentioned on reddit itself . 
  your bit about :, 
   how may people occasionally browse lifehacker and have absolutely no idea that any of this creepshot crap ever happened ? 
  how much attention will you bring to this issue in the future simply by forcing subscribers to research it because there is a rule sticking out like a sore thumb ? 
  is ** absolutely correct ** . 
  yes !, 
  i love doing this !, 
  it 's a really fun exercise . 
  for those that do n't already know : [ international music score library project ] ( http://imslp.org/wiki ), 
  haha that was actually my first reaction to op . 
  i was a little tempted to say, 
  but figured that 's a bit douchy . 
  i think the point you were trying to make has some validity . 
  western culture has some aspects that are * objectively * ( perhaps not quite objectively , but in a way that few people would disagree with ) better than some other cultures . 
  however , many other cultures also have aspects that make them * objectively * ( again , i do use the term somewhat loosely ) better than western culture . 
  there are probably some other points that are neither advantages nor disadvantages per se , too . 
  overall i do n't think you can make any claim about any culture being superior to another . 
  they each have their advantages and disadvantages , so to speak . 
   sourcebooks are usually set either around the year 1600 of the third age , or just after the war of the ring, 
  is the `` or '' there used to refer to * either a or b * , or is it used as an expansion ( like saying `` the year 1920 , or just after world war i '' ) ? 
  if the former , then what 's the reason behind the choice of 1600 ? 
  i do n't see anything particularly significant happening then apart from the founding of the shire . 
  i 've asked myself this many times . 
  the main reasons i can think of are, 
  a ) it would have taken a long time . 
  time scales are not shown very well in the book , and even worse in the movies , but the time to travel that distance would be enough that mordor probably would have had time to get another army out to minas tirith and attack again ( and that 's assuming aragorn and the others knew what frodo was doing , and did n't go and launch their assault on the black gate in vain , as frodo and sam would be nowhere near the mountain by then ) . 
  b ) they would have to go through huge distances of open land absolutely covered with orcs and other foul creatures . 
  the distance between ephel d\u00faath and orodruin is tiny when compared to the distance of going right around the dead marches , then around ered lithui , out around that bit of the mountains sticking south into mordor , before coming back up north through the open plateau of gorgoroth on the way to orodruin . 
  oh ok , thanks . 
  if it 's the latter ( which , without any context , does seem more likely ) , then it 's factually incorrect . 
  without knowing any specific dates , it 's fairly basic lotr knowledge that the war of the ring was the end of the third age , so anything after that ca n't be * any * year number of the third age , it must be in the fourth age . 
  with specific dates in mind , wotr took place after the year 3000 ta . 
  edit : actually , i just noticed the word `` either '' in there , which does imply they meant the former . 
  whoops , my bad . 
  why the hell is that ? 
  maybe i just do n't want to run the risk of having problems with my computer 's operating system ? 
  it 's not like downloading some game or movie where if something goes wrong you can easily just try again or forget about it . 
  if something goes wrong you do n't have a working computer anymore . 
  sorry , but operating systems are the one thing i refuse to pirate , ** ever ** . 
  not to mention that there are plenty of people out there who just do n't want to pirate anything at all because , hey , these companies make good products and they deserve to be paid for them . 
  i can confirm this . 
  i live in vietnam , and when i first came here i went to a major computer store to buy an off-the-shelf computer . 
  it came with a pirated version of windows . 
  i was seriously pissed because we did n't get it for any cheaper than it would be in australia ( indeed , as bad as aussie prices on things are , it 's nothing compared to vietnamese hardware prices ) , and they gave absolutely no prior indication that it would be pirated . 
  next time i bought a computer i made sure to ask for the windows install disk and got it legit . 
  pirated dvds are sold in all the major shopping centres ( including my local grocery store ) . 
  are there any forms of taxes on it ? 
  i genuinely do n't know . 
  a high dollar should mean cheaper imports . 
  basic macroeconomics . 
  oh of course . 
  there are zero generalisations that work all the time -- wait ... 
  yeah i saw a number of problems with the story in this . 
  the main ones were :, 
  at 5:50 , why does she just walk out : surely she 'd know their recognition would get her immediately , that bit makes no sense . 
  why do they go back in time , how are they supposed to change anything at the time they go back to ? . 
  to me , it would make so much more sense to go further back in time to before this was set up , or go back at a more logical location maybe . 
   considering how damn time consuming the whole program is , it 's actually incredible that people voluntarily come on here, 
  i `` found '' reddit ( i already knew about it from a lot earlier , but i first started actively visiting reddit ) 3 months before i had my final exams last may . 
  oh god . 
  not to mention , for the age question the age of the participant matters . 
  an 18-year-old saying they 'll date people from 14-22 is very different from a 24-year-old saying they 'll date from 20-28 . 
  yeah . 
  my answer is yes if they 're only moderately religious , but if they 're really preachy i do n't think so . 
  small random extra thing ( on top of the problem of separating questions , which to me is more important ) , you 've made gender check boxes but all the others are radio buttons , you oughta fix that . 
  i saw it , i just do n't see the relevance . 
  assuming he means pc as `` non-mac computer '' , why does that change anything i said ? 
   other iterations of windows however , like 7 , by all means - pony up the cash and support microsoft, 
  you say that as i it 's up to you what i 'm going to do . 
  i happen to really like windows 8 , if you do n't then fine , but do n't act as if your opinion is the objective truth . 
  umm ... why is that ? 
  your previous comment implied that prices are high because the aussie dollar is at record heights . 
  that is n't how economics works . 
  the price of these things i 'm the us is stable , let 's say something costs $ 100 . 
  when the aussie dollar buys 50c us , it will cost $ 200 au . 
  if the aussie and us dollars are equal , it should then cost $ 100 . 
  if the aud got to the point where $ 1au = $ 2us , that same $ 100 dollar item should cost an aussie just $ 50 au . 
  there 's been actual mention of plans to do this !? 
  wicked !, 
  but it 'll be based on the musical ? 
  that 's a shame , a story twice removed from the original book seems ... odd .
