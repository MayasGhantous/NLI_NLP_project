  the third backslash means the first one escapes the second , so the second one gets displayed , and the third one escapes the underscore , resulting in the correct emoticon being displayed for our viewing pleasure . 
  no but seriously , fuck olly . 
   if something as niche as anime is this cheap with such a relatively small market, 
  i suspect it 's the opposite . 
  economies of scale do n't have much of an effect when it comes to digital redistribution , so price is determined largely by demand . 
  anime has low demand , so they ca n't charge as much for it as a show that everyone wants to talk about . 
  it astonishes me that they can even charge that much , to be honest . 
  is n't that more than netflix costs ? 
  i actually think kodak is the * perfect * analogy here for foxtel , which is why i used them . 
  many other technology shifts were probably avoided mostly out of ignorance , but kodak very deliberately decided not to push forward digital technology in order to keep film sales secure . 
  personally , i never used the ai settings , but i just * hated * the combat system . 
  it was dull and repetitive and made the game a slog to get through . 
  once i turned the difficult down , it was still dull and repetitive and the game was still a slog , but at least i could get through the awesome story without needing to do the same fights half a dozen times . 
  ninjaedit : on pc, 
  for the lazy , that 's about $ 0.61 aud at the moment . 
  semihemidemisemiquavers is the one i was going for , five flags . 
  but yeah , you 're right , i was adding things the wrong way around . 
  i 've seen it show up in the grave sections of beethoven 's path\u00e9tique sonata , but i think that 's the only time i 've seen them . 
  hey , this is a subreddit for sharing stories about gaming . 
  if you want help , i would suggest going to / r/dndnext ( if you 're playing 5th edition ) or / r/dnd ( if you 're playing any other edition ) and asking there . 
  your dm might also get some good advice at / r/dndbehindthescreen . 
  hey , weirdly specific minor issue , but could you update the default css to have the following :, 
  list-style-position : outside ;, 
  at the moment , the text in an unordered list wraps underneath the bullet point on the second line , which does n't match the phb 's normal format ( see prestidigitation , pg . 
  267 or most feats , pp . 
  165-170 for examples ) . 
  cheers . 
  you 're right that it 's not homebrewery 's * fault * per se ( n.b. , that 's the expression you were looking for , it 's latin , i believe ) , but it certainly is a problem when it comes to individuals seeking out homebrew content that 's worth using in a way that without homebrewery was often fairly easy to tell . 
  of course , there 's still comments , and personally i find myself more and more looking to the comments to see what others think before i 'll even look at something myself , unless it 's from a known quality submitter , because that 's another great way to filter out results . 
  my biggest problem with homebrewery , to be honest , is n't what op has noted , it 's that so many people use the damned thing wrong . 
  making < h1  headings when they mean < h2  is the most common problem , but there are others as well ( layout problems are pretty common too , especially among firefox users ) . 
  what , did people just eat a whole loaf at a time before then ? 
  that looks like snow falling over eastern europe . 
  edit : it looks like that on mobile , not on desktop :(, 
  nutcracker and handel 's messiah in november and december !, 
   make sure not to mess up the timeline , barry !, 
   lol hi past friends , what if we do this shit differently to last time ? 
  yeah my group uses it too . 
  personally i 'm trying to convince them to make it not work when the enemy us a size larger than you , but the idea of * not * using it between medium creatures is insane just from a logic perspective . 
  loosely related , are we gon na get another election-focused season of gruen ? 
  it 's too late now because renewable have become efficient and cheap enough that to start nuclear from scratch at this point would be more costly than going all in on renewables . 
  that 's what i 've heard , anyway . 
  i do n't personally know how true it is . 
  for the lazy , can anyone explain the reason they 're moving away from using them ? 
  except he never tried at all . 
  practically the moment he arrived he started fucking shit up . 
  what annoys me is that the show has just completely ignored the consequences of this , so far . 
  the end of that episode showed a couple of minor changes , but even those have been ignored in subsequent episodes ... 
  touch\u00e9, 
  the top tier is / r/boh5e , but that is unfortunately very slow to add new content . 
  they ca n't wear * medium armour * and still fly . 
  there 's no way they 're carrying even a halfling . 
  do you also ban familiars or companions with flight ? 
  yeah but at showing the popularity of all the races and classes on a graph would n't be much of a problem , and would be so much more useful than their convoluted attempts at explaining things . 
  holt shit this is amazing . 
  hear , hear !, 
  i do n't think this is a good argument . 
  i do n't think humans are overpowered , but your argument is easy to dispel from a devil 's advocate point of view . 
  after level 4 , humans have two feats to everyone else 's one , or they have a feat and an asi to everyone else 's choice of one of those . 
  look to lexijeid 's comment above for a good argument to the same conclusion . 
  oh that 's interesting , does habitica use twig as its templating engine ? 
  because that looks a lot like twig being displayed literally instead of parsed . 
   basically felt like a suburban washington dc, 
  must be something about planned cities that exist primarily for political purposes . 
  he 's already announced very publicly that there * will * be an election in july this year . 
  he has n't officially gone to the gg yet , so technically he could back down , but after being so public in stating he would , that would look * very * bad for him . 
  and , as the other reply said , there 'll be one later this year if he does n't call the dd for july . 
   i on the other hand stab the fork at the edge of the meat and remove the main part of the steak . 
  oh wow , i did n't know people * did n't * do this . 
  i guess i need to pay more attention to how others eat ... 
  why ca n't they rip you off on a pi ? 
  all the online stores that cater specifically to australia do ... 
  yeah . 
  if wearing * medium * armour is enough to hinder their flying , of * course * they 're not going to be able to * carry * someone . 
  imgur still fulfils its initial purpose just fine . 
  it 's still super easy to go there , drag an image onto the page , and share the link to that image . 
  if it also plays host to a shitty social network with a shitty audience , who cares ? 
  i never have to see that when i go about my work of uploading and linking to pictures directly . 
  to do that , they 'd have to get really good at telling what is even in images . 
  [ wait ... ] ( http://googleresearch.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/building-deeper-understanding-of-images.html ), 
  literally 5 comments earlier in this very thread :, 
   we support importing compendium xml files, 
  the most obvious and simple thing you can do is replace `` god '' with `` gods '' , `` hell '' with `` hells '' , etc. 
  instead of saying `` oh my god '' you say `` oh my gods '' , `` gods above !, 
  '' , or `` watching gods !, 
  '' ; instead of `` what the hell ? '', 
  it 's `` what in the hells ? '', 
  or , as you came up with `` what in the nine hells ? '', 
  you can get a bit more specific by calling out specific gods as appropriate . 
   and likely two 17-18 rolls, 
  holy shit that 's high rolling . 
  my preferred rolling method * usually * results it at least one 16 + ( before racial modifiers ) , and two is not rare , but i would n't call it `` likely '' either . 
  but i definitely agree that in general , taking a method of rolling characters can be fantastic , but you need some variation from the suggested method to allow for slightly more consistent characters . 
   i actually do n't like the idea of prestige classes , they just do n't feel like 5th edition, 
  i thought pretty much the same as you at first . 
  i thought they were a bad sign of the 3.5 era bloat and min-maxing that should be avoided at all costs . 
  but then i saw [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/comments/3qnv6q/vampire_prestige_class_v04_little_changes_big/ ) . 
  and i was completely sold on the idea . 
  they have to exist within a certan scope , but the idea of them works perfectly . 
  first and foremost , they must * not * step on the toes of a full class .
