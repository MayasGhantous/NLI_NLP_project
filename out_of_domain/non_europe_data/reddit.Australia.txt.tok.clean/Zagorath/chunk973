  but yeah , that should have come out today . 
  i 'm a bit surprised that it has n't . 
  perhaps it 's been delayed until next week ? 
  \\* unless they saw the negative reaction to that last time and have decided to back down . 
  though i doubt it , because they have n't said anything to that effect , to my knowledge . 
   have they said that every odd month 's ua is definitely gon na be a dm 's guild review ? 
  i thought that got some pretty significant backlash . 
  they did say that back with the initial announcement , yes . 
  and yeah , it was very poorly received . 
  but they 've not said anything about backing down on it , to my knowledge . 
  i saw the name `` non zero day '' and the first thing that i thought of was that it might be a sub about securing software to prevent zero-day flaws . 
  but this is just as good . 
  better , even , since its potential audience is probably much larger . 
  one good thing to do is see if you can find creative commons licensed stuff . 
  on the guild you 'll need it to * not * be cc-by-nc , but for here that 's fine , and any other combination is fine anywhere . 
  i think the fact that arrays are nothing more than pointers to the first address in the array ( combined with the fact that strings are just pointers to an array of chars , where the `` end '' of the string is just the first \\ 0 encountered ) probably causes further confusion for beginners . 
  mate , it 's been changed since * at least * examinations in may 2011 . 
   8 failures for every success you get, 
  where are you getting that number from ? 
  assuming your above numbers are correct , you 're looking at 19 failures for every success over three years , and 9 failures for every success in a one-year period . 
  tl ; dr : it 's even worse than the quoted text makes it appear . 
  that 's got ta be satire , right . . ? 
  please tell me that 's satire . 
  hahaha this is awesome . 
  also , i 'm pretty sure he 's playing from the same arrangement/transcription that i have . 
   movie soundtrack music is definitely orchestral and in a classically-influenced style, 
  some is , but not all . 
  williams ' catch me if you can is far more jazz influenced than classical , most of zimmer 's stuff is more like modern synth stuff than classical/orchestral , and there are also more rock or pop style soundtracks out there . 
   the primary form is not as sheet music, 
  hmm , i 'm not really sure i agree . 
  the actual orchestra that was involved in recording the music certainly is playing from sheet music . 
  just because the sheet music is n't as readily available to the public as classical stuff is , does n't mean it is n't the `` primary form '' . 
  remember that tale about young mozart ? 
  hey sorry , but we require submissions to be complete material in their own right . 
  if you 're asking for a specific piece of existing homebrew that you know has been submitted here before , you could try google ( use `` site : reddit.com \\ / r/unearthedarcana '' to restrict it to searching this subreddit ) or reddit 's search . 
  if that does n't work , try asking in the latest arcana forge megathread . 
  hey , i 've flaired this for you this time , but in the future , please remember to add the appropriate flair yourself . 
  you think that 's complicated ? 
  try ` char ( * ( * x ( ) ) [ 5 ] ) ( ) ` or ` int ** ( * f ) ( int ** , int ** ( * ) ( int ** , int ** ) ) ` . 
  pretty sure that 's exactly what i said . 
  all this is great , but i think you 've missed out the single greatest thing about williams ' scores . 
  his use of leitmotif . 
  williams does a great job of writing leitmotifs to represent different people , places , and ideas . 
  each of the motifs just seem like the perfect expression of what they represent , and then he reuses , develops , and alters them perfectly to follow the development of characters in the film . 
  for example , anakin 's theme , from the star wars prequels ( particularly phantom menace ) was based melodically on vader 's theme , but really only in a very subtle way for the most part ( it has more explicit quotations later on in the piece ) . 
  more recently , you can look at rey 's theme , and see how it feels harmonically similar to the force theme ( and then listen in the credits of the film as he masterfully interweaves the melodies of each of these two themes ) , representing rey 's apparent strength in the force . 
  or look at how williams uses a motif similar to one from anakin 's dark deeds in association with kylo ren , or how the main kylo ren theme is related subtly to anakin 's betrayal . 
  it 's this use of motives which on their own do a good job of representing their subject , but also go an amazing job of showing how different things in the world are related , that marks williams as an incredible film composer . 
  you see the same kind of thing done in shore 's lord of the rings score , and a far less subtle version in the scores to game of thrones and avatar , but williams is one of the only composers that can consistently pull it off extremely well in a wide variety of genres of film . 
   but for 2016 the 150 hours still applied, 
  nope . 
  as i said , that was removed as of * at the latest * 2011 . 
   hitting a downed character adds 2 to their fail count, 
  hitting them adds 1 to their fail count . 
  hitting them with a critical hit adds 2 . 
  only attacks from within 5 feet are automatic criticals ( all attacks , though , are made with advantage ) . 
  lol wtf ? 
  people still use cheques ? 
  this is 10 months ago !, 
  only an autocrit if it 's from within 5 feet . 
  i saw a chicken crimpy on the shelves about a week ago . 
  i was confused about what it was , because it * looked * like the normal chicken one i like to get , but it had a funny new name . 
  hey sorry , but this subreddit is for sharing stories that you found or that happened at your table . 
  this question would be better directed at / r/dnd or / r/dndnext . 
  you 'll want to use photoshop with the brushes that can be found in the resources in the sidebar . 
  in the future , please direct this type of question to the arcana forge megathread , and not as top level submissions . 
  hey , you need to put a blank line in between paragraphs on reddit for things to display correctly . 
  have a look at [ our style guide ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) for more advanced formatting information . 
  awesome job . 
   well it runs all the way from the goldcoast, 
  but infuriatingly stops well before the gold coast airport . 
  to get to it by public transport involves a train and two buses from brisbane ... 
  i do n't care what the * reason * is , it 's absurd that there 's no train running to the gold coast airport . 
  thanks for saving us the click . 
  now , i have a few questions , aimed at no one in particular . 
  is this `` reputation '' value the same as the normal university rankings people look at , or is it a separate metric ? 
  what 's the methodology ? 
  who is involved in this process ? 
  because i 've heard nothing but bad things about academic practises in china , with things like plagiarism being neigh encouraged , but the article says they 're moving up . 
  could that he because more chinese are being involved in the voting process than before , or is it a genuine reflection of the fact that they are improving ? 
  this is great !, 
  devs , hire this guy immediately !, 
  ( or just license this logo or whatever . ), 
  oh my gods what the fuck , government that 's even worse !, 
  here in australia , $ 100 in the * maximum * amount that can be done without requiring a pin when using visa paywave/mastercard paypass ( the tap to pay options ) . 
  it 's a nice value because it 's large enough that you nearly never need to use the pin even on relatively large shopping trips , but low enough that not many luxury items can be bought with it . 
  if you want feedback on homebrew material , you 'd be * far * better off submitting on / r/unearthedarcana than here . 
  fallout 2 came out in 1998 . 
  it would probably have been written for classic macos . 
  the wikipedia article says it 's for os x , but since that did n't come out until 1999 , i 'm sceptical . 
  even so , if it * was * os x , it 's still * definitely * for ppc versions , since the move to intel did n't happen until about 2006 . 
  the last version of os x to support rosetta was snow leopard , so it 's impossible to run ppc apps on intel macs . 
  steam wo n't sell something that ca n't run , and unlike gog , they 're not in the business of making it easy to run old games on new platforms . 
  while you 're doing special cases , in australia , the norm is xxxx xxx xxx for mobile numbers . 
  the burden is always on the issuing bank or the debit card producer ( visa/mastercard ) , and never on the user . 
  there 's zero risk involved ( and besides , when you 've got you card in a wallet with like 3 other rfid cards , even the theoretical risk of walk by swiping is negated ) . 
  the convenience of paywave far outweighs any potential risks of it . 
  as someone who grew up in australia in the very late 20th and early 21st centuries , i 'm far more familiar with `` that 's what she said '' . 
  mainly only know of `` said the actress to the bishop '' thanks to the office . 
  that 's a very interesting story , and it provides an explanation for the origin of the latter phrase , but does n't actually answer op 's question .
