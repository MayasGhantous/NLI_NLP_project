  asked how much for it , and the guy quoted something in egyptian pounds that would have been over $ 100 . 
  we just laughed and left . 
  he followed and kept lowering the price ; even got down to a price we would have been willing to pay for , but because of how stupid the price he started at was , there was no way that was happening . 
  pffft ap amateurs . 
  ca n't even get their subreddit trending . 
  in a sense , though much more rigorous , at least if one is undergoing the entire diploma programme ( which is what most people mean when they say ib ) . 
  the ibdp involves doing six subjects , three ( or four ) at `` higher level '' and three ( or two ) at `` standard level '' . 
  the subjects must cover each of six groups , which are , roughly speaking `` first languages '' , `` second language '' , `` humanities/social sciences '' , `` experimental sciences '' , `` maths '' , and `` arts & electives '' . 
  the '' & electives '' in that second bit basically means students can elect not to do an art in favour of a second subject from one of the other groups . 
  in addition to these six subjects , students do what the ib calls the `` core '' . 
  the core is made up of an extended essay , which is a 4000 word in-depth research project on a topic of the student 's choice , theory of knowledge , which is a sort of precursor to philosophy , and cas , which is basically mandated extracurricular activities ( which must cover all three aspects of cas , creativity , action , and service , or roughly speaking , the arts , sports , and community service ) . 
  individual subject curricul\u00e6 are very much comparable to ap or to england 's a-levels , i believe , apart from perhaps one or two particularly difficult subjects ( though i 've not taken either of those , so i ca n't say for sure ) , but what makes ib stand out is the overall rigour it instills by having to do such a large number of subjects , the breadth of learning it requires of students , and the degree to which it prepares students for university , by way of the large amounts of research-based assignments , and of course the ee . 
  each subject is scored out of 7 , with a 4 being a pass , and the ee and tok are worth a combined 3 points on [ a matrix ] ( http://blogs.osc-ib.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ee_tok-matrix.png ) . 
  so total scores are out of 45 . 
  you should see some of the theatre arts initialisms . 
  i did n't take the subject , but i had friends that did , and their initialisms are crazy . 
  things like ipp , tppp , and ppp . 
  it 's just bizarre . 
   title is `` oathbreaker '' , but no brienne, 
  well of course not !, 
  she 's the oath keeper !, 
  oh no , i do n't hate . 
  i think it 's really quite cool actually . 
  the worst bit of all is :, 
   this spell creates a warded area, 
  around the creature that attacks and other creatures, 
  can not pass through . 
  which just does n't make sense . 
  i 'm not even 100 % sure what this is meant to do . 
  less significant errors include :, 
  * `` wizard '' in the arcane nursery class list . 
  * `` s , v , m '' instead of `` v , s , m '' in the arcane nursery components, 
  * `` worth 10 or more gp '' instead of `` worth at least 10 gp '' in the same, 
  * many cases of awkward run-on sentences that should be broken up by commas or rearranged to clarify things, 
  * dalliance says `` 1 reaction '' instead of `` 1 reaction '' , and does n't clarify * in the `` casting time '' section * when the reaction is taken . 
  * a space between the / u / and your username in the credits, 
  the formatting is also quite strange . 
  the gaps between spell school & level and the casting time , and then between class list and description , are far larger than they should be . 
  some of these are obviously not grammatical errors per se , but are inconsistencies with the 5e style . 
  do n't get me wrong , all of these apart from that first one are incredibly minor issues . 
  i would n't have even bothered pointing them out if someone else had n't already brought up formatting issues . 
  the actual spells themselves are really cool . 
  not something i think any pc would ever choose to take , but as ideas for spells that could exist in a world , they 're awesome . 
  i ' v not played deadlands , but personally that sounds kinda lame to me . 
  i 'd need some more clarification on how exactly it works before i could make a definitive answer , though . 
  this was ages ago , so it was probably more like 8.75 usd with how the currencies fluctuated . 
  they were ok . 
  fuck olly , and fuck the watch . 
  also kills pretenders to the throne . 
  though admittedly , one of the kings from the war of five kings did outlive stannis ... 
  worth noting that in season 1 , the theme we now know as littlefinger 's theme was actually used as the lannister theme . 
  djawadi had n't come up with a theme for rains yet at that point . 
   why does all of god 's judgment get issued out of you 're mouth ? 
  he 's god !, 
  he can talk for himself !, 
  careful now , that 's blasphemy . 
  it should say, 
   why does all of the gods ' judgment get issued out of your mouth ? 
  they can talk for themselves !, 
  ( plus a bonus grammar error correction ), 
  [ adwd ] ( #b `` if he was legitimised , is n't he then brynden targaryan , and not rivers ? '' ), 
  hahaha i have no idea . 
  they were pringles , but i do n't remember which flavour . 
  this was , like , 8 years ago or something . 
   { { something } } on this site is at your own risk, 
  the { { something } } could quite possibly be `` parking '' . 
  [ here 's another one ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4fz1y2/eidolonist _ v03_now_with_formatting / ) . 
  i ca n't comment on its quality : i 've not personally read through it . 
  yeah that 's what i ended up doing . 
  not using image magick though , just using the separate images that i already had . 
  a weird baader-meinhoff going on here , though . 
  just yesterday i spent like 90 minutes trying to figure out how to get the wiki running on my kubuntu computer to display images rather than errors , and googling only showed up stuff to do with image magick , which is a tool i had * never * heard of before . 
  that , frankly , does n't make any sense . 
  having a cabinet that 's hostile to one another would never make for a functional parliament . 
  changing the voting system to a more proportional system , such as stv or possibly mmp ( preferably * not * a party list variant of it ) would result in a parliament where no single party can achieve a majority on its own , and would require compromise on policy matters . 
  that would be a good thing . 
  but legislating to require the * cabinet * be proportional to votes is just bizarre . 
  honestly , i wish they would put their efforts into encouraging a forum with a far greater emphasis on producing quality content . 
  a place where users are encouraged to give feedback and creators to iterate on their designs based on this feedback . 
  dm 's guild , by its design , does not do well at this , and because of that , i do n't ever feel that i could trust anything from it to the same degree that i trust / r/boh5e and / r/unearthedarcana . 
  personally , i always thought some of the best stuff about the ua articles was the design notes we got from them . 
  tips about * why * wizards made the decisions they did , and how they go about creating new player options . 
  if these articles ( 1 ) were not falsely masquerading under the title of `` unearthed arcana '' , and ( 2 ) involved some in-depth review and thoughts on the design of the homebrew stuff , by the wizards team , then i might think them worthwhile . 
  as it is , i 'm not even going to bother looking at any of these . 
   like create thumbnails of images you upload, 
  yeah , that 's where my issue was . 
  the image was quite large , and the defaults that mediawiki was setting for its cache were too low , so it was n't able to create the thumbnail images . 
  it was a one-line fix , but the available support forums were particularly unhelpful in this case , so it took a long time to come across the solution . 
  i just found it interesting because yesterday was the * first * time i had ever come across this thing , and then today i come across you talking about it in a completly unrelated topic . 
  i would n't have ever thought to use it for this , since i had assumed it was mainly just a sort of automated tool . 
  i 'd have probably used photoshop or possibly tried to struggle through gimp , had i not already had the two images separately . 
  aye , but why did she name it that ? 
  i read the summaries wizards provided us with . 
  none of them grabbed me very much , to be honest . 
  i 'm sure they do what they 're trying to do very well , but what they 're trying to do is n't interesting to me . 
  no , she did . 
  i think he nodded in approval or something , though . 
  what about the drowned god ? 
  i do n't see the relevance . 
  note that i was n't complaining about their balance .
