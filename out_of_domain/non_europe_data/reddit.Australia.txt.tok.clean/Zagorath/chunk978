  on the other hand , if the last part * is * only a single byte , there are only 256 possibilities for it anyway . 
  if it 's a video or audio file , it can probably be ignored . 
  if it 's some sort of executable , it 's pretty feasible to just try all possibilities and compare those against the known hash for the torrent . 
  what if it 's a bunch of smaller files ? 
  i actually do n't know how the bittorrent protocol works in this respect . 
  would you have to hash the * entire * directory , or could you just hash each file separately and compare it to its known value ? 
  processing power is likely to be fairly negligible , but seeding can have a serious impact on your network performance . 
  personally i make sure to turn it off while gaming or on skype , but for browsing the web there 's nothing wrong with leaving it on : the performance impact is n't * that * detrimental . 
  you 're helping the ecosystem work by keeping it on . 
  i especially try to keep seeding rarer things when i come across them . 
  the latest episode of game of thrones probably does n't need your help , but that obscure video game from your childhood : keep that one going for a while . 
  thinking about that one case where the judge learned java so he would have a better understanding of how programming works in a case he was presiding over always makes me feel warm inside . 
  then i remember a higher court overturned his ruling and i go back to hating the world . 
  edit : hahaha , i just learnt that said judge 's middle name is `` haskell '' . 
  i would assume they already have . 
  os x has a few voices that sing . 
  one sings everything to the tune of in the hall of the mountain king ( named `` cellos '' ) , one to big ben ( `` bells '' ) , one to pomp and circumstance ( `` good news '' ) , chopin 's funeral march ( `` bad news '' ) , and one that i do n't recognise ( `` pipe organ '' ) . 
  personally i think it 's a shit ad because no where is it made clear that it * is * an ad . 
  it looks more like secret product placement than a clearly defined ad . 
  if clicking the logo took you to one of those `` discuss this ad '' pages , i would feel a lot better about it . 
  well , motorbikes * are * popular in countries like vietnam . 
  could someone explain the pun ? 
  au , actually . 
  capitalisation matters in chemical symbols . 
  oh right , thanks , lol . 
  are you , by any chance , familiar with / u/acegiak 's [ alternate humans ] ( / r/boh5e/comments / 49k9l6/alternate _ humans_by_uacegiak / ) ? 
  the pipe ( | ) is located on the same key as the backslash ( \\ ) on standard us keyboards , in the shift position ( and most others ) . 
  it 's generally located above the enter key . 
  i hate the cold . 
  brisbane is far too cold for me during winter . 
  but no , it is not cold here yet . 
  i 'm still comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt , while wet , when getting out of the shower at 9 o'clock . 
  i ca n't even begin to understand why someone would consider entering their credit card details onto a website in order to meet someone off a dating app . 
   then she said she wanted to meet up -- again this should have been a warning sign in hindsight, 
  now , i 've never actually used tinder , but i 'm not sure i follow here . 
  can someone else explain what he 's getting at ? 
  it seems to me that eventually meeting up with people you connect with is the entire * point * . 
  i can understand if you ca n't , but is there any chance you could share some vague details about exactly how that happened ? 
  more like, 
  if ( name = = `` albert anderson '' ), 
  return e ;, 
  else if ( name = = `` beatrice ackerman '' ), 
  return e ;, 
  else if ( name = = `` chris agurwal '' ), 
  return e ;, 
  else if ( name = = `` dennis anwich '' ), 
  return e ;, 
  explicitly using braces is just good coding style , and the above code seems to use the ugly and more difficult to visually parse ( but more convenient for this exercise , since it results in a larger line count ) style of putting opening braces on their own line . 
  this way takes up four times as many lines as yours does . 
  it 's an ugly coding style compared to egyptian braces . 
  what more is there to say ? 
  no way , python is the shit !, 
  compared to js , which is just shit . 
  my experience has been different . 
  it was n't so , it was a different programming-related se , but i feel the point still stands . 
  i posted a question i needed an answer to . 
  a lot of good back and forth goes on in the comments under the question helping to clarify it , but more so helping to arrive at possible solutions . 
  i had to go home at this point , before i could fully try out what the comments were suggesting . 
  by the time i get home , the whole chain is gone . 
  some douchebag mod has come along and decided that helping find answers to people 's questions is n't what the site is about . 
  it 's apparently essential to have succinct responses with no conversation aimed at arriving at said responses . 
  all that useful stuff has been deleted , with no way to get it back . 
  try reporting the mod to the admins , but they 've got his back , because again , fuck actually * helping * people . 
  honestly , for me , * decreasing * difficulty was necessary to get maximum enjoyment out of that game . 
  the combat system was just plain unfun . 
  having to do the same combats over and over again because i keep dying just makes it even worse . 
  low difficulty combat was still unfun , but at least i only had to go through any particular combat once . 
  are you sure you like games ? 
  oh i had completely forgotten about stonecunning . 
  i 've never played a dwarf . 
  in light of that , i think that emulating that is probably fine . 
  but rather than giving proficiency * or * double proficiency if you 're already proficient , you should just straight up give double proficiency . 
  that is in line with what stonecunning does . 
  edit : see my reply to the other commentor for the maths of advantage vs. double proficiency . 
  the * conditional * double proficiency is very weird . 
  giving straight up double proficiency is fine , as would just giving proficiency . 
  but giving proficiency to most people , but double proficiency to those that are already proficient is n't great design . 
  with that in mind , granting double proficiency is pretty much straight up better than advantage . 
  it 's +4 from the beginning , and becomes +6 just one level after most characters ' first opportunity to take the feat . 
  and this is a bonus that is flat , no matter what the dc . 
  the `` advantage = +5 '' rule of thumb is not actually a very good one . 
  it 's accurate if the dc is 10 , but advantage becomes more useful for lower dcs , but less useful for higher ones . 
  dc 15 , advantage is equivalent to just under +4 . 
  dc 20 , advantage is worth less than +1 . 
  ( [ reference ] ( http://anydice.com/program/8560 ) ), 
  so using the comparative balance as a reason to do the proficiency thing , rather than advantage , is a poor argument . 
  personally , i think either would be fine , but i 'd lean towards advantage just as the simpler mechanic . 
  vicu\u00f1as are generally pretty peaceful compared to alpacas and llamas . 
  they also have way nicer wool . 
  it 's called taking an `` anticipated '' subject . 
  it 's not unusual to take one of your sls as an anticipated subject , so that their load is lighter in the final year . 
  schools that allow these often plan ahead by teaching some of the curriculum for subjects that they offer anticipated during the year * before * starting ib . 
  word is that the game 's going to come with all the same basic content currently present in civ v with expansions , including religion and espionage !, 
  i doubt they 'll be able to tell us yet , but i 'm gon na ask all the same :, 
  / u/aspyr _ blair if , hypothetically , aspyr were doing civ vi , do you think it would be likely that they might give the os x version the same touch-screen interface that windows has ? 
  hypothetically speaking , of course . 
  respectfully , there is * no * better place to discuss any sort of inequality in professional classical music circles than in a forum dedicated to classical music .
