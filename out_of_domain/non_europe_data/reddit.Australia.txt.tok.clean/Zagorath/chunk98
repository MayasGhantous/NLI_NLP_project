  but still , if it has idina menzel as elphaba it ca n't be all that bad !, 
  i was n't even sure of that before i came to the comments . 
  coulda been the girl who was famous for all i knew . 
  even after reading here i have no idea who nick offerman or ron swanson are , really . 
  the dude 's an actor named nick offerman , who plays a character called ron swanson in some show . 
  the only relevant point you seem to make is :, 
   the dollar is at a historic high , it might not have been so high when the prices were calculated . 
  sure , that 's fine if our dollar was temporarily high , but it 's been this way for a very long time , and one would expect the prices would have been adjusted by now . 
  heck , even apple has brought its prices closer in line with the actual exchange rates in recent times , though it 's still not exactly equal to the current rate . 
  but going back to your original comment , yes , your comment was implying that . 
  you said :, 
   when comparing prices you must take into account both gst , the cost of conversion and the fact the dollar is at a historical high right now, 
  it may not have been intended , but when you mention that the `` dollar is at a historical high '' as a factor in comparing prices , when you know that the prices in aus are much higher than in the us , that * does * imply that the exchange rate is the cause of it . 
  perhaps you did n't mean that , but that 's how it came across , both to me and to / u/fistocracy, 
  ah , that 's a good way of using the term pc . 
  it bugs me to no end when people do use it as non-mac computer , but it 's just so common that that is my natural assumption without further context . 
  cheers to him for using it correctly , and to you for pointing that out . 
  but i still did n't miss the point . 
  my comment was talking about windows 8 on a pc , not a tablet . 
  i definitely got really confused about a lot of the middle . 
  the whole thing with that club that they went to or whatever . 
  i 've not seen the musical , though , so i ca n't comment on that specifically . 
  the longest single file in my itunes library is ** scheherazade ** by ** rimsky-korsakov ** ( at ** 45m36s ** ) , but that 's just because separate movements of what are in fact a single piece of music are separated into different files . 
  if you count ** tchaikovsky 's swan lake ** as a single piece , that 's over ** 2h45m ** , but it 's difficult to justify counting it . 
  ** dvorak 's legends ** is described as a `` cycle of pieces '' , but it clocks in at ** 1h22m ** if you allow that to count . 
  much easier to count would be ** sibelius 's kullervo ** , described as a `` symphonic poem '' , which clocks in at ** 1h20m ** . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's fair to count , as it basically is a single piece of music . 
  just in case that does n't count , the next one down would be ** beethoven symphony no. 9 ** at ** 1h02m ** . 
  i 'm surprised not to see more classical music in this thread , since there 's a tendency for them to be a lot longer . 
  the word you want is utmost . 
  question was * in your library * . 
  unless you have a version of organ ^ 2 / aslsp that is actually over 630 years long you did n't really answer the question . 
  question is what 's in * your library * . 
  [ i was surprised , too . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/124eas/rmusic_what_is_the_longest_song_you_have_in_your/c6s2n1h ), 
  what 's your longest classical piece that would be considered `` one piece '' ? 
  i 'd never heard that piece before , but i love it now !, 
  awesome solo . 
  edit : also , your username seems somewhat relevant to the original post . 
   zagorath mentioned some great pieces that are really worth listening to, 
  hi , you just replied to my comment and referred to me in the third person . 
  perhaps you were talking for in case any third party comes across this ( so that they 've got the convenient youtube links -- and thanks for those by the way ) , but it seemed to me more like you just made a comical mistake !, 
  [ here 's a version of sheherazade in a single video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooq9njdlxlw ) , played on period instruments . 
  ( but because it 's quite a late romantic piece , `` period '' instruments sound really similar to what we 're used to today . ), 
  really good quality recording imo . 
  my longest single file is scheherazade , but i also have a number of longer single pieces in separate movements . 
  i do n't know about its use as an ornament , but it 's a fairly accepted practice to not use vibrato , or to just use minimal vibrato , in baroque performances , even ones that are n't especially `` period accurate '' otherwise . 
  haha ok , no worries then . 
  daaamn . 
  how much hard drive space does that take up ? 
  i 'd say oratorio 's fair game . 
  to be honest opera and ballet probably should have counted in that category , too , but i thought it 'd be more interesting to exclude them just because they 're so long it means there 'll be more variation if we exclude them . 
  yeah definitely , a very interesting thought . 
  damn , that 's a thing ? 
  yep , definitely does trump everything else . 
  ( well , except perhaps `` organ ^ 2 / aslsp '' aka `` as slow as possible '' ), 
  whoa , why the hell did the guy decide to put such a nsfl picture on that . 
  absolutely inexplicable , like you said . 
  wow , really cool . 
  i never knew that about it . 
  have you got a source ? 
  sorry , but that 's definitely never been my experience . 
  automatic detectors could probably get the audio from that situation , if it was clear enough . 
  correct . 
  they 've supposedly altered it now so that of the copyright claim is disputed , it then has to go to a true dmca takedown , but i 'm yet to see it in action . 
  as someone with experience in the field could you explain the new changes to me ? 
  from what i gather the first , automatic , claim against the video works as before : you can take it down , put ads up , whatever . 
  after the uploaded disputes it , however , it would seem that their only recourse is a full dmca takedown , so they no longer have the option of putting ads on it . 
  by the way , there are some automatic detections that happen regularly that are , quite frankly , complete and utter bullshit and should have their foot prints removed . 
  every recording of myself playing classical ( public domain ) music has had a claim placed upon it by a `` music publishing rights society '' . 
  of course , after i disputed they were , in nearly every case , removed within a few hours . 
  just one of my videos had three of these claims on it ( the only one with more than a single claim ) , one of which was from an organisation called harry fox something . 
  the other two claims were , as usual , removed immediately , but this hfa has taken the full 30 days , and i 'm waiting for them to remove it some time today . 
  the weirdest thing is that not only is the idea of any claim against my own recording of public domain music fraudulent , but the description of what copyright they claim my recording violates is a completely different piece of music to the one i played . 
  if you submit a claim on the grounds of fair use that should get through , i think . 
  extra question , are you secretly a muslim ? 
  usually . 
  most of the copyright claims against my own performances of classical ( public domain ) music by `` music publishing rights societies '' have been removed within 6 hours of the dispute . 
  i 've got one where a fraudulent company known as the harry fox agency has taken the full 30 days they are allowed and still no action has been taken ( and if it 's not gone in the next 24 hours , to allow for time zones , i 'm going to be contacting them and youtube further ) . 
  it was a reference to the show homeland . 
  great ama , though . 
  honestly one of the most interesting i 've read in a while . 
  i 'm surprised not to hear more questions about the computer you designed . 
  what did it look like/do ? 
  yeah , i 've heard about that sort of thing happening a lot . 
  with classical music it seems somehow different , though . 
  every one of my videos has had a claim put on it , and i 've heard the same from a lot of other musicians , it seems to be institutionalised , not just random brazilian companies et cetera . 
  but i 'm still curious about what exactly the recent changes entail , i was n't sure if my interpretation is correct , and i have n't been able to find anything specific from google or youtube about it . 
  other than that , what do you personally think of the changes , are they a positive thing ? 
  do they make it easier for you to do you job , or have any effect at all ? 
  beethoven definitely was a big part , but even mozart did it sometimes . 
  for example , his [ 41st symphony ] ( http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/c/c5/imslp28061-pmlp01573-mozart_symphony_no.41_cello.pdf ) . 
  i 'd say mozart made the first tiny steps , with beethoven doing the rest of the work . 
  if you look at early beethoven , there 's a lot of doubling in symphonies [ 1 ] ( http://erato.uvt.nl/files/imglnks/usimg/e/eb/imslp26189-pmlp01582-beethoven_-_symphony_no1_in_c_major_op121__cello-part_a.pdf ) , [ 2 ] ( http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/d/d1/imslp26191-pmlp02580-beethoven_-_symphony_no2_in_d_major_op36__cello-part_a.pdf ) , [ 4 ] ( http://petrucci.mus.auth.gr/imglnks/usimg/3/32/imslp26215-pmlp01585-beethoven_-_symphony_no4_in_bb_major_op60__cello-part_a.pdf ) , and probably a lot of his others . 
  edit : that said , your point is a very good one , i was n't trying to undermine it , just add some further detail . 
  reddit loved soundandfury 's comment , i merely expanded upon it . 
  besides , op did n't mind the question at all . 
  christian grey is a character in 40 shades of grey . 
  an erotic novel . 
  do people seriously egg it if you do n't give them lollies ?
