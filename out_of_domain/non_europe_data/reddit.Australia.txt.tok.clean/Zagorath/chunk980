  a lot of my sheet music is in books , whether it be the large collections of dozens of mostly unrelated pieces , such as those that come with a new piano , or the smaller collections of pieces like my old abrsm set piece books , or old bound copies from musicals i 've played in . 
  only have a dozen or so pieces that are printed out on their own . 
  imagine a norse berserker type character . 
  that 's what i imagine when i think barbarian with shield . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/9085922_f520.jpg ) or possibly [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ek3wxfq.jpg ) . 
   stars , which are * dozens upon dozens * of miles away, 
  understatement of the century right here . 
  how about ( over | under ) whelmed or ( dis ) aster ? 
  false positive, 
  there 's a tie-in comic that 's set in between the two seasons , i believe . 
  is the game any good ? 
  oh this is really cool . 
  can we make this a regular thing ? 
  op commented after you that the otter is apparently over 1.5 m. 
  i 'm whelmed by this news . 
  that * is * a fun fact !, 
  it sort of depends on the build you 're going for , i 'd think . 
  if you want to be someone that can take as much of a beating as possible , high ac ( via con and dex ) plus high hp would be really desirable . 
  but , of course , you 'd be sacrificing damage to do it , and so i doubt most barbarians would want to go that route .

  hey sorry , but this post is against submission rule 1 :, 
   the content has to be complete in terms of material presented . 
  it does n't have to be perfect or balanced but it does have to be fleshed out .

   this would eliminate the donkey vote effect , as it would be roughly equal for every candidate, 
  i can see why you would want this , but it could have the adverse effect of making it much , much harder for an informed voter to actually go about their vote . 
  when you 've got a metre wide ballot paper , the easiest way to vote is to figure out your preferences ahead of time on one of those sites that generates it for you , print out the result of that , and use that to number . 
  overall , i 'd probably say it 's worth it anyway , but it 's important to be aware of the potential downsides . 
   for senate ballot papers , this should be done not only for the parties , but the individual senate candidates within each party . 
  please , if you 've got a good reason for this , do explain , but it sounds to me like a terrible idea . 
  people very rarely vote for a specific person : they vote for parties , and so the party should be able to provide its suggestion for the order in which its members will be elected . 
  as long as the voter has the clear option to preference them in a different order . 
  i voted [ 1 ] for you guys at the last election , and i probably will this time , too . 
  i compiled a list of my favourite ( and least favourite ) pp policies at the last election so that i could provide them to others who expressed interest . 
  i 'll share it here in case anyone is interested . 
  ( edit : voted [ 1 ] below the line , because at least in queensland tpp had some really shifty business going on with their gvt last time around . 
  not that that 'll be an issue anymore . ), 
  / u/aldonius , could you let me know if any of these have changed since the last election ? 
  i have n't yet had the chance to go over the current party policies . 
  ## education :, 
  teach religion in the context of history and literature , not as religious indoctrination . 
  more academic control over course and research funding , course design , and hiring, 
  make government-funded research available to the public ( without a paywall ), 
  reduce hecs fees by 25 %, 
  ## patents and copyright :, 
  reduce patent terms to 5 years, 
  increase cost of obtaining software patents and remove function-based software patents ( patents on the end result of the software ) . 
  require the patent to be in use in order to litigate on it, 
  further `` fair use '' exceptions to copyright, 
  ## internet :, 
  oppose censorship, 
  fund law enforcement to remove illegal content and prosecute its producers , rather than filter the users ' internet, 
  support fibre to the premises nbn, 
  ## bill of rights :, 
  create an australian bill of rights to protect basic human rights and freedoms in australia . 
  include :, 
  * right to end your own life should you explicitly and when in your right-mind choose to do so . 
  * freedom of speech and communication to express your beliefs, 
  * * does not include right to be heard ( such as forcing people to listen to you ), 
  * * no right to not be offended by free expression of others, 
  * * freedom of speech excludes : direct threats , intentional false statements ( such as false advertising ) , and direct attempts to incite the use of force against another person, 
  * right to not incriminate yourself ( right to remain silent ), 
  * privacy for your home , no illegal search and seizure without warrant, 
  ## tax :, 
  tax-free threshold for micro-businesses, 
  increase tax-free income threshold to the level of the poverty line, 
  close loopholes for high earners, 
  remove religious exemptions ( `` supernatural beliefs should be irrelevant for taxpayers in a secular society '' ), 
  ## drugs :, 
  legalise non-addictive substances with reversible impacts , including marijuana . 
  tax legal drugs and regulate their sale . 
  partially decriminalise all other drugs, 
  * small supplies for personal use would result in confiscation of the drug and potentially imposed treatment , but no criminal charges, 
  * larger supplies for commercial sale would result in prosecution, 
  # cons :, 
  ## marriage :, 
  they support removing the government from marriages altogether , replacing the marriage act with a civil unions act which would offer equal treatment to same-sex couples . 
  i think this is a massive improvement on the status-quo of marriage being heterosexual only , but is a step down from other parties which support amending the marriage act to include same-sex marriage . 
  it has all the same benefits in terms of equality , but removing marriage like that just does n't feel right to me . 
  ( i know some people see this as the best option , it 's just not an opinion i share . ), 
  ## environment :, 
  their policies seem extremely convoluted and far too lofty to me . 
  incredibly inefficient . 
  violence ? 
  i 'll grant you illegality and theft , but it 's fairly clear that they 're referencing digital piracy , not the sort on ships . 
  their primary goal in terms of policies relates to intellectual property law , after all . 
  i 'm curious , who got [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ? 
  you should go look for a libertarian party then . 
  their `` gubment should not do shit '' point of view sounds right up your alley . 
  i ca n't remember the exact nature of it , but i remember looking over it and thinking it weird that despite agreeing nearly exactly with everything tpp themselves were doing , the parties they were preferencing most highly did not match nearly as well . 
  i think there were some quite moderate or possibly even rightish parties preferenced ahead of the greens or labor . 
  i vaguely remember there being something weird with that democratic party that tried to make a resurgence . 
  / r/findthesniper ? 
  peeta could learn a thing or two from that . 
  libertarian-left basically just means a more extreme version of what we typically think of as `` the left '' . 
  what you generally think of as `` libertarian '' would be more properly described as libertarian-right .
