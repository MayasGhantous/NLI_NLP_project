  what you generally think of as `` libertarian '' would be more properly described as libertarian-right . 
  [ you can go here to read more , if you 're interested . 
  ] ( http://politicalcompass.org/ ), 
  i would just caution you to temper your trust in the wisdom of the crowd . 
  it can be a very powerful tool in some instances , [ but it certainly is not always ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d68mch2vecu ) . 
  in addition to what / u/marcsharma said , you may find it useful to ask in [ the latest arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4ijgmt/the _ arcana_forge / ) . 
  how familiar are you with the comic series that also takes place between seasons ? 
  do the two media work in concert to tell one greater story , both tell unrelated stories over that time period , or both tell exactly the same story ? 
  what was your role in the development of the game ? 
  i feel it would be a lot easier for people to ask interesting questions if we had some idea of what aspect ( s ) of the game you were involved in making . 
  its problem is n't going on too long , it 's that the writers decided to take it in a stupid direction listening to tumblr . 
  it was * always * planned to have a 5 season arc . 
  really ? 
  because i think it 's pretty much as good as ever . 
  last season and maybe the one before that were a little weaker , but this season has been right back up with the best . 
  well , think about it , 8 months for a four year old is 1/6 of their whole life . 
  they 'll have grown up a lot in that time , and especially if they 've spent it with unfamiliar people , they 'll have changed substantially . 
  now you come along , desperate to find your lost kid . 
  you see this kid , around the same age as yours . 
  he acts a bit different , but that makes sense : he 's been gone a very long time in his lifespan , and he 's probably a bit shaken up . 
  it 's super easy for someone to rationalise to themselves anything that means they 've found their lost baby . 
  this might interest you . 
  it 's a comment from one of the tng writers/producers , though i 'm not sure what his role was in this particular episode ( he was n't the main writer for it ) . 
   i 've always felt that the experience in `` inner light '' would 've been the most profound experience in picard 's life and changed him irrevocably . 
  however , that was n't our intention when we were creating the episode . 
  we were after a good hour of tv , and the larger implications of how this would really screw somebody up did n't hit home with us until later ( that 's sometimes a danger in tv -- you 're so focused on just getting the show produced every week that sometimes you suffer from the `` ca n't see the forest for the trees '' syndrome ) . 
  we never intended the show to completely upend his character and force a radical change in the series , so we contented ourselves with a single follow-up in `` lessons '' [ s06e19 ] . 
  there 's also [ this comic ] ( http://journeytotheinnerlight.com/outerlight/page1.php ) , which is written by the same writer that * did * write * the inner light * , which supposedly acts as a direct sequel to it . 
  i ca n't speak to its quality though , as i 've just now watched * the inner light * for the first time , and have n't had time to read anything else yet . 
  it 's a * 90 % * confidence interval that the `` rate and extent of absorption '' is within 20 % of the brand name . 
  a 20 % confidence interval would not be worth very much at all . 
  source : the current top comment . 
  i honestly know nothing about america 's laws regarding medicine . 
  for what it 's worth , in the time since i posted that , i 've read it . 
  it 's rather short , actually . 
  to be honest , i think at best i can say it was * okay * . 
  not terrible , but i do n't really feel like it had the emotional effect the episode itself did , not even close . 
  i noticed that , but i 'm still failing to see what the humour is here ? 
  op 's seem to explode if the damage rolled is the maximum amount . 
  that is , if you were using a longsword one handed , if you rolled 8 on the d8 , you get to roll again ( and again , and again , until you do n't roll 8 ) . 
   2d6 quickly is going to outpace 1d12 with this build and rule, 
  could you explain ? 
  2d6 is still going to suffer far more than 1d12 , i 'd have thought , regardless of class features or feats . 
  the odds of rolling max damage are 1/36 off the bat , and i have n't got the odds on it , but i 'd be surprised if it 's better than 1/12 even with gwf . 
  unless you 're assuming he treats 2d6 as two separate attacks worth 1d6 each , which each die potentially exploding separately ? 
  i 'll echo someone from the previous thread . 
  what do we do outside those regions ? 
  that guy was sea , i believe , and i 'm in aus . 
  i was under the impression that is a fielder touches the base with their foot while in possession of the ball , the base is now dead and anyone who 's running to it is automatically out . 
  i 'm assuming from your comment that this was completely wrong , but i do n't suppose you 'd have any idea what * actual * rule might have given me that impression ? 
  i 've had it on click to play for quite a while now , and i 've never noticed to be g a problem on youtube or facebook . 
  ca n't speak for the others , since i never/rarely visit them . 
  there 's also no way that petyr baelish is anything other than chaotic . 
  how many times has he talked * directly * about chaos or unpredictability ? 
  if it 's your first time there , i 'd highly suggest checking out [ dndgreentext 's hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) , which has a bunch of the best stories that have been shared there . 
  ah interesting , thanks for the explanation !, 
  i did n't know that little detail . 
  can you trap someone running from , say , first base to second by getting the ball to first and then to second , without needing to wait to actually tap them ? 
  or does that still fall under them having an `` other base to turn back to '' ? 
  the ones that personally mean the most to me are pretty much revenue neutral . 
  that is , the ip stuff , opposition to internet censorship , and the bill of rights . 
  the drugs thing is not something that ranks high on my `` care '' meter , but it 's most likely a small revenue positive policy . 
  sorry , perhaps i should have been a little clearer . 
  in my hypothetical scenario , the * only * runner is going from first to second base . 
  you ca n't throw to second base first , because he 'll turn around and go back to first ( and in this hypothetical , we want to get him out ) . 
  my question is , if you throw to first base * first * , and then second , does that count as fulfilling the requirement that you can only get them out by stepping on the plate if they have nowhere to run back to , or could he , once you 've thrown to second base , then run safely back to first ?

   the game gets much more complicated as you delve into the details, 
  haha no worries . 
  your first paragraph was clear enough to me . 
  and i know what you mean about things getting complicated when you go into details . 
  my preferred bat and ball sport has rules that can be * mostly * summarised [ like this ] ( http://media.wiley.com/lux/46/174546.image0.jpg ) . 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure youtube uses html5 by default on most videos , most of the time , these days . 
  which makes me wonder , why grant them an exception that they do n't need ? 
  and a haircut . 
  i agree completely . 
  i hate when writers/directors/producers outright lie to fans/the public . 
  it 's not cool , it 's not clever , it 's disrespectful . 
  be vague , do n't tell the whole truth , or even deliberately misdirect , but do n't outright tell falsehoods . 
  it was n't cool when abrams did it with his second star trek movie , and it 's not cool here . 
  yes , that second scenario explains it perfectly . 
  thanks !, 
  are there supposed to be two lord manderlys of white harbour ? 
  one in the barrowlands ? 
  same goes for lord reed of greywater watch and old flint of moat cailin ( which are both green , for some reason ? ) . 
  also it seems oldtown is the seat of the senior lord of the reach , rather than highgarden . 
  i have no idea what 's going on in the crownlands . 
  king-elect targaryen ? 
  lord drake of dragonstone ? 
  please . 
  ramsay snow is every bit as much a bastard as jon . 
  being legitimised by a false king is no true legitimisation . 
  hahaha that was brilliant . 
  thanks for the explanation , it was really helpful .
