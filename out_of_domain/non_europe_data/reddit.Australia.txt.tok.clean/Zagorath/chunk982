  to any newcomers , i would highly encourage you to check out [ our hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) to see some of the greatest stories of all time . 
  sorting the subreddit by [ top of all time ] ( / r/dndgreentext/top / ? sort = top & t = all ) will also get you good results . 
  we do n't require stories be about d&d , but they do have to be tabletop roleplaying based . 
  we also do n't require that they be greentext . 
  though if you want to format your submissions as greentext , make sure to prefix the lines with ''  '' . 
  you can see some more advanced formatting options we have available here [ in our manual of style ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / style ) . 
  to anyone discovering / r/dndgreentext for the first time , i would highly encourage you to check out [ their hall of fame ] ( / r/dndgreentext/wiki / hof ) to see some of the greatest stories of all time . 
  sorting the subreddit by [ top of all time ] ( / r/dndgreentext/top / ? sort = top & t = all ) will also get you good results . 
  the ones in the hall of fame listed as `` long '' vary from a few minutes to read to many hours . 
  the really long ones , like demigods and stranded , are * totally * worth it though , even if you 're not particularly interested in roleplaying . 
  it 's probably best to read them a little bit at a time though , over the course of a few days . 
  / r/worldbuilding is also a fantastic subreddit !, 
  i love that these two are trending on the same day !, 
  i do n't know , for sure . 
  my best guess is * maybe * from [ this thread ] ( / r/askreddit/comments / 4jcwaq/dungeon _ masters_of_reddit_whats_the_funniest / ) , which is what i think is the reason for / r/dndgreentext also trending today , but while that 's a thread that makes a lot of sense as the reason for dndgreentext trending , it also being the reason for here trending is a lot less clear ... 
   apple just put it on every apple device, 
  that , by definition , means it is not a third party solution . 
  parties 1 and 2 are the manufacturer and the end user . 
  on an apple device , nothing developed by apple is third party . 
  it is ? 
  most people i know use facebook messenger . 
  i tend to only use sms as a backup in the rare circumstances i ca n't reach someone with fb . 
  but certainly yeah , whatsapp , viber , and line ( i 've never even * heard * of those latter two ) are not popular . 
  personally i liked it from the beginning , but i * do * also see why some people found it got better after a point . 
  the biggest thing was a lessening in how much they were referencing superman , doing the feminism thing in a less in-your-face way , and embracing the wider comic book mythology a bit more , in my opinion . 
  it 's all fairly subtle imo , but it is there . 
  languages that you can communicate in and that you 're fluent in are n't always the same thing . 
  roughly speaking , a group 2 score of 7 at sl is probably enough to be able to say you can communicate in the language , but to be fluent would be more like a 7 at hl , or taking it as a group 1 subject . 
  but these creators ( or at least a substantial subset of them ) need a * customer base * that can make use of what they 're providing . 
  if the average home is unable to reliably stream hd content , it does n't matter what technology i develop that makes use of this , i 'll never have any customers . 
  we really do need both up and down to be good . 
  obviously it 's the up that needs the * most * improving compared to the current situation , but both are needed to bring us properly into the digital economy . 
  yeah , the shading on this * really * threw me off . 
  i was wondering how it could possibly be so perfect . 
  legally speaking , he definitely is . 
  and i 'm not familiar with all the intricacies of r+l = j , but i was not under the impression that it * necessarily * involved a marriage in the eyes of the gods . 
  / r/dataisbeautiful , to provide a link for the lazy ( yours has a typo ) . 
  but thanks , that makes a lot more sense . 
  i do n't suppose you 'd have a link to the actual thread , though ? 
  i ca n't find anything in there about alternate maps of america . 
  hahaha that was brilliant !, 
  also really interesting was watching that super angry coach yelling at the umpires , and them just staring him down . 
  dude needs a serious chill pill !, 
  [ it has been posted before ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 2dsor5/the _ wizard_who_destroyed_all_psions / ) . 
  [ it 's also , sorta , been posted a second time before ] ( / r/dndgreentext/comments / 3op5ur/looking _ for_a_text / ) . 
  not 100 % sure , but probably [ this one ] ( / r/askreddit/comments / 4jcwaq/dungeon _ masters_of_reddit_whats_the_funniest / ) . 
  were were mentioned thrice in that thread , [ here ] ( / r/askreddit/comments / 4jcwaq/dungeon _ masters_of_reddit_whats_the_funniest / d36tehv?context = 3 ) , [ here ] ( / r/askreddit/comments / 4jcwaq/dungeon _ masters_of_reddit_whats_the_funniest / d361gor?context = 3 ) , and [ here ] ( / r/askreddit/comments / 4jcwaq/dungeon _ masters_of_reddit_whats_the_funniest / d35t67l?context = 3 ) . 
  the thing i do n't get is that none of the mentions were particularly high in the thread , so it 's a bit surprising that they 'd be sufficient to push us into trending status . 
  would n't it be easier , if what you 're trying to grab is a podcast , to use a podcatcher ? 
  preferably to download just an audio version , but if they do n't offer one , grabbing the video version and using a podcatcher that can disable the video ( i know pocket casts has this feature , and i suspect others do , too ) and just play the audio . 
  it 's not exactly an answer to your question , but since what you 're after is podcasts specifically , this sounds like [ an xy problem ] ( http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem ) . 
  no , the keyboard creator was american . 
  his name almost certainly has as its root the name of the czech composer , but in moving to the us , the pronunciation changed . 
   for those learning korean , yes , you can just type out the words in roman letters and your software should automatically convert it into hangul, 
  as someone who can * read * korean , but not speak/understand it , this sounds * awful * to me . 
  i 've always found the romanisation of korean to be * extremely * unintuitive compared to the simple elegant beauty that is hangul . 
  wait john c dvorak is actually * related * to the guy that created the dsk how did i not know this, 
  the primary thing that sets / r/dndgreentext apart from / r/gametales is not the greentext format ( really , * any * format is more than welcome ) , it 's the subject matter . 
  stories * must * be about tabletop roleplaying games , rather than computer games or other sorts . 
  so , off topic , but `` alumni '' is already plural . 
  no need to add an `` s '' . 
  the singular is `` alumnus '' ( or `` alumna '' , if you choose to use it in a gendered way , and are referring specifically to a woman ) . 
  i do n't know if this is what op is going for , but [ this piece ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofcxrbvpxf4 ) has some great percussion writing ( along with some god-awful difficult rhythms for the wind and brass ) . 
  my one suggestion to make something like this useful : add weighting . 
  both in the database , a weighting in how heavily something features ( phandelver might be heavy on goblins , medium on undead , light on orcs , for example ) , but also from the user 's end ( maybe it 's important for me to have an adventure with goblins , and i 'd * like * gnolls , but it 's not very important , but it 's * essential * that it be set in a forest ) . 
  a tool like this , without some sort of fuzzy logic , is likely to be of much , * much * less use than if it * does * have that ability . 
  for user editing , emulating a wiki 's style where anyone can edit , discuss ( on talk pages ) , revert , have dispute resolution processes that work in the same way , etc. , would be very useful . 
  obviously it ca n't be as simple as running an instance of mediawiki , since it needs a fundamentally different database structure to a standard wiki . 
  it really does depend on the university , and most notably , how software engineering relates to other engineering fields . 
  at my university , for example , the same first-year maths courses are required ( linear algebra & calculus i , and multivariate calculus ) as for electrical , mechanical , civil , etc. 
  engineers . 
  so yes , hl maths was most definitely required . 
  but other universities may treat softeng separately from other engineering disciplines , and so it may not be as necessary . 
  in the general sense , though , i would say that yes , if you want to go into softeng , you should keep up hl maths . 
  especially if you can get to do either statistics or discrete maths as your option topic . 
  hey , sorry , but i have removed this submission because it does n't pass post requirement 1 :, 
   the content has to be complete in terms of material presented . 
  it does n't have to be perfect or balanced but it does have to be fleshed out . 
  to get help coming up with homebrew content based on a vague idea , try submitting in [ the latest arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4ijgmt/the _ arcana_forge / ) . 
  a vote like this should * really * not be using fptp . 
  ( well , actually , no vote ** ever ** should use fptp . ), 
  alternative vote ( aka av , instant runoff voting , or irv ) or possibly approval voting would be far , far more useful . 
  agreed . 
  anyone who is going to pirate is going to do it anyway . 
  there 's absolutely no reason to link to it . 
  easy enough to do . 
  just parse the input when it 's given , and block out any well-known torrent sites . 
  if people get around that , legally it 's * not * a legal liability -- because of safe harbour provisions -- but they should be taken down as quickly as possible anyway , and repeat offenders should be banned ( by ip address and/or username/email address ) . 
  do you know any programming languages ? 
  because really , once you know one , it 's not hard to pick up any sane language . 
  ( `` sane '' , here , means not one of those stupid things like brainfuck , or a language designed specifically for code golfing . ), 
  if you know any of the c-derived languages ( c , c++ , c # , and even java , javascript , or php ) , it 's * especially * easy to make the conversion . 
  it 's just a matter of learning the slightly different syntax at first , and picking up on smaller details as you go along . 
   this is just a way of vaguely gauging, 
  those words suggest that the * perfect * solution here would have been approval voting . 
  it 's basically fptp , but instead of each person voting for one thing , they can vote for * all * the things they `` approve '' of . 
  for example , maybe someone 's favourite answer is python , but they also like php or ror . 
  so they select all three of those . 
  it can help prevent the case where the answer which is nearly everyone 's * second * favourite option loses , because it 's not very popular as a first choice ( i highly suspect php might take that role in this case , if python does n't -- especially if you note that python , while very popular , is * not * a majority ) .
