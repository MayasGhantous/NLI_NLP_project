  this, 
  * [ john williams ' dracula ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iabqpy6oizq ) , the soundtrack to the 1979 film . 
  the film itself was unmemorable , but the music is fantastic -- because who would expect anything else from the maestro ? 
  -- and has become the golden standard by which any film version of dracula is rated . 
  the most famous film version , 1992 's `` bram stoker 's dracula '' features a score by wojciech kilar that `` shares more than a little in common with '' williams ' version , at least according to one review i found ( i have to admit , i do n't actually remember that film 's score ) . 
  yeah , that does seem normal . 
  but then , we 've certainly been led to believe that the ironborn stand on ceremony far less than elsewhere in westeros ( and indeed the world ) , so it would n't be * super * surprising that they 'd have fewer people present at an event like this . 
  canonically , at least in the realms , being a warlock does n't generally impose any particular quirks . 
  note , i 'm most familiar with warlocks with devil patrons , and things might be different for demons , and even more so for fey or great old one warlocks . 
  the warlock 's patron gives them access to power , and might try to manipulate them ( or `` corrupt '' them ) into becoming a more evil person over all , but the magic itself does n't necessarily warp them . 
  the cost may be any number of things , but will generally * not * be selling their soul . 
  in a world where souls are a very real thing , people are not so willing to just give up their souls . 
  instead , they might agree to perform favours for their patron . 
  if they 're a good bargainer , familiar with how devils think , they might attempt to put in specific clauses about what they can not be asked to do by their patron ( and it 's up to their patron at the time of forming the pact whether they accept or not ) . 
  note here that devils * do not lie * . 
  think of how a wish from a genie might go wrong if not worded precisely , and devils are much the same : they will look for every possible loophole or technicality to allow them to get their way , but they will not do something they said they will not , and they will do what they say they will . 
  frequently , the * forfeit * will be the warlock 's soul . 
  that is , if the warlock fails to fulfil its part of the pact , * then * the patron will get their soul . 
  also note that a devil might make a pact of a non-warlock nature . 
  a deal for a one-time help with something in exchange for something else . 
  a particularly malicious devil may even engineer the situation that their target wants to avoid in order to force them into making a deal . 
  but that 's a little off topic . 
  in some cases , especially among devil patrons , they might be willing to form a pact for very little in return , if the person they 're forming the pact with is important in some way . 
  some devils `` collect '' warlocks , aiming to get a complete set . 
  for example , in the realms , they might want to get a [ `` toril thirteen '' ] ( http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/toril_thirteen ) ( thirteen tieflings descended from each of the 13 tieflings to have made a pact with asmodeus back around the time of his ascension ) . 
  if a mortal fulfils a criteria to complete a set , the patron may be willing to take them on for no direct cost . 
  but this can have roleplay implications as well , since if they 're valuable , other potential patrons may come after them . 
  all that said , personally , when i played my warlock , i * did * like to play it off as though gradually , as i took levels in it , i was becoming more and more corrupted directly by the energy itself . 
  started off young and innocent , and gradually became more and more evil , until eventually i was willing to slaughter an entire village of satyrs because three of them led our party into an ambush from some other monsters that apparently were preying on the satyrs . 
   i 'm still not sure if they named them after the number of wheels, 
  well it clearly ca n't be that , since the name makes no sense if so . 
  why would you keep the `` bi '' part of `` bicycle/motorbike '' on a thing that 's got four wheels ? 
  yes i understood that that 's what the person i replied to was going for . 
  i was just making a humorous observation . 
  hear fucking hear !, 
  did you just ... photoshop the `` bitch '' in ? 
  [ here 's a more convincing looking version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b6hmnbw.png ) . 
  is that an actual line from an episode ? 
  because it * really * sounds like it could be . 
  gods damn it bran , why you always got ta go fuck shit up ? 
  yeah true . 
  skyrim does n't really start to open up until about an hour in , but 15 minutes in to my first do n't starve together game i already knew i was hooked . 
  i liked him because he gave an excellent performance as a sort of proto-joker . 
  i thought he did an amazing job of playing a character that 's utterly mad , the writing he was given was sublime , and his scenes were shot perfectly . 
  it just could not have been done better . 
  but unlike the majority of people on here , i do ** not ** want to see him come back . 
  he did an amazing job of planting the seeds of madness for something that can eventually lead to the joker appearing . 
  but unlike many of the other batman villains , the joker is so critically tied to the bat himself . 
  to have jerome come back would be a disservice to his excellent death the first time around , and would be even worse for the greater batman mythos this show is setting up . 
  the show gave us a delicious taste of the batman 's greatest nemesis , but they never gave us the joker proper , and that 's how it should stay , because to do otherwise undermines what the joker is . 
  and more importantly , to bring back jerome in this show , even if you 're happy to eschew the entire history of batman lore , would cheapen jerome as a character , since he so beautifully set things up for the future * because * of his death . 
  jerome died as a martyr for his `` cause '' , and that says so much more than him coming back ever could . 
  yeah hey sorry , but i 've removed this . 
  this subreddit is for sharing stories about your game , or that you found elsewhere . 
  if you want to ask questions about the game , / r/dnd or / r/dndnext are the best places to go . 
  if you 've got questions about roll20 , / r/roll20 might be a good place to go . 
  awesome idea . 
  implemented . 
  nah , i just edited the source in my browser . 
  did n't actually edit the page itself . 
  that 's ... not how proofs work . 
   off-topic , would it be more correct to say ` an r/australia thread ' ? 
  is it convention that the ` r ' is pronounced , or is it ignored ? 
  this is a topic of much debate on reddit , along with things like the pronunciation of gif ( hint : both hard and soft g are correct ) and imgur . 
  personally , i would read it as `` are australia '' , but some people say `` slash are slash australia '' , or `` are slash australia '' . 
  the thread itself was great , but what i think is beautiful is the way this subreddit has taken it and ran with it . 
  just a few times it 's been referenced that i could find quickly in google :,

  i almost think it a shame that he never got around to actually building the thing , just so we could have some photos or something on here . 
  or maybe an update `` so , i got arrested for building a ballista in my backyard ... '', 
  sounds more like something out of a film , or composed specifically to be a generic background music over dramatic speeches , rather than a piece of classical music . 
  what 's wrong with the english of the dev that wrote this tool ? 
  all it 's doing is parsing `` xlist '' and spitting out a comment that says `` list of xs '' . 
  it 's not very * useful * , but there 's nothing wrong with their english . 
  i did n't even need to click the to know what it would be . 
  ( though admittedly , i was expecting a tin whistle rather than full western orchestra . ), 
  i ca n't believe i had to go this far down to see the inner light mentioned . 
  that episode had me in tears at the end . 
  i do n't think any other episode of trek has moved me as much as that did . 
  i just hunk it a shame that the episodic nature of the show meant they could n't get the chance to explore the longer term consequences of the events of that episode on picard 's psyche . 
  now we know the real reason the enterprise carries so many civilians . 
  odd , i 've always heard that line ( or one similar to it ) attributed to sir patrick . 
  he regularly explains the joke just like this , usually after someone else points out that it was a joke . 
  i 've got ta be honest , i 've never been quite so tempted to remove a post before than with this one , and even more so now that it 's getting quite heavily upvoted . 
  it was at 0 when i first found it , and i honestly thought the community we had would be better than to have upvoted it , and yet it sits at around 60 % upvotes ... 
  lol at the thought of the legends repairing anything in any timeline . 
  those fuckers are worse than barry is at not fucking shit up . 
  yeah a 4 episode crossover would be over 2 hours 40 minutes : * longer * than the animated movie by almost double . 
  even with each episode needing some wind up before it gets into things , it 's enough to potentially cover as much ground as the film did . 
  they already erased a huge amount of stuff from the episode this season when barry went back in time and they made sound guy turn good . 
  i feel like this is a reference to something , but i 'll ask anyway : what does nintendo have to do with anything ? 
  what i want to know is : how does the flashpoint paradox relate to the justice league episode titled `` flashpoint '' . 
  i 've spent hours googling for the answer , and yet somehow it seems like nobody on the entire internet has ever pointed out the similarity in name before , or at least not anywhere that google could find . 
  * i just want to know why they have the same name when they apparently have nothing in common dammit google !, 
  yeah , that 's the official story , but now we know the * real * reason . 
  * after ? 
  mate , [ this ] ( / r/flashtv/comments / 4ktwnf/when _ you_realize_its_the_finale / ) was posted hours * before * the finale aired .
