  the wiki is technically completely publicly visible ( with editing restricted to approved accounts ) , but in practice it 's private since i have n't given the link out anywhere . 
  but there are free hosted wikis available , [ this page may be a place to start ] ( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/starting_and_running_a_wiki_website/hosted_wikis ) if you 're interested . 
  i 'd recommend ctrl/cmd-fing `` mediawiki '' , since that 's the software that runs wikipedia et al , so you 're probably fairly familiar with how to use it already . 
  from my quick look , wiki-site . com or wiki.yt look to be the best options . 
  i ca n't personally vouch for any of them , though . 
  [ this page ] ( https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/hosting_services ) has a few more ( quite possibly better options ) . 
  wiki.wiki , shoutwiki , and miraheze look like the best ones there . 
  i 'm trying to sort of emulate the style of the forgotten realms wikia ( with , for obvious reasons , far , * far * less content ) . 
  the thing i like most about it is the ability to write about a heap of different topics , and easily interlink between pages to show related things . 
  for example , there 's an overall `` gods '' page that briefly describes each of the gods , and each of those link to the more detailed pages about those gods . 
  makes it much easier to ramble on about a given topic , and still have it be easy to make use of what you create in a useful fashion . 
  and they would be correct . 
  ( the people who say it with a hard g are * also * correct . ), 
  i grew up with three button mouses , and that 's still how i use it . 
  i just move my index finger across to scroll or middle click . 
  i do n't know the show , but i find it * very * hard to believe that 's * not * a nod to chuck . 
  `` aces '' is far from a common word in that context , and they 're referring to a character that 's not named chuck as `` chuck '' immediately beforehand . 
  no way that 's coincidence . 
  show writers are fans of other shows just as often as you or i. 
  i 'm not german , so i ca n't help * too * much . 
  however , i will say that since you 're on os x , you 're in a pretty good position if you want to stick to the official included layouts . 
  dvorak - ( cmd ) qwerty is unfortunately only available , as far as i know , with the us qwerty . 
  but os x makes it pretty easy to use umlauts and \u00df and other things you 'd need in german . 
  \u00df is just option-s , an umlaut is either option-u or i , i ca n't remember which , followed by the vowel you want it to go over . 
  other accents can be reached in similar ways , the circumflex is above i or u , the acute is above e , and the grave is the tilde . 
  the euro is option-shift-2 . 
  option backslash and option shift backslash give you double guillemets , option 3 and 4 are single guillemets . 
  option-w and [ seem to give you the opening and closing quotation marks german uses . 
  some of these are pretty intuitive to use , and some might take a bit of getting used to , and even then be less convenient than the official layouts . 
  so it might be necessary to come up with a variant layout rather than using the included one . 
  but it 's worth at least looking into . 
  yes i did , though it was after i left this comment . 
  it made no noticeable change . 
  basically , they put me half way between labor and greens , but i know from my own following of issues that i am * far * more of a greens voter . 
  my suspicion is that it 's because on some questions where i did n't have a * strong * opinion , i clicked option 2 or 4 rather than 1 or 5 , to sort of simulate the answer weighting during the question phase , rather than waiting to the end to do it , which skewed the results . 
  that , plus the fact that my opinion on specific wording of some questions does n't line up with my opinion on the general broader issue , so while i disagree/agree with one party or the other on that * specific * issue , in the broader philosophical sense that match does n't work as well . 
  because it 's a terrible idea . 
  a single feat that gives a * huge * buff to your whole class progression ? 
  gods no . 
  reddit 's new search is actually pretty damn powerful . 
  [ you can tell it to look for posts without specific flairs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?q=not+%28flair%3asubclass+or+flair%3aclass%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all ) . 
  [ or you can tell it to only show posts * with * specific flairs ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unearthedarcana/search?q=flair%3aitem+or+flair%3amonster+or+flair%3afeat&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all ) . 
  all in plain english language , more or less . 
   field bandages, 
  or athelas ? 
   hunter 's mark is the perfect example . 
  that should be a class feature, 
  hear , hear !, 
  i 've been saying this for ages . 
  hunter 's mark should be like divine smite . 
  have it be a class feature that uses spell slots , but have variations on it that are actual spells . 
  like maybe one that lets you mark a few different opponents at once but only grants 1d4 extra damage , or one that does n't do damage at all , but gives them disadvantage against anyone other than you ( and/or gives you advantage against them ) . 
  all of these would require concentration and be moveable to other targets once the first dies , just like the current hunter 's mark spell is . 
  you get second level spell slots 2 levels earlier . 
  3rd level 4 levels earlier . 
  4th level 6 levels earlier , and it gets 5th levels slots when it should n't ever get them . 
  that 's a massive buff . 
  way too much for the cost of a single feat . 
  any fighter is going to get at least 2 asis that are useful ( 17 being the most you can start with , using point buy ) . 
  on top of that , some feats that either all or a large number of eks could benefit from :, 
  * alert, 
  * charger, 
  * heavy armour master, 
  * great weapon master, 
  * lucky, 
  * mage slayer, 
  * martial adept, 
  * mobile, 
  * savage attacker, 
  * sentinel, 
  * shield master, 
  * tough, 
  of these , really only polearm master , great weapon master , and shield master are highly specific to certain types of characters . 
  the point is , there 's a * lot * of use any player can get out of their extra feats . 
  add to that the extra attacks , action surge , and things like the weapon bond and the disadvantage against spells , and the ek is already a very viable option . 
  it does n't need this buff . 
   there has never beeen as good a time to start reading dc than right now, 
  i feel like people were saying that when new 52 started , as well ... and probably also at whatever the last reboot before then was . 
  i dunno , i do n't read comics ( largely * because * of all the rebooting and related convolutions that are so prevalent ) , i 'm just a fan of comic characters in tv and film . 
  i 'm afraid i know absolutely nothing about type 2 , so i ca n't comment . 
  you can see all of the option-key shortcuts if you go to the keyboard layout option in your menu bar , and then press `` show keyboard viewer '' . 
  then , when you 're holding option or option-shift , it 'll show you what symbols are where . 
  can a phone even display raw images ? 
  you could have the best of both worlds and go to australia . 
  we 've been adopting paywave/paypass faster than europe , * and * everything fucked up about our politics is our own fault and not that of an overly bureaucratic third party . 
   lady : `` your machine is broken '', 
   me : `` sorry , no it is n't , you have to insert the chip for credit cards '', 
  i dunno , that story makes it sound an awful lot like the machine * was * broken . 
  if it makes it look like paywave/paypass works , but trying it causes an error , that 's clearly a broken machine . 
  sure , once you told her it does n't work , a sensible customer would have gotten the hint , but you going around saying it 's * not * broken when it was certainly did n't help ... 
  yeah , this really does n't sound like entirely the customer 's fault . 
  their machine * is * broken , by the sounds of it . 
  the customer should have gotten the hint once op told them it would n't work , but op was sending mixed messages by stating that the machine was n't broken , when it clearly does n't work as expected . 
   it 'd involve giving up on the idea of having a local representative, 
  no it would n't . 
  by far the two most popular proportional systems that i 've seen talked about * both * retain local representation . 
  there 's stv , which is what we already use in the senate . 
  what you 'd do is merge current lower house seats into groups of 4-6 , each seat electing 4-6 members . 
  you 'd now have 4-6 local representatives , at least one of whom is likely to be someone you agree with . 
  there 's mmp , which new zealand currently uses .
