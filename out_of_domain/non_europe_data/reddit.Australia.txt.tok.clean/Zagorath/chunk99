  wtf, 
  yay jill stein !, 
  the sensible social policies of the libertarians , with economic policies that could actually help people !, 
  this is a case of the lesser of two evils . 
  as much as staunch independents seem to hate to admit it , it 's a two party race , and if you 're in a swing state you should vote for the one of the two majors you disagree with the least . 
  for most people ` round here that 's obama . 
  by all means , support and vote for your favourite independent , but realise it 's a wasted vote if you 're in a swing state . 
  oh , and your very last paragraph was a really dickish thing to say . 
  why do people always say between her and god ? 
  surely it 's between her and her family . 
  and what she and they believe as far as religion factors in to what each of them believe . 
  a ) the family is almost always going to help her discuss the options , at least if it is a loving supportive family . 
  b ) she is n't going to discuss this with god , she may take what she believes about god into consideration , but she ca n't actually talk to him . 
  i would n't have mentioned this , but it seems you 've already edited for spelling , so :, 
   intresring, 
  really ? 
  my understanding is that you , and only you , know who you are trying to bankrupt . 
  this is n't an official rule ? 
  damn . 
  also same thing with draw fours , they can add up on themselves , but you ca n't put a draw 4 on a draw 2 or vice versa . 
  last person able to play a draw 4 chooses the colour . 
  sing sing sing and rhapsody in blue !? 
  an awesome selection of music !, 
  i do n't suppose * you * have a record of the pieces from when she was away ? 
  i do n't suppose you could tell us your hypothesis now that no more answers are coming in ? 
  nah , i think a surprisingly large number of people will see it and say `` ooh , you 're that mey-mey from 9gag/facebook !, 
  ( delete as appropriate ) . 
  could be a part of it , because yes they 've gotten bad press . 
  i wo n't get into why it 's bullshit , because that 's been done so many times before . 
  yep, 
  has always been the case , this is n't going to turn off people who were considering it seriously anyway . 
  yep, 
  yep, 
  maybe, 
  to be honest i think the main reason is , as / u/nimx3 says , people were waiting for the iphone 5 to come out so they could compare and then decided the iphone 5 was n't good enough , so they got the s3 . 
  by the way , was it that hard to format your post to make it so each point is clear and distinct ? 
  that , to me , is the obvious answer . 
  all the other things mentioned played a part * in that comparison * , but the precise reason for the jump in sales is exactly what you say . 
  source : my exams were last may . 
  by the way , are you copland/mozart or prokofiev/chinese ? 
  what he means is that you ca n't reach every point on the screen comfortably with one hand , which is true , but not really as relevant as apple would want you to believe . 
  you rarely * need * to reach every point on the screen one-handed , since the keyboard is very easily reached , and the occasional reach to buttons in the top left ( if you have it in your right hand ) is just a short , easy , stretch away . 
  edit : sure , if you needed to reach those buttons in the top corners frequently it would become a pain , but it is n't because you do n't . 
  yep , you get karma for all * links * , you do n't get karma for self posts . 
  i strongly expected the mozart question to be about the first or last movement , but it was on the second . 
  do n't neglect any of the four movements !, 
  for the first and second movements , make sure you have a clear understanding of the sonata form , where each of the themes are used within their movement , or are at least able to quickly identify them within the exam . 
  the third movement is relatively simple , but do be sure to understand its form ( ternary , with each section within the ternary being binary ) and how it differs in the return ( aba ' ) . 
  the fourth movement is perhaps the most complicated , so make sure you know how it uses stretto ( a fugal technique ) throughout the movement , and then that you understand the full fugue use later on in the movement , and can identify all 5 of the themes used , as well as how they relate to each other . 
  [ this picture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:jupiter-fragment.png ) is really handy for that . 
  note that the black theme seems to be a rhythmic diminution of the start of the blue theme . 
  for the copland i would concentrate on the particular things that are special about it , that means mainly rhythm ( including the use of different metres , the cross-rhythms , and the syncopation ) and its influence from mexican folk music ( which is what our question was about ) . 
  if you have the same edition score as we did , the front few pages were really useful in the exam because they gave us info on which folk melodies were used , so we just had to cross-reference them with the actual score . 
  if you do n't have the same edition ( or your edition does n't have the folk melodies in the text at the beginning ) make sure you have them memorised . 
  your teacher should have shown them to you at some point . 
  in addition to those two main things , make sure you have the harmony down . 
  know some places with examples of bitonality , as well as a general understanding of all the key changes . 
  the last thing for copland is the instrumentation . 
  [ here 's a really good pdf i just found ] ( http://central.wmrhsd.org/faculty_files/cmeiseles/41057383-el-salon-mexico-analysis_1[1].pdf ) with notes on the copland . 
  wish i 'd had it when i was studying . 
  good luck !, 
  by the way , you hl or sl , if sl , performing or creating ? 
  no decision , i just did n't know whether the first exams with prokofiev/chinese were next may or this november . 
  ouch : / what do you play ? 
  and what styles did you submit for your compositions ? 
  this probably wo n't help you much , but i 've always considered the theory my strongest point , but i got 29 and 19 ( / 30 and 20 ) for my compositions and performing , and my exam score was a 5 ( / 7 , i forget the exact score ) . 
  you 're going to have to work really hard for this !, 
  oh btw , what grade are you aiming for , and what 's your predicted grade ? 
  are you next may ? 
  edit : if you 're interested , it 's symphony no. 41 `` jupiter '' and el sal\u00f3n m\u00e9xico . 
  good luck , then !, 
  ah , awesome !, 
  thanks for the list . 
  such a shame she missed le sacre , though !, 
  on mac os i ca n't live without [ caffeine ] ( http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/ ) . 
  i would also say wakoopa for all oses , but they shut their free version down :(, 
  truly an amazing piece . 
  the [ orchestral transcription ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khephyelkkc ) , to me , is equally awesome , just slightly different . 
  [ grieg ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xriyt-mrvai ) . 
  ( + [ really bad version and shameless plug ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycz4zkm0mhi ) ), 
  [ grieg ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-emtzfrsrtq ) . 
  [ grieg ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjqwjxcyio8 ) . 
  you may the first of those from the band apocalyptica , they did a version of it . 
  and , not to be a little too clich\u00e9d , but [ beethoven ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6k_iubsrm4 ) . 
  [ beethoven ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqsulr9fymg ) . 
  [ beethoven ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzpg3aht25a ) . 
  and here 's a lesser known ( or at least lesser talked about ) [ beethoven ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qbotgejok ) that really fits the `` heavy '' definition . 
  beethoven 's great for this stuff , there 're heaps more pieces i could have used . 
  [ wagner 's great ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v92obnsqgxu ) , there 's a huge range of his work that would fit , and this almost certainly wo n't be the best pick , but it 's one you probably already know , so i 'll bring it to mind . 
  people have already mentioned verdi 's great dies irae , so how about mozart 's ? 
  not quite as heavy as verdi 's , but awesome nonetheless . 
  in a similar vein to the two of them ( similar in modern day cultural use , but not at all similar in what they were actually meant for when they were written ) , [ o fortuna ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkgcuegezv4 ) !, 
  ( + [ another plug ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jsq-4ejira ) ), 
  lastly , but absolutely not least , this [ schubert string quartet `` death and the maiden '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z42grmr4u2y ) inspired the play ( and the play had a movie made out of it ) of the same name ( and schubert was inspired by a poem , also of the same name poem -  quartet -  play ) . 
  i love death and the maiden . 
  i studied the play in english literature ( easily the best piece of literature i 've ever studied , by the way ) , and it lead me to schubert 's quartet , which it was based off of . 
  absolutely awesome piece of music !, 
  great music , but for `` metal '' i 'd say coriolan . 
  if you take a look at [ these ] ( http://www.kickassclassical.com/classical-music-popular-famous-best-top-100-list.html ) [ two ] ( http://www.kickassclassical.com/classical-music-popular-famous-best-top-200-list.html ) lists , and sort them by `` keyword '' , you may like the pieces listed as `` romantic '' , `` seductive '' , or `` violin '' . 
  i 'd recommend you go through and listen to the previews of all of them .
