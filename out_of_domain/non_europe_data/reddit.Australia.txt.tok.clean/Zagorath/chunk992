  but the number one rule is stats are ** always ** rolled in front of the dm , and preferably in front of the whole party . 
  ** no exceptions . 
  ** not even for my closest and most trusted friend would i make an exception to that rule . 
  other people have given good feedback for everything else and the general case , so i 'll leave it at that . 
  is that an actual thing , or are you trying to make fun of my `` misspelling '' of murphy ? 
  if the latter , i suggest looking up muphry 's law . 
  if the former , i 'm very curious as to what it could be . 
  that 's legal where i am , and is referred to as lane * filtering * . 
  lane splitting , or overtaking moving cars when you do n't have a lane in which to do it , is far more dangerous and illegal here , though apparently not in parts of america . 
  what ... aspect of interrogating prisoners , exactly ? 
  if you 're asking questions and want to know if they 're lying to you or not , that should be insight . 
  if you 're trying to persuade them that telling the truth is in their best interests , or scare them into the same , persuasion or intimidation . 
  i mean ... i * guess * if you did n't want to roleplay the investigation , and just wanted to roll a die to see if you asked the right * questions * , i could * maybe * see that playing out as an investigation check . 
  but really , it sounds kinda lame to me . 
   perception is already the god-skill of the game, 
  it 's funny , i see this sentiment a lot , but i honestly do n't get it . 
  i would * easily * make persuasion and insight , and probably intimidation , deception , athletics , and acrobatics ( the latter two mainly because of shoving and grappling ) ahead of perception . 
  i just do n't get what most people are using perception for . 
  do most campaigns people play just have a whole lot of hidden doors and stealthy enemies than my group typically plays with ? 
  because i basically * never * make or call for perception . 
  when you get a correlation , there are four possibilities :, 
  you have causation in the way you expect . 
  you have a causation in the * opposite * direction . 
  you have a third factor ( or combination of factors ) influencing * both * your first two factors . 
  4 is easy to weed out by repeating the same experiment and/or increasing sample size/reliability of the samples . 
  3 can be minimised as a risk in some cases by carefully controlling for other variables , but it * is * an issue to be aware of , especially in cases where you 're analysing data from the environment rather than conducting an experiment to collect data . 
  much of the time , 2 is a non-issue because it 's god damn obvious that faster windmills do n't cause faster wind . 
  but it certainly is worth being aware of . 
  sometimes , you may get both 1 and 2 being true , in a positive feedback loop . 
  you could even get a combination of 1 , 2 , and 3 , if the system is complex enough . 
  part of the issue stems from the word `` imply '' in the phrase `` correlation does not imply causation '' . 
  mathematically , implies has a very strict meaning . 
  if a is true , then b * must * be true ( but not necessarily the other way around ) . 
  that means a implies b. 
  in common language , implies means something very different . 
  it means `` if a is true , then b is likely to be true ( and maybe the other way around ) '' . 
  in the mathematical sense , the idiom is correct . 
  in the common language sense , it 's frequently not . 
   the gender wage gap is still * statistically significant *, 
  there 's another phrase that people seem not to understand properly . 
  there 's also the issue that , at an earlier age , women are more likely to be subtly pushed/encouraged to go into other fields . 
  it 's not an issue you can fix through any form of legislation , or even put the blame on anyone in particular , but it is a real one . 
   i honestly believe they put the capital in the middle of nowhere so no one would bother, 
  i mean , that 's not * so * far from the truth . 
  there was a story going around a while ago claiming that , at least for australia ( which has no existing nuclear infrastructure -- so we 'd be talking about building it up from scratch , rather than just * not * closing what 's already there ) , it would be more expensive to switch to nuclear power at this point than to go all in on renewables . 
  i do n't know for sure if that 's accurate or not , but it 's very interesting , at least . 
  the labor party is ** far ** from perfect . 
  i 'll not be voting [ 1 ] for them at the next election , that 's for sure . 
  but for fuck 's sake stop acting as if they are as bad as the coalition . 
  labor was going to get us an nbn . 
  labor got through our emissions trading scheme . 
  the coalition are the ones who reversed both of the above . 
  the coalition are the ones cutting funding to the abc . 
  the coalition are the ones cutting funding to public education and healthcare . 
  the coalition are the ones who cover up official attention given to things like asylum seekers in detention or arriving by boat , and this very issue regarding the barrier reef . 
  labor is officially in support of marriage equality . 
  yes , the greens are better , vote them . 
  i will be . 
  but do n't act as though labor is * just as bad * as the coalition . 
  ** they are not . 
  better . 
  his policies are no worse ( not really better , either ) , but he at least is n't an embarrassment on the global stage , either . 
  it 's not a * lot * better , but there is * something * to be said . 
  the liberal national coalition is australia 's main conservative/right-wing party . 
  our prior government had a really good policy in place with an emissions trading scheme , but the lnp got rid of that very soon after they were previously elected , largely thanks to some strong attack ads ( and a nearly entirely right-wing media ) against the policy . 
   gillard passed on a carbon tax, 
  nope . 
  the murdoch press has gotten to you . 
  gillard passed exactly what she should have . 
  a fixed-price period leading in to an emissions trading scheme . 
  the fixed-price period is what economists recommend for an ets , because it gives polluters a grace period in which they can adjust . 
  it does n't help that neither the more neutral and left wing press , nor labor themselves , even tried very hard to correct them . 
  pines of rome is amazing !, 
  and you played cor anglais super jealous , it has an awesome part at the beginning of the final movement . 
  and when the bassoon joins in for their brief duet . 
  mmmmm . 
  beautiful . 
  but of course , the ending of the piece is just amazing . 
  the most epic grand finale you could hope for . 
  [ here 's the video , for anyone interested ] ( https://youtu.be/ivgyfqzlc0a?t=1142 ) . 
  i 've never heard of them before . 
  links to some of their best videos ? 
  the kurzgesagt video is great , but i ca n't help but feel it would have been a better crossover with grey 's transporter video than this one . 
  the question it 's answering , while superficially related to you are two , has much more to do with the ship of theseus than with the difference between the two hemispheres of the brain . 
  so for reference , the fine is a pretty small one for not voting , and it 's super easy to supply an adequate excuse . 
  they 're not very strict on it , really . 
  you do n't actually have to `` vote '' , either . 
  just get your name ticked off . 
  you can draw a cock 'n' balls on the ballot paper and put that in the box ; or just take it straight from the person who hands it to you , walk over to the collection box , and drop it in , without even pretending to actually vote ; and you wo n't get in trouble . 
  the idea is that if everyone has to vote , everyone will do at least a little bit of research , leading to both a more informed public , and a parliament that is actually the will of the people , and not the will of the few who have n't been disenfranchised by the system . 
  how well that works in practice is a matter of some contention . 
  i know that in vietnam coffee is generally served in a glass , but then their most popular coffee is iced , so it 's probably different . 
   a bit irritating that they charge you more to cook it yourself, 
  what the fuck ? 
  i 've never actually had galbi in australia , but in korea the norm is that you 'd cook it yourself . 
  they certainly do n't charge extra for it . 
  the give you your meat on a plate , and come by every now and then to change the grill ( they 've got some weird superstitions about letting things get burnt ) , but otherwise you 're left to it . 
  getting it in vietnam is the exact opposite experience . 
  the servers do it all for you . 
  they do it at the table , which is a little weird , but they do n't give you the option to do it yourself .
