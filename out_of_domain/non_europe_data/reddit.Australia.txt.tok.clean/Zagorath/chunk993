  which is a shame , because the communal experience improves it , i reckon . 
   severed like this, 
  i do n't know if that 's a typo or a clever play on words . 
  but i 'm going to assume the latter , because it 's cool . 
  if this is a publicity stunt , it 's a pretty crap one . 
  op did n't mention the name of the place , and neither has anyone in this comment thread , that i 've seen . 
  all i know is it 's in melbourne somewhere , and honestly that 's what i 'd have assumed from the rest of the description anyway . 
  hey / u/gregmartinez , your bot seems to have double posted for some reason . 
  i 'm a fan of the rfc date standard myself ( specifically , [ rfc822 ] ( https://www.w3.org/protocols/rfc822/ ) and [ rfc2822 ] ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822 ) ) , at least in human communication ( iso standard for digital storage all the way ) , but i think most of us can agree it 's worth using a nonsensical date format temporarily to celebrate pi day . 
  ( though tau is totally better . ), 
  that would n't explain why they post shit on / r/brisbane and their own sub though , would it ? 
  people be weird , i guess . 
  did they have a response explaining why they use investigation for interrogations , or how they flavour it ? 
  and the butter meme is n't funny . 
  it was mildly amusing at first , but it 's old and tired and boring by this point . 
  i 'll be honest , i 've never even really * started * that bit of the game . 
  i always end up playing it heaps over a weekend and then dropping it for months . 
  by the time i pick it back up , i 've forgotten what i was up to and decide to start the game again . 
  i do n't think i 've ever gotten past a point where i had a village and a castle , still as a vassal of one of the default kings . 
  well , as i said in my previous comment , i * can * see it being usable in theory . 
  investigation , when used in its conventional sense , is making up for the fact that the * players * are unable to physically interact with the world to readily notice things out of place , and their characters are likely smarter than them and better able to make deductive leaps . 
  that problem tends not to exist in social encounters , since you can roleplay them out with the dm taking the place on the character you 're interrogating . 
  so there 's no need for a roll . 
  you 'd roll specifically at certain points to see if he 's intimidated/persuaded by you , or if he believes your lies , but there 's no need to roll to see if you 're asking the right questions in the right way to even have a chance of success . 
  but if you * wanted * to roll for it ; to just say `` i try to interrogate him to get x piece of information '' or `` i interrogate him to see what he knows about event y '' , i can see that being done as a charisma ( investigation ) check . 
  it would n't be * fun * , in my opinion , but it would be the best way to do such a thing within the rules . 
  imo m&b just requires too much quick timing to play multiplayer . 
  i 've found its servers must n't be as good as games like team fortress or other big fps games i 've played , and the ping/lag is just too high in general . 
  location , too . 
  it 's not a property of the unit itself , but the sarranids are far enough away that you have less need to worry about wars messing with your village than anyone else . 
  using mamlukes for cav also means you 're less likely to be at war with the nords than swadia , resulting in less chance for the negative moral penalty of your best foot troops . 
   also helps that swadian villages are easy to reach from any empire . 
  actually that 's my biggest reason against swadia . 
  go sarranid and your have the best chance of getting your first village to prosperity rather than being constantly raided , because of how out of the way it is . 
  you 're also less likely to be at war with the nords and get the penalty that comes with that . 
  there 's no such thing as diplomacy in 5e . 
  if there was , it * might * be the stat we 're looking for here , although it 'd be a bit of a stretch . 
  my question is , which of the social stats would you use for the scenario i described ? 
  because none of them fit very well imo , which is why charisma ( investigation ) is useful . 
  thanks , that comment is very helpful . 
  it does n't make me like whatsapp any more , because i just do n't believe that phone numbers should be used for identification outside of actual cellular communications ( sms , mms , and phone calls ) , but at least now i know where the market is at today , with whatsapp as by far the worst , imessages and hangouts somewhat better , and facebook messenger the ideal . 
  you seem to be completely missing the point of 5e 's `` skills with different abilities '' philosophy . 
  you are assuming here that you * know * whether you want to scare them , persuade them , or deceive them . 
  what if you do n't ? 
  what if you just want `` to get that information '' ? 
  that was the above scenario , and none of the main social skills work . 
  yeah , it still gets raided for sure . 
  i 've just found hawaha tends to get raided a hell of a lot less frequently than mechin , which is one of my other favourite starting villages . 
  i usually find it going the other way . 
  poor rhodoks just get annihilated . 
  i agree , i far prefer to use my voice . 
  i can actually say which side i 'll be passing on etc. 
  it 's far more useful . 
  but legally , no , your voice does not qualify . 
  is it like lang park , in the sense that the average person is more likely to refer to it by the non-sponsored name ? 
  or do most people actually know it as aami ? 
  oh that 's interesting . 
  lang park is not considered an acceptable sponsor-free name far the afc ? 
  but my question was actually a slightly different one : what do * normal people of melbourne * usually refer to aami/melbourne rectangular as ? 
  do they call it aami , melbourne rectangular , or do they have an equivalent of our lang park ? 
  i find it odd that as a nord you would n't consider it totally worth going out of your way to grab mamlukes . 
  you 're right next to swadia , and that means you 're going to be at war with them frequently . 
  troops get a morale penalty when you 're at war with their faction . 
  so you want to minimise the number of troops you 've got from factions you 're at war with . 
  ah interesting . 
  when i use a mouse chrome does n't bounce at all , not in the expected direction or the opposite one . 
  you using the apple mouse or a third party one ? 
  the apple one is really more like a trackpad or touchscreen in how it scrolls than a conventional mouse , so it would make sense , but my third-party mouse just hits a hard edge . 
  i believe there 's some basic screen recording stuff built in to quicktime x. 
  just go to file -  new screen recording . 
  [ here 's how it looks for me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6outnnzmr9q ) . 
   syntax in 3 is fully backwards compatible into 2, 
  not quite true , in at least one crucial way . 
  in python 3 , ` / ` does floating point division , and ` / / ` is needed to force integer division . 
  in python 2 , ` / ` defaults to integer division but will do floating point if one of the operators is a float . 
  i tried that , but it unfortunately does n't seem to be working properly for me :(, 
  [ it just hangs on `` request new token ( ref ) '' ] ( / r/redditdev/comments / 4luksa/oauth2util _ stuck_on_request_new_token_ref / ) and does n't move on from there . 
  edit : turns out the darn thing does n't work in ` ssh ` . 
  if it ca n't open a web browser , it just silently loops forever . 
  got it working now , yay !, 
   maybe you play on the most popular siege servers, 
  i do n't think so . 
  i usually just look desperately for the ones with the lowest ping but also enough users online to be fun . 
  it 's basically impossible . 
  yeah but anyone using a password like ` 5pg9k09 . 
  okay , so i eventually managed to figure it out . 
  apparently this ca n't be done over ` ssh ` , it has to be done locally , since it tries to open up a web browser in the stage that locked . 
  when i did that , it brought up an authentication page for * this * account , when i think i wanted it to authenticate to / u/parliamentpagebot . 
  the bot has both this account and that registered as its devs , but i needed the bot to be submitting from that account . 
  i ended up logging out of this and into that , and authenticated it to that account . 
  just to be sure , did i * need * to log out of this account and in to that one to get it working ? 
  or would it have been sufficient to have clicked approve on this account ? 
  another quarter as many in half a year is pretty damn impressive . 
  assuming that 's a consistent growth rate ( an unlikely assumption , to be sure ) , that would mean we 're doubling roughly every 18 months . 
  edit : a couple of other points . 
  * either you made a typo in your title , or the number has actually gone * down * by one since you posted it . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  * there 's a total of 1 game available on steam but not on windows . 
  when not filtering the game list at all , it says 9071 games available , when filtering by available on windows , it changes to say 9070 . 
  i wish steam allowed negative filtering , because i want to know what it is !,
