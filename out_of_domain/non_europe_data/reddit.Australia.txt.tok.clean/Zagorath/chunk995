  but microsoft should not be forcing people to do it against their will , and anyone that wants to stay on windows 7 or windows 8.1 should be allowed to easily do that . 
  forced upgrades on application software are great . 
  forced upgrades of an operating system are not . 
  upgrading an operating system results in a massive change to the basic interface with the entire computer . 
  it can produce incompatibilities with software the user relies on . 
  even worse , it can result in incompatibilities with the * hardware * they 're using . 
  why should i ? 
  i love unix for reasons that are completely unrelated to privacy . 
  i love the extensibility , i love the terminal and the set of unix tools that usually come with it . 
  i love the unix philosophy of a tool that does one thing and does it well , and piping results of one tool into another , rather than one massive piece of software that does a bunch of stuff . 
  just because i love all that , there 's no reason that i have to be some sort of stallman-esque nutter for everything open source or against anything that collects any sort of data . 
  i 'm not a huge fan of what microsoft is doing with privacy stuff , but nor do i particularly mind . 
  when google does similar things , i * like * it , because i love all the services they provide that utilise that collected data to do great things . 
  not that i 'm defending the forced upgrades . 
  while i think people * should * upgrade , i also think it should absolutely be their choice to do so , and it should not ** ever ** be forced upon them . 
  fwiw , i 'm writing this from kubuntu . 
  damn , i feel you . 
  the upgrade started in like june last year or something , was n't it ? 
  mine eventually got around to letting me upgrade in february this year . 
   microsoft 's recent non-efforts of maintaining skype on linux, 
  that 's hardly recent . 
  skype on linux is fucking * ancient * . 
  i do n't actually know when the last update is , but it * looks * like skype for windows from like 2006 . 
  personally i absolutely * hated * mint when i tried it . 
  i used ubuntu with unity for ages , and it was okay , but many mild annoyances started to add up . 
  i 've been using kubuntu ( ubuntu with kde ) for a few weeks now , and i absolutely love it . 
  it took me about five minutes with a liveusb before i was 100 % convinced i needed to switch . 
  everything just suddenly clicked . 
  out of the box it 's near perfect , and the few minor tweaks it needed ( like application grouping , and having the super/windows button open the start menu ) were easy to add in . 
  i was just looking this up earlier today . 
  * steam has a grand total of 9073 games . 
  * windows supports 9072 of them ( unfortunately i do n't know how to find out which * one * it does n't have ) . 
  * os x supports 3463 . 
  * linux + steamos has 2308 . 
  edit : that one game is apparently [ call of duty : black ops - mac edition ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/214630/ ) . 
  thanks to a user from / r/macgaming for that one . 
   but with 100 % full power and control of your system, 
  except if you want to move the dock around , for some reason . 
  honestly , plenty of small things started nagging me about unity , but that one was the final straw . 
  it being stuck on the left hand side of your primary monitor is a huge pain when you have another monitor to the left of it . 
  i believe the most recent version also lets you put it at the bottom of the screen , but you still ca n't move it around as easily as kde panel . 
  hells , it 's more restrictive in this respect than the windows taskbar or the os x dock . 
  `` like switching to mac os '' is actually a * really * apt analogy , since the problems op mentioned would be nearly identical on os x as on linux , since both are unix-based and use similar philosophies for filesystem mounting . 
  edit : heh . 
  pun not intended . 
  i get your point , but that 's a bit of an exaggeration . 
  at level 5 , you 're probably looking at between 22 and 52-ish hp , and about +7 to hit . 
  maximum 3rd level spell slots , with save dcs of about 15 . 
  your ac is probably maxing out at 18 , * maybe * 19 . 
  a nalfeshnee ( cr 13 demon ) has 184 hp , an ac of 18 , and it has +10 to hit , so it 's going to be hitting a * lot * of the time . 
  it can frighten a bunch of your party to get them temporarily out of the fight ( recharging on a 5-6 ) , it can teleport to a safer location for itself ( unlimited times ) , and makes three attacks on turns where it does n't do those other options , doing 32 , 15 , and 15 damage . 
  it can potentially knock two players to zero hp in a single turn if it gets lucky . 
  it also has resistance to nonmagical weapons , as well as cold , fire , and lightning damage , and immunity to poison . 
  a party of four 5th level characters * might * be able to take it in exceptional circumstances , but it 's so exceedingly difficult that it 's not really worth mentioning . 
  really , you should never be doing more than 4 or 5 crs higher than the party level , and even then you 'd better hope they 're going to get the drop on it . 
  bounded accuracy is super super cool and useful , and it definitely improves the game vastly , but it 's more appropriate the other way around : using large numbers of creatures way too weak on their own to be a threat to the pcs . 
  it works upwards as well , but that only goes so far before the sheer damage output versus its effective hp ( hp after resistances , healing , etc. 
  are taken into account ) becomes too much for 3-5 players to handle . 
  interesting . 
  any idea why it was released as a completely different game to the windows version ? 
  i hope that comment was directed at someone other than me . 
  because it sure * looks * like it 's directed at me ... 
  wait is kde demanding ? 
  it 's always * felt * to me like a lighter interface than unity was . 
  but yeah , the great thing about linux is that there 's a distro and flavour for everyone , out there somewhere . 
  holy shit do n't even talk like that !, 
  the watch later list is the entirety of my youtube experience . 
  or at least over 90 % of it . 
  i go through my subscriptions page and add in all the videos from it that i think i 'll be interested in watching ( nearly all of them ) . 
  i 'll also frequently add more videos from the sidebar suggestions on the watch page, 
  i doubt they would . 
  it might not be something a lot of people use , but for those that do , it * has * to be a feature that increases viewing time significantly . 
  if you can add multiple videos to your watch later from the watch page , rather than just clicking on a single video one by one , that * has * to result in more videos being watched , right ? 
  plus , they just recently finally fixed the `` remove watched '' feature that was broken for so long . 
  since they bothered to do that , i do n't see them removing it . 
  would n't stealth & sentinels , or sneaks & sentinels , or something like that , be a better name ? 
  i dunno , i just do n't feel like `` strongholds '' adds anything useful to the name of a stealth system . 
  anyway , ca n't read through it in details right now . 
  i got ta be up early tomorrow . 
  but i read the description of it on the blog page and i really like the idea at least . 
  stealth has in general been one of the biggest areas that i feel is sorely lacking in d&d . will most certainly be giving this a thorough look over at some point -- tomorrow probably not until friday afternoon , but possibly tomorrow . 
  you could do it with crown of thorn starfish . 
  they 're a pest that destroy coral reefs . 
  when you say they `` hit '' it , are you saying that they dosed you ? 
  like , you were dosed and can actually trace the source to netflix ? 
  or is it that they 've just blocked your ip addresses from accessing their site ? 
  got a source on that ? 
  the official feedback they gave us on the survey said that it was fairly well received , but not super highly anticipated . 
  i ca n't find anything about it on mearls ' twitter account , going back as far as late april . 
  but 10 < 95 . 
  clearly it 's not `` up '' . 
  most likely because of how they were in 3 . x. 
  looking at the 1 official 5e prc we 've seen , and the good examples of homebrew stuff , they a * really * great idea if used properly . 
  but many people ca n't see past how they were used in 3 . x.

  he did n't say it was `` not well received '' he said `` lukewarm '' , which generally means `` kinda well received , but not fantastic '' .
