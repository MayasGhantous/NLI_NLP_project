  [ here 's the source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=druf18socha ) . 
  it 's from the rocketjump youtube channel . 
  it 's what the freddie w. ( run by freddie wong ) channel turned into . 
  they 've got a bunch of great shorts , as well as some longer stuff ( video game high school is probably their most famous ) , and some educatational things on the associated rocketjump film school channel . 
  [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6hp8bkb24 ) from that channel went viral a little while back , so you may have come across them before and not noticed . 
  honestly i 'd say it 's * less * official than ua is . 
  hear , hear !, 
  i think 10 years is a bit generous . 
  that would put windows vista in the public domain next year . 
  edit : and portal 1 . 
  and oblivion would already * be * public domain . 
  something more like 15 or 20 years ( still substantially less than the original us copyright length of 28 years ) . 
  my best guess for / r/dnd would be the two new books wizards of the coast announced for d&d 5e . 
  but i do n't even think they were posted in that subreddit : it 'd be more of a reason for / r/dndnext to be trending . 
  hey thanks for the offer , but no thanks . 
  the shipping costs internationally would just never be worth it . 
  i do n't suppose you 'd have any tips about finding the kind of stores that would sell them ? 
  i 've mostly only looked online , because i really do n't know where i would possibly look otherwise . 
  oh yes , i 'm well aware of who he is xd . 
  been following his work since the vampire prestige class . 
  just did n't make the connection with the tag . 
   would n't that be medium , like a human ? 
  i 'm confused, 
  yeah medium is fine , my issue was with ( and here 's where the lack of copy-paste ability from this pdf annoys me ... ), 
   approximately the same size as a human , modrons have a substantial mass and weight . 
  rather than just reiterating that the size is * exactly * 6 feet and 200 pounds . 
  ( and , as i just noticed now , saying `` mass and weight '' is kinda redundant . ), 
   i 'm starting to label my homebrew posts that way to make these posts more readily identifiable, 
  awesome !, 
  i 'll always look forward to seeing your stuff , so having it be easier to find is great !, 
  the thing about d&d is that unlike mobas , it 's not a competition . 
  you 're working * together * with your dm and the other players in your party in order to collaboratively tell a story and kick some monster arse . 
  there certainly can be jerks around , but it comes in a very different form to what you 'd get in competitive multiplayer video games , because this is a type of game that 's fundamentally different from that . 
  working fine for me . 
  not really . 
  / r/dnd is mostly general stuff . 
  pictures , memes , videos , that kind of thing . 
  some discussion about characters , stories , and stuff , too , but not a lot of worthwhile mechanical discussion . 
  ( not to say that that 's bad , at all !, 
  the story is , imo , far more * important * to the game than the mechanics . ), 
  for discussion about the actual game : new content that 's released , analysis of different feats , classes , items , etc. , / r/dndnext is much , * much * better . 
  no but that 's the thing . 
  there 's * far * more quantity of discussion over mechanics on / r/dndnext . 
  just look at the corresponding unearthed arcana threads every time one of them is released . 
  / r/dndnext gets as many as twice the number of comments . 
  the two latest books announced each had threads that were upvoted so little i never even saw them until i went back just now and scrolled through multiple pages to find them . 
  and the number of comments in the two threads * combined * is 128 . 
  the / r/dndnext thread for the volo book got 156 on its own . 
  the two subreddits are both worthwhile , but they exist for different purposes , and if your interest is specifically 5e , / r/dndnext is by far the more useful place . 
  edit : links to the threads in question :, 
  * / r/dnd/comments / 4m4szy/the _ next_dd_adventure_will_be_called_storm_kings /, 
  * / r/dnd/comments / 4m4uba/new _ dd_supplement_announced_volos_guide_to /, 
  * / r/dndnext/comments / 4m4ay0/volos _ guide_to_monsters /, 
  * / r/dndnext/comments / 4m4ats/storm _ kings_thunder /, 
  i ca n't remember if we 're getting an unearthed arcana this monday or one of their new `` show off our shit platform for subpar homebrew '' columns , but if it 's a ua , just wait and watch the size of the threads that spawn out of that . 
  both will be rather large , but i can almost guarantee that the / r/dndnext one will be larger . 
  it nearly always is . 
  nothing wrong with wanting to skip it , but it 's not like it 's gauging or anything . 
  the book is going to be as fully featured as the monster manual we already have ( less new monsters , but more detail on the flavour of each of the monsters , including both new and existing ones , plus the playable races ) . 
  if that does n't float your boat , that 's fine , but the issue then is more the content than the price . 
  i forget , is this month going to be an unearthed arcana or a waste of time ? 
  need to know whether to start getting excited or not . 
  i remember hearing about monsters in a different roleplaying game , not d&d , where if a certain word was said in their presence , they gain the ability to teleport to a nearby location . 
  when i saw `` redcaps '' in the title of this , it reminded me of that . 
  i do n't know if that 's what they were actually called , and i 'm having trouble googling for relevant information . 
  but if it is , that 'd be a really cool feature to add in , and i wonder why it 's missing here . 
  yeah i found them later . 
  you can find my links to them further down the thread . 
  point was , though , they certainly got a * lot * less attention on / r/dnd than on / r/dndnext . 
  i feel like a lot of people have not understand your point , op . 
  if we call what op is referring to `` x '' , then op 's interested in an x that relates to the phb as volo 's guide relates to the mm . 
  something that is in * part * like a phb2 ( like volo 's guide is * kinda * a mm2 ) , but is n't entirely , since it adds a heap of other stuff like flavour and non-phb-style content . 
  it 's a bit like scag , but around the same length as the core books , and with a higher ratio of player content to other stuff than scag has ( while still being quite a lot lower than the ratio the phb has ) . 
  ok , how about this one . 
  spinrite is a piece of software that can be used for hard drive maintenance and recovery . 
  it works at a level below the operating system : directly with the hardware . 
  as such , there has been very little about it that * needs * updating : it works today just as well as it did when the last version of it was released in 2004 , with a couple of very minor exceptions . 
  it would be ludicrous for the copyright on that to have expired already , and it would force the programme 's creator to either go out of business , or create updates more hastily and potentially introduce bugs -- something that , in software running at such a low level , could do * serious * harm . 
  i would not be at all surprised to hear of other similar tales of software that fulfils a specific and fairly niche purpose in large enterprises that does not get updated frequently , but is still used . 
  how would it be fair to deprive the company that created that software of an income source after only 10 years . 
  yeah , i mean there 's probably still a few things around * today * running on 32-bit time , but in another * two decades * , it 'll be pretty astonishing if you can find anything that is . 
  does anyone know if this is a deliberate bit of functionality the devs have put in the game ? 
  or is it due to an incidental slower response to picking up a respawned flag than to capping ? 
  i 've been using [ borderless internet ] ( http://borderlessinternet.com/ ) , and it works brilliantly . 
  the service is fairly new , and it does drop from time to time , but the devs are super responsive on [ their subreddit ] ( / r/borderlessinternet ) , and problems tend to get solved prety quickly . 
  i do n't know yet whether i 'll be paying for it once my free trial runs out ( they had a deal when i signed up a few months ago to get it free until july , i do n't know how long they give you if you sign up today , but probably one month ) , but i 'm very , * very * seriously considering it . 
  $ 40 per year , or $ 4 per month . 
  it comes with some built in phishing protection and some other stuff as well . 
  hey sorry , but i have removed your submission because it does n't pass post requirements number 1 ( see side bar ) . 
  as a general rule , any content submitted here need to be `` ready-to-play '' . 
  if you 're looking for advice on homebrew stuff , try the latest [ arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4knu88/the _ arcana_forge / ) . 
   while there is n't really a lot of ability penalties in 5e there are some . 
  ( i ca n't remember where i found it but i 'm 80 % sure one of the ( sub ) races in the phb has a -1 to something ), 
  i ca n't say for certain there are * none * anywhere in the game 's ruleset , but i can say that they 're exceedingly rare . 
  there are * definitely * no core races that get a penalty to their ability score number . 
  drow have disadvantage on stuff in sunlight , so that might be what you were thinking of . 
  the simple fact of it is that this is 5e , and static penalties are very much * not * in the design ethos of 5e . 
  if you 're making stuff for this edition , you need to drop the assumptions and norms from other editions . 
  all that stuff about physical stats being worth more and dropping two mental stats to increase a physical one ? 
  forget it .
