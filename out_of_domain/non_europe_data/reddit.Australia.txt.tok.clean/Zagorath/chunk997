  ignore it ** entirely ** . 
  what most races get is +2 to one stat and +1 to another . 
  there are exceptions to this : one race that can get +1 to everything ( or +1 to two things only ) , one subrace that gets two +2 s , and one race that gets a +2 and two +1 s. 
  one thing that * might * be considered reasonable would be a race that gets a +3 to something and no other stat increases . 
  the more salient point is why should we * not * reward someone for innovating . 
  the entire point of copyright is so that someone who creates something can benefit from it . 
  if you shorten the term of copyright to stupidly short lengths , you 're undermining the entire point of it , and * harming creators * . 
  touch\u00e9, 
   making your encrypted password vault more widely accessible ( e.g. 
  using a centralized service ) _ does _ increase the risk of it getting compromised . 
  yeah , but it also makes it actually * useful * . 
  if you ca n't access your passwords on a computer at work or a friend 's place , all the security in the world is just an inconvenience .

  nah , 1061 is a pretty easy course to be honest . 
  by far the easiest of the maths courses i 've done at uq ( others being 1051 , 1052 , and stat2203 ) . 
  make sure you have a decent calculator ( i recommend the fx-100au plus ) , since you 'll be doing gcd ( ) a lot , and while you 're supposed to do it by hand , having a calculator that can check your answers for you is really convenient . 
  ditto prime factoring . 
  it 's a very different type of maths to anything you 've done already . 
  if you can add , multiple , subtract , and divide , you 've already got most of what you 'll need going in to 1061 . 
  a lot of the rest of it is more about formal logic than what we typically think of as `` maths '' . 
  i do n't have marshmallow . 
  i was the opposite . 
  i normally love this kind of video . 
  stuff like what richard grayson puts out is awesome . 
  but to be honest , this was really uninteresting to me . 
  just dull . 
  wtf is this shit ? 
  there are people that want to just get rid of like half of the english language ? 
  for what reason ? 
  this sounds utterly moronic . 
   dont make webs , stay out of your way and hunt pests, 
  sounds a lot more like a cat than a dog , to me . 
  [ oh yeah ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/50/ac/99/50ac99bbd4f888ff9f6ae426dedb2571.jpg ) , [ how could i ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/66/3c/27/663c27bf68a118e0fac4cafa49cb63f8.jpg ) [ possible have forgotten ] ( http://www.sarahderemer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/spider-cat.jpg ) ? 
  but it 's so cute and adorable and ** fluffy ** !, 
  hey sorry , but i 've removed your post . 
  this is a subreddit for sharing stories from roleplaying games . 
  if you want advice on the mechanics , the best place to go is probably / r/dndnext . 
  and for basic questions like this , the * very * best place to go is [ the question thread ] ( / r/dndnext/comments / 4lpwx3/weekly _ question_thread_may_30_2016 / ) . 
  hope that helps !, 
  just a suggestion , since this is just text with no formatting , you 'd be far better off sharing it in text form . 
  this picture is not very high quality , and even the best quality screenshots will be worse than unrasterised text . 
  you could link to a google doc with the text in it , or make a self post using reddit 's markdown formatting . 
  it 's not against the rules as it is now though , so i wo n't remove it ( though i will * suggest * you remove it yourself and resubmit in a better format ) . 
   it 's a good idea to use native words more often, 
  what the fuck does this even mean ? 
  `` native '' english words are both latin * and * germanic derived , because that 's what the language * is * . 
   many of them simpler and more powerful than their latinate equivalents, 
  perhaps , but they 're also far less evocative . 
  one of the biggest advantages that english has is its immense expressiveness that comes as a result of having these dual origins . 
  two words that essentially mean more or less the same thing , but have radically ( or sometimes more subtly ) different connotations . 
  trying to remove all that seems not just futile , but just plain * stupid * . 
  i could have said `` unwise '' , as the germanic-derived term , but the connotations there are so radically different as to make it completely inappropriate . 
  secrets one player keeps from another ? 
  totally fine . 
  secret * plans * a player keeps from the dm ? 
  usually fine . 
  secret * actions * taken the dm does n't know about ? 
  not fine at all . 
  if the dm does n't know something happened , it * did n't happen * , as far as i 'm concerned , except perhaps for conversations between player characters that take place during down time irl . 
   charged according to their usage ( like i am ), 
  that 's really , really interesting . 
  i do n't think i 've ever * heard * of it working that way with broadband before . 
  typically the way it works ( from my experience in australia , korea , and vietnam ) is you 'll either get unlimited , or you 'll have a certain number of gigabytes per month . 
  if you go over that limit , a bunch of different things could happen depending on your provider , but the most common in australia is to have your speed slowed to dial-up speeds . 
  charging an exorbitant amount per mb over the cap is common on mobile systems , and one could also theoretically cut off all access after that limit . 
  i 've heard of pay per megabyte on mobile phones ( though even with those , having a plan with a certain number of gigs/megs is * far * more common these days ) , but * never * with broadband home internet . 
  where , pray tell , do you live ? 
  incidentally , is that 0.25 also the delay between grabbing and being poppable ? 
  science absolutely * does * provide some absolute truths . 
  not all of them , but there are some . 
  * the earth * does * orbit the sun . 
  * there * is * a maximum speed at which any massive entity can move through space . 
  * the closer to this maximum speed something goes , the slower it perceives time relative to anything stationary . 
  just to name a few . 
  is this the same front that was battering seq yesterday , moved south , or a completely separate one ? 
  in d&d it 's more common to use the word `` faction '' to refer to basically what you 're calling a guild . 
  in faer\u00fbn , two of the most prominent factions are the harpers and the zhentarim . 
  the harpers are a secretive spy-like agency that aims to protect the world from threats , and the zhents are an evil group that aims to gain control over it , and get more power for themselves . 
  both these groups are very secretive , and a member of one will typically not want even their loved ones to know ( `` for their safety '' , much like in most superhero tales ) . 
  to join , you would get recruited by them for showing ideals that seem to align with their own . 
  other factions include the lords ' alliance and a nature-protecting one whose name i 've forgotten . 
  i imagine these groups are quite a bit less secretive . 
  if you 're not playing in faer\u00fbn , it would behove you to be aware of or create factions for your own world . 
  whether you call them factions or guilds is up to you , there 's little difference in practice . 
  you could have some of each , with slight differences in what the terms mean . 
  '' * maybe i should put aside my preference to hunt alone in order to take down this bigger threat * '', 
  we are talking about theoretically * genius spiders * here , after all . 
  the standard editor/interpreter that people usually download their first time using python is also named `` idle '' after eric idle . 
  there are three basic types of spellcasters . 
  spells known casters : these guys , like sorcerers and warlocks , have a certain number of spells that they know . 
  they can always cast any of these . 
  spells prepared casters : these guys , like druids and clerics , have a certain number of spells that they can prepare per day . 
  they choose these from their entire class spell list . 
  wizards : they have both of the above . 
  they have a spellbook with spells in it ( their `` spells known '' ) , and each day they prepare a certain number of these spells for the day . 
   you have a list of location sizes , from `` thorp '' to `` metropolis . '', 
  not sure why you would care . 
  it 's just a label on top of the size of the town . 
  the size itself is the important part .
