  because to do that is to undermine the entire * point * of constructive criticism and the ability to critique . 
  you 're probably right , but what of it ? 
  if a business 's monetary interests happen to align with the socially right choice , why should we criticise the business for going with that ? 
  what happened to / u/3fun ? 
  he will be sorely missed . 
  one of our longest-serving and most successful members and speakers , the parliament owes him a lot . 
  rip . 
  yes , i think that does sound acceptable , and also extremely useful . 
  i would be really glad to see you post something like it . 
  that said , * this * thread does n't fit within the rules of the subreddit . 
  we require submissions be the complete content in a usable form . 
  not perfect and refined , but at least without major gaps . 
  if you want to solicit interest or advice on how to fill in major gaps in something , you should ask in [ the arcana forge megathread ] ( / r/unearthedarcana/comments / 4knu88/the _ arcana_forge / ) . 
  i 've removed this thread , but i very much look forward to seeing the system you have come up with submitted here . 
  i was assuming at least average by human standards , and my reading of the other comments in the thread is that they were doing the same . 
  the problem with this is that rolling a 20 immediately gives you 1 hp , making you conscious again . 
  it 's `` jumps '' . 
  there 's no `` s '' in the sentence otherwise . 
  oh man , that first shot of him in that ad reminded me so much of sir ian richardson 's portrayal of francis urquhart from house of cards . 
  if they were ever to remake the british house of cards ( not that i think they should ) , charles dance would be such a perfect lead . 
  oh man that was such a great series . 
  almost like a proto-game of thrones in a way . 
  the description does n't hurt that image , either :, 
   set against a backdrop of war , religious strife and power struggles which tears lives and families apart . 
  i vote we call it / r/modeldownunder . 
  link ? 
  awesome thanks . 
  that whole thread ( and the one linked within it ) is great !, 
  yeah but let 's be honest , in context , when someone says `` classical instrument '' what they * really * mean is `` orchestral instrument '' , and by that they mean `` instrument frequently used in or with an orchestra during the common practice period '' . 
  it 's fine to use words according to their commonly understood definition , even if it does n't * strictly * align with a literal interpretation of the words . 
  and before you point out counter examples , yes , guitar * has * been used in and with orchestras . 
  so have saxophones and a host of other instruments . 
  but again , that 's not the sort of piece that people are thinking of when they use the word `` classical instrument '' . 
  they set a record !, 
  you noticed it three times specifically ? 
  there 's apparently a guideline in screen writing -- especially in fantasy -- that a major new introduction should be foreshadowed three times before it is introduced . 
  hey thanks , i really appreciate the offer , but i 'd feel bad benefiting from the charity of strangers like that , especially ( but not exclusively ) considering how expensive shipping to aus from the us is . 
  and besides , i 've already got plenty of supple wax . 
  my desire for frangible wax is really just because i think it 's cooler to have the wax actually * break * when whatever is being sealed is opened . 
  the supple stuff is mostly good enough for my purposes anyway . 
  thanks again for offering , though . 
  i 've never listened to it , but abc classic fm puts out [ two different podcasts ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/classic/listen/podcasts.htm ) . 
  the radio station itself is absolutely fantastic with a great variety of popular favourites , more obscure `` gems '' , and newer works , alongside some often very interesting interviews and discussions with guests from various parts of the classical music industry and other related industries . 
  it 's not geo-blocked , [ so you can listen live here ] ( https://radio.abc.net.au/stations/classic/live?play=true ) . 
  as i said , i 've not listened to the podcasts , but my faith in the station itself makes me believe that they are probably very good as far as being examples of whatever style of conversation the podcasts contain . 
  `` footy '' is not a term that any one sport owns . 
  in australia , it always refers to either nrl or afl , but even then those are far from the only sports that get to be called that . 
   also , you do n't know as much as you should . 
  you just graduated . 
  i mean , that depends on one 's definition of `` should '' . 
  if you 're talking about it as `` how much you should know as an end-goal '' , then yeah . 
  but if it 's `` how much you should reasonably expect to know at this stage in your education '' , then it 's quite possible they * do * know as much as they should . 
  ( it 's also possibly that they completely blundered their way through uni and * really * do n't know as much as they should . 
  from what we 've seen here , it 's impossible to say . ), 
  she comes sometimes at need . 
  but never on your lead . 
  to meet with her is jolly . 
  to push her may be folly . 
  when our dm gave us that ( on a non-blocking puzzle ) , it took us until we were chatting in our down time after the session finished before we solved it . 
  admittedly we were n't concentrating on it the whole time * during * the session , but it was at least at the back of my mind and i was mulling it over for that time . 
  aye , that 'll do it . 
  the original answer was just `` luck '' . 
   i think feats that let you make a couple of unique items, 
  umm ... we 're you paying attention to * this * ua ? 
  feats that lock out others from being able to do things through roleplay are bad . 
  i think crafting needs an entire system dedicated to it . 
  a feat is n't nearly enough . 
  i do n't think many people play with downtime in the strict mechanical way it 's written up in the phb and dmg . 
  yeah i agree . 
  it felt very un-5e to me . 
   it pigeon holes you in to a specific weapon, 
  i do n't see this as a problem at all . 
  it makes sense that a character would specialise in a particular weapon type . 
  that 's how most people play most of the time , anyway . 
   it 's one of those obvious choice feats, 
  i do n't think it 's a problem * per se * . 
  if i fight with a spear , it kinda makes sense that i 'd put effort into gaining mastery with it . 
   these are strictly better than an existing `` master '' feat we have already : polearm master . 
  agreed . 
  that 's problematic . 
   i 'm a big fan of giving you more options to use with feats, 
  i do n't agree . 
  i 'm with mearls on this . 
  there 's no reason that just because you have a mark on your character sheet that says you have a feat , that you would suddenly be able to attempt things that others ca n't do at all . 
  there are certain exceptions to this , especially regarding techniques with a particular weapon that require a great deal of training ( the feat represents that training ) , but more general obvious things that can be attempted through flavour should n't be locked in to * requiring * the feat . 
   he also talks about +1 bonuses being simple , but believe me , the average player will forget this . 
  we were trying to get away from all of these little bonuses - we do n't need to reintroduce this . 
  so , ** so ** much agree with this . 
  i think it 's a mark of lazy design , but worse than that , it feels like they 're forgoing the excellent design paradigm that 5e is built upon . 
  forget everything , else , * this * is the key problem that needs to be addressed . 
  i think that 's the place for bonus actions though . 
  that 's what they other similar abilities ( like in the spear 's feat ) did . 
  making it a reaction seems necessary because it forces the player to decide win advance whether they 're going to be defensive that round or look for a chance to attack . 
  but i wish they had some other way to achieve that effect . 
  using a reaction up on your turn not in response to a specific trigger is weird design . 
  i agree regarding burglar . 
  mearls mentioned that it 's something that gets used so often that it 's a fine feat as is . 
  well i do n't know how he runs games , but i can count on one hand the number of times i 've seen a thieves ' kit used at all . 
  and this lacklustre feat certainly is n't going to change that . 
  nope .
