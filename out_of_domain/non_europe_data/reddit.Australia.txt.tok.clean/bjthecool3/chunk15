  the truth is , calling either ` fascist ' , including newscorp , is simply namecalling and you are foolish for doing so . 
   the coalition is a fascist government . 
  holy fuck you 're ignorant . 
   i do n't watch the drum , but almost every time i do see it its full of right wing fucktards from sydney . 
  i am referring to their online platform , called ` analysis and opinion ' ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/thedrum/ ) . 
  if you had any sense of media bias you could tell it is a leftist opinion piece platform . 
  that was for export of steel-making coal . 
  sounds terrible tbh . 
  no , it 's a small fine . 
  you do n't have to vote , you just have to show up to get your named ticked off . 
  it 's not an inconvenience .

  if you want more daylight , change your own schedule . 
  do n't force everyone to change the time for you . 
  nope , wa has voted 3 times in its history about adopting dst , and every time dst has been rejected by the people . 
  of course . 
  about half of all coal exported from australia is used to make steel . 
  some idiots like to think banning coal export is a viable option but steel continues to be a vital material in the modern world . 
  fuck the melbourne cup and fuck the vics . 
  seems like a good idea , first nz , now the uk . 
  both countries have similar laws and culture so why not ? 
  holy fuck thanks for that, 
  tl ; dr so much better than the eu . 
  ew , sovereignty is overrated , right ? 
  fact is , it is different from everywhere else , like all nations , and it has every right to consider itself special and not want to be a part of the bureaucratic shitshow that is the eu . 
  no no no , everyone knows marijuana is a miracle drug that cures ebola, 
  someone has a very warped view of what good weather is ... canada habitable ? 
  here 's the thing . 
  you said a `` jackdaw is a crow . '', 
  is it in the same family ? 
  yes . 
  no one 's arguing that . 
  as someone who is a scientist who studies crows , i am telling you , specifically , in science , no one calls jackdaws crows . 
  if you want to be `` specific '' like you said , then you should n't either . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  if you 're saying `` crow family '' you 're referring to the taxonomic grouping of corvidae , which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens . 
  so your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people `` call the black ones crows ? '', 
  let 's get grackles and blackbirds in there , then , too . 
  also , calling someone a human or an ape ? 
  it 's not one or the other , that 's not how taxonomy works . 
  they 're both . 
  a jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family . 
  but that 's not what you said . 
  you said a jackdaw is a crow , which is not true unless you 're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows , which means you 'd call blue jays , ravens , and other birds crows , too . 
  which you said you do n't . 
  it 's okay to just admit you 're wrong , you know ?

  where is the big show !, 
  26 , no injury . 
  yeah fuck better representation and democracy . 
  new zealand does n't have a constitution but there is provision for nz to join in the australian constitution . 
  all they 'd have to do would be to ratify the australian constitution to become a state . 
  more like australia dodged the bullet . 
  if new zealand was a state it would easily be the poorest state and require subsidisation . 
  than *, 
  and why ? 
  just find another supplier of fuels, 
  great tit . 
  fuck the dancers, 
  the scorchers one ? 
  crowval *, 
  mad kiwis downvoting lol . 
  truth hurts . 
  well done sa . 
  all class , all the way, 
  well done sa . 
  all class , all the way, 
  same thing . 
  the butthurt is off the charts . 
  maybe this idiot would get it if he did n't use a map that cut asia in half . 
  das kapital is a criticism of capitalism , so no . 
  sue them ? 
  for what ? 
  yes . 
  uh oh , did i offend a communist ? 
  do n't worry , socialism will work next time . 
  the glorious revolution is just around the corner , just like santa is real . 
  and run over the dude ? 
  maybe the driver was waiting for him to come to the side of the car to make driving off easier . 
  no , in these nations you do n't have to vote .
