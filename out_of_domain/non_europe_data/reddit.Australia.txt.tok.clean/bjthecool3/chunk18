  you 're almost as stupid as / u/boundaryrider, 
  his doubters are idiots . 
  you do n't get to # 1 by fluke . 
  he is by far the best batsman on either team . 
  dirk wants some drama . 
  ca n't listen to grandstand anyway , with gerard whateley and his horrid voice and commentary . 
  best in the world, 
  lyon is shit , how dare you insult our lord like that . 
  they showed a better angle and it was n't very close . 
  apart from gerard , yeah . 
  including gerard , definitely not . 
  where is big show ? 
  well done voges . 
  fuck spds is good , holy shit . 
  awwwwwwwwwgh omg smith making me moist . 
  ** big show big show **, 
  siddle, 
  maxwell as a batting allrounder . 
  jackson bird if not siddle . 
  siddle, 
  maxwell as a batting allrounder . 
  faulkner . 
  jackson bird . 
  happy o'keefe is on the selector 's radar . 
  hopefully he replaces lyon ( i know they wo n't drop lyon , but i can hope ) . 
  glenn `` big show '' maxwell . 
  better fc record , younger , and in good form . 
  he played fc cricket for yorkshire for a bit this year and did pretty well . 
  pretty unfair to never give him a go because he misses fc games due to national short-form commitments . 
  it 's a good system . 
  yeah there are some things it does n't take into account , but i think it 's pretty fair overall . 
  big show should be given a go ahead of smarsh , 100 % . 
  averaged 55 in county this year , is younger , has a better fc record , and is in good form in the shield . 
  left-arm spinners in test cricket ( from top 100 bowlers list ) :, 
  bill johnston, 
  johnny wardle, 
  shakib is rated higher than vettori : http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/playercomparison/test/bowling/?graph=rating&amp;name=vettori&amp;name2=shakib&amp;name_selected=2172&amp;name_selected2=0&amp;name_selected2=6740, 
  left-arm spinners in odis ( from top 100 bowlers list ) :, 
  the icc official rankings . 
  less fallible than a biased nzer 's list , i assume . 
  the rankings are based on an algorithm that takes into account a number of different statistics . 
  unbelievable how overrated tendulkar is by so many clueless indians . 
  nah , / u/dennisdoescricket is . 
  probably why the sunday times says ` cheap and nasty ' :, 
   johnson 's wages as a replacement player would be just $ 2000 per match , but the scorchers can sweeten the deal by giving him a longer , back-ended contract or potentially adding a special marketing component paid outside of the salary cap . 
   the retired test star would not be allowed to officially sign as a replacement player until the call-ups are confirmed by the australian selectors , but he could begin training with the scorchers before then . 
  oh fuck , i just realised . 
  if perth win , scorchers are the hawks of the bbl . 
  voges = hodgler confirmed . 
  fucking vic bias strikes again . 
  i believe they mean england ( dukes ) and india ( sg ) . 
  but since the video was made , the west indies have switched to dukes , making it 7/10 test playing nations who use kookaburra balls . 
  ` poor hard pitches ' ? 
  australian pitches are hard , that 's the way it always is . 
  the ball does n't usually go out of shape on australian pitches , so i highly doubt pitches have anything to do with it . 
  ^ exactly this . 
  good to see a fellow big show ( pbuh ) and sok fan . 
  the video description has the translations . 
  the video description has the translations , so i do n't see the problem . 
  i do n't see spds * or * his prophet big show ( pbuh ) . 
  it 's not a fc game , so records do n't count . 
  yep , definitely . 
  which one ? 
  i did n't know which website you meant . 
  i assume you mean this one : http://fantasy.bigbash.com.au/ ? 
  if you create a league , i 'll join it , 
  op made one , in case people see this thread : http://fantasy.bigbash.com.au/?p=index&amp;not_logged_in=true&amp;group_code=197436, 
  the code is 197436 . 
  note to anyone joining : it 'd be nice if everyone named their fantasy account the same as their reddit username . 
  i liked ponting 's a lot . 
  probably because i 'm a ponting fan though . 
  the first test 's pitch was a road , but the second and third were fine . 
  but even the first test 's pitch at least deteriorated quite a bit by day 5 . 
  i highly doubt it would be a factor . 
  the second test of india vs south africa had a pretty similar looking pitch to a uae one . 
   what do you think ? 
  sad that glenn `` big show '' maxwell or mark cosgrove were n't given a game instead . 
  shaun marsh is a good player and should be in the australian team , but for odis and t20is , not test matches . 
  but if you pick , say big show as a batsman , his bowling does n't count , and vice versa ... right ? 
  or do you get every player 's points ( batting and bowling ) regardless of which slot you pick them in ? 
  fuck yeah , good job, 
  great shot by dave there . 
  it was n't put down , it did n't really carry . 
  it was a pull shot ... 
  captain westraya and his nervous marshes to win the game for australia , you heard it hear first . 
  caught behind for 35 . 
  captain westraya is down !, 
  we 're fucked !, 
  the marshes at the crease for a tense test run chase , this is hilarious . 
  maybe you 're colourblind . 
  thanks m8, 
  bowling and not chucking is one of the fundamental things that make cricket what it is . 
  it would be stupid to let cheats like narine and ajmal off just because they destroy batsmen , based on the false premise that the balance between bat and ball is tipped towards batsmen . 
  what about that lyon is consistent but not great , and that o'keefe one of the best bowlers in state cricket and has a much better fc record ? 
  thanks for these threads mate , they 're a good place to have all the records on hand at once . 
  pretty sad that the sa series was cut from 4 to 3 tests . 
  they have been the best contests in recents years . 
  also why the fuck is sutherland backing 4-day tests . 
  well , he has the most wickets of all time . 
  nowhere near the best though , not even close .
