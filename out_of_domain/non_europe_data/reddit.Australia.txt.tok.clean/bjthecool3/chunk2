  must have *, 
  more than *, 
  also check out http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/a=4/c=gptxg3kuasa/forums.ws?321,322,100,64303155 if you have n't already . 
  yeah there are quite a few around , like sparc mac , chris archie , etc. 
  i quite like bidoofed . 
  i exposed a mistake , and now you can learn from it ( look up the uses of ` than ' and ` then ' ... even some native english speakers seem to not know ) . 
  if i was writing in a second language , i would greatly appreciate being corrected , so that i could learn . 
  i do n't understand why you 're mad . 
  that is the point of the abyss ... you 're meant to be risking death in exchange for fast xp rates . 
  are you seriously complaining about people pking you in the wilderness ? 
  if you have linked your account to amazon , it instantly adds to your runescape account . 
  there is no need to enter any codes . 
  for me , as soon as the purchase was confirmed , the membership was added to my rs account . 
  it could be possible you linked the wrong rs account to amazon ? 
  did it prompt you to log into your rs account during the linking process ? 
  i 've never heard `` i could care less '' , only ever `` i could n't care less '' ... and you 're right , it does n't make sense to say the former when you mean the latter . 
  where have you heard `` i could care less '' ? 
  too * coincidental, 
  ` too ' is an adverb , ` to ' is a preposition . 
  you do know that the standard english 2nd person plural personal pronoun is ` you ' though right ? 
  do you just use ` y' all ' on the internet because you think it sounds better or something ? 
  fair enough , just curious . 
  dae think everyone hates the usa cause they 're jealous of how free we are !, 
  americans are so persecuted !, 
  maybe next could be a `` past glories/glory days '' comic about who had the best ( and worst ) empire at their peak and which country has always been downtrodden ? 
  you 're comparing a school bully fight to a metcop incident ? 
  do n't you think metcops should act a bit more responsible than schoolkids ? 
  `` rooftop agility was just released and storylines presumably in the form of quests of famous npcs are coming soon to 07scape . 
  when i first heard this , i loved the concept , but it was n't until i listened to the youtube post again that i realized this was going to only be in old school . 
  why ? 
  why !, 
  sorry -- almost lost it again ... '', 
  if you like that update , then suggest it for rs3 . 
  it 's irrelevant to old school what happens to rs3 ... are you saying that the osrs updates should also be given to rs3 ? 
  you have to understand that the polls for osrs are on player suggested content and are voted on by the players . 
  rs3 content is a separate issue . 
  they are separate games . 
  `` if jagex wants to make these games independent and two different dimensions , that 's fine , but the old school players should have to pay for it , it does n't have to be 5 bucks . 
  whatever the cost is that 's fair , whether it 's another dollar or two is reasonable . '', 
  what the fuck , now this is quite absurd . 
  the osrs team is very tiny compared to rs3 ... it 's like 4 guys , whereas the rs3 team is 50 + . 
  and you 're suggesting people who want to play osrs should pay more ? 
  it 's clear you 're just angry about a few updates that osrs got that you like and now wish it would crash and burn . 
  ok , so you and others have a problem with the rs3 dev team , a separate game to osrs . 
  then why does a noticeable portion of the playerbase ( especially on this subreddit ) wish that osrs would fail ? 
  it seems to me that it is because of childishness and jealously on the part of some , including the op ( inb4 `` oh but they 're mean as well ! '' ) . 
  i mean , wishing for a price increase on the membership fee for osrs is completely unjustifiable , and clearly a case of wishing ill upon osrs , do you not agree ? 
  what 's my point ? 
  : `` wishing for a price increase on the membership fee for osrs is completely unjustifiable , and clearly a case of wishing ill upon osrs , do you not agree ? '' . 
  `` so how about lets not use a few people as an excuse to victimize os since theres just as many if not more people talking shit and flaming rs3 on a daily basis . '', 
  hence inb4 `` oh but they 're mean as well ! '' . 
  again , i do n't care about that . 
  i care about rs3 players talking about osrs ... this entire thread is about the article , which is about an rs3 player whingeing about osrs getting updates . 
  i 'm not on a tirade , i know my comment is n't relevant to your issue with the rs3 dev team , but this thread is about the article . 
  hence , i 'm just curious about if you agree that this article is unreasonable and at least partially because of jealousy of the updates osrs gets but rs3 does n't . 
  not nice of you to be so passive-aggressive though . 
  but oh well . 
  prime ministers are heads of government . 
  the head of state for denmark is their monarch . 
  fucking hell , the circlejerk has gone full reverse . 
  anything remotely related to religion is met with '' * tip fedora * i 'm so funny guys i can make fun of atheists !, 
  '' , and '' / r/atheism is leaking am i rite '' ? 
  because the entirety of reddit should be moral god-loving christians , while the atheists should be kept in their corner on / r/atheism , right ? 
  and yet you assumed this person was a subscriber of / r/atheism . 
  that 's my point ... this stupid '' / r/atheism is leaking again hur durr '' is said in response to any talk about atheism , seemingly just to have a little circlejerk about how you 're so much better than atheists . 
  it has nothing to do with / r/atheism . 
  that 's just the excuse . 
  its *, 
  the article 's title even had correct grammar ... and you decided to change it for some reason ? 
  no it does n't . 
  the apostrophe is there to show it is a contraction of `` it has '' or `` it is '' . 
  `` its '' ( no apostrophe ) is a personal pronoun like `` hers '' or `` his '' . 
  you do n't write `` her 's '' or `` hi 's '' , so why do you write `` it 's '' when you mean `` its '' ? 
  at least one reason that the bob inventory is separate so that you know which items will be dropped if the bob runs out of time . 
  for austzealand , it 's more like being dedicated mainly to trying to be as different from the uk as possible , not the us . 
  as long as they do n't bring viv ... 
  ` could 've ' , not ` could of ' . 
  ` could/should of ' is never correct grammar . 
  yep , i have no doubt that india 's continuing refusal to use drs is harming world cricket . 
  since it 's in adelaide , if you do n't get any responses here , you could try / r/adelaide as well . 
  why does that matter ? 
  sure they are being withdrawn , but they are still legal tender ... so what is your point ? 
  what ? 
  the barmy army bring a lot of life and passion to cricket matches . 
  do you seriously get annoyed at `` you all live in a convict colony '' and their other chants ? 
  they are clearly light hearted/humorous . 
  do n't be so serious ... 
  it was n't a draw , it was a tie . 
  but a lot of kiwis probably view it as a loss . 
  question 2 : 83 % of people voted `` everyone needs to see the same formula '' . 
  question 3 : 54 % of people voted `` allow players to choose which formula they see '' . 
  ... are n't a lot of people contradicting themselves here ? 
  [ maaate ! ], 
  i 'm no dirty dole bludger !, 
  a dole bludger is someone who does n't bother finding work and deliberately lives off of centerlink payments/unemployment money . 
  our shithouse current affairs tv shows , today tonight and a current affairs , love a good dole bludger beat-up story . 
  a dole bludger just is n't true blue !, 
  i thought it was quite an enjoyable quest . 
  i did it a few days ago for the first time and it did n't take that long and the dialogue was very entertaining . 
  it would have been annoying as hell in the past when there were no run-energy , resting , and lodestone updates , but not so much in 2014 .
