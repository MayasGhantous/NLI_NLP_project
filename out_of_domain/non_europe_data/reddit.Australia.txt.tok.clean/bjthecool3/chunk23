  what a fucking name , mason crane . 
  why the fuck did they pick boland . 
  at least richardson , paris , and hastings have good list a records and deserve to be picked . 
  boland is shit . 
  really ? 
  i thought they were world t20 favourites ? 
  i just checked the odds , and they are . 
  why would you pick head or lynn in odis ? 
  just on t20 form ? 
  that is silly , there is the matador cup for a reason . 
  their list a records do n't warrant selection , let alone selection over david warner or susan koala . 
  mckay i definitely agree on . 
  it robs guys who have performed consistently at domestic level and sends a poor message . 
  pretty sure they 'll have different squads for different formats . 
  boland by far . 
  but he 's good . 
  the scorchers lost paris , smarsh and mmarsh , and the stars lost faulkner , boland , hastings and big show ( pbuh ) . 
  so it 's only fair :p, 
  ** big show big show **, 
  chris rogers is shit , he needs to be fired . 
  well done big show ( pbuh ) . 
  big show ( pbuh ), 
  he 's the world 's best test spinner , not odi spinner . 
  great thread mate , appreciate the effort to do these . 
  it 's going to be hard to change aus 's current odi batting squad for t20is . 
  the changes i can see happening are lynn in for susan or gb . 
  no , not really . 
  i 'm getting tired of people caring so much about the pitch though . 
  good bowlers build pressure regardless of the pitch . 
  77 vs 51 is pretty damn good . 
  very few sides will ever have consistent success home and away . 
  what your analysis tells us is that australia is a pretty good team . 
  vernon philander followed by dale steyn, 
  clint mckay was very good though . 
  when he was dropped from the team he was ranked no . 
  9 in the world . 
  at one point he was ranked no . 
  4 in the world . 
  why would you compare them ? 
  and you 'd be an idiot . 
  dave rightfully dropped him . 
  williamson had a go at 3 and sucked there too . 
  he should n't have been in the xi in the first place when you have dale steyn , moises henriques , eion morgan and david warner instead . 
  at least watto deserved his spot with good domestic performances . 
  i do n't even get why it is stigmatised by some people . 
  i feel sorry for big show ( pbuh ) when people criticise him for using . 
  what 's wrong with the reverse sweep ? 
  he certainly deserved selection and was hard done by to only get 3 tests . 
  kp is an irritant . 
  sack this helmetted cunt . 
  holy fuck, 
  do n't blush baby, 
  pete nevill you beautiful man < 3, 
  the best t20 batsman in australia is dave warner . 
  the best t20 batsman in australia is dave warner . 
  no he 's not . 
  averaging 33 with a sr of 142 , leading t20i runscorer for australia , how is he overrated . 
  the best t20 batsman in australia is dave warner . 
  he 's the best man in the country for determining who bowls the heaviest balls though . 
  mel buying junior a drink confirmed . 
  \\ #don ` tblushmark, 
   i 'd pick finch , smith , maxwell and bailey ahead of him . 
  why ? 
  can you at least explain how he is ` overrated ' if his record is better than any other batsman ? 
  yep , pretty obvious . 
  he 's a great player full stop . 
  big show for test team . 
  essendon is soon to be my second team . 
  miss you crowley < 3, 
  maybe shit bowlers . 
  are you honestly saying that bowling quality makes no difference in t20s ? 
  because that 's 100 % bullshit . 
  i 'm obviously talking about the internationals in the squad you fuckwit . 
  we 've had so many better bowlers than lillee and thompson since they retired . 
  and australia . 
  he 's captained australia in a t20i . 
  like toastysnack said , they have n't had two great bowlers in big vern and dale steyn due to injury . 
  you should n't underestimate this loss . 
  he 's played over 100 tests and is still available for selection . 
  bird should be in the test xi , i really hope he gets a go , especially in nz . 
  that 's a phony autist . 
  he was ranked one of australia 's best ever fast bowlers at his peak , he definitely was a world-beater at one point . 
  fuck yes dave . 
  hope he does well here to cement his place in the odi side . 
  also why do they care so much about dave 's bat ? 
  susan koala uses a very similar one and no-one talks about it . 
  in fact the actual weight of his bat is n't even over 3 pounds . 
  look mate , these modern players are all dog shit . 
  back in my day real batsmen batted with toothpicks that weighed 1 gram . 
  but so is everyone else 's . 
  fucking great *, 
  being a fantastic test player does n't automatically translate into odis though . 
  great stuff davey , make it a big one . 
  someone take him out the back . 
  fuck tubby , do n't jinx the dave double . 
  infinite mmarshes more like . 
  the big-hitting , heavy-ball-bowling , clean-striker-of-a-long-ball 's innings is finally over . 
  ** big show big show **, 
  drop lyon from the test side and play big show at six and 4 pace bowlers , that 's the dream . 
  wade knows how it is .
