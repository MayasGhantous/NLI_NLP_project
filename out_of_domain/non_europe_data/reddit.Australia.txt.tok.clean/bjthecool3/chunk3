  if you just breeze through quests and treat them as a chore , you 're guaranteed to not enjoy them . 
  another massive issue is that with the eoc they made the corrupt versions of revenant armour equal to tier 20 equipment . 
  wtf were they thinking ? 
  it was fine when it had a shorter degradable time but the same stats . 
  now we have something equal to steel armour , but it has a 15 min degrade time and a price of millions on the ge . 
  it makes absolutely no sense at all . 
  people saying `` wow that 's great ! '', 
  contribute just as little/much as a negative opinion . 
  and yet people are very downvote-happy to those with a differing opinion . 
  more like :, 
  australia : `` it 's australia day ! '', 
  aboriginal nation : `` you mean * invasion day * ! '', 
  `` also calling people christian just because they disagree with you is n't a good way to argue . 
  unless you 're just role playing rome , if you are doing that please go outside you need another hobby . '', 
  i do n't disagree with you , but heaps of people role-play as their country all the time here . 
  heaps of us-americans do it , even . 
  i do n't see what is wrong with that . 
  `` currently void has little to no use in game and we can all agree on that . '', 
  ... erm , can we ? 
  i do n't agree . 
  if you want high dps armour and you ca n't afford nex armor , it 's pretty good . 
  and it 's good for low-level people until they get bandos/armadyl/subjugation . 
  i do n't see why it needs to be buffed , it seems pretty balanced atm . 
  in that case then you 're over the top . 
  i really ca n't see how you think she might be pre-pubescent , or anywhere near under 12 . 
  since eoc has introduced dual wielding and buffed 2h weapons , there is a new way to increase damage output . 
  this automatically makes shields less desired . 
  i ca n't see how you 'd make shield more widely used for things like slayer other than removing or nerfing dual wielding or buffing most monsters . 
  what do you suggest/expect when you say `` buff shields '' ? 
  because , like meentz said , unless they make shields reduce a ridiculous amount of incoming damage , dual wielding will always be favoured . 
  oh fuck off you pissweak umpires , checking the front-foot no-ball with the 3rd umpire every second dismissal . 
  at its * finest, 
  it 's = contraction of ` it is ' or ` it has ', 
  its = personal possessive pronoun , like ` his ' or ` her ' . 
  no-one here has any proof that it is because of ddosing , and yet everyone is adamant it is . 
  could 've / could have * , not ` could of ' . 
  ` could/should of ' is never correct english . 
  i 'm just trying to help you improve your english ... no need to be so rude . 
  affected * by bots . 
  affect is ( usually ) a verb , effect is a noun . 
  its *, 
  its = possessive, 
  it 's = contraction of ` it is/has ', 
  i agree with him on the pitch aspect . 
  the pitch in the first test had quite a bit of uneven bounce , which complimented mitch 's aggressive bowling style . 
  stop caring about that . 
  seriously . 
  stop giving a no-name attention . 
  lol . 
  dude . 
  destiny 's people had hardly any effect on anything . 
  a nobody who some paranoid people think is having some huuuuge influence because he had a livestream going earlier and was directing his fans to do his bidding . 
  in reality he and his followers had very little effect on anything . 
  not enough snow . 
  `` willy willies '' are just dust devils though , not tornadoes . 
  english does n't have grammatical gender either . 
  ` a ' and ` an ' are n't grammatical gender indicators - they are just used based on whether the next word starts with a vowel sound or not , like ` thy ' and ` thine ' . 
  `` backwards system '' ? 
  the house of lords is a backwards system , but not the monarchy . 
  many countries have a powerless monarch as head of state -- are norway and the netherlands ` backwards ' ? 
  its * asshole, 
  its = possessive, 
  it 's = contraction of ` it is ' or ` it has ', 
  wtf ? 
  australia is one of the most capitalistic countries in the world . 
  what planet are you living on ? 
  why does everyone here hate ncn ? 
  great yorker ncn !, 
  warner seemed troubled by spin ( jp duminy ) in south africa , so if ajmal gets him early i would give pakistan a good chance of winning . 
  lol , it 's funny how you got downvoted for this . 
  lots of mad canadians in this thread . 
  what ? 
  hogg has a bad game and suddenly domestic t20 form means nothing ? 
  the haters are all eastern-staters jealous of our iron ore, 
  than *, 
  lol starc . 
  great ball . 
  fuck hastings and behrendorf , but i definitely agree on bird . 
  illiteracy *, 
  how the hell was that first ball not a wide ? 
  big show, 
  epic six big show, 
  all hail big show, 
  noooo big show, 
  uh oh ... party 's over now . 
  nope , we 've lost it now . 
  we need 46 off the last 5 overs . 
  going at quite a slow ` cruise ' . 
  yep , no chance now . 
  easily 70/30 in favour of pakistan . 
  game over 2 overs ago . 
  it looks like you offended a few finch fans ... 
  lol . 
  more like our bowling . 
  as if . 
  shit game all round for us , would be all out for 120 if it was n't for the big show . 
  we simply gifted too many runs to pakistan , and having a chucker on your team always helps . 
  our batting was n't what lost us the game . 
  our shit bowling = their win . 
  i know ... did you mean to reply to genui ?
