  just look at the icc player rankings . 
  there is no difference . 
   the rankings do n't take into account , how easy it has been to bat on aus pitches recently, 
  yes they do . 
  look at the methodology . 
  the pitches in the ind vs. sa series were not minefields apart from nagpur , do n't be so hyperbolous . 
  voges is a much better test batsman than kohli , i do n't know how you can pretend otherwise . 
  that 's not a nice thing to call modern art :(, 
  waleed aly , a revered clown-man . 
  he needs to fuck off . 
  good , they did n't drop finch and davey is at 4 . 
  poor watto being dropped . 
  i wonder if this xi is what they think is their best or they 're just trialling someone ( mmarsh ) and resting watto . 
  moved to 4 to make room for susan . 
  it 's only 12am in bestern australia . 
  lol , i want finch to keep being a t20i beast to see how long he can be rated the best / close to the best in the world for people to still say he 's shit . 
  yeah it 's a t20 , just go fuckin ' hard davey . 
  big show ( pbuh ) to the crease ... 
  i might prefer him to come in after mmarsh at this stage tbh . 
  lol good start ncn, 
  yes coulter you beast . 
  they had a big profit actually , did very well . 
  first-half , that is : http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-23/qantas-profit-rises-234pc-to-688-million-dollars/7191572, 
  yeah most of the airlines are loving the oil price crash . 
  yep , out . 
  what a throw davey , great speed . 
  no they 're not , that 's what they 're actually called . 
  they debuted in the bbl though . 
  no need to waste time putting the stumps back in . 
  * heavy ball *, 
  good catch . 
  i thought the captaincy was fine . 
  hazlewood might come in for tye , which could be an improvement . 
  tye has a great domestic record , boland does n't . 
  that 's the difference . 
  boland was hated on because his domestic record was quite mediocre so his selection had less merit . 
  that would be par , not well . 
  one good innings does n't mean much , so i do n't know what that adds . 
   voges has n't been challenged much so far in his very short career , and when he has , he has n't had great success ( ashes ) . 
  voges ' 130 on debut was challenging and dug aus out of a hole . 
  and i would n't bring up england if you are trying to talk up kohli ... 
  burns squared up by boland and caught behind . 
  the waca is seaming with good bounce , definitely a bowl first pitch . 
  mark waugh said in commentary last game that they want everyone in the squad to get 2 games this series . 
  therefore there will be a fair bit of rotation . 
  you are circle jerking over a strawman . 
  ** big show big show **, 
  was too nervous and behind by 5 mins to look at the match thread :'| . 
  ** big show big show **, 
  well , not really . 
  the trends are useful and the career rating graph gives a good overview . 
  obviously you have to account for players like narine not being able to bowl for the time being , and people like him can take a while to drop off due to what you say ( few games played ) . 
  well , of the current team . 
  but starc and cummins are still above him , and watto is equal . 
  faulkner and ncn are close behind . 
  ncn is only lower because he 's missed a large proportion of recent games . 
  yes , it 's on the side bar below `` upcoming international calendar '' . 
  something to note is that each player gets 10 points if their team wins , which should be taken into account if you ca n't decide between two players on opposing teams but one is from a team more likely to win . 
  averaging 17 with the ball after 16 matches , he is doing well for himself indeed . 
  but india is now even more dominant at home . 
  to beat them in india recently has been a massive task . 
  overall india is a good team due to this . 
  1 ) sort of similar to last wt20 . 
  50/50 to get to the semis but likely to crash out at that stage . 
  strengths : a good batting lineup and some good allrounders , experience in india . 
  weaknesses : definitely the bowling , missing the two highest rated bowlers in starc and cummins and still do n't know who are in the best xi . 
  inexperienced spin bowlers . 
  2 ) india . 
  3 ) australia , ranked 6th . 
  better than sri lanka and pakistan and have a number of players with good domestic records and experience in the ipl . 
  most likely super 10 qualifiers : afghanistan and bangladesh . 
  5 ) it 's a short tournament with short games that matter a lot in terms of progression through the tournament . 
  so it should be entertaining . 
  i wonder what the commentary team will be . 
  it 's in the `` how to play '' section . 
  correct . 
  it was covered on the back with what was basically a sticker , it was for decoration essentially . 
  the mcc still banned it . 
  lol , i would n't put it past them . 
  there is also a league on the sidebar ( league name : r cricket, 
  password : 1587 ) . 
  also the name of an amazingly good band , tame impala . 
  yes the stump pulling . 
  i have n't seen the stump removed like that forever . 
  cricket law porn . 
  if you 're enough of a fuckwit to let your cat wander the countryside like that , that 's your problem . 
  man , the pitch block is already looking tired , and the tournament just started . 
  is is used for state games a lot ? 
  why the fuck do people get their knickers in a knot about appealing ? 
  it is just asking a question , the umpire can then shoot you down or not . 
  i wonder why this match has zing bails and the ones yesterday did n't . 
  it used to be very dodgy and he admitted to wearing sleeves and bending his arm before the crackdown on illegal actions . 
  recently i do n't see how people can really claim he chucks though . 
  3 different cases , what the fuck ? 
  you got three separate call-ups just by chance ? 
  it 's because he 's shit . 
  well obviously it was dodgy when he was experimenting with that different action , which is an answer to op 's question . 
  that 's why some people might think he 's dodgy , because for a short time he was . 
  icc world t20 2016, 
  yeah , i thought smith 's 200 at lord 's should 've won pretty easily .
