  yep , that 's almost guaranteed at this point . 
  people questioning the legitimacy of his injury and trying to find a way to infer that it is to do with drugs . 
  including robbo on 360 . 
  thanks tubbs, 
  yes stevie i love you . 
  goal review was standard procedure , and the 50 was there . 
  there is a massive sound in the west of the town . 
  and it is fantastically entertaining to watch . 
  yeah , from what i saw . 
  bog by a fair way : https://twitter.com/aflplayerrating/status/734306001814355968, 
  career-best game for him ( all games since 2010 ) . 
   p.s. 
  on a slightly related note does anyone know what the small differential in free for vs frees against are the only thing i could come up with were free kicks against runners as they would n't be counted towards an individual player . 
  a gold coast runner has given away 2 free kicks this year so you may be on to something . 
  the afl ratings account for what you do with the ball -- he scored high on fantasy points because he got a lot of touches , but did n't impact the game as much as that indicates . 
  1 test batsman : smith, 
  he got a pretty cute cake to go along with it haha : http://www.cricket.com.au/video/steve-smith-birthday-guyana-function-west-indies-australia-south-africa-tri-series/2016-06-02, 
  happy birthday steve < 3, 
  the lord was presented with a well deserved cake : http://www.cricket.com.au/video/steve-smith-birthday-guyana-function-west-indies-australia-south-africa-tri-series/2016-06-02, 
  yep , it is quite in-depth , and is partnered with champion data . 
  more info can be found on their twitter page and this pdf : http://www.afl.com.au/staticfile/afl%20tenant/afl/playerratings/playerratings_how.pdf, 
  the team of the year is based on an average of this year 's player 's ratings points only . 
  the overall afl player ratings is based on a weighted average of ratings points over a maximum of 40 games , over a moving 2-year time period . 
  the end result is here : http://www.afl.com.au/stats/player-ratings/overall-standings, 
  apeness in !, 
  get hyped !, 
  haha same here . 
  where is the evidence that williamson is a superior batsman against swing than his competitors ( root and smith ; kohli is unproven/a failure ) ? 
  that he made a hundred in england when it was cloudy ? 
  cloud cover is n't even proven to be a significant factor for swing and is quite likely an old wive 's tale/widespread cricket meme . 
  steve smith has a double and a hundred in england against the same bowlers under similar conditions . 
  it 's not the ` flatness ' . 
  england has plenty of featherbeds of their own anyway . 
  it 's the hardness/abrasiveness , which results in more bounce/pace and less seam . 
  anyway , i do n't see the need in the first place ... the australian domestic fc competition has plenty of juicy seamers as it is , and the kookaburra swings very well ( just ask dale steyn ) . 
  the really foreign conditions for australian fc batsmen are subcontinental turners . 
  on that front at least the scg exists , and the national cricket centre has some spin-friendly practise wickets ( http://www.cricket.com.au/news/australia-cricket-preparation-subcontinent-pitches-spinners-okeefe-agar/2016-06-02 ) . 
  i watched every williamson innings on the recent nz tour of england and the same for smith . 
  if you 're going to just claim that you subjectively think smith made runs when it did n't swing and williamson did then there 's no point having a discussion . 
  smith 's 200 at lords was on a fast pitch against anderson and broad with the dukes ball and he was imperious . 
  and his hundred at the oval was in seaming and swinging conditions under cloud cover , if that 's all you care about . 
  smith is much better than root and williamson , the stats obviously back it up and i just do n't see why you claim williamson is much better player of swing/seam . 
  williamson has made plenty of runs on flat uae wickets and on nz featherbeds . 
  he has done well in england and at home but not to the extent where he is obviously better than smith in those conditions . 
  heck , he failed thrice in green conditions in nz against australia ( who do n't have as good a seam/swing attack as england ) just recently . 
  but some people just make their mind up , often in the case of smith vs. williamson it is for superficial technique reasons ( / u/boundaryrider comes to mind hehe ) , and stick to it , despite their respective batting records mostly telling the story . 
  we 'll just leave it there i reckon . 
  i thought that was broad ? 
  very well deserved , he was the highest rated rising star eligible player against richmond a few weeks back ( https://twitter.com/aflplayerrating/status/734000281248104448 ) and has strung together a couple of more good games , i love the way he goes about it . 
  he was second best on ground against richmond two weeks ago and deserved it over petracca ( https://twitter.com/aflplayerrating/status/734000281248104448 ) and was again good against the saints ( https://twitter.com/aflplayerrating/status/736493380570513408 ) . 
  this is just reward for three great weeks . 
  worst on ground . 
  afl player ratings team of the year at round 11 : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ckqd-vwuyaazqwp.jpg, 
  anthony morabito, 
  what the fuck , why do people hate cyril ? 
  he is a much better player than betts , betts is a downhill skiier compared to rioli . 
  because those three are having better years than eddie betts . 
  much better in tackles/forward pressure , better in contested possessions/marks , inside 50s , and accuracy . 
  at the end of the day , cyril rioli is a much better player , and that is shown by the fact betts is n't in the afl ratings team of the year ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ckqd-vwuyaazqwp.jpg ) and is lower in the overall rankings ( http://www.afl.com.au/stats/player-ratings/overall-standings#position/medium_forward ) , which is the best statical measure of the game available . 
  he pushed him with an open hand iirc , obviously nothing in it . 
  such a bummer , first game since 2014 and he breaks his collarbone . 
  lol no they 're not , before round 11 he had the [ 2nd highest agregate afl player ratings points ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cjwrjinuyaalcug.jpg ) , what are you smoking ? 
  uglier version of lachie weller , good player though and getting better , a good pick up by the saints . 
   just curious do you have any idea how these ratings are judged ? 
  it is a fairly extensive system that works on an algorithm with access to champion data 's very detailed stats . 
  you can read more about it [ here ] ( http://www.afl.com.au/stats/player-ratings/ratings-explained ) , [ here ] ( http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-04-26/player-ratings-frequently-asked-questions ) , [ here ] ( http://www.afl.com.au/staticfile/afl%20tenant/afl/playerratings/playerratings_how.pdf ) . 
  what i can say though is that it emphasises things like contested ball , efficacy of ball use and metres gained , and does n't really care about bulk disposals if they 're not damaging/don ' t set up a scoring play . 
  thus people like sam mitchell and lachie neale are n't rated as highly as nat fyfe or marcus bontempelli . 
  its only real weakness is its poor measurement of shutdown roleplayers ( not that any other system does this well either , because you ca n't measure negatives as easily ) , but it does account for details about spoils and intercept marks so still gives a good account of key defenders imo . 
   was looking at this one and would n't have expected apeness had a better game then fantasia . 
  is it based purely on how well they do compared to their average or what ? 
  nah it has nothing to with a player 's past games , that comes into it in the rankings , which are weighted over the past 40 games ( http://www.afl.com.au/stats/player-ratings/overall-standings ) . 
  if apeness did a few positive things and nothing really negative he can still very easily be rated higher than fantasia , who may have kicked a goal but probably also turned the ball over or shanked a shot at goal , which would incur negative points . 
  the actual system that measures players ' games ( and that produces the individual game graphs ) is called the equity ratings , which is then compiled into the actual rankings of players/accumulation of points over the ranking period . 
  np mate , thanks . 
  happy with clarke and smith as they 've been going well for peel , though not sure if hannath deserves selection or even if he is needed . 
  yep , believe it or not , total goals is just one factor that goes into judging a player . 
  glad i could help . 
  cloke was worst on ground last week ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ckkmybfugae5ai2.jpg ) , seriously he is shit/really out of form now , you 're off the mark saying he 's a scapegoat . 
   cloke was by far not the worst collingwood player on the weekend, 
  understandable given how bad he was last week . 
  lol geelong . 
  and people make fun of port for being proud their sanfl flags ... 
  geelong has a much better midfield , one of the best in the game . 
  north melbourne have a beastly ruckman but their midfield is nowhere near selwood , dangerfield , guthrie , caddy , blicavs . 
  the graph is from the afl player ratings ' twitter account , https://twitter.com/aflplayerrating . 
  shaun hampson, 
  currently rated the best small forward in the game : http://www.afl.com.au/stats/player-ratings/overall-standings#position/medium_forward, 
  lachie whitfield, 
  tom liberatore, 
  sam docherty, 
  tom cutler, 
  he still needs to play a game in the tsl when he 's delisted to make it all 5 . 
   unfortunately gecko 's senior coach and his assistants simply did n't turn up to the afl , federal government and victorian office of multicultural affairs and citizenship-funded exercise, 
  and, 
   9 clubs, 
  sounds like a vic only thing , so i doubt it 's brisbane . 
  yes, 
  yep , one of the best defenders in the comp this year , really important to the giants ' rebound to attack . 
  fuck i hate how much sicily ducks .
