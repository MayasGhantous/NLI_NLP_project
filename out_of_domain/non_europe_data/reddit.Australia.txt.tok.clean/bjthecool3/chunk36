  someone should make him earn it , break his jaw . 
  he needs to learn a lesson . 
  sicily is one of the game 's biggest duckers . 
  and somehow lindsay gets all the attention . 
  sicily does it way more than thomas . 
  sicily has done it blatantly every game he 's played this year . 
  he should be being roasted in the media by now , like lindsay was for much less . 
  sicily 4th most high-tackle frees this year . 
  much bigger ducker than thomas . 
  hipwood has a nice kick . 
  lol, 
  what a beautiful man . 
  fyfe wearing glasses . 
  what the fuck, 
  the review system is the most pointless thing of all time . 
  if you ca n't overturn on clear evidence like that you may as well stop wasting everyone 's time . 
  would rather try and get some sort of pick for him to help get mccarthy . 
  would n't mind if he stayed though . 
  obviously . 
  but irrelevant . 
  riots over a non-mark ? 
  best player to miss out on selection ? 
  what player from your team will be the next to earn a selection ( that has n't already ) ? 
  michael walters, 
  basil zempilas was a ruckman for west perth . 
   matthew pavlich ( fremantle ) -- the captain turned back the clock to shelve any retirement talk for this week at least , his four goals helping freo to a third win on the trot . 
  the captain ? 
  nope . 
  haha so it has !, 
  everton weekes in the crowd , what a beast !, 
  because violence against women is the zeitgeist of the moment . 
  you 're right , it is just political and is reaching hard . 
  ** heavy ball **, 
  ** big show big show **, 
  nuke victoria . 
  bontempelli is much better than merret though . 
  fantasy points are no where near as in-depth/meaningful as the afl player ratings . 
  i think you 'll find bontempelli is rated a lot higher than merret on that system . 
   rein the bats in and gayle , ab de villiers , brendon mccullum , virat kohli and joe root will still be batting superstars but the rank and file will be kept in check . 
  the names he chose seem completely random , and he made no attempt in the article to provide evidence for his assertion . 
  another rubbish article by an old coot adding nothing of value to the conversation . 
  amla is the better odi batsman but as you said , kohli has age on his side . 
   edit : since your deluded with your afl ratings system , this is the actual stats for this season for comparison ( career is pretty similar ) http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_player_compare?playerstatus1=a&amp;tid1=8&amp;playerstatus2=a&amp;tid2=6&amp;type=a&amp;pid1=3921&amp;pid2=3943&amp;fid1=s&amp;fid2=s, 
  i thought you just said you were joking that merret is anywhere near bontempelli . 
  but you 're actually serious ? 
  comparing shallow stats on a table does nothing . 
  the afl ratings use stats from champion data which as i said , are much more in-depth . 
  but if you are still joking well , very funny . 
  nothing . 
  yet i 'm still disappointed . 
  i was sort of amazed that it was named the best innings of 2015 though . 
  smith 's double at lord 's was against a much better bowling attack and was much more comanding , and both set up wins for their sides . 
   really interesting that it was still given best innings of the 2015 by cricinfo when you consider that . 
  i was sort of amazed that it was named the best innings of 2015 .

  no more of a road than the one that williamson made his double on , in which he had more reprieves , and where he was facing a far inferior sri lankan attack . 
  smith 's innings was far better . 
   and do n't forget that kanos scored more and stayed not out, 
  pretty irrelevant , by the time smith had got to his double he had set up australia 's innings and was just going the slog . 
  that includes mediterranean climate , which in my opinion is the best climate in the world . 
   nah smith 's double at lord 's was first innings on the flattest of deck 's, 
  no more of a road than the one that williamson made his double on , in which he had more reprieves , and where he was facing a far inferior sri lankan attack . 
  lol , c'mon now . 
  it 's bowler friendly for the first day , then flattens out massively . 
  and it was against sri lanka , not broad and anderson . 
  so what makes it an innings even near smith 's ? 
  well , it 's still a part of europe . 
  just not the eu . 
  wow, 
  you 'll only be let in if you accept steven peter devereux smith as your lord and saviour . 
  i miss gazza ballance :(, 
  who the fuck is this james vince clown ? 
  if gary was n't dropped the uk would n't have left the eu . 
  more like after a decade of tanking and general patheticness , melbourne 's coaches are finally getting something out of its list . 
  why did they light the well on fire here ? 
  lol, 
  bontempelli followed by wingard . 
  dylan fucking shiel oh my word, 
  lol i loved that . 
  you could see selwood drop his knees at the last second to no avail ... was polaxed and no free paid . 
  good umpiring . 
  saints playing fantastic footy . 
  haha get stuffed enright !, 
  fuck i love bt . 
  so much better than mcavaney . 
  there 's no difference . 
  rankings are affected game-by-game . 
  why was n't that mark paid ? 
  hawkins is such a clown . 
  omg what a game !!, 
  game of the year . 
  3 - dangerfield, 
  2 - weller, 
  i thought he was immense and keeping them in the game . 
  scott pendlebury, 
   football is so much about tactics . 
  perhaps more than any other team sport . 
  uh , what ? 
  just because soccer is boring as sin , does n't mean it must therefore be more about tactics . 
  two meter peter to tom lynch .
