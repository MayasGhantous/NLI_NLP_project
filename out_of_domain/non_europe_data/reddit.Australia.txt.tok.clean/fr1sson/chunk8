  btw if you put a # at the start of a line on reddit , it turns it into a title . 
  edit : one last idea , do you have `` microsoft update '' ( settings -  updates -  advanced ) turned on in windows update ? 
  has it patched your office suite to the latest version ? 
  does your desktop have integrated graphics ? 
  have you tried disabling the graphics card and testing with internal graphics ? 
  honestly , it 's pretty bad . 
  nobody i know uses it . 
  there are much better alternatives . 
  perhaps it 'll get some use when integrated properly with the new 365 groups feature . 
  great , well at least we 've isolated the second problem to the graphics card . 
  i suspect rmaing or calling support for the graphics card might be worthwhile , as you 've apparently tried everything with drivers , that only leaves the 2d processing part of the card being potentially damaged in some way . 
  perhaps a pcmark benchmark could verify ... 
  are # 1 and # 2 still both happening on your laptop ? 
  do you speak arabic ? 
  is the laptop still having # 2 also ? 
  i think # 1 might be one for office 365 support . 
  there 's a bunch of things it could be , but it would be much easier for a support person to help you with it . 
  how is a rich demagogue spewing anti-democracy rehetoric , hatred of minorities , and slogans promising to be ' a great man ' leveraging ` friends in industry ' * not * a fascist ?? 
  that 's not just the definition ; it 's the stereotype of a fascist . 
  this is a sales tax ... 
  east-west tunnel . 
  if you 're removing all the level crossings , does n't that reduce the need for rail multiplication ? 
  can you get a different job ? 
  seems to me the cost of transport and increased rent would make any cbd student job almost redundant . 
  unless it 's a particularly appropriate or well paying student job , you 'd be better off in berwick/officer . 
  the only one i 've ever heard is swinnies , or `` i 'm at unimelb '' . 
  rmit students always seem to try to either avoid the name of the institution , or spit it out as quickly as possible followed by an avid attempt to justify going there ... 
  _ which uni do you go to ... _, 
  '' ^ ^ ^ rmit ^ ^ you ^ know they have a great arts programme , and the ** lecturers ** are ** really good !!, 
  ** ^ ( it 's actually pretty hard to get in ... ) '', 
  yeah , man , swinnie . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  got a party this saturday , wan na come ? 
  the university of melbourne , australia . 
  ^ ^ ^ look ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ me !, 
  ^ ^ i 'm ^ smart !!, 
  yup . 
  victorai univserity, 
  lol . 
  honestly it makes so little difference once you leave uni . 
  people have a way of finding their level . 
  personal growth ( despite what they tell you at school ) does n't have end when you leave campus . 
  it 's all just different forms of the insecurity of youth , but it 's quite funny to watch it all play out . 
  do n't . 
  any os vendor using wordpress for their website is probably not one with a secure distro anyway . 
  wordpress is fine for small stuff , but i mean an os vendor should have a team focusing on vulns , and that includes distribution attack vectors . 
  wordpress would definitely be the weakest link in the chain from that perspective . 
  not something they should have had to learn the hard way . 
  nah , that 'd be umbraco . 
  this thread ? 
  reddit is a software company that hosts the sixth most popular site on the internet - an open source community platform . 
  gawker media is a media company that hires `` journalists '' ... 
  this is akin to comparing facebook with the ny times . 
  it says `` do n't turn left '', 
  beef broth , or stock made with stock cubes ? 
  many of those cubes are vegetarian ... 
  your software stinks . 
  if you ca n't handle a * simple * change like that ... 
  your software stinks . 
  from what you 're describing i would not be surprised to find your backups are broken , you have no source control , no databases , no service orchestration , no database , no management , no security , no queues , no anything . 
  it 's an extremely straightforward customer requirement . 
  you 're complaining about csvs ? 
  csvs and ini files - seriously ? 
  you 're providing this as a service ? 
  and even then ... you could n't even grep for their mailserver ? 
  the customer is not the problem here ... 
  ah , for some reason i assumed you were a saas provider . 
  fwiw your software still sounds absolutely terrible ... and customer support attitude not much better . 
  it would probably be pretty embarrassing for your company if their name turned up here . 
  the aldi 85c bread is amazing . 
  coles/woolies are nowhere near as good for cheap garbage . 
  nqr for the peanut butter . 
  also , box of migoreng . 
  not broke , just have two brothers who are students . 
  perhaps the lebanese authorities will keep them . 
  i would n't want to see us `` waste precious government resources '' getting them back ... 
  # [ plutonomy ] ( http://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-1.pdf ), 
  respectfully , this is an extremist viewpoint . 
  it 's revisionist , selective , and not based on a holistic understanding . 
  it goes against 1400 years of tradition , and is nonsensical on its face to a learned muslim . 
  shamaa-il tirmidhi has an entire * chapter * called `` on the description of the joking of rasulullah [ ] ( / swt ) '' : http://www.inter-islam.org/hadeeth/st35.htm, 
  yasir qadhi himself has basically responded to you here : http://www.muslimcentral.com/yasir-qadhi-guidelines-humor-joking-islam/, 
  but more generally your attitude is problematic . 
  it is better to correct a brother in in islam by suggesting improvement and ask questions with politeness and timidity . 
  you may need to re-examine the fundamental motivations that brought you to your belief . 
  it might be valuable to meditate on your motives , and see if they themselves can be made more worthy of the religion of allah . 
  well , if it were a catamaran ... 
  that . 
  amazing !, 
  they both have different traits , each of which are suitable for different roles . 
  both are good . 
  it 's too qualitative ... you ca n't say one is objectively better . 
  each have their strengths and weaknesses . 
  dinesh has a better handling on the engineering discipline as per the academic definition , and is clearly better educated . 
  this is useful because large computational systems are complex and need to be modelled and planned correctly and neatly ( e.g. 
  putting the differencing engine in the right place ) . 
  gilfolyle is more of git ` er ` done style hacker/optimizer ( e.g. 
  punching holes through walls ) . 
  in a small start-up , and when dealing with the realities of hardware , that is also part of `` good engineering '' in the real world . 
  dinesh would be a good cto/cio , gilfoyle a good coo/it manager .
