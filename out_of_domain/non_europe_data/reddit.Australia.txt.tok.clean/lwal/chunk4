  rvp was also a few years younger ... 
  yes , but the key word is ** 2 ** , so sure these ** 2 ** new players might have scored more than one but you 'd expect that from these ** 2 ** replacements, 
  this is actually the best ( or worst ) one i 've read so far . 
  some of the others are funny because they are so bad . 
  this one is so bad it transcends the others and is just plain bad . 
  if you do n't have lambert get lambert, 
  i 'd say benteke and lukaku are on about the same level but otherwise the others are just too inconsistent for me , although lambert does have two hard fixtures coming up . 
  for his price perhaps remy is a better option if he gets consistent game time but otherwise i 'd take lambert over the competition . 
  if we were to sell per i 'd want someone better and younger than ashley williams to replace him , but it does seem like a possible transfer as you said, 
  iggy please, 
  if you 're into camping deep creek ( 30 mins from victor harbour ) is a great place to spend a weekend with beautiful scenery and good camping spots . 
  otherwise ki or the flinders are also great options if do n't mind the longer drive/boat trip . 
  arsenal would go undefeated the whole next season, 
  dat logic, 
  judging by the amount of downvotes in that thread i 'd say theres more than just a ` few ', 
  i personally reckon it 's going to be a nationwide sport by then , almost completely eliminating rugby . 
  also i reckon it has a fair chance of taking off in nz which would be great for the game, 
  i 'm talking about the game thread in general , more butthurt bulls fans there than fat kids at a candy store, 
  they 're the closest thing to it but at the same time that team still had 3 all stars ( chauncey , rip and ben wallace ) on it while the nuggets still do n't have a player who is quite at that level ( although an argument could be made for ty and iggy ) but have a far deeper bench . 
  faried 's block tonight on westbrook tonight was pretty mad as well , great game from the nugs, 
  you should bring in leuenberger in your ruck instead of o'hailpin, 
  edit : also put goodes into your defence and get rid of 1 of the 2 power defenders , neither of them have very good job security, 
  i 'd get rid of rioli as he 's ** way ** too inconsistent . 
  maybe go for a cheap lecras or preferably try to upgrade to rockliff . 
  put varcoe in your forward line for dwyer and bring in viney in your midfield . 
  currie isnt guaranteed playing time so i 'd try to upgrade him to lueunberger if possible . 
  you might want to downgrade schoenmakers to pittard as they 'll probably both be scoring much the same this year so may as well go for the cheaper option who will go up in value more . 
  finally i 'd personally upgrade ziebell to a premium as he 's an awkward price but if you think he 's set for a breakout year go ahead . 
  how the hell is dane swan at 21 . 
  he 's definitely a top ten , probably even a top 5 player . 
  also matthew boyd way too far down the list . 
  where are the sixers fans ? 
  only 1 in the whole thread so far, 
  gold coast better be ready to get raped, 
  oh wait on ... 
  any hd streams ? 
  should do the job , cheers , 
  * it 's boner time !, 
  but is he really any better than koufos ? 
  i 've personally felt that the team tends to play far better when koufos is on the floor than javale, 
  no way , there have been plenty of games this season where giroud could have won the game for arsenal with an easy , clear cut chance but he just was n't skilled enough to finish it where just about any world class striker would have put it away with ease , that 's the difference you 're getting when you sign a big name striker . 
  if arsenal is wiling to shell out the money than jovetic is a very realistic option and a very good one , he should fit in well with arsenal 's style of play, 
  cisse just is n't good enough for arsenal if we want to be a top club . 
  david villa in my opinion is too old unless we can get him at a bargain price, 
  benteke just is n't what the gunners need right now , as op said too similar to giroud, 
  higuain would be amazing but unrealistic , ca n't see real letting him go, 
  come on nugs lets finish this , despite the ridiculous umpire calls we 're still in this, 
  ama request : collingwood fan with 2 or more teeth remaining, 
  the bulldogs are so bad they would n't make the 8 in my local auskick league, 
  you should go for the saints , great club which makes the top 8 ( finals ) more often than not and are pretty much always competitive . 
  although there 's been a bit of controversy surrounding some of our players in recent years we have a great fan base while not being a bandwagon team by any means . 
  also after a coaching change that occurred at the beginning of last season we play a very offensive-based game which you seem to like . 
  got ta go with cazorla , the man 's on fire and arsenal 's gon na be desperate to get this win over reading, 
  obviously lillard will improve in the coming seasons , but to say he is one day gon na be the best in the league when you 've got players like durant , irving , wall , davis and harden , who obviously have far more potential , is just plain bonkers, 
  sorry but kyrie is definitely putting up better numbers this season . 
  kyries 23 ppg on 46.6 % fg , 5.7 ast , 3.7 trb and 1.6 spg is ** far ** better than lillard 's 18 ppg on 43 % fg , 6.6 ast , 3.2 rpg and 0.9 spg . 
  also lillard is closer to being 2 years older rather than 1 and all of this kyrie does with a far worse team around him . 
  to say that lillard is a better player or even compares to kyrie at this stage is just crazy, 
  go and take your negative attitude somewhere else , we 're one of the bloody biggest clubs in the world , of course he would consider an offer if we made one, 
  i 'd love to see strootman on the side , great player and arsenal just does n't seem right without at least 1 dutchman, 
  solid win for the nugs , great to see fournier getting some game time and showing what he can do, 
  cricket might n't get as many spectators to the games or as many tv viewers as its not really much of a spectators sport but there are at least twice as many people who play cricket over the whole of australia than any other sport whether its socially or at a school or club level . 
  i 'm sorry but soccer is nowhere near to being a number sport over here . 
  cricket , rugby and afl are a long long way ahead when it comes to attendance , tv viewership and participation rates . 
  actually as / u/nattyredd pointed out below soccer is the most popular sport in ausralia , participation wise , which surprised me as i would n't call it the biggest sport in australia so maybe participation is n't as an important factor as i thought . 
  either way i guess you 're right , cricket is n't the biggest sport in australia :(, 
  hmph , fine . 
  i still would n't call soccer the most popular sport over here but it appears evidence is to the contrary, 
  i lost all respect for him when he did [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geazr2xrahs ) and still went through with the wicket even though he clearly knew what he had done . 
  his actions since certainly have n't caused me change my mind about him either . 
  amazing shot by bosh , but it should never have been a game winning shot , disgusting call by the umpire on cole, 
  yes but this poll will have absolutely nothing to do with whether or not there will be fluoride in our water or not , it was just an mp posing a general question to see what the public 's view on the area is . 
  comparing it to politicians using facebook polls to decide on whether or not to go to war is just stupid . 
  i used to love watching herschelle gibbs play , one of the most fun players to watch who could send just about any bowl over the ropes for six . 
  nowadays it would have to be kieron pollard in the limited overs formats and hashim amla in tests ( how can you not love that beard ? ), 
  interesting that brett goodes has n't been playing afl before now considering what he showed on the weekend , it certainly looks like he has the talent level to be a great player for the doggies, 
  i really do n't understand whats going on with khawaja , did he sleep with a selectors wife or something ? 
  i 'd argue to say it 's one of the best in the nba , do n't know what you 're complaining about, 
  but you can only speak swahili to humans, 
  the ability to cure any disease instantly, 
  richmond should be counting themselves lucky that after their first opening-round win since '08 they 're finally starting off the season higher than 9th, 
  go for the underdogs !, 
  can many teams afford having a player worth 10.9 missing two crucial gameweeks , one of which is a double gameweek for some teams ? 
  i 'd say if you do n't have cazorla and gerrard on your side definitely bring one of them in , otherwise maybe hold although i would n't . 
  time for chandler to step up big for the nugs , especially in the next few games without lawson, 
  i 'd say pretty damn good compared to making the finals only once since '95, 
  you do n't fuck it up ? 
  so the 70 point belting by the lions in your last appearance was n't fucking it up ? 
  sid meiers pirates !, 
  who would n't want to be a swashbuckling cruising the caribbean in search of treasure ? 
  / r/todayilearned is basically a monthly recycle of the same content . 
  the subreddit has so much potential but sadly there is barely any original content in there . 
  i personally reckon there should be a no down-voting system . 
  if it 's a bad post or nobody agrees with it , well it 'll still stay down the bottom and does n't disrupt the good content because no-one will upvote it . 
  if it 's a post that 's controversial though , it will still go high enough for someone who is casually browsing the comments to see and provides them with an opportunity to see an opinion that is different from the average redditor 's . 
  at the moment though if your opinion is at all unpopular , even if there may still be plenty of people who agree with you , it will be downvoted to oblivion for nobody to see unless if they choose to sort by controversial , which not many people do . 
  * do it !, 
  do it !, 
  the amount of downvoting in threads recently is incredible . 
  it seems as though any statement that is n't popular with the whole of / r/nba is instantly gets downvoted to oblivion .
