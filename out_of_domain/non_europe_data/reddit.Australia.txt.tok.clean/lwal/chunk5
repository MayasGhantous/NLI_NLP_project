  i do n't think you have to be indian to find curry delicious . . 
  please tell me you have a dash cam in your car, 
  no , because that 's a completely different scenario . 
  the teacher beating off behind a locked door harms absolutely no-one and he had no intention of harming anyone . 
  murdering someone not only involves killing somebody but it also involves the intention of killing someone . 
  two completely different scenarios , but you obviously ca n't comprehend that . 
  of course its illegal but so is jaywalking . 
  i 'm not saying that what the teacher was doing was n't a bad thing but it is clearly not on the same level as murder and anyone who thinks it is needs their head examined, 
  if sagna leaves the minimum i see us signing is a rb , a defensive mid and a striker , no matter what . 
  the worst case is that these new players are all young , unproven and from smaller leagues and the best case is that we sign players like strootman and jovetic , but no matter what i see us signing players in these three positions . 
  got ta go with a rhino . 
  1 ton of solid muscle and bone , surrounded by 2 inch thick protective skin , a massive horn on its nose all while being capable of charging at 25 mp/h . 
  this thing would dominate any other animal in the arena , slaughtering all challengers who thought it would be a good idea to attack the mighty rhinoceros . 
  its not the most essential position that needs filling at the moment , but at the same time i think that if this club wants to take its game to the next level and win a major trophy then yes , we need a new goalie . 
  chesney is far far too inconsistent and has cost us quite a few crucial games and conceded plenty of goals that would have easily been stopped by a top 10 goalkeeper . 
  why should we get the pressure that melbourne 's getting ? 
  we 've been a top team in the competition for the last 5 years , making the grand final twice . 
  sure we 're no longer as good as we once were as we 're an aging squad who 's starting to rebuild but we 're still competitive and turn up to games as evidenced against richmond last week . 
  we lost to the gold coast in extremely humid conditions without two 2 key defenders and with gary having the game of is life and suddenly we 're in the same state as melbourne !, 
  what the hell were the bucks thinking trading harris for reddick , its not like jj is going to be getting any better and the bucks need young pieces to build around , not a middle aged shooter who wo n't help at all to bring the team out of mediocrity . 
  magic pulled off a great trade there . 
  considering gordon 's contract and attitude i 'd say that if you guys get a decent offer from another team for him you should definitely take it, 
  the tooth fairy visited collingwood yesterday and now she 's as broke as the port adelaide football club, 
  larry bird was without a doubt the best of all time , just watch this if you think otherwise : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rto2_oyvs0i, 
  mehmet okur would probably still be able to put up decent numbers in the nba . 
  rudy fernandez was n't too shabby a player either, 
  this is a sledging thread not a circlejerk thread, 
  he 'll definitely play the first game with walcott , wilshere and rosicky all unlikely to play . 
  second game is impossible to tell , it 'll probably depend on is performance in the first and the fitness of that midfield trio, 
  if you see a stray port fan at the game , please guide them to the local centrelink as they 're clearly lost, 
  why would you say that our chances of winning a series is small ? 
  even without a healthy lawson i can still see us easily beating the warriors in 5 or 6 . 
  fair enough , yeah our chances of upsetting the thunder/spurs have seriously decreased with losing gallo , but i would n't count us out completely just yet, 
  this is gon na be a wipeout ... 
  that was definitely robert on the phone the whole time . . 
  dude ... it took you 20 years to realise that ? 
  that 's the point , even with the easy qualification we are struggling to qualify ... 
  nsw/act :, 
  ** b ** : brent staker , phil davis , dean terlich, 
  ** hb ** : matt suckling , sam gilbert , tom young, 
  ** hf ** : isaac smith , taylor walker , luke bruest, 
  ** r ** : hamish mcintosh , kieron jack , daniel cross, 
  ** int ** : justin koschitzke , dylon addison , lewis roberts-thompson , anthony miles, 
  not the best team but should be able to beat qld, 
  i picked my list from [ this ] ( http://www.aflnswact.com.au/index.php?id=253 ) website so i do n't what what they consider to be nsw/act players but i 'd assume it 's correct . 
  yeah , mike pyke would be a good option if you consider him to be from nsw , better than kossie anyway, 
  would be interesting to see what it 'd be like to play in , nice to see an old piece of memorabilia like this making its way back to the club, 
  i reckon the celtics will be able to at least take 1 game off the knicks . 
  also reckon the nuggs should be able to remove the warriors in less than 7 , but that might just be because i 'm biased, 
  i 'll be disappointed if the nugs do n't make the conf . 
  finals . 
  we should * hopefully * be able to blow by the warriors in 5 or 6 . 
  i also like our chances against either the spurs/lakers , ca n't see a kobe-less lakers being able to keep up the the nugs style of play and the spurs have been in a bit of a rut lately ( although that will most likely change come playoffs ), 
  if we make the conf . 
  finals i 'd give us a 1/2 chance against the thunder ( we dominated the season series ) and the grizzlies and a 2/3 chance against the clippers if we were to match up against them . 
  at the moment its got ta be dallas . 
  they 're never gon na get rid of dirk and i do n't see marion going in this offseason either . 
  they do n't have any young pieces to build around in the future and at the moment are the definition of mediocrity and probably will be for the next couple of seasons unless they have a complete overhaul . 
  they need to clear out mayo , kaman and probably collison and try to trade for some young pieces/lottery picks unless if they can somehow pick up a star free-agent ( howard/paul ), 
  i reckon i 'll just have to flip a coin and choose based on that , they 're average is just too similar : /, 
  well they both have about the same chances of winning come september, 
  hey look , a power fan learnt how to count !, 
  whats next , collingwood supporters visiting the dentist ? 
  so you do only have two !, 
  i love how your way to respond in a hostile manner was to bake cupcakes , passive aggressiveness at its best, 
  the game showed we need faried back on the team for some offensive rebounding . 
  hopefully ( i know its mean but anyway ) lee wo n't come back for another game or two and we can take control of the series . 
  good to see lawson playing back at an all-star level again as well . 
  must-win match for adelaide if they want to prove that they 're still a finals quality side , should be a good one, 
  if he 's out for the series and faried comes back , the story on the boards should be * very * different for the rest of the series hopefully . 
  even if faried does n't come back straight away , a lot of pressure will be taken off chandler which is great . 
  yeah it sure is a strange start to the season , probably by the bye rounds things will have cleared up though . 
  i do n't understand whats going on with the crows or the eagles either , both are quality sides on paper and its not as if any of their key players are heavily under performing . 
  it 'll be interesting to see if they can turn it around in the next few matches, 
  especially as it 's a home game we should be fine without him . 
  i 'd rather him become fully healthy and rest until the warrior 's home games when he 'll be needed more, 
  got ta go with the cats , they 're due for one as they 've won it every second year since '07 and judging with their current form i see no reason for that not to continue , especially with hawthorn 's hoodoo whenever they play them . 
  like him as a player , hate him as a person, 
  i personally felt that show dropped off quite a bit after the first season or so and the episodes became repetitive . 
  despite this it had a ton of potential and tim roth is a great lead actor . 
  i 'm surprised nobody has mentioned the inbetweeners yet . 
  three season and a movie just did n't seem like enough to me . 
  when you 're only playing once a week i do n't see why the flight time should matter , but it 'll be interesting to see if the afl can build up a fanbase in nz, 
  what do you call three sheep tied up to a post in new zealand ? 
  a brothel, 
  if it were to stay an 18 team competition i 'd say that melboune would be the first to go unless if they can get out of the hole they 've dug themselves into but i 'd say it would turn into a 20 team comp and maybe perth/tassie will get a new team . 
  i really hope you guys are here to stay , i mean you guys would have a pretty decent fanbase if it was n't for your pisspoor team at the moment . 
  i 'd personally rather see a 20 team league and give tassie a team , that way everyone 's happy, 
  in the afl you get a weeks break between games though , plenty of time to travel and recover from any jet lag that may have incurred during the flight, 
  this would be a great idea but i just do n't think the current talent pool is large enough to support 22 teams without a significant decrease in the quality of players across the league . 
  unless if afl can really take off in nz/nsw in the next few years i do n't think that this will be a viable option for some time . 
  if sagna is out do you think wenger will buy in a replacement or make jenkinson our starting rb ? 
  if we 're including injury prone players then bogut should be on that list ahead of hibbert/pekovic, 
  every year is the same with the nuggets , think something special is going on until the first round of the playoffs hit ... 
  nuggets will be lucky to survive another game . 
  we 're looking absolutely terrible , just like every other year when the playoffs come round . . 
  hey !, 
  do n't give up just yet , in 2011 we 'd only won one game after 7 rounds and we finished 6th overall so there 's still a small glimmer of hope , especially with west coast and adelaide playing so terribly this year .
