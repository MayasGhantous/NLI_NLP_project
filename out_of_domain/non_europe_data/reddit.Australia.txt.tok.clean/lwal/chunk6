  he used to be brilliant back in 09/10 as well , that off-field drama really put him off his game, 
  compared to many other players on our squad at the moment i 'd say hes one of the players that 's least infuriating , although i will admit that he has dropped far too many easy marks in his time, 
  after our performances so far this series i really do n't think this is the best team in nuggets history , even if our regular season record says otherwise, 
  he 's looked absolutely terrible since the first game , i 'd even rather hamilton or stone on the floor than him , at least they wouldnt chuck up some of the miserable shots millers been taking . 
  if nuggets somehow pull off a win in the oracle i ca n't see them losing game 7 with the confidence that an away win will give them . 
  hopefully karl will learn from his mistakes and not play miller so much and keep iggy on curry as well . 
  go away, 
  `` going back to arsenal ? 
  it could happen at any moment , ** but i do n't want to think about it ** , '', 
  judging by the end of that statement i would say that he 's less than interested in coming back . 
  wikipedia says 53,500 which is a bit disappointing in my opinion considering its only a bit over 2000 more than aami ... 
  that thing is the biggest waste of money and electricity i 've ever seen , produces barely any water for the cost . 
  surely building a new reservoir would be a far more efficient way of producing fresh water for adelaide, 
  yeah certainly not complaining about the development , aside from the capacity it seems as though its going to be a great stadium in a great location . 
  nice to see that they kept the hill as well . 
  never helps a team when they lose their coach for an away game , especially a young side like port adelaide . 
  hopefully it does n't affect them too much and they can still make it a great game in tassie . 
  i 'm not so sure , aside from germany the us do n't have very many powerful allies in this scenario which may play against them . 
  what did the collingwood supporter give his son for christmas ? 
  your bike, 
  a hard working port adelaide supporter has just purchased his dream car after years of saving up . 
  as he is on his way home his tyre bursts . 
  he pulls over , jacks up the car and starts wrestling it off . 
  as he gets the wheel off , a tinted 4x4 flies around the corner and pulls up behind him . 
  two collingwood supporters step out of the car and smash the port adelaide supporter 's window in . 
  the port adelaide supporter jumps up and starts yelling , ` what the feck are you guys doin !? ', 
  the collingwood supporters reply `` dont be a greedy cunt , you get the wheels , we get the stereo '', 
  josh j. kennedy , gary ablett and ollie wines, 
  [ here ] ( http://www.vipboxsports.me/aussie-rules/151999/2/adelaide-crows-vs-hawthorn-hawks-live-stream-online.html ) you go mate, 
  this is exactly what should be happening , the afl is n't an amateur league as you said and thus should n't be having amateur part-time umpires officiating the game . 
  as you said the afl has far too strong a grip on the sport for a contending league to ever be successful in any way and so any changes will need to come internally , preferably starting off with removing demetriou . 
  what was he thinking !? 
  he misses more games than he plays through injury , no need to go get yourself suspended first game back . 
  as a saints fan i have mixed feelings as hes been at the club a long time but he never seems to put any effort in on the field and is a liability whenever he gets the ball . 
  i 'd personally like see one of our younger players given a go and kosi calling it a day but he always seems to be always picked despite his near-permanent poor form so perhaps he 'll play again . 
  answering your question , absolutely nothing . 
  its not as if he 's a role model for the young players to look up to even , considering his on-field work ethic . 
  there really is n't any reason for him to be on the team now that its pretty much confirmed we wo n't be making the 8 and are in full rebuilding mode . 
  gws ca n't even get 10,000 to their games as it is , why would you want to give sydney another team when the people there obviously do n't like afl while you 've got people down in tassie who absolutely love the sport and would actually appreciate a new team . 
  fair point , but you 'd assume that if they had their own team which most of the population went for they 'd get at least 15-20 thousand to a game in hobart ( this is assuming that hobart 's stadium would be redeveloped to a larger capacity ) , considerably more than a third sydney team would get considering that the swans themselves barely get 25k to a game . 
  teams would only play one other team twice as there are only 22 games in a season ( and a bye round ) . 
  i guess that would be kind of good in a way as it leaves room for both a home and an away game against a teams main rival . 
  i guess it depends entirely on whether the afl can convert rugby fans , which is going to be hard to do ( despite the footy being the obviously better sport ) and until they do the crowds at games would be sitting at 4 figures for a fair while . 
  the afl already has a massive fan base down in tassie ( for the population ) which in the short term would no doubt bring in larger crowds and be a considerably safer option financially ( as well as the tasmanians being more deserving of a team ) but as you said there would n't be much room for growth . 
  i 'm just saying that there are only 22 games a season currently , not 23 as each team has one bye a season thus why there 's 23 rounds but not 23 games . 
  what did the female carlton supporter call her 5 sons ? 
   james , james , james , james , james, 
  how did she tell them apart ? 
   she just called them by their last names, 
  what do you call a collingwood supporter who has an abortion ? 
  a crime fighter, 
  and there i was wondering why jeremy howe has such a good mark, 
  i still think trengove , watts and grimes can all become good players as well as they 're only 21 , 22 and 23 respectively , but other than those three or four up and comers the team looks to have a pretty miserable future . 
  getting a bit excited after beating gws are we ? 
  it was nice to see our former dropout kick 10 for you , pity thats all hes gon na kick for the rest of the season, 
  more like the pelicans , new orleans cant even sell out their stadium when the team is doing well, 
  i 'd see absolutely no reason to move your team , if you did n't have such a poor team you guys would be getting better attendances than most teams in the nba, 
  i think he 's a great commentator too , but just not for those big moments . 
  really hope we sign patty , even if he is n't a top player he adds some 3-pt shooting to the team which we really need and provides a bigger morale boost of the bench than just about any other player in the league . 
  no not bill gates , he actually does something useful with his money . 
  make it gina rinehart or some other billionaire who does n't deserve/need their money so much, 
  i 'm surprised melbourne did n't feature , it usually ranks no . 
  1 in those most liveable cities lists, 
  edit : why is this being downvoted ? 
  i 'm not saying that melbourne is a better city just that it usually ranks highly in these kind of things ... 
  no i said 9000 , i 've got standards dude, 
  i wonder if there 's a mental illness where a person is so severely paranoid that they are mentally handicapped and everyone is just playing along with it that they then require medical attention , thus actually making them to some degree mentally handicapped, 
  i think people are underestimating how many superstars there are in this league, 
  the first round would roughly look like :, 
  lebron , durant , dwight , paul , irving , melo , harden , westbrook , curry , wade , aldridge , bosh , rose , george , love , rondo , griffin , parker , lillard , wall , davis , m gasol , d will , horford , noah , bryant , bynum , cousins, 
  even those later picks are still great players and if you pair them up with another decent player from the early next round you 're going to have a decent team . 
  i think it 'd make the league much more even and the main difference between teams would be the coaching . 
  i always imagine some slimy , obese neckbeard slicking back his greasy hair while bending over his semen laced keyboard in a dark basement in his mothers home writing this out . 
  all the while slowly laughing to himself with a cheese-eating grin on his face as he tries in vain to navigate around his rolls of fat to unzip his fly . 
  damn :(, 
  i mean , if you look at it from a different perspective he 's actually the good guy . 
  all he 's trying to do is stop a group of rebels from destroying the perfectly good ( well at least considerably better ) lives of the world 's population from what they will be if the illusion ceases to exist while trying to make a decent life for himself . 
  give him another year i reckon , his offence needs to develop a bit more before he 's all star worthy, 
  not sure how safe this would be , but a small wood fire in the car would be pretty awesome, 
  not wanyama and begovic , neither are ever going to be world-class players . 
  i 'd rather see gonalons/strootman and maybe julio cesar to put some pressure on chesney for the starting position, 
  brilliant, 
  why ... just why ? 
  they could have made artwork with it . 
  they could have rolled in it . 
  they could have filled their pockets with it . 
  they could have done anything but eat it and it would have been less disgusting . 
  if dignity was money , you 'd be in debt . 
  i think i 'll leaf you alone with insults like that, 
  i absolutely hate to admit it but rvp :(, 
  yes !, 
  this guy is a beast and there is a significant lack of dutch players at the club at the moment, 
  probably would 've beaten bradford/blackburn as well and who knows what would 've happened from there, 
  # 22m is n't that far off $ 30m , i 'm sure that if they really want him they 'll be able to strike a deal, 
  well i was n't going to downvote you before but seeing as you provided such a convincing argument , i 'm left with no other option !, 
  do n't worry , according to back to the future its less than 2 years till hoverboards come out, 
  great books that basically anybody will enjoy , you do n't have to be into fantasy to get a lot of pleasure from reading these . 
  do n't feel guilty about that . 
  it ** is ** absolutely horrible that there are children out there who go days on end without eating but at the end of the day a mans got ta eat and if you did n't eat that food it would probably go to waste anyway . 
  just imagine , your puppy was waiting at the patiently door for its daily walk , tail wagging in anticipation .
