i do n't want to cool down your enthusiasm , but please regard that this happened 5 days before the war ended . 
  at this point , germanys army was already unorganized and used children and old men as soldiers . 
  well , as you can see [ here ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/list_of_countries_by_military_expenditures ) , france ( # 3 ) , the united kingdom ( # 4 ) , germany ( # 7 ) and italy ( # 9 ) are already in the top ten of military expenditures . 
  only the us spends more on military than europe , so as long as we do n't see the us as a thread there is simply no reason to spend even more . 
  democracy ! = huge crowd of people, 
  btw , this picture is 7 years old, 
  [ repost ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/i39a2/this_guy_was_the_real_deal ), 
  old article ( sunday , 9 september 2007 ) . 
  such warnings occur from time to time because there are no long term studies on the exposure to wi-fi . 
  `` debt is the slavery of the free '', 
  the classification of the rating agencies is just their opinion . 
  a real default is n't the case before one of the lender demands the money and greece ca n't pay . 
  however , this downgrading would have the potential of a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  but if a drone kills accidentally a lot of civilians while trying to kill one terrorist , the hatred of the people against the us will worsen and therefore there will be more extremists . 
  i 'm from austria . 
  first of all : sorry for what happened . 
  i hate to hear that this man was set free . 
  beside that :, 
   please do not editorialise the titles, 
  the article says nothing about russian gas , though the rumor exists . 
  also , the austrian authorities said , that they asked lithuania to specify the arrest warrant and got no answer . 
  since austria is a state of law and they had not enough reason to hold him any longer , they had to free him after 24 hours . 
  in austria , there is a law , which is called `` verbotsgesetz '' . 
  basically it forbids to say anything positive about the nazis or play their deeds down . 
  irving clearly violated austrian law . 
  as i said , the rumors exists , but you should n't editorialise titles . 
  i must admit , that i simplified the text of the law , but you can read for yourself if you understand german :, 
  while your statement would n't be illegal , it would still be political suicide for any austrian to say . 
  if you would try to justify the atrocities with `` but at least the trains ran on time '' , it would be illegal . 
  you can find the whole text [ here ] ( http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/geltendefassung.wxe?abfrage=bundesnormen&amp;gesetzesnummer=10000207 ) . 
  the law is questioned from time to time , because it is , as you noted , a restriction of the freedom of speech . 
  nonetheless , there wo n't be a majority for the neutralization of this law anytime soon . 
  you also have to see the historical dimension of this law . 
  it was written in 1945 to convince the occupying forces that austria is done with national socialism . 
  btw , we have a political party , whose member get accused of violating this law from time to time . 
  last time they were in the government , [ the eu applied sanctions against austria . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/04/world/a-threat-by-austria-on-sanctions.html ), 
  i 'm from the weinviertel in lower austria and we also have a erdstall in our village . 
  the explanation i heard was that they were used to hide valuable things in case of war . 
  i think this is the most likely explanation , because only natives know where the erdst\u00e4lle are and there have been several conflicts in our regions over the centuries . 
  they are much older than that . 
  read the article . 
  i have n't heard of any . 
  matthew 3,2 : `` repent , for the kingdom of heaven has come near . '', 
  john 8 11 : '' `` go now and leave your life of sin . '', 
   i thought you also had to repent for past sin and make an honest effort to no longer commit any sin . 
  metalsupemacist asked for a reference for that in the bible . 
  would you argue that these two texts are n't reference enough ? 
  israel and its companies develop excellent security software and hardware . 
  it seems so . 
  i really thought it would work . 
  just because i used both doe n't mean they only have this meaning if combined . 
  each of these two would have been sufficient without the other . 
   from two different books written by two ( plus ) different people, 
  he wanted a reference in the bible . 
  the structure and the authors of the bible is n't the topic of this thread . 
  i took snippets because honestly , nearly nobody on this side is ready to read through long texts if it 's just one line that matters . 
  also , i wrote from where i took the snippets . 
  anyone can look up the whole text in an instant . 
  and actually , the point you made with luke 17:4 does n't counter the texts i delivered at all . 
  it shows that your sins are forgiven if you repent , no matter how often you fail . 
  but if you really want long texts with advices/instructions regarding heaven without taking anything out of context , here we go ( matthew 5 ) :, 
  1 now when jesus saw the crowds , he went up on a mountainside and sat down . 
  his disciples came to him , 2 and he began to teach them . 
  the beatitudes, 
  he said :, 
  3 `` blessed are the poor in spirit ,, 
  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . 
  4 blessed are those who mourn ,, 
  for they will be comforted . 
  5 blessed are the meek ,, 
  for they will inherit the earth . 
  6 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness ,, 
  for they will be filled . 
  7 blessed are the merciful ,, 
  for they will be shown mercy . 
  8 blessed are the pure in heart ,, 
  for they will see god . 
  9 blessed are the peacemakers ,, 
  for they will be called children of god . 
  10 blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness ,, 
  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . 
  11 `` blessed are you when people insult you , persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me . 
  12 rejoice and be glad , because great is your reward in heaven , for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you . 
  salt and light, 
  13 `` you are the salt of the earth . 
  but if the salt loses its saltiness , how can it be made salty again ? 
  it is no longer good for anything , except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot . 
  14 `` you are the light of the world . 
  a town built on a hill can not be hidden . 
  15 neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl . 
  instead they put it on its stand , and it gives light to everyone in the house . 
  16 in the same way , let your light shine before others , that they may see your good deeds and glorify your father in heaven . 
  the fulfillment of the law, 
  17 `` do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets ; i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them . 
  18 for truly i tell you , until heaven and earth disappear , not the smallest letter , not the least stroke of a pen , will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished . 
  19 therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven , but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven . 
  20 for i tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the pharisees and the teachers of the law , you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven . 
  21 `` you have heard that it was said to the people long ago , ` you shall not murder , [ a ] and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment . ' 22 but i tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister [ b ] [ c ] will be subject to judgment . 
  again , anyone who says to a brother or sister , ` raca , ' [ d ] is answerable to the court .
