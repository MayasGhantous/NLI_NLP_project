  and anyone who says , ` you fool ! ' will be in danger of the fire of hell . 
  23 `` therefore , if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you , 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar . 
  first go and be reconciled to them ; then come and offer your gift . 
  25 `` settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court . 
  do it while you are still together on the way , or your adversary may hand you over to the judge , and the judge may hand you over to the officer , and you may be thrown into prison . 
  26 truly i tell you , you will not get out until you have paid the last penny . 
  adultery, 
  27 `` you have heard that it was said , ` you shall not commit adultery . ' [ e ] 28 but i tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart . 
  29 if your right eye causes you to stumble , gouge it out and throw it away . 
  it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell . 
  30 and if your right hand causes you to stumble , cut it off and throw it away . 
  it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell . 
  divorce, 
  31 `` it has been said , ` anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce . ' [ f ] 32 but i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , makes her the victim of adultery , and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery . 
  oaths, 
  33 `` again , you have heard that it was said to the people long ago , ` do not break your oath , but fulfill to the lord the vows you have made . ' 34 but i tell you , do not swear an oath at all : either by heaven , for it is god 's throne ; 35 or by the earth , for it is his footstool ; or by jerusalem , for it is the city of the great king . 
  36 and do not swear by your head , for you can not make even one hair white or black . 
  37 all you need to say is simply ` yes ' or ` no ' ; anything beyond this comes from the evil one . 
  eye for eye, 
  38 `` you have heard that it was said , ` eye for eye , and tooth for tooth . ' [ h ] 39 but i tell you , do not resist an evil person . 
  if anyone slaps you on the right cheek , turn to them the other cheek also . 
  40 and if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt , hand over your coat as well . 
  41 if anyone forces you to go one mile , go with them two miles . 
  42 give to the one who asks you , and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you . 
  love for enemies, 
  43 `` you have heard that it was said , ` love your neighbor [ i ] and hate your enemy . ' 44 but i tell you , love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you , 45 that you may be children of your father in heaven . 
  he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous . 
  46 if you love those who love you , what reward will you get ? 
  are not even the tax collectors doing that ? 
  47 and if you greet only your own people , what are you doing more than others ? 
  do not even pagans do that ? 
  48 be perfect , therefore , as your heavenly father is perfect . 
  repenting is always connected with remorse and the intention to change ones live . 
  so yes , even the worst sinner can still get to heaven . 
  i guess you are familiar with the scene where jesus speaks to the convict on the cross ? 
  he repented in the last minute and jesus still promised he would come to heaven . 
  but as repenting always requires an honest effort . 
  you just ca n't live a live of selfishness with the intention to repent in the moment of death , because it would n't be honest at all . 
  anyway , can we end this discussion and agree to disagree ? 
  i 'm getting tired of it . 
  you can still raise the topic in / r/religion if you want ( you wo n't find me there , btw ) . 
  maybe you missed it , but in some of these countries the people dismissed their government or at least are trying to do so since the arab spring because they desire basic rights like free speech . 
   the point is that israel is not comparable to these places, 
  you are right . 
  israel is a democracy and should be compared to other democracies . 
  lacking support for freedom of speech would be considered a problem in every democracy . 
   cutting spending means taking money from the poor . 
  i have to disagree . 
  the question is : where are you going to cut spending ? 
  the poor wo n't suffer from a lower military budget , they wo n't suffer from a trimmer administration or the abolishment of this surveillance apparatus called `` united states department of homeland security '' . 
  [ jesus existed . 
  ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/jesus#existence_of_jesus ) it 's just ridiculous to deny even that . 
  also nazism and catholicism does n't add up . 
  to cite [ wikipedia ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/nazi#church_and_state ) : `` national socialist leaders and dogmas were basically , uncompromisingly antireligious '' . 
  and regarding anti-semitism : `` regarding the persecution of jews , the contemporary , historical perspective is that in the period between the protestant reformation and the holocaust , martin luther 's treatise on the jews and their lies ( 1543 ) , exercised a major and persistent intellectual influence upon the german practice of anti-semitism against jewish citizens . '', 
  so please stop bashing catholicism just because you think it 's modern to do so . 
   ridiculous to deny it ? 
  how so ? 
  this is a topic on its own , it seems to be the topic of a lot of books . 
  you can look it up on wikipedia ; here is a relatively short answer : http://www.gotquestions.org/did-jesus-exist.html, 
   it 's tough to call the nazi party completely antireligious , especially with pieces like this : http://i.imgur.com/bpeve.jpg ( ` gott mit uns ' means , you guessed it , ` god with us ' ) . 
  i never denied that they used religion for their advantage . 
  their propaganda was as perfect as it could be . 
  surely , there have been also religious people who fell for their lies . 
  but as you can read in this [ new york times article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/13/weekinreview/word-for-word-case-against-nazis-hitler-s-forces-planned-destroy-german.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm ) , the nazis wanted to destroy christianity from the beginning :, 
   according to baldur von schirach , the nazi leader of the german youth corps that would later be known as the hitler youth , '' the destruction of christianity was explicitly recognized as a purpose of the national socialist movement '' from the beginning , though '' considerations of expedience made it impossible '' for the movement to adopt this radical stance officially until it had consolidated power , the outline says . 
  attracted by the strategic value inherent in the churches ' '' historic mission of conservative social discipline , '' the nazis simply lied and made deals with the churches while planning a '' slow and cautious policy of gradual encroachment '' to eliminate christianity . 
   one issue they took with most christian sects was that they were decidedly judaic in nature, 
  yes , therefore the nazis used the arianism and luther to propagate their views . 
  also , nearly two thirds of the germans back then were protestants . 
  so excuse me if i thought you were bashing catholicism . 
   i was simply pointing out his belief that the comic holds an ` antisemitic undertone ' . 
  i believe given the comic ( and being a jew ) that this is patently false . 
  you are right . 
   also , i 'm not bashing catholicism because it 's modern , i bash it because of the evils ( relative evils , no absolutes here ) it produces . 
  see : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kuzywzgoxw&amp;feature=related for a great debate held on exactly this topic . 
  sorry , i do n't feel like watching 50 minutes of youtube now . 
  but as every other religion the catholic church consists of people and sometimes people behave stupid and wrong . 
  anyway , thanks for explaining your point of view . 
  your first comment just seemed ignorant to me . 
   if we could get the country to adopt genetically modified drought-resistant crops, 
  i do n't think that making them dependent on monsanto is the solution . 
  they need to be able to use a part of the harvest as seeds for the next year . 
  anyway , seeds alone wo n't solve the problem . 
  beside that , they need agricultural infrastructure . 
  they need tools/machines to work efficiently , they need places to store the seeds , the harvest and the fertilizer and they need ways to transport all that . 
  but all that will be for naught without at least some stability . 
  so basically you are saying that the us is too big to lose aaa ? 
  if you criminalize anonymity only criminals will have anonymity . 
  the joke does n't even mention race . 
  it 's all in your head . 
  i can only speak for austria , but i doubt that the countries have been analysed in-depth . 
  austria has a very low unemployment rate ( 4.3 % ) , its public dept in % of gdp is lower than that of germany , the indeptedness was hold relatively low even during the crisis ( 4 , something % ) . 
  also the social peace is intact [ ( no strike since 2005 ) ] ( http://wko.at/statistik/extranet/langzeit/lang-streiks.pdf ) and our ties to eastern europe actually are a boost for the economy and do not `` hurt its balance sheet '' . 
  i really do n't see a reason to question austrias aaa . 
  every government depends on people obeying the law . 
  nonetheless , sometimes disobeying is the right thing to do . 
  i may disagree with you in some details , but i have to admit , that i never read a better summary about what 's going on in israel . 
  thank you !, 
  yes , it 's definitly worth posting elsewhere .
