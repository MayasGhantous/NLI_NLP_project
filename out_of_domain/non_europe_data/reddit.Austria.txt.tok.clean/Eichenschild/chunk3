  it spans over all of israels history and explains the tensions that exists nowadays . 
  your point of view is n't really unbiased and quite different from mine , but i guess you tried to describe the situation as neutral as possible . 
  i also acknowledge that you are way better informed than i and that it 's easy to condemn the actions of the israeli if you sit in a comfortable chair in the heart of europe . 
  i never had to experience any serious violence so it 's hard for me to comprehend how israels citizen feel and why they vote for such an extreme right-wing politician as netanyahu . 
  most israel-related posts i see are full of hatred and it 's seldom that someone really explains his point of view ( this is true for both sides ) . 
  i really appreciate the effort you put in your post and that you avoided any name-calling . 
  this is the sixth time this image is submitted . 
   both sides want victory , not peace . 
  wow . 
  that 's a pretty pessimistic view , but i have no reason to doubt it . 
  what i want to know is : how do you think will this conflict end ? 
  if both sides want victory , is there a solution other than one side commiting a de facto genocide on the other ? 
  but reddit does n't now your real name while facebook does . 
  this is the fifth post of this image on reddit , but `` only '' two of the posts ( this one included ) appeared last week . 
   the moment china implements any genuine protection for its workers , minimum wage , safety standards , labor laws - their costs will go up and the business will be sent to the next country willing to step up . 
  i 'm not aware of a country which has chinas size , stability and infrastructure and treats its worker as bad as china does . 
  thus i do n't think the companies would leave china if it enforces improved condidtions for the worker . 
  while india has similar minimum wages as china , it also has , according to [ this link ] ( http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/asia-and-the-pacific/india-working-conditions.html ) strong unions :, 
   as opposed to neighboring china , trade unions in india play a very prominent role in the business community . 
  every industry has a trade union that advocates the rights and employment opportunities of its members . 
  trade unions strive to obtain the best deal for their members in terms of wages , working conditions , acceptable remuneration , and welfare packages . 
  as much as 92 percent of the labor force in india is unionized . 
  furthermore , india is a democracy and has freedom of speech . 
  protests are n't silenced as easy as in china . 
  would you mind to elaborate ? 
  i stated facts and came to a conclusio . 
  what exactly is naive in your opinion ? 
  13 hours back , i submitted [ this link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/jza27/archeologists_locate_ruins_of_gladiator_school_in/ ) . 
  i have n't received any votes for this link , but now i looked and i could n't find it anywhere in the top 400 links . 
  now i see , that op , a mod , submitted a link to the same topic at nearly the same time . 
  what 's happening here ?

   p.s. 
  there 's a difference between destroying the opposition and destroying the whole of the church . 
   republican party in austria, 
  excuse me , but this is bullshit . 
  it 's very misleading to compare the \u00d6vp with the republican party in the us . 
   she was against increasing taxes, 
  austria already has the fourth highest tax quote in the [ oecd ] ( http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/51/44/47823722.xls#%27country%20graphs%27!a1 ) , so raising taxes does n't seem to be the smart thing to do in austrias case . 
   20 % tax on severance packages, 
  i think you deliberately missed to mention the aim of this measure . 
  austria has a considerable problem with early retirements . 
  this was one of a couple of measures to tackle it . 
  this article does n't even mention what fekter , among other politicians of the eurozone , wanted : the international introduction of a transaction tax . 
  of course , geithner even refused to consider it seriously . 
  excuse me , but how exactly do you link the corruption concerning telekom austria to the \u00d6vp ? 
  the minister concerned was a member of the bz\u00d6 . 
  also , the sp\u00d6 has a corruption case at the moment , and you would n't call the social democrats republicans , do you ? 
   privatize everything, 
  [ citation needed ] . 
  the \u00d6vp has privatised various companies , right , but not `` everything '' . 
  and please tell me , why should the state run the metal processing industry or an oil company ? 
   coalition with the fp\u00d6, 
  back then , the fp\u00d6 had a considerable liberal wing ( for example susanne riess-passer ) . 
  also , the fp\u00d6 already reached 25 % at the poll and was still rising . 
  do you really want to ignore them forever , no matter how strong ? 
  now let 's have a look at some other points of comparison . 
  maybe a us-citizen can make the counterpart :, 
  - ) when was the last time the \u00d6vp proposed that we should go to war ? 
  never . 
  - ) military expenditures in austria during the time \u00d6vp / fp\u00d6 was constantly below 1 % of the gdp . 
  - ) worker unions : the unions make up a large part of the \u00d6vp and are very influental inside the \u00d6vp . 
  for example , the current chairman of the party comes from the \u00d6aab . 
  - ) welfare state : while the \u00d6vp is very concerned about fiscal responsibility and is n't a fan of rising taxes , the \u00d6vp is still a supporter of the welfare state . 
  - ) renewable energies : the \u00d6vp wants to boost renewable energies , particularily hydro , wind , solar and biomass . 
  i could continue that list , but i think my point , that the comparison is very misleading , is clear . 
  it 's true that the \u00d6vp is considered the conservative party of austria and that the republican party is the conservative party of the us , but that does n't make the \u00d6vp the republican party of austria . 
   my point was that she officially said she is against raising taxes but then did the very thing and just called it `` entlastungspaket '' . 
  are you taking offense of the fact that politicians are trying to sell their legislature to the citizens ? 
  the `` entlastungspaket '' was a mix of measures and `` we lower some burdens and increase others because we think it 's the right thing to do '' does n't seem like a very good name . 
   yeah but her measures are n't just about the early retirements , are they ? 
  i 'm no expert in law , but this question arises : how are you going to raise this tax only from people which are going to retire early ? 
  if they leave the company , saying they are going to look for work just to enter retirement one week later they already would have evaded a law like this . 
  nationalism in austria-hungary is an interesting choice because it lead to wwi and the fall of austria-hungary . 
  while nationalism was in the interest of the governments in other contries , it was a deadly threat for austria-hungary . 
   but i figured reddit already knew that, 
  please keep in mind that reddit consists of people from all over the world . 
  i ( austrian ) , for example , did n't know that the us tried to invade canada . 
   in a translated iranian supreme court brief from 2010 , however , the charge of apostasy is the only charge leveled against nadarkhani . 
   `` mr. youcef nadarkhani , son of byrom , 32-years old , married , born in rasht in the state of gilan is convicted of turning his back on islam , the greatest religion the prophesy of mohammad at the age of 19 , '' reads the brief . 
  try / r/webcomics . 
  it bans too successful comics like smbc for exactly that reason . 
  please elaborate . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.torresolenergy.com/eportal_docs/general/senerv2/doc-cw4cb709fe34477/gemasolarplant.pdf ) is a pdf which describes how this plant works . 
   post obscure stuff that we 're not likely to have seen yet instead of karma whoring, 
   so the fact that it is 1 ) a negative number and 2 ) unit-less should make it east to tell at a glance that it is from an `` unsciencey '' person , and thus likely to be fahrenheit . 
  i 'm from europe and when i see a unit-less temperature indication i always assume it 's celsius . 
   well , many would argue that it has n't worked very well for the eu . 
  i do n't see how one could blame the ecb for the problems of the eu . 
  the ecb has a much more limited scope of action than the fed , and it 's main objective is n't supporting and boosting the economy , but to ensure price stability . 
   please do not editorialise the titles, 
   privately held banks to control there issuance of money . 
  the ecb controls the isssuance of money , but it 's not privately held , but owned by the national central banks . 
  the national central banks are owned by the respective gouvernment ( at least true for the austrian central bank , i have n't checked all the other central banks ) . 
  please do n't project your knowledge of the us-system onto other parts of the world . 
  [ many eu-coutries wants to introduce a transaction tax ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-28/eu-proposes-78-billion-a-year-financial-transaction-tax-to-start-in-2014.html ) . 
  they do n't want such an insanly high percentage on every transaction but 0.1 % on stocks and bonds and 0.01 % for derivates contracts , but the uk and the us oppose even these low fees . 
  if the tax would be introduced in the whole of the eu or even in the us and the eu , the argument , that the transactions could move to a jurisdiction without such a tax would be invalid . 
  when all the economic major player would have a tax it would be possible to hunt down people who tries to evade taxes and to punish tax havens . 
  this happened before - just think of anonymous bank accounts in switzerland .
