  huh ? 
  citation please . 
  more important , where is u/linkfixerbot when you need him ? 
  i think it 's to show our support for the german economic ideas ( no debt mutualization and no massive money-printing ) . 
  seems appropriate . 
  one more guiness , please . 
  ca n't be right . 
  europes beaches are german colonies during the summer month , occupied with millions of towels . 
  i 've written european beaches , because you find them everywhere , especially in italy . 
  mallorca ( spain ) is often referred to as an additional german federal state . 
  italy ca n't be an ally , only a backstabbing traitor . 
  the same way the us justifies industrial espionage ? 
  austrians are of perfect mixture , including best part of all the people . 
  use the austrian railways : http://www.oebb.at/en/index.jsp, 
  norway only has puny mineral oil . 
  nuclear oil is of styria !, 
  the us categorized germany as one of its primary spying targets - very `` friendly '' . 
  to be fair , it was the other way around : [ germany wanted austria to attack serbia to have an excuse to invade france ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/july_crisis#german_attitude_to_war ) :, 
   on july 2 , the saxon ambassador in berlin wrote back to his king that the german army wanted austria to attack serbia as quickly as possible because the time was right for a general war since germany was more prepared for war than either russia or france . 
  they are dissidents who revealed the war crimes and schemes of a government which is out of control . 
  seems like a pretty good contribution to world peace to me . 
  you have secret laws , secret courts and gag orders . 
  all of these things are more common in police states than in a democracy . 
  eyeryone has secret laws and secret courts ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  you might want to back your statement up by providing evidence for that in , for example , austria . 
  actually , you can even access the whole austrian legal code on ris.bka.gv.at . 
  also , even the security expert [ bruce schneier critizes these procedures ] ( https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/08/restoring_trust.html ) :, 
   in the same way , democracy ca n't work unless voters know what the government is doing in their name . 
  that 's why we have open-government laws . 
  secret courts making secret rulings on secret laws , and companies flagrantly lying to consumers about the insecurity of their products and services , undermine the very foundations of our society . 
  actually , i do n't live in america , which means i have no protection whatever against the nsa . 
  i have n't said that we do n't have secret services . 
  i spoke about secret laws and secret courts . 
  and as you can read , the verfassungsschutz is based on laws and under the supervision of the parliament . 
  sorry , i 'm not allowed to talk to strangers . 
  they may be dangerous . 
  go away !, 
  on a more serious note : it 's difficult to answer such a generalized question , but i think austrians are quite openminded . 
  many old people ca n't speak english , so you will have more luck speaking to younger people . 
  so 2.000 msv are just , like , 20 million bananas . 
  you only act so arrogant to hide your fear of a new cordoba . 
  also , stop abusing austrias flag , plox . 
  austria-hungary against whom ? 
  the uno is a diplomatic forum , which more or less represents the actual power distribution ( that 's why the strongest nations can veto petitions ) . 
  as soon as you start removing major players from the un , you make it even more irrelevant . 
  read up on the league of nations . 
  it existed between wwi and wwii and was the predecessor of the un . 
  the us never participated , nazi-germany got kicked out/left , along with other powers . 
  so when wwii started the league of nations had no influence whatsoever on the events , partly because major players were missing . 
  what have you done ? 
  all the redditors in the swiss parliament will vote against the deal now !, 
  you are a burden to swedens industry !, 
  give the laziest man the hardest job and he 'll find a way to avoid working . 
  uhm , acutually , austria had to pay reparations . 
  it was one of the reasons our economy was in shambles during the duration of the first republic . 
  actually , doctors who refuse abortions are just following the [ modern version of the hippocratic oath ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_geneva#declaration ) :, 
   i will practice my profession with conscience and dignity, 
   i will maintain the utmost respect for human life, 
   the health of my patient will be my first consideration, 
  incidentially today is also alzheimer day . 
  cause forget war , that 's why !, 
  this comic was about ww1 , not ww2 . 
  you are right about ww2 , though . 
  oh , and the russians also plundered everything which was n't bolted to the ground . 
  the reunion of tirol has nothing to do with austrian imperialism . 
  i think he said it was n't an empire because it was much more like a loose federation than a single country . 
  calling the hre an empire is like calling the eu a major economic and military power . 
  france gets unruly if there 's no big power east of them . 
  this comment is like the holy grail for r/shitredditsays . 
  that are of course possibilities , but you see , the eu budget is fixed till 2018 or something . 
  this means that nobody can do anything about it during this period of office without breaking treaties or leaving the eu . 
  only a untermensch would say such a thing !, 
  they already got a good offer from the nigerian space agency . 
  germoney tried to address him accordingly in the fourth panel but had a freudian slip . 
  why not eastern poland ? 
  end result : france lost . 
  also , you forgot to add your defeats on that arc of yours in paris . 
  spreading democracy ? 
  in which country ? 
  afaik napoleon wasn '' t exactly democratically elected either . 
  ok , i think we can agree on the fact taht he fought aristocracy . 
  that did n't stop him from declaring himself emperor , though . 
  i just found this quotation of napoleon :, 
   do you think , either , that my object is to establish a republic ? 
  what a notion !, 
  a republic of thirty million people , with our morals and vices !, 
  how could that ever be ? 
  it is a chimera with which the french are infatuated but which will pass away in time like all the others . 
  what they want is glory and the gratification of their vanity ; as for liberty , of that they have no conception . 
  still american . 
  you have to focus on the important , delicious parts of live !, 
  are there really people who call mohnweckerl `` mohnflesserl '' ? 
  they bath all the time , so it ca n't be that bad . 
  so give back to ~ ~ caesar ~ ~ germoney what is ~ ~ caesar 's ~ ~ germoney 's , and to god what is god 's . 
  rat mal was die # 1 in den [ owasp top ten 2013 ] ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/category:owasp_top_ten_project#owasp_top_10_for_2013 ) ist . 
  i think misantropicloner referred to the `` kleindeutsche l\u00f6sung '' in the 19th century , not to ww2 . 
  more important : [ austria defeated the usa 1:0 yesterday evening . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/19/austria-vs-usa-live ), 
   the biggest difference between austria and germany is the common language .
