  can confirm . 
  `` raunzen '' ( the austrain art of complaining ) is one of our favourite activities ) . 
  the sun never rises in the british empire . 
  the xenophob fp\u00d6 holds a ball in the hofburg , which is attended by various far-right people . 
  left-wing activists have a problem with that and protest against it . 
  since there are always vandals and generally aggressive people among the activists , the police has to respond with a large presence as well . 
  the theater surrounding the `` akademikerball '' is more or less the same every year . 
  sounds great !, 
  what about austria-hungary ? 
  double eyepatch !, 
  austria productive !, 
  beating up france is always among the logical options . 
  so we should take trient back you say ? 
  alright , i 'll inform germany . 
  cause prussia is a bad idea !,

  enjoying `` food '' that everybody else in the world considers inedible is a british trait , though . 
   i recently learned that under the european union i would be able to inherit any estate ( s ) that they had, 
  do you have a citation for that ? 
  i would be surprised if that worked out , considering laws like the [ bene\u0161-dekrete ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bene%c5%a1_decrees ) . 
  is even english for runaways !, 
  evil scheming without austria ? 
  what the heck ? 
  and in austria we call the germans piefke . 
  sounds good , but why should i use that instead of scapy ? 
  on the internet , nobody knows you 're a shark . 
  in a space ship next to russias kinky space lizards , obviously . 
  plus the revolutions of 1848, 
  when the firemen are alarmed , they have to respond . 
  and once they are there , they might as well help , if it is n't too much of a nuisance to them . 
  the causer of the run has to pay for the efforts , though . 
  zur verdeutlichung : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/datei:partnership_for_peace_members.svg, 
  have you heard that 955 per cent of all statistic with a period are wrong, 
  better ? 
  in my experience , scapy always worked reasonably fast , so these results seemed odd to me . 
  so i adapted the script and ran the test too ( in a virtual environment ) :, 
  from scapy.all import *, 
  import time, 
  t = time.time ( ), 
  for dport in range ( 1,1001 ) :, 
  ans = sr1 ( ip ( dst = ' 10.0.0.1 ' ) / tcp ( dport = dport ) , iface = `` eth0 '' , retry = 2 , timeout = 0.1 , verbose = 0 ), 
  if ans :, 
  if ans [ tcp ] . flags = = 18 :, 
  m = time.time ( ) - t, 
  print `` time elapsed : % 0.2 f minutes '' % ( m/60 ), 
  result :, 
  root@debian:/tmp# . / scapy_tcp_scanner . py, 
  warning : no route found for ipv6 destination : : ( no default route ? ), 
  22 \\ open, 
  80 \\ open, 
  111 \\ open, 
  443 \\ open, 
  445 \\ open, 
  time elapsed : 0.12 minutes, 
  any ideas why my results and ops results differ that much ? 
  i 'm aware of the fact that an internet connection has more latency than a local connection , but in your example , scapy needed 7 minutes while pinject only needed 3 . 
  the question is : why should scapy need that much more time than pinject over an internet connection when the processing time is obviously less than 10 seconds , as demonstrated by my testrun . 
  actually , we just switched to the only winning side - the arms industry . 
  choosing the kleindeutsche l\u00f6sung instead of accepting austria as leader of the german-speaking people was their worst idea !, 
  [ just according to legends !, 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flag_of_austria ) :, 
   the austrian triband is the oldest flag in use dating to 1230 at the latest ( though 16th century sources claim that the danish flag , first attested in the 1340s , dates to 1219 ),

  and there 's the [ sixth crusade ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixth_crusade ) , which was just diplomacy ( backed by an army ) . 
  from your own link :, 
   involving more than 600,000 combat participants , it was the largest battle since the battle of leipzig in 1813, 
  northern germany ? 
  the swedes also destroyed castles in austria !, 
  after the split-up of austria-hungary the remainder of austria was also called `` deutsch-\u00d6sterreich '' ( german austria ) , and the idea to form a country with germany was very popular . 
  there was a political party ( die `` gro\u00dfdeutschen '' ) , whose main goal was the fusion with germany . 
  they were no nazis , though . 
  even prominent social democrats like dr. renner were in favour of that idea . 
  lacks austrian .

  is there a reason why you used your focus to strengthen the conservatives ? 
  i usually use them for more clerics/bureaucrats/factory worker , clerks or to strengthen the liberals . 
  you are really surprised to find 50.000 austrians , irish and brits on mallorca in july ?

  luxemburg joined germany when i formed it as bavaria ( without mods ) . 
  so it should be possible . 
  the `` a '' should be clue enough to send the letter to austria .
