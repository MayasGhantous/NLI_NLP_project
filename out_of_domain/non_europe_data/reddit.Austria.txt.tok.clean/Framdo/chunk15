  thank you , i lost hope for a moment . 
  well , to be fair , there are a lot more reasons to call someone that believes in any religion a retard . 
  because i ve been to america . 
  not only that , but the food quality is really bad compared to europe due to softier regulations . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4bbmjh/why_is_the_quality_of_food_in_europe_wheat_fruit/d17x16x/ ) this guy explains it better . 
  * volvo fuck your gold level up buttons . 
  i was in the middle of a fight , i gained a level , i could n't see my hp and i died . 
  fuck you icefrog *, 
  why ld i lie to you ? 
  literally every american that has travelled to europe knows what i am talking about . 
  i am ve been to ny for about 2 weeks . 
  i am not saying that it is much time and please do n't believe me ... believe the guy above who is in the field and [ learn how to google ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=why+is+american+food+so+bad+quality%3f ) . 
  just because you believe that you have great food , does n't mean that it truly is . 
  i thought the pizza that i eat is great until the first time i went to italy . 
  as for the rest ... you seem to either be a kid or too patriotic and you have definitely never traveled in your life . 
  hey , people have different opinions !, 
  how dare they ? 
  right ? 
  i am looking at my post history and i literally never attacked anything american . 
  but i can attack you and say that you are retarded and your iq probably is way * lower * than the average . 
  seriously , i conversation with you is like talking to a freaking 5 year old . 
  you are so ignorant and arrogant . 
  terrible compination . 
  i gave sources , you gave shit . 
  grow up and learn how to make an argument . 
  how the fuck do you know that dnc leaks were orchestrated by russian intelligence services ? 
  there is no proof for these shit . 
  you are also underestimating what a single person can do . 
  i remember a story about a greek [ 15year old ] ( http://news.softpedia.com/news/greek-teenager-arrested-for-hacking-into-pentagon-fbi-and-nsa-205040.shtml ) that hacked cia and the pentagon alone . 
  noone has heard from him ever since . 
  there are people that have powerful talents . 
  of course not everyone wants to risk his freedom . 
  i agree for the rest ... why the fuck ld anyone want to learn who is icefrog that much to hack his pc ? 
  dude you were funny once in your life with that comment about france and surrender on your other account . 
  since then you are a disappointment . 
  also , your other accounts are easy to spot . 
  you need to change your style or stop trolling . 
  you are boring . 
  collaboration with `` cowboytv '' ? 
  basically the worst thing ever . 
  they are a monopoly in esports in greece . 
  ad finem were playing at the boston final and they were spamming news about tier 3 lol that even lol players do n't care about . 
  answering at your alt 's bullshits is not a good sign for your health . 
  we all know you are mentally challenged but you took it to the next level . 
  it truly isnt . 
  people chose a game with more kills , a absolutely amazing ending , where there was no way to predict who will win at any time of the game past 20 mins , when af made the comeback , over a another crazy game with a massive comeback . 
  as others have mention jerax over faith bian and af as the third team of the year are biased , but i do n't think the game itself was . 
  we see multiple comebacks every year but you do n't see games like that game 3 that often . 
  overwatch ?? 
  are you kidding me ?? 
  noone is watching competitive overwatch because it is an awful viewing experience . 
  as for cs the numbers are dropping really hard and the game is declining too . 
  the guy who posted it is fletcher . 
  he is the only dev that communicates directly with us . 
  not everyday , but now and then . 
  it 's not random . 
  did he abuse lp ? 
  do you understand english ? 
  the guy who posted it works for valve . 
  what more do you want ? 
  are you braindead ? 
  do you want him to give you the code ? 
  why ? 
  call it prejudice , call it bigotry but it 's still discrimination . 
  this retarded argument . 
  seriously ... what the fuck is going on with semantics . 
  as i said ... call it prejudice , call it bigotry but it 's still discrimination . 
  it must be hard to be that idiot to think that somehow i am offended right now or that you gave an argument or something . 
  18mg on an aio or a t18 is too harsh . 
  i recommend 12mg or even 6mg . 
  i was smoking 2 packs and i started with 6 . 
  and that 's the right thing to do . 
  he tried it but apparently he is not good enough . 
  stream wo n't get him so much money that it dl be worth it to leave his studies . 
  i applaud his decision to do not stream all day/everyday . 
  it ld destroy his life . 
  no idea ... i ve seen it before and i thought it was ordinary . 
  mushi was a top player for many years . 
  he also got 4th at the last ti so i do n't get your reasoning . 
  people like to underestimate him but he is upthere , with the other top teams , very often . 
  he is not a top mid player anymore but his value in a team is more than just raw skill . 
  his experience and his popularity makes him stay alive in the scene . 
  alright , i am sorry . 
  now , go pray to your [ master ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m5rzcxw.png ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sure, 
  in my mind , it 's not even debatable . 
  a top streamer can get enough money to make it worth it but if you are a guy with 2k viewers it 's terrible to think like that . 
  bulldog for example who makes a living out of it right now , reaches 10-20k viewers and i 'd bet that he has several hundred thousands dollars from his earnings as a player and his salaries in his bank account . 
  that alone gives you huge comfort for the future because you already have more than enough money to do something with your life when the party ends . 
  now , if you are like attacker , you have a stream that at least right now does n't provide you with that much income and that you are not sure if it ever will . 
  you have not studied and if you fail at that , you are in a terrible position . 
  the right decision is to do not do it for a living and go to a university . 
  at least that is what i 'd do . 
  obviously , i say all this without knowing his true economical situation . 
  his parents might be rich . 
  10k/months with 2k viewers ? 
   the streamer decides when they run advertisements , giving them more control over their revenue and brand . 
  if a streamer with 2,000 concurrent viewers and $ 1.00 ecpm runs three commercials per hour and streams for eight hours a day , five days a week , they can earn about $ 240 a week or $ 960 a month from advertising revenue . 
   and advertisements are only one revenue path . 
  100 subscribers would equate to $ 250 extra per month for new twitch partners,
