  on the otherhand , we are talking about 12yos and they are not at the pinnacle of human intelligence and observation so it can work . 
  it 's a risk tho . 
  yeah . . i agree with your husband . 
  since he does n't have cystic acne his problem is not that big anyway . 
  soon enough his classmates and friends will start having problems too . 
  better now than later in his life . 
  whoever wants to meet him please keep in mind that he plays lol . 
  nuff said . 
  / u/madaostream help this guy out . 
  ok , let me tell you that this is bullshit . 
  a bo3 is usually 1,5-2 ,5 hours of work including breaks . 
  now , i am not saying that v1lat does n't have the right to ask for better conditions because eveyrone does , but if you like to work 4 hours a day then you should take half money . 
  end of story . 
  edit : we also know for sure that valve pays the dota talents the best salary in all major esports . 
  you can find the discussion [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/dh1nwo93h5q ) . 
  i do n't think that wanting the best casters to cast 6-8 hours for 1-2 days 2-3 times a year is a bad thing consdering what they take . 
   non-stop top casting is very arduous job , it 's not like sitting at your desk , shuffling papers . 
  * non-stop top casting is very easy job , it 's not like working construction or carry things at a factory for the minimum salary . 
  you see what i did there ? 
  you ca n't pick a job and compare it to casting . 
  what i am saying it is that working 8 hours/day for 1-2 days , 3 times/year is not a bad thing and that if they want less , they should get less money . 
  that 's how the market works . 
  you ca n't just go public , complain and then suddenly get the same money for less work . 
  in the end they should negotiate the working conditions before they sign . 
  that 's really unprofessional from v1lat 's part . 
  edit : it 's funny to get downvoted by people that have n't worked a single day in their life . 
  otherwise they would get my point . 
  and you just picked one sentence from the whole post . 
  i did n't see v1lat talking about taking money either . 
  and that 's the point . 
  he should adress it . 
  he also said that `` it 's not expensive '' implying that it will cost more . 
   it 's not a salary , it 's a talent fee . 
  congrats ... you just said the same thing . 
   it 's not the best in esports anymore and that would only be for ti anyway , not majors . 
  it is tho ... give me a source that says the opposite . 
  i gave you 3 top notch casters from the 3 major esports that say that dota talent take way more money that all of them ** per year ** . 
   casting is difficult over long periods of time . 
  it 's not like other jobs because you ca n't just `` work harder '' and still put out the same level of content . 
  being on camera and especially casting takes a real mental and sometimes physical toll that you ca n't just push through . 
  when i was tired in the marines , i could just push myself to the next limit . 
  until my body forces me to stop . 
  until i blacked out from dehydration . 
  you ca n't do that to your vocal cords or your brain . 
  at a certain point , your brain just does n't give you what you need and same goes with your vocal cords with the extra punishment of potentially doing permanent dmg to your voice . 
  noone said the opposite . 
  that does n't mean that you should complain for casting 8 hours/3 days per year . 
  ** in the end negotiate the working conditions before you sign . 
  do n't complain after that because then it 's your fault . 
  that 's what people do in the real world . 
   with the way other talent industries work , you should really have days of 8 hours for on camera talent . 
  i know that sounds like pussy shit and obviously you can go past that but it 's a standard in other talent industries for a reason . 
  it gives you the best of those people . 
  casting is not camera and people in those jobs are doing way more than that like finding stories etc. 
  camera is a small part of their daily job . 
   you ca n't count just the time we 're `` actually casting '' as the only work that 's done . 
  two series takes 5-7 hours and that 's the amount of work we 're doing . 
  do n't penny pinch and say `` well game time is 45 min and you had a 20 min break in between '' . 
  it 's all work, 
  i did include the breaks but you can not avoid the fact that in those 8 hours the breaks can literally reach 2-3 hours . 
  alright , i ll go ahead and say that i was wrong for the first two points and especially for the second one since i did n't notice your name . 
  as for the third point , not negotiating in this industry and in esports in general it 's your fault . 
  this is what many of you are saying for the players too . 
  i assume that you all have some contact with valve and you could n't negotiate ? 
  going public like that 'd get you fired in the outside work . 
  the only reason it does n't happen is because of the twitter followers/community . 
  now , if you tried to negotiate and they did n't accept then alright you could say something . 
  that does n't change the fact that part of it it 's your fault . 
   being `` on-camera '' does n't have to refer to physically being on the screen , but performing live . 
  casting is still that . 
  i was actually being generous when i said 8 hours on screen . 
  most talent industries keep at less than 6 . 
  we 're just trying to get esports to recognize 8 hrs and compensate for overages . 
  these people tho do it all the time . 
  a journalist , a comedian etc are working 8-12 hours daily to get that 30min-2 ,5 hours on air . 
  you tell me that working 8 hours for 1 single day in the group stages is bad ? 
  it literally happens 2-3 times per year . 
   it 's not like talent enjoy breaks . 
  youre dressed up , watching and studying another game , feeling the adrenaline fade away and getting tired . 
  you want to get back in there and get the show going again because waiting around is more draining than anything . 
  it 's not like we 're sitting in a hot tub , jerking off . 
  you 're there , on standby , ready to perform again when it 's go-time and that 's still work . 
  let me put it more clearly . 
  do you believe that your 2-3 hour work you are doing out of your daily 8 , 3 times per year in valve events , when you are not casting , is that difficult that requires your daily 8 to be cut in 4-6 ? 
  i do n't think show . 
  also as for your other post , comparing marines to casting is literally outraging . 
  i was in the special forces of my country during a tough period the last summer and i ve worked at various shitty jobs until i get my degree . 
  what you are doing is a very good job and ** of course you should ask for more ** but do n't exaggerate . 
  we ca n't trust you either apparently . 
  * tagged as peasant . 
  nah i do n't want to look down on anyone and it 's not that i do n't understand . 
  it 's that our views are obviously different . 
  i literally gave you examples of people that do more work than you on the same `` talent industry '' . 
  anyway , of course you know better but that does n't mean that you are right on every point . 
  we are biased when it comes to our jobs . 
  good luck tomorrow . 
  cap , v1lat and every guy that is at major is very good at their jobs , deserve to be there and make as much money as they can . 
  that does n't mean that i ca n't find some demands they have very unfair even if it 's their right and they do well that claim them . 
  first of all , they dont ' t work 15 hours . 
  let 's be honest .
