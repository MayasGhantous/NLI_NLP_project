   the reason whey may cause acne is unknown , but there are a few theories . 
  studies have suggested a connection between dairy in general and acne , specifically low or nonfat dairy , which points to whey as a potential culprit . 
  `` whey is a part of milk . 
  it 's mostly what 's left in a skim product , '' baldwin says . 
  after the fat is skimmed off to make cream and the curds removed to make cheese , the liquid whey is what 's left . 
  `` that 's what gets dried out and made into [ protein ] powder , '' baldwin explains . 
  people seriously want a 14 yo old ass engine that can not even support monkey king and the new hud ? 
  i bet you also believe that wc3 engine  everything . 
  reading 2006 - reading 2009 - sao paulo 2012 - glastonbury 2013 - austin texas 2013 . 
  drafts are so predictable right now . 
  edit : i lied !!, 
  legend !, 
  the russian viewership ~ ~ picked ~ ~ peaked at 370k . 
  the english viewership at 270k and the ingame western viewership at 160k . 
  * stats *, 
  ti6 had 105 out of 111 heroes picked . 
  do you see the difference ? 
   coming from a 6.3 k mmr player & currently sitting at diamond 3, 
  proof ? 
  there is no way you say that lol is more competitive if you are 6.3 k mmr . 
  the skill cap in dota is way higher tho because of the way bigger amount of mechanics . 
  day/night cycle , low-high ground , versatility between hero positions , different hit animations , different vision per hero , more items , more difficult heroes ( invoker meepo visage chen etc ) and many-many more things . 
  because there is no way a 5k < player can play invoker , visage , io , meepo , chen , enchantress and every hero that requires you to be mechanically advanced as effective . 
  there are no such champions in lol , that 's why you do n't understand . 
  russian stream ~ ~ picked ~ ~ peaked at 370k viewers , english at 270k and the ingame western servers at 150k today . 
  they were more at some point . 
  370k from the russian stream + 270k from the english stream + ~ 50k from the rest . 
  do you work for wsj ? 
  you are fucking idiot . 
  i did n't say that they do n't require mechanical skills . 
  i said that they do n't require that many . 
  i ve played lol for years . 
  you are ignorant . 
  meepo : you have to control ** 4 characters ** with 4 skills each, 
  visage : you have to control your main characters and his 3 birds . 
  invoker : he has ** 12 ** skills that are being invoked with different combinations from 3 seperate skills, 
  chen : you have to control your character and 5 jungle creeps . 
  ask any lol player in the lol subreddit right now . 
  stop being stubborn . 
  mentioning china as proof . 
  it peaked at 150k . 
  i am talking for a 10 day tournament and you are talking for the whole year . 
  it 's his very old twitter . 
  he started tweeting again last december . 
  i feel you . 
  yours is a lot more harsh tho because everyone knew that vp was strong and the grand finals were way more close . 
  shit happens . 
  you mean that you only watch the majors/ti right ? 
  if you want to understand you have to play a bit . 
  play some bot matches at least . 
  dude ... if i come to your neighborhood and start saying that you are pedo , how would you react ? 
  you provided no source but just a link from a comment of a troll . 
  torte has shown his freaking face on camera and everyone knows who he is . 
  you ca n't just provide no actual evidence . 
  in the real world you could face legal consequences and if not you , the other guy for sure . 
  rofl ... may i ask what is your age and how you do n't know that calling someone a pedophile and a rapist in public without evidence is illegal ? 
   jaja, 
  i got my answer ... do n't worry . 
  yeah because blizzard has 4000 support stuff . 
  also the community manager for dota at least is / u/wykrhm . 
  vavle is so successful because of the way the company operates which is truly unique . 
  yep ... also not every company has steam . 
  he is definitely getting paid . 
  from his twitter bio, 
   artist , that guy from the news , ** community man , makes video games ** , enthusiast . 
  add that he is the creator of every official discord channel for tis , majors and that he basically talks about dota 24/7 and you got your answer . 
  that or he is freaking rich and does n't have to work and loves dota so much that he does n't mind doing what he does for the community . 
  even if he does n't work for valve , he works for a company that works with valve . 
  yeah it does ... not perfectly ... but it does . 
  from a google search is 300 dollars/month . 
  you are fucked . 
  here it 's 6 euros . 
  here man . 
  thx for the info . 
  which site is the most popular ? 
  tieba or sgamers forum by the way ? 
  both seem very active . 
  this is like reddit . 
  when i get on tieba it seems like it 's extremely popular ( 10 times more than reddit ) . 
  how it is possible ? 
  not that many people play dota over there i believe . 
  yeah that 's true everywhere except cis . 
  peru and sea . 
  i do n't believe them . 
  that 's actually a really terrible eli5 based on bild 's articles . 
  shame on you . 
  you completely ignore how the euro fucks up deficit countries because of the way it 's structured . 
  also , you casually forgot to mention about the `` pretend and extend that the debt is not unsustainable '' ponzy loans of europe towards greece and how they fucked up and lied to their own citizens . 
  finally , you completely do n't mention that basically everyone lied about their debts in order to join the euro according to imf 's old chief . 
  telling a part of a story and especially exaggeratingit it is nothing to be proud of . 
  how about going to a dermatologist ? 
  if you acne is that bad he will probably suggest accutane tho , so be prepared . 
  acne does n't magically goes away after 5 years . 
  / u/blitzdota now write a blog on how to gain weight because i ca n't whatever i do . 
  i eat about 3k-3 ,3 k ( depends ) calories a day and i go to the gym 3days/week . 
  still , ca n't take a freaking gram . 
  i have to . 
  i usually eat 5 meals a day . 
  usually tosts , eggs , bread with honey , yogurt with honey , milk with cereal , fruits and lots of chicken with rice . 
  yeah lol ... there is no way i ll take advice from strangers .
