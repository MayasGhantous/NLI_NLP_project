  they did n't qualify for ti and manila major for literally 1 game ( not series ) . 
  i hope that they 'll improve . 
  starladder wo n't give a direct invite lol . 
  my chinese are bad but from a quick visit at tieba ( / r/dota2 's chinese equivalent ) many people are siding with ace . 
  basically :, 
  greece was overspending and had an unsustainable debt . 
  eu decided to do not deal with the problem immidiately and gave greece the biggest loan in human history to repay the previous debt . 
  of course giving a credit card to someone to repay previous debts on conditions that shrink the income ( austerity ) from which the installments must be repayed is not a good idea . 
  so eu and greece have been cought up in this cycle loan -  austerity -  loan -  austerity because the debt is unsustainable . 
  the situation in greece is getting worse because of this . 
  the eu should either restructure the debt or let greece go . 
  so / u/nadoter . 
  the analogy is so idiotic tbh . 
  neither of those teams are trash . 
  euro 2004 greece was playing one of the best defences the world has ever seen . 
   2 years later repeat the whole cycle because there retirement age and way of living does n't fit their economy ? 
  there they are ... the economists of reddit . 
  the retirement age is 67 yo . 
  maybe you mean the sustainability of the system ? 
  well sure ... greek pension funds will never be sustainable because the country has a demographic problem , like it happens to most countries nowadays . 
  as for the way of living ... what do you mean again ? 
  people do n't spend their money on fancy cars when they take 500 euros as salary and their rent is 300 . 
  i do n't get what you want to say . 
   neither of those options work after you accept a big loan since restructuring will make this the last time they ever get free money and they still ca n't make ends meet . 
  i mean ... the budget is balanced right now . 
  also , what do you mean `` that restructuring will make this the last time they ever get money '' ? 
  they will be allowed to go back to the markets . 
   he austerity way might help them if they keep at it . 
  the netherlands took austerity measures and came out well in the end . 
  greece is n't the same , but they ca n't keep going as they are now . 
  damn ... even the imf said that they fucked up with the austerity , but people still support it . 
  ** the austerity that has been imposed in greece has nothing to do with the austerity that has been imposed elsewhere . 
  the amount of cuts is insane . 
  netherlands is not even comperable ** . 
  end of story . 
   this is post eu intervention, 
  that was the case for the whole eu . 
  after the crisis everyone started to raise the bar . 
   the known fact of massive tax avoidance . 
  it is hard to run a state without enough tax income . 
  i said nothing regarding alcohol and hookers . 
  i 'm sure they live very modestly since you ca n't do otherwise with such income ( i have similar income as a student ) . 
  tax avoidance was certaintly a thing and it still is . 
  the problem is that people ** can not afford to pay taxes even if they want right now ** . 
  a bussiness man gives ** 85 % ** of its ' income to taxes . 
  add the extremely low salaries compared to the cost of living and you have your answer . 
   i do n't hear any solutions or even ways to keep them going beside prolonging the situation by trowing more money at it ( restructuring loans ) . 
  due to the unsustainable debt if there is no restructure europeans will lose more money because greece will go bankrupt . 
  there are other ways tho ... like making the debt extremely long-dated or postpone some debts that are owned to european institutions for 20 years ( lets say ... ) . 
  it 's been 7 years since the beginning of the crisis and i still see bullsits like `` the eu is using this situation to pressure greece into reforming their institutions . '' . 
  i guess that 's what people see when they look the situation from the outside . 
  in reality eu is milking whatever is left from greece . 
  taking away collective bargaining , selling ** profitable ** assets for ridiculously low price ( like the airports ) to german corporations , closing down the only productive tax office that was making progress at lagard list ( aka greek and german corrupted officials ) and skyrocketing the taxation is n't fixing any of those things you mentioned either . 
  when you hear `` reforms '' it 's not like there is a plan going on to reform something ... it means `` cuts '' that basically reduce the income ( aka gdp ) that the debts are supposed to get paid from . 
  they are only extending the inevitable : greece has an unsustainable debt and needs either a debt restructure or to let go . 
  greeks can not afford to pay taxes anyway right now . 
  when you get 500 euros salary and you have to give 250-300 for yout rent while the cost of living is comparable to germany 's , it 's not like that people will pay taxes anyway . 
  that 's why 50 % of greek debt owners do n't pay shit . 
  because they really can not afford . 
  i know it 's hard and difficult for people to understand what it 's going on . 
  you have to witness it firsthand . 
   they are n't however , being dictated which assets , at what price and to whom they should sell it . 
  poor ignorant boy . 
  of course they are . 
  at the memorandum of 2015 troika forced greece to sell some specific assets and had a very optimistic projection that these assets worth 50b euros . 
  of course greece earned far less . 
  look it up instead of making things out of your mind . 
   besides , just because an asset is profitable does n't mean it should be publicly held . 
  of course it is ... otherwise the money fly to another country like in that particular case . 
   at the end of the day , though , the eu is n't earning any money from this whole greece debacle . 
  [ are you fucking kidding me ??? 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33845836 ), 
  the country voted that way . 
  tsipras just fucked varoufakis over and did n't do what they had agreed so varoufakis left . 
  i did . 
  they just removed it . 
  thx, 
  gaben take my money . 
  i throw them to the screen . 
  who gives a shit for your wallet . 
  we do n't care . 
  well ... i suggest [ watching this ] ( https://youtu.be/8dp_v8f8ihs?t=261 ) . 
  he talks about the greek economical crisis . 
  other than that . 
  when the referendum ended and 63 % of greek people supported varoufakis , tsipras basically decided not to continue with his plan and give in . 
  so varoufakis resigned . 
  it 's not the same ... your argument is idiotic . 
  the difference is that cosmetics do n't alter the gameplay which is very important . 
   like with everything wikileaks says it 's just a conspiracy . 
  the brainwash is real . 
  i mean ... what do you mean `` chose '' . 
  they release whatever people send them and they can verify that are legitimate files . 
  and they stop being pro-truth because of their personal biases . 
  got it . 
  so much wisdom . 
   why does wl only leak things that hurt the us ? 
  they leak things about countries all the time . 
  you just happen to hear about us because you are from us . 
  you can actually go to their website and search files by country . 
  i love it when i rekt you and you can not make a simple argument .
