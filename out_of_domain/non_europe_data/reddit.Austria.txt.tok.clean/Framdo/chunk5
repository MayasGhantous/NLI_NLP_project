  now what the image shows ... basically navi and alliance were at the final of ti3 and alliance won 3-2 after a epic series . 
  post ti3 era and after every time those too teams meet we call it `` el clasico '' because we always see amazing games . 
  so the image shows the players of those two teams from the ti3 grandfinals era having a fight as children along with same game references and toby wan which is caster to say `` i dont wan na cast anymore '' . 
  people that speculate sadboys lineups without ppd must be a bit delusional . 
  we already know that ppd `` s father is the owner of sadboys.gg which means ppd was planning on forming sadboys months before . 
  you do n't, 
  after that at a lower tier you got execration ( i dont know if they still exist tho ) and ad finem . 
  all the other teams are tier4 +, 
  kaipi wo n't be the same team at wca . 
  many teams have done it in the past tho . 
  standins are a problem of the scene . 
  he said `` you need to focus on not looking at the comment section ... now get back to work '' . 
  i was blocked because i pointed out a statistical flaw of datdota . 
  he bacame really passive aggressive and blocked me . 
  how does it feel to be old ? 
  i mean ... i doubt i ` ld take seriously a playerbase that praises rl and thorin . 
  i am with valve on this one ... retardation should be punished . 
  seriously ... i do n't even know any streamer that listens to some indy rock like the strokes , oasis , black keys , arctic monkeys , queens of the stone age etc. 
  i am 20 years old too for fucks sake ... but i ca n't listen to khalifa and this wannabe - hardrock miracle is listening . 
  i feel so lonely when i go to clubs ... 
  i think that the main reason that they dont stream is literally twitch chat and that everything that happens come to reddit . 
  ee is streaming nowadays and we got top 10 invoker fails countdown every day . 
  ee is `` veteran '' by now and he probably does n't care too much , but people that have n't stream or do n't interact with the community too often will for sure . 
  i personally only watch af 's players streams . 
  it 's sooo funny because we are literally 30-200 viewers . 
  with 2k + viewers the stream is a shitshow . 
  not this shit again . 
  op seems to be like me . 
  i was 400 mmr solo/1900 party for a long time . 
  i knew i am better than that ... i was playing with my 3k friends and i was doing fairly ok . 
  i could n't win solo tho ... it was impossible . 
  i created a smurf and i tryhard like crazy . 
  i was picking ta and was stacking ancients every min for 30 games straight . 
  i had 80 % winrate at this account until i started to play at very high skill bracket and it dropped at 65 % winrate . 
  i calibrated at 3k and now i am 4k scrub . 
  `` valve ban account sellers and boosters '', 
  ** breaking news : ana and general were account sellers and boosters and now they are not because they joined pro teams ... **, 
  `` i dont care ... '', 
  / r/dota2 in a nutshell . 
  i cant follow what is the purpose of your post . 
  ofc i understand that a lot of players participate in it . 
  if there are proofs that they do tho , they should be banned and the same should happen with all acc sellers and boosters .

  no there is no bias ... 
  you are the idiot actually . 
  i am talking about the huge majority not everyone .

  no ... their opinion didnt change because we are talking about pro players ... there is no bias . 
  sure ... 
  for example spartan let everyone play their own songs . 
  we were playing 1 song each and it was really fun . 
  we were only 30-40 people . 
  i didnt say that its not valid . 
  i said that it should be punished . 
  how old are you ? 
  [ look at this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf5sbvfai-q ), 
  nah ... it always shows 2 twitch / 1 azubu / 2 hitbox, 
  leave before the lights come on . 
  the worst job i ve ever had was working as a seller at a supermarket ( student job ) . 
  people are terrible and incredible stupid . 
  edit, 
  the players that are registered for kaipi are ** singsing , bone7 , fuckingmad , comewithme . 
   while a player is locked to a team , the team can not kick the player , and the player can not leave the team . 
  noone can leave and make another team if he wants to play main quals . 
   subs are no longer registered in the roster lock period . 
  teams that qualify for a major event will be able to issue a substitute player invite to any player not participating in the major once the qualifiers for that major are done . 
  subs are no longer registered ... so fuckingmad and comewithme can not be subs . 
  ** kaipi will have to play open quals and if fuckingmad or comewithme wanted to play for another team , they will have to do the same . 
  we are talking about bone7 tho ... / s, 
  subs are not allowed, 
  so if your team goes to ti but the x player can not acquire a visa , then you can take the y player as a sub . 
  there will be no roster changes for the system itself . 
  the sub , will be sub on paper and the x player will be primary for the system . 
  what does he say ? 
  ee says otherwise tho . 
  bane took it ... he had an invis rune . 
  madara actually can see 3 people in the map , 2 people going into radiant jungle is pretty unlikely to happen with smoke . 
  the time is 13:30 which means the previous rune was 1,5 min before . 
  again ... there is a tiny chance that someone without bottle like bane found a rune that noone touched and went after him . 
  moreover , noone has blink and he knows it . 
  where did you buy your whife ? 
  that 's the crucial question . 
  my gf doesnt give a fuck about my vapes ... she is happy i dont smoke anymore tho . 
  the main-menu lag that i had after alt-tab is gone . 
  that 's a plus i guess ... 
  / u/siractionslacks - is following the team too !!!, 
  holy shit ... !!!, 
  np.siractionslacks - inc. . . 
  rofl ... i got instant downvotes right after i posted this . 
  some people are really idiots . 
  i doubt that `` most of you '' do it . 
  i do n't ( i will now tho ) and i am not even sure if this is the solution at all . 
  anyway , put this man 's name on the search bar . 
  he probably knows more than anyone about the dangers and the benefits of vaping . 
  reading some reviews and tips on vaping sites doesnt make you educated either . 
  on the other hand , someone who ve done so much research on vaping like this man , probably knows way more . 
  moreover , i just posted this part ... he said earlier that titanium wire is the healthier solution .
