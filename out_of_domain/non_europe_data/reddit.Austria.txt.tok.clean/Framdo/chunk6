  you are either 10 years old or a fucking butthurt idiot . 
  this particular doctor is actually one of the few doctors that support vaping by acting . 
  you praise him when he says how good vaping is , but he points out a mistake you call him a quake . 
  i dont know if you can find anyone that is more expert on vaping than him . 
  almost every research you see that supports vaping is done by him . 
  he was even consultant at the research that was published by phe . 
  at least give some proper argument . 
  you dont get the point . 
  i am not saying that it will give you cancer right away . 
  i am saying that it 's probably bad for your health . 
  there is a way to make vaping even healthier ... that 's what i am saying . 
  this is your argument ? 
  you need to open a dictionary . 
   but most vapers know what he is ... a quack . 
  source on most vapers ? 
  you are here to say some bullshits because u are butthurt . 
  right ... 
  you ? 
  butthurt ? 
  no ... ofc no . 
  it 's an expression you idiot . 
  holy fucking shit ... i forgot how retarded this community is . 
  i am out of here . 
  eh ... you understand that the enemies have the same problems right ? 
  oh ... you play league of peasants . 
  bad for you / s, 
  are you a moderator at madara 's stream ? 
  if yes ... i never thought you are the guy who 's trying to become a pro . 
  good luck man !!!, 
  i wish you the best . 
  dota has many developers . 
  icefrog is the lead developer . 
  [ lonedruid picker ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a2xboxtcua ), 
  they changed it ... you need to have a lvl 20 profile ... not a lvl 50 xp trophy . 
  you are doing the right thing . 
  they will not stomp for too long tho . 
  after 5-10 games the games become harder and harder . 
  after that point they will play with equal players . 
  my greek student wallet is not good tho ... xd, 
  same ^ ^ ^ ^ seems ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ party ^ ^ ^ ^ over ^ ^ ^ ^ here, 
  [ kappa ] ( http://www.e-smokers.gr/shop/episkevasimoi-atmopoiites/ud-mini-goblin-v2/ ), 
  everyone here is telling me to buy the serpent mini tho ... what problems did you face with the goblin ? 
  nah ... its fine ... i am willing to pay around 30-40 euros so both are in my budget . 
  i will probably go for serpent because it 's easier to build . 
  thx for the invo !, 
  i already ordered the pico + cotton and stuff from fasttech . 
  i dont have the patience man ... : s the serpent mini was out of stock that day . 
  as someone who watches madara 's antimage a lot , i would say that for pros iron talon does n't matter on antimage . 
  he will take all lane creeps and farm the 4-5 times stacked big camp when he takes treads with 2 consecutive pulls . 
  first he will take the small creeps and he will push the lane . 
  then he makes another pull , takes the big creeps and he wont miss a single cs because the lane is pushed . 
  there are not more creeps , so iron wont help him . 
  for pubs it can work i guess . 
  why there is no way ? 
  chinese guys would say ( and rightfuly ) that burning deserves an item too . 
  lets not start this ... 
  edit : ok let burning aside . 
  someone will say the same about dendi or xhao or whatever ... if you start this you cant end it . 
  i do n't think a few thousand more clicks worth the triggering . 
  i already lost the hype . 
  seriously , this is not good marketing . 
  first of all , now eveyrone flames them and nobody cares about fear 's retirement . 
  it ld been filled with threads and even if they had announced the roster . 
  we are talking about reddit here . 
  as someone else said ti did n't exist at his prime . 
  moreover , if it wasnt burning dota might not have been the same in china . 
  he inspired people there just like dendi did in the west . 
  he was the best carry for a long time . 
  i deleted the thread but [ here you are ] ( https://youtu.be/ujzymi1zb9s?t=2017 ) . 
  keep in mind that the scene is before the 1st international ( 2011 ) with a price pool of 1,6 million dollars . 
  the documentary was realesed 2 years later . 
  2 mins later actually, 
  the international 1 was the biggest event in esports history because it was the first event with so much money . 
  valve , took the shots for the documentary before the international and released it 2 years later . 
  i posted this because this guy which is a legend for dota players retired today . 
  i also chose this particular picture because many people have seen this documentary without having played dota . 
  moreover , i did it to highlight that beside the fact that he was kicked from his house , he did n't gave up and in the end he succeed . 
  he was kicked from his house dude ... not from his team . 
  [ here it is ] ( https://youtu.be/ujzymi1zb9s?t=2168 ), 
  his mum says that she kicked him from the house . 
  what is so difficult to understand from the link above ? 
  oh pld where did you go ? 
   what are your expectations for them going into this major ? 
  depends ... i really hope they will go very far , but i expect them to do very well at the group stage but be eliminated right away . 
   how would you describe their play style ? 
  aggressive with teamfight elements, 
   which are their key heroes and what are their strongest lineups and strategies ? 
  key heroes :, 
  madara : jugger , slark , void, 
  thug : dp , qop , puck , invoker , od , ta ( seriously ... i do n't know whats going on with this guy this year ), 
  skylark : beastmaster , bat , darkseer, 
  spartan : io , disruptor , earth spirit, 
   strongest lineups :, 
  everything with bh/riki and io is their confort zone . 
   what are the biggest challenges they face going into boston ? 
  dealing with theirselves . 
  madara is gon na wreck some anuses ~ ~ tomorrow ~ ~ in two days . 
  prepare your anus !, 
  how small is your dick and you choose to support the best team ? 
  ask puppey how small are our dicks .
