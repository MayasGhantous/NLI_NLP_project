  he enjoyed them . 
  first 2 and last 2 as you see the groups play together . 
  you said :, 
   i know a guy who knows a guy about the patch . 
  i 'm going to leak some details . 
  so you are not the patch tester . 
  i doubt that a proud / r/the _ donald member would be that smart to even understand what patch testing is . 
  and eurobasket 2005 and world cup 2006 ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ eurovision ^ ^ ^ ^ 2005, 
  dude ... can you not post the same shit 20 times a day ? 
  spartan is fucking crazy . 
  [ nah ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/boston_major/2016/main_qualifiers ), 
  people are overreacting . 
  dota is not as addictive as they think . 
  the average player will play now and then when he feels like it . 
  it 's not like the game makes you want to play all the time . 
  after 2-3 games you will bored . 
  i am hyped as fuck . 
  spartan played like a fucking god . 
  yep ... everyone played really well but i think spartan played godly on ogre . 
  madara and spartan ... 2,5 years playing together . 
  what a duo . 
  to be fair , it was not his fault . 
  he did whatever he could with that am . 
   not really , vp is cis, 
  that 's some na geography . 
   dc is na, 
  with 4 european players . 
  yeah soz , i just edited it . 
  alright , glad i checked . 
  i know what you mean . 
  i believe it d be better if they were changing groups . 
  one game group a , one b etc. 
  where is he ... did he die ? 
  in dota where the money is way more , top dota teams go there for the relaxed environment . 
  they love the summit because they have fun . 
  [ this is how they do it there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsx9nrebtmk ), 
  ^ ^ ^ ps : iamhyped, 
  yeah ... if it is just for tomorrow it is a pitty . 
  well , you should go the final . 
  you can still find tickets if you want but you might need to pay a bit more . 
  for 10-20 dollars extra it is worth it in my opinion . 
  you know better tho . 
  nah ... you can find normal people on facebook . 
  i saw someone to sell saterday tickets for the actual price . 
  / u/blinkfro i saw 4-5 posts at the official facebook event from the pgl . 
  moreover in discord there are some guys that are selling but probably more that are willing to buy . 
  700k without the ingame viewers ... there you are . 
  happy now ? 
  no it was n't ... stop saying bullshits . 
  only ti has so big numbers . 
  show some stats or gtfo . 
  your last 10 posts say the same thing . 
  did he fuck your mom or something ? 
  your sister maybe ? 
  vigoss replaced funn1k in empire and his last team was walrus punch in 2015 . 
  edit : if you google their names you will find info for all of them . 
  fujiapples has n't played a single dota game for the past 6 months . 
  he returns now and then for 1-2 games and then disappears . 
  broodstar is high mmr player but i do n't know with which name he is playing . 
  he was ranked 1st am in dotabuff and he had a guide about a year ago . 
  mnt said that for skylark . 
  lol ... he is probably the best player on the team . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  lol ... electronics are in the same level as north europe . 
  seriously ... it is comperable . 
  the common currency and the biggest taxation does n't help greece . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.public.gr/cat/computers-and-software/laptops/ ) is the most popular store in greece . 
  right click -  translate to english and compare the prices to the equivalent german store . 
  you must be really braindead to believe that group stage does n't matter after what happened in this major . 
  just saying ... 
  no , it will kill the hype . 
  i did n't say that it does n't suck . 
  it makes the games more passive too . 
  i said that group stages matter a lot . 
  dude ... are you mentally retarded ? 
  what you said has nothing to do with what i said . 
  play offs matter . 
  the ti6 champion got eliminated because of playoffs . 
  fuck you son of a bitch, 
   economics . 
  politics *, 
  eh ... come on . 
  eurobasket 2005 , world cup 2006 ? 
  fiba world cup when we owned us at the semi-qual and lost to spain at the final . 
  usually , in the final day they do n't show anything . 
  that was mnt and he did it because he got hit by spartan 's headset earlier that day at another win . 
   13 if you do not count resolut1on as eu but cis, 
  rip geography . 
  cis is in eu . 
  people confusing continents with regional organizations/unions ( whatever ) . 
   because everyone has their own definition . 
  are you kidding me ? 
  europe is thousands years old . 
  the name is based on greek mythology . 
  noone has his own definition . 
  a continent is a continent . 
  that 's like arguing that canada is not in north america . 
  [ this is europe since forever ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe ) . 
  3 european teams left ... how do you feel ? 
  no ... it 's defined the same by everyone .
