  i see , alright . 
  for anti-eco ? 
  why , you can take an eco player down with every other weapon pretty fast , you do n't need a zapper for that . 
  in an eco , you can hide in a corner and kill the first enemy who runs by and then grab his weapon . 
  yea , some of those deagle kills looked ridiculous . 
  nice vid , post some more frags !, 
  i 've seen a few people with all achievements . 
  pretty sure you do n't need a special hack for that , not sure how it works , just heard something about an steam achievement unlocker program . 
  vector based . 
  it basically calculates where the bullet would land compared to where the player has his crosshair and moves the crosshair the same distance in the opposite direction so the bullet will land on target . 
  for the hacker it just looks like he 's shooting straight , but for spectators his aim looks very `` wobbly '' and goes in random directions really fast . 
  oh damm , that was you !, 
  i saw it already , 
  well , you basically prove the deagle is still useful if you use it right !, 
  i could never do that though . . 
  a computer ca n't produce completely random things though . 
  they are pseudo-random , but you can still calculate it . 
  some aimbots are defenitely able to calculate the spray , since i 've seen some that make you able to headshot anyone while running and jumping around with a negev in 1 bullet . 
  well , the part i usually look at is the armsrace/demolition achievements . 
  i 've seen people with those that only played csgo for around 60 hours . 
  no way you can play 5000 games in 60 hours . 
  that makes sense . 
  i have no idea how they actually work , but i read what i said above on this sub before . 
  no , it 's not proof tht ** all ** russians hack . 
  it 's proof that ** one ** russian hacks . 
  personally , i 've seen more non-russian hackers than russian hackers . 
  such biases are just idiotic . 
  in matchmaking deathtalk is on . 
  ( or however it 's called ), 
  insufficient evidence . 
  yes , there are fishy parts , but from what it 's worth they might just be luck/bad interpolation . 
  i believe that in cases like this were you just ca n't be sure from the few overwatch rounds you get , you just have to tick `` insufficient evidence '' and move on , even if you think he 's hacking , because it 's still too likely that he 's innocent . 
  if he cheats , we need to trust on vac to eventually find it out . 
  i think you did n't get the joke . 
  he died more than once each round . 
  how 's that even possible ? 
  why do you think it is op ? 
  sure , it 's damage per second might be higher than the awp 's , but it 's a 2 shot kill , the awp kills you faster . 
  it 's only frowned upon in low-level matchmaking because it is a lot easier to use . 
  just like the p90 is frowned upon : not because it is superb to rifles , but because it is easier to use and you can just go for those lucky spray & pray kills . 
  mind you , it can be better than the awp in certain situations , especially against rushing t 's and for wallbanging/shooting through smoke . 
  i 'd actually like a weapon like that , 1 shot hs kill but semi-automatic , but it would have to be a lot cheaper than the scout is right now because it 'd be less effective without the scope . 
  alternatively , they could just increase the noscope accuracy like in 1.6 or something like it . 
  that 'd probably be the better option . 
  does anyone know * why * they actually implemented it in source ? 
  ( was it in 1.6 ? ), 
  i mean ... it 's just making your life harder really . 
  not like there 's any dark spots in normal css maps . 
  or were there maps especially designed with the nv in mind ? 
  there is lag compensation in csgo , meaning you wo n't have it as bad as you could have . 
  still , ping is always gon na affect you negatively . 
  i 'd say 90 is still bearable if you play competetive just for fun and not really seriously . 
  but yes , it will always hinder you . 
  you say that you have 6mb down , on speedtest.net you only get .4 though , that 's not right . 
  maybe there 's something wrong with your connection ? 
  call your provider if it 's always that low and try getting it fixed . 
  i know . 
  it 's still hillarious to see that though :p, 
  i wonder how they let the game calculate the numbers that they can get that off . 
  atm , the stats are so useless and broken , they might aswell take them out of the game , imho . 
  pretty sure bots do n't count for your deaths/kills . 
  they do n't for the scoreboard , but yea , maybe they still use them for the stats !, 
  that would be a looot of bot-deaths though to push that number above 1 . 
  yea , bots would be most likely . 
  unless the stats are just * that * screwed up . 
  would n't surprise me either . 
  that sucks : /, 
  good luck , hope your provider can get his shit together !, 
  you guys make great videos , and `` the incident '' does n't make them any less . 
  keep them coming !, 
  i hate it when people post videos like that on reddit ... 
  no , i do n't want to wait 2 seconds longer to load youtube !, 
  to explain the downvotes : warowl has posted this here before . 
  no need to repost . 
  i got a gaming laptop aswell , bit better specs even , but i 'm only getting around 100 fps all the time !, 
  : / got everything on low aswell , even shadows turned off , a bunch of launch options that are supposed to boost your fps aswell . 
  specs for reference : i7 3610qm 2.3 ghz , 8gb ram and 3gb gtx 670m, 
  any idea why i get up to 200 fps less ? 
  yes . 
  1920x1080 , 120hz monitor . 
  thought it was the cpu aswell , makes sense . 
  oh well , thanks for the link . 
  uhh ... 
  i 'd rethink that . 
  unhealthy food is unhealthy . 
  doing sports is just one part of a healthy live . 
  eating healthy is another one . 
  doing exercise regularly does n't mean you have a license to eat what you want , eating healthy does n't mean you can lie around all day . 
  does n't work on our server either . 
  when it came out , it used to just crash the server , then they `` patched '' it , now it just does n't do anything . 
  people need to read the rules . 
  you can edit self posts . 
  just put the link in the post . 
  that 's why my logitech mouse driver shows up with the company name `` logicool '' !, 
  always wondered about that . 
  yep , i was \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  sorry for the misunderstanding . 
  2 ) depending on your monitor and rig , it is not necessarily good to not cap it . 
  if his framerate would otherways go from 60-80 up and down all the time , it makes sense to cap it there . 
  if his monitor is only 60hz , more frames do n't necessarily matter either .
