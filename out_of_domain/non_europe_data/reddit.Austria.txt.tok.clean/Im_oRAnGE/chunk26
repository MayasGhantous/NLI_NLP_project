  ios in a nutshell . 
  i 'd rather have colored lamps !, 
  is that your goal ? 
  not sure how this is supposed to happen ... 
  if he blatantly cheats , everyones gon na vote yes , if not , then not . 
  that 's what overwatch is for and how it 's supposed to work . 
  people are supposed to select the option that everyone thinks is right . 
  for non-blatant hackers there 's still vac . 
  nice analogy . 
  nvm then :p, 
  i see what you mean . 
  valve can ( and has ) implemented traps for that . 
  basically they put a few clips in where they already knew that he was/was not hacking . 
  everyone who voted wrong on those had their score impacted quite a bit i assume . 
  this makes me want to play with kerbals again ... 
  that 's ... impressive . 
  and kinda sad . 
  edit : well , he posts in / r/fabulousferds ... that explains everything . 
  yea , they even used a few clips from professional matches i 've heard , you know , to make it extra difficult , 
  please read my answer to the guy below , sorry , i 'm on mobile and too lazy to rewrite it here . 
  doedge, 
  there is the only answer that ... + the only answer that ... = there only answer that ... 
  haha , i think i 'll try some more specific subreddits later . 
  thanks for the insightful answer !, 
  very much what i was looking for , 
  that makes sense , thank you !, 
  i actually looked it up after commenting and saw it , looks very awesome , 
  i have n't actually bought it myself yet , will probably have to buy it very soon though haha . 
  same for me , not for 4 of my friends . 
  so frustrating , we are 5 in a lobby , all of us but me have their rang displayed . 
  if i 'm in the lobby with them , we ca n't find a match , as soon as i leave , it finds a match for them 4 in 3 seconds . 
  edit : now they all have no rank , after restarting the game !, 
  also nobody can find a game . 
  stop beating a dead horse ... 
  that 's not the problem non-smokers _ usually _ have ( with smokers ) . 
  okay , i know some redditors do n't read an article before posting ... 
  but not even reading the title ? 
  i see it kinda like people judge fat people . 
  i 'm not saying i do it , but some people do . 
  but with smokers and non-smokers there 's also the eternal fight about who owns the air inside bars and restaurants . 
  my country has around 50 % smokers ( austria 's time to shine ! ), 
  and has quite lax laws about smoking inside , so i really have to deal with a lot of smoke and i 'm getting sick of it . 
  picking on smokers outside of that is really not something a smoker can whine about , considering what non-smokers have to put up with . 
  yea , my point is just that here , non-smokers tend to hold a little grudge against smokers because of what i said before . 
  i completely agree though , if people want to smoke , that 's their own business . 
  people need to accept that . 
  i just now realised that ** w ** ednesday , ** t ** hursday , ** f ** riday forms `` wtf '' . 
  i 've been learning myself some python basics , but i have no idea how to actually do anything with it except solving difficult math problems ( projecteuler.com , made the first ~ 60 ) . 
  no idea what else to do with it . 
  \\ + kick him in the last round . 
  you know , downvoted stuff gets hidden eventually , and upvoted stuff goes to the top , so they do matter in terms of visibility . 
  dammit , until halfway through i did n't realize this was about dayz , since i did n't check the subreddit . 
  then it got weird haha . 
  nice . 
  after some testing i noticed that redstone updates break your machine , for example if you have a redstone clock next to it , it wo n't work . 
  if i stop the clock , it works again !, 
  what really looks wrong to me is the fact that he suddenly stands on his feet again . 
  no matter how often i see that gif , i always have to grin . 
  the search bar is your friend . 
  this is mad fun . 
  make another post when you get some more updates out !, 
  also , european server ? 
  oh , and chain smoker !, 
  where 's that ? 
  well , judging just by the video he actually missed that critical shot . 
  even watching it frame by frame , he just shot a little bit to the right of his head . 
  might just be gotv , or youtube , or whatever 's fault , but from the evidence i have he just downright missed the shot . 
  not much to discuss here . 
   get a bike into a corner, 
  okay , got ta try it sometime . 
  thanks, 
  dae h8 apple ? 
  it 's not like you actually stated why you did n't like the macbook except that it was too small for your hands and that the touchpad is somehow crappy . 
  also not sure what your anecdote has to do with the picture , except that it has a mac in it , or this subreddit in general . 
  how is this about how they perform ? 
  you 're not very bright , are you ? 
  that gun is loud as fuck . 
  source : dayz . 
  you do n't fool me , ferd-loving troll . 
  upvoted you haha, 
  is it just me and 2 friends , or is anyone else also getting massive lag spikes in mm every 30 seconds ? 
  i 've heard from a few people that they are n't experiencing it , and from a few others that they have the same problem . 
  indeed , that looks weird . 
  for some reason i think it would have been even better if you would 've died from fall damage right after stabbing him !, 
  i 've seen the second one before , that 's what i thought would happen !, 
  you got ta try harder than that . 
  cute , but no gold for you . 
  hahahaha , that is a very useful screenshot . 
  anyone else having immensly long loading times ? 
  looks like a severe case of reddit-hug . 
  how can knowing that fact reduce the amount of brain cells he is loosing every day ? 
  hahaha thanks for putting that image in my head . 
   that means black is the actual color of the fur , and the white patches are simply the areas that lack pigmentation [ ... ] . 
  in other words , the fur is actually white , only where it has pigmention it is colored black . 
  so it 's still black on white , not white on black !, 
  yep , i do n't watch a lot on twitch , but every time i do actually want to watch something , it either laggs horribly or is only avaible in 240p . 
  \u2593 \u2593 \u2593 \u2593 \u2593 \u2593 \u2588 \u2591 2 spaces after \u2591 \u2591 \u2588, 
  \u2593 \u2593 \u2593 \u2593 \u2593 \u2593 \u2588 \u2591 \u2591 \u2591 each line !, 
  nah you messed up again , if every second line is empty it does n't look as nice as if you had 2 spaces after each line . 
  not sure if it works without res , but try pressing on `` source '' below my comment to see how i did it .
