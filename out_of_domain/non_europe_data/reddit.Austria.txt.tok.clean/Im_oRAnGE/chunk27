  same here , even at round start where you were supposed to always see your teammates names after one of the last updates ... just another bug . 
  nice , you are now coo !, 
  why did n't they include the '' % daily value '' for sugar ? 
  \\* coughcough \\*, 
   toast landing butter-side-down is due to the butter side weighing a little bit more than the non-butter side, 
  that 's not true . 
  the mass of the butter is so small , it might aswell not be there . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buttered_cat_paradox#in_reality ) the actual reason . 
  it does not . 
  it 's still supposed to work , is it not ? 
  the repeaters are all at 4 ticks . 
  it should work just fine , if i remove the top row or the bottom row the clock works , why not when there 's basically 2 clocks in one ? 
  80 fps steady . 
  redstone should n't be affected by low framerate anyways . 
  well , it 's basically 2 clocks . 
  the bottom two are a clock and the top 2 are a different clock . 
  but since both clocks work at the excact same speed ( 4 ticks on/4 ticks off ) , it should theoretically work just fine . 
  even if you input a 2-tick pulse , it gets stuck after 1 cycle . 
  and i know that the bottom ( or the top ) row is n't needed , but that 's not my point . 
  it 's still supposed to work just fine as a clock , but it does not . 
  why ? 
  it 's nice that you made a video , but i am no redstone noob . 
  i know why it actually stays stuck once it is stuck , but not why it gets stuck in the first place . 
  remove either the top or the bottom repeater and you get a normal clock . 
  combine those 2 clocks , which both go at the excact same speed , and it should still work , but it decides to get stuck because one of the repeaters does n't turn off fast enough for some reason . 
  that 's what 's confusing me . 
  edit : [ here 's ] ( http://imgur.com/rten4uw ) a screenshot from your video , notice how the bottom repeater turned off already , while the top one did n't ? 
  that 's why it 's getting stuck in the end . 
  remove the bottom or the top repeater , and the clock works just fine . 
  no , i was n't really trying to do anything . 
  i was just messing around with redstone when i stumbled upon this problem . 
  of course it is , if you think logically about it , it is supposed to work , but it does n't . 
  i 'm not sure you actually understood how my clock is supposed to work . 
  i 'm not trying to make a 12-tick clock !, 
  i have the same problem , but with 5 random pictures . 
  not sure why , but they are in a seperate folder on my iphone and are un-deletable .

  he tailgated so closely that he did n't see the concrete barrier .

  that 's why it 'd be smart to wait at least 10 minutes until you queue up again after facing an obvious hacker , especially @ your rank where the playerpool is smaller . 
  just a tip for the future . 
  did n't know fifa 14 was recieved so bad . 
  have n't actually played it yet . 
  how come they say `` pc machines are n't powerful enough for the new ignite engine ? '', 
  it 's not like the xbone or even ps4 are more powerful than a good pc . 
  just push them into blocks and the items float up to the top . 
  well it definitely works with glass :, 
  uhh , no , it works just as well with solid blocks . 
  people just like using glass so you can see the items going up . 
  enormous ? 
  it gives 300 per kill , that 's not enormous .

   we think we need a minimum of 15 fps, 
  that minimum is a bit low :(, 
  you will probably like this guy then , 
  ( yes , his videos are mostly over 20 minutes long , and he 's currently at nr . 
  yup , i agree , i 've never actually seen them fixed . 
  although they once put it in the patch notes , afaik , but it was a while back . 
  hahahaha , well , that was probably the longest smoke kill i 've ever seen . 
  i have no idea , to all of your questions . 
  i think i actually found him on reddit , i 've never actually watched more than 15 seconds from any of his videos , but it 's always a fun topic to bring up .

  thanks , now i see a lonely pair of legs in red trousers standing on a beach watching a giant lady crawling through the water on the horizon . 
  thank you , i found it infuriating how short the slow-mo shots in op 's vid were . 
  1 second slow-mo , then 1 second 10x speed , followed by another second of slow-mo , just confusing as hell . 
  yeeeaahhh , kinda like that . 
  how the hell do you do that ladder jump on nuke at ct ? 
  i 've seen it before in a phoon vid , if i remember correctly , i 've tried it out so many times now but i ca n't land on that shelve , and this guy can do it backwards . 
  : / that 's not helping , there must be a technique or so . 
  i do use w + d , but i always crash into the blue metal bar thing . 
  ca n't strafe far enough around , and if , i loose all my speed .
