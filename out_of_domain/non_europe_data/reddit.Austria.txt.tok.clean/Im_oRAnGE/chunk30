  think of it this way , the building is n't square like usual buildings , but triangle-shaped , what you 're seeing is a sharp corner of that triangle . 
  from above , the building 's formed like a slice of pizza . 
  needs more photoshop . 
  hahaha i would love to see a zombie just randomly falling over , maybe even falling off some stairs or something . 
  that would be hilarious . 
  should be pretty rare though to keep the hilarity factor high . 
  i know and hate that bug . 
  i do n't think they even fixed it in arma 3 , it 's infurating . 
  makes flying in 3rd person incredibly stupid . 
  every time you lean too far to the left or right , your camera just goes nuts , and suddenly you are looking back instead of where you are flying , even though you did n't move your mouse !, 
  it 's so weird . 
  been building on this theme for a while now , adding stuff every now and then . 
  thought it would be time to show it off !, 
  there 's a lot going on , so if you interested in any specific skin , just ask !, 
  since pretty much everything is heavily modified though , i will probably have to make a skin pack or something . 
  fully oc is everything in the bottom right corner and the e-mail notification , everything else is at least * somehow * based on some skin i found on deviantart , but mostly edited to a great degree . 
  the lyrics-app will search the lyrics from the interwebs and then scroll by themselves as the song progresses , in 99 % of songs it will work very well . 
  if not , you can just scroll through them with your mousewheel . 
  the album-cover display has a few invisible buttons : clicking in the middle of it will open my musicplayer , mid-left is back , mid-right forward , top-mid is play/pause , and at the bottom there 's 4 buttons for volume control ( 25/50/75 / 100 % ) . 
  also , there 's a little progress bar between the artist 's name and the album cover , it 's a bunch of lines that will gradually move towards the right edge of the cover . 
  the temperature next to the cpu-graph/ram-bar is the cpu temperature , the one next to the weather forecast is the temperature right now ( around 2 \u00b0 c in austria atm btw ) . 
  * i 'll answer any questions you have by tomorrow !, 
  it 's not about realism , it 's about making the game more fun . 
  also depends on which woods you go to , btw . 
  i used to use a pen and fucked up my old keyboard that way . 
  rip w key, 
  [ here 's ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ddrao#0 ) both plus the original that has white stripes instead of black ones !, 
  like summer storms , the sky 's as grey as leaves . 
  the river flood the banks and spill into the streets . 
  but the people laughed and swore that they 'd restore, 
  the city piece by piece . 
  and then the clouds gave way as if to agree ;, 
  when it rains it pours, 
  thanks !, 
  i was surprised how good it looked when i inverted the whole orange one , later i realized that it would look even better when the background stays black , it used to be white before . 
  seen a video yesterday where you could select 1080p , 1440p and original . 
  i just imagine having a loud-as-fuck bird tweeting noise every time somebody fires an as50 , haha . 
  ahem . 
   v. do not rehost webcomics . 
  you may provide an imgur mirror in the comments . 
  [ uranus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5unnpngsni ), 
  here 's one i made myself , it 's based on a skin by vcloud but it looks vastly different than his by now . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://imgur.com/pqqq6fz ) a screenshot ( edit : including my mail skin ), 
  it 's leading to a german newspaper at the moment , you just have to change the url in the [ feed ] section and change the `` text = der standard '' in the [ title ] section . 
  be sure to use a valid xml url or it wo n't work . 
  sounds like a challenge !, 
  no problem , hope you 'll like it !, 
  here , have scrolling news v1 .0 !, 
  gtg to sleep now though . 
  i used a german news site , but you can change it in the [ feed ] section . 
  hi , i 'm from austria . 
  i can relate so much . 
  used to be a very good writer , got straight a 's in german class from 5th to 9th grade . 
  in the 10th grade , i got a new german teacher . 
  grades went down to c 's all the way until i left that school after 12th grade . 
  dammit . 
  it might not work on anything else than my pc . 
  i 'll mess around with it once i get home . 
  i never got the hype aroundthe mario galaxy games . 
  they were fun and all , but it was just * so * easy . 
  i never finished the first one because i got bored by it . 
  there 's just so many 1-up 's and coins around the levels that i found myself racking up on lifes . 
  ( the new ) super mario bros on the other hand ... 
  you make me want to play galaxy 2 now , 
  my friend got a case 2 on the day they came out , he sold it for 10 $ s. 
  i get one not 24 hours later and it 's only worth < 1 $ by then - . -, 
  fun fact : he 's pulling the wife because she has no pedal things to put her feet on . 
  if she was facing forwards , she would have to keep her feet up . 
  this way though she can just kinda ` walk ' backwards while sitting , if that makes any sense . 
  why was it . co.uk in the first place ? 
  and what about nz ? 
  . co.nz for nz, 
  ahh . 
  so . co stands for commonwealth . 
  hide that taskbar , it looks so ugly with that skin ( and blocks the clock ), 
  i see , dismissed !, 
  would you mind testing my [ version 2 ] ( https://mega.co.nz/#!zy5t3r5r!deuvzwycep8-1lagtplajhn9clgewy5oprcb8dxvwoi ) ? 
  you 'd just have to change the variable for resolution ( standard is 1920 for 1080p monitors ) and maybe use a different url . 
  locked away by nazis maybe ? 
  where the variables are there 's also `` fontcolor '' and `` font2color '' , use a color picker like on [ this website ] ( http://www.colorpicker.com/ ) to find a color you like and replace my values with the ones you see in the box at the top . 
  then add 2 numbers/letters for transparency , going from 00 to ff , ff being 0 % transparent . 
  for example 000000ff is 100 % black , 999999ff is grey , ffffffff is white . 
  if you want to change the font itself , add a variable called font = * fontnamehere *, 
  for example `` font = calibri '' is what i have at the moment, 
  it should start right away after all the stories went by . 
  they go from right to left excactly once per minute . 
  to allow more stories , i 'd actually have to change stuff around a bit , at the moment i made it work best for a 1920 resolution : all stories at the moment take up almost excactly 1920 pixels next to each other . 
  if i added more , i 'd have to change some other code . 
  ( edit : the same goes for font-size by the way . 
  it 's difficult to make it work even when you change those variables around , but it should n't be impossible ), 
  it 's not impossible though , how many stories would you like to see ? 
  uhh . . 
  i feel flattered . 
  wait , am i black now ? 
  yea , like in all rainmeter skins . 
  you can also just use 1-255 , 1-255 , 1-255 for r g and b , for example `` fontcolor = 100,125,200 '' should work iirc . 
  not sure how famous that book actually is outside of austria . 
  * overestimate * redditors, 
  alright , so far 0 % famosity outside of austria . 
  i 've read it myself , then later we read it in class aswell .
