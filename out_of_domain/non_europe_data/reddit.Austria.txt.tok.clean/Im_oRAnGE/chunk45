  when a piston pushes a block away that has redstone on it , it should pop the redstone ( since pistons are part of `` redstone '' ), 
  what key you bind it to is irrelevant , what matters is the `` use weapon_knife ; '' before the `` use grenade '', 
  same in austria , but mostly it 's just ups cars i see around here . 
  have an upvote for your edits and for not deleting your comment when it went down !, 
  yahoo is still # 4 ? 
  woah . 
  * wallbang spot, 
  i cap it at the lowest fps that my game will always stay over . 
  so if your fps stay between 180-220 you may cap it at 170 for example . 
  mine usually stay between 80-110 ( at least since the arms deal update :( ) , i capped it at 80 . 
  on some maps i have to cap it at 70 or even 60 though . 
  as i said , i have to change it on some maps aswell . 
  what 's your framerate like usually ? 
  what frequency does your monitor update at ? 
  lowering your settings is a good idea in general :p, 
  i just always keep my net_graph up and when i notice that my fps jump around i lower the cap a little bit . 
  i 'll try , but can this damage the gpu in any way ? 
  it sounds like a good way to fry my gpu . 
  i 've never ever heard it being used that way , but your explanation a bit lower makes sense !, 
  it depends , you might want to just test each option individually , that is , lower each option at a time and check how many fps you 're gaining . 
  if you do n't notice a significant increase , you can keep it at high . 
  just opened up my laptop on the bottom and left it open while playing ... now the temp is staying around 60 \u00b0 and i 'm getting a bunch more fps ( still not what it used to be , but around 90-100 fps now ), 
  definitely a cooling issue , maybe something got stuck in an air pipe blocking the airflow out of the case ? 
  the exhaust of my laptop is on the back , but what helped was opening up the bottom and just leaving it open while playing . 
  it 's actually 40 \u00b0 c cooler now ... 
  hmm . 
  i 'm really unsure why it is suddenly getting so hot with the cover on . . something seems to be blocking the airflow . 
  wow , i 'm impressed . 
  keep us updated . 
  it stays on even if the record is already over . 
  damn , you beat mine by 1 . 
  it did n't go bankrupt yet , though . 
  you 'd think a smaller class would make it easier for the teachers to ... teach . 
  still , 3 out of the 9 students failed the final class . 
  would n't hurt i guess . 
  but then you can only detect what disc is in it while it 's playing . 
  well it would n't be nice if your allergies turned insane , right ? 
  she must be inside or you could see her twice in the picture . 
  if you want `` minimalistic '' , remove all the skins and add maybe 1 simple clock . 
  mhm . 
  anyways , i can probably help you . 
  do you know a bit of rainmeter code already ? 
  for 1. : right-click the animus skin , press `` edit skin '' ( or something similar ) . 
  it should open a document in the editor . 
  you want to look for `` solidcolor = '' for the meters that make up the links and change the rgb value to whatever you want . 
  the meter probably also contains a line that should look something like this :, 
  mouseoveraction = ! execute [ ! showmeter link1 ] [ ! hidemeter item1 ] [ ! redraw ], 
  now , look for the item called [ link1 ] ( or whatever it is called in that skin ) and change the `` fontcolor = '' to whatever you want . 
  ah , my bad , that skin is using an image as you have found out already . 
  should n't be too much work to change the color in photoshop though . 
  just use the `` fill '' tool with they grey you want . 
  also , ca n't see any code that corresponds to making the font red on mouse-over . 
  ~ ~ err ... not sure why it would do that , but try changing these variables : ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ so that they all have the same value . ~ ~, 
  i think i 'll just dl the skin myself and have a look though . 
  edit : ah , see http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/meters/button , the button meter basically uses the 3 frames of the button that are stitched together for the normal , mouse-over , and mouse-down images . 
  if you do n't mind loosing the assassins creed style , an easier way to make those things is by just using this template from one of my own skins :, 
  [ metertext ], 
  meter = string, 
  fontface = arial narrow, 
  stringcase = upper, 
  prefix = `` chrome '', 
  leftmouseupaction = ! execute [ `` http://reddit.com/ '' ] [ ! rainmeterredraw ], 
  antialias = 1, 
  and changing everything to how you want it . 
  also delete `` stringcase = upper '' if you do n't want it . 
  who knows if this is the same guy from the thread , it 's a new reddit account . 
  probably just a random troll seeking attention . 
  i found it really , really unsatisfactory that it ended before i could see it collapse :(, 
  same goes for ambulance services like the red cross in my city . 
  we ( paramedics ) learn how to safely remove motorcycle helmets aswell . 
  i 'm still waiting until they adequately replace worldedit in vanilla !, 
  i mean , the / fill and / clone commands are a good start , and you can do stuff with those that you could n't in we , but still , worldedit ( combined with the we gui ) was so much better for building stuff . 
  what the hell , apparently youtube automatically unsubbed me from you ( and like 50 other channels i was subbed to - . - ) ... good thing you post on reddit too , 
  you just made me log back into my old runescape account that is like 7-8 years old by now ... wow , that game has changed a lot . 
  i 'm still hanging abouts in fally with my rune armor and skimmy though , 
  and what is ? - foobar2000 - ? 
  it does n't ? 
  what , is it for membs now ? 
  it depends , some of the larger gifs ( 5meg + ) are still faster on mobile for me since gfy cuts down their size by a lot . 
  gor smaller ones gifs are better for mobile , yes , but i blame that on the implementation . 
  in theory , gfy should always load faster , it 's just not optimized for mobile use ( yet ) . 
  rule 1 . pleeease , i need that wallpaper , 
  at this point i often write the command i need in chat until it works and then copy it over . 
  this would make that redundant . 
  idk , i find most of the structures too buggy and gimmicky . 
  especially the desert and jungle temple . 
  witch huts at least added a new mob , but now they spawn outside of those aswell , so there 's that . 
  never been a fan of those and i 'd rather have some other new content , tbh . 
  i say we do n't need this . 
  `` freecamming '' will come with the spectator mode . 
  slow motion and rewind can be done with any video editing software . 
  and i have a feeling recreating the source system would be a fuckton of work for little use . 
  well , that 's excactly how the sponge used to work . 
  another emt here , he 's right . 
  in theory maybe you should stay put , but really when there 's an ambulance with sirens and lights coming up , the cars in the intersecting lanes will stop and you can safely move a bit into the crossing . 
  staying put will probably make you get honked at . 
  the general rule of the thumb is to just use your brain , _ do n't pannick _ and try to pull over as much as possible without hitting something . 
  why not available for mobile ? 
  just providing feedback .
