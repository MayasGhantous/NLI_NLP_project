  man , the people living next to that will find have dust everywhere for the next few weeks/months . 
  well , i 'd love the original wallpaper if you still have it . 
  ( also see rule 1 ), 
  thanks , 
  wallpaper gives me an error 503 though : / temporarily down . 
  he did n't write an / s or whatever . 
  deleting the comment at -1 , classy . 
  for the internet points !, 
  well here 's a til for you : there 's people on reddit that do n't live in atlanta or the us . 
  i love how madhiggins got downvoted to hell , but you , agreeing with him , got upvoted . 
  interesting how reddit works sometimes . 
  with the workshop they probably never have to hire another guy for skins again . . just somebody who picks the best ones . 
  that one 's better . 
  well , the right one is weird because the photo is n't front-lit , thus one half has all the shadows . 
  duplicating that half can only look weird since it looks like there 's 2 light sources that only affect the opposite side of the face or something like that . 
  it 's pretty much half sugar , half chemicals and flavouring . 
  i ' ve never heard that explanation before , i 'd love to read more though ... hmmm, 
  wikibot , what is deja vu ? 
  oh , i think he 's banned on here . 
  damn . 
  that 's actually quite good . 
  looks a lot more natural now , you know , for a perfecy symmetrical face , 
  my bad then , must 've looked at the quote below or something . 
  i 'm way too tired . 
  let 's try this :, 
  new bot , but works pretty good already !, 
  i know it does . 
  moderation is important though . 
  just like with coffeine !, 
  same with woman ? 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong ), 
  what if i eat my sand cake i just built ? 
  i 'm not sure how you would pronouce `` wo/man '' , tbh . 
  works just like for the other subreddits that do n't have flairs : he knows what gender users have that frequent one of askmen etc. 
  with flairs have , then he looks at which of those also are subbed to / r/globaloffensive and the distribution . 
  i 'd love to know the rank distribution in that sub ( from the flairs there ) . 
  but that would require a different program i guess . 
  because 24/7 daylight attracts the most players . 
  it 's kinda been in the mod like that aswell , btw . 
  the 3rd person ceosshair was always a little high . 
  tbh i still do n't get it . 
  i was n't really serious , 
  i was just asking : /, 
  oooohhhhh . 
  well thanks :p, 
  oh , do n't worry bout it . 
  that background is so out of place ... 
   in cs when you press forward you are immediately moving at max speed, 
  that 's not true  also , movement is clunky , it just feels floaty and inaccurate . 
  `` realism '' does n't excuse that for me , it just makes moving around feel weird . 
  ( again , might just be me being used to different games ) . 
  also not sure why you ca n't shoot while jumping ( why not allow inaccurate firing ? ), 
   shotguns ca n't snipe like they can in cs, 
  since when do shotguns snipe in cs ? 
  also , in this game there is n't the whole money thing . 
  shotguns have a place in cs ( go at least ) as an anti-eco or surprise eco weapon , in this game i have n't seen them used at all , for good reason . 
  they cost 1 point afaik , +2 for slugs . 
  quite expensive for a shotgun that does n't even instakill from ~ 5 meters . 
  have n't found much use in buying light armor so far , i seem to get insta killed with or without it . 
  with heavy armor i can at least take 2 lmg bullets , but it 's also very expensive . 
  and lastly , the mosin does n't seem to really have it 's place in a world where most maps are quite close-range focused or have heavy fog . 
  and even in the long-ranged ones are rifles with ap rounds still just as powerful , 2 hit kill and relatively fast recoil-reset . 
  tap , tap , dead . 
  also , upvote for actually answering me instead of just downvoting . 
  well , _ technically _ somebody posted it 13 days ago . 
  karma decay just did n't show it because he did n't post the imgur link and he got downvoted to hell anyways . 
  edit : also his link is down . 
  no , you 're a bad humor !, 
  thanks for giving me your view on the game , appreciated . 
  i 'm not gon na , it 's still fun , just got ta get used to it . 
  getting fed up on cs at the moment anyways , that game got it 's own problems ... 
  i remember completely blasting away tthe other team on cobble a few weeks ago . 
  everyone but 1 guy left , he was a really good sport about it and we did stuff like we were only using pistols or knives . 
  he just waited until all 4 got a cooldown  and we had loads of fun aswell . 
  pretty sure at the karma system does n't work like that . 
  afaik , a months old post would have to get millions , if not more , upvotes to get to the front page . 
  apart from the 15 second intro that nobody cares about . 
  that sounds really interesting , got ta try this when i come home . 
  somethings missing ...
