  to your first question : this depends on * everything * . 
  some wallpapers can easily be made only with photoshop , some use photographs as base and then you could add some different objects or effects , change the light etc. 
  i ca n't really make you one because i 'm very unexperienced with photoshop myself . 
  you should 've just read the sidebar though :, 
   have a request ? 
  try the cleverly named / r/wallpaperrequests !, 
  wtf nr . 
  no problem . 
  yea , they really need to upgrade the mobile app . 
  at least the one for ios is quite lacking . 
  or maybe it was iceland , ca n't quite remember . 
  nice wallpaper !, 
  also fitting skin . 
  the hours on the clock are kinda hard to read though . 
  ouch . 
  it looks like he 's using quite many :p, 
  but yea , i 'd like to know some too . 
  can somebody explain me why this is in / r/funny btw ? 
  as an european , it does n't go into my head how having more divisors makes a number more * practical * ? 
  if i want to say i 'm 1,75 meters i 'm not gon na say `` i 'm 1\u00a03/4 meters tall '' but just `` i 'm 1 75 '' . 
  thanks !, 
  nope . 
  iceland . 
  this is screaming for a flame war ... 
  why do you suddenly have to more precise ? 
  if the precision does n't matter , you can be just as sloppy with the centimeter rulers . 
  also , we have [ these ] ( http://www.zgonc.at/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_19582.jpg ) things , they are usually 2 meters long and not silly at all . 
  edit : i 'm pretty sure i do n't quite get what you are telling me , could you please elaborate ? 
  do n't get me wrong , it looks quite nice actually ^ ilikeblue, 
  also i 'm not a big fan of any soccer team , so i do n't care , but i know how aggressive fans can be . 
  good to hear you are not , 
  i 'd like to know , too , actually !, 
  i assume the delta-bot only looks at each comment once when it gets posted , not each time one gets edited . 
  wow , that 's a more convincing answer than i have thought to find here !, 
  austrian here : just to give you an example , you can get arrested for doing the `` nazi salute '' or painting hakenkreuze in a way other than for parody or art . 
  we are still quite sensible on that topic . 
  in italy , about 300 km from where i live on the other hand you can buy rings and cups with hakenkreuze and stuff like that , no problem . 
  it was quite shocking when i saw those for the first time at some random marketstand . 
  i can second etherfast . 
  did n't know anyone who played csgo when i started , after playing for a while and adding everyone who seemed nice , we actually have a little group going with ~ 10 nice guys who all speak my mother tongue ( german ) . 
  we have our own teamspeak3 server and are all around the same skill level , too . 
  ( and the worse in our group learn from the better ones , so they usually rank up quite quickly , too ), 
  sometimes in classic competetive , people reallly want to win , and if a player is so bad that having a bot ( who replaces the kicked player and can be controlled after you die ) is better for the team , they will sometimes try a votekick . 
  it 's an asshole move though and there 's almost always at least 1 person who declines so you wo n't get kicked . 
  also , after playing a few ranked matches , the game will have figured out your skill level and will put you together with mostly people of your own skill , which means things like this will happen a lot less . 
  you can align the launcher to the right by adding `` stringalign = right '' in the config file under each of the [ meters ] afaik, 
  please read the subreddit rules before posting :, 
   include in the comments download links to all skins and wallpapers used in your post . 
  think of a creative title that accurately describes your setup . 
  posts titled only with words such as ` first post , simple , minimal , or new setup ' will be deleted, 
  you might have to mess around with the x = and y = values , set them to something like 100 both , then -100 until you can actually see the text again , then adjust it until it looks good . 
  glad i could help , 
  if you have items with longer names you might need to push them a little bit more the right or they get cut off at the left . 
  not sure about that , but just select the skin in the rainmeter window and put some values for x and y , 500 each for example . 
  that will move them . 
  there 's just been a banwave and still the first game i played today had already an obvious aimhacker in it . 
  i mean one of those that just run towards the enemy base and 1 shot headshot everyone who dares to come around the corner ... 
  not saying i 'm unhappy about the banwave , but how can people hack already again ? 
  i mean the new ones :p, 
  if you activate them , just change the `` coordinates '' in the rainmeter window for the new skin . 
  it 's default to 0 0 . 
  so the hacks still * work * ? 
  they just get banned after a while when they use it ? 
  great . 
  please do n't make csgo f2p ... 
  why ca n't it ban obvious cheaters like speedhackers and blatant aimbotters though ? 
  especially if the cheats are detected ? 
  if you want to get picky , then the wallpaper is far from `` minimalism '' aswell . 
  [ this ] ( http://academic.udayton.edu/phillipmagnuson/soundpatterns/microcosms/micropix/min_mondrian.jpg ) would be minimalistic . 
  the problem is n't people like you who want to just try out the game . 
  you would get a low rank anyways and only play with people your skill level . 
  the problem is the hackers that get high ranks quickly because of their hacks and then get paired up with us who 've been playing this game for a while now and completely ruin the game . 
  they do n't fear getting banned bc they can just make a new steam account as long as the game is free . 
  have you ever looked at the ranks when a group plays against solos ? 
  the solos usually have a lot higher ranks just because of that reason . 
  you can still play arms race , demolition and casual . 
  giving all those cheaters access to a ranked system was just a bad idea , it ruins the game for those who paid for it . 
  you should n't get access to it for free on the expense of everyone who bought the game and wants to enjoy matchmaking on the weekend . 
   please award a delta if a comment has changed your view in any way . 
  you ** must ** also include an explanation for why you are awarding it . 
  wait , are these guys seriously just admitting to hacking ? 
  you meant `` i * would * have to hack to be even remotely ok . 
  but kenorii ? 
   i use aimbots myself so i think i can tell ... 
  * cough *, 
  just from watching the first few minutes of the demo :, 
  * from what i 've seen you hold short from the same position every round . 
  switch around a bit , you may even go more aggressive from * time to time * and push up towards catwalk to surprise them ( watch out for lower tunnels though if you peek mid ) . 
  i 've caught people with their knife out running along the catwalk already . 
  do n't go overboard though . 
  * around 8:30 you just run towards an enemy without even trying to shoot him . 
  did you not see him or are you lagging so much ? 
  the demo in general looks very laggy , not sure if that 's just the demoviewer though . 
  in general though , if you can improve fps , your aim will also improve . 
  ( also depends on your monitor , if you have a standard 60hz monitor , anything that exceeds 60fps by much wo n't have an effect , a 120hz monitor is always better ), 
  * if you do n't even get 60 fps , that is quite a problem . 
  try lowering your video settings and even your resolution . 
  * there 's been a lot of threads and comments about how to get better in general on this subreddit already , the main things people always note are crosshairplacement , movement , playing deathmatch and watching pros play . 
  also , i really recommend to watch the videos of these youtubers :,
