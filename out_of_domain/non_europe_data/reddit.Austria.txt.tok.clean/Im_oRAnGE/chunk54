  been in the middle of nowhere before ( middle of australia actually ) , and yea , it was really dark . 
  at those light levels , you also see so many stars it 's unreal . 
  one of the most beautiful things i 've ever seen in my life was the sky in true darkness ... 
  / r/sex does n't want the askreddit crowd either . 
  not always , i 've seen some comments make a u-turn after somebody replies with something like : `` wtf why the downvotes i agree with him '' . 
  weird , i 've seen it a bunch of times in various subreddits already . 
  i never understood the hate over puns . 
  yea , some pun threads are pretty mindless and dumb , but i 've seen many , many clever and interesting ones on reddit aswell . 
  as a non-native speaker , it 's also always fun to scratch my head over some of the more obscure ones . 
  default reddits do no good to smaller subs . 
  it 's been proven again and again . 
  a smaller sub does n't want the masses of a bigger one . 
  they want to stay small to keep the quality up and make it easier to moderate . 
  sure was . 
  would like to see a bit more in go though . 
  never played 1.6 so i ca n't compare . 
  ftfy, 
  haha where did my s go , it worked before i edited in the ftfy, 
  good to know you 've got my back !, 
  mobile indeed . 
  i had the link working already , then i ninja edited to include the `` ftfy '' and must 've accidnetly deleted the last letter , 
  it 's the best feeling as a t when you just rush a with flashes and smokes and all that jazz , and once you 're on the spot you just go `` huh , where 's the ct 's ? '', 
  because the a players took to long to go up due to whatever reason haha . 
  not stupid , i 've wondered the same thing . 
  i mean , before he writes his twitch link in chat he even has his own stream up with the cheat clearly visible , how did he not notice that ? 
  makes sense , thanks for explaining . 
  please elaborate in at least 5 substeps . 
  '' \u00dcpsilon '', 
  i was in a game like that once . 
  we queued with 4 guys , had 1 random . 
  it was clear pretty quickly that two of the enemies had trigger and walls . 
  our random was like , `` do you want to win or what ? '', 
  before turning his rage hacks on . 
  i think we still lost because `` our '' hacker had a pretty high ping and they had 2 hackers , but we were just laughing pretty hard at the situation and sitting in spawn , waiting to see which hacker wins . 
  never heard about eq ( emotional quotient ) before , til . 
  just do n't replace the middle 4 stonebricks with the blue wool ... 
  same goes for top left, 
  there 's no save comments option on my mobile app ( alienblue ) . 
  is n't that a res thing ? 
  alienblue is a reddit app, 
  that 's true , but usually not the first thing that comes to mind when people see the symbol either way, 
  well , personally i 'm still waiting for updates to the zombie ai . 
  and movement fixes . . _ then _ it will be a completely different game for me . 
   was afk for a bit, 
  apparently he is n't _ always _ on the pc , 
  he gets two 10 minutes breaks per day . 
  faster ? 
  not really . 
  easier ? 
  yes . 
  everytime somebody posts this i wait for the loop to see if it 's the extended version . . 
  it never has been it so far :(, 
  yea , you posted http://gfycat.com/esteemedringedhoneybadger#?format=gif, 
  http://gfycat.com/esteemedringedhoneybadger gives you the html5 video . 
  i 've had the same happen to one of my bug reports earlier this month . 
  it 's sad how they just write them off as invalid , i 'd say if things do n't work the way they are intended then there 's definitely a bug . 
  in this case i would n't say the blacksmith 's house is poorly designed , but the code that decides which side is `` inside '' and which is n't . 
  there should be better ways to detect the inside of a house . 
  bananas and rice crispies sound like a healthy diet to me !, 
  no helmet ? 
  i can just laugh at the people that thought downloading a 3gb `` update '' was a good idea , especially during a tournament . 
  it was pretty obvious that it was just a mistake . 
  then you are eu1 and not eu2 ... 
  eu2 zone , not whole eu, 
  got it over a year ago ( my first cs ) . 
  just had my 555th mm win today !, 
  ( over 1.2 k h playtime if i 'm not mistaken ), 
  well , they just rolled out with a vac banwave ( according to / r/globaloffensive ) , so it 's definitely buying time for the hackers !, 
  do n't overestimate silver 1s ... 
  i 'm not even sure if they exist ... 
  you know , i hated the `` waiting out '' part in search and destroy when i used to play cod , but in this game everything 's so intense , you can watch your teammates and help them out or coordinate your team when you are dead , hoping they will get the kill or the defuse ... also , each round is max . 
  ~ 2\u00a01/2 mins long , so even if you die right away you 'll only have to wait 1-2 minutes on average . 
  eh , even at my eagle rank there 's only around ~ 40 % who will use voice chat , and maybe another 20-30 that type . 
  the rest is silent or non-english . 
  best you can do is get into a group that has their own ts channel or whatever , once you are 7-10 regulars you 'll always have a team to play with and you 'll also have the most fun this way, 
  i was playing alone in mm one day when i got queued up with some people speaking my language , they invited me into their ts and since then we 've been pretty much only playing together . 
  may i ask you what you get out of the money you invested in accounts and hacks personally ? 
  i 'm not here to insult you , just want to hear your side . 
  i 'm having loads of fun with this game since i bought it , i 'm not sure why somebody would want to ruin the game for themselves and others . 
  i 'm not sure what rank you are now , but i 've noticed less and less cheaters since the last summer or so . 
  overwatch and the untrusted thing seem to do it 's thing , at least against those blatant hackers . 
  i 'm eagle now and still rarely encounter hackers . 
  it 's sad to have you lost to the other hackers just because of the other hackers . 
  ca n't you see that you are doing the same thing to other , legitimate players now that once made you so angry ? 
  you are just wasting somebody elses 1 hour , while also wasting your own time . 
  excactly , do n't make one specific command for difficulty , just one like the / blockdata command but for chunks . 
  / entitydata would also be nice to have . 
  we should of course have selectors for the command , wether it 's called / regiondata or / chunkdata, 
  nah , according to [ this ] ( http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=10q240q730&amp;from=1349128800000&amp;to=end+time ) the playercount in the other cs games decreased just as much , it was most likely an issue with steam causing the drop . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=10q240q730&amp;from=1390431600000&amp;to=1391209200000 ) the same graph zoomed in on the drop . 
  it was [ jan 28th actually ] ( http://steamgraph.net/index.php?action=graph&amp;jstime=1&amp;appid=10q240q730&amp;from=1390431600000&amp;to=1391209200000 ) . 
  my guess is a steam outage since it affected source and 1.6 aswell . 
  case closed !, 
  there was this controversy around him when some guy somehow `` accidently '' gifted him a knife , and when he tried to get it back tweeday did n't respond . 
  naturally , the guy went to reddit to complain and whine , and his post got way too many upvotes . 
  many people got mad at tweeday that day , i do n't remember everything anymore but i believe his reaction was n't all that professional and made the whole situation even worse . 
  no idea how the whole thing ended , i think he got his knife back eventually though . 
  that did look quite intense even though i have no clue about the game . 
  funny , if the flairs are correct you are master guardian , not many cheaters around your rank . 
  even at mine there 's not that many .
