  [ thewarowl ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/thewarowl ) for gameplay and really nice commentary . 
  [ thewingr ] ( http://www.youtube.com/channel/ucbe54dv2jlcmwfg_29riu6q ) made a nice guide for beginners . 
  ouch . 
  yea with 100 ping and 25 fps i probably would do quite bad aswell . 
  bit off-topic : if you 're looking for a rig to buy/make and you 're not quite sure what to get , i suggest watching some tek syndicate videos like [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv60r_cs8kw ) . 
  they 've made quite a few videos like that for different priced pc 's and maybe it 'll help you make a choice . 
  + it 's a quite awesome tec channel in general . 
  no , that 's basically opposite of what you said . 
  ping does not indicate how frequently the client can communicate with the server , it just indicates how much each of the communications are delayed . 
  think of it this way : tickrate for a gun would be it 's rate of fire . 
  ping is the time the bullets take to hit your target . 
  if you start shooting at somebody with a weapon that fires 128 shots per second from close range , the bullets will hit the target 128 times a second almost instantly . 
  if you stand further away , the bullets still hit the target 128 times a second , but take a little bit to reach your target . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  just did the first 5 with javascript ... quite hard stuff . 
  not true actually , i did it once . 
  once . 
  how i got started :, 
  i downloaded a few skins that i thought looked cool and simple , and checked how they were coded . 
  messing around with a few variables and such helps you getting an understanding aswell . 
  also , be sure to check out [ this ] ( http://docs.rainmeter.net/ ) if you have n't already . 
  ( or is that the tutorial you mentioned ? ), 
  but yea , look at other peoples work to understand the basics . 
  ( i have basically no coding experience either , only ~ 1 year in high-school ), 
  i do n't think bots work if you reply to them . 
  they do n't fall for that . 
  but maybe we can call r/linkfixerbot ? 
  how is that proof ? 
  i 'm interested though , how do you get up there ? 
  sorry about that , was too lazy to look it up myself , thought there was no translation . 
  probably one of it 's best features . 
  i actually started using it before youtube started doing video ads , so when i heard somebody complaining about them for the first time i was wondering what he was talking about ... haha, 
  small bug : the % sign overlaps with the h in the bottom right corner . 
  apart from that , very nice desktop . 
  why do people use minus.com ? 
  gif 's are loading so slow on that website ... 
  for me the robotic movement and the `` windows '' gave it away pretty quickly . 
  ah , i forgot there was a limit . 
  minus loads stuff slower in general though , they 're servers are just a bit slower than imgurs . 
  but alright , if they have a higher limit i ca n't blame them . 
  yup , i want a static static crosshair . 
  one that does n't change with different weapons either . 
  weekly thread asking for forgive function ? 
  check . 
  every website that has an rss feed ( xml ) can be parsed via the [ webparser ] ( http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual-beta/plugins/webparser ) plugin . 
  the only email client i know that has an rss feed is gmail though , hotmail and yahoo wo n't work . 
  most news sites have an rss feed though , twitter most likely aswell , not sure though . 
  nobody will be able to help you if you do n't show us the wallpapers ... 
  or just use a color that none of the wallpapers use ? 
  cyan ? 
  pink ? 
  you said excactly what has been said 10 times before already . 
  you did not come up with anything new . 
  oh yea i 've noticed the quality loss before . 
  alright then , no big deal anyways . 
  some gifs just look awkward when they load slowly . 
  i see a lot of black , white and blue , but they are really quite varying . 
  try orange , maybe pink/violet or bright green ? 
  also depends on where you put the skin . 
  i think you need to use this program ( for win7 ) called start button changer : [ direct link ] ( http://cl.ly/dddz ), 
  stealing that background , thank you !, 
  so ... 4 different skins for cpu and 3 for ram ? 
  this needs some cleaning !, 
  ^ ^ wow this is useful, 
  yea that 's an argument , i also have 2 clocks , one bottom left of one monitor , the other top right of the right monitor . 
  if you need a border , you could add stuff like an rss feed for some news station or even reddit ( [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/.rss ) ) and/or some weather skin . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/weg4grn.jpg ) how mine looks at the moment , for example . 
  made most of the skins myself \\ ^ \\ ^, 
  huh ? 
  it does for me . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://minus.com/lbjno3eao0obsl ), 
  nice video , but the smoke is quite far back , if the t 's actually go b , woul n't they be past that smoke already before you see them as ct ? 
  put an empty line before the * list of it wo n't work ;p, 
   i think this is a bad idea because it makes my decision to donatie much , much less valuable, 
  so , you think it is a bad idea to have everyone donate organs ( which could/would save lifes ) just because it makes you feel less special ? 
   this clause means that it would be practically ineffective . 
  assuming that only people who needed a transplant changed due to this , it would result in a few thousand more potential donors , of which almost all of them would die in some way that was n't in a hospital , connected to life support , and therefore their organs could n't be used . 
  there are dozens of people who have donor cards and die for each one that actually donates their organs upon death . 
  why are those that opt-in because of that any different than normal organ donors from that point on ? 
  what also worries me is seeing so many nova/silver players here on reddit getting overwatch demos to watch while me and my friends ( all around my level ) do n't , even though we would like to . 
  i have the same problem as you though , i get called a hacker quite often aswell and i 've heard you ca n't participate in overwatch if you get reported often . 
  pretty stupid imo , the higher ranked players are , the more often they are gon na get reported even if they do n't hack . 
  his stats just say how many he reported as wallhackers out of the demos he 's got . 
  that one would be better , yea . 
  additional to surfings argument : once you reach car , the t 's have already pushed past that spot anyways so it will only cut off players that stay further back . 
  i agree with cyberbullying just being a buzzword for media and should n't be separated from `` normal '' bullying , but i disagree with your first point . 
  emotionally insecure kids ca n't just `` ignore '' that person or walk away from the computer . 
  if she/he is quite insecure already and then notices that somebody is talking shit about them say on facebook , that can really hurt them . 
  also , more people might see it than in school , it stays written in the internet , you ca n't delete it as the victim . 
  apart from that , it 's quite similar to `` irl '' bullying , i agree . 
  austria , 635 hours , 50 last two weeks , no overwatch : / * sigh *, 
  yup , i heard it often ... `` orange hacker , you knew i was there , report '', 
  aaaand no overwatch for me . 
  how the hell can you look backwards while walking forward ? 
  you ca n't turn your head without your body . 
  if somebody has wallhacks , he can use nades much more effectively , so why would he use them less ? 
  that does n't change the fact that i get reported almost daily . 
  i pull off a 3v1 ? 
  hacker . 
  i get a lucky p2k headshot ?
