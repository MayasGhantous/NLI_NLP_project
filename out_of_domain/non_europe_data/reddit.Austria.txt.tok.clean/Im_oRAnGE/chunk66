  ctrl + w for autorun , ctrl + q to lower your fov , ctrl + e to raise it , and five preset fov settings can be used by pressing ctrl +1 -5, 
  he 's set his fov to the lowest value possible to zoom in that far, 
  not to offend you , but this just shows how broken the fov trick is with the scopes . 
  i hope they will someday make the scopes fov fixed ( also so that we can use the range finder on the ak scope : / ) and maybe raise the lowest fov to something like 70 \u00b0 . 
  i think the lowest you can go currently is something between 50-60 , which is ridiculous . 
  damn your voice . 
  so ... soothing . 
  how could anybody attack somebody with such a voice ? 
  well , i do n't blame you for it , do n't get me wrong , i use it too ( posted my ahk script somewhere below even ) . 
  i 'm not sure what the difference between a 2d scope and a 3d scope in video games is , could you explain that to me ? 
  i 've never heard that term before until some reddit thread on here a little while ago . 
  oh so in 3d scopes you usually have just the scope zoomed in and the peripheral vision still at normal zoom level ? 
  plus they actually render the model of the scope . 
  have n't used an acog in ages now , i 'll try it out next time i find one ( and an m4 ), 
  yea , stupid = / = greedy, 
  let me know if it works for you, 
  i like it , it 's pretty quick and works reliably , although it seems to randomly activate voice chat from time to time for some weird reason , i have n't found out why that happens . 
  i have voice chat bound to capslock , no idea why it triggers it when i run those scripts sometimes . 
  i hope they do fix it , i like playing at relatively high fov , but then i ca n't really make out players that are further away . 
  the sliding itself is pretty annoying . 
  there 's just no friction at all currently . 
  plus he says in the title that he found the video , it 's not him filming, 
  uhh , i just got / r/spacelop ... not sure why it 's nsfw , but it 's weird . 
  i bought it for coop but my friends kinda lost interest once i got it , so i said fuck it and started it in singleplayer . . got pretty hooked . 
  it 's actually challenging on the hardest difficulty , but you can also get pretty stuck when you loose all your lifes and get to a savepoint which you just ca n't make with 1 life . 
  got around 12 hours out of it before moving on , but i 'll to get back to it to finish it sometimes . 
  hab , i did n't figure it would come from clop , that makes it quite hilarious actually . 
  welll ... about that bunker . 
  making a bunker with only one entrance , and then making that entrance a ladder was n't the best idea . 
  although campers had it easy . 
  also the railgun was ridculously op . 
  once i got my hands on one of them , i went to the dam and pretty much cleared the server . 
  i must 've racked up 20 + kills in maybe 2 hours on a 40 man server . 
  no bullet drop , no travel time , 1-shot kill , sniper scope . 
  wtf where they thinking when they added that gun ? 
  awesome for me and my group , yes , not for the rest of the server though  at the end of our session there were only 15 people or so left on the server , and my humanity was at -69 k. 
  why did you post the end of your video ? 
  also , why did you log out inside the firestation ? 
  it sounded like your game crashed but i 'm not sure . 
  idk man , logged into experimental and spawned in vybor where i logged out last time on experimental ( lost all my loot though ) , geared up there and went east . 
  i met 10 players in total on my hike , 7 of them armed and all of them were friendly . 
  had a chat with each guy and it was baffled that nobody even tried shooting at me even though i had some good gear ( hunting backpack and high-capacity vest ) . 
  one guy even showed me where i could find a blaze since i only had a sporter . 
  then again , i stayed far away from berezino . 
  the same saying exists in german . 
  the first hours with the game were probably the best thing about the game . 
  i remember staying over at my friends house who showed me the game , we ended up playing all night . 
  i was so hooked . 
  and that was in beta 1.2 , the game has come so far since then . 
  nope , he dropped it to the ground before actually . 
  yea excactly . 
  had to watch it twice aswell cause i thought the same thing at first actually . 
  haha , i love the little gasp before the screen turns black,
