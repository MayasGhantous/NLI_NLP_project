  i 've often seen the dotted underline . 
  no idea about standards though . 
  the comment is morphing ? 
  twitter videos do n't work at all on alienblue for me . 
  clicking on the video just refreshes the site . . 
  background ? 
  he 's on google images, 
  i do n't use twitter so i do n't have the app . 
  you can open it in safari aswell apparently . 
  but once it 's that much work i just go to the next link usually :p, 
  woosh, 
  super ? 
  aww that is so cute  thanks for sharing your story . 
  how is this even upvoted . 
  the transphobia is real . 
  you can often treat the disorder without removing any limbs , just by therapy , at least according to ops wikipedia article . 
  also , gid is highly controversial , some countries have even banned the use of the word disorder in this context ( for example france in 2009 as well as the council of europe in 2015 ) , indirectly banning the term gid . 
  it is a highly debated topic if gender incongruence ( that 's the proposed replacement term , or , as you said , gender dysphoria ) is even a disorder , and more and more seem to come to the conclusion that it is n't . 
  i do n't think it 's unfair to draw parallels to homosexualism half a century ago . 
  it has also come from being considered a `` treatable '' disorder to what we have now , and i do n't think we are worse for it . 
  i think it 's mostly a stigma issue . 
  transgender people have been facing abuse and still are . 
  calling it a disorder just opens the door for abusers to tell them there 's something wrong with them , that they are somehow sick and that yes , it can be treated . 
  it 's not that sexual preference and gender identity are inherently the same , but the stigma around it is similar . 
  most of the distress and dysphoria of gid/gender dysphoria comes from parents who try to `` make their kid normal '' , or from bullying and rejection from peers . 
  in a society where these problems would n't exist , gender dysphoria would probably cease to be a big deal . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176%2fpn.38.14.0025 ) an article about the whole controversy that describes the issue better than i can . 
  in old scripts the u often looks like a v , so it makes sense . 
  wow , that 's really cool , i did n't know pngs alone could do that . 
  i do n't think you reallly read the question . . 
  same with alien blue . 
  damn twitter . 
  i 've never had a good it teacher in high school , they were all utter shite . 
  they basically only had to do a 2-3 weeks training to get a license for the job . 
  one of them did n't properly know how to use word . 
  it was ridiculous , since he was supposed to teach us , but by that point ( it was in 9th grade ) everybody already knew how to use it far better than he could . 
  so we ended up having to help him show off certain features when he could n't get them to work ( eg . 
  drawing a line ) . 
  that 's standard markdown for ya . 
  blagtiq . . that sounds so wrong . . 
  nooot quite . 
  sounds like trackmania nations/united, 
  it also means `` hot '' or `` sexy '' depending on context . 
  it 's a weird word . 
  yea . . 
  if you tell somebody `` deine sonnenbrille ist geil '' , it can be translated to `` your sunglasses are cool '' or `` sick '' . 
  `` die anna ist eine geile sau '' loosely translates to `` anna is a sexy bitch '' . 
  sau is a female pig , we do n't use the word for female dogs in this context , 
  once again , look up the ghost cube . 
  you will see why it only needs one color . 
  a normal 3x3 does need the colors . 
  tb is n't immune to all criticism . 
  they bring up valid points , and while they do sound a bit butthurt i can understand why they would be . 
  they should 've worded it a bit nicer , i agree . 
  nutella is disgusting . 
  it 's literally about 50 % sugar . 
  i mean it tastes very good but i just feel disgusting eating it . 
  it 's not like ngos/not for profit organizations pay that much better . 
  i know several emts who work for the red cross who get shit pay in my country in europe . 
  it seems to be pretty universal . 
  i nust watched the one for game 3 , and it 's not a summary of the whole game , but only for the beginning . 
  they only cover the first 30 or so moves, 
  what the comment above you meant , is that alphago has no idea it 's playing a best-of 5 , and that it has won the first three of that series . 
  it will just play one game after the other , improving every time you feed data into its algorithms . 
  that does n't mean it knows the last 3 matches were part of a best-of-5 series . 
  better than dreamweaver . 
  at least for learning purposes . 
  i was wondering why this just would n't load on my phone . .

  he 's talking about [ teenage mutant ninja turtles \u2122 : mutants in manhattan ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/338400/ ) by the way . 
  it 's gotten pretty mixed reviews ( 66 % positive on steam ) . 
  itt : trying to do < insert activity here  but failing . 
  i 'd change the 2 meters top left . 
  they do n't really fit with the others , because of their black background . 
  i try to keep my meters in roughly the same style , for example :, 
  that 's 5 different meters , it almost looks like one . 
  when i change backgrounds , i usually also adapt the colors to make them blend in a little bit . 
  not really , sorry . 
  i usually just dig into the code and adapt the skins to my needs . 
  i 'd personally ditch the background/make it transparent . 
  but that 's up to you really . 
  not in austria ( and i believe germany ) .
