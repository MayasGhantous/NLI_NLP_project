  i spent hours playing phoenix wright on the toilet !, 
  [ this guy ] ( http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41589_296190853610_8690_n.jpg ) too . 
  `` abend '' means evening , and `` feierabend '' is the part of the day when you stop working . 
  apparently , americans sometimes call it `` beer o'clock '' . 
  well that 's depressing . 
  do the developers also love paris in the the springtime ? 
  look at his other comments , i guess . 
  there is n't a solution because it already happened . 
  and you ca n't complain if it did n't happen yet . 
  you can only prevent it from happening more often by complaining . 
  actually , i think another redditor made it . 
  this has been posted before , by the person who actually made it . 
  [ found the original one with only 100 . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/dlxru/100_classic_andor_famous_video_game_characters/ ), 
  [ and here 's an article about the second version with 200 . 
  ] ( http://geek.pikimal.com/2010/11/09/200-gaming-characters-as-mega-man-sprites/ ), 
  he 's in the middle of the picture . 
  come in !, 
  baby do n't hurt me . 
  whoa , i thought he meant the guy in the chat when i saw the picture !, 
  even so , why would you say that he `` ruined the joke '' just because he showed the guy ? 
  would it still be a joke if he did n't show him ? 
  you 're a gentleman . 
  no , [ this ] ( http://lvs.psshee.com/images/potato.jpg ) is . 
  phoenix wright . 
  what are you trying to say ? 
  because despite your violent behavior , the only thing you 've managed to break so far is the janitor 's heart . 
  i thought that the show was brilliant at the beginning ( because the concept was fresh to me , i guess . 
  ) , then it was only `` okay '' for a few episodes , but i think it got really good again when mikami appeared . 
  am i the only one who enjoyed the hell out of super paper mario and thought that it had the best plot by far ? 
  okay , the gameplay was n't as good as the one in paper mario 2 , but it was still really good !, 
  wait , * whoa * , andre is theo ? 
  [ the music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1gsketi1bg&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=87s ) made it so much better . 
  are you sure that pok\u00e9mon r/b/g is still the best selling game ever ? 
  the post is about four years old , and wii sports had a lot of sales too . 
  can someone please find me that forum thread where a guy went on a woman forum , and the women there said that `` you ca n't be sexist towards men '' , and he countered with good arguments , and then he got banned ? 
  the video shows [ wheatley on a computer screen , insulting the protagonist , while glados 's voice comes out of a potato . 
  a lot got spoiled there . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  nope , i know it too , and now i wonder why they did n't show footage of that . 
  why did it have to be spoiler footage ? 
  ( i already played the game , but that just proves that i at least consider that people get spoiled . ), 
  wow , that comic was egoraptor-esque . 
  especially like * this video . 
  i just tried to fix it , but it put the words in italics again !, 
  here 's the link : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxascjutnpe, 
  yeah !!, 
  i feel so energetic about hanging pictures !, 
  oh , for a second i thought that you shit on the cat because it was literally * in * the toilet . 
  a tas is there to show you how fast a level can be done without any tools or cheats . 
  of course , tas use tools , hence the name , but the speedruns can still be done without any tools . 
  it 's just very very very hard and frustrating . 
  but theoretically possible . 
  [ ] ( / blackhair `` because i kept screaming it ! '' ), 
  i could n't even sit still while reading that comment . 
  i even drew a picture of what i looked like while i read your comment : http://i.imgur.com/opvk8.jpg, 
  i really should n't have opened this thread . 
  ( but it 's so addicting ! ), 
  you have a massager !, 
  that 's not a massager . 
  well , yeah , that 's why he asked . 
  what did he say ? 
  and for the people who are wondering , [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/-db8wbr76jg ) is the `` awesome '' video with the face . 
  me too !, 
  he looks exactly like him !, 
  the hair , the shirt ... 
  is your username a maniac mansion reference ? 
  ( or zak mckraken for that matter . ), 
  yes , watch the first episode . 
  the bike chase sold it for me . 
  and just as a hint , whenever you do n't know the name of a song with text , just google one line from the song . 
  you will probably find the song immediately . 
  i remember using that method with [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zqne5iz0tc ) video ( which coincidentally uses a pendulum song too ) . 
  i just typed `` just wonder what we 've gotten ourselves into '' and found the name of the song . 
  when they 're dead , they 're just hookers !, 
  ... oh my god , i really did n't know who the guy was from just looking at him . 
  now i feel ashamed . 
  edit : oh , also , i 've never heard bohemian rhapsody before . 
  ama . 
  edit2 : just listened to it . 
  i realized that i already knew it . 
  i just did n't know that was its name . 
  i just love the last one : `` triple laser phase '', 
  it just reminds me of the [ forest temple ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxn88my50xm#t=16s ) music in ocarina of time . 
  probablyhittingonyou actually made [ this awesome list ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/fk2ir/can_we_have_another_favorite_jokes_thread_please/c1gibat ) a while ago . 
  you should upvote him and save the comment !, 
  very useful . 
  you might as well throw acid on her face !, 
  you pronounce `` heil '' like `` file '' , just with an `` h '' . 
  it would n't have been as funny if there was a period at the end of the sentence . 
  [ i 'm spiderman . 
  :( ] ( http://youtu.be/1eppiyjddwq ), 
  shows that they did it right . 
  i can confirm this . 
  he 's not 40 though . 
  yeah !, 
  thanks , jizzblaster boris . 
  there are people i do n't like . 
  when they die , and their relatives cry , i do n't go to them asking `` why are you crying ? 
  and now everybody 's happy !,
