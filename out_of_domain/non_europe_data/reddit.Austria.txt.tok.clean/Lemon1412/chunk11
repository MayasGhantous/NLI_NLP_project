  we do n't care where the metallic taste comes from ; fact is : it tastes like pennies !, 
  the first comic made me laugh more than the second one though . 
  i loved the english dub , especially moments like this . 
  the audio quality is a bit bad , but do n't worry , the top comment is a * transcript * . 
  `` what are you two doing ? 
  i thought you said something about a nice little slideshow ? '', 
  i do n't get it . 
  well , i should actually continue watching that show . 
  i only watched like four episodes of it . 
  whenever i see roy mustang , i say `` hey , it 's roy mustang ! '', 
  even though i know * nothing * about him . 
  because you can name your character and then there would n't even be a link in the game at all . 
  i expected him to shift his mouse slightly at the obsidian part . 
  what actually happened was funnier . 
  yeah , i thought that too after writing the comment ... 
  at least `` a link to the past '' has two meanings . 
  ** people who laugh at something that i do n't find funny . 
  ** and by that , i do n't mean that they laugh at something that you should take seriously . 
  no , i mean normal stuff like a joke on tv or something . 
  i do n't know why i 'm pissed about that , maybe i think that i 'm `` too good '' to laugh at a joke like that , but then i realize that they 're having more fun than me . 
  the website asks me to log in , it leads me to the login page , i log in , it leads me back to the page asking me to log in . 
  help ? 
  that kinda reminds me of [ the ugly barnacle ] ( http://youtu.be/g2u8yfkm9ny ) . 
  actually , there was a story on reddit about something like that once . 
  a guy jacked off when his female neighbor walked in and decided to blow him . 
  also , there were eggs involved and then he told his family he pissed on the floor or something . 
  does anyone remember that ? 
  edit : [ okay , i found the comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/d6dzv/10_hilarious_masturbation_stories_got_better/c0xwbhb ) but the guy archived it and now there 's just a picture of a dog there . 
  anyone know where you can view the comment ? 
  i ca n't even beat that on normal with no continues . 
  ( i 'm practising though !, 
  very fun game . ), 
  the review is n't helpful though . 
  it 's very entertaining , but far from helpful . 
  yahtzee from zero punctuation is a funny guy , but i would never watch one of his reviews to see if a game is good or not . 
  you should consider yourself lucky !, 
  imagine being a * bot * and having to read that stuff !, 
  [ here 's mine . 
  i had a lot of fun drawing this . 
  incredibly creepy if you do n't realize that it 's a gif . 
  well , at least they told you to blow there . 
  in cryptic language , but still . 
  that was actually a kinda satisfying puzzle to me . 
  for some reason i was expecting rammstein . 
  i pooped my pants , jeff . 
  * you ruined it , dave !, 
  how am i going to transfer my virtual console games to the new wii ? 
  is there even such a thing on the wii u ? 
  okay , thanks a lot !, 
  and why do you worry about flint and steel if you have so much tnt ? 
  i read this in swiper the fox 's voice . 
  hey , i just know it from [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wicocdouwqo ) . 
  let me ask you a question . 
  why would a man whose shirt says `` genius at work '' spend all of his time playing children 's video games ? 
  nope , i can see his shirt from here !, 
  edit : that was sarcasm too . 
  it 's a g made out of ore . an ore-g . 
  censoring spoilers takes almost no effort at all , so why not ? 
  what apout quests, 
  oooh !!, 
  now i know why i remember your name !, 
  you were the guy in the background who got hit by a woman !, 
   one of the creators actually frequents reddit . 
  which one ? 
  whoa , what was the comment ? 
  ( and do n't pull an `` it was me the entire time ! '', 
  on me . ), 
  it may make the blogger * happy * !!, 
  [ ] ( / wtf ), 
  just like the german `` gesundheit '' , which literally means `` health '' . 
  ( so we 're wishing health to each other too . ), 
  oh my god that was so painful to read !, 
  what was joron even trying to say ? 
  why did he sometimes write `` im bored '' and stuff like that ? 
  what 's with all the lines in his post ?!, 
  [ this ] ( http://cobaltium.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=1738&amp;pid=15389#pid15389 ) is the most annoying post in the thread in my opinion , because the `` not in a pedo way '' implies that the guy who wrote it is over 18 ( and very stupid for his age ) or he is n't 18 and just wrote something random ( which makes him even more stupid ) . 
  and in the same comment , he used his gavel . 
  he is n't saying that he 's better , he 's just saying what he does n't like about the video . 
  ( he did n't even say that he did n't like it ! ), 
  why would you think that you 're your own mom ? 
  that 's got ta be the worst case of incest ever . 
  well now i know that he does n't hate notch personally . 
  also , time passes . 
  see , that 's the problem with having german as your mother tongue . 
  i did n't get the joke with arnold schwarzenegger saying `` if you 'll be mozart , * i 'll be bach * . '', 
  because you have to pronounce a name incorrectly to get it . 
  i 've never really played demoman a lot until like a week ago , so the title is * kinda * true ... ? 
  maybe ? 
  then let the `` idiots '' laugh and have their fun ... ? 
  * let 's swap the bullet with this thing , sissel !, 
  in one episode , a fish drowned in the goo lagoon . 
  a comic on deviantart ( that won an award , i think ) that showed the lives of different people . 
  it showed one person growing up , then meeting another person in the future , then it showed that second person 's past ( and we saw the person `` shrinking '' so the comic could show that we 're `` going back in time '' ) , and so on . 
  just call me * hank * !, 
  i know what schadenfreude is but i 'm confused by your comment . 
  do n't take his comment as a suggestion , but just as a little fun fact . 
  of course speeding through the whole game with godlike powers within like one hour is n't in the spirit of the game . 
  i do n't know , i actually hear [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/8gdj_xyyu-w#t=4m44s ) music because i just found that video so funny .
