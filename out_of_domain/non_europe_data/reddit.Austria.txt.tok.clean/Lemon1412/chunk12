  ( i know it 's stupid , but i laugh at this every time . ), 
  i 'll ask askreddit for advice and disguise it as a question that i asked for fun . 
  what did the comment say ? 
  he deleted it . 
  could i get a summary please ? 
  in the german version , they * are * actually called `` rubys '' though . 
  ( well , the german word for `` rubies '' , which is `` rubine '' . ), 
  this bugged me at some points . 
  first of all , the second spiritual stone you get is actually a ruby . 
  it 's called `` goron opal '' in the german version of the original , but in the remake it 's `` goron ruby '' , which makes no sense because that 's already the currency !, 
  does * every * story here get a reply with a pun in it ? 
  i have n't laughed this much in a while . 
  thank you . 
  who is this guy ? 
  i recognize him but i do n't know why . 
  are you sure you did n't press the * unlock * button non-stop ? 
  thanks , but is it bad that i only remember him from desperate housewives ? 
  well , it 's still better than [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/i90nn/some_families_are_weirder_than_others_nsfwish/c21vldl ) . 
  just like a cartoon character who 's running away from a giant rolling rock or something . 
  but it * rhymed * !, 
  sniper no sniping . 
  the guy after you was supposed to say `` aww , man ... '' . 
  [ ] ( / stare ), 
  fonotsteps has a nice ring to it , though .

  what a legendary post . 
  ( but everyone kinda hated the guy for what he did . ), 
  last night i dreamt that i had an owl, 
  * if they were the inventors of facebook , they would 've invented facebook .

  ( do n't you dare make overused jokes about the website being addicting . ), 
  can someone explain to me how to get those shades ? 
  because people in germany speak german and it 's better to watch a show where everyone speaks german than reading subtitles . 
  except if the dub sucks , but the german dub of scrubs is fantastic . 
  they probably did what malcolm in the middle did and just replaced it with danish . 
  there 's one scene where francis talks to that pianist who always plays music along with everything francis does . 
  he uses a dictionary to talk to him , and the dictionary says `` english-german '' . 
  with jeff winger as roy and moss as moss !, 
  he did kill someone , but the quotation marks are there to say `` do n't worry , it is n't what you think . 
  it was just self-defense '' . 
  if you look closely , you can see some white lines on the screen . 
  those are the numbers that show above enemies heads when you press f3 . 
  he can see that there are a lot of enemies beneath him , and therefore a big cave . 
  this is n't ganondorf , silly . 
  i 'm pretty sure that this behavior is n't normal .

  nice taste in music , trite . 
  at the age group part , should n't it say '' < 18 '' instead of ''  18 '' ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  i did n't know it was ** ar ** kan-saw until now !, 
  `` kansas '' is still pronounced just like it 's spelled , right ? 
  *** what did he saaaay ? 
  you just did . 
  those action commands seem like such a small thing that they added to the game , but even though they are easy to learn and execute , they add so much to the gameplay . 
  the fights are actually five times as fun this way . 
  from which anime is this ? 
  the art looks very nice . 
  is that the one where he says `` sonuvabitch '' ? 
  even if there was just a 1:10000000 chance that anyone would get spoiled , i would still take those three seconds to black the spoilers out . 
  i agree with everyone who says that spoiler tags are n't necessary in this thread , but come on . 
  you do n't have to respond to the guy with a spoiler just for the heck of it . 
  i just compared the end of season 3 and this episode . 
  his beard really * is * notably thicker . 
  to be fair , there 's a difference between `` it 's the gas station 's fault because the sold gas '' and `` it 's walt 's fault because he broke into a house and let a girl die '' . 
  actually , nobody would know it 's a spoiler for the next episode until they read what the spoiler tag says , so it 's rather pointless . 
  do n't put the `` well in the preview for episode 2 '' in the spoiler tags and everyone will know that they have to stop reading . 
  ( for example , i got spoiled because of your comment . 
  do n't worry , it 's not that bad , but fix it for the other people . ), 
  the teddy bear that fell out of the plane . 
  the last scene of the second to last episode of the third season . 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` after walt runs over two guys and shoots one of them in the head . '' ), 
  can you do godot from phoenix wright ? 
  i have only watched like 10 episodes but ... is that nagisa 's father ? 
  did you type that with one hand ? 
  * whoa * , very nice !, 
  thanks !, 
  the spiderman movie . 
  yep , it 's an actual episode . 
  ( one of the earlier ones . ), 
  edit : s01e14 . 
  the guys over at court-records . net are working on a fan translation . 
  the literal translation of case 1 is almost done ( but no localization yet ) and they already started with the literal translation of case 2 . 
  i thought this would have a twist at the end where the other guy would follow his advice and say `` thank you '' . 
  i 'd love to give you karma for this , but i ca n't !, 
  so i just have to say : thank you for your effort !, 
  nobody said that , but you should at least be fair about this . 
  are you sure you were n't just on acid and the kid was a guy messing with you ? 
  it 's because he was rushing towards some sort of entrance with a shopping cart , just like harry in the first book/movie . 
  ( see thought bubble . ), 
  drinking water is much more normal than rushing towards an entrance with a shopping cart . 
  also , the guy just `` feels '' like harry because the situation reminds him of the movie , he does n't really think he 's a wizard all of a sudden . 
  first i was like `` why is it asking me to log in ? 
  '' , then i was like `` oh , it 's that joke again '' . 
  yeah , sorry , i figured that out just now . 
  his comment made me laugh more than the other ones just because how pathetic it was . 
  i love seeing the intro of ** archer ** and any other intro in that style . 
  ( like cowboy bebop 's . ),
