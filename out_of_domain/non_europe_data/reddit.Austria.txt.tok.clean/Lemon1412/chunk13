  he should rebuild the ending of a * certain videogame that i ca n't name because of spoilers * with that . 
  * are n't you gon na pay for the food ? 
  now i 'll never know how much he paid !, 
  so wait , i do n't really get a point . 
  are we not allowed to donate money unless it 's our job to do that ? 
  are you complaining that he is n't donating more or are you just saying that people are overreacting about this ? 
  why would shit come out of his knee ? 
  who gives points to ravenclaw ? 
  well , to be honest , i did n't really read the books . 
  i do n't think they got mentioned a lot in the movies . 
  the first one is macmancpb , and the second one is actually a person `` playing '' all the other redditors ; and it 's all [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/gzrit/best_use_of_the_m_night_shyamalan_meme_ive_seen/ ) . 
  okay , there was a story like this on reddit once . 
  an old man always pushed his wife around in a wheelchair , and one day , she fell down the stairs and it was his fault . 
  i think it was in an askreddit topic and the guy who wrote it was a cashier at a gas station or something . 
  can someone find that for me ? 
  it was touching . 
  well ... yeah . 
  he wanted to emphasize that it is made of oxygen . 
  does anyone else not know what any of that is ? 
  which one is it ? 
  the one where they make a par-tay with mr. krabs ? 
  i read that in the voice of badger from breaking bad . 
  you can do the water temple before you do the fire temple ? 
  i thought it was because you do n't need potatoes to kill someone . 
  i 've heard that joke a thousand times on reddit , but i never got it . 
  so he 's telling everyone on youtube that this only costs a penny ? 
  why does he want us to buy this for a penny ? 
  phoenix * down * !, 
  well now i finally understand why i never got that joke : i never knew who dr. dre was or that he even existed . 
  did it sound like he was ? 
  [ welcome .

  just so you know , after you wrote that comment , he explained it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/j5og5/im_at_summer_camp_and_my_computer_has_net_nanny/c29dpww ) . 
  are you using the aether mod ? 
  to be fair , the one with the `` your top 5 websites '' is just a matter of opinion . 
  also , do you really think that the person asking the egypt thing would have preferred the very long version over the little summary ? 
  as in `` paper mario '' ? 
  * strap-on * is * no parts * backwards !, 
  * typewriter * is the longest word in the english language that you can write with the letters from a single row on your keyboard . 
  [ there you go .

  which is weird because i have a qwertz keyboard . 
  whoa , i 've seen that picture reposted five times but i 've never noticed that !, 
  thanks , danhammond . 
  thanks ... 
  maybe he thinks playing games alone is * really * boring , so it 's understandable why he does n't like single player . 
  just let him play the way he wants to play . 
  the line got added right before you posted this . 
  i think that 's a * the big bang theory * reference . 
  sheldon wanted his team to be like the x-men , and since his last name ( cooper ) starts with a c , he called them c-men . 
  or in apollo justice where you dust for prints on a safe to figure out which buttons have been pressed . 
  that * would * work in real life , right ? 
  ... at the same time . 
  did it have any bad episodes ? 
  planning surprise parties . 
  roy mustang ? 
  actually , yeah , just add the hair and it looks exactly like him . 
  wait a minute , is this a reference to some self.funny post from months ago ? 
  is it [ this ] ( http://static.igossip.com/photos_2/december_2010/small_michael_cera_lookalike.jpg ) one ? 
  you forgot to say that the snake 's name was nate . 
  i love how the pyro already kinda looks like the poopsmith . 
  what is the fourth truest one ? 
  cat funeral ... 
  cat funeraaaal ... 
  one time , i defended the cart as a spy very well for like seven minutes straight without dying , and we were about to win . 
  i was by far the best guy in my team . 
  the announcer already said `` three ... two ... one '' and at the last ** millisecond ** , the game killed me off and switched me to the other team . 
  i lost . 
  i did n't even rage at that point , i just hoped that it would n't happen again . 
  happened to me four times yesterday ( but only in the middle of the game ) , while i was on an official valve server . 
  never happens to me on reddit servers . 
  is there a mod that prevents this from happening on the reddit servers ? 
  i thought i recognized those guys !, 
  they 're the ones who made that [ clock blockers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbawce6du3w ) video !, 
  seriously , at least shoot the freaking engy . 
  i have [ this ] ( http://www.mnpctech.3dpixelnet.com/picture_library/logitech_mx518_take_apart_paint_casemodblog1.jpg ) mouse so i can just adjust the sensitivity whenever i want . 
  ** my problem with the game ** was that after the installation , i tried to play it and i was on some kind of loading screen that would never end . 
  after a quick google search , i found out that many , many people had that problem . 
  i found out that you had to press the key above the `` del '' key , and then some kind of `` games for windows live '' window popped up , then i had to make an account there and at the social club and then i had to link them !, 
  the problem was that i could n't make an account for gfwl because whenever i typed in all my data and clicked register , it said that the `` xbox live servers '' were down . 
  so registering did n't work , but it still thought that the username i had chosen was already given away , even though i did n't get the account . 
  so i had to try about five times , each time with another username , until i finally managed to make that account . 
  after linking them , i was finally able to play . 
  another problem is the online mode : i was just trying to play with my two friends on a little private server . 
  everything was fine , no lag . 
  after a while , i got kicked because `` my computer was too slow '' . 
  well what the fuck ? 
  i was able to play just fine until now !, 
  a few weeks ago , i ran out of hdd space , so i uninstalled gta iv in order to install all the sam & max episodes . 
  no regrets . 
  pyros can reflect any projectile that is n't a bullet ** or a needle ** !, 
  even arrows . 
  wait , i do n't get it . 
  is it funny because tf2 is free anyway or is it funny because there 's a `` demo '' class in the game ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  that 's what i said in my comment just now . 
  * cough *, 
  i am srory , but yuor mthoer has paoiscccnroocoloinovnpclnomuecoitumiasilrisos . 
  which episode ( s ) are the pictures from and who 's that in the second one ? 
  chang ?
