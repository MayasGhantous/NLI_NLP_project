  i once logged into the rice-think . net server , but it did n't work . 
  two days later , i found out i was banned . 
  i was never actually in the server !, 
  the message after the ban tells me to go to mcbans.com for the reason , but there 's just a list of usernames that is n't even alphabetical . 
  ** simon : ** i ca n't figure this puzzle out , let 's just use this !, 
  [ / give xephos 64 ], 
  ** lewis : ** simon , that 's half a door . 
  it would n't be so special if it did n't start out as a normal let 's play and slowly turned into an epic quest . 
  the list is twenty pages long and the oldest entry is like two days old . 
  my `` ban '' is n't even on that list anymore because it just shows recent bans . 
  i actually made an account now and looked at my bans and it says that i never got banned . 
  ( yet i ca n't get onto the server . ), 
  why does everyone say that ? 
  it 's not as good ( yet still decent ) for like five episodes and the last few episodes are brilliant again . 
  i just looked at five pictures of a half-naked jeff winger . 
  to be fair , he never said that he hated the people in sli8 's story . 
  whoa , that guy 's profile looks like a login screen !, 
  where are you from ? 
  maybe everyone was still sleeping or having lunch . 
  read this in a british accent until i saw the last line . 
  oh god , i hope you 're not lying to us . 
  i 've known about the existence of this movie for five minutes but i 'm already excited . 
  quick question , have you been a lurker for some time before you registered to reddit ? 
  or does this really mean that if you found reddit only a week later , we would have never gotten the chance to see this ? 
  this happened to my once . 
  while getting healed by my medic , i turned around and wanted to throw him a sandvich , but i accidently pressed lmb instead of rmb . 
  i felt like the biggest asshole possible . 
  imagine being a medic with low health , risking your life while healing a heavy , and he just stops , turns around , and fucking eats his sandvich away right in front of you . 
  wow , on the picture , he has like 1600 upvotes , and currently , he only has [ 601 upvotes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jei8j/groceries/ ) . 
  once , i was on a reddit server and decided to play medic on blu . 
  i charged my \u00dcber during set-up time , and then proceeded to overheal everyone in the spawning area . 
  all of a sudden , someone says `` you ready , watsuda ? '', 
  ( my tf2 name ) but i could n't find the damn guy and he obviously wanted to get \u00fcber 'd . 
  because i was panicking , i ran outside , \u00fcbered some random sniper and then \u00fcbered an enemy spy for five seconds . 
  how did i know it was an enemy spy ? 
  because he was disguised as ** me ** . 
  i disconnected because i was so ashamed . 
  ** i do n't know **, 
  [ me too .

  did n't norstein beckler in chrono trigger have the same laugh ? 
  does n't neil patrick harris have a kid named harper too ? 
  what is that weird sound at 0:54 when the engineer turns his head ? 
  i keep hearing that at spawn and i do n't know what it is !, 
  i think he 'll do all the individual worlds next . 
  ( and maybe he 'll do banjo tooie next since spiral mountain is kinda banjo tooie-like . ), 
  somebody should cross-post this to r/gaming . 
  this needs a lot more attention . 
  jim sure has strong arms , but i 've never seen him working out !, 
  how 's that possible ? 
  ca n't argue with that . 
  i watched two louis ck stand-ups and loved them . 
  what is the show like ? 
  would you recommend it ? 
  do you think they 'll ever bring this on the 3ds 's virtual console ? 
  i need to buy this . 
  oh man , i 'm european and though the exact same thing a few years ago . 
  i was like `` what the fuck we do n't have over 6 billion people on earth !, 
  yeah , i 'm pretty sure she was just acting stupid in her third message . 
  ( she probably remembered that she was already told that it meant `` oh my god '' . ), 
  to the downvoters : he 's probably referring to the fact that an edit without an asterisk is called a `` ninja edit '' and occurs when someone edits their post shortly after writing it . 
  i was at a friend 's house today and everything about his server list was normal !, 
  nobody else i know has this problem and i 've had it for months !, 
  the stats and items will still be there , right ? 
  there 's a girl in there !, 
  ... and a * pineapple * !, 
  well , considering only one day can be his first day and he just ** left ** and will never come back ... 
  [ davyblack does . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/jmhuw/i_found_my_favorite_pokemon_in_the_wild/c2dbuh9 ), 
  and me too , because i was the submitter . 
  uhm , did so many people actually downvote all of cgreer00 's posts , even though the vast majority of them are actually irrelevant , and it turned out that he was ** right ** ?!, 
  damn , they took away all of his karma for no reason . 
  how are they gon na fix that ? 
  or maybe he 's just been sleeping this entire time and will wake up in a few hours not knowing that any of this happened . 
  yeah , but in this case , you can just take the shit off the burger if you want , but you sometimes have to see other people around you eating the shit-burger . 
  it was just a metaphor !, 
  the `` shit '' is the new weapons , and the `` burger '' is the game . 
  it 's not like you will have pieces of the new weapons ( `` shit '' ) in your hands even though you 're using other weapons . 
  is her rival in love such an evil person that she deserves death ? 
  and dan was n't even the guy with the nipple piercings !, 
  well , that was what i meant with `` you sometimes have to see other people around you eating the shit-burger '' . 
  whatever . 
  it was a bad metaphor to begin with . 
  hah , that comment made me smile . 
  or troy barnes . 
  `` just pretend like you 're a asleep ... just pretend like you 're sleepin ' ... '', 
  maybe that 's the pyro without his mask . 
  maybe he has no face because his face got burned off . 
  i 'm not an artist , but maybe there are just some people who like their art `` clean '' . 
  what ? 
  you already have that ? 
  grumble grumble, 
  that is n't even a novelty account . 
  wow , that actually came pretty unexpected . 
  i think it has something to do with the fact that it 's written from your point of view . 
  maybe someone downvoted it !, 
  is that the scene with the asian guy raising his hands ? 
  yeah , but you 'll remember the song a few months later and really want to listen to it again !, 
  same with smells . 
  sometimes i smell gta vice city in my brother 's room .
