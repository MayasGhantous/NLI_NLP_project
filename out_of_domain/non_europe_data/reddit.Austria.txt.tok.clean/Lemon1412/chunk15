  read the guy 's comment again . 
  he * thought * that the guy just threw his ragdoll out because he thought that the dead ringer works like the decoy . 
  it 's called `` nigh ** t ** eam '' . 
  you 're giving the guys to much credit by thinking their servers actually have words for names . 
  i thought you just played in other languages depending on the class you 're playing . 
  on the reddit europe server today , i saw a level 1 teleporter and two people were just standing there , so i went back in , switched to engineer and started upgrading it . 
  then i pressed c1 to scream `` help ! '', 
  and the guys switched to engi too and the tele was upgraded within seconds !, 
   do you really need to rocket jump into the ceiling that many times ? 
  they 're probably doing it for the medics . 
  you know how the \u00dcber charges faster when you 're hurt ? 
  too bad this does n't apply for setup time , but many people do n't know that . 
  update : you can read the replies to this comment for alternate wordings of my last sentence !, 
  and you can only have sex with her two times . 
  uh , why are you disapproving ? 
  i thought people only did that when someone created an account after they saw an opportunity to use it and when it was made after the comment was written . 
  reddit is like kaepora gaebora . 
  what did moving the bed have to do with anything ? 
  i just do n't understand what happened there . 
  looks like one of the cousins . 
  is n't that what he meant ? 
  did you look at your comment after you submitted it ? 
  in the future , use `` formatting help '' under the comment box . 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/pgzy9bfxyty#t=3m16s ), 
  maybe he * will * find it out at the end of the fourth season . 
  i bet breaking bad can pull off making another season after that . 
  just like they made a fourth season after what happened at the end of the third one . 
  i thought this would be about ingo and malon looking like the mario bros. again , but hey , this is actually something i 've never noticed !, 
   a brand new translation ( much better ), 
  yeah , now frog does n't have that accent anymore . 
  some people might complain about that , but why did he even have that to begin with ? 
  nobody else in his era talked that way . 
  i thought it has something to do with the number of subscribers . 
  they 're minerals , marie . 
  yup , and then i just had to stop watching at the end of season 3 , which was the most intense ending ever . 
  how long did we have to wait ? 
  11 months ? 
  i got that achievement on christmas eve , and i 'm still playing the game . 
  it 's just so good . 
  i 'm going for every achievement right now . 
  ( the '' - boy '' achievements . 
  just finished salt boy . ), 
  i use reddit enhancement suite and was able to tag the account with a big red tag saying `` two llamas '' . 
  i still fell for it . 
  did that \u00dcber 'd spy also glow red from the medic 's point of view or was he blue ? 
  would he even still be able to get \u00dcber 'd when he 's not disguised ? 
  he probably * likes * the pack more than vanilla and is happier with it . 
  he also is n't complaining that other people are using vanilla . 
  okay , you might have to explain how * that * was a whoosh . 
  same for the new miles edgeworth game . 
  which is a sequel . 
  to a game they released everywhere . 
  but they wo n't translate the sequel . 
  nope , you 're right . 
  germans also capitalize verbs and adjectives that are used * as * nouns . 
  on the other hand , they do n't capitalize `` english '' or `` spanish '' , since those are not nouns . 
  there you go : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axxo, 
  yup , i 'm pretty sure it 's possible during connecting , parsing game info , downloading the map or sending client info . 
  the game kinda freezes during retrieving server info . 
  that being said , i ca n't tell if the button on the picture works because there is a gigantic arrow in the way of the loading bar . 
  [ `` for years , i thought i spoke excellent french !, 
  '' ] ( http://youtu.be/os18fgh6rq0 ), 
  i do n't get it . 
  someone is new to the game . 
  he asks how to wear a hat in tf2 , because it is n't common sense . 
  ergo , he 's free to play and you have to make a reddit submission about that ? 
  the worst thing about this anime is the fact that people actually sympathize with lucy . 
  why !? 
  she had a sad past and her dog died due to some kids ? 
  she got jealous because a guy with whom she 's in love likes was on a festival with another girl ? 
  and that 's why she kills innocent people that did n't have anything to do with that ? 
  why would they encourage people to give themselves the princess 's name ? 
  think about it . 
  you can either put a lot of work into being original and entertaining and get a lot of views and money or you could just act like you 're really stupid so that people go `` check this stupid chick out '' and get a lot of views and money . 
  maybe she 's just an evil genius and we 're just her little puppets !, 
  well at least you 're actually laughing . 
  other people just say `` lol '' when they 're clearly not . 
  [ context . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/k2bo5/pigs_need_snouts/ ), 
  ... why would i hate people who watch it differently ? 
  i do n't care how other people enjoy the anime , they should just watch it the way they like more . 
  i never understood why people even care about other people watching the dub or the sub . 
  then who was phone ? 
  stop it . 
  pff , nes did n't have loading times . 
  well , what about [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwufb8gfmts ) ? 
  wow , that 's actually pretty clever . 
  his username 's `` dirtymonitor '' . 
  it!s a novelty account . 
  it 's like a [ double dollar ] ( http://www.wfac.ca/images/0000/1596/trigun_wanted_max.jpg ) . 
  and yet your right is not the opposite of my left . 
  i just hiked there and found you buried underground , in case you wondered why there was a sign and a picture underground . 
  edit : also , the pool is n't in a house like i thought it was , this only has three walls and no ceiling !, 
  he said * he * was missing a tooth though . 
  wait , what are you trying to say here ? 
  i played tennis once and hit the tennis ball really hard , and it was ** gone ** . 
  no , i did n't send it flying very far , it disappeared on impact . 
  when we were on our way to get a new ball , we found it [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5a02b.jpg ) . 
  i thought it was because the middle girl 's left foot looks like a dog 's .
