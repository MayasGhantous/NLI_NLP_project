  i just looked and i have the exact same mole too !, 
  what the hell ? 
  cut him some slack , he was just a kid when he said that !, 
  why did he censor the boobs , but not the blood ? 
  it is n't about colors , one side is industrial and one 's not . 
  it is amusing how people in the us can watch tv shows online , and yet the websites are blocked in countries that ca n't pay for watching anyway . 
  i do n't wan na be that guy , but it 's spelled * elfen * lied . 
  hahaha , `` seattle '' . 
  what 's the one at the bottom right ? 
  a godot cookie ? 
  [ obligatory . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u2zsoywwja ), 
  learned what ? 
   you can see in the promo for the next episode [ spoiler ] ( / s `` how jesse is taken away to mexico '' ), 
  please do it like this next time . 
  you ca n't know what 's it spoiling unless you spoil yourself . 
  depends . 
  it 's called [ dawson casting ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/dawsoncasting ) . 
  i am very stupid in my dreams . 
  i dream the same thing every night : one of my teeth is falling out . 
  and i * always * think `` wow , i normally dream this , but this time it actually happened !, 
  you want inception ? 
  it was just a game of monopoly . 
  super meat boy was like 30 times longer than vvvvvv and less forgiving . 
  vvvvvv was n't even that hard , except for veni vidi vici . 
  that 's actually pretty inspiring . 
  he 's not the record * holder * ... 
  just do n't forget who you 're working for . 
  uh oh , if we see a few sevens in the next episode we know that something is gon na go down when it reaches zero . 
  like jesse 's death . 
  you should probably temporarily unsubscribe the subreddit , just to be safe . 
  read the whole post again . 
  that 's the entire point of the post , no , the entire point of the * account * . 
  we need more from this guy . 
  oh yeah , you 're right !, 
  well that kinda sucks for people who have n't seen it yet . 
  is there no way a user can block content from this subreddit from showing up on r/all ? 
  do n't forget maya and nick !, 
  here you go : http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/kk10m/episode_discussion_s04e10_salud_spoilers/c2kwqlv, 
  it 's a quote ? 
  what 's your fourth favorite ? 
  it 's a pun on `` what 's new ? 
  the windshield is fine , though !, 
  i 'm glad i 'm not the only one who thinks that !, 
  it really looked like that when the camera was zooming out and the foreground was shaking but the crawl space with walt did n't . 
  it was kinda distracting , but maybe it just looked like two pictures . 
  the question was answered by gnippots right above you , an hour after you wrote your comment . 
  i thought the joke was that since guy 1 touched his own dick and did n't wash his hands , guy 2 basically indirectly touched guy 1 's dick when shaking his hand . 
  the one that went down on the other guy in camp just because he wanted to return the favor ? 
  what is it ? 
  season 7 ? 
  what if they * are * friends , though ? 
  yeah , he really should 've considered that when he posted the comment . 
  that being said , i always thought that a world map only showed the * front * of the earth , and the entire back of it is the pacific ocean and some small islands . 
  it blew my mind when i saw bits of russia right next to america . 
  and the father is gon na kill himself next because his skin color is different from his family 's , but the same as the other victims . 
  i guess would make the ring on top and place the blocks very quickly under it while sinking down to the bottom . 
  then you swim back up and do that with every block . 
  * light, 
  he also did the voice for koizumi in the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya , and i actually think the voice fits both of them perfectly . 
  ( and mao in code geass . ), 
  say yes to drugs . 
  means yes . 
  say no to saying yes = saying no . 
  means no . 
  say yes to saying no to saying yes = saying yes to saying no . 
  means no . 
  or something . 
  ah , that 's right !, 
  the yeses just confirm the sentence . 
  they do n't actually change anything . 
  kinda like you would only look at the amount of ( -1 ) s here :, 
  15 times 1 times 1 times ( -1 ) times 1 times 1 times ( -1 ) times 1, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnvt_iapora ) scene in * catch me if you can * . 
  it makes a screenshot . 
  are we talking about the same show here ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruq3cmdxtsq ), 
  does [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/i_rape_cats ) have people then ? 
  oh , i read it in mario 's voice . 
  that was stupid in hindsight . 
  that brown stuff is armpit hair . 
  it 's jesse lying on jane , trying to wake her up . 
  except if he has the +10 % movement speed set bonus . 
  no , that 's how you troll teammates into thinking you 're a spy !, 
  i thought that was mashy spike plate, 
  was that a reference to the sound king zora makes when he scooches over ? 
  saved by the bell amiright ? 
  and in the season 5 finale , he crashes walt jr. 's wedding . 
  nope ? 
  do you only do taxidermy on people who are alive ? 
  but they look so funny !, 
  i mean look at their ** faces ** !, 
  i beat the one with the forklift on my first try . 
  i was pretty damn proud of myself after all the things i 'd heard about it . 
  just curious , what do you not like about him ? 
  is it something you ca n't put your finger on ? 
  baccano , just like in the anime !, 
  ( when `` you know who '' types it in , you can briefly see the letters . ), 
  whenever someone suddenly falls asleep in front of me and solves a case without moving his mouth , i do n't even question it and just go with it . 
  a , uh , rug !,
