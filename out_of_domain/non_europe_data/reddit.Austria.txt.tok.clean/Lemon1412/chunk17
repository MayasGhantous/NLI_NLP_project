  a wall !, 
  reminds me of house for some reason . 
  haha , `` chicks '' . 
  to be fair , people do n't use `` spelt '' to often . 
  or at least ** i ** have n't heard it being used a lot . 
  is that the one with the girl wearing pink converse and the woman looking for her baby ? 
  i 'm so glad i read that comic without sound . 
  but why would it be mirrored ? 
  as irrelevant as it was , it made me laugh . 
  ( by the way , you accidently double-posted . ), 
  i 'm not sure , but i 'd be happy to refer you to our website . 
  it 's time to d-d-d-d-d-duel !, 
  i 'm not sure if i 'm supposed to say `` whoosh '' now or if i would `` whoosh '' myself by saying that . 
  `` le me '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  you 're not even male !, 
  [ relevant .

  ( actually play it to get how it 's relevant . ), 
  ** use your zappy gun to zap them !, 
  ... the one with the woman looking for her baby ? 
  either ** the lincoln lawyer ** or ** source code ** . 
  nobody on reddit ever talks about those . 
  you do n't use the [ reddit enhancement suite ] ( http://reddit.honestbleeps.com ) yet ? 
  he always is . 
  whenever you see the whole courtroom ( from the door 's point of view ) , he 's on the right side . 
  most of the time , you see the game from the judge 's point of view , where he 's on the left . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b6z5q.jpg ) a screenshot from the game . 
  nick is on the right , the judge is in the back . 
  and [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ioxqt.jpg ) a screenshot from the trailer . 
  again , phoenix on the right , judge in the back . 
  * sigh * not everything made by notch is minecraft . 
  i did n't `` obviously '' think he made a scrolls joke . 
  ** i ** made the scrolls joke .

  ... is n't it like ... one of the best controllers ever ? 
  zelda is a girl 's name . 
  the princess 's name is `` zelda '' , the guy in green is whatever you named him before starting the game . 
  ( `` link '' on default ), 
  i always called it the * ess-ness * . 
  `` retrieving server info '' takes about four minutes for me . 
  even during map changes . 
  does that mean i need a better computer ? 
  he merely explained the joke . 
  oculus already means eye . 
  * 20 seconds of laughter *, 
  jean . 
  because the grandmother would be dead if she died . 
  forget the grandson . 
  probably as in `` he has a lot of power '' because he was able to pay someone to go back in time with a time machine and risk his life . 
  edit : by the way , i like the idea that he was the grandson himself . 
  yea he got shot by scott pilgrim though . 
  that 's right , that guy from superbad !, 
  i did n't even make an effort to read that . 
  that works with every other person ever . 
  they did have a real kiss scene , though . 
  i thought snooker was widely known ? 
  the machine gun from cave story . 
  awesome . 
  they ... will , wo n't they ? 
  my problem is that they wo n't bring the new miles edgeworth game . 
  ** where is his attorney 's badge ? 
  everyone use a picture of sterling archer as your avatar to raise awareness for male breast cancer . 
  it 's one of those sandwiches from how i met your mother . 
  uuh , what is this ? 
  a new variation of the waffels/carrots thing ? 
  thank you . 
  arrange ragdolls in a way so that it looks like they 're having sex . 
  then spawn a thousand exploding barrels . 
  spawn a dr. kleiner for good measure . 
  shoot one of the barrels . 
  repeat for 2000 hours . 
  whenever someone makes an insightful and mature comment , it 's just a `` comment '' . 
  when it 's a comment people do n't like , it 's `` reddit '' . 
  shoot for the moon ,, 
  achievement unlocked : lunacy, 
  that just happened, 
  they are two british guys who were completely new to minecraft . 
  they made a let 's play on their private smp server and messed around . 
  suddenly , it turned out that they were not alone on the server . 
  they found unnatural structures , and one day , a guy called `` israphel '' was on their server and attacked them . 
  they followed him and found a town with people acting like npcs . 
  now the let 's play has a freaking * story * and they travel from town to town , trying to foil the evil israphel 's plan . 
  [ here ] ( http://youtu.be/4udefmxrmne ) 's the first video and [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/show/minecraft?s=soi ) 's the playlist . 
  der auserw\u00e4hlte , yes . 
  and now, 
  / give adamsavage 46 64, 
  i only know two values . 
  46 is tnt and 64 is half a door . 
  ( the thing you accidently get when you want tnt . ), 
  first of all , number 1 should be number 2 and vice versa . 
  but that does n't matter . 
  notch insulted the yogscast and accused them of doing bad stuff . 
  we still do n't know if it 's true or not , but he did it ** online ** and had ** no proof ** . 
  the accuser has to provide the proof , not the accused . 
  ~ ~ unless you 're in the phoenix wright universe or something . ~ ~, 
  the yogscast , getting harassed by fans , merely defended themselves . 
  and they even let notch off . 
  and they handled it calmly and maturely . 
  of course they * had * to do it online , because everyone online thought they did something wrong .
