  because of notch . 
  if this ( holds up three fingers ) is two , then what is * this * ? 
  ( holds up five fingers ), 
  because that guy sure ages quickly ? 
  nope , it was 3 . 
  but if this ( holds up four fingers ) is 8 , then what is this ? 
  ( holds up 5 fingers ), 
  nope , it was n't . 
  and this time it was 4 !, 
  yes . 
  it was 3 !, 
  haha , yeah , that 's where i got it from . 
  i 've heard this story before . 
  have you already written this somewhere on reddit , is this * common * among treachers or did it actually not happen ? 
  yup !, 
  it was 3 , though !, 
  or majora 's mask , for that matter . 
  it 's actually a highly appreciated game . 
  i think it 's from the movie zombieland . 
  i think he knows that monkeyboi knows the cat is n't in the game . 
  it 's too obvious and according to boon 's comment history , he is n't extremely stupid . 
  four makes two ... unless you 're dead . 
  see that ? 
  that was an explainabrag . 
  the last episode came out two years ago , but i think he 's still ... * fairly * active . 
  is that the one with the girl wearing pink converse ? 
  i thought you meant conan o'brien at first . 
  watch [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzxq3cnxbwk ) though , it 's enjoyable . 
  i just love the guy 's voice . 
  every sentence she says is frustrating is fuck . 
  i bet you 're like syndrome and think that valuing life is weakness and disregarding it is strength . 
  feeling sorry for squidward . 
  he should put a sticker on the back of the brick . 
  his friend will know who threw the brick , but he ca n't prove it unless he wants to admit he sold a stolen game . 
  * 25 seconds of laughter *, 
  i love portal to death . 
  get it ? 
  love it ... until i 'm dead . 
  wait , why do n't you just call it iceketball ? 
  and why does [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/n5fgb/just_a_pok%c3%a9mon_battle_egoraptors_latest_awesome/ ) only have like 300 upvotes ? 
  it 's submitted by the man himself . 
  foosball and nocturnal vigilantism ? 
  and the music does n't stop when you die . 
  and the music is awesome . 
  you know why i named it steins ; gate ? 
  [ it does n't really mean anything . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  you refuse to listen to reason , and i 'd have no luck against you just by myself . 
  you wo n't even give me the time to try . 
  that 's why ... 
  ... i 'll rely on numbers !, 
  i love tvtropes and i find it very interesting , but i hate those comments . 
  why ca n't people just form their own sentences with their own ideas ? 
  or maybe he was just kidding . 
  damn , we should really get this sarcastic font implemented . 
  i ca n't believe so many people seem to think that . 
  disco ball, 
  well , probably because i do n't think they look nearly identical . 
  edit : by the way , i 'm not saying it 's stupid to confuse them , it 's just that it never even came to my mind that they might resemble each other . 
  why would anyone want to read usernames before commenting ? 
  i mean , i saw the guy 's name because i took a glance but you should n't expect everyone to read usernames before commenting . 
  i bought cave story 3ds when it came out . 
  ( first version of cave story i 've played . ), 
  it 's freaking amazing . 
  it 's a redeem code , i think . 
  but what 's the point ? 
  the guy probably paid a penny for it . 
  ( hats off if you paid at least a few dollars , lulzcal . ), 
  i do n't even regret buying the 3ds version for 40 dollars . 
  * to be interested in !, 
  most countries do n't even have peanut butter . 
  ... y-you were serious ? 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pxrwgjzzw ) 's the source . 
  and by the teacher 's logic , 1 piece would take 5 minutes . 
  meaning it takes you 5 minutes to look at a wooden board . 
  i do n't get it either . 
  this is probably my highest rated comment , my second highest one being a reply to some story , asking the poster to elaborate . 
  i never get karma for comments i find witty , though . 
  reddit works in mysterious ways . 
  which layton game is this from ? 
  are you sure you 're not just thinking that because you got no notification ? 
  you may have it in your backback regardless . 
  i wan na be like ocelote . 
  earning money by doing what you love while entertaining people . 
  learning !, 
  joints ... i think . 
  ca n't argue with that . 
  so was sigmund freud . 
  i want to fuck my mother , robo-nazi !, 
  you think so ? 
  i 've heard many people with english as their first language say that , but most of the other people think it 's pretty much the easiest language in the world . 
  it really is n't hard to learn . 
  no matter how many letters in `` feliz dad '' you rearrange , you never get zelda . 
  you can get `` zelda fid '' , but not `` zelda '' . 
  yes , but the remaining three letters still exist , even though you did n't rearrange them in any way . 
  have you tried using a keyboard ? 
  i played with keyboard from the beginning to the end and even got 100 % . 
  it was hard , yes , but probably not much harder than with a gamepad . 
  i 'm laughing so hard right now because of that horribly stupid comment coupled with your reaction . 
  i had to upvote the guy .
