  i really had to . 
  ted 's asshole boss ( `` hammond '' , i think ) who designed a building that looks like a penis . 
  ... what ? 
  aaaand that 's enough . 
  it took me a while to realize that he had to move his lips backwards so it would sync up with the audio . 
  i read this as `` unforeseen consequences '' and felt like i had to prepare for something . 
  what 's that quote from ? 
  actually , it 's called the `` mario kart '' series . 
  only the first game was named `` super mario kart '' . 
  * pushes up glasses *, 
  the black person in the super-enhanced picture is ** tiger ** woods . 
  ( i did n't get it either . ), 
  [ just found this . 
  ] ( http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/gravelpit#bugs ), 
  see third bug : * if blu captures point a or point b during overtime , sometimes the round will end instantly in a loss for blu . 
  man , that 's pretty annoying . 
  how have they not fixed this yet ? 
  actually , yes , it did . 
  but it 's listed under `` bugs '' on the official page , and the description of the bug does n't mention map time . 
  what 's your username ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  how does carl know that he is n't actually a bedwetter ? 
  and why is he a hobo if he knows ? 
  but how does justfart know that carl is n't actually a bedwetter ? 
  what do you mean it `` loses the ability to be spoiled '' ?!, 
  the guy you 're replying to just said that he does n't have the book yet , so it could spoil him . 
  and even if a movie is 20 years old , i 'd still use spoiler tags just to be safe because it requires almost no effort at all . 
  i do n't get why people complain about spoiler tags . 
  is it that hard to hover your cursor over some text ? 
  i do n't know how you think that i was angry while writing that comment , because i really was n't . 
  yeah , lists are awesome . 
  [ context . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hm7pp_jfos ), 
  maybe he confused `` username '' with `` password '' . 
  and maybe his password 's like `` banjamin '' or something . 
  and maybe that 's exactly why [ giancarlo wrote `` play '' instead of `` played '' . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  why do you have to explain this ? 
  are there really that many people who think that he was calling himself a donut ? 
  season 4 finale spoilers : [ the comment said something like `` it 's funny how you say `` i play gus '' in present tense even though your character died '' , which is a big spoiler for the people who still have n't seen it yet . 
  gc says ** play ** right in the title of the ama . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  because reddit is n't just one person . 
  it was a brilliant read . 
  if i had that man in black memory ereaser thing i would use it at myself to read that story again . 
  perhaps the same could be said of * all * religions . 
  yeah , but he was n't the * only * good actor since liam neeson was still there . 
  i actually loved both !, 
  the helicopter scene was hilarious !, 
  why are you `` quite certain '' ? 
  for example , reddit will go black on 1 a.m. on thursday in great bitain . 
  it 's not like there are no british people on reddit . 
  wow , i guess you were right then !, 
  i personally do n't like the official japanese women-only musical , but the fan-made songs [ here ] ( http://www.pwmusical.com/ ) are fantastic . 
  oooh , it 's not a giant dick , it 's just a pig giving some guy with hairy legs a blowjob !, 
  do you not have unproductive hobbies ? 
  what are you supposed to do at that train part ? 
  i always had to drive back and wait for it to drive by . 
  something else that blew my mind : [ the bird was n't valentina 's face ?!, 
  ] ( http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/snes/smrpg/images/val.gif ) ( super mario rpg ), 
  delete that comment . 
  it 's appropriate when it 's a * comic * . 
  anohana maybe ? 
  what does ** that ** mean ? 
  came here expecting tony shalhoub . 
  this is okay too . 
  but no tony shalhoub . 
  `` his '' passengers implies he was the pilot or driver though . 
  i had a pregnant when i read that . 
  it 's the g-man . 
  let 's just hope she wo n't munson it . 
  yamazaki from welcome to the nhk did . 
  and it kinda worked . 
  but then he intentionally fucked up . 
  or something . 
  capcom announced gyakuten saiban 5 a few days ago and i am not happy . 
  because we will never get it . 
  mental image ? 
  do n't you know the video ? 
  [ here it is . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqyqyhbtzjg ), 
  i 'm like at the beginning of season 2 and stopped watching . 
  no no , i love the show , but i forgot what the last episode i watched was and then i stopped watching it entirely . 
  someone tell me the number of the episode in which gob keeps talking about his 5000 dollar suit and the price changes every time . 
  ah , i thought it was because you were some kind of super-kira that does n't need a face . 
  and stuff . 
  check it out , he signed my shirt !, 
  eric, 
  i would n't call phoenix wright very `` modern '' . 
  i think the newest pw game is seven years old . 
  do n't worry , at least you made me laugh . 
  for so long . 
  [ here 's the relevant video . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/t5hnpaolwwq#t=6m6s ), 
  i read this in ... egoraptor 's voice . 
  [ here you go . 
  edit : ** nsfw ** , obviously . 
  and now i woosh at you . 
  how fun !, 
  it was a mercedes .
