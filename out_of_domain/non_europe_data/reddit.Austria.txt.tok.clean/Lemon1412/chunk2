  * bwahaha , what am i talking about ?!, 
  have an upvote !, 
  this meme made it to reddit ?!, 
  [ 140.15 is far more legendary . 
  ] ( http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/201/548083-mgs_back_super.jpg ), 
  i use [ phoenix wright 's ringtone ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uceyggsy53y ) . 
  is n't there some kind of website that plays two youtube videos at the same time ? 
  there should be a program who flashes this on the screen every 15 minutes . 
  you will never have back problems ever again . 
   iplay 5 games on facebook and love them and all the people i have met and got in touch with ... the last 3 moths ... but my boyfriend is sic of me being on the computer all the time . . i dont have much of a life and gives me something to do during the day ... he wants me to give up the one thing i enjoy instead of doing it along wth me . . 
  those are great . 
  also , mega man should exist by now . 
  sandy balls !, 
  what are all these chinese people doing here, 
   it has incognito mode , which makes discreet browsing fast and easy . 
  ah , i bet that 's really useful if you 're * planning parties * . 
  use [ hotspot shield ] ( http://www.hotspotshield.com/ ) . 
  so what happened after that ? 
  how did the class react ? 
  what happened to the teacher ? 
   she will get her revenge later with homework and detentions galore . 
  pff , that 's pretty unfair . 
  it was n't your friend 's fault that she did n't let him go to the nurse . 
  amoralrelativist totally deserves this . 
  i read a lot of comments in this topic , but his was the most satisfying one . 
  a genuine `` fuck yeah ! '', 
  moment . 
  yes , but only the first one . 
  the puke fountain disaster was in the second class . 
  she gave them more homework because she was in a bad mood , i guess ... ? 
  i 'm just saying that she should have thought about it a little more . 
  her pupil looked really sick and she acted like a bitch and did n't let him go . 
  could they have been sued for this if they did n't make the correction ? 
  it 's `` pok\u00e9mon '' , not `` pokemon '' . 
  even if i sprain my ankle while i 'm robbing your place ? 
  * ( is he coming onto me ?!, 
  [ it is . 
  ] ( http://listverse.com/2009/01/28/top-10-bizarre-or-frivolous-lawsuits/ ), 
  why would she even tell you that ? 
  is it bad to swallow gum ? 
  some people would just stick their gums somewhere if they were n't able to swallow them . 
  it took me ten minutes to get your point . 
  and i only got it because i read the comments . 
  for the people who still have n't gotten it : the statue looks like the reddit alien . 
  i * think * . 
  nonono , metroid 's a woman . 
  ... i was joking , just like the two people above me . 
  ... is * your * name a twin tower bombing reference ? 
  i always thought that i only had one eye because i could see everything as * one * picture , and everyone else had two eyes , so i thought i was special or something . 
  i do n't know why i thought that , i probably did n't look in the mirror that often . 
  `` oh my god !!, 
  how do you get tackled by a guy from sweden ?! '', 
  same here . 
  i figured that everything that ends with '' - ist '' is bad . 
   a few examples : investigation core 2002 : shit is going down, 
  i think that everyone who played the game knows what makes this song so special . 
  one of the most memorable plot twists ever . 
  yeah , but they kinda overused it in that game . 
  you hear it like every five minutes in the fifth case . 
  i was actually really fond of teru mikami ( x-kira ) , though . 
  oh please , it took me a quick google search to find out it 's real . 
  he should have posted the link , though , but maybe they could have changed it after some time . 
  stan and professor layton were great additions . 
  what about the ds port of chrono trigger , though ? 
  why was he even speaking like that ?!, 
  he was the only one in his time who talked that way . 
  [ the secret of monkey island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_secret_of_monkey_island ) . 
  what did n't you like about it , rimmed ? 
  ... the song you just posted slows down time . 
  it does n't bring you back to the beginning . 
  what the ... ?!, 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  i thought the top comment would be something like `` now you 're thinking with portals . 
  coincidentally , i found that out yesterday when i was playing you do n't know jack . 
  why did n't you downvote one of your own comments ? 
  that does n't even make any sense . 
  replace the word `` sad '' with any name and you 'll see that it 's gramatically incorrect . 
  the last picture reminded me of that one treehouse of horror episode on the simpsons where bart had psychic powers and turned his dog into some freaky animal with a parasol for a tail . 
  exactly what i thought !, 
  after seven minutes , i finally remembered where i know it from : cat mario !, 
  no , the * yellow * stuff is the make up . 
  ( seriously , you find out at the end of that episode . ), 
  hmm , those t-shirts would be useful to distract your enemy in a fight . 
  i 'll take this one . 
  get the ones behind me !, 
  [ yeeeeeeah !!, 
  this is fantastic . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytmsy3u9cum ), 
  yes , what did they say about the number of his subscribers ? 
  that he had like 40 ? 
  one week later , he had over 300 . 
  he has over 6400 now . 
  shroomz_eater was able to read the text underneath the circles . 
  it says that the right inner circle appears to be bigger . 
  but so what ?!, 
  he did n't know what the actual illusion was . 
  he did n't know that they were actually the same size . 
  also , he wrote a comment , so i doubt that he ca n't read . 
  i do n't get why people just copy the word into wikipedia or something . 
  i just did that and found out that you spelled it correctly .
