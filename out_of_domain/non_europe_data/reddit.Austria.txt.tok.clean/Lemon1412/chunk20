  come on !, 
  so only people from your school get the joke ? 
  god damn it , pierce . 
  i use a knife and then eat them with a spoon . 
  true story . 
  and now i really want to eat spaghetti . 
  ken rosenberg is the most amazing character in the series . 
  * crickets *, 
  made the sweat drip from my baaaalls . 
  does half your face get torn off ? 
  was ... that a dane cook reference . 
  actually , it was on purpose because it just seems more emotionless without a questionmark . 
  because every gay man likes every other gay man . 
  did n't you hear him say `` seriously '' ? 
  samuel l. jackson is officer tenpenny !, 
  but would n't the short hand point between 6 and 7 ? 
  that 's the exact same thing i thought too !, 
  after bob saget was like `` your mother was there too '' i immediately thought of the scene where ted runs into her for no reason . 
  did anyone actually make any profit with turnips ? 
  yes . 
  in some places . 
  and in some places , it 's not . 
  that being said , * everything * is a slang for `` vagina '' in england . 
  ** ass ** sin 's creed ? 
  i think i 've seen your name a few times ( you 're good at playing spy , right ? ), 
  on the rugc europe server . 
  i do n't know if you remember me , but i go by `` watsuda '' when i 'm playing tf2 . 
  well , best of luck then !, 
  `` i shall take an olde potatoe chip ... and eateth it . '', 
  i do n't know how this works . 
  it 's the same goat that beat him up on his 31 ^ st birthday . 
  when something smells , it 's got ta be the butz !, 
  or you download a program that gives you a live preview of what your character looks like while you draw the textures . 
  [ that is the name of an anime . ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/welcome_to_the_nhk ! ), 
  it 's really funny . 
  sometimes . 
  but it 's pretty damn sad too . 
  yeah , but it was censored . 
  for fuck 's sake , i am still playing l.a. noire . 
  why did they have to write that in the article !, 
  d'awwww . 
  the letters on the german keyboard are n't very different from yours . 
  the z and the y are switched , and there 's an \u00dc in the first row and an \u00d6 and \u00c4 in the second one . 
  also , 7dayss was probably saying that the german language has very long words . 
  and a lighter is `` feuerzeug '' . 
  firestuff !, 
  `` drache '' means dragon . 
  `` drachen '' means kite or dragon ** s ** . 
  the nbc sitcom * community * . 
  end of season 3 , episode 12 . 
  or something . 
  i completely agree . 
  the anime was great until the very last episode . 
  and then i just sat there , thinking `` that ... was n't a very good ending '' . 
  [ ending ] ( / s `` why was there time-travel all of sudden !? '' ), 
  i bothered to post to ask the question i just asked to get the answer you just gave me . 
  i thought the ending was kinda cheap . 
  i mean , [ ] ( / s `` many things that happened in the series did n't actually happen in the end , they suddenly used time-travel in a series where you totally would n't expect time-travel and they never really elaborated on the whole `` balls of light '' thing in the series . '' ), 
  something [ no one lives forever ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_operative:_no_one_lives_forever ) - esque ? 
  that would work , i guess . 
  just with cartoonier graphics . 
  how do you know it is n't ? 
  except for a lot of things . 
  like in this case . 
  eat sushi !, 
  do n't fight !, 
  she 's flipping out ? 
  why ? 
  as a non-native speaker , i did n't know that `` coming into money '' means something other than ejaculating in it . 
  actually , i find this answer more correct than the one he was looking for . 
  the disappearance of haruhi suzumiya . 
  of course , you have to watch the series beforehand ( which i did chronologically , including every episode of endless eight ) . 
  i just loved the characters , the music , the scene with `` you slimy octopus ! '', 
  in it and especially the inner monologue near the end so freaking much . 
  is the 2009 re-air order the fully chronological one with season 2 implemented ? 
  my first thought was tobias f\u00fcnke . 
  i do n't know why , but it kinda looks like the great deku tree . 
  even after reading the word `` gazillion '' ? 
  i 've never noticed this , but smiley faces look really funny . 
  to be fair , downvoting wo n't tell jackster21 why he was downvoted and therefore ca n't change how he 's writing . 
  i keep thinking of that roald dahl story when i read `` leg of lamb '' . 
  probably because calling people names is generally considered immature . 
  i noticed that people on rugc europe actually think about what map they are voting for instead of voting for the first thing in the list . 
  meaning that if they want to extend the map , they will actually choose `` extend '' . 
  if changing maps is what the majority wants , that 's also what they get . 
  i do n't think you need to write some `` sourcepawn '' , whatever that is . 
  but that 's just my opinion . 
  because he secretly wants it . 
  also - er , - le and - ow . 
  ... that 's actually a good point . 
  gabe for president !, 
  it 's the only way we can find out !, 
  did n't they talk about something very similar in breaking bad ? 
  they even mention `` the soul '' ? 
  so wait , does that mean i can watch brotherhood without missing out on parts of the story ? 
  i thought brotherhood was just the second season and a few years later . 
  i do n't know where i got that idea . 
  and then the creator of the website finds out and ca n't cope with his guilt . 
  i can pretend to be a stick . 
  now why do i find this comment so funny ?
