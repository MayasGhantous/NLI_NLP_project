  could you explain what kaizo cavern is ? 
  is that what they are doing ? 
  making it longer ? 
  i heard of some angel beats !, 
  related stuff being made , but is that really what they meant ? 
  do you have a source ? 
   today , i 'm sure at least a few of you all noticed that someone posted a link referring to saul getting beaten up by gomez onset during filming . 
  i did n't . 
  and now i know . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/swq8b/so_i_just_watched_the_german_dub_of_community/ ) what i had to say . 
  it was meh . 
  i 'll give it a chance . 
  well , it fit his mouth movements , and it 's a number . 
  so i guess that 's why . 
  do you have an idea for what he should have said instead ? 
  ( not a rhetorical question , i am curious . ), 
  i read that exact same post yesterday . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  nope , i actually read it right there yesterday . 
  i typed `` german '' into the search bar of this subreddit to find discussion about it , and then found your post . 
  really ? 
  source ? 
  what do black dudes sound like in german ? 
  no , or at least they do n't call it `` community college '' there . 
  but in the german version , they did call it `` community college '' because the viewers are aware they are in america . 
  and even people who do n't know what a community college is get the idea after jeff says `` if i wanted to learn something , i would n't have gone to community college '' . 
  in general or just with community ? 
  good job not giving away his secret identity !, 
  i actually like dubs , but only if they 're good . 
  scrubs had an excellent german dub . 
  malcolm in the middle too . 
  just add `` and then my parents came in '' . 
  i ca n't see where he implied that . 
  nono , i 'm not in the mood for details . 
  this window reminds me of a puzzle . 
  ** puzzle !!, 
  no. 001 ( the broken window ) : ** oh no !, 
  mrs. crumpet 's window was broken by an unknown perpetrator !, 
  three kids were named the scene and the police asked them who did it . 
  after giving their testimonies , little adolf shouts , `` billy is lying !, 
  nothing he ever says is the truth ! '' . 
  billy says `` all cleopatra ever does is lying . 
  nothing she says is true '' . 
  both of you always lie !!, 
  you 've never said the truth ! '', 
  if adolf says that billy always lies , and if billy says cleopatra always lies , and if cleopatra says that both of them always lie , who is lying and who is saying the truth ? 
  ** correct !!!, 
  billy is the only one who tells the truth . 
  ( he was also the one who broke the window , but he never got caught . 
  adolf and cleopatra died in jail . ), 
  you get 20 picarats !, 
  [ r1 , episode 25 ] ( / s `` the scene where suzaku shoots lelouch 's mask , making it crack and fall was easily one of the best in the entire series . '' ), 
  ... and time travellers and espers . 
  i have an alarm clock like that too someone in my class had one of those digital watches that beeped once every full hour . 
  whenever i heard that sound , i started to question reality for a brief moment . 
  people think uhf is bad ? 
  ... why ? 
  this bot is n't for finding reposts , it 's for finding what this picture is fixing . 
  look at me , hector . 
  the music sounds like something out of durarara !, 
  ... whoa . 
  [ sorry , here you go . 
  i walked away because [ the guy told nico he was a hypocrite for being angry at him just because he sold them out for a small amount of money , while nico actually does the same thing in the game . 
  that was actually a really good point . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  ** you 're drinking your parents ?!, 
  i thought that the girls around him mistook him for the real johnny depp and asked * him * for an autograph . 
  i could see joseph gordon levitt as spike . 
  never played the game , but what 's your problem with what you mentioned in the spoiler ? 
  to get the best experience looking at this picture , listen to [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=llhb0_fvawxrpnpkyghydjpw&amp;v=yabw-ksikla#t=22s ) while looking at it . 
  i loved this line : http://youtu.be/nstduqdc_5e#t=2m50s, 
  okay , that emoticon cracks me up . 
  just ... just look at it !, 
  how is that awkward ? 
  oh man , [ another picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ragix.jpg ) of an evil-looking person with a cat . 
  i do n't know which one i like more . 
  do you have more of that article by any chance ? 
  i do n't know what 's creepier , the video itself or the fact that [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/tbsdww7moew ) is in the related videos . 
  it 's ... kind of appropriate . 
  ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le ** ** le **, 
  i guess this cat looks cooler , but the one next to schmosby has an evil stare !, 
  maybe he thought `` jamie '' was a boy 's name and that their last name was black box . 
  remember why he chose the words `` steins ; gate '' ? 
  [ final episode ] ( / s `` it does n't really mean anything . '' ), 
  how much of your stand-ups is made up and how much is the truth ? 
  i 'm pretty sure paper mario is generally considered a great game . 
  yes , but did n't reddit originally use, 
  ** i n c e p t i o n **, 
  when something had some sort of twist ? 
  they started using it instead of, 
  ** l o s t **, 
  after the show ended . 
  the word `` islandception '' is right on the picture . 
  the first line is said by the guy talking in the first picture . 
  the second line is said by the guy talking in the second picture . 
  etherdrama1 's comment is a reference to pulp fiction . 
  now that i think about it , walkinonthesidewalks 's comment is really funny out of context . 
  with internet explorer as her ** button to the internet ** . 
  wait ... paper mario ttyd ? 
  i loved that place .
