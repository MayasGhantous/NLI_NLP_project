  was that a joke or are you serious ? 
   it 's all lies , every word of it !, 
  he was n't original , he was n't a martian , he was n't philip fry and since when is he a `` the '' ? 
  why does not taking the booster make the tow rope obtainable anyway ? 
  i suggest you unsubscribe from this subreddit until you 're done . 
  seriously . 
  spoilers everywhere . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=znlpg7waojo#t=54s ) an unused song from the game . 
  it 's the laputa theme . 
  can you find another video of the episode ? 
  i ca n't view it because it 's blocked in my country . 
  nope , not correct . 
  it is . 
  what the fuck . 
  he took the experience orbs before he took the picture ? 
  what the fuck did you just post ? 
  psssht , you can still make a decent version with german rhyming . 
  i think he said `` lalo did n't send you ? 
  no lalo ?!, 
  [ obligatory . 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/fpwbdnkngis ), 
  i loved spm . 
  ghost trick . 
  just do it . 
  how is the quality this good ? 
  i was wondering why his ears developed so much !, 
  because it was already answered two minutes before he wrote that comment . 
  i 'm more annoyed by all the intentionally immature shit in the chat like `` lol i wipe my dick on a kid 's teddy bear ama '' and stupid stuff like that . 
  it 's not funny . 
  nobody 's laughing . 
  making clear that you 're just being immature on purpose to annoy us makes it worse . 
  ... you think they made this so there would be a way to see the scene on the internet in some way ? 
  you drown after playing saria 's song ? 
  [ first thing i thought too . 
  i expected a server that would hate childish comments , not a server that would express that hate by imitating them by being just as childish . 
  nym was actually online yesterday !, 
  everyone was happy and he ... had capslock on . 
  permanently . 
  is n't it `` jack '' ? 
  now , where was i ? 
  now we 'll have to wait until dcwj deletes his comment . 
  key also made * angel beats ! * . 
  ( or people from key worked on it , at least . ), 
  because it looks good , has a good soundtrack and also awesome characters . 
  [ whaaaaaaaat ? 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/l5trref4x5k ), 
  oh god , that 's where i saw it for the first time too . 
  that reminds me , does english have a word for `` doch '' ? 
  i think french has `` si '' . 
  ** habe nun , ach , philosophie !!!, 
  do you have a link to that scene ? 
  people on reddit do n't talk about king of queens enough . 
  could also be that twist a few minutes after that . 
  op said it . 
  nice try , * corner of a table * . 
  can someone reupload that map or something ? 
  i went [ here ] ( http://www.voterocket.net/tf2server/maps/achievement_golden_wrench_v4.bsp ) but it wo n't show a download link . 
  sounds like something coach z would say . 
  duster , look away . 
  edgeworth is a prosecutor . 
  ... okay , that was kinda funny , i admit . 
  actually , it is !, 
  i remember chitanda repeatedly pulling the book away from him , while he was just trying to read . 
  ** oh god i did n't even see that **, 
  i wonder if he/she actually predicted that i would say that . 
  does the pope shit in the woods ? 
  yes , let us never ever do nice stuff again , except when someone 's life is on the line . 
  i love the fact that its creator is phoenix wright in the pwmusical . 
  are you continuing this argument for the hell of it or do you still think you 're right ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbawce6du3w ) is probably my favorite video by them . 
  at first i thought `` so ? 
  he 's still a prosecutor in that game . '', 
  but then i realized that edgey saves people by `` prosecuting '' the real murderers . 
  so in reality , edgeworth and phoenix basically have the same job , though edgeyworth has it a lot easier . 
  also , the folks over at court-records . net are working on a fan localization , and i guess it 's going pretty well . 
  is n't it already finished and there are reviews of it ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://z11.invisionfree.com/court_records/index.php?showforum=26 ) the subforum for it . 
  also , here 's the progress on it :, 
  literal translation progress :, 
  - case 1 : 100 %, 
  - case 2 : 99 %, 
  - case 3 : 33 %, 
  - maps : 99 %, 
  - choice buttons : 99 %, 
  literal translation means before they localize it , i.e. 
  before they make the text more `` readable '' and insert english names . 
  i seriously do n't get the difference . 
  is it because there are fewer theskatingrink-esque maps !, 
  but if you saw a level 3 teleporter outside of spawn getting sapped , you would n't be able to switch to engy to get rid of it !, 
  as a german speaker , i find sayng `` you do n't win friends with salad '' multiple times hard . 
  the title mentions it 's from recettear . 
  [ like this ? 
  ] ( http://www.court-records.net/sounds/godot%20-%20%28french%29%20objection.wav ), 
  it 's from the game phoenix wright : ace attorney . 
  that 's just the sound that gives the objection more umph . 
  we are talking about the word `` gau '' as in `` regions '' , like the gau niederdonau etc. 
  are you thinking of ** g ** r\u00f6\u00dfter ** a ** nzunehmender ** u ** nfall ? 
  i bet timetowander is going to post a pic of the comment before it was deleted , which shows that the deleted comment was by timetowander himself , saying `` it was me the entire time !, 
  well ... what 's the point of this post then !, 
  i liked the season finale .
