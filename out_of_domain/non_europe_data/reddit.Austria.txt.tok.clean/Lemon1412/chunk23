  does super paper mario * count * or does it not count as a game made by nintendo ? 
  oh god , almost everyone in detective conan got a new , english name , and everything that based around japanese letters was turned into something else . 
  the german translation , on the other hand , changed nothing at all and acknowledged the fact that they are japanese . 
  she was really abusive . 
  the supporting cast in the show were great [ ... ], 
  i actually see kyon as a main character , pretty much at the same level as haruhi . 
  he 's also my favorite character ( crispin freeman as his voice actor helps a lot ) . 
  you could say he 's the watson of the show . 
  and the first half was the ( in my opinion , no sarcasm ) completely necessary setup for the rest . 
  is there even a main character ? 
  i mean , firo is main character ... ish . 
  good quote . 
  they really were ** waaaaaay ** too careless with using time travel . 
  ( and they were showing it to pretty much everyone !! ), 
  some spoilers : i love how the show is so * symmetrical * , too . 
  i mean , the main twist happens in episode 12 , which is the middle of the show . 
  the first half is where `` things happen '' and the second half is where `` things that happened get explained and also undone '' . 
  and the last episode is extremely similar as the first episode , just from a different point of view . 
  huh ? 
  what do you think happens at the end ? 
  no , i mean , you said you put two and two together . 
  what 's your deduction ? 
  just curious . 
  i was about to say `` are you simon cowell ?

  you play osu !, 
  and you 're learning japanese ? 
  awesome . 
  ** but you fucking used an apostrophe instead of an accent aigu . 
  this is pretty annoying , since i always check my stats page after playing . 
  ( it gives me a goal in my pathetic life . ), 
  has anyone else ever had this problem and more importantly , how can i/someone else fix it ? 
  okay , it works now , thanks . 
  holy fuck did n't expect this at all especially not from you, 
  ... well ... how about you 're ... * dick eu * ??

  after he grabbed her ass . 
  well you should n't watch [ durarara !! ] ( http://images.wikia.com/durarara/images/5/57/durarara !, 
  ! _ e09_09m_11s . jpg ) then !, 
  did a google image search , it seems to be [ this ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/10278/the_idolm@ster ) ? 
  whoa . 
  reverse grandfather paradox . 
  i think . 
  ... did he really say that ? 
  link ? 
  yeah , well , i did n't like/understand the ending at all . 
  i mean , i ca n't even describe why i do n't like it . 
  i ca n't really call it a cop-out since there was a lot of foreshadowing , but i do n't think they explained that parallel-world-robot-time-travel-orb stuff enough . 
  well , you can watch meet the pyro [ here ] ( http://youtu.be/wuhonx8qt3i ) , but i had the same problem . 
  does anyone know what the site looked like after it hit zero ? 
  when the video was all pyro-vision for the first time , my jaw dropped , i just could n't believe it . 
  it was ... so unexpected . 
  and then i burst out laughing like a madman . 
  exactly !, 
  i do n't understand why so many people find it brilliant . 
  after reading so much about how great as is , i could n't even believe the ending . 
  i do n't even understand it . 
  was time travel involved ? 
  what 's with that light orb stuff ? 
  it came up like twice in the show . 
  well , in the game itself , you see everything out of the pyro 's point of view . 
  so it ca n't be the mask . 
  do they pay you more if you let them do stuff to your butt ? 
  breathing_balls sounds like it could be the best tv show ever , starring bryan cranston and aaron paul . 
  what 's the reference ? 
  i know a trope on tvtropes named `` and i must scream '' . 
  is it a quote ? 
  edit : okay , i visited the page and it says it 's from `` i have no mouth and i must scream '' . 
  okay . 
  yes , even the name of the set of clothes is named `` urban professional '' . 
  do n't worry , [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/vsm3t/the_buddy_system_xpost_from_gifs/c57asqe ) guy did n't get it either . 
  does this mean my friends who watched breaking bad possibly * do n't * know about the brilliance of this scene ? 
  did n't aaron paul call it `` season 6 '' at some point ? 
  ( twitter or something . ), 
  hm , you 're a gentleman of the medical type , but with the air of a military man . 
  clearly an army doctor , then . 
  your face is dark , so you just came from the tropics , but that 's not your natural skin , since your wrists are n't dark . 
  you have undergone hardship and sickness , as your haggard face says clearly . 
  your left arm has been injured . 
  you hold it in a stiff and unnatural manner . 
  where in the tropics could an army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded ? 
  clearly in afghanistan . 
  yeah , i can see that by looking at your skull . 
  so you have to watch every single movie in the world before looking at it ? 
  my gosh , maybe he has the droids too !, 
  what ? 
  i have it and have never done anything productive in my entire life . 
  he did n't say he would n't enjoy it . 
  my pin number is 0001 , because i am number 1 !,

  nice , i 'm at * the adventure of the copper beeches * right now . 
  crispin freeman all the way !, 
  not only is his voice and personality awesome , but also the character he voices . 
  kyon ? 
  look at the picture again , knowing that steve lost his left leg in a car accident years ago . 
  * 18 seconds of laughter *, 
  and then [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xxb9c.png ) happened .
