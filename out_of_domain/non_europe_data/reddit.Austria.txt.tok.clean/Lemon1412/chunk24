  then tell me what game it is . 
   i know this kid , linus , he 's black . 
  his dad really likes linux . 
  he did . 
  she was going to be in 3-4 , but allan was too lazy to add the princess so he kept putting it off by adding more levels . 
  it was * okay * . 
  i have a question . 
  is it really correct to write `` 90 's '' or should it be `` 90s '' because it 's just plural ? 
  as someone from a first world country , i 've never eaten ketchup or a burger . 
  i do n't , but i love to party . 
  i eat chicken mcnuggets and fries every time . 
  well ... i just ate things that are not burgers while i was alive . 
  there 's no real reason why i have n't tried one yet . 
  what did he say ? 
  as a german speaker , i read that in bully herbig 's voice . 
  [ or is it ?!, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny2scpc_n5w&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=40s ), 
  walt jr. eats breakfast in a lot of scenes ( or so i 've heard , i never actually noticed it ) and it has become some sort of running gag on this subreddit . 
  ( before that , the running gag was the fact that walt jr. walks down hallways all the time and does nothing else . ), 
  yeah , but ... there 's already a character named laszlo in half life 2 !, 
  and he 's dead !, 
  he was the finest mind of his generation !, 
  well ... she talked about cherry blossoms once . 
  what was that 24 thing all about !? 
  that was brilliant . 
  i like spoony . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  i have n't been following him lately . 
  caution : oh my god , stop saying that !, 
  the red door is on l street ... l street has a red door . 
  why ? 
  was it , like ... a sick dog ? 
  nice , koizumi as akise aru is perfect !, 
  there 's also that bowling episode in malcolm in the middle . 
  that 's a nice koala . 
  aaagh , any tips on how to watch that video if you 're from europe ?!, 
  edit : [ nevermind , it 's on dailymotion . 
  ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xs95w5_steinsgate-official-english-cast-trailer-part-1_shortfilms ), 
  tom cruise is reddit 's co za asy . 
  just admit it . 
  gordon freeman , the main character of the half life games . 
  it 's from [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6pxrwgjzzw ) video in case you do n't know . 
  as an austrian , i understand ** everything ** . 
  the black vertical line . 
  i feel like i 'm the only one who 's heard that joke a thousand fucking times and is sick of it . 
  in the first episode , he sees a word on the floor : rache . 
  the awesome flying text said :, 
  god damnit , rache is ( f. ) , not ( n. ) !, 
  also , in the german version of the show ( which i really like ) , the couple spoke french . 
  ( if you mean the two people he bumped into and then borrowed a book from . ), 
  i thought the lab guy was american and that 's why he had an accent . 
  hmm ... maybe , but do you really write it like that ? 
  awesome , that means sherlock is now perfect instead of almost perfect . 
  and do n't forget your booties 'cause it 's cooooold out there today !, 
  well , i thought ** monk ** was pretty much the best detective show ( before i saw sherlock ) . 
  it was funny , witty , something really damn intense and also heartwrenching . 
  and it has eight seasons , so there 's that . 
  ( did n't really notice a decline in quality though . ), 
  my name is daniel too !!, 
  let 's have dinner . 
  is it pomf pomf ? 
  do you have a link to that `` breakdown '' ? 
  is `` y '' really a vowel ? 
  what is this , r/circlejerk ? 
  no , this is r/gaming . 
  oh ... * right * ... 
  yeah , he said it in the mini-golf episode in the second season . 
  * louisiana woman , mississippi maaaan !, 
  was n't this a reddit comment a while ago ? 
  if anything , it was nichijou . 
  i have never heard this anywhere else , only on reddit . 
  is this an american thing or something ? 
  he kinda reminds me of king from cave story . 
  it 's also spelled fritzl . 
  the guy is most likely not from germany . 
  what about when someone takes a potato chip ? 
  you missed one guy . 
  he 's on the right , in the back , wearing a white cap . 
  is england the only country that 's not america ? 
  holy crap , i 'd never noticed that this makes no sense . 
  he 's the one . 
  kill him . 
  you click the wrench thingie on the top right of chrome , click tools , then `` add-ons '' or whatever it is you want . 
  then you just drag the file you downloaded from the res page ( . crx ) to the add-ons page . 
  at first , i thought it was a reference to [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/49urv.png ) . 
  is that a fuckin ' mexican outside ? 
  no , it 's just a lawnmower . 
  oh , so yeah . 
  oh , i thought you were going for `` she looks gorgeous on that picture btw '' or something . 
  is what we read in history books completely true ? 
  because some things ** are ** and some things are ** not ** !, 
  when i saw the title of a thread and immediately knew what the top comment was going to be . 
  this has happened to me many times now , and i 'm not sure if that 's a good thing because it kind of proves how unoriginal and predictable reddit can be sometimes . 
  okay , but the text actually says something like `` did you see he '' and not `` did you see him '' . 
  `` did you see him '' would mean `` hast du ihn gesehen '' . 
  well excuuuuuse me , princess . 
  ... did you just call the people you apologized to `` dicks '' ? 
  well ? 
  apologize to them !, 
  not for calling them dicks .
