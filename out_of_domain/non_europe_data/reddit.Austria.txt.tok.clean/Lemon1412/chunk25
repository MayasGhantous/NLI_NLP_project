  i sometimes accidently hit capslock , especially when i 'm logging into an account and intending to press tab . 
  this can get frustrating when friends are nearby and you 're typing your password in front of them . 
  so when i log into reddit , after i typed in my username , i want to hit tab but hit capslock . 
  the result ? 
  what i want :, 
  * ** username ** : lemon1412, 
  * ** password ** : ***************, 
  what i get :, 
  * ** username ** : lemon1412danielisawesome, 
  it 's not pronounced vaulter . 
  i have the exact same opinion . 
  i do n't know why , though . 
  i hated that scene where they were running in the woods and * everything * was exploding , but their version of the reichenbach disaster was great . 
  ( though unnecessary , because watson arrived at the scene before they jumped , so could n't he have helped ? ), 
  i did n't really like the `` mysteries '' of the first movie , because they all involved chemistry . 
  in-game name : watsuda, 
  preferred class : spy , pyro, 
  i 'm scared , i 've never played serious shit like this . 
  also , none of you can spell * preferred * . 
  i 'm not even gon na argue with that . 
  let 's talk in hour secret language . 
  * you forgot your flash drive , you forgot your flash drive , you forgot your flash drive , you forgot your flash drive , ... *, 
  did they make fun of him and crack jokes like : `` haha , breast cancer ? 
  sure it is n't lady vagina cancer ?! '', 
  i love when games have high buildings like this . 
  as soon as i walked out of the station in the beginning of hl2 , i saw the citadel and thought `` i want to go there . 
  i really hope that the game will end on the top of that building . 
  and wherever you are , you can see it . 
  the building is always there to remind you where you 're headed . 
  same goes with the shard in mirror 's edge . 
  it 's the last location of the game and you just kinda see it in every chapter . 
  ( and again , guess where the game ends . ), 
  the atmosphere in the beginning of episode 1 was fantastic and the scene at the end of episode 2 where [ you shoot the rocket into the portal to close it ] ( / spoiler '' '' ) was fantastic . 
  aaaand now i have to replay the games . 
  yeah , i thought so . 
  playing saharan spy is n't very strategic , it 's just `` take what you can get '' . 
  they should make a sherlock holmes anime . 
  guaranteed sherlockxjohn . 
  this always leads to your own profile too :, 
  [ http://facebook.com/profile.php?=73322363] ( http://www.lemonparty.org ) ^ ^ ^ nsfw, 
  dude , that is n't actually * your * profile . 
  it always links the one who clicks it to their own profile . 
  this works because the profile with that id does n't exist and it redirects you . 
  or did it ? 
  ( i 'm the same guy who posted the link in the first place . ), 
  that 's what you redditors get for constantly making fun of my name !, 
  ... and hit enter ? 
  yup . 
  if you click the link , you 'll realize the trick does n't actually work anymore . 
  so what do you do at daytime ? 
  you probably expected what i told you to expect . 
  facebook profile . 
  obviously because you 've visited your own facebook profile a lot . 
  i wrote the original comment and posted the link . 
  edit : actually , there are more things that do n't make sense about your comment . 
  what made you think that the intention of the original comment was to trick people into thinking i linked them to a specific fb profile ? 
  it says `` always leads to your own profile '' right there !, 
  and also , what does `` you did n't fall for a completely different joke '' mean ? 
  did you mean to write `` did '' ? 
  wait , what, 
  any scene in breaking bad season 5 with skyler and walt in it . 
  wait , was that a pun ? 
  there 's actually an edited version that shows something that implies he did n't die ? 
  who published that ? 
  so for some reason i thought i was on the comment page for [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gf2ky.jpg ) picture . 
  what a fitting comment . 
  i heard k-on is pretty good . 
  what ? 
  dude , spoilers . 
  who then traveled back to become the guy who saved bleeding kyon . 
  never read the books , but it 's heavily implied in the movie . 
  after the events of the movie , kyon has to go back to his bleeding self and say stuff like `` sorry for not stepping in sooner , do n't worry , it hurt for me too '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's in the beginning of the very first book , a study in scarlet . 
  * you got all 97 of them ?!, 
  aww , it 's waving !, 
  [ agreed . 
  i saw something like this on tv !, 
  you have to neutralize the troll 's karma !, 
  [ relevant . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8i7a2rrrte&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=162s ), 
  what about [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/0axseenxtsc ) ? 
  that was n't sarcasm . 
  it * is * in the pic . 
  did he say it was n't on the picture ? 
  i like bastion and phoenix wright . 
  sex tractor fan . 
  upward , i guess ? 
  * going to outer space , to shoot that dickbag in his face !, 
  is your name a death note reference ? 
  you should see that scene in the german dub . 
  holy shit . 
  obligatory explanation in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  dude , where the fuck were you 35 minutes ago ? 
  of course . 
  i will explain in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  it was made because japan is weird and japan is weird because that picture was made ? 
  contrary to popular belief , reddit actually consists of * individual people * !, 
  i might as well point out that this submission got upvoted too !, 
  whoa , man !, 
  do you also think of a banana when you see a banana ?
