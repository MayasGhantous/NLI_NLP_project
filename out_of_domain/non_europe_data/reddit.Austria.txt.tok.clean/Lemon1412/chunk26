  no one said what tiretred 's age is . 
  `` if you fail to eliminate the impossible to beat [ ewe ] clan , therefore , whatever map remains at the end , however hard it is to win there , will be where the sheep slayers win . '', 
  she said i played an important role at some point . 
  good enough for me !, 
  i am waiting for the one, 
  how is `` ca n't unsee '' a fitting title anyway ? 
  he never thought that [ brock `` smoked '' the cigarette . 
  the cigarette was just there to hide the poison , which was in a little glass thing . 
  smoking it would n't do anything . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  fun fact : in the german version of yoshi 's island , the piranha plant boss is named `` audrey '' . 
  puns ? 
  `` do n't be a dick '' can only be interpreted one way . 
  and he * was n't * a dick , he * drew * one . 
  reddit loves puns , and that was n't a pun , so reddit hates it . 
  [ kinda sorta relevant , maybe not .

  but since you saw it coming , should n't you have been expecting something else since everything that you 'd expect would make it foreseen , therefore would n't happen and you would n't have to prepare for it ? 
  did n't he start calling him doctor at the end of hl2 ? 
  not sure if he said doctor in this scene , though . 
  yeah , but this picture does n't really tell you anything important . 
  on the other hand , there is one big thing that could be spoiled to you , so watch out . 
  seriously ? 
  as a european , i do n't get this `` not available on dish '' running gag . 
  why do you guys keep mentioning it ? 
  it 's from the preview of next week 's episode . 
  is that frankenstein 's monster with a judge 's wig on your shirt ? 
  do n't say thaaat , it 's kind of a mini-spoiler . 
  some people do n't want to watch the previews . 
  what is a jeopardy joke ? 
  so , uh , what 's the name of this game ? 
  so ... how is n't he banned yet ? 
  today , he was spamming / me messages all the time . 
  in der bucht der piraten . 
  dich does n't sound like dick . 
  ** stop requesting catgroove !, 
  german ? 
  there 's no `` th '' sound in french either , so it could be both . 
  `` zuh '' would have been appropriate in place of what ? 
  when he said `` ze safe room '' , i pronounced the `` ze '' as `` zuh '' . 
  remember when it was bohemian rhapsody ? 
  good times . 
  i got the `` stealthy '' add-on for google chrome and it worked perfectly . 
  i 've heard like ten ways to bypass the `` not available in my country '' - things , but none of those worked until i found stealthy . 
  it 's so weird how he 's the first one to come to my mind even though there are so many other , probably much better , fictional characters out there . 
  maybe it 's because his brilliant mind is realistic enough to make me want to be like him ? 
  i did n't . 
  in the settings , i went to `` customized '' and it asked me to pick a country out of a list . 
  i picked usa and it worked . 
  i know , i was surprised too but i was desperate enough to try . 
  did you also cut down the grass and dig as many holes as possible ? 
  this post is what made me unsubscribe from this subreddit . 
  ( it is , how you say , the straw that broke the camels back . ), 
  either op is ~ ~ fucking stupid ~ ~ a bit ignorant or he is actually a master troll who trolls us by making us think that he got trolled . 
  this looks like the best game ever . 
  this is [ uryuu minene ] ( http://myanimelist.net/character/4966/minene_uryuu ) from the anime [ mirai nikki ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/10620/mirai_nikki_tv/ ) . 
  whoops . 
  if i recall correctly , this episode is not canon and was just some `` what-if '' ova . 
  who gives a shit ? 
  he asked something and got his answer . 
  i did n't even notice that . 
  you call that swimming ? 
  the dog ? 
  yeah , he 's credited as `` student # 1 '' . 
  does n't sound too important , but he * is * number one , so ... 
  okay , i literally lol 'd at this !, 
  hats off to you good sir !, 
  weird-ass griefer : moves your entire house and everything that is in it up by exactly one block and maybe you wo n't even notice . 
  `` if you had killed watson , you would not have got out of this room alive . '', 
  the squares are n't even the same size !, 
  the whoosh was reflected back at you . 
  see , he has this condition . 
  thanks !, 
  did n't even know today was my cake day !, 
  why ? 
  the guy who made the picture you are commenting on , so you 're definitely not the only one . 
  this is n't something that ticks me off , but it 's pretty confusing , in an interesting way . 
  the [ celebrity paradox ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/celebrityparadox ) . 
  example : the guy who plays wilson in ** house ** is also the guy who plays the lead character in ** dead poets society ** . 
  however , they actually mention dead poets society * in * house !, 
  so who plays the lead character within the house universe ? 
  you 're saying that if walt had n't been there , it would have happened anyway ? 
  if so : jesse and jane were spooning . 
  walt shaking jesse while he was sleeping is what caused her to roll on her back in the first place . 
  '' -- if you had to choose between a suit and a pot of gold ? '', 
  wait , what the fuck ? 
  did you swap the faces too ? 
  edit : wait , what the fuck ?!? 
  there 's two guys one one side and to girls on the other side ? 
  has he ever seen heisenberg with that outfit ? 
  [ i just drew a bridge using ms paint . 
  did the vet say anything else about it ? 
  does it somehow have effects on the cat 's eyesight ? 
  funniest part is that he deleted the comment . 
  `` tongue-in-cheek '' . 
  it just sounds so cute . 
  and then you realized it was single player . 
  we should 've believed what romani said !, 
  did you try the `` view in highest resolution '' button in the upper right of every picture ? 
  there are many other parallels between house and holmes .
