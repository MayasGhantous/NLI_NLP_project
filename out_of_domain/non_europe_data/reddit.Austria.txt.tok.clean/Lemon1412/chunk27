  can you really call it doppler effect if it 's just getting quieter because it 's moving away ? 
  i 've played this game for over 500 hours and i wear a purple gibus as every class . 
  ( except spy and pyro because set bonus . ), 
  i also sometimes play with vanilla loadout for fun . 
  once every hundred thousand years or so when the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow and the ... reddit ... doth ... repost ? 
  it sounds like a frog talking to a parrot !, 
  i bet op would love [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/gwqi0u3pbda ) video . 
  maybe you are , but * what does it matter * ?!, 
  you still live your life just as it is and the rules of life stay the same . 
  the things you defined as relationships and society when you were young still exist in the same way for you , even if someone tells you that `` you 're the only one who exists '' . 
  wow , this is the kind of comment you 'd expect in r/circlejerk . 
  now i feel sorry for the little guy !, 
  is n't justin bieber already blond ?!, 
  the title should be something like `` justin bieber is a blond harry potter '' or `` black-haired justin bieber '' , but this makes no sense . 
  i disagree on the `` dragging it out '' part . 
  there were many loose ends left after season 4 that had to be tied up , and there are still a few left . 
  i already deleted my comment in shame . 
  i mean ... * someone * did . 
  now do a next time on game grumps !, 
  i saw an austrian commercial that had a banjo kazooie sound in it . 
  the one that kazooie makes when you press a in mid-air . 
  bang !, 
  he was being sarcastic . 
  it was a joke . 
  because you tagged him `` fire cooter '' in purple . 
  stop saying stuff like that . 
  a really good anime about time travel that starts off kinda slow . 
  aaand call me maybe is playing again , 6 minutes after i made this thread . 
  edit : we could also ban e \u00b2 penispumppickpocket . 
  would you ? 
  you should have called me . 
  maybe . 
  is n't that the wrong reference ? 
  squidward, 
   if you have n't seen it look at it, 
  okay , now go look at everything you have n't seen . 
  deadbunny posted at seven minutes earlier . 
  hover over the `` x hours ago '' text . 
  i keep you naked on purpose . 
  how reddit of him . 
  mine is probably this : [ code geass final episode spoilers !, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/fo9-mxjcjxu ), 
  b-but ... !, 
  crispin freeman ... !, 
  it 's actually three scenes , but the uploader cut out the unimportant segments that did n't include jeremiah gottwald . 
  ( the ones where that one guy is talking to his disabled sister . ), 
   he did n't notice that ~ ~ that ~ ~ . 
  ffy . 
  er hat dich ** was ?!, 
  so what he 's saying is ... every time the car was damaged , there was a reason for it to be damaged that was in some way related to the show 's storyline ? 
  like episode 11 of season 4 , when he was in the car with hank . 
  the guy from othello ? 
  [ steins ; gate spoilers ] ( / s `` could you call her a villain , though ? 
  she was crazy , but not truely evil or anything . 
  fuck christina 's father , though . 
  he 's like the manfred von karma of anime . '' ), 
  the blood on the grill of the car that was used to run over two people probably * symbolizes * that the car was used to run over two people !, 
  seriously though , [ phoenix wright and steins ; gate spoilers ] ( / s `` both christina 's father and von karma commit a murder that causes a great deal of trouble for everyone around them , even years in the future . '' ), 
  `` a tf2 hat is just a hat with another hat 's hat on . '', 
  wow , why is it a spy in both pictures ? 
  i came to this . 
  why the fuck are we in / r/pics anyway ? 
  my list is as follows :, 
  tooni, 
  that one croatian guy, 
  he probably even has all 97 nes games . 
  i 've been liking her more and more since season 4 . 
  that 's not even what the switcharoo is !, 
  ... then you still have to answer the question . 
  oh , wait , that 's blood . 
  dude , did n't you get beat up by a chick in decline of video gaming ? 
  ends with phenomenon . 
  dude , spoilers . 
  ( like , big spoilers . ), 
  they do n't have to go for 100 % in bk , but they have already missed a lot of stuff , which means there will be a moment where they stand in front of a note door or a picture and they do n't have enough notes/jiggies to continue . 
  if they need 10 more notes , they have to go in a world where they got 90 or fewer notes and then they have to collect all the notes they already collected , plus ten . 
  i do n't think they 'll even finish banjo kazooie . 
  no you did n't !, 
  seriously ? 
  the sound quality of that one video is just bad . 
  good god !, 
  d-did it fall off ? 
  is n't that a tie-hen ? 
  would n't it be better if they made a tie with hens on it ? 
  whenever someone tells that joke , one guy says exactly what you just said . 
  yeah , there 's two archy where there should be an archy . 
  he kinda looks like walter jr. 
  now try reading the right colon only . 
  the deaf person will annoy all the other office workers and they probably wo n't even know where it 's coming from . 
  i have n't laughed this much in weeks !, 
  `` an '' comes in front of vowel * sounds * , `` a '' comes in front of consonant * sounds * . 
  a duck , an apple , a unicorn , an hour, 
  you can really look forward to the ending of that episode , it 's amazing . 
  looking out the window of his loft at night . 
  this is as far as we can go . 
  do you know the old flash series `` decline of video gaming '' ? 
  he was the three villains in that . 
  how was it not obvious that the red option in the beginning was the selected one ? 
  go away . 
  where the hell is groompbot ?
