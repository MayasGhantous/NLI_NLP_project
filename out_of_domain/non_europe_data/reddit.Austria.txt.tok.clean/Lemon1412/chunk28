  i think he knows how you spell it since he read it . 
  well , they have to save sometimes too , do n't they ? 
  are you serious ? 
  how the fuck does this even get upvoted ? 
  how do you know if someone has a wacky name before knowing their name ? 
  yes , i hate it when reddit comment threads are n't always the same and completely predictable . 
  o captain !, 
  my captain !, 
  ooh , sweet !, 
  why are you here ? 
  a jeopardy joke !, 
  what do you call a joke with the punchline first ? 
  are you alone and driving ? 
  dude , watch the road !, 
  if not , play some game with the other person ( s ) in the car . 
  how about an alphabet game ? 
  a conversation where the sentences start with the next letter in the alphabet . 
  search reddit for racist jokes ? 
  actually , reddit is not one being , it consists of many different individuals with different opinions . 
  let 's hope they do n't have reddit accounts . 
  if i recall correctly , the, 
  ** i n c e p t i o n **, 
  thing was a meme on reddit too , and it was used as a response to a twist or something . 
  ( today it 's `` directed by m. night shyamalan '' and before inception it was `` lost '' , but since the series ended they needed a new meme . ), 
  vincent . 
  the optional ones that david cross gives you ? 
  manfred von karma from phoenix wright : ace attorney . 
  does that count ? 
  god , it was satisfying to just see his sweating sprite . 
  i 've been thinking about that 9/11 thing too for a while . 
  would n't the plane still crash into the towers , which kills the passengers and destroys both plane and towers ? 
  what do you guys think would be an effective way to stop the whole thing from happening ? 
  is `` dill pickle moment '' a thing now ? 
  the voice actor of zero . 
  just wanted to throw that information in as a fun fact . 
  ( he plays tobias f\u00fcnke in arrested development ), 
  did you see the film ? 
  they tried , but the * door * sank . 
  i love how daisuke ono voices a major ( ? ), 
  character in k , while he voices the character k in virtue 's last reward . 
  ( and both of them are fairly new ! ), 
  i was on l 's side right after the ray penber thing . 
  mr. e sounds like mystery . 
  i am reddit 's medulla oblongata . 
  this made me want to read that book . 
  i 've heard about it before , but i do n't really know anything about it . 
  ... dna evol, 
  are you the guy from airplane ? 
  it would still be spelled `` autism '' , would n't it ? 
  this is always one of the top answers whenever this joke gets posted . 
  seriously . 
  thank you for this . 
  i hate it when the default answer to this question is `` no , you can start with this one since they explain all the stuff from the previous game '' . 
  wrong . 
  looking at the photo in the director 's office for the first time was one of my favorite moments in the game . 
  that would n't have happened if i had n't played 999 first . 
  edit : and you 'll probably have to play vlr to understand the next zero escape game . 
  i 'm begging you , ** please ** play 999 first . 
  there are so many `` holy shit '' moments in vlr that would n't be there if you do n't play 999 . 
  if you want to play 999 right now , just use an emulator ( and , of course , buy it afterwards ) . 
  i 'm serious . 
  i played 999 first and the impact of some revelations was much greater . 
  the people who have n't played 999 first wo n't know what they have missed . 
  but as someone who has played both games in order , i know what you * would * miss . 
  edit : i finished 999 with all endings in about three days ( summer holidays ) . 
  you really should n't be in a rush to play vlr . 
  999 is really good too . 
  why do you only prove some things ? 
  more like :, 
  a : i bet you ca n't be quiet for a minute straight . 
  b : yes , i can . 
  a : okay , i say `` one , two ... '' and then you say `` three '' , and only ** after ** you said `` three '' , you will have to be quiet for a minute . 
  b : okay . 
  a : one , two ... 
  b : three !, 
  a : haha , you said something !, 
  should n't you know if she knows what totoro is ? 
  you did n't see him because he is hiding from you . 
  maybe the hype behind the anime is , oh i do n't know , related to the episodes you have n't seen yet ? 
  are you trying to blow us to shit , sherlock !, 
  yeah , i enjoyed clannad and as until i saw the ending . 
  someone please explain to me how that was n't a cop-out . 
  i think he 's talking about top gun ? 
  edit : in the third episode , he said `` you know what 's dangerous ? 
  your obsession with me . 
  seriously , lana , call kenny loggins , cause you 're in the danger zone . 
  from top gun ... ? '', 
  nah , he 's right . 
   no one can get in or out . 
  both words come from * kid * , ya dunce . 
  do n't tell me what to do !, 
  christo does none of that . 
  plus the land art . 
  shit , i ca n't think of any tool puns !,
