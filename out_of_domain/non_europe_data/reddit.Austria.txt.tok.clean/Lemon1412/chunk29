  just watch the fate/stay night anime and nothing else . 
  most of those are n't even animals !, 
  maybe he was one of the people who do n't know what xkcd is ? 
  i mean , if someone had asked me what i think xkcd is before i started reading it , i would have assumed it was a porn site . 
  i mean , just look at that `` x '' in the name !, 
  i practically feel dirty looking at it . 
  well , i guess this is cheating , but ... panty and stocking with garterbelt . 
  it symbolized what mrkerij said . 
  ( it was a warning . ), 
  there are easy-to-use spoiler tags . 
  also , `` dumbfuck '' ? 
  seriously ? 
  also , 999 for the ds . 
  ( make it similar to higurashi concerning the alternate endings . ), 
  please refrain from asking off-topic questions like this on the rugc_europe subreddit . 
  i would recommend / r/fixit . 
  the hard working ingo !, 
  to even know what movie `` closing your loop '' is in , you have to have gotten to that part in the movie already , which is like 10 minutes in . 
  touch, 
  eat your peas, 
  no , the landlady . 
  or he got the joke and continued it ? 
  is n't he usually the victim in those situations ? 
  it 's a reference to the movie . 
  `` you know what 's cooler than a million dollars ? 
  one billion dollars . '', 
  well now you 're just milking it !, 
  i know , but he probably forgot about that . 
  or maybe i 'm completely on the wrong track !, 
  yeah , the last mission was n't that hard , but if you fuck up , you have to start aaaaaaall over . 
  super meat boy was really hard , but not frustrating . 
  at least not to me . 
  ( i got 100 % , only using keyboard . 
  i have bragging rights . ), 
  the awesome thing about super meat boy is that it 's so fast paced and restarts instantly when you die . 
  most importantly , the music does n't stop . 
  that is such a huge difference even though it 's such a simple thing . 
  ps : fuck you , i wan na be the guy . 
  interesting . 
  as a 17-year-old austrian , the three english teachers i 've had so far talked perfect english without an accent . 
  although the best english speakers in class are only better because the time they 've spent watching videos on the internet or english episodes of tv shows . 
  oh god , this reminds me of some reddit story where a guy watched some bugs bunny episode over and over as a kid because he was so turned on when he saw the scene where bugs was at the barber . 
  can anyone link me to that ? 
  have you already seen the video ? 
  ** san ** , you baka gaijin . 
  the black and bitter end . 
  i thought it was audrey ii . 
  the only instance in which asking `` why is the link purple ? '', 
  is justified . 
  decypher it on wikipedia like the other 99 % . 
  ( also i ca n't remember . ), 
  yeah , well , it 's easier of you use text to tell us the plot of the episode right on the picture . 
  bonus points for anyone who can provide the quote for this scene . 
  it 's brotherhood , but not the correct scene . 
  what a fucking dick !, 
  ... details ? 
  how did you react ? 
  did anyone else other than you complain ? 
  it 's like the intro of the naked gun !, 
  now find the grammatical errors . 
  should be `` dic nominem meum '' , i think . 
   european pubs are generally silent, 
   this is not true, 
   so you can speak for all european pubs having high skill level ? 
  that 's not how stuff works . 
  probably someone from ** persona 4 ** , since everyone got a lot of development in that game . 
  what the fuck are opinions, 
  source code is on a train . 
  it 's by the same director as moon . 
  and before that he made ssbb machinima , sometimes collaborating with dexterboy . 
  because this one guy is reddit . 
  no , that 's reversing entropy !, 
  there 's nicer ways to say that . 
  play katawa shoujo then . 
  they had a very similar conversation in the `` walking around with a beard in ukraine '' discussion yesterday . 
  ukrainian people actually use ) instead of  . 
  gamakichi is obviously ukrainian and smiles because overly attached girlfriend did something so nice . 
  favorite : either baccano !, 
  or the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya . 
  i do n't think that i 'll ever be able to watch haruhi subbed . 
  the english voice actors just grew on me . 
  least favorite : well , i 've actually liked every dub i 've seen so far , but i watched like 2 minutes of higurashi dubbed , so i guess that 's gon na be it . 
  the punchline is n't the answer to the question ; it 's the reason why he thinks it 's stupid that they have that option . 
  example : why ca n't we go outside ? 
  it 's not even raining !, 
  both sentences are said by the same person , and the second sentence does n't answer the first , it even says why we * should * go outside . 
  most jokes of that format ask us a question , and then answer it . 
  but in this case , the guy who asked asked the question first , and then , as a punchline , told us the reason why he asked . 
  it 's like he 's asking us , since he does n't know the answer . 
  pizza . 
  lamps . 
  it already works , but i guess the punchline should be `` seriously , i do n't want my friends knowing i use google + ! '', 
  or something . 
  donald glover . 
  uh oh , 17k comment karma and only three days of reddit . 
  he might be the new ... whatever . 
  the cat from the second phoenix wright game ? 
  dude , he helped you solve the case !, 
  ... and you literally sat on it which is how it got in there ? 
  ... i do n't know what these are , but it 's eight episodes , so i can assume .
