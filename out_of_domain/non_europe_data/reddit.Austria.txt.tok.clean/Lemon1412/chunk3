  took me four seconds . 
  sorry for being a dick . 
  okay , i do n't get this meme . 
  would anybody care to explain ? 
  what the fuck . 
  you guys can make a meme out of * everything * , ca n't you ?!, 
  i 'm gon na have a pregnant if this does n't stop . 
  how can you possibly know that ? 
  it 's even funnier because he reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnjbx_-btp8 ) guy . 
  in the description , there are links to the other parts . 
  they are not as stupid , but still entertaining . 
  and how would you know you 're supposed to ignore it if you ignore it ? 
  and if he always existed , why did n't he create the universe earlier ? 
  killjoy . 
  i do n't get why it is n't `` joykiller '' . 
   i took shits backwards like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ej943.jpg ), 
  i ca n't be the only one who pictured that totally wrong and was afraid to click the link !, 
  also , i ca n't believe that there are some people who do n't know how to stop a fan from oscillating . 
  yes , but if you started at the bottom of the o , writing it counter clockwise would be better . 
  you should never call someone who swallows a slut, 
  sucking it in . 
  with his ass . 
  what the hell . 
  when i clicked this for the first time , it just showed the first frame of the video forever . 
  i was like `` oh , i get it . 
  the title is ` splash attack ' , which is as useless as me watching this video ! '' . 
  well , i wanted to send the video to a friend , went back to the page and it started playing !, 
  it was actually a good video , ending was pretty cool , but it looped for a bit too long . 
  edit : i just found out how this happened . 
  i pressed play too early . 
  try to click play as early as possible , before it finishes that weird bouncy animation . 
  heh , i guess it 's time for digg and reddit to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel !, 
  `` it hurts itself in its confusion . '', 
  i remember my pok\u00e9mon being confused so many times . 
  when i choose the attack , i hope for the next sentence to start with the name of my pok\u00e9mon , as in, 
  `` pikachu used thunder bolt ! '', 
  ... but most of the time the sentence starts with `` it '' and i get all angry . 
  why did i read that first part as `` avenue q '' ? 
  pedeland was merely quoting the guy in the video , just like you . 
  he did n't mean to ask what your comment means . 
  also , the video you linked us to has been removed by the user . 
  thank you !, 
  you made my night . 
  pff , [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sjih3.png ) is real !, 
  i censored her name , so as long as there are no search engines of some sort on the internet , she should be safe . 
   bored , quit , check, 
  i thought , `` oh , the font reminds me of the damage in super smash bros. '' , but the end still surprised me . 
   general organization for narcissism affected douchebags ( or gonad ), 
  [ reminds me of that flash movie i saw years, 
  ago . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwrwcpcvqs#t=1m56s ), 
  they made the exact same joke !, 
  needs more upvotes !, 
  consequences will never be the same !, 
  exactly what i did . 
  in conclusion , e.t. 
  is a videogame . 
  when i first read this , i thought it was gon na say that it was actually your numb arm . 
  i 've read that story on at least three times . 
  [ there you go . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/b0u31/reddit_i_have_proof_she_cheated_on_me_and_need_a/ ), 
  [ follow-up ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/b2ayj/i_caught_her_cheating_and_got_revenge_on/ ), 
  thank you , had fun there , mysterious admin guy who kept healing us and made me invisible . 
  `` what is my name ? '', 
  or anything i know the answer to . 
  best idea for a novelty account ever . 
  you can post whenever you want and you can be really creative . 
  and you `` get me every time '' . 
  fun ?!, 
  are you insane ? 
  but it was relevant here , so do n't hit me * too * hard . 
  i liked the tenacious d bit for the `` i win '' part . 
  use [ hotspot shield ] ( http://www.hotspotshield.com/ ) , i guess ... ? 
  i think that * everone * who knows both songs think that . 
  actually , when i got rick rolled for the first time , i thought `` why is that guy dancing to chrono trigger music ? 
  kirby/snoop dogg, 
  but they * did * do mario kart for some reason , even though there 's already the old super mario kart . 
  finally . 
  i 've wanted to know what the hell this meme is for ages !, 
  whenever i google search an cartoon/video game character , i find a fsjal version . 
  stop it . 
  i know what you were planning to start . 
  you ca n't even put your sunglasses on in peace anymore !, 
  `` they '' as in `` he/she '' . 
  madmikeyb did n't know the gender of the person he proposed to . 
  yeah , there was even that `` fuckable/unfuckable '' version of it . 
  [ i did it !, 
  i dragged the hurdle with me . 
  why is link so good at basketball ? 
  yes . 
  because he uses the hookshot . 
  they build walls that keep disappearing . 
  that 's basically what you do in tetris . 
  the guy is called `` alexey '' , who is the creator of tetris . 
  in this comic , it 's shown how he got the idea to make tetris . 
  ( it 's just a joke , that 's not actually how he got the idea . ), 
  maybe i would have felt a bit of sympathy too if they did n't type like that . 
  oh god , i remember that . 
  was n't it really long ? 
  i always miss one key .
