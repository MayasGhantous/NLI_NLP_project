  best exchange ever . 
  trouble in terrorist town , anyone ? 
  yeah , but still , what happened to the beardy titan though ? 
  when the good titan with the abs was killing the other titan at around 18 minutes , they showed two pictures for a split second between shots of the titan and mikasa . 
  [ this . 
  [ and this . 
  what 's the meaning of this ? 
  edit : to people saying the second one was survival instinct kicking in : yes , this was shown with heart beat sounds when the happy titan was walking towards her , but i 'm talking about two minutes later , when eren-titan stomped the shit out of happy titan . 
  they showed that picture again for a split second . 
  i really do n't understand your comment . 
  are you saying that people should stop theorizing and just look up what actually happens ? 
  [ here 's a good picture of the thing on the ground . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ljngcri.png ) you 're absolutely right , that must be it . 
  i still wonder what it means . 
  he dreamed about getting the key and he had the key after the dream , so his dad was probably there the night before he woke up . 
  ( i do n't know how much time passed between the scene on the boat and him waking up . ), 
  he probably means how you accused beartricks of having problems just because they do n't fit your expectations . 
  the after-credits scene . 
  [ it 's hilarious . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yag2mfwcpfc ), 
  it 's understandable that you came into this thread to read stuff about animes you 've already seen , but as soon as you saw the words `` gurren lagann '' , why did you keep reading ? 
  or * rewind * when you miss a good part watching a dvd . 
  i love when people do that . 
  guys , this guy obviously wants downvotes so we 'll have to neutralize his karma count !, 
  quick , upvote him !, 
  yeah , wow , good job defusing that bomb . 
  i did n't assume that at all , but thanks for telling me . 
  spoiler tags ? 
  it 's not like everyone has seen every movie . 
  just write `` sixth sense : '' and then the rest in spoiler tags . 
  and do n't say that there 's a statute of limitations on spoilers , because people who get spoiled do n't just think `` oh well , i guess it was n't ruined for me because it is an old movie anyway '' . 
  the effort of using spoiler tags is nothing compared to the fact that this guy had the movie ruined . 
  needless to say , many more people who did n't know yet could read the comment above . 
  well they did address that , so i 'm sure they 'll explain it . 
  what a fitting voice for jd from scrubs then . 
  yeah , it 's actually one of the good german anime dubs . 
  ( i enjoyed gurren lagann in german too . ), 
  but what the fuck did they do with haruhi ? 
  first time i watched haruhi i watched season 1 in german , and i thought `` well this anime is pretty nice , except for that stupid kyon character '' but when i saw the english dub , he became my favorite character . 
  [ this monologue . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbffmld9qfs ), 
  he talks like some rtl commentator . 
  also while looking for that video , i found [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=biq3pe40hdc#t=79s ) . 
  the perp ... is probably in inaba !, 
  yes . 
  what the * fuck * !, 
  i gave clannad a 7 and after story a 5 . 
  after story had an original premise and some really good emotional sense , but the ending , and i really mean the last 10 minutes , ruined the whole series for me . 
  i still have n't met one person who was able to explain to me why this ending was n't badly executed . 
  to anyone who does n't know about this : ghost stories was an anime about kids and ghosts that was full of clich\u00e9s and was n't really popular in japan , so the creators told the english dub team to do what they want , as long as they keep the names . 
  the product is [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/vujcrbw0jkw ) . 
  it 's amazing . 
  i watched the whole thing . 
  makes more sense than `` i 'm also the only one who 's ever laughed at it '' . 
  * knock knock !, 
  * who 's there ? 
  * adolf ? 
  * adolf who ? 
  * adolf hitler . 
  i 've only read this joke once on reddit and i could n't stop laughing . 
  what the fuck !? 
  i do n't get this at all but i am laughing so hard !, 
  you totally did n't get that funny , original joke he just made . 
  i 'm gon na be original here and say `` because it 's with hand people ? 
  he 's living alone . 
  if he closed more doors than he opened , that must mean that someone else opened the doors . 
  there is a big difference , but nobody said anything about a hole . 
  this person most likely does not have good intentions . 
  also , people are generally scared of the unknown . 
  dude , if someone shoots you in the chest and you 're wearing a vest , you still got shot in the chest . 
  there is no hole , we know that , ksa3 was saying that , technically , you will still get shot in chest even if it does n't do any damage . 
  yes , and you did n't get scared , so what are you confused about ? 
  the people who think it 's scary get scared . 
  but if you get a text ... you 'd know who it is , right ? 
  what exactly do you mean by `` not real '' ? 
  it does n't happen in the game , if you are talking about that . 
  you do know that he wo n't see the spoiler tag in his inbox , right ? 
  finally something new on reddit . 
  i keep reading the same jokes and the same puns and chain threads and it makes me wonder if there 's any creativity left in this world , but this comment right here showed me that commentors on reddit can still be original . 
  thank you , good sir . 
  i wish i had the money to give you even more gold , but i have but one upboat to give to you . 
  ( this was sarcasm . 
  not that i 'm complaining about a guy entertaining us by sharing a relevant collegehumor video script , but he 's actually getting praise and gold for copypasting . ), 
  `` king moron '' is one of the convenient translations of the japanese pun ( whatever it is ) ever . 
  okay , i 'd never would 've gotten that . 
  from the news in austria : http://youtu.be/3slqwz1pfdw, 
  how does he remind you of l at all ? 
  well they needed some insulting nickname for kinshiro morooka , and the words king and moron were perfect for it . 
  wow , and i thought the * first * line of your comment made no sense . 
  that 's cheating !, 
  you change the line under faggot to whatever you are responding to . 
  he wrote great short stories . 
  you think they 're going to reach the basement in this season ? 
  now my question is : are the games also set in the future in the japanese version of the game ? 
  i 'm assuming you 're from a german speaking country ? 
  this actually work in an episode of monk . 
  is that the guy from sherlock ? 
  the baskerville episode ? 
  oh god , i wondered why that seemed familiar . 
  ^ ^ ^ ps : ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ spelled ^ ^ ^ schneizel .
