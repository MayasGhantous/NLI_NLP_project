  to be honest though , i did n't really understand what malex was saying either . 
  english is n't my first language , but i have n't seen a sentence structured like that before . 
  i read it as one sentence : `` it seemed to shocked , to uncomfortable , to aroused '' , not as two . 
  `` shocked , to uncomfortable ... to aroused '' did n't have a verb in it and no from , which confused me . 
  i know it 's technically correct , but i can see why theboy made that mistake . 
  they edited the episode because they were too lazy to not edit ? 
  what 's the point of a spoiler tag if i do n't know what gets spoiled ? 
  i read mary as `` marty '' and thought this was a back to the future joke . 
  it kinda makes sense . 
  by `` what gets spoiled '' i mean `` what game gets spoiled '' . 
  this is a god of war spoiler . 
  how should anyone have guessed that ? 
  i like you . 
  okay , who actually read that the way it was spelled ? 
  just according to keikaku . 
  he actually screamed `` allah !, 
  that anime has a twist ? 
  are you joking right now or does it actually have a twist ? 
  if so , when does it happen in the anime ? 
  there is actually a [ car brand named bryan cranston ] ( http://i.imgur.com/x2x4syt.png ) in real life !, 
  but will you ever find yourself ? 
  that 's exactly what my sr : the third character looks like . 
  it was even funnier when i met the mayor in that game . 
  persona 4 : the animation . 
  arin has n't departed and his bar ended too . 
  you can make anything sound stupid if you write it in all caps like that and add a line that was in no way implied or said by anyone ever . 
  are you playing on the psp ? 
  if so , can you somehow play the game on the original psp without actually having the game and just using an . iso you got on the internet ? 
  okay , so am i the only one who noticed the re-used scenes and cutaways to shots that did n't fit in at all ? 
  there were even some still shots and slow-mo for no reason ? 
  what 's up with that ? 
  ( watched gg 's release . ), 
  this is hypnotizing . 
  ** i came close to passing out from the paaaain **, 
  he figured out that he actually ate a human back when he was stranded ? 
  i wo n't fall for that again . 
  i never got why people would just stop watching steins ; gate like 6 episodes in . 
  i mean , they have a freaking time machine !, 
  you * know * something 's gon na go down . 
  that 's the origin of his name , though . 
  this comment is extremely funny to me and i do n't know why . 
  i was afraid to read the comment above because i do n't know what gets spoiled and i 'm playing the game right now , but is it that reveal from chapter 2 ? 
  how does someone `` look like '' a trap ? 
  both . 
  clannad : after story . 
  i do n't regret watching it , but it 's still the one i * most * regret watching - of the animes i watched all the way through . 
  i really hated that ending . 
  it seemed like such a cop-out to me . 
  i even liked after story , especially the father arc , but i just really did n't like those last 10 minutes . 
  clannad : after story [ ] ( / s `` was built around interconnected dimensions ? 
  it was built around it ? 
  you 're making it sound like the premise of the show is time travel or whatever happened there . 
  imagine if the first episode of k-on had a duck walking into a gun store and the last episode of the second season ended with a duck killing everyone in the school . 
  you ca n't really say it was built around that . 
  you ca n't have a time travel ending when the story is n't about time travel . '' ), 
  ah , so this is old boy : brotherhood , then . 
  there 's a fan translation patch called project zetsubou . 
  i played the whole game and loved it !, 
  they actually did n't explain what 's gon na happen after someone gets killed in the game either , at least not at this point . 
  they only said that you have to get away with the killing . 
  what about togami ? 
  the misunderstood guy is satan who has to flee to our world . 
  did someone say [ fsteak ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqyembvwo71ql3ji1o1_500.jpg ) ? 
  i thought it was in new super mario bros. . wii and they were in a castle . 
  i have n't seen the episode yet and only played this part in the game , but [ ] ( / s `` was i the only one who figured everything out by just looking at the crime scene ? 
  like ... who would even think those are numbers ? 
  ( apart from japanese people , of course . ) '' ), 
  dude , spoilers . 
  i used spoiler tags too . 
  same for me . 
  how it actually happened is much more surprising and interesting in this case . 
  kirigiri is the super duper high school esper . 
  unlike maizono , she can actually read minds . 
  also , i 'd say that the second case is n't a `` fair '' mystery , since [ ] ( / s `` you ca n't really figure out who it was before the trial . '' ), 
  did n't they show everything that needed to be shown in the investigation , though ? 
  why not just using spoiler tags for vn stuff ? 
  they would n't have anything to gain from that , would they ? 
  that was my first thought too , though . 
  if they do n't figure out it was suicide ( i.e. , vote for someone who 's not the victim ) everyone dies . 
  after having seen the episode , i just wonder ... will they be able to show each of the [ amount of episodes ] ( / s `` 6 '' ) chapters and do it justice ? 
  i mean , they could make it in 13 episodes , but i wonder if it 'll be good . 
  the first episode is the prologue , and from then on just [ amount of episodes ] ( / s `` 2 episodes per case ? 
  one investigation episode and one trial episode . '' ), 
  maybe they could skip a case ? 
  this would be weird since they 'd have to either kill people off off-screen or not have them die at all . 
  they ca n't skip the last three chapters , though . 
  i guess you could use the [ second post of the lp on something awful . 
  ] ( http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3447397 ), 
  i played the game the whole way through , do n't worry . 
  i was ... obviously kidding , i hope . 
  this game does n't have supernatural stuff . 
  no , everyone but the killer gets executed . 
  meaning that naegi would get executed too . 
  it 's a joke . 
  do n't worry . 
  what do you mean with duo-survival ? 
  like , two people survive ? 
  yup , either one person survives or they somehow beat the system . 
  it 's not like the school has always been like that . 
  did you get exposed to vn stuff that was n't in spoiler tags ?
