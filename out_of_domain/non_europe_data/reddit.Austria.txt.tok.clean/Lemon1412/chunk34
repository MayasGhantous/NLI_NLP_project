  * least favorite anime : ** clannad after story ** . 
  i 'm not saying it 's bad , i just liked it the least , out of all the animes i watched to the end . 
  i watched the first episodes of k-on and lucky star and i liked that even less ( it just was n't my taste ) , but i did n't finish those series . 
  i just ... really did n't like the ending of after story . 
  the last ten minutes or so ruined it for me . 
  * everyone should watch : probably ** death note ** ? 
  this is the one that got most people into anime and it 's a very good show . 
  * rewatch the most : ** code geass ** and ** welcome to the nhk ** . 
  code geass is just fun to watch and welcome to the nhk is just one of those animes you watch every summer . 
  i loved the atmosphere . 
  * deserves another season : ** hyouka ** , please . 
  i watched this last summer as it was airing ( it 's the first anime i watched while it was airing ) and i absolutely adored it . 
  i 'm really sad it 's over . 
  * best op : i just ca n't decide . 
  i 've seen so many great ops . 
  the first op of fma : b was great , durararara 's openings were awesome , there 's also the obligatory cowboy bebop . 
  i 'm just going to mention ** gankutsuou ** because not enough people talk about how great that opening song is . 
  * best ed : now this one 's easier , since i do n't know that many eds i like a lot . 
  this one probably goes to ** welcome to the nhk ** , the first one . 
  another really good one that is also very recent is danganronpa 's ed . 
  gets me pumped up every time , even though the image at the end is fairly depressing , especially if you 've finished the game . 
  the thing that they did at the end of chapter 4 . 
  the fact that this person tried to kill [ ] ( / s `` everyone '' ) . 
  i did n't like the justification either . 
  just because of that piece of paper ? 
  naegi and kirigiri did n't even do anything wrong . 
  the only way to be able to avoid that spoiler is to have already watched the movie that is in the spoiler tag ... but how do you know you have watched it already if you do n't even know what movie you 're talking about , since it 's in a spoiler tag ? 
  you 'd have to know every single movie that has this in it . 
  why do you think so ? 
  i know , right ?!, 
  get back to work !, 
  perfect execution . 
  how the fuck did i not notice that ? 
  thanks . 
  what is this a spoiler to ? 
  not something from danganronpa 2 , is it ? 
  let 's play . 
  the let 's play of danganronpa on something awful that made the game popular in the west . 
  he did n't get any worse , right ? 
  i just stopped watching him too ... he 's a great guy . 
  dude , look at that scene again , when she caught him . 
  he 's signalling her by winking !, 
  my god , stop saying this every time someone complains using big words . 
  yeah , i got the impression that it was some sort of finishing move , but when i learned to play koi koi , i found out it was quite the opposite !, 
  what about the games and movies that some people have n't heard about until lately ? 
  what about older movies that were made before they were born ? 
  i do n't understand the logic behind spoiling old stuff . 
  wait , what ? 
  when you koi koi , your points do n't double , do they ? 
  the opponents points double if he wins a combination before you do after you koi koi 'd , right ? 
  the fuck is wuenche, 
  i 've never played it like this . 
  source ? 
  i think spike chunsoft somehow became my favorite whatever of games . 
  they were involved in zero escape too , right ? 
  i love danganronpa as well . 
  in virtue 's last reward , there 's more puzzle room , and there is no way you will do the same puzzle room twice , except if you want to replay it for some reason . 
  there is also a flowchart system so you wo n't see the same scene twice . 
  i fucking loved that game . 
  quick warning , though : the ending is a sequel hook . 
  ladies and gentlemen , * please * !, 
  it 's the second floor . 
  we already know there 's a pool . 
  okay , you got ta give me a better reason here . 
  i never wear glasses , nor do i need to , but what insults you about people wanting to look good by wearing glasses ? 
  if it looks good ? 
  he 's always like this . 
  * what * if it looks good ? 
  * what 's the problem with wearing glasses * if it looks good ? 
  rivaille sounds like levi , but it is n't spelled riv ** ia ** lle . 
  reiner is getting more and more likely to be the armored titan , character development , a new setting , a great ending . 
  i do n't need more . 
  the only episodes that were `` slow '' to me were the cannonball episodes . 
  if you have n't finished danganronpa 1 , do n't read on :, 
  [ small danganronpa spoiler ] ( / s `` and somehow he still ends up in the morgue . '' ), 
  episode 16 : reiner and the black haired guy are shown in the crowd when erwin mentions eren 's basement . 
  intro : when all the important characters are shown in the beginning , the transition between reiner and the same black haired guy is different . 
  episode 17 : reiner takes off his hood when charging towards female titan , gets caught by her , * winks and cocks his head in the same direction * , somehow does n't die when getting squished , smoke is coming from his head when he 's carrying armin , the female titan suddenly changes directions and knows exactly where to find eren . 
  i 'm gon na say he 's * a * titan here . 
  probably armored because of the hair . 
  he got a lot of screentime in episode 4 after eren says `` mankind 's counterattack begins now '' . 
  it 's just short for krankenschwester . 
  a sister for ill people !, 
  and that one version they sang in that mr. bean episode . 
   i was trying to remember this song while watching breaking bad last night, 
  oh shit , i knew i forgot something !, 
  source code . 
  why do i need to prove that i 'm the better driver anyeay ? 
  i need to show i do n't need him so i can hire him ? 
  you better hate yourself , not even correcting the way he spelled his name . 
  say his name . 
   if its saying anything it 's that the breakfast is getting less and less healthy . 
  holy shit , skyler caused the cancer !, 
  and then he read the rules . 
  as a british man , i was very confused about your use of `` fannies '' . 
  i lied . 
  i 'm not even british . 
  i made it up just to make this joke . 
  it is n't even a joke . 
  so first of all , that is just plain wrong and narrow-minded .
