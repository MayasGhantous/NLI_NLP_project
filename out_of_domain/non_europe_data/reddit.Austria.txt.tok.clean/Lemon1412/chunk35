  even the smartest can/want to just go on the internet and say random shit that will get downvoted . 
  they get off on making people mad ? 
  do you think that they wo n't just look at their replies and see all the `` oh got ta keep it at zero guys , do n't give him what he wants '' comments ? 
  it 's not like he cares about the amount of downvotes itself . 
  why do people like you exist ? 
  why ca n't you just not care ? 
  how is it sad ? 
  `` never ending soda '' ? 
  was that a homestar runner reference ? 
  this is n't the goron race though . 
  you most likely do n't even have the goron mask at this point . 
  those are my two favorites because it shows how original the game is . 
  both of them take place in an enclosed area and you do n't even travel ( or barely fight wild enemies ) . 
  god , i fucking love that game . 
  and the first one . 
  and super paper mario . 
  ( shout-out to spm for having an awesome villain . ), 
  you must be * luigi * !, 
  nope , but i heard it is n't that good . 
  you saying he likes dudes ? 
  well this was n't dumb luck . 
  he figured out his own way to beat the segment . 
  * die adults, 
  out . '', 
  naegi : `` one of the lights is n't on ... '', 
  well maybe it 's because one of them contains * pancakes * !, 
  yes . 
  not really . 
  if you find it boring , you find it boring . 
  it 's the color of spike 's clothes . 
  is it * that * bloodline ? 
  what did he say ? 
  ( i played the first game . ), 
  i thought the story and gameplay in vlr was better , but the characters in 999 were better . 
  there 's not even a general opinion about which game is better , it 's like 50/50 and nobody really cares . 
  love it . 
  `` what exactly does this piece of evidence prove ? '', 
  '' ... nothing , right ? '', 
  * penalty *, 
  yes . 
  look up `` project zetsubou '' . 
  i did n't say that every 999 character was better than every vlr character . 
  you ca n't compare phi or luna from vlr to musashidou or nagisa from 999 . 
  it 's a bit unfair . 
  i just wanted to piss you off before i kill you . 
  for me it was more of a `` oh , i bet this is the spot from the first episode '' , just because it would be nice narratively . 
  yeah , it was amanojaku . 
  he has very recognizable eyes . 
  she was my least favorite character . 
  yes , but that does n't exist in real life . 
  i looked at jamieson price 's page and did n't see gankutsuou on the list , which i found weird since i was sure he voiced the count of monte christo . 
  so i went on my own list to go to the gankutsuou page in order to find out who `` actually voiced him '' . 
  then i found this . 
  googling ssjmaster vs. xinil gets you forum posts from the last hour . 
  it was a breaking bad reference . 
  suck my, 
  fuc, 
  you want me to tell you ? 
  in the game , the door did n't have a lock , but in the anime , it * was * locked , but i guess you ca n't say he broke down the door ? 
  and then she vomited blood and kept smiling ? 
  yup , if you choose to tell her , naegi says that he ca n't tell her because he still is n't sure yet and it would cause an uproar . 
  another great `` illusion of choice '' moment in the game is at the climax of the last chapter when [ ] ( / s `` you have to guess what happened to the togami group . '' ), 
  [ and here 's the tvtrope page for this trope . 
  ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/butthoumust ), 
  he has pressed y so often before this episode . 
  really ? 
  that 's pretty stupid in my opinion . 
  if you say that a map has a forest , you can also say it has trees . 
  he broke the window , reached inside and turned around the lock , then opened the door . 
  you just need to say the third-to-last sentence in the game . 
  he 's normal . 
  and every riddle thread before that . 
  and yet yesterday 's guy got gold . 
  what the fuck ? 
  i 've never heard about this . 
  where are you from ? 
  yeah , but it makes no sense to say that you 're calling yourself a sausage when you say `` ich bin ein frankfurter '' . 
  the whole term is `` frankfurter w\u00fcrstchen '' , because it 's a sausage from frankfurt . 
  just because someone is from frankfurt and the sausage is from frankfurt does n't mean that that someone is a sausage . 
  do n't just assume he did n't get it . 
  there 's a ds game called 9 hours , 9 persons , 9 doors in which they talk about exactly that . 
  morgan robertson telepathically spoke to his past self and told him to write the book . 
  edit : okay , [ i found the scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=y_bxcd1sqmi#t=482 ) , but i remembered wrong . 
  morgan robertson is n't an esper . 
  william thomas stead is . 
  of course !, 
  you ca n't watch it on the subreddit page ? 
  is that just a res thing ? 
  right ? 
  every time i see someone asking `` why did he steal ricin if he did n't use it '' , i wonder if those are newcomers who did n't watch seasons 1-4 for some reason . 
  there 's `` a chance '' of different angles ? 
  what are the chances of even one of the photos looking exactly like one of the photos op posted ? 
  [ til that baron danglars watches gamegrumps . 
  i did n't get it either and i kept thinking `` what else can ` how many people are dead in there ' mean ? '' . 
  the answer is * nothing * . 
  why would you even say `` how many people are dead in there ? '', 
  if you mean `` how many dead people are in there ? 
  what does your comment accomplish ? 
  for people who have read it , you have added nothing to the discussion apart from the fact that you 've read it too . 
  for the people who have n't read it , you just spoiled the punchline .
