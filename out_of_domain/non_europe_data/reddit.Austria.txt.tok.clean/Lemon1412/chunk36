  they do n't get healed in pok\u00e9 centers . 
  they get replaced . 
  i am just one guy . 
  i did n't see the other comment . 
  reddit consists of multiple people . 
  well i meant to sound snarky and i do n't regret it . 
  bravo !, 
  what the hell ? 
  from [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npp3nl6jmiq ) video , it seems like he * died * there ? 
  [ look at this portrayal of english people . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmeqbnqouw4 ), 
  pipsqueak !, 
  that was a good read !, 
  i have n't watched the episode yet , but wow . 
  this is where the game gets really good , and apparently the anime gets worse . 
  what i wrote was n't a troll comment . 
  i did n't try to enrage anyone . 
  no no , they say that you * ca n't * use euros in england . 
  i 've never heard of that and if death note has one of the worst dubs ever , then pretty much every dub is excellent . 
  he was a bit mean to watson in the solitary cyclist . 
  what ? 
  nope , wait , hold on , i still got a problem with you . 
  what about naegi ? 
  did you see that shower scene a few episodes ago !, 
  having watched the episode now , i got ta say , it was better than i expected . 
  all that chess piece/scale thing was missing , sure , but it was still a good episode . 
  i know , it could have been so much better . 
  all of those problems would have been averted if this had 24 episodes , but let 's just hope that this anime is a way of making the game more popular in the west ( even more popular than orenronen 's lp on sa did ) and bringing it and the sequel over to the west . 
  i would gladly buy a ps vita for danganronpa 1 and 2 . 
  ( i played the fan translation of the first one . ), 
  i 'd also buy persona 4 golden !, 
  dude !, 
  spoilers !, 
  ( sorta . ), 
  [ ] ( / s `` i do n't think she 'd commit suicide . 
  she probably just died of some illness . '' ), 
  my brother ordered those for me back in may , as a birthday present for me . 
  he never received them . 
  armin !, 
  tight tight tight, 
  thank you so much . 
  i still rant about that ending to my friends sometimes . 
  it just feels so stupid too me . 
  it may make sense in a visual novel , but `` suddenly : time travel '' is n't a good way to end a tragic story . 
  funny that you mention that . 
  angel beats and clannad have the lowest ratings on my animelist . 
  ( i guess i 've never finished watching a bad anime . ), 
  i actually liked the ending of angel beats ! , though . 
  you 're horrible . 
  all of you . 
  this is n't '' / r/omfgthisisdisgustingandunethicalineverypossibleway '' , it 's `` r/wtf '' . 
  i actually whispered `` what the fuck ... ? '', 
  when i saw the picture before seeing what subreddit it was in . 
  as soon as i saw it was in r/wtf , i knew there would be people complaining . 
  it 's completely understandable that this picture would make you say `` what the fuck '' . 
  i do n't see a rule against photoshop art . 
  it says `` all things that make you say wtf '' in big letters . 
  this makes people say wtf . 
  yup , and right next to him was ... ** the pipe ** . 
  i had the feeling he even tried to get to it with yoshi at the end of this episode . 
  in what way is it common sense ? 
  drawing really freaky stuff and just paintings that look like they were painted by a madman that make you go `` wtf '' do n't belong here ? 
  why not ? 
  there is no common sense here . 
  you are assuming this does n't belong here and i am assuming it does . 
  yes , saying `` what the fuck '' to real life stuff and saying `` what the fuck '' to freaky visuals that represent real life stuff fall under the same category , namely the `` wtf '' category . 
  it 's like only being allowed to post apples in / r/fruit , but not allowed to post oranges . 
  whatever you say . 
  still belongs here then . 
  even if those worthless 14-year-olds react to it that way . 
  uuh , i think there are some gigantic spoilers in the thumbnails of the related videos . 
  then how does not going to his aunt 's lead to not seeing the person he had sex with ever again ? 
  how is that bad ? 
  if you 're from germany or austria there 's a good chance that your ancestors were nazis . 
  why ? 
  this is a joke . 
  are you the guy from the bar blob_cat was talking about ? 
  it takes place on the largest moon of saturn . 
  did n't joshjepson and attackingtucans play the exact same word game in their super mario sunshine lp ? 
  i ca n't find the episode , though . 
  this is some scott tenorman shit right there . 
  how dare he !, 
  terminal march !, 
  i still do n't get it . 
  did you just make that ? 
  this is amazing !, 
  keep it up !, 
  a bear that wants to make kids despair ? 
  those stupid references on reddit sure spoiled me to some degree . 
  [ everyone kept saying `` would you kindly '' on reddit before i ever played bioshock and so when i started playing the game , i immediately noticed that the letter at the beginning has the words `` would you kindly '' on it . 
  two minutes later , atlas says it . 
  i then knew that atlas was the reason i came to rapture . 
  thanks , reddit !, 
  very subtle !, 
  i did n't know much more than that , so the actual scene still surprised me . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  he did n't complain about being spoiled . 
  he complained about the / r/politics guy spoiling a twist to another / r/politics guy . 
  yup . 
  we * saw * her getting killed .
