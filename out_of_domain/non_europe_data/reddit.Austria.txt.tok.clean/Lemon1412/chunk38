  it was either gus who poisoned brock or walt . 
  huell lifting the cigarette out of jesse 's pocket was n't obvious . 
  nothing else hinted at walt being the one . 
  brock was n't poisoned before episode 12 , so there could n't have been predictions . 
  ( but i guess you know that anyway . ), 
  the things you just listed were all hints , but i guess it was more obvious to you than to other people . 
  i interpreted the gun spinning not as `` the gun pointed at the plant '' , but as `` the gun pointed away from him for once '' when i first watched it . 
  and `` you can see the cigarette pack in his hand '' ? 
  i just rewatched the scene and could n't really see it !, 
  to be fair , most people just watched it live on tv and could n't rewatch it ( or could they ? 
  but i know what you mean . 
  you ca n't really call it predictions if hints that it 's true already exist . 
   it was given to us by the writers anyone who did n't make the connection was not paying attention . 
  the problem with this is that i will never find out if i would have figured it out on my own . 
  before i really thought about the episode , i started reading reddit discussions . 
  ricin kills very slowly . 
  why would you reply to a comment that 's two months old ? 
  that conversation was hilarious . 
  that is your opinion . 
  yeah , that was some weird-ass deduction . 
  not only does he beat bosses and go around obstacles in the weirdest ways , he even solves puzzles in the weirdest fucking ways by thinking differently . 
  where 's the vacuum !? 
  wait ... yoshi ... * is * the vaccum ! '', 
  and this , kids , is what we will forever call : the pineapple incident . 
  a joke about huell still sitting in that room ?

  ( also , booker dewitt . ), 
  how did they ruin junko ? 
  you 've never even * seen * junko before the ending . 
  what you saw was mukuro , and they did n't ruin her because she actually died there . 
  this is amazing !, 
  definitely one of my favorite op crossover videos . 
  though this video had the worst spelling of j\u00e4ger that i 've ever seen . 
  i understand that you 'd put a y instead of the j so people wo n't be confused about the spelling . 
  okay . 
  and you do n't have to use an umlaut if you do n't have one on your keyboard . 
  whatever . 
  but replacing the \u00e4 with `` ea '' ? 
  that 's just wrong in every way !, 
  i was thinking bastion . 
  why did you remove the rules ? 
  destroying cities/planets does n't count , and the person has to kill them directly . 
  ( so not even with the death note , i guess . ), 
  he then travels back in time . 
  when he sees his younger self with tuco in the desert , he betrays his younger self hoping that none of the things that happened will happen in the new timeline . 
  after watching a tv show or a movie or after playing a ( story-heavy ) video game , i always read the tv tropes article . 
  i 'm already looking forward to reading the breaking bad article next week !, 
  i bet huell is still sitting in that room lol, 
  i watched akira with some friends 2 weeks ago . 
  i thought it would be about motorcycles !, 
  what happened ? 
  dae gta logic hot dog heals bullet wounds ? 
  holy shit . 
  why do n't they just fly the eagles inside the walls, 
  holy shit !, 
  you 're majusarts !, 
  the monkey island and phoenix wright flash video guy . 
  and star trek strom sparen guy . 
  and guy who made me use the phrase `` einsame sahne '' on a regular basis !, 
  i could n't stop laughing when i saw the `` old blue skinned kids '' , but as it neared the end , i just accepted everything i saw and sort of even understood what was happening . 
  did n't they talk about il piantissimo 's face being the postman from majora 's mask/runner from ocarina of time as well ? 
  i love the small things that triggered big things in the series . 
  like if walt jr. had turned off the tv like he was supposed to before having dinner in the penultimate episode of season 3 , walter would n't have seen the news about tom\u00e1s . 
  i think jesse would be dead too , though . 
  or if jesse had n't lit up a joint in saul 's office , huell would n't have had to steal the pot from him , etc. 
  i think it was `` efficient '' , not professional . 
  i remember now . 
  i saw the il piantissimo thing on did you know gaming . 
  and the guy who was speaking was egoraptor . 
  how does lithium relate to meth ? 
  i do n't really like the `` you can spoil things to people who have n't seen it because it 's old '' rule . 
  preferrably , yes . 
  using spoiler tags is n't a lot of work . 
  i am 18 . 
  not knowing what happens in scarface is n't my fault . 
  does this look like a fruit salad to you ? 
  in the austrian radio news , they just said that it was finally over , and that they would n't spoil it . 
  they even warned people the internet is full of spoilers . 
  solve the riddle of the sphinx !, 
  i think you misinterpreted what he was going for with his original question . 
  he legitimately did n't know . 
  he 's not saying it 's an inferior way of writing an episode . 
  that punchline !, 
  kinda reminded me of the punchline in [ mr. literal ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji4ojgz5qo4 ) . 
  you might as well blame walt 's parents . 
  was n't walt calling the nazis on jesse an even more recent turning point ? 
  why is n't the jack jack ? 
  i do n't even get this spelling . 
  it is ? 
  so his name is n't the german name for hunter ? 
  even though they sing it in the intro and it 's a common theme in the anime ? 
  i thought `` well maybe he 's french ? 
  that 's understandable , but you ca n't replace \u00e4 with ea . 
  it 's ae . 
  in the german language , ae is a valid replacement for \u00e4 in case you ca n't use umlauts for some reason . 
  crossword puzzles , for example . 
  how is that better ? 
  they did ? 
  can you elaborate ? 
  i only see a vase .
