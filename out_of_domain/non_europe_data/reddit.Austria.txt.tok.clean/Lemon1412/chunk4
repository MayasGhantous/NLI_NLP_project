  always . 
  i 'm getting the same error . 
  help ? 
  i heard strong bad . 
  i laughed at this comment more than i laughed at the story . 
  it 's `` over 8000 '' in every version but the english version . 
  i think . 
  i had to make a facebook account thinking you actually linked to something funny that you ca n't read without an account . 
  then i found out it was that stupid old trick . 
  now i have a facebook account and i have nothing funny to read . 
  [ here 's my score . 
  the best thing about this is the atmosphere when you lose your headphones . 
  did he ask something ? 
  since the day youtube got a new rating system and you can actually see how many people dislike a video , commenters make remarks about it like `` 128 people missed the like button '' or `` 42 people are justin bieber fans who got lost '' . 
  * i think * that 's what he meant . 
  just like that cherry kool aid comic that keeps getting reposted . 
  that like-like 's eaten my shield !, 
   touche `, 
  you 're just trolling us perfectionists , are n't you ? 
  i still do that . 
   man the ** troll 's ** at gamefaq 's are huge douches . 
  * sigh *, 
  there 's no reason for you to put an apos -, 
  oooh . 
  ooooooh !, 
  i see what you did there . 
  wow , how would she react if we left a comment saying `` y are u an obama fan ?? 
  all he did was mess up the country '' . 
  hey , flint , come by and pick up that drago fang that i pulled out of your dead wife 's heart . 
  perfect logic !, 
  there was a portal reference ? 
  explain please . 
  did glados call chell a monster after she killed a duck ? 
  actually , sing frog 's theme to the syllables . 
  it fits much better than the main theme . 
  it has to many `` dah `` s to be the main theme . 
  i do n't trust people who say `` hehe '' at the end of sentences . 
  did they even try to attack you ? 
  but he said * to * my brother and i , not just `` my brother and i '' . 
  do you usually say `` to me '' or `` to i '' ? 
  do n't trust him , guys !, 
  : ** oh ** shit ** here ** come ** san ** s. 
  she was being sarcastic with the `` very funny '' . 
  why would n't they ? 
  there have been a lot of great updates recently . 
  i 've never seen anyone use an apostrophe like that . 
  the beak on that first picture looked like a duck . 
  * naaa naa naa naa naa *, 
  well , he used the a -, 
  you bastard . 
  i press tab and go to the team with less wins . 
  who downvoted him ? 
  i did n't get it either because i 've never heard of starburst before . 
  no one lives forever . 
  what makes nolf special is that it 's a lot of fun to just mess around . 
  you run in and shoot someone with your ak-47 ? 
  that 's boring . 
  how about putting him to sleep and stealing his weapon , and then carrying him over to the place you have to bomb ? 
  * that 's * cool . 
  did n't work for me . 
  mirror please ? 
  `` 875 people who looked at the picture are justin bieber fans . '', 
  need a dispenser here . 
  `` now get back to work '' , correct ? 
  ooh , a self-whoosh . 
  never seen * that * before . 
  this is a topic about `` noob moments '' . 
  kenny_tf2 quoted a noob . 
  fffuuuuu basically said the exact same thing as the noob after reading the comment ; he must know that what he said is stupid , meaning that he was joking . 
  short answer : the same way everyone here was able to tell . 
  thanks !, 
  [ is this some kind of joke i do n't get ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/d86b3/reddit_whats_the_best_picture_youve_ever_taken/c0yanbd ), 
  that 's a problem to you ? 
  i once took out an entire sentry nest on a mario_kart server ( no goal , just killing ) and then i built my own sentry there . 
  i also built a teleporter exit next to my sentry and the entrance in the spawn . 
  ( if anyone 's ever played on that map , i built the exit and the sentry in that blue room where you can change the music . ), 
  it 's cool when more engineers build a sentry in the same room after they used my teleporter to even get there , but one guy built his entrance next to my entrance , and then he used * my teleporter * to build an exit next to mine !, 
  why the hell would you do that ?!, 
  nobody needs two teleporters that lead * from * the same spot * to * the same spot . 
  i told him to build his exit next to my entrance and vice versa , but he did n't react . 
  and when you try to kill madame aroma , he says `` let 's not bring my wife into this ... '' . 
  huh ? 
  it was one of the most useful masks !, 
  especially in the pirate fortress . 
  you still have to fight those gerudo sword fighters , and they even say `` that mask wo n't fool me ! '' . 
  also , i liked to wear it when i did the kafei sidequest . 
  instead of hiding behind the rocks to wait for sakon , i ran around him like crazy . 
  [ i got a picture just like that . 
  thanks !, 
  ca n't you upload the video for us ? 
  seth ? 
  who just walks right into an occupied toilet and does a little dance, 
  who makes up rules for hide and seek and uses a ninja invisibility crouch, 
  is it [ this ] ( http://www.explosm.net/comics/2162/ ) very comic strip ? 
  when i first watched it , i thought that episode 25 was the last episode of the entire * show * . 
  man , that would have been a disappointing ending . 
  yeah , because you 're just watching that guy getting fucked . 
  we never do . 
  holy cow , upper right corner when he wakes up in the forest .
