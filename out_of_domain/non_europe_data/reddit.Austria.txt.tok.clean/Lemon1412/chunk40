  the attention to detail in this comic is amazing !, 
  wow . 
  subtle . 
  i seriously have no idea which one 's the `` odd one '' . 
  venice ? 
  remember that reddit post where a guy photoshopped a picture so it would look like he was making out with himself , and then was surprised that it looked sorta gay ? 
  i love how angry the people in the comments are because they have to pay for a game they 've wanted to play for months . 
  `` oh no , now i have a to buy that stupid vita , which is stupid because it has no good games , to play that good game . '', 
  where does that come from ? 
  yeah , old obscure reddit references are making me have a pregnant . 
  which sounds just like `` must have gone '' . 
  hey dandy , why is it named `` xbox 360 '' ? 
  i 'm proud of myself for getting that joke !, 
  actually , saying koi koi means you * refuse * to win right now so you have a chance to win even more . 
  is this our chance ? 
  what does that accomplish ? 
  it 's the first comment in literally every thread with this riddle . 
  i even wrote this comment last time . 
  ew , what, 
  it 's in the preview of the episode she shows up in . 
  so ... the end of episode 10 or something . 
  how is that a good glitch ? 
  you gain no milk from it and you know that you did n't even deserve the achievement . 
  mine 's called `` virtue 's last reward '' and i keep forgetting what the name of the actual weapon is . 
  actually , it has been confirmed to be greg ayres . 
  ( sunohara from clannad , yamazaki from welcome to the nhk ) .

  this is one of those animes where the german dub has potential to be fucking awesome . 
  ( and i bet there will be one . ), 
   mice are famous for their ability to multiply at breakneck speeds . 
  the type of mouse hwe have here gives birth once a month , birthing 12 babies each time . 
  baby mice mature and can give birth two months after they are born . 
  you picked up one of these darling baby mice at the pet shop and brought it home the day after it as born . 
  in 10 months from now , how many mice will you have ? 
  what the fuck , layton ? 
  so in two months , i will have 13 , i guess . 
  and in 4 i 'll have like what , 156 or something ? 
  uuuh ... 
   hint 1 : you may be thinking there 's going to be a lot of bothersome calculation involved in solving this puzzle , but you do n't need to do anything complicated to find the answer . 
  read the problem over carefully . 
  well i would n't say it 's * complicated * , but it 's just a really fucking high number . 
  i do have a calculator !, 
   hint 2 : do you remember how many mice you started with ? 
  have you considered how many mice you can expect , given that number ? 
  you fucker basically told me to read the puzzle * again * , and then you asked the question again . 
   hint 3 : ok , let me spell it out for you . 
  you need your mouse to become pregnant before it will give birth . 
  what does the mouse need in order to become pregnant ? 
  ** i am a fucking idiot . 
  well excuse me for not being some sort of mouse sex scientist . 
  they dubbed danganronpa ( the game ) , if that counts as dubbing . 
  it * is * called heimlich . 
  because it 's unexpected and that 's what makes it funny to most people . 
  it 's pretty pointless to put up a spoiler if you do n't know what it spoils in the first place . 
  but you also ca n't write what it spoils because that 's a spoiler too . 
  so someone who does n't want to get spoiled has to have watched everything !, 
  man , it 's freaking easy to do a phoenix wright cosplay !, 
  arnold schwarzenegger is austrian and gregory talked like arnold schwarzenegger .

  how can you not have met any african american people yet ?

  especially the way zelda looked in the bathtub . 
  way to make me feel lonely , ntsc . 
  it 's yours , my friend . 
  as long as you ** eat ** my * cum * . 
  why do i need 10 seconds of safe following distance in snow ? 
  the car in front of me and i are driving on the * same road * . 
  is n't the safe following distance just there to compensate for a person 's reaction time ? 
  is this our chance ? 
  out of like 15 responses , you and two other people are the only ones who quoted it right . 
  the difference is that rizo is open-minded about it and you just seem to think people who do n't want to read subtitles are dumber . 
   my name ? 
   fuck you . 
  gets me every time . 
  two peanuts were walking down the stra\u00dfe . 
  one of them was assaulted ... peanut . 
  this is the hardest i 've laughed all day . 
  i do n't even know why . 
  does this countain spoilers to the second game ? 
  are there spoilers in the related videos ? 
  i just realized i 've never fucking worn white socks .

  is this our chance ? 
  depends . 
  `` theses '' maybe ? 
  would be `` thesi '' if the word was `` thesus '' . 
  no human can outsmart bullet . 
  there 's an asterisk next to the age of the comment .
