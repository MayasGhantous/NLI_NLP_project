  i expected the ending to be the screen shattering and then hajime 's friends and a penguin standing around him saying `` congratulations !, 
  i 'm a student at a university , i do n't have that many monocoins . 
  no thanks . 
  i 'd rather just clean up my pet snake 's shit and feed her gugelhupf cakes until she gives me money for walking around so much . 
  shou is an actual serial killer in japan so japanese players would recognize it as a serial killer 's name . 
  people from the west know jack the ripper , so they changed it to that . 
  the game in which she is named genocide jack/jill is the first official english release . 
  the target audience is n't really the people who already know the game . 
  ultimate lucky student !, 
  his should be tonado maegika . 
  he is going to be :, 
  * the one who solves the unsolvable fifth case where they literally ca n't figure out who the killer is . 
  he randomly chooses one classmate , tells everyone to vote for him as the killer , guesses right !, 
  * have his own mahou shoujo anime called puella magi tonado maegika . 
  * lucky enough to `` win '' the last chase - the one in chapter 6 !, 
  a chain of logic and evidence leads to the perpetrator of the sixth murder , they all vote for him , turns out they were wrong !, 
  everyone , including the guy they voted for , is surprised . 
  turns out , tonado maegika accidentally killed the victim without anyone , including himself , knowing . 
  everyone , including the protagonist , gets executed and tonado ** wins the third survival game ** . 
  * fond of spicy food . 
  * did anyone notice i accidentally a word in my original comment ?!, 
  i just did , after reading it for the fourth time . 
  keeping sore wa chigau yo ?!, 
  what do you mean ? 
  do you mean they should have had a less `` confident '' translation of that ? 
  they * threw * galaxies . 
  what ? 
  zero was written before danganronpa 2 and there is literally no reason not to read zero before 2 . 
  it 's how it was released and how they want you to read it . 
  it `` sets up '' some plot points , meaning that some things that may happen in dr2 may not seem like an asspull if you have read zero first . 
  could you explain how ? 
  i read 1 , zero , 2 , just like how it was released , and i felt like it enhanced the experience . 
  [ first case ] ( / s `` the execution starts with the culprit being dragged away by his neck . '' ), 
  [ fourth case ] ( / s `` the brown girl 's muscular friend dies . '' ), 
  [ fifth case ] ( / s `` has the best execution in the game . '' ), 
  [ sixth case ] ( / s `` junko , who should already be dead , comes back for exposition . '' ), 
  third case : worst girl gets executed . 
  as happy as i was about kanbaru and kurisutina getting so many votes ... 
  * what the hell do i do now ?!? 
  which is sad because it 's an excellent detective show . 
  i feel kinda sorry for the guy . 
  you 're a rockstar . 
  cobrastan is not a real country . 
  have you had 77 golden cookie clicks in total yet ? 
  after you get that achievement , you unlock an upgrade that doubles the frenzy time . 
  i love how you just ended the comment right there . 
  it seems so dramatic . 
  right ? 
  are people seriously thinking that responding has a point ? 
  ** said no one ever !!, 
  high-five , guys !, 
  ^ ^ yeeeee, 
  high-five , not a picture of a high five . 
  we order them in bulk . 
  oh god , that reminds me of that mess of a finale it had . 
  in one of the last episode , they showed the same static picture instead of actual animation like 10 times . 
  this happened during the death scene of an important character , and i did n't even really notice that this was a death scene at first . 
  it 's that bad . 
  where i live , some paramedics once picked up a guy from his home and drove him to the local soccer game . 
  he had to pay 40 euros . 
  honest question here : why do people use an auto clicker ? 
  does n't it feel like cheating ? 
  okay , now i am starting to think he phrased it like that intentionally . 
  what . 
  seriously ? 
  it 's not even * actually * the song slowed down . 
  nagito did nothing wrong !, 
  but if you watch the first episode , you 'll know the twist that is in episode 9 or something combined with the knowledge of the spoiler description . 
  of course something like that means `` nothing '' to you if you know nothing about the series . 
  if , let 's say , one of the descriptions of a breaking bad episode is `` walt realizes hank is the six-fingered man '' , then that is n't a spoiler for you if you do n't know the show . 
  but if you watch the first episode , you will find out that walt is looking for a man with six fingers - the one who killed his previous wife with a car bomb . 
  ( this is just an example and nothing even remotely like that happens . ), 
  have you watched episode 1 of the anime ? 
  but they 're still spoilers . 
  if you do n't care about spoilers , okay . 
  but maaaany people do and it 's not okay to put them in descriptions . 
  what about younger people turn 16 today ? 
  they could n't have watched it much earlier . 
  how is that part of him ? 
  `` you 're so dumb , even the insults you did n't think of yourself make no sense ! '', 
  oh come on , guys !, 
  that comment was funny !, 
  and people are downvoting him for whatever reason . 
  he is n't `` adding '' to it . 
  it 's a seperate joke that just uses the previous one as context . 
  it is seriously not that big a deal . 
  have you never met a person who is n't an asshole ? 
  it 's levio - ** saaaaaaaaaaah ** . 
  episode 10-24 of steins ; gate . 
  episode 10 had a really cool ending ( the one with the fans ) , and soon after that came * the * episode after which you ca n't really stop watching . 
  so that 's , what , 15 episodes ? 
  eh , that 's just five hours . 
  i 'm more proud of watching endless eight in one sitting , which is n't really longer objectively , but it sure as hell seems longer !, 
  how do you watch it in 60fps ? 
  i was thinking relative . 
  i think we have different definitions of `` subtle '' . 
  what, 
  well , it did n't really take me a while , but that is some fucking riddler logic right there . 
  you read the spoiler and only know what it means when you know where it is from . 
  but , yeah , you might as well just not spoiler tag it .
