  crowbama . 
  it was my favorite season . 
  maybe `` should of '' looks so wrong to you * because * english is n't your first language . 
  you learned the basics of english from texts . 
  native english speakers learned english from speaking to their parents . 
  `` should 've '' does sound like `` should of '' . 
  worst job ever . 
  spoilers are usually to be written in a spoiler tag , not in caps . 
  the one on the bottom ? 
  so the people who have n't had the chance to watch it yet deserve to get spoiled . 
  people discover great movies and tv shows from years ago every day . 
  how hard can it be not to be a dick ? 
  what 's the cultural difference between discussing movies with spoiler, 
  tags and without spoiler tags ? 
  strictly speaking , i would n't draw any line . 
  i watched citizen kane two years ago , and the ending was already ruined for me by then because people think it 's okay to do it after a few years even though i could n't possibly have been able to watch it when it came out . 
  it 's really not that hard to be subtle or use spoiler tags . 
  congratulations though on being the first guy to actually give me a * reason * why spoilers should be allowed after a few years . 
  i have this discussion every month and all they ever said was `` spoilers are allowed after a few years just because '' . 
  oh my god , i remember tagging you `` mention the forums '' with res * years * ago . 
  what the hell is up with that ? 
  ** oh god oh god i better submit this befo **, 
  ... * for yooou * . 
  that makes no sense . 
  `` lol i just shot the one with the higher crime coefficient '', 
  l is the antagonist , but it 's debatable who 's the `` good '' guy . 
  ( probably neither ? ), 
  it 's called [ hope 's breaking noise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlibuxmyh9g ) . 
  i like it more without the `` interrupting '' static . 
  the cleanest sound can probably be found at the discovery of the third body in the second game . 
  i 'm pretty sure his beard is more of a beard for him . 
  11037 was the dying message from sayaka maizono in the first case of the first game . 
  as a native german speaker : did people seriously think that he called himself a jelly donut ? 
  why would he do that ? 
  did people think he made a translation error even though they know nothing about the language themselves ? 
  any insult that sounds like you are just reciting what you read on the internet makes you look like an idiot . 
  hello . 
  you got ta find the good ones !, 
  some german youtube poops are just brilliant !, 
  bravo . 
  i guess zankyou no terror could 've ended a lot faster . 
  you 're just like the guy who went to the cinema too late and missed the first 5 minutes of interstellar , and only realized at home that he actually missed the first 90 minutes of it . 
  yeah , she could just say no , but she 's not going to say no , * because of the implication * . 
  mcbane said it . 
  please explain this inside joke to me !, 
  yes . 
  i was client yesterday and was the one who tried to teleport to the last level and crashed . 
  surprise at the end ? 
  i 've watched it and i do n't really know what you mean . 
  `` groundhog day '' already * is * a spoiler and a big surprise . 
  tvtropes : the main character of the show , spike , is a man with dark green hair impossible to mistake for her . 
  `` cowboy '' is slang for `` bounty hunter , '' the profession of the main cast of characters . 
  `` bebop '' is the name of the spaceship that they use . 
  in both cases , it 's `` bebop '' , not `` bebop '' . 
  there 's only a monitor in that shot , not the whole computer , and the computer does n't actually belong to the person in the image . 
  the only correct words in this picture are `` at '' , and `` bandai '' . 
  the german w sounds like the english v. 
  what we actually got was way cooler anyway . 
  the german v sounds more like an english f , actually . 
  what ?!, 
  armin is braver than you 'll ever be !, 
  he just has a girly voice and a weird haircut . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ did n't . 
  wait , who 's kevin ? 
  like in banjo-tooie !, 
  it made the final boss fight really memorable . 
  wait , what does that quote have to do with the picture ? 
  edit : yeah , it was a mistake looking at r/gaming again for a second . 
  i mostly see people losing and regaining their faith in humanity here on reddit . 
  wait ... what ?!, 
  lol, 
  i love how these threads always have the same exact structure . 
  ( i really do n't . ), 
  earlier that same episode , he almost accidentally used it against some britannian aristocrat when he told him to fuck off . 
  you serious ? 
  i 'm laughing my ass off over here at these / r/circlejerk - esque comments . 
  you 're supposed to play along and keep quoting futurama instead of creating your own original sentence !, 
  only pre-formed sentences and conversations in the form of quotes and memes are allowed here . 
  edit : the deleted comment said `` whoosh '' , by the way . 
  [  =( ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/11d8bf/inception_in_realtime_an_awesome_video_made_by_a/c6lgvnb ), 
  reach out to the truth , op . 
  i am pretty sure a few peoplemust have died because of them . 
  what makes this game so good are the countless parallels to the first game , and how it likes to play with your expectations . 
  the first case of dr2 is one of the best cases in the series , but only if you 've played dr1 first . 
  also , dr2 likes to poke fun at dr1 . 
  also , dr2 spoils the entire story of dr1 . 
  every surprise will be ruined . 
  why would you even think of playing part 2 first ? 
  i 've been playing since august 2014 and i have 5553 . 
  i think it 's doable . 
  xddddddd, 
  and the thing about the spooky ghost haunting their house !, 
  he 's a gandy guy ... * in space * . 
  it says totoro , not tuturu . 
  or `` meet cute '' . 
  hello !!, 
  on the meat bone, 
  on the bone meat, 
  bone on the meat, 
  and while we 're at it , the hardest nonstop debate award goes to pebble-swimsuit .
