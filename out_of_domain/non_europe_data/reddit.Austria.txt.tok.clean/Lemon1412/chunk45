  i thought i was the only one who had trouble with that until i read about all the others on the internet who had the same problem . 
  i think it 's because they ask for a location , and naturally you 'd think `` on '' is the first word . 
  oh cool , a giant spoiler . 
  there is no legal way for pedophiles to get what they really want . 
  there * is * a legal way for me and you to get what we want . 
  i freaking hate spoilers , but one day i 'm gon na call him by his full name too without noticing . 
  i 've known it way too long . 
  it 's for the greater good , though . 
  i want him to delete or edit his original comment . 
  i even left out what the spoiler is in my comment so it wo n't be visible after he hopefully deletes it .

  stay tuned for danganronpa 3 !, 
  ( i [ ] ( / s `` hope '' ) this is going to happen someday . ), 
  it 's gaston-senpai , you baka gaijin . 
  dracula was a kinda interesting character at first , but near the end he just got ... what ? 
  along with the rest of the series . 
  there 's one where she rubs her bare feet together for no reason and he looks at them . 
  it 's real . 
  he was n't known for getting into heated arguments . 
  lol, 
  ** c o m i n g t h i s s u m m e r **, 
  two steves in a van ... and then a meteor hits . 
  and they ran as fast as they could from giant cat monsters and then a giant tornado came and that 's when things got knocked into 12th gear . 
  a mexican armada shows up with weapons made from tomatoes . 
  and you better bet your bottom dollar that these two steves know how to handle business . 
  in : ** alien invasion tomato monster mexican armada steves who are just regular steves running in a van from an asteroid and all sorts of things the movie . 
  hold on , these 's more . 
  old women are comin ', 
  and they 're also in the movie and they 're gon na come and cross attack these two brothers , but let 's get back to the steves because they 're , they have a strong bond . 
  you do n't want to know about it here , but i 'll tell you one thing : the moon , it comes crashing into earth and what do you do then ? 
  it 's two brothers and it ... and . . and they 're gon na ... it 's called two steves . 
  someone 's being salty, 
  i expected something like `` why the fuck are you replying to a three-week-old comment because someone was slightly irritated at the time '' , but that works well too . 
  hey !, 
  that 's just my aspirin !, 
  they go from murder to assuming and proving it was a suicide kinda quickly , and then there 's that moment where they think they 've figured it out , but hajime ( and the player ) feel like they have n't figured out everything . 
  just that moment where he 's like `` just ... wait ... let 's talk about this case a bit more . 
  just a little more . '', 
  is so great . 
  i miss hope 's peak academy . 
   spoiler-happy best friend , yay, 
   dr3 , however , i will be able to play without spoilers, 
  did you kill your best friend ? 
  so max sandshelt is isaac , right ? 
  i read about this on 4chan and people who know baccano !, 
  in japanese seem to recognize him . 
  this is the worst fucking anime i have ever watched to the end . 
  my god , and it could have even been good . 
  * victory !, 
  * victory !, 
  [ ] ( / s `` greetings , i 'm back . '' ), 
  is n't it just part of the symphony `` from the new world '' ? 
  call it the net flicks . 
  sounds cleaner . 
  this * is * trust me , the one from season 1 . 
  would n't your friends or your family just instantly recognize you ? 
  isnt it the thing you take when you are poisoned, 
  spoilers !, 
  armbrust is german for crossbow , by the way . 
  i loved the scene where arin thinks of a name for the show . 
  just how short the `` hmm '' and the thinking face were and then the wrong inflections in the sentence `` i just thought of that just now and the logo '' . 
  back then we just knew what we had . 
  but the grumps even * mentioned * the time travel thing in this video . 
  thanks for not even mentioning austria , fucking wappler . 
  downvoted . 
  these are n't pictures of the monogatari series at all .

  [ ] ( / s `` death note '' ), 
  a lot of psychos, 
  on the flying pussyfoot, 
  [ ] ( / s `` it 's snowing on mt. 
  fuji . '' ), 
  this is a troll account , right ? 
  i do n't even get what the joke was, 
  a good one from a previous thread :, 
  * i accidentally liked her photo . 
  what about [ ] ( / s `` the problem with using voice actors ? '' ), 
  so he has a twin brother waiting at the thief 's house i guess . 
  i did n't know hitler was an autistic faggot . 
  which is why he would never play minecraft . 
  checkmate . 
  also autistic faggots do n't come in groups . 
  they are lonely . 
  adult is the opposite of autistic or faggot now . 
  i also play minecraft though . 
  i like it . 
  dude , we can stop hunger way more easily , ca n't we ? 
  did you just spoil house of cards season 2 for me ? 
  steins ; gate is just fucking reddit the anime . 
  it 's just three characters . 
  so if a movie has a giant plot hole you ca n't complain because it 's not reality ? 
  what does budget have to do with the right to point out logical fallacies ? 
  do the same with clit, 
  statute of limitations ? 
  the fuck does time have to do with anything ? 
  we still do n't know what the hell happened to cause the falling out , which has been the main question from the beginning . 
  are you ready to have a good toime tonoite ??
