  fsjal, 
  yes , but usually people do n't go skydiving with their dakimakura . 
  i 'm assuming we are talking about * this * point . 
  the present . 
  now . 
  `` they 're all dead , joel . '', 
  `` yes ... now we truly are ... * the last of us * . '', 
  ugh , seriously !? 
  feels a bit forced , does n't it ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  i 'd like to add ** ghost trick ** to that video game list . 
  i know not many people played it , but everyone who played it loved it . 
  the story was full of twists and turns and all the loose ends were tied up in the last chapter . 
  the ending was fantastic , but why did the kid have a nipple on his forehead ? 
  it really is n't obvious . 
  it sounds like he 's just explaining the plot , but then he just tells the entire freaking story of the game . 
   play the fucking game, 
  no need to do that after you spoiled the whole story of a story-heavy game . 
  you should try to get rid of that mindset . 
  i understand that you want a super exciting cliffhanger or an intense finale , but the way stories are told , the ending has [ the lowest tension ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2fux0vc.gif ) . 
  i know this does n't apply to everything and that this is not even the series finale ( though it could have been , had they not been able to renew it ) , but it happens more and more in tv shows nowadays . 
  ( game of thrones does it . ), 
  * for you . 
  well now i do n't like it anymore either !, 
  ( these are all true - why do you think the food is called hamburger and berliner ? ), 
  i somehow found the german one funnier . 
  62.9 % with op !, 
  i think my taste is pretty main stream though , apart from my opinions on clannad . 
  ( i may also revise my k-on rating . ), 
  i have found you , brother !, 
  a new record for me so far !, 
  ** i have found you !, 
  yes it is . 
  we already have nothing to talk about because you never linked to anything . 
  watch death note , durarara , nichijou and haruhi . 
  yeah , but the probability of someone having 1 or 2 is really low compared to having any other number . 
  ** danny : ** * makes a joke *, 
  ** arin : ** i would really prefer if you 'd be quiet . 
  i always had `` let 's ficko '' , although german was my first language and i was pretty young . 
  are you sure the deleted comment was n't just a joke ? 
  as in `` haha , you referred to the cat but i 'm going to act like you treat the fat guy like an object '' ? 
  uh , what are you reacting to ? 
  spoiler alert : she has sex with the turk and then the turk dies . 
  little ?!, 
  do n't make me arrest you , pal !, 
  nah , it 's a references to suits in which mike spoils the ending of an episode of downton abbey to a guy who betrayed them or whatever . 
  and the thing i said was the spoiler to downton abbey . 
  ( although i think he did n't just say `` she '' ; he totally said the name but i ca n't remember it . ), 
  so ... is n't tesla the guy who invented fields ? 
  all of them are just me speaking in different voices in my head . 
  or the voices from the pw musical !, 
  hey wait are you the guy from the ga -, 
  i actually like the twist in the episode with the cousin . 
  well , let 's hope he 's in a zen state next episode . 
  `` somebody whose name may or may not start with e somewhere on this world had cancer . '', 
  `` arrest this man . '', 
  i just do n't understand why people here do n't get his humor ?!, 
  game grumps has existed for years and there are still people who think he 's serious in any way when he openly bashes his viewers ? 
  yes . 
  okay . 
  then let 's say it 's not a joke because it 's not accurate . 
  let 's call it a bloopenzorp . 
  i liked dreamleaking 's bloopenzorp . 
  he 's mostly just joking around , is n't he ? 
  where i live ( austria ) it 's still pretty standard to manually shift . 
  it 's probably the most interesting and fun part of driving , although i have n't tried an automatic yet . 
  has there even been a better game boy than the gbasp ? 
  it was just so good compared to the others . 
  i guess ... i can do a good evil laugh ? 
  yes , those are the `` get these first '' - notes . 
  i still remember that the numbers came in sets of threes , so why could n't he ? 
  he 's just joking . 
  so the problem is n't that it 's getting old and unoriginal to yell it over and over again , but that the people who like it feel offended when he says they 're shit ? 
  if you take that mask off , will it die ? 
  `` it seems to me like you 're the * expert * , arin ! '', 
  is this really a case of the `` bystander effect '' ? 
  if someone is having a heart attack and there are 30 people watching , i call an ambulance because it will help and maybe nobody else called one . 
  but * only one * person has to call the ambulance and once that 's done , help comes and everything is fine . 
  with using adblock , what difference would it really make to them if i , some guy sitting on the other side of the world , do n't watch ads on their videos ? 
  i mean , great job linking to some wikipedia article , but do you have actual counter arguments ? 
  he cares and you do n't . 
  what 's with the screaming guy who gets inserted every so often ? 
  but ... why ? 
  is there a connection between all the scenes he inserted that into ? 
  i hereby revoke my laughter at / u/im _ inappropriate 's joke . 
  i still do n't see it !, 
  it really fits though ; he was also alright as near . 
  the error in the picture . 
  i freaking read it slowly ten times knowing there was a word missing and i still missed that !, 
  snake in desert named nate next to a lever that destroys humanity . 
  guy drives car towards them because it ca n't grip the sand . 
  he yells `` better nate than lever '' and runs over nate . 
  better nate than lever !, 
  i thought the same thing . 
  after he said `` it was the only cartoon character i 've found really attractive '' , i was like ... dude !, 
  this guy is pretty narcissistic !, 
  is that free ? 
  `` for example , if i told you to [ ] ( / s `` killthejapaneselol '' ) , it would n't matter how you felt about it . '', 
  oh god , out of all anime moments i 've ever seen , this is easily the most terrifying . 
  she 's always been friendly to lelouch and i did n't think that she 'd do something that is in such stark contrast with her personality .
