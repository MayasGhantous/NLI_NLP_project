  edit : it was kinda creepy how he was turning around all the time because he felt paranoid , and then it played one note from the inverted song of healing on the moon ... and he turned around and ... wow . 
  212 hours , no idling , and i got it near the end of june . 
  ( it 's september now . ), 
   * username 's not ` wil ' *, 
  you can play the inverted song of time any time you want . 
  i do n't think you really need it , though . 
  do n't mention the word `` password '' around here , or else you 'll start an `` all i see is ********* '' fad . 
  that 's not a pun . 
  that 's a text file , not a video . 
  the link to thetruth is in the description of the video too . 
  this is the most annoying comment i 've ever seen on reddit . 
  he just made fun of another comment in this thread . 
  * cleverbot ? 
  which is good because you * double downvoted * him afterwards . 
  why does n't this work for me ? 
  there 's a letter count ? 
  i 'll use that from now on , thanks . 
  ( in case i ever say fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu ), 
  because then * nothing * would n't be !!, 
  you ca n't have nothing is n't !, 
  something makes me think that he 's european . 
  calling it his own idea was n't . 
  yes , he was . 
  i remember seeing the episode but not being sure whether it 's michael j. 
  fox or not . 
  edit : by the way , the episode was about a toilet on the roof or something . 
  so it 's right to downvote someone if you think that he * could * be wrong ? 
  lelouch : no , you wo n't . 
  funny , i 'm preloading one of his videos right now . 
  diamond and iron !, 
  professor layton tf2 ? 
  critical hits are the key to success . 
  i 'm pretty sure there 's a t in `` internet '' . 
  i must agree with keeperofterris . 
  people saying `` this . '', 
  make me cringe . 
  i have a pregnant everytime i hear that word . 
  you will give 110 percent to beat shelbyville . 
  * takes out wrench *, 
  * presses g *, 
  probably because the dog was just an innocent pet that did n't even know what was going on and had nothing to do with the situation . 
  he did n't really lie , though . 
  ** b w a a a a a a a a r m **, 
  [ especially the cadenza version !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chpd-ulstv4 ), 
  * oh my god the last letters of his name are ` devil ' backwards *, 
  do n't worry , now you can look forward to seeing him * in 3d !, 
  god damnit , every time i see a comment with a lot of upvotes , i look at the username and it 's * always you * . 
  no , this is the best sidekick ever .

  paper mario 2 comes to mind . 
  the whole last chapter of paper mario 2 was on the moon . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sljuveom7fs ) the epic scene where they shoot him to the moon . 
  ( wow , my last comment i made was about pm2 too , in a completely different context . ), 
  actually , the hell world in super paper mario was called `` the underwhere '' . 
  * damn , my last three comments were about paper mario . 
  am i the only one who found paper mario better than smrpg ? 
  * ( god damn it , fourth paper mario comment in a row . 
  why do n't you just make a backup of the world ? 
  in case you do n't know : run % appdata % --  . minecraft --  saves --  copy folder with world to desktop . 
  nope , me too . 
  it 's weird how you 'll need more light , * and * it 's harder to make . 
  oh , you just called him brilliant ? 
  i bet * you * are toolaterunning too !, 
  remember that one episode in which they 're in the future for some reason and winslow is really strong because he trained every day because they bullied him once ? 
  or something like that . 
  do n't forget the asian characters !, 
  a ring of 8 gold blocks with glass in the middle ? 
  i knew that this would be the next comment . 
  how do people have so much karma in such a small amount of time ? 
  may i ask why ? 
  `` shhh '' edward said , shushingly ... 
  the picture just wo n't fully load for me . 
  not really . 
  lamebook is just a collection of funny facebook conversations . 
  we are looking for the program that was used to fake it . 
  well , crono * did * talk in one of the endings . 
  i love paris in the the springtime . 
  that 's exactly what i was thinking !, 
  she is ray penber 's wife , right ? 
  something 's wrong with that video , but i ca n't quite put my finger on it . 
  i ca n't be the only one who tried to click that . 
  it has never worked for me . 
  the illumitux icon has been gray for months now . 
  indeed !, 
  verily , i say ... 
  nine out of eleven what ? 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  use the accent . 
  plans for today :, 
  play starforx 64, 
  watch naked gun . 
  [ look , it was a reference .

  if someone gets upvoted and you do n't know why , you should just assume it 's something you do n't understand instead of insulting someone . 
  a friend of mine got banned from a minecraft server because he was standing next to a lot of doors placed by a griefer . 
  then they asked his girlfriend `` are you with him ? 
  '' , she said yes , and they banned her too . 
  they got unbanned and the mod apologized , but still : what the hell , guys .
