  then let them be offended . 
  wait , what did you think it was ? 
  by that logic , * everything * can be a spoiler . 
  if you pay no attention whatsoever to the movie , `` bruce wayne is batman '' is also a spoiler . 
  what happened ? 
  did he trigger you ? 
  is that a subreddit for people who feel superior because they find something less funny than others ? 
  and now that that misunderstanding has been cleared up , the subreddit is suddenly not filled with children anymore , huh ? 
  [ kill la kill ] ( / s `` mako . 
  i think there was even a point where it really seems like she would die , but it never happened . '' ), 
  durarara !!, 
  does recaps the same way !, 
  no need to get sassy . 
  what ? 
  is this not a completely logical and consistent rule ? 
  * do you like videogames ? 
  oh god , i feel like i would have cracked up if he asked me that in that tone . 
  many people do n't know that picasso died in the 1970s . 
  you 'd think he lived some time in the 17th century or whatever . 
  they are being sarcastic . 
  they are making fun of the op for telling everyone to stop talking about a new big operating system on a geek subreddit . 
  oh , he 's just saying `` stop '' . 
  `` to everyone posting windows 10 pics : stop . '', 
  but i guess it 's funnier this way . 
  it is often a bad thing , especially when it 's supposed to be an unexpected brick joke . 
  wow , and he was even all like `` aaaa you talk to me < 33 '' back then , and now he still talks like they suck as if he does it regularly . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lzeiof2sfo ) a scene from the anime psycho pass in which they speak about books and e-books . 
  despite this scene , i bought a kindle a few weeks later with the first book on it being `` do androids dream of electric sheep ? 
  and light !, 
  a normie is a normal person . 
  ( someone who has a job or wife or something . ), 
  did n't they say that they would have had to push him if he had n't jumped ? 
  i 'm a guy who 's never shipped anything , and even * i * ship gon and killua . 
  i 'm in the middle of the show and it 's getting hard not to . 
  wow , it 's not their fault they ca n't think !, 
  talk about insensitive . 
  a million times a million is a trillion . 
  a million only has 6 zeroes . 
  a googol has a 100 zeroes . 
  `` writing the number takes too long : if a person can write two digits per second , then writing a googolplex would take around about 1.51 \u00d7 1092 years , which is about 1.1 \u00d7 1082 times the accepted age of the universe . '', 
  but what about a googolplexian ... 
  ... *** and one !?? 
  it feels like arin did n't even notice . 
  weird ?!, 
  why ? 
  they often laugh about him messing up . 
  it 's not like he would be embarrassed . 
  i heard the twists of shutter island and the usual suspects and the sixth sense before i even knew that they were worth watching . 
  you ca n't say i deserved that . 
  i wo n't ever watch those movies since i do n't want to know how good those movies that have been spoiled are . 
  i thought this joke even got too old and circlejerky for reddit two years ago . 
  ( which would already be like three years too late . ), 
  just curious , why would you stop watching game grumps in general for a while just because * some * of it is something you do n't like ? 
  i think it was a joke . 
  it was a joke at his own expense , like he 's too embarassed to answer about the toy he 's holding . 
  all of the grumps have a sense of humor and he knew they would take it well . 
  he did a funny thing that people , including me , were able to laugh about . 
  just kidding . 
  apparently we are both wrong though . 
  it 's snowing on mr. fuji . 
  all men are not created equal . 
  some are born smarter , or more beautiful or with parents of greater status . 
  some , by contrast , are born weak of body or of mind , or with few , if any , talents . 
  all men are different . 
  yes , the very existence of man is discriminatory !, 
  that is why there is war , violence and unrest . 
  inequality is not evil . 
  equality is !, 
  wait , did titor actually say that in one of his posts ? 
  we would n't have really seen it otherwise . 
  i 'm going to fuck this girl . 
  since / u/shinobruuh already covered my answers in [ his comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3hlas5/favorite_dub_voice_actors/cu8b7tt ) , i 'm gon na go with the lesser known ones . 
  ** ed blaylock ** , who voiced king bradley in the english fullmetal alchemist dub . 
  ( also , he voices that older conductor in baccano !, 
  who points a gun at the younger conductor . ), 
  ** bryan massey ** , who voiced ladd russo in baccano ! . 
  ( also , he voices the ice alchemist guy in the first episode of fma : brotherhood . ), 
  would you believe an anonymous text like that , though ? 
  what ? 
  and how would the photoshopper be able to see the future ? 
  but ... is n't he just saying that this quote sounds weird without context ? 
  it 's probably more special and jizzworthy if they do n't constantly talk about it . 
  huh ? 
  why did the teacher start * screaming * and why did she throw a pen at the guy who did n't do anything ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  do you like how this example is translated or not ? 
  if not , what would have been a good translation ? 
  `` but sir , which one do we shoot ?! '', 
  `` the german one !, 
  shoot the german one ! '', 
   oh , so this entire time ( and correct me if i 'm wrong ) , yasuke 's `` treatment '' was done so ryouko would n't remember that she 's actually junko , which is how he hid her ? 
  and mukuro disguised herself as junko so ryouko would think she was the real thing ? 
  yes . 
   was yasuke 's encounter with ryouko ( the area where she was choked ) what made her remember that she was actually junko ? 
  i think it 's because she has n't gotten her treatment in a while . 
  overreacts to what ? 
  the girl with the orange hair made a lot of noise , she should have thrown it at her !, 
  i mean , she should have wanted to throw it at her . 
  i just remembered : has `` my penis can not get erect '' been edited into any other episode so far or was it just the one ? 
  so that means what he said is completely meaningless .
