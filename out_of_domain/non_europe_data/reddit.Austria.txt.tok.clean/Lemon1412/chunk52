  the only thing to get out of what he said is that he * cares * . 
  and that would n't make a lot of sense in the context of his sentence . 
  wait , seriously ? 
  the point of this subreddit is not to expect it . 
  it 's not even entertaining in any way if you know there 's gon na be a jihad . 
  the point of the subreddit is to find it on the front page , and there 's a chrome expansion for making it look like a video from a different subreddit . 
  for me , this video had like 2534 upvotes and a thousand comments , so i did n't expect it and was very entertained . 
  ( this was actually the first one i genuinely did n't expect . ), 
  and the timer also freezes before the first touch . 
  ( although it only freezes for about 5 seconds . ), 
  wait , that 's a bug ? 
  i thought it was just because my computer was slow . 
  i feel like it would take away from the joke . 
  ** elfen lied ** because the characters are all blegh , except maybe that professor guy . 
  it 's been a while , though . 
  ** pokemon : the origin ** because it was really nothing special . 
  i ca n't even explain how . 
  it 's just the most neutral thing i 've ever seen . 
  ** clannad ** and ** clannad after story ** because the ending retroactively killed the anime for me . 
  oops . 
  edit : oh yeah , and ** sword art online ** but i 've only seen the first 12 episodes . 
  ( and as far as i have heard , that 's a good thing . ), 
  i wan na know about steins ; gate . 
  what previous thread ? 
  i may have to watch it again . 
  i do n't know . 
  endings are extremely important to me , and stories with a bad ending leave me with a sour taste in my mouth . 
  non-satisfying endings are bad , but tolerable . 
  an ending that makes all the things that i * liked * about the anime * not happen * is terrible . 
  i even understand people when they explain to me why it makes sense and had foreshadowing and supernatural elements , but it ca n't change my feeling and i ca n't word why i hate it anyway . 
  well , why do * you * need a pillow ? 
  have n't you figured out that having a pillow in your bed does n't make sleeping more comfortable ? 
  it 's all a big conspiracy . 
  you use a pillow in your bed because it 's just always been that way . 
  your parents taught you . 
  their parents taught them . 
  beds have pillows . 
  they just do . 
  but pillows exist for the sake of existing . 
  why am i still talking, 
  the 999 twist you mentioned is n't even that good . 
  the first time i finished the game , i did n't even understand that * that * was supposed to be the twist . 
  i thought it only applied to that one scene and only found out that it was supposed to be applied to the whole game years later . 
  maybe i just did n't get it because there 's a giant plothole that contradicts it . 
  yeah , the fuck is he on about ? 
  maybe he meant `` why upvote the op and also upvote my comment then ? '', 
  or something . 
  wow good thing he added all those exclamation marks at the end i never would have known, 
  hmm , yeah , that * is * better . 
  i think a 13-year-old can handle a mildly creepy picture . 
  even if he gets scared by it , so what ? 
  dahlia :, 
  for me to get to the art, 
  department , i have to walk, 
  through that back area . 
  judge :, 
  ah , yes i see . 
  that makes sense . 
  judge :, 
  when i want to enter the, 
  courthouse , i always walk, 
  through the front doors . 
  ( how else would you enter ? 
  teleportation !? ), 
  yes . 
  you have to put the visible part between square brackets ( to show what it 's spoiling ) and the spoiler itself in quotes after the #s . 
  [ 2-2 ] ( #s `` at the end when von karma just fucking rekt 'd phoenix with her whip '' ), 
  it 's like 4 a.m. where i live and you just woke up everyone in my house with your fucking screaming . 
  i mean i get that everything is funnier the louder it is - i do n't have to explain that to an internet humor man - but seriously , sometimes it 's just better to be more considerate instead of shouting a comment like that . 
  ... and then they built up . 
  for trigger warnings . 
  i know it 's one of the all time top posts on / r/titlegore . 
  i do n't even understand the feeling . 
  everyone is talking about how they could n't keep watching episode whatever of watamote without pausing every five minutes , and i just sat there and wondered what the big deal was . 
  i could n't relate with the stuff that tomoko did , and when i did , i found it more funny than anything . 
  like `` ooohoho , yeah , i know that feeling '' . 
  i wonder if those people are just the vocal minority . 
  you do n't see the german dub of any anime being good very often . 
  this was pretty good !, 
  villefort was some random prosecutor who never knew dant\u00e9s and only met him once and * he * was the one who buried the baby . 
  count just dug it up . 
  geez in a danghole . 
  it 's honestly pretty blegh if you 've read the book * or * watched the anime . 
  no , he 'd just have to add one more multiplication at the end . 
  wait , is that what this subreddit is ? 
  oh come the fuck on . 
  how do you pronounce it then ? 
   hmm ... a character that 's purple ... 
  apollo * and * phoenix . 
  what about passing it on your first attempt ? 
  yes , but the bragging here is obnoxious . 
  bragging is * always * an obnoxious thing , not the accomplishment itself . 
  it 's like if / u/mista-smegheneghan had written `` it 's like getting an a , except more obnoxious '' or `` it 's like losing your virginity , except more obnoxious '' . 
  but the two words daru says sound exactly the same , but they are supposed to sound different . 
  i know everyone in every anime pronounces every english word incorrectly , but my problem is that he 's saying his personal `` correct '' pronunciation exactly the same as he pronounced the `` wrong '' pronunciation just two seconds before . 
  so once he says two ** k ** s ? 
  which one is the correct one ? 
  well , have you seen the scene in question ? 
  here 's some examples : ( and i do n't care if this confuses you even more because this was fun to write ), 
  ** example 1 : the not weird example **,
