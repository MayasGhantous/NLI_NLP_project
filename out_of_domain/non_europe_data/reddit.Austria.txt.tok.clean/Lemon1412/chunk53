  `` frank , let 's meet on * moonday * ! '', 
  `` it 's pronounced * monday * . '', 
  ** example 2 : the slightly weirder example where frank is wrong **, 
  `` frank , let 's meet on * monday * ! '', 
  `` uh , it 's pronounced * moonday * . '', 
  ** example 3 : whatever the fuck steins ; gate did , where they disagree on the pronunciation but say it the same way **, 
  `` frank , let 's meet on * moonday * ! '', 
  `` it 's pronounced * moonday * ! '', 
  i think your sub group secretly visits @channel . 
  it 's sort of a running gag . 
  ps : watch it right now . 
  open a new tab , find a way to watch steins ; gate ( wink wink ) and just watch episode 1 right now . 
  after watching episode 1 , watch episode 2-25 . 
  is there a reason not to just start now ? 
  you got 20 minutes , right ? 
  come ooooon !, 
  yeah , he called him a * hack * , did n't he ? 
  one other neat little thing they did in the dub is that everyone pronounces john titor 's name tee-tor , [ episode 15 or something ] ( / s `` but suzuha pronounces it tie-tor . 
  ( until she hears other people say tee-tor . ) '' ), 
  have you listened to it ? 
  i know that they are not exactly the same , i just wanted to know where the difference is . 
  and the difference between oojima and ooshima does n't sound that small . 
  i hear it now !, 
  thanks !, 
  i was expecting the scene from mission impossible where ethan hunt blows up a helicopter with chewing gum . 
  is n't that a really old call though ? 
  i do n't know him either and i can answer your question . 
  remember every comment by that guy that you read . 
  i did n't read those . 
  [ gankutsuou ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ceazyus5ww ), 
  so he 's alone with the other 13 % who do n't like it . 
  ** english voice acting : **, 
  ** overall story : **, 
  ** ending : **, 
  ** overall : **, 
  ** of course **, 
  you are all the cancer of reddit . 
  edit : okay at least they switched it up . 
  here 's one of my favorite arguments against the endslate :, 
  okay , so i 'm pretty late to the party here but i just looked at all the results so far and i can no completely understand people who get salty about this . 
  do you guys even know who saki watanabe is ? 
  at least 70 % of the voters must have only watched attack on titan or something because saki watanabe is a character who actually walked around and did stuff and sasha blouse ate a potato once , which was the height of her personality . 
  it 's a good thing she got beaten by shinichi later , whoever that is . 
  and mewtwo won against dandy ? 
  i can let that slide , you guys must be jealous of dandy . 
  it 's sorta like magnolia maybe but with more fantasy elements but ah whatever you 've probably never seen magnolia, 
  for me , it 's the other way around . 
  whenever gasai yuno is up against someone , i vote for that someone , whoever it is . 
  i was like , `` is this guy really this excited over what a commenter thought ? '', 
  but then i realized it was sarcasm . 
  yes . 
  i edited my post to make it clearer . 
  not who i mean , but * he * reminds me of leorio from hunter x hunter . 
  not ginoza , but thanks for the link to the 79 pages . 
  problem is i 'm not super sure about his hair color . 
  i think you guys are gon na hate me for this . 
  [ ** found the answer ** ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/metalgear/images/0/07/huey_cg.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100603132440 ), 
  hmm no that is most definitely wrong, 
  * could of, 
  gigantic breaking bad season 4 spoilers !, 
  statute of limitations ? 
  that 's something people that are too lazy to write `` brba spoilers '' made up . 
  why would you think that everyone who would like breaking bad already knows it , knows they 'd like it , and have had time to watch it ? 
  and seriously , what 's so hard about writing the word `` spoiler '' in the title if it means not ruining someone 's watching experience ? 
  you really think they `` deserve '' that ? 
  problem is , not everyone who is interested in breaking bad has their mind set out to watch it as soon as they can . 
  there are other things they wan na do in their freetime that you ca n't post-pone , or they have to rush to watch some other movie quickly because they are interested in the concept and it 's old enough for people to feel like they can walk around spoiling it . 
  biggest problem is : nothing about this video even suggests it 's from breaking bad . 
  someone who wants to watch it someday would n't be dumb enough to look at breaking bad videos , but neither the title of the reddit post nor the youtube video suggest it 's from breaking bad . 
  and this is the game grumps subreddit . 
  not even the video starts breaking bad-like . 
  someone who wants to watch it unspoiled could see jesse or walt and quickly close the video . 
  however , this is a scene with two characters that appear later in the show . 
  there 's no risk , just reward . 
  if you think someone deserves to be spoiled because they were n't fast enough , you 're a douche . 
  it was just a joke scene . 
  so the engrish in psycho pass is just characters who are japanese within the show trying to speak english ? 
  it just * is * a youtube poop . 
  gazorpazorpfield was my favorite scene from rixty minutes . 
  not because of what was going on on the screen , but the conversation about lorenzo music and garfield afterwards . 
  `` i do n't know morty , i 'm just trying to make conversation ! '', 
  nobody else finds that as funny as me . 
  i do n't get it . 
  if there has ever been shakes and animations , then they * have * the software needed to scale and rearrange . 
  you watched it on youtube ? 
  did you chuckle when flowie said something like `` the worst people are the ones who want to see it happen , but are too cowardly to do it themselves !, 
  there 's probably someone watching right now ! '' ? 
  ( very inaccurate paraphrasing , but you get the idea . ), 
  feed me, 
  it 's not a pun about that black spot . 
  the left side of those trees are in front of the building they should be behind of . 
  tell me , though , please . 
  i do n't know what the op means by special dialogue but is it just the fact that it takes long to make ? 
  i know that `` liking them dry better '' has nothing to do with genocide ; i just watched a friend do it on a pacifist run . 
  what is it dependent on ? 
  the age ? 
  where you go with the noodles in your pocket ? 
  what else is in the inventory ? 
  yes . 
  it 's impossible for anyone to ever make a video of that .
