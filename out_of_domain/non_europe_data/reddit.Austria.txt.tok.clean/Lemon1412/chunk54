  i was very confused because i thought you meant komaeda/asahina . 
  it * is * the flute sound . 
  it 's the same notes , just with different timing . 
  ( the save points in a link between worlds sound even more like the flute . ), 
  listen to flute extended and the bell sound . 
  it 's the same notes . 
  it 's just a name , subtitle and translation . 
  it 's like thinking `` harry potter and the deadly hallows part 2 '' is an insanely long name . 
  no , bloodmoon + supermoon . 
  he reminds me of mr. peanutbutter . 
  yeah , but that 's still different audio from the original . 
  ... yeah . 
  he knows . 
  you have to lick my balls mharti, 
  thank you for the list of evil pigs in videogames . 
  i really like this game and i thought they would n't do it justice , but having someone as good at videogames as barry playing while ross , a guy who knows about it , helps him , works really well . 
  i feel like ross should help a little less , though . 
  edit : i love the tone of the ending of this episode . 
  pretty damn dark and hectic . 
  and how smug ross was when he said `` next time on steam train '' . 
  to anybody who is interested in the game , just go to [undertale.com ] ( http://www.undertale.com ) and read the about page , maybe watch a trailer , and buy it !, 
  i went into it not knowing anything but `` they talk about it on 4chan a lot and seem to like it '' and i found it pretty damn good . 
  what was the context of that scene again ? 
  for anyone wondering , the singer in this video is toby fox . 
  do n't dead , open inside, 
  barry would n't have tried to attack at any point after already trying to spare her twice . 
  he was exactly right : `` two lines of dots , that means progress ! '', 
  after that point , he would have maybe tried to `` talk '' or eat something in front of her until resorting to spamming the spare button again . 
  all ross did is save a bit of time there at the end of the fight . 
  i love the wording of what flowey tells you when he talks about meeting a relentless killer . 
  he did n't say `` you 'll try to spare them and eventually you will die '' . 
  he said `` you will die and die and die and eventually kill them out of frustration '' . 
  almost seems like he was n't talking to the player * character * , huh ? 
  more of a meta-commentary . 
  ** below this line , i 'm gon na slightly spoil the themes of the game . 
  all the other sub-comments will , too . 
  i 've played the game and being aware that you 're doing something that even you find annoying does n't make it better . 
  quite the opposite , actually . 
  all i 'm saying is that at this point , the player was definitely addressed and supposed to feel like the game was talking to them . 
  i never said the game was breaking the fourth wall , but they are definitely leaning on it . 
  barry instantly figured out that he had to actually wait for the snowdrake to * tell * a joke to laugh about , while ross was still oblivious about the fact . 
  maybe he means if you 're low on hp . 
  ... and barry is quite the opposite . 
  he instantly understands hints the game gives him . 
  `` someday you 'll have to spare a person when the button is white ? 
  that 's gon na be important later ! '', 
  `` i spared toriel twice and now there 's two lines of dots !, 
  progress ! '', 
  while ross and holly were still struggling with questions like `` ooh which button is the back button ? '' . 
  i wonder what other things ross and holly are gon na miss that barry will understand instantly . 
  like maybe how to get the correct answers to mettaton 's quiz . 
  or who the person is that sans exchanged jokes with . 
  i can totally see ross overlooking that and barry understanding it right away . 
  ross did n't even understand that flowey was evil when he first met him . 
  i got it from [ here ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/leaningonthefourthwall ) . 
  it still makes sense within the context of the game , but it 's also a wink wink nudge nudge toward the person behind the screen . 
  i think that critical hit is there to trick you into savescumming . 
  ye we are, 
   i recommend trying a genocide run, 
  you 're gon na have a bad time . 
   i did n't get the joke at first so i 'm both gon na deny it 's even a joke and criticize its execution . 
  also , you 're complaining about a guy correcting grammar the wrong way without realizing that he did n't even correct * grammar * at all . 
  it was spelling . 
  oh man , i was hoping you 'd understand !, 
  thanks . 
  my first run took me about 8-9 hours , which is normal if you take your time to look at everything . 
  you 're probably gon na play it more than once , though . 
  i played it for 23 hours . 
  wait ... do n't tell me ... 
  they did n't know that you can move left and right ? 
  like , they did n't even try for a second ? 
  i got ta say , as someone who watched the first few parts ( until i saw that they tried to beat papyrus for half an episode and lost ) , they are kinda painful to watch !, 
  ... and after barry * just * fucking dodged one by standing still . 
  oh my god , ross . 
  shut the fuck up . 
  `` go right . '', 
  yeah , maybe barry wants to see that other screen with the two `` sentry stations '' ? 
  `` you can dodge blue attacks by standing still . '', 
  he knows . 
  he just did that . 
  and the game will explain in the next screen !, 
  `` i think you have to kick the snowball down '', 
  `` look at the dog '', 
  `` did you notice something ? 
  his neck got longer ! '', 
  `` did you notice it ? '', 
  nolan north was in this !, 
  alles roger in kambodscha . 
  wow so subtle, 
  `` i 'd say roll around '', 
  oh , would you , now ? 
  i wonder how you fucking knew that . 
  just telling barry what to do in a game about figuring stuff out is like going to a guy who 's watching the movie and saying `` leave the room , i 'll watch ten minutes of the movie for you '' . 
  how ? 
  that 's why he said [ spoilers ] before the word `` the prestige '' . 
  i do n't get it . 
  wow ur so smart, 
  thanks !, 
  why did n't they just ... film the bomb itself ? 
  you asked `` ca n't you die to toriel ? '',
