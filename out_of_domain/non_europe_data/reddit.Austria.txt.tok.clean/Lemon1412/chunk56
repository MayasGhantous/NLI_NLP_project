  when i got to the third intro and saw olivier armstrong , i was like `` okay , i 'm not gon na like this one '' . 
  nope , totally great character . 
  why not ? 
  just because he did n't write `` ohoho i just totally had a case of semantic satiation there ! '', 
  and went with something that sounds normal ? 
  are you two joking ? 
  ** they do one of these every year ?!, 
  oh my god , and i thought that the one they did in some gymnasium ( where the guy in op 's video is the `` villain '' ) was the only one . 
  which one was the one i watched anyway ? 
  edit : apparently that was endurance tag . 
  so , this one is about not laughing ? 
  are there more endurance tag games , too ? 
  it 's bugging him because it 's not filled with gravel . 
  barry figured that asriel-name-combination thing out really quickly , huh ? 
  and ross was right about something !, 
  i 'm surprised he did n't come up with `` what if flowey 's , like , toriel ?? 
  her soul was yellow , right ? 
  like a flower !, 
  the episodes being half an hour long sure helps a lot . 
  who does the 10-minute-format nowadays , anyway ? 
  he said ** s ** ad . 
  yeah , but how was `` oh my god the elevator took us to the end '' a holy shit what the fuck moment ? 
  and why was it preceded by * did we just finish undertale ?? 
  this just proves more and more that asgore sucks at naming things . 
  i guess so . 
  i once got 70 downvotes for asking an honest question , but only got 6 downvotes for saying that hitler would n't have liked minecraft because he is n't an autistic faggot . 
  downvotes do n't mean anything most of the time . 
  it 's best if you ignore them . 
  i guess what i 'm trying to say is : if you see blue arrows coming your way , do n't move and you wo n't get hurt by them . 
  holy shit , toriel had an affair and child with chairgore ? 
  when i was a lad i ate four dozen eggs, 
  i totally did expect that , though . 
  i thought the voice before that implies you 're gon na go to the `` finale '' now , and you still need to be at the asgore fight for that . 
  i would have loved to see the job interview . 
  arin : `` so ... do you like videogames ? '', 
  this is better than expected . 
  well , he should switch off the `` evil voice '' whenever flowey has a cute face , in my opinion . 
  ** for you **, 
  it 's to get across a confused tone over the internet . 
  imagine the pitch of his/her voise rising near the end of the sentence . 
  why ? 
  hmmm , it 's a squirrel and a turtle ... squirtle ? 
  it was n't * that * bad . 
  ... fewer . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ set ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ me ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ up ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ? 
  ooooh , did you think of `` homer '' , as in , illiad and odyssey ? 
  did the translator 's notes seriously have to explain that `` yes we can '' is an obama slogan ? 
  are they just going to explain every joke , even stuff without a language barrier between it ? 
  but that 's exactly how the games came out . 
  1 , 2 and then ae . 
  just because it is n't the chronological order does n't mean it is n't supposed to be played that way . 
  in fact , ae spoils quite a bit for 2 . 
  ooooh , that one 's a good point . 
  i second that then . 
  do n't read the gold files until the ending . 
  ( even though i did , but i guess i already knew because the twist is revealed in the tenmyouji route , is n't it ? ), 
  as for an even bigger twist that 's very close to the end : there 's one gold file that sort of spoils it if you think about it . 
  [ virtue 's last reward giant ending spoiler ] ( #s `` the file about knox 's 10 commandments spoils the identity of zero . '' ), 
  i believe in the theory that the skeleton you date in undertale is actually sans . 
  i mean , he takes you out to eat twice !, 
  samuel l. jackson as seven . 
  johnny yong bosch as everyone else . 
  but who even says that . 
  the answer is `` no , except if we are 100 % sure that it has to be done to prevent even more innocents from dying , and even then it 's just a maybe '' . 
  huh . 
  think about what happens to them after the fight against each of them . 
  i think there 's another character connection there , huh ? 
  i wonder if he 's named after the surrealist anime . 
  it does n't stand for `` ever '' . 
  i wish i could appreciate this comment because it really looks like you just made up a word and everyone justbwent along with it . 
  was n't it hot torchman ? 
  but play the game first !, 
  but how is it almost the same song ? 
  you can sing any lyrics over any song if you match the speed and then say it 's almost the same song . 
  just kidding . 
  it refused . 
  maybe it 's a very trendy expression in the undertale universe . 
  beware of the man who eats five dozen eggs . 
  reminds me of [ russian plumber hugh laurie ] ( http://i.imgur.com/enh7hoh.jpg ) . 
  it 's considered to be one of the top 3 ace attorney games , if not * the * best . 
  the only thing that 's missing is danny actually eating the paper . 
  my top 3 animes :, 
  * steins ; gate, 
  * breaking bad, 
  * gta : vice city, 
  i-is this comment part of the joke too ? 
  in german dubs , every sassy fat lady has the same voice . 
  who the fuck is stan, 
  what do you mean `` if '' ? 
  it * is * simple . 
  you move a box around !, 
  if the audio track is somehow slower than the video , you drag the end of the box . 
  happy birthday , kevin !, 
  you can eat him without repercussions , ca n't you ? 
  i thought it belonged to a human ? 
  frisk should wait for a monster to die , take its soul , go outside and then somehow make it so deathrow inmates get thrown down the hole on mt. 
  can you explain the foreboden and yeehaw meme ? 
  what about the ending where [ flowey does n't kill asgore , as he promised , but asgore commits suicide ?

  the site tvtropes has a trope called ** `` the dev team thinks of everything '' ** .
