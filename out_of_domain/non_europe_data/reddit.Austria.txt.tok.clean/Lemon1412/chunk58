  did you just trick me into upvoting you ? 
  great story . 
  here 's a video of it happening naturally like it could have happened to anyone else . 
  are you going to make another comment explaining why the contents of that video are impossible ? 
  * literally two seconds later *, 
  * ring ring *, 
  hello , this is toriel !, 
  what is everyone talking about today ? 
  the gamefaqs poll ? 
  why does anyone care ? 
  `` if food gives us energy , then so should phones ! '', 
  but that implies that phones give people energy , not that food gives phones energy !, 
  ... so was he . 
  this * really * reminded me of [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/ssb6tb7klve?t=18 ) spongebob scene . 
  oh my god . 
  it even has a watermark . 
  why put the punchline in the comment ? 
  i always pictured it to be mettaton ex 's face . 
  but this makes more sense . 
  yeah , if you sort it by top . 
  you can also sort it by hot , though . 
  something that got 1000 points in 20 hours is further down than something that got 500 in 5 hours . 
  do n't you sort of see something happening on the screen when you save , though ? 
  what about a spinny thing around the mouse cursor or a tiny loading bar in one corner ? 
  surely you 'd notice movement , even if it 's just in your peripheral vision . 
  way to be dramatic !, 
  why are you getting so much more karma for pointing out the joke than the guy making the joke ? 
  nooooo that 's not what he meant !, 
  this game is ... not really shorter . 
  hour-wise , i mean . 
  and in danganronpa , you can at least skip the free-time events . 
  not sure how much you can skip here . 
  does this cost extra ? 
  why would he set her up for that punchline after he just made a joke just like that ? 
  i 'm not saying it 's unrealistic or anything . 
  i 'm just pointing out how dumb the husband is . 
  dude , he merely explained why someone would complain about that one line , but not about the rabbi priest thing . 
  and he never said anyone else has to have his opinion , he just used his own opinion as an example to show that there is a difference . 
  nobody complained about the parent comment * asking * a question , but he 's `` bitching '' because he answers it and shows the difference between those kinds of joke ? 
  what do you think the comment section is for ? 
  fucking pun threads ? 
  could you explain the last two things you said in detail ? 
  what did they do in the remake about that ? 
  ( and what was missing in the original ? ), 
  oh , it 's cool that they actually fixed that . 
  did n't expect that from them . 
  von karma saved every case !, 
  [ 1-4 ] ( #s `` without dl-6 , phoenix never would have been able to solve any case because he would n't have been an attorney !! '' ), 
  or , hey , maybe we could even say that the person who * actually * saved every case is [ gyakuten kenji 2 spoilers ] ( #s `` dane cook . 
  wait , that was n't his name . 
  dane bake ? 
  many parts of it are not enjoyable because the characters just act so stupid . 
  most of the time you 're just yelling `` why do n't you just shoot him ?!, 
  maybe he just wanted you to reply with a joke story of your worst day . 
  this is the most important comment of the thread . 
  it does . 
  just had it . 
  how the hell did `` prestige gave 10 times as much as it should have '' now get changed to `` prestige gives 100 times as much as it should '' ? 
  what happened ? 
  that was everyone 's biggest gripe with the last update , so now it 's 10 times as big . 
  it 's definitely a bug , but fixing it should n't be that hard , right ? 
  i hope orteil does it quickly this time , preferrably before i ascend for the first time . 
  fishing is the comfiest shit ever . 
  ever since i learned how fishing works , i do it all the time and one of my first things to do on a new world is to make a great expedition to find the angler . 
  i love terraria because of all the hectic shit going on , the eldritch abominations , the battles and the fast paces action , but all the calm stuff like fishing and alchemy ( which i have never done , but i 'm gon na try that out today ) is so great too . 
  yup , i got really intimidated reading them . 
  remember , / u/daft _ inquisitor , if you 're a guy , you have to understand if people see you as a potential rapist . 
  edit : let me guess , downvoters : you 're white males . 
  that 's easy for a cisgender to say . 
  it 's like telling africans to stop being hungry !, 
  i 'm done talking to you . 
  i love the part at 0:47 because it just shows how many friends they have on their side . 
  what ? 
  no , it 's not podracing . 
  that was on tatooine . 
  you 're in a spaceship now -, 
  ^ ^ oh ^ ^ he 's ^ ^ doing ^ ^ like ^ ^ a ^ ^ thing, 
  what if it refers to a bunch of tom cruises ? 
  those hips, 
  filler ? 
  it 's just an episodic case-of-the-week anime with an overarching plot to frame it . 
  i played portal years ago when it was new , and i never had that `` omg my mind is blown '' reaction . 
  now i 'm kinda jealous !, 
  was n't there another guy who wrote a titanic story who actually died on it years later ? 
  they say that the dying guy communicated with his past self through morphogenic fields to write the book or something . 
  it 's always that one . 
  different example then . 
  the s at the end of aids is a soft s. it 's voiced . 
  the word `` syndrome '' that it stands for starts with a sharper , unvoiced s. 
  it 's still retarded because how the hell did he read 4/20 , then ? 
  how the shit even . 
  `` show i care '' ? 
  who said that ? 
  `` take pity '' means `` to feel sorry for someone '' . 
  the person who made the photo explicitely said that they found it sad , meaning they feel sorry for the blonde girl in the photo . 
  nice strawman , though . 
  the caption said `` it 's always sad '' , meaning they took pity . 
  obviously , they did n't * actually * take pity , since they were just joking , but who is to say the buzzfeed people did n't play along with the joke with their headline ? 
  i do agree with you on the fact that buzzfeed did n't get the joke , though . 
  it 's just not the word choice of `` taking pity '' that tells me they did n't get it , it 's the fact that they say `` this woman '' , even though they ca n't possibly know who is behind the camera .
