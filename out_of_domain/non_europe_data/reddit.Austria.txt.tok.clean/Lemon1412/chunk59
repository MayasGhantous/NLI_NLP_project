  ( although , maybe they saw the original uploader 's username or profile picture or something ? 
  not sure how that works . ), 
  what you just said makes no sense . 
  `` everyone who is anonymous should use informal fallacies in every argument to win , simply because they ca n't get caught for it . '', 
  ... wow , making strawman arguments * is * kinda fun !, 
  you 'll never find out my address , though . 
  but that 's literally what he said in the episode . 
  he 's not saying the anime spoils the second game . 
  he is saying if gamerexq uses the wiki now he can still stumble upon spoilers to the second game , despite having seen the anime . 
  ( which only covers the first game . ), 
  this is just hinting at a port of the remake , but there * is * a really good sequel . 
  you only have to kill the one with the scalpel . 
   do n't ever forfeit in the first minute , there is always a chance . 
  man , i 'm too optimistic about that . 
  whenever there are 3 minutes left and my opponent already scored 6 goals , i think , `` hey , that means i got enough time to score 9 !, 
  i was gon na say the way you think is shitty , but it is kinda true most of the time . 
  there is `` not hitting the ball '' or `` missing the goal '' and there is `` making a * decision * that nobody in their right mind would make '' . 
  like those guys who just chase after the ball and want to shoot it , no matter what the situation . 
  like , fuck teammates , right ? 
  at least i get to touch the ball . 
  my mate is setting up a goal ? 
  welp , i 'm also following the ball because why be ready to take the shot ? 
  the ball is in front of the enemies goal and i 'm coming from the side ? 
  let my teammate score ? 
  * naaaah * , i 'll knock it out of the way because i want to always be at the ball . 
  so yeah , if you got a person like that in your team and you notice within 30 seconds , you would sort of have to `` make up for it '' , since they wo n't suddenly change the way they think about the game within the next 270 seconds . 
  makes you wonder who is training who . 
  just a simple white page that says `` sacrifical rolling pins '' . 
  you 're right . 
  the * booty * is where it 's at . 
  `` son ... why is she having sex with him while he 's in wolf form ? '', 
  `` yyyyyeeeeah , i forgot about this scene . '', 
  nobody said ** death note ** yet ? 
  it has pretty much no fanservice , a great dub , and is interesting to watch and think/talk about . 
  ( i wonder who your mom would be rooting for . ), 
  it does have 37 episodes , though , so that 's a bit longer than you would want . 
  also , there are not many female characters in the anime . 
  the ones that are in the anime are pretty strong , though . 
  yes , it is literally impossible . 
  there is no way to just click like ten golden cookies a day and then have it in two years . 
  paul star war cop, 
  fffffuck . 
  that 's better . 
  glad they checked the monster kid . 
  yeah , but not in hotlands . 
  he does n't need to , because alphys evacuated and did n't bother reactivating the puzzles . 
  `` why does n't he have freckles ? '', 
   really do n't think there 's much point in your defending this media type to me ; i 'm afraid this is one thing upon which i will not be swayed . 
  which , you have to be honest here , can be summarized with `` i ca n't hear you !, 
  the first two lines you wrote are just opinions stated as facts . 
  i do n't get the point this video is trying to make . 
  very positive does n't mean `` no negative reviews '' . 
  you download the episodes in 1080p . 
  no streaming !, 
  agreed , but that 's oddly specific , is n't it ? 
  i think that was 2-2 and the grey clinic . 
  pal meraktis was a guy from 4-2 . 
  there is a sub-forum on court-records . net called `` gourdzilla 's lair '' . 
  is that what you thought of ? 
  but why is * that * called that ? 
  why would that surprise you ? 
  it 's supposed to show you that it 's a tongue twister that you can put cat sounds into . 
  how would that work with what you just said ? 
  this is how they do it most of the time . 
  just say `` our language '' without mentioning the language . 
  when they say something like `` german '' in the german translation , it weirds me out . 
  everyone knows they 're actually speaking english , we 're just hearing it through a babel fish . 
  the ultimate luck ? 
  more like ultimate ffffffffffffffffffffffffff [ ] ( / s `` uck '' ) . 
  it bag of artorney . 
  is it like the color blind thing because some people ca n't recognize notes or something ? 
  does n't this sort of ruin the puzzle for people who can ? 
  tree solution ? 
  but is n't that the minority ? 
  the people who * are n't * deaf or tone deaf just want to have a satisfying little puzzle but get it ruined , you know ? 
  i ca n't think of a solution to this dilemma that would n't add too much to the game , though . 
  ( except , maybe , a question when you start up the game asking you if you 're ( tone ) deaf , but that 's dumb too . ), 
  it 's still cool that toby actually takes this into consideration , though . 
  some say that , but those people did not read oddcharm 's comment , then . 
  in the sentence `` some say he still wears them to this day '' , what does `` them '' refer to , if not the flip flops from oddcharm 's comment ? 
  how does `` neuf '' even sound remotely like `` nuts '' ? 
  tails pointheart . 
  the heart of miles . 
  prower of love . 
  what the fuck is it help, 
  because some people just like seeing other people 's reactions to things . 
  that is just how it is . 
  these videos are made for the people who enjoy them , which a lot of people do . 
  with opinions , taste and whatnot , there is no point in asking `` why '' . 
  think of it as inviting a friend to watch fight club because he has never seen it , just to see his reaction . 
  it 's pretty normal . 
  also , your comment basically says `` look at me , i dont like this !, 
  why do people like watching reactions ? '' . 
  well , it 's cool that that 's your ( and many others ' ) opinion . 
  but i might as well ask `` why would i want to read your opinion on things ? 
  all i care about is my opinion '' . 
  it 's just objectively better because with spoiler tags everyone can come in here and with none only people who do n't care or have seen everything can . 
  you should n't do either . 
  great strawman , though . 
  ooooooh,
