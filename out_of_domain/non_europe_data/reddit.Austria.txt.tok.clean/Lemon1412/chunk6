  it 's just like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/je1th.jpg ) comic . 
  i read this in heavy 's voice . 
  never call someone who swallows a bitch, 
  ... but that 's the only thing that was wrong with his post ? 
  actually , i found the last five or so episodes much better than the rest of the second `` season '' . 
  i think he was being sarcastic . 
  i hope . 
  why the hell would anyone say that in bed . 
  i am john candy and -- ooh , a piece of wood !, 
  reddit linked to content on another site ? 
  three days is not old . 
  it 's also not old to the people who have n't seen it yet . 
  i read this as `` boot to the head '' . 
  the comments under yours were very confusing . 
  hypothetical , this comes up when you google `` family dinner '' . 
  when you build it , he will come ... 
  [ even works with igoogle !, 
  because his comment added nothing to the discussion , which is a legitimate reason to downvote . 
  so because we * can * downvote , we also * do * it . 
  and final fantasy was one of the things i did n't know . 
  what . 
  exile starts with an `` e '' and the x kind of stands for the `` target '' . 
  as in `` the x marks the spot '' . 
  wait a minute , i just noticed : * 4chan is a pun on fortune ?!, 
  * that explains the logo of the site !, 
  how do you know his real name ? 
  actually , even the opposite was implied . 
  she * successfully * did the wardrobe change . 
  because she 's the type of person that would do something like that , she caused an accident . 
  this is the best picture of jesus christ ever drawn . 
  * everywhere you look *, 
  why would a five year old kid have a son ? 
  would n't you lose a bucket though ? 
  ooh , very nice . 
  what server is this ? 
  oh yeah , i forgot that crafting actually creates a new bucket with the eggnog . 
  yes you can , but you ca n't say `` mein ' kraft '' . 
  `` mein '' is already a word . 
  you ca n't shorten a word if it becomes another word that would cause a grammatical or logical error in your sentence . 
  the time has never really made me nervous in this game . 
  the inverted song of time helps a lot , i guess . 
  there is a `` the '' right before `` mojang cape '' , in case you have n't noticed . 
  unless you 're a troll . 
  man , this internet thing is confusing !, 
  edit : actually , the only `` the '' with a capitalized t is in the beginning of the tweet . 
  so i guess that this guy is actually right . 
  yeah , and then it turns out that minecraft was actually some truman show shit and that the player has been trapped in a cavern the entire time !, 
  turn 360 degrees again . 
  i 've never heard that name either . 
  why is it called snoo ? 
  does it mean anything ? 
  which means that they needed op rights . 
  and who was the only one who was able to give them the rights ... ? 
  i 'm not one of the downvoters , but maybe they downvoted because you did n't say why you do n't like it . 
  hey , it 's * you * !, 
  only people who pronounce bach horribly wrong get that joke . 
  don juan . 
  the jennifer lopez thing was a south park reference , sorry . 
  edit : okay , apparently , `` don juan '' is pronounced differently depending on your language . 
  let 's just say that the `` j '' in `` don juan '' as the * german * people say it sounds like the `` ch '' in pretty much every german word . 
  the `` ch '' in those three words sounds the same . 
  also , `` bach '' is a german word and arnold 's first language is german , so why would he pronounce that wrong ? 
  [ here 's a link where you can find the pronunciation . 
  i think that old_peculier would have `` led '' them to the secret passageway if they had n't found it . 
  very interesting . 
  maybe that 's what the producers wanted the player to do !, 
  from the faq :, 
  i 've heard this on several occasions and this one pisses me off a little . 
  i 'm not going to pretend to be a master level designer , but comments like this are ignorent to what is actually ` good level design . 
  while games like knytt ( not to diss it , the games are fantastic ) are hailed for excellent level design , the design is almost entirely graphical and have no significient impact on game play . 
  a screen can be made in a matter of minutes if it does n't contain any unique entities . 
  the majority of them also likely only take a few moments of testing . 
  i on the other hand have to come up with something new and surprising on basically every screen . 
  half the screens have unique events and situations programmed expressly for them . 
  each level has to be play tested over and over again to find a balance in difficulty and avoid easy exploits . 
  i must keep the game difficult , but balanced . 
  i must keep the player on their toes and yet still have to surprise them when they 're most alert . 
  if i randomly kill the player to much he loses interest . 
  if i 'm too kind he grows weak and loses his fearfulness . 
  i 'd say i do a pretty damn good job of this and i work my ass off to make every screen interesting . 
  try to beat the game . 
  you 'll feel a lot better . 
  and you can brag about it . 
  the bosses are actually controlled by people , you know . 
  just like the `` npcs '' . 
  edit : oh , and they 're playing on a private server , but people in their hamachi network joined and fucked things up . 
  ( i.e. , made everything interesting . ), 
  the reactions are real , because they did n't expect the things they saw . 
  however , i think that they did expect * something * . 
  they probably left the server running and told their friends to mess around . 
  did you notice how lewis , the person who is filming , set the render distance to low in part 6 ? 
  maybe that 's because someone else was on the server , and he did n't want to show us . 
  oh my god , new annotation in the video . 
  ( at least it was n't there when i saw it ), 
  but i do n't want it to end !, 
  edit : wait , if they are acknowledging part 27 as a finale , does that mean that they really planned it to be over after the ` story ' ends ? 
  maybe that means that this was staged , and simon and lewis were part of it . 
  the view count froze , and even if it did n't : look at the annotation in * your * picture . 
  well , i know * that * , but why do they want to end it at this point ? 
  what about the ceiling of the yogtower ?
