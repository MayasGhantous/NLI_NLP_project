  you 're doing , like , a thing, 
  it 's not new . 
  they are just creating new versions for when it 's relevant as a reaction image . 
  yup , the people who took half a second out of your life to downvote you and leave totally `` lost their minds '' . 
  unlike you , with your exaggerated edit . 
  but what about that engrish reason they just talked about, 
  my first 30 hours in rocket league summed up . 
  in the german dub , the dialogue goes like this :, 
  `` well , as they say , one hand washes the other . '', 
  `` well , the question is , jules : who is going to wash my noodle ? '', 
  what the hell do you guys think `` meta '' means ?!, 
  it 's a reference to a meme !, 
  because the correct thing to say would be 32 pressure ? 
  or the next zero escape game . 
  i am about to get gold i in solo duels , but it 's frustrating as fuck . 
  i was up at 695 points yesterday , but then kept losing and i kept going from 630 to 680 and back to 630 . 
  it 's not even super unfair . 
  i just keep fucking up . 
  good thing i can take my time , i guess !, 
  good news !, 
  i finally made it !, 
  i sorta cheated by only playing against americans ( because for whatever reason europeans are 10 times better in my experience ) , but that last match was intense as fuck . 
  i scored a goal to get into overtime in the last ten seconds , and then overtime took another 2-3 minutes . 
  the responses . 
  naegi was just called `` ultimate lucky student '' because he was randomly drawn to get into the school , like someone does every year . 
  nagito ** is ** the ultimate lucky student , which is the * reason * he got into the school . 
  i just had two more between this comment and the op . 
  then what the fuck is the problem, 
  yeah , but you 'll still get a silver crown as long as you have one playlist where you have silver, 
  gold is more satisfying . 
  neither , because it 's spelled `` definitely '' . 
  did you just respond to a 2-months-old post to correct their grammar ? 
  i corrected their ** spelling ** , and you 're responding to yourself so what do you fucking know ? 
  all the people who upvoted it care . 
  i care . 
  i find it super interesting . 
  what do you think your downvote button is for ? 
  do you hate the fact that so many people find something interesting that you do n't ? 
  i would also really like a world that consist of people who are interested in the same stuff as me and a democracy where everyone votes for the same stuff as me , but i think demanding that is a bit unrealistic , so i shut the fuck up about it . 
  i think i wanted to reply to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/44j1jl/if_you_had_to_pick_a_talent_from_dr1_and_dr2/czqshw1 ) comment . 
  what a save !, 
  hear me out , guys . 
  they should have a rank called `` meme elite '' . 
  do you use the phone app ? 
  such a fucking kick-ass line . 
  in the rocket labs maps , the texture of the walls ( the little hexagons ) are a layer `` above '' the players ' nameplates . 
   apparently people on reddit are too cool just to inform others, 
  they are just playing along with the joke . 
  nobody here thinks they are cool . 
   edit : oh , i get it . 
  i do n't get it , though . 
  could you explain for the unsmarter ones ? 
  you can call it obvious all you want , that 's subjective and all , but it is * not * `` explicit '' in any way . 
  well , people who visit / r/jokes usually have a humor preference , while people who visit / r/funny do not . 
  i do n't really get it . 
  why ca n't you do that in imperial ? 
  are n't the actors related ? 
  and also he existed for like 20 minutes worth of reading . 
  from the german dub :, 
  light : `` wow , ryuzaki !, 
  i did n't know you could fly a helicopter ! '', 
  l : `` me neither . '', 
  is n't that an awful lot of time/work ? 
  getting back to the military base , stealing a jet and then flying back to ( let 's say ) the city is much more effort than just shooting the fucker a few times . 
  he did n't know what kind of tequila it was . 
  he even called it `` whatever she just said '' . 
  that would be valid if the conversation was n't `` i did n't expect bart 's cock in the simpsons movie . '', 
  - `` explain . '', 
  - `` they show his dick . '', 
  yeah , but you do n't see slj getting sucked off . 
  the dick is the nail and she 's the hammer ? 
  he means because you literally bumped into him . 
  yup , it 's in there . 
  it was also in the anime hyouka a lot . 
  this guy probably does n't watch the show but made this video to entertain people . 
  it worked for me . 
  why not just not watch the video ? 
  so it is . 
  it 's meant to be read between 1 and 2 . 
  it sets some plot points up for 2 , and explains ( and spoils ) 1 . 
  that 's why it makes sense to me to celebrate it on march 1st . 
  another way to say it is that the birthday is `` one day after the 28th '' , which is always true . 
  on leap years , you celebrate it on the 29th , otherwise march 1st . 
  saying `` i celebrate it on the 28th because it 's one day before march 1st '' is not always true , because it 's not a day before march 1st during leap years . 
  there are so many great shows that have a german dub . 
  death note , code geass , gurren lagann , space dandy , a lot of really recent stuff , actually . 
  not saying the dubs are anywhere near the quality of the original or english dubs , but if he only watches german dubs then he probably does n't care about quality anyway . 
  why not just download stuff that you wan na show him ? 
  does it have to be netflix ? 
  which is why you celebrate on the 29th on leap years . 
  because that * is * your birthday , after all . 
  let 's say it like this : everyone with the birthday feb 29th will celebrate on feb 29th during leap years . 
  during other years , some people celebrate on march 1st , some do on february 28th . 
  the former * always * celebrate the day after the 28th . 
  the latter * do not * always celebrate the day before march 1st . 
  edit : yeah they do . 
  what the fuck am i talking about, 
  michael c. hall or whatever ? 
  i think he means the other one . 
  the flamboyant one .
