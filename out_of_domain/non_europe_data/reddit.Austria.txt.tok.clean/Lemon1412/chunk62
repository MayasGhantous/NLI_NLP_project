  if you 're already gon na be illegal about it , at least download the episode in good quality . 
  becoming a defense attorney or a prosecutor is a long-ish process , so you ca n't just be a defense attorney in one case and choose to be a prosecutor in the next , if that 's what you mean . 
  it 's a fixed job , not just a role . 
  prosecutors work for the state , and defense attorneys have their own private firms . 
  shown what ? 
  what he did there was pretty illegal . 
  do n't you have to pay to watch anime on crunchyroll ? 
  you talked about `` premium '' . 
  did you really think a free alternative would be legal ? 
  should be fixed next week ? 
  great !, 
  where did you hear that from ? 
  if a guy loses the keys to his house in a movie , and 20 minutes later he enters his house , would he say `` how is it possible to enter one 's house without the keys ? '' ? 
  and if somebody says `` yeah , well , in the book they mention that it 's his spare keys '' , would you really say that the possibility does n't exist in the movie , just because it was n't explicitly stated ? 
  the movie was fucking awesome . 
  [ this looks gigantic to you ? 
  gumshoe has a way bigger and shinier one . 
  that 's seriously the best argument i 've heard for either side so far . 
  that one makes no sense . 
  acronyms are pronounced like they are spelled , not like whatever the first sound in the words every letter stands for is . 
  you can argue that he has no say in that , in the `` death of the author '' sense . 
  wow !, 
  i thought this would devolve into a patrick bateman monologue . 
  when does pat mention this ? 
  oh , i thought that when he said `` that looks much more elegant '' he meant the wii version compared to the gc version or something . 
  the pause after they asked `` is it the ghost guy ? '', 
  and him asking `` what ghost guy ? '', 
  sorta made me think the same thing . 
  ca n't get around spoilers , even in unrelated threads , huh ? 
  it 's not `` throwing a curve ball '' . 
  it 's like if the pitcher yelled `` okay , next one 's gon na be a curveball '' and then throws a curveball . 
  that does n't count of you see the username first and then make a fitting comment . 
  the `` funniest joke in the world '' . 
  long is not an absolute term . 
  i did n't know hitler was an autistic faggot . 
  the guy spells `` 80s '' with an apostrophe like it 's a possessive !, 
  point your fingers and laugh !, 
  4 , right ? 
  in episode 12 , the jail cell is empty and satoru is back . 
  edit : this is not even true . 
  i dropped ** btooom !!, 
  ** as soon as i saw the first episode and gave it a two . 
  it was just a ridiculous level of stupid . 
  ( i ended up finishing it years later and now it still has a 2 , although it had a 4 somewhere in the middle . ), 
  the main character was just so dumb . 
  he was addicted to a game where you bomb other people with little silver cube-shaped bombs . 
  the then gets abducted in real life and finds silver cubes with a button and a display in a bag . 
  he asks himself `` what the heck is that ? '', 
  he pressed the button and a timer starts counting down from ten . 
  he says `` hmm , what is this number ? 
  i guess i 'll just throw it '' . 
  he throws it and it explodes . 
  he is then surprised about it . 
  later , another guy tries to kill him , and he presses the button , throws it immediately after pressing , and it flies past the guy 's head , and down a cliff and into the water . 
  the mc says `` huh ?!, 
  why did n't it explode just then ? 
  '' , then it explodes a few seconds later ( when the timer hit zero ) and he was surprised about the explosion . 
  ( ask yourself : how did he think the bomb worked ? 
  even if you ignore that he can not comprehend the concept of a timer , let 's not forget that the bomb did n't hit anything near the enemy , so why would it explode when it flew past him ? 
  did he think the bomb * knew * it was near an enemy somehow ? ), 
  and then a few minutes later he figures out the bomb is on a timer and beats the bad guy , because the bad guy screamed out his inner monologue , giving away his plan . 
  i 'm guessing skyler is in that one ? 
  do n't you wan na correct the other mistakes be made on purpose ? 
  someone tells a story where they barely avoid getting caught having sex . 
  top response is always a guy who knows nothing about the situation except for what the comment said , saying ** `` she knew '' ** . 
  yeah , both . 
  this is very unsettling . 
  yeah , they did n't confirm it , did they ? 
  i thought the underscore was the sign of the sjws . 
  edit : holy shit , i do not * actually * think that a symbol that you put into your subreddit name shows the stance of the subreddit 's moderators . 
  so when you say hunter hunter , you put emphasis on the first word ? 
  this is still the funniest thing ever to me . 
   i would have made that person my enemy for life . 
  wtf , how is that even remotely something that can make anyone in the world even slightly upset ? 
  yes . 
  but hyperbole of what ? 
  this is n't even a situation where the emotion angry would fit . 
  if i say `` i heard a weird noise outside yesterday . 
  that made me so sad i wan na commit suicide '' , that 's not hyperbole . 
  it 's just * weird * . 
  that 's why i said `` how can it even make someone slightly upset ? '' . 
  would n't `` confused '' be the appropriate feeling for you humans ? 
  that 's not `` relevant '' , that 's context . 
  if you were hyperbolic , does that mean it would have actually only made you `` a bit angry '' ? 
  why is that ? 
  i will never be satisfied with anything . 
  hmmm ... please stop this . 
  football is ambiguous , soccer ball is not . 
  i know what i 'm doing the rest of my rocket league life . 
  i do n't get what you 're saying . 
  i read zero before 2 came out and nothing was spoiled . 
  i do n't get how the things you just mention relate to danganronpa 2 spoilers . 
  [ ] ( / s `` they only talk about some guy called izuru existing and him being the ultimate hope , nothing else . 
  and what neurologist ? 
  what about him is a spoiler ? '' ), 
  spoiler tags ? 
  you said that by his logic , it would be * impossible * to discuss something . 
  i showed you a way to discuss it anyway . 
  maybe you are misunderstanding me , though . 
  ( i mean , i only said two words so far . ),
