  for some reason you have to do that . 
  in the upper left of your timeline , there should be some symbols saying stuff like `` d team executed '' , and one of them may be greyed out . 
  edit : oh , you already tried that , i guess ? 
  is this really such a weird way to phrase it that you would interpret it that way ? 
  people say `` we '' all the time referring to humans in general . 
  what 's it like to be married to a raging alcoholic ? 
  wait , they have a fixed schedule ? 
  and people * wait * for that ? 
  like it 's a tv show or something ? 
  i do n't see it . 
  i also do n't see how this is tiny . 
  i need something for scale . 
  what an anime is is n't really that hard to grasp and it 's also not even relevant for the explanation other than `` it 's a tv show '' . 
  it could still turn out to be true despite the title of the anime , you know . 
  some parts of this video are reasonable reasons to think he 's alive , but a lot of the video is just `` but why would he do it if it would make his sister sad ? '', 
  and `` look at this fake clip of lelouch being the cart driver ! '' . 
  even the good parts that he calls `` proof '' are n't even proof . 
  now i do n't remember the anime exactly since it 's been some time , but do we ever get a confirmation that killing someone with a code makes you immortal ? 
  and do we know that what lelouch did to charles even counts as killing ? 
  i thought hashtags were sort of like groups ? 
  then again , i have no idea how twitter works . 
  they are like the razzies still means it 's the nobel prize for bad science . 
  and they `` are '' the razzies means they literally are the razzies , the award for the worst movie . 
  maybe it 's funny to him and his friends though ? 
  to me it was surprisingly not-hilarious . 
  i thought it would be funny because sex jokes , but it turns out that most of the jokes were just `` look , this girl just said something dirty even though it 's an innocent looking girl in a cute looking anime '' . 
  one of the `` jokes '' was just a girl saying something along the lines of : `` we all have to try something different every once in a while . 
  for example , i tried anal masturbation and i love it now ! '' . 
  the shock humor or whatever you wan na call it works when you do n't know what you 're getting into . 
  it 's like `` holy shit haha what is this '' at first , but even that feeling will fade away after ten minutes . 
  does it get better after episode 1 ? 
  i 've only seen the first one . 
  is it just me or is that smartphone doing curls wrong ? 
  why is it bending its back like that ? 
  oh shit i thought he meant `` been to many planets '' for some reason . 
  that made absolutely no sense . 
  that dumb fucking scene in butterfly effect where the jesus marks just appeared on his dumb hands was so dumb for this exact reason . 
  a flip is a flip . 
  you ca n't say it 's only half . 
  yeah and apparently only the usa will survive somehow . 
  the answer is * in the comment * you read . 
  he said he has dave the barbarian to thank for reminding him yada yada . 
  do you think that 's just a random person he mentioned completely unrelated to this whole thread or could he be talking about the dave in op 's picture , who is called * dave * in the subtitles of the picture ? 
  and if you wan na say `` well , how was i supposed to know that it 's the name of the show and not just the character ? 
  '' , * that 's * where google would have come into play . 
  or the context clue where someone posted a link to the wikipedia page of the show five hours before he complained about nobody mentioning the name of the show . 
  or the context clue where the second oldest comment in the thread mentions characters called `` dave '' and `` fang '' being `` barbarians '' , which is unusual enough to google . 
  have you seen [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fozd4sfgag ) ? 
  i mean , you probably have . 
   what does killing have to do with it, 
  cuz its about killing, 
  maybe harmony gets interrupted by killing . 
  maybe they are killing in harmonious ways . 
  maybe there is a double meaning or something we can only understand after playing the game, 
  yes , he means a character from the legend of salami : cheese of time . 
   he started yelling `` lies '' when vdb started citing him . 
  video ? 
   just look on youtube for `` hofer vs van der bellen '' . 
  i did n't find anything in english . 
  i 'm austrian but i found it now !, 
   most of people in the fandom not knowing who monaca is after her introduction in dr3 ? 
  is this * actually * true ? 
  how can they even call themselves `` fans '' then ? 
  you 'd think they would have at least heart of monaca . 
  is it so hard to pronounce a word that we have heard 100 times when booting up the game or in the soundtrack ? 
  and how the hell is it a long word ? 
  the point is that the guy simply left out a letter . 
  which accent he uses or how exactly he pronounces it does n't matter , but he skipped a letter . 
  not being able to say the `` mae '' in komaeda ( mentioned in the other comment ) is one thing , but pronouncing `` ron '' as `` row '' ? 
  did you know that the mustaches and the trees in that movie are the same texture , but just palette-swapped ? 
  it 's to save space . 
  dumbass . 
  wait , why are there so many votes on this ? 
  i love reddit but getting this mad over a fucking comment ... . i mean ... . really ? 
  if you think it 's bait then why do you keep responding in an angry fashion, 
  oh , i did n't even interpret it that way . 
  pfenix kills edward, 
  but does n't tony only use his fists ? 
  how is it bad ? 
  the video is n't saying that all school shooters make finger guns . 
  it 's saying that everyone who makes fingerguns is a school shooter . 
  ( which is not true either , but still a big difference . ), 
  it 's never too late to experience it yourself before you watch the grumps play it !, 
  wait ... 
  ** it 's not a beard ?!?!, 
  she punched jon and made him leave . 
  did these `` jimmy fallon is actually not fake and a super awesome and positive guy '' comments start today or has this been going for a while ? 
  i swear i saw a comment like this today already in the thread about the nintendo switch and i 'd never seen something like it before . 
  by that logic , should n't i also downvote your comment ? 
  the terminator . 
  timotei is known in english speaking countries . 
  * they look amazing, 
  do n't assume it 's a he . 
  not sarcasm . 
  a   joke < < . 
  why is everyone saying this ? 
  the reason they have n't made `` progress '' is because the episodes are so short . 
  speed-wise , they 're doing alright . 
  they did the prologue , the first fight , they read what everyone has to say , they explored the town , used the inn , did some shopping , had the gus encounter , and whatever else they did . 
  they were as fast as a first-timer should be .
