  and curiosity . 
  yes , and a cartoon is * something * , and when you want to talk about * something * , you do it using the pronouns in your language . 
  i think it 's pretty normal to look up the correct way to say things when you 're not sure . 
  yeah , i knew you would say that people should just say `` they '' . 
  in your example , you say they because you ca n't know what the person 's gender is . 
  the reason you do n't ask `` what is the person 's gender ? 
  i need it for pronounial reasons . '', 
  is because you probably do n't think that you will keep talking about this person . 
  here , it 's a gorilla that you can * see * and * hear * , with a specific personality , from a pretty old movie that is often talked about . 
  it would be so freaking weird to constantly talk about her using the word `` they '' to people who have also seen the movie . 
   but it is n't always necessary . 
  it 's * never * necessary . 
  no piece of information is * necessary * as long as you do n't need it to survive . 
  `` is that gorilla a he or she ? '', 
  is a tiny question that could be answered with one word , but instead people get hung up on whether it 's necessary to know or not ? 
  is n't it strange that people who say that `` something does n't matter '' get in in-depth discussion about it not mattering , even though whether it matters or not does n't matter either ? 
  he 's never even tried it . 
  five hours ? 
  how many worlds did you have ? 
  forgot you could do that . 
  so why can he be the one who started trash talking but his opponent ca n't ? 
  somebody had to have been first . 
  someone who has never heard of matilda and carrie would still be able to get that both are books about people with telekinesis and terrible parents . 
  i saw it in skam which is why i asked . 
  he even said `` what movie ? '', 
  afterwards . 
  when he first said the line , i knew i knew it from somewhere . 
  they reference pretty woman later in the episode and another commenter also suggested pretty woman , but i 've never seen that . 
  so where did i know if from ? 
  this might be where it is from originally , but i 've never seen that , so some other movie or show must have referenced it . 
  i think i know what you 're going to ask . 
  the answers are obviously `` guilty '' and `` only 12 minutes '' . 
  why does this have * so many well made subtitles ?!, 
  courtroom no . 
  4 , i believe ? 
  the one where one of the lights in the back does n't work . 
  you are unforgettable , unlike defense attorneys . 
  can anyone here even * name * one ? 
  they 're like bugs to me . 
  needless things . 
  to be crushed . 
  the \u00f6 sound is n't a sound you use in english but i guess the first sound in `` err '' as in `` to err is human '' sounds kinda like it if a british guy says it . 
  it does n't sound like guts . 
  if you think `` prosopagnosia '' is the only parallel , think about the similarities between the incinerator scene in the safe ending and the flashback scene he has with dhurke in 6-5 . 
  all other aa games have a good translation but aj has a terrible translation filled with typos . 
  ( there 's even a typo on a menu button that you use a lot ), 
  it 's that dick soft coded in ? 
  wait , how is it savagery ? 
  but the lesbians line is only in the movie . 
  yes , i 'm talking about german . 
  there are some really jarring typos . 
  especially `` aufh\u00f6len '' on the stop button . 
  the english one is much better . 
  is `` not being rude '' instantly an interview with the president to you ? 
  interrupting people is fucking dickish . 
  do n't do it . 
  `` h3h3 is clearly going for its own style and i and many others are liking it . '', 
  yeah , but the same could be said of the exact opposite view , so what kind of argument is that ? 
  are you also one of those people who wants comments to be a hugbox ? 
  i really ca n't argue against that . 
  how do you go outside, 
  nah , / r/atheism is way worse . 
  it 's the zooming near the end . 
  that 's ... the joke . 
  to me , what i liked about the atmosphere is the fact that he knows what 's going to happen , and he has to find out how it happens and how he can prevent it . 
  i do n't think i liked the fact that he went to the present again and then back to the past * again * , but i think one travel back in time was necessary for the story to be as intriguing as it was . 
  i do n't think it would have drawn me in without the time travel . 
  the fuck is a time machine gon na do ? 
  is he gon na tell his mom to eat veggies during pregnancy ? 
  people click accidentally or without thinking . 
  omg so close hahahahha < ahsahah thankjis foir the fuzcking worning, 
  literally no point to those last two words there, 
  how does that tell him what the current year is ? 
  okay but what relevance to the release of dgs does the time of his accident have then ? 
  why does hearing when he fell into a coma cause him to say `` oh cool ca n't wait to play that game '' ? 
  should n't looking at the current date make him say that ? 
  why not, 
  that 's cute . 
  but that makes it all the more exciting . 
  oh my god, 
  country bumpkin , those are burns and lenny from above , and an explanation as to why lenny keeps coming into the shot from the right , when he exited left . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k-sbpelcwa ) a video with two seasoned veterans trying the same pepper . 
  that 's my favorite part . 
  what the nurse says does n't tell him how long he was in a coma for . 
  i 'm assuming someone named chili klaus knows that . 
  he probably cleaned his hands off-camera or something ? 
  ( or maybe they did show it and i just forgot . ), 
  but the same applies if he meant his hot scandinavian cousins , does n't it ? 
  did you actually think he found your comment to be the * most profound comment he 's ever read * ? 
  in the same way clenching your teeth and groaning helps when you 're in pain , i guess . 
  i do n't see any euros connection there . 
  if you mean `` the final problem '' , that 's just the name of the sherlock holmes story in which moriarty appears . 
  but it says she does n't know he 's here . 
  how can that be interpreted any other way ? 
  is that movie considered bad ? 
  i ca n't read anything on the picture on mobile . 
  it says click the image above for a more readable version but that just redirects me to a different page . 
  i like to picture her hair as a really wide shit-eating grin . 
  yeah what a fucking rollercoaster that was . 
  it was high and then went down once .
