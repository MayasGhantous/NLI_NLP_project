  i keep doing that too . 
  probably because people write `` ea '' a lot more than `` ae '' . 
  where is that `` oomba oomba doomba doomba '' thing that simon keeps singing from ? 
  is it from some elvis song ? 
  god damnit , pierce !, 
  i think . 
  because only people in the usa can watch it . 
  it 's funny because i can hear the guy 's voice in my head when i read it . 
  yeah , it 's a pretty stupid reason to downvote something . 
  that 's not how abortions work . 
  the ... downvote arrow ? 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv5lqqf-xme#t=1m30s ) . 
  when you go to the toilet , * where does yoghurt come out * ? 
  did you finally stop beating your children ? 
  i read that comment , thought it was unoriginal , realized that the grammar was correct and then i saw your username . 
  i am very slow . 
  either touhou or anything by the guy who composes mega man music . 
  ( also did it for ace attorney and ghost trick . ), 
  i think he means that there 's a tunnel every every third block ? 
  how do you save a comment ? 
  ( or did you save every single thread ? ), 
  thank 's a bunch !, 
  is there any way to explain how to pronounce the `` de '' to an english speaker ? 
  i know how it 's pronounced , i just ca n't explain it . 
  you 're right , that 's what it sounds like . 
  but watson is a surname , right ? 
  because upvoting is n't a word . 
  neither . 
  he did n't see a spider riding a skeleton , he saw a spider riding skeleton . 
  as in ** spider-riding ** skeleton . 
  pressing f1 in 3rd person mode does n't really work anymore for me . 
  just like you just dropped subtle hints without spoiler tags . 
  i do n't get it . 
  what does that the title have to do with the picture ? 
  [ is it because he gets shot in the face ? 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  because about half of the puzzles are completely different in japanese because they would n't make any sense with our letters , and that 's why they had to change most of them . 
  or so i heard . 
  speaking about noises , what is that weird squeaky noise i hear sometimes when people are walking ? 
  do their boots make those sounds or something ? 
  then who was phone ? 
  sorry , but that comes to my mind every time i read `` my dad is dead '' . 
  he said `` three times more dangerous '' , not `` three times as dangerous '' . 
  300 % more than 1 is 4 . 
  how is that an endless cycle ? 
  it 's not like he laughs even more because you started laughing . 
  yes . 
  see , greengoddess ? 
  there 's nothing to worry about . 
  it was actually you !, 
  the man who was in your room that night can confirm it !, 
  ** spoiler alert !, 
  op has n't watched it yet . 
  there are phoenix wright tracks in there , but not [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1jknzp0ic ) ? 
  and as far as i can remember , the light saber was blue . 
  yes , if you call `` not being put to sleep immediately and getting professional help '' a free pass . 
  he knew that . 
  that 's exactly * why * this has to be staged . 
  anyone who means the minecraft-creeper can make that comment , that 's very probable . 
  but in this case , the person means `` creep '' , which is just too much of a coincidence . 
  king of queens is a mirrored version of it too . 
  the guy who just said that he wonders how many people googled nihilism . 
  [ reminds me of this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0aoymrvdem#t=14s ), 
  okay , i just added this to my favorites and i 'm looking forward to playing this tonight , when more people are online . 
  thrillho, 
  i actually did n't know this . 
  does it work well ? 
  singular is for 1 and plural is for everything else . 
  reminds me of mother 3 . 
  [ i wonder why . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncfv4hvpe5q ), 
  must be the big pupils . 
  any information on what cookies are gon na do or how they 'll be created ? 
  `` mine works . '', 
  `` are you talking about boat-waterfall-elevators ? 
  because this is not what we 're talking about . '', 
  `` no , i 'm talking about the same thing you are talking about . 
  to prevent that conversation from happening , he posted a picture of what he means . 
  i think he meant minecraft , and not tf2 . 
  the levels in the chapter `` cramps '' are called `` lamp oil '' , `` rope '' , `` bombs '' . 
  the funny thing is : apparently , one has to wait for the posters approval until the comments are posted . 
  apparently , he only accepts hater comments . 
  he 's not only trolling stupid people , but also people who * hate * stupid people !, 
  i once logged in , looking at a staircase . 
  i walked up the staircase and went towards a wall . 
  then i somehow went up the wall , until i realised that i was actually walking down the stairs and that the wall was the floor . 
  it felt so weird !,

  ... uh , it is n't so obvious that he still tried after reading the name . 
  it 's not like everyone here is watching breakthesun at all times . 
  ah , i already tried it with a bridge that 's only 1 block wide , and it did n't grow at all . 
  do i actually have to stand next to it while it 's growing ? 
  ugh , i just read this in se\u00f1or chang 's voice . 
  `` das wohnzimmer '' is neutral , not male . 
  but that was probably just a typo or something , since you seem to know what you 're talking about . 
   lucas : at least you got to be in a game . 
  i do n't get it . 
  oh , i thought you thought that lucas does n't come from * any * game at all , because you said `` you got to be in a game '' , and i 'm pretty sure that mother 3 is a game .
