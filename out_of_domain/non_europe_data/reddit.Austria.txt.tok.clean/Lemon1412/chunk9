  but yeah , i see your point . 
  yes , that 's what you use an axe for . 
  huh ? 
  i ca n't really imagine what that sounds like . 
  how would the gnome thing explain that you never see her ? 
  yes , came here just to say that it also happened to guitarplaya161 . 
  and she is the wife of the sniper 's voice . 
  i think . 
  are you sure ? 
  the steam timer tells me that i played for 6 hours , and i 'm sure i played longer than that . 
  if you really got your information from the steam timer , then read [ this ] ( http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/04/20/portal-2-in-4-hours-the-steam-timer-is-a-lie/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed%3a+rockpapershotgun%2fsteam+%28rock%2c+paper%2c+shotgun%3a+steam+rss%29 ) . 
  it also told me that i 've been playing team fortress 2 for 700 hours . 
  and i have n't even played for 300 hours . 
  it just reset to one minute . 
  edit : it said the following :, 
  09:00 -- welcome to the aperture science surprise deployment initiation system bootup sequence . 
  09:00 -- performing initiation scanning protocol ... 
  09:00 -- setting system clock time : july 14th , 1973 . 
  09:01 -- calculating reticular splines ... 
  09:01 -- beginning boot sequence from master boot sector 16 ... 
  09:01 -- checking phase 4 memory ... 
  09:01 -- loading sdisos ... 
  09:02 -- boot sequence complete .

  09:03 -- initiating surprise deployment protocol ... 
  09:03 -- deploying surprise in ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 
  and now the server is having problems . 
  you 're someone else 's problem . 
  let this be an exaggeration . 
  you should have said `` roger ! '' . 
  * canned laughter *, 
  i read it in spongebob 's voice . 
  in retrospect , it was probably a bad idea . 
  well , 3/4 of the redundancy get you every time . 
  herman the german becomes herman the viking . 
  i got that program like a year ago , and it never worked . 
  the illumitux symbol was just grey . 
  with one hand . 
  why does n't it say that on the website ? 
  or did i completely miss that ? 
  he should of capitalized the `` s '' , though . 
  man , i hate people who make mistakes in their comments . 
  it 's just a scene from later in the game . 
  it 's the scene in the room before the boss room of the spirit temple . 
  [ no , i 'm pretty sure he means the final shot of the game . 
  no matter which portal you shoot to < you know what  , the portal on the floor will always be the other one . 
  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  i know i did n't * have * to , but i sometimes almost look at spoilers without even thinking when i 'm tired . 
  ( i usually manage to look away as soon as i realise what i 'm doing . ), 
  so even if people accidently look at my post , they still wo n't get spoiled , and people who already finished the game know exactly what i mean . 
  do n't call a woman a skank . 
  you do n't want to get your head crushed by an atm machine . 
  please use spoiler tags . 
  read the subreddit description and find out how . 
  but the french `` pipe '' only means a pipe which you use to smoke . 
  it 's not even the right word for the thing on the t-shirt . 
  season 2 , episode 14 . 
  the one with dungeons and dragons . 
  [ relevant . 
  okay , the texture of the yellow block [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bsgwp.jpg ) is just genius . 
   they wouldnt have struggled at all untill they realised you betrayed them . 
  wow , you just made that story much more depressing . 
  ooh , i just noticed that your name is tomatosan !, 
  are n't you also the person who was in charge of the mother 3 translation ? 
  portal 2 . 
  science is n't about asking `` why ? '' . 
  it 's about asking `` why not ? 
  wow , the end of the video must have been so confusing to the people who do n't know the context . 
  gim me five bees for a quarter , you 'd say !, 
   when life gives you lemons ... 
   ... throw a party, 
  oh gee , what would a party like that be called ? 
  nobody who does n't know * it * would n't get the reference anyway . 
  edit : ignoring the fact that some people just posted links to it . 
  well , the url says `` kaito vocaloid '' so i assume that he 's a male [ vocaloid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vocaloid ) . 
  your head is all red !, 
  like a strawbrary !, 
  he was only joking . 
  ... right ? 
  best song in the game ( even though it is n't even originally from the game ) , especially [ when you 're in mid-air .

  my favorite awkward britta moment was the one where she is trying to be dramatic :, 
  `` maybe we do . 
  * may . 
  and everone else just stares at her . 
  maybe it was a simpsons reference . 
  ( mcbain ), 
  ftfy . 
  also , hank actually seems like a smart guy sometimes . 
  i do n't know an example from the top of my head , but i know he has surprised me with clever actions before . 
  mcbain is in quite a few episodes , and the evil guy sometimes screams `` mcbaaaaaaaiiin '' , so there was n't much context other than the fact that the two names sound similar . 
  it has been confirmed , actually . 
  do n't worry , the folks on court-records . net are working on a [ fan-translation ] ( http://z11.invisionfree.com/court_records/index.php?showtopic=4060 ) . 
  none . 
  it 's a name . 
  but sometimes ( at least in austria ) they say der/die before a name , like `` die maria ist so dumm '' . 
  reddit does not have a natural gender , though . 
  it 's a website . 
  * it was coppersauce the entire time !,
