  i know i would . 
  it looks like the elephant 's thinking both lines for some reason . 
  it annoys me that it 's blue jeans and pop music for every country . 
  what 's the `` bled on me '' a reference to, 
  if you take the percentage of each subreddit of how many people have been in the nile , / r/egypt will have the highest . 
  i think that 's really lame , to be honest . 
  he 's a `` perfect '' clone because he looks ( except the size ) like hitler , sounds like him , behaves like him and has the same memories . 
  i guess they added the 6 inch part so he 's more helpless and easier to torture . 
  is that s god damn persona 5 reference ? 
  battle royale was originally a book !, 
  this is definitely not the same wording . 
  what 's your job ? 
  i do n't see what the big deal is . 
  when the sand bird turns , all you have to do is just walk onto it 's side . 
  just do n't jump . 
  what is the joke here ? 
  did the owner die ? 
  or is this one of those `` relatable '' comics and implies that many people do n't put their clothes away properly ? 
  if having a `` real friendship '' with an animal or even a human makes you trust their gut feeling based on absolutely nothing then you 're just being irrational . 
  it 's only human to judge based on appearances or first impressions you have , but it 's still irrational . 
  my point is you can love and trust your dog as much as you want , but that does n't make his judgment of the character of someone you do n't know correct . 
  if the dog sees the other person do something bad and you did n't , then sure . 
  but if you both know the same amount of stuff about the person ? 
  what does the dog base his judgment on ? 
  is there a smell that only evil people emit ? 
  cuz if so , then in totally with you . 
  but right now , i ca n't really get on board with this idea . 
  imgur itself is super new , though . 
  no , you are reading way too much into it . 
  where did i say or imply anything about being dismissive ? 
  everything that i said applies to someone being suspicious of someone . 
  inb4 `` omg i never realized '', 
  probably my favorite out of his movies , though i do n't think many people agree . 
  i 've never not pronounced `` b\u00e4ren '' with two syllables . 
  i can relate to your kids . 
  princess bride is a kissing movie . 
  oh , do n't get me wrong . 
  people love it , but i 'm just saying i think that most people think hot fuzz is better . 
  see ? 
  you do n't agree with me either !, 
  there are so many funny moments before 1:20 . 
  do n't skip anything . 
  well at least she 's to be respected, 
  what changes would you make ? 
  i mean , 96 % of the game is just comparing names and numbers between the rules and the person 's papers , so the story of the game would n't really fill a lot of the movie . 
  would you expand on backstories like the love story between the guard in green who works with you and his girlfriend ? 
  would you do more with the simon wens ( the child killer near the end ) story ? 
  would the protagonist of the game even be in the movie a lot or will he just be in some short , central scenes where he decides the fate of a person ? 
  did n't they say they 'd make half life 3 instead of another episode . 
  i mean , hl3 is never coming out , that 's for sure . 
  but i think they said that they were n't planning on making the next installment an episode a long time ago . 
  it 's not like he 's making it a big deal , though ? 
  by the way , did those puzzles progress the game in any way or were they just sort of side puzzles for fun ? 
  i remember getting to the end of it and being confused because i had n't ever seen a new type of puzzle that you have to solve a dozen of that just leads to ... nothing . 
  it 's another urethra episode !, 
  you know how there are tokens and achievements you get for being nice to certain people by breaking the rules a little ? 
  all of my friends who play papers please show the same pattern : they do n't get the first two or three towns , but they get the towns after that . 
  i like how people go super by the book in that game until they get fed up with the system and just help people . 
  ( especially after you * have * to make a mistake or two to progress ), 
  are you roger workman ? 
  i read the title as onion 's belt and thought `` is this some sort of simpsons reference ? 
  now you 're gon na say `` hey julian , what if my smelly urethra was in undertale ? 
  source : https://www.reddit.com/r/rantgrumps/comments/6yi1nv/discussion_what_do_you_guys_think_of_oney_plays/dmny9u7/?context=3, 
  imagine at the end of undertale you go to the surface and it turns out it was set inside osama bin laden 's urethra the whole time !, 
  `` hmmm , that name seems familiar . 
  i feel like i 've been waiting for this game for some reason . '', 
  * by the developer of gunpoint *, 
  `` fuck yes '', 
  how does no country for old men kill people with air if we breathe air hm ?? 
  stupid movie people, 
  `` after every episode there people ** discussing ** it on youtube !, 
  calm down , geez ! '', 
  `` or let them have their ** fun ** ! '', 
  `` if ** being an asshole ** is ** fun ** to you ! '', 
  that silence before the lights went off was so sad . 
  wow , they 're gon na beat this game , are n't they ? 
  and pretty quickly , too !, 
  it 's a short game , only like 7 levels and you have to do 6 shines each . 
  it did . 
  it says something like `` press t for throwing mode '' and then you do it , and then it says `` i 'll let you figure this out '' or something . 
  and because you can beat it with 50 shines !, 
  wait ... 
  i thought it was a reference to oney and his friends referencing 3lamestudio 's `` simpsons in undertale '' video ? 
  can it be found after the limited time is over ? 
  no there is n't, 
  what when did that happen, 
  did she do it ? 
  wow that dio was an asshole , huh, 
  not the fact that people did n't get it was a joke , but the fact that * it was a joke * ? 
  oh , i thought the weird ones only exist `` on the internet '' . 
  he healed a guy 's foot at one point !, 
  stealing video games from each other as kids is a thing ? 
  what about ... 
  parents ? 
  for example , organ playing always makes villains much cooler to me . 
  i crafted three scrapped metals today and i wanted to use them to make a reclaimed metal , so i put the three of them together , but then the game told me that there 's `` no matching blueprint '' and now the metals are gone !, 
  did anyone else have this problem ? 
  why does it even happen ? 
  no matter if it was a good thing , a bad thing , if you schemed a plan to take revenge on someone , or if you did something and just thought to yourself , `` you magnificent bastard . '', 
  seriously , i figured that someone * has * to be the first one on a server , so i joined the empty reddit europe server yesterday , and within 45 minutes , it was full !,
