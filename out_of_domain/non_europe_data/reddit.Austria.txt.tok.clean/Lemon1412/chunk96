  never had this much fun !, 
  so to anyone who joins empty servers : thank you . 
  i 've had this problem for a while now and it 's starting to annoy me . 
  here 's a picture :, 
  it would n't even be that bad if it at least showed me my favorites , but all my favorites and my history are gone !, 
  the only ways to join servers are either join a friend , or refresh the favorites until * one * server gets displayed . 
  has anyone else had this problem ? 
  how can i solve it ? 
  today i played on the reddit europe server and joined blu . 
  the map was gravelpit and the only point blu has capped was point a. 
  we had like 10 seconds left to capture the second point . 
  luckily , we had a little bit of overtime after the time had run out and started capping . 
  red tried to defend , but we managed to capture the point during overtime . 
  at that exact moment , the announcer declares that we ** lost ** . 
  everyone in the chat started saying stuff like `` oh man , this is the third time this has happened '' and `` i 'm getting sick of this bug '' . 
  what is the reason for this bug ? 
  has anyone here experienced something like this on another map ? 
  five people were capping the point and instead of a `` time has been added . '', 
  they got a `` you failed ! '' . 
  can be pretty frustrating . 
  you know those weird `` quotes '' that teenagers use as their facebook status ? 
  ( usually about love or something . ), 
  tell me the worst you 've ever read . 
  in case you 're wondering , the first two episode aired on 1:30 p.m. on pro 7 . 
  in german . 
  i watched it and it had some flaws . 
  * the first thing you hear in the first episode was the dean . 
  was his voice fitting ? 
  it was way too deep . 
  * in the original , jeff said something like `` abed , nice to know and meet you , in that order '' . 
  in german , he says something like `` nice to meet you after this long back story '', 
  * when jeff said `` i 'm jeff . 
  or ... jefe '' , there were n't any subtitles that said `` boss '' . 
  to be fair , that does n't ruin the joke , it just makes it more subtle . 
  still , i think it was funnier with subtitles . 
  * i think duncan said `` why am i still screaming ?!, 
  i 'm drawing attention to myself ! '', 
  in the original , but in the german version , he said `` why am i still screaming ?!, 
  i guess i do n't get enough attention ! '' . 
  * when duncan calls jeff and tells him to come to the parking lot , he spoke with a deeper voice in the original . 
  here , he actually used a voice changer !, 
  * after pierce and jeff had their presentation in episode 2 , chang said `` f , f minus '' to them . 
  pierce responds with `` did you say s ? '', 
  because f sounds like s . in the german version , he said `` f\u00fcnf , f\u00fcnf minus '' ( f\u00fcnf = 5 , being the worst grade ) pierce says `` did you just say 8 ? '' . 
  i do n't think i can call this a flaw though , because what were they supposed to do ? 
  same with the assburger pun , they called it arschberger , which was acceptable . 
  some unusual things :, 
  * shirley has the same german voice as bart simpson , but it 's fitting . 
  * they pronounce senor chang how an actual chinese person would pronounce it . 
  and here 's stuff i liked :, 
  * i actually liked most of the voices . 
  * abed . 
  the references and quotes he does are perfect in the german version . 
  for example , the part where he starts screaming and quoting breakfast club ( something about getting a pack of cigarettes ) : in the german version , he actually says what they said in the german version of the breakfast club !, 
  nice !, 
  did anyone else watch it ? 
  the song that plays when lelouch fights charles . 
  i ca n't find it anywhere in the ost and i think it was in episode 1 too . 
  here 's a video for reference : http://youtu.be/kcenp5-svrk#t=56s, 
  tell me your best stories about harmless lies you told someone and went through with . 
  things like `` i convinced this one guy that i had two mothers for no apparent reason '' . 
  i do n't have any stories like that , but i 'm interested in reading some of yours . 
  something like `` you have to wait an hour until you can request call me maybe again '' . 
  feel free to pick out any particular scene that shows it . 
  subs are out !, 
  ten years ago , german tv aired a cartoon ( probably japanese , but i do n't remember ) starring three ghosts . 
  one of them was a cook , the other one was a barber and i do n't know about the third one . 
  one episode would consist of two or more sub-episodes . 
  also , there was a cat in it that could talk . 
  ( i remember it saying that it only bathes once every year . ), 
  in one episode , the hair dresser had to cut an invisible guy 's hair . 
  i think he was able to see him in the mirror though . 
  i have so much to talk about , especially the ending !, 
  ( english is not my native language , and i 'm sort of just rambling here , so forgive me if it 's not a masterpiece of a self post . ), 
  ** turn back now if you have n't read it !!!, 
  i am still not sure what ending i would have liked more : shogo kawada winning the game by acting like he was their friend for the whole game , or him being a hero who saves noriko and shuya with his plan . 
  up until after they kill kiriyama , i had n't even considered that kawada could have just planned on betraying them from the beginning . 
  i mean , yes , they talked about that several times in the book , but i never seriously thought that it could actually happen . 
  after kiriyama was dead , and their plan was supposed to be set in motion , i thought , `` huh , how could they end this now ? 
  there 's not a lot of pages left . '', 
  the next few pages of the book made me really nervous . 
  kawada made them follow him up some hill . 
  this is where i started getting suspicious . 
  i started doubting that there was seriously a way to escape the game . 
  `` what if he just ... shoots them now !? '', 
  and then , on the hill , he told noriko and shuya to give them their weapons . 
  holy shit . 
  i got really suspicious of him then . 
  this was n't really going to happen , right ?!, 
  `` remember when i told you i may have just wanted partners in the game and intended to shoot you in the end ? '', 
  `` so what ? '', 
  `` so , you lose . '', 
  i needed to close the book and just facepalm after that moment . 
  not because it was a shitty part of the book . 
  no , i facepalmed because he tricked not only them , but me , the reader , as well !, 
  how could i have believed that there was a way to escape ? 
  all this time , when he said that he could n't tell them what his plan was , i thought it was because he knew they were being recorded , not because he just ... did n't have an escape plan !, 
  the dialogue between sakamochi and kawada was interesting . 
  i really did n't know where it was going . 
  at first , when sakamochi was talking about how the bracelets are built , i thought he was going to explain to him that shinji actually succeeded in hacking them and that they did n't even work anymore near the end of the game , meaning that kawada did n't even have to betray them .
