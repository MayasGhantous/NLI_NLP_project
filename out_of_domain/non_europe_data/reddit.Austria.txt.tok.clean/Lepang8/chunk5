  can someone explain why it 's gray ?!, 
  he can smell your secret silent fart , be careful . 
  & gt ; enter 52-year-old margaret daalman , a netherlands resident who went to the hospital complaining of crippling stomach pains . 
  her x-rays revealed what appeared to be a huge , dense squid . 
   after unzipping the woman -- seriously , we have no idea what surgeons do -- the team found [ . . ] utensils ... 
   they proceeded to remove over 78 spoons and forks , one by one .

  they did n't made it to new year , what a tragedy . 
  they wanted to be happy , they were happy , the next second they went silent forever ... 
  wow , the worst upvoted comic i ever read . 
  nothing made sense ( yeah , you `` throw '' a firework ) , and a stupidity of 110 % ( aiming at a tree ? 
  ) , and then you rage because you make such dumb mistake ? 
  does your butthole hurt now ? 
  busted peeking, 
  i recommend ccleaner . 
  cm is 12mb in size , cc only about 2mb . 
  see the difference ? 
  please do n't hate me for that , but is n't this considered `` revenge porn '' and is illegal ( in some countries ) ? 
  my friends are already confused of the size of a nexus 7 ( 2013 ) . 
  they do n't know if they should call it a tablet or a phone . 
  no need to start with the topic `` lollipop '' . 
  but most of them have iphones , one has an xperia , one a lg , one has an htc m8 . 
  to let them know what root is , i just compare it with `` jailbreak '' . 
  they understand or at least heard of `` jailbreaking '' . 
  full hd is my sweet spot . 
  swollen penis, 
  are you using the original asus charging cable and wall adapter ? 
  you may have to wiggle the micro usb male a bit to make sure it 's connected to the usb port . 
  might be loose . 
  normally it should charge with an about 900ma flow if the device is not used and in complete standby mode . 
  edit : whoops , i meant `` too '' *, 
  my n7 fhd has 5.0.1 and is only a bit slower than kitkat but not incredible slow . 
  i did clean flash the firmware , but the memory leak and worse battery life is real . 
  i dreamed that i had a girlfriend and we hugged each other in a snowy night . 
  i do n't know why , but it was a nice but very sad moment . 
  we did n't talk anything , just hugged . 
  pillow , i guess you know what i could do with it . 
  quickly read the book about evolution . 
  because it turns the raindrops on when they are being slapped against glass plane . 
  on mobile , i have to watch advertisements for three sec after each slide of the slideshow , so annoying . 
  i live near an outdated airfield where hitler landed his plane . 
  now i am going to have a nightmare ... 
  yes , instead of 12 chicken nuggets , i got 13 , awesome !, 
  daydreaming, 
  not us only, 
  finding some squirting videos of her is very hard , is this a new video , i need source !, 
  just go to play store and download/install it on your lollipop device , it works ! when you open the app , a popup will show up telling you that it would work better on devices with 1gb or more ram and 4.4 . x android . 
  but you can still proceed using it normally on android 5.0 . 
  i have a good experience . 
  i am so old that i saw everything in black and white . 
  most comments i read here are hates like `` booo '' or `` bye spotify '' against spotify , no useful discussion to see here at all , very sad . 
  that 's how the android community is ? 
  people forget that spotify is spotify . 
  i used gpm and am using spotify now , i like both , both are equally nice streaming services . 
  to stream music from device to stereo sound system , i use bluetooth , easy . 
  i enjoy the music , not the cast feature . 
  and most reposted ... 
  hm , i 'm sorry , i uploaded this picture using the reddit sync app . 
  maybe it resized/downsized images when uploading , well , images ? 
  i do n't know . 
  smart enough to distinguish between my utopistic daydreams and fucking reality . 
  `` can anyone fly this plane ? '', 
  now let 's see when the first gpm fanboy comments will appear ... 
  that good looking big mac . 
  no , i would be glad to have that second life . 
  at least you are not the one who would write `` i stick to my all access '' or something similar . 
  i read that a lot like on g + , something i would say `` i do n't give a fuck '' to . 
  but , whatever . 
  `` what do you do in your free time ? '', 
  persistent eidetic memory, 
  all celebrities will commit suicide, 
  these ones, 
  not really worst , but quite confusing : i once kind of half dreamed and half been awake . 
  so , right eye `` saw '' the bedroom ceiling and my left eye still `` saw '' a scene of a dream , and in the middle there was a very blurry border between these two views . 
  i was paralyzed and confused but somehow i found it interesting and magical . 
  then i woke up ... 
  you confused zdnet with bbc ? 
  i am too afraid that i might squash him/her when i try to pet ... 
  looks like completely nuked, 
  `` tell me , why you left me so long ? '', 
  yeah , the waiting was infuriating, 
  why would somebody down vote this comment ? 
  android 5 . x.x ota update will not work if the system is modified ( e.g. 
  root ) . 
  even if you come from 4.4.4 ... 
  i am lonely . 
  or there are surely more than one incendiary bomb . 
  if i had unlimited money then the money is totally worthless , which means , i could n't buy anything ... 
  any kind of food . 
  if your hungry , buying food is awesome . 
  exactly , the strange thing is when i take out my phone and light up the lock screen , i can clearly see the big digital clock , but somehow i do n't really concentrate on recognizing the numbers . 
  next , as a `` reflex '' , i often click the power button once , let display light up , ok , see some content , and instantly click the power button again . 
  -  that 's how i oversee the clock . 
  guess i am not the only one, 
  you buy the dev a slice of pizza !, 
  `` the rules ! '', 
  [ ... ] , `` you 're breaking the rules ! '', 
  it 's very well made documentary with very beautiful scenes and a touching ** true ** story . 
  i really want to visit that place and forget about my life for one moment . 
  i would really want to get the blackberry passport .
