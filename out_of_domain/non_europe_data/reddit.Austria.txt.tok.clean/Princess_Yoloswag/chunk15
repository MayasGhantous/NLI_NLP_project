  budget arround 1k . 
  thanks in advance ? 
  edit : btw , would switching to win8 boost my performance ? 
  im not sure if im the only one , but since 4.10 , my client sometimes freezes during champ select , i can select a champ ( most of the time ) , but cant lock in or changes runes/masteries because everything just turns grey . 
  the bug even remains if i get queued up again , here i was in ban phase , but it still shows the champs picked/banned from last game, 
  when you change your mastery-page in the game lobby , there is a slight chance that the changes are not saved . 
  ( 3 out of 5 games so far ), 
  and no , i did not simply forgot to save them : i only have 1 rune page ( which i change before every game ) and once the game is over , my mastery-page shows the masteries i was supposed to have ingame ( but didnt ) . 
  for example i had a game with 0 9 21 masteries , after that one i went to teambuilder , changed them to 30 0 0 and i still had the 0 9 21 masteries when the game started . 
  edit : well it seems like i dont even have to change them , after my game with the wrong masteries , i checked them before i even got into the lobby but i still had the wrong masteries once i was in the game ... 
  riotpls, 
  so i 'm at the point where you get messages from your crew members before the party itself , but i only got them from edi , garrus , treynor and james . 
  what about the others ? 
  ive heard that there is one for ever crew member ) :, 
  it completly ruins the tension , especially when the game is so close and you cant even see the nexus hp bar ... 
  so im not sure if this is a bug or if something is wrong with the settings , but im having trouble reading the tooltips of items . 
  can someone help me out with this ? 
  edit : seems like it 's a bug that only happens in the starter edition !,

  thank you very much !, 
  my problem is , that when i click on the launcher , it immediatly starts the game without giving me access to the client ( with all the settings and so on ) . 
  as a result : every time i try to log in , it tells me i got an outdated client and need to update it --  which i cant because i cant even access the client !, 
  not sure if its important , but i downloaded the game during the free weekend offer ( where it worked ), 
  hope you guys can help me out !, 
  for us non-americans pls . 
  any help is highly appreciated,

  my specs :, 
  win 7 64 bit, 
  bios : phoenix - awardbios v6 .00 pg, 
  processor : intel ( r ) core ( tm ) 2 quad cpu q9650 @ 3.00 ghz ( 4 cpus ) , ~ 3.0 ghz,

  i tried normal soap but that does n't seem to work . 
  hope you guys can help me out !, 
  cheers, 
  she has never been outside her homecountry ( ethiopia ) and i am thinking about visiting either japan or taiwan , have n't decided yet . 
  that being said ( and pls dont take it the wrong way ) japan does have a bit of a stigma of being unwelcome to foreigners , especially blacks and i dont want to ruin her first experience outside of ethiopia . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  cheers !, 
  i do n't want to post the picture online , but it 's nothing spectacular , just the faces of 2 african women next to each other smiling . 
  i am looking for someone who can draw me the exact same picture either digital or per hand . 
  if someone is interested , pls contact me per pm , so we can discuss any further details . 
  thanks !, 
  ok so thought it would be a good idea to clean my mechanical keyboard . 
  i first removed all the caps , then cleaned the keyboard with water . 
  now it doesnt work anymore , the moment i plug it in , it seems to randomly hold down a bunch of buttons . 
  i was planning to let it dry for a few more days , but is my keyboard ( razer blackwidow 2014 ) still saveable ? 
  hey guys !, 
  as the title indicates , i am not very familiar with building my own pc , so go easy on me .

  obviously , there are a couple of problems i currently have :, 
  should i go for the ** i7-6700k ** or the cheaper ** i5-6600k ** instead ? 
  assuming i actually go for the skylake processor , then i am having trouble finding a motherboard that is compatible , can someone help me out ? 
  in terms of storage , i cant decide wether i should go for the version above , or straight go to a ssd instead ( f.ex . 
  ** samsung 850 evo-series 500gb 2.5 '' ** ), 
  thanks for helping me out , i really appreciate it !,
