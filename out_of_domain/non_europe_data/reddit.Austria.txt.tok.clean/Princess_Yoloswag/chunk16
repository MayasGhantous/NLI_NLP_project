  i 'd have a couple of questions concerning this build . 
  do i need to add stuff in terms of cooling such as fans ? 
  i am hesitant wether i should stick with the skylake-cpu above or go for the ( on paper better ? ), 
  intel i7-4790k instead . 
  thoughts ? 
  thank you for your help , i really appreciate it !, 
  my notes are a bit confusing and lacking . 
  from what i manage to gather from them , is that southern rhodesia gained independence from gb , which tansania protested against , because they wanted gb to keep the current system , but why ? 
  ( my notes say something about tansania not wanting to keep the segregation ? ), 
  thanks for your help !,

  currently a university student in austria who is insecure about his future . 
  i am currently a sociology student in vienna , austria . 
  inititally i wanted to get a master in international development , but after i gave it some thought i decided against it and go for a master in public health instead . 
  my question now : how secure is the health sector in the coming years/decades ? 
  i do n't remember it being always like this , but i always have to mark the entire page to make the number visible because the number is grey on a white background . 
  is there a way to change that ? 
  if so , what are my options ?

  since i am not too happy with it , i was thinking of switching to public health after ( ! ), 
  my bachelor in sociology . 
  my thought was , that the healthindustry is a futureproof and growing sector with decent to well paid jobs . 
  what do you guys think ?

  hello / sweden , fellow from austria here and i have a question . 
  with the recent decision to implement temporary border checks in sweden , i wanted to know what the average swede thinks about this whole refugee topic . 
  i know sweden has always been proud of its liberal immigration politics , but reading the news ( and looking at the latest polls [ both in austria and sweden ] ) , i got the impression that is starting to change , hence my question . 
  since germany , sweden and austria are pretty the countries that do most of the work , i wanted to know what you guys in sweden think about this whole thing . 
  sk\u00e5l !,

  my mom is from taiwan but i was born raised in austria and my chinese is bad , to say the least . 
  my girlfriend is ethiopian , even though her skin color is sort of brownish , rather than dark , i was still wondering how taiwanese people would react to her . 
  are africans common in taiwan ? 
  are there any things we should be aware of , when coming to taiwan for vacation ( such as stares , steoreotypes ect ), 
  cheers, 
  send me a private message and we can discuss details . 
  i am currently visiting friends in ethiopia and brought my wii u with me . 
  problem is that it does n't work , just a black screen . 
  then i realized that the tv is not compatible with hdmi , so we got an av cable but it still did n't work . 
  someone told me that i have to change the settings to `` non hdmi '' but i unfortunately do not have my gamepad with me . 
  question # 1 : is the reason why the tv just shows a black screen because of the settings ? 
  question # 2 : would it work if i were to borrow a gamepad just to change the settings , so i do n't have to buy a new one ?
