  hope you guys can help me out !, 
  i am thinking of doing an internship with me and my friends , but there are a couple of things i wanted to ask first . 
  greetings from vienna !, 
  match making is a chore and i am looking for someone to train with . 
  i am completly new to street fighter and fighting games in general , if youre interested , send me a message on reddit !, 
  happy fighting . 
  never got around to play it for longer than 10 hours and want to finish it . 
  please only europeans or close to central europe time . 
  i 've tried playing with americans , but it didnt work out due to different time zones . 
  cheers !, 
  i dont know if its just me , but before the march update , i had to wait between 5 and 10 min for a game ( i live in europe ) , but now its closer to 20 ... 
  anyone else having this problem ? 
  my average matchmaking takes between 5 and 10 minutes and it 's obviously very frustrating . 
  best of 3 has helped , but does n't solve the actual problem for me . 
  i tried to find any updates on capcoms side , but could n't find anything ) :, 
  i 've always played with the idea of moving to canada in the near future ( still a college student ) , but whenever i try to get information about canada , i only hear positive things and how its literally the best country in the world ( subjective , but not saying its wrong ) , but even the best country in the world must have some bad sides to it . 
  since i am trying to understand both sides of the coin , i wanted to ask what do you guys dislike about canada . 
  also please note : i am not trying to talk shit about canada , it 's just that you find so much positive things about canada , that its difficult to find any negative points as well . 
  for example my ethiopian friends keep telling me how safe canada , but when i compare crime statistics between austria and canada , austria is actually considerable safer . 
  ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=austria&country2=canada ), 
  much love !, 
  ps : oh and i am from austria , vienna . 
  so i 've started playing this game about 2 days ago and i 'm currently level 19 . 
  while i do like the game , i am a bit confused when it comes to equipment , mainly weapons and armors . 
  i know there are these soul shields , but is it true that b & s does n't have the typical `` farming for better equipment '' like other mmoprgs have ? 
  i am using the same weapon ( though upgraded ) that i got at the beginning of the game and armor does n't seem to have any effect at all .

  i recently came across a map of all the age of consents and was ( as a european ) surprised how high it is in some us states . 
  i suppose it does make sense since different cultures have a different approach to sex ( conservative parts of the us vs france for example ) . 
  for example i live in austria and when i was 14-15 it was n't unusual for his/her boy/girlfriend to sleep over in your room at your parents house - something i 've been told is an absolut no go in the us . 
  what do you guys the appropriate age of consent should be ? 
  do different ages in different countries make sense ? 
  hello everyone, 
  me and my friends are interested in doing an internship in thailand . 
  my friends say we should try to find something in nakhon nayok since we would be able to get free housing there , but i am worried about a lack of internships since its a rather small city . 
  does anyone might have an idea who ( or which organisation ) could help us out ? 
  as of right now we are kind of out of ideas ... 
  cheers !, 
  hello everyone, 
  my friends and i want to visit thailand in a few months , but we are having trouble finding information about tourist visas . 
  someone told me you can get visas at the airport , but he told me it only lasts for 2 weeks . 
  he also told me that it depends on the nationality of the tourist . 
  he said i ( austrian ) would have an easier time getting a visa than my ethiopian friends . 
  could anyone help us out ? 
  thanks !,

  i am currently a sociology student at the university of vienna doing my bachelor . 
  once i am done with that , i am interessed in doing something with urban planning . 
  since my university offers both `` urban studies '' and `` urban planning '' i wanted to know what the difference is , since - judging by the description - they both sound very similar . 
  this is a quote of a friend of mine who used to study urban planning . 
  while i admire his dedication , i am quite skeptical of this statement and feel like it 's grossly oversimplifiied . 
  nontheless : what do you guys think ? 
  are these kind of games and real life urban planning even remotely the same ? 
  i 've noticed this several times . 
  for example i usually eat 2200cal per day , yesterday i did n't sleep much and did not have the motivation to eat clean and i ended up eating 3500 calories . 
  i ate more calories plus more sheer volume , yet today i was a kg lower than the day before ( from 94 to 93.3 today ), 
  is there any explanation for this ? 
  this is n't the first time this happened to me . 
  in fact , it happened almost every time . 
  ** update ** : so someone told me it has something to do with the fact that i ate a lot of salty things yesterday , that seems plausible, 
  hello everybody, 
  my friends and i want to visit portugal in the summer , i wont need one since im european , but before they go to the embassy i wanted to ask how easy it is to obtain one and if there are any things we should be aware of . 
  cheers !, 
  i was gone for dinner , when i came back it was in the middle of the installation from win7 to win10 . 
  i did n't click on any windows , my pc was in fucking sleepmode while i was gone . 
  i 'm salty . 
  i read this several times but found it hard to believe . . 
  hello everyone, 
  so as the title says my friends and i thought about renting a big appartment or a house for about 3 weeks ( 22 days ) somewhere in bangkok . 
  now i am not sure where to start looking ; i googled around a bit , but only found places that were either too small or way too expensive . 
  does anyone have any idea ? 
  also : what price range are we talking about ? 
  we are not looking for anything fancy , but it should n't be in a shady area either . 
  i am also not sure how many we are going to be , something between 4 and 10 people . 
  thanks a lot !,

  so i 've been doing this shortly after i started masturbating , which is about 8 years ago and i 've always been doing it . 
  i got so used to it , that i just recently realized that it is actually not the norm . 
  i 've tried not clenching it , but then i ca n't cum and now i am kind of worried if it will result in any future problems .
