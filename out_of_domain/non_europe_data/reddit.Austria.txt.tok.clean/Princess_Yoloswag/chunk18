  2 things to note :, 
  i couldnt find the cpu cooler , which is a ekl alpenf\u00f6hn ben nevis for about 27 $, 
  this is just a random case , i might change it . 
  thanks for the help guys !, 
  unfortunately i dont know bangkok very well , so help is very much appreciated !, 
  thanks !, 
  the prices on the menu were totally different than on the bill , we ended up paying a 100 $ for 2 meals and 2 waters ... 
  i keep getting the error 210 , i tried running as admin , opening the application several times and deleting the `` programdata '' folder . 
  now someone told me to just run the exe and not the launcher in the `` game '' folder , but the problem is that i dont actually have the folder . 
  can anyone help me out ? 
  they are screaming and shouting , looking at me and waving with their hands , but they arent attacking , i can just run through them and they leave me alone , even when i attack them . 
  i played this game a couple of years ago and if i remember correctly , they attacked me, 
  - ) male, 
  - ) advanced beginner, 
  - ) working out 4 times a week ( on avg ), 
  - ) cardio 2/week a 45min, 
  edit : sorry for some random german words in there lol, 
  m\u00fcsli is ceral , kn\u00e4cke is a type of hard bread, 
  i uninstalled it about 3 months ago because i was so frustrated with it but coming back now , its really nice to see how much the game has changed for the positive .

  when i connect my phone to the pc , it doesnt allow me to access any files on the phone without swiping down and changing the option from `` charge this device '' to `` transfer files '' . 
  i 've tried changing the setting in the developers option to automatically allow transfering files , but all it does is show me the phone but when i click on it , it says the folder is empty . 
  since my usb cable is very short , it really is a chore to having to change it every single time , so i hope anyone can help me out . 
  so from what i 've gathered so far , everyone seems to love it ... well , except me . 
  so i 've been playing on the new patch for a few hours now and to be frank , i do n't understand the idea behind the scaling of the zones . 
  when i play an mmorpg i want to feel like i 'm progressing , i want to start weak and get stronger as i level up , allowing me to find stronger enemies and getting better gear . 
  but right now i feel like i am just wasting my time when i - after spending countless hours leveling up my character - go back to a beginner zone and have a hard time killing the mobs there . 
  it 's just like in gw2 where it makes me feel like my progress is absolutely useless because i do n't have the feeling of actually getting stronger . 
  anyway , i will admit i am a bit salty considering that this was one of the few mmorpgs i really enjoyed and right now i 'm having a hard time not hating it . 
  i know most people disagree with and i really am desperately trying to like it , so if anyone can explain to me why the system is superior to the other one , i would really appreciate it . 
  i really want to like this game . 
  say my diet plan consists of 100g of rice a day , which is about 350kcal and 75g of . 
  now i also got a can of 500g of white beans ( without the liquid ) , which is about 350 kcal and 45g of carb . 
  the amount of carbs may be lower , but the calories are about the same and i 'm literally eating 5 times as much carbs in terms of quantity , meaning getting hungry is almost impossible . 
  is there anything i 'm missing here ? 
  why is rice so much more popular than beans ?

  i 've only just recently started to play the game and i 'm confused about weapon upgrades . 
  i am only lvl 8 , but have already upgraded my weapon to the point where i ca n't upgrade it anymore before hitting lvl 20 ( which took me 5 min and killing the jiangshi stalker boss twice ) . 
  problem is that i am now completely overpowered and 2 shotting everything with literally no challenge . 
  is that supposed to be like that ? 
  why would they make weapon upgrades that easy to do when it absolutely ruins balance ?
