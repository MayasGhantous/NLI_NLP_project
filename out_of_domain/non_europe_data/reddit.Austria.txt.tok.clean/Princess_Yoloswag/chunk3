  i definitely check them out !, 
  have people actually read the article ? 
  her decision made sense when taken into context . 
  i already found someone , thanks !, 
  i would n't put it that way , especially when compared to the us . 
  the church is actually much weaker , despite ( or especially ) being the official religion of most countries . 
  yes , that 's true , but while it 's safe to assume that big part part of their voters are religious , not everyone who votes for the cdu does it out if religiosity , but because of merkel . 
  on paper , the majority of germans ( or in my case : austrians ) are religious , but there are big differences on how we treat religion . 
  i dont know a single person who goes to church ; this `` in god we trust '' or `` may god protect the us '' ect would be an absolute no-go here , in fact do you really think someone could become the president of the united states when officially being an atheist/agnostic ? 
  you might also wan na check this out :, 
  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country 60 % of germans say , that religion is not important to them ( compared to 35 % in the us ), 
  actually , the russian population is not that religious , when you consider that 36 % consider themselves either `` not religious , but spiritual '' or `` not religious '' . 
  it 's mostly just putin using the orthodox church to strengthen his power, 
  i already have one , its not enough !, 
  well , at least someone is enjoying it ... 
  my plan was to wait another day and see what happens , since i just bought that thign a month ago, 
  shower ... 
  well , i am aware that electrical components and water do n't go well together . 
  but it was my first mechanical keyboard and i assumed that the eletrical components on the inside were well protected . 
  i now know better ... 
  nvm , it was a couple of months, 
  yea i know it was my own fault . 
  i contacted razer suport but do n't except much , guess i have to look for a new one again / :, 
  as long as i dont plug it in again ? 
  what happen if i did ? 
  i ruined my keyboard ( razer blackwidow 2014 stealth ) and need a new one . 
  i do n't really need much many options for finetuning ect . 
  all i care about is a simple , yet high quality mechanical keyboard for writing and gaming . 
  got any recommendations for about  150 $ ? 
  okay , guess i will do just that . . thanks !, 
  i put it in the oven at 50 degree, 
  yea , i guess now i know better, 
  why is that bad idea . 
  i left it open and put it at the lowest possible heat . 
  so in the end its just warm breeze . 
  ( 30-40 degree ), 
  i left the door open , so in the end its just about 30-40 degree , compared to the 25 in my room ( without the warm breeze from the oven ), 
  i just checked on amazon and there are a lot of different versions . 
  got any recommendations for me ? 
  i will , thank you very much for your help !, 
  i 'm not a troll , i 'm a pretty princess . 
  which one exactly , i keep getting the `` incompatibilities '' error . 
  in terms of performance : gaming mostly, 
  but is it then worth going for skylake at all ? 
  according to benchmarks , some cpus such as the intel core i7-4790k actually yield better results . 
  yea , thanks , i didnt even notice lol,

  what do you think ? 
  like this ? 
  yea , that one looks much better than mine , thank you so much !, 
  edit : what do you think about the cpu ? 
  is this one fine or should i get the i7 -6700 k ( or no skylake at all ? ), 
  so i should go with the 2800 cl15 instead ? 
  actually : i am having trouble finding the ram you mentioned , could you send me the link ? 
  i am not familiar with psus , is one of these recommendable ? 
  evga 120-g1-0750-xr, 
  evga supernova 110-b1-0750-vr, 
  ok i updated it , thanks !, 
  what does your friend do as a job ? 
  no , research does n't interest me , i would rather work in an international field , let 's say a global organisation, 
  what did you study ? 
  i am currently a sociology student in vienna , but plan to get a master in public health after my bachelor because i felt like the health sector would be a very safe bet for the future . 
  do you agree ? 
  thanks !, 
  i am currently going through the `` what am i gon na do with my life '' phase every young person goes through and your words really helped me out ( =, 
  the conservative party has always been weak in vienna ( as compared to the rest of the capital ) , its just more extreme than usual . 
  i do n't like strache but that is not what he meant . 
  he was talking about the the end of the 2nd world war and the beginning of the 2nd republic, 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  i was talking about a job that requires me to travel , not where i have a lot of time to travel . 
  are you sure ? 
  i live in europe , austria and ive been told public health would be more of a government job ( such as health ministry ), 
  is that not the case in the us ? 
  actually i am currently getting a bachelor in sociology , then i would have gone for public health ( because i need a bachelor first in order to study ph ), 
  if i may ask : why is a mph not a good degree ? 
  i assumed that with the west having such a big problem with obesity , a job in the healthsector would be a good bet . 
  if i may ask : where do you live ? 
  edit : and can you tell me more what they do / who they work for ? 
  totally unnecessary lol, 
  lol, 
  i got it when i started working out . 
  my doctor toldme its nothing to worry about ( plus it doesnt affect me in a negative way ), 
  alright it seems like no one actually read the article . 
  austria is not closing its borders like hungary did , it is building a fence in order to control the refugees as in `` create one big gate to better control the flow and have an overview '', 
  i do , being an austrian citizen , i 'd like to think i have more information about this national topic than someone who just reads it on the internet . 
  that may or may not change in the future , but as of right now , the border is not closed . 
  great !,
