  the solution was to enter `` tlb '' in the console . 
  apparently there is a `` bright lights '' setting . 
  awesome , and i love how the motive of the koi fits to the cover-up : change , and transition . 
  sounds like paradise , but was n't there this oblivion gates with daedra spawning out thing ? 
  you got sentenced for what your valet driver did ? 
  did n't you explain to court ? 
  oh , good to know . 
  the valet must 've been some serious dumbass , putting his job and much more on the line just for driving the car . 
  he could 've done the same thing by renting a car and going to the racetrack ... moron . 
  actively seeking out only the easy professors and avoiding the hard ones ( even though they might have great lessions/lectures ) is not fucking oneself over . 
  seriously , is it possible that women have somewhat shorter arms in relation to their height than men ? 
  i 'm asking because i often meet women who are my height or only a tiny bit shorter , and they often have noticeably shorter arms . 
  is there a point to that , or is that only my imagination ? 
  i find it confusing as well . 
  does `` 75-100 % coffee '' mean i drink 75 % coffe , 25 % tea , or only coffe , and no tea at all ? 
  i want to see an ama of one of the truck drivers who hit the bridge . 
  your car went on fire ? 
  why , man ? 
  any info what 's with the driver ? 
  arrested , facing charges , etc. 
  i 'm sorry but the trunk just ruins it . 
  it 's horrible . 
  he did post a pic of his jersey as promised he would . 
  but then again his pic is just a photo of a blue jersey and that 's it . 
  what do you make of it ? 
  i also ca n't grasp how people still pay money for porn , when you can bascially find all the porn of mankind for free on the net . 
  be honest with us here . 
  you do n't care about the topic . 
  you just wanted to show everyone how many upvotes your highest-rated post got . 
  well said . 
  i do n't find megan fox attractive , but hundreds of millions of other men probably do . 
  that proves beauty is in the eye of the beholder . 
  this easily proves that `` beauty is not in the eyes of the beholder '' ca n't be true . 
  link dead , is there a mirror ? 
  it 's very awesome . 
  which one is that ? 
  it 's not the one with the school for disabled students , right ? 
  what the hell ... that does n't even make sense . 
  what 's the point of the green text ? 
  is it supposed to be quoting ? 
  `` i do n't love her , but i really want kids , so screw it , let 's get this over with '' ... really ? 
  exactly , women who call me `` gay '' as an insult are not worth my time . 
  all the positive aspects of us world dominance in the past decades do n't make snowden 's leaks any less necessary . 
  snowden is a hero in my book . 
  sadly game companies are now trying to undermine used game selling . 
  things like online passes , which are bound to your user account on specific gaming platforms , and have to be bought individually if you wan na play that game online . 
  they have realized they 're not making money with used game sales and are trying out new phony methods . 
  love being born in a country that does n't circumcise their boys . 
  that reminds me , i wanted to do something in the bathroom . 
  i would say left on the economic scale , but also far on the `` authoritarian '' side . 
  that cheap gas though . 
  can you go more into detail about the psychology argument , with americans acting against their interests ? 
  in these countries ( southern europe ) this also has to do with sky-rocketing rents and house prices together with a high youth unemployment . 
  who the hell wrote that ? 
  `` data gathered from web sites '' ... seems trustworthy . 
  not . 
  more ridiculous to me was the notion that `` your literature is different ( reason and moral ) compared to ours ( logic and reason ) '' . 
  what is that even supposed to mean ? 
  *** gasps *** fuck these monsters !, 
  god bless ` murica . 
  support our troops . 
  it 's a woman . 
  oh you want to take away our freedom ? 
  brrrrt what did you say ? 
  getting in a relationship with a disabled man is `` giving up your life '' ? 
  maybe they have a professional caretaker ? 
  `` eight hundred thousand dollars in debt for cancer treatment ? 
  that 's okay with me , at least we have military bases all over the world ! '', 
  my body 's found a way to get up , walk across the room , turn off the alarm and get back to bed and continue sleeping , without my conciousness . 
  it 's a german site , i 'm not sure if the video can be accessed outside germany . 
  at 3:50 a song starts playing in the background , i know i 've heard it before . 
  it 's very `` spacey '' and `` unreal like '' . 
  really trying to find the name , thank you !, 
  makings the kicking of bottoms of immigrants . 
  lmao !, 
  noice ... pretty cool rims too !, 
  as mgoosen said , most likely a seat rail cover . 
  the statement `` the us saved the world '' is still rubbish . 
  the correct verison would be : `` the allies in ww2 saved a respectable part of the world from tyranny , with the us , the soviet union , the uk and china having played a big part in that . '', 
  / u / ___ whore ___, 
  since you replied to the comment tree by / u / ___ whore ___ , i saw it appropiate . 
  not telling it you , but adding it for others to see . 
  `` european countries are very xenophobic . '', 
  nice generalizing there . 
   the corporation bringing the dispute pays all costs unless they win . 
  [ according to faz ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/ttip-und-freihandel/vattenfall-klage-kostet-schon-jetzt-millionen-13230836.html ) , germany has spent 3.2 million euros in 2012 alone in an isds dispute against vattenfall . 
  how is this possible , if `` the corporation pays all costs unless they win '' ? 
  you claimed they were vhs tapes which is totally wrong . 
  german version ! = not german version . 
  great stuff . 
  you are now the author of the most pointless comment in the history of reddit !, 
  they work 21 % longer in the us but also make 39 % more money . 
  i guess that 's one thing they 've got going for themselves , really high wages . 
  it is kinda cool . 
  then on the other hand , the us has really low consumer prices when compared to many placers in europe . 
  so even if you work as receptionist like you described with relatively low wage , the products you buy for your daily needs do n't have an insane vat attached ( 20 % in my country ) , gas is cheap , rent is so-so , and you do n't have the insane taxes many places in europe generally have . 
  especially `` consumption taxes '' like vat , car tax , gasoline tax , etc. 
  hurt the lower wages most , and europe seems to love them . 
  if you 'd just admit your mistake we could let go of it and you could pretend it never happened . 
  dude , it 's okay .
