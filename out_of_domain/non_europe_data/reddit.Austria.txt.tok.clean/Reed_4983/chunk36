  racist assholes from / r/european on the other hand , are the people i 'd much rather have living in my country , as my neighbours even . 
  if we still have people like you , i feel safe for my beloved europe . 
   i just do n't want people thinking that minibuses are n't safe . 
  depends on how you maintain them . 
  my question would be , do the omegas even want popularity ? 
  because in the population , and in universities too , there are people who are loners , do n't approach other people and are more or less satisfied with their life as it is . 
  it 's not the responsibility of any other person to make this person less lonely if he does n't show that he wants that . 
  from my own university experience , there are people who are more social and people who are less social , and there 's people with and without girlfriends . 
  both are completely heterogeneous groups , and not nearly every guy with a girlfriend is a chad archetype . 
  this sentiment of `` everyone who does not win the genetic lottery gets treated like a piece of shit in life '' is a reason why i ca n't take people in the `` red pill sphere '' seriously . 
  i 'm a honda guy , so what i really hope for in the game is the new nsx or the new civic type r. 
  all the changes in roles and expectations over the last century were just caused by the stupid rationality of humans . 
  rationality , feminism and science are evil , we need to go back to live in caves because that 's the way nature intended . 
  it 's all in our very instincts and dna . 
  nature !, 
  your comment is not reliable as it contains no instincts . 
  stop hamstering . 
  proof is a concept made up my humans . 
  rely on your dna and instinctual behaviour and you 'll never ask for proof again . 
  bmws lose their worth faster than bugattis or mclarens , but they 're not exactly `` dirt cheap when used '' . 
  at least in europe , they lose their worth much slower than any japanese , american or non-german brand . 
  wallowing in sentimental sensations such as hopes and disappointment will not achieve content , and is vague altogether . 
  recollect awareness of your dna and genetic lineage to bring inner peace . 
  yup , even as a poor student you can likely afford a leather jacket , a `` premium '' looking watch , some nice looking shoes , nice shirts , etc. 
  in todays tmes , something which would not have been possible a hundred years ago . 
  but on a negative side , wearing such apparel will be less impressive nowadays , because everyone can afford it . 
  is it just me or are they looking older and older with every year ? 
  `` hanging out with grandpa . '', 
  japan has a lot of economic problems and a high number of people are being forced into low-wage jobs . 
  there 's a lot of complex and diversified factors for the economic problems japan faces , and immigration is just one factor , which does not necessarily lead to lower wages . 
  median wages and similar valus are more complex than just supply and demand of workers . 
  you realize this sub is populated by these men in large numbers ? 
  perhaps some people would love their children with all of their heart , regardless of whether they turn out `` manlets '' or not . 
  perhapse these people just want their kid to become a good , endearing person and not a woeful , miserable humang being like you are . 
  cadillac is an old people brand . 
  okay , the new ones are pretty hot though . 
  i 'm calling interpol now . 
  it 's things like these that make me believe that right wingers or conservatives are just worse people in general . 
  i guess i 'm biased though . 
  unpatriotic bitch deserved it 'cause she drove a nazi car . 
  what 's strawman about that ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  marvel has proven they 're willing to milk the hollywood cow until it breaks . 
  also the film makers do n't have to deal with the hassle of creating new characters , or stories , or settings . 
  the problem with issues like apologizing and acting `` manly '' is that there 's a fine line between right and wrong . 
  if you whine and apologize constantly , she probably wo n't like it , but if you acted like a dick , a straight and honest apology afterwards can also be a very adult and manly thing to do , no ? 
  the `` most responsible teenager in the house '' is also a key red pill truth . 
  is that something most of the women you talked to would agree with ? 
  so what is an example of how women think ? 
  i could imagine they have a very similar opinion about men regarding the seriousness of men 's statements as well as boundaries in a relationship . 
  otherwise , i 'd think they have an unhealthy and strange opinion on their own sex . 
  that sounds reasonable . 
   and they think that our army uniforms are unchanged since 1950 . 
  to be fair , many of these propaganda images show what supposedly happened during the korean war . 
  so the uniforms would be historically correct . 
  put in second , stay on the clutch half-way for a short time , rev up to 1,000 rpm and release the clutch . 
  `` oh my gawd , i have to check on my instagram followers and my whatsapp group and you 're filming me , you creep ?

  i thought that it might add the distance it takes to get from the point where you end the race back to the pit stop . 
  but yesterday i was driving on bathurst and , after ending the race , it added 50 kilometres to the odometer , and the track is n't even nearly that long . 
  gamergate ? 
  i 've encountered this clown a couple of times , he 's a known troll and professional dumbass . 
  here are some of his greatest gems :,

  i want to chip in on this , because i feel it 's a little one-sided . 
  i 'd say that in health care , both germany and austria are pretty much on par and both have excellent systems . 
  i 'm no expert , but there 's also a lot of problem with the german health care system as newspapers and tv reports show regularly . 
  as one example , ambulance service is provided by the krankenkassen in austria , while this is not the case in germany . 
  we also have free universities and no numerus clausus , and germany has lots of completely overfilled universities . 
  while we have the fp\u00d6 , they have a new aspiring little party called afd that is reaching 30 % popularity in some regions , so there is also a large right-wing underbelly in the german population . 
  our social and welfare systems are also still better than germany 's . 
  of course there 's aspects that germany is ahead in , such as the political culture , with most high-ranking politicans being on a much higher standard than austria , but overall , germany is not miles ahead of austria and has a big pile of own problems . 
  a final note , most austrians would laugh at the statements of the lunatic this thread is about . 
  still shocks me that the nazis completely burned a whole capital to the ground . 
  i was thinking exactly that . 
  let 's see who 's stronger , 300,000 pounds of american steel or a cuddly little tiguan . 
  or at least there 'd be much less of his kind .

  this is not all wrong . 
  just look at the tiger tank vs the russian t-34 . 
  the tiger was better , yet very unreliable . 
  these guys look so douchey it 's ridiculous . 
  might be off topic , but i thought the brunette woman they argued with was really pretty . 
  are you kidding or have you never played forza ? 
  okay , i thought you were familiar with it . 
  it 's the brake disk that gets hot from hard braking in racing and starts to glow . 
  this does n't explain why they were extremely hesitant to do a proper traffic stop after he woke up and drove away . 
  he refused to leave the sidewalk and kept driving with a man on his hood , on the sidewalk . 
  men with `` big incomes '' and `` baller houses '' are still the minority everywhere ( even though both are relative values ofc ) . 
  they ca n't , and wo n't take away all women . 
  if you have x income and `` sexual market value '' , i do n't see why you should n't be able to find a partner with comparable income and `` smv '' who fits you . 
  what a cucktastic response . 
  he basically argued from a very darwinist viewpoint ( an important element of nazism ) that germans showed themselves to be inferior to the bolshevik hordes and therefore deserved to vanish . 
  he even said that he would not lose a tear to the germans ' fate , so it 's really sad that some few germans still think highly of him today .
