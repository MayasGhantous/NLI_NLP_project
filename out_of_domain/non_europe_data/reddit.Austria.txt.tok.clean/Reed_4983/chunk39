  as i said , the fp\u00d6 was involved in widespread neoliberal policies when it was in the government . 
  sites like pua hate are what i would categorize as the `` black pill '' - a fatalist version of the red pill . 
  while it 's not exactly the red pill , it 's definitely a movement in the red pill sphere , as the biological and absolutist approach of the red pill are a part of it . 
  theories like `` all women will naturally seek the most dominant alpha male '' and `` women do n't care if you 're a good person , unlike men they are not capable of real love , and will abandon you if you do n't show enough confidence and other alpha traits '' , `` women are mentally children '' are part of trp just as they are part of the black pill . 
  difference being that the latter is not focused on improvement or the belief that you can have success , but rather constant whining about the unfairness of the skewed relationship market and the impossibleness of relationship success . 
  it 's a more dark and toxic place than trp in most aspects , and unsurprisingly it 's mostly populated by people in mental grief , many of them being in the autism range . 
  still , it 's mindset and theories about the state of the world align with trp .

  this is true . 
  this was my response because the poster above me ( now deleted ) was talking of a conspiracy that the neoliberals would never accept a president like hofer . 
  with just a bit of luck he wont ever be . 
  yup , nothing worse can come after this . 
  this sub has nothing more to offer . 
  they 've already started privatizing the prison system , and the cheap burgers are worth it o7 . 
  what exactly is the purple view anyway ? 
  the red pill is very extreme to most reasonable people , and the blue pill is just `` the mainstream '' , so the `` purple pill '' would need to be defined more precise as a viewpoint . 
  another follow-up question : why does this pick-up truck with only one seating position exist ? 
  a utility car would need more seats to transport its workers . 
  looking at historical photos reveals that hitler was neither noticeably shorter nor taller than most other men of his generation . 
  of course the point stands that physically frail men have been leaders among humans . 
  on the other side the usual misogynistic crap of `` yeahah womens ' strengths are sitting still and doing what they 're told '' is valuable to any discussion ? 
   they guy just hopes she is nice , does n't get grossly overweight and still wants to open her legs for him now and then . 
  nope , these are definitely not the only criterias that i would make for a woman as a partner , that alone would n't satisfy me . 
  which is funny because trp sanctifies `` the old days '' as when everything was still better . 
  why make feminism your enemy ? 
  look at the positions each by each , and agree with what you agree on , and try to fight what you do n't agree with . 
  custody rights are given pretty equally , they are skewed because many men do n't want custody after a divorce . 
  becoming a bit less nerd-ish in the things that you do in your free time does n't mean you have to quit your hobbies . 
  so you 're just casually saying unlike a woman 's , a man 's body ca n't be attractive in a natural form , without working out to gain muscle definition ? 
   it 's not going to inspire michelangelo ... or your fav hb10 . 
  neither is a plain , skinnyfat woman who does n't work out . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not saying such a woman ca n't be attractive . 
  but you 're essentially saying a man in his basic form ca n't be attractive while a basic woman can . 
  imagine the shitstorm if someone would say something like that the other way around . 
  oh look at that , it 's another one of the weekly `` tell me how great america is once more '' askreddit threads . 
  what does `` it 's a heuristic '' mean in this context ? 
  i seriously do n't understand . 
  and you literally said that while a woman `` as herself '' can be attractive , a man `` as is '' - in his basic form - wo n't do . 
  which i find a little one-sided . 
  i do n't think making a politically incorrect ladies ' man bond would work today , even if it were to take place in the past . 
  there would have to be some strong women in the movie , women where his techniques would fail . 
  vanilla sc4 without rush hour was hard , because there was only the hardest difficulty available and i found it nearly impossible to get a balanced budget . 
  and yeah , building these skyscraper landmarks because i was hoping other ones would pop up ... even though my city was n't nearly big enough for that . 
  at least the coast guard defends america . 
  i 'd say there are no `` feminist statements '' on its own , there are controversial statements and ideas from people who claim to be feminists , such as the `` do n't be that guy campaign '' , which should be criticized imo . 
  but the principle of feminism - equality among sexes - is not a position that one should make his enemy or should reject . 
  which is why i said , take the positions of specific persons or groups , one by one , and deal with them , and either support or reject them , but do n't use a single buzzword like `` feminism '' and put its label on everything you do n't like , because no one will take you seriously except for niche scenes like trp or mra . 
  is the us military some kind of saint ? 
  should you not criticize it in a society of free speech ? 
  i do n't understand it . 
   western europe has embraced gigantic taxes to finance their socialist way of life since world war ii . 
  while taxes are higher in europe , they are not gigantically higher when put in comparison to america . 
  this is a post i 've saved a while ago , which puts it into perspective :, 
  [ https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dn0ck/dear_reddit_im_traveling_from_the_usa_and_my_dad/c11fg4c] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dn0ck/dear_reddit_im_traveling_from_the_usa_and_my_dad/c11fg4c ), 
   i earn # 22k a year , which is # 1833.33 a month - not bad at all but not a huge salary in london where i live . 
  out of that , i pay # 258.75 in tax , # 149.28 in national insurance and # 52.50 towards my student loan debt . 
  so , # 460.53 in total . 
   according to the salary calculator i used ( which has a uk or us version ) , an american on the same salary would pay # 319.66 in taxes in total . 
   so , i pay # 140.87 per month more in taxes than an american on the same wage , which is # 1690.44 per year . 
  that looks like a lot of money until something like what happened to you happens , at which point it looks like a pretty good deal . 
  that blog though , is like a parody of a patriotic murican . 
  from the `` proud reaganite '' to the `` thanks for your service '' in the comments to the `` hurr we paying for your defens '' argument , it 's a real goldmine . 
   paying these taxes assumes that the european is employed , which would be a spotty assumption : the european unemployment rate has hovered around 11 % for most of my adult life , and they consider that ` normal levels . ', 
  as opposed to murica , where some people have to work 4 or 5 jobs to survive , and mini jobs like grocery packers exist , and these people are not counted as `` unemployed '' . 
   yes , cars are luxuries in europe , whereas they are necessities in the u.s. 
   europeans do n't have much room for food storage , and must make daily trips ( within walking distance ) to the local grocery store, 
  these filthy europeans have to walk to get their groceries !, 
  also , why are they not as fat as muricans ? 
  on the other hand , driving your 2,6 ton suv , which swallows 15 litres per 100 km , as a single person , to get to work every day , is not ineffiecient !, 
   and what 's so bad about not having a car ? 
  no more instagram car selfies in the sunset glow ... such is life of a europleb ;(, 
   it 's these latin types that seem to love to piss and shit in their streets , and think nothing of it . 
   italy , especially . 
  getting attention is a different matter , because things such as one gender being expected to approach by society , and so on , come into play . 
  but if we argue about objective attractiveness ( not `` who will get more attention in our western society '' ) i would not agree with the notion that a woman in her basic form is more attractive than a man in his basic form . 
  that 's me who thinks that . 
  well , some people who erected these statues in the ancient greek seemed to have these standards , nontheless many non-athletic men have gone into history as legends . 
  women having higher standards when it comes to the attractiveness of men seems objectively unfair , no ? 
  so he means `` inefficient '' by the `` my personal convenience '' standard , not the ... you know ... actual definition of `` inefficient '' . 
  i bet the owners of these mythical machines have unlimited supplies of potatoes at their disposal . 
  did you mean vienna ? 
  both men and women sacrifice time and money by having a child today , and do so of their own free will . 
  children are also not necessarily a part of relationships . 
  women can orgasm multiple times . 
  so this does n't strike me as a justification why men should have to change their body to be more muscular , while women should have to do nothing . 
  the links talks of several hundred sexual offenses , but not in the city of cologne alone . 
  how an offense is judged ( whether it 's called rape or not ) is dependent on the german law , so it 's kind of bold to simply claim it was labelled differently with a purpose of deception . 
  send me a link to the part where he said that . 
  do you suddenly not trust these sources anymore ? 
  you 're mixing your beliefs of evolutionary psychology that women seek a mate who can preserve and protect the family and child-bearing being an investment with your own theory that men `` as is '' are not attractive enough because some greek statues have six packs while other antique deciptions of women do n't . 
  overall , you 're not making for a very convincing argument . 
  i watched the hart aber fair episode - the person you referred to is the chief of the police union , not the chief of the cologne police . 
  he said that police were sometimes forced to omit perpetrators ' origin , such as not mentioning `` roma und sinti '' . 
  but he did not say that `` sexualstraftat '' was changed to `` k\u00f6rperverletzung '' in cologne . 
  there was a report where a journalist quoted a different policeman who said that this had happened in some police reports , and the chief of the police union confirmed that such actions exist , but that `` it changed in the last few days '' , and did not make clear whether any sexual assaults were hidden in the cologne case . 
  he also did not mention the `` finger in pussy '' rapes on that show . 
  come on man . 
  you had me interested for a while , but in the end it was nothing but conspiracy turd once more . 
  too bad . 
  ka problem .
