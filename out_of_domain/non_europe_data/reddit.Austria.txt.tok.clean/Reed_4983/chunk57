  what if not every man has the same criteria about `` top women '' , and someone 's top woman can be more easily attainable ? 
  i mean , nobody in my life ever told me that women are wonderful people . 
  at least that 's what they tell you over the internet . 
  is that one chubby gifu player a girl ? 
  in which games do they say that ? 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/df/6c/4d/df6c4d10d3bb09b65093e12c3d9138af.jpg ) . 
  since the average female height in the us is 5 ' 4 '' , 60 % of women will not be taller than you there . 
  also try one inch heels maybe ? 
  i do n't know about the shared interests thing . 
  if i had no common interests with a woman , i really would n't know why i want to date her . 
  i like women that are at least reasonably intelligent , and that offers at least a couple of topics to talk about - such as politics , world events , ethics , philosophy , life advice and all that shit . 
   i 'm a shade over 5 ' 7 & about i55lbs, 
  172 is more 5 ' 8 than 5 ' 7 though . 
  good for you !, 
  sure , sex is important in a relationship . 
  but since i 'll probably spend a lot of time with a potential girlfriend , it 's important for me that we share interests and can talk about things . 
  i do n't want my children to have a dumb mother . 
  that 's really scary . 
  but most people will be weirded out when you tell them that you value them for their genetic combination instead of for the persons they are , and rightly so . 
  something like [ this ] ( https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/16265249_1405368882816192_1282374622664104490_n.jpg?oh=ff7d6a7373d8579e8b46dc5254a7dd50&amp;oe=5949261d ) . 
  the cars are often rentals . 
  well , according to the later future epside , he did get with her . 
  and i loved that the writers made it that way . 
  `` harmless '', 
  i knew , just funny that burns thinks it 's harmless . 
  i would love to only play on the pc from now on because it 's cheaper and moddable . 
  the pc is an awesome platform . 
  however , there are just some great games that you ca n't play without a specific console , which is why i bought one . 
  think red dead redemption , the last of us , forza on the xbox and the upcoming ace combat 7 on the ps4 . 
  these are games where a lot of money was spent to make them as good as they are . 
  thankfully , i 've grown out of the `` my console is the best and everyone else is stupid '' age . 
  you 're right . 
  i had no idea . 
  i had this thought that it was ps exclusive . 
  this is great . 
  look up the voyager golden record . 
  this is basically gramsci 's idea of hegemony . 
  you 've got a system so deeply ingrained and established as `` the normal , perfect way '' that you will find a lot of average people defending it out of their own will . 
  excuse me , does this bus not stop at the museum ? 
  the section you 're supposed to be monitoring is on fire !, 
  those neckbeards are voters and calling them losers is n't exactly the best method to convince them they 're wrong . 
  that 's how we got trump . 
  thanks mate !, 
  do the simgoober lots grow by themselves ? 
  believe what ? 
  that they are voters or that they are one reason for trump 's success ? 
  because both are true as far as i can see . 
  then we should not complain about the wage gap again , ever . 
  it 's just male and female nature in play . 
  upset or perhaps just wanting to point it out to prove that trp is true . 
  just mentioned the wage gap thing because there are aspects to the `` male and female nature '' theory that most women would not like to agree with . 
  you 're the man america will gladly thank for his sacrifice . 
  from europe , i sometimes dreamt about moving to la one time in my life . 
  i always think of it as an ethnically diverse , politically liberal , beautiful place with great weather , wide roads and cheap gas . 
  why must you shatter my dreams ? 
  for some people , being thin is standard and the most easy thing in the world , and gaining weight can be a challenge . 
  i do n't think the strength difference between men and women is 100 % , it 's more like 20-40 % . 
  in that dynamic , women can lead a life of extended childhood , just like housecats can live a life of extended kittenhood in a human 's home . 
  the story about the mom wanting something really bad and the dad deciding against it because it 's unrealistic in the above post gave me that impression . 
  an adult person should be able to assess what desire is unrealistic and what is not , if a wife wishes to buy something and the husband gets to decide if it 's unreasonable or not , like a little girl daugther and the adult father dynamic , gives me the creeps . 
  i definitely believe there 's been changes in the last 50 years or so . 
  there 's still a lot women who want a leader , so to speak , but that 's definitely not all women . 
  it 's not a hard-coded biological preference is what i like to believe . 
  i 'm sure sexual relationships with equally levelled leadership and decision makings are a lot more common than they were 50 years ago , even if the `` soft '' male leadership relation is also still very common . 
  well , the kind of woman that wants her boyfriend to decide where to eat out , what to do this evening . 
  the one who trusts her boyfriend to make the final decision on important stuff like household purchases , financial decisions and the like . 
  that sometimes likes to coast along , while still being a person able to make own decisions . 
  the kind of woman that knows she can be a follower but always disagree , and in the worst case , file a divorce and still be financially secure . 
  that kind of woman that knows she can call the cops and does n't have to be afraid of being physically abused , unlike a hundred years ago . 
  and unlike the traditional patriarchal househould with hierachies of `` god , then man , then woman '' that was described in this thread when someone talked about his parents ' relationship . 
  that was an example of what i imagine is `` soft leadership '' , as opposed to the patiarchal forms of past times . 
  are you indian ? 
  i think i remember you saying you were indian or desi heritage at one point , so i was curious . 
  i could be wrong though . 
  is that the place for truckers to pick up prostitutes ? 
  how do you get trees like that growing in the suburbs ? 
   undermine milo 's credibility by using his sexy boy-toy image against him and relegate him to the kiddy table , playing with his grandeur image . 
  what ? 
  i see that as using his apperance as an argument against him , rather than arguing against the points he makes . 
  that 's not a good thing . 
  ^ took me a while to search my plugin folder to find that out . 
  i have [ this one ] ( http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotget=2867 ) installed . 
  [ this one ] ( http://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotget=2849 ) , thanks . 
  wow , beautiful scenery . 
   when he 's caught he says he `` was just given that information '', 
  like with the sweden story . 
  `` noo , i have it from fox news '' . 
  as if that is a justification for anything . 
  [ http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/] ( http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/ ), 
  seriously , that 's your response ? 
  you can research each of their claims individually , they are backed up using mainstream press and official sources , and i 'm sure most of them will be valid points . 
  sure some are irrelevant , such as that he said he would n't redecorate the white house , but many of them are very relevant , and it 's an open truth that trump is a perpetual liar . 
  it 's like you 're doing everything you can to not believe it . 
  for gods sake , he said that the murder rate is the highest since 47 years , which is a blatant lie . 
  nope , that 's the one :, 
  [ http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-murder-rate-highest-47-years/] ( http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-murder-rate-highest-47-years/ ), 
  i do n't buy the `` it was just a mistake '' . 
  he 's the president . 
  his words have big consequences . 
  thanks .
