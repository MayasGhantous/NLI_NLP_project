  murderers are pretty unattractive to most western women . 
  no , i 'm not suggesting it 's wrong because they have different opinions . 
  i 'm suggesting they use arguments that are essentially non-falsifiable because nothing you could possibly say will make them change their view . 
  some claims can be falsified and proven wrong , but others can not , because they are non-falsifiable . 
  this is a great post describing what i mean better than i could :, 
    i believe that even women who claim to be sexually dominant themselves can fall to their knees if the right man comes along . 
   if someone gave you a bunch of examples , or even statistics , about sexually assertive women , you could still claim this . 
  literally 100 % of women could be sexually dominant and aggressive and you could still claim this . 
  women could go around raping men violently with robo-penises , forcing them to collectively go into hiding in a twisted dystopia , and you could still claim this - that the dystopian female rapist army just needs to `` find the right man '' and then they 'll become mewling kittens .

  hardly , lol . 
  but i 'm pretty sure i 'm right none-the-less . 
  huh ? 
  they are claiming it as facts , it 's the red pill belief aka , how the world really is like once you see through the feminist blue pill propaganda . 
  a lot of red pillers believe these claims are the singular truth of the world , and it 's very hard to convince them otherwise if they argue like this . 
  ok , where does he say that ? 
  i said the entire point was that many of the claims that terpers make are not falsifiable because of their nature . 
  the claim with women wanting to be dominated by high status males is one example that would be impossible to disprove even if we had all the data that showed completely opposite signs , because one could just say `` all these women have n't met the right alpha male , trp is still true '' . 
  that 's all i 've said , that many terpers use these kind of statements and most of them show no interest in having their view changed . 
  no strawmanning about it . 
  no , you 're right , i have n't seen the claim from terpers that all of trp is scientific , it 's a lot of emphasis on `` we try out and see what works best '' , but af/bb and 80/20 are definitely models used to describe `` how the world really works '' and scientific words such as the pareto principle are used . 
  what i said though , is that trp claims to hold the single truth , with direct or indirect words . 
  `` red pill '' is a synonym for the uncomfortable truth , while `` blue pill '' is the comfortable lie you 've been told . 
  `` realz before feelz '' is another term used to tell the viewers that trp might be uncomfortable , but in the end , the facts of how the world truly is . 
  scientific research from different fields is shown trp users to prove that `` trp truths '' are , in fact , real .

  do you happen to be from australia and just wish for the game to be set in your home country ? 
  okay , i was wrong then . 
  yeah , people who had limbs missing climbed the mt. 
  everest but this autistic dude should totally give up on finding a girlfriend , lol . 
  hot girls for chads , free bmw 's for everyone else . 
  i love how his height is included in the `` what did he do wrong '' part . 
   stating simple and objectively true facts . 
  the golden rule has been a long-standing virtue of traditional masculinity . 
  does n't make it good to become a follower of a strategy that can directly lead to other people getting hurt . 
  you can still be a good person even if many others are not . 
  putin is arguably pretty damn alpha and he 's commanding a country that 's successfully conquered parts of another country . 
  the meme that older married couples with children stop having sex exists just as well , in the west . 
  i think many older couples do n't have sex and that does n't equal to the man being sexually frustrated because of it . 
  the same thing can be said for women . 
  not all of them do n't give a shit about their men being `` good '' . 
  stats just say that 20 % of men are having sex with 80 % of the women is n't true . 
  most people end up in relationships with people roughly on their level in looks and socioeconomic status . 
  that 's why people debate this stance . 
  and settling down does n't mean you get the leftovers , a lot of women do n't want casual sex . 
  got ta be honest , your posts reads like what the prototypical parody red piller would say . 
  what would be the reason for there to be so many more unfit women than unfit men ? 
  on the national average , unfit people are about equally distributed . 
  how did you get in whatever field you are working in, 
  because tbp believes humans are so much more than just primates . 
  our ability to use intelligence , logic and self-consciousness makes humans a very special thing in nature and this is why there is so much more to human mating than just one alpha getting most females and most males getting nothing . 
  this is why there is no agreed scientific consensus that alphas and betas exist in humans . 
  yeah , i 've heard it all . 
  `` i hate this harsh truth , but it 's the truth '' is a common trp trope . 
  and that harems form is a statement made by many terpers including the rather right-winged youtuber black pigeon speaks . 
  but i have n't seen any credible evidence for this . 
  most people pair off after a while and most men have one partner , even where sex outside of a marriage is not outlawed or shamed . 
  the problem is `` alpha '' has no commonly agreed definition . 
  even different terpers have different definitions . 
  one definition i 've heard lately is `` alpha is anything that makes you successful with women '' . 
  going by that , it 's not a surprise that a man with traits that make you successful with women are successful with women . 
  that 's not an `` rp truth '' or shocking . 
  all in all , i just wanted to add some clarity on why the alpha male theory you stated is not a commonly agreed thing and is still being debated . 
  many other people see different things , and that 's why people still debate it . 
  okay . 
  some traits can statistically lead to men having more sex partners , on average . 
  these can be traits that are seen as attractive by a vast amount of women in the world . 
  such as : height , broad shoulders , symmetric faces , confidence , dominant behavior , social status , wealth , etc. 
  the same observation can probably be made with women , slim women with attractive faces , submissive behavior ( call it whatever you want ) probably have more sexual partners or sexual partners that are more `` alpha '' ( however you wan na define it ) than obese , deformed , unattractive women , on average . 
  however , these tendencies do n't prove that `` humans are only primates '' or theories such as 80/20 , afbb , to me . 
  i think humans constantly show that they are capable of going far beyond animalistic , primordial behavior . 
  women might want to fuck the manliest alpha out there , but millions pair off with `` lesser '' men ( trp 's terminology , not mine ) . 
  men might want to fuck every female they can possibly fuck to spread their seed as widely as possible , but millions stay faithful in monogamic relationships . 
  then there 's millions of men and women who are n't even that interested in sex and have other priorities that are more important to them . 
  they have ordinary relationships , and so many got other stuff going on instead of following their biological mating imperative . 
  overall , i do n't believe that the toppest of top men get all the women . 
  so many guys happen to have relationships and create offspring , from deadbeat drug addicts and lower class men to nerdy , unmanly university professors . 
  i think if you looked up serious sources and research , you would find that most men who reproduce in this day and age are not perfect stereotypical alpha males . 
  have you never been infront of a school and see the dads pick up their kids when the bell rings , and see completely normal , unspectacular men being fathers ? 
  i 'd like to redirect you to [ this good post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/6dr8aq/what_does_a_typical_single_mans_sex_life_look/di5ikb3/ ) regarding the `` beta gets sloppy seconds at 30 '' theory . 
  again showing that your experiences do n't match up with the things many others have seen . 
  if a woman has married at 26 , it 's likely she 's been dating her husband years prior . 
  15 % of women met their husband in high school . 
  again , alpha and beta has no real meaning to people outside of reddit 's pill subreddits . 
  there is no agreed definition and it can literally mean `` successful men are successful with women . 
  that proves that biology is winning '' and that does n't really prove anything . 
  pretty cool . 
  i guess it 's safe to say you 're more talented and dedicated to your craft than most of human population , and this goes a long way in getting a highly profitable career such as yours . 
  poor troy . 
  also , do you work in the game industry today ? 
   negative canthal tilt and retruded maxilla, 
  these guys are so lost . 
  their insane obsession with facial aesthetics and the belief that a bad midface equals lifelong loneliness or something is simply founded on the fact that you ca n't change these things , and god forbid you could actually change something that makes your life better . 
  instead the focus on facial aesthetics gives a nice justification to sit back and whine because `` there 's nothing i could possibly do , it 's everyone elses fault '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure a lot of them are within the autism spectrum . 
  60k a year is definitely above average as far as i know . 
  but i agree there is a class divide between rp/bp .
