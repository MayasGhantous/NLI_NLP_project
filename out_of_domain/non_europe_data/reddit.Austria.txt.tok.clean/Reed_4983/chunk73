  why are you still using that stupid okcupid data for your claim that male sexual inequality is greater than women 's ? 
  the data clearly showed that men were rated more diversely than women were , meaning that each man was found attractive by at least a small number of females . 
  the same man that was rated 3/10 by a lot of chicks was also found hot and given an 8/10 by a different chick . 
  do you have any sources for that , other than your own impression ?

   there is much more consensus among men about whom they find attractive than there is among women , according to a new study by wake forest university psychologist dustin wood . 
   from personality information : does it influence attractiveness ratings of various body sizes ? 
   females selected wider attractive ranges than males,

   in the little test i did , not scientific but still illustrative , guy 1 had marks ranging from 2-8 , guy 2 had marks ranging from 3-8 , guy 3 had marks ranging from 2-9 , guy 4 had the most consistent marks , but still had marks ranging from 3-7 , guy 5 had marks ranging from 1-9 .5 ( !, 
  ) , and guy 6 had marks ranging from 2-7 . 
  from what i 've read in this thread , the tinder study is pretty unreliable , made by an unknown `` sexologist '' . 
  still , there 's reasonable grounds to believe the opposite is true , that women have less consensus on which men are attractive . 
  most scientific sample sizes are a few hundred or at most a few thousand people . 
  you ca n't interview all 150 million women in america . 
  and i did n't say they represent all , i only said that this data is `` aiding the theory that women 's sexual likings are less diverse than men 's . '', 
  but it 's somewhat conflicting to the study that u/gryphonosaur was talking about . 
  i 'd love your theory to be true !, 
  the funny thing is that burns is actually the guy that everyone hates . 
  i sure hope someone got fired for that blunder . 
  please not even more german dominance in f1 . 
  i 'm sorry , sir . 
  if all men are collectively robbed and disadvantaged , what stops them from voting parties into power which will stop this so called breach of social contract ? 
  another possible explanation would be that most men simply do n't feel like they are being robbed or cheated within the social contract , and thus do n't raise their voice in this matter . 
  and it 's not only the us , a lot of countries in europe have even stronger social systems with higher levels of taxation , and more accessible political systems where small parties and movements stand a chance of bringing their voice into play or even to compete for office . 
  and while the welfare state and its effects are a hotly contested issue here , there are no hints of any kind of gender war emerging , or men as a whole feeling they are cheated by a feminist , welfare state agenda in comparison to women . 
  yeah , i honestly do n't believe an almighty pc agenda is keeping large swaths of men from speaking out against the welfare state ripping them off , or against child custody being distributed unfairly - these are very uncontroversial topics and i 'm sure if they were highly problematic and destroying millions of lives , people would speak out about it . 
  other than the general subject of higher vs. lower taxes , and a bigger vs. a smaller state , which is constantly on the public agenda . 
  it 's not like most people perceive this as a massive redistribution from men to women either - you should know you very much hold a niche opinion in that regard , because most people would tell you that the welfare state also helps a lot of men , who are unemployed , in need of medical care or receiving other forms of assistance . 
  the fact that more men are tax payers does not change the fact that the welfare state ( at least in my part of europe ) has helped a huge amount of people , men and women . 
  i have n't looked into whether european media portray trump unfairly . 
  i 'm able to read american sources for myself , as do many young people , but it could be possible . 
  i 'm pretty sure western media had a strong anti-russia bias back when the ukraine crisis was still a hot topic , so there 's one example . 
  25 % of men being incels sounds too high to me , seeing as most men have partners in their lives . 
  what makes you so sure a lot of today 's men do n't want children ? 
  some women would still want to hit up with him , yeah , but not all of them . 
  and certainly even less if he would act like a complete aspie outside of tinder , in real life . 
  behaviour makes a massive difference even tho appearance matters . 
  thought so too , but i did n't see it happen when trying out an international match in 17 . 
  he 's obviously got a massive cock . 
  that 's football . 
  325 upvotes is `` measly '' ? 
  it 's a good result . 
  good that they tell me it 's a classic on the box , otherwise i would n'tve known . 
  the issue with your claim is that the 14 % of men who receive messages are not one consistent group , at least the data does n't show that . 
  women have liked only 14 % of all men , but this group of men is unique for every woman on the dating site . 
  a man might get rejected by most women but still belong to one woman 's `` top 14 % of men '' . 
   i didnt say `` wont date '' , i said women are only attracted to the top 20 % of men . 
  they can certainly date them . 
  the betabux thing is entirely based on that . 
  just because a woman does n't approach a man , it does n't mean she ca n't be attracted to him . 
  do you have any reading material on the patriarchal nature of hippie culture ? 
  seems intriguing , never heard of that before . 
  there 's actually a lot of films with bad female characters , both now and when i was growing up in the late 90s-early 2000s . 
  feminism encourages this too . 
  because shy women do n't exist . 
  some feminists are hypocrites , and some policies enacted in countries that were backed by feminism can cause damage to men , such as feminists fighting against paternity tests , or feminism diminishing domestic violence against males . 
  there 's certainly a lot of problems with the big movement that is feminism , but i do n't believe that most feminists truly hate men . 
  and speaking from my experience , i just do n't see mainstream hollywood movies having too many evil men and not enough evil women . 
  a lot of feminists support women playing villain roles in movies . 
  there 's also a lot of women not active on dating apps , who have regular boyfriends . 
  my point is that a lot of them find their boyfriends attractive even tho they did n't approach them . 
  my bad , i thought you meant to say that women are not attracted to their boyfriends because the boyfriends did the first approach when they met . 
  sex and gender are different things . 
  they want to change their sex ( hormones ) which is biological , but gender is not . 
  dumb question , but what exactly is a grad student and how is it different to a regular college student ? 
  he 's talking about an offer for shooting more stock photos . 
  ok , i was confused because in europe , you often do n't have to pay or teach for your master 's degree . 
  there are master programs just like your bachelor studies . 
   it would be nice if society did not sugarcoat it . 
  just straight up tell boys growing up that society could not give less fucks about them unless they made themselves into something that people want or need . 
  and if they do n't they are shit out of luck . 
  `` society '' does not sugarcoat it because a lot of members of said society do n't believe this is true . 
  a + cope , i give you 9 out of 10 stars . 
  back then they did n't have the internet to cry about their woes , and in the past people were generally less in touch with their feelings and aware of their mental problems and hindrances , which means they were less likely to seek help and spread awareness . 
  40 y/o virgins are rare back then and now . 
  says the poster with a weaboo-ish username , lol . 
  what 's with the `` jaws are becoming weaker '' ? 
  is it about the sluthate incel theory that mouth breathing leads to less developed jaws ? 
  what if i told you i know a guy with a very weak jaw who has a smokin hot girlfriend though, 
  lol i read that as labor and selfies . 
  the democrats ' views on abortion are left even by european standards imo . 
  you must n't post the full exchange , you have to leave some of it for commenters to post to reap that sweet , sweet karma . 
  hey , how did you stumple upon this old comment ? 
  haha . 
  i 'm sure there 's a tutorial on how to do that , but i have n't done it myself . 
  but it costs 50 bucks or so to go to a shop to do it for you . 
  from a german car show on tv . 
  omg thank you !, 
  i was looking for this for-fucking-ever !, 
  solved !, 
  absolutely stunning mate , both the scenery and the car . 
  very clean . 
  what bumpers/skirts are that ? 
  that 's it young man , no bible stories for you tonight !, 
  teachers do . 
  travelling abroad at a certain time in your age ( such as when you 're a student ) does n't mean you will wake up at the late 20s with no qualifications . 
  that 's a bit extreme . 
  i 'm guessing because of this imbalance a lot of guys there will be alone for most of their lives ? 
  that 's horrible .
