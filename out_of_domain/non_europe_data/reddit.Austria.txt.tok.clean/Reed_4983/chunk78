  nobody ever mentioned anything about trading to me , and i hardly have any known places on my map . 
  so i try to travel to `` diamond city '' , because i hope it 's a big place , and on the way i find a settlement ... covenant . 
  i enter the town and the mayor tells me they have a shop and a doctor . 
  finally , i think , i can buy some stuff . 
  bottle caps are desired in this world , so surely the shop must be well-advertised for everyone to see it on the first glance - but - no trace of the shop . 
  i want to try out the houses , but : every house is locked . 
  i sleep for 8 hours until day . 
  but : all houses are still locked . 
  i do n't have the possiblity to ask anyone in the settlement `` where is the shop ? 
  '' , not even the mayor . 
  and on top of that , the annoying guy `` honest dan '' tells me `` got a proposal for ya '' like 20 times in 3 minutes . 
  even though i already told him : `` no ! '', 
  and my camera focuses to him every time !, 
  i 'm no newbie to rpg 's , i 've played like 500 hours of skyrim . 
  but i 'm really annoyed right now . 
  rant over . 
  ** edit : ** the shop building is open now , after having restarted the game . 
  probably one of those typical bugs in the early life of a game . 
  hey . 
  i occasionally like reading vn 's or playing eroges , and the two i 've really liked so far were `` yin yang !, 
  - x-change alternative '' and katawa shoujo . 
  while they were pretty good , both were set in the typical japanese high school environment . 
  since i 'm getting older and the teen drama stuff is getting boring , i 'm looking for something set in a university or college like environment with people who are distinctively older than in the stereotypical high school novel . 
  i 'm thinking of 20 + or 25 year old university students . 
  can anyone recommend me a novel like that ? 
  english translated ones if possible . 
  oh yeah , and adult content is what i 'm looking for . 
  i got a new hard drive today and installed it into my pc , but the problem is , there was barely any space left , and there 's some other problems too . 
  i had two empty hd slots , and only one was available because the mainboard power supply ( or something ) blocked the other slot . 
  the problem now is that because my gpu is right next to it , there was barely any place to fit in the sata cables . 
  as a result , i had to bend them pretty hard , which i hope wo n't do any damage . 
  another result is that the hard drive is now slightly angled , and i ca n't screw it into place on the other side . 
  the next problem is that i did n't have the correct screws , so i used some which looked similar to fixate the hard drive on one side . 
  they fit , but it 's not perfect - a little loose and only screwed on one side , but is that a problem , as long as i do n't move the pc ? 
  what else could i do to fix the narrow space issue ? 
  [ ** picture of the situation here ** ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oognpqd.jpg ) , as you can see , the upper hard drive is slightly tilted and there 's almost no space between hd and gpu . 
  on a positive note , the hard drive is already formatted and working . 
  hello , i need to write a paper reviewing a ** recent ** empirical study which serves as an example for an interpretive / antipositivist approach ( such as weber and simmel ) . 
  can someone hand me some advice on what to look for when searching for these kind of studies - how is the research done , what methods are used ( qualtitative , etc. ), 
  and how the authors would phrase their conclusions , all that ? 
  i would be very glad for any kind of tips . 
  hi , so since the recent update came , i installed a new scripthook and ragepluginhook , but the game still crashes on startup . 
  i installed all my previous mods in the seperate mods folder - renaming that folder successfully starts the game . 
  so the problem lies in my mod folder , and all my . rpf files in there . 
  are they not suited for the update ? 
  if yes , how do i play the new version with all my modded cars ? 
  do i have to put in every modded car in the new rpf files manually ? 
  hello , redditors from russia , i hope you can help me with this . 
  this is a video i saw many years ago , and today popped into my head again . 
  it 's very shocking footage from heavy abuse to - what appears to be - soldiers of the russian armed forces by non-commissioned officers . 
  this abuse in the russian forces is known as dedovshchina as you 'll surely know . 
  this is the video i mean :, 
  [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0w2c9hwuuq] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0w2c9hwuuq ), 
  i have n't been able to find more information on this footage : where is it from ( which unit ? 
  which place ? 
  ) , from which time , what happened to the ones involved , etc. 
  one description on youtube says it 's from 1995 , and it appears to be from a tv report . 
  if this was aired on tv , what were the consequences of it ? 
  note i 'm talking of this specific footage , and not of dedovshchina in general . 
  i would be very glad if anyone of you could give me some more information on this . 
  hello . 
  i 'm interested in the lives of people living in the post-war iraq ( since 2003 ) , and i 'm looking for stories about non-military , iraqi protagonists and their daily lives in modern iraq . 
  so not american soldiers or resistance fighers , but ordinary civilians . 
  how they live , what they think about their country , the war , their occupiers , religion , terrorism , bombings , global conflicts and the political situation . 
  how they cope with the difficulties of living in a country stricken with violence and suffering . 
  i 'm thinking of young people growing up , developing their ideas , aspirations and dreams and trying to fulfill them while also trying to handle the circumstances they live in . 
  from another thread , i found `` the american granddaughter '' from inaam kachachi , which looks interesting and kind of close to what i was thinking of . 
  do you have other suggestions ? 
  having just rewatched skyfall , the scene with m 's speech before the inquiry board was n't only pretty nice to hear alone . 
  it 's the way it 's presented in the film that makes it a pretty powerful scene . 
  you have m talking about the importance of her department and how it is still relevant for battling the threats the nation faces day to day , while bond emerges out of the underground and rushes to m 's location as fast as he can . 
  at the same time we see cops arriving and closing off the scene of accident , firemen rushing down the tube station , and ambulances arriving with flashing lights . 
  as silva and his accomplices start shooting in the inquiry board , wee see policemen getting shot and trying to fend off the attack , bond arriving and shoving a gun towards eve and firing back to protect m and the others at the place , and later mallory doing the same . 
  the whole scene gave a great impression of `` one team '' on the same side , working to fend off the assault of terror , crime and violence against the population . 
  policemen , firemen , medics , mi6 agents all together being on the spot whenever needed and putting their lives on the line to preserve public safety , public peace and law and order . 
  i 'm really no nationalist , but the short scene gave an overall great impression of a nation and its servants working together for a common purpose , even as aggressive foes try to undermine these very things . 
  excuse if this notion was posted here before , but i wanted to know if others felt similar about it . 
  hey , so i just encountered a strange little bug in forza 6 . 
  after buying the civic type r ( ep3 ) , i was doing a couple of laps on different tracks , trying to set some good lap times as usual . 
  this is a car where you can see the mileage on the gauges pretty clearly in cockpit view , and i noticed it was much higher when i switched from one track to another . 
  i was driving on silverstone , and when i ended the race , the mileage was at 293.0 km ( 182 miles ) . 
  but when looking at the car stats in the menu , it suddenly showed 319.25 km ( 198 miles ) in the menu as well as in another race . 
  obviously i do n't mind as the mileage does n't matter , but if i were the real owner of the car , i would be pretty pissed , haha . 
  did you ever encounter this bug ? 
  hey , i 'm looking for an american film i saw ages ago about a friendly alien coming to earth , somewhat similar to e.t. 
  it was likely from the 80 's or 90 's and it was about a single person who gave the alien shelter , and he first wanted to film him , but the alien of course did n't want to be filmed and destroyed the camera . 
  the guy later filmed the alien while he was ( singing ? ), 
  in the bathtub , using a hidden little camera device that looked like a pen , from his chest pocket . 
  but later decided not to release the footage . 
  the film had comedy elements and a rather light mood . 
  can anyone help me with finding that film ? 
  okay , [ so this is a video by a lifestyle / relationship coach from germany ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uudnjfrzvmi ) . 
  he specifically targets young men who want to meet women , men who are often afraid of approaching women . 
  i found this guy pretty reasonable at first , because he gave solid advice on how to approach women , and he even said that he does n't think too much of the pick up artist-culture , because it 's manipulative and `` relationships should be just about two people feeling well with each other '' , but this video from him struck me as very red pill and was one reason i lost some interest in his videos . 
  since most of you will probably not speak german , i will describe the key statements of this video for you :, 
  according to psychology professor steven pinker , ** there exist only three types of relationships among humans . 
  ** there is the relationship of equality , one which exists between siblings and between friends , the relationship of exchange , which exists between a businessman and his customer , and the relationship of dominance , which exists between parents and kids , or between a boss and his employee . 
  he then goes on to say that when pursuing a relationship with a woman , a man should always focus on being in the dominant role and assuming the relationship of dominance , because ** `` dominance is a part of sexuality , and it is the masculine part '' ** . 
  in regards to sexuality , ** `` a woman will look for a man she can devote herself to , she can surrender herself to '' ** this is also the reason why sometimes female employees start relationships with their bosses , because bosses are dominant to them , which women look for in a relationship . 
  women want to relieve themselves of responsibility when being with that man , to be led by a man and feel like a little girl again .
