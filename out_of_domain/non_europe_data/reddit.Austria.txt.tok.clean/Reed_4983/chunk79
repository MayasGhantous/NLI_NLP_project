  he continues to emphasize ( at least three times in the video ) that this is not meant in a derogatory way , it is only related to the sexual part , a woman still has agency and can still make her own decisions . 
  the dominant part is in no way better than the submissive part -- it 's more like positive and negative electricity . 
  he also says that `` it is not misogynist , because we would n't be watching these videos unless we loved women '' . 
  another justification for this `` female need to dominance in a relationship '' is later given when he says that women have a lot of responsibility on their shoulders these days , so it 's a relief for them when they can drop that responsibility when being with a man . 
  ( i 'm very critical here because i 'd say men also have a big chunk of responsibility they would like to drop at times ), 
  he then names some examples in which this advice can be applied . 
  when going out with a girl , a guy should make the decision on where to eat , and even if she says `` i wanted to go to this place '' , he should stick to this decision and go to the place he picked . 
  that does n't mean he ca n't adjust his decision when unexpected things occur , such as if his place is closed , but he should stick to the leader role . 
  ** because even if a woman would appreciate if you follow her choice , in the long term , it would be bad for the relationship , because the dominant role would fade , ( `` the sexual spark would be gone '' ) and because `` a woman has a desire for male dominance '' . 
  in conclusion , he advises his male viewers to follow this role . 
  he also says that if they have a girlfriend , it is very likely that they were dominant at one point and this is what made their girlfriend attracted to them in the first place . 
  for example by being humorous , which is also a form of dominance . 
  he also warns men of ever dropping that dominant role , because then , the relationship would become to a `` relationship of equality '' , as described in the beginning , like a relationship between brother and sister , and the sexual spark would be gone . 
  ( this part i see especially dangerous , because it could instill fear that letting your relationship be `` too egalitarian '' would be somehow bad ) . 
  there will be a drive for a more egalitarian relationship by the woman or by the man , or by both , but it would still destroy the relationship . 
  the video has mostly upvotes and most of the comments agree with him , one woman even writing that `` i can agree with this one . 
  the attraction fades with domestication of the man `` . 
  overall , what are your opinions on it ? 
  i decided to write this after i had read in the `` reddit gender issue sphere '' regularly for quite some time , mostly on ppd , and i started to notice some distinguishable patterns or tactics - debating devices - that were repeatedly used by posters coming from the red pill camp in a systematic fashion . 
  while this should not suggest that these tactics were created on purpose or from a vile motivation , they are used by red pill posters to defend , promote and positively depict their views and their agenda in a noticeable fashion , and by multiple posters . 
  i tried to summarize some i picked up while browsing reddit , not to object to trp views or attack red pillers , but to shed some light on the debates here and how different sides represent their views from an observational perspective , and in an way as objective as possible . 
  i focused on behaviors that i observed from posters from the `` red side '' , because i found them the most interesting . 
  if anyone from the red ( or any other ) side has observed other patterns used by the `` blue side '' , i 'd be intrigued to hear them too . 
  or if you noticed other patterns from the red side , you 're welcome to share them as well . 
  the paper will be accompanied by some posts i linked to , and while they are few , they should stand in as hopefully good examples of more widely used patterns . 
  the first debating device could be called : ** constant crisis awareness ** . 
  it is used is to reproduce the claim that the western world ( north america , most of europe and parts of asia ) is in the midst of a large and extensive crisis in the area of relationships and gender relations . 
  the group which is affected most severely by this crisis is young , single men , especially those who struggle for sexual experiences , but also men in existing relationships , as well as divorced men . 
  the ones affected in the most brutal way are the `` incels '' -- young men who are frustrated , unsuccessful and helpless on the relationship market . 
  men not only struggle for love and affection , but also for their `` identity '' , their roles as men and the role of manliness in general . 
  the picture drawn with this tactic is one of an emergency situation , illustrated by coupling it with anecdotal stories of men and women unhappy with their relationships or data about divorce rates as well as birth rates . 
  admittedly , declaring a crisis exists can be seen as more of an assertion than a discussion tactic , but this declaration is often used in a subtle way , often in threads about completely different topics , with the underlying statement of `` obviously our current system does not work , and it 's only natural we need a replacement . '', 
  [ example 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/3o04b8/thought_experiment_for_bp_if_elliot_rogers_and/cvstf6w ) , [ example 2 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/4yxja9/do_you_think_this_topic_sums_up_the_red_pill/d6s5wog ) , [ example 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/3vzmif/archetypal_alpha_males_really_do_exist_trp_is_not/cxs7edv ), 
  ** appeal to history ** . 
  this device is about the claim that trp ideas were `` always existent '' , and were even the societal norm and the standard of what was held as the truth before the `` rise of feminism '' , such as in the `` glorious '' 1950s . 
  `` if it was good enough for my grandpa , it sure as hell is good enough for me '' and `` feminism is the aberrant ideology , for trp has been around much , much longer '' are two exemplary statements that could fall into this pattern . 
  these statements ignore that old societal structures were not replaced without a reason and that they were often based on religious thinking or what we would say are archaic , outdated ideas . 
  it also ignores that the historical pictures used are often distorted or biased . 
  one example would be the patriarchal christian family structure , in which the man was officially the unquestioned leader of the household . 
  yet you often found women being the actual heads of these families -- this situation is not new nor was it exceptional in other times . 
  there is even a specific term for it in german : `` unter dem pantoffel seiner frau stehen '' . 
  another issue with this way of arguing is that even in these times , trp ideas and statements would not have been all deemed acceptable on societal discourse . 
  i refer to statements along the lines of \u201e women are good keep the belly full and the balls empty , conversation with them is futile `` , or \u201e women can not love like men `` . 
  intertwined with this way of arguing using -- often distorted -- pictures of history is a deep romanticization and glorification of past times . 
  the times of patriarchal structures and before the emergence of emancipation are characterized a glorious time of potent , confident and true men . 
  [ example 1 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/theredpill/comments/3nrgws/all_men_must_have_a_purpose_even_if_that_purpose/cvqxd0d ) , [ example 2 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/theredpill/comments/2x0m93/at_the_age_when_women_hit_the_wall/cox0bqq ), 
  ** appeal to success ** . 
  naturally , success stories are an important element of movements such as trp , which seek to gain new members . 
  without chances of success , the movement would have lost its cause . 
  yet , the device of `` appeal to success '' comes in different forms with different natures . 
  one form is to reproduce the claim that trp ideas , opinions and behaviours are only being scorned on the web , by blue pillers , in an exceptional , rare fashion , while they are able to achieve excellent results with women in real life . 
  this is even true for behaviours which can be seen as disrespectful towards the person the behavior is aimed at . 
  one example by trp poster `` archwinger '' is a post that read like : `` real women giggle when i tell them the patronizing things i say on trp '' . 
  these claims are based on different kinds of anecdotal evidence -- either posters * own experience * , or the poster 's * own observations * of his surroundings . 
  the second kind can be a method to preemptively stall any criticism of limited , anecdotal evidence -- for example , with the statement : `` this is how things are , i see it not only with myself but with every couple i know and everyone i have met in the last 30 years , and every one of my friends has observed the same for many years . '', 
  another form of this device is to ascribe trp behavior to successful people . 
  famous people , actors , politicians , people who `` made it to the top '' , achieved their success thanks to the `` trp mindset '' . 
  one example is [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/2ogk0r/terry_crews_on_masculinity_and_manhood_what_does/cmnhgv0 ) by a poster who claimed that actor terry crews was a `` terper '' throughout his whole career and then hypocritically points out the importance of expressing your feelings as a man . 
  the message is `` every man that is successful with women , or in life in general , either got very lucky or is a terper , even if he has never heard of trp . 
  this proves that trp is correct . '' one will notice that within the trp sphere , there seems to be sparse room for alternate ways to success , as trp seems to deal in absolutes in a striking fashion . 
  while claiming to be a movement for all men , methods or behaviors unfitting to the traditional male ideal are rarely acknowledged in general . 
  [ example 2 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4g88p8/april_24th_2016_rtheredpill_a_look_at_what/d2fmsqf ) , [ example 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4g88p8/april_24th_2016_rtheredpill_a_look_at_what/d2fo1df ) , [ example 4 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4g88p8/april_24th_2016_rtheredpill_a_look_at_what/d2fkt5t ) , [ example 5 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/4lu06i/should_terpers_talk_about_red_pill_fight_club/d3qnk7x?context=3 ), 
  ** just anger phase ** : this tactic is used to deal with statements within the trp sphere that are clearly and openly misogynist , misanthropic and hateful , and will likely be considered so not only by the stereotypical `` triggered sjw '' , but by the general population . 
  using this tactic , these statements are claimed to have been made by new , rookie trp members and therefore , are not relevant to trp ideology and not a valid reason to criticize trp . 
  this `` anger phase '' is claimed to be a natural reaction of the `` innocent man '' to the true biological nature of humans and most importantly , the true nature of women ( such a hypergamy and the female `` dual mating strategy '' ) , combined with the `` feminist , gynocentric '' propaganda that had taught this man that women are good beings and `` being a nice guy '' would lead to relationship success and satisfaction ( such as the disney movies he saw in childhood ) . 
  essential to this tactic is the claim that the anger phase just the beginning stage of the `` trp way '' , but that any `` real '' terper will leave it in due time . 
  summarized : the anger phase is a necessary evil , but not an actual goal of trp . 
  this line of thought ignores not only that -- as one will realize -- objectively hateful statements are a norm rather than an exception in the trp subreddit , but also that even moderators and endorsed contributors have noticeably made such statements . 
  this in turn , was once justified with the explanation that extreme statements by moderators are not meant literally , but were specifically directed at `` anger phasers '' . 
  [ example 1 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/2wc46u/im_a_feminist_man_who_thinks_that_trp_actually/copkn6p?context=3 ) , [ example 2 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/2wqmr8/why_do_red_pill_men_think_hypergamy_is_an/cot9055?context=10000 ) , [ example 3 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/3pvh97/thoughts_on_trp_and_the_angerphase/cwa69pf?context=10000 ), 
  ** just a hyperbole ** or ** a convenient shorthand ** : this is a very popular way of arguing which enables posters to deal with trp statements that can reasonably be considered generalizing , absolutist , unscientific , and systematically irrefutable , without having to openly reject or oppose these statements . 
  an intended exaggeration , hyperbole or generalization , which was deliberately made `` for reasons of comprehensibility '' , is suggested . 
  `` it was to get a point across '' . 
  it can be used to relativize own statements , or statements made by trp ` leaders ' -- moderators or endorsed contributors -- so that a clear dissociation is not necessary . 
  while one could suspect that this device acts as `` defence of trp to the outside '' , it is interesting to note that the use of hyperboles can also cause distortion among people identifying with trp , as there have been several discussions on whether the `` awalt '' principle is to be taken literally or not . 
  just as with the `` anger phase '' device , trp posters sometimes like to point to the `` rookies '' , and say that points are deliberately exaggerated to give new members a much desired ` wake-up call ' ( [ example given ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/theredpill/comments/4mtn79/meta_so_theres_a_post_by_a_mod_of_rrelationships/d3y7vde?context=3 ) ), 
  [ example 1 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/4wq4rp/bad_arguements/d697xuk ) , [ example 2 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/theredpill/comments/1f7ch8/i_feel_like_youre_only_allowed_to_be_vulnerable/ca7kghr ), 
  ** but i love women ** : this is a popular device used to preemptively quash accusations of misogyny . 
  the message is that trp can not be misogynist , as its members feel attracted to women , want to be close to women and women to be part of their lives . 
  `` but i love women '' is one exemplary statement . 
  one important element is a strong emphasis on ( biological ) sex differences , to purportedly remove the hostile aspect of negative attributions to women -- such as by stating `` i love women for what they are , i do n't want them to be men , i 'm not gay ! '', 
  by stating `` i do n't want women become men '' , it enables one to define many different traits as primordially and distinctively `` male '' . 
  these traits are often the ones generally acknowledged as good and worthy , such as : courage , drive , ingenuity , honor , organizational skills , logical thinking , rationality , active life management and `` true love '' . 
  using this almost * doublespeak * - like tactic makes it possible to paint a dismissive statement about women in a seemingly positive , affectionate coat -- in the same breath . 
  exemplary statement : `` i love women for the beautiful emotional creatures they are , for their carefreeness and warmth . '', 
  it has to be mentioned that posters in the red pill sphere do attribute actual positive traits to women . 
  these are mostly stereotypical traits in accordance with the `` traditional female '' role model , and fit the archetype of the `` caring , nurturing and warm-hearted mother and housewife '' . 
  however , these definitions of ` the woman per se ' are many a time accompanied by a dismissive , belittling attitude towards them . 
  one example is trp poster archwinger , mockingly describing how he finished the typical `` womanly duties '' of a household -- such as washing the dishes , vacuuming the rooms , cooking and playing with the kid -- within a few hours and without any struggle , and that these easy duties are wrongly called `` the hardest job in the world '' ( [ link to post ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/theredpill/comments/2aj3ia/i_just_did_the_hardest_job_in_the_world_in_under/ ) ), 
  [ example 1 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/3cia7p/has_ppd_ever_ruined_your_day_before_made_you/cswnpmk ) , [ example 2 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/purplepilldebate/comments/4wq4rp/bad_arguements/d68zurf ) , [ example 3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/theredpill/comments/1zn5pi/i_am_about_to_blow_your_mind_how_trp_is_literally/ ) , [ example 4 ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/theredpill/comments/18d5ma/the_red_pill_dilemma/c8dubqs ) , [ example 5 ] ( https://archive.is/off1z ), 
  ** the harsh truth ** or ** realz before feelz ** : within this pattern , posters identifying with trp openly acknowledge that trp `` truths '' can be dreary , sad or even gruesome . 
  yet , dreary statements such as `` women will desert you if you show signs of weakness '' , `` a woman will always be on the lookout for a higher-tier man '' or `` women do not care if you are a good person '' still deserve to be asserted , for they are the objective , singular truth . 
  one will note that the term `` reals before feels '' already suggests that trp truths will very likely evoke emotions and appear repulsive or unsettling -- these reactions are rationalized by connoting seemingly cruel , absolutist statements with a sense of actuality unavoidable for those seeking truth . 
  it also aids in creating the illusion of a clear discrepancy between a comfortable , `` feely '' but completely unreal vision of the world -- one that has been `` drilled into our heads '' since childhood by an education system infected with feminism and gynocentrism , and an uncomfortable but truly objective singular truth based on logical thinking and resisting the pc narrative .

  hey , so today i reached wwii with my uk playthrough , and italy joined germany in the axis in september ' 39 , declaring war on the allies . 
  i decided to reinforce my troops in egypt , so i sent my 54th ( east anglia ) infantry division to africa using convoys . 
  i assigned a smaller carrier group as protection , with 2 carriers , 2 light cruisers and 17 destroyers . 
  after passing gibraltar , they were intercepted by a larger italian fleet , 2 old battleships , 2 old heavy cruisers and about 40 ( outdated ) destroyers . 
  i expected my fleet being able to deal with these incompetent italians , but unfortunately , they were badly mauled , as the italians kept reinforcing their fleet , totalling up to 85 ships .
