  has n't stopped these killings in european nations that have these laws . 
  education is what we need not laws on this front . 
  of course she should have , but like i said , gun distribution is a big problem . 
  there are just so many guns spread around your nation that criminals or rampage killers have an easy time getting them . 
   cool story . 
  i 'm betting you 're in europe . 
  the problem with this comparison is that very few people comparing european countries and the us realize how bad of a comparison that is . 
  cool story ? 
  that 's pretty cynical and disrepectul towards the victims of shooting sprees , do you realize that ? 
  let 's have a look at statistics . 
  germany has roughly 1/4 of the us ' population and has had 4 school shooting massacers since 2000 . 
  how many did the us have in that time frame ? 
  i counted over ** 140 ** . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_school_shootings_in_the_united_states#2000s ) . 
  of course other factors play a role . 
  crime rate and gang crime is higher in america , and perhaps there is also a bigger mental health problem ( like you said ) . 
  but it also has a lot more gun distribution and extremy loose gun laws . 
  so i plea you . 
  stop your `` a foreigner shall not criticize my beloved ` murica '' reflex . 
  just admit that mentally ill lunatics like elliot rodger or adam lanza getting easy access to guns is ** totally inacceptable ** . 
  they are just white . 
  europeans could get that as well , but they do n't deem it necessary . 
   i kinda addressed this . 
  we 're not the only ones with it , and it 's basically a `` stop talking about what you do n't know . '', 
  reflex . 
  i hope it 's obvious to you that you did n't know a lot about our guns and laws here . 
  you 've had misconception after misconception about how they work here and that is n't your fault . 
  it is your fault if you do n't recognize that and try to update your knowledge now that you 've been shown that it does n't work how you thought . 
  not much of what i said were misconceptions , at least not entirely . 
  i said that there are no background checks , which is true for private purchases , which pretty much means every lunatic can get a gun . 
  i said the consitution implemented the right to bear arms , which you agreed was the case ( and also ca n't really be changed ) and you also agreed that gun distribution is part of the problem ( and also ca n't be changed ) . 
  now your argument about school shootings is bascially exactly what republicans are arguing : `` these shootings wo n't stop , which means we need more guns , we need a better armed society so that everyone can defend himself . '', 
  i agree no-gun zones are a bad idea in a country as gun-riddled as the us ( also because , as i know , some shootings have been stopped by bystanders shooting back ) , but a whole nation with heavy gun restrictions and low gun distribution is n't . 
  that 's the case with the european union , which has a homocide rate of 1.3 , compared to 4.7 in the us . 
  of course we have a lot of other problems . 
  my beginning statement was that the us has a gun problem . 
  do i still believe that ? 
  yes , but now i know that there are other problems that also play into it , such as the ones you mentioned . 
  i also agree there is not much that can be done to lower gun distribution , as the consitution wo n't be changed and searching every house for guns would be a human rights violation , and the right to carry arms is sacred to most citizens . 
  but i still think it 's a relevant part of the problem . 
  latvian police is cruel . 
  is also corrupt . 
   those single moms are raising alpha genes . 
  the stupidity in that single sentence is mind-boggling . 
  i thought to become alpha you need to ` man up ' and learn the virtues of the red pill . 
  now it 's genetic ?? 
  inb4 terpers implement race laws . 
  these comments show how trp does n't only hurt women , but also men . 
  basically every man who is n't an egoistical asshole who only cares for his own benefits is a ` beta ' and deserves the worst coming to him . 
  also :, 
   with the welfare system i can impregnate as many women as i want and if they ca n't find beta bucks they 'll get government bucks , which are just beta bucks that have been taxed . 
  hurr durr screw logic in my world only betas have to pay taxes . 
  this is what the same poster wrote a couple days ago :, 
   now i 'm 32 and i actively avoid women over 30 , occassionally date women 25-30 , but most definitely prefer them under 25 , and if possible 18-20 , and i would go even lower if the law permitted it , as young fertile women is most definitely what i as a man am most interested in sexually . 
  no comment . 
  oh yeah , he also wrote that trp lifestyle is more healthy because it focuses on fitness . 
  at the same time he 's active in the ` steroids ' subreddit . 
  not a surprise , as trp 's social ideologies and pictures of women are pretty equal to the society the nazis imagined . 
  although probably even hitler would 've been a little shocked at how much they hate women . 
  some really reasonable points . 
  thanks for the intelligent discussion . 
  they fight bears , kayak , climb mountains or race cars semi-pro , but only on weekends when they 're not occupied with their high-salary stem jobs . 
  where is that animation from ? 
  yeah , i mean which one ? 
  doctor : i have some bad news for you . 
  you have cancer and you also have alzheimer 's . 
  patient : well , at least i do n't have cancer . 
  thanks , that was exactly what i wanted to know . 
  i wish my parents had done that ... but they were all like `` we love you the way you are '' ... screw them . 
  federal hiring guidelines ? 
  do these damns feds have to stick their noses into everyone 's business ? 
  just kidding , yeah op should report this , it 's inacceptable . 
  the exterior pictures are from the outlander sport , the interior is from the regular outlander ?? 
  youtube , too . 
  to be fair , he says he knows because he was told so after being threatened with a knife himself . 
  `` children , if you feel the need of nature , just use the bucket next to bart 's head . '', 
  how do you mean that ? 
  [ you 're more likely to inherit your dad 's social status than his height - social mobility is a myth . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/24/social-status-inherited_n_6211734.html ), 
  wealth is distributed more equally in europe , one reason being higher taxes and state welfare . 
  you said inequality is n't so bad because social mobility is given . 
  i and others have shown sources that social mobility is still very bad in the us . 
  the middle one is the best looking imo . 
  i do n't like the layout of your plates . 
  most of the cars i see are from brno , so the number plates are always like 2b and then only numbers follow . 
  it looks so untidy . 
  all numbers and letters need to be packed together !, 
  tell your parliament to change that , ok ? 
  tell that to the kurds . 
  afghanistan was a mess before 2001 as well . 
  what plot ensured peace ? 
  i think it 's not a very environmentally aware choice to always pick the items in the back , with the latest expiration dates . 
  the more people do this , the more stuff gets thrown away by the supermarket . 
  dying in japan sounds pretty epic . 
  in a volcano even more . 
  but 5 ' 6 is n't even `` really short '' . 
  it 's still above the average women 's height . 
  5 ' 4 and below is really short . 
  how do these people explain that most men will have sex and relationships during the course of their lives ? 
  the study also showed that 80/20 also applies to women , something not mentioned by trp .
