  sorry i am not familiar with american companies as an european pleb . 
  rip you guys .

  well done . 
  i hope to eventually also get that far . 
  you should read german facebook feeds sometime , they are horrible . 
  there are regularly users calling to kill foreigners or homosexuals and you can report those posts and literally nothing happens . 
  now these people are a minority in real life but on facebook they represent a broad mass of commenters . 
  this is an issue that needs to be addressed badly . 
  undercut as your first go to option . 
  from there you can try varying styles and that get shorter and if everything fails buzz and start over . 
  i highly recommend getting a short cut either ways because you look like a grill : , ),

  [ considering the frequent outages recently i think this is also fitting . 
  maybe the not the answer you are looking for but hold off major purchases for a month or two . 
  make sure you are constant around a certain weight before you buy new and expensive items . 
  you can say about money boy what you want but his music got a lot better and more entertaining since `` dreh den swag auf '' . 
  i personally really like `` choices '' . 
  you ca n't compare those two . 
  money boy is making parody music while left boy is making actual music . 
  thanks for the answer .

  my best guess ? 
  poor quality of the cutout and bad overlay and blending . 
  that 's what i thought . 
  well seems i will have to create a few new chars then . 
  too bad blizzard does n't let us have 1 shared stash tab and the rest unique ones for each char . 
  that would be heaven . 
  i am getting the sets to run t6 + rifts for every char effectively . 
  i never said i need every set .

  quick tip if anybody wants to do this in the future . 
  post the picture sideways or upside down , there are bots scanning the web for codes and auto use them . 
  100 % with you , i started doubting my choices recently because i liked limp bizkit but everybody else seems to be bashing them constantly .

  that is a good joke maybe tell it to mexico , afghanistan , vietnam or iraq . 
  at least germany tore down the iron curtain and did n't build one to keep mexicans out . 
  i really hope you are a troll and not a product of the american school system and media . 
  no it is n't . 
  what the nazi regime did while flying the swastika is so incredibly gruesome there should not even be a debate about this . 
  if you deny the holocaust please be welcomed here and check out the kzts , enter the gas chambers and check out the burners , check the books where the nazis kept up with the numbers of people they killed today or check the scratch marks in the holding and torture cells . 
  this ideology is on point with straight up calling to kill people and nothing should allow people to do so . 
  maybe you are okay living in a community where people deny the death of 6 + million people , where people are down with going out and lynching somebody because he is black or jewish but the vast majority of humans is n't .

  just going to leave my two cents here , as a native speaker you may have a chance getting a place at a school . 
  back when i was in school ( 2-3 years ago ) we would always have at least one native speaker around who would well ease up some of the english lessons once or twice a week .

  amazing work on the second one , how did you do that ? 
  did you mask the shape of her and just add chicken texture to it and blend the borders between the different parts ? 
  whop did n't see that . 
  thanks for the answer !, 
  why is using divine shield on a minion after attacking with it better against classes with no way to deal one damage ?
