  i have them like once every 2 months and they become longer and longer . 
  i always wake up in my bed and try to get up , then shortly after i get reset . 
  after each reset i more and more get the feeling that someone is in my flat looking for me and wanting to kill me . 
  with every reset i lose more control over my body and can not move anymore . 
  last time this has happened the loop continued about 30 times . 
  post some of the conversations so we can see what you are doing wrong . 
  also do n't expect them to write essays back , it 's just chatting . 
  if you want to get to know her seriously you should try and setup a meeting or date , asap . 
  i doubt you 'll be able to pass the german part of the abitur . 
  maths , english should n't be a problem but good luck interpreting 250 year old poems with b1 . 
  you should know that if you want to try it . 
  if the abitur is as similar to the matura as i think it is you will have to do english or french , german and maths in written form and another 3-4 subjects verbally . 
  i just read your spoken german is also bad , not to be rude but i think you wo n't pass . 
  in order to study at uni you should be min . 
  c1 anyways so maybe focus on getting that first . 
  ca n't really speak for other schools than the gymnasiums and there were a few native speakers that had troubles with the german part of the testing . 
  i have heard though that abiturs/maturas absolved in e.g. 
  evening schools are a lot easier . 
  very interesting , those are bigger differences than i expected . 
  i personally had english , maths and german in written form and english , psychology , religion and geography orally . 
  i wonder if there are big differences in regards to how much we had to learn , quantity wise . 
  i ca n't watch it but do n't you think that he probably gradually worked up to that point ? 
  like , if you ease somebody slowly into that situation it probably would n't be that weird . 
  proofing proficency in the german language and of your previous education to be of equal quality of the german abitur . 
  i mean that was literally a 5 second google search . 
  have you checked your browsing history yet ? 
  unless you manually disabled it your browser and google probably have records of you visiting that site . 
  yup 100 % legal , from your post i conduct he did not make you an buy offer at the original price . 
  as long as that did not happen you have no right to invoke the old price . 
  however if he had written you personally a letter offering to sell the car at the old price you would have the right to purchase it at that price . 
  honestly it is totally useless . 
  i stopped paying more than 250 $ for phones 3 years ago and never ever felt like i am missing out on something . 
  i never play games , pictures i take with the phone i only view on the phone and all the other tasks i actually use it for ( music , email and web application ) are performed on a very similar level by these mid range devices . 
  absolutely no reason to spend that kind of money on a phone . 
  that 's pretty sad considering what a legendary game wow is . 
  i always notice things while playing that seem to be so out of place , as if they just finished the alpha draft and just left it like that . 
  for example the loot window is tiny , why do i need to click arrows to see 6 different items ? 
  have there never been talks about reworking the ui to be , well better ? 
  yeah that was another thing i was really surprised about , the idea of being confined to one server or realm for this matter is a strange one but i can see why it would be problematic changing that from a structure point of view with some of the game mechanics , also with the realm based economics . 
  actually it 's sachsen aka . 
  yup ,

  he is right though , if you bothered to read red pill basics you 'd know that it is a philosophy and not a guide that you are supposed to blindly follow . 
  some things written there might work for you , some wo n't and some are just straight up bullshit , point is you should be able to read selectively , a skill useful all around and not just in trp . 
  yes totally in de f\u00fchrerzone . 
  jokes aside this has to mean nothing , i always hug female friends when meeting or leaving , does n't mean i have a thing for them or the other way round . 
  depends on which one it is .

  just read your other topic again : https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/54lxjr/oktoberfest_dress_search_help/?st=itom43za&amp;sh=de896928, 
  i 'd rather not, 
  i think you are a bit lost my child , but do n't worry i 'll help you get home .

  be sure to pack your cangaroo saddle , getting around without it will be a doozy . 
  also always have shrimps with you and use the to distract aggressive alp cows following you . 
  if i were you i 'd check if i were eligible for a work visa first and then worry about where i 'd work . 
  priests also , if you become a priest you 100 % get a job . 
  yes more often than you 'd think and it 's not just people coming to the wrong sub [ this ] ( https://imgur.com/sxcd9xr ) also happens way too often . 
  maybe , we are n't 100 % sure either . 
  reminds me [ of this 4chan post ] ( https://i.imgur.com/jxwjvoo.png ) and also you all are the worst . 
  i still can blame it on not being a native speaker . 
  i am very sorry for your loss op , maybe you like one of these .

  better start learning now , this will be a somewhat frequent occurrence , no or just an outdated english version of things .

  gone girl , because it actually can happen to you too . 
  seems like they do n't teach you anything about nazis and the third reich in your school . 
  disclaimer : not a grill , not viennese, 
  this and only this . 
  no matter if she actually is a terrorist or not you want to have a lawyer for terrorism charges . 
  then that 's it , unless she is actually a terrorist she should n't have to worry too much now , leaving the country may look a bit weird though . 
  and yes i know that she is n't being charged yet , sorry for my wording but you got the basic gist of what i meant , 
  why is there no plan on letting the community host their own servers much like cs : go ? 
  i think it would be okay if you disable xp gains and drops on non official servers but it would be nice to give some power to creators . 
  s a l t, 
  also depends on their agbg/tos . 
  to make it short , you are fucked . 
  you really just can hope somebody takes your case pro bono and somehow the companies whose products were defrauded somehow drop their charges . 
  most likely you will be charged with being an accessory to fraud and maybe fencing stolen goods ( iirc you sold some of the items ) . 
  you probably ( lets hope ) will get a fine instead of jail time ( depends on how much all the things were worth ) and then can declare private insolvency and setup a payment plan . 
  do n't and also get this case to some higher ups at that college . 
  this is borderline fraudulent what she is doing . 
  hat gut funktioniert . 
  hilfen is not a word , helfen on the other hand is . 
  either way good luck with your exam tomorrow .
