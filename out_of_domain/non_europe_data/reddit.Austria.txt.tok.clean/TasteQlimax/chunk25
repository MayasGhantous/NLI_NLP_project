  if you think this is even a remotely credible source you are a , and pardon my french , fucking retard . 
  edit : [ yeah nvm you are a fucking retard .

  and thus this article has to be seen in a somewhat different light . 
  do you by any chance have a non biased source for this story ? 
  yes , i prefer multiple sources , especially from parties that have nothing to gain from pandering possibly false news . 
  the item with the highest alch value gets protected by the item prayer iirc . 
  prayer is ridiculous fast if you use altars , like 400k + / h , agility now has more courses getting you around 60-70k / h , cooking is already pretty fast if you use sharks , firemaking , well yeah true but you need to click like once every 2 minutes . 
  yes , this is called a scheinehe and with your motivation a criminal offence according to [ \u00a7 95 \\ ( 2 \\ ) 2 aufenthg ] ( https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aufenthg_2004/__95.html ) . 
  just quick tip , get really really good gloves if you are going to bike around . 
  nothing worse than not being able to use your fingers to brake because you ca n't feel them anymore . 
  edit : \u00a7 27 stgb ? 
  uhm what do you think ? 
  are poisonous drinks sold in stores ? 
  aside from the regular intoxicating effects i would n't hope for much more . 
  you signed a contract , if you want to breach it the other party is entitled to reparations . 
  up to you really , do you enjoy court battles and losing them ? 
  do you enjoy paying a lot of money for literally nothing ? 
  no not really . 
  you signed a contract , that is binding legislature , they bring the case to court , court sends you a letter , if you do not respond or come to the hearing it is an admittance of guilt , you will be liable for any lost profit , damages , a fine and have to pay the costs for both parties and the court . 
  does that sound worth it ? 
  you decide . 
  [ swedish ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/pippi_langstrumpf ), 
  eh they are just imaginary points , worse things could happen . 
  but yeah everyday smarter :d, 
  if you enjoy waiting even longer i 'd say go for it , if you want to resolve it asap be as helpful and respectful as possible . 
  other way round , you as the guy telling us a story are supposed to give us several sources confirming the story . 
  well your choice what language it is in , preferably english or german since , well , those are the 2 languages mainly spoken here . 
  are you seriously judging me for wanting confirmation of something and not just believing anything i read on the internet ? 
  shocking , i know ... 
  only if she was a jew who was prosecuted by nazis and had to flee the country . 
  what 's the brazilian legislature regarding firing state employees like ? 
  i know in my country state employees can not be fired , judges are another whole different story as they have special rights compared to state employees . 
  could that be the reason for `` just '' a suspension ? 
  knobs out for winston !, 
  why did you not contact the staatsanwaltschaft for over a year regarding your case ? 
  lawyers do not have fixed prices , only way to find out is to ask one . 
  okay , so i did some reading on how auctioning off items works in germany and i think you did not tell us the whole story here . 
  if items are auctioned off it 's either because they come from some sort of criminal activity or because they were pawned by the state . 
  in either case there is communication with the previous holder of the items ( holder because you do n't have to be the owner automatically ) . 
  so did you throw away a letter from the staatsanwaltschaft , not read it closely or were you even sentenced to something regarding this case ? 
  alternatively they could have been [ unanbringbare gegenst\u00e4nde ] ( https://dejure.org/gesetze/bgb/983.html ) , did the staatsanwaltschaft have means of contacting you ? 
  sounds like they had no way of contacting you . 
  aufiw\u00f6hla fir di, 
  they are n't coming alone though so good luck with that . 
  a few years back it got so bad that people got seriously injured and the perpetrators could n't be found because of the masks so these days they all have to register and wear numbers so they can be identified if something serious happens again . 
  yeah except the loot is a big pile of hot , steaming shit . 
  i do n't care for a legendary upgrade giving me 4.58 % more poison damage , i want cool shit doing cool shit while feeling cool . 
  depends really , personally jeans as long as they are not dirty and do n't stink but for a week max , maybe switch between two pairs to `` air '' one out for a day then the other . 
  shirts etc. 
  daily for me , do n't want old sweat stuck to my skin for too long . 
  pro tip : do n't make other people exceed the speed limit like a twat then they do n't have to worry about speed cameras or section control . 
  not very much , they still are students after all . 
  even when you are a doctor in the beginning you wo n't earn very much , hence why most people go to other countries like switzerland or the uk . 
  it reminded me of the videogame `` haze '' if anybody remembers that .

  it does appear that she is a dominatrix , if you check her twitter bio she even says she does this on a professional level . 
  your conclusio is correct . 
  is this your homework ? 
  you made a translation error , she did n't stay in a youth hostel but in a flat that was looked after by the cps . 
  in addition to that they do n't walk free and they also are tried under juvenile law . 
  this article is beyond shit , it 's the sun , it 's written in a way to lure in people to click/buy not inform correctly . 
  sorry to burst your muslim rapefugee bubble in this case . 
  serbs are predominantly christian , just fyi . 
  no problem , maybe you can also add that the district attorneys ( or better said the regional equivalent ) already announced they are going into revision and the case most likely will be tried once again at a higher court . 
  sources :, 
  i then would recommend reading literally any other source than the sun , they are not known for their quality journalism . 
  as to your stereotype of serbs , i can not say anything about that . 
  a lot of serbs live in my neighbourhood and they all are honourable and law abiding people , i wo n't doubt there are bad ones , just not more or less bad than some germans or in my case austrians . 
  it nowhere says that they are immigrants , maybe they are maybe they are here on holiday , who knows . 
  they are not walking free , once again , the sun has written a horribly bad piece of `` journalism '' . 
  they also should n't be dead , the death penalty was abolished for a reason . 
  to add to all of that the district attorneys already announced going into revision , the whole process will be held again in the next higher instance of court . 
  in a comment further down i wrote that we ( at least from the information released ) do not 100 % know if they were immigrants . 
  i prefer making less assumptions in serious cases like these and base stuff more on things i actually know , but you are right . 
  i personally disagree , especially at young age like this . 
  while they are horrible human beings they are at an age where they are very , very impressionable , juvenile detention and intensive counseling and care are the primary way of handling these things in the european continental criminal law . 
  i know it 's horrible but this is also why we need a jurisdictional system that is able to focus on existing laws and rules and does not let itself be guided by feelings . 
  i know i could n't do that and i respect people who think and try to do exactly that because it is hard as fuck . 
  there is a plethora of reasons to go into revision or similar things , i am not too familiar with the german procedural law so i ca n't give a sound comment on that but i reckon the das know what they do . 
  now i am curious too . 
  no but [ 3,1 % muslims ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion_in_serbia ) according to the last census seems pretty low and rather unlikely that it had anything to do with this case . 
  yeah no , they closed down over 15 years ago so that probably is n't good anymore . 
  just buy a fresh can of beer . 
  doubt it . 
  value comes from history and stories , ca n't see this small brewery providing very much of either . 
  why do they have cars that are ied proof ? 
  okay, 
  the germans and we are like brothers . 
  we beat each other up , we prank each other , we try and make our lives harder than they need to be but if there are hard times or the other one needs your help we are there for each other . 
  no question asked . 
  a burden we have to carry , in this case 2 different glasses . 
  worth it though , if you can afford it even consider eye surgery . 
  i am currently saving up for one and am excited as shit . 
  if they say no once without giving a plausible reason they just do n't want to or it feels like it 's too much of an effort to them . 
  maybe try incorporating a concrete activity in your request , something like grabbing a drink , watching a game/tv series , going to the movies , smoke a hookah , anything really . 
  makes it easier for them to decide if they feel like doing something like that .
