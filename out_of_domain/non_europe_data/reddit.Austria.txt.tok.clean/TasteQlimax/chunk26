  systematical oppression of thoughts and views that do n't conform yours is a form ignorance that should not be tolerated . 
  he 's been like that since he was a runescape youtuber back in like 2010 . 
  even back then he always was the source of drama and hissy fits . 
   sauerkraut - not anymore , we hardly eat it , but foreigners think that we eat it all the time, 
  i eat that pretty often because it only goes bad after like an eternity . 
  and also because i do n't want to get skorbut . 
  i really miss that series . 
  i loved just going down the mountain a few times to relax and listen to some music . 
  wish we had pc versions of those games . 
  how are the graphics holding up today 's standards ? 
  sounds good , i will make sure to give it a try . 
  thanks . 
  if even that , hard to proof what was in there if you do n't have receipts for that stuff . 
  just go to the airport outlet center , there are tons of shops and the one time i was there i saw loads of ski related stuff . 
  absoluter m\u00fcll . 
  make sure to mix as much as possible with locals . 
  i know this might be hard in because of this being a foreign country but do n't make the mistake to live in a bubble lacking anything that makes germany germany . 
  we also give this advise to all expats , it is an integral part of integrating into this new society . 
  also congratulations , 
  austrian wine is now regarded as very good too . 
  this changed the wine market overnight .

  here is a tl ; dr : want to live in country that speaks german without knowing german ? 
  yeah ? 
  great , have a fun time being isolated . 
  honestly i think it is more austrian than german . 
  i do n't even think we have austrian comedians , only austrian kabarettists .

  unless you manage to do something nobody has ever heard and everybody likes i think you will crash and burn here . 
  do n't get your hopes up too high .

  this is only the case with privately owned atms our banks still do n't charge you . 
  there is a difference between satire news and lies to generate fear and unrest . 
  you want a big part of the population to be somewhat combat experienced , in case of an invasion you 'd have a substantial amount of now civilians that have military training and could mount an guerilla defensive if they wanted to . 
  the thing i do n't understand is why women are not subjected to the same standards we have for men . 
  frohs neigs,

  soaring compared to almost no sales before because bavaria did n't print any new copies . 
  bad clickbait imho . 
  pro tip : get c1 before actually studying here or your life will be rather unfunny . 
  i assume you already read all the study posts on / r/germany and it is no different for austria . 
  [ eh kloa ; , \\ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ystl2mmcjla ), 
  [ this is how dogs turn into heroes . 
  the article you linked states that the radical left demostrants were the cause for the injuries and destruction . 
  easy, 
  thought the same , even checked the upload date to find out if it was made recently . 
  10 seconds worth of googlefu , you should be able to do that yourself if you want to study in germany . 
  anyways :, 
  this might sound a bit pretentious but the team 7 stuff is insanely high quality on more than just likely something you buy for life basically . 
  i personally have a kitchen table , chairs and a bed made by them , my parents also . 
  this stuff is top of the line . 
  this is austria not australia , also just do n't drink it ... 
  i just got mine 3 months ago , all in all you 'll be paying about $ 5000 , - for the basic braces . 
  if you want any special stuff like inline it will cost more . 
  munich is pretty much the most expensive city to live in in germany . 
  that said marriages made just so you can stay in germany will not grant you the right to stay and if uncovered and if you get accused and found guilty you could potentially serve a prison sentence . 
  just get a good vpn and use netflix and amazon like everybody else . 
  get sky then or pay for the streaming service that has them after they aired . 
  stealing is stealing , will you get fined ? 
  maybe , maybe not , we ca n't tell . 
  want to be safe just spend the $ 10 on the subscription for a month . 
  should n't really bankrot you . 
  you ca n't really , i mean maybe you find a job at a international law firm or a big international company but american law is worthless in germany . 
  your legal knowledge will also be not worth much as germany has a completely different legal system . 
  if you have studied economics and have management experience you probably could find a position but just with american law will be tough . 
  i doubt regular germans will have much use for experts of the american legal system . 
  i do n't know of any large data plan without a contract here . 
  it 's not , watches in these price ranges are more of an investment than anything else . 
  this is craftsmanship wo n't go down in price , it either will go up or stay the same . 
  wombats at the naschmarkt . 
  excellent prices , really nice rooms even thought it is a hostel ( rivals hotels imho ) and really central and close to the subway . 
  we are not the embassy . 
  contact your local embassy . 
  that said you might want to go to germany first and see what live is like there before moving there . 
  also do n't forget your studies will be worthless in germany due to the german legal system . 
  also if you are serious about this better start learning german about 2 years ago . 
  good luck . 
  they do n't even have an impressum , they claim to develop products and show a sony phone , nothing about this site seems legit . 
  i really hope you are one of the very few who actually fell for this . 
  honestly that feels like an empty and lazy gesture but maybe that is just my austrian pessimism . 
  are you mentally challenged by any chance ?
