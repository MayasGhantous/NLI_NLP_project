  but i really want a pretty dress . 
  i dress casual jeans , leggings , shirts , thats it . 
  the only pretty dress i have ever owned is my wedding dress . 
  i 've never heard that version of `` fangad av en stormwind '' before , holy crab, 
  that 's a question i aks myself a lot in this sub . 
  and now i 'm having jolly rancher flashbacks ... welp, 
  i suggest you return his $ 1,000 amp and donate the money to a charity to teach him the true meaning of christmas . 
  vikings , vaginas , velociraptors - that 's gon na be an interesting evening, 
  am i the only one with a soundtrack in her head : http://imgur.com/sirpo2w, 
  they are mental . 
  i sincerely hope that autocorrect is responsible for `` fetus porn '' . 
  your wife is awesome , that is so high level passive-aggressive shit right in your mothers face . 
  yeah , revenge is petty , but it must felt damn good for her . 
  she probably counted !, 
  she ca n't even hold the phone up for more than just a few seconds , drives me nuts . 
  stop eating junk, 
  but what is the alternative ? 
  if he does n't like the phone/video sex and texting at all , what could be a compromise ? 
  letters , smoke signals ? 
  and i have a golden wiener and although he exactly looks like a way too small goldie , he is stubborn as a dachshund . 
  the . . the . . sweet and sour chicken are chicken nuggets with red stuff poured over . 
  honestly , in this case i would really like to hear the bf and even more ex-gf # 1 perspective . 
  gf # 2 is cleary overstepping major boundaries , but i get weird vibes considering # 1 . 
  i know , thats not really the topic here , but damn , i just visited her site and found the babecamp ad . 
  she charges 100 dollars for 4 skype calls and a daily newsletter ? 
  one fucking hundred dollars ? 
  in regards to the other comments , i could be totally wrong , but it is the sister , that rubs me wrong way . 
  i get it , family bonds can be tight , but i get the vibe , that she wants you for herself all alone . 
  she gets upset when you develope the relationship with your girlfriend , although its natural you cut time to be with the new girlfriend . 
  you gloss over the fact , that you give your sister money , not only on birthdays , but , in your words , freely . 
  whenever she needs it ? 
  yes , it is your money , but maybe she felt , your sister took advantage of you . 
  your girlfriend is definitly jealous and she is not handling it well , her snide remarks consindering the ball were surely hurtfull , but i get a really weird vibe about your sister . 
  i mean , sleeping beside the brothers hospital bed in an fold-out-matress because an appendix surgery ? 
  maybe its a little bit over the top for me . 
  i can understand the girlfriend for being hurt , because she tries to compede with the `` glorious '' sister and looses every time . 
  ( and sorry for any strange sentences , english 's not my language ), 
  oh my , who is this magnificent bearded beast ? 
  thanks , i will ... investigate further . 
  my mom had a lhasa , damn that was a mean little fucker , but he loved her to death . 
  these dogs are bred to defend their homes and will bite , if threatend . 
  sorry to say , but if you go through with marriage and finally kids , they will break your relationship . 
  she maybe can live to be no . 
  2 behind your dad , but i do n't think a kid will . 
  what did i just watch ? 
  in german : `` wei\u00dfrussland '', 
  this issue is what caught my eye . 
  this brothers has a wife , who obviously did n't know !, 
  http://i.imgur.com/rveqlm2.jpg - i love the artwork, 
  my husband shares his love for martial arts with our 6 year old daughter , they will dress up as obi wan kenobi and rey from star wars , she even sailed the seas with him in assassins creed black flag ( and loved the treasure hunt ) . 
  kids are interested in things the parents are excited about , gender is secondary . 
   now that i 'm athletic and a successful stand-up comedian instead of an friendless obese loser playing videogames in my room you want to be pals to post pics on facebook . 
  wow what a great person you 've become . 
  what a great person you are . 
  you are hateful , vengeful , unforgiving , manpulative - you 're the same typ of person you described your sister was . 
  you have a really big self esteem problem from being bullied as kid so much and did n't heal , you transfered all your anger and rage to the one person , who can be hurt . 
  all the other bullies in school did n't give a shit about your emotions , but the bully at home could be punished . 
  understandable at 16 , 18 , even 20 years . 
  but have to grow up someday and take the frozen road . 
  he is a, 
   successful stand-up comedian, 
  probably his whole career is tied into having been his sister 's victim . 
  i 'm not jumping on the `` sick abusive bastard with anger issues needing therapy !! '' - bandwagon . 
  first of all , yes , he clearly totally overreacted . 
  yelling and leaving you a sobbing mess was really shitty . 
  but , here comes the but-part , i can relate . 
  lets try to see his side :, 
  you said , he is super big on apperances . 
  this could come from a low self esteem . 
  in this hour his friends ( whom his self esteem depends on a lot , if he is really this `` image is important '' - guy ) left him sitting ** on his birthday alone ** waiting in a public restaurant , he crumbled . 
  he was devastated . 
  who know 's what he read in there lazy tardiness ? 
  so his self esteem is the gutter , he may think , his friends do n't really care for him at all , if they do n't even manage to come to his birthday on time . 
  and then he sees you with this guy . 
  talking secretly , whispering , probably looking guilty , when he spots you . 
  and the alcohol flows , it fuels his emotions . 
  finally you tell him , why you acting , as if you were hiding something . 
  you ** were ** hiding something . 
  yes , it was something good and he was so drunk and idiotic to spoil it . 
  he could have been hating himself in this moment , because he ruined everything . 
  i do n't want to throw the therapy card , but i think , he has to work on his self esteem . 
  takeing out his anger on you is the worst way und you should tell him , you were afraid . 
  his reaction might give you a hint what to do . 
  mummys helicopter is up and flying . 
  you have to protect your daughter from a uber-controlling wannabe super mom , before she can screw her life completely . 
  if you not put your foot down now , this will blow over . 
  your father wants to impress his new girlfriend , wiggle his way in her heart through her daughters . 
  sorry to say , but this is asshole behaviour , watch as the ship sinks without you ( if you are so vital for the shop ) and get a new job . 
  you 're all way to much accomodating to your sister . 
  this woman is 33 years old , not interested in therapy , although she desperatly needs it and you , her family , alle enable her . 
  it seems you walk around on eggshells around her ( oh , do n't do this , she will get angry , huuh , better not tell her that , she will act out ... ) , she has to learn that her actions have consequences . 
  she says she will never visit you ? 
  fine , honey , then do n't come . 
  there is no way to tell someone gently to fuck off . 
  maybe `` please consummate your coitus elsewhere '', 
  the big bang theory, 
  you should really put this in your posting , that is essential . 
  his behaviour reveals a deeper issue , if he says such hurtful things . 
  stand up for your daughter , give her the attention she desperately craves . 
  she is rebellious , because she could never satisfiy your wife .
