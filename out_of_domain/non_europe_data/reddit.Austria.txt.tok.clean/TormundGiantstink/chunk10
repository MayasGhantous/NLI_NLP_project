  widow michael, 
  because i have different responsebody object and do n't want to have to remember to handle empty response differently when adding new calls, 
  i 've pointed out several times that instead of using ` map { it.payload } ` i could use ` map { it.payload ? 
  : emptyresponse ( ) } ` for those calls instead , but then i 'd have to remember again to include it in my emptyresponse calls , which leads to onerror calls ( which are even worse than exceptions , because you do n't see them via crashlytics ), 
  you 're a saint , man, 
  she still completely understood what she did , regardless of whether she was suffering from severe depression or not, 
  the point is that mvp is not an architecture , it 's a structural pattern to organize the presentation layer . 
  mvp does n't tell you how to structure your other layers , like networking or persistence . 
  bob martin 's clean architecture is architecture ( obviously ) , or viper in the ios world ( clean architecture with mvp as the structural pattern for your presentation layer ), 
  i understand that completely , i 've been living with depression for most of my life , but `` i just did n't care '' is not a valid `` excuse '' when you 're responsible for the death of another person, 
  i actually find improv a lot more fun than having a ton of stuff prepared, 
  the right solution would be imprisonment and therapy . 
  imagine what precedent this would create , if she got away scot free, 
  emotional detachment as a way of dealing with loss or really anything that leaves a negative emotional handprint on you, 
  food . 
  if i eat at this one place , i eat everyday , i pay 7-8 $ for one meal, 
  you can easily make a meal for 5 $ that will last you 3 days ( chili con carne for example ), 
  if you go by my chili example , its actually more , because those 5 bucks were for 3 meals , so basically 3 days, 
  once , when this kids mom got him from kindergarden , he began taking a running start , drop down amd slide through her legs , effectively looking up her skirt, 
  that was weird enough already , but it got even weirder when wanted me to do the same, 
  i saw a vid of a cow eating a chick aswell, 
  k\u00e4sus , das is uncool, 
  i 'm not doofus snek !, 
  garys are n't born , they 're made, 
  by parasitic aliens who multiply by creating pleasant memories, 
  i know an alfred who 's 26, 
  a full inch for what ? 
  30 lbs ? 
  somewhat around that , i think, 
  as far as i understood it , it simply stores the changes in your . git folder ( every git repository has one of its own ), 
  i do n't think that library files are indexed , hence why you ca n't search for declaration and the like, 
  when injecting activities and other classes that do n't support constructor injection , is ` lateinit ` my only choice or is there something else , maybe something better ? 
  something else than using lateinit to shut down the compiler, 
  i think i may have misread in any case . 
  what i meant is that the ide indexes your code , so you 're able to search quickly , but it wo n't index files of libraries you added via gradle, 
  if you did n't commit the deletion to git , you should be able to use ` git reset -- hard ` to get it back . 
  in any case , it 's better to use some free cloud service , like github , gitlab or bitbucket . 
  then you can simply clone a repo , should you lose it on your machine . 
  i personally prefer bitbucket , because unlike github , it has private repositories for free and it 's more stable than gitlab . 
  i still do n't understand why people would use discord of all things to share porn , just use one of 100 sites that still allow loli, 
  duh , you forgot the boots, 
  because it 's not funny , i assume, 
  for a second i thought that would be the same clip as the original but from winston 's perspective, 
  in pathfinder , you need atleast 3 int to speak your racial language, 
  it 's not even the existence of these videos that i find sad , it 's more that people , who are already feeling lonely and resort to these videos , are being sucked in and getting out of this spiral is difficult, 
   the smaller the hole the more terrifying, 
  why the fuck do i suddenly think about junji ito ? 
  `` the enigma of amigara fault '' was the name of the strip i could n't remember , that 's what your comment reminded me of !, 
  nah , i read the story a couple months back, 
  do n't ask me about specifics , but there is a specific ~ ~ liquid ~ ~ powder you use for firebreathing ( atleast that 's what i recall from when i tried it on a school trip a couple years back ), 
  edit : i was wrong about the liquid , powder is safer, 
  \\* annoyed sigh *, 
  appareantly , [ lycopodium powder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lycopodium_powder ) is a popular fuel , as well as mixes of magnesium and aluminium . 
  i found stuff about `` pyrofluid '' , but that seems to be a german thing . 
  it 's supposedly similar to paraffin, 
  the only reason i dislike emoji is because it crashes devices below sdk ~ ~ 19 ~ ~ 23 when you attempt to use them in your strings.xml, 
  edit : apparently , they do n't even work on sdk 21, 
  this is a trick used on a boss you can only access incredibly late in the game ( earliest is just before the final boss ), 
  oh shit you 're right . 
  but then again , fucking friede, 
  try / r/android , / r/androiddev is for app developers, 
  lol , i 'd be happy to go to 16, 
  wrong place , i know , but why did n't you configure build types/product flavors in the first place . 
  if you configure your different versions to use different package names , then you ca n't even upload a debug version to the console, 
  ( for those wondering how it 's done : https://gist.github.com/tormundsmember/45fbbe6818a2810d095bc7572ac508d8 ), 
  you can even configure gradle to generate configfields using ` buildconfigfield ` ( for instance , i did it like [ this ] ( https://gist.github.com/tormundsmember/1796c34ec46aafae9b84b98754dede15 ) for every build type . 
  you can access those configfields via the generated ` buildconfig ` - class ), 
  couple of questions :, 
  how well does it work on smaller screens ? 
  will there be a `` presentation '' mode ? 
  ( think powerpoint ), 
  do you plan on making it streamable ( to something like a chromecast device , for example ), 
  i have two modules , ` : android ` and ` : core ` , with ` : android ` containing the android-specific stuff and ` : core ` containing all the business logic . 
  i had a bunch of enum values , so naturally , i converted them to stringdef . 
  problem is that i ca n't seem to use support-annotations in my ` : core ` - module , gradle complains that it ca n't resolve ` com.android.support : support-annotations :25.3.1 `, 
  what can i do here ? 
  there was a problem with avast 's virus definition , we also had a couple users who reported to us that our app was detected as malware by avast, 
  we use facebook analytics, 
   i am not driven by avenging my dead family , morty . 
  that was fake !, 
  i 'm driven by finding that sauce !, 
  that 's my series arc , morty . 
  if it takes nine seasons !, 
  i personally look for people who are stable and form their own opinions on new stuff . 
  nothing is worse than hype-driven developers , i 've seen that when we had to unimplement realm , due to the massive amount of issues we had with it, 
  other than that , i 'm not too picky . 
  if they can apply the correct coding patterns to problems i set before them , know how to use git , know the benefits of testing , then i 'm happy . 
  if they have done android before , that 's an added bonus , if not , it 's not a big deal , they 'll learn it eventually on the job anyway, 
  as if that was n't obvious from the `` inject marijuana '' bit, 
   you can still create static methods that require content but make sure you call them from presenter and pass context as weakreference to avoid memory leaks . 
  this completely defeats the purpose of the presenter . 
  everything platform-related should be in your view . 
  i wish you a lot of fun when porting your codebase to a different platform . 
  you put the bluetooth-connection stuff in a seperate handler class and keep an instance of the handler-class in your view, 
  for some reason , support-annotations do n't seem to work properly for me . 
  when i attempt to call ` logevent ( @event string event ) ; ` with ` `` abcde '' ` , neither lint nor android studio complain about it , which defeats the entire purpose of the library, 
  edit : my @event - class looks like this : https://gist.github.com/tormundsmember/facd902e3e15c6ece7e25b172bf45799,
