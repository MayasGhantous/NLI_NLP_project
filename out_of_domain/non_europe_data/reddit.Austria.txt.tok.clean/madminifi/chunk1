you better deliver , op !!, 
  negative . 
  stop spreading false information please . 
   i dream this 4-5 times a week . 
  i think you have some ladder issues . 
  go see a therapist , really . 
  i think you 're firing in the wrong direction here . 
  he/she was trying to be sarcastic by making fun of the armchair-rebels and internet shitstorm while in reality nothing is being actively done against it . 
  not that i 'm ** agreeing ** with him/her ... that 's how i understood this comment . 
  actually they back ** three ** :, 
  1 . turn on flight mode, 
  2 . turn wifi back on, 
  whooosh ? 
  what the ** fuck ** ? 
  i do n't know if you 're exaggerating but this sounds absurdly terrible . 
  i hate to break it to you , but the producers of jersey shore beat you to it . 
  try to think of a new idea to make millions . 
  here , you dropped something : o, 
  ... heathrow ? 
  gopro cam on your head . 
  there , nailed it . 
  `` this is for you , dad ! '', 
  why ? 
  most probably ... !, 
  apple as well ( though only in a few select countries at the moment ) :, 
  hahaha , goodbye fenerbahce , you will not be missed, 
  nope , not at all !, 
  explanation follows , i 'm late for work right now , sorry . 
   not bad for a secret communist muslim, 
  ftfy, 
   ... not a miniature version of what happened in libya ** where nobody died **, 
  i know what you meant , but seriously ... ? 
  i loved and hated that gun in the austrian military . 
   it 's magazine , but ** you 're ** austrian, 
  ftfy , 
  first of all : i hope you will enjoy your time in vienna , welcome in advance !, 
  second : well , it 's either austria wien or rapid wien . 
  there 's no reason not to support rapid - just be aware of the fact that right now the club is in pretty bad shape and suffering from a `` depression '' and the aftermath of really bad management in the last ~ 5-10 years . 
  which means that especially the hardcore supporters are fed up and there 's trouble brewing . 
  in autumn the management will be replaced/reelected which ** could ** mean that we ( rapid ) will face a future that 's a little bit brighter and more professional ... but it will take a few years to return to our former strength . 
  lots of the players this season are relatively young and `` hungry '' ... a slight difference imo to the previous seasons where old fashioned structures were upheld much too strong ( both regarding the players as well as the management ) . 
  it 's not gon na be easy in the next 1-2 seasons and be prepared to suffer a bit if you choose to support rapid . 
  but i think it will `` pay off '' ... at least that 's what i hope . 
  and for me it 's not a matter of choice anyway . 
  exactly !, 
  plus when watching their recent games i really loathed the attitude of many of their players : diving , killing time , nasty fouls ( not that i have anything against a healthy does of roughness on the pitch but there 's certain line ) ... i know this happens in a lot of games all the time but somehow they stuck out lately . 
   as far as i can tell , it was and is the biggest mismanagement of rapid , that havent got rid of those hardcore `` fans '' . 
  missing success is no justification for the shit they are pulling of in the recent years . 
  absolutely , i agree !, 
  i would n't say it 's the ** biggest ** mismanagement fault ( that would be the strategical and financial part ) but it ** is ** a massive mistake . 
  part of the problem is imo that persons like andy m. are far too close to several ultras leaders - that 's one of the reasons for their appeasement policy ... we 'll see how this develops once there is a new management . 
   do n't mean to steal your thunder madminifi . 
  naah , that 's fine !, 
   i like the smaller clubs as well , good to support them . 
   edit : guys lets all hold public trial on rudd . 
  i declare him guilty . 
  case closed . 
  okay guys , what 's next today ? 
  to ** what ** ? 
  to the moon and back ? 
  if i was n't broke/poor/a fucking pathetic loser i would so buy you gold for this amazing comment !, 
  i tip my hat , good sir !!, 
  haters gon na hate , man . 
  haters gon na hate . 
   the gif that keeps on gifing, 
   lol i wonder if that 's the only reason for the downvotes . 
  i knew i was treading thin ice with that one . 
  then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly . 
  why ? 
  fair enough , 
  this right here is ** art ** . 
  after almost 4 years on reddit this belongs in the top 3 of the most fucked up things i 've ever read !, 
  wow . 
  just * wow * ... 
  bravo !, 
  goddamnit , this thread is full of beautiful replies like this . 
  best morning-redditing in a looong while !, 
   never flew them , but budget airlines are never good . 
  the german/austrian airline flyniki/airberlin is actually very good for a budget airline . 
   that is the most amazing thong i 've ever seen . 
  no , that is the most amazing thong you 've ever seen :, 
  apple did n't decide to split the last season into `` two '' . 
  exactly . 
  i think it 's a shitty situation and if i were a customer that paid for the season pass i would be furious as well . 
  but it 's ** not ** apple 's fault - at least not primarily . 
  but yeah ; the apple-hate-train is rather famous . 
  a ) not necessarily boring, 
  b ) would be `` realistic '' and plausible in real life, 
  are you just making these numbers up ? 
   episode was great . 
  a little upset hank was n't shot at least once while standing in the open . 
  ** guess that 's why the nazis lost world war ii **, 
   i would n't be surprised if all of next episode takes place after the shoot out and we do n't learn what happens till the end . 
  exactly my thoughts . 
  i just ca n't see a seamless continuation of this scene happening . 
  i predict a `` typical '' breaking bad opening shot ... maybe some close-up for 10-15 seconds etc etc. . . then after 10-20 minutes into the episode we 'll see what happened . 
  gnaaaah , the tension ... !!!, 
  good . 
  yes . 
  yes , me !,
