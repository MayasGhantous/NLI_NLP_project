  thank you for the pics - very interesting insight !, 
  and most of all : thank your dad !!, 
  he 's doing an extremely important job . 
  tell him that !, 
  holy crap ... !, 
  fuck , now i ca n't stop singing . 
  great news !, 
  though i hope they have a certain amount of seasons ( maybe 3 ? 
  maybe 4 ? ), 
  in mind , end the show in a ` fitting ' way and do n't drag it out too long . 
  ps : the thumbnail in alien blue is ... interesting :, 
   apologize . 
  ftfy, 
  twist : it 's the same room . 
  what a stupid , childish and pathetic `` idea '' . 
  i 'm a supporter of bitcoin and crypto currencies in general and i think it sucks that apple removed the app ( s ) , but that 's just moronic . 
  i can really recommend the brenthaven broadmore line . 
  i bought the `` slim brief '' a few months ago ( had been using its ` predecessor ' since 2008 ) and i love it . 
  i 'm using it everyday for work ( macbook air 13 '' & amp ; several documents/folders ) and it 's perfect . 
  btw : it looks better in real life than in the pictures imo and the build quality is good . 
  plus they offer a `` lifetime guarantee '' . 
  ps/edit : i know it 's not exactly a messenger bag , but my recommendation still stands . 
  yes , of course , i can so that . 
  though i wo n't be able to do it in the next 10 hours since i 'm not home right now . 
  but i can tell you that it holds the laptop perfectly in place since there are 2 padded and somewhat flexible `` brackets '' ( sorry , ca n't think of a better word since english is n't my mother tongue and i 'm sleepy as hell , haha ) with just the right amount of resistance . 
  as soon as i 'm home i 'll take a few pics . 
  there you go :, 
  here in the third pic you can see the padded `` bracket '' that secures and holds the laptop tightly in position ( + probably serves as a shock absorber ) :, 
  ** never ** skip leg day . 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  to be honest i do n't know if it can hold a widescreen 15,4 '' notebook . 
  i think it depends on the actual size of the laptop since 15-15 ,4 '' laptops can differ significantly in size . 
  the specs say that it fits a macbook 15,4 '' , so maybe compare your notebook to this model ? 
  ** height ** : 0.71 inch ( 1.8 cm ), 
  ** depth ** : 9.73 inches ( 24.71 cm ), 
  regarding the material : i was planning to buy a `` premium '' brand like a porsche design notebook bag ( leather ) since i absolutely hate the typical `` nylon '' material usually found on the cheaper models . 
  but the material used on the broadmore models is very nice , i like it . 
  that 's debatable . 
  try to download it via the xbox live store ( not in the in-game store ) . 
  worked for me . 
  try to download it via the xbox live store ( not in the in-game store ) . 
  worked for me . 
  i agree . 
  on the other hand it helped me today already :, 
  2 griefers were racing around los santos downtown , constantly killing all the other players . 
  since no one else was ready for team play to end their killing spree i instead hunted them to the airport where they got into a chopper ( non-buzzard ) . 
  moments before i was able to kill them they shot me and flew away . 
  i set a 9000 $ bounty on one of them ( so that the red blip shows on the map and so that maybe others would help me ) . 
  now we know it 's usually risky/useless to set a bounty on 2 guys helping each other , since one of them would just kill the one with the bounty and cash in the money . 
  but since they were in a chopper they either had to land to do this ( which would give me time to reach them again ) or live with the red blip for a little longer . 
  i got into my buzzard and followed them . 
  it was only after a while that i noticed the flashing arrow on their blip - it pointed up . 
  apparently they went for the moon in order to hide . 
  well , thanks to the new blip-arrow i knew i had to ascend even more . 
  it took me about 2 minutes ( going straight up ) to finally reach them : lock on - beep beep - fox one - fox two - aaand boom !, 
  both griefers went up in a ball of fire . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** the new arrow on the blip helped me to catch 2 cowardly griefers who tried to escape into the stratosphere . 
  i would donate you the money ... but how ? 
  i 'm on xbox . 
  why the fuck is everything wrong here ? 
  i do n't know what to believe anymore !!, 
  incredible . 
  and despite the rather low video resolution you can actually see the shrapnel flying towards them . 
  does anyone know if one of the soldiers was hurt/killed ? 
  ahh , the summer of '13, 
  healthier than a lot of the cereals people usually/often eat for breakfast . 
  for sweating ? 
   how about for sweating on sagna ? 
  ftfy, 
  in germany : the judge ( s ), 
   edit : i remembered u2 still exists , no matter how hard i try to forget that they do . 
  what exactly is it with this amazing hate for u2 sometimes here on reddit ? 
  bitterness much ? 
  yeah ? 
  what about fucking her ? 
  link pls, 
  hehe , nice ideas , especially ( as others mentioned ) the `` war photographer '' !, 
  and since i still have a * shitload * of money i 've been doing ** exactly ** the same thing with cars from the street in the recent days :, 
  i completely pimp them , usually respray them in funny/ugly colors and then offer them to low rank players . 
  80 % just blow me and/or the car up , even though i always make sure to be in passive mode in order to appear as a passive/peaceful blip ( though i know that you can still be a threat despite being in passive mode ) on the radar ( does n't matter , i get blown to pieces countless times ) . 
  the `` sad '' thing is that since the recent update the gifted players only get 10.000 $ ( maximum ) when selling the pimped car . 
  worse , i think . 
  market share is almost irrelevant as long as :, 
  * the manufacturer makes enough ( in this case : a lot of ) profit - check !, 
  * the platform itself stays relevant enough so that the majority of developers maintain/update existing and create new sought-after apps ( which benefits the user of said platform ) - check !, 
  besides that market share numbers are just useful for pissing contests of fanboys . 
  fanboys , sadly . 
  yeah , it sucks a bit . 
  but better late than bad . 
  yes , i do + google chrome . 
  and i think that both are superior to firefox . 
  * shhhhh !, 
  * we do n't want to assume ** that ** !, 
  agreed . 
  while i 'm well aware that the focus st/rs are ** very ** decent cars and pretty `` quick '' as well , fwd would definitely be a deal breaker for me . 
   the same works at the helipad area on the southside of map near beach . 
  you can slam peoples vehicles into the ocean with yours and not get charged . 
  i did this to the ( chromed ; what else ) entity of a griefer and then sent him an in-game message : `` geez , the tide is high today ... '' . 
  very satisfactory i have to say , 
  ftfy,
