  it is . 
  and since the fixes in 10.9.1 and ** especially ** yesterday 's 10.9.2 it 's imo at least on par with snow leopard if not better . 
  do n't forget improved battery life on almost every model . 
   i 'd love an 80 's themed dlc ; lambo countach , afro hair styles , flayed trousers and a g3 rifle to top it off . 
  do n't forget : mullets , pastel colored shirts & white jackets , miami vice don johnson style ... well , or just vice city style , 
  you mean how much ** better ** can it get !, 
  get is ? 
  why ? 
  ewwww !, 
  that 's enough internet for me today . 
  and the option to turn it back on later . 
  hehe , nice !, 
  ( as long as you do n't use this under-the-map glitch to grief ` normal ' players ) , 
  whenever i 'm in a session and notice that there 's a wall-breacher ( most of the time they have a bounty on their head and hide ) i make it my top priority to find and kill ( or at least annoy ) them . 
  most of the time i go into passive mode and join them in their wall-breach-area . 
  then i stand there for a few minutes and make them nervous ( they ca n't focus on killing cops and other players outside the wall since i could disable passive mode anytime ) or try to push them out of the glitched area . 
  after a while many of them think that i will just stay in passive mode and they go back to killing players who are trying to find them - that 's when i go off the radar via lester ( so they do n't see my blinking ` active ' blip ) and switch to active mode . 
  8 out of 10 times i can surprise them and shoot them in the back of the head ... or even better : stab them with the broken bottle . 
  haha . 
  oh , i love messing with these wall-breachers . 
  kudos to you for annoying them !, 
  good . 
  ( but i do agree that r * should add an nos-option that we can buy at lsc ), 
  yes :(, 
  it happened in the german show `` wetten dass . . ? '', 
  edit : see other comments in this thread on this : http://www.reddit.com/r/nonononoyes/comments/1znf9g/hes_going_to_get_run_over/cfv8z0v, 
  you know , you can have a perfectly healthy and vital social life and still think that harlem shake sucks . 
  he 's not judging . 
  he 's sad . 
  geez , relax !, 
  you 're taking this here a little bit too serious , are n't you ? 
  of course i understood it in the way you meant it . 
  that 's why my reply was n't the most serious either , would n't you agree ? 
  god , i ca n't believe i have to type that out , 
  oooh , that 's genius !, 
  * this is your new friend now *, 
  for anyone interested :, 
   '' ** villa o ** in cap ferrat in southern france , luxury villa worth rating of 5 stars -- in fact , it 's a beautiful house on 5 floors and a popular tourist destination . '', 
  the joke - this is it . 
  like the whole show since season 2 , 
  good find . 
  of course this does n't have to mean anything , but the congruence of the time frames ( fire & amp ; lt ; -  hypothetical crash ) is a bit interesting . 
  on the other hand : this island ( kepulauan riau/riau islands ; edit : sorry , this seems to be not precise enough , the correct name of this specific insel group is natuna islands ) seems to be inhabited and a plane crash would have certainly been noticed until now - despite the possibly sparse population . 
  but again , nevertheless interesting . 
  oh god ... 
  i honestly waited ~ 30 seconds and got angry at the wobbly wifi connection here . 
  today i 'm stupid . 
  it 's like a parody/sketch based on the first good season of revenge . 
  seriously , wtf ... 
  usually i 'm not a supporter of conspiracy theories , but to be honest after all this mis-information i would n't be surprised if they actually shot it down and now do n't know how to handle this . 
  yes . 
  and then standing on a wall in passive mode giving you the bird and jerk off motion for 5 minutes . 
  to check if you just memorized stuff ( and/or maybe memorized answers from last year 's test if they are circulating ) or actually understood everything completely . 
  al jazeera is my least favorite because it 's least accurate . 
  ha , more or less the same here . 
  i 'm on alienblue so i can turn the background and everything to black ... 
  helps with `` hiding '' , 
  and very important imo , since i 've been in this faction : do n't be skinny fat !, 
  i think that not everything about body fitness is `` social pressure '' . 
  of course it is to a certain extent , but even when you 're home alone in front of a mirror and look at your ( naked ) body : do n't you `` prefer '' to look fit/toned/in shape ? 
   i think suits are a nice way to improve how you look unless you have a body that you want to show . 
  i disagree . 
  i know what you mean , but especially suits look so much better when you 're in shape and have a `` body to show '' ( and vice versa ) . 
  of course you wo n't be able to show of your biceps or abs , but a fit/muscular guy looks so much better in a suit than a too skinny guy for example . 
   having a preference to look fit/toned/in shape in a mirror is likely due to influences from society in the first place . 
  well of course , to a certain extent . 
  but so is not smelling like a hobo , not looking like you lived in a coal mine for the last 3 years etc. 
  of course i 'm well aware of the fact that ( almost if not ) everything in life is influenced by society , i wo n't deny that since it 's true . 
  but i still think that feeling fit ( and being/looking fit , since that goes hand in hand ) and `` in shape '' is a good and desirable feeling more or less independent from society 's pressure . 
   ** primarily but not only ** your entire lower body, 
  increased muscle mass in the lower body increases the body 's metabolism and helps in building muscle in the upper body as well . 
  edit : honest question to the downvoters : could you elaborate on why you downvoted ? 
  if a made a false statement i 'd be glad to be corrected and learn something . 
  it might not have been even close to scientific but as far as i know it 's correct . 
  opinions ? 
  sure it 's my opinion ( the phrase `` i think '' implies that ) and you 're right , i do n't have scientific/factual evidence for it . 
  do you ? 
  addendum : simple question for you : when you wake up in the morning , would you prefer to ** feel ** ( let 's keep `` look '' out of it for a second ) fit and `` in shape '' or not ? 
  okay , sorry , your last reply just sounded a bit juvenile and pretentious . 
  let 's a agree to disagree ( to a certain extent ) , hm ? 
  pardon me , but are you that tedious in real life as well or only here on the internet ? 
  i did n't really make a claim , i just ** stated my opinion ** and wanted to add my 2 cents since i just slightly disagreed with your statement . 
  you do n't have to make a dissertation or scientific discourse out of it . 
  you can discuss ( especially everyday ) stuff like this without demanding sources and scientific/factual claim for every single line . 
  well , some of us can ( do n't get me wrong ; when someone makes absurd claims and pretends to be be the only one to be right etc etc. 
  i 'm all for asking for hard facts and claims ) . 
  whatever , this is conversation is a bit arduous , so : have a good day/evening , i 'm out . 
   yes , but our school and our homes are safer than other places , we just hear loud noises , ** and maybe get a small missile hit on the roof ... **, 
  stay safe , you are very brave !, 
  5 ) just imagine that gandalf dual-boots to windows on his macbook, 
  6 ) boom . 
  joke works again for you . 
  maybe something like this ? 
  ( sorry , german amazon link ), 
  i bought this one ( or a very similar model at least ) in blue in january and i absolutely love it , great quality . 
  you asshole !, 
  i just woke up my girlfriend from laughing , 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  the best description would be : a gif of a teletubby shaking his ass , 
  would you be so kind and take down that picture of my garage ffs ?!,
