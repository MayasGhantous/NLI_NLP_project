  i once had an awesome time while hunting a bounty riding on the train . 
  i tried it at least 5-6 times , got 3 cars and 2 bikes blown up ... after about 20 minutes ( and i think at least 1 or 2 roundtrips around los santos ) i finally had the idea to blow up the locomotive :, 
  got on my akuma , outpaced the train , stopped a little bit a front of it , placed 5 sticky bombs on the rail track ... and waited  blew up the train , it stopped and i put a bullet in the bounty 's head . 
  i ** love ** r * for changing this , 
  booooooooooooo ^ oooooo ^ oooooo ^ oooooo !, 
  woah , really ? 
  do you have a source for this ? 
  i think that 's an terrific idea , i just did n't know about it ? 
  go to bed , kid ... 
  why do you mention windows ? 
  so like almost any other os in the last 10-15 years . 
  fair enough , 
  this has nothing to do with ios 7, 
  wow , nice attitude , pal !, 
  a big ** thank you ** from me as well !, 
  your threads are the first thing i open in the morning when i go `` online '' . 
  thanks for all your efforts . 
   planet fitness does n't even let you do dead lifts . 
  that 's an `` illegal lift '' and will trigger the lunk alarm . 
  i 'm not sure if you are serious ... ? 
  thanks , very interesting . 
  samsung , and probably tons of others ... 
  interesting theory by a pprune.org user :, 
   what i 've done in the picture below is to put in the coordinates of the sighting of the wreckage given in this amsa picture and to also plot the position of urumqi airport in china ( capital of xinjiang province ) , but instead of using n in the coordinates for urumqi airport , i use s . so my point yyyy below becomes, 
   ** s ** 43 54.432 ' , e87 28.452 ' where as the actual urumqi airport is, 
  ** n ** 43 54.432 ' , e87 28.452 ', 
   with the only difference in the set of coordinates being the n and s . what i found is quite interesting in that there is a difference of only 150 meters * ( sic !, 
  ) * between the two points !!, 
   ** could it be that someone may have wanted to enter in to the fmc the coordinates for urumqi airport in xinjiang , but instead of using north , they entered in south ? 
  ** there is a very real possibility that this occurred given the close proximity of the wreckage and the error coordinate for urumqi airport ( yyyy in my picture ) . 
  ) * over a total distance of 3164 from igari is really saying something and ca n't be ruled out as a coincidence . 
   actually 151 miles, 
  you are right , i think . 
  nevertheless , i think even 151 ( nautical ? ), 
  miles are a possibility considering that, 
  a ) just because these coordinates might have been entered ( by accident ) it does n't mean that the aircraft necessarily crashed exactly there, 
  b ) current/drift could have carried the debris to this area ( though i read that this area is known for having almost no current ; but still : the satellite images are 4 days old , so roughly 8 days after a supposed crash ), 
  yes , this should most probably be nautical miles , not meters . 
  probably a `` typo '' ( ? 
  interesting and eery thought :(, 
  oooooooooh , the memories !!, 
  i had exactly this model when i was in the army ( 2001/2002 ) . 
  woah , it made those lonely dark nights doing border surveillance so much easier . 
  i was just listening to random radio stations and night talk shows . 
  * sigh *  thx for that pic !, 
  no , across the atlantic ocean : austria , 
  wtf ? 
  kudos to basel for fighting back with 10 players !, 
  uhm , haha , i do n't know exactly to be honest . 
  those typical late night radio talk shows where listeners call and talk about random ( and especially weird ) topics , their life etc. 
  what a crazy match !, 
  i like it !, 
  especially that you opted for no spoilers etc. , lots of people overdo it imo . 
  but to be honest i think it would look even better ** without ** the carbon roof/hood . 
  i do n't know if it 's up to date , but there are several tools like this to download videos from abc :, 
   if you watched breaking bad , there was a reason why walt drove a pontiac aztek . . 
  oh god , that motherfucking ugly car !, 
  do n't remind me !, 
  i ** love ** the dresser/commode/sideboard !, 
  i love the color !, 
  what 's that , some blue & diamond blue/ice white pearlescent ? 
  i do n't know if i remember it correctly but afaik his girlfriend was on board as well - he opted to fly on this plane because he wanted to share the shift with his girlfriend who was a flight attendant as well . 
  either way : horribly sad and eery :(, 
  this sounds highly interesting . 
  please get back if you find the link . 
  thank you very much in advance !, 
  honest question : what 's that ( from ) , can someone explain ? 
  just a costume/mask ? 
   note that it says `` mobile web browsing '' . 
  given the skewed ratio of app vs mobile usage among pretty much everyone i know , i ca n't say this metric is a good proxy of actual smartphone usage in the world . 
  for example , what if android owners in the us simply do n't feel the need to open the web browsers for most of things they need to do ? 
  well , this argument would work `` the other way around '' as well . 
  many ios users might choose to accomplish certain tasks via specific apps ( considering that many apps are still much more polishes on ios or even available ) instead of via the browser . 
  i agree that the web browsing statistics are n't 100 % reliable or spot on correct , but they might show a somewhat accurate tendency nevertheless . 
  dad ?? 
  i have to agree , it 's still the best . 
  sometimes i really wish they would update it with a few more features and options to give it a little more depth ( i would n't even mind if they published a civ : rev 2 and charge a few bucks again ) , but even in the current state it 's pretty good . 
  pixelmator is awesome !, 
  worth every dollar . 
  yep , that 's the only reason , you clever boy !, 
  yep . 
  well , the usa consists of ** 50 ** `` countries '' , so there 's that . 
  you fucking morons , i had a good laugh thanks to your comments , 
   at one point , i matched a guy 's speed and was driving beside him . 
  i then said `` mr. ( player name here ) , what do you have to say for yourself ? '', 
   he then flipped the bird an yelled `` fuck tha po-lice ! '', 
  hahaha , that 's awesome !, 
  edit : damn , wtf ? 
  yay , austrian schildb\u00fcrgerstreiche on reddit !, 
  guys ?? 
  yep , that 's about ideal !, 
  oh , bounties in tanks are one of my favorites !, 
  most of the time they feel invincible and drive around downtown blowing the bounty hunters up ... but to be honest there are 2 very simple strategies working most of the time :, 
  1 ) stock up on rockets and ammo for the grenade launcher , call lester to hide your blip , approach the tank on foot ( does not work so good when they drive around pretty fast ) , hit it with a few rockets ( most of the time it takes them 10-15 seconds to finally realize who 's shooting at them ), 
  2 ) if strategy 1 does n't work then i simply call pegasus and pick up my own tank, 
  you definitely can . 
  what i ** was n't ** able to do though was to go off the radar while still i 'm my apartment in order to sneak out and get away ( disclaimer : i never hide in my apartment , i enjoy bounty hunting/get-away too much ; but sometimes i still have a bounty when i go online ) . 
  we need pics !!!, 
  wow , this is the ** perfect ** description why the pt cruiser is a pile of turd . 
  well done !,
