  yeah , because op was obviously dead serious !, 
  ceo of volkswagen 's subsidiary seat to be precise . 
  yep . 
  you get better at coping but these moments where you just suddenly get this really deep , deep feeling of sadness still happen from time to time : /, 
  it 's been 16 years since he died and it 's still pretty tough sometimes . 
  `` nooo , do n't lift the blanket ... !, 
  our five minutes are not over yet !, 
  `` abuse '' ?!, 
  abuse what or whom ? 
  free/open source image editing/painting apps :, 
  - http://seashore.sourceforge.net/the_seashore_project/, 
  - http://pinta-project.com, 
  yes , i get that . 
  let me rephrase that question : ** how ** are they `` abusing '' that power according to you ? 
  honest question . 
  do n't forget supersets , they work wonders if you stick to the short `` breaks '' between the sets ( 5-10 seconds ) . 
   red wine should have room temperature , not body temperature . 
  that 's actually not entirely correct . 
  while red wine usually should be served less chilled than e.g. 
  white wine , the `` room temperature rule '' stems from the fact that rooms were much colder than they are nowadays ( most of the time ) . 
  depending on the red wine a serving temperature between 57-64f is more or less recommended . 
  hehe , you 're right of course . 
  i misread your sentence a little bit and automatically thought about the often spread `` misinformation '' regarding room temperature . 
  sorry ` bout that !, 
  i do n't think it sounds silly at all ; at least i feel/think the exact same way . 
  i always see the photos and videos of jfk in the 1950s/60s ( or * maybe * 40s when it 's the old family photos and videos from his childhood and teenage years ) ... but they feel so absurdly different from the 1910s and you never really make the `` mental '' connection between this era and people like jfk . 
  it 's weird , 
  not true . 
  source : my girlfriend . 
  light . 
  hth, 
  please tell me that the ass-like resolution of this image is part of the joke . . ? 
  i think it 's both . 
  or all the hate fueled with disappointment if he does n't . 
  * probably . 
  oh god , bad car analogies again . 
  please show me a laptop that 's a good alternative to a macbook air 13 '', 
  and those that are competitive to the air ( build quality , battery life , performance , ssd ) are ** far ** from half the price ( as stated above ) . 
  nowadays this is nothing more than a myth still being brought up by mostly ignorant apple haters ( i 'm not talking about you or someone specific , but in general ) . 
  desktop computers might be a different case , 
  same for me . 
  i was 11 years old and watching formula 1 races was an absolute must for our family , with my brother and especially with my father ( who passed away 4 years later ... ) ... we did n't miss a single race , each and every sunday we gathered in front of the tv . 
  and while i did n't quite understand at first how severe this accident was , i knew something was terribly wrong . 
  the minutes and hours of the tv broadcast until the end of the race are still haunting me in some way ... the speculations of the commentator during the race every few minutes while it was still going on . . and while we sat in front of the tv with my father . . and while the sun was shining outside like it did almost every time we watched f1 races during the summer . 
  and then ( i think it was still during the race ) the confirmation from the commentator that ayrton senna had been declared dead . 
  :( jesus ... it was just so mortifying ... you sit in front of the tv and think you 'll enjoy another race together with your family , the sun is shining , after the race there will be a small bbq . 
  and suddenly death . 
  as stupid and overly dramatic as this sounds , but i think part of my childhood and childhood innocence died at this weekend ( with ratzenbergers death the day before ) . 
  sometimes life sucks . 
  except apple products are n't shit . 
  do you have to add anything else here other than blatant trolling ? 
   oh god , are you serious dude ? 
  oh god , dude , yes i am !, 
   apple products are not shit , but compared to their price , they are . 
   an macbook pro can run you about $ 2,000 which is absolutely outrageous . 
  for a laptop that outputs that little performance for 2k ? 
  that 's absolutely crazy . 
  your buying a brand with all that money , not a device . 
  for $ 2,000 you can buy a laptop that triples the performance of the macbook . 
  - first of all : ** the macbook pro starts at $ 1.299 ** ( i 'm leaving out the old non-retina macbook pro for $ 1.199 since it 's definitely outdated ) , the model with 8gb and 256gb ssd ( much more recommendable than the cheapest one with 4gb and 128gb ssd ) costs you $ 1.499 . 
  far from the $ 2.000 you 're claiming . 
  - secondly : besides the hi-res display you also pay for excellent and often unmatched build quality , excellent os experience and hardware/software integration and ( equally unmatched by many - not all - competitors ) battery life . 
  - thirdly : for ** $ 999 ** you will get the 13 '' macbook air ( $ 1.199 for the 256gb ssd model ) . 
  it is ** very hard ** to find competing products at this price range with an equally good build quality and insane battery life . 
  time and time again the macbook pro and the macbook air receive highly positive reviews from renowned tech review sites . 
  but listen , * dude * , i 'm not saying that the macbooks are particularly ** cheap ** . 
  they 're far from that , of course . 
  they ** are ** expensive . 
  but a ) they are ** not ** `` shit '' ( remember ? 
  the statement from / u/yggdrasiliv i was answering to ) and b ) they are n't even shit compared to their price ( remember ? 
  your statement ) . 
  and i absolutely understand if someone comes to the decision to not buy an apple product/laptop because they will find other products for lower prices - an absolute valid argument . 
  but please stop spewing this un-substantiated anti-apple bullshit , it makes you sound like a 14-year-old . 
  gale boetticher sr. really deserves to enjoy his retirement . 
  i wish him all the best !, 
  i will miss exactly that !, 
  rip conny !, 
  i 'm ** so ** getting the zentorno ! 1, 
  well then she has to ... 
  ... step up her game !, 
  i 'll show myself out . 
  i can already see this opening new possibilities for glitches . 
  i 'm late , but here 's a link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7qbwapagzu, 
  buy the track , it 's on itunes !, 
  this is absolutely impressive and unbelievable . 
  and crazy !, 
  yeah , but we do n't get money for it . 
   i pretty much want to look at funny stuff and give my ** .02 cents ** every now and then . 
  well , that explains your cheap posts . 
  okay ... ? 
  huh , what are you talking about ? 
  i just read your 2 little postings here and nothing else . 
  geez , go get some fresh air , 
  still freezes around once or twice per hour for me ( 360 ) . 
  very annoying but i keep playing , 
  fyi : i honestly think that you 're being downvoted for your golden minigun ( not by me , but i guess so ), 
   i do n't think you know what the word pedestrian means . 
  hehe, 
   also , why did you kill him ? 
  why * not * ?
