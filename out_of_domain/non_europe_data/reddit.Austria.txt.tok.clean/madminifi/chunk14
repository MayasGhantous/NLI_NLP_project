  at first i was worried that he was still alive and your title was just a euphemism for a brutal torture/killing ritual . 
  then i was sort of relieved . 
  for some reason i read your title in a russian accent . 
  * `` yes , this is official picture '' *, 
  - ivan, 
  i 'm blown away , this is magnificent work . 
  and then , finally , on his death bed with his last breaths : `` it was all ... just a joke . 
  hahaha ... * cough * fooled you , honey ! '', 
  * fin *, 
  nice . 
  i fucking love the flamethrower , nice effects . 
  wow !, 
  this is impressive . 
  sometimes we forget that there was `` only '' land and nature where these immense cities exist today . 
  i love this artist 's idea . 
  * sick, 
  what h ** e ** ppens is that they stay in shape in order to not lose that girlfriend . 
  or they become fat and do n't care . 
   i want to punch every idiot i see doing this . 
  i fucking hate you kids and ** you 're ** stupid mobile culture bullshit . 
  * your, 
  the ending was a major disappointment . 
   i 've never seen a killcam because all i play is hardcore . . **  **, 
  ftfy, 
  it 's sort of a `` running joke '' here . 
  he said `` work on your writing style '' not `` put clear indicators for sarcasm in your post '' . 
  i 'd say that 's a difference . 
  and btw : mentioning 4chan as sort of an example ? 
  and one saturday evening you will stand in a club with your sweaty hands and you will be happy if a girl like her even talks to you . 
  they ca n't even . 
  oh god , no . 
  hnnnnnnnggggggg !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  hehe !, 
  probably in a car ? 
  spidernator s-1000, 
  this would be perfect for the new google cars !, 
  but i do n't ** want ** to , lois !, 
  swole milk, 
  yes !, 
  yo , chill . . 
  oh god ... 
  it loads on iphone 4 , iphone 5 , iphone 5s and ipad mini here without any problems . 
  how are you trying to view/open it ? 
  what the fuck . 
  well , to be honest you had no arguments to begin with , so there 's that . 
   so let 's say i want to share an image file . 
  on android , i will highlight the file and click share . 
  now i can send it to dropbox , bbm it , bluetooth it , convert it to pdf , facebook it , gmail it , post it to google + , share it in a hangout , post it on linkedin , share it on facebook messenger , store it within a note on notes , post it on twitter , or enter it into a conversation on whatsapp ( and that 's on an old version of android , 4.1.2 ) . 
  sorry , i know i 'm late , but this is exactly what is being addressed in ios 8 with extensibility and the corresponding apis : http://blog.gsmarena.com/extensibility-may-ios-8-best-feature/, 
  bugception, 
  ^ sorry ^ guys , ^ i 'll ^ show ^ myself ^ out, 
   so far my one gripe is that the predictive text keyboard does n't seem to be on ipad . 
  either that or i have no idea how to enable it . 
  did you take a closer look and see if there 's a small grey bar above the keyboard ? 
  you should be able to swipe up and activate/show the predictive text elements ( you have to enable autocorrect though ) . 
  you were pretty much spot on , perfect description . 
  good inter-app-communiaction was something really missing from ios more and more each year . 
  so it 's good to see that they 're finally addressing that . 
  maybe you could take a look at this guide here :, 
  just be sure to have all the important data backed up just in case . 
   scream to the high heavens how android is inferior and that they are leaving the platform for good, 
  well , there ** is ** a difference though between people who * `` scream to the high heavens how android is inferior and that they are leaving the platform for good '' * and people who think `` hey , ios is/became good enough for me ( again ) to seriously consider switching '' . 
  no reason to flip out imo . 
   if you never buy music ( legally ) , i 've always had a hard time putting it on an ios device . 
  how 's that ? 
  honest question . 
  around half of my music library has n't been bought digitally but has either been ripped from my cds or ( yes i admit ) downloaded . 
  works like a charm on the iphone . 
  read a little bit about this before you circlejerk . 
  they paid xerox for this and did ** not ** steal anything . 
   edit : keep in mind this is * only * for `` cracked '' music , not legally downloaded off itunes, 
  wait what ? 
  `` cracked '' music ? 
  :d i suppose you 're talking about mp3 files . 
  they should of course be natively supported and copied to the idevices by itunes without any hassles - that 's what i 've been doing in the last 6 years , 
  sorry that i 'm not of real help here , but it should definitely work . 
  maybe if you still need a few hints send me a pm . 
  `` what 's so funny asshole ? '', 
  oh my fucking god . 
  i 'm not a father yet but the idea alone ... one week after she was born . 
  god damnit !, 
  i hope the time you can now spend with her is at least a little bit of `` relief '' to heal this pain . 
  all the best to you !, 
  send apple a bug report/feature request using the bug reporter app and suggest that they should add a sort of indicator or something that this gray bar can be swiped up again . 
  awesome , thanks . 
  i really think that the choice of music in this show is one of it 's biggest strengths ( besides james spader of course ) . 
  outstanding work by the people responsible . 
  for anyone interested : the team/company behind the technology ( augmented reality with ar markers to correctly place the virtual items ) is viewar from austria : http://www.viewar.com, 
  ( i 'm not affiliated with them in any way , i just know the guys and thought it would be fair to name them ), 
  ** you cant even buy the cheapest vw golf for that price in denmark : & amp ; lt ; **, 
  i would never ever key a car , but what i actually ** do ** sometimes if i see someone deliberately taking up two spots :, 
  i put 2-3 pieces of chewing gum in my mouth , chew it for 10 seconds and then stick it on the driver 's door handle . 
  hehe . 
  take a breath and relax , buddy . 
  go outside , take a breath of fresh air and relax . 
  but now we know anyway !, 
  what the f *** are you talking about ? 
  are you drunk ? 
  hehe , yep . 
  but to be honest this player got lucky .
