  if suarez had hit him a few cm more left/right/up / down that would have been a free trip to the hospital . 
  what a prick . 
  players like him should be banned for life from professional games . 
  would have been sweet karma if he had broken his own ankle own something here . 
  i hope you 're using ( bitesms ) [ http://bitesms.com/] ? 
  material is the new ios 7/8 + windows phone !, 
  j/k , it looks nice . 
   `` custom keyboards , widgets : those things happened in android four to five years ago . '', 
  that 's right . 
  and things like a fluid ui , consistent design , pleasing appearance and elaborate and pleasing ux happened in ios four to five years ago , so there 's that . 
  but good for android , 
  i partly disagree . 
  while there have been severe improvements with 4.0 upwards it 's still not up to par with ios ( not talking about features ) . 
  it speaks for google and duarte that they are trying to improve it further . 
  plus : you have to pick it up at the few pre-defined locations ( and sometimes the vehicle glitches away before you get to it , e.g. 
  when there are other players around or when someone else orders a pegasus vehicle as well ) & ca n't get it delivered by mechanic . 
  for the tank i think that 's more than fair . 
  but for the monster truck ? 
  there 's hardly anything more satisfying than pulling out the rpg and sending a rocket into their back window . 
  well , you could argue that they are trendy because they are excellent laptops . 
  so after all people buy them because they are good . 
  boom , head blown ? 
  12 days, 
  i think you got downvoted because your `` level 113 here '' sounded a bit like boasting ( while 113 is n't impressive anymore ) . 
  just my 2 cents , did n't downvote you . 
  does n't work with pegasus vehicles . 
  no , it does n't work with pegasus vehicles . 
  yes , `` spotlight '' , one of the best features of os x in my opinion . 
  beautiful . 
  honest question : what does this mean ? 
  could someone be so nice and translate ? 
  thanks, 
  these comments and posts are incredibly cruel , stupid and inhuman . 
  yet i do n't understand what you wanted to achieve with this screenshot ? 
  i understand the outrage and the hate one must feel when reading such unbelievably inhuman statements after such a terrible , indescribable crime . 
  but do n't forget that sadly enough you would easily be able to find similar comments after crimes committed on israeli victims . 
  stupid , inhuman people exist - that is sad and a huge problem . 
  but they do exist everywhere . 
  i 'm sorry to reply several days after your post but i just wanted to say how intelligent , reasonable and - most importantly - human your post sounded . 
  if only certain people , countries and especially their leaders could for once look behind the curtains of nationalism and misguided patriotism and work on a solution for human beings to live together . 
  i know i sound like a hippie here , sorry . 
  ssshhh !, 
  like . . 
  perfect name for an emo rock band !, 
  freaking first world football player problems !, 
  i 'll be getting paid only 7 mio . 
  not enough ! '', 
  crazy crazy crazy !, 
  do n't get me wrong , i think it 's 100 % okay that they get these wages as long as the club can really afford them . 
  it 's just so amazingly absurd if you put it into perspective : 20-somethings being disappointed because they earn 3 mio eur less than their club colleagues ... and still earn 7 mio eur !, 
  what a beautiful life they live , 
  true . 
  but if the recent rumors are to be believed apple will again for the `` thinner thinner thinner '' alternative . 
  supposedly the iphone 6 will have a battery capacity just below 2.000 mah . 
  holy fucking shit !, 
   now that / u/unidan is shadowbanned ,, 
  what ?? 
  did i miss something ?? 
  edit : ah sorry , just saw the comments further down, 
  upvoted so you wo n't be depressed !, 
   to funny lol, 
  how pathetic that you 're getting downvoted . 
  sigh . . 
  the iphone camera is one of the best in smartphones , second to the better lumia models and maybe 1 or 2 high end android phones . 
  so please stfu and gtfo with your generic apple bash . 
  i 'm still using my iphone 5 from 2012 and it 's running perfectly fine , so what exactly is your point , captain troll ? 
  but are n't jokes supposed to be funny ? 
  so edgy ... 
  ps : fu !, 
  i forgot that the / r/gore comment section consists of 16 year olds , sorry . 
  totally worth it though !, 
  i do n't know where you 're from but you can get it in europe easily , it 's called `` lotus '' and it 's fucking delicious !, 
  i 'm sure i gained 2-3kg alone from binge eating this . 
  or crunchy :, 
  fyi for all europeans : you can get it in europe easily ( sans chocolate though ) , it 's called `` lotus '' and it 's fucking delicious !, 
   stafford himself said one of the other prisoners taught him spanish while he taught the other guy how to sail - all through `` tap code '' between cells . 
  even trying to ** imagine ** this is driving me almost crazy . 
  i can not grasp this at all , it 's certainly amazing . 
  i disagree . 
  it can be an immense difference between reading about an ancient building ( or looking at pictures of it ) and actually standing in this exact same building , touching its walls , walking through it and thinking about the recent generations who built it , lived there , worked there , suffered there , celebrated there , ... 
  i 'm not saying that ** every ** single building should be preserved at all costs just because it 's old . 
  but i 'd rather have some issues when developing plots/cities / ... than just destroy everything that 's standing in its way . 
  i would * love * if they did every single one of these !, 
  that 's actually a great idea !, 
  or even better ( like on ios since about 2012 ? 
  ) : ability to back up everything ( and restore it seamlessly ) online for free . 
  add wind sensors to the drone and let it caclulate the drift and needed compensation in realtime . 
  technically it should be possible but of course it 's a question of costs and size of the needed equipment . 
  plus the tank needed `` on board '' of the drone would be quite large thus increasing the minimum size of the drone . 
  thinking about it it might be more efficient to send the small drones to scan and analyze the fields and spray them seperately ... hmm . 
  i know , i know . 
   what was missing from my last sentence was `` after all '' , sorry for not being clearer . 
   troops in rainbow came from : british sas , dgse , cia , us army rangers , fbi hrt , german army ** ( i ca n't remember which unit exactly ) **, 
  probably gsg9 . 
  so what you 're saying is that you checked ** because ** you thought it was jude law nudes , right ? 
  coffee beans smell . 
  your title sucks . 
  `` apple loses $ 26 billion '' ? 
  no , apple ** lost ** nothing . 
  i would say that ** both ** operating systems have features and functions the other one still misses .
