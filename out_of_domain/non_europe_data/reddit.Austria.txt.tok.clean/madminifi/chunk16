  it 's just a matter of preference imo . 
  who gives a shit about market share ? 
  14 year olds ? 
   but really the rest of their stuff is just boring vanilla pop-rock garbage . 
  they have talent , but to me they 'll always be an overly sensationalized pop band . 
  two words : achtung . 
  baby . 
  wow , what an interesting chain of comments . 
  please keep going . 
  maybe ( but even then market share is n't necessarily the most important metric ) , but i 'm a user , so why should i care ? 
  right , i should n't , and i do n't . 
  exactly . 
  freaking pseudo-shitstorm just for the sake of a shitstorm . 
  seriously , go outside , catch a breath of fresh air and relax . 
  oh my fucking god ... 
  achtung baby is one of the best rock albums of the early 90s , hands down . 
  `` better '', 
  yep , same here . 
  i 'll try swiftkey , swype etc. 
  ( again ) but i 'm pretty sure i 'll stay with the default keyboard . 
  yeah , ok , that does n't change the fact that you could have updated your ios device through itunes without the need to free the space and delete your music . 
  what 's so funny ? 
  fp\u00d6 in austria to certain extent . 
  same here with a few apps . 
  though i noticed with google maps that the issue disappeared with the latest update and banner notifications from google maps can be swiped away again . 
  including :, 
  - sms history, 
  - all ( ! ), 
  application settings , whether they are from apple or 3rd party ( so i can immediately start working exactly where i left before the backup/restore and do n't have to worry about adjusting settings in different apps ), 
  - login data for 3rd party apps, 
   i 've mostly had samsung phones over the past few years . 
  i 've dropped them a lot . 
  no shatters . 
  no breaks . 
  nothing . 
  wow , anecdotal evidence ? 
  nice !, 
  i 've dropped my last 3 iphones several times over the last years and not a single time did they shatter or brake . 
  boom !, 
   the iphone truly has poor build quality . 
  haha , nice one , 
  `` but but but ... 
  according to [ anandtech ] ( http://www.anandtech.com/show/8559/iphone-6-and-iphone-6-plus-preliminary-results ) : no . 
  - ascend mate 2 : 18.7358, 
  - iphone 6 plus : 13.7167, 
  - htc one ( e8 ) : 11.9225, 
  - iphone 6 : 11.4667, 
  - htc one ( m8 ) : 10.800, 
  - samsung galaxy s5 : 10.2000, 
  agreed , would be awesome . 
  i really hope that sony sells a lot of their z-devices , they really deserve the success . 
  hell yeah , those are excellent ideas !!, 
  joke 's on you , he 's just documenting the illegally modded parts !, 
  9/10 would read again !, 
  best part : `` rock golem police '' :d, 
  awesome update !, 
  what makes me ( as a `` spot everything !!! '', 
  player ) especially happy :, 
   added a new option for whether tapping spot button should give attack/defense orders . 
   he was actually a millionaire through property not business . 
  but i guess buying and selling properties is business to some . 
  yeah , because ... it is . 
  while we 're at personal anecdotes :, 
  google maps ( which i still prefer 90 % of the time to apple maps ) on ** one ** single route wanted me to :, 
  - turn left where you 're not allowed to turn left ( busy street with a sign that says `` no no no lefty turn ! '' ), 
  - drive into a one way street ( wrong direction ), 
  so there 's that : /, 
  fun fact : `` fut '' means `` cunt '' in german slang !, 
  hahaha , well done , chap !, 
  yes , yes , no, 
  ** what ?? 
  or both . 
  you monster !, 
  i agree , it should be patched/improved , but it is n't a big issue at all imo . 
  holy shit , that might actually work ... !, 
  we 're referencing the twilight movies here , right ? 
   for both nominative and accusative :, 
  sorry , that 's wrong . 
  it 's * `` dein blaues auge '' *, 
  * drops mic *, 
  oh god ... 
   you are incorrect , calling him a terrorist is fucking ridiculous and simply not true . 
  you also cut the quote to make it seem worse . 
  i do n't know , but the complete quote still sounds pretty bad , just saying ... 
   * when the spring comes , we will manure the plains of kosovo with the bones of serbs , for we albanians have suffered too much to forget . 
  why ? 
  i honestly misunderstood you and thought you were arguing that it ** is ** okay to be angry because of 2 $ . 
  it 's too early in the morning here i guess . . , 
  no project cars for you this year !, 
  * oooh , burn !, 
  why would you want to open it in the middle of a cycle anyway ? 
  oh , give it a rest !, 
  you 're right . 
  but there 's still a human person suffering a deadly injury in the video . 
  :( i can absolutely understand if someone ca n't or does n't want to watch it . 
  too much saturation imo . 
  i would gladly pay usd 10-20 for an ipad version of tropico ( or something similar ) . 
  sadly there do n't seem to be any games like that available . 
  :( i 'm regularly searching the appstore and new game announcements but until now : no such luck . 
  same with sraw .
