  apparently your os is so ` stable ' that you posted this twice ... 
  * everyone is biased !!, 
  uhm , it was a joke ... 
  yes it is . 
  you 're in this exact subreddit right now . 
  wtf, 
  how old are you ? 
  wrong . 
  i do n't know what 's so strange about his question . 
  considering your replies it seems to be ok for you to have sex with a 9 year old child . 
   and if i am ? 
  are you going to come to my house of lecture me to death ? 
  huh ? 
  what ? 
  did you smoke some funny weed or why exactly do you come to such ... uhm ... weird conclusions and assumptions ? 
  please , catch a breath , get some fresh air and then come back . 
  the way you are `` discussing '' is nothing but childish and simple minded . 
  i had better discussions in the school yard with other 10-year-olds , back then when i went to school . 
  so please relax . 
  regarding your rest : i am well aware of the fact that it was ( more or less ) the ` norm ' in ancient times and i 'm not even attacking any religious or fictional person . 
  not at all . 
  that 's what you are projecting right now . 
  i did n't even talk about this . 
  if you go back and ** read ** again after catching a breath you might notice that i actually just referenced ** your ** apparent point of view . 
  and to get back to your original question * `` and if i am ? 
  '' * ( thinking it 's okay to have sex with a 9 year old ) than i could only say that you have a barbaric , backwards , disrespectful and inhuman opinion . 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  have a nice evening . 
  you ( too ) seem to have a problem in reading and understanding texts . 
  please attend a school and take a few lessons in `` reading comprehension 101 '' . 
  i did n't imply and did n't claim that i do not grasp the differences between ** now ** and ** ( back ) then ** and how over hundreds and thousands of years the `` rules '' of a society can change . 
  so stop insinuating or fantasising ... 
  ** if ** you really want to touch the ( difficult ) subject of abortion and ** if ** you really want to know my opinion on this topic : i am actually against all to liberal abortion laws . 
  but i absolutely support the right to get an abortion if a girl/woman got ( brutally ) ** raped ** ... 
  yes , i 'm of the opinion that this ( raped ) woman should have the right to get an abortion . 
  everything else is a different topic . 
  but now that we 're talking about it : what 's your opinion on this ** specific ** situation :, 
  if a girl/woman got raped ( which includes * not giving consent to sex of her own free will * ) ... do you think she should be compelled to give birth to the child of the man who raped her ? 
  honest question . 
  see , we can agree on that . 
  ( i still do n't understand why you insinuated that i 'm all for `` killing children '' , but whatever ... ), 
   brilliant, 
  more like common sense . 
  elaborate . 
  now . 
  edit : sorry , just saw your reply to the other comment . 
   2 ) keeps him alert . 
  he 's complained in the past that he saw so little action that he was having problems keeping concentrated on the game . 
  hehe ... oh those poor bayern keepers !, 
  yep :d very meta !, 
  oh yes , please !, 
  no wait , let me rephrase that : oh yes , get your shit together , apple . 
  still rocking launcher ( bought it on day 1 ) but future updates , bug fixes and improvements etc. 
  would be nice to have of course . 
   in the small city of iguala , 120 miles south of mexico city , 43 student teachers appear to have been rounded up after a day of protests , then marched into the hills and apparently massacred by local police and gang members , who prosecutors say control the city and its officials . 
  what the fucking ** fuck ** ?!, 
  and for ios of course :, 
  maybe it is clicktoplugin/clicktoflash ? 
  sweeeeeet justice . 
  nice one !, 
  ps : i think some tea-bagging would have been acceptable in this case , 
  this photo hurts me physically !, 
  i did n't hear you . 
  what ? 
  holy shit , that 's an amazing return . 
  here it would cost at least 220k usd to get a house you can rent out for 600/month . 
  i 'm honestly baffled ... !, 
  you 're probably right , i 'm in europe ( austria ) . 
  yields around 3-4 % when letting a house are the norm here . 
  haha , oh god , no !, 
  it 's an audi slogan :, 
  i know , but it 's the `` sad truth '' here . 
  real estate prices went crazy in the last 10 years . 
  let 's over-analyze everything . 
  with a `` 93 '' in his username ... , 
  holy shit , [ it worked !, 
  i think i just threw up in my mouth a little bit ... 
  nah , j/k , i like to spray my cars in ridiculous colors as well sometimes . 
  more like 240p . 
  my eyes !, 
  ahh , 1942 . . a good year !, 
  his position : money . 
   they worship ** lucipurr ** . 
  ftfy, 
  thanks !!!, 
  i 'm extraordinarily happy about the character creator , seems to be extremely detailed . 
  ca n't wait to see lots of different players online !, 
  not yet . 
  ( nooo , just kidding ! ), 
  not that it matters anymore , but in [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/def9gut.png ) i 'm 80-90 % sure  that the ball crossed the line entirely . 
  do n't forget the bacon . 
  free bacon . 
  yeah , i agree , it 's definitely not 100 % clear and your argument is valid . 
  the referee made a judgement call ... one that is much easier to swallow since he gave the goal a few seconds later . 
  asshole , i just woke my wife by laughing !, 
  me too, 
  haha , noticed this when i raced another player to the airport . 
  i thought i was oh so clever when i gunned for the fence by the stairs ( while the other player went for the jump ) ... 2 seconds later : bonk !!, 
  my face when i hit the fence : o_o, 
  my face after i tried it 3 more times : -_-,
