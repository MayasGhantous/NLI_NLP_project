  that must be it !, 
  i agree . 
  for me they look always too bulky and shoddy . 
  ptfo !!!, 
   ... it was a phase in nokia 's history that no one is really fond of . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the communicator was incredibly famous . 
  how about : shut the fuck up and get a life , you immature and childish jerk ? 
  mad ? 
  no , just amused by kids like you  get a life, 
  ooooh , i 'm so scared . 
  hehe ... 
  oh geez ... you ever heard of sarcasm ? 
  give it a rest , you 're making a fool of yourself , 
  oh god . 
  oh god . 
  oh god !!!!, 
  ** psa/warning : stop that video at 00:52 . 
  do not continue to watch after this timestamp . 
  oh god , oh nooo . 
  you have to set a `` fixed '' password once on the client you want to connect to in the future ; then it works without asking for a new password all the time . 
  i have my teamviewer account set up so that i have my aunt 's and my mother 's pc in my `` contact list '' . 
  i just have to fire up teamviewer and double click the name and it connects instantly . 
  even works from my mobile phone or tablet . 
  i love it ... 
  saves me so much time . 
  oh , i know that and i 'm doing pretty okay in our market here  it 's just that it sounds so ... surreal reading about these yields/rois . 
  stop . 
   the iphone 6 is behind in most benchmarks against the likes of the galaxy s5 , sony xperia , motorola droid turbo , droid maxx , fuck , even the droid mini has better battery life and processing speed . 
  even with the 64-bit , it 's processor is still less effective and efficient than the 32-bit snapdragon 805 , or even the 803 in many phones . 
  iphone 's camera is about the only aspect of the phone that consistently comes out on top . 
  uhm , no . 
  that 's not even remotely true . 
  besides this sub-thread being a clusterfuck of wrong statements and both apple and android fanboys pulling bullshit out of their asses :, 
  take a look at recent benchmarks , the iphone 6 is almost everywhere on top or at least in the top 3-5 . 
  even the droid turbo that you mentioned is basically on par with or slower than the iphone 6 ( at least according to geekbench scores ) :, 
  droid turbo results :, 
  single-core : 1089, 
  multi-core : 2932, 
  iphone 6 results :, 
  single-core : 1630, 
  multi-core : 2972, 
  and lest not forget that benchmark results are n't everything ; it basically boils down to : does this device work absolutely fluently and does it offer excellent performance ? 
  the iphone regularly smokes competitors in this regard ( though the really old iphones will in fact usually get slower with the newest ios updates ; that 's something apple should improve drastically ) . 
   and yet you completely ignore memory and battery life , which are two of the most important benchmarks ,, 
  memory : while i agree that apple should have finally given the iphone 6 the same amount of ram ( 2 gb ) they gave the ipad air 2 ( and it might come back biting them in the ass in 2-3 years with ios 10/11 ) it is n't a big issue . 
  on the ipads with less than 2 gb it can get annoying if one browses with more than 5-6 open tabs and they refresh after you multi-tasked into several other apps . 
  but on the iphone there have been maybe a few several situations at max where i thought : `` godddaaaammnit , i need more ram !! '' . 
  nevertheless : an absolutely valid point to criticize . 
  apple is ** far ** from perfect . 
  battery : again , valid aspect to criticize !, 
  i would 've preferred if apple did n't choose to make the iphone 6 even thinner and instead just put in a bigger battery . 
  having said that : the iphone 6 's battery life is still above average :, 
   not to mention ** the two ** where the iphone gets absolutely smoked by most android phones , and instead churn out several benchmarks that essentially all say the same thing : `` iphone can web browse fast . '', 
  `` the two '' what ? 
  please tell me what kind of benchmarks are important then . 
  what exactly is important when using a smartphone ? 
  it has to be ( and feel ) fast in everyday use . 
  that 's where iphones perform ** excellent ** . 
  i honestly do n't know why people like you have made it their apparent goal in life to paint `` the competitor 's '' product as the absolute worst and as a crappy piece of junk . 
  there is n't just black and white . 
  the iphone absolutely has its flaws , minor and major . 
  but on the other hand it still is one of the absolute best smartphones available - with excellent performance ( to come back to the original statement i replied to ) . 
  i ca n't even ... 
   i 've been in a few of these and realized shortly what they were trying to accomplish . 
  after the others on my team gave up from being overpowered and left , i generally removed myself from the scheduled gameplay area and went sight seeing , like , on the other side of the map , until the creators starting sending aggravated messages . 
  they left . 
  i won . 
  sure , some matches lasted 30 minutes or more , but i had a good time . 
  usually hid and read a comic or two . 
  this is ... 
  genius !, 
  how minimalistic of you !, 
  it 's so fucking absurd :, 
   `` any decision made by the kcc could impact at&t 's business operations in the area , which is why we asked to intervene in the proceeding , '' at&t told the eagle . 
  `` at&t remains interested in both broadband issues and the work of the kcc . '', 
  wtf ?? 
  hmm ... good question . 
  no reason at all to quote the whole comment . 
   maybe because i replied before my first coffee and just hit the quote button . 
  i 'm usually rather careful what to quote . 
  this sounds like made up bullshit . 
  jesus christ , who gives a shit ? 
  you hoped this ? 
   horrible battery compared to note 4, 
  oh really ? 
   as one can see above , the galaxy note 4 has a noticeable uplift in battery life when compared to the galaxy s5 and lasts significantly longer than the galaxy note 3 . 
  it does n't last quite as long as the iphone 6 plus , but few people should have issues getting through a full day of intensive use . 
  does n't seem too bad , right ? 
  ** do ** you ? 
  ** chuck **, 
  and ( besides being available for much longer ) i think it 's even better on ios since the activation lock basically ` bricks ' the iphone as long as you do n't enter your password . 
  even a factory reset wo n't help ( though i 'm not up to speed if jailbreak and/or other unlocks can circumvent it ) . 
  i do . 
  on the iphone 6 the impact is n't even remotely noticeable . 
  did he fuck brittany ? 
  this is sooo fucked up . 
  exactly !, 
  after 10 seconds of the prison cell scene i was like : `` yeah ok fuck whatever , kill yourself already , i want to know what happens next . 
  adbfire comes to my mind .
