  works perfectly fine !, 
  what the hell ?!, 
  `` submitted 9 hours ago '' and no one delivered yet ? 
  do i really have to do this ? 
  alright ... 
  assaulted with a charged drink . 
  how do you know that someone is using the cloud-to-butt extension ? 
  they 'll tell you . 
   thankfully you can set the font size yourself . 
  from tiny to huge ( actual names ) . 
  padding adapts with the font size . 
  you might have tried the older version where you had to toggle the ` compact mode ' setting to go to smaller padding . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  once you 've set up alienblue the way you want it ( font size , compact yes or no , ... ) it 's absolutely awesome and very efficient :, 
  [ workflow for ios ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334 ), 
  it 's sort of an ` automator ' for ios and has been released just yesterday . 
  ca n't wait to see the workflows people are going to come up with . 
  one that is already handy for me : create a pdf file from the current web page ( that i can then send via email or save in dropbox ) . 
  here is an interesting description on macstories :, 
  you have n't really thought this through , buddy . 
  who is ari ? 
  that 's what he was saying ... ? 
  wtf ? 
  haha , ok , i give up . 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about :d, 
  your edge certainly would have cut right through the ipad . 
   i did the same thing , but accepted the feeling * and let everything go . 
  you mean you shat yourself . . ? 
  no you did n't . 
  it should work with these steps :, 
  - url * ( edit : sorry , this part is not useful if you want to use your workflow as an action extension ; i 'm using it for one specific web page , that 's why i 'm using a static url ) *, 
  - get content of web pages, 
  - get text from input, 
  - evernote action, 
  could you try that ? 
  since it would be connected to the internet i would suggest `` networked entertainment station '' or nes . 
  relax !, 
  i often just try to place the next shot slightly next to or behind the enemy tank . 
  every second time it works and i kill the engineer . 
  well done , guys . 
  let 's wrap this up . 
   well -1 to ethics . 
  he cheated on dita von tease, 
  maybe this typo was intentional , but it 's dita von ** teese ** , 
  on osx just click any word with 3 fingers . 
  aww , shucks !, 
   i feel like the buns are probably better than, 
   the deep fried battered stuff ,, 
  maybe/probably . 
   the burger itself, 
   and the sauces . 
  yes ( depends on how big the average eaten portion of sauce is ) . 
  let 's agree to disagree . 
  fat is n't necessarily bad ( or worse ) than white bread . 
  depends on the burger joint/restaurant and several other factors as well of course . 
  not on alien blue ( or many other mobile clients ) . 
  it would n't be too much though to just email/copy the comment to yourself . 
  better . 
  holy shit , you 're right !, 
  `` see you soon !, 
  your secret santa , kim '', 
  elijael woodcliff, 
  oooh , i fu ** ing love dobos torte/cake , and this one looks especially delicious !, 
  x-com : enemy within & expansion, 
  glad we could clear this up . 
  i would n't care if my wife had sex with other women . 
  is this so terrible ? 
   but you would care if she had sex with a man ? 
  that 's really my question to op . 
  yes , i would care ( sorry , i forgot to include this in my reply and did n't make it clear ) . 
   i do n't see how someone could care about one and not the other , what 's the difference between the two ? 
  well , for me the difference is : one would be a man , the other would be a women , simple as that . 
  i ca n't really explain it right now ( on mobile and going to bed now ) but i might take the time tomorrow morning and try to elaborate . 
  i honestly think that i have n't taken a look at my trophies on my ps4 ( or achievements on the 360 ) . 
  not once . 
  do not upvote !, 
  u2 - live at slane castle ( 2001 ), 
  i know that u2 get a lot of hate here on reddit but to be honest i do n't care  say what you will about them but watch a few minutes of this show and tell me that they were n't absolutely on fire . 
  the whole concert was freaking awesome and filled with energy and that special atmosphere of ... awesomeness . 
  a truly special night imo and a quite good concert dvd/video . 
  holy moly !, 
  i never thought that i would ever see an update to this game . 
  awesome !, 
  i think it was my first or second game ever on the iphone !, 
  funny to think about `` openfeint '' again , 
  weak ... very weak . 
  now go get outside and catch some fresh air . 
  i 'll buy it for 5 $ !, 
  compensation for inferiority feelings :, 
   superiority complex is a psychological defense mechanism in which a person 's feelings of superiority counter or conceal his or her feelings of inferiority . 
  the term was coined by alfred adler as part of his school of individual psychology . 
  because what you 're posting is crazy conspiracy bulls *** ? 
  i 'm offended by ... lamp !, 
  that 's what i tell my wife every morning . 
  they = boko haram, 
  us = educated and peaceful societies, 
   something something ** keming **, 
  you bastard !!, 
   exactly , the iphone 6 by no means has latest and greatest hardware like he seems to think , it 's almost identical to that of the n4 . 
  uhm ...
