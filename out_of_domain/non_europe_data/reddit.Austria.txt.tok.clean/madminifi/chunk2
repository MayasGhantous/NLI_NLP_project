  icloud or local itunes backup ? 
  the only thing that really prevented me from ever doing a ** completely ** clean install ( ios 2/3/4 / 5/6/7beta ) is that really i want to keep my text messages ( they date back to 2007 ... it might seem stupid but not keeping them is not an option ) . 
  is there any way to set up the iphone as a completely new device but still keep the messages ( via iexplorer or similar ? ) . 
  i think it is/was possible with a jailbroken device by backing up the sms.db and copying it back on the device after the clean restore ... but i 'm not sure a ) if or when ios 7 will get a jailbreak and b ) if this could lead to potential sms database errors . 
  any ideas ? 
  that 's the spirit !, 
  damn it !, 
  ooooh , look at mr. fantsy pants going to the opera !!!, 
   how samsung increased the screen size and resolution, 
  that 's not `` innovation '' per se . 
  resolution maybe , but the increased screen size is only positive/interesting for people who want big screens . 
  i would n't want a phone with a screen as big as the s4 's . 
   doubled the ram, 
  what does that do for me ? 
  ( do n't get me wrong : i 'm not arguing that no one would need more ram ... but i prefer if the manufacturer finds the `` golden mean '' ... more ram = more battery consumption ), 
   switched from an 8 megapixel camera to a 13, 
  more megapixel do ** not ** equal a better camera . 
  while i 'm all for improving the camera year over year i 'm actually ** happy ** that they did n't increase the mp . 
   added lte, 
  well , you could theoretically argue that the iphone 5 already had lte , so there 's that . 
  but i understand that your point was it was a quite big improvement to the s3 and therefor not an `` off year '' ... still : lte in widespread use is year ( s ) old already . 
   and increased the battery capacity by a whopping 500mah ( 1/3 of the iphone 's capacity ) to compensate for the new features , all while packing it into a smaller frame ? 
  tell me how that 's an off year . 
  to be honest the smaller frame is the only `` innovation '' that i think is relevant and noteworthy . 
  smaller bezels is something i think apple should be definitely working on ( and most probably something they are working on ) . 
  i just do n't get how someone can claim that the change from the s3 to s4 is so much bigger . 
  almost ** everyone ** including 98 % of the media ( not that i give ** too ** much on the media 's opinion ) were of the opinion that the s4 was nothing more than a `` tick '' - upgrade from the s3 . 
  actually there is no stutter at all ( ios7 beta , iphone 5 ) - it 's more the duration of the animation ( s ) that cause this annoying feeling . 
  the only thing apple would need to do is to reduce the duration of the animation . 
  except they did n't . 
   compared to the iphone x to the iphone xs , the s4 is miles ahead in product development . 
  please tell me how so ? 
   adding more ram does not significantly impact battery . 
  but it does have an impact . 
  that 's a fact . 
   even if it did , samsung increased the capacity . 
  yes , by putting a bigger battery inside . 
  while that is of course positive it 's not a huge `` accomplishment '' in any way . 
   this is n't about the s4 being a better phone , it 's about the company making improvements in many areas rather than simply adding a fingerprint scanner , dual flash , and an unnecessary 64bit processor . 
  again : please tell me what significant improvements the s4 brought compared to the s3 . 
   the general opinion was and is that it was a rather lackluster , incremental update . 
  not that this is ** bad ** per se - but i do n't see any huge improvements . 
   unless you 're playing infinity blade , you 're not going to care about the processor , since nothing in ios is very demanding . 
  nothing on android is `` very demanding '' ( or much more demanding ; yes , multitasking works a little bit different , but i do n't see how that 's a significant advantage in - my - everyday usage ; the 3 main advantages android has for me are : deeper access for apps like tasker , side loading of apks & the intent system/concept ) as well . 
   you 're stuck in your little apple world where the things they say and do are god 's word . 
  open up . 
  but do n't buy a samsung phone . 
  hehe , you so obviously have no idea what you are talking about . 
  first of all i am not `` stuck '' in `` my little apple world '' . 
  i 'm constantly trying out and using different phones , especially android phones ( since android 4 . x upwards does n't suck anymore but is actually ** really ** good ) including the htc g1 ( god , that sucked ) , the galaxy s2 , the s3 & amp ; s4 , htc one , sony xperia z , nexus galaxy , nexus 4 , ... 
  many of them are actually pretty damn good ( especially the xperia z , the nexus 4 and the htc one ... not getting warm with the samsung phones though ) . 
  just because i still prefer the iphone/ios does n't mean that i do n't like android or that i 'm `` stuck in my little apple world '' . 
  not everything is black and white and as simple as you want it to be . 
  good lord , this article is an awful piece of ** crap ** . 
  did a 13-year old fanboy write this load of shit ? 
  while i do n't think this is going to happen i would very much appreciate it !, 
  this must be so unbelievably , unbearably hard i ca n't even begin to imagine the horror and terrible feelings that you have to go through in such a situation ... :(, 
  my father died 15 years ago in my arms after a heart attack ( i was 14 ) and it almost broke me completely . 
  i was devastated for months and years . 
  but to hear that your loved one is in absolute horror and despair ? 
  god , the idea alone is so horrifying it scares me to death . 
  this is so horrible :(, 
   you forgot a huge expenditure . 
  marketing . 
  they probably spend more on marketing the latest iphone than most other phone companies revenue . 
  not even ** close ** . 
  the exact opposite is the case :, 
  sure , but `` coincidently '' samsung and apple are the only smartphone manufacturers that are actually operating on profit :, 
  good riddance !, 
   i think it 's only a `` hobby '' in that it does n't sell very well ... 
  * excuse * me ?!, 
   `` we 've now sold over 13 million . 
  about half of those in the last year . '', 
  that would mean the company has sold approximately 6.5 million units over the last 12 months . 
   apple tv accounts for 56 percent of all streaming devices sold worldwide , according to select data from the consumer video devices market report published by market research outlet frost & sullivan this week . 
  roku is a not-so-close second with 21.5 percent of all global device sales . 
  i would n't call that `` does n't sell very well '' . 
  to me that sounds like the exact opposite . 
  but of course ( imo ) the original reason for apple to call it a hobby ( 2-3 years ago ) was that in case of disappointing sales they could always say `` well , it 's just a hobby '' , 
  which is innovation as well - even by the `` oldest '' definitions :, 
   in \u00b7 no \u00b7 va \u00b7 tion,

  2 : a new idea , method , or device : novelty, 
  i agree . 
  on a scale from 1-10 i 'd rate this as a 8/10 . 
  12.7 million ** +1 **, 
  he probably deserved it , 
  how sad for you . 
  yeah , because you know ** so ** much about his private life . 
  tell me , how were your weekends at casa jobs ? 
  please , stop it with your facts . 
  this is reddit . 
  apple/jobs bad bad bad . 
  microsoft/gates good . 
  oh , and : apple bad !, 
  do you wan na talk about it ? 
  yes , please !, 
  and then you have to quit your new job again !, 
  your beer pic is out of focus .
