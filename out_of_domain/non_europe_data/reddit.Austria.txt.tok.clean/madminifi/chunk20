  ** what ? ** . 
  that 's not even remotely true . 
  the iphone 6 trumps almost all the android handsets currently available . 
  cpu , gpu & camera, 
  i specifically did n't say `` it 's best '' . 
  i said `` trumps almost all the android handsets currently available '' ... which is accurate for the camera as well . 
  of course it depends , no doubt . 
  but even from a rather objective point of view ( i.e. 
  benchmarks testing the performance ) the iphone 6 is better than almost all the android phones , performance wise . 
  please note : i 'm not saying it 's `` the best '' , it is n't !, 
  edit : i replied to the rather bizarre statement that the n4 is almost identical ( hardware wise ) to the iphone 6 - it 's not even close . 
  flowers ? 
   jeez , the bleeding hearts come out of the woodwork every time * one * things happens in the middle east . 
  you know , just * this * weekend a mother set her baby on fire and left it in the street ( nj ) . 
  a woman was shot at a bus station by her husband ( pa ) . 
  a mall was shot up in florida by crazy man . 
  and what exactly does this have to do with a punishment ordered by the government ? 
  considering how fast players usually shoot i would say you could summarize these two under step 1 . 
  huh ? 
  it does n't have to be `` someone 's fight '' to call out a backwards justice system . 
  just no . 
  stop it . 
  edit : oh my god , i 'm sorry !, 
  i absolutely fucked up and thought you meant chicago style pizza . 
  new york style pizza is actually pretty good . 
  i still prefer the classic neapolitan though , even better . 
  he claimed that he does n't know potatoes . 
  now i want a bbq & smoked bacon sandwich . 
  season 1 was excellent ... in a cheesy , soap-opery way , but still very good . 
  from season 2 on it went downhill rapidly . 
  season 3 and especially 4 are so absurdly stupid it hurts . 
  since the beginning of season 4 i only watch it when i 'm drunk ... 
  i still want to know what will happen , but i ca n't bear it when sober .

  they bought the company with the best fingerprint solution for smartphones , everyone knows that . 
  clever move . 
  it 's like saying `` google prevented android from appearing on the iphone '' or `` google prevented nest thermostat from appearing under the apple brand '' . 
  yep , they bought the company with the best fingerprint solution for smartphones . 
  it 's like saying `` google prevented android from appearing on the iphone '' or `` google prevented nest from appearing under the apple brand '' . 
  yeah , read about rumored developments both on apple 's and other manufacturer 's sides . 
  ca n't wait to see how well this works , could be nice . 
  maybe the dublin irish pub ?

  woah , dude !, 
   reddit tends to be very pro-apple, 
  haha .

  best joke i 've read all day . 
  psa : try adding ** / hls ** at the end of the streams url . 
  it works for many channels/streams , e.g. 
  you have to deactivate your adblocker though or the video/stream wo n't load . 
  that is absolutely and 100 % not true . 
  i 'm on my way to a dinner right now but if i find the time i will clarify how wrong that is .

   `` possible infection methods, 
   the exact methods of installing these malware is unknown . 
  however , we do know that the ios device does n't have to be jailbroken per se . 
  we have seen one instance wherein a lure involving xagent simply says `` tap here to install the application . '' ** the app uses apple 's ad hoc provisioning ** , which is a standard distribution method of apple for ios app developers . 
  through ad hoc provisioning , the malware can be installed simply by clicking on a link , such as in the picture below . 
  the link will lead to https://www . 
  { blocked } / adhoc/xagent . plist , a service that installs applications wirelessly . '', 
  so basically ( as long as different `` infection '' / intrusion methods are detected ) users of non-jailbroken devices are only in danger if they install apps from outside the appstore by ** actively ** accepting 3rd party ad hoc provisioning profiles . 
   edit : checked out your comment history for some pointers on how to be myself . 
  found some serious wisdom from you . . 
  ah , yes , the obvious sign of classiness !, 
  searching through others comment history ... 
  may i ask how old you are ? 
  only if it 's not too personal/indiscreet . 
  okay , thanks for your reply . 
  i was asking because on one hand i found your point of view interesting and on the other hand i had almost the exact same opinion when i was in my mid - and late-twenties ... yet i can see it changing year over year now . 
  of course i 'm not saying that ** everyone ** will `` change his mind '' once he gets older and it 's perfectly fine to feel and live this way . 
  i just found it interesting , 
   you kno ' nuthin ', 
  ftfy, 
  not only for your progress in body composure but also in battling your depression . 
  keep going , that 's awesome !, 
  how was he `` taunting '' you ? 
   i once read that an adult human body generates between 150 and 200w depending on the size and metabolism of the person .

  you know there 's a difference between mp3 and aac ? 
  256 kbps aac compressed/encoded files are usually ( blind tests ) considered to sound better or at least equally good compared to 320 kbps mp3 files . 
  oh hey , mr. edgy is here !, 
  if by `` conflicted '' you mean `` subscribed as of now '' then i agree !, 
  no , of course not . 
  and while i agree that you should be able to uninstall/remove default apps like newsstand etc. 
  i would n't ** exactly ** call them bloatware , since they never ever eat system resources or get in your way ** unless ** you open them yourself . 
  of course they eat storage on the phone but typical bloatware is usually way worse than just 4-5 inactive apps sitting in a folder and not bothering you . 
  since aac has been better than most mp3s . 
   if only the phone i mentioned and linked to was in this graph . 
   also , why is a javascript benchmark relevant ? 
  it measures the quality of the javascript engine . 
  it 's relevant to a certain extent because what matters to customers/users after all is the performance of the device in every day use cases ( e.g. 
  browsing the web ) . 
  and the iphone 6 trumps almost all the other devices in other benchmarks as well .
