  besides : so the galaxy a7 might be/is `` faster '' the the iphone 6 . 
  wow , what an achievement for a phone that got released ~ 5 months after the iphone 6 . 
  it does n't change the fact that the iphone 6 is still one of the fastest devices available right now , believe it or not . 
   i never said it was n't . 
  i only said it was overpriced , for what hardware you get . 
  define `` overpriced '' . 
  to quote another comment from this thread ( edit : http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2xhx5e/android_claims_815_of_the_global_smartphone_os/cp0mq2i ) :, 
   if it 's selling , it 's not overpriced . 
  if it 's topping the benchmarks , it 's not overpriced . 
  if it does what it should , seemingly snappier , it 's not overpriced . 
  yeah , because after that unbelievable bendgate disaster we heard sooo much about bent iphones , right ? 
  right ?!, 
  * crickets *, 
  gr8 r8s , b8s !, 
  32 year old me still has . 
  do n't know why you downvoted . 
  it 's most certainly at the cote d'azur ... 
  i was thinking of nice but monaco is equally probable . 
  sticky bomb . 
  spotted the guy with the backwards baseball cap !, 
  i would n't even be mad . 
  ** what ? 
  more like ** weapon decreases **, 
  that last hit on shanghai ... noiiiice !, 
  sraw 4 life , i love that little monster . 
  yeah , that 's the only reason to buy them ... a little pretentious and ignorant , huh ?

  it has ( allegedly ) been patched since ios 8.1.1 ( released november ' 14 ) . 
  i can only assume that / u / __ nightshaded __ is a black guy as well ? 
  love the kill cam ... him sitting there in the other chopper , sulking . 
  former sony ericsson k800i user and fan checking in !, 
  i absolutely loved the camera cover and shutter button . 
  plus it had a xenon flash and 3.2 mp ( back in ~ 2006 ) . 
  sure , it was thick as fuck but the pictures were awesome - still have a collection of hundreds of photos from back then and especially the low light pictures & xenon flash turned out rather excellent . 
  yawn , 14y old trolls like you are so boring . 
  i honestly expected him to punch the guy in the end . 
  popkey is quite ok and saving gifs in the camera roll works fine , but i can really recommend `` riffsy gif keyboard '' :, 
  \u201e gif keyboard `` von riffsy , inc, 
  once you get the hang of it it 's awesome . 
  you can search for gifs ( keywords ) in the keyboard interface itself , you can save favorite gifs in your own collections and you can save gifs from safari through an extension . 
  try it out , it 's free . 
  holy nostalgia , batman !, 
  say ** whaaaat ** ?!, 
  the wood flooring is ( imo ) one of the best parts in this photograph . 
  i love this style of wood flooring , it 's very common here in austria in high end buildings/apartments . 
  different tastes i guess  but what is it that you do n't like about it ? 
  interesting ( honestly ) !, 
   as i said it 's one of the most popular/fancied types of floor in the middle - to high-end market . 
  may i ask what kind of floors you would prefer ? 
  wood floors but in a different style ? 
  or something else completely ? 
  i see , thanks for sharing !, 
  to be honest , it 's the first thing i do when i 'm playing with close friends as well . 
  yeah , i 've read about these incidents several times now ... sounds freaking strange and thought-provoking . 
  further quotes from the report :, 
   `` at that point ** the first officer felt overwhelmed , he could no longer overview the scenario , could no longer process the arriving information and had difficulty to focus on single aspects of the scenario . 
  ** the captain felt that while manually flying the aircraft ** he was at the upper limit of what he was capable to do in his bad bodily shape . 
   the first officer described the time between 1800 feet and touchdown as an eternity , he was however able to recognize that the aircraft had reached and was maintaining correct approach speed and realized they had not worked the landing checklist . 
  he thus processed the landing checklist ** which required all his efforts ** , it was difficult to process the checklist , ** it was difficult to concentrate and think . 
   both pilots reported that just prior to landing ** they perceived their situation as surreal and like in a dream . 
   the aircraft touched down on the runway , the automatic brakes slowed the aircraft to about 40 knots , the captain subsequently applied manual brakes , the aircraft began to skid , the captain however managed to slow the aircraft to taxi speed and vacate the runway via taxiway a3 . 
  he then joined taxiway a and handed controls to the first officer to be able to talk to emergency services . 
  ** the first officer totally focussed on steering the aircraft that he did not get anything that happened around him . 
   the first officer wanted to open his side window , but needed three attempts to do so . 
  ** after the window was open he removed his oxygen masks , but immediately noticed the acrid smell again ** and donned his oxygen mask again . 
   following landing the aircraft was checked by airline maintenance ** who identified de-icing fluid as source of the smell ** . 
  the technicians reported that they could clearly detect the odour even 15 minutes after landing . 
   the bfu does not entirely rule out the following scenario :, 
  - smell development due to malfunctioning electrical or electronical systems on board, 
   and stated : `` such a contamination of the air in the cockpit or a local smell development due to an electrical malfunction could not entirely be ruled out . 
  ** the bfu has knowledge of cases in which e.g. 
  a tantalum capacitor developed an intense smell . 
  it was a temporarily extremely unpleasant smell which forced the crew to don their oxygen masks . 
  ** determination of the cause was difficult because often these tantalum capacitors only serve as buffer amplifiers in electrical gadgets . 
  even if a component were defective the electronic system would still be fully functional and it would be very difficult to identify the `` burnt '' tantalum capacitor . '', 
   the bfu reported that ** the captain recovered and was fit to fly after 4 days ** , the ** first officer needed 6 months to recover ** and become fit to fly again . 
  something interesting and maybe relevant in this context :, 
   ( ... ) jet engines require synthetic oils for lubrication . 
  these oils contain ingredients such as tricresyl phosphate ( tcp ) , an organophosphate , which can be toxic to humans in quantities much larger than are found in aviation engine oil . 
  [ 2 ] engine bearing seals are installed to ensure that critical engine bearings are continuously lubricated , and to prevent engine oil from leaking into the compressed air stream . 
  ** if a bearing seal fails and begins to leak , depending on the location of the seal , some amount of engine oil may be released into the compressed air stream . 
  oil leaks may be detected by an odour akin to hot frying-pan fume , or , in more serious cases , by smoke in the cabin . 
  [ 2 ] this is known in the industry as a fume event . 
  maybe ( i honestly have no ` expertise ' whatsoever , just sifting through several articles and information ) that 's what happened here ( or something similar ) and the crew got incapacitated rapidly . 
  i hope the snickers ad agency has already brokered a deal with clarkson for their next spot . 
  exactly !, 
  he did n't know shit about cooper or that a crew might be coming for him already . 
  his plan was all along to lure a potential crew to his planet and steal their spaceship . 
  psa : ** interstellar spoilers ** down below in this sub-thread !, 
  the way i understood it was that he just wanted to get his sorry ass off this planet - and did n't he confess to cooper that the planet actually was n't habitable ? 
  i honestly hope that her husband is leaving her . 
  what an entitled b. ... 
  evolution at work !, 
  who cares ? 
  no , they ** know ** it . 
  and those tablets were soo great and not a total joke at all . 
  hahahaha ... !, 
  but should n't it actually be `` volkssport '' with ** two ** 's ' ? 
   drifting for life,
