  ftfy, 
  *** lol ***, 
  some say they 're still spinning and spinning and spinning . . 
   do you needs ports ** or long battery life ** ? 
  if not , buy a mac . 
  the average battery life of macbooks is far better than ~ 90 % of other laptops . 
  but keep jerking your little anti-apple boner . 
  good lord , are you still using pop3 ? 
  please do n't tell me you 're still using pop3 ?!, 
  the joke . 
  is it that ? 
  seriously , fuck him ... 
  ** engineer/mechanic 4 life !, 
  and in bf : h we get the amazing goodie in form of the satellite phone/spawn beacon . 
  can be a deciding factor in winning or losing , especially in `` blood money '' when you suddenly have to either rob the enemy 's vault or defend your own . 
  this is a crazy-amazing idea !, 
  yes it is , but it should 've probably been chandler from friends in his improv class . 
  we need a robbencam, 
  i absolutely love gta and i play gta online regularly but the connection problems are really really f ** ing tiring and annoying . 
  i do n't get why you got downvoted so much , this episode was terrible , geez . 
  that 's one of the worst analogies i have ever read on the internet . 
  itt : brain-melting , stupid comments . 
  you acting ( sic ! ), 
  like apple is n't already working on something similar ( ar ) for months if not years . 
  they just are n't promoting it yet since they probably have n't developed something they deem ready . 
  nevertheless : i love microsoft for what they 're doing right now and in the recent months and hololens looks awesome . 
  he nailed it . 
  i 'm using it on a 2011 macbook air and so far it works without any hiccups or problems . 
  yep , if used in moderation it can be pretty amazing . 
  not to give anyone ideas but it saved me a few times when for example i had to pull all-nighters to finish a paper . 
  of course i could 've just started earlier but i 'm too stupid and/or lazy for that . 
  maybe both ? 
  this is poetry . 
  you have to call lester on the in game phone . 
  then you can set the bounty . 
   i do n't need to try the other hot dogs to know ours ( danish ) is the top dog . 
  bun intended !, 
  ftfy, 
  you just misunderstood his wording . 
  he said :, 
   i thought he was going up the tower but i never thought he would succeed in helping her, 
  meaning that while watching the scene he thought that reek was actually going up the tower but op never expected reek to finally succeed with helping sansa ( e.g. 
  being surprised by ramsay in the tower or stopped by someone else ) . 
  germany certainly would n't win . 
  it 's long but thick as well !, 
  would ** have **, 
  husband of a 5 month pregnant wife here , what have i done ? 
  thanks , now i feel ... better ? 
  at least i stopped smoking 1 year ago , so there 's that . 
  are you fucking kidding me ??!!!, 
  damnit , thats beyond impressing !, 
  thanks , sound assvice . 
    ... from 4chan, 
  that 's weird . 
  communists hate him !, 
  guys , the trees !, 
  what a nice and quick answer to that irregular goal , 
  no seriously , type faster . 
  ( edit : sorry , you already posted part 2 ; it did n't show up at first on mobile ), 
  maybe boutique 5 hotel on rhodes , greece . 
  you 'd have to book the biggest suite though ( if i remember correctly it 's the executive suite ) since it 's the only one where the private pool and terrace are completely private . 
  maybe in ios 12 !, 
  tell us which district ( or at least area , if you 're particularly paranoid  you live in . 
  i can recommend one in the 5th district : sale e pepe http://saleepepe.at, 
  hehehehehe . 
  edit : in case anyone wonders why :, 
  fuck him . 
  haha !, 
  austrian here : this card was well deserved . 
  oidaaaaaaaa i packs neeeeeed !!!!!, 
  the cheering was more about the qualification than about beating sweden . 
  have you watched one of austrias recent games ? 
  take a look at the elo rankings : austria in the global top 20 and in the european top 10 . 
  i know !, 
  and i would n't even go so far as to wish you a drop out . 
  this clear win on your home turf is enough revenge . 
  sorry , no upper case `` scharfes s '' here :, 
  ( ios 9 gm ), 
  probably :, 
  - add photos / images, 
  - add drawings / sketches, 
  - add lists, 
  - add formatting, 
  op , do n't you see those features at all ? 
  they have n't . 
  i had the plan to casually masturbate after getting up in the next minutes . 
  i changed my plan . 
  my question : how did you manage not to throw up ? 
  holy fucking shit . 
  do you have any reputable sources for this ? 
  honest question . 
   you 'd be hard-pressed to convince an average person to be willing to spend $ 600 or more on a new phone , which is often times more than a tablet ( unless you 're an iphone fanboy , in which case apple 's got you brainwashed anyway , you 'll buy whatever they want you to ) . 
  so because i 'm willing to spend $ 600-800 this makes me a brainwashed iphone fanboy ... ? 
  so because there are a few hundred ( ? ), 
  nutjobs with too much time on their hand , iphone users in general are brainwashed . 
  ok , sure ... , 
  oh really ? 
  because i was dead serious about it ... 
  thanks, 
  huh ?
