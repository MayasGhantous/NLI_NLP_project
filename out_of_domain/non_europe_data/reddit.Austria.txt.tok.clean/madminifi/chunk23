  european here and i always tip the delivery guy . 
  always . 
  not that this matters for you but i do n't have a single issue with frame drops on my 6s . 
  from the top of my head :, 
  - whatsapp, 
  - telegram, 
  - imessage, 
  i 'm sorry , i stand corrected . 
  i honestly never swiped up that slow but now that i tried it : i definitely notice some small stuttering in the last few moments of swiping up . 
  and the lens was dirty at least for some of the photos , as you stated above . 
  look , i really appreciate that you took the time and went out there to take some pictures for comparison . 
  but that 's a really ** bad ** way to do it . 
  the average file size for photos taken with the iphone 6s is between 2,2 and 3mb . 
  the small file sizes are ** very ** strange . 
  the office ( us ), 
  wtf !, 
  noooiiiice !, 
   what a loser . 
  sounds about right . 
  how about #scratchcrackburnbendgate ? 
  or maybe just #crapgate ? 
  ( i see . . sarcasm concerning excessive media hype is n't welcome here . 
  sorry guys , did n't mean to insult anyone , 
  it 's called `` gamma thingy '' and i 'm using it on my non-jailbroken iphone . 
  it works fine although they are still working out the kinks concerning background updates .

  audiogalaxy !, 
  oops , you beat me to it , 
  cheeky bastard !, 
  i 'm not 100 % sure and might get back to you for confirmation but i think sub zero might be the brand . 
  stop whining about consoles , that 's so pathetic . 
  maybe they should switch teams ? 
  not to take them , tbh . 
  sorry for being snarky ... and ** sorry ** for being on this sub although i 'm not raving of benzos . 
  to be honest , the reason for being on this sub is that i witnessed the devastating effects of benzos in my family and i wanted to learn more about them . 
  god dammit apple !, 
  boom !, 
  magic !, 
  i 'm not a huge proponent of `` widgets widgets widgets !!! '', 
  but to be honest especially the bigger ios devices could use a more flexible home screen . 
  something like this concept would even fit with apples simplicity imo : http://www.nextpowerup.com/news/9124/beautiful-ios-8-concept-adds-widgets-to-ios/ ( video : http://youtu.be/qvhsozmmciu ), 
  it really is a matter of taste . 
  the size of the iphone 5s is still one of my favourite sizes - while i got used to the iphone 6 and would n't like to miss the big screen , i 'd be happy about smaller bezels for example . 
  but i do n't want to go back to a 4 '' screen . 
  my wife on the other hand did n't upgrade to the iphone 6 or 6s because the phone is simply too big for her taste - she 's still using her 5s and waiting for an iphone 6s/7 mini or something . 
  let 's hope the rumours are true . 
  you 're almost right . 
   i think the edges of the iphone 5s casing/enclosure had a more `` premium '' feeling to them . 
   i will bet money that he was terrified and cowering in the corner when it all came to an end . 
  i agree and think the same - and i actually hope that this was the case . 
  i hope that he spent his last minutes and seconds of his pathetic life in utter fear and terror . 
  `` i think , therefore i am . '', 
  you can do this with built in tools in ios . 
  open the pdf preview and then click the tool box in the lower right corner . 
  i can try later and get back to you with feedback . 
  okay , tested it with a logitech bluetooth keyboard : hate to disappoint you bit reeder does n't support any keyboard shortcuts at the moment . 
  which you do n't need 3d touch for to be fair . 
  this is the best thing i 've seen on the internet today . 
  that 's funny ( honestly ... 
  i do n't get the craft beer circlejerk ) , but there is a middle ground between bud light and unicorn urine / craft beer . 
  best example of `` even bad publicity is good publicity '' . 
  always buy a boat !, 
  well you 're certainly joking but let 's talk again in 5-10 years . 
  time 's flying , huh ... 
  i think there 's this exact template even for imovie on the iphone . 
  that 's some epic shit right there !, 
  love the bf music , 
  me too , 
   group f is ridiculously easy for portugal . 
  we 'll see about that , 
  how exactly is quick reply on android better than on ios ? 
  honest question . 
  i ca n't find an option for post-purchase upgrades , so i 'd say no . 
  thanks for clarifying !, 
  source : me . 
  your job 's a joke, 
  you 're broke, 
  what ? 
  oooh , look at that badass over here . 
  have to compensate much ? 
  austrian here , and i can only agree ... hotodog sausages are crap compared to `` real '' sausages - of course from time to time i 'll eat one as well and enjoy it . 
  but it 's nothing compared to a freshly grilled bratwurst or similar . 
  the thing is that there are like 100 different types ( of course i 'm exaggerating a little bit here ) of `` bratwurst '' ... 
  i use it as a general term for a type of sausage ( ideally hand made ) . 
  but i bet that irish sausage is absolutely awesome as well . 
  if these were ipads instead this submission would have 3600 upvotes and around 2548 comments making fun of apple . 
  edit : i 'm by the way not saying that those sensationalist headlines do n't suck . 
  i 'm just saying that the apple-hating / technology-army would be up in arms about it . 
  and you know i 'm right . 
   have a nice day !, 
  ( seriously ... have you ever read / technology over the course of the last 3-4 years ? 
  every single time there 's remotely negative news about apple it gets upvoted into reddit heaven ... 
  i 'm not even complaining , it 's just funny to observe , 
  exactly my point ...  if this happened with ipads ( no matter if it was a network issue ) people would go crazy and mock apple , hehe . 
  i do n't know if its because i 'm using the iphone 6s ( because of 2gb ram vs 1gb ) now or if it 's due to a recent 9 . x update but for a few months now 3rd party keyboards work far better than when i used them in my iphone 6 . 
  to be more precise : i 'm using swiftkey as my default keyboard and it works 98 % of the time like a charm . 
  very very very seldom there 's a bug where it wo n't load at first , but that happens around once a month .
