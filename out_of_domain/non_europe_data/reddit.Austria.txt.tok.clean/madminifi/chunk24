  in the 1\u00a01/2 years before every second time the 3rd party keyboard did n't load at all and i had to force quit the app . 
  there 's definitely still room for optimization but for a few months now it works definitely good enough for me to us swiftkey as my default keyboard . 
  edit : forget it , i 'm stupid , 
  i almost woke up my wife and my baby girl from chuckling too hard at this picture . 
  well done :d, 
  i 'll look into it . 
  or ... maybe try not to think in `` years '' , it 's weird in this context . 
  cute ... 
  and you 'd stand in the corner with sweaty hands if either of them entered the room . 
  3rd party keyboard support has been vastly improved imo . 
  i 've been using swiftkey for the last 18 months and 98 % of the time it works flawlessly . 
  i 'm not saying it 's perfect though , especially on older devices with 1gb ram or less . 
  maybe the whole nest company is fubar . 
  you can try `` lively '' , where you can export gifs or videos from your live photos :, 
  \u201e lively - export live photo to gif and movie `` von tiny whale pte. 
  edit : oops , missed the other post below , someone already recommended it . 
  while technically right the german government would have had the option and right to deny the prosecution ( \u00a7 104a stgb ) .

  except our friend does n't look like mr bean .

  i mean i can understand if you really really want to keep those memories on video to look back on them together in a few months / years / decades . 
  but ... youtube .

  imessage is a load of shit ? 
  that 's new to me ... 
  i 've been using iphones since the very first iphone , that would be 2007 . 
  so there 's that ... 
  i honestly do n't know about gif spamming sessions since usually the friends i message with do n't send more than 1 or 2 gif per ... um ... month . 
  i 'm not saying imessage is perfect and apparently you 're having problems with it , i get that . 
  but imessage is still way way better than several alternatives , like hangouts etc. 
  no yellow card for nagy ? 
  hahaha .

  '' ** apple hates him !!!, 
  ^ 5 ^ reasons ^ why ^ ios10 ^ actually ^ is n't ^ that ^ bad '', 
  no they 're not . 
  the game vs hungary was a disaster and disgrace , yes . 
  but if you would 've watched any of the games in the qualification ( vs sweden or russia ) you would know better . 
  absolutely , i 'm baffled . 
  i 'd say that 90 % of his passes actually failed . 
  what the hell ? 
  who ? 
  yes , although lb just fits him better imo . 
  abysmal performance from him . 
  right now our team is trying to not get completely fucked in the ass . 
  i do n't think they even have the energy to think about the next game . 
  today : yes . 
  usually : no . 
  2nd or 3rd time that he stepped on the players foot .
