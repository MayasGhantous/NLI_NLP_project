  your son might want to leave this earth . 
  yes . 
  apps , app settings , passwords/logins , messages , call history , wallpaper , icon order , folders ... 
  literally everything . 
  yesterday i got my replacement iphone and within 20 minutes i would n't have been able to say which one was the `` old '' and new one , software wise . 
  yes , the fine-grain options are definitely one of android 's typical advantages ( if you need them ) . 
  yes , there are a few solutions that are almost as complete as the ios backup . 
  the latter works seamlessly out of the box though which i see as a huge advantage for the average user . 
  i ca n't offer any advice but i just wanted to tell you that i 've been experiencing the same problem the last 2 days . 
  received my replacement iphone 6s two days ago and wanted to install the beta profile on the new device ( before restoring the ios 9.3.3 beta 4 backup ) . 
  no way to get it to install the profile . 
  i then just restored from my local itunes backup and it worked fine ( beta profile appears as already installed like on the old device ) . 
  woah . 
  it would have been even better ... amazing to think about it . 
  so you 're one of * them * . 
  the overarching plot was so so sooo much better for the show than the procedural style imo . 
   ` maybe you 're better going upstairs until full time then going down ', 
  ftfy, 
  thanks !, 
  wow ... 
  iphone 6s ( plus ) and iphone se support raise their wake . 
  they all feature the m9 chip . 
  it was, 
  flock of seagulls - i ran, 
  and, 
  omd - walking on the milky way, 
  for me . 
  - yes, 
  - add an option ... 
  just think about it ... 
  if for whatever reason those few terrorists were stopped ( either by coincidence or good fbi/cia / ... work ) in time - just a few different decisions of a few ( in this context ) important persons and the world would be so so so much different . 
  maybe there will be ( or already is ? ), 
  a good book about such an alternate reality ... : - /, 
   thanks for pointing this out . 
  remember folks : just because a comment on reddit was given gold or is highly upvoted , does n't necessarily mean it 's true ( referring specifically to jutta9980 's comment ), 
  ... or the one you replied to . 
  how one could make the mistake to compare the palestinian terror attacks and situation to the recent ( i.e. 
  ~ 10-15 years ) terror attacks in western europe / us baffles my mind . 
  evolution . 
  no , you 're doing it exactly right and as intended !, 
  i 'm expecting child care to kick in our door any day now - the neighbors must think we 're torturing our little girl every time we change her diaper . 
  it 's war . 
  buzzfeed hates it !, 
  he got drugged . 
  on the other hand it 's getting more and more powerful - enough for some android users to jump ship . 
  me too . 
  i 'd call myself very tech savvy yet still prefer the iphone to android . 
  98 % percent of the users do n't need it . 
  they just like it for their imaginary dick measurement contests . 
  that 's only funny if you 're a simple minded fanboy . 
  was it an ice cream truck ? 
  * proceeds to sit down at the seat right next to matt , staring into an imaginary black hole *, 
  better than the note 7 , but still ... 
  perfect explanation . 
  i 've already lost my father and two grand parents . . and these losses hurt immensely back then and still hurt today . 
  but even the thought of losing my now 1 year old daughter is so absurdly sad that i have to stop thinking about it . 
  stop stop stop , aaah . 
   as for `` what is better ? '' . 
  assuming you do anything other than web-browse with the lights on or photo-editing , for gaming or movie/tv watching etc va/plasma/oled are going to provide a better overall picture , especially in a dark room . 
  so , basically , what you are saying is :, 
  for everyday use like web browsing , office , work , ... displays like the macbooks ' are perfectly fine . 
  considering that i watch videos and movies almost exclusively on a 60 '' plasma tv and not a tiny laptop screen that 's pretty okay with me . 
  tryhard , go to bed . 
  i would n't even be mad . 
  you make it sound like that 's a challenge . 
  pfft !, 
  6.547 gb on ps4, 
  can you elaborate on that ? 
  while battlefront was an okay game ( i played it for several weeks with friends ) it just was n't battlefield - not even remotely . 
  which is okay , not every shooter has to be battlefield . 
  but battlefield 1 has to . 
  i 'll give it a try in the next days and i honestly hope the similarities to battlefront are few . 
  while i do n't always need 45min-1hr rounds ( most of the time i love them though ) i think that 20min are definitely too short . 
  30min as a default and we have deal !, 
  i agree 100 %, 
  while i do n't always need the epic 1 hour rounds ( although i love , love , love them when i have the time and nerve for it ) i honestly think that 20 minutes is a too short time limit . 
  it would be nice if the default time limit for conquest rounds would be 30 minutes since i do n't want to be `` dependent '' on custom servers alone . 
  usually i avoid `` pinging '' him , but maybe / u/tiggr can get this specific feedback to the guys responsible ? 
  pretty please ? 
  yep . 
  low life virgins laughing their asses off in their basements . 
  pathetic . 
  how in the world did you get a downvote for this comment ? 
  geez ... 
  oooh , fuck you !!!, 
  in theory the new system reduces the reward for running around . 
  but actually it enforces this behaviour and i can tell you why :, 
  ** a ) ** because it rewards blindly capping one flag after another while the reward for holding ( the majority of ) flags has been reduced, 
  ** b ) ** because dieing does n't matter anymore . 
  no ticket loss , so why care to survive ? 
  just run run run and if you die you just respawn without any `` penalty '', 
  the old system is better . 
  i get that in theory the new system should encourage `` tactical '' gameplay ... except it does n't . 
  that would be an amazing game mode / mod . 
  war . 
  war never changes . 
   or even lining up your scope on th canopy of a jet waiting for somebody to spawn on it . 
  you were one of those guys !, 
  did they ?? 
  please , need confirmation !,
