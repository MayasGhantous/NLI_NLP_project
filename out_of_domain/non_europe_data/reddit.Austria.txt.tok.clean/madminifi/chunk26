  this would be a huge improvement !, 
  i call bullshit on that . 
  you 're just angry because you ca n't fly around without any real danger except enemy jets . 
  `` good '' pilots just adapt and stay out of range of aa foot soldiers . 
  that 's why you can equip stinger + co : to deter jets and choppers . 
  and that 's exactly its purpose , 
   how am i supposed to do any real damage to infantry or ground vehicles when they have the advantage of sight , damage , and cover ? 
  by adapting . 
  as soon as the enemy team has a certain amount of aa-equipped players you hold your distance , search for targets , attack and get out of distance again . 
  with flares/ecm that 's not a huge problem . 
  scan , attack and retreat !, 
  since this is a team-play game this is actually part of the strategy and fluid development of a round : when 1 or 2 very good jet pilots force many players on the enemy team to equip stingers / iglas , then they enable the tanks + co to dominate more ( since there are less anti-tank weapons on the ground ) . 
   it you or your team ca n't shoot down an attack jet with a stealth jet , it 's your fault for being bad . 
  if you ca n't avoid being shot down by aa infantry it 's your fault for being bad . 
  look , i get it : it 's not as fun as in bf3 + earlier , but it opens up a more fluid development of a game round : when 1 or 2 very good jet pilots force many players on the enemy team to equip stingers / iglas , then they enable the tanks + co to dominate more ( since there are less anti-tank weapons on the ground ) . 
  i think that 's good , but of course there are lots of different opinions , i accept that - i just do n't agree . 
  do n't feed the idiots then . 
  this ... 
  this is gold . 
  best reddit comment ever . 
  it 's indeed a bug and has been fixed in the latest beta . 
  works perfectly now . 
  holy shit ... this has to be the biggest garbage i 've read on r/soccer in the last years . 
  considering your username i 'm not surprised though . . pathetic , 
  yeah . . `` on average '' implied . 
  i disagree . 
  while , yes , ios 10 might not run as perfectly smooth as ios 6 back then , it still runs ** extremely ** smooth on the iphone 6s / 7 compared to ( almost ) all the android devices out there . 
  since we 're citing the anandtech review :, 
   `` web performance is an interesting case . 
  while apple 's continued increases in single core cpu performance have benefited web performance with each generation , the truth is that improvements mobile safari 's nitro javascript engine have contributed a great deal as well . 
   ** when looking at the charts you can see that there 's a significant gap between the iphone 7 and the next device , with the exception of webxprt where it 's tied . 
  what 's more important than this gap is what the second device actually is . 
  it 's always another apple device , and the same is true for the third device , and the fourth device , and so on . 
  in kraken and jetstream the top seven devices on the chart are apple 's mobile devices , and the charts only have seven apple devices in total . 
  ** the huawei mate 8 is able to move ahead of the iphone 6 in webxprt , but the gap between it and the iphone 6s is still enormous . 
  while apple has continued to advance their web performance , it has n't been with the immediate goal of beating the android competition , as the best android devices are still just trading blows with the iphone 6 . 
   `` while it might seem reasonable to attribute the superior web performance of ios devices to apple 's focus on improving single threaded cpu performance , the fact that android devices with cortex a72 cpus are only matching apple 's a8 soc shows that the gap is not only due to the cpu power available . 
  chrome 's generally poor performance on android is a significant limiting factor , and you can see in the chart how the improvement in android device cpu performance over time has not translated into anything close to the sorts of gains that apple has seen in the same period . 
   while there are customized versions of chromium like snapdragon browser that provide optimizations for a class of socs , it does n't look like the gap between android devices running chrome and ios devices running mobile safari is going to close any time soon , and if anything , it 's only widening with each year .

  how old are you ? 
  you can be tech savvy and prefer to buy the iphone . 
  thanks for replying honestly . 
  that explains your rather childish comments - far from an objective assessment of the smartphone market . 
  i do n't mean this in a condescending way , but usually only fanboys lacking knowledge write comments like yours, 
  try to open your mind and get off your ( only imaginary ) `` high '' horse called android - inform yourself on actual important specs and how they integrate with software etc. 
  hooooly crap !, 
  that 's beyond absurd !,

  easy : every 20-30 seconds ( or whatever ) one of them gets killed . 
  he respawns on his squad mates shortly after with full ammo . 
  rinse and repeat . 
  fuck , i miss the old and fast bf4 menu :(, 
  that 's a plane . 
  turn off the paranoia setting in your girlfriend . 
  out yes , but afaik no one has received his order yet . 
  or did i miss something ? 
  i thought this was about verifying which wifi chip exactly is being used in the ( 15 '' ) touch bar models ? 
  exactly . 
  i 'm a real estate consultant and ( foremost ) developer and use my macbook pro for work - it 's perfect . 
  it 's basically a good idea to wait 1 or 2 weeks after new apple products have been announced until most of the craziness settled down . 
  the latter . 
  it will be available for order within december . 
  you do n't have to use it, 
  i 'm honestly looking forward to use it, 
  you can customize it with much more useful shortcuts, 
  i like most of the functions , ca n't wait to try it out . 
  but what i 'm honestly looking forward to is what apps like bettertouchtool will be coming up with . 
   even though the hardware in the note 7 is superior ( i think ), 
  it is n't , the soc in the iphone 7 smokes the competition . 
  ooh , you 're right !, 
  just checked my recent live photos and they 're buttery smooth . 
  nice !, 
  oh god , i ca n't bear these puns anymore !, 
  uhm . . yeah it is . 
  i suppose you 're trolling , but : no you ca n't . 
  make bread bread again !, 
  your reply gave me smallpox . 
  first of all : thanks for your post , very interesting . 
  do you have any chance to test civ 6 ( windows or macos ) performance ? 
  thanks in advance , 
  thanks a lot . 
  i think that the performance on bootcamp will be much better - the macos ports have never been good performers . 
  but 30 fps on medium would be enough for me , 
  looking forward to an update , thanks !, 
  i 'll bootcamp the shit out of this game . 
  this better be the reversed gif !!, 
  edit : yes !, 
  if you do n't mind me asking : could you be a little bit more specific with `` financial services '' ? 
  i 'd understand if you do n't want to , do n't want to be too `` nosy '' ... it just piqued my interest and you do n't have to be too specific , 
  god ** damnit !, 
  ** i knew it !, 
  magnificent !, 
  wrong !, 
  what is this , 2009 ? 
  you know you can use different accounts for the appstore and for icloud , yes ? 
  login once with your appstore credentials on the other phone, 
  activate touchid for appstore purchases, 
  apps update without password,
