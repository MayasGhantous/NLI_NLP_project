  yeah ... 
  height / 2 = comfortable, 
  i could n't even !, 
  amazing , thank you !, 
  could we * maybe * get the photo in slightly higher resolution , i 'd love to set it as my phone wallpaper . 
  i 'd understand though if you do n't want to . 
  thanks again !, 
  oops , you 're right . 
  i took a second glance at the photo in my library and the resolution is more than sufficient for my phone . 
  thanks , 
   ca n't build a fence or wall on a river , and ca n't build on private properties along the river . 
  not with that attitude !, 
  would love a reply-reply  great idea , will spread it, 
  i guess that the upcoming iphone 8 will be easily able to process this ( even iphone 7 theoretically , considering its raw processing power ) . 
  ( edit : i 'm sorry , coming from r/all / my front page i did n't notice this was r/android . 
  now my comment looks a bit provocative , which was n't my intention at all . 
  `` so this was a stupid political meme . 
  now for something different ... 
  this here is a guy who broke both his arms , mom . '', 
  `` white '', 
  the pig, 
  since the iphone 6s ( probably due to the ram and/or a combination of updates in ios ) i 'm more than happy with using swiftkey . 
  it almost never glitches ( once or twice per month ) and works like a charm . 
  try :, 
  - a few splashes of fresh lime juice, 
  - salt, 
  - cayenne pepper, 
  mmmhhhh !, 
   christ , half the globe is being taken over by far right sociopaths and all anyone talks about is how conway is kneeling on the couch ** or that trump eats well done steak with ketchup . 
  the fuck is he doing ????!!!, 
  that 's where i 'm drawing the line now . 
  tree decides to hit bed now . 
  i honestly do n't have words for this ... 
  why ... ? 
  ** fuck and truck **, 
  wrong . 
  look here :, 
  check the source before rolling your eyes . 
  techradar was just referencing displaymate.com :, 
  `` the iphone 7 excels due to its record absolute color accuracy ( 1.1 jncd ) , which is visually indistinguishable from perfect , and is very likely considerably better than any mobile display , monitor , tv or uhd tv that you have . 
  so photos , videos , and online content and merchandise will appear correct and beautiful . 
  see color accuracy figures and the colors and intensities section for quantitative details . '', 
  `` the absolute color accuracy of the iphone 7 is truly impressive as shown in these figures . 
  it has an absolute color accuracy of 1.1 jncd for the srgb / red .709 color gamut that is used for most current consumer content , and 1.0 jncd for the wider dci-p3 color gamut that is used for 4k uhd tvs and digital cinema . 
  it is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured . 
  it is visually indistinguishable from perfect , and is very likely considerably better than any mobile display , monitor , tv or uhd tv that you have . '', 
  `` an outstanding smartphone display, 
  the display on the iphone 7 is a truly impressive top performing display and a major upgrade and enhancement to the display on the iphone 6 . 
  it is by far the best performing mobile lcd display that we have ever tested , and it breaks many display performance records . '', 
  oled screens do have their advantages and are the future - but calling the iphone 7 display bad is just laughable . 
  `` ezpz ! '', 
  i prefer ugly women living on social welfare . 
  so hot !, 
  and ? 
  good . 
  ** and ? 
  define `` compromised '' . 
  i would n't even doubt that obama talked to/met with him . 
  that is hilarious and adorable !, 
  off with his head !!!, 
  yep , 
  crazy shit is happening ... never ever ever ** ever ** expected prison break to return . 
  fuck ... one of the worst things i 've read in a while . 
  that 's the sound shiva made when she jumped that savior . 
   it is also a convenient way to limit viable candidates to just the political class . 
  releasing a tax return by a business person provides instant opposition material . 
  that was made clear in 2012 with romney . 
  so ... considering that he 's acting president now : where 's the harm in releasing his tax returns ? 
  `` where 's the upside ? '' ?? 
  seriously ?? 
  i mean , i get it . . of course from his point of view there 's no real upside . 
  the thing is : it 's not about him ( or at least it should n't be ) . 
  it should be about transparency . 
  that would be the upside : transparency . 
  wow . 
  that comment is one of the best descriptions of grief after losing a family member or close friend . 
  thank you very much for linking it , i saved it . 
  piggybacking on this netherlands post :, 
  go to utrecht !, 
  it 's like `` little amsterdam '' , less touristy but charming as hell . 
  best and worst thread on reddit in years . 
  what the fuck guys ? 
  wrong . 
  that 'd be googol . 
  nice haircut . 
  why ** not ** ? 
  every conversation with my daughter . 
   and the pixel in general is much smoother than the iphone , at least from my experience . 
  it 's much more capable at handling multi tasking and having multiple apps open, 
  sorry , but ** no ** . 
  the pixel is a great phone and the camera is actually much better than the iphone 7 's camera , but in no way is the pixel `` smoother '' or better at multi-tasking . 
  the iphone 7 ( plus ) ** smokes ** the pixel .

  ( not saying that these are perfectly representative of everyday use , but it makes a clear point ), 
  and votes trump . 
  that 's strange . 
  i can definitely send up to 30 photos in whatsapp on ios .
