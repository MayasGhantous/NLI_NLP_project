  i was rather annoyed by the 10 photos limit , they raised it to 30 a few months ago . 
  edit : sorry , just read the other comment thread , you 're obviously aware of the different limits between apple 's share sheet ( 10 ) and whatsapp 's photo picker ( 30 ) . 
  ooooh damn it !!, 
  i managed to completely forget this - now it 's back in my head . 
  greetings from austria !!!, 
  or maybe ... ( you know , since his girlfriend seems to be genuinely happy with him ) he should keep doing what he does and stay the way he is . 
  crazy idea , i know . 
  `` playing '', 
  and austria , 
  in slow-motion and 4k . 
  spoiler : no one will . 
  thank you for your work and effort . 
  paramedics are saints . 
  i 've been cheated on ( more than 10 years ago , it 's far far away ) and i fucking adore this song . 
  the song 's melancholic , sort-of-depressing but still weirdly uplifting theme has a very special appeal imo . 
   then there are awkward things like not being able to attach files directly in the mail app . 
  you have to go to the file you want to attach , open it in whatever app opens it , and then share it , and then write your email . 
  that 's not correct at all :, 
  when drafting an email you can add attachments via a simple `` click '' ( long press and select `` add attachment '' in the context menu ; german os settings here ), 
  first you 're presented with your icloud ( app-specific ) folders but you can easily switch to other sources like dropbox, 
  they added it in ios 9 , which came out in 2015 . 
  alienblue on ios and several others . 
  that is fucking amazing . 
  i have so many apps that i use maybe once or twice a year buy that i 'd still miss if i removed them completely . 
  excellent feature , apple !, 
  could you record this with the new `` screen record '' feature in control center ? 
  or wo n't the audio be recorded ? 
  ok , thanks for clarifying , 
  of course not, 
  lol vienna is my home town, 
  that was my thought exactly , since re-compressing or converting one lossy format to another is never a good idea . 
  but i 'm wondering then why my iphone appears to upload my whole library again . 
  you 're most probably right , yeah . 
  this has got to be the most heart breaking and saddest thing i 've ever seen on the internet . 
  having lost my father when i was 14 and now having a 2 year old daughter that i love so much more than anything else in the world ... this photo was one of the rare things that made me actually cry for minutes now . 
  may he rest in peace and may his family find happiness somehow . 
  i 'll hug my daughter now . 
  iphone 7 plus, 
  i only have an iphone 7 non-plus , but that does n't sound normal at all . 
  could you upload 2-3 example photos ? 
  did you contact apple support ? 
  fuck ** no ** !!!, 
  yeees !, 
  my first thought when i saw this photo , 
  i agree . 
  it 's not very nice to look at but it 's functionality trumps everything ( once you got accustomed to it , by muscle memory ) . 
  i would love if you could rearrange the toggles and maybe chose between 2 sizes so that you could always show the expanded homekit widget ( for example ) . 
  that pretty dramatic and bad ass . 
  would be a good movie scene . 
  i get sort of an erotic vibe from this video ... 
  you guys ... 
  spot on !, 
  me too, 
  magic, 
  yep !, 
  apple emoji = best emoji !, 
  found the lifeguard !, 
  father of an almost 2y old daughter here :, 
  i 've heard and read this so many many times and while i absolutely cherished the weeks and months with that little newborn baby girl i can say that i absolutely do n't * miss * the time . 
  being able to talk to your little girl and actually get responses that make sense and interact with this cute little wonder of life is ( imo ) even better than holding a little newborn . 
  but your mileage may vary , and to be honest : every single phase with these cute little bastards is wonderful ( trying not to think of the puberty phase to come , trying not to think ... ), 
  i can do that with my iphone easily and do it about 50 times a day . 
  works perfectly . 
  abort !, 
  abort !, 
  you 're a loser and you know it . 
  same on ps4 - up to 15 minutes afaik . 
  you 're a loser in life and you know it . 
  you 're a pathetic loser . 
  woah , that 's nice, 
  that 's how long . 
  ** always ** amazes me !, 
  in 12 hours i could drive from my apartment to monaco and drive through following countries and pass by several cities :, 
  - italy, 
  - venice, 
  - verona ,, 
  - finally monaco, 
  many thanks !, 
  highly interesting , what a beautiful project . 
  hahahahaha . 
  fuck him , dumb fuck . 
  ooooh , look at him !, 
  he 's * quite wealthy * !, 
  but there are thousands and millions of first and second generation migrants that live a peaceful life just like you and me . 
  look , i 'm not even denying that there is an obvious problem within the second generation migrant `` community '' ( for the lack of a more appropriate word ; sorry , still without coffee this morning ) ... but to say `` do n't let any migrants in and you wo n't have a problem '' is utterly wrong or at least ridiculously over-simplifying the whole situation . 
  still : a click on the menu bar is far more convenient and faster . 
  did . 
  my thoughts exactly - perfect description of the different developments of ios and android . 
  because when i want to save / share a link i 'd rather prefer the direct link to the original website . 
  afair google even changed the behavior of the floating bar with the link : in the beginning you could click the link/bar like a standard html link and it would take you to the original source . 
  now you have to click the little chain-symbol and then either open the source or copy the link by long-pressing . 
  i know it 's just one more click but it 's annoying enough in everyday use . 
  nevertheless : i do like the readily available and fast loading articles , no doubt . 
  excellent overview / summary . 
  definitely the most snappiest safari i 've ever seen !, 
   - the quality of arcore 's tracking is noticeably better than arkit 's . 
  is it ? 
  honest question . 
  ( not that his comment added anything useful to the thread , but of course he did n't mean it seriously ), 
  and that here is the most stupid thing i read on reddit today .
