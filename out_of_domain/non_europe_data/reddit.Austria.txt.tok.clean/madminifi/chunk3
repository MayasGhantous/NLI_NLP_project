  get your shit together , man . 
   i do n't like elfsborg but i 'll happy watch them crush that team . 
  well , that did n't work out so well . 
   sorry for your loss . 
  thanks , todd . 
  holy ** shit ** !, 
  this strategy actually works ? 
  oh the horror !, 
  op pls breathe, 
  i 'm calling it now : we wo n't see walter/heisenberg `` mowing down his enemies '' with the m60 . 
  i think something 's going to happen so that we do n't even see the m60 in action . 
  i think until now we 've seen too many `` obvious '' shots of the m60 in the trunk - red herring maybe ? 
  i 'm not expecting a `` big bang-bang-bang-shooutout-scene '' at all for the next episode . 
  woops , missed your comment . 
  i 'm expecting exactly this : no m60 in action . 
  see my comment above : http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/1mxnfi/elliot_and_gretchen/ccdp0lg, 
  exactly !, 
  i 'm expecting that we wo n't see the m60 in action ** at all ** . 
  including this episode we 've seen the `` m60 in the trunk '' shot for the ... 3rd/4th time ? 
  that 's just too much `` obvious '' foreshadowing for brba imo . 
  ** did somebody call me ? 
  whoops , my fault . 
  i absolutely meant the promo for the finale . 
  evil wife !!!!, 
   its really kind of adorably pathetic . 
  yes it is ... ooh , yes it is , mr. network engineer for 10 years . 
  is this a scene from the mission impossible 5 script ? 
  no , i just drove over it ( by accident ) . 
  lucky me . 
   we need a damn zombies dlc for sure, 
  and a ** clown outfit ** !, 
  ** bicycle . 
  it should ( ! ), 
  be possible to restore the text messages ( and several other things ) with this tool here :, 
  http://www.icopybot.com/itunes-backup-manager.htm ( but ** always ** make sure you have a backup on your computer - ** and ** a backup of this backup that you wo n't touch when trying this method ), 
  i did n't try it myself yet but will give it a shot on the weekend . 
  i want to `` get rid '' of years and years of backups and old garbage ( i always updated starting from ios 1 ; not once did i set up my phone as new , it 's amazing ) but do n't want to lose texts as well . 
  photos : you should of course be able to save them by syncing to iphoto ( and/or photostream ), 
  contacts : should be synced via icloud ? 
  fyi : i 'm regularly tasting my girlfriend 's ass and have to say that brushing your teeth after consuming something acidic tastes ** much much ** worse . 
  source : me . 
  ** haters gon na hate , we rock !!, 
  ( no , you do n't , you fucking idiots, 
   / u/william _ johnson, 
  bwahaha ... what the fuck ? 
  thanks for pointing this out !, 
  many of the comments sound like a villain 's line from the team america script or something :, 
   that why america infrastructure so poor compare to china . 
  cable is bad , material because americans bad manufacturing . 
   truth is what i have said truth is in usa . 
  wtf . 
  '' ** vroom vroom !, 
  yep . 
  it looks shitty imo . 
  a few of my favorite apps :, 
  ** reeder 2 ** - rss reader with support for several services, 
  ** wunderlist ** - great todo/notes taking app ( incl . 
  collaboration feature ), 
  ** documents ** ( by readdle ) - absolutely amazing `` file managing '' and document viewing app ( pdf and many more filetypes ) with annotation features and an amazing sync feature ( dropbox etc. ), 
  ** geniusscan ** - to quickly scan documents, 
  ** camera + ** - with ios 7 i do n't use it as much as on ios 6 but it still is a very nice app, 
  ** downcast ** - podcast app , i do n't like the interface ( too clunky and windows95-y for my taste ) but the app has an amazing set of features ; i might take a closer look at the new instacast 4 app as an alternative ; ** edit : ** the interface of downcast got an overhaul with its recent update for ios 7 ... looks much better now . 
  i completely forgot this , sorry , 
  ^ might ^ edit ^ this ^ post ^ as ^ soon ^ as ^ i ^ can ^ think ^ of ^ a ^ few ^ more ^ apps, 
  while this is correct i would prefer the ios 6 behavior as well . 
  but i will get used to it anyway , so there 's that . 
  oh you !, 
  hmm , i do n't know ... while the google drive app improved recently i still strongly prefer documents . 
  the first two reasons i can think of :, 
  - pdf annotations ; with the google drive app you ca n't annotate pdf documents ( or i missed this feature ? ), 
  - i 'm still strongly attached to dropbox instead of google drive ; `` documents '' supports : dropbox , google drive , webdav , ftp , sftp , sugarsyn , box , skydrive , cloudme , ... 
  so documents is ** much ** more versatile and better for me . 
  so edgy !, 
  oh god , i read that too . 
  here it is :, 
  http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/1n7cpj/ive_been_looking_for_my_phone_for_the_past_2/ccgv5x2 & following, 
  i stumbled upon this thread through / r/bestof ( like you probably ) . 
  i do n't believe you . 
  ca n't wait to get a new car next year . 
  yeaaah , bitch !, 
  yeaaah , bitch !, 
  photos like this give me some form of ... relieve after that bittersweet finale . 
  i know it sounds so weird - it 's just a tv show after all . 
  but seeing them together , ** smiling ** , is just so ... sigh ... good to see . 
  you can find a short overview here :, 
  you 're goddamn right . 
  haha , cute !, 
  `` do you like pi\u00f1a colada and getting caught in the rain ? '', 
  trevor did more or less the same . 
  same here . 
  haha , oooh yeah , welcome to the club . 
  i was one ugly , weird , shy idiot ( pale , skinny fat , wearing ugly clothes in terrible colors & that did n't fit ) that almost everyone ( especially the girls ) made fun of in high school etc. 
  and today ? 
  well , thanks to lots of sports , an amazing girlfriend and developing a rather good sense for style ( not in an over-the-top-mfa-way though ) i have the dumbest imaginary smile at the yearly reunions when the girls ca n't help but hit on me . 
  i still feel sorry for my younger me though now and then ( sorry , man !!, 
  it 's getting much much better ), 
  well ... `` smoothly '' is relative . 
  i was able to play gta :o for 2-3 hours yesterday ( xbox 360 ) after i waited for ~ 30 minutes on the `` launching session '' screen for the first job/race . 
  finished the tutorial and played 5-6 teamdeathmatches and 3-4 races , bought weapons , clothes , reached rank 10 with my character . 
  went back online today : everything gone .
