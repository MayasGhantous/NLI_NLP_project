  and that fucker lamar awaits me at the airport . 
  again . 
  no it 's not . 
  and now stop trolling . 
   what i 'm saying is - iphones/ipads are n't good for actual work . 
  windows obviously is . 
  this is why businesses like them , and why huge corporations like delta have made massive deals and contracts with microsoft to get surface tablets for all staff members . 
  uhm , you do know that there might have been other reasons for the surface deal ? 
  i 'd take this with a huge grain of salt , but nonetheless :, 
   `` we fought hard for ipad , '' a pilot working for the airline told appleinsider . 
  he described the delta deal as being about money , travel contracts , and delta 's information technology staff historically being `` in bed '' with microsoft . 
  ( http://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/01/delta-employees-fought-hard-for-the-ipad-as-microsoft-announces-surface-2-deal/ ), 
  yeah yeah , i know , ** macrumors ** !, 
  of course they 'd write something in favor of apple . 
  but fact is that lots of other airlines are very happy with their ipads if you read a few reports etc. 
   a couple of guys ran me over . 
  i respawned close to them , they ran me over again . 
  respawned close to them , they came in for a third time but crashed into a solid post . 
  as they scrambled to get out of their car i executed them both . 
  beautiful . 
   another guy stole my sweet ride . 
  i was n't bloody having it and i 'd just unlocked the uzi so i stole a family saloon chased him down relentlessly . 
  blew out the tires , shot out the windows , riddled the car with bullets . 
  i chased him from one side of the city to the other ; finally he crashed and abandoned the car in a blind panic . 
  i left my car and followed him on foot through back yards and alleyways until i caught up with him for the execution shot . 
  he quit there and then . 
  i drove my ruined car back to ls customs and was happy to pay for the repairs . 
  oooh yes , sweet sweet revenge . 
   had a few similar situations today , smiled like an idiot , haha !, 
  afair he says he will text locations from time to time . 
  i found one by accident : i was driving around with another crew member in a stolen car and we wanted to get rid of the `` hot '' car ( so that we wo n't get 1 instant star as soon as the police sees the car ) . 
  saw a nice parked car , stole it and suddenly it said `` this is a car that simeon is looking for '' ( or something like that ) . 
  took it to the docks , got 6700 $ . 
  nice !, 
  someone could n't wait to finally connect to gta online . 
  if you open the quick-menu ( select on xbox 360 ; do n't know about ps3 ) you can `` highlight '' players for a short period on the mini-map . 
  their white dot flashes and you will be able to hunt him down . 
  and sometimes they do n't even leave the crime scene immediately and/or you spawn in close vicinity . 
   i fucking love windows phone , it 's the best phone os by a huge margin . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i 'd be honestly interested in the arguments . 
  i usually never post a `` haha , i laughed so much at this '' ... but in this case i just have to . 
  chuckled for a straight minute while my gf was watching tv next to me ( `` what the fuck is so funny ? 
   '' ) and almost could n't stop . 
  haha , damnit , ca n't get the picture of coyotes with bluetooth headsets out of my head . 
  you ca n't be serious . 
  just no . 
  stupid comment above me . 
  are you talking about handjobs under the table ? 
  is that a thing now ? 
  2nd or 3rd thread i 'm seeing this . . 
  for now i 'm ok with it , just fyi !, 
  it 's still funny . 
  wow , you 're a master with words . 
  so eloquent and edgy !, 
  fucking idiots - portrait video , what the fuck ?!, 
  oh yeah , and the microwave thing is stupid as well . 
  my theory is that rockstar wants to prevent a situation where a player stays in passive mode and runs over other players again and again without any danger of getting killed ( except exploding car ) . 
  what an asshole !, 
  of course i did n't mean this too seriously . 
  plus : i think he did n't kill him with the burnout ( ? ) . 
  nevertheless : it sounds fun , i was just making a joke . 
  he would die . 
  `` indirect '' explosions etc. 
  kill you even in passive mode afaik . 
  not anymore ( after the patch ) . 
  just no . 
  / r/technology, 
  did you honestly expect something else ? 
  hooooly sheeeeeet !, 
  not sure if joking or ... badger . 
  question : i 'm thinking about doing this as soon as mavericks will be available . 
  how exactly am i supposed to restore settings and user accounts ? 
  no question about apps themselves , but do i have track down their corresponding . plist files ? 
  that sounds like a pain in the ass . 
  why ? 
  ah , you 're probably right . 
  vice versa is every bit as important imo : as someone who works from home a few days a week i think it 's one of the most important things to immediately take a shower , dress up decently and then get to work . 
  i can remember times when i did n't shower first thing in the morning and sat down in front of the computer with just some boxers/pyjama shorts and a scruffy t-shirt . 
  it sucked !, 
  yep , can only recommend this app as well . 
  have been using it the last 18 months or so and it 's ** really ** great . 
  plus : a few days ago it received an `` ios 7 style '' - update . 
  i wholeheartedly agree with you . 
  while the animations themselves are pretty nice and okay for me their duration should be cut in half imo . 
  if i 'm not mistaken there was a ** tiny ** improvement with the 7.0.2 update though : the animations take the same time but you can actually tap on icons even when the animation is n't finished yet and ios will register this tap . 
  the action itself ( like opening the app you tapped on ) will be started only when the animation is finished but it speeds things up a tiny little bit - not perfect ( like in ios 6 ) imo but a small improvement . 
  i envy you - and your dads . 
  my father never saw retirement , he died too early ( 56 ) . 
  he had already made some plans for when his retirement would finally come ... he wanted to move with us into a bigger house with a huge garden . 
  he wanted to explore photography and filming a little more since he had almost no time since being a doctor and working from 8 am - 9 pm . 
  please enjoy your time with your fathers - and i wish your dads the best time of their lives during their retirement . 
  they deserve it !, 
  thanks , man . 
  he had a heart attack late in the evening when he came back to his doctor 's office from a meeting . 
  his office was one floor below our family 's apartment and we found him a few minutes ( ? ), 
  later . 
  we tried to revive him but when the paramedics arrived and tried the same for what seemed like and ** eternity ** and finally gave up we new it was over . 
  that was 15 years ago and it still hurts like hell sometimes . 
  meeeh ... sorry for bringing such bad feelings into this otherwise positive thread .
