  just had to get it off my chest . 
  just the nip !, 
  god damnit !, 
  $ 850 million ... !!, 
  what the f *** am i doing with my life ?!, 
  you mean y !!, 
  it was n't meant ** too ** seriously , i 'm so sorry . 
   what did i miss ? 
  selling cars . 
  steal a car, 
  2 . go to los santos customs/mod shop, 
  3 . sell the car, 
  may i kindly ask where your ( amazing ) journey took you today ? 
  what are you doing for a living and do you like it ? 
  hehehe , that sounds hilarious . 
  in an annoying way . 
  sad but true . 
   then , when you walk in , you are greeted with [ this . 
  ] ( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3201/2407921490_d6fea3c917.jpg ), 
  woah !, 
  yes, 
  are you drunk ? 
  this looks awesome !, 
   the android app circa does the same thing for news , it 's pretty neat . 
  btw : it 's available for ios as well . 
  no worries . 
   i just mentioned it because i downloaded it just yesterday . 
  it 's about ** sending a message ** . 
  yep . 
  this morning i made around 60.000 gta$ within 30 minutes . 
  like it !, 
  ( luckily i joined a lobby with drivers that actually drive fair races and do n't ram you all the time ... though there was ** one ** who tried it once or twice when we were heading for the finish line and were head to head ; still made it , haha !, 
  it 's online !!, 
  it 's online !!, 
  oh my fucking god !!!!!, 
  this is better than the ipad mini retina , the mac pro , the ipad air and mavericks ** combined ** . 
  yes !!!!, 
  wtf ? 
  how about :, 
  - taking it back to the club in case the actual owner goes back there to find the phone ? 
  ( addendum/alternative : to make sure the owner or barkeeper does n't keep it : just tell them you found a phone and where to contact you in case the owner comes back ), 
  - contact the carrier ( s ) and let them find out who the phone belongs to, 
  - maybe contact apple with the serial # . 
  maybe the phone is registered and/or eligible for an apple care protection plan, 
  but yeah , keep it and make some lousy excuses why that 's fine . 
  can someone verify this ? 
  i 'm having troubles updating my iwork '09 apps and tried almost everything . 
  i 'm even thinking about buying the apps again just to be able to download the updates , argh . 
  i ca n't try it right now since i 'm not in front of my macbook but maybe something like this would be possible with bettertouchtool ? 
  it 's free and you can customize a shitload of gestures , shortcuts and commands ( i close tabs with a 4-finger tap on the trackpad ) . 
  you two should start a club or something !, 
  hehe , i might actually do that next time , 
  i think they would get slaughtered within the first 3 minutes . 
  oh please let this be true :d, 
  yet the submission title about google 's banner ads gets marked `` misleading '' . 
  hehe , oh / r/technology , 
  i 'm pretty sure he could , 
  yet the submission title about google 's banner ads gets marked `` misleading '' . 
  hehe , oh / r/technology , 
  i think it 's more like : people on ps3 have hacked/modded the game and are transferring shitloads of money . 
  on xbox live they do n't afaik . 
  holy shit , to be honest i 've never heard anything about this game - but i ** wanted ** something exactly like it for years . 
  this sounds awesome . 
  do you know if the recent patches made it `` playable '' enough ? 
  the reports and reviews i found criticized it for being too buggy etc. 
  yes , for now . 
  i love that look . 
  80s vibe ftw !, 
  it 's so fucking delicious !, 
  the worst kind of shoes . 
  yes , it looks fucked up . 
  to be honest the lower one does n't look to healthy as well ( looks like a crack/fissure in the middle of the pins ) . 
  what the fuck did they do to these adapters ? 
   i 'm using mine everyday at home and when on the road and it looks almost pristine . 
  bro , do you even apple ? 
  holy shit , that looks awesome !, 
  i 'm downloading air display 2 right now and will try it ( 10.9 and ios7 ) . 
  there 's a workaround build available ( [ source from / r/enhancement thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/enhancement/comments/1pqyip/eli5_how_do_i_get_red_to_work_on_safari_7/cd5335o ) ) :, 
  --  https://mega.co.nz/#!wdzu3jdd!ep0tdraogokp8xo0a04bnyjmdelolxtoa7wvzfnqki4, 
  you should keep your original res-extension and just deactivate it in safari because as far as i understand it , in the not too distant future it will receive an update and this workaround build can then be deleted . 
  100 % agree !, 
  call lester . 
  it 's available from level 40 upwards i think ( someone correct me if wrong ) . 
  the way walter/bryan cranston delivered these lines was just * perfect * . 
  you gim me that source and you gim me that now !!!!, 
  i think you meant to reply to denigrare , but thx . 
  i do the exact opposite and always play in public lobbies . 
  sometimes it can and will get annoying and once in a while some asshat will kill me out of nowhere and/or destroy a vehicle i just picked up . 
  but to be honest i enjoy even these moments - especially when i spend the next 20 minutes to hunt them down again and again . 
   i like it . 
  but your suggestion is very good and should be standard procedure for everyone who does get annoyed by all the assholes out there . 
  exactly !!, 
  i 've made this point before ( though i absolutely understand if someone disagrees and prefers to spent a certain time in private session ) :, 
  i ** never ** launch a solo private session and always play in freeroam . 
  if someone decides to fuck with me . . well , then i have to deal with it . 
  and most of the time it ends in a lot of fun ( and * sometimes * i get a little bit angry and wo n't stop for 30-60 minutes until i finally get my sweet revenge ) . 
  i love it and i 'm not even angry at `` griefers '' or players who go crazy and shoot on sight . 
  haha , amazing tip , thanks . 
  tried this today and it worked . 
  player in a tank was killing other players all the time and running in circles around his apartment block .
