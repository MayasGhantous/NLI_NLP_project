  i took a chopper , flew to the roof of the neighbor building and called a mugger . 
  through my sniper scope i followed and observed him . 
  after ~ half a minute i saw the mugger approaching the tank and pulling the player out . 
  sent him `` mwahaha '' as a ( somewhat childish , i admit ) message through the in-game phone , parachuted from the building and took the tank . 
  fun . 
  goddamnit , i 'm so ** fucking ** stupid . 
  every single time i wanted one of my personal vehicles delivered i actually called my mechanic via ^ the ^ ^ in-game ^ ^ ^ phone !, 
  oh god !, 
  til . 
   he 'd be pretty fucked . 
  i always have an emergency credit card stashed ** somewhere ** when i travel . 
   you did okay toaday . 
  oh god , this guy is annoying . 
  for me it 's the exact opposite : i 've bought the 64gb lte model in april and to be honest 99 % of the time i have more than 32gb free on the ipad mini and have used lte only three or four times . 
  i still feel a little bit stupid for going for the `` biggest '' model ( but to be honest it was the only one that was available and shipped within 2 days , so there 's that ) . 
  i think i will sell it soon and the get the 16gb ( or 32 because of retina-ready apps etc. ), 
  wifi-only model instead . 
  thanks , had a good laugh , 
  you ** nailed ** it !, 
  once you have perfected this routine it works in 9 out of 10 situations . 
  what the * fuck * ? 
  who would bring a can of sardines on a plane ? 
  except you of course . 
  monster !, 
  goddamnit , i have to stop reading this thread !, 
  i 'm sitting in class right now and have to cover up my spontaneous chuckles by pretending to cough for the last 20 minutes . 
  i think it 's not believable anymore . 
  these comments are all comedy gold . 
  gold , i tell you !, 
  i visualized your small story and ca n't stop grinning and chuckling like an idiot . 
  teacher gives me the weird-angry look already . 
  what the ** fuck ** ???!, 
  this is so wrong on so many levels . 
  i wish her only the best - and the worst for those responsible . 
  i love res but i still prefer using alienblue ( even on the iphone ) . . even when i 'm at home and have laptop at hand . 
  same for me about 2-3 weeks ago : my iphone 5 behaved similar and died all the time when it actually showed me 20-25 % remaining battery . 
  i opened a support case on the apple website , selected `` battery & energy '' and within 30 seconds i received an email with a link to start a diagnostic run . 
  20 seconds later it shows `` your iphone reports problems with the energy supply '' ( or something like that ... it was in german ) . 
  called the apple support and the next morning my new iphone 5 was waiting at the door . 
  circlejerk ? 
  yes . 
  joke ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  yes , same for me !, 
  it was my first car and i still drive it almost 50 % of the time ( now almost fully modded though ) . 
  haha , lol !, 
  i agree ... 
  i absolutely agree 100 % . 
  ** but ** ... 
  i still ca n't get rid of this thought : i was * seriously * planning to invest about 15.000 eur in bitcoins back in june/july 2012 . 
  and did n't . 
  yes of course , hindsight is 20/20 , no doubt about that and i ** most ** probably would have cashed out at $ 30/40/50 ( or even much much earlier ) ... but still ... 
  this damn thought burns through my brain and i hate it . 
  but i still know that i did n't do anything `` wrong '' per se . 
   a finely tuned entity xf ( ** stick with one transmission level lower than the max ** , only lower the suspension about half ), 
  may i ask why ? 
   made your car fly to the moon, 
  amazing conversation , guys !, 
  okay , thanks for the detailed explanation . 
  i had my own assumptions especially regarding the `` too low '' - suspension . 
  i 'll try the different suspensions the next time i get online . 
  two goals . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  my gf is still using a ... what ... more than 3 year old iphone 4 and is happy . 
  what ? 
  i 'm so sorry . 
  i misread your comment ( during my morning commute ... to my defense ) . 
  iphone 5c ! = iphone 5s, 
  hehe , i see !, 
  and i chuckled , 
  i still think that the 5c is rather ridiculous ... 1 year old iphone 5 ( though it 's still very good even today imo ) in a plastic shell . 
  only at apple ... !, 
  i just did n't know if you mixed up the two models . 
  carry on , 
  it 's not about the money . 
  it 's a matter of principle . 
  i ca n't even count the situations where i 've hunted a bounty for 20/30/40 minutes and probably spent a few thousands on sticky bombs , grenades launcher ammo etc. 
  just to finally get the red dot . 
  you might call it `` idiotic '' , i call it fun . 
  let 's agree to disagree ... 
  i had a fully upgraded futo and got rid of it after a few hours ( damnit , lots of money burned ) because i hated the handling . 
  to each his own  enjoy your futo !, 
  holy shit ... so if this is legit and reproducible this could be a way to kill the cowards who hide in their apartment while having a bounty on their head , right ( if they let you in ) ? 
  do n't get me wrong , i ** know ** that i wo n't get the bounty but it would be a fun way to annoy them . 
  yup , had the same thought after submitting my comment . 
  i think their spawn location depends on their settings ( `` apartment '' oder `` last location '' ) ... but i 'm not even sure if they spawn ** outside ** if it 's set to `` last location '' ( since their last location was their apartment ) . 
  i might test it later today . 
  anyway , this brought me to an idea : i think you should be able to send an intruder/housebreaker/burglar to someone sitting in his apartment ( similar to the mugger sent via lamar ) . 
  maybe for a fee of 8.000-10 .000 and the player in the apartment could/should be alarmed by an alarm system ( maybe as an optional upgrade ? ), 
  ** and ** be able to defend himself . 
  i know many will strongly dislike this idea because sometimes you have a legitimate reason to stay in the apartment ( getting drinks , preparing food , masturbate , on the phone , ... ) but i think it would be a fun way to lure some hiding players out of their apartment . 
  wow , you 're so superior !, 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  i just enjoy putting bullets into other players heads , especially when they are red dots on the map . 
  i 'll tell you what : you keep on trying to build your imaginary `` empire '' ( ... ? ), 
  while i 'm out there having fun , okay ? 
  sorry , wrong sub thread , 
  why did n't you get an awd model for the winter ? 
  audi s3/rs3 or vw golf r ? 
  i would n't want to drive awd all winter , especially when stepping down from an awd rs5 ... ?
