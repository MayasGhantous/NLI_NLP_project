  fyi , stylish is available for safari as well :, 
   thanks for not being aggressive in your response . 
  i agree . 
  especially after your passive-aggressive question ... 
   what i loved most about the first season of twd was the bit in the cdc , when you got a sense of the scale of the outbreak . 
  i want that grand scale of dystopia back , this microcosm inside the prison is just dull !, 
  yes !!, 
  my thoughts exactly !, 
  the show and the premise would have so much potential ... but all we get is a fucking soap opera with a few zombies sprinkled on top now and then . 
  i actually think it * does *, 
  i actually do n't care about your nit-picking, 
  whatever , pal . 
  i 'm not a native speaker and posted my comment after a great bottle of wine , so i can only kindly ask you to fuck off . 
  was using his what ???!!, 
   now for some reason , i wrote hitler . 
  this was probably 8 year old me thinking i 'm funny . 
  i mean , clearly he 's not my favourite person . 
  ** to be fair , i thought he was a bit of a cunt . 
  come on , man !, 
  you 're a bit harsh on him now ... !, 
  i scrolled down to the end after the first 3 paragraphs because i expected * exactly * that . 
  than i scrolled back up and read the rest , 
  are you, 
  [ ] 14 years old ? 
  [ ] drunk ? 
  [ ] both ? 
  who cares ? 
  a/s/l ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding, 
   the mandarin was actually not an actor , but was using his mind control, 
  when i submitted my reply your post ended with * `` the mandarin was actually not an actor , but was using his m. . . '' *, 
  it was my attempt on a cheap joke . 
  what leads you to this assumption ? 
  that 's a matter of opinion and definitely not a fact . 
  even if you make this presumption : where are the facts and figures that confirm that `` people got sick of paying for it '' ? 
  they most probably did n't . 
  deal with it . 
   1 : apple is overpriced . 
  `` overpriced '' is subjective . 
   compared to their competition , they offer less raw power for more money . 
  not true . 
  `` for more money '' ? 
  yes . 
  `` less raw power '' ? 
  ** ipad air : **, 
   `` i wo n't go through all of the results here again , but ** it 's safe to say that the ipad air is the fastest arm based tablet on the planet at this point ** . '', 
   '' apple 's own 64-bit cyclone cores are incredibly powerful , even more so than i originally expected when i reviewed the iphone 5s . 
  ** apple seems to have built a bigger , higher performance cpu architecture than any other arm player , including arm itself ** . 
  the design is n't perfect , but ** it 's a completely different caliber performer than anything else it competes against ** . 
  as such , apple was completely justified in putting the a7 in both the iphone 5s and the ipad air . '', 
  ** iphone 5s : **, 
   `` the a7 soc is seriously impressive . 
  apple calls it a desktop-class soc , but i 'd rather refer to it as something capable of competing with the best intel has to offer in this market . 
  in many cases the a7 's dual cores were competitive with intel 's recently announced bay trail soc . 
  web browsing is ultimately where i noticed the a7 's performance the most . 
  as long as i was on a good internet connection , web pages just appeared after resolving dns . 
  the a7 's gpu performance is also insanely good - more than enough for anything you could possibly throw at the iphone 5s today , and fast enough to help keep this device feeling quick for a while . '', 
   `` an update on apple 's a7 : it 's better than i thought '', 
   `` that 's the other aspect of what makes a7 so very interesting . 
  this is the first apple soc that 's able to deliver good amounts of memory bandwidth to all consumers . 
  a single cpu core can use up 8gb/s of bandwidth . 
  i 'm still vetting other socs , ** but so far i have n't come across anyone in the arm camp that can compete with what apple has built here . 
  only intel is competitive . 
  ** ipad mini : **, 
   `` compared to the first generation ipad mini , the new model is in a completely different performance league . 
  keep in mind the first mini used apple 's a5 soc based on an arm cortex a9 . 
  that 's the same single threaded performance as what 's in an iphone 4s , and under ios 7 it 's clearly running into some performance limits . 
  ** the new mini with retina display however is a completely different animal . 
  it 's fast . 
  even comparing to the 4th generation ipad , the new mini is noticeably quicker . 
  so ... please stop claiming your `` facts '' , you 're just wrong ( again : price is a different topic , i 'm talking about performance ) . 
   2 : this part actually is opinion . 
  i did n't do a fucking research study to see why the ipad mini was in third place , i was expressing an opinion . 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  your `` opinion '' does n't even make sense in this context . 
  this thread is about the result of displaymate 's display shoot-out . 
  how on earth do you come to the conclusion or even opinion that `` people got sick of paying for ... '' ? 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  if you were to quote any ( declining ) sales numbers than your statement might be worth a discussion . 
   you get mad at me for not claiming `` facts '', 
  i do n't get `` mad '' at you , i 'm just criticizing you for it . 
   and then cite a bunch of articles filled with opinions . 
  the quoted `` opinions '' are actually based on hard and substantiated facts/data ( benchmarks and in-depth-analyses by a renowned source ) . 
  do n't skew the facts please , kthx . 
   my point was that apple products are good , yes , but they often cost much more then what comparable products from the competition would . 
  take the macbook for example , they start at $ 1999 ( at least for the 15 inch variant , which is closest to most other laptops i was comparing it to ) . 
  they are some damn good laptops , but not for $ 2k . 
  this sounds much more reasonable than your first statements . . and to a certain extent i do n't even completely disagree with this . 
  but even this is n't the definition of `` overpriced '' . 
  comparable laptops are not ** that ** much cheaper than macbooks . 
  the macbook airs for example were one of the best-priced ( price/performance/build quaility-wise ) `` ultrabooks '' for a long time . 
  anyway , i did n't mean to discuss this year-old topic . 
  but your first comments here were just , well , wrong . 
  have a nice weekend . 
  maybe , but i was sitting in a seminary and had a few hours to kill anyway , 
  and brooklyn nine-nine !, 
  are you fucking sorry ??!,
