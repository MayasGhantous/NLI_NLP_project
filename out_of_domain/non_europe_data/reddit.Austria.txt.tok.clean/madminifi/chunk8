  haunting and unimaginable ... :(, 
   [ you might want to watch this before talking out your ass ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve_wqdkbtvy&amp;t=5m39s ) that is n't some layman driving , and he is still wobbly as fuck even after driving that same course all morning . 
  it 's fast as hell , but when people who have driven countless supercars say ** that it handles like shit , i 'm inclined to believe them . 
  difficult to control when driving at the limit ! = it handles like shit . 
  no , that would be www.meetingtodieyou.com, 
  wtf , this is some rain man-level shit , man !!, 
  well done . 
  wow ... . 
  i know that almost everybody absolutely ** loves ** fantastical , but i still strongly prefer [ week calendar ] ( https://itunes.apple.com/app/id381059732?mt=8&amp;partnerid=1 ) . 
  for me nothing comes close to the perfect week overview of this app . 
  i still have fantastical 2 installed on my iphone and i fire it up once a week to maybe get used to it ( and hyped like 99 % of the internet ) but for some reason it 's just not for me . 
  you shut your mouth !!!!!, 
  `` he knocked his head on the table . 
  clumsy idiot . '', 
  settings, 
  look , your anecdotes are interesting ( they really are ) but it does n't change the fact that the majority of the iphone users are happy with ios 7 and its new features etc. 
  yes , it has its shortcomings and issues/bugs that have to be ironed out sooner than later and usually i would expect more and better quality control from apple ... but it 's still an amazingly good os ( okay , maybe not for you ) - your rants wo n't change that . 
  one of the most pathetic `` strategies '' in this android/ios-fanboy-war - bullshit is to try and depict the `` other '' os as sooo inferior and shitty . 
  face it : both android and ios are amazing ( with minor and major shortcomings for certain target groups ) . 
  there are many more reasons . 
  - samsung paid users to write fake reviews in favor if samsung phones and/or negative reviews for competitors products ( http://mobile.theverge.com/2013/10/24/5023658/samsung-fined-340000-for-posting-negative-htc-reviews & amp ; http://hexus.net/mobile/news/android/54165-samsung-hired-students-negatively-review-htc-taiwan/ ), 
  - samsung invites bloggers under false pretences : http://appdigy.com/174/samsung-is-evil/, 
  - samsung repeatedly tried ( and probably still tries ) to game benchmark scores, 
  - the recent region lock bullshit, 
  - the family behind samsung and samsung itself have been involved in lots of corruption and anti-competitive scandals in the last decades ( e.g. 
  http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/micwright/100007374/apple-may-be-ruthless-but-samsung-is-a-ferocious-fiefdom-that-plays-by-its-own-rules/ ), 
  - etc. 
  samsung is n't the white knight in shining armor fighting the dark knight apple as many many users wanted to paint them in the last months and last 2-3 years . 
  in fact ( or at least imo and if you dig a little deeper ) they are worse ( not talking about their products ) . 
  see my reply above for a few examples . 
  i disagree . 
  i 'm ** not ** saying she 's ugly but tbh for me she 's far from being truly attractive ( but yes , long hair = better than sort hair ) . 
   she has a really fat face that i find unappealing . 
  the rest of her body is alright enough , but her face is that of a person twice her weight . 
  i think you 're a little bit exaggerating here . 
  7/10 max !, 
  ah okay , sorry . 
  here you go :, 
  hehe , okay , i get what you mean . 
  but i still think that `` really fat face '' is a bit hyperbolical . 
  but yeah , she 's got a rather big head , i can agree on that , 
  a pathetic, 
  just no . 
   edit2 : holy shit , what is happening now ? 
  woah !, 
  crazy !, 
   definitely did n't expect that today . 
  you misspelled ` greed ', 
   well i 'm well off in real life so i spent a bunch of real money on cash cards and now i have a billion `` legit '' gta $, 
  i do n't believe you , pal . 
  2 out of 5 my cables ( original apple cables ) failed in the last 12 months . 
  but since i 've got apple care they replace them without charging me for the cables . 
  at least something ... , 
  what . 
  the . 
  best us president ever !, 
  not everyone uses snapchat ( e.g. 
  valid question . 
  this is the funniest thing i read all year on reddit !!!!!!!!!!, 
   apple only paid for what she provided receipts for an nothing else, 
  what else did you expect them to pay ? 
   fuck apple, 
  ps : sorry for your mom , hope she 's better . 
  may i ask how she broke her foot in the apple store ? 
   if it was the `` wrong ring '' because the diamond was too small , then yea ... bullet dodged . 
  if it was the wrong ring because it was something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7h0t7vm.jpg ) ... maybe not . 
  wtf is that ?? 
  the goatse ring ? 
  waaaaaahhhh !!!!!!, 
  the negative face in the bottom left . 
  fuck , that 's horrifying !!, 
  then he 'd still have a few alternatives :, 
  - actually ** bookmark ** the thread, 
  - use a reddit client like alienblue ( ios ) or alternatives for android ( there are several good ones ) ; from within these clients you can either save/favorite the thread send yourself the link to the thread or even single comments via mail etc. 
  just a suggestion , 
  we 're not in the ebay feedback section here . 
  no :( do you ? 
   @apfeltalk those slides are from 2008 , a time when the iphone : 1 . 
  did n't use any encryption and 2 . 
  ran everything as root . 
  still better than 90 % of all other phones available on the market . 
  a dripping vagina ( from being aroused ) does ** not ** always mean `` gunky slime '' ... in my experience most of the times it 's just ** wet ** . 
  ot : what i noticed in all of his photos : he should ** definitely ** work on his posture , that does n't look healthy at all . 
  please note that this has nothing to do with his clothing , not commenting on that . 
  and ? 
  wow !!, 
  bravo !, 
  in the name of all men around the world i would like to congratulate you : you achieved what no one of us will ever achieve . 
  i stand here today in awe and admiration and would like to thank you for sharing this . 
  everybody should . 
  i actually did !, 
  `` changed '' it from purple + white to midnight blue + white . 
  yay me !, 
  that !, 
  this cop 's name ? 
  chief wiggum . 
  the beckmans ( on the far right ) are the 9016 , correct ? 
  honest suggestion : i think this would look 10x better if you ** did n't ** cuff your pants . 
  but of course that 's a matter of taste . 
  i 'm afraid i do n't have the css , sorry !,
