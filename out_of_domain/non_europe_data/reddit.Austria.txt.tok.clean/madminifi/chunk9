  hehehehe, 
  it 's so nice to see them together . 
  after reading your post and all your edits : this should be you right now !, 
  what the fucking fuck ?!, 
  i absolutely did n't know this and , honestly , i did n't believe you until i googled it . 
  holy crap !, 
  :d i love marky mark !, 
  daaaamn !, 
  now that 's an applaudable physique !, 
  yeah , must be the courts , sure . . 
  in my 15-20 years on the internet i 've pretty much desensitized myself to almost everything including gore etc. 
  but i ** know ** that i 'm not going to click that link . 
  it would most probably be much for me to listen to : /, 
   so for ten minutes i reason with him , assuring him that i 'm very observant , i 've done his before , and the risk is very low . 
  i wheedle , i cajole , and though he 's not happy about it he eventually agrees - on the conditions that a ) i only go out for forty minutes , and b ) i take his machete with me . 
  good story , but - sorry - you 're a fucking idiot and seem like an annoying person . 
  he will be free and independent in 2047 !, 
  i would agree insofar that most probably 90 % of the `` reported squirtings '' are actually just piss ( nothing bad about this , hehe ) . . but there are some studies that actually more or less proved that there is something like `` squirting '' . 
  though it * wo n't * look anything at all like in all those porn videos :, 
  ** splash !, 
  ** ** splash !, 
  ** ** splaaaaassh !, 
   edit : i wonder if , with an icloud.com address , there 's a way to add or automatically have forwarded emails sent to your icloud username , but with the mac.com domain ... 
  it may just be as easy as sending yourself a test email with yourusername@mac.com!, 
  i just tried this :, 
  while i 'm still able to receive mails under the me.com domain ( and of course icloud.com ) i only get an error when trying my username + mac.com domain ( since i never owned a mac.com account ) :, 
   550 5.1.1 unknown or illegal alias : *xyz*@mac.com, 
   who thinks they drive great ? 
  uhm . . almost everyone who has ever driven one ? 
  i 'd rate it a 5/10 . 
  i thought it was quite ok !, 
   i guess my point was that even a giant company 's fortunes can change very quickly . 
  just look at apple . 
  they went from market leader to almost bankrupt to the most valuable company in the world . 
  ** and now they 're on the decline again . 
  ** and that all happened in a little over 30 years . 
  i agree with you and all of your posts in this subthread so far - but please define `` decline '' in this context . 
  i think that 's a massively exaggerated statement ( if not plain wrong ) . 
  decline in stock price since brainless wall street investors do n't go bananas over their shares anymore ? 
  yes indeed . 
  decline as in `` apple as a company is in decline '' ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  do you agree ? 
  i do . 
  i 'm pretty sure you 're wrong . 
  brb, 
  i 've been in 3 car crashes ( i did n't drive in either of them ) and i can tell you that there was n't much more `` going on '' than in this video here . 
  you railed it !, 
  nothing too extraordinary :, 
  * 1 part gin, 
  * 1 part vermouth ( e.g. 
  * 1 part campari, 
  * ice + orange slice, 
  * hendricks gin ( its taste fits the aroma of the cucumber perfectly ), 
  * tonic, 
  * a pinch of ground pepper, 
  * slice of cucumber, 
  * ice, 
  sure . 
  ios had this since 2010 . 
  sure . 
  ios had this since 2010 . 
  edit : and the great thing is that with the new `` activation lock '' introduced with ios 7 there 's absolutely no way to get the ios decide running again ( until you enter your id & password ) if you locked it . 
  so even if a thief completely wipes and restores your iphone he wo n't be able to use it . 
  while this alone wo n't get you your device back you will at least know that this idiot wo n't be able to enjoy his `` new '' iphone - ha !,

  haha , sorry , but i think the chances are non existent  but you can try !, 
  someone call ari already !, 
  in case the built-in possibilities are not ideal for you , you could try this app here ( $ 2.99 ) :,

  never forget ... :(, 
  same with the iphone :, 
  * bring up siri, 
  * '' ( set ) timer for 3 minutes '', 
  * done, 
  thanks , obama, 
  glasses for short-sighted people . 
  just close your eyes a little bit more . 
  you know , sometimes i watch this video on purpose . 
  i just like the song :d, 
  * you 're, 
  a/s/l ? 
  yeah , seriously , give her some credit . 
  * crickets *, 
  * the fanny pack is a lie . 
  i honestly do n't think that this is one of europe 's priorities or `` reasons '' . 
  economical and political reasons are much more probable . 
  * `` weeeeeee !!, 
  sorry to tell you , but he most probably had a heart attack and died . 
  rip your mate . 
  sounds like my regular day in gta v. 
  i honestly did n't know you were n't a native speaker . 
  but do n't worry , the cases in german grammar drive almost everyone crazy when learning the language . 
  that being said , the correct way would be : `` die u5 ''  female , akkusativ . 
  but do n't worry , it 's not even remotely important , sorry for being such a smartass , 
  absolutely !!, 
  in the meantime ( or instead ) you could get him one of these here :,
