i have no idea why you got downvoted because you are absolutely correct . 
  those are `` markierungst\u00fccher '' or more old fashioned `` fliegersichtt\u00fccher '' .

  may i ask which beer brand ? 
  i assume either stiegl , g\u00f6sser or zipfer . 
  which is the reason vienna named a street after isidro fabela ( the guy who represented mexico at the league of nations ) and a square after mexico ( mexikoplatz ) . 
  ironically this square is infamous for illegal arms and drug trade today . 
  good to hear . 
  i have n't lived in vienna for almost ten years now and back then police still struggled to get a hold of the problem . 
  der spiegel published a picture of a fighter in women 's clothes during a ceasefire .

  as far as i can see it `` ultra-violent '' is just the visual that is added on this subreddits style to the `` nsfw '' tag and you can search those very easily through the reddit search system :, 
  just search for [ nsfw : yes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/combatfootage/search?q=nsfw%3ayes&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all ),

  `` charging mode '' ( keeping the batteries warm ) requires more energy than they currently get from the solar panels . 
  almost : we found the `` philae obelisk '' there . 
  together with the rosetta stone it helped us decipher the mysteries of ancient egyptian hieroglyphs as much as the two spacecraft help us unravel the mysteries of comets . 
  just look in the general direction of mars , rosetta is currently behind it . 
  rosetta did a low-altitude bypass of mars coming as close as 250 km . 
  she was not designed for that as she was originally to be launched at a different comet and trajectory . 
  this manoeuvre was nicknamed `` the billion euro gamble '' . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2007/02/stunning_image_of_rosetta_above_mars_taken_by_the_philae_lander_camera/9823828-3-eng-gb/stunning_image_of_rosetta_above_mars_taken_by_the_philae_lander_camera.jpg ) is a pic of the mars bypass . 
  it was meant to be launched a year earlier but an ariane crashed a month before the scheduled launch . 
  the launch window for the original target ( 46p/wirtanen ) closed and they had to quickly find another target . 
  67p was their best bet but it also required them to change their plans a bit . 
  [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tukkuhf.gif ) is a gif from the whole flight , it is quite complicated . 
  correct . 
  what type of bombs are those exactly ? 
  slightly off topic : i recently tried to find video footage of a [ mark 118 bomb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mark_118_bomb ) explosion but i could n't find a single verified one . 
  does anybody know where i could maybe find something like that ? 
  it would probably be vietnam of korea footage . 
  i can make out a `` mit der nato '' - `` with nato '' . 
  so it is probably some argument about past nato operations ( kosovo ? ), 
  or alleged nato support for maidan or whatever . 
  99 % sure that was die linke .

  your answers is pretty good but to add to that here are two examples of actual `` combat identifiers '' from videos that are currently on the / r/combatfootage frontpage :, 
  [ ( link to submission ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/combatfootage/comments/31m2fp/syria_if_fighting_daesh_in_yarmouq_camp_05042015/ ), 
  [ isis in yarmouk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pludbv3.jpg ) [ ( link to submission ) ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/combatfootage/comments/31jqyh/isis_footage_from_yarmouk_there_appears_to_be_a/ ), 
  these type of identifiers can be found often in areas where cqb is to be expected and different colours seem to indicate different units sometimes . 
  do n't feel stupid !, 
  they are really easy to miss if you do n't actively look for them . 
  kreislaufprobleme in german is a very broad category of different conditions . 
  the english equivalent is `` diseases of the circulatory system '' but that is not nearly as commonly used . 
  randomly stumbled across this one and thought it was extremely interesting considering the time it was shot and the whole contrast of values and societies . 
  definitely thought provoking stuff !, 
  not just early models . 
  i was surprised that they also sent them newer ones but i guess that is to be expected as germany is going to replace the milan system as a whole soon . 
  but in the end it does n't really matter considering the targets they are being used for . 
  if you find that odd you should check out the salary situation in libya . 
  [ here is another shot from the same exercise with a couple bvp-2 in the background . 
  prvi partizan ( a serbian ammo manufacturer ) produces a wide variety of obscure calibres . 
  i 'd say it 's a proton . 
  the second stage has multiple engines like a proton , the soyuz has only one . 
  wen ? 
  as the author of this post i would like to explain where the idea came from : the [ screenshot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iarnx36.png ) / u/dclauzel posted is 1665 pixels wide , so he uses a decently sized monitor . 
  the distance between the average title and its flair is rather large and it looks pretty good . 
  i , on the other hand , looked at this subreddit on my laptop that 's only [ 1280 pixels wide ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bcvlo0y.png ) . 
  things suddenly look much more crowded and the flairs look almost intrusive , especially with longer titles . 
  just my two cents . 
  that 's a great idea , that space is otherwise unused and it fits in really well . 
   economist films : meet the people pioneering new careers as drone pilots , from the south african savannah to the building sites of california .
