i 'm 21/m and living in austria . 
  and well i like movies , traveling , photography and from time to time to be mega lazy and not doing anything . 
  if you would like to write about random stuff or exchange photos ( honestly i 'm not very good at it , but i like doing it and want to get better this year ) . 
  mario party . 
  they are playing at home , so it will be at least 4-0 . 
  yeah after his bad start into this season , he finally seems to play on his level again . 
  the worst linesman performance i 've ever seen . 
  one mistake ? 
  bayern got 2 offside goals . 
  but yeah i do n't think the red was bought . 
  he is just shit . 
  na , more like somewhere between 2008/09, 
  yeah i thought it was pretty romantic back then haha xd . 
  no idea . 
  i know , right ? 
  mine too . 
  once i cut my hair it was over haha . 
  basically if i would n't have cut my hair my face would look pretty much the same as with 16 haha . 
  is n't it something people say ? 
  i get it . 
  i had a super douchey look . 
  but maybe next year . 
  somehow i have to fit in in austria , otherwise they may find out that i 'm slavic . 
  what a great song haha . 
  no , i 'm from austria . 
  yeah , but i ca n't grow a nice full beard . 
  damn genetics . 
  pff , everyone knows that captain tsubasa was japans first football superstar . 
  [ my favorite dbz ] ( http://i.imgur.com/or7woou.png ) moment can finally become reality . 
  kapustka is looking great so far . 
  1 goal + 1 assist in his second gamefor the national team is impressive . . 
  i wish my dad had as cool friends as cafu , ronaldinho , figo so i could play with them too . 
  beckham is back . 
  the twists wo n't stop . 
  i think they are gon na solve this problem with that frog guy . 
  he probably can speak with frogs and so ginyu will be able to transfer himself . 
  germany , random country , poland and ireland . 
  that seems like a fun group . 
  the kapustka hype ca n't be stopped . 
  [ horus the black flame dragon ] ( http://img.class.posot.com.br/pt_br/2015/06/21/horus-the-black-flame-dragon-lv8-een-ense1-secret-20150621112817.jpg ), 
  is clearly a god . 
  checkmate . 
  can this south americans negate magic cards ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  i 've stopped playing a long time ago too , but `` lvl-mechanic '' wa actually released around 11 years ago . 
  it worked different in each lvl-line . 
  for example the horus had a lvl 4 version . 
  with it you could summon a horus lvl6 from your deck/hand at the end of your turn if you destroyed a monster with it . 
  horus lvl6 could then summon horus lvl8 at the end of the turn if you destroyed a monster with it this turn . 
  their effects got stronger with each lvl . 
  and unlike horus lvl4 or horus lvl6 , horus lvl8 could be only summoner through the effect of horus lvl6 . 
  but yeah it was a pretty old mechanic that never really catched on . 
  horus was by far the best lvl line . 
  besides him mystic swordsman lvl2 was also quite popular , but only because of his type and effect . 
  but this info may be quite outdated , considering the fact that i havent played the game that much in the past 7years . 
  milik and linetty may be poland 's breakout stars . 
  maybe even kapustka as a sub player . 
  gotham is imo the best dc show this season . 
  it got so much better than the first season . 
  ekstraklasa is clearly the most competitive league . 
  ** you , me and the apocalypse **, 
  fantastic show that just ended its first season . 
  i would recommend to everyone to check it out . 
  such a fun show with so many great actors . 
  well it 's too late now to go back . 
  good . 
  i love that app on my xperia . 
  it 's so easier to just write on your smartphone instead using the controller . 
  ok good to know . 
  thx . 
  yep a team like wolfsburg would have no chance against a giant like manu, 
  that 's great . 
  i 've played it for the first time last weekend and had soo much fun . 
  poland :, 
  ---------- ** krychowiak ** -- linetty ------------, 
  ------------- ** milik ** -------------------------------, 
  players in bold are guaranted to start if they wo n't get any injuries . 
  he is the most talented and is probably the number 1 candidate for the starting spot , but fabianski is pretty solid too . 
  their form in june will decide . 
  yeah i 'm pretty confident that our team wo n't fail this time . 
  i hope too we wo n't face each other . 
  at least not in the group stage . 
  well city won their group , while you guys failed to do so in all this years . 
  you mean city , right ? 
  unlike you people watch the game for more than a year and besides that they would n't base the form of a team simply because of 1 game . 
  tell that to barca , bayern and real . 
  they are pretty consistant in getting to the semis each year for the last few years . 
  i hope there will be a season 2 . 
  so many questions left . 
  how is consumer protection outdated ? 
  and how does this fucks things up ? 
  it gives more rights to consumers and less to corporations . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  you have to consider that defenders ca n't foul as easily as during pele 's time due to the introduction to yellow cards and stricter rules . 
  during pele 's time the brazilian league was one of the strongest leagues in the world . 
  and besides that , he also got 3 embarrasing worldcups . 
  he is the captain after all . 
  i had once the chance to play a deck with an original crush card in it during a local tournament . 
  it was before any reprints of it . 
  the feeling of playing ccv was just unreal .
