  do you mean [ roger perejro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttnu2h8qbjo ), 
  technically it was his second goal for lech after he scored in the el qualification before . 
  but it was his first league goal and his first league game . 
  it was his birthday . 
  or maybe he did want to make cavani a present ? 
  why not ? 
   but i genuinely think he is pretty overrated and gets by off his glory days at dortmund where he had some fantastic players like lewadowski reus et, 
  he won the league without reus , and besides lewandowski all other players that he used to win the league failed hard at better clubs , so it 's not like he really had that good of a squad . 
  and besides that , he was the one to build up the dortmund team . 
  before he came they finished 13th , before that 9th ,7 th ,7 th ,6 th . 
  he took over a mediocre team and transformed it into one of the best teams in europe in 3 years . 
  not really . 
  it 's about the fact that eastern european members of the eu stil have to apply for a visa in the us . 
  it has been an issue long before trump took office . 
  and that 's the way it should be as long as the us does n't agree to let eastern european eu members without a visa in . 
  bush and obama could have changed it . 
  they did n't . 
  now it 's on trump to do something against it , but the same situation would have arrised even if hillary was elected . 
  i 'm not a trump supporter , on the contrary , but this has really nothing to do with him . 
  it 's just , that the eu decided , that they will act now . 
  so was hitler in 1939, 
  a little bit austrian hiphop :, 
  raf camora is currently the most famous austrian rapper and together with the german bonez mc they 've released the biggest german hits last year .

  [ bonez mc & raf camora - an ihnen vorbei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qw9rosff1m ), 
  but imo raf 's first album is stil one of the gems of austrian rap . 
  nazar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxiee92co3g ), 
  then there is yung hurn . 
  currently austria 's best artist imo .

  austria 's own soulja boy fake , but unlike to originial he really made it in the austrian music scene . 
  [ money boy - dreh den swag auf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emuuhrqsoti ), 
  and for the end , the greatest austrian musician since mozart . 
  his music combined pop , rock and hiphop . 
  his [ falco - rock me amadeus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvikz8oe_xa ) is the only german song that made no. 1 on the billboard charts . 
  [ falco - junge roemer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu8lskaqm_0 ), 
  [ falco - der kommissar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w4xulsjo5i ) that song made even no. 1 in countries like japan , spain or australia . 
  it never got that much fame in the us , altough afrika bambaataa loved to play that song . 
  [ falco - maschine brennt ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3iy20c ), 
  [ falco - vienna calling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zav8uhhclmw ),
