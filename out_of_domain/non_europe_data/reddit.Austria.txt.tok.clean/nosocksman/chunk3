  why should he care about africa , solely because he is black ? 
  white americans do n't care about europe either . 
  and the fact that mercury died long before this century , so he ca n't be considered as the greatest artist of the 21st century anyway . 
  he does n't score against poland in the semi finals of the worldcup .  poland wins the semis  poland becomes worldchampion . 
   poland hype  poland becomes a top nation  poland beats communism  poland can into space . 
   poland is the greatest country on the planet . 
  what if super sons will be a superboy & ( red ) robin teamup book . 
  at least i hope so . 
  he has a great season at empoli and is a sure starter for them . 
  i 'm quite sure that it will be either him or linetty who starts besides krychowiak this summer . 
  yeah its doomsday , thats why killing him off is no problem . 
  his power is coming back from the dead and being immune to the way he was killed . 
  i disagree . 
  he is exactly a character for that . 
  he has no interessting backstory or character that can be explored , he is just a monster that punches really hard . 
  he was created simply as a plot device to kill superman and wasnt used in any other way than to punch superman really hard . 
  why not go even more crazy and introduce arm-fall-off-boy as a main character . 
  could that black costume be actually nightwing ? 
  i mean it kinda looks that way . 
  let 's not kid ourselves , the would n't be the starplayer in the league as long as steffen hofmann stil plays . 
  dude , where did you get that shirt.its so great . 
   that english players are ignored all the time . 
  like who for example ? 
  if anything it 's the post 2011 klassiker ,, 
  you can have a gun with 16 years ? 
  wtf . 
  some people bet that suarez will bite someone during the worldcup and won . 
  everything is possible . 
  it 's like the lottery . 
  especially when talking about empires, 
  no chance for him to get a starting spot over hofmann, 
  batman v superman : dawn of jutice is stil about the dawn of the justice league , so the title was n't made redundant at all . 
  please do n't talk about austrian culture if you have no idea about it . 
  we do n't have problems with second gen immigrants . 
  i guarantee you a lot of those austrians were second gen immigrants trying to fit in with people who look just like them in a place full of people who otherwise do n't . 
  that 's not really a problem at all here . 
  we have mostly public schools and there are no ghettos , so there is no seperation between young turkish , polish , austrian , etc. 
  children in austria . 
  for what ? 
  i do n't need origin stories for every single hero in the universe . 
  just let allready exist and tell good stories with em . 
  an older batman and a bigger batfamily gives so much potential to tell good stories that have n't been done before . 
  no that 's isco, 
  i am hyped . 
  i have high hopes that i wo n't be disappointed this time as a polish fan . 
  we have a genuine worldclass player who is arguably the best striker in this tournament and the teams plays really good together . 
  i hope we advance from our group and do n't lose against the germans nor in a possible match against austria . 
  i 'm sure this or similar will also be avaible in europe like for the hobbit movies , the new star wars , monster university and probably many other movies that i have may missed . 
  so what movie besdies bvs is there to talk about ? 
  have they announced any new r-rated ( superhero ) movies since deadpool ? 
  szczesny 's dreams are coming true . 
  thats why all nike jerseys are made from 12 plastic bottle per jersey anf both psg and city wear nike, 
  actually they will use the new kit for the very first time . 
  maybe salamon can do it ? 
  definitely a better option than szukala, 
  poland did it first, 
  no , that stripe is gone . 
  here are some [ pics ] ( http://www.rmf24.pl/zdjecie,iid,2035775,iaid,194161 ) of the new kit . 
  to be fair arnautovic was always considered a big talent , even bigger than alaba , but he is bascially balotelli characterwise and that ruined his whole potential . 
  winner ? 
  ** poland **, 
  runner-up ? 
  best player ? 
  dark horse ? 
  ** poland **, 
  top scorer ? 
  breakout star/young player ? 
  super delusional , but who cares . 
  ultra light pm pls, 
  it 's very unlikely that maczynski will play during the euros at all . 
  he is currently injured and wolski is tearing it up on his position . 
  and then there is zielinski who has a great season in italy . 
  yes rafal wolski . 
  since he came back to the polish league he played really really good and was constantly good in each match . 
  stil better than the formel e fan boost, 
  fuck the haters , in two hours im gon na see batman fight against superman and i couldnt be more excited . 
  im literally on a ultra light beam of hype right now . 
  i was hoping that supersons will focus more on tim and connor . 
  that cover alone makes it worth so much . 
  klose and podolski . 
  klose for becoming germany 's and also the worldcup 's all time top goalscorer and podolski for becoming germany 's 4th all time top goalscorer . 
  and they are germany 's second and third most caped players in history . 
  ca n't top that . 
  john paul ii was a cracovia supporter for his whole life . 
  they 've even retired the # 1 jersey in his name . 
  titans rebirth had the same warning . 
  the wally hypetrain is real . 
  ps4 - d4an1el _, 
  not exactly . 
  he came as a rm to hertha and became soon after a rb . 
  he played striker in his youth tho . 
  and here i am just enjoying my `` free '' education , becasue the country i live in sees as an investment for the future . 
  good question . 
  so is robben 's right leg, 
  not saying that he has the potential of suarez or lewandowski , but suarez was also inthe eredivisie at this age and lewandowski had just had his first season in dortmund . 
  but i guess we will see next year , because i doubt it that milik will stay at ajax past this summer . 
  gotham s2 is the best dc show by far . 
  do we really need another movie with doomsday in it ? 
  he is such a boring character and pretty onesided . 
  he can punch hard.that 's all there is and he did that in bvs , so there is no reason to use him again anymore .
