  you have to be a bit lucky and search for it when the company is doing a promotion of some sort . 
  two weeks ago was one of those days . 
  i wanted to book some bus tickets with flix bus and searched for discounts . 
  turns out that they partner with isic and i got 3 bucks off . 
  also a few weeks ago i got a food delivery discount . 
  edit : i live in europe btw, 
  lolz where is this from ? 
  i just had such a good laugh watching that part . 
  thanks !, 
  bigotopoulos : `` lol look at me , i 'm like super gay and i love trump hehe lel fuck everybody who does n't agree with my dumb opinions lololo '', 
  i hope i 'm not going to hell for laughing too hard at this, 
  this is so beautiful !, 
  i want to get into woodworking and build my own stuff but have no idea where to start :(, 
  i need more popcorn, 
  the fuck is a doodad ? 
  unbelievable . 
  fuck this asshole , seriously, 
  i love doing work at vollpension !, 
  lovely atmosphere , good filter coffee ( refill costs 1 $ instead of 2 $ ) and great cake , 
  this is something that i wanted to ask as well . 
  i want to start swimming ( as exercising ) , going 3-4 times per week . 
  i have been searching the web for a while but ca n't seem to find a public pool that suits me . 
  i 'm probably going to check out amalienbad tomorrow . 
  does anybody have any experience with that swimming pool ? 
  edit : a word, 
  this is the most responsive touch screen i have ever seen, 
  thanks for the info !, 
  do you maybe know how much is going on during weekdays in the opening hours ? 
  apparently there is a pretty advanced ai behind it which behaves just like a real being . 
  the only reason it 's not in production yet is because they have n't figured out why it 's fucking lazy most of the time . 
  the cringe is very strong . 
  as it has already been mentioned , you can see it in that poor woman 's eyes that she does n't want to have anything to do with this . 
  she should divorce him, 
  `` pussy ass bitch , fuck you '' gets me every time, 
  til about crowd science, 
  those are two completely different things, 
  excuse my ignorance , but what 's the context of this ? 
  alternative food, 
  turn off your anti-virus and try again !,

  what 's the origin of this meme ? 
  eh , i mean me too thanks, 
  can confirm < 3, 
  ** dragee keksi warning : ** the whole package might be consumed in a single session !, 
  i was expecting that :p, 
  should be ** will **, 
  the odds 6/1 means that it is 6 times more likely that he does n't get impeached than to get impeached . 
  so the odds describe the probability of him not getting impeached ( p ) , by the probability of him getting impeached ( 1-p ) . 
  o = p / ( 1-p ) =  6/1 = p / ( 1-p ) = , 
  6 ( 1-p ) = p =  6 - 6p = p =  6 = 7p =  p = 6/7, 
  so the probability of him not getting impeached is 6/7 ( and obviously for getting impeached is 1/7 ) . 
  hope it 's clear now , 
  edit : word, 
  hell yeah dude !, 
  i 'm going to pm you , 
  when everybody smells like shit , maybe you are the one who shat his pants, 
  fun fact : the ancient greeks believed that amethyst prevents one from becoming drunk , hence it 's name . 
  amethyst means `` not intoxicated '' . 
  they used to make drinking vessels decorated with it as well as wearing them in order not to get wasted . 
  unless you 're full of shit already, 
  i never noticed until now and i 'm freaking out,
