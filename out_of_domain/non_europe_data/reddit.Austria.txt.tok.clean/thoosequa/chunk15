  no need to learn the basics . 
  once you know the controls of the game and the basics of how it works simply join a group . 
  most groups tend to do things their own way anyway as such , there wo n't be standardised gameplay . 
  while i am sure almost everyone in this subreddit knows what a wedge is and how it looks in a fireteam , most groups will conduct it in a ever so slightly different way . 
  same goes for radio protocols , vehicle formations and convoy procedures etc etc. 
  ** tl ; dr ** join a group without being worried about not knowing enoug . 
  most groups will teach you everything you need to know anyway, 
  i ca n't say that for certain but i am at least 90 % sure that you can do that . 
  it 's also a pretty efficient way of clearing out amines on a road when you do n't have the necessary tools at hand, 
  it 's cool and everything but does this ** really ** surprise anyone ? 
  the pressure of the community was weighing down on them and everyone was expecting it . 
  i personally much rather see a list of additional content provided with the marksman dlc . 
   you would slowly crawl backwards while your crew calls out how far you are away from anything that you could collide with . 
  fair point , bear in mind though , that since the helicopter dlc all transport helos are provided with a downwards facing camera on top of that he is n't going terribly fast . 
  he approached , pulled the nose up , checks where he is with a quick look on the camera and his crew probably called out where he was . 
  all in all impressive maneuver but not impossible in 1st person , hence my question to / u/urinat0r which seemed like it was immediately downvoted . 
  not in the tweet so thanks for sharing !, 
  mods will never outperform code written in the game engine . 
  compare modded sling loading with vanilla sling loading . 
  because sling loading was 5 bucks as well , amirite ? 
  it 's true that the camera is in the middle ( and static if i remember correctly ) but if you watch the camera while slowly passing over a roof you can get a solid understanding of where your airframe is . 
  imagine the following : if your camera is just about to line up with the edge of the roof , you know that you still have a couple of feet to go before your ramp goes over the edge . 
   so i 'm guessing it 's either ai scripted ( not sure you can get that level of precision with ai ), 
  also very possible , there is a script which lets you record your flight path and play it during a mission . 
  i never said its a smart move , just that it 's possible, 
  all weapon restings mods i 've seen so far had somewhat issues with surface detection as well as moving the weapon while it 's rested . 
  for example with previous versions of vts weapon resting you could rest it on bushes . 
  i will never comprehend why people ask for technical help with their mode on this subreddit rather than the official thread on the bohemia forums . 
  not messed up . 
  the polish spell it pjotr, 
  have you contacted the developer on the relevant bohemia forums thread ? 
  have you launched arma 2 at least once before launching oa ? 
  when you deleted a2 and oa , have you made sure that ** everything ** is gone ? 
  including the files in \\ appdata \\ local, 
  make sure everything related to a2 is wiped off your hard drive before launching again , including the profiles, 
  great video , i never understood how people could bash arma 3 for it 's dlc release strategy or content . 
  out of the entire industry they are one of the few providing assets to everyone , not segregating their community into dlc owners and non dlc owners . 
  my favorite part about the helicopter dlc discussion was how it will separate the community and make missions unplayable and none of that has happened . 
  i do understand the criticism the game takes for it 's performance , with that being said however bi is doing a great job at increasing stability and performance . 
  we 've come a long way since the initial release of arma 3 and i am excited to see how far we can get . 
  greati video !, 
  maybe a bit lengthy but definitely a cool idea, 
  this is a rather specific question . 
  why do n't you try to get in touch with the owners of the server or their admins . 
  find out if they have a forum and ask your question there . 
  not sure what you are talking about ? 
   in singleplayer, 
  i get pretty decent fps when playing the campaign, 
   no ai or players present, 
  again , my fps goes through the roof in the editor with nothing but me on the map . 
  maybe you should start optimizing your settings . 
  the downvotes on this post just represent how trigger happy the community on this subreddit is . 
  awesome that you like the game !, 
   disabled 3rd person perspective , disabled crosshair etc, 
  is pretty much standard for the unit-community around here . 
  once you have your amount of people to kick things off you should drop a post at / r/findaunit good luck , 
  when you say * large scale british milsim unit * are you talking about the size of your roster ? 
  how many people do you have in your unit ? 
  what 's the average amount of players you get per operation ? 
  it 's not like he 's getting any karma for a self post , so he genuinely just wants to share that he is happy with the game , which is nice . 
  but you are right , it 's not really informational or worth discussing . 
  point taken, 
   the dlc model they adapted for arma 3 is just dividing the community further than it already is . 
  how so ? 
  in , say , battlefield or call of duty or as matter of fact ** any ** modern game you always have 2 groups of players . 
  those who bought the dlc and those who did n't . 
  and those 2 groups do n't intersect anywhere . 
  the only way these two groups can play together is when a dlc owner plays without the content he bought or the other group buys a dlc . 
  in arma however you are not forced to buy the dlc , yet you can stil play in your unit , group and / or favourite server , that maybe runs it . 
   to this future setting with purely high tech gadgets at, 
  arma 3 is not settled in a `` future setting '' nor is it purely high tech gadgets . 
  all vehicles in arma 3 exist in real life one way or the other . 
   the second lowest tier transport can completely wipe out entire squads, 
  which would that be ? 
  the only purely transport vehicles i can think of are the trucks and cars ( which have not weapon mounted on top ) and the helicopters , but in arma 2 most helicopters had miniguns and .50 cals as well , which are pretty good at wiping out squads . 
   one of the major factions does not have access to an air superiority fighter yet [ sic ], 
  this one is my favorite : one of the major factions . 
  what ? 
  the fia ? 
  they are supposed to be a guerilla unit with limited assets . 
  they are a local guerilla unit , where the fuck would they get a jet from ? 
  canonically with the storyline they are supported by nato , since they belong to the same side and all that . 
  all of your opinions are based on practically nothing . 
  i literally never heard of anyone saying `` uh this game has too many mods , im not gon na buy it '' . 
  as a matter of fact the sheer amount of mods is the sole reason why most people buy arma 3 . 
  adding on top of that : practice , practice , practice . 
  find yourself a partner , put him into the artillery piece ( or cas jet for more fun ) and start attack targets around you . 
  as a pro-tier practice : start calling targets relatively close to you without actually injuring yourself . 
  do this with mortars though , rather than artillery or mlrs . 
  the latter tend to have a rather large blast radius . 
  you can try to stick as close as you can to the optimization guide from [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/2telde/i_made_a_guide_to_getting_the_best_fps_in_dayz/cnygk64 ) with that being said arma 3 is known to run better on intel processors . 
  i own a fx8350 as well and while it 's a great cpu pretty good at handling a lot of things arma 3 is just the bane of it 's existence . 
  you might be able to rock a few more fps when overclocking to 4,5 - 5 ghz , but do n't do it if, 
  * you do n't know what you 're doing, 
  * you do n't intend to install a new cooling system . 
  the cpu might be cheaper than an equivalent intel cpu but that 's no reason to brick it . 
  edit : worth mentioning : play with your settings a bit . 
  auto-detect might be the prettiest but not always the best solution . 
   there is no real replacement to the humvee in a3 and the technicals are all but gone except that one fia truck . 
  either your squad rolls around on atvs , sit in a large truck,
