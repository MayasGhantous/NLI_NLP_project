  the hunter is the replacement for the humvee , it exists in real life as well , click [ here ] ( https://www.leidos.com/sites/default/files/u14/mrap1.jpg ) for reference . 
  the oshkosh m-atv ( as it 's called in real life ) is more mine and small arms resistant than the humvee . 
   or you have a transport that can do the job better than the units it is carrying most of the time . 
  see you 've got a major logical gap here . 
  all assets in arma 3 have their advantages and disadvantages , these are called game mechanic . 
  from the infantry foot soldier up to the attack helo . 
  to just give you a brief example on where your logic is flawed : you say the hunter is already an overpowered transport vehicle , with its 4 seats and .50 cal or grenade launcher . 
  i say the blufor tank ( in real life it 's called merkava iv ) has seats in the rear for 6 ( might be 4 ) foot soldiers and it can carry 3 crew personnel , thus it 's better than the hunter . 
  however , it is n't . 
  the hunter might have lesser firepower and armor than the tank , but it 's quieter and faster , thus creating a balance between the two . 
  this works with every unit in the game . 
  everything has advantages and disadvantages , nothing is crazily overpowered . 
  other than in a2 btw in which the opfor faction was praised with the shilka , an aa vehicle that would wreck ** everything ** that came in it 's way . 
   how can you completely ignore that nato does not have an asf ? 
  did you forget ? 
  do you think the a-100 is fit for dog fighting ? 
  nato does not have an aa jet , this is correct , but no one said that bohemia wo n't give us one later down the road . 
  remember that the first set of jets was released for free as well together with the campaign update . 
   i think most people would prefer not having to install a 5-20 gigabyte modpack and keep it up to date . 
  if you have twenty gigabytes of mods than it 's your own fault . 
  my old unit had a modpack that contained vehicles , weapons and agm and we kept it well below 1.5 gb . 
  if your modpack is that huge and you complain about updating it , you might want to throw a few mods out the window you do n't need . 
   vanilla a2 ( especially with arrowhead ) had so much more content, 
  yes but vanilla a2 had a lot of stuff ported over from a1 . 
  and arrowhead was a expansion pack , counting arrowhead as well would be unfair , because bohemia [ has yet to release the a3 expansion . 
  ] ( https://www.bistudio.com/assets/legacy/images/stories/arma3/roadmap_2015.png ), 
   for now arma 3 to me , is a blank canvas , that bohemia wants the community to paint . 
  how is it blank ? 
  arma 3 has a lot of content , possibly just as much content as vanilla a2 without the ports from a2 and without the arrowhead expansion . 
  it 's not like bohemia ** wants ** the community to paint on it 's canvas , but bohemia * gives us the option * to do so . 
  some might argue that the assets currently provided in a3 are redundant throughout the factions , but you know what ? 
  i say they are balanced . 
  each faction has one mbt , each mbt has different characteristics , same goes for the rifles , pistols and trucks throughout the list of assets . 
  if you think arma 3 left a hole in your heart where arma 2 was then go back , nothing forces you to stay with the game . 
  as a matter of fact there are still lot of groups that offer arma 2 as option . 
  but saying that bohemia did a bad job with arma 3 or `` delivered a blank canvas that the community is supposed to fill '' is just plain wrong and misguided . 
  edit : spelling, 
  you do n't need mods to learn how to use a map and 6-8 digit grid coords . 
   the problem with the hunter is that it is way too good as a transport, 
  how is it `` too good '' ? 
  an infantry fireteam can easily render it useless by taking out it 's tires . 
  it carries only so much ammo and it has a rather large turning radius compared to a civilian car . 
   infantry fades into irrelevance unless they bring heavy at, 
  and that was n't the case in a2 ? 
  and how is infantry fading into irrelevance . 
  we constantly see videos of phantactical or shacktactical where they constantly play as infantry . 
  a tank is a force multiplier , that is it 's nature . 
  if you want to defeat it bring something that can defeat a tank . 
  ** and ** if you are unhappy with tanks having thermal imaging then go to the mission maker in your group and tell him to disable it . 
  it is literally one line of script . 
  ( just as a side note : all a2 blufor tanks had thermal imaging as well , talk about a3 being unbalanced . 
  at least opfor also uses ti as well now ), 
   compared the a2 the modsets are significantly larger . 
  before my group switched to a3 our a2 modset was 8gb in size , with all the ace , ace_x , acex_ru etc. 
   with no low tier vehicles the infantry really has nothing to fight other than other infantry squads, 
  you mean like in real life ? 
  edit : as i said , an infantry squad is very much capable of rendering a truck useles , even with a gun mounted on it . 
  it 's all about how you do it . 
  blow the tires , aim for the driver , disable the optics on the cannon ( yes that 's possible ) . 
   big surprise that a tank with 4 machine guns will wreck anything in front of it , at least it did n't have thermals . 
  aa works the same way in a3 . 
  it is not like aa ca n't engage anything outside helicopters and airplanes . 
  not but my point being the shilka was crazily overpowered . 
  it armor was too strong so it would survive several hits from missiles before being destroyed and it had an insane rate of fire . 
  anyone saying the shilka is a balanced asset in a2 has clearly never played with or against it . 
   you can spot and zero in on targets over 1000 meters away with such ease, 
  if you 're the leader of an infantry squad and you get taken out by a hunter over a thousand meter range , then it is your own fault and poor route planning . 
  nuff said . 
   i have yet to see any real combined arms, 
  my old group used to play solely combined arms missions . 
  it works perfect . 
  if your entire squad gets wiped out because of a vehicle it 's in most cases due to poor execution of standard infantry tactics . 
   yes , just like in real life . 
  and that is why this time period is so poorly chosen , it severely limits the type of missions you can create with the vanilla assets . 
  stuff like patrol missions with ambush points are a thing of the past because the hunter will always spot and neutralize any infantry before they get a chance to trigger the ambush . 
  having clocked in about 700 hours in arma 3 let me tell you that my personal experience is that every type of mission we did in a2 works just as well here . 
  however if you feel like the hunter mrap is too overpowered with its mounted weapons , you could always switch to a version without any weapons , because these exist as well . 
  to be fair out of all criticism i 've heard about arma 3 , i 've never heard anyone complaining that the standard infantry transport vehicle ( that exists in flavors for all sides ) is too overpowered . 
  so congrats to you for being such a special snowflake . 
   first you use realism to defend the efficiency of the arma 3 vehicles , but when it comes to arma 2 , it is all about proper balance ? 
  no i am saying other it 's prequel arma 3 is a very balanced game , where each faction has it 's own characteristics with it 's own vehicles . 
  could it be more assets in the game ? 
  sure , i wo n't complain about more shit being delivered , but i am also saying that a3 is imho a pretty well balanced game in terms of assets . 
  and those who are unhappy with the assets were given the freedom to create their own . 
   the time period was poorly chosen . 
  and that is your opinion . 
  i think the time period is perfectly well chosen . 
  in the beginning of the big fps era we were given one world war two shooter after the other , up to the point where i would almost throw up when i saw a mp40 in a game . 
  later on , with call of duty starting we were given the cold war and post cold war era . 
  the `` bad guys '' used the ak and it 's variants the good guys used the m4/16 and it 's variants . 
  of course a2 delivered a few other rifles but you ca n't really argue that for example a m4 cco a m4 cco sd and a m4 ssco sd m203 are 3 different weapons . 
  i personally got really tired of the same assets being used over and over again . 
  i find the new vehicles refreshing and i enjoy them . 
  sure i use mods to hop into an abrams from time to time or fire a m4 again , but i think ( and i know i am not the only person with this opinion ) there is absolutely nothing wrong with the vanilla assets in the game . 
  and on this note i am going to end this discussion now . 
  you have good points but you can not defend yourself well enough imho . 
  if you feel like posting another reply please be my guest and i * will * read it , i wo n't take more time out of my day to respond though . 
  1 . and 2 . 
  i personally would not buy arma 3 because of it 's post apocalyptic mods . 
  if you are looking for epoch / overpoch gameplay with the engine of arma go buy dayz .
