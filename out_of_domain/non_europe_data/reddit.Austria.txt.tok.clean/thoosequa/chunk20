  you asked : what is a good programming language , and the correct answer to it is : depending on where you want to go with it . 
  of course some languages have disadvantages or advantages over others but that does define the overall quality of it . 
  hence why this thread is being downvoted, 
  adding on top of / u/artemisdimikaelo 's comment : the more players you have the more waiting time there 'll be in the mission . 
  briefings need to be done , gear needs to be sorted out etc etc , i remember in my old unit with more than 40-50 people we usually had to wait around an hour before we could kick off with things because every layer of our assets needed to be briefed and a plan hashed out . 
  inherently this rooted in more issues : if you have one squad , platoon or even company disconnecting things start to get unbalanced and one sided . 
  we used to run a few 24 hour ops but only against ai , and while they were successful the servers would usually tank after about 6-7 hours needing a restart , essentially halting the mission, 
  you do not know it very well , do you ? 
  saw that as well , the kind of attitude continues . 
  even with everything prepped , all assets require logistics and logisitics take time . 
  by the looks of it all their servers are offline . 
  that would be the best news i 've gotten this week !, 
  in all seriousness though , this subreddit is not dedicated to a3l , as a matter of fact , quite the opposite . 
  check out / r/altislife for alternatives or contact the owners directly via their website and forum, 
  so you are saying the entirety of the arma community has two options :, 
  * use alive, 
  * play wasteland / pvp, 
  is this what you are saying ? 
  put it on the feedback tracker , i 've never had issues with it, 
  you can have the contributors contact you via email if they want a share of the donations . 
  or you use the money donated to the project to invest in the project again . 
  ie buying licenses for frameworks / hiring a designer to create new logos etc etc. 
  with ue4 and unit 5 more or less completely free apart from a few royalties now is the perfect time to become an independent game dev . 
  pick an engine , read through the documentation work through tutorials and you are good to go . 
  though at one point or the other you will have to learn how to code , so if you 're avoiding a cs degree because you do n't want to study anything then becoming a game dev is not the right path for you, 
  ** i did not make this video ** , so go on youtube and make sure to give credit where credit is due . 
  it was posted on arma 3 's facebook page and thought it was worth sharing . 
  do you get the 27 fps in singleplayer ? 
  editor ? 
  multiplayer ? 
  if the latter on what server ? 
  what are your settings ? 
  as a short addendum to this problem ( since you solved it anyway ) , the java string api provides us with a few neat features exactly made to solve such problems, 
  if ( str.startswith ( `` hi '' ) ) return true ;, 
  i see the point where practicing working with substrings could be helpful , but just so you know for future reference, 
  marked nsfw to disable the thumbnail, 
  tfar offers a loudspeaker for all radios . 
  its a simple toggle button that , when pressed , makes your radio audible for everyone surrounding you . 
  it 's quite the useful feature if you 're the only one in your fireteam with a radio , or platoon is sending your squad a message and you do n't want to repeat everything, 
  taken from the video description, 
   although i ca n't give a tutorial here , i used a mixture of camera scripting and the ` splendid camera ' to achieve the angles and shots . 
  the slow motion shots were scripted to be slow , i did n't record in a super high frame rate . 
  not bad , not bad at all , did n't think of that, 
  because it was marked as surprise in the spotrep . 
  i did n't want to ruin the surprise for anyone . 
  whatever you see more fitting what you plan to work on . 
  if your primary goal is to work in unity then stick with c # . 
  alps . 
  and alp area . 
  as far as i know we never had high mountains , and low valleys next to them . 
  that 'd be a cool thing imho, 
  takistan was imho too empty . 
  no vegetation and the mountains were all in all not that high, 
  / u/noubernou this guy has his shit together when it comes to modding . 
  reasonable decision you made there , it is a great game . 
  your bottleneck will be your cpu , but if you 're not too picky with fps you should be able to play the game . 
  i was following your logic up to this point . 
  see , from my perspective it looks like that shifty was being honest about his situation and punished for it , more over when he could have hidden it pretty well . 
  i understand that running a big community as drama-free as possible is very desirable , but why not giving him the chance to see if he proves himself . 
   he made no mention of his relationship with a banned member when he applied, 
  it 's also not really in the requirements to join st that there should be no affiliations with previous members , so how would he have known . 
  on top of that appeared to be a second issue :, 
   whether or not you are the same person is a total secondary concern, 
  would n't you agree that in this day and age this is a pretty easy thing to figure out ? 
  a skype call or just talking to the members who know shifty irl and trusted would have been sufficient , right ? 
  since this is game related : i assume by radar you mean the hud that tells you were people are in relation to you . 
  in a video game you have a limited field of view and you generally lack a certain situational awareness , since you are basically stripped of all your senses but two . 
  and those two senses are limited . 
  so irl if someone is walking 5 meters diagonally behind you , you would be able to hear their steps and if they talk you could pinpoint relatively precisely where they are . 
  in a game this is just not possible , the sound sources are not exact enough to make out someones location relative to your own and due to your narraw fov you are not able to see movements in the corner of your eye . 
  st hud gives back the lack of senses you would have irl . 
  i do n't know what you mean by mini map , but i 'm gon na go out on a limb here and assume you mean the gps in the bottom right corner ? 
  yeah those things are called satnav or global positioning system , they 've been around for a while , and while i would agree that having one open for the entirety of a mission is not realistic , it comes close to having a handheld gps in your pocket . 
  kicked for potential drama -  stirs up drama by making reddit post -  drama could have been avoided if they would n't have kicked him and given him a chance to see if he actually caused drama, 
  op claims not to be the same person as the previously baned member and even states that a skype call ( read : video chat ) would have been enough proof . 
  as the top comments put it more eloquently :, 
   a quick use of technology from 5 years ago would have verified things . 
  should have taken all of 20 seconds . 
  your conclusion is faulty . 
  it is based on * assumptions * , not evidence . 
  op himself offered evidence to defeat those assumptions ** but ** this was dismissed for whatever reason . 
  banning someone because they are potential drama is just poor sportsmanship imho . 
  either someone has caused problems and needs to be removed or someone has not caused problems and can stay . 
  this is one of the reasons why i enjoyed my old unit . 
  the unit was not run by a council of 6-8 members who had the power to overrule any decision , it was held together by a set of few but strict rules . 
  if you break a rule , you get a warning , do it again and you 're out . 
  additionally * drama * is a very subjective and loose term . 
  what is drama exactly ? 
  if two people argue ? 
  is there a certain set of people involved for it to be a drama ? 
  does it need to public or can drama also occur in private settings ? 
  if / u/dslyecxi creates a video that polarizes his audience and potentially st , is he also a unpredictable vector for undesired drama ? 
  as i said i completely understand his desire to run such a big group with the fewest disturbances possible , however kicking someone out based on what you assume they could do just seems outright unfair . 
   he/she got banned for being connected to the same person with the ultimate connection of sharing the same ip . 
  this is where the system has loopholes . 
  if someone would live the same complex as one of the highest members in st and would get banned , would the high member need to leave as well , just because they happen to live in the same area ? 
  `` lets just bomb this general direction , do n't care what it hits '' . 
   which conclusion ? 
  the only one that you can not back up with facts ( `` a '' if you did n't get it . 
  b & c are facts stated by op himself , so not really that hard to figure it out and d is an opinion .
