  iirc op said that he could n't connect to ts ( possibly ) swapped ip and then talked to high ranking st members about his ip issue , upon which he was kicked . 
  so all in all , your great conclusion making has not brought you any further . 
  also : good sportsmanship on downvoting my post . 
  what was that for ? 
  because i disagree with you ? 
   and can you ? 
  neither party has given any source of anything really . 
  i do not need to . 
  you conclude that op is the same person as the banned member because of their ip ? 
  i suggest you look up what in dubio pro reo means . 
  just tested it ( mind you in vr ) and it does not impact performance what so ever . 
  depending on the number of pilots / air crew i would not recommend taking a real life approach . 
  say you have a unit with 30-40 people per mission and you have 3 people who volunteer as pilots you might not want to fit every bird with a pilot , crew chief and door gunner . 
  there 's a lot of information missing to give you an in depth answer . 
  how many people will you have in this division ? 
  what kind of play style do you have ( no respawns ? 
  afm enabled ? 
  etc ) what airframes are we talking about here ? 
  how `` realistic '' is this air division expected to operate ? 
  nope , i was driving it in vr today and afaik it even goes beyond 300 . 
  i might be mixing up my numbers though, 
  as stated you do n't need an ide . 
  for the first 6 months of learning c++ i used gedit and compiled in the command line with gcc . 
  especially for beginners i would actually discourage using a full blown ide because there is so much stuff that will confuse you and that you do n't really need . 
  you have n't stated your knowledge about the language but unless you are already working on large projects that stretch over multiple source and header files you do n't need an ide . 
  learn to walk before you run . 
  you could go through the group listing in the sidebar and check out the public server of units . 
  i believe the 15thmeu has a public server with mods , not sure though . 
  [ a quick google search will reveal what bubble sort is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bubble_sort ) , even with code samples, 
  this has less to do with java or any programming language and more with how to solve problems . 
  what you want is a method that looks at the index 0 and index 1 . 
  if [ 0 ] greater than [ 1 ] swap them . 
  then move on to [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] . 
  if [ 1 ] greater than two swap them . 
  move back again to [ 0 ] and [ 1 ] etc. 
  rinse and repeat until your array is sorted . 
  while this is probably the easiest solution its likely not the intention of ops assignment / goal . 
  you goddamn tease !, 
  any idea when you 'll release it ? 
  i get what you 're saying , op could have outlined what the ultimate goal is , but given we are in learnprogramming and op tried to implement a way of sorting the numbers himself , i 'd say he learns more from implementing a solution on his own , rather than using inbuilt functions and libraries . 
  do n't . 
  this is discouraged by bohemia and you might get a key that 's not compatible with your version of steam ( keys are regional locked ) . 
  bohemia has stated multiple times that there are officially two places to get a digital copy of arma 3 . 
  that is steam and their own store , end of . 
  the game will probably go on sale again in spring and / or summer . 
  iirc press shift and numpad - at the same time , then type endmission, 
  you wo n't be able to see a textbox or anything though . 
  great for skipping bugged missions . 
  would n't args [ 0 ] be the first argument after the program name ? 
  it 's also not c++ its java . 
  arrays are initialized differently in c++ . 
  still prohibited by bohemia . 
  and would n't you say it is better to support the developers who not only gave us a solid game but also frequently update and maintain it and have promised to do so over the course of the next years ? 
  you either pay the full price or you wait for a sale , there is literally no other ** legit ** option . 
  going to anywhere else other than the bistudio store or steam is just ripping bohemia off . 
  they get no revenue off it and you can assume that the key was obtained in legally questionable ways . 
  edit : http://arma3.com/faq, 
   if you are planning to buy a digital version of arma 3 , please purchase only from steam or store.bistudio.com to avoid fraudulent vendors . 
  the head first series is generally known for taking a rather slow approach . 
  try to re-read chapters you did n't understand , and if there 's is something you do n't understand at all just keep reading to the end of the chapter . 
  usually they have a set of bullet points or a mock interview at the end that will bring you the knowledge you just gained in a slightly different way . 
  if there are concepts that completely confuse you you can always use google or ask your question here . 
  let me ask you , what specifically confused you or what did n't you understand ? 
  what is a code school , is there a website ? 
  what will you be taught ? 
  ultimately it boils down to you . 
  if you are willing to commit time and energy then i 'm going out on a limb and say you do n't need to spend a single dollar on learning to code . 
  pick a language , get a text editor , compiler and just dig through the vast majority of free tutorials and documentation . 
  if i would go to a school that basically `` only '' focuses on teaching to code and take money for it , my first question would be ` what can you teach me , that i wo n't be able to find myself for free ? ', 
   you can touch down at about 50km/h, 
  only advised if the ground below is straight and long . 
  i would recommend doing that on a bumpy hillside that rapidly ends , when you 're still going fast, 
  hows ' t that helpful in an operation where you 're the pilot ? 
   custom mission, 
  then blame the mission maker , not bi for their generous dlc method . 
  a pm on your forums to whoever is in charge of making missions would be sufficient , would n't it ? 
  toby had one of the most interesting character developments imho . 
  i 've rewatched the earlier seasons in which he even cracks a joke and gets everyone to laugh , it seems like michael is the only one who has this irrational hate for him . 
  he did point out he hates toby because he is hr and works directly for corporate but in a later episode michael himself pointed out that he as well works for corporate , so the reason is just made up . 
  interestingly enough throughout the series toby gets made more and more boring and flat out unlikeable . 
  i remember how in the first seasons i felt really bad for him , michael giving him constantly shit but towards the end of the series he was just annoying and i just could not have any empathy for him . 
  please allow me to address some points you mention in your comment, 
   i go to pick one up in the middle of a firefight , and it happens to be a dlc gun and it 's the only one in reach , i 'm fucked, 
  that is a very specific situation . 
  if you 're playing primarily custom missions an avoidable one too . 
   i had to deal with the cod-style `` future warfare '' bullshit, 
  it was pointed out ** multiple ** times on various platforms ( be it here , bohemia forums or steamcommunity forums ) that all weapons , vehicles and generally assets are based on current real life military gear . 
  what you call `` current warfare '' is actually technology from the 1970-1990 's . 
  the `` future warfare '' is very much realistic and not as future as you think . 
  go ahead and google `` merkava iv '' or `` fennek '' . 
  same goes for the weapons . 
   the absolutely abysmal frame-rate/optimization issues , unbelievable desync, 
  that is constantly being worked on . 
  optimization gets better with every major update . 
  anyone denying that is not telling the truth . 
   terrible physics ( seriously , my car explodes and flies two miles after nudging a post ), 
  a lot of people complain about the physics , and while surely it could use some work i do n't find it as bad . 
  especially the example you gave is not true . 
  do you have a source ? 
  when i nudge a post my vehicle just makes a few crashing noises but thats it .
