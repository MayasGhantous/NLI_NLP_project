  no flying away . 
   no ` throwback ' maps , only two stock maps, 
  this one bothers me the most . 
  bohemia interactive is a company that provides software . 
  as such they must adhere to certain standards within their software ( read : must be good quality ) . 
  if they just put the maps in from a2 it would have not looked good . 
  outdated models and low res textures . 
  as such the designers at bi would have been forced to work on these old maps , when there is more important work that needs to be done on the new maps . 
  and while it is just two maps one of them is really huge . 
  you can play a mission on one side of the map , then on the other and if you would n't know that this is on the same island there is no way you could have guessed it . 
  just google chernarus vs altis and look at the difference in size . 
  note that chernarus was also bigger than takistan iirc . 
   the ridiculously exaggerated weapon sway , stamina that makes me look like a marathon runner ,, 
  that argument is old . 
  i would have accepted it shortly after the stamina update was staged but since then it 's been revamped a lot , there are guides out there on how to conserve your stamina in the best way possible and we have weapon resting and bipods in the game now . 
  stop running like this was battlefield or call of duty and you are good to go . 
   they say they stay with it because it 's easier to mod and create missions for, 
  which is true, 
   but at this point i think the extra effort would be worth it to go back to a2, 
  what most people fail to realize is that a2 is also very badly optimized , it might run with more fps but if you slap 60 players and one hundred ai on the map the server will perform worse than in a3 . 
   but what i ca n't understand is paying 15 fucking dollars each for a pack with either a few guns or two helicopters . 
  that 's insane . 
  also , the `` included in the dlc '' stuff you mentioned is almost all going to be available for free anyways ... 
  so the only ` new ' things i 'll be buying will be the weapons and suits, 
  well first off , lets get our terminology correct here : a dlc is different from an expansion pack . 
  and when you say with the dlc buyers only got two helicopters , you dismiss the fact that the huron got a few different pods as well , so in reality you get a little more than just that . 
  but lets focus on the marksman dlc . 
  it is quite rich in content . 
  7 weapons is actually a lot for * just * 15 dollars , given the quality of the models , and the knowledge that they will fix issues if the community spots any . 
  as far as it goes what you said will be free for anyone in a couple of days , bi has mentioned they will follow a very strict policy : content is paid , features will be free . 
  i view the dlcs like this , i have bought a game in alpha pretty cheap , and unlike other alpha games this game was and is being continuously worked on . 
  bugs are fixed , content is being updated , the community is listened to . 
  so in reality i am supporting bohemia by buying the dlc , and i show my appreciation towards them . 
   i do n't even know what a 3d editor is and i know i do n't want it . 
  i can whole heartedly tell you that you are in a crushing minority with this view . 
  anyone who has ever created , edited or in any way shape or form bothered with missions other than playing them , will love this thing . 
   i understand the need to put food on the table and make a profit . 
  but there 's better ways to do it ... 
  there 's really not tbh . 
  look at other games that provide dlc that needs to be bought . 
  most games decide they will split their playerbase into two fractions , those who have the weapon xyz dlc and those who do n't . 
  if you have it and your friends do n't , there is no way for you to play with them other you disabling the dlc and as such missing out on features and content . 
  in arma 3 , anyone can play with anyone . 
  there are no restrictions ** who ** you can interact with , just ** what ** you can interact with . 
  and that is really fair . 
  if you 're implying that i work for bi than i must sadly say i do n't , though i am flattered for the assumption . 
  i find it generous myself , this adjective was no where used by bi . 
  there 's a more detailed reply i posted to you in which i explain why i find them generous . 
  why do you need to know ? 
  i 'm not that interested in streams than i am in youtube videos . 
  i realize that there is a lot of interaction between streamer and audience but the lack of rewinding and skipping ahead is just taking the appeal away from me . 
  would be believable if the bbc would n't have `` postponed '' two topgear episodes and therefor lost a lot of money . 
  some people in / r/arma have divided opinions about the marksman dlc and arma 3 as well . 
  the main arguments being the recurring :, 
  the dlc will split the community, 
  when it 's critical in a mission we will all fail because we can not use dlc assets, 
  arma 3 should have been just a revamped arma 2, 
  all the weapons are futuristic, 
  fps / server desync is bad, 
  not enough content, 
  google : can i run it . 
  i 'll post a link below to their site but i 'm on mobile , so the layout might be messed up . 
  also : no help to get the game torrented will be provided here , i can guarantee you that, 
  this . 
  pinpointing the source of the issue will be easier if we know possible causes, 
  webm thread ? 
  this is not 4chan you know . 
  it 's extensive but also mostly outdated . 
  do n't use a third party allocator . 
  it will improve loading times but not actual performance, 
  yes this is true , as it will be faster for you to load the textures from the location where the game is stored into the memory , but ultimately it will only give you a fps boost only when travelling at fast speeds ( read : you need to load lots of textures into the memory really quick ) . 
  in your standard gameplay this wo n't affect you as much . 
  if you really want to bring the downvotes in mention the dlc , altis life or wasteland . 
  one one side , i highly appreciate your work . 
  i mean lets be honest what you do and did is nothing you could easily learn in a weekend . 
  especially the whole battleeye-sends-files-to-masterserver thing back then was a great piece of work . 
  but on the other hand it ** is ** what you did . 
  and it 's not so much about who you are , rather than what you contributed to this community . 
  yes you uncovered some loopholes and probably had a good effect on the game , but then again you sell / sold hacks to ruin the game for others . 
  but that is the reputation you chose to build , if it 's worth it is a question you should ask yourself and do n't blame others . 
  nothing but dlc content in that mission . 
  let the circlejerk begin !, 
  kavala seems to be the crux for most people . 
  though in this case i suspect it 's less the amount of textures being loaded but the sheer amount of vertices that need to be rendered . 
  that is just an assumption though and not based on any technical research, 
  i 'm not an expert , but would n't you always frag-and-clear a building / room in which you suspect enemy presence but at the same time you are sure there is no civilian in there ? 
  this seems like the most efficient and safe way to do it . 
  however i would n't call the building clear upon detonation , only if every room was checked , since the blastradius ca n't reach all rooms . 
  ** tl ; dr ** looks like standard practice to me ? 
  true , but a texture is just a picture , that has a bit of metadata , but nothing big or complex . 
  loading a polygon is likely to be more sophisticated , given that you also need to calculate light , casting shadows etc etc so all in all thats a lot of ( floating point ) calculations . 
  i 'd be surprised if armed forces mow down entire houses with charges . 
  blast charges to open doors , but demolishing a house sounds unrealistic to me . 
  what 's the purpose of giving setid and setgrades a return value , but you only ever return 0 ? 
  you do n't need to set these values in main , that would defeat the point of having a class , you want to store them in your object and access them later via a method . 
  ** edit ** no longer on mobile so i can give more details . 
  you set your setid ( ) ; method so that it takes an integer as a parameter . 
  so when calling the function you need to pass it an integer such as student.setid ( 5 ) ; however you are immediately overwriting the value with your cin call . 
  so overall you have a bunch of concepts mixed up . 
  how to solve them now ?
