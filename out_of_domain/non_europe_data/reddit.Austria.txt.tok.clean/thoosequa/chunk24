  you know that arma 3 is a game right ? 
  simulations ( if we 're still calling arma a sim ) needs to sacrifices of realistic aspects in order to stay immersive and interesting . 
  of course arma does not replicate real military . 
  when playing you might have also noticed that you are not standing around for hours , clean your weapon constantly and vehicles also need minimum maintenance . 
  if people want that , why not ? 
  calling them losers is not really helping the cause . 
  at the end of the day , arma is a sandbox game , as such your experience is tailored by you . 
  if people want to call each other , sir , go through bootcamp and training in a virtual world i really do n't see any reason why you would n't let them . 
  look i understand that as former military member you get offended when people put on patches they never earned and carry ranks they never had . 
  in reality though ( and i used to be a member of one of those groups ) you can list the people there generally in two groups . 
  ex military who enjoyed the lifestyle but do n't want to reenlist and civilians who can not or do n't want to enlist because of physical limitations or their environment . 
  not once however have i witnessed a disrespectful behavior that was tolerated by those groups . 
  they do what they do , if you like or not , but the general consensus is that they do take their things seriously . 
  i can see why this is not everyone 's cup of tea , however i do believe in a respectful treatment throughout the community , whether you are hardcore milsimmer , life player or breaking point enthusiast . 
   quite funny that i can run pretty much any new game at higher settings whilst i can barely run a3 with lowest settings, 
  er , not really funny nor surprising . 
  i barely know any games that have a similar simulation rate on a similarly sized map as arma 3 . 
  what most people do n't realize is that there is * a lot * of stuff going on , way more than in your conventional aaa shooter . 
  as someone already mentioned , the lowest settings is not what you want to shoot for . 
  to get the best out of your system you should hit the sweet spot with custom settings between normal and high . 
  it will take some time , but ultimately it well get you where you want to go . 
  disclaimer for tpw ( in case you want these mods for your group / friends ), 
   tpw mods are primarily designed with single player in mind , and are generally player centric , spawning ambience and behaviour around the player to conserve cpu and give the illusion of a living map . 
  if verifying did n't work then completely remove the game including all profile folders in appdata . 
  i 've always found that removing every bit often solves even the peskiest problems . 
  +1 for a video posted here that is not 30 minutes long and +1 for cutting straight to the action . 
  also +1 for mad pilot skills . 
  verdict : 10/10 would upvote again, 
  this is just a wild guess so please take it with a grain of salt but i presume to reflect shots from the front better . 
  if the surface you are shooting at is hard enough and angled the bullet will ricochet off rather than damaging your engine block . 
  make sure your ports are forwarded , on the multiplayer server list just click `` new '' or `` host '' ( one of the two ) and you 're good to go . 
  unfortunately is all been a bit buggy since the past few months . 
  if all fails it 's not really expensive to rent a server for a couple of friends if everyone chips some money in . 
  if you accomplish what you promise here , you are godsend , op . 
  being introduced into a large open source project even to solely passively participate is something i ( and probably a lot of novice programmers ) would highly benefit from . 
  too many courses and tutorials out there stop right after teaching you the basics . 
  the problem with that is there is too little experience to create your own large-ish project and too little experience to actively participate in open source projects consisting of millions of lines of code . 
  do n't put your settings on low . 
  this will offload calculations from the gpu to the cpu leading to even worse results . 
  check out the day0 guide linked in literally ever fps / performance thread in this subreddit . 
  ** if ** this is true it is a real shame . 
  while i can see others picking up the project it saddens me to see such a talented and motivated individual like koffeinflummi discontinuing his work . 
  a medical mod , that shall remain unnamed promised simulating everything . 
  from blood pressure and heart beats to body temperature . 
  all in all it * sounded * amazing from a medical game point of view but at one point the realism just drains the fun out of the game . 
  there are certain aspects that need to be dumbed down ( within reason ) to keep up the flow of the game play . 
  better is a relative term . 
  it might perform differently and do some things `` better '' than agm . 
  but given the range and scope of these two mods it 's hard to believe that one mod outperforms the other in every single aspect . 
  ~ ~ the connection between this and the manw contest is definitely here . 
  while the money for the first place was very tempting , i can see why it is upsetting if you lose against a mod that adds units , vehicles and weapons . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ do n't get me wrong , i enjoy rhs just as everyone else , but the work involved in something like rhs is entirely differently perceived than something like agm or cse . 
  the effects the latter two have on the gameplay are much more subtle than seeing new units running down a hill followed by a big ass m1 abrams . ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ rhs has done an astounding job and so did agm / cse , it must have been a tough decision to decide between these mods , given their nature . 
  i for one am happy that i was not in the boots of a jury member . ~ ~, 
  i can completely understand that ( if thats the case ) the teams behind agm and cse are upset that they did n't won to the point of discontinuing their mods . 
  upset is probably not the right word . 
  demotivated . 
  exactly , not only does it get too complex for the medic , but imagine you 're 10 minutes into the action of an operation , you get shot and you 're out for the next 50 minutes, 
  agm has to be one of the best documented mods i 've seen . 
  just take a look on their github page, 
   for one , the merging of cse , agm , and ace3 was discussed on agm 's github between developers of these mods . 
  when the topic of the manw contest was brought up , they said that it would not matter if merging disqualified them . 
   second , dslyecxi addressed the question of why shacktac had not been using either cse or agm . 
  he said something was going to happen after manw , and that 's what shacktac was going to use . 
  i certainly did now know that . 
  while this is some relief , i wo n't make any assumptions of what the feature brings until we get more announcements . 
  so far we know two things : agm and cse did not win the manw contest , agm and cse discontinued their work, 
  so is this also a thing ? 
  ( my_bool _ ) ) ) ), 
   bi ca n't even optimize it on a single platform for a monster pc, 
  ah , i see you are jumping between threads with your baseless claims . 
  let me quote / u/artemisdimikaelo real quick again and see if you answer the question this time :, 
   please , do give me another benchmark of a game similar to this , or some other evidence that it should be better than this . 
  also :, 
   arma runs at 24fps making it no better than an xbox, 
  with the latest updates the game runs in a solid 40-60 fps depending on the server i am on . 
   solid 40fps ... that 's laughable . 
  [ what did you say ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/30yjl2/what_is_needed_for_arma_3_to_run_smooth_and_stable/cpwzhmy ), 
  and you still fail to reply to the question, 
   give me another benchmark of a game similar to this , or some other evidence that it should be better than this . 
  read my reply again . 
  you said yourself you get a solid 40 fps . 
  the reason why arma struggles to get the 90 fps other first person shooters like battlefield achieve is because of the simulation going on . 
  the map sizes and simulation rates in battlefield ( for example ) are way lower . 
  battlefield and call of duty ( since you brought them up as competitors ) do have fancy looks , yes but arma 3 has comparably good looking models and texture work . 
  the main difference in the look-and-feel is just that battlefield ( for example ) tends to slap a massive post process filter on everything . 
  however when it comes to size in actual gameplay , such as bullet trajectory calculations , ai path finding etc arma easily outperforms anything in the market ( as of now ) . 
  since you keep derailing the actual discussion i will end this now . 
  on an ending note though :, 
   do you even english ? 
  no i do n't . 
  english is not my first language , but i do n't think that 's a problem . 
  i did enjoy the medical additions in when i was in my former unit as well . 
  when we first got our hands on xmed we were brought back to the glorious times of ace , but truth be told if you are a medic the whole process gets kinda same-y . 
  if the mod does n't provide enough depth there are very little challenges . 
  and if the mod provides too much depth medical procedures become too complex . 
  it 's a difficult thing , this whole medic deal, 
  inb4 nou and his team , koffeinflummi and his team ** and ** glowbal and his team work on ace3 under the supervision of / u/dslyecxi creating the most immersive , in-depth and advanced realism mod .
