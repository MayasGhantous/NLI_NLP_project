  the appropriate forums would be a better place . 
  i 'd say that 's mostly because of the volume of the subreddit . 
  / r/dayz with it 's +115 k subscribers is far more popular than / r/arma with +23 k. 
  i do n't mind posted any arma related content on here . 
  dayz is its own game now but altislife still is a mission in arma 3 . 
  i 'd much prefer watching an entertaining altis life video , than a 40 minute boring mission footage of someone 's unit , where they are primarily doing nothing . 
  well , for one you try to print x without giving it a value . 
  same goes for size . 
  i remember seeing one of the arma devs posting on this subreddit that they actually ca n't see through bushes , but if the last known position of the player is behind a bush they will shoot through it for some time . 
  so if you 're spotted and take cover behind a bush you wil still get killed . 
  i 'll try to dig up the post but i ca n't promise anything . 
  edit : found it !, 
  this guy . 
  posted the exact same question earlier , deleted the thread since no one solved the problem for him and created a new thread . 
  it 's been said multiple times not to use any other retailers other than steam or the official bohemia website . 
  the currency displayed in steam should have minimal effect on the item 's price, 
  the only instance where steam changes the currency ( that i know of ) is using a vpn . 
  there * might * be a setting for that , but it would surprise me . 
   have never had a single problem using another retailer as long as you can see their sell count to verify . 
  it 's not about you having problems with the retailer . 
  bohemia does not get any revenue from other places than steam and their own store . 
  so when you buy their product somewhere else , you 're not only not supporting them , you are also actively working against them . 
  if you 're lucky the price of the dlc dips a little , but there is no legit alternative to that . 
   well i 'm telling you then that you are wrong then because south africa 's currency is not offered on steam, 
  i never claimed i was right . 
   the only instance where steam changes the currency ** ( that i know of ) **, 
  but thanks for clearing that up , i certainly did not know that . 
   how exactly would those retailers get any arma 3 related content if it not from bohemia, 
  most likely through illegal means i assume ? 
  taken from [ this official bohemia link ] ( http://support.bistudio.com/store-bistudio/steam/97 ), 
   moreover , please do not buy our or any other games from unofficial cd-key stores or unreliable resellers . 
  if you do , and the game does not work for any reason , we will not be able to provide any support . 
   landing under heavy fire, 
   landing in the hummingbird, 
  choose one, 
   drifter 's no fatigue, 
  never heard of it before , does it remove fatigue altogether ? 
  since you mentioned low settings : do n't use them . 
  lowest settings offload a lot of graphical calculations to your cpu , causing even more issues . 
  your best chance of getting the most out of the game is fiddling with the individual settings until you hit that sweet spot . 
  itt downvotes for no apparent reason . 
  there are two obvious approaches here , both already mentioned . 
  you could either take the input as a string at just iterate over its characters , however that will leave you again with chars and not actual integers . 
  i was given a similar assignment in my c++ course , the idea behind this task is to learn how to handle single digits in a large number . 
  the mathematical approach is using the modulo operator , as pointed out by others . 
  what approach you take does n't really matter , though i feel like implementing your own version of this problem is better practice than taking a string and just using charat ( ), 
  i enjoy the fatigue and weapon sway that comes with it . 
  it makes the game more challenging and brings more factors into combat . 
  it rewards you for choosing different running techniques that suit the situation and punishes you for running weapon up with 10 tons of gear . 
  those who complain about it being unrealistic and stupid mostly do n't understand that running in arma does n't translate 1:1 into irl . 
  being an effective infantryman in your team now equates to more than being able to shoot targets over long distances, 
   not only is the dlc too expensive ... but if they are making the game worse they should be giving people some money back . 
  they are not really making it worse . 
  the weapon sounds have a barely noticeable pop at the end , which can a ) easily be fixed and b ) does not change the gameplay in any way . 
  you got qutie the overreaction there . 
  literally nothing needs to be learned prior to learn how to code . 
  a good coding tutorial made for people who never coded before wi guide you through the very first steps , from setting up your environment , to basic knowledge and `` programming vocabulary '' . 
  just start learning and if there is anything unclear , use google to solve your problem or come back here . 
   java is similar to c++, 
  did n't stoustroup mention in an interview that java and c++ share nothing but similarity in their syntax and that 's about it ? 
  if the languages are fundamentally different ( as stoustroup stated , ** iirc ** ) then coding wo n't be similar either . 
  it 's a small issue that was nothing but overlooked and probably will be patched out over the course of the next updates . 
  i you wan na go full butthurt about this go ahead , but i 'm not shitting on bi for a minor mistake in the nth update they provided for free . 
  thanks for clearing that up !, 
  always good to know more, 
  couple issues with that . 
  for one steam eula declares that you are not allowed to hide your location with a vpn while you 're using steam . 
  so telling them that you 've done exactly that might not be the best idea . 
  secondly , how did you get a russian key if you 're not in russia ? 
  i assume it was through a key retailer , which means bohemia interactive support wo n't help you , since they stated there are only two legitimate ways to get the game : their store and steam . 
  from the rules :, 
   no rewards : learnprogramming does not condone monetary or other rewards for work within the community . 
  posting guidelines 6 :, 
  never post a screenshot of your code !, 
  use one of the tools below instead . 
  honestly for now rolling back is probably easier , but in the long run you might want to get comfortable remapping your controls . 
  as far as i know , you will limit yourself with the missions you will be able to play or the servers you will be able to play on . 
  so unless you plan on solely playing the campaign , and solely playing sp missions that will run on your version of the game ( granted they dont get updated , via steam workshop for example ) i do n't think this is a good long term solution for you . 
  i do n't have any screenshots of footage sadly , but my group regularly gets about 50-60 players per mission . 
  uninstall the game , remove any trace from the game from your drive ( including the folders in % appdata % ( back them up though ) ) . 
  once you 've done that re-install . 
  and come back, 
  i 'm out of guesses then . 
  i know this sounds stupid , but make sure your game runs without any startup parameters or mods . 
  poorly written mods can cause crashes , so can faulty mission pbos and buggy memory allocators . 
  if all else fails , try contacting bi over their official support form :, 
   german is required to attend classes . 
  at the moment my knownledge is zero : is possible to learn german in one year enough to pass the test , or in general , to comprend what is said in classes ? 
  well , in theory yes . 
  but that is completely dependent on the time you invest into the language and the resources at your disposal . 
  if you study german once a week solely from a book and without hearing the language , you 'll probably struggle getting into it . 
   i 'll attend master degree while working ( probably 5 days/week from 9.00 to 17.00 ) . 
  does university offer any agevolation for student workers , or in general , the didactic material necessary to study without attending classes ? 
  i 'm currently studying in an undergrad field so i ca n't give you first hand information . 
  in theory university is supposed to be `` your job '' so you 'll have a hard time finding mandatory classes that suit your work time , and generally uni does n't bend around your workschedule , rather the other way around . 
  with that being said i have a couple friends studying in a master 's degree and they are working as well , though just 20-30 hours per week . 
  as far as it goes for the didactic material , in theory ( again ) you should be supplied with all you need ( you might need to get some books from a library ) but it wo n't replace mandatory classes , so keep that in mind . 
   what 's the language generally used during md classes ? 
  german or english ? 
  my experience is that while most classes and lectures are held in german , some courses will also be offered in english .
