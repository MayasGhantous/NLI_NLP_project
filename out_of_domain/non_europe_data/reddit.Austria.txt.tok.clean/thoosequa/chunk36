  upgrading your cpu can be a hassle if you do n't know what you 're doing . 
  head over to / r/buildapc and let you help there with your problem , they are great folks and the average user there probably knows more about getting the best bang for your buck than the average arma player . 
  in all honesty , i 'm running a similar rig ( 8350 ) with a similar gpu ( 660ti ) . 
  i agree the game does n't run perfect but it 's not that terrible . 
  spending a thousand bucks for solely one game is n't really worth it imho . 
  as i said , higher your settings a bit , lower settings mean the graphical calculations will be done on the cpu rather than the gpu , leading to even worse fps . 
  the stickied thread and sidebar also should include a few helpful steps to increase fps a little . 
  at the end of the day it 's your money but the fx8xxx series is not a terrible cpu and dependent on the age of your rig , you might want to keep it for a little longer . 
  especially considering that the 8xxx beat a lot of other cpus in it 's price range . 
  + a possible psu if ops current one is not sufficient . 
  it 's a rather unnecessary component . 
  if you have the money and you do n't need to worry about anything else go for it , but it does n't increase fps , just loading times . 
  there 's varying reports . 
  so far we 've heard that the fury x is comparable to the titan x and the fury comparable to the 980ti . 
  then we 've heard that the fury x is comparable to the 980ti and the fury clocks in below the fury x. 
  matter of fact is that all we are doing is speculating . 
  the nda for the fury x is lifted on the 24th and no one even has a fury card yet , meaning that no one knows where the fury comes in the performance range . 
  it was n't a review , since there are none right now . 
  a couple threads over at / r/amd where stating the fury was a direct competitor to the 980ti , because of it 's lower price and equal power . 
  while the fury x would beat the 980ti ( performance wise ) and be on par with the titan x. 
  reading all the stuff what you all are working on is very humbling . 
  i 'm currently `` working '' on an exam i have in a couple of days about electromagnetism and atomism , second year undergrad, 
  this is more or less spot on from what i 've heard . 
  they also ban violent games from being sold in local stores . 
  so they are hard to get your hands on . 
  which is persistent across missions , making it even more unbalanced towards newcomers . 
  at this point most things are assumptions , official reviews are n't out until wednesday for the fury x and the 14th for the fury, 
  sell it as a whole , sell the parts seperately or just keep it . 
  there is no downside to having a second computer in the house or temporary replacement parts when your main computer breaks down .

  ** situation **, 
  welcome to [ tanoa ] ( http://arma3.com/tanoa ) !, 
  it was a great joy for us all to finally introduce our next arma 3 terrain to you . 
  the south pacific archipelago will be the main component of the game 's expansion that is to be released during the first half of 2016 . 
  how we intend to release the expansion will be outlined more specifically in a new road map blog over the next few weeks . 
  we can confirm that this expansion is premium , and will follow our [ dlc strategy ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/post/oprep-content-licensing ) ( the terrain being a new aspect as you will need to own the expansion for access ) . 
  any vehicles , weapons and other content is treated similarly to the try-before-you-buy approach in [ helicopters ] ( http://arma3.com/dlc/helicopters ) / [ marksmen ] ( http://arma3.com/dlc/marksmen ) dlc . 
  features developed alongside are to be free for everyone who owns the game . 
  and , those people who contributed from the beginning by purchasing the supporter edition , do indeed already own this expansion ( it 's not stand-alone ) . 
  thank you again for the support during the early alpha days !, 
  while we were packing our bags to head to los angeles and e3 , a little leak sprung in our web pipes . 
  this was not deliberate nor a hack of any kind . 
  it was caused by a glitch in account management on the company website , which gave access to our pre-published blog with screenshots . 
  fortunately for us , the trailer was safe . 
  at the pc gaming show we dropped [ the first moving pictures of tanoa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ahxzih5l0g ) , which should give you a good impression of the atmosphere , while keeping lots of key areas for you to explore yourselves . 
  let 's go over some of the things you might have noticed in the [ trailer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ahxzih5l0g ) and [ screenshots ] ( https://twitter.com/arma3official/status/611172888461185024 ) !, 
  * we consider the terrain to be ** geotypical fiji ** , but it 's not an exact recreation of that real-world location ( it 's a mix of various satellite heightmaps , so not geospecific ) . 
  we 'll be further discussing our motivations for this ( awesome ) setting later . 
  * ** a new fixed-wing aircraft ** and a ** waterscooter ** will be part of the expansion . 
  but fear not ; the ** focus ** remains ** military ** . 
  we 're just not ready to reveal those vehicles , weapons and characters yet . 
  * you can see work-in-progress ** water reflections , improved shoreline effects and enhanced overall lighting configuration ** . 
  these technologies and features will arrive to everyone , and to the existing arma 3 terrains . 
  these are also not all features coming alongside the expansion !, 
  we 'll discuss more and more as the year goes on . 
  * most of the audio is not yet from in-game recordings , but it gives an impression of how we want to push the soundscape further , especially in terms of ** ambient audio ** . 
  the goal is to deeply immerse you in our `` green hell '' !, 
  * as the opening disclaimer points out : the terrain is still in the middle of production . 
  many of the objects you see in the distance are early placeholders . 
  we 're very happy that it already looks and feels this good now !, 
  the pc gaming show itself was a lot of fun to [ attend ] ( https://twitter.com/arma3official/status/612964707239100417 ) . 
  we had originally wanted to reveal tanoa a little later in the year , but when this opportunity came around , we jumped on it . 
  the team scrambled to work on specific parts of the terrain to show off , and they did a great job under some significant time pressure . 
  as a sponsor , bohemia interactive was given two 5 minute slots for our games , so we got one segment for [ arma 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0n0t_cojea ) and one for [ dayz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibnyfuc_tw4 ) / [ take on mars ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhhozaqbrvi ) . 
  it was high time for a pc-focused event at e3 !, 
  we 're very glad pc gamer took on the challenge of organizing one . 
  big thanks to sean `` day9 '' plott as well for doing a great job of hosting the entire 2.5 hour show !, 
  we hope you are as excited as we are to start running operations on tanoa . 
  ** prepare for the war on the horizon !, 
  ** intelligence **, 
  [ dev-branch ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/dev-branch ) has [ received ] ( https://twitter.com/killzone_kid/status/608604572035203073 ) a few useful script commands . 
  in the case of [ param ] ( https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/param ) and [ params ] ( https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/params ) , the idea was to replicate previously scripted behavior and make it faster and more reliable . 
  senior designer [ karel mo\u0159ick\u00fd ] ( https://twitter.com/karelmoricky ) elaborates : '' * this is a command for reading function parameters and making sure they are in the correct format . 
  if it 's not the case , the user is warned and a safe default value is used instead . 
  this functionality was until now provided by scripted function [ bis_fnc_param ] ( https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/bis_fnc_param ) , but a dedicated engine command makes it significantly faster . 
  in his free time , senior designer [ josef zem\u00e1nek ] ( https://twitter.com/josefzemanek1 ) has been [ working ] ( https://twitter.com/josefzemanek1/status/610833751820660736 ) on an unofficial multiplayer game mode : [ warlords ] ( http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?192736-warlords ) . 
  he describes the mode as a sector control / capture the island hybrid that supports team-versus-team , player-versus-player and cooperative play . 
  subscribe to the mode directly on [ steam workshop ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462357997 ) and give it a go . 
  josef is keen to read about your experiences , so leave him some feedback for future iterations . 
  we would like to reiterate that this work is entirely unofficial , and we do not provide ( technical ) support for it via official channels . 
  ** operations **, 
  our very own encoding lead [ petr kol\u00e1\u0159 ] ( https://twitter.com/lathspel ) has made tweaks to the ** field of view ** of the ** naked eye ** perspectives : '' * users of dev-branch may have noticed our effort to make field of view consistent for all weapons and vehicle positions without optics . 
  this should not only provide players with a consistent experience of default zoom and focused view , but it should also address issues regarding the inconsistent display of optics magnification descriptions . 
  we hope that the changes are going to provide smoother gameplay while changing various weapons and vehicle seats . 
  feel free to provide [ feedback ] ( http://feedback.arma3.com/ ) in case we have missed something . 
  even though it 's been almost two weeks , we 'd like to provide a few more details about the ** 1.46 hotfix ** ( see the [ spotrep ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/post/spotrep-00044 ) ) . 
  update 1.46 was not a good one initially , and we apologize again for the issues it caused . 
  * the * dxgi_error_device_removed * crash should have been fixed in the majority of cases . 
  if it does still happen , you may also want to check your display drivers , gpu temperatures and power supply . 
  our special thanks go out to community member mickeymen , who provided us with the only reliable repro scenario that allowed our programmers to connect a debugger to affected pcs and trace where the drivers crashed . 
  * a crash observed mostly in [ epoch ] ( https://twitter.com/epochmod ) mod was not yet fully fixed , though dev-branch should now contain a full fix for that as well . 
  * as [ discussed previously ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/post/sitrep-00110 ) , we have indeed decided to take the slow route with [ battleye ] ( http://www.battleye.com/ ) 's white-listing . 
  it does not block extensions for now and only gathers information for a future iteration . 
  the goal here still is a more secure multiplayer environment for everyone . 
  * if you still encounter start-up issues , please first of all try to disable any custom shader mods or registry / memory tweaks . 
  it is also possible your user settings got corrupted and will prevent the game from starting via steam . 
  as an [ interim hotfix ] ( https://twitter.com/arma3official/status/611123152072998912 ) , you can run a tool via the [ arma 3 tools dev-branch ] ( http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?179347-tools-development-branch-changelog&amp;p=2953476&amp;viewfull=1#post2953476 ) or [ this mirror ] ( http://arma.jiripolasek.com/ ) by launcher programmer [ ji\u0159\u00ed pol\u00e1\u0161ek ] ( https://twitter.com/jiripolasekcom ) .
