  ** linux server administrators ** may be helped by [ this comprehensive ** guide ** ] ( https://medium.com/arma-3-server-administration/installation-and-configuration-of-an-arma-3-linux-dedicated-server-7875c9030b7 ) on setting up such server ( including dlc and mods ) . 
  thanks [ eric grubaugh ] ( https://twitter.com/erictgrubaugh/status/603743931378049024 ) for updating and sharing it !, 
  they mentioned dx12 would be released together with the expansion . 
  i do n't think there is more at this point . 
  though i suspect they will stage dx12 in the dev branch weeks and months before releasing it on stable so they can get enough data / tickets from users . 
  this is obviously a very very rough estimation and take my word with a grain of salt but the expansion was announced for the first halt of 2016 , meaning we might see first bits of tanoa and dx12 at the end of 2015 . 
  if it 's not in the sitrep there is no information about it . 
  with that being said i think you are referring to a nato fixed wing fighter , right ? 
  because independent and opfor have aa variants of their jets . 
  but since they mentioned new vehicles in the report , i reckon we will get new planes as well . 
  well , especially the opfor jet is fast and quickly being able to cut corners , if anything by design i think it 's more of an aa fighter than a cas jet . 
  the independent jet kind of falls between blufor and opfor , it 's not as quick but still relatively agile . 
  all in all they are aa jets , even if you disagree , by the game 's definition they are fixed wing aa fighters . 
   i 'm just disappointed that two years after alpha we still have n't ** heard a word of the jets . 
  there was never a promise to bring us more jets , so why would they give word of it ? 
  i understand the frustration and trust me i want new and more jets just like the next guy but the game remains an infantry focused military shooter . 
  we have 1 jet , 1 mbt , 1 mrap , 1 artillery piece and 1 ifv per side . 
  helicopter wise the numbers go up a bit but not a lot . 
  4 , 3 and 2 respectively for blu - , op - and indfor ( if i have my numbers correct ) . 
  would it be nice to see more assets ? 
  yes , definitely . 
  will we see more assets with the expansion ? 
  of course . 
  will they implement more fixed wing airframes ? 
  possible , but no one can say for sure until bi releases more infos about the expansion . 
  it 's not only etiquette , it 's actually a rule ( from the sidebar ) :, 
   all server recruitment/advertisement posts belong in / r/findaunit, 
  do n't be . 
   i fear that i 'll either lose interest in the subject, 
  losing interest is nothing bad , to be honest , it gives you new insights . 
  interests are barely lost , just shifted . 
  one of my profs lost interest in physics when he studied it , switched to economics , came back 3 years later and even went up to phd . 
   become overwhelmed by how difficult it is . 
  everything you study is in one way or another difficult . 
  and in every subject you will have topics that interest you a little bit more and topics that will interest you a little bit less . 
  overall studying physics is very fun from my perspective and it tends to give you an insight on how the world works . 
  shactac are not the only people who play multiplayer with lots of people ... 
  this is a brilliant idea and i know tons of arma enthusiasts who 'd love this . 
   so all units have the same modpack . 
  when you do that please make sure to conduct a survey so the modpack is not bloated . 
  it 's pretty annoying to download 5-6 gigabytes for one session, 
  pretty much , there are other gamemodes implementing a money system that do it way better imho . 
  vegetation and trees generally are easier to handle for the render engine than lots of buildings . 
  a dense forest gives you usually better fps than a dense urban environment . 
  with that being said dx12 which is supposed to come along with the expansion will allegedly alleviating the current bottleneck and bring better performance across the board . 
  in regards to your last question , theoretically it does n't matter how many polygons altis has and if it has more or less than tanoa , because it 's not like your c/gpu loads / renders the entirety of altis . 
  for one you have lods for different objects , and when you are standing on the salt flat , the engine does n't bother with loading , say , kavala . 
  that 's just a bad cpu then , i 'm able to maintain 30-40 fps throughout an online match, 
  the first fury x benchmarks seem sketchy . 
  their 980ti benchmarks for comparison seem considerably higher than they do on other reviewing sites . 
  i 'd wait a couple days until all the big reviewers have voiced their opinion about the card before forming my own . 
  blindly recommending a card without knowing its competitors is bad advice . 
  short answer : yes, 
  long answer : the 3.5 gb issue is not noticeable when playing at 1080p . 
  the card is still an amazing piece of hardware and gets you the most bang for your buck in the current market . 
  with that being said if you intent to play at a resolution more than 1080p there are possibly better options for a similar price . 
  you just said you have no experience with amd gfx ( whatever gfx is ) . 
  and without having real data on the fury you do n't know how well it competes against a nvidia card . 
  this is a point most people seem to be missing . 
  there has been no information about the regular fury so far , apart from the lack of a watercooler , which makes it substantially cheaper . 
  all reports saying the fury is a cutdown version of the fury x are rumors at best and nothing is confirmed . 
  solely for the sake of competition i hope that the regular fury can pose some sort of threat . 
  i 'm still on the fence between 980 ti and fury , and until the latter is out and benchmarked i do n't want to make a decision . 
   the price may change but i doubt by much . 
  the fury is a hundred dollars cheaper than the x which is a lot for a few people . 
  debatable how hot it will get without a water cooling block , we do n't know anything about the card but it 's pricetag which was mentioned by lisa su during the press conference . 
   it might have lower clocks, 
  ftfy . 
  nothing confirmed by now . 
  there is . 
  it 's called the fury , costs 550 usd and will launch mid july . 
  we do n't know anything about it , other than it is called the fury and has an air cooler . 
  everyone saying its a cutdown version , it has a lower clockspeed or as a matter of fact any word about its performance is basically making assumptions based on nothing . 
  the benchmarks that amd released seemed to good to be true to begin with . 
  however i think a nda until release is industry standard . 
  i do n't recall there being any 980ti reviews before it was released . 
  the only reason the community really felt the nda was because amd built up a huge hype at e3 and then left everyone waiting . 
  brilliant marketing if the card would have lived up to its promises , however now , not so much . 
  well they ca n't really announce a card and tell everyone how shit it is , can they ? 
  it 's not exactly a bad card either , it just does n't leap in front of the titan x as we thought it would . 
  at the end of the day no company is really ethical , they are companies trying to make money . 
  however if you compare the current situation between nvidia and amd then amd does look more ethical . 
  it 's one of the reasons why i would want to switch to team red . 
  i 'm all for competition , but flat out sabotage helps no one . 
  there is currently no standalone mod to create an automated aar ( after action report ) . 
  every now and then i see screenshots of some floating around , vbs has such a feature for sure and i think alive supports something along the lines of it ( take that with a grain of salt ) . 
  but that 's about it . 
  the disappointment comes from the promises . 
  when the card was announced at e3 lisa su said it would be the fastest gpu in the world . 
  a few days later first benchmarks from amd were released showing absolutely stunning numbers . 
  first rumors came up that the fury x was a titan x competitor and the fury a 980ti competitor . 
  at one point it was even rumored the card leaps in front the titan x. 
  when it was first released numbers showed that it stayed well below the titan x and can barely beat the 980ti . 
  the tl ; dr version of the whole situation is : massive hype train crashed , expectations were higher than the results . 
  amds next hope is the fury , since there is no information about it we do n't know what it 's like . 
  however if it represents the same specs as the fury x , just minus the water cooling unit then we 're in for a good surprise . 
  it would undercut the 980ti by 100 $ while performing in a similar range and allowing aftermarket coolers , which the fury x does not . 
  there 's quite a few people ( like me ) still on the fence . 
  the fury is still able to pose a threat to nvidia , given that it 's not a cutdown fury x. 
  at that price point it is very competitive , i could see people choosing the standard fury over the 980ti , when they both hit in a similar performance range .
