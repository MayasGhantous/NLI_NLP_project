  you are an idiot . 
  the 6350 was released in 2012 while the i5 4690k was released just last year . 
  additionally while amds ipc is not as fast as intel 's , when it comes to multicore utilization amd fx series are still on par with its competitors . 
  the thread title should have been `` an older amd cpu is not as fast as a newer intel cpu in arma 3 '' but you have n't really made any groundbreaking discoveries with that , that 's something we all knew . 
  edit :, 
   you would think the 6 cores with higher clock speeds would be better , but because the i5 has more cache ( i think ) it did better !, 
  that shows you have very little understanding of how a cpu works, 
  take what for granted ? 
  that blowing hot air into a box makes the inside of said box warm ? 
  if anything i 'd like / r/amd to redirect to this sub . 
   is it possible to add this/spawn it into a singleplayer mission ? 
  add ? 
  yes . 
  spawn ? 
  no ( t unless you have a spawn script in said mission ) . 
   if so , what do i need to write in the console to get it ? 
  there is no console command for you to do that however what you can do is de-pbo the mission and open it in the editor ( tutorials on how to do this should be easily found on google ) . 
  then alter the mission as you like ( put the plane down where you want it ) and repack the mission . 
  if the mission supports some sort of spawning script already , then it might autodetect any mods you are using . 
  it 's easier to just find missions that use your mod already tbh . 
  i built myself my first rig more or less exactly two years ago , running a fx8350 and gtx 660ti , while solid components two years ago they do n't really impress anyone anymore . 
  i am happy with my cpu , and i 'd like to keep it until zen is around . 
  for my gpu i want to switch to amd , i 'm thinking 390 ( x ) or fury , that depends on my patience for saving up money and if one of the cards go on sale somewhere . 
  yes . 
  you should watch [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ckzijw6pk ) it explains why the 390 is more than just a 290 with a new name . 
  i agree with you on the cpu part . 
  as i said in this thread i am not exactly disappointed with my 8350 , especially with it 's age , but if amd does n't step up their game with zen i may switch over to intel for my next cpu upgrade . 
  is n't the 980ti struggling at 4k as well ? 
  i recall seeing something like that in the benchmarks fury x vs 980ti but i 'm not too sure . 
  either way the fury series was a slight disappointment so far . 
  before launch it was rumoured the fury x could take a titan x by being half the price and the fury beating the 980ti while being 100 dollars cheaper . 
  imho none of the new amd lineups are bad cards per se , they just did n't deliver the blow that was needed to bring them aggressively back into the market . 
  though i would like to know if the steam survey will look any different gpu wise in the next few years . 
  slightly ot but mind sharing what monitor you use ? 
  i 'd like to get into 1440p or 4k as well , depending on the price and all 4k monitors i 've found so far are rather price-y, 
  and the second one is thenewboston , i do n't think this site is a collection of the best tutorials , it 's just ** a ** collection of tutorials with no real emphasis on quality . 
  that is not entirely true . 
  he earns most of his criticism by glossing over the importance of certain features of a language . 
  additionally he gives arbitrary names to his classes in his java tutorial ( for example ) , making it look it does n't matter what you name your class . 
  he does n't teach he just shows what a language looks like , but by doing so he gives a really bad perception of how a language actually works . 
  good c++ tutorials are rare , good online tutorials basically non existent . 
  not necessarily . 
  a driver is needed to run a piece of hardware while physx is not necessarily needed to have nice physics in your game . 
  imagine it like this : you want to make a game that supports lots of physical simulations . 
  you basically have two approaches , number one is to write your own physics engine for your game . 
  while possible it is a tedious and very costly task for a game developer plus you 'd need to start from scratch . 
  your second option is to buy an api ( basically a software library ) from someone who has already written a physics engine . 
  the pros of the second option are easily visible : it costs less money than making your own and the engine you are buying has years and years of experience and development on it 's back . 
  it 's a quicker approach to get nice-r physics into your game without wasting your own resources on a possibly inferior product . 
  i was told their is no conclusive evidence that nvidia sabotaged their own cards , do you have any links you could refer me to ? 
  edit : ask for evidence to the claims one makes and get downvoted . 
  these specific amd chips were released in 2012 , obviously a newer product will perform better . 
  with that being said imho it 's a great cpu and i never bumped into any issues with it . 
  this would never happen . 
  for one neither intel nor nvidia want to hold a monopoly over their respective markets , it would be bad for both of them . 
  secondly it would be bad for us , the customers . 
  no more competition means lower quality products . 
  while amds gpus certainly did n't blow nvidia out of the water it surely kept them on their toes . 
   does tressfx just simply ` work ' whereas hairworks was only invented to cripple amd systems ? 
  well , no . 
  i 'm going off stuff i read on a few different subreddits so take my statement with my grain of salt . 
  as far as i know amd is not shifty about tressfx , they do n't mind sharing the source code with other developers of game studios and even nvidia so that devs can utilize tressfx to it 's full potential and nvidia is given the chance to optimize their own drivers so tressfx works on their cards as well . 
  nvidia on the other side is playing the game a little differently . 
  i was told they ship gameworks ( which includes hairworks ) as compiled libraries only to game developers . 
  meaning the game developer can not look into gameworks to see how it internally works , he only can use the tools of it and nvidia does not share their source code with amd at all , meaning amd can not optimize their own drivers to gameworks titles . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uod8ykwtww ) is an interview with richard huddy from amd who gives an insight on this issue . 
  relevant part starts somewhere around the 21 minute mark . 
  keep in mind that this is only one side of the story coming from an amd rep though i do n't think huddy is a shady guy . 
  if you google around a bit you 'll find that nvidia has responded to forbes about some of the statements amd made , you can read it [ here ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2014/05/28/nvidia-fires-back-the-truth-about-gameworks-amd-optimization-and-watch-dogs/ ) . 
  make of that what you will , it 's two heavy competitors that wo n't give each other a single inch . 
  one good card will always be a better choice than two mediocre cards , that goes for nvidia and amd . 
  simply because most games wo n't utilize sli / crossfire to its full potential . 
  basically the same reason why some games are able to use multiple cpu cores and other games only use one core . 
  it has to be optimized for crossfire/sli . 
  it 's not laziness there are a lot of factors you need to take account into . 
  such as do we have the funds to make our game compatible with crossfire ? 
  is our target audience expected to run two or more gpus , etc. 
  there is a difference between creating content and making changes to the game engine . 
  the latter is a very costly and time intensive process . 
   nvidia still needs to sell gpus and the market has a tolerance threshold on pricing . 
  correct but if amd gpus would leave the scene nvidia has no pressure of getting quality products on the market at a certain price point . 
  surely old cards would probably fall a little in price but they would be replaced by equally priced , similarly performing chips . 
  if the competition is gone they have no need to invest their wealth into r&d, 
  i will hijack this and ask : i 'm getting my 390 on monday , would i be able to get a 390x down the road and cf them to get similar results ? 
  if you get an amd card now you will be fine . 
  the company is stable until at least 2018 . 
  i was on the verge between 390 and 970 and i 'm buying my r9 390 on monday , thanks to jayztwocent 's review on specifically these gpus . 
  the 390 with its 8 gigs of vram and massive room to overclock is pretty future proof for the next few years . 
  this is borderline recruiting . 
  if this is true to the degree i hope this is true this might mean amd can regain some of the marketshare they lost to nvidia . 
  for german speaking arma players i highly recommend jeremiarose . 
  he does grade a tutorials , gives nice insight about a various related topics and he seems like a funny guy . 
  after doing `` bcdboot c : \\ windows / s c : '' ( without quotation marks ) and restarting my pc without the ssd i get an error in grub `` no such device '', 
  i am not entirely sure where grub is installed , but i believe its on the 60gb . 
  in my bios my 1tb is the first in boot priority . 
  they are not in serious trouble right now , and they 've proven they are still a threat to their competitors when they stomped out the new r9 series but as it 's been already pointed out they need to step up their game even further . 
  zen and hbm2 need to be even more of a danger to their rivals than the fury x was , ** then ** they have a solid chance of getting their foot back into the door imho . 
  try hardwarecanucks and teksyndicate . 
  they are sold a lot but amd has a lot of debt and one product line wo n't bump them out of their issues . 
  regaining your financial strength is a process that takes years .
