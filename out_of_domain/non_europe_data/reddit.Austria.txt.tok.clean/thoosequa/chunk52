  generally all cardiovascular exercise will improve your blood pressure heart rate in the long run . 
  with that being said if you 're heavily overweight you could a ) damage your joints and b ) as you said damage your internals by various means . 
  if you 're obese please consult a doctor before exercising . 
  same goes if you 're a heavy smoker for x years . 
  if you do n't want to pack any extra weight hit your calorie goal and call it a day . 
  if you do n't mind a couple pounds extra for strength then overshoot ( by a reasonable amount ), 
   music is mainly something to shut out the godawful things playing on gym speakers . 
  so my gym is not the only one out there . 
  nothing like preparing yourself mentally for a heavy when adele comes on and wines through the gym . 
  whoever picks these has never worked out . 
  personally i put on knife party , disturbed or anything really that pumps me up . 
  after 8 years of smoking there i do n't see why you would n't check up with your doc for a couple cardiovascular and lung volume tests . 
  depends your gym . 
  if you have an area for deadlifts only then there . 
  if you do n't then go to the squat rack . 
  if your gym does n't have squad rack find a new gym . 
  learn to ignore the taste otherwise you 're fucked . 
  general rule when buying new supplements : by the smallest possible container of that supplement . 
  see if it 's good , if it is you can buy a bigger one next time . 
  if you have friends you lift you could try to gift or sell the whey to someone . 
  this is hard to say without knowing ops lungs . 
  if they 're in a particularly bad shape it could cause a chain reaction resulting in some very nasty medical conditions . 
  should always check in with a doc first if you 're unsure, 
  could you be allergic to one one of the ingredients ? 
  there is also rice based whey and other vegetarian / vegan protein powders , have you tried those ? 
  that 's up to you . 
  if the stomach pain is unbearable then ditch it . 
  if if it is n't and the whey is your only way to hit your protein goal continue taking it, 
  fuck those scales , they are super inaccurate . 
  get a caliper off amazon , they are rather cheap and are imho more accurate . 
  i have the same cpu and i get at least 45 in singleplayer and around 35 in multiplayer , what settings are you on ? 
  knock it back to high , that will give you a ever so slight fps increase . 
  also view distance is not the crux , i have that at 3k , its the object render distance that can cripple your fps so i leave that at roughly 2k, 
  you might as well ask `` what is the best car i can buy '' . 
  different tools for different jobs . 
  go to / r/fitness and check out their wiki . 
  it should provide you with a solid base on how to move forward . 
  never went to / fit / 4chan is n't really my go to for anything, 
  unfortunately most workout related threads will be downvoted and were removed up to a couple weeks ago by the mods , were n't they ? 
  i find it ironic how / r/bb looks down on fitness but do n't allow the content that is posted there , here . 
  thus making / r/fitness the only high profile sub where people can get feedback on their workouts, 
  the clockrate of a cpu is generally no good when comparing different cpus of different architectures and different times . 
  now if you only look at the fx cpu series then you can compare their clockrates , because they all have the same or a very similar instruction per cycle ( ipc ) count . 
  this is the number of work instructions a cpu can do within one clock cycle ( 1 hertz ) . 
  intel cpus may have a lower clock rate but a higher ipc , which means in the same amount of time they can do more workload than an amd fx cpu . 
  throwing more cores at the problem does n't help much for applications that were coded primarily to work on a single core . 
  to add what / u/dr _ ravenshoe said : also ipc . 
  thats the amount of instructions ( such as arithmetic instructions ) a cpu can do within one hertz / one cycle . 
   having an fx 8350 with 8 cores/8threads with 4.0 ghz clock speeds on this would be awesome , yes ? 
  but it is not , it 's marketing for dummies . 
  not really true when you look at the job the cpu has to do . 
  for gaming it 's not ideal but when fast calculations are not a factor and the application running relies heavily on multithreading fx cpus are a solid and cheap base . 
  assume two cpus , both operate at 1 ghz . 
  cpu a has an ipc of 10 , the other , cpu b , an ipc of 5 . 
  the reason why a is faster at b at the same clock rate is because of the higher ipc of a. 
  your statement makes no sense . 
  the ** reason ** why one is faster than the other because of different ** measurements **, 
  this is true , but ipc is still a valid measurement for comparing two cpu architectures . 
  what else would we use to ** compare cpus ** other than ** measurements of performance **, 
  almost ? 
  * literally !, 
  fruit . 
  if they would work , you would n't notice anything four days in . 
  spend your money on creatine next time , but do n't expect anything different after 4 days , same goes for eating at a surplus or a deficit . 
  fitness is a slow process and to notice any effect of something you need to keep going at the very least 4 weeks . 
  the only exception being pre workout boosters , they kick 30 minutes after taking them . 
  correct me if i am wrong but afaik crackers consist of lots of carbs , fats and are high in sodium , whereas an apple is basically nothing but water and carbs , making it ultimately `` better '' calories than a pack of crackers . 
  welches semester ? 
  i am using a heat sink on my pi 1 . 
  i overclocked it to the highest setting and the heatsink actually does make a small difference , roughly 5 degrees celsius , give or take a few degrees . 
  of course it would n't burn down if i would n't use a heat sink , but since i have one i thought i might as well . 
  make sure bcombat does n't cause any issues . 
  the campaign relies partially on ai triggers . 
  while i have n't tested it myself they might not work reliably when using an ai enhancement mod . 
  i would n't go past dragonfyre and blastcore . 
  well then you 're good to go . 
  i did n't use any mods and thought the campaign was amazing , though it can be a bit tricky . 
  regarding 2. : i 've had a similar issue . 
  i have a huge pc that is nowhere near my tv . 
  so whenever i want to watch netflix i was bound to use my desktop . 
  however with the pi i found a nifty little solution that works quite well . 
  i downloaded and installed obs on my desktop . 
  i basically stream everything ( sound and video ) from the pc to the pi . 
  it 's not ideal for gaming , since there is a roughly 1 second delay to it , but works fine for watching movies . 
  kinda hack-ish but works very well . 
  here 's a link to a setup guide, 
  i had them on back day , but generally you can do them on both days . 
  sl 5x5 for example has a day on which you squat and deadlift , just make sure that you do n't do deadlifts right after squats and vice versa . 
  ideally you could use your leg day deadlifts with lighter weight to work on your form . 
  because bug - and feedbacktrackers are exclusive to amd and no other company has done this . 
  nope . 
  as long as you feel comfortable with it, 
  i 've met two schools of thought on this one . 
  the first one is the machine now and free weights later approach . 
  the basic idea is that you want to build yourself a foundation of strength and a basic idea of the movements so you do n't injure yourself at the gym . 
  the other is the straight to the free weights approach . 
  the idea being that you do n't want to waste your time with machines , because no matter how good you are at chest press , your first real bench press will suck , because you lack the coordination in your body to perform it properly . 
  at the end of the day both approaches have their pros and cons and ultimately what you do is no one else 's but your decision . 
  either way , if you have never been at the gym before i highly highly recommend to spend some money on one or two 1on1 sessions with a personal trainer or ask the staff at your gym . 
   how do you start ?
