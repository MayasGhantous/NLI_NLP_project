  i mean at the end of the day it boils down either paying ubisoft 5 bucks for some extra hair on the left testicle of altair or you pay a 12 year old minecraft server owner for a diamond sword . 
  just because you stop giving money to one company doesnt change the problem throughout the industry . 
  so you 're either pirating your games which means you can gtfo anyway or you have n't bought a single game in the past two years . 
  some arma 3 servers called arma 3 life are pulling off this huge project thats more than just a mission but a couple mods linked to it , with a seperate alpha and beta stage etc etc. 
  long story short these people use / alter / monetize mods of other people without their consent , as a matter of fact a lot of mod makers who 's stuff was `` stolen '' have already requested this server to be taken down . 
  additionally they ( used to ) sell beta access to their server as well as ingame items which is against bi eula . 
   you 're pirating which means you can get the fuck out, 
  weak argument if you think about it, 
  i agree with you , thats the reason why i dont buy day 1 dlc and i tend to avoid ubisoft games . 
  but not buying them is one thing , while pirating is a whole new one . 
  if you do n't agree with a companies stance on something do n't get their product . 
  do n't buy it and do n't grant yourself access via illegal means . 
  there * was * a fairly good coop mission designed for something between 40 and 60 people back in arma 2 . 
  nothing so far for arma 3 , but then again a lot of good stuff slips under my radar when its on the steam workshop . 
  scripts have to be implemented into the mission when making it , depending on the type of script there are different ways of implementing it . 
  to do that correctly refer to the corresponding armaholic page or bohemia interactive forum thread . 
  i have no experience with alive but generally speaking no . 
  to implement a script you would at least pack it together with the mission and load it in manually . 
  mcc sounds like the way to go for you . 
  it 's compatible with most common mods . 
  has a ton stock scripts and even a random mission generator button . 
  stupid question incoming : can i `` upgrade '' my visual studio express or do i need to delete my current version and download the community one ? 
  this . 
  also you are not allowed to modify arma 3 stock content , only create your own . 
  i agree the heli dlc was a bit price-y for two choppers , with that being said you do n't consider that we also got firing from vehicles and slingloading . 
  with the stance bi has on dlc , namely everyone can play just those who bought it get certain priviliges , is extremely consumer friendly and possible one of the most consumer friendly points of view that we see throughout the industry, 
  imho release went pretty smooth . 
  it was known from day 1 in alpha that bi would support and develop the game over the next years . 
  you get the password from the server owner . 
  most password protected servers are dedicated clan servers from units which they use for their private sessions . 
  to me it sounds like your issue lies within you having mods enabled which the server doesnt allow, 
  while we are at it , i found the price of the pi misleading in general . 
  given that you dont have any extra components you need to buy at ** least ** a sd card , if your computer cant read sd cards a sd card reader , a ethernet cable and a power supply . 
  and there we just have the base stuff . 
  want to use it on your tv ? 
  you need an extra mouse and keyboard + hdmi cable . 
  want to do some experimental stuff ? 
  breadboard , leds and resistors as well as some buttons . 
  so far i 've spent over 100 bucks on the pi , not including the pi camera i bought . 
  what other reason would it be to encrypt their files ? 
  i 'm gon na be frank , i thought `` just '' two helos was a bit cheap , but then again i bought the whole dlc bundle right away as soon as it was available , so to me it was more about supporting bi and less about getting more content . 
  i for example had no mobile phone charger compatible with the pi `` lying around '' . 
  same goes for the sd card and since my pc does n't support sd cards i had to get a card reader as well . 
  reskinning is one thing , because it is supported , but i am pretty sure you would violate bi eula if you go on and take for example the hunter mrap files and alter it . 
  that 's also why every modder was happy that bi allowed a2 content to be altered , after a3 went full release . 
  they released the base models themselves, 
  i did not know that , thanks for clearing this up !, 
  this is not / r/findaunit take your recruiting somewhere , where it is welcomed . 
  does the game crash when you launch the mission in the mission select screen or does it crash when you set up the server ? 
  have your verified your game files ? 
  can someone eli5 what i am looking at here ? 
  edit : i know what a memory leak is but i mean specifically this picture, 
  how do you know it 's using these 2gb ? 
  it might as well just have it reserved by the operating system and allocate it internally . 
  adn i 'm sitting here with my windows 7 , no wonder i did n't see what that is, 
  to follow up with what / u/klabbarparn said : over and out have contradictory meanings . 
  * out : i have finished my transmission and no reply is needed . 
  * over : i have finished my transmission and i need a reply from you . 
  usually the station that opens the radio call will also be the one to call out . 
  hence why i said `` usually '' . 
  in casual groups that are not focused on hard core milsim i think it does n't matter that much . 
  eutw are imho the best cti servers . 
  30vs30 tvt , can be a blast if you have a team that does n't act shit, 
  if its the server of a group , i would contact the owner of said group ( or the hq in milsim units ) directly via their forums . 
  it will not only benefit you , but also the unit and other future players who wish to play on said server . 
  if its a private server than people will stop coming eventually if its a shit server . 
  i do n't see the point in publicly shaming ( possibly good ) servers because of one crap admin . 
  beefy cpu * and by that i mean high clock speed and not a lot of cores . 
  for finding a group that suits your needs the most i suggest the arma grouplisting on the sidebar or you can specifically make a post that you try to find a group at / r/findaunit i personally would n't ask here for groups as it will tempt some users to promote their own groups , which is usually percieved as recruiting attempt and as such frowned upon . 
  in terms of repetitive gameplay , i would agree yes arma 2/3 can get repetitive but i think the trick is to always try new things . 
  bored of being a rifleman all the time ? 
  bored of infantry ? 
  hop in a tank . 
  want to see things from above ? 
  hope in an airframe . 
  the game as a lot to offer , seize the chance, 
  i would n't have my money on arma 3 life videos getting too much love here . 
  at least it was to my understanding that the arma 3 life servers are currently the target of some pretty hefty accusations in regards to stealing content and violating bi eula, 
  fair enough , props for being a good sport , have an upvote, 
  as usual formatted version for reddit because op is lazy as fuck, 
  ** from : ** project lead, 
  ** to : ** arma 3 users, 
  ** info : ** update 1.36 plans , dev hub feeds, 
  ** precedence : ** flash, 
  ** situation **, 
  our sights are still trained on marksmen dlc production . 
  more weapons are progressing from wishlist entry to design analysis to concept art to 3d mesh . 
  the first of them have entered the final artwork stages of texturing . 
  after that they are handed off to animators to deal with holding and reloading them . 
  but the dlc and its platform update are still a few months away , so let 's take a look at something coming up sooner . 
  update 1.36 is slated for the beginning of december . 
  while it 's a maintenance update , there are some cool things we 're hoping to include ( depending on testing ! ) . 
  tests of recent * server-side multiplayer optimizations * are [ looking promising ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/arma/comments/2man1j/join_chimera_test_servers_engine_serverside/ ) . 
  optimizations of the file system will soon be deployed to [ dev-branch ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/dev-branch ) and can help with the start-up of the game for example . 
  then there 's an important update to the launcher , adding support for * local non * - [ workshop ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/107410/workshop/ ) * mods * . 
  another launcher-related improvement to enter testing soon is an improved battleye anti-cheat solution . 
  it should be more effective at keeping undesired behavior at bay in multiplayer servers . 
  ** intelligence **, 
  some of you requested a rss ** feed ** for the [ dev hub ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/ ) ( the place you are most likely reading this ) . 
  web developer jervant malakjan has delivered and he 's thrown in two other types of feeds .
