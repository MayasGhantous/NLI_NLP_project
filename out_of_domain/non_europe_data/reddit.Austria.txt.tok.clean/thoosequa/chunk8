  the [ rss ] ( http://arma3.com/loaddev?feed=rss ) and [ atom ] ( feed : / / arma3.com / loaddev?feed = atom ) feeds are quite standard and can be used by various readers . 
  the [ json ] ( http://arma3.com/loaddev?count=2&amp;type=sitrep ) feed is actually used by the game 's launcher , and can be queried using a few parameters .

  the configuration of * vortex ring state * simulation in the advanced flight model for helicopters is going well . 
  we believe it 's ready to include in * update 1.36 * , so start re-thinking your ` collective down full ' straight descents . 
  it 's also going to be possible to determine the use of afm on a server-level . 
  the priority of afm configuration will be : [ server.cfg ] ( https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/server.cfg )  [ description.ext ] ( https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/description.ext ) ( scenario )  options . 
  the parameter is forcerotorlibsimulation ( 0 - options , 1 - forced on , 2 - forced off ) . 
  ** logistics **, 
  we were sent a nice and simple web tool which lets you quickly [ create and host an arma squad xml ] ( https://armasquads.com/ ) . 
  these are the files that let you configure a squad / clan for multiplayer . 
  the most visible result of using such xml is the squad emblem on vehicles ( and above groups in zeus ) . 
  thanks to [ marco rieger ] ( https://twitter.com/a1mie ) for this unofficial service !, 
  this kind of information is more likely to be found in the spotreps or techrep, 
  needs more upvotes . 
  if your goal is ultimately to learn c++ then start with c++ . 
  the mx is basically a slightly altered bushmaster acr . 
  so basically the mohawk ? 
  disagree here . 
  if your goal is to learn c++ then start with c++ . 
  this is recommended by the / r/learnprogramming faq and stoustroup himself . 
  i started with java on my own and i am now leaning c++ in uni . 
  it 's hard but not impossible with the right amount of effort . 
  arma 3 only uses one of your cpu codes and barely uses your gpu , as such there is no fix . 
  but the issue is well known and bi is constantly trying to fix it, 
  i have an amd and i 'm getting solid 40-50 in sp and mp , any explanation ? 
  at first glance it looks a lot like recruiting , so that could be a reason for the downvotes . 
  on top of that it 's kind of derailing the thread . 
  if op is trying to find a server he can make a new thread , which others who also might want to find servers can then find . 
  a `` what is a good server '' discussion has no place in a `` help me game is broken '' thread, 
  did run arma 2 standalone before you launched oa ? 
  because if not that might be the issue . 
  try to verify all your game files , if that does n't help delete everything , download arma 2 , launch it , download oa , launch it and you should he good from there, 
  did you fix your problem then ? 
  i havent had any special desync issues since the last patch , but they are mentioning their work on fixing the mp issues right in the first paragraph, 
  also thank bohemia for providing the community with the right tools and resources to make this happen . 
  this is not industry standard and we should n't take it for granted, 
  short answer : yes . 
  i experienced more than 50 fps if you take all your settings down a notch . 
  i prefer playing on ultra with 30 fps though , rather than on normal with 50-60, 
  ** evolution **, 
  it 's been about four months since our advanced flight model took off . 
  after some initial resonance - and lifted by the upstream of your feedback - we 've reached a stable level flight . 
  pilots have survived , adapted and now it 's time to ... well , adapt again ( i 'll explain why later on ) !, 
  with the release of some significant new features with [ update 1.36 ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/post/spotrep-00037 ) , we 'd thought it was high time to share some more information . 
  ** buckle up !, 
  so , standard or advanced ? 
  does it offer anything more than ground collisions , blade strikes , instability , and an even greater chance of rotor-based disaster ? 
  i bet my buttons it does . 
  after some initial sniffing and swearing , you 'll quickly get the grasp . 
  constant anticipation , adjustments , one control axis having an impact on others - it will all get under your skin . 
  as a reward , the advanced flight model offers you a completely different level of agility and response . 
  rapid insertions , tricky maneuvers , aerobatics , autorotations - all of that is now waiting to be mastered . 
  moreover , it 's a new level of helicopter gameplay . 
  you 'll have to think strategically . 
  manage your load carefully . 
  different rotor configurations behave differently ; each crew member , each rocket in the pod , each liter of jet fuel now plays a role . 
  wan na haul some extra fuel and ammo ? 
  being greedy wo n't help if you do n't have enough power to lift off ( or after you 've picked up your comrades in an evac ) !, 
  but that 's just a taster or the new gameplay - the best thing to do is to get in game ... and play !, 
  however , if you 're interested in discovering a bit more about our development , read on . 
  behind our advanced helicopter fm dwells something called rotorlib : a 3rd-party simulation library from our partners at [ real time dynamics ] ( http://www.rtdynamics.com/ ) . 
  this implements a generic mathematical model , which takes care of all the precise simulation of a helicopter ( rotors , fuselage , wing surfaces , weight , etc ) . 
  this fm has a variety of detailed parameters to simulate specific types of helicopters . 
  together with a professional aircraft designer , etienne vandame , these properties were configured by our team ( even simulating aerodynamic forces for those helicopters with no real-life equivalent , using aircraft design software ) . 
  but simulated data alone is n't enough . 
  we pushed hard to offer up our helicopters for your feedback as soon as they were able to fly , and you 've given us a terrific response !, 
  some of you were able to take us into great detail and even gave us professional insights . 
  admittedly , we were not always able to keep up . 
  still , we 're enormously grateful for your feedback , and we hope the changes we were able to introduce indicate how valuable our cooperation has been . 
  with that in mind , let 's take a look at some of the improvements !, 
  ** simulation , we has it **, 
  first of all , rotorlib itself . 
  during the dev-branching phase - and alongside numerous smaller ones - we received two major updates of the libraries from our partners . 
  minor tweaks enabled us to , for example , create a savegame with a rlib simulated helicopter . 
  the first major update was about [ general fidelity and performance ] ( http://blog.rtdynamics.com/?p=173 ) . 
  the second brought a simulation retouch to incorporate vortex ring state ( vrs ) . 
  of course , many of us have been pushing for it since back in [ take on helicopters ] ( http://helicopters.takeonthegame.com/ ) ; so , let 's take a look at where we 're at now . 
  vrs simulation required a re-adjustment of our helicopters ' configuration . 
  we had to proceed carefully and enabled the technology in the [ dev-branch ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/ ) only . 
  that gave as a chance to tune vrs from being quite literally a ` killer feature ' into a more realistic and playable piece of the flight model jigsaw . 
  now it 's unleashed for all !, 
  at first - despite of what we 've said about the fm offering a more ` natural ' sense of handling - vrs may be a condition that does n't come across so intuitively !, 
  watch out for your descent rates , keep calm , and go easy on your collective . 
  ultimately , enjoy & adapt ! \u2122, 
  ** feedback , we jump in it **, 
  our resident rotorhead , producer [ luk\u00e1\u0161 mil\u00e1\u010dek ] ( http://dev.arma3.com/display/~lukas ) , has been closely watching and moderating our [ advanced helicopter fdm feedback ] ( http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?181550-advanced-helicopter-fdm-feedback ) forums thread , turning it all into real action . 
  in cooperation with etienne , we 've been constantly tweaking the helicopters ' configuration . 
  the blackfoot was tamed and does n't go runaway in higher speeds . 
  the xh-9 family helicopters have turned into great fun machines . 
  the list of tweaks goes on and on , while other elements were added as completely new features . 
  rotors , for example , can now be destroyed by a collision or by felix baumgarten-sized g-force stresses . 
  we 've also added / tuned visual feedback for ground effect , vrs and for reaching / exceeding the limits of the airframe . 
  our audio department , too , went rotor-loco , improving helicopter sounds with fresh field recordings and some new sound features ( which they seem eager to share more details about it in a future oprep ) . 
  vehicle ui now has improved clarity and helmet mounted displays received some tlc , too . 
  many of these features can also be enjoyed with standard fm . 
  ** thank you for flying with bohemia rotoractive **,
