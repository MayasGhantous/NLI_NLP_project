  however it seems that for using a multidimensional array a different syntax is used . 
  suddenly you need a pointer to a pointer and on google i have at least found 4 different methods of initializing dynamic 2d arrays and some of them seem really confusing . 
  i have also seen this syntax a lot :, 
  int ** ary = new int * [ a ] ;, 
  as well as :, 
  int ** ary = new int * [ a ] ;, 
  is there any difference between those two ? 
  thank you for your help !, 
  i am studying computer sciene at uni level , first semester . 
  we have a class that focuses solely on learning c++ called introduction to programming . 
  now i have some sort of java background so syntax and basic concepts of programming are no stranger to me , but 4-5 weeks into class i have noticed that the difficulty of certain tasks is not bearable for me . 
  for example , i know how to solve a task on a piece of paper but when it comes to writing code there is always a certain point which i can not progress any further . 
  the `` literature '' we have is just a set of 600 power point slides that are held in bullet points and are not the most ideal guide to reference to . 
  i have read on multiple sources now that c++ primer 5th edition is supposed to be ** the ** book for every c++ beginner , now my question is : is it worth for me investing into the book or is the stuff we do in class already outside of the book 's scope . 
  to give you an idea what we have done in the past 4-5 weeks and what 's still left for class, 
  * variables , operators , statements, 
  * arrays , pointers and dynamic memory, 
  * exceptions, 
  * functions with parameters, 
  next up will be, 
  * introduction to classes, 
  * overloading, 
  * recursion , data structures , trees and lists, 
  * a couple more that i find hard to translate into english ( germanspeaking here ), 
  any advice is appreciated , including possible other books that would be better to reference to . 
  thank you !, 
  hello all !, 
  i 'm finishing my first c++ course very soon and i 'd like to keep on going with the language . 
  in class we have covered the most basics , such as pointers , arrays , classes , constructors , overloading etc. 
  so i 'm able to create basic programs in console . 
  so my question is , what 's next ? 
  should i jump to guis right away or shall i stay in my `` comfortable '' environment and get more experience under the hood ? 
  i 've recently left my old group and now i 'm looking to branch out my gaming experiences into new ways . 
  preferably euro time friendly . 
  having just come from a milsim-yessir-group , i 'd like to join a unit now , that shows less enthusiasm about ranks and imposting the military and is more about the community and it 's values . 
  with all that being said i am most importantly looking to join a group that has some numbers to show off . 
  getting the real kick out of a3 imho only really works with 40 other people on the server and in the mission . 
  the more the merrier , i 'm looking forward to all advices , thank you !, 
  hello all ,, 
  i am currently working on a c++ assignment for my course in which i need to write a program which can be used for statistical acquisition of data about a static amount of people . 
  the precise wording of the assignment is `` create two classes ` person ' and ` list ' . 
  the ` person class ' stores height , weight , iq and age of the inputs . 
  that 's pretty straight forward and i think i got that down to the extent were i can input all kinds of people , do all kinds of calculations with their data and print them out again . 
  my problem lies within creating the ` list ' class . 
  what exactly does it store and what are it 's variables ? 
  the list class shall be the one that holds all person inputs but how exactly do i create a person object inside the list class ? 
  i was thinking of an array , but i am not entirely sure what kind of array i should make . 
  looking forward for any help !, 
  i 've used my macbook pro ever since i bought it almost 4 years ago on and off without any issues . 
  over the last month however i noticed every now and then it would immensely decrease it 's performance up to the point where only a restart would fix the issue . 
  i 've not been bothered by it , as i blamed the age as the source of the issue . 
  however last week when i was browsing the internet , it again started to stutter and freeze . 
  as normal i just pressed the power button until it shut down and pressed it again after a few seconds to start it again . 
  but this time it just booted up with a white screen and after a few minutes it displayed me a blinking gray directory symbol , which carried a question mark in the middle [ click for picture ] ( https://discussions.apple.com/___sbsstatic___/migration-images/176/17626911-1.jpg ) . 
  i 've tried to go into the startup manager to repair the hdd but the field for repair was greyed out . 
  when i wanted to reinstall the os it did n't give me my any options to where i could install it to . 
  i 've also noticed that sometimes my hard drive would n't even show up in the start up manager . 
  my girlfriend noticed that if you give the macbook a little nudge it tells you to restart as an error occurred which cant be resolved . 
  i have my money on either hdd being broken or the cable / contacts between hdd and mainboard . 
  my question now though is : can i check which part is specifically broken ? 
  i 'd rather not want to buy both parts if only one needs to be replaced . 
  or could i be wrong and it 's a more serious issue ? 
  because if anything i would rather like to buy a new macbook pro than invest money on the current one when it breaks again in 6 months . 
  hallo !, 
  hello all ,, 
  i 've just bought new loudspeakers for my computer , my old ones were 5.1 running via an external sound card into a usb port . 
  the ones though run solely on the aux output . 
  so i 've unplugged the old speakers plugged the new ones in but windows does n't show me the device in my sound control panel . 
  i have ticked `` show all disabled devices '' and `` show all deactivated devices '' . 
  when i unplug the aux and plug it back in windows gives me notice that i plugged something in but it does n't let me enable it . 
  worth mentioning : i 'm running the realtek audio hd manager to control my headset , but in the control panel there i also ca n't find an aux source, 
  so i just came back from my second day out with my new ( and first ) telescope i got . 
  it was a rather cold day so after aligning my telescope with the mounted finder and checking out the moon i saw a `` blinking '' star more or less directly south . 
  i wanted to check it out but it was rather dark so i did n't get to see more . 
  after some more sky watching i was about to call it a day when i noticed a really bright star right above me . 
  after pointing aligning my telescope with the bright star about south-east-ish and pointing it about 75 degrees up i was struck . 
  it was a rather large planet like looking thing . 
  i tried to find out what it was but i just ca n't figure it out . 
  it had three small blimps on it 's left side , almost perfectly aligned and one small blimp on the right side . 
  if i had to guess i would say it was a planet with four moons but they were perfectly aligned . 
  does anyone have a clue what i am talking about here ? 
  hello all ,, 
  i 'm in the middle of studying for an maths entry level exam for university . 
  i do have problems to solve given by my professor unfortunately they do n't have any solutions to them though . 
  so what i do is i use wolfram alpha to solve the equations and see if it goes along with my answer . 
  it is the second time now though that i noticed wa amends a suffix to the answer i do n't quite understand . 
  for example here . 
  given is the equation * x - 2e ^ y -1 = 0 * solve after y. i think i have the correct solution which would be, 
  * y = ln ( ( x-1 ) / 2 ) ) * but wa adds + 2 i pi n for n e z. 
  which i do n't quite understand could anyone help me out ? 
  ~ ~ hey all , i am following [ this ] ( http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-a-ball ) tutorial , but i am already stuck . 
  in unit two , where we get the ball rolling ( no pun intended ) i need to create a script . 
  if i follow the tutorial line by line i get an error message in console saying `` rigidbody is deprecated use getcomponent <rigidbody [ ... ] instead '' . 
  so i am using what the console is telling me but when i hit play the ball just wo n't move whatsoever . 
  any help would be appreciated ~ ~, 
  solved , the script was in a folder that was n't found by the object . 
  i 'm having some issues understanding complex numbers . 
  i do know how they work , and how they are formed , but i just do n't get how to calculate ( with ) them . 
  specifically i am struggling to understand the following problem :, 
   find all complex solutions of the equation z \u00b3 = 8,
