  we recognise that everything is n't quite as splendid as it could be . 
  one of the most noted issues - helicopters ' tendency to explode when rolled over to a side - is still a valid problem . 
  it 's not a deliberate design decision . 
  just like you , we despair when a skillful autorotation turns into a mass murder just by a tiny mistake . 
  different concurrent simulations have posed a limitation in collision detections . 
  we are trying to tackle it and our programmers have already gone a couple of extra ( air ) miles . 
  we do n't yet know quite how far there is to go . 
  ongoing issues aside , we hope you 've enjoyed the cooperation as much as we did . 
  and we hope you like the results !, 
  keep the feedback flowing on our [ forums ] ( http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?181550-advanced-helicopter-fdm-feedback ) and [ feedback tracker ] ( http://feedback.arma3.com/search.php?project_id=1&amp;category=rotorlib ) . 
  of course , we 'd like to thank you for supporting our continued development by buying the game and the dlcs . 
  but now let 's not wait anymore . 
  get to the choppa !, 
  spin up the blades . 
  have you already tried the helicopter support mp game mode ? 
  give it a whirl on one of our 4 dedicated official [ servers ] ( http://arma3.com/servers ) . 
  see how all the new platform updates transform into a pure gameplay . 
  or hone and prove your mad skillz by chasing the super rare golden rotorhead [ achievement ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/stats/107410/achievements/ ) . 
  we wish you a pleasant flight !, 
  this is not true and not the reason why this issue exists . 
  see / u/ahcookies post for explanation . 
  has nothing to do with ai, 
  thank you , edited my post . 
  how dare bohemia put out an oprep dedicated to the afm and not mention other features for the future . 
  what do you mean it was not tested on dev ? 
  the vrs and afm were both only available on dev branch for weeks, 
  you did n't get downvoted because you `` stated a fact '' but because you claim it 's an arma problem while it is an overall gaming problem and not unique to the arma series, 
  quote from the top post of this thread, 
   the reason is grounded in performance - to determine the visibility of another object , npcs perform a raycast from their viewpoint to the target . 
  if raycast hits the target , then it 's considered visible , if it hits some obstacle instead , then the target is considered hidden . 
  thing is , you can only raycast against collideable geometry , same geometry used to allow you to walk on stuff , collide with walls and so on . 
  that geometry is by necessity extremely low-detailed and optimized , because the math involved in collision detection is insanely expensive in terms of cpu use and scales up with geometric complexity of involved objects . 
   the issue can not be fixed without significantly raising cpu load with thousands of additional colliders per average outdoor scene . 
  i do n't see it as fixable anytime soon , it 's a problem for every game and engine dealing with similar ai goals . 
  now if you look at the first reply we actually see , that the issue is already fixed and should no longer be an issue . 
  you , sir , are a fucking asshat for your inability to read the whole thread before shitposting . 
  c/c + + on the pi is no different to c/c + + on your normal machine . 
  if i am not mistaking the pi even gets shipped with the gnu c/c + + compiler and as such you can code and compile right away . 
  there are tons of resources out there to learn c ( check / r/learnprogramming ) . 
  if you feel comfortable with the language you can start creating projects for your pi specifically , such as controlling hardware or automating certain processes . 
  have fun and good luck !, 
  everyone gets the mission file . 
  it is stored in your c : \\ users \\ username \\ appdata \\ local \\ arma 3 folder . 
  however i am not sure if it will be as easy as just dropping the . pbo on your machine and run it . 
  i second that . 
  fiddling with python will give you fast results and a sound basic knowledge of how coding works . 
  with that being said , if your ultimate knowledge is to learn c and you are passionate enough about it , go ahead and learn c straight away . 
  the bugs have reduced a lot and i know of any present bugs that the team is not at least working on . 
  every game while experience bugs , and no system is perfect . 
  brings me back to my first post : c on your pi works just like c in your normal environment , with the little exception that your memory is probably smaller . 
  lean how to get around in c before you start worrying about low level coding , a month is not a lot . 
  once you 've got more than the syntax down start working with something like [ wiringpi ] ( https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/ ), 
  from : project lead, 
  to : arma 3 users, 
  info : internal marksmen prototype , update 1.36 released , repception, 
  precedence : flash, 
  ** situation **, 
  as we enter the last month of the year , the team is focused on one more 2014 development milestone : the marksmen dlc sandbox prototype . 
  this means having a final plan for the exact assets and features that we 'll finish during the first quarter of 2015 . 
  said plan is backed up by internally playable prototypes . 
  this could mean the first version of a new weapon 's model , a scripted prototype of a gameplay feature , a proof-of-concept for a scenario , etc. 
  the feasibility studies should wrap up soon and we 'll have go / no-go moments for some of the tech . 
  having a solid sandbox foundation will later help the designers to use it effectively while developing playable content . 
  we are trying hard to get some very cool stuff in the dlc and accompanying platform update , and it 's looking splendid so far !, 
  ** intelligence **, 
  did you miss the exact change log for update 1.36 ? 
  take a look at spotrep # 00037 !, 
  perhaps you 've noticed we delayed the release of the update by a day . 
  in fact , this change of plans was so last-minute we had already begun to release the accompanying arma 3 tools update . 
  the reason for the delay was the discovery ( based on community reports ) that one of the multiplayer server optimizations caused a potential instability . 
  we had tested these multi-threading optimizations on special profiling servers for a few weeks with good results . 
  then we found a thread safety problem in a few freshly submitted crash reports . 
  it was decided to take those optimizations out of 1.36 and continue to develop them via the special profiling branch . 
  certain other optimizations remained in tact , such as tweaks to the file system . 
  there are still 2 recurring crashes that we know about , but can not solve at the moment . 
  one is related to the physx libraries and we hope to address it by an update of the libraries in 2015 . 
  the other occurs also in our other games and we believe it to be connected to steam . 
  we are still working with valve engineers to solve this one . 
  ** operations **, 
  qa specialist ondrej ku\u017eel performed a post-flight inspection of the advanced flight model for rotary-wing aircraft , introduced in helicopters dlc / platform update 1.34 . 
  his report follows an earlier look at the integration of third-party middleware rotorlib to support the afm . 
  it mainly looks back at what we believe was a very productive example of community collaboration . 
  be sure to expand the hidden bonus section dubbed `` oukej 's frequent flyer bonus miles '' for some tips and tricks !, 
  ** logistics **, 
  leading the way for update 1.36 was yet another iteration of the arma 3 tools suite ( available in the steam library for anyone - filter for `` tools '' ) . 
  the tools commissar himself , julien vida , does a good job of providing some context to the changes in his status report : changes to existing tools , a new tool and fresh samples . 
  considering those samples , the previously mentioned psd source template for taru liveries is available on the tools dev-branch . 
  an issue causing suspiciously long packing when using addon builder is being investigated . 
   what can give this impression is that the ai continues to fire at your location once you hide . 
  if it thinks the bullets will penetrate . 
  it estimates your location based on the speed and direction of your movement at the point when you disappeared from the ais line of sight . 
  it wo n't keep firing for more than a couple of seconds ( unless you reappear ) and when doing so it suffers a rather big aiming error for not actually seeing you . 
  but that does n't mean it ca n't kill you . 
  soft covers do n't offer protection . 
  +1 for wind deflection, 
  i do n't think there is a book dedicated to c , as its more an arduino language ( please take this statement with a grain of salt ) . 
  however as i linked , wiringpi offers . 
  c/c + + library to control the gpios and from there you can reproduce everything a python project has to offer simply in c, 
  i 'm exactly in the same boat . 
  no strings no vectors not even cmath .
