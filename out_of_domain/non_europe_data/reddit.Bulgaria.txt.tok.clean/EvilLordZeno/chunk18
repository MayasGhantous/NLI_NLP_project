  my father believes the body to be of russian origin and the mechanisms to be replaced with , supposedly , german ones . 
  authenticity under question . 
  fourth item - another [ german pocket watch ] ( http://imgur.com/a/mgeyv ) . 
  few pictures . 
  not much more to the watch than what is shown . 
  the chain is not the original one so i did n't take any pictures of it . 
  fifth and final item - an old russian [ medal ] ( http://imgur.com/a/6bjtq ) . 
  stalin is on the medal if it helps . 
  says :, 
  in translation : in our just cause, 
  we have won, 
  for victory over germany, 
  in the great country war 1941-1945 . 
  my father and i bought a pocket watch yesterday . 
  it is supposedly a 1938 glashutte . 
  appears to be old but its authenticity is still under question . 
  here 's some [ pictures ] ( http://imgur.com/a/mgeyv ) of it . 
  [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/mgeyv ) is the watch . 
  appears to be old . 
  thank you in advance . 
  he already has the physical capabilities , so in this trilogy we are looking at how he is trying to learn enough to be the comic-book genius we know . 
  the main point of the trilogy would be his attempts to find the balance between fighting crime , being the lovable persona we know and trying to learn everything bruce wayne had to know . 
  the main villain of the movies would be mr. 
  freeze , played by stone-cold . 
  i 'll probably build a pc in a few weeks . 
  i 'm in college so i need something small that i can transport more easily , so mini-itx . 
  decided to go with apu because i 'm on a tighter budget . 
  also , a more powerful psu to save some cash further down the line when i decide to throw in a dedicated gpu , maybe in 6-9 months . 
  this is my first ever build so i could use some advice i guess . 
  here it is :,

  hey all ,, 
  i have been thinking about this for quite some time , this theory is still quite unpolished and there is no real evidence to it , but after a few beers and being bored i decided to write about it . 
  the events at the tower of joy . 
  we assume arthur dayne was the leader of the kg party . 
  he stayed on the orders of his prince rhaegar and defended the tower instead of fighting at the trident . 
  the battle of the trident is lost and , eventually , ned heads out to get his sister back , who dayne is guarding . 
  from what we know , the tower of joy is , basically , a tower , and we assume that there were not many people there apart from the 3 king 's guards . 
  ned arrives and the most shady battle of all time ensues . 
  here is my theory : ned 's reputation well precedes him , he is a paragon of honor and justice and arthur probably knows that . 
  even if he did n't , he probably knew that lyanna was not going to last long . 
  ned arrives , and the best knight and warrior we know of decides to kill ned and his party ? 
  to kill the brother of dying woman without letting them say their goodbyes ? 
  i believe that the events at the toj were a result of something that happened after ned saw his sister for the last time . 
  i believe that that arthur and the other 2 kings guards let ned go see his sister for the last time , regardless of what they believed the outcome of the battle would be . 
  for all they knew , they might have won that 3v6 ( ? ) . 
  even if lyanna was really * just * kidnapped and raped by rhaegar , i highly doubt they would take that away from ned , especially considering who ned is . 
  i mean he is called * the * ned a few times . 
  so what went down ? 
  assuming r+l = j , i think that ned , initially , wanted to break the news to robert . 
  the king 's guard , doing their duty , knew that would mean the death of the boy , probably , and that is why the fight broke out . 
  howland reed , eventually : i believe arthur dayne sustained heavy wounds , but would have won the fight vs reed and ned , however , reed told ned to take jon as his bastard and protect his identity . 
  actually , this is the only part of this theory where i have anything close to evidence . 
  we never hear about how arthur dayne died , was he stabbed ? 
  decapitated ? 
  a sword slashed him in half ? 
  maybe he died of his wounds when he knew that jon was safe . 
  all in all , i believe that ned and party did n't just get to the toj swinging swords without asking questions . 
  the fight broke out after eddard had his last talk with lyanna , and his decisions lead to the conflict . 
  bonus theory ( a truck-load of tinfoil ) : jon is really a bastard of ned , and r+l = someone who is with howland reed , or , jon has a twin brother who is with reed , jon is azor ahai and the the other one is the prince that was promised . 
  i just assembled a new pc , mitx to make it a bit easier to carry around when travelling . 
  anyway , this pc has no way to connect to wi-fi , and i tried to connect it to my laptop 's internet , but for whatever reason it could n't . 
  now , my laptop is connected to my folks ' wireless at their house , but the router is downstairs , and i do n't want to go downstairs to hook it to the router with a cable . 
  after failing to connect my new glorious pc ( overstatement , but i love it , i will have to stick in a proper gpu at some point , though ) i decided to bring in the big guns . 
  or small guns ... my rooted sgs2 . 
  connected it to the wi-fi network , hooked it with a usb cable to my pc , and voila !, 
  it is truly incredible how pcs do not put a limit on what we can do , and everything can be fixed in numerous ways . 
  either giving up and going downstairs , or tinkering for an hour , and finally finding a way to succeed in connecting my pc to the wi-fi , the choice is ours . 
  so i 'm still kind of sleepy , and this idea just popped in my mind . 
  bear with me . 
  with gurm confirming that the show offed the mannis , and keeping in mind that he is too much of a major character , not only within the world of ice and fire , but a major one in terms of plot , he will probably die in the books , too . 
  question is - how ? 
  i do hope brienne has nothing to do with it , as that is just silly in my opinion . 
  i will take a few considerations before i get to my idea - the pink letter is false , and stannis wins the battles of both ice and winterfell . 
  reigning from there , some time after jon 's death , while stannis is reigning from winterfell the wall is destroyed , and the others start invading . 
  so now with the more unconventional considerations and theories . 
  in the panic that ensues after the wall is destroyed , shireen is slain by the others and resurrected as a wight . 
  the others ' army go marching down south , and eventually stannis has to fight at winterfell . 
  what happens there is that sooner or later he sees shireen and has to fight her . 
  we know that wights have some minimal form of memory retention , enough to go kill the most important person they know , so her seeking out stannis amidst the battle would not be that surprising . 
  in a battle that involves wights we can also assume carrying a torch would be a good idea . 
  i 'm almost at the end now . 
  once they meet , stannis grits his teeth one last time and gets to work . 
  he has to kill shireen in her wight form , to do that he will stab her in the heart with `` lightbringer '' ( the one he carries , not necessarily an authentic one , ) and burns her with the torch . 
  stabbing her would be no more than keeping her locked down enough to mitigate the danger from her . 
  now what would the results from this happening be - stan the man visibly disturbed by what he has done lets his guard down , or maybe keeps it down willingly , is also slain . 
  if the `` wake dragons from stone '' prophecy is true at all , maybe it will be fulfilled then , i do not know what rahloo thinks about burning wightened king 's blood . 
  mainly , this whole thing is to give one idea on how the mannis dies , and one i find more likable than failing miserably in taking over winterfell , and even more so compared to the show and the power of sir twenty goodmen . 
  do i have evidence ? 
  no , but this sub has been discussing dothraki soup temperature , so i think i am safe .
