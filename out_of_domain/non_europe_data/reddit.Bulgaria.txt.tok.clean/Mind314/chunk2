  great ... 
  well if you have a bank account in croatia and a bank account here , just connect the one here to paypal as well as the one in croatia and use the [ send money to friends and family ] ( https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/helphub/article/?solutionid=faq2398 ) . 
  i 've used it for similar purposes and it does the job . 
  last time i sent 2000 euros and the fee was 16 euros or something . 
  i assumed you could pay your taxes online :(, 
  [ that ] ( https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/kbbymkur7oghetsvmh_mlsnygul7zgsp76etam-wfm0.png ) picture ? 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rila_monastery ) is the place in question . 
  is that type of architecture common ? 
  meh ... a lot of influences over the centuries so it 's hard to say what 's `` common '' . 
  you have those , you have some remains dating back to the roman empire , several from the middle ages , more recently you have the soviet [ concrete tombs ] ( http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/00/21/75/19_big.jpg ) as we like to call them and we tried to copy [ austria and france ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@42.6965135,23.3261225,3a,75y,126.07h,93.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1secybqfxwowakpqtcysjlyq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ) for about 50 years up till 1944 . 
  website ? 
  not sure . 
  [ tripadvisor ] ( http://www.tripadvisor.com/tourism-g294451-bulgaria-vacations.html ) is usually the one i use . 
  go on a tour around the center . 
  it 's free . 
  [ that 's what it 's actually called . ] ( http://www.freesofiatour.com/ ) . 
  have fun and enjoy . 
  data taken from [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment ) . 
  d3js + datamaps.js used for the visualization . 
  might do it at some point next week . 
  902 could not be classified iirc ( those who had some identification such as `` european union / france '' were added to france for example ) . 
  somewhere around 4.7 % were lost though . 
  i ca n't do much about those unfortunately . 
  okey dokey , done . 
  software engineer !?!?!?!?? 
  pm me what languages you know ( absolutely serious ) . 
  not a recruiter ( i hate those ) , but i am a software engineer myself and a few additional fingers would be appreciated here and there . 
  even if you decide to look for a job on your own , you should be able to find a really good one within a week ( sofia is your safest bet ) . 
  attitudes ? 
  my bet is around 90 % positive . 
  you might get some weird shit ( nothing serious ) from the old commies suffering from dementia but they are dying out quickly now . 
  i know a few irish people around and they are doing fine . 
  personally i love irish people - awesome experiences with all irish people i 've ever met . 
  weeeell unfortunately i have bad news for you : not yet . 
  most if not all banks are now part of of sepa but it 's officially not fully implemented ( whatever that means ) . 
  the deadline is november next year . 
  and even though we are pegged to the euro , since we are not using it , there will be a commission of 1 euro regardless . 
  i have to admit 10 for receiving and 30 for sending is a bit of a rip off . 
  i personally use paypal for transfers cause it 's immediate and for larger amounts ( over 1000 euros ) , a 10-ish euro commission is not bad at all . 
  but yeah , i 'd advise you to look into other banks . 
  raiffeisen is a decent option i think . 
  iirc , they charge you 5 euros for incoming and 10-15 for sending money . 
  do n't quote me on this , call them just to be sure . 
  first of all welcome . 
  i 'm really not the best man to answer your questions - i 've never been self employed . 
  but i ' l try to answer as much as i can ( and hopefully someone else could fill in/fix the gaps i 'm leaving ) . 
  first of all , taxes - it 's practically irrelevant how much you make if it 's over 2200 bgn ( iirc ) . 
  flat tax system so naturally taxes are low af . 
  and it 's not 10 % if i 'm not mistaking , it 's technically less . 
  i think by default the state assumes that 40 % of what you make are expenses . 
  so it 's 10 % of the remaining 60 % . 
  bank accounts : whether you choose leva or euro , it 's practically the same - pegged to euro so 1 euro = 1.9569 leva all day every day . 
  you could choose to have a euro or usd bank account if you prefer but the bank will kinda screw you over each time you use an atm or pay at a supermarket so you might want to think this through . 
  or you could have a few bank accounts in different currencies ( even as a local , that 's what i 've done ) . 
  documents in english - banks - yes , pretty much unconditionally . 
  state institutions - highly unlikely . 
  you might want to bring someone who speaks the language . 
  trust accountants ? 
  ~ ish ... no one will screw you over on purpose but some of them know less about our tax system than me about molecular biology . 
  my personal advise - avoid the freelance tax consultant kind of stuff and go to a tax consultant company . 
  keep in mind that they can be greedy as hell . 
  just to give you an idea - a friend of mine is self employed and she pays more for a tax consultant here than what i 'm paying for a tax consultant as a business owner in germany ( if we exclude the plane tickets to germany and back of course ) . 
  on that account , since you are in bansko , i would advise you to take your time and do the tax stuff in sofia though . 
  the beer is a kind invitation but i 'm afraid i rarely leave the sofia city province ( except when going abroad ) . 
  in total over the past 4 years , i 've been in the countryside 3 times for a total of 4 days . 
  but thanks anyway :p, 
  [ plesio ] ( http://www.plesio.bg/shop.html#maptab ) offers some ridiculously cheap laptops but judging by the way they look , they will last a week if you are lucky . 
  completely not worth it . 
  i would advise you to check out [ pcstore ] ( http://www.pcstore.bg/bg/kontakti ) . 
  so far i 've only bought two laptops from them but i 'm really happy with their service . 
  they will even let you open the laptop and check if linux runs on them if you come with your own live usb before you buy it . 
  i am not kidding , i literally spent half a day testing laptops before i bought one a few months ago . 
  i 've mentioned it before but [ this ] ( https://www.paypal.com/bg/webapps/mpp/send-money-online ) is usually a great option . 
  not sure if there are additional fees when you are transferring to canada but the commission i paid for transferring 3000 euros to germany was around 20 euros . 
  bonus points : it 's pretty much immediate . 
  employment contract or business ownership is only required from non-eu citizens . 
  eu citizens simply need to register in the local police department , much like in any other eu member state . 
  someone has kindly made a nice [ guide here ] ( http://bulgaria.angloinfo.com/moving/residency/residence-permits/ ) . 
  some of your documents would have to be translated as i can see . 
  i 've had to translate a lot of crap over the years and my personal advice would be to go to the spanish embassy - tons of small firms offering translation and legalization of documents from and to any major language in that area , really cheap too . 
  as far as the police department goes , i 'm willing to bet that all the paperwork will be in bulgarian . 
  so you might need to take someone with you to help you out . 
  afaik you will have your identification number as soon as you apply - your birth date and a few other numbers that you can calculate yourself if you want ( really simple math ) . 
  good luck and welcome . 
  honestly ? 
  beats me . 
  that 's why i mentioned the spanish embassy area . 
  i 'm guessing the whole thing is just a formality and no one will even bother to look at them . 
  i mean i 've literally gone to translate dozens of documents and from my experience no one has even looked at them - usually a photocopy and then they shove them in a file in the back of a dusty room . 
  as a few people already mentioned , you 'll probably get a better answer if you ask on / r/untiedkingdom, 
  honestly i have n't seen the black sea since 2003 and i do n't miss it at all . 
  first of all it 's expensive as hell , not to mention sunny beach . 
  i mean you can get something cheap but the sheets might be from the 90s . 
  the rest is huge hotels ... eerm . . how do i describe it . . 
  imagine what would happen if a victorian mansion and the mansion of a russian mafia boss had a child ... that 's what they look like . 
  and put a price tag from hawaii . 
  that bad . 
  hence the reason why most people around here choose other destinations such as greece , turkey or italy . 
  especially greece lately : due to their financial state at the moment they even accept our currency in shops and restaurants . 
  service is great , people are kind , significantly cheaper and you can actually get some rest .
