  i personally went to spain this year and i do n't think i 'll be going anywhere other than spain in the coming years . 
  as for what people think about english people , sorry to say this but you do have really bad reputation . 
  but worry not , as long as you do n't make trouble you wo n't have any problems ( brits end in the police department in sunny beach more often than you can imagine ) . 
  i think the tone has softened down a lot since people found out that brits just act like that everywhere . 
  taxi drivers . . like anywhere really . 
  the only two countries where i 've enjoyed using taxis were germany and spain . 
  here ... bad ... not because they will screw you over but because they are indeed worthless morons . 
  be prepared to have a driver that knows everything there is to know about ... well everything ... 
  my honest opinion - there are better places . 
  i hate our seaside in my guts . 
  especially sunny beach . 
  the whole party till we die is not really my scene . 
  but i 'm also closer to 30 than 25 so this might have something to do with it . 
  you probably do n't understand sarcasm . 
  figuratively speaking of course . 
  no way in hell you 'll convince me that a small pepperoni pizza in a nice pizza place in alicante has the same price as an omelet in sunny beach ( i 'm talking about decent places to eat of course ) . 
  and yes , i 'm fully aware that sunny beach is a dump . 
  7 euros 25 cents in alicante . 
  barcelona is an expensive city and significantly more expensive than any other spanish city i 've been to . 
  and yes , i have seen receipts which did say '' \u043e\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 13.99 '' . 
  and the address was , you guessed it , sunny beach . 
  that 's what i 've seen . 
  as i said , i hate our seaside in my guts and i wo n't be going there anytime soon . 
  good think the subway stop is 5 minutes away from my flat and another 10 from the airport . 
  certainly makes my summer holiday plans easier . 
  yeah , having trains in the late and early hours would be awesome . 
  but i doubt we 'll be getting those anytime soon : not really necessary and taxis are cheap . 
  if you live in sofia ( or close to sofia ) , and like catching a plane to a random destination for a few days out of boredom , you could also try [ goavio ] ( http://goavio.com ) . 
  you can find awesome deals there . 
  yeah , some destinations are cheap as dirt . 
  unfortunately my most common destination is not one of them :(, 
  no favourite yet . 
  oulu is a bit of a special place for me but perhaps has to do with the fact that that 's the first ( and so far last ) place i saw the northern lights . 
  other than that berlin has been a second home to me for a few years and even though i absolutely adore berlin , there 's also the fact that it 's business related ... 
  watching already, 
  yes . 
  you should hear me giving speeches :d, 
  well fair enough :, 
  the type of post created from an account registered a few days ago , suggests that you might as well be another troll that keeps posting the same retarded post every 3 weeks or so . 
  the low english proficiency and similar grammatical and semantic mistakes also made by the other accounts , makes me think it 's the same spoiled teenager . 
  hopefully no shengen anytime soon . 
  i do believe we are not ready for it : a ton of issues need to be addressed . 
  not on a government level but on a social level . 
  those problems seem to be resolved in the 2 or 3 large cities , but there are still many cities and villages where people need to learn a thing or two about living in a society : democracy comes with certain obligations . 
  pay your taxes , use the stupid garbage bins , walk an extra 15 meters so you can use the zebra crossing . 
  then again i do believe fines are way too low . 
  fines should be 500 + euros and that will solve the problems to a large extent . 
  same goes for driving - 10km over the speed limit - 5 years in jail + 100000 euros and no more driving while you breathe . 
  falling apart is not what 's happening . 
  shutting down the external borders of the eu should be done though . 
  sadly our southern neighbors from greece seem to disagree and are kindly letting anyone through . 
  if by hurting you mean 30 virgins have n't showed up to chew your food for you and p\u043eur it into your mouth ( and somehow swallow it and digest it for you ) - yes . 
  such a disappointment , innit ? 
  but from my point of view - good . 
  enough with the crying . 
  it 's 2016 and knowing basic english is nowhere near enough when 6 year old kids already speak 2 or 3 foreign languages . 
  enough with `` you are awesome my child , it 's the country 's fault '' . 
  i 'd say it 's largely due to cultural conditioning of some sorts . 
  older generation was taught that that they could do whatever they want and the state authorities would take care of their shit ( not that it was actually working this way ) . 
  younger generations and those who had to grow up and live during the transition ( generation z , y and partially x ) have for the most part figured out that everything is up to them ( op and his second troll account further down are the exception ) . 
  i personally think this has a lot to do with the urbanization process - older people feel they are abandoned in the country side and it 's some cosmic entity 's fault without realizing that a town with a population of 1000 can not possibly be of any interest to a functioning 20 year old .

  +1 for the free tours . 
  people seem to love it . 
  check the sofia history museum ( it was recently opened and it 's kinda cool - lots of pre-soviet stuff . 
  the boyana church is an interesting place ( 10-th century monastery ) but i 'm not sure there 's an easy way to get there other than renting a car . 
  if you do rent a car , there 's something that few people other than the locals know about - [ this one ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bf%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%be%d1%82%d0%be&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=992&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewisr9_wysblahulahmkhfntatoq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=kopitoto ) . 
  it 's a 15 minute drive from the city and i 'd especially recommend you to go in the evening . 
  views are awesome . 
  do n't mind the fact that the abandoned buildings might look dodgy ( carry a flashlight ) - there 's always tons of people who go up there to enjoy the views . 
  i 've been there in 3 in the morning on a weekday and there were at least 50-60 others . 
  bars - `` rock it '' or `` rock n roll '' - ca n't go wrong withe either one of those . 
  road 66 is ok as a third option i guess . 
  must eat - ca n't get that one wrong i think . 
  recently it feels like sofia has become the hipster-burger capital of the world . 
  not that i mind . 
  the corner bar ( google it ) is a nice place mostly to enjoy the views . 
  generally if a restaurant looks good , it 's probably great . 
  unless you 're a vegan , in which case welcome to hell . 
  shooting range - beats me ... 
   terminal 1, 
  got really bad memories from terminal 1 . 
  might have something to do with the amounts of alcohol i drank though . 
  as someone who just quit his job , i 'm really disappointed . 
  yeah , i 'd rather drink my own piss . 
  too much competition . 
  well in all fairness [ microsoft has a bit of a history ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2009/tech/08/26/microsoft.ad.gaffe/index.html ), 
  you ca n't copy your brain into a computer and that 's all you need to know . 
  scientifically it 's not possible . 
  you could have a look at how the isocortex works and this will give you an idea why copying brains will never work . 
  a tl ; dr version would be that computer memory is based on clustering and indexing ( oversimplifying here a bit ) , meaning at any given time , you know where to find a specific piece of information . 
  the brain - not so much .
