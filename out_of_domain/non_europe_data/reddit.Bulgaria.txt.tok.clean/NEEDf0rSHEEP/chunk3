  * of 3,141 counties in the us , trump won 3,084 and clinton won a mere 57 . 
  you also massively under appreciate the significant economic contributions of some very much so important , and , in your case , popularly known states that trump has won . 
  * texas is the third largest economy in the united states , being home to six of the top 50 largest companies on the fortune 500 list . 
  texas also contributes a large , if not the largest portion of home-grown oil in the us . 
  * florida has a gdp of $ 748 billion . 
  that is 4 and a half times larger than nz 's , and has significant agriculture and industrial sectors . 
  * wisconsin 's economy is driven by significant industrial , agricultural and manufacturing sectors , totaling to a gdp of $ 248.3 billion , 1 and a half times larger than our own . 
  it 's bloody state motto is `` america 's dairyfarm '' . 
  * michigan , although it has the hellhole that is detroit , produces cars to this day , and houses very important companies like gm , ford and chrysler to name a few . 
  * pennsylvania , afaik the only state that gives tax credits for the film industry , has a gdp of $ 644 billion and is home to fifty fortune 500 companies . 
  if you dare call people from these states `` uneducated '' and not contributing economically at all to the united states , relative to the states that clinton won , then you are indeed a simpleton . 
  i was n't spinning it at all mate , i was simply explaining how the electoral college worked and why it was important . 
  i 've often linked [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6s7jb6-gou ) , since it explains it more clearly than i generally can . 
  i think it covers your questions . 
  give it a watch and if you have more questions , ask me and i 'll try to answer you , mate .

  do n't stuff words into my mouth that i have n't said , mate . 
  i was n't as vocal defending that number as i was doing an investigation of my own after you brought that to light . 
  that being said , you are correct . 
  i apologize . 
  the article was posted on 15/11 , whilst your map was last updated on 20/12 , so i assume that the number 57 was initially called before all recounts , and after hrc got 2 + million more votes to her name from said recounts she got more counties . 
  well done . 
  new zealand as well mate . 
  bet you 5 quid it would be even worse than the uk :p, 
   i had such a sense of accomplishment rum through me . 
  hope you kept the rum in moderation , mate . 
  yacht feels way larger than plane . 
  you spend more time walking in that map then shooting or contributing to your team in anyway . 
  # ** whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight **, 
  very easy . 
  though there are some words that are new or unfamiliar to us , as a bulgarian speaker i understand atleast 80 % of a given sentence in russian . 
  this is coming from someone who was n't taught russian in school , but generally the older the bulgarian , the greater the comprehension . 
  a useful analogy !, 
  better use this to look smart to my fellow sjw peers ! '', 
  i bet you 're one of the people that also uses the crusades comparison when talking about islamic to christian violence . 
  turkey ? 
  the country with that disgusting dictator who is outright threatening the west with refugees ? 
  which encourages government censorship through youtube and twitter bans ? 
  where as much as ** 30 % ** of the turkish population is inbred ? 
  and bangladesh ? 
  where child pornography is ** not ** illegal ? 
  where its a leader in child marriages , rape , and illiteracy ? 
  give me a fucking break . 
  bulgarian women play belote ?

  enjoy sofia mate . 
  please explain to me how ubi would n't cause increased taxation or a massive change of the government budget , leading to an increase in the money supply , and leading to an increase in inflation , which would devalue the price goods and services soo high that no one would be able to afford it , leading to an ever increasing ubi and the cycle repeating itself to kingdom come ? 
  because the way i see it , ubi is just a `` feel-good '' solution that only sjws or socialists/communists advocate for to satisfy a lonely void in their lives . 
  tl ; dr , poor andy got his poor feelings hurt and is trying to scrape in a few headlines to pass that 20 % mark . 
  that face she made was quite brilliant . 
  beta is beta . 
  report it and complain if it is n't fixed when the actual game is released . 
  remember the crysis 2 leak ? 
  remember how the leak was compiled a month and a half before the game actually got released , and was poorly optimized and buggy ? 
  remember how when the actual game got released , most of the things actually got fixed and the whole experience was pretty much an informal beta test ? 
  do n't doubt aaa game companies 's ability to fix large amounts of issues within a small timeframe . 
  ubisoft , like crytek , is a massive corporation and i have little doubt that if we make our voices heard ( since unfortunately some things fall on deaf ears at ubi ) we could see the majority of the things we are complaining about right now getting fixed before launch . 
  never heard of liberals regretting turning conservative . 
  ca n't say i 've heard conservatives turning liberal , though . 
  assuming they do it at all , i 'd say it would start to get really difficult drafting new operators come year 3 . 
  the list of operators already looks pretty full right now , and after the additional 8 we get this year i can imagine ubi 's idea sheets starting to get really thin , ontop of all the balancing that needs to be done to accommodate them and make sure no operator already in the game gets replaced/outclassed . 
  but mute can already mute hatches by placing a jammer under it . 
  case in point , oregon . 
  you have to understand that our national politics , up until the communists came , was to reunite all bulgarian lands under one nation . 
  our `` curse '' , as you so heavily put it , is macedonia . 
  we managed to reunite eastern rumelia , but failed with macedonia for years . 
  because of this , we are literally a nation split in two , much like germany was once , or korea like now . 
  the attack in the second balkan war was n't stupid , it was quite justified . 
  the serbs betrayed us taking macedonia for themselves after the first war . 
  if we did n't attack , we would look weak for all our neighbors , and we could have lost even more land as a result . 
  we had no choice . 
  we held our own against everyone , but do you know why ? 
  because we fought for our homeland and our brothers and sisters in macedonia . 
  there 's no denying the strength that gives you . 
  we could 've won if romania did n't attack our defenseless north and stretched our lines way too thin . 
  our soldiers , sadly , are finite . 
  unfortunately , this macedonian obsession of ours is perhaps the sole reason we 've lost all of our major wars after the first balkan war . 
  our inability to secure it has shamed us internationally and historically , and has damned the millions of bulgarians who died fighting for it . 
  hey , look on the bright side . 
  everybody lost macedonia - greeks , serbians , bulgarians . 
  it 's better that no one has it than have to face the embarrassment of someone else keeping it from us . 
  the second balkan war boils down to this : serbia makes a hidden pact with greece , refuses to give macedonia to bulgaria . 
  bulgaria attacks serbia , both serbia and greece retaliate . 
  we get ground into their territories , romania attacks from the north unopposed . 
  the ottomans see this and push in from the south east also unopposed . 
  bulgaria sues for peace as it gets encircled from all directions . 
  romania got southern dobrudja from the peace deal , which we later got back via a treaty in ww2 . 
  other than that , there was a nationwide shock since we 've won virtually every war and battle since independence . 
  we also did n't have the largest army in the balkans anymore , that title went to serbia . 
  't was a great failure . 
  no toaster . 
  i did n't know muslims were a race now , mate . 
  to be fair , that chick in huntly was bat shit crazy . 
  she could 've verbally abused anyone passing by . 
  it just happened that a woman wearing a burka passed by and happened to record it , she claimed it as a muslim attack , and then the shameless sensationalist media bought it all up . 
  does n't seem like nationwide resentment mate , especially given that we 're perhaps the most tolerant society in the world . 
  all i saw was a woman needing mental help , and she even came out apologising and asking for it .
