its okay . 
  he is probably new around here . 
  sign peace with harold *, 
  start faction to change the laws to elective and make other vassals join your faction, 
  try to get your character elected, 
  king of france . 
  ** if i remember correctly you get something like 12k event troops . 
  you can use them for your rebellion . 
  i must say that i very rarely play the 1000s starts so i 'm sorry if something is wrong . 
  enemy at the gates is shit . 
  jesus i remember this thread, 
  unless you convert to catholicism and then after the crusade ends you go back to orthodoxy . 
  i 've done it a couple of times even in ironman, 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ recommend ^ ^ creating ^ ^ the ^ ^ kingdom ^ ^ of ^ ^ greece ^ ^ to ^ ^ secure ^ ^ your ^ ^ territories . 
   i think there might be a bulgarian count in the north . 
  cometopulos - count of dorostotum, 
  his ancestors were kings of bulgaria in the early 1000s [ most notable is this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_of_bulgaria ), 
  e : he is also the only bulgarian count ( strategos of karvuna is also cometopulian but he has greek culture ), 
  final edit : on both 1066 starts there 's one cometopulian count in armenia ( alusian ) + if i remember correctly he has bulgarian culture . 
  the only way i know is with courtiers , buisness focus and if you have friends . 
   will definitely try it . 
  i see istanbul , paris , rome , athens , london , san francisco , washington and maybe the netherlands . 
  not bad op . 
  aland islands . 
  keeping the world genes clear, 
   our very best king ever :-), 
  um about that ... 
   he is noted for his extensive physical , intellectual , and emotional disabilities ( the product of generations of inbreeding between the habsburgs ), 
   scotland, 
   thousands of men showing their asses to the english, 
  how is this not accurate ? 
  e : for historical games i suggest ck2 . 
  enjoy murdering your parents/sibilings and fucking your grandma . 
  i know ck2 isnt historical, 
  she is the type of girl that shows on / b / trap threads . 
  you look like a postman or truck driver . 
  \\ #jewishlivesmatter, 
  ... actually no . 
  fuck them and their 300 gold . 
  we got the same fucking radiators in our school . 
  send your other male children to religious orders and marry your daughters to powerful dukes/kings/emperors ( even if they look like jabba the hutt ), 
  well convert to christianity you fucking barbarian !, 
  i do n't like marrying to my close family cause i fear the mighty inbreed trait . 
  i do it only when my brother/sister/uncle / aunt . . has awesome stats and traits ( for example strong + genius and 10 + on everything ), 
  give alaska back to russia . 
  cheese pizza, 
  yes, 
  i have you tagged as `` expensive latvian condoms '', 
  i have absolutely no idea why, 
  \\ #hillary 2016, 
   overzealous wiping, 
  zeus ... save your ass and get a bidet for your house, 
  769 ingria, 
   constantinople, 
  even the turkish version `` konstantiniyye '' is better, 
  fuck you man, 
  yep, 
  some bulgarian rulers used the title `` tsar of the bulgarians and the romans '' ( most notable is simeon i `` the great '' ), 
  so mine is kinda historical, 
  custom ruler, 
  changed his culture with ` culture 696969 roman ', 
  well technically the title is correct ... 
  10/10 your company is the best . 
  the rome one is the best looking duchy coa . 
  they look like a sad pepe, 
  [ ah vladimirskiy central ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i-xj0vk978 ), 
  do n't want to sound rude but can you eli5 what russia/ussr did for india during the cold war ? 
  so province culture changes if you start as roman ? 
  i thought thats a dead culture . 
  like you and your court are the only romans and counties keep their original culture, 
  yes there was another khan - khan kardam 777-800 ( or 803 ) telerig ( the one in 769 ) escaped to byzantium in 777, 
  there are other mistakes like boris ( 867 ) having one more son rasate . 
  [ simeon i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simeon_i_of_bulgaria ) having shit stats when he was in fact our greatest ruler . 
  both tsars in ( 1042/1072 ) were only self-proclaimed and nobody acknowledged them as bulgarian rulers . 
  tsar kaloyan , tsar boril and tsar ivan-asen ii ( ivan ii in the game ) should be catholics cause in 1204 kaloyan accepted catholicism only if the pope recognise his title tsar of bulgaria . 
  in 1235 tsar ivan-asen ii switched back to orthodoxy, 
  with some imagination you can add one titular title in the game - kingdom of vidin, 
  ... police officers maybe ? 
  i 'm more amazed by those building foundations, 
  where i live if flood like this happens your house will be pretty much useless/destroyed . 
  was n't alexios actually really looking for something like a crusade ? 
  here goes half an hour, 
  you 're my fetish, 
  this is gon na be interesting, 
  now i expect russia to defend iran and us to defend saudi arabia, 
   the saudi foreign minister said riyadh would not allow iran to `` sabotage security '' of the kingdom , the media outlet reported . 
  i guess this is [ the reason ] ( https://www.rt.com/news/327755-saudi-embassy-iran-protest/ ), 
  what a nice conversation, 
  i 'm european and i do n't have any idea what are you all talking about . 
  basileios i died cause he fucked his wife too much . 
  he was n't even that old , only 43-44 . 
  in the same game karlmann with his shit stats ( king of bavaria 867 ) formed hre ... ^ ^ ofc ^ ^ with ^ ^ some ^ ^ help ^ ^ from ^ ^ me, 
  i have a little request can you give me a unique flair just saying ` normie ' ? 
  thanks . 
  10/10 good luck, 
   vaginalis, 
  til i have two little vaginas on my balls . 
  zeus no, 
  thanks man, 
  happy cake day,
