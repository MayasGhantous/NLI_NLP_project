  i would say to check firstly if poland is in pu with lithuania . 
  if they are not under pu then go for austria . 
  ugly as fuck . 
  arabia , africa , persia are n't completely ruled by the glorious roman empire . 
  also look at that ugly thing in central europe . 
  conquering italy as montferrat and then reclaiming your old ancestral lands . 
  man i love eu4 .

  i speak russian and \u0441\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044c, 
  i know, 
  if i was to buy the game today the problem would n't be the game but the 50 + dlcs . 
  40 $ is n't that much but when you add 250 more in dlcs the game goes up to 300 $ . 
  you can buy a shitty computer or 3-4 next gen games with that kind of money . 
  wait for a sale when the game is usually with 75 % discount and buy the game with all core dlcs . 
  skip the music and unit packs . 
   smart, 
  checked, 
   cultured, 
  depends . 
  sometimes i fart near random people just for the keks and to make them feel uncomfortable .

  besides getting a sneak peek into games at an early development stage , and unannounced titles , we offer you a game key from a list of paradox titles every time you participate in a new playtest .

   we do this by inviting you to come play our games that are still in development , usually for ** an hour or two ** , while you get to tell us what you think . 
  so you play for two/three/five hours and then you get a key to whatever paradox game/dlc you want . 
  to me that looks like a good offer .

  i 'd marry the 3/10 ( even if she 's feminazi batshit crazy ) and then i would try my best to make the 9/10 and her parents really fucking jealous . 
  as a bulgarian i disagree,

  the building on the left looks like a big phallus,
