generikb moving to bulgaria !, 
  i am very happy to hear that . 
  but by what he has said that their house is a historical building it might be in a village most probably . 
  and the internet may be a problem then . 
  internet is best in big cities like plovdiv , sofia etc. 
  wish you luck with the moving , genny and i hope we can meet some time . 
  excellent season z !, 
  you know it takes time to record , edit and upload videos to youtube right ? 
  creepered right when you log in . 
  thats sad :d, 
  edit : or maybe not . 
  great !, 
  oh this is just epic :d made my day . 
  pulling a bdouble0 - to be bombarded by half of the existing mobs in minecraft at once . 
  including a donkey, 
  constantly checking my subscribtion box !, 
  if you read this genny , how are you going to schedule your videos when you move to here ? 
  are they going to remain at the same times as now or not ? 
  hey what is all the fuss about . 
  i just asked a question i did not beg him to change the schedule for his videos . 
  i respect every mindcracker ( and not only them ) for the work they all do to provide us with entertaining material . 
  some say putting a block infront of your door , placing it so it acts like it is open or replacing it with an iron door does the trick .

  i think that only the area around the parliament is closed off so if you do n't really need to go in that exact area you wo n't have any problems ( unless the protesters suddenly decide they need to close off the centre of the city ) . 
  guude 's episode 5 is the best uhc 20 minutes in recent seasons . 
  the four of them make for a good video . 
  nope he has n't . 
  and i was fearing that i would be late to the stream . 
  guude is polish ? 
  i 've been watching the mindcrack goup for over 2 years and i am still amazed by the things i find out . 
  the previous version 's bugs were a big part of the fun i think . 
  but they know what they are doing ... probably, 
  hey john !, 
  please come to bulgaria with soad . 
  you make great music !, 
  about 230km south east of gennyb :-), 
  rob backing up into the noob trap must be one of the funniest moments of the series .
