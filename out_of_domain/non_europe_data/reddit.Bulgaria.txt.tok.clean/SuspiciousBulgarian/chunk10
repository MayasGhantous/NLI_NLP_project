  yup thats us, 
  nice . 
  was a bit bored with the game and did n't play it for a couple months but this should make it fun again : ), 
  this better be an announcement about a show in bulgaria . 
  one can dream . 
  i know . 
  * day after day , and night after night . 
  he keeps coming to my shop , will i ever get to say `` hi !, 
  man i went from system of a down with their short-ass songs ( mostly ) to dt . 
  but i still love soad . 
  i give them a listen every once in a while . 
  not a big fan of the vocalist . 
  but the cover was spot on . 
  the choir section during the credits is incredible . 
  he also seems to have time for music . 
  full-on trackmania, 
  shush , they do n't need to know this . 
  well if there is a live show from now on that is worth seeing , it 's going to be the astonishing . 
  this promises to be something special . 
  too bad it looks like i am missing it : (, 
  would be really nice . 
  i love soc, 
  love listening to this in the car . 
  especially that outro . 
  yup !, 
  i like that saabkyle review such diverse cars but i cant stand to listen to those dry reviews . 
  has a lot of potential but i just ca n't get through a video . 
  true . 
  probably my favourite song off of dt12 . 
  well as a new fan of dt ( 1 year ) this was actually the first song of their 's i heard . 
  i liked it a lot and then i made the mistake of listening to the rest of dt12 . 
  that , i did n't like as much and then there was a reasonable gap until i tried out adtoe and later all other albums . 
  so in a way tei is responsible for my love for dt ( though it probably shares this with this is the life ) . 
  the gift of music . 
  step your acronym game up , boy . 
  lol, 
  i am not looking forward to remembering all the acronyms from ta . 
  who looked at this and said `` yes , i have designed a beautiful car . 
  nice video , really well made . 
  i spy the alexander nevsky cathedral . 
  also the hungarian parliament is an amazing building . 
  saw it in person and i did n't want to stop looking at it . 
  * shitposting intensifies *, 
  wacken 2015, 
  i want to forget . 
  well if i have to point out a moment i would have to watch it again . 
  maybe later, 
  oh , lord no . 
  that '' * [ when will i ever learn ] ( https://youtu.be/vzezpfqp-ty?t=2m41s ) * '' is horrible . 
  also the * [ banshee-wailing ] ( https://youtu.be/vzezpfqp-ty?t=2m54s ) * ( credit for the terminology goes to user `` chaossystem '' from the dt forums ) . 
  only 3 songs i like are fas , the enemy inside and surrender to reason . 
  [ ok ] ( http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3101/2347876864_ed2e2df318.jpg ), 
  i 'm impressed he did n't flip the monitor after the last kill . 
  this is not going to be a popular answer but `` i origins '' hit me hard and i was not expecting it . 
  [ this one is better ] ( https://youtu.be/gmb1c7tjjmc ), 
  man , i am so incredibly sad i will not be able to make it to a show : ( sounds pretty awesome . 
  my brothaa !, 
  all of them . 
  holy shit man , is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6ioan6c.jpg ) you ? 
  i literally just found this thread on dtf and saw that post . 
  * `` you 're watching guuuude ... '' *, 
  with so much rain here i might be getting a leak . 
  but not one that i would like . 
  yeah , i figured out you could n't be the only one with the same experience . 
  still had a * strange deja vu * though . 
  lol , you can breathe easy . 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=train+of+thought+dream+theater&amp;client=ms-android-samsung&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewje4rilhlhkahxllcwkhsb2bm0q_auibygb&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=559#imgrc=-hwa6wry16awsm%3a ), 
  have you listened to the album ? 
  holy fuck !!!, 
  that intro !!!, 
  everything about this is beautiful . 
  i am so hyped for the 29th, 
  yes !, 
  this . 
  it really does remind me of losing time and i like it . 
  those 10 days feel longer than the 4 months back in october . 
  when i woke up this morning and saw that mob is uploaded i was so hyped because i sawearlier on dtf that it was the song from the intro of the trailer . 
  i put on my headphones and played it . 
  i got chills right away , this intro is so good . 
  i dont know about a leak but i love how jp and jr reacted when they were on that show earlier and a guy who called said he had the album ( he was refering to live at luna park ) . 
  you da real mvp, 
  then the ecoboost 3cyl comes, 
  i think it will be the best for the last decade and one of their best ever . 
  at least that is what the two songs so far make me think . 
  pretty sure this is based on your search history . 
  maybe . 
  it does n't show up for me though . 
  i love the '' * meet me tonight where the stars touch the sky ... * '' part . 
  hymn of a thousand voices sounds like a pretty fucking cool song . 
  and this is where my steam profile picture came from, 
  james . 
  with so many characters it will be important to be able to tell them apart . 
  he has been praised in the reviews so far , so i expect alot from him . 
  i do n't know about an action figure but i want a nomac key chain so much . 
  i dont really care that much for reviews . 
  if i like the music it does n't matter what the reviewer thinks . 
  yup , i am in the same boat here . 
  ca n't wait to get my hands on a physical copy . 
  before that i will probably listen to it on spotify though . 
  it 's like people do n't even try to look through the first page of this subreddit .
