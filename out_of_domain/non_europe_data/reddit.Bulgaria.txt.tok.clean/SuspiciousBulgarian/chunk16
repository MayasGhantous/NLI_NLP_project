  i 'm ted bradberry !!, 
  meh , do n't really care that much . 
  the screenshot did n't look like something interesting to me . 
  meanwhile i 'm sitting here waiting for either dt or opeth to announce a date for bulgaria . 
  i am so pissed i missed opeth 's show in 2015 . 
  self titled had just came out and they were playing the enemy inside on the radio pretty often . 
  i liked it and decided to give them a shot . 
  found adtoe on spotify and then listened to the rest of the albums . 
  this is sexy af . 
  `` pretty sure that 's a lambo '', 
  brainless !, 
  so good, 
  welcome to 2007 ( even before that ) . 
  hey !, 
  the mp one looks like some character out of the astonishing pt .2, 
  from the newer stuff : the devil 's orchard , folklore , lines in my hand , eternal rains will come , cusp of eternity and moon above , sun bellow, 
  `` f1 is not like nascar , guys . 
  * clip showing f1 cars on the oval section of indianapolis *, 
  `` god damn it ! '', 
  huh , did n't know who read the lines . 
  i always just presumed it was mp . 
  panic attack : d, 
  good work . 
  that was the best moment ever in anything , lol . 
  i have rewatched that moment a few times but it 's just not the same . 
  the whole stream was a pretty good idea , helped me understand the story more . 
  2004 renault clio 1.2 60hp ( or 58 ) . 
  nothing much but it does it 's job as a city car quite well . 
  yeah , i am a huge fan of soad and they did something similar , granted they have n't released an album in 10 years but i see they are having a lot of fun on their tours since they got back together . 
  they went and did their solo stuff and i think it had a positive effect . 
  i do n't think there is a weak song on adtoe . 
  i \u043eften find myself listening to marrow of the earth recently . 
  but will it fit on my honda ? 
  i died li\u043ae 5 times when i was watched that on tv . 
  such a ballsy move . 
  was there any doubt it is a countdown ? 
  if they wanted to say it releases on the third they would have probably had `` 3rd '' on the image .
