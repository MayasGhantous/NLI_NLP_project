  so not really that exciting . 
  so its business as usual for honda ? 
  please , person holding hamilton 's phone . 
  turn that thing horizontal . 
  dear god , alonso has posted a lap time . 
  [ soon ] ( http://www.simplyplanes.co.uk/images/pages_images/world_war_1_aircraft/fokker_triplane/fokker_triplane_2_photo.jpg ), 
  not really . 
  that is about the same as the gap is supposed to be , maybe more . 
  and times during testing are rarely indicative of a car 's true performance . 
  soneone is having a hard time with f1today 's timing sheet . 
  lol, 
  i have a feeling there will be a www.hasstrollcrashedtoday.com set up pretty soon . 
  bruh ... 
  welp . 
  i guess i was right . 
  why did i even click on that video ... fuck, 
  two words . 
  the mountain . 
  nothing exciting . 
  they can do 1:20 on softs, 
  nice mic, 
  ahem , `` f1 will not bring back v10 or v12 engines '', 
  my arms your purse and harvest are the best :d, 
  they should just have an automated update 3-4 minutes after a mclaren goes out that reads `` the mclaren has stopped on track '', 
  sit down boy . 
  i 've got some bad news for you . 
  turns out alonso 's new camo helmet really works . 
  i ca n't see him on track . 
  please , do n't start a `` i saw x 's helmet at x place '', 
  you get a freaking alpine ?!, 
  that is such a great little car . 
  they 'll install a handbrake specially for monaco and yank it every lap while blasting eurobeat . 
  does anyone have an idea what engine ferrari were testing here ? 
  they do n't have a v6t in their road or race cars except for f1 . 
  and i do n't think this was a v8t . 
  this video is wrong on so many levels , lmao . 
  they were practicing unlocking the lock because their 's broke . 
  yup , me too . 
  probably wise to do so . 
  western squat , not a slav . 
  glad you are enjoying opeth and dt . 
  it took some time for opeth to click for me as well , but boy , has it been great you should check out haken . 
  they are more like dt and are really promising . 
  i like your username . 
  thank you for not misquoting . 
  i would take a mercedes over a beer anyday too . 
  yup . 
  [ it was nico 's post monza video last season . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyqvrffk7-0 ), 
  lol, 
  bottas having some gp4 problems, 
  2017 cars biting hard, 
  those little subsector times kind of ruin qualifying for me . 
  bigger wings , bigger diffusers and fatter tires , basically, 
  edit :, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/red-bulls.jpg ), 
  holy moly !, 
  is it happening ? 
  so is kimi taking a nap or what ? 
  how the hell did they even break graphics . 
  like ... what ? 
  well there was a giant sauber on the formation lap . 
  that kimi radio was just perfect . 
  just silence . 
  fingers will be waved . 
  ocon pls do n't, 
  not really . 
  if it was a drivetrain change yeah . 
  but it 's mostly aero and mechanical grip, 
  `` highly not allowed '' yup, 
  as a long time fan of the gt trio . 
  i have to say that the 24th season of tg so far has been brilliant . 
  gt was still good , but they ruined the potential the new show had with the overboard circlejerking and a lot of pointless pieces . 
  gt got some things right but did many , many wrong and i hope they fix this in the second season . 
  well it does n't look to be a current regulation car . 
  so maybe that is why it doesnt have one of those, 
  logo seems to be holding up good . 
  but the bulgarian flag is fading away : ( will see you guys tomorrow again . 
  aww :( ( (, 
  w05 and w06 were 2014 and 2015 , just sayin . 
  hello !, 
  thank you for being such cool guys and helping us through the nights . 
  : ) i appreciate that you agreed to change the colours on the 3x3 too . 
  [ no idea what you 're talking about . 
  919 is v4, 
  should be a pixel per millimeter so i guess it 's fine . 
  also i can see steve irwin 's fucked up face from here which also says it 's fine . 
  that rs6 though, 
  inb4 stroll bins it at the last corner too . 
  `` is it a panda ? '', 
  lmao, 
  different probably . 
  happy cake day !, 
  software problem allegedly . 
  i actually just noticed they did away with the little subsector boxes for this whole qualy . 
  exactly !, 
  i am glad they did it , those little boxes ruined qualifying last time for me . 
  dat boi shouldnt be driving, 
  sainz with the master turnaround hitting the barrier lol, 
  i really like not seeing ham pulling away,
