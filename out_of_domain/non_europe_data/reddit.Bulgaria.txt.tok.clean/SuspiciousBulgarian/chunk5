  well i dont have trouble steering . 
  the throttle control is the problem, 
  do n't know about the physics but i think they have nailed the sounds . 
  indeed, 
  i lost my shit when i heard that . 
  just the tone of his voice . 
  unacceptable , but make for some damn good races . 
  oh man , that fuck up in the beginning . 
  majestic !, 
  elaborate ? 
  holy crap that got dark fast . 
  hope he does n't miss any apexes . 
  post sdoit :, 
  * tot - in the name of god / honor thy father, 
  * octavarium - octavarium / i walk beside you, 
  * systematic chaos - the ministry of lost souls / prophets of war, 
  * bc&sl - the shattered fortress / a rite of passage, 
  * adtoe - this is the life / beneath the surface, 
  i like how this has more upvotes than the detailed description above . 
  * how the hell do you dance to the mirror ? 
  brilliant, 
  [ dream theater - octavarium ] ( https://youtu.be/zvmik3xyayo ), 
  worth listening to every second of it ( and there are a lot ) . 
  as much as i do n't wan to say it ... mercedes, 
  looks fun . 
  at this point i do n't even care . 
  it wo n't be the same and i am sure it wo n't be better . 
  for starters , it 's a diesel, 
  lol , that guy with the honda , doing a massive slide right after he pitted . 
  and everybody hitting the wall when it started raining . 
  but ... but ... every day is dream theater day . 
  [ this is how ] ( https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/e15/11202542_503038669847772_1210327227_n.jpg ), 
  looks like i 'll be sticking to torrents . 
  well , top gear came to my country like 1 year after the season aired ... sooooo off to the torrents it was . 
  is it sure that the wings will look like that ? 
  if so that is amazing . 
  reminds me of the pre 2009 cars . 
  and those `` blades '' before the sidepods . 
  massa has been sitting on that spot for quite some time . 
  well hamilton is n't some god ( like many people seem to think ) he makes mistakes too . 
  anything can happen , we are only halfway through the season . 
  well it is , melted ice . 
  his face right after he picks it up , lol , priceless . 
  train of thought for sure . 
  dear god , and i thought serj tankian was n't singing well since soad reunited . 
  and constant motion definitely sounds ... let 's say different when james is `` trying '' to sing portnoy 's parts . 
  i would love something along the lines of tot . 
  woah , that second half of the third set you posted , i like it . 
  [ dream theater - stream of consciousness ] ( https://youtu.be/gsonl0mzdfa ), 
  nice !, 
  i always wanted to go to monza ( and still do ) . 
  `` i know what i 'm doing . '', 
  * heads straight to the grass *, 
  pretty much sums up the reasons why i miss portnoy . 
  i have nothing against mangini and i appreciate his abilities ( i love adtoe ) but i just do n't see the same chemistry with the band that portnoy had . 
  it jsut does n't work for me i 'm afraid . 
  woah , the only song i do n't really like from bc&sl is a rite of passage , otherwise it is a fine album as far as i am concerned . 
  well yeah , everyone has a different taste of course . 
  i really hate it that there was no dvd of that album . 
  yep , i am aware . 
  dear god , this is exactly what i thought of when i read it . 
  are you me ? 
  or am i you ? 
  it 's a reference . 
  oh wow , everyone who says something against hamilton gets rekt . 
  edit : including me . 
  even though i did n't say anything negative . 
  lol , grow up guys . 
  they actually measure the fuel used during a set of 3 consecutive laps iirc . 
  that means they can push like mad for two of them and then pull back a little . 
  the acceleration of thah porsche is just ridiculous . 
  on the straights in silveratone it looked like the audi was lmp2 . 
  and seb is at ferrari now . 
  hamilton and hamilton with team boss hamilton and driving whichever car hamilton wins in . 
  was looking for this . 
  am not disapointed . 
  * ooh baby you and me !, 
  * geraffes are so dumb *, 
  [ hamilton may have some competition ] ( http://imgur.com/a/kd3qe#20 ), 
  oh boy , 2 more days . 
  stream of consciousness , it 's perfect . 
  schumacher and schumacher, 
  do n't know why exactly , but the last ~ 3:30 minutes are pure eargasm to me ( as is the whole intrumental but that part in particular ) . 
  [ a v10 f1 car . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/ub_x502wqxm ), 
  wow , the second explosion is absolutely huge . 
  i do n't think i had seen it so far . 
  it was in my price range . 
  but i quickly removed it from my options . 
  well my current dell is n't in much better shape . 
  thing gets stupidly hot without being tortured . 
  nice , seems like we have similar total game time . 
  lol , yes . 
  seeing how many boxes i 've opened makes me want to cry . 
  well tapping is a significant part of my strategy , so i am used to it by now . 
  and about that tapping achievement . 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` 800,000 '' ) * hover over it *, 
  hmm , do the turbo miner 's taps count to the total . 
  i only used it once and did n't remember to check if it did . 
  thanks for the info .
