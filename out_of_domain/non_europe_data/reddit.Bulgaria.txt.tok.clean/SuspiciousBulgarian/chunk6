  turbo miner is quite good from my experience . 
  how many taps did it roughly add up to ? 
  this becomes even better when you consider that guude is of polish descent . 
  wow , nice explanation . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  forza multiplayer , bro !, 
  this is why i love this subreddit . 
  yes !, 
  this one . 
  it prevents it from being higher up on my list .

  is there a reversed version of this solo ? 
  i do n't think , i 've seen one around . 
  i once listened to it while being outside during a thunderstorm . 
  best decision i 've made recently . 
  thanks !, 
  or put the dt logo on a dark background .

  lol , sometimes i love the youtube comment section ... sometimes, 
  do you remember in which episode did he tell the story before ? 
  [ dream theater - a change of seasons ] ( https://youtu.be/mzkrwjzgg0k ) freaking 11/10 yet not so popular . 
  ( just guessing it may be the length ) it tells its story in an amazing way accompanied by the musical genius of the band members . 
  maldonator to haas confirmed !, 
  edit : / s, 
  try system of a down . 
  it is a beautiful moment when you first get into a band and start listening to everything they have put out , watch live stuff , read about them etc. 
  i first experienced it with soad a few years back and the second was with dt just over a year ago . 
  spotify made it easy for me providing their discography in an easy to listen to form . 
  i listen to dt everyday now ( was the same with soad ) and can say that i am lucky to have found a band with such diverse content . 
  same here , it is impressive actually . 
  i can also guess what time it is really accurately . 
  * it 's only just a dreaaaaam *, 
  i can make a droplet sound . 
  just add `` hamilton '' somewhere in the title next time . 
  that would do the job . 
  since we are on the `` please can anyone tell me what song this is '' vibe . 
  i would like to know if somebody recognises th backgorund music in this video, 
  lol , nice !, 
  nice !, 
  i think i only got it once . 
  recently i 've been on a roll of 18x production for 5 min . 
  edit 2 ( 28/08/2015 ), 
  here are my stats 15 days later . 
  since the first update i have gained :, 
  ~ 18 hours of play time, 
  ~ 2,700 boxes, 
  29 resets/reinvests, 
  it only takes obe letter . 
  edit : fuck it . 
  i 'm not fixing it . 
  i present to you : irony . 
  also , i hate touchscreen keyboards . 
  * be happy *, 
  let me word it this way . 
  i did not expect it . 
  true that . 
  ha , noice !, 
  i meant to say : `` it only takes one letter '' but then i hit the b button on my touchscreen without realising . 
  and it seems like i made a joke when in reality i just fucked up . 
  after that people proceed to bitch about the edits . 
  i 'm pretty sure the gold came a little after the edit . 
  i made it a semi-ninja edit after the first comment . 
  nah that would ruin it . 
  the original comment was an accident though . 
  * quite *, 
  which one ? 
  i do n't have autocorrect on . 
  i do n't really like it . 
  i would be pleased if the cars look like that . 
  [ dream theater - stream of consciousness ] ( https://youtu.be/gsonl0mzdfa ) . 
  it is absolutely beautiful . 
  metal/rock fans . 
  some of the friendliest people out there . 
  i agree fully with you . 
  the only thing that strange instrumental part in tcot does is to annoy me . 
  i am so sorry !, 
  the best of times is a solid song in my book . 
  gets the feels flowing . 
  once , and then repeat it literally a million times . 
  \u041eh , how i wish i had an xbox now .

  yes . 
  my hoverzoom does not approve of this . 
  lol , this is too good . 
  i actually would n't be mad if they played songs from bc&sl and adtoe ( depends on which songs though ) . 
  still better that the self titled . 
  * and no , i have never listened to my chemical romance *, 
  we should make our own f1 subreddit . 
  with blackjack and hookers . 
  ( * and direct images * ), 
  if f1 returns to turkey , i would probably be able to watch from my balcony how the mclarens and redbulls start .
