  yes i realise , it just sounded like the exhaust loops around to blow air over itself . 
  huh ? 
  look at my username . 
  i think the ducks should start a little later . 
  i like it . 
  this is slightly off-topic but would you be able to do the same with dreaming by system of a down ? 
  i think it is a little bit trickier there . 
  holy fuck , he looks like anders here . 
  yeah , i think that is going to flood the subreddit and i think all of us here listen to dt quite frequently . 
  rb should just ls swap their cars . 
  lucky man !, 
  i only found them ~ 1.5 year ago . 
  i give them one more chance with the new album . 
  i think that if it is similar to the self-titled i will lose some interest in the band in it 's current formation . 
  yup . 
  illumination theory is the only epuc i do n't like . 
  it just sounds like an unnecessary streched out song . 
  after seing wacken 2015 i started to lose hope honestly . 
  it only takes obe letter . 
  inb4 1 hour epic . 
  spotify is actually how i got into dt . 
  that glorious sdoit score track is pure eargasm . 
  to \u2260 too, 
  this happened to me with sdoit . 
  mainly with the second disc , although i quite like the glass prison and disappear . 
  this !, 
  i saw it a few days ago . 
  it 's like a whole new world . 
  that refference though . 
  i literally listened to octavarium a few minutes ago . 
  it 's not a bad song , but i must say i almost always skip it when it comes up . 
  y' know , got ta hate on him every chance you get . 
  i almost read that headline wrong . 
  hey now , mr. mercedes !, 
  best piece of commentary . 
  so smooth . 
  i have to say that i like stream of consciousness the most . 
  especially since a fellow redditor helped me understand it a bit more . 
  hey guys , anybody know which episode of uhc was when anders found chad ? 
  [ the story is here ] ( https://youtu.be/hitxwy6u61g?t=51m43s ), 
  lol thanks , man !, 
  i would love it being called lamborghini f1 . 
  with * verde ithaca * livery . 
  would like yellow too . 
  maybe even their orange . 
  just said verde as an example . 
  best : acos or in the name of god . 
  worst : maybe a rite of passage .
