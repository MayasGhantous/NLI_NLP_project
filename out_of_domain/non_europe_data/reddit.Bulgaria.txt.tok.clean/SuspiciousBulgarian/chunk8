  the way you think . 
  i like it . 
  we are all that way . 
  this is the best interview i have watched recently . 
  that it does n't suck balls . 
  i do n't think that would be a good idea . 
  the story has its end and adding onto it will only make it worse . 
   i want a return to the train of thought state of mind . 
  amen, 
  this is so cool . 
  i should get myself something similar . 
  i just love how in one of the first episodes pyro said :, 
  * guude is your best friend but he is going to double-cross you like a friggin ... 
  pastry . 
  edit : [ link ] ( https://youtu.be/ggnnh2us4zw?t=21m2s ), 
  you could say its ... out of this world . 
  even if you know nothing about formula 1 it is still a great story . 
  the final 10 minutes are heart breaking . 
  i click my jaw waaaay too much . 
  it started with once every now and then and now i am afraid that one day my jaw will just give up and break . 
  yes . 
  the pain . 
  and that part under the chin where the pain is gets really hard . 
  hey !, 
  its not that bad ... well , kinda . 
  i have not seen that one . 
  damn ... but then again , its bulgarian so ... 
  a masterpiece with a weird-ass keyboard part . 
  i think that it fits that part of the song really well . 
  a good end to the build-up leading up to it . 
  listened to intervals when i was out during a spectacular lightning storm ... such a magical moment . 
  i thought that was the whole idea . 
  '' * witness meeeeeee !!!!, 
  i miss him . 
  my man !, 
  you know , that helmet would have been handy on his head isntead in his hand in this situation . 
  i hope it 's not metropolis pt .3 . 
  if it is a `` second '' tot though , i am going to be a happy man . 
  hmm , this may actualy make sense . 
  it could be that it tells a story from two viewpoints . 
   it 'll be post-apocalyptic and * awesome * . 
  let 's not get ahead of things . 
  so you saw `` the mika '' . 
  so there was a gp in my country and i missed it ? 
  [ reporter turns ghetto in 3 seconds ] ( https://youtu.be/bus6nkpddec ), 
  i saw that video last week and could n't work out why it sounded similar . 
  and now i know . 
  i bet it is . 
  * learning to live, 
  * under a glass moon, 
  awake :, 
  * the mirror, 
  * voices, 
  sfam :, 
  * fatal tragedy, 
  * beyond this life, 
  sdoit, 
  * about to crash, 
  * losing time, 
  tot, 
  * stream of consciousness, 
  * in the name of god, 
  * these walls, 
  systematic chaos, 
  * in the presence of enemies i and ii, 
  * a nightmare to remember, 
  * the shattered fortress, 
  * this is the life, 
  * breaking all illusions, 
  dream theater, 
  * the enemy inside, 
  * surrender to reason, 
  well , i have not lsitened to most of wdadu and fii , so i decided not to include songs from there . 
  though i really like a fortune in lies ( with jlb singing ) . 
  it 's a shame it is only 2 songs because i really like to listen to vacant , stream of consciousness and in the name of god in order . 
  last ~ minute and a half of stream of consciousness ... dear god, 
  such a good song . 
  i like how in the live version jlb comes in later . 
  beat me two it . 
  both combos are amazing . 
  is n't that last part with the hypnotherapist from the intro of finally free ? 
  yup .
