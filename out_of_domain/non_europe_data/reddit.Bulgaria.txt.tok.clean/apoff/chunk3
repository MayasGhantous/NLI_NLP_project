  imagine you want rows that look a lot like :, 
  item [ r1 ], 
  item [ r2 ], 
  item [ r3 ], 
  maybe you want to copy paste the text the desired number of times , then hit insert and just press number , down arrow , number , down arrow ... 
  just an example . 
  okay , bad example . 
  try thinking that you would like to edit these numbers . 
  i need to to this almost every day . 
  insert key has a purpose , get over it . 
  me and two friends of mine were going home . 
  there were plenty of hookers on the sidewalk , so we decided to just talk with one of them . 
  me : hey , how much for a blowjob ? 
  she : i am not working sweetie, 
  me : ok , but how much anyways ? 
  she : 15 bucks for a bj , 30 for sex, 
  me : do i have a limited time , or you just suck it until i come ? 
  she : look , i am not working right now, 
  me : maybe we can give you a ride to the city, 
  she : thanks , but my _ husband _ is coming to pick me up . 
  ** edit **, 
  we imagined what the hooker and her husband are talking about :, 
  he : how was your day babe ? 
  she : you know , the usual ... like 30 turkish truck drivers who wanted anal , some romanians , a couple of greeks ... 
  actually , that 's local currency . 
  if you convert it to usd it 's about $ 20 , but we 're talking about the cheapest hookers , and most of them are old , ugly gypsies . 
  normal/good looking white girls start from $ 50 , but that 's also cheap ... 
  [ ** op 's face when i actually do it .
