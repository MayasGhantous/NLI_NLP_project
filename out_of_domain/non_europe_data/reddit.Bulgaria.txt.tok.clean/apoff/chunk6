  defib should have some delay . . 
  he was killed by a support class with the mid pick-up sniper . 
  in no way i 'm trying to underestimate his achievement , but this guy plays mostly with vehicles , which kind of helps with the k/d ratio . 
  i 'm an avid scout helicopter and attack jet pilot , so the last thing i 'll do its cry about vehicles .

  damn , that 's some impressive camera work !, 
  it zooms out in exactly the right moment .

  you can pretty much land on any kind-of-flat surface . 
  eh , i guess your eyes are too lazy to spot it . 
  the dude with the shades, 
  i hope i 'm not too late for the party , because i really would like to get a key , 
  aww yiss !, 
  thanks a ton man !, 
  there is no vootry .

  - custom built dac based on pcm2706 burr brown . 
  thd+n : 90db , snr : 100db, 
  - yamaha a700 , works at class a the first 5 watts, 
  - superlux hd681 evo, 
  rip in peace, 
  why would you need that ? 
  they cost 120k , look futuristic and are reviewed on wired . 
  definitely the real shit . 
  diy dallas ii horns with fostex 207e . 
  sounds much better than a lot of ridiculously overpriced `` high end '' speakers .

  he said he overdid it on purpose . 
  ** eastern ** , goddammit . 
  i 'm pretty sure you only kind of want to learn how to do it . 
  the driver actually pushed another biker few minutes after that and was later arrested .

  you connect via a [ 3270 terminal emulator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3270_emulator ) and stare at the black and white screen until your eyes bleed . 
  it 's mostly used for batch processing and transaction management . 
  huge part of the scripts ( aka jobs ) that run on it are written 10-20 years ago .

  i am a bit afraid to express my honest opinion in this sub , but i really think these speakers are a fucking joke and somebody is laughing their ass off while making money selling them . 
  they look even more ridiculous on the inside , with all the r2d2/transformers moving parts that make little to no sense at all . 
  protected by 88 patents :d and the first thing you see on their web site is the rms power ... 750 watts - 99db . 
  congrats , any half-decent speaker can create the same spl at 10 watts , some need even less than that . 
  but hey , watts matter , right ? 
  watts is like the opposite of gluten , the more you get - the better . 
  i seriously consider unsubscribing from / r/audiophile for good . 
  huge amount of the posts show overpriced , over engineered equipment with futuristic design , tons of digital processors that `` enhance '' the sound and countless patents with funky names . 
  usually in rooms without a single piece of sound absorbing materials . 
  i apologize / u/skyo4 , i did n't mean to offend you personally by bashing the equipment you 've chosen . 
  you really should n't care about some internet stranger 's opinion , it is what you hear and enjoy that matters . 
  you 're are right though - i have n't heard them , but that does n't mean i ca n't judge them by the information i have . 
  so these little fellas produce 3000 watts and weight 11 kilos each . 
  correct me if i am wrong , but that should mean they are powered by a class d amplifier and that alone should be enough to end the discussion whether or not this could be considered audiophile equipment . 
  i wo n't even bring the subject of wireless connectivity , online music streaming and the tons of digital processing . 
  in audio , less is more . 
  the long driver excursion , well known for creating distortion ( bigger part of the coil leaving the magnetic gap = less control ) , and the driver inefficiency that forces class d power amplification , also known for adding distortion and noise ( due to the constant switching of the transistors ) , are the reasons i do not believe those speakers perform . 
  their design and overall marketing is what makes them a joke in my eyes . 
  i am well aware of hoffman 's iron law though , after all i do own 250 liters ( 8.8 cubic feet ) diy horns and i do plan to build even bigger ones as soon as i move into a house . 
  speculative or not this what most russians on the internet suggest - bomb ankara , kick turkey out of nato ( like they have a mechanism to do it ) , deploy sam sites in syria and down every turkish plane and etc and etc. 
  also , this a just a comic - do n't take it too seriously . 
  nato and russia have very different plans for the middle east, 
  he actually got it back, 
  zero ducks given, 
  to be honest , the picture is taken in vietnam - either hanoi or ho chi mihn . 
  you look like an avid / r/emacs user . 
   those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it . 
  i was referring to the general population that let him gain so much power . 
  nope , unless you 're going to a psychedelic trance music festival .

   evidences, 
  ftfy, 
  ** edit ** : for those missing the reference - russians on the internet often ask for `` proofs '' of military involvement in ukraine , hence the `` evidences '' joke . 
  it 's called `` new god '', 
  the cheaper `` redmi '' line use poor cameras . 
  the flagship `` mi '' series have much better cameras , however they 're still lagging behind iphones and galaxies . 
  limited availability and warranty complications when buying from china is people 's main concern . 
  other than that - 9/10 , would buy again . 
  in daylight - yeah , in low light conditions it sucks big time . 
  you can get it fixed or replaced , however the processes is a bit unpleasant due to shipping times and etc. 
  it 's not like you can go to the local mi store and just deal with it ... 
  plastic tits are plastic . 
  does the chinese supplier ship the products to amazon for you ? 
  who deals with customs , if at all ? 
  thanks !, 
  what was you initial investment and how did your profits grew ? 
  how long until you 've sold it ?
