  fuck incontrol , seriously . 
  not because he 's fat or whatever but just because he performs terribly but keeps talking about himself as he is on one level with the other pros . 
  please forgive me if i have offended players you like < 3, 
  before the lotv beta for sure !, 
  they thould totally pretherve hith lithp !, 
  i remember this . . 
  i was 10 and had just started being fascinated by the amazing almost unbelievable at the time world of computer games . 
  i would go to a local internet cafe owned by the mother of a classmate and i would play for an hour every day with my lunch money . 
  the rest of the day i would just watch the `` big guys '' ( who were probably like 15 ) and be amazed at their `` level of play '' ( expanding more than once and playing on maps where the resources ended without cheat codes ), 
  my eyes just teared up with the nostalgia , hold on ... 
  also the three gg buttons . 
  he 's just scared ;d, 
  every bulgarian starcraft fan probably watched this . 
  for a second there i believed nothing could stop our boy jack from making a huge upset but sen is sen. big game !, 
  in bulgaria we say `` eyes out of my bowl man ! '', 
  i shit you not !, 
  for some reason i personally would rather have only the sigil of one of the major houses ( my favorite whether its stark or whatever ) and for the other shields i would put their sworn bannermen 's coats of arms . 
  kick-ass !, 
  i read the geyjoy one `` we do not buy '' and laughed a lot more than i would have if i had read it right though ;p, 
  came here to say this because i was sure somebody said that . 
  uptoked both . 
  easy smokin ', 
  i had very mellow trips with salvia 8-9 times before but yesterday i had a bad salvia trip and it was shockingly similar to yours . 
  the pages/layers especially . 
  i think you took too much . 
  i have smoked salvia leaves , 10x and 15x extract , but yesterday i hit a pretty big bowl of x20 and i was no longer `` in control '' of my trip . 
  i would suggest you find the courage to try half the dose you took before you all out give up on salvia :  cheers !, 
  this . 
  happened yesterday 1:1 . 
  if the lighting where you intend to show it happens to be the same as the lighting where you took your picture , at the very least when people take photos of you , you will appear as pink as you do in the op . 
  i would deff make it a bit darker just to be safe . 
  came here to say this . 
  also to add 18 more ! s : !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  so here comes the inevitable question :, 
  who would win in a battle scenario ? 
  the 25 000 readers of this subreddit armed with whatever knowledge they have of the asoiaf world plus all the modern weaponry they could get their hands on irl within 24 hours or whichever actual asoiaf army ( [ general book ] ( / b `` lannister host , renly host , robb host , daenerys host , mance host '' ) ) at their strongest in the books ( yes that includes [ general book ] ( / b `` dragons/giants '' ) or whatever else stuff i might have not read about yet since i have just only started affc ), 
  tittie e-sports ?!, 
  mega troll detected, 
  does the eating utensil look more like a slice of green pepper to anyone else ? 
  in bulgaria $ 20 per gram of dank is considered `` standard '' . 
  * braces himself grabbing his desk *, 
  replace `` take a drink '' with `` take a bong hit '' and `` finish your drink '' with `` smoke a full bowl '' . 
  also play the got ost in the background . 
  so doing this with friends soon : , 
  i know it 's in bulgarian and most of you wo n't be able to understand what he says but i think the video speaks for itself . 
  let us not stand by while people 's lives are destroyed for minor drug-related offenses !, 
  you , sir , are a true scholar . 
  might we see a chipp , a ky and a sol please ? 
  i really believe that although very accurate-looking , the map you have chosen is kind of plain and barren . 
  i am pretty sure most of the readers know these places . 
  just to give my 2 cents - what i am looking for in a map would be :, 
  - accuracy ( check ), 
  - fine details + things that are kind-of-spoilers but you could n't possibly identify them as spoilers until you have read that far . 
  ( craster 's hut with a drawing of it and no text , for example ) ( take for example this map http://www.fanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/westeros.jpg ), 
  - political boundaries of the seven kingdoms ( http://gameofthrones.net/images/westeros_maps/map_westeros_political.gif ), 
  - minor house sigils and their seats . 
  also maybe the rest of the world of asoiaf ? 
  that would be sweet , 
  i used to work at be * 's support center for uk . 
  it is actually outsourced in bulgaria and all the customer support of be * is getting taken care of by bulgarian agents . 
  i even know iana and vassil . 
  this made my day , 
  you should make it stark and have it say `` explorer is coming '', 
  also you could look into an app called bootskin , 
  although that 's very true , i myself would be very interested in looking over a complete verified table of pro 's gear . 
  i am sure there will be interesting tendencies if it is big enough and updated . 
  i am supposed to be shipping out razer and steelseries gaming peripherals , but whenever there are no orders i just read reddit < 3, 
  best job ever . 
  i can also smoke ciggs and trees at my desk . . shit is sweet !, 
  upvoted for mutas :d, 
  logo looks like colossus coming out of a portal . 
  uhm ... may i ask for the band/song name please ? 
  heh ... hui means dick in my language :d, 
  also - dubstep breaks !, 
  the 15 minute one i could write a book about - with the club , and the old guy , and the lots of chicks at a table . 
  indeed they were quite hot , if i can say . 
  i do n't know what 's real any more ; <, 
  almost - bulgarian ,

  words are wind is badass as fuck for a tat . 
  get it in your standard handwriting so it reminds you that people are full of shit . 
  goddamn paper named `` stanart '' in my area - it has fucked my spelling of that word forever . 
  thank you for pointing it out - i really need to work on that , english is my third language , but i 'm trying ,

  what instant messenger do you use so we can stay in touch ? 
  pmed you, 
  i nudged my gf who is a reader and made a face at her when he said that . 
  non-reader friend noticed .
