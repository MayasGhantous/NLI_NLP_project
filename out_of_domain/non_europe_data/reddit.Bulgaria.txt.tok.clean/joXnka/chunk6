  i am somebody who is apparently about to suffer from tooth-related tragedy ama . 
  source : shit diet , soda all the time , smoke anything that can be lit on fire . 
  this is so real : v, 
  for sure !, 
  started on the pc port of guilty gear x. 
  got really good playing with a kbd . 
  do n't wan na start using a controller . 
  i 've played gg on a keyboard my entire life and i am godlike at it . 
  even stood up to high tournament players . 
  ca n't change now . 
  i 'm very firm with this . 
  just need a way to make it happen with xrd . 
  help . 
  nope ... 
  i use my right hand to walk ( numpad 8 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) and use the 6 keys above the arrow keys for attacks . 
  yea it 's weird but that 's the only way i wan na play . 
  i 've been playing gg on a kbd for as long as ggx got ported . 
  i 've owned gg games on ps2 and psp , but i 've never been able to become nealy as good as with a kbd . 
  funny thing is i play tekken and soul calibur ok with a controller , and obviously use it a controller for stuff like the souls games , but gg is kbd only for me . 
  not trolling at all . 
  i need this . 
  yea it was such a letdown , since i asked around a lot and almost everywhere i was told everything but what i was looking for . 
  everyone i speak to about this is dead set on persuading me against it for some reason . 
  it 's very strange . 
  thanks for your comment . 
  do you know if they would custom me one out of a keyboard ? 
  hey man !, 
  i figured it out . 
  i ordered a xim4 off ebay and it worked . 
  it 's made to use mouse and keyboard and uses profiles in the app thingy . 
  they never imagined somebody would use only the keyboard part but it works . 
  there is no noticable input lag . 
  1ms tops . 
  9/10 would recommend . 
  i am now learning the new chipp with one hand and fapping with the other : v, 
  sorry for potato phone quality ; <, 
  yea when i stream it comes down to my face . . probably had to shoot it that way . . 
  but when not streaming i just keep it up there so it 's out of the way . 
  one of the pluses of the flexible arm . 
  my bad . 
  not really , no ... yet . 
  27 atm, 
  same user , yea . 
  twitch.tv / joxnka, 
  i stream mostly in bulgarian though . 
  tv turns to the side and a bunch of people can watch tv/anime and lay around . 
  you 're not my donation supervisor !, 
  better than making it heil ? 
  it was a ea dino game with a similar concept . 
  some drama ensued within the team . 
  somebody poof-ed with the money . 
  steam took it down . 
  ea games lost face . 
  now we get glasses . 
  not sure if i 'll wear them proudly . 
  more like a dunce hat : v, 
  hue hue, 
  i think screenshots are ok . a lot of people rarely go outside ; /, 
  bulgarian, 
  care to share the track name ( s ) ? 
  that 's some sweet dnb !, 
  how do we at least log a user out , so we can manually authenticate the next ? 
  currently we ca n't get the shift + t field to show up . 
  what file do i need to remove form the computer to `` unbind '' teeboard from the logged in channel ( the one that displays top left of teeboard ) , so that it 's in it 's default state ( no channel logged in ), 
  i was able to use manual auth in that situation , but not with the channel already logged in . 
  tried uninstalling teeboard and air and clearing registry , but when i reisntall , the wrong channel is still logged in . 
  can we unlog the channel in any way right now ? 
  thank you for the hype < 3, 
  will do !, 
  but do come and tell him yourself as well - twitch accounts are free !, 
  please link me to that thread and i will at least make sure wayne sees it . 
  if there 's a lot maybe i 'll be able to convince him to do it into a youtube thing or something . 
  this will be done and i will link to it in this thread as a reply to this comment as soon as it is uploaded !, 
  stream is live @ http://www.twitch.tv/limbobulgaria, 
  this is the twitch vod . 
  a youtube highlight will be available as well at some point . 
  vod from stream is up on twitch @ http://www.twitch.tv/limbobulgaria/v/43609143, 
  just a little something i figured out yesterday :, 
  if you highlight an item in your inventory and press c the highlighted item will get zoomed into the center of the screen and you will be able to click-drag it to inspect it . 
  happy skyriming < 3, 
  greetings bapc ,, 
  i am somebody who has always built their own pc 's , but i have n't had the money to assemble a new rig in quite a few years and i find myself a little behind in current hardware trends . 
  i have a number of questions regarding the build i am about to attempt . 
  firstly though :, 
  - money is not an issue , but i wo n't overspend on lc and such . 
  - i intend to use the machine primarily for 1920x1080 gaming while streaming , but i might also need it to be able to take some audio/video editing and possibly a bit of 3d design . 
  - i will not be using any leftover components from previous computers . 
  - i live in bulgaria . 
  ( so if it is possible , i would appreciate it if you give a couple of alternatives when recommending hardware , because the one you suggested might not be available here . ), 
  ( i am probably going to get the parts , or at least those that i need and they have , from this store : http://www.cmm.bg/cgi-bin/most/pricelist.pl since i have a preferred rate there ), 
  now for my specific questions :, 
  - for the ** processor ** , i have decided to get an i7 . 
  how big exactly is the difference performance-wise between the lower-tier and higher-tier i7 cpu 's ? 
  which one would you suggest for my needs ? 
  - what is a good asus mobo for my i7 ? 
  i was looking at the mobo comparisons on the asus site and i saw a few motherboard parameters i 'm not sure i understand : under the ** memory ** section it usually says something along the lines of * `` 6 x dimm , max . 
  24gb , ddr3 2200 ( o.c. ) / 2133 ( o.c. ) / 2000 ( o.c. ) / 1800 ( o.c. ) / 1600 ( o.c. 
  ) / 1333/1066 '' * does that mean that i need to overclock my system in order to be able to use my memory at 1600 hz ? 
  also under the ** storage ** section i see * `` 6 x sata 3gb/s port ( s ) and 2 x sata 6gb/s port ( s ) '' * it also says the 6gb/s ports are only for data hard drives and not for atapi devices . 
  does all this mean that i can use the two 6gb/s ports to connect a 1tb hdd and a 64gb ssd and be ok ?
