  is it smart to use these 2 ports at all ? 
  is there a reason there is only 2 of them ? 
  wo n't the double bandwidth of these ports be a neat performance boost ? 
  - i have had a lot of temperature troubles in previous builds and i would like to ask what you guys suggest i get for a ** cpu cooler ** . 
  i am willing to spend above average for the cooler because i have decided against liquid cooling and i really want to make sure the cpu is being cooled very well . 
  - for ** memory ** i 'm thinking 2x4g ddr3 1600g hiperf a-data . 
  please let me know if that is a poor choice and suggest a better one if it is . 
  - ** storage ** - wise i was thinking of just any 1tb hdd and a sdd for the os . 
  you can suggest good brands if you feel they make a difference . 
  - when it comes to the ** graphics card ** , i have always used nvidia cards , but i am not sure whether or not i want to continue to do so ( my last card was a 8800gtx that i bought days after it was released and failed a few weeks ago ) . 
  i am not sure if i need cuda . 
  i want to make sure that i will be able to see the best quality image whenever i am playing or watching 1080p video . 
  what card or combination of cards would you recommend i get ? 
  i have been eying the hd6990 for some reason . . 
  - i decided i 'll get the haf x ** case ** recommended by this subreddit so you guys will probably agree with that . 
  - lastly , what kind of wattage should i get my ** power supply ** at ? 
  i like those colorful tx power supplies . 
  are they any good ? 
  i hope i asked all the questions i was thinking of asking . 
  i will update if i remember anything else . 
  sorry for the extremely long post and thanks in advance for all your help < 3, 
  me and a friend were wondering if ther is an updated version of this table somewhere : http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/pro_gear, 
  if not , we were wondering if someone is up for creating an up-to-date table that we keep updated forward in time . 
  so my friends and i saw this gif today and we have been arguing for almost an hour now about what would happen to a person standing/laying there where he car is . 
  thread - http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/12q6vr/touchless_carwash_thatll_buff_right_out/, 
  some non-conclusive debate on the question - http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/12q6vr/touchless_carwash_thatll_buff_right_out/c6x9ldc, 
  i tried to look for a similar discussion somewhere but to no avail . 
  please excuse me if i am in any breach of this fine subreddit by posting our question in this manner and thank you for your time . 
  hey everyone !, 
  had an amazing time playing the beta this weekend !, 
  preordered and ca n't wait for the game . 
  one thing that i really want to see ( apart from how the game looks through an oculus rift ) is whether or not it would be possible to use our secondary displays for `` map screens '' . 
  basically i have an older 19 inch 4:3 monitor ( 1280x1024 ) that is connected to my gaming pc and i usually use it for reddit/chats while gaming . 
  what i 'm suggesting is figuring out a way to have the mega map ( the one that shows up when you press the map key ( default m ) ) appear at all times on the secondary display . 
  i find that a `` mini-map '' rarely helps me as much as the large map does , and having the large map visible at all times would prove extremely valuable !, 
  so what do you guys think ? 
  can it be done ? 
  has it been done in other mmo games ? 
  has it been done with mods/addons/hacks ? 
  ( is such a thing legal ), 
  do you assume such a thing is going to be available for teso ? 
  would you use it if it was made available ? 
  hey everyone !, 
  i want to re-kindle a discussion that i tried to start some time ago on this subreddit . 
  basically i have an older 19 inch 4:3 monitor ( 1280x1024 ) that is connected to my gaming pc and i usually use it for reddit/chats while gaming , and i am sure many of you also have some form of secondary display . 
  what i 'm suggesting is figuring out a way to have the mega map ( the one that shows up when you press the map key ( default m ) ) appear at all times on the secondary display . 
  i find that a `` mini-map '' rarely helps me as much as the large map does , and having the large map visible at all times would prove extremely valuable !, 
  also , i totally hate having to stop running in order to look at the map . 
  i tend to get disoriented a lot because i look at all the things and i have to constantly pull up the map smacked right in the center of my screen . 
  i do n't wan na pull the `` immersion-breaking '' card , but i really think the flow of the game would be much more enjoyable for me if i could slightly glance to the side instead of hit a key in order to look at the map . 
  so what do you guys think ? 
  does it sound cool ? 
  can it be done ? 
  has it been done in other mmo games ? 
  has it been done with mods/addons/hacks ? 
  ( is such a thing legal ), 
  do you assume such a thing is going to be available for teso ? 
  would you use it if it was made available ? 
  disclaimer - the map in question does not show any extra information that might give the player an edge . 
  greetings , everyone !, 
  introduction **, 
  first of all let me introduce myself - i am former eu ep officer joxnka and as of today i will be functioning as guild master for the eu ep side of the reddit guild . 
  i 've been a hardcore gamer and competitive esport player for as long as i can remember and i have also worked a lot in the gaming industry . 
  i tend to say some pretty distasteful things at times but i am all about helping my guildmates and trying to better each player in the guild so i am sure we will get along just fine !, 
  ever since the game came out i have n't read a lot of reddit , and for those who are like me i will summarize the most important pieces of information that you ( as an eu ep player ) probably wan na be aware of . 
  reddit guild structure **, 
  reddit operates a total of six official guilds ( one per faction per server ) . 
  on each server there are three reddit guilds out of which one is the main guild . 
  in our case that is the eu ad guild . 
  every member of the eu ep guild has to join the ad guild as well ( the same goes for the eu dc guild as well ) ( you do not need to have an ad character ! ), 
  ** iii . 
  banking **, 
  the eu reddit players across all three factions have decided it is best to have a centralized ad bank ( which is in part the reason everyone needs to join the ad guild ) . 
  in other words , all eu reddit guild members all be using the ad guild bank and guild store regardless of what faction they are playing . 
  depositing - you all have the permissions to and are encouraged to deposit all materials and valuable items in the ad bank . 
  when you do that , guild-appointed bank-officers will make note of your donation and award you with points . 
  withdrawing - when you would like something trivial ( cheaper than 1k ) that is available in the bank just tell any officer ( ep/ad ) or me and they will send it to you when they next use the bank . 
  when you would like something more expensive ( motifs and such ) it would be depending on your points . 
  generally this has never been a problem - it seems redditors are very generous people and we have never had any bank-related drama on the eu side of the guild this far . 
  events **, 
  depending on the level of interest that you guys show , i will be organizing anything between one and four weekly guild events . 
  best case scenario we will have one open pvp event , one hardcore pvp event , one pve ( dungeoning ) event and one pvp `` training '' event per week , but that all depends on your interest !, 
  what i need from you guys right now is everyone reading this post a reply to this thread and in your reply include which days are the best for you to get together with your guild and play and at what time would you be ready to start ( end time is whenever you want to leave but start time is much more important ) . 
  please post the times in central european time . 
  ** v. voice communication **, 
  this is probably my largest concern . 
  need . 
  all . 
  mumble . 
  and if not all of us , then at the very least half of the online players need to be in mumble . 
  currently at the writing of this post there are 3 out of 19 online members in mumble . 
  this is not gon na work . 
  you all need to install and get on mumble !, 
  i will now address some common issues :, 
  - `` i do n't like mumble !, 
  ts is better ! '', 
  i totally agree with you , my homie !, 
  but unfortunately mumble has been already established as the choice for voice-comms for all of the reddit guilds and it is not something i am interested in battling right now . 
  mumble thankfully has all the basic functionality needed from a voice-comms software to provide adequate communnication between members aka it 's good enough !, 
  ( so install that shit !!! ),
