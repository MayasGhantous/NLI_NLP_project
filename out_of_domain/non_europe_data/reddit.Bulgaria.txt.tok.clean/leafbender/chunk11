  it wasnt a speed sketch , he is just a dps . 
  do n't worry - this new wod expansion looks promising . 
  i ca n't wait to have my own garrison !, 
  people go to hell for that !, 
  thats why he is here ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  his enemy should 've played around that ... 
  should 've played around gnoll ant ... 
  blood elfs have green eyes that came from the consuming of fel magic , it 's not just the name ... 
  kinda looks like boobs, 
  20 seconds in and i already lost again ... 
   he started off by taunting the ** moose ** by , as far as i remember , throw a rock ( pebble ) at it , to get it 's attention away from his sister ) , the ** bear ** was attacking . 
  i 've been watching forsen 's stream for over 20 years and i can tell you that this is infact a real reaction . 
  uh yes it is ? 
  you can go play on a private server and its not just the nostalgia , its a whole other game , much better than retail is now . 
  pff i had one and i sold it for like 1 euro and few cents ... we all make mistakes i guess :d, 
  have n't paid much attention last few sales but did n't they remove all the flash , daily and whatever sales they were and all the sales stay the same from the beginning to the very end without any changes ? 
  thank god !, 
  thought no one else noticed this shit !, 
  well ^ it ^ kinda ^ ^ was, 
  also its free if you have skyrim already , works only for pc tho . 
  or you can buy them for less from the store ... 
  but its shitposting time ** all ** the time, 
  so like many other nations that took part in the wwi ? 
  my country had an army of 1,200,000 out of population of 4,280,000 , yet i do n't expect it to show in the game . 
  france on the other had should by all means be part of the base game and usa shoulnd ' t even be a dlc before all the rest europeans countries are already in the game, 
  when did ragnaros attack stormwind ? 
  while being the most powerful of the elemental lord he never came close to `` attacking azeorth '' . 
  other than his offensive on mount hyjal he did n't really do much and even there he was quickly banished to the elemental planes and later defeated there too . 
  it shows a world corrupted by the old gods , did someone really thought it was something other than an ad for the current expansion ? 
  is n't that the whole point of anon ? 
  that 's a nice ship you got there captain !, 
  ... captain ? 
  stop paying big money for jpgs !, 
  earth mage is so 2016,

  lady liadrin is a blood knight and those are enemies of the silver hand and even had quests to kill silver hand npcs in wow ( the paladin in the stratholme church iirc ), 
  i came for laughs not feels ... 
  me too thanks, 
  just by hearing this idea i got confused , disenchanted all my cards , deleted hs and installed windows 10 by mistake ... 
  you really seem to miss the point of his comment . 
  if he tells you what to invest in everybody else will see it and invest in it too rendering the whole thing useless ... 
  he is a good firefighter tho ... 
  also most of hearthstone art comes from the wow tcg, 
  me too thanks,

  current invesments got rekt , but i won enough to get myself a gaming laptop so its all fine, 
   hidden values representing the strength of a pokemon . 
  attack , defense and stamina, 
  dragonfable is also made with kids in mind but that did n't stop them to make you execute children hostages ( even tho your allies did , not you but still ), 
  breadgasm, 
  [ reminds me of this skyrim classic !,

  just go forward in all your beliefs and prove to me that i am not mistaken in mine . 
  - team purple, 
  a money !, 
  library was in payback yes !, 
  there are nagas in warcraft as early ( or even earlier than ) as warcraft iii ( 2002 ), 
  hi-c what you did there . 
  well it was easier for us to go back in time to retrieve an ancient artefact that can kill all dragons instead of sending an expedition to retrieve a hammer . 
  are we talking about the same trump here ? 
  rip nostalrius, 
  [ wow in china for those who are wondering ] ( https://imgur.com/a/vf3eq ), 
  pretty sure you are heading to the strand of ancients tho ... 
  damn those na people ... 
  anything, 
  rip scorpibro , you fought bravely biblethump, 
  rats vs crab wasnt a fair fight , thats why it was disgusting dansgame, 
  that used to be a good stream in the good old days few hours ago , but then the pvp got really bad and the matchmaking was awful , with white rat being 2op4me and in the leastest patch they removed the rats and replaced the with a hamster which is not op at all and lets say it , its boring, 
  oh god all the dispelling, 
  like half of the giant lobster mobs are listed as humanoids,
