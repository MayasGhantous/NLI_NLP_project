  did you use the same password on other private servers ? 
  fifty degrees of gray !, 
  he commited suicide after finding his wife was killed so they can be together !, 
  read the article on wowwiki for the honor system to see why asking for how much honor you need for x rank isnt a good idea, 
  tbh scams like that are against the tos so the risk/reward ratio for just 20 gold makes it not worth it , nonetheless its not like 200g will work either and even if it does its still against the rules . 
  back to war3, 
  the realm elysium has ~ 8k pop , there are three other realms that are all 2,5 k + get your facts straight, 
  its the human nature, 
  silent majority you mean ? 
  can we talk about turtles instead , i like turtles !, 
  ~ ~ i do n't need help , i just want the cold embrace of death ... ~ ~, 
  me too thanks, 
  does blinking count as being in a coma ? 
  well he needs help ...

  yeah im not sure what op wants tbh, 
  *** slides 10 credits ***, 
  make it one !, 
  happens waaay to often man ... 
  the road your father and i walked together is soaked deeply with the blood of both friends and enemies . 
  big if true, 
  damn thats a long one !, 
  it 's about sending the message, 
  id suggest you wait for 3.0 to be released , im sure they will do a free-flight week then and you will be able to test the game for free and decide yourself it its worth it, 
  come to brazil !, 
  what the fuck, 
  too late he is gone :(, 
  wait ... it is n't ? 
  oh thank god , was worried there for a second !, 
  its treason then, 
  zeth ` kur *** realm *** review, 
  i 'm pretty sure they are just doing it for the karma, 
  i 'm sorry , sir . 
  it 's time for you to leave, 
  big is true, 
  where can i check which ones are discontinued ? 
  me to thanks, 
  i know this is just for karmawhoring but if you really wants to achieve this you must upload the image to imgur instead of reddit , else it doesnt count, 
   24 years of reddit gold, 
  what the fuck, 
  reminds me of people screaming that the new x game will kill world of warcraft, 
  yes , check the citizencon footage , we will get that on multiple plantes . 
  the *** realm *** named elysium ... ffs, 
  yeah it 's like saying you need to buy 4k euro worth of dlcs to play train simulator on steam, 
  while we are on it i 'd like to ask something - i 've noticed that most ( all ? ), 
  of the cases that are n't dropping are given [ a list of skins ] ( http://i.imgur.com/okzufok.png ) they drop while the newer cases [ do n't have such a list ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oreobjp.png ) . 
  are the skins listed later onces the cases ceases to drop ? 
  its one of the two fonts i had on my samsung tbh, 
  its treason then !, 
  you want to know why i love dat boi ? 
  dat boi is a completely self-made meme . 
  so many other memes are based in nostalgic childrens shows , funny faces , relatable situations , or references . 
  not dat boi . 
  dat boi is completely absurd . 
  it 's a low-res frog on a unicycle , and an arbitrary method for greeting him . 
  the first person to ever upvote dat boi did not do so out of recognition . 
  the first person to ever upvote dat boi did not do so because a pre-existing meme format . 
  the first person to ever upvote dat boi upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower . 
  dat boi is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it . 
  i will always upvote dat boi , o shit waddup !, 
  thanks for the info !, 
  we should faq post like the one on / r/csgomarketforum / saying which cases are still dropping and which arent dropping anymore . 
  hello 2016, 
  what will happen if a fully loaded hull e tries to land on a planet ? 
  will it crash and litter the surface with its containers . 
  id love to watch that happen !, 
  feed your pet, 
  atleast go with imgur for those shitposts, 
  tbh if the quantity of items is small enough those hype waves can permanently raise the prise due to the fact that no new items can appear and lower it back . 
  ( unless ofc someone who is hoarding them doesnt decides to sell ), 
  aurora power, 
  ... wait, 
  big if true, 
  the realm is dying , the server is doing fine, 
  i 'd be really disappointed if they do n't add this into the game , even at its current state its a nice addition to the game . 
  public test universe . 
  its also know as public test server or public test realm in other games, 
  big if true, 
  the hell is that ? 
  back in vanilla when there were pvp ranks only those who had an officer rank or above could enter those halls . 
  someone call pence !, 
   *** only *** the sith deal in *** absolutes ***, 
  its the ** abomination **, 
  plenty of private servers, 
  waddle ... on ... t.t, 
  not from a jedi, 
  how to stop this annoying shit ? 
  aight cheers, 
  aight , thanks for the info !, 
  its treason then, 
  screw the rules !, 
  its a word that says jedi right side up and evil upside down . 
  from anakins pov its evil , obi-wan its jedi, 
  ironic, 
  this is our destiny !, 
  bulgarian heart has yellow spots on its white part, 
  [ :( ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/raining_david_tennant.gif ), 
  tbh if someone that wo n't be able to beat the shit out of me does this to me id totally do the same as op, 
  yeah same here . 
  it really does look like an idris for a moment .
