  so will my broken arm fully heal after 10 years or something ? 
  back off mom !, 
  big if true, 
  the last one was really meh if you ask me, 
  [ only 4 other orders are known out of the 150 ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/contingency_orders_for_the_grand_army_of_the_republic:_order_initiation,_orders_1_through_150 ), 
  all 150 were encoded into the biochip , most of the orders were n't that dark and were mostly what to do in a combat cituation or when your squad leader is down etc. 
  [ here is an example of another `` dark '' order - order 37 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iofumlpo2na ), 
  i even had dreams of playing 3.0, 
  no stop this shit, 
  im pretty sure we should feel lucky about having to worry about a patch in a game instead of health problems etc, 
  we are not retreating - we 're advancing in another direction !, 
  *** its the abomination !, 
  why are they making it at the last possible moment , instead of one day earlier or something . 
  each studio has a whole month before it gets broadcasted again . 
  if you are going to karmawhore atleast upload it to imgur so we might actually achieve what the title suggested ... 
  also why are there both uec and auec, 
  free flight week seems to be here - my friend from germany got his free flight week pass few hours ago and is currently downloading the game !, 
  sure - he registered few hours ago ( before the free flight started ) and when he logged in later he [ had the free flight pass ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9bosng0.png ) attributed to him . 
  a friend of my ( from germany if that matters ) made an account earlier today and got his [ free flight pass ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9bosng0.png ) few hours ago . 
  i think [ you can check here ] ( https://robertsspaceindustries.com/download ) if you were given a new pass . 
  no problem !, 
  i 'm glad i was able to help !, 
  [ follow the instructions here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/3oiokc/the_star_citizen_referral_code_randomizer/#button ), 
  thanks for the giveaway op !, 
  oh yeah ca n't wait for patch 3.0 moons, 
  but there is more than just landing zones right ? 
  so can we atleast explore the rest of the planets aside of their landing zones ? 
   big show, 
  moon simulator is n't the big show, 
  but only arccorp is a city planet , both hurston and microtech are n't . 
  so are they releasing the planets but without their landing locations and if not - why arent they going to do that - we do n't those places anyway if we just want to explore . 
  is this covered by my bamboozle protection ? 
  so star citizen is world of warcraft of the space sim ? 
  yeah duh , we 've known this for more than 10 years, 
  keep in mind that sq42 is a single-player game and many of the elements can be `` faked '', 
  big if true, 
  you ask why everyone wants clone wars and then you state how fun playing clone wars was back on old bf . 
  well of course everyone wants to replay that on better engine and with better graphics !, 
  i do n't get why they ca n't just release the planets without the `` hero landing '' spots . 
  i get that they are delayed because of the external team starting to work on something else but that does n't excuse why the rest of the planets are n't explorable seeing that they are n't planet-wide cities and we will be able to explore them anyway was the hero locations are in . 
  it would be better if first one was route 65 or some road with number 65, 
  well that too , but i was talking about order 65 , which was similar to 66 but in that case the acting chancellor had to be captured or executed as he is deeded traitor . 
  dude ... he just died ... 
  indeed , otherwise it would be just cig doing random giveaway every time someone buys the game !, 
  agreed , whats the point of being super realistic about some aspect and at the same time your most basic ship having such illogical space-efficiency . 
  yeah but what bonus do i get for recruiting a friend ? 
  yeah , and how can i even recruit my friends ? 
  come play thing awesome would-be game where at the moment you cant do shit , but will be so awesome in the not-so-near future ? 
  everyone will just wait once its atleast close to an actual game and so should those crazy recruitment programs ... 
  yeah it 's their fault that every other app is better , even using your browser is better than downloading thier app ... 
  me too ... nvm, 
  execute order 66 !, 
  into exile you must go , failed you have !, 
  also this meme is quite reliant on current events , other memes etc. 
  it has never become a dominant meme , and never will . 
  this means it does n't use up all its entertainment value too quickly which is why it has persisted in small doses . 
  it says online but it has n't changed the number of people online for hours so it seems its just stucked at it, 
  thanks too me !, 
  you have the array ground ? 
  so sokka dated moon moon ? 
  as an alliance i 've never waited more than 10 minutes , 95 % of the times its instant, 
  shit , my boss saw this wasp and now im getting fired ... thanks for nothing ... 
  by ** the shit ** he means that dayz isnt the game with the greatest potential - star citizen is, 
  nah he just cant afford it, 
  c a n t w a k e u p, 
  you are going to stream ? 
  aight , i 'm bringing nachos !, 
  we are saving our planet with our dankest memes !, 
  me irl is currently running a donation drive for rainn, 
  but future us plebs have no fault that mister orange is ruining their country now . 
  is n't it better to put on some sanctions now , while there is still time for change ? 
  dad is retarded feelsbadman, 
  *** slides $ 50 ***, 
  make it every second !, 
  so it is a ti afterall ? 
  its time to stop, 
  go kill 20 space boars !, 
  til its called tilde, 
  the great meme war of october 2016 . 
  serious talk this is what pisses me off about forsen , he keeps having these pc problems for a while and does nothing to solve them . 
  taking days off is fine but he can at least notify his viewers beforehand , not tweet about it when all the boys are sitting in offline chat and waiting . 
  this `` im not a tryhard , bro '' attitude would never work for other streamers , he gets away with it only because of his fanbase loyalty , but the patience is not unlimited, 
  id kill for a pallet keychain, 
  serious talk this is what pisses me off about scamaz , he keeps having these pc problems for a while and does nothing to solve them .

  acting like a lil bitch wo n't change the stuff they did during the second world war . 
  might aswell just remember it like really happend , its not like showing a swastika in a video game will cause the rise of neonazism ... 
  can you invite the rest of us too ? 
  and although his airbending skills are great , he has a lot to learn before he 's ready to save anyone . 
  but i believe aang can save the world . 
  or have basic knowledge in economics, 
  reminds me of hitler and the train wagon, 
  it holds so little now because the networking code is n't in yet , so i 'm not sure whats so surprising ... 
  i can run skyrim ( albeit pretty shitty ) on my win10 tablet which has way worse processor then my samsung s6 so seeing skyrim on android in the next few years old really amaze me that much . 
  sure - if you are playing lets say cs : go ( other games with big playerbases and items on the steam market work too ) and you know your items you will see that cases with good items go up in price in time after they stop dropping . 
  knowing that you can just buy them while cheap and sell them later on when they price has increased tenfold or even x100 . 
  of course having deeper knowledge of how the items act on the makret helps too - some items that once costed cents are now beign sold for hundreds of dollars . 
  if you pay a bit of attention to the market you can easily see which items will go in price in time . 
  there are multiple subreddits for different game markets that are created just for that , you can seek for those if you need more info .
