  i 'd like to see my character looking something like [ this ] ( http://www.wowpedia.org/images/thumb/3/39/crusader_michael_goodchilde_tcg.jpg/260px-crusader_michael_goodchilde_tcg.jpg ) . 
  indeed it is - it 's the spell [ scorch ] ( http://www.wowtcgvault.com/images/cards/medium/tdp/scorch.jpg ) from the dark portal expanion . 
  it 's pretty cool spell because it costs nothing and does 1 damage .
