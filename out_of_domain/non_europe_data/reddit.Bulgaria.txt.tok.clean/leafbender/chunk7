  who is varian declaring war to ? 
  the iron horde ? 
  still what 's the point of declaring war to the iron horde , it 's not like they are going to care about politics . 
  did n't end well last time .

  it '' s from all the smoke from the forges and blacksmiths . 
  same here , farming it on 6 toons since early cata , still no drop .

  you did n't miss it  shattarth is a bit different from our version of the city . 
  it is currently full of elite hostile ( like there are friendly ) burning legion demons . 
  i tried to film it but atm we cant fly in draenor and there are no direct flypaths above the city so filming it is pretty hard . 
  i can put it in future video tho , 
  that 's [ auchindoun ] ( http://wowpedia.org/auchindoun ) . 
  once holy place for the draenei , now only the ruins remain in outland . 
  they are with the iron horde forces . 
  they seems to work together , or atleast for now . 
  your mount looks happy too !, 
  you can also get the same tabard and shield from the garrison . 
  it literally has the same people from oqueue in it !, 
  remindes me of a certain safe . 
  poor little fellas :(, 
  peace blooms after war . 
  watch your mouth !, 
  why is the well next to the river ? 
  he da real mvp !, 
  reminds me of emperor mengsk . 
  i know you are joking but blizzard and activision are part of activision blizzard so no point in that . 
  his computer is n't the only thing that got booted quickly ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  not with that attitude, 
  modded gta4 has better graphics than this .

  well how do you think those ores respawn during the night ... 
  wait , you mean you are not supposed to do that ? 
  oh i though it was the text saying `` no strings '' and there are strings just below it . 
  payback coin is n't even silver , it 's like i do n't even know you anymore !, 
  if only ... 
  link achievement . 
  good automoderator !, 
  its clearly [ those guys !, 
  this is not war , this is pest control !, 
  well maybe they are n't doing `` bad business '' atm , but if they continue to act like some small company things wo n't go very well and it will be too late to change .

  well during world war i bulgaria had army of [ 1,200,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i ) and population of [ 4,280,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_bulgaria ) so there is that . 
  i think they increased it up to 10 in the pre-wod patch . 
  ask nvidia . 
  that 's the tl : dr, 
  finally !, 
  was getting tired of killing rare mobs on ed and getting nothing in return . 
  we are just plotting our next moves . 
  seems to be 2 hours off for me ( shows 1 day and 5 hours where it should be 1 day and 3 hours ), 
  yeah but when we do that evac pilots just start to yell at us :(, 
  look again , it might turn blue . 
  yeah you just get used to it .
