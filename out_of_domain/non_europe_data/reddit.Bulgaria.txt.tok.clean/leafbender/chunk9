  and now we get [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rhqv4bs.jpg ) . 
  back to waiting to log in that is ... 
  most likely because there are n't enough bloodfang worgen ( the other type of worgen that are part of the alliance ) to be a playable race . 
  middle-earth \u2122 : shadow of mordor \u2122, 
  getting a new build pretty soon - gtx 970 , 2x8gb ddr3 2400mhz ram , i7 4790k and a ga-z97x-gaming 5 motherboard .

  monkeys would do a better job than their current support ... 
   they 're still my friends even if they do n't like me anymore . 
  right in the feels \u0ca2_\u0ca2, 
  glorious !, 
  its not a mouse mat , its used for playing ( wow ) tcg on it . 
  [ new expansion will be coming out soon !, 
  ] ( http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/8/8373753/age-of-empires-ii-hd-expansion ), 
  dragonkins are like usually the ground forces of any dragonflight and while all the rest of the black dragons are either dead or corrupted as usual those dragonkins might not be tainted and just serve him normally . 
  what are thooose ? 
  is this dedutated wam ? 
  he is joking mate , santa is ofc real !, 
  * dps the adds ? 
  nope !, 
  * nuke the boss ?

  ** face is the place **, 
  ca n't our armorsmiths or whatever make them fit ? 
  friends with benefits it seems . 
  god wills it !, 
  op is today your first day in school or something ? 
  what you have done it to trick the system, 
  it 's symbolic gesture . 
  it 's a south park reference, 
  the original tcg had more than 20 expansions, 
  face is the place !, 
  it 's all fun and game until you see the warsong commander ... 
  what you have done it to trick hangar, 
  reference to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/windows10/comments/3jkq9h/what_you_have_done_it_to_trick_microsoft/ ), 
  wait , it does ? 
  using mr. skeltal for millitary purpoces is again the geneva convention . 
  in that case we are all going to die so that discovery does n't really matter . 
  we ... we are n't supposed to do that ? 
  americans are always confused when we are n't talking about something usa related ... 
  til $ 5 is `` large amounts of cash '', 
  the gods have spoken !, 
  or maybe he really wanted to trade stuff like many sane people ... no need to act like a total asshole . 
  but dalaran was grounded pre-2008, 
  true , i 'm not doubting they could change some elements in the story to make the movie look more appealing to people who are new to the story , even it is not 100 % lore correct, 
  should 've seen that coming ... 
  so ... we can talk about the basil club ? 
  the alliance does have more than one , with 3 other being seen in the patch 5.4 trailer with the rest of the invasion fleet . 
   i pre-ordered it few years ago . 
  honest question , why do you downvote him . 
  its a singleplayer game after all and why the hell do you care if the company will lose some money out of this ... 
  the online store where i get my physical edition always gives little gifts to all the blizzard game that you buy . 
  for instance the wod gift was a little hearthstone and the mop gift was a little stout cup thingy with chen stormstout drawn on the side . 
  also most of the games come 5 euro cheaper than what battle.net asks . 
  that guy should be hired by blizzard !, 
  dat burst tho , topped the dps meter . 
  isnt that for arma 2 as a whole ? 
  2.0 on ptu ... oh wait wrong subreddit . 
  dat wow tcg molten core raid in italian tho, 
  fun detected !, 
  watch the sky ... 
  ah the outland clown syndrome !, 
  wanted to say that both look staged , couldve worded it better tho . 
  the unstoppable forces changes its direction . 
  few online laptop seller stores in my country have had this function for years tbh . 
  wasnt that fixed in 6.0 ? 
  i see you do n't own a samsung smartphone ... 
  but i need those specs in order to hack into the mainframe ... 
  another good reason not to be captured by boltons ... 
  this titan looks rather small but extremely ugly ... even for their kin . 
  whats with the downvotes here ? 
  killing one mob a day would get you faster than that ... 
  we are always together here !, 
  *** points at heart ***, 
  going to get my new sgs6 edge + tomorow , so this is great news indeed !, 
  mana bombs cant melt stone walls !, 
  love that cooler master haf case tho , got the same !, 
  poor retaliator :(, 
  champ !, 
  what you have done it to trick blizzard, 
  said the death knight ... 
  hold my beer !, 
  oh god , that level still terrifies me !, 
  i will not rest until i became the next hoka -- i mean the king of stormwind !, 
  i takes one modem reset to get myself a new ip ... so like 20 seconds, 
  dragonfable port for mobile wouldnt be bad either . 
  is there orange in the orange fanta ? 
  do n't get ahead of yourself !, 
  rp event event on argent dawn ? 
  i think you are lying to us op , there is no such thing !, 
  savage !, 
  thats not pandaren , thats a panda !, 
  its like seeing a human and calling it a monkey ... 
  he didnt [ share it !, 
  not yet !, 
  you should 've been forsaken death knight just to go deeper in death !, 
  nah he is farming it because its bis pre-raid gear silly !, 
  so 1/2 of that 100 % mount training ? 
  agility was pretty good stat for its crit back in the days !, 
  humans in general are like that !, 
  worth it !,
