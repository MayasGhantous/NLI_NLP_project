if you do n't have a lot to carry around , pack your stuff in a bag and [ go there ] ( https://www.google.bg/maps/place/%d0%a6%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0+%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b0/@42.6964332,23.328057,20.33z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xccd83590b62c8af3!8m2!3d42.6964618!4d23.3283097?hl=en ) . 
  i literally have no clue but here 's what i can tell you - i have some relatives that are macedonian . 
  one of them was born in bulgaria by accident ( go figure ) and he applied for citizenship well over 10 years ago and he 's still waiting . 
  actually he is n't anymore because at the age of 80 , he does n't care much . 
  anyway he wo n't be getting it anytime soon by the looks of it . 
  on the other hand i have one or two friends ( from ukraine ) who were in the same position as you and it took around a year for them . 
  my best bet is that you 'll fall into the same category . 
  yes , he is macedonian , as well as both his parents but a lot of his relatives had bulgarian citizenship by the time he was born ( refuges from the balkan wars ) . 
  his parents were here on a holiday in 1940 and he got born here by accident ( want expected for another month or something ) . 
  so yes , that is the case so it 's most probably irrelevant to opdo case . 
  i 'm just pointing out that such cases do exist . 
  [ this is exactly how i picture op right now ] ( https://youtu.be/sfnm-77on8c ) . 
  the market is way too small . 
  romania is about 4 times the population of bulgaria . 
  and as someone who used to work at one of our 3 mobile operators and who had access to every database available , let 's just say that iphone are n't exactly popular around these parts . 
  basically the ratio between samsung and apple devices was around 3 to 1 . 
  add the other major manufacturers such as htc , sony , motorola , lg , etc. , and you 'll get the idea . 
  the other thing is that a large portion of the people i know , including myself , keep their phones in english - i ca n't find anything otherwise . 
  microsoft owns a large portion of the desktop and laptop market so they 've done their job . 
  same with google . 
  same thing with the navigation systems on all vw 's since 2009 or so . 
  in essence not worth investing in apple 's case . 
  of course . 
  but first we are having a war with atlantis , the aztecs , the vogons and the frost giants . 
   studentski grad, 
  no , just no . 
  period . 
  center , any place you pick is a good choice . 
  if you will be staying in any eu country as a eu citizen for over 3 months , you must register with the local authorities , whether you 'd be working or not . 
  when you do that , you get a foreigner personal id , or lnch ( yeah , we have a letter that represents `` ch '' ) . 
  this is essentially what you will use as a tax number . 
  pay attention at the contract you 'd be signing however - depends whether you 'd be working there as a self-employed , which is a pain in the ass cause you will have deal with paying taxes yourself which is a bureaucratic nightmare . 
  much like anywhere else really but you 'd still have to fill in forms , wire money and all that . 
  if you are hired by someone however , their accountant will take care of all that so the lnch is all you 'll ever need . 
  i 'm not entirely sure what the process is but i 'm assuming you have to go to the nearest police department . 
  if you need it urgently however , they will likely send you to the central directorate `` migration '' , located on `` knyaginya maria luiza '' 48 . 
  to my surprise there seems to be plenty of useful information in english available on their website : http://migration.mvr.bg/citizens_eu/default.htm, 
  background check is a joke really since you are a foreign national . 
  once you have your local id , you go to the local court and ask for it . 
  and since there is little to no information available between eu nations about small time criminals ( sorry to say , largely thanks to your country of origin ) , they will likely have no information about you ( unless you 've slaughtered 20 people and cooked them for dinner or something similar ) and they will hand it out to you in 10 minutes tops . 
  letter from gp - just go to the nearest hospital , tell them that you need a medical exam for your work contract . 
  they will ask you a few questions like can you see the door , are you getting an epileptic seizure when you are looking at some flashing light or some stuff and they will give you a piece of paper with typical unreadable doctor handwriting . 
  15 minutes tops . 
  just tell the first gp what you need , they 'll know what to give you . 
  do n't sweat it , all that can be done in a few hours probably without a problem, 
  no need to ask . 
  [ no eu member state is obliged to require you to have a permanent residence but since it is allowed , all member states do require it ] ( http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/documents-formalities/registering-residence/index_en.htm ), 
  honestly i have no idea what 's with your constant stupid questions so in the spirit of your question , i 'll give you a scientific answer . 
  the two nearest airports with direct lines to and from sofia are :, 
  bucharest, 
  according to googe maps , the coordinates are as follows :, 
  ruse city center :, 
  bucurest airport :, 
  having that information and using the euclidean geometry formula :, 
  ( use some latex parser or something ), 
  you get :, 
  varna to ruse = 2.0191157688497086, 
  bucurest to ruse = 0.7734650504314985, 
  so bucurest airport is over two times closer in a straight line to the city center of ruse . 
  anyone but soviet terrorists like radev . 
  60 of the last 70 years bulgaria has been ruled by to bkp ( bsp ) . 
  thousands were killed , people beaten by police whenever anyone opposes them ( 2013 was n't that long ago ) , following soviet orders unconditionally , the belene mess is their crap entirely . 
  i can go on for days . 
  as far as i 'm concerned all bsp members must be sent to a rape gang prison in india and then fed to wild bores . 
  not a bsp member so by definition there 's a world of difference . 
  if i had to pick between any bsp member and hitler , i 'd pick hitler in a heartbeat . 
  pishtova , vitkov and any other retard is significantly better than a bsp terrorist . 
  which politician has n't been ? 
  and people are retards . 
  especially bsp and their supporters . 
  it 's much rather have a retarded president than one who will gather signatures for a referendum with the question `` would you like cheap electricity '' then give 35bln to the soviet missing links and by doing so making electricity 5 times more expensive . 
  bsp members need a rape in the butt then to be thrown in a cage full of wild bores , simple as that . 
  yes cause we killed the brightest minds , and locked everyone else in camps to rot . 
  who 's making fun ? 
  i most certainly am not ? 
  commies do deserve that treatment . 
  in fact i 'm being far too kind and humane given their crimes . 
  if someone half way across the globe is offended , that 's their problem , not mine . 
  k comrade , whatever you say . 
  can we please , please rename this sub to / r/conspiracy and re-create / r/bulgaria with strict rules and people who enforce them ? 
  like , let 's say , post stuff that is relevant to bulgaria and unreliable sources are deleted and trolls banned ? 
  se\u00f1ores mods , please ? 
  no , you are a retard and this is a geographical sub and your shit posts belong in / r/conspiracy because they are completely un-fucking-related to bulgaria !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  i see where you are coming from but it 's a bit more complicated . 
  yes , i do believe it is very likely that this is one and the same troll for a list of reasons . 
  even if you are unprepared to look for clues , the fact that all 3 were registered at the same time does give some clues away . 
  i 'm willing to bet that the tf -- idf scores for two of them would be exactly the same . 
  but i do n't intend to do it as it 's definitely not a job i 'd do for free , even if it takes less than an hour . 
  for about a year , i was working as a data scientist at one of the large bulgarian online media sites . 
  possibly the largest . 
  there were 5000 comments a day , 80 % of which were coming from 10 people . 
  and i did prove it in 6 separate ways . 
  needless to say they had the exactly same sentiment as the posts of the three users in question but the bosses refused to do anything about it because 1 comment = 1 reload of the page so the ad counter was going up . 
  it was a very similar story with the upvotes/downvotes in that website . 
  so that 's the reason why i quit if i have to be honest - morals only . 
  it may be funny every now and then but i do believe that 15 year olds can have a negative impact on society . 
  back when i was a teenager in the 90s it was cool when you could find and download a game somewhere and apply a crack . 
  these days it 's cool to be a self-proclaimed internet warrior and i most certainly do n't like that . 
  while downloading cracks from romanian websites did give you some basic it skills ( and thus a lot of us ending up working in the it sector , which pays great ) , 15 year olds posting propaganda do n't have much prospect : for example russia , the uk ( and that list looking to expand to the us ) are victims of that syndrome .
