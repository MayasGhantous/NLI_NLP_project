  good job with your research . 
  took you an hour to figure out what two of the greatest mathematicians of the 20-th century worked on for over two decades . 
  you must have come up with the same formula on your own as you 've clearly never heard of either one of them . 
  i 'm impressed . 
  [ the irony here is reaching critical levels . 
  good job with your puberty kid and good job with missing hermann minkowski , prasanta mahalanobis , richard hamming , paul jaccard , hans luhn , verena huber , javier peres capdevila , antonio manetti , kazimierz kuratowski ( ne of my personal favourites ) . 
  i can go on for days but then again i do have a masters degree in mathematics . 
  does beg the question how you do your research . 
  paid ? 
  who said paid ? 
  i simply said retarded . 
  you need to be 16 to work legally anyway and it does require an explicit permission from your parents so you do n't qualify for any legal jobs . 
   paid ass kisser, 
  you figured out the same way you worked out the foreign investment stats i take it . 
  bravo , when you reach 18 i can give you a list of at least 20 companies specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence that would be more than willing to pay 6 figures a year for your consulting . 
  lol you were n't born in the 90 's and on that bombshell , adios . 
  woa wikileaks so scurry , so afraids you so braiv you go on deep web . 
  idiot !, 
  well that was the summer of 2013 to be exact . 
  paid or not , they were very coordinated . 
  a few years later , when i scroll through the comments of that same news agency website , the story looks exactly the same . 
  but i do n't work there anymore and thus i have no access to the database . 
  there 's actually 3 of them . 
  similar posts , similar comments , all three have usernames that end with double digit numbers ( two of them with 22 mind you ) , all three repeating the word wikiliikz the way people used to back in 2010 . 
  but perhaps that 's not the same person but rather 3 people all suffering from a rare condition called retardian influenza . 
  hey look !, 
  another new account ending with a two digit number .

  wrong , you do get asked in what currency , all banks offer at least bgn and eur , most offer usd and not so often gbp but they are required to ask you in what currency you want your account and in fact you do have to tick off the one you want when you fill in the papers . 
  that would be me my kind sir .

  just another day in the city life . 
  no comment . 
  true story . 
  you should expect a lower salary compared to agents with other languages ( say german , french , spanish , italian and not no mention any of the nordics are drastically better paid ) . 
  main reason being that finding people who speak english well is a pretty easy task for sofia at least compared to all the others . 
  besides plenty of people who studied in english-speaking countries so the native bit wo n't be anything exclusive . 
  english - you could expect somewhere between 1300 and 1600 which is more than enough to buy you a very good life . 
  a friend of mine speaks french fluently ( she should after studying in france for two years ) and her initial salary was double that . 
  i 've heard as much as 6000 for finnish so you get the picture . 
  majestic . 
  tldr ; to much drinking , men cry more than women . 
  as an atheist , i too hate orthodox christianity , as well as any other religion out there . 
  your logic is flawless ^ / s, 
  tl ; dr stay away from them . 
  they wo n't get screwed but hr agencies are utterly incompetent . 
  example : `` oooh you know c++ ? 
  how would you feel with php ? 
  it 's basically the same thing but better '' . 
  i approve . 
  dentist , i 'd point you to [ this ] ( http://www.multimplants.com/en ) guy . 
  pricey compared to others and a huge dickhead - he 'll keep moaning about the things previous dentists have done to you ( turned out he was right about everything he said in my case btw ) as if you have done it yourself in front of the mirror with a screwdriver . 
  other than that annoying part of his character , ca n't think of a better one . 
  blood tests - unsure but every clinic will do it for you for a small fee . 
  but i have no experience with any of them . 
  i 'd advise everyone to stay clear of tokuda . 
  seems that everyone working there has less knowledge than the average ape . 
  then again that seems to be the case for the vast majority of the world 's population as hans rosling has shown numerous times but that 's a different story . 
  dude what ? 
   hello , i am an it specialist who is seriously considering a move back to the home land . 
  many already did , all seem to be happy . 
   i visit family and friends every year but of course that is completely different compared to actually living there . 
  if you work in the it , it 's practically the same . 
   i 've been living in the uk for +10 years, 
  say no more , leave , come back . 
   really , the only benefit i can see in favor of staying within the uk is earning more money . 
  that 's relative , see [ here ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ks63n/brain_drain_from_bulgaria_and_romania_helps/dbqf2y5/ ), 
   the main reasons why i have n't moved back sooner are probably to do with the fear of the lifestyle . 
  i do n't know what to expect in terms of a career in bulgaria and also my written bulgarian is absolutely terrible , which is why i 'm typing in english . 
  ( i can speak fine ), 
   will i be looked down upon for leaving a western country to come back ? 
  nope , as i said , many came back already . 
   will my poor writing skills in bulgarian hinder me when i seek employment ? 
   is it a lot harder to find work in my field outside of sofia ? 
  quite possibly . 
  waiting 3 months before reporting this seems like a huge and unnecessary delay . 
  for what it 's worth , i am really sorry for you . 
  i ca n't help much with legal issues but i 'll make a few phone calls tomorrow and pm you whatever info i can get . 
  as someone born and raised in sofia : go screw yourselves . 
  wait , what ? 
  possibly but i 'd rather go for looking some local to help you instead . 
  the problem with the people working those types of jobs are people who 've spent most of their youth in clubs and thus have the delusion that they know what you want better than you . 
  similar to when i was buying my flat , estate agents threw a bunch of shit at me . 
  luckily i had friends in a lot of places so i did n't end up owning a flat i would n't have been able to use in the next 10 years . 
  as strange as it may seem asking around erasmus groups on social networks might give you a significantly better results . 
  i think the other response covered that, 
  hiking would be a decent option i think , especially in the mountains to the south . 
  [ another very good idea ] ( https://www.google.bg/maps/place/boyana+waterfall/@42.6291319,23.2537705,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x25ba3d77d40b5787!8m2!3d42.6291319!4d23.2537705 ), 
  eh not really . 
  in relation to the other reply you got , i 'd disagree . 
  stay away from the cheap restaurants . 
  generally if it looks like a good place it 's very likely that it is . 
  visit the mountains and the [ caves ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_caves_in_bulgaria ) if you are into that type of thing . 
  seems trivial , knowing the amount of epic tattoo artists in germany . 
  still , no clue . 
  since you 're driving , i 'd advise you to be careful . 
  lately there have been some improvements thanks to the higher fines and harsher punishments that were introduced . 
  in any cases we do have a lot of complete lunatics on the roads .
