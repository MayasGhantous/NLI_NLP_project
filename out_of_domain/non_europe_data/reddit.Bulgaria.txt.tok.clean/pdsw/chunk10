  apple are the only one who do three-finger dragging with touchpad . 
  ubuntu dropped this feature about a year ago and most other distros never had it . 
  i do n't know how to use touchpad without ability to move objects around the screen . 
  notes are usable now !, 
  and reminders with calendar are much nicer !, 
  small local one . 
  have n't seen it outside of town . 
  i 'm not pregnant . 
  i 'm just sick of you . 
  soon to be ... , when it become the open beta or will be released . 
  it 's not a tattoo . 
  it was just a price tag glued on with that shitty glue . 
  ia writer is so much better . 
  it would be real blb if you would be killed by a falling tree on the way back to the grocery store . 
  when all you have is hammer , everything else looks like a nail . 
  you need to cool it down to -20 deg . 
  centigrade to knock it off . 
  it could be much worse than cold . 
  the moist from the relatively hot air inside your house could condensate on the ice cold innards of the notebook and do some water damage . 
  you have to wash your microfiber clothes from time to time . 
  machine washing works well enough . 
  i usually wash them with the other things needed to be almost sterile like pillow cases and kitchen towels on 90 degrees centigrade . 
  thank you . 
  i am a big fan of ia writer so when i heard that information architects released a new piece of software and it is a kind of upgrade the writer i launched the app store and bought it without any second thought . 
  i am playing with it right now and this is my initial review . 
  ## import existing documents from ia writer, 
  the first thing ia writer owners are , probably , concerned about : will the writer pro import all the files from the ia writer ? 
  the answer is ** no ** , there is no way to do that in the os x version of the app . 
  however , there is a workaround . 
  you can call ` file / open ` dialog , press ` cmd-shift-g ` to open the * go to * modal window , enter the ` ~ / library ` there , and navigate to ` mobile documents ` folder where you can find something like ` 94x5345 ~ informationarchitects ~ writer ` with the ` documents ` folder inside . 
  there you can select all the files you need , open them in writer pro and manually move them to the writer pro 's icloud storage . 
  ## look and feel, 
  all the data like word and character counts is in the sidebar . 
  so if you hid the sidebar , there will be nothing but the text in the window , like in good old ia writer . 
  just remember that the * focus mode * is the * sentence * setting of the * syntax control * mode now . 
  some things are added though :, 
  * there is a subtle sepia hue on the background ,, 
  * second level headings is now displayed in bold italic . 
  in my taste , bold italic looks ugly in monospaced fonts , even such awesome ones like nitti . 
  i hope ia guys will change their mind and make the headings just bold . 
  background hue is indeed subtle and i can live with it , though grayish one would be better . 
  both new serif and sans-serif fonts look amazing , but the reason why * note * mode needs variable width font alludes me . 
  what also alludes me is the purpose of the * structure * section of the sidebar . 
  in my personal opinion , it is totally useless . 
  i would rather see the file name or title there . 
  ## workflow, 
  i read some reviews so far and a lot of people seem to be disappointed with the writer pro workflow . 
  i did n't get it before i tried it either , but now i love it . 
  it is amazingly simple :, 
  the new file appears as the * note * and sits in the ` note ` folder of the writer pro 's icloud storage . 
  when you switch to the * write * mode the file ** moves ** to the ` write ` folder entirely without any changes . 
  the same with the * edit * and * read * modes . 
  the content of the file stays intact between the stages . 
  this is the visual appearance of writer pro that is changing ; and , presumably , your own attitude towards the text . 
  this is simple , flexible and utterly awesome workflow . 
  you can jump between stages however and whenever you want . 
  jump from the * note * directly to the * read * if the text is good enough or downgrade * write * text to * note * for more detailed planing ... 
  however , i can understand people who have their own workflows . 
  it is not that easy to incorporate writer pro 's workflow into already established one . 
  writer pro suggested workflow is indeed a suggestion -- it does n't force you to do anything you do n't like . 
  actually , you can treat the first three modes as a font face switcher . 
  do n't like ` monotype ` ? 
  write in * note * or * edit * if you like sans-serif or serif typefaces respectively . 
  ## minor issues i hope will be addressed in the nearest updates, 
  * * sintax control * mode highlights parts of speech in the code ,, 
  * italics in heading in the * write * mode ,, 
  * i think , * read * mode should look more like a preview , without any markdown markup . 
  as with the ia writer you can use os x built-in color inversion . 
  they were asked about it on their support forum and said that they are considering adding this feature in the future . 
  icloud ** and ** on my mac . 
  so you can use any cloud storage you want , be it dropbox , google drive or whatever . 
  ** edit ** : i do not own an ios version . 
  there are some reports that ios version has no support for dropbox like ia writer for ios has . 
  apple mouse [ add $ 49.00 ], 
  what is it ? 
  is it a new mouse or pre-magic model is still in production ? 
  is n't it like almost 10 years old ? 
  how comes they still have them in stock ? 
  probably so . 
  lol , the text in cyrillic on the lowest-most box is mostly a gibberish . 
  so , they are basically protesting creating jobs ? 
  but if the rent is way too high why do n't just built more apartments . 
  it will give the job for the construction workers during the development and for all those who will work in service later , and will drive the rent down . 
  economy boosted , everyone 's ( save for current landlords ) happy . 
  why do n't they protest laws prohibiting area development instead ? 
  world of warcraft, 
  i always wondered : i can understand that government is ok with it , but why business owners are ok with it ? 
  photoshop elements have almost anything photographer could expect to get from a full featured photoshop for a $ 49.99 ( at amazon ), 
  learn to use sips ( ` man sips ` ) -- it 's a magic when you need to deal with a lot of images ( like thumbnails generation or similar tasks ) . 
  why did they blocked sidewalk ? 
  * crop , like creating proper squared thumbnails . 
  * mass edit or removal of exif . 
  * put output to desired folder , like upload it directly to a server . 
  ca n't remember a good tutorial . 
  though , it is quite simple . 
  much simpler than imagemagick . 
  in the last days of march 2013 i used [ time.is ] ( http://time.is ) website to set the exact time on my trusty jdm casio g-shock g5600e . 
  it 's whole nine month passed since that time , so i decided to check if i need to correct the time again . 
  not at all .
