  oh , thank you . 
  i will try this . 
  [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/01/crimea-crisis-deepens-as-russia-and-ukraine-ready-forces-live-updates ) is good . 
  he said that ** some ** people are against the war . 
  this is true . 
  though , a lot of russians are pro-war , pro-putin , and thirsty for ukrainians ' blood . 
  indeed . 
  yes . 
  ** most ** is a wrong word . 
  but the number is indeed substantial . 
  99 % of the media in russia is state controlled . 
  the level of lies they convey is overwhelming sometimes . 
  nazists + maidan-bandits are only exist on the russian tv . 
  the whole idea of maidan was to overthrow the bandits . 
  in kharkiv russian fascists have beaten and kneeled people . 
  thank you . 
  it worked perfectly . 
  titushki are pro-russian . 
  pilot black was issue free for me . 
  with ef you would have to stick to the darker , more saturated inks . 
  this is true . 
  personally , i found even lamy blue way to pale for the ef . 
  though , should be acceptable with f. 
  i 'm not a big fan of blue . 
  so i only used lamy blue in those cartridges that came with my safaris . 
  i do own a bottle of lamy black and this is definitely not the most saturated black ink on the market ( though , it is absolutely issue free and the bottle is convenient ) . 
  upvote for acrylic !, 
  could you please show up the rhodia carnet . 
  is it the a5 one with 32 pages ? 
  how tall are lines ? 
  are they bright ? 
  thank you . 
  do not buy razer orochi . 
  its bluetooth capabilities are a joke . 
  saw this three times in two years when i was sysadmin . 
  because writing with a cheap ballpoint fells more like scratching rather than writing . 
  personally , i found petit 1 much better than preppy . 
  i want to upgrade ram on a pentium dual-core 2020m notebook . 
  it currently has 2gb of 1600mhz ram . 
  i have two options :, 
  buy another 2gb stick of 1600mhz ram, 
  install 2 x 4gb 1333mhz that i already own . 
  which option is better ? 
  will the use of 1333mhz ram affect overall performance much ? 
  will the performance gain for the 1600mhz worth $ 20 and twice less ram ? 
  thank you . 
  unfortunately , i ca n't see latency because my old sticks are working in my current computer right now . 
  they are mid-range samsung , afair . 
  pdc 2020m is quite fresh 2013 cpu . 
  is it really possible the system could be limited to a max of 4gb of ram ? 
  thank you . 
  i 'll be running ubuntu on it . 
  so , software-wise , there will be no restrictions . 
  the chipset will probably address 16gb or may be even 32gb . 
  thank you . 
  there is no particular reason to use 32-bit os on a modern cpu , but 32-bit linux ( most of them ) can address memory above the 4gb `` limit '' . 
  thank you . 
  reasonable . 
  personally i did n't experienced a lot of a difference . 
  my two safaris are both charcoal black . 
  so i keep the one with black ink in the left part of the leather case , and the one with the blue -- in the right part . 
  i would live in one of those . 
  this page is terrible . 
  why do n't you provide a regular web-page for those who wants to read it in a browser ? 
  if something works for you it does n't mean it works for everybody . 
  pilot 's inks ( not iroshizuku ) are tend to bleed on many papers , not only the cheapest ones . 
  generally , less saturated inks will be better in this regards . 
  why not safari ? 
  it 's lightweight unposted . 
  14 or 13 grams afaik . 
  for me it 's much lighter and much more suitable for long writing sessions than uni-ball vision rt and uni-ball jetstream . 
  this is what russians should think of . 
  how do it wearing off in just one year ? 
  something with the nib ? 
  hmm ... 
  i was hoping it will be more sturdy . 
  ah , thank you . 
  quo vadis are good . 
  this is the same clairefontaine as in rhodia . 
  this belongs to techsupportgore, 
  thank you for a great idea . 
  made it myself and ... damn !, 
  $ 120 per month on average :(, 
  the smoothness of writing depends on the inks a lot . 
  thank you . 
  it was a nice tour . 
  how the taxi driver was going to scam you ? 
  got it . 
  thank you . 
  how much is it usually to get from the airport to the nearby hotel ? 
  try diamine jet black . 
  also , j. herbin perle noir\u00e8 and aurora black should work very good too . 
  thank you . 
  diamine 's 30ml bottles should be quite affordable pretty much everywhere . 
  diamine onyx black . 
  it was way too dry in my lamy safari . 
  this is why i have half a liter of different inks now . 
  if i would have bought a bottle of lamy black initially , i would stick with it . 
  euros or bgn ? 
  diamine 's 30ml should be great for travel .
