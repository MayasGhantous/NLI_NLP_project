  i just upgraded two servers with do-release-upgrade . 
  everything went flawlessly . 
  just try mate desktop then . 
  this is practically the fork of gnome 2 . 
  i just added a converter to mine and it become a whole new pen . 
  platinum converter is heavy , it adds some solid feel to the otherwise quite lightweight preppy . 
  not only * write * but * edit * too . 
  diamine matador is great saturated scarlet red . 
  they ca n't even colonize ukraine so far . 
  older caran d'ache in 30ml bottles, 
  napalm death ? 
  personally , i love how it shades in the broader nibs . 
  it looks like the dolphins are using it harder . 
  quo vadis habana is about this size 16x24cm, 
  works well on cheap copy paper . 
  the packages from la coronne du comte should be free of import duties in romania , should n't they ?

  this window is full of pain . 
  sometimes hostages of the world strike back .

  a5 leuchtturms can misbehave with some inks . 
  in my experience pilot black , sheaffer skrip black , pilot blue-black are being caught by some fibers in the paper resulting in some kind of feathering . 
  most of the other inks ( i tried more than a dozen ) are good . 
  currently , it is iroshizuku shin-kai . 
  looks great . 
  magnets could be dangerous for some technology ( mostly outdated , but still ... ), 
  so , effectively , canada government reserves the right to bully its citizens . 
  does pilot broad feel smoother than a pilot medium ? 
  thank you . 
  spinning drive is a shame . 
  * the interpreter *, 
  i am really enjoying montblanc permanent blue now . 
  apart from being a little too long to dry it is absolutely perfect . 
  well , actually , all socialists are `` fake '' . 
  this is the essence of socialism . 
  i am using lined leuchtturm1917 . 
  works great . 
  try pigment inks from sailor of platinum . 
  games are here too . 
  like [ blackwell 1 : legacy ] ( http://gameaxes.com/review/blackwell-1-legacy/ ), 
  747 \u0438 [ 707 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/korean_air_lines_flight_902 ) . 
  still workplace appropriate . 
  not much of a selection . 
  just carbon black plus three pigment inks : blue , sepia , and red . 
  also there is iron-gall blue-black , and usual black . 
  the rest colors are only sold in proprietary platinum cartridges . 
  oh , yes . 
  totally forgot about them .

   osce have no idea who is controlling #mh 17 crash site . 
  appears to be several small rebel groups with no leader . 
  fate of black boxes unknown . 
   `` some [ rebels ] looked slightly intoxicated , '' buzzfeed 's moscow correspondent max seddon tweets from the osce press conference on its attempt to access the crash site today . 
  russia is much smaller economy-wise, 
  yes . 
  the line looks thinner on rhodia paper . 
  it is true broad on leuchtturm and banditapple . 
  mine is glassy smooth . 
  it depends on ink and how wet the whole pen is . 
  personally , i have no dry time issues with my b nibs ( i also use twsbi 580 with b nib ) . 
  though , usually , i am not in a hurry . 
  well , i will see if it cause any harm to my safari . 
  many people are using platinum and sailor pigmented inks without any issues , though . 
  during my last trip i got a single drop of diamine matador in my lamy safari cap and no issues at all with my twsbi 580 and montblanc permanent blue . 
  unarmed . 
  on my 11th birthday i got 3-inch pizza . 
  it was delicious . 
  a month ago i contacted [ this agency ] ( http://www.millenium-homes.net/ ) and they found a nice apartment for me . 
  also , you can find more agents on imot.bg and alo.bg, 
   fpn group, 
  how can i join it ? 
  [ orangecenter ] ( https://www.orangecenter.bg/ ) ( there are several locations around the city ) offers most popular models of parker , waterman , diplomat , caran d'ache , and faber-castell . 
  there are some inks too : waterman , caran d'ache ( both old and new series ) , a few j.herbin , parker cartridges . 
  they also have a great selection of rhodia paper . 
  [ \u0425\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d ] ( http://www.helikon.bg/ ) have leuchtturm1917 along with rhodia and moleskine .

  i guess i already found the unofficial one on fb . 
  thank you for the great idea . 
  does it have any kind of water resistance ? 
  thank you . 
  thank you very much . 
  this is really great ink . 
  yeah , i use their permanent blue right now . 
  you would probably be able to find caran d'ache inks there . 
  older 30ml could be a bargain . 
  also , montblanc , j.herbin , diplomat/cross ( i guess those are rebranded pelikan ) .

  i have parker 15 made in uk in 1997 .
