  the scratch on the cap is just below the `` 4 '' in the year . 
  yes . 
  it is . 
  shipping to california will be about $ 20 . 
  yes . 
  last month i found a mint condition parker 15 gt made in uk in 1997 . 
  after a few adjustments it works like a charm . 
  it was even in the original plastic display box . 
  paid $ 10 for it .

  the writing desk have them . 
  just received 1.1 mm for # 6.50 shipping included . 
  air . 
  mini is quite outdated now . 
  latest generation air is much more powerful . 
  also , you can save on keyboard and trackpad ( both high quality ) if you put air under your external monitor .

  oh , hello , fellow eastern european , 
  your i looks like a batman trying to scare his nemesis .

  this is parker 15 gt . 
  there should be two or three letters between parker and `` made in uk '' . 
  they will tell you when it was made . 
  you are welcome . 
  so , when yours was made ? 
  is it from uk ? 
  how much you have paid for it ? 
  * diamine grey, 
  * caran d'ache amazon, 
  yes it is . 
  i like it better than my charcoal safari . 
  it is more pleasant to hold . 
  loom , ambition , or basic . 
  they are exceptionally smooth and the quality is outstanding . 
  x450 is very heavy as well . 
  caran d'ache dunas has a better steel nib . 
  but it costs like three looms or basics . 
  metropolitan, 
  faber-castell loom and basic are the smoothest budget pens i know .

  i like my dunas . 
  it is ** just right ** in every aspect . 
  as long as another poster here wants to get the pen with m nib separately . 
  i will . 
  do you want only the nib . 
  or just the pen ( with z24 ) and m nib ? 
  yes . 
  i think this is possible . 
  it will be $ 29 for loom + $ 23 for lamy b and 1.1 + $ 10 for shipping . 
  yes . 
  well , ok . 
  send me a pm with you address and i will reply with my paypal email . 
  same as the b - $ 15 + $ 10 shipping . 
  wait a minute , you are talking about twsbi 580 m nib , or about lamy m nigb ? 
  not yet actually . 
  people ca n't decide yet . 
  are you interested in whole bundle ? 
  $ 15 + $ 10 shipping, 
  this is normal . 
  they will settle down after awhile . 
  old caran d'ache colours of the earth bottles are beautiful , though not as practical as the newer ones .

  i got caran d'ache 849 special edition claudio colucci for my sister a few days ago . 
  this is caran d'ache ecridor . 
  yes :( i am working on it too . 
  totally happy . 
  it is beyond any doubts a high-quality pen . 
  everything is top-notch : perfect weight and balance , flawless finish , many little things . 
  the nib is smoother than the one of montblanc meisterst\u00fcck 146 i tried before . 
  in fact , it provides the smoothest writing experience i have ever experienced . 
  consider caran d'ache or s.t. 
  anyway , i would recommend to make a purchase in a nice brick & mortar store . 
  it would probably be a pleasing experience and you will be able to handle several pens to chose the one that fits your hand best . 
  double consonants are very rare in the language i am learning now . 
  apparently , it affected my english grammar . 
  and being preoccupied with joining letters the right way , of course .

  in the north , when you wake up in the morning and see the sun rise , it means you are terribly late . 
  you can reserve the first sheet ( two pages ) for index , and if it wo n't be enough , reserve the last sheet for the index too . 
  it will be convenient . 
  [ the writing desk ] ( http://thewritingdesk.co.uk ), 
  also , do n't disregard brick and mortar stores . 
  for example , your local montblanc official dealer could be a great source for adequately priced inks . 
  there should be at least one in stockholm , though . 
  pelikan inks are noticeably cheaper in europe . 
  and the schnider cartridges are dirt-cheap . 
  i bought a few packs recently at about $ 0.09 per cartridge . 
  many products are overpriced there . 
  that 's true . 
  she was just cheap . 
  in russia people like to stay warm during the winter season . 
  central heating is often stays on even if the spring comes early ( which is rarely a case ) . 
  it is very document appropriate . 
  and even iso certified .

  ordered from them several times . 
  excellent service .
