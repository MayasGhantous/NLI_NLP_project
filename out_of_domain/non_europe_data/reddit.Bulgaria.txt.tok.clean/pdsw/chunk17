  [ veliko tarnovo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/veliko_tarnovo ) , bulgaria . 
  it is a stunningly beautiful little town a bit off the popular routes . 
  [ $ 250k will get you this house in the prestigious neighborhood of sofia , bulgaria ] ( http://www.imot.bg/pcgi/imot.cgi?act=5&amp;adv=1j138977814633713&amp;slink=1xewfc&amp;f1=1 ), 
  another fun bulgarian-russian thing is that ... 
  * the word \u044f\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 means strawberry in bulgarian , and any berry in russian ,, 
  * the word \u043e\u0440\u0435\u0445 means walnut in bulgarian , and any nut in russian ,, 
  * the word \u043f\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0446 means a thumb in bulgarian , and any finger or toe in russian . 
  i imagine ancient russians were a little bit overenthusiastic . 
  like `` hurray !, 
  our slavic orthodox mentors taught us a new word . 
  let 's call everything with it !, 
    and \u0414\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 is short version of \u0415\u0432\u0434\u043e\u043a\u0438\u044f , which i think is originally russian name . 
  it 's from ancient greek * eudocia * . 
    for the word '' \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d '' to mean something good , it follows the same logic as `` sick '' in english, 
  * terrific * fits even better in this pattern . 
   but i think the name is more used in russia than modern bulgaria . 
  true . 
  caran d'ache ultra violet is a wonderful purple . 
  and pelikan edelstein topaz is the perfect turquoise . 
  yes , yes , yes . 
  i am myself on a brink of ordering a rainbow 1.3 mm stub . 
  the capping system is a bit odd , though . 
  it 's not magnetic . 
  they have a stub nib option . 
  ef , f , m , b , and stub ( 1.3 mm , presumably ) . 
  how do you like its nib ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  thank you . 
  preordered mine with 1.3 mm stub . 
  it 's not that rare in eastern europe and russia . 
  it was ubiquitous in the 90 's . 
  though , mostly because the meat was n't on the menu . 
  you will be totally fine . 
  sofia is a very safe city , just like any other european capital . 
  if you are sober and sane , you will be ok . 
  visit other cities . 
  like plovdiv and veliko tarnovo . 
  the bus tickets there will cost you just $ 7 . 
  quality hotel room there could be found for $ 15 . 
  i would recommend star hotel in plovdiv . 
  it is quite old , but comfortable , inexpensive , and located right in the middle of tourist/walking/night-life area . 
  there are a lot of different stuff is going on in plovdiv right now . 
  veliko tarnovo is a breathtakingly beautiful little city . 
  get a room in the varusha district , the old town not far from the ancient fortress . 
  i stayed there in the hotel varusha for $ 12,5 . 
  in sofia you can check the easyhotel . 
  it will be the cheapest single room accommodation at about $ 21 . 
  hostels in the city center will cost you the same or little less . 
  take euros with you . 
  when converting them into leva ( bulgarian currency ) look for the rate that is as close to the 1.9558 leva for $ 1 as possible . 
  anything below 1.95 is a rip-off . 
  national park vitosha in sofia is a great place to hike or ride a mountain bike . 
  though , the bike trails there all look quite extreme to me . 
  there are few bike rentals around the south park -- the huge park zone in the southern part of sofia . 
  you can get a bike there and ride in the park and/or explore the city . 
  visconti rembrandt can be disassembled very easily . 
  the nib and feed are friction fit , and the nib collar screws in into the section . 
  the converter that sometimes supplied with it ( it depends on the retailer ) could be disassembled too . 
  you have found where / u/the _ illest is working . 
  many black and grey inks are water resistant . 
  pelikan 4001 brilliant black often could be found in the stationery stores and is quite waterproof . 
  it will not smudge easily . 
  lamy black , waterman intense black , and parker black are clinging to paper quite good too . 
  i will find out in about three weeks , hopefully . 
  yes . 
  preordered it . 
  i like the looks , interesting filling system , interesting nib ( chose 1.3 mm stub ) . 
  here is [ some shaky vertical video ] ( http://tv7.bg/%d0%94%d0%be%d0%b1%d1%80%d0%be-%d1%83%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be-%d0%91%d1%8a%d0%bb%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f-/%d0%9b%d1%83%d0%b4-%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%88%d1%8a%d0%bd-%d0%b2-%d0%a1%d0%bb%d1%8a%d0%bd%d1%87%d0%b5%d0%b2-%d0%b1%d1%80%d1%8f%d0%b3_l.102_i.10199204.html#.vgw2sroqpbc ) . 
  tubular nibs are only steel . 
  i will . 
  this one is not very expensive . 
  it is cheaper in europe , with discount , closer to $ 210 with a free shipping . 
  and the next limited edition from visconti is at least three times more expensive . 
  you are right . 
  it probably did . 
  yes . 
  scabiosa loves wet pens . 
  it looks like for many people the true gateway drug is a mechanical keyboard . 
  [ la couronne du comte ] ( http://www.lacouronneducomte.nl/webstore/main/visconti-system-p-959.html ) sells them separately . 
  also , visconti is a little bit too tough on the retailers , so many of them just do not list visconti 's spare parts on their sites but would be willing to sell if you will ask them by email . 
  why not order one of those pepsi bottle of pilot blue-black from ebay ? 
  it is only $ 30-35 with international shipping . 
  engeika.com also have those in stock . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.de/pelikan-301135-4001-royal-blue/dp/b000ktb24y/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1444232424&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=pelikan+ink+1l ) , however , is the ultimate bargain . 
  faber-castell nibs works perfectly fine on twsbi 580 . 
  where did you ordered it from ? 
  hmm ... 
  i also ordered from them , but did n't heard anything yet . 
  i ordered it with 1.3 mm stub . 
  may be this is why it takes longer . 
  contacted them and they answered that indeed the nib will take another week to arrive . 
  this is not the modern version . 
  waterman inks are also often available in the offline stores . 
  if you can find them where you live , it would be even better option . 
  zeus is my strobist, 
  for most of my life the inflation was quite brutal . 
  these rare occurrences always made me sad . 
  because i was able to buy at least twice more stuff on that forgotten money in spring , than in fall . 
  hmm ... kind of pricey for the one of the most ubiquitous thing on the earth . 
   police : are you classified as human ?
