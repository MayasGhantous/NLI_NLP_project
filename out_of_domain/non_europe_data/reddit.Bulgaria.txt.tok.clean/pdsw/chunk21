  the rhodia 80gsm paper you will find in many rhodia less expensive pads and notebooks is not that slick as the 90gsm ivory paper found in the webnotebook and the rhodia r pads . 
  i would n't call it coarse , but it definitely more feedbacky, 
  it seems they 've silently changed something in their production process about a year or two ago . 
  older webnotebooks do not bleed at all unless you literally pour the ink on it . 
  newer webbies and rhodiaramas can bleedthrough with some inks . 
  still good enough for the well behaved inks or a problematic ones in a drier/finer nibs . 
  try fabriano bioprima book 85gsm paper commonly available in the fabriano ecoqua series of notebooks and journals . 
  this paper provides exactly right amount of feedback .

  red caviar is the ultimate food . 
  it contains all the required nutrients in the right proportions . 
  and the taste is divine . 
  i was exposed to it since my childhood , though . 
  back in the days we were eating it not because we were fancy or rich , quite the opposite actually . 
  on the late soviet union 's kamchatka peninsula red caviar was more readily available than chicken . 
  basic is a nice pen . 
  f-c 's nibs are one of the best steel nibs on the market , but the balance of the pen could be an issue for some people . 
  personally , i 've found out that i ca n't use it for any extended writing sessions .

  in fact , it 's quite the opposite .
