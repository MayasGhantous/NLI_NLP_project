  even if they wo n't , the ebay customer service employee will definitely look at your sales and how many items you 've listed when he/she will be considering the next limits raise . 
  does n't work with items that often bought in quantities or together with other items , though . 
  herlitz my.book flex a4 . 
  it 's holiday season , almost every package is being delayed . 
  at least international ones . 
  for cheaper and cozy -- [ divaka ] ( http://divaka.bg/ ), 
  pork , pork , and more pork sounds totally awesome to me . 
  if you absolutely need to use low quality paper , than some inks like * pelikan 4001 brilliant black * or this sub 's favorite * noodler 's x-feather * will make it possible . 
  but using quality paper like rhodia , clairefontaine , fabriano , and some other brands will provide you the best writing experience and ability to use any ink you like . 
  create a child theme, 
  saw it in airport shops in munich and frankfurt for $ 190 . 
  guess staying away from the touristy places will save you quite a lot . 
  [ zeichen-center ] ( http://www.zc77.de/cgi-bin/scgi?sid=1&amp;se=1&amp;kd=0&amp;sp=deu&amp;nm=ebene2.html&amp;rid=3043&amp;ebene=4&amp;menu=ebene4.html ) lists it for $ 127 excluding vat . 
  not good for pens with water-based inks . 
  russian post is terrible , so package is probably genuinely lost . 
  try to ask them to wait for the package to arrive a little bit more . 
  it 's holiday season , delays are inevitable . 
  thank you . 
  have a nice day too . 
  this is how populist head of state looks and feels . 
  all we need now is just marine le pen to fuck this planet up once again . 
  it 's christmas time . 
  and the world 's economy seems to be on the rise . 
  postal hubs around the world are heavily congested . 
  the mail delayed virtually in every direction . 
  lets hope the postal services will use all these extra money to improve their facilities and hire more people . 
  ebay and paypal are glitchy past few months . 
  i live in the capital city center irl . 
  it 's just ass freezing right now . 
  i remember the new year like 8-10 years ago . 
  it was stormwind back then . 
  is dalaran have better fireworks now ? 
  the postal connection between usa and europe was a total mess this december . 
  the package is either delayed or lost . 
  the buyer is entitled to the full refund . 
  in bulgaria we have coffee in every movie theater . 
  espresso , mocha , cappuccino , whatever you like . 
  often , with a choice : in porcelain cup to drink before the screening , or in cardboard cup to take with you . 
  but this is bulgaria , you can have a coffee literally everywhere here . 
  i stick with bbc and deutsche welle -- not exactly political news , rather general news , but both of these institutions have a long record of correct reporting and high fact-checking standards . 
  got one of these a few days ago . 
  i have a theory that they are attracted by low prices . 
  unity does n't mean thinking alike . 
  unity means respect to each other and ability to maintain dialogue . 
  when on zebra crossing , it is not * jay * walking . 
  it is just walking . 
  [ this series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%8a%d1%87%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%ba+%d0%bd%d0%b0+%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%bb%d1%8e%d1%87%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%86%d0%b0 ) is nice . 
  i like [ this tv channel ] ( http://www.bloombergtv.bg/video ) but i am afraid you would need a bulgarian ip to watch it . 
  it 's a travel show . 
  there are * no native google drive client . 
  raw development software is lagging behind adobe 's acr . 
  but the most dev-related things works basically the same way as on mac . 
  if you are true mac fan , i would recommend to stick with the unity desktop environment . 
  in my very personal and humble opinion , it is the most polished , and the closest to `` just works '' de on linux . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm here for two years by now and my experience is completely opposite . 
  i never encountered anything like this . 
  oftentimes people switch to english as soon as they hear my accent . 
  which could be mildly frustrating because i was getting prepared for the dialogue , rehearsed my entire part in my head several times . 
   and is easily extensible, 
  that 's the point of unity . 
  it does n't need to be extended , it works right out of the box . 
  all i did after install was a change of a wallpaper . 
  gnome 3 is great de , so is mate . 
  to each his own . 
  but honestly , being extensible is a selling point of 90 % of all linux des . 
  unity stands out . 
  all third-party solutions have their drawbacks . 
  [ this converter ] ( http://scribemarket.com/shop/accessories/converters/kaweco-mini-converter/ ) fits al sport perfectly . 
  this thread kinda explain what happened in 2016 . 
  a list full of celebrities . 
  we need a responsible and experienced politician to clean up all this mess . 
  my vote is for angela merkel . 
  she is far from ideal , but she is politician and experienced one indeed . 
  photos in messages do not work for two months straight already . 
  may be even longer . 
  not sure it counts as `` works '' ... 
  rhodia/clairefontaine . 
  they have blank notebooks too . 
  fabriano is a great cheaper option . 
  what other parties involved ?? 
  it counts as russia . 
  with her own plaid comforter . 
  how cute . 
  writing . 
  supplies are almost free . 
  or free if you are not particularly thin-skinned . 
  cold turkey ... and other meats, 
  look for kaweco 060 nibs . 
  they come in different colors and all widths , including `` calligraphy '' ones . 
  [ here they are without section part , nib units only ] ( http://scribemarket.com/type/accessories/nibs/?filter_brand=kaweco ) . 
  both pelikan 4001 violet and montblanc lavender purple will behave much better on sub-par paper . 
  and they are nice purples . 
  white coffee in mcdonalds . 
  seriously , this , stilton , and honey roasted ham are the best things about the u.k. and i ca n't think of anything else to add to this list . 
  yep . 
  you will be able to enjoy graphics on 5/10 level of settings with very good fps . 
  * you may want to reduce ground clutter to minimum , though . 
  does n't affect the beauty of the landscapes much . 
  there is a montblanc boutique not far from there .
