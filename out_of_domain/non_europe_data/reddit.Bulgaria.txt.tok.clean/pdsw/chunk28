  yes, 
  you are more likely to be killed by a car rather than a warrior , we should ban autonomous cars . 
   ironically that is a great way to purify water, 
  disinfect , not purify . 
  dead biota and dirt do n't magically disappear . 
  well , dirty water is not pure . 
  it was my point . 
  also , a layer of ground charcoal between two pieces or clean fabric make a better and cheaper filter than a white t-shirt . 
  world of warcraft : netherlands , shadows of brexit, 
  well , those `` insurgents '' are fighting bad guys , really bad guys . 
  when i first visited bulgaria , one of the first things that surprised me was how few insects are around . 
  even when you are sitting on a terrace on a hot summer night with the lights on . 
  i am from the north , and we have much more numerous and nastier looking insects there . 
  there are plenty , actually . 
  including quite big supermarkets , like t-market on ruchei square or fantastico in studentski grad . 
  customs is not your problem . 
  you can not and should not care about other countries customs offices . 
  correos de mexico is terrible . 
  probably , even more terrible than russian post . 
  so ship with ems if you can . 
  or anyway with tracking , signature , insurance . 
  expect up to 60 days in transit otherwise . 
  if the tracking will say something along the lines `` refused/rejected '' , you are clear . 
  you will need to call ebay and ask them to check the tracking , though . 
   the turning torso is the residential building and you can rent an apartment ( which are range from 45 to 190 square meters ) for less than $ 375 u.s. 
  dollars per square meter per year .

  i have bought a packet of pure cacao powder recently to make hot chocolate : 1 teaspoon of powder , artificial sweetener i 'm ok with , ~ 6 teaspoons of heavy cream . 
  it 's tasty . 
  but i wonder if it knock me out of keto if i drink more than one cup a day ? 
  the nutrition facts table on the powder package say 10 grams of carbs per 100g of powder . 
  but the internet says it 's 50 grams per 100 grams , though the 29g of them are fibers , which is still 21 grams of net carbs . 
  who 's right and who 's wrong ? 
  this is my first g-shock and i like it . 
  so far i think this is the most comfortable watch i ever worn . 
  it 's lite , it hides under the cuff with no troubles and it sits on my wrist perfectly . 
  i have very poor eyesight , that 's why i have sold all my analog dive watches and switched to digital . 
  i can read the time instantly on this one . 
  though , the backlight duration ca n't be adjusted on this particular module , its default value of approximately 1.5 second is enough to read the time , the day and the date at night . 
  and another great thing -- it seems the elevated rubber bezel around the face of the watch is really working . 
  i hope it will protect the glass from the scratches . 
  i was hating catching scratches on my divers . 
  the g-5600e-1jf is a jdm model but as far as i know it does n't differ from the european market model -1 dr. 
  even on the back it marked simply as g-5600e , so the difference is on the price tag which bears the full model name and the price in yens ( 14000 \u00a5 ) . 
  got it for $ 160 including shipping and handling . 
  katzu higuchi have it for $ 158 , though . 
  btw , it 's made in china and the buckle says casio china . 
  photo with the simple cardboard box it was shipped in : http://i.imgur.com/5zglp.jpg, 
  so i slipped in the shower an fell out of the bath tub to the bathroom floor hitting it hard with both of my arms yesterday . 
  long story short , i have fractured radius and triquetral bones in my right arm and just bruised my left arm , it 's fully functional now and almost does n't hurt too bad anymore . 
  apparently , the g-shock did n't allowed my left wrist to bend to extreme angle . 
  here is the obligatory pic : http://imgur.com/ovsjd, 
  let 's say you are level 90 warrior . 
  so you asking your class trainer to get a second class . 
  he offers you a list of classes available for your race minus warrior , your current class . 
  you chose one and after a short intro to the class lore and mechanics you are getting stripped of your gear ( it comes to your bags ) , downleveled to level 1 ( or level 10 to deal with the starting zones limitations ) and teleported to appropriate quest hub . 
  i have asus x201e notebook with the ulv sandy bridge based celeron 847 cpu and ssd . 
  it usually boots in 18 -- 20 seconds . 
  currently , i am running mint 15 mate edition on it ( sorry , but the / r/mint is more dead than alive and the issue is most probably common between any ubuntu-based distros with 3.8 kernel ) . 
  today i have disabled graphical greater by replacing ` quiet splash ` with ` text ` in grub config . 
  when i rebooted i found out what slows down my boot . 
  initialisation of the rc6 system takes 3 -- 4 seconds every boot . 
  i tried to disable rc6 by putting ` i915.i915 _ enable_rc6 = 0 ` in grub config , but it does n't helped ( and acpi reported about 25 % less battery life , so i enabled it back ) . 
  googling brought up a lot of issues with rc6 on sandy bridge machines , but i have n't experienced anything bad save for 3 -- 4 seconds delay on boot . 
  is there any chances to fix this or should i patiently wait till it will be fixed ( if ever ) in some future kernel update ? 
  received a couple of quo vadis habana smooth . 
  mine are made in germany . 
  but the paper , 96 pages of smooth white 85gsm , looks similar to the one in the rhodia notebooks . 
  the paper is great . 
  absolutely perfect . 
  the cover is made of 1mm thick hard carton and covered with leatherette . 
  should be sturdy . 
  my first little disappointment , however , is that it does n't opens flat . 
  may be when i will write on more pages the spine will break in somehow ? 
  the second tiny one is that 5.5 mm ruling feels substantially more cramped than the leuchtturm 's 6mm . 
  i would prefer 7mm like in rhodia webbie , but i think i can live with it . 
  more information density is a good thing after all .

   a gun shot ended the standoff between osce observers and rebel gunmen , harriet salem ( @harrietsalem ) reports from the crash scene in grabovo . 
   the commander of the rebel unit , a man called ilya who is known as commander glum , expressed annoyance as the osce team stood its ground , keen to access the scenes of carnage . 
   `` osce came here without negotiating , '' he shouted , as they prepared to leave . 
  `` now there are none of our bosses here who can be in charge of making a decision , so go away , and when you negotiate this come back . 
   `` we did n't agree to meet the osce here , go away , '' he added , firing a warning shot . 
   the five-strong convoy departed rapidly .
