  edit : formatting, 
  hello / r/fountainpens ,, 
  i know the topics about the ink usage are popping here every few months . 
  if you are long enough here , you were probably answered this question a few times already . 
  i , however , would like to ask you about the paper : journals , loose leaf , post-it notes -- you name it . 
  how many pages are you covering with ink on a monthly basis , and what makes you do so ? 
  let 's start . 
  i work in it and trying to learn new stuff every day . 
  i fill about 75 a5 pages per month journaling , doing notes for work , and studying . 
  another 15 pages on average adds my bullet journal . 
  random notes , shopping lists , etc. 
  probably add ten pages more .
