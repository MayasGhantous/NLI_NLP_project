  this is the brain !, 
  every class has its fun . 
  pick the toon with the most things like rep on it and kill all others . 
  if you feel bored with it , either do n't play at all or do something different like retro raiding , stupid achievements or new professions . 
  [ this thing is amazing ] ( http://vitalikovalenko.com/2012/logitech-g13-review.html ), 
  unity tweak tool has dpi settings for that . 
  i have 1366x768 on 11,6 '' and 1.5 x factor works great for my myopia . 
  though , os x like hidpi mode would be far better . 
  it only scales up fonts . 
  [ / r/buildapc ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc ) awaits you . 
  there is exactly the course is ongoing right now at coursera . 
  if we could exchange one for another the earth will be so much happier place to live . 
  chrome, 
  sublime text 3, 
  notes, 
  calendar, 
  oh , between canada day and independence day , your comment is utterly ironic . 
  it also a good thing to drop wasd completely . 
  use mouse for movements and g13 's marked wasd keys for the main rotation . 
  try jamon, 
  inorganic are n't really better . 
  ever seen how many dust and lint could accumulate under the cooling fan ? 
  how much dirt any exposed grease attracts ? 
  if the doorway to some public place have double doors , one of them always locked . 
  always . 
  and you ca n't say which one until you try . 
  i do n't know . 
  may be they think that the hinges wo n't wear off this way ... 
  yeah , when in bad mood i tend to shake the handle really hard . 
  asus x201e comes with ubuntu sticker on it . 
  a really great explanation . 
  what is it ? 
  a circus for harpies ? 
  mineral water is often like 700-1000 mg of potassium per liter . 
  i do n't know any of the us brands . 
  just read from the label of the local brand . 
  it was 700-800 mg of k and comparable amounts of mg , na , cl etc. 
  however , it is ** mineral ** water , not just drinking water . 
  how much you saved on each comparing to the retail price ? 
  til you can built a decent house out of the apple products boxes . 
  rt are fear mongers , though , pretty stupid ones . 
  if the 35 % heavy cream makes you excited than the 30 % -40 % cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche will blow your head off . 
  looks awesome . 
  do n't forget typewriter mode . 
  i use it all the time in sublime text . 
  somebody , please , ban russia . 
  thank you . 
  oil . 
  actually , about 80 % of men think that girls with any boobs and even those without them at all are sexy . 
  so you are in an overwhelming majority here . 
  well , you 'll be able to switch back to your main class . 
  benefits are :, 
  - no rep grind, 
  - all your bags and bank slots, 
  alts need all the rep , bags , non account wide vanity items, 
  then you have to support two chars . 
  14 slot is n't that much . 
  you still have to level another class to learn it . 
  you do n't need no anti-virus and cleanup software . 
  most of such things are quite fishy . 
  though , there are a couple of programs that records any files apps you installing are putting in the different system folders so you can easily remove them all once you decide to uninstall those apps later . 
  if you are n't testing like dozens of apps every week you do n't need it either since it 's easy to clean up leftover files manually . 
  i will restore all the apps with all the settings you made . 
  world of warcraft , diablo iii , starcraft 2 run great on a mac . 
  intraspecies violence, 
  rather than showing kindness to each other we should n't hurt each other . 
  kindness could be harmful , not being a dick has much more flawless value . 
  in many ways . 
  kindness is subjective . 
  what good for some people are bad for others . 
  guys have a job . 
  transmit . 
  in a month after purchase i changed my server and decided not to setup ftp there . 
  ssh in midnight commander do the thing for me . 
  so transmit is just sitting on my imac totally useless . 
  true . 
  unity on 13.04 is so much faster ... 
  under five seconds ? 
  is this a cold boot ? 
  i run ubuntu 13.04 on a celeron 847 ( 1.1 ghz ) notebook and it took about 20-22 seconds to boot . 
  i have my / home encrypted , though . 
  ah , 12 seconds sound more reasonable . 
  considering your cpu is faster and the tall of encryption is probably quite noticeable on such under-powered machines . 
  youtube-dl is a gem !, 
  just open terminal , cd to the folder you want your video to be in , type ` youtube-dl - t ` , paste a link to youtube video you want and hit enter . 
  video will be downloaded in the highest quality available and its title will be the filename ( that 's what ` - t ` parameter for ) . 
  i forgot about those awful youtube download websites completely . 
  pro-tip : 1 ) ssh to your home computer from work, 
  2 ) chose and feed fresh videos to youtube-dl, 
  3 ) get back home after work and watch videos in your favourite video player in full hd while dining . 
  let 's try . 
  use lxde or mate of xfce . 
  lubuntu will be smoother . 
  i found the solution : http://askubuntu.com/questions/102140/boot-optimisation-takes-too-long, 
  as [ amauk said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ubuntu/comments/1lxc3r/enabling_rc6_states_takes_way_too_long_during_the/cc3o9pt ) it was n't rc6 fault . 
  you were right . 
  it was n't rc6 . 
  thank you for pointing to right direction . 
  linux mint mate edition is also ok . 300 megs of ram used after boot . 
  yet mate is undoubtedly not so eyecandy as pantheon .
