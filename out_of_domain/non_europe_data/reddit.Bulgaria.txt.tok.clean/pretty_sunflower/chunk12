  anything that does n't fit the male path laid out by society ( job , wife , kid ) is blanket deemed to be childish and seen as a lack of maturity . 
  in reality , what this mindset does is completely eliminate the concept of male choice . 
  there truly is no choice when the options are `` be a man '' or be considered a child for your whole adult life . 
  so we 're funneling our men into standardized lives of a job , and a wife , and two kids and a mini van and a single home where they can work on maintaining the grass in their 0.25 acre lot on the weekends , all the while holding the threat of emasculating them right back into childhood if they do n't comply . 
  then we wonder why they are killing themselves off at record breaking rates . 
  ** men ** - yes , read it , ** men ** - not children , not neets , not peter pans , not any other term you want to assign to them , are leaving the bounds of what is expected of them because it no longer serves them . 
  men are growing tired of the sole purpose of their existence being to fulfill a woman 's genetic urges to reproduce , and then provide for said offspring . 
  look around you man . 
  go out with your friends for a beer , take a gander over at / r/relationships , meet some random dudes and talk to them and just listen to the stories people tell . 
  infidelity , divorce , misery and hopelessness . 
  i do n't know about you , but i see it everyday . 
  i see my friends one by one marrying their sweethearts , having children , said sweethearts getting fat , working their asses off and being unable to pursue any of the things that made them happy in the past . 
  i see the light in their eyes dying and there is a decent chance that at some point in the next few decades at least one of them may give in and blow his brains out . 
  but while they are sinking in this quicksand , they still consider me the childish one , for not settling down yet , for not wanting to have children , for pursuing my interests , for doing irresponsible things like taking a day trip to atlantic city to gamble just because i fucking feel like . 
  that 's how convinced they are that they are doing the right thing . 
  they are `` being men '' . 
  and i 'll realize that when i grow up eventually . 
  this dragged on , but the tl ; dr is modern men are increasingly unhappy with every generation . 
  the previous standard of go to school , get a job , find a wife and have kids is no longer applicable . 
  men are breaking out of it and women are pissed off . 
  i do n't have a solution but i know enough to know there is a problem and just calling men selfish and infatuated with `` entertainment saturation '' is just sweeping the problem under the rug - a disservice to all of us . 
  i dunno , but i want to see this . 
  well for starters , have some self respect . 
  do you really want to be with someone who is constantly questioning whether they want to be with you ? 
  who is constantly comparing you to someone else ? 
  who you constantly have to fight for ?!, 
  that 's not a relationship . 
  i 'd love to write more but reading your post got me so pissed off that i need to step out and take a few deep breaths , count to 10 or something . 
  where did all this cuckery come from ? 
  why exactly do you have responsibility over this person ? 
  a ) you 're not over her . 
  b ) her telling you she is going to wait is just taking your sexuality hostage . 
  c ) she has most likely already hooked up with someone . 
  d ) decide if you want to get back together with her . 
  if you do , pursue it . 
  if not , stop talking to her . 
  you 're unnecessarily prolonging pain . 
  e ) go to vegas . 
  yeah it sucks . 
  you 'll get over it . 
  there are no virgins left so it 's something you 'll have to get over . 
  you need to learn not to ask things you do n't want to know the answer to . 
  ------------ personal viewpoint --------------, 
  this here is just how i see things , take it or leave it . 
  a mmf and a ffm threesome are two completely different things . 
  females will vehemently disagree so take that into consideration , but with all the emotions set aside , a mmf threesome is just a girl being pin cushioned . 
  now hold on to your buttcheeks , we are both about to get roasted . 
  oh wow , you guys were more than perfect ? 
  for those whole three weeks ? 
  you are * three * weeks in and you already have to fight for her . 
  this is the beginning of a relationship . 
  the honeymoon zone . 
  the peaches and cream . 
  if you 're doing this * now * what are you going to be doing two years from now ? 
  the best way to handle the situation is to create distance and see where she goes . 
  you ca n't convince someone to like you . 
  that 's not how people work . 
  that 's not how any of this works . 
  relationships are n't a point system where you 're trying to beat someone else , which is what you 're describing . 
  do n't go down that path . 
  there are no average women on the internet . 
  why the break up if i may ask ? 
  i hear you and i apologize if you take my harshness as rudeness , but i am trying to save you some heartache here . 
  if she saw real potential in you , you would n't be in this situation . 
  just my 2c from my personal experience . 
  i am not going to recommend this . 
  but i will say that if i was in your situation i would try to enjoy what amsterdam has to offer . 
  it seems like there were some really deep seated issues and there is no immediate resolution . 
  a ) dude is using your mom . 
  b ) your mom is happy to be getting banged out by a guy 15 years younger than her and it 's helping her maintain confidence during the separation . 
  i guarantee you it 's something she throws at your dad all the time . 
  c ) if your dad still pays for the house , you should voice your displeasure at what your mother is doing , because it is pretty fucked up . 
  d ) can you move in with your dad ? 
  e ) this is an actually sad situation . 
  i feel for you :(, 
  you poor , poor soul :(, 
  both ? 
  from personal experience , a ffm threesome is an actual triangle where all parties can please each other . 
  a mfm threesome where the males are n't bi is just two guys fucking a chick . 
  because the point of being mg2 is playing against other mg2s until you are so much better than them that you become dmg . 
  the system is broken if you are mg2 and playing against lems . 
  unless you 're dicking around in a lobby with 4 of your douchecunt friends , you are screwing over 4 people who are trying to go all tryhard . 
  tl ; dr - you 're a jackass . 
  that everyone responded to honestly , i 'm sure . 
  [ it 's just a game ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fauor2c.png ), 
  100 % of the time . 
  paintball would have had a far more lasting impact and felt far less retarded if there was some actual skill to shooting other than who can flick their fingers faster and unleash more paint at the other person . 
  we got super drunk during one of the coldest winters in my lifetime and pissed in a muffin tray which then froze . 
  then we put the piss pucks in various freshman frequented places . 
  extra dirty hendricks martini , straight up . 
  go to atlantic city . 
  stay at the borgata . 
  get one of the big suites with the hot tub . 
  bring your own cocaine , buy nothing there . 
  do n't go to the strip clubs , just hire a couple to come to your room . 
  eat at izakaya . 
  get a table at mur mur . 
  none of this is cheap , but the stuff you are asking for do n't come cheap here . 
  ketel and soda with lime . 
  same .
