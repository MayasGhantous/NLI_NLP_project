  i am open to buying one if you price my 2 karambits fairly . 
  feel free to take a look - http://steamcommunity.com/id/redefined5888/, 
  86 % never has been or ever will be qs, 
  lounge is 85 % non english speaking scammers . 
  `` ban everything , so i do n't have to actually parent my offspring '', 
  float ? 
  this is a shit price for even the shittiest doppler . 
  i 'm pretty sure even lounge pays more than that . 
  no lowballerino loungerino !!!! ) ) ), 
  let 's get rid of porn because kids might watch it ... 
  send a trade offer for your karambit and i 'll accept . 
  on mobile . 
  c/o me as 34k on the shadow daggers . 
  i think your math is slightly off there, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  how is this law homophobic in the first place ? 
  the whole thing is about transgender facilities ... 
  i may be interested in buying it , hit me up on reddit once you have a price in mind . 
  silent aim, 
  flawless ps corner , very black . 
  screens or anything ? 
  because we 're lounge still . 
  why are n't posts offering 80 % prices to anything banned yet ? 
  i read the whole thing ? 
  it 's goes to shit once you 're past market . 
  you need to provide actual screens in game . 
  the corner and pattern are not well visible on it as is . 
  if the guy did n't give you screens , he 's fucking you over with a likely shitty corner . 
  ask for real screens, 
  can throw in a key or two if you 're interested . 
  i do n't have 4k screens , i will edit my title . 
  yeah , who does n't ? 
  check this one out . 
  god damn , someone give him a price so i can buy it, 
  so like this ? 
  enough to go over your c/o . 
  honestly depends on what you value my knife at . 
  here is my [ trade link ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=38607669&amp;token=r2yvk_h0 ) . 
  it has a better float than the one you linked too . 
  here is my trade link if you decide to make an offer , 
  [ trade link ] ( https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=38607669&amp;token=r2yvk_h0 ), 
  what are your skins worth ? 
  agreed . 
  i 'm willing to go down a couple of keys due to the corner but 175k is my mark . 
  there is a guy selling what you 're looking for that has a pixel corner , but he 's asking 220 . 
  but yes , hit me up if you decide you want it . 
  damn dude fn hydroponics tanked in price ... 
  check this out . 
  0.003 float , great corner . 
  my b/o is 175 pure or more in items . 
  i sold my 0.27 dlore for way lower than i should have . 
  id rather not talk about it . 
  but then they just hop on a different reddit account , linked to a different key holder account and do the same thing . 
  the 3 post limit is absolutely a non existent barrier . 
  stat trak p2 very pink karambit . 
  0.02 float . 
  pretty clean corner . 
  c/o me at 205 for the karambit if you 'd like . 
  i feel like your price is a bit high for what is almost piss/ice . 
  care to negotiate ? 
  float ? 
  there 's a dude like three posts below you selling a 0.00 for 220 . 
  what makes this one special ? 
  do you have screens ? 
  can go for close to 200 , depending on how clean the corner is and how good the playside pattern is . 
  you 'd need to 4k the corner . 
  the discoloration at the tip is pretty visible though . 
  this 0.00 x doppler p1 + pures ? 
  edit : forgot link https://imgur.com/a/bjakj, 
  no thanks, 
  c/o 215k, 
  at 230 , you 're in sub 0.1 territory . 
  vac has n't had an update in nearly fifteen months . 
  either buy esea ( which is absolutely amazing , i 've never enjoyed cs more ) or hack in mm , 
  i guess we do have a bubble after all . 
  i 'll up my c/o to 220k, 
  flusha is unvaccable . 
  banning him would kill the scene completely . 
  it would mean like 4 majors were won with cheats . 
  stop being poor and buy esea . 
  or just hack . 
  either works . 
  or maybe we could start treating gender dysphoria as a mental disorder , not an identity choice ... 
  added to discuss . 
  your corner is super beat up , and that 's what matters . 
  tough to tell . 
  added . 
  i want the knife . 
  my apologies . 
  will not happen again . 
  interested . 
  added to discuss . 
  i 'll need to withdraw my c/o , bought a knife instead . 
  thanks !, 
  did n't want to wait until my shitty betting knives sold . 
  i think i 'm giving you roughly 11k overpay on the poseidon . 
  here we go . 
  time for the crash . 
  230 max, 
  c/o 22k for the ups ?
