  any interest in this ? 
  i am looking to break down a karambit fire/ice into smaller skins , interested in working something out ? 
  3 days, 
  interested ? 
  your corner seems clean so ~ 220, 
  no , 4th max . 
  fuck i want that . 
  hit me up if you 're interested in upgrading . 
  interested in some keys . 
  do you do any volume discounts ? 
  okay , adding . 
  99 % i 'm assuming ? 
  do you have screenshots ? 
  piss/ice for 255 ? 
  this should go well , 
  do n't trade on lounge . 
  it 's 99 % third world country teenagers . 
  need better pics of the corner , but 255 is a safe bet . 
  float ? 
  i have a 0.01 max pink for 145 if you decide to offer non quick buy prices , 
  i am interested in your marble fades . 
  not a quick buyer so do n't worry . 
  can i see screens by any chance ? 
  if you want to c/o me , i am offering 225 pure + this m9 . 
  thanks . 
  the most piss/ice of all the piss ices :p, 
  yeah , i mean if you 're into that sort of thing , this knife is perfect !, 
  same here . 
  and the official reddit app is shit . 
  i ca n't use it for what i used alien blue for . 
  1 star . 
  fuck your self . 
  i have a max pink 0.01 for 145 . 
  not interested to quicksell though . 
  screens of the corner ? 
  you 'd have to add though . 
  my bottom is 140 if interested . 
  my bottom is 140 if you want to shoot an offer . 
  not looking to quicksell though . 
  sorry , didnt get the notification . 
  it 's barely tricolor , i would n't do more than 240 . 
  that site needs to fuck itself . 
  even lounge pays better . 
  c/o 250 pure, 
  p3 are mostly double skins . 
  that website has killed karambits for a while . 
  you can get more for a good one but you have to find someone who actually wants it for a playknife . 
  3rd max , beat up corner, 
  c/o me 230 for the medusa, 
  what 's the float of the medusa ? 
  i am on mobile for the next hour or so . 
  if you can wait , then yes . 
  otherwise , feel free to send it , and i will accept . 
  do n't worry guys , they have to die eventually .

  i just sent , 
  my c/o was 230 ... 
  not trying to be an ass or anything , but your b/o is wayyyy too high for a not even 4th max fire/ice, 
  best not lose my coins ... . 
  still down for me, 
  yes , sorry , i 'll edit, 
  c/o 140, 
  c/o 160,

  accepted , thanks, 
  i , too am in a gang and freddie gray was a piece of shit . 
  i 'm glad he died . 
  why did no one consult me or our other members about freddie or peace ? 
  peace makes no one any money . 
  no , thanks,

  that 's really high , even for a 0.00 x, 
  a 0.008 sold for 60 like an hour ago . 
  c/o 140 for the m9, 
  i 'm on mobile , but if you hop in my profile to get my trade link and send an offer , i 'll buy for bo,

  sent, 
  sent, 
  sent, 
  is that too much ? 
  it wo n't be fixed . 
  the owner has been awol for like , what , two weeks now ? 
  watch , one day you will wake up , go downstairs and the website wo n't exist anymore . 
  this was made by a 12 year old . 
  with crayons . 
  working fine my ass , i 've been trying to withdraw for two days unsuccessfully . 
  and it does n't change the fact that the owner has abandoned the site . 
  definitely too low . 
  welcome to lounge :p, 
  368 each , but whatever, 
  c/o 205k, 
  its a pretty shittacular corner,
