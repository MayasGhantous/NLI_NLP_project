  wait , fallen is complaining about cheaters ? 
  the irony here is amazing . 
  congratulations ko1n figured out a way to cheat on esea and it 's been given to a handful of semi-pro players . 
  anyone with basic coding skills , youtube and an hour to kill can bypass vac . 
  i do n't think the 5 person tag works with aeonaxx . 
  he is a friendly mob you have to mount . 
  you can already tell it will be done in an over dramatized lifetime fashion . 
  it wo n't be investigative and it wo n't reveal anything new . 
  i am just silently hoping that burke has a breakdown on dr. phil and admits he did it . 
  source to this ? 
  clemson , lsu , ohio state , stanford, 
  they spread like a plague . 
  most maryland schools seem to be 50 % kids from jersey who talk about jersey as if its heaven on earth but never end up going back ... 
  valve sucks . 
  they are a company of neckbeards who spend the majority of their time at work wheeling their desks around or throwing money at pet projects . 
  imagine you took a super shitty company ( comcast ) and you gave it three amazing ips ( i dunno , pokemon , star wars and star trek ) . 
  you 've just created valve . 
  i 'm gon na fap to this article all night . 
  put them all on dorm room lock down until the game .

  i keep thinking i should sell my car because i keep seeing it 's trade in value drop and drop and drop , but i know it 's not because i want to get the most value out of it , i just want a new car . 
  that 's ... so far away from correct . 
  this would make sense if there were actual silver players . 
  it 's mostly smurfs playing against each other . 
  i enjoy cocaine . 
  i know it 's bad , but it 's the only thing i have that has never disappointed me . 
  any boss ? 
  what 's the easiest ? 
  definitely serious . 
  i 've never been summoned in co-op . 
  do i need to be alive for the boss kill as a phantom , or does the host just need to kill the boss whether i am alive or not ? 
  i am level 58 with a +6 weapon . 
  i will try wolnir . 
  if not , i guess i will try to help people beat aldrich . 
  bloodborne is the greatest game ever made . 
  nothing else will feel the same after it . 
  i still have things i did n't beat , and i almost do n't want to , because i do n't want it to end . 
  i just wish there was more character diversity in the game . 
  awesome !, 
  are they the tools for what they do ? 
  or are you the tool for judging them for it ? 
  you get banned if you bring it up though . 
  i am tall and not-unfortunate looking . 
  my dick is average . 
  i have fat hands and fingers , no matter my body weight . 
  i only use them on bosses . 
  i have never had more than 10 at a time though .

  that 's sad . 
  what a fucking waste .

  now back to your [ mascot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1zkl1m1.jpg ) . 
  sadly , he is n't me but if he stopped being the center of ncaa investigations and started being ranked in the top 25 again , he could at least feel like me . 
  look down . 
  back up . 
  where are you ? 
  [ you 're at the national championship with the mascot your mascot could feel like . ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xf0uhqu.jpg ) .

  [ i 'm on a jeep . 
  vr is a gimmick . 
  yes , it 's fun , but a gimmick . 
  it will not replace conventional gaming or make an impact anywhere big enough for the amount of hype it is generating . 
  who are you even ... ? 
  this , but how do you get there as a bloodtinge build ? 
  it takes forever before you get any of the cool weapons . 
  have you ever even been to a national championship ? 
  high five tiger bro , that was absolutely epic !, 
  if it makes you feel better , i rank tigers like so :, 
  clemson,

  i am in anor londo now . 
  can i go back and still get the chloranthy ring , or would it not be accessible now ? 
  how does one copy this to a phone ? 
  is that possible ? 
  why not just auto ban anyone that picks hanzo/genji and cleanse the game from weebs ? 
  this guy is just trying to put the spotlight on himself so he ca n't get cut . 
  imagine the blm and generic race sensitive hippiefuck shitstorm against the 49ers if they cut him after his `` stand against racism . '', 
  fuck shrine of amana . 
  it took me like a full day of wiping to finally figure out i should go back to mejula and buy a bow and some arrows . 
  do n't you dare remind me of that bad juju ricky bobby .
