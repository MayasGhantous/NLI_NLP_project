  when you have an entire generation of a gender unsure of who they are supposed to be , it 's undoubted that a large number of them will end their lives due to a lack of belonging . 
  i 'm married but i do n't want kids . 
  i love my life way too much for that . 
  it would be ruinous to me and detrimental to a kid half of whose parental unit is disinterested in having a kid . 
  you 're not worthless because you can provide sex . 
  sex is the resource , and it 's one you 're not running out of , as long as there are men who are evolutionary driven to want to put it inside you .

  right , your value is reduced but still existent . 
  that 's more than the endless male dregs of society who are killing themselves off can say . 
  something is wrong here , it sounds like he 's not attracted to you . 
  this post is a joke and a perfect example of the / r/csgo stance on cheating . 
  that , or a cheater who is brigading to say the game is fine . 
  hack forums organize these kind of posts all the time . 
  women ... . 
  clearly not since she is shop lifting $ 20 bracelets . 
  the fuck meat is broke . 
  just stop caring . 
  the end . 
  this whole post assumes that money is not everything in life ... 
  i do n't think sommer is that hot ... 
  downvote away . 
  the nfl has become too corporate . 
  i feel like i am watching one big long commercial rather than a sporting event between two teams . . 
  why am i seeing a commercial before getting to watch this shit ? 
  / r/baltimore, 
  it 's run by a group of sjw friends , none of whom live in baltimore , who ban any dissenting opinions . 
  also they let well known users break the ever living shit out the sub rules and reddiquette without ever banning them . 
  overall a shit subreddit , but i 've found that to be the case about all local subreddits . 
  have n't watched or read that murder porn fetish of a series since . 
  it got silly after a while . 
  fuck that , non-region locked games are cancer . 
  you must have never played dota 2 with a team of four peruvian teenagers . 
  current year, 
  yeah , but then how would you virtue signal to the internet ? 
  happy to not have watched , but wish i could have taped the game to beat off to once the whole identity politics/virtue signaling era of the nfl passes . 
  black on black murder everywhere at record setting pace ? 
  no big deal . 
  one crack dealer killed by 6 cops of multi-racial composition ? 
  and it 's not even conclusive that it was n't just an accident ? 
  fuck the usa ima burn this flag during what used to be the national american pastime in protest of this shit . 
  then im gon na beat the shit out of my wife in a casino , but thats besides the point . 
  where were you when nfl is kill ? 
  me too , beating the shit out of my wife has really lost it 's luster since he got removed . 
  i still do it all the time , it just does n't get me that same rush . 
  she has started using my lingo . 
  i kind of like it . 
  is n't it implied somewhere that malekith and morathi are banging on the regular ? 
  bang every hot 21 year old in my city ? 
  it 's not a coincidence they are all dating 30 year olds you know . . 
  what would you recommend as a good hero to cheese the absolute lowest trench with and get out ? 
  i need something that can snowball and carry hard enough early/mid game to make sure late game never happens . 
  i 've had success with sven recently . 
  what are other viable options ?

  any price guidance ? 
  i am 27 , unsatisfied with my job , and unsure of well , anything really other than i do n't want to have children and i 'd really like to be doing something different with my life . 
  but i 'm like 33 % through life , i feel like i should have had this shit figured out already . 
  i am content in most areas , except my career and seeing as how it is how i spend the majority of my time , it 's a big part of things . 
  it feels like i am too deep in the game to go chasing happiness though and i need to buckle down and just earn my paycheck . 
  has anyone had similar experiences or am i just being an overdramatic pussy ? 
  i like meek 's fast and angry sounding style . 
  it 's like he 's mad at the song and you for listening to it and he 's gon na tell you exactly how he feels about it . 
  it 's hard , fast and angry . 
  perfect examples are his verse in khaled 's they do n't love you no more and the entirety of monster . 
  the only other example i can think of is the first verse of maad city . 
  i 've heard people say eminem is like that too but i feel like he tries to get too cheeky and smart with his lyrics rather than just focusing on the flow . 
  anyway , i am a total noob to all this , what is this called and what are other artists i should listen to if this is what i want to listen to ?
