  lastly , this game blows . 
  it 's a shadow of what i am used to getting from total war . 
  i am just in a roman vibe right now .

  i understand the resolution , that 's all muscle memory , but why still play at potato quality , even with today 's powerhouse pcs . 
  most new rigs can run cs at 1024x786 or even 1280x1024 on high settings at over 100fps . 
  is it just stubborn refusal or 1.6 nostalgia at this point ? 
  the 300fps@18 pixels on screen seems like a bandwagon to me . 
  looking to get a cheaper knife + other items .

  warning : some polish guy is adding people claiming to be me and trying to sell my knife .

  bo 105k for bot sake, 
  i 'm switching to non-valve platforms until the mm wild ride gets sorted out , but i ca n't understand efficacy and rws . 
  what is considered average ? 
  what should i strive for ? 
  at what number did i ` git gud ' ?

  does this company exist anymore ? 
  i ca n't find their products available anywhere . 
  their keyboard is off the website completely . 
  the mice are out of stock on every website i 've checked . 
  the only ec2-a i 've found was just a single one on amazon for $ 230 ( !!! ) . 
  is zowie still manufacturing ? 
  or are they on a massive backlog due to the explosion in demand ?

  i 'm not even sure why i 'm posting this , it 's 100 % a shitpost , i just needed somewhere to express how truly a work of art this is and how i just wish i could forget it all so i could experience it all over again . 
  the lore is the deepest and best fleshed out of anything i 've ever seen . 
  the `` wow '' moments when lore pieces came together must now be in the triple digits . 
  i love this game . 
  i love it . 
  except for orphan of kos . 
  fuck that guy . 
  i ca n't find it anywhere . 
  some dude posted it yesterday , did it get deleted ? 
  hello ,, 
  i have a ft dragon lore at 0.27 float .
