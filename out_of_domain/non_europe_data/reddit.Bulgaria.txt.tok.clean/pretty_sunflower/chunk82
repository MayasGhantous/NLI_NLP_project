  why are posts offering 80 % value for common items even allowed ? 
  i 'm talking about the people that list the amount of keys that they add and then just list a bunch of batshit insane low buyouts on the items they are willing to buy . 
  oh wow , you 're buying any karambit marble fade at 220 ? 
  so is literally everyone/anyone else . 
  if someone made a post actually selling a karambit mf at that price , it would be swallowed up in seconds . 
  what i 'm getting at , is that these posts add nothing of value to actual trading . 
  you are just stating that you are willing to pay shit tier prices for anything . 
  essentially , lounging . 
  i thought we were trying to not be lounge ?
