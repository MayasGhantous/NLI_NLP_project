  what is the ballpark on this ? 
  it is like 3-4 pixels off of 3rd max as shown by the position of the l. it 's float value 0.03 , but has a bta clean corner .

  the knife is 4-5 pixels off of being third max per the guide , as the l is almost completely on the blade and you can see the red on the outside of the ring . 
  i am mostly looking for item offers . 
  not interested in anything case hardened . 
  not in a hurry to sell . 
  feel free to add and discuss .

  look at that massive drop from 4/20/2016 to 4/21/2016 . 
  first off , i do n't think i ever had items to be at $ 3,000 . 
  i had two dopplers , i traded one for a p2 stattrak , which i then flipped for keys . 
  then i traded the other one + pure keys to get my fire/ice . 
  but holy shit , $ 1400 drop ?

  i need to do the captcha each time and i get the cooldown , making it virtually impossible to withdraw . 
  is there a way to reload the page without having to do the verification each time ? 
  this this is atrocious piss/ice with a devastated corner . 
  good only for betting .
