  i have zero interest in doing this full time , or in making any profit from it . 
  i just really like opening cases . 
  assuming i sell everything valuable i open , is there an educated guess as to a number of viewers that would be needed to support the keys required for the stream ? 
  obviously , i would have to invest my own beginning capital to start it off . 
  i currently play at 1024x768 black bars . 
  what is the widescreen version of that ? 
  how would i go about calculating it ? 
  i have been dabbling in 16:9 , because i played some on 1280x720 , which honestly felt great . 
  my monitor 's native resolution ( 1920x1080 ) just makes everything seem too small and far away , i ca n't headshot to save my life and there is so much to focus on . 
  hello ,, 
  i have no idea how to make this , but i thought of an awesome idea to troll my super berned out sister with . 
  can i get an image of trump 's face placed over lil jon 's with states we 've won in the background and the tag `` trump down for what '' on the bottom ? 
  does n't have to be anything super fancy . 
  can tip you since i work and pay taxes and have money ( aka trump voter ) .

  it seems like a great deal based on the msrp , and even though it 's gray market , i am absolutely willing to buy it as a present . 
  however is this a good price , or is this just marketing manipulation ? 
  any other suggestions for sub $ 1,000 semi-luxury automatic watches for a present ? 
  thanks !, 
  there is no reason why my team should go 99 % -0 % and then lose the objective because one person dancing around the objective can extend the match indefinitely ... 
  which of these would you choose and why ? 
  i like that the oris has an open back , however the longines name seems to have more longetivity and history . 
  any other suggestions around the 1k mark ? 
  i am the plan holder of our at&t family plan . 
  is there a way to receive a notification when one of the plan phones contacts a certain number ? 
  furthermore , is there a way to block one of my plan phones from contacting certain numbers at all ? 
  is there a starter guide somewhere ? 
  i seem to get ahead of myself and be facing mutons and codexes while still using assault rifles and basic armor . 
  what technologies do i prioritize ? 
  what soldier types should i stack if any ? 
  this game is so much better than me ... 
  hello ,, 
  so my fiance and i recently upgraded our house to the 150mbps fiber from verizon . 
  they installed a new box , wireless router , etc. 
  and sent us on our way . 
  in our house we have the following systems :, 
  her work laptop - a company issued dell, 
  our shared personal laptop - a macbook pro, 
  our gaming pc - home built system, 
  the work and personal laptops connect through their built in wireless ports . 
  the gaming pc is on a separate floor from the router , so it connects through one of these things - [ newegg link ] ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=1bv-000h-00014&nm_mc=knc-googleadwords-pc&cm_mmc=knc-googleadwords-pc-_-pla-_-network+-+powerline-_-1bv-000h-00014&gclid=clucp_cq7s0cfywfhgodsayc7q&gclsrc=aw.ds ) . 
  it 's not the exact same one , but it 's similar . 
  so we do n't really care about the network on her work laptop . 
  the macbook downloads things instantly at speeds like 8-9 mbps . 
  the gaming pc however shows no improvement of speed from our previous 50mbps connection . 
  it still struggles to break 1mbps when downloading . 
  how do we correct this ? 
  the ethernet bridge should allow for speeds up to 500mbps , but clearly it 's getting throttled somehow . 
  any help appreciated . 
  hello ,, 
  i just got the starter account and i 'd like to play a few games to see how i like it before putting more money into the game . 
  are there any websites that show decklists using only the cards that come with the starter set ? 
  i ca n't seem to find any . 
  thanks !, 
  so i guess since the warrior dragon cheese deck got popular everyone is playing dragon now ? 
  today i have played 3 dragon paladins , 4 dragon priests , a dragon rogue and even a dragon mage ... 
  almost makes you miss mechs :(, 
  every deck archetype just plays minions/spells on curve now . 
  draw/mulligan decide the game . 
  if i draw off-curve and he draws on curve , by turn 4 he has enough control that i know the game is over . 
  if i draw on curve and he does n't , i maintain control and win with no effort . 
  it 's completely anti-fun . 
  on every forum that i visit , the initials rp appear all the time as a super taboo poi that everyone refuses to discuss . 
  where can i learn more about rp ? 
  feel free to pm me the info if it can not be discussed on the board .
