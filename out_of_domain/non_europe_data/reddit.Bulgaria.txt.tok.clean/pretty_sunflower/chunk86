  i am curious to see what people are doing to get ready . 
  just need one . 
  tired of farming . 
  wo n't drop for some reason .

  do n't get me wrong , i love playing it casually , but i 've been watching the overwatch open due to no other esports being on and i just do n't see lasting appeal . 
  the game is too fast for spectating , it 's really hard to tell what 's going on . 
  most games are the same 6 heroes against each other , which makes sense seeing as how there is a tiny amount of heroes so you just pick the top of the meta . 
  the biggest thing though , i can sum up every game with one sentence - ana press q , reaper press q , game . 
  am i missing something here and just being a hater ? 
  i have deranked from dmg to mg2 over the weekend , all while facing 300-400hr accounts with one game . 
  is it the result of people from the banwave ranking their new accounts up ? 
  my esea account is b currently , and those games are a cakewalk compared to mg2 . 
  i see someone on the other team drop a 40 bomb pretty much every game . 
  honestly , i am embarrassed playing on my esea acct at mg2 , but i am doing way better than in mm ...

  i do n't want to get into a discussion about whether people think it 's okay for cosmetic items in a game to cost thousands of dollars , but much of the reason for the exorbitant pricing of rare items ( lores , rubies , sapphires , etc. ), 
  was the hoarding of them by gambling site bots and moderators . 
  it was an artificial creation of demand by limiting supply . 
  skin gambling is gone , obviously site mods are going to be trying to cash out by selling rare items one by one at the insane prices they created , but would n't it be logical to expect us to see some sort of normalization in prices once they are done milking the market ? 
  sapphires were expensive because at any given time only 1-2 were up for sale while dozens were sitting on bot inventories . 
  obviously i am sure these items will still be expensive , but i do n't see the logic of a karambit gamma doppler being $ 800 unless you can deposit that into a gambling website for $ 800 . 
  or even regular dopplers still being $ 300 - $ 400 other than gamblers trying to cash out whatever they put in . 
  the way i understand the workings of cheats and vac , hacks read from and write to the game 's memory using hopefully undetected offsets in order to perform their functions . 
  vac is usually aware of modules that are interacting with the cs : go memory , but does not ban because it does not know that the module is a cheat . 
  it only bans when a specific offset is deemed to be used by a hack , in which case the modules that are using that particular offset get banned . 
  so here is my question . 
  why allow these modules to persist in the first place ? 
  are there any legitimate programs that would need to write to cs : gos memory ? 
  in a competitive environment , cs : go should be able to run in an insular state , with no programs interacting with it 's memory . 
  if they do , insta ban . 
  can anyone more educated on the topic explain why this is or is n't a thing ?

  i am not looking to make a profit , but i would like to have something that will sell if i ever decide to change .

  it 's mine , i like it , but i am debating upgrading . 
  the play side is almost completely black and the tip has a greenish tinge to it . 
  my play skin . 
  worth anything over market due to sticker or no ? 
  i get that they are newer items , so there will inherently be less of them . 
  however it seems like the gamma dopplers came on the scene after gambling got executed and just magically got assigned a suggested price of $ 800-950 out of nowhere . 
  i sent $ 200 to a fully legit online marketplace . 
  transaction does n't exist anywhere ? 
  i 've looked at my address , the receiving address , etc , nothing . 
  however it was taken out of my account and shows 0 confirmations . 
  any suggestions ? 
  i am a btc beginner when it comes to anything but basic usage . 
  hello ,, 
  i sent $ 200 worth of bitcoin yesterday to add funds to my op skins account . 
  i was given a bitcoin address and made the transaction . 
  the transaction got caught up in yesterday 's btc back up and did not even post , let alone confirm for almost 8-10 hours . 
  however the transaction finally went through and the money is out of my account . 
  i contacted op skins support and they told me that bitpay is showing an issued refund , whatever that means . 
  i have not heard from support since . 
  i would really like my money back , either on op skins or back to my wallet . 
  i have been checking the op skins bitcoin wallet address and no transaction has been initiated to my wallet , meaning that no refund has been issued . 
  proof that my transaction went out and money was paid - http://imgur.com/a/mcfdy, 
  how can i escalate this any further ? 
  currently my ticket is open with no response and my money is in limbo somewhere . 
  edit : this issue has been resolved !, 
  major props to the op skins support team . 
  what should this be priced at in keys ? 
  thanks !, 
  value in keys please ? 
  got kicked on the counter terrorists win screen . 
  do i still get the win , or is the match null ? 
  how many wins average does it take to get from dmg to le ? 
  i top frag most of these games with many mvps and still no rank up . 
  the corner is kind of ass , but the heart is clean . 
  what would this go for ?
