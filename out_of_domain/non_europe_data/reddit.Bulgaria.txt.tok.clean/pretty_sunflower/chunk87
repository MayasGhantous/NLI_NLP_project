  i swear i 've seen the same reposts over and over for a solid week on this sub . 
  everyone expects overpay , has max pattern on their skins and is over market . 
  it 's like the nuke on gambling completely crippled trading . 
  great float and corner .

  really looking for any one though .

  there are a tons of videos on youtube of people explaining the spray pattern in detail but i ca n't seem to find a video showing just a plain full 30 round ak spray . 
  i am currently le and working on improving my ak spray and i seem to completely lose my spot after the 10th round . 
  i can execute the m4a4 spray perfectly though so i dunno . 
  i have tried using the recoil workshop map , but since its a dot rather than a line to follow , i find i am always 1-2 rounds behind it on the timing . 
  even though most of steam is back up , the market is still down . 
  the market was the first thing to go down . 
  cs : go was the only game with reported inventory problems and still is the only game with it . 
  this has been confirmed by a number of users on the steam subreddit . 
  for example , i can look at my dota inventory perfect fine , but my cs inventory is missing mostly . 
  some sort of trading update maybe ?

  these are a few example situations that i find myself losing matchups in repeatedly . 
  what is the generally `` correct '' way to play out these situations ? 
  a ) ct side on cache , retaking a. 
  one t on site/quad , others unknown . 
  i have a teammate somewhere and i am at truck . 
  i have a smoke and a flash . 
  do i smoke something ? 
  do i flash ? 
  where do i flash ? 
  assume they do n't know i 'm at truck . 
  i got shat on in esea last night for not using my grenades but i did n't want to give away my positions since i had no indication they knew where i was . 
  b ) taking a on dust 2 . 
  i am long and have just killed the one known long player . 
  i clear pit , now what is my next move , assuming my team is near mid . 
  my natural instinct is to facilitate an a split , i smoke cross , clear car and try to work my way up elevator . 
  c ) t side cobble - how do i clear b ? 
  i usually smoke broken wall , bounce a flash off the floor and just push the guy stairs , if i get him i flame coop or shoot at the guy statue whatever is more pressing . 
  if they smoke it well , it completely stops my push . 
  if i see a smoke incoming , is there a way to flash through to get to the other side of it before the guy can set up stairs ? 
  at that point if he is good , taking plat is a nightmare . 
  d ) i am defending a plant on dust 2 on b. 
  my teamate is car , i am under the window . 
  what the hell do i even do here . 
  peaking door , exposes me to window . 
  i ca n't popflash because i risk flashing my teammate . 
  i ca n't focus solely on window because my teammate could lose door control to tunnels . 
  assume bot teammates . 
  low , almost fn float . 
  any guidance on what this is worth ?
