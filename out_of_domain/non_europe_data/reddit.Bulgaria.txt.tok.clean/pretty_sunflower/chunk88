  used to be b + before break , currently at 0 points b with 10.62 rws . 
  i ca n't seem to rank down . 
  i get matched up with c and d players every game , that i usually have to carry . 
  is my internal elo low so that is why i am getting matched up with them ? 
  if that 's the case , why is the game not ranking me down below b ? 
  i 've lost three in a row at 0 points on b and still not b - . 
  the skill gap in most of my games is ridiculous ...

  currently have the ec1-a , and the sensor is so buttery smooth , i do n't think i can live without it . 
  the scroll wheel got kind of jonky though and rattles . 
  it also makes me jump sometimes when i do n't want to . 
  amazon has some pretty good deals on deathadders today , how does that sensor compare to the zowie sensor ? 
  what about the scroll wheel ? 
  now that the m4a4 buzz kill is out , assuming i get that and an ak fuel injector and a tec-9 fuel injector , what other skins would be necessary to complete a yellow loadout ? 
  what knife would work other than a lore ? 
  i just got a deathadder elite as a replacement for a failing zowie . 
  something is really off with this sensor . 
  even at low dpis it 's super fast and i swear it has acceleration . 
  500hz , 400 dpi , 2.0 cs : go sensitivity , a 90 degree flick gets me a bit further than the 90 degress i expect to turn . 
  all my settings are exactly the same , the raw input is on , etc. 
  i thought i was going crazy so i went back to the store and bought a g403 and a g pro . 
  tried them both at the same settings and i got true to movement flicks , none of the same results . 
  i suppose it could be just placebo from a different shaped mouse but i do n't see the elite as viable for cs with a sensor this sensitive . 
  anyway , looks like i will just order another zowie . 
  with every new update , valve adds items that end up being absurdly expensive and out of reach to the majority of the playerbase . 
  a few cases ago , the high tier items were few and well known - lore , howl , ruby , etc. 
  look at the gamma case - gamma dopplers ? 
  absurdly expensive , even for shit phases . 
  fn and mw are very expensive . 
  lore ? 
  do n't even think about it . 
  bright water and black lam are the only ones even reachable , but that 's still at a 200-300 price range . 
  gloves will end up being the same way . 
  unless you are a remnant of the gambling age who got lucky , a website mod , or a power trader , the chances are you are never going to see any of those items . 
  i dunno , i am all for cosmetics in games , but adding new cases of items that end up being $ 700 + each and only seen by like 1 % of the community seems pointless . 
  it encourages practices like gambling and scamming . 
  i 've been trying out other mice since my ec1-a is getting old and the scroll wheel is getting kind of jonky , and i ca n't hit a damn thing . 
  i have tried the deathadder elite , g pro , g403 and corsair harpoon and the new 3360 sensor in all of these is way too snappy and sensitive even at low dpis . 
  it 's not conducive to any sort of precise aim . 
  for reference , i am lem , esea b + with relatively large hands ( 20-21 ) . 
  with over half of pro cs players using some version of the zowie mouse , will anything ever surpass them ? 
  it seems like 3310 is the pinnacle of cs mice . 
  i doubt zowie would upgrade to a 3360 sensor with their 3310 series being so successful . 
  side thoughts - what 's the point of your mouse being capable of 16,000 dpi ? 
  make it the best at 400/800 , then throw big numbers out .

  just realized i have a white logo ec1-a , which means it was produced before the benq merger . 
  are the red logo mice mechanically any different than the white logos ?

  i just got into this whole thing as a lifetime dipper . 
  all i have right now is camel frost until i can get some general or swedish stuff . 
  i use it in my upper lip and it 's causing me to salivate . 
  it 's leaking juice down that i then swallow . 
  it 's all fine and good since you can swallow snus , but i thought that using it in the upper lip is supposed to not make you salivate . 
  am i doing something wrong ? 
  i ca n't find this anywhere anymore , but mint and wintergreen are now abundant . 
  is it still around ? 
  hit me up , maybe we can work something out . 
  more interested in a falchion than a bfk .

  asking for a friend . 
  i feel like it would be incredibly helpful for improving to know where the fuck my bullets went , especially during a spray . 
  this could be completely a placebo , but i feel like i have seen improvement by changing my crosshair on a weekly , sometimes daily basis . 
  i feel like i rely on the crosshair way less and get better at `` feeling '' the headshot and spray . 
  any meat to this ? 
  the tv has a built in wifi that i have connected to my network . 
  i have toons in ng + with a standard even str/dex build and a full sorc arcane build . 
  i want to start fresh and was thinking of doing a full dex build or perhaps a faith/str `` holy knight '' build but i 'm looking for advice on what i will get a different play style out of .
