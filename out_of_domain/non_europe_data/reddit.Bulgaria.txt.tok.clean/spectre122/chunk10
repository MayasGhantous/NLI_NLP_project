  it 's not like he would have needed to exert himself or put much thought into it . 
  and griffith trying to recruit rickert into his little band speaks volumes about him . 
  it 's not like he needs rickert , it 's more like he wants rickert to be with him . 
  he was visibly hurt in his encounter with rickert and if he truly wanted to kill rickert , if he truly did send raksas to go kill him , he could have easily done something when he saw rickert escaping . 
  we could n't see his facial expression , but letting rickert escape after all that he did and with griffith knowing where rickert is headed , it 's pretty obvious that griffith did n't order raksas to kill rickert . 
  and from this we can gather that he still has some emotion for his old companions , whatever that emotion may well be . 
  does he find them interesting , does he still have genuine feelings for them or is he just trying to ignite some emotion of his past life into himself ... who knows ? 
  but something is definitely there . 
  what i hate most about berserk 's fanbase is the bandwagon that follows `` griffith fucking sucks , he is evilz '' . 
  for christ sake , this story is way more complicated than that . 
  it is n't just some black and white story where the good guy is a saint while the bad guy is literally the devil . 
  guts is n't some good guy , not at all . 
  he has a very tragic backstory , but that does n't excuse his actions before he met griffith and after he met griffith , and after the eclipse . 
  now it 's true that he is improving at that aspect and tries to be a better guy ever since he met puck , but does that excuse all the shit that he did ? 
  yes , griffith , much like guts , was n't a good guy , but he certainly was n't evil before he became femto ( and how evil he is now we ca n't possibly know ) . 
  he was just an ambitious man that had his dream of owning a kingdom . 
  he did n't go out to hurt people , even sacrificing himself for his comrades when the need arised . 
  he felt for his soldiers ( and during the time period that berserk is set in that was extremely rare . ), 
  and he was mostly cool with anyone unless they tried to fuck with him . 
  as for the break up between guts and griffith it 's simple to put the blame on griffith , but guts was the one who was being an asshole about the whole thing . 
  you ca n't just pack your things and leave your friends that you 've known for years and been through so much without giving any sort of explanation . 
  hell , even your girlfriend . 
  if guts sat down and explained to griffith the purpose of his departure from the both , griffith would have either explained to him what he meant by his whole `` friendship '' thing and cooled things or he would have allowed him to leave and come back when he is ready . 
  griffith sure made the mistake of sleeping with charlotte but none of that would have happened if guts acted like a rational adult and not like a baby . 
  the eclipse was a result of many different things each adding to the decision that griffith took . 
  it was n't because griffith was evil , it was n't because he did n't care for the people he sacrificed , he was literally broken and at the lowest point of his life . 
  i do n't even need to go into detail as to what was done to him . 
  add to that the subtle manipulation of the god hand and ** any ** person , and i truly mean ** any ** could have done what he did . 
  you may say you would n't , but it 's pretty easy to say that when you 're in your comfy chair typing on your keyboard . 
  why are you guys looking at this story from such a narrow and simpleminded way ? 
  guts and griffith are two of the most complex characters you 'll ever see in any form of media and you 're just looking at them from a black and white perspective . 
  this is n't naruto . 
  it 's kinda selling miura short considering the absolutely wonderful manga that he has created . 
  it just depends on how it 's done and how logical it would be . 
  as i already said , do i need to begin explaining in detail as to what was done to griffith ? 
  i do n't think i do . 
  try finding yourself in the same situation and be offered godly powers and see how rational you would act . 
  that 's why i specifically said that it 's real easy to judge while you 're sitting comfortably in your chair . 
  that 's why the behelit activated when he did - because he was at the lowest point of his life . 
  he would have never done the thing that he did if it was otherwise . 
  hell , before the behelit acted , he was n't able to even kill himself , that 's how fucked he had become . 
  after enduring all that torture , being unable to walk , talk , use his hands , forced to eat through a straw and forced to have someone to take care of him and all that humiliation that entails , you ca n't symphatize ? 
  you would n't even think for a second if given the choice ? 
  man , you 're either a saint on the level of jesus christ or you 're lying to yourself . 
  he overreacted because guts left without giving any reason as to why . 
  hell , he would have left without even telling griffith about it . 
  does that seem like a friendly thing to do ? 
  not only was he leaving griffith , but his girlfriend and his other fellows that he has been through so much . 
  even corkus was visibly hurt by guts ' actions even though he tried to hide it . 
  do n't get me wrong , i love guts , but he ai n't no saint . 
  far from it . 
  and he has been an asshole for most of his natural life only recently trying to correct his ways . 
  you forgot about the biggest fuck up of them all - stannis ' character assassination . 
  physically - no . 
  mentally - yes . 
  guts did pretty horrible things himself , let 's be honest here . 
  yeah , i would n't imagine it would have gotten the same score if the title was `` dear black people '' . 
  and anyone who reads my post , no matter if he disagrees , downvotes me or whatever , knows deep down what i 'm saying is true . 
  i do n't care what the show addresses it or not , i 'm only talking if the titles were reversed . 
  calling me racist ? 
  well , that 's a first . 
  you do know that when you use that word so many times it becomes quite meaningless ? 
  so real racism may in fact become a normal thing because of people like you . 
  i 'm specifically talking about the `` reviewers '' and the reviews it 's getting . 
  stop changing the subject , i never said that the show was racist ( i have n't watched it , and quite frankly , i do n't ever plan on going to ) , but that title is definitely racist in itself, 
  so that 's why i asked you to imagine what would have happened if the title had `` black '' instead of `` white '' . 
  oh , i 'm kind of flattered you went through my post history . 
  in all honesty i did n't even know that richard spencer said that , but even if he did , it still holds ground . 
  it 's still true and it does n't make it any less relevant . 
  we 're diving into an entirely different subject , however i still stand by my words - not all men are created equal and i 've explained why . 
  does that make me racist or misogynist ? 
  no , i do n't believe it does . 
  it 's not like i want it to be this way , it 's just is . 
  i have absoluly no problem with black people , asians , hispanics . 
  i have no problem with women . 
  what i do have a problem with is these certain ideologies that want to portray white people as the root of all evil in the world and feminism as `` women should be more equal than men ) . 
  how does all of that makes me racist ? 
  i have absolutely no hate towards any race . 
  duh , is n't it ? 
  was n't the marketing itself racist ? 
  have you seen that mtv commercial ? 
  or how it was marketed besides that ? 
  even the writer of the show himself said `` fuck white people '' . 
  even if i never watched the show it does seem pretty racist to me . 
  i do n't know , maybe we live in a world were racism towards white people is called `` banter '' while things going the other way around are called by their real name . 
  actually , the wars between the ghiscari and the valyrians would be interesting . 
  they are based on the punic wars after all . 
  it 's better for that mystery to remain unresolved and only give us tiny bits about it . 
  what would be interesting is te valyrian-ghiscari wars . 
  that was some crazy shit . 
  and that cliffhanger as well . 
  thank god . 
  it 's damn good tv series . 
  so ... just because you conquered someone that means you can claim to be that someone ? 
  essentially charlemagne , the ostrogothic kingdom , the lombards , hell even the germans themselves can all claim to be romans ? 
  the city of rome itself e and much of former territory roman territory were part of those nations as well . 
  we can continue with this - maybe the arabs could claim they are the heirs of egypt , or the achaemenid empire ? 
  we can do this all night long . 
  what a stupid logic . 
  neither russia , nor the ottoman empire had any claim on rome,
