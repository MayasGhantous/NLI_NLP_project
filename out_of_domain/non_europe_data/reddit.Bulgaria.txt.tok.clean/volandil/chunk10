  he was using the force . 
  he had facts , he had evidence of the force .

  me , but i 'm from the former communist countries . 
  any form of religion is direct competitor to the one true party and the leaders of the working people . 
  the bad side of the communist fall , is that religion has been having quite a renaissance for awhile now , just because it used to be forbidden , it 's now uber cool . 
   it 's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense .

  til ` kitsch ' is an actual word which is known to the world , not some secret stuff we eastern europeans invented . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kitsch ) - it 's the same meaning , i 'm just surprised such word exists really , never really given it much thought till now . 
  just spent something like 30 minutes playing with that , came to post it , that post showed up on the search . 
  have an upvote , it 's beautiful , 
  it 's a 3d render , i 've seen the grid picture somewhere , or it was half/overlayed , looking for the source now .

  dog bollocks = good, 
  just bollocks = bad, 
  sir bobby too , calm as ever , focused on the game as always . 
  if there have been a more clear sign those two ( bebe and obertan ) have no place near the first team ... 
  you 'll be surprised how many devoted united fans have no idea . 
  [ bollocks ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227984/quotes?qt0406684 ), 
  so basically , wigan got it right this time . 
  thank you .

  how exactly was smalling shit ? 
  smalling + o'shea is also some sort of an option , but yeah , brown seems like the most logical choice . 
  interesting , nobody mentions lukyanenko and his [ labyrinth of relfections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/labyrinth_of_reflections ) is great .

  thanks !, 
  pretty epic , yes . 
  it 's okay , it was a shitty joke anyway . 
  nope . 
  took me awhile to figure out what 's ` dat ass ' the title is about . 
  she is a dumb bitch , but there is a reason you are not supposed to post private information . 
  just no . 
  does n't make it right . 
  ffs stop posting the names of those delusional idiots !!, 
  you are on the same level as them !,

  why did n't you read the quran , instead of the bible ? ', 
  brilliant , 
  excellent . 
  now just change the title to adam 2.0 , 
  but seriously , awesome tat and execution . 
  i meant that he has played in every position on the pitch already . 
  one of my favourite moments is when he was a makeshift keeper vs. tottenham . 
  robbie keane was really pissed :d, 
  jaw = dropped, 
  i agree . 
  many fans do n't understand the internal tasks everyone is assigned . 
  last season , rooney was the scoarer , berbatov the creator . 
  the stats show that pretty clearly . 
  this season , those roles are reversed and quiet obvious . 
  carrick has been transformed in a dm the last two years , but people are judging him and will continue to judge him on the base that he is not shooting or . . ` passing forward ' . 
  our biggest problem in the middle of the park is that anderson is missing right now , they have formed a great partnership with carrick . 
  fletch is another player which is currently undergoing transformation , in a much more attacking position . 
  but yeah , that 's also just like , my opinion man . 
  with all the games he missed , and the poor games he had he is our third most creative player with 6 assists , rooney , nani ahead of him . 
  i think we 're seeing a switch in the places of him and carrick . 
  but it might be just me . 
  umm . . this guy uses a bow and arrow . 
  hi-tech , true . 
  but still bow and arrow .
