  there is an awesome 4cd set called ` fuck the mainstream ' which is pretty much the essence of my sci-fi music . 
  it did actually , it just takes a bit of effort and 5-6 minutes of your time . 
  yeah i did it , i made sure to tell the guys at the cable company that i 'm paying for the hbo channels just because of got . 
  and i 'm even waiting a day extra to watch the episodes on it ( in bulgarian hbo , they air on monday for some weird reason ), 
  [ http://sharerimg.com/p/85840.html] ( http://sharerimg.com/p/85840.html ) i guess it 's this one , did n't have a source back then , but it yeah , looks the same author, 
  hear , hear !, 
  one person liked my joke !, 
  i have no logical explanation to why you are being downvoted . 
  i think it can be voted back , but yeah , that 's the main idea of the site, 
  * cough * baptists * cough * ? 
  i was really just making a joke , but thanks , every day you learn something new , 
  to get to the other side , duh . 
  we let go devlin ? 
  why would we do that , he had a fine season ffs ? 
  the targeryians connection to the dragons is deeper than just a sigil , symbol of the house . 
  the first targeryians landed in westeros and conquered it using real dragons . 
  the dragon skulls in the basement of king 's landing are from real dragons . 
  dragons are extinct at the timeline which the books/movie happens , but they were real not too long ago . 
  only the targeryians had command over them . 
  i think that is one of the greatest and under appreciated feats of the series . 
  the portrayal of the sick mind is just amazing . 
  she hears what she wants to hear , she hears ` the seed is strong ' , in a way to justify her own desires . 
  it 's amazingly common and overlooked . 
  a youtube video . 
  just because shaga sounds like shaggy . 
  * they call me mister boombastic , two axe fanastic *, 
  awesome . 
  artist name , location thou, 
  a chain fapsession has started . 
  i 'm a bulgarian , living in sofia , bulgaria and i approve of the painting and this comment . 
  `` in one foot at a time ! '', 
  it is known . 
  edit :[ http://www.blastwave-comic.com/] ( http://www.blastwave-comic.com/ ) the author is this one . 
  my bad getting it wrong the first time . 
  yeah i thought the same on first glance , a little of tineye + google corrected me , 
  really , do n't be an ass , link to the [ author ] ( http://apofiss.deviantart.com/ ), 
  and i 'm a bit angry that you get more karma then my post of this same picture with source couple of months earlier , 
  i think you accidently the graphics, 
  we call it ` the cathedratank '  also - repost, 
  it really does n't . 
  but it 's a good goal . 
  it means nothing really , sounds a bit like ` number ninth ' ` ninth in order ' or something like that , but the exact word ' \u0414\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430 ' means nothing . 
  if it is one of the many churches - they 'll laugh it off i guess , unless they belong to this exact one . 
  in a case where most/all of them do it , it should be interesting , probably gon na accept it , after a very troubling period of doubt . 
  aaand doubt is good . 
   flesh drives, 
  uga buga , name catchy . 
  i 've always wondered , how would a collaboration between him and g.r.r. 
  martin work out ? 
  it 's gon na be a killer for sure . 
  should n't the same test , done multiple times give enough contradicting results ? 
  i mean , if you choose the straight path , they 'll reinforce their believes , probably . 
  just ask them to do the same test , couple more times . 
  ` not the armpits ' and ` winter is coming ' haha , oh it 's a reference , definitely !, 
  only because it has always been something done behind closed doors , in the dark , and never talked about . 
  seriously , if there was ever any doubt on the guilt merchandise , this right here is a perfect example how most of the church prey on it . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgxkk5ohl21qb5wjko1_500.jpg ), 
  i thought it was a motherfucking crane on wheels . 
  window washers , yeah . 
  you might like the fact that he is a redditor and did an ama recently : [ bo burnham ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/fbptr/i_am_a_20_yearold_comedian_and_redditor_my_name/ ), 
  no problems with the 7 day no fap challenge i guess ? 
  kalemegdan i think ? 
  amazing place , really . 
  two more from the same place : [ silhouettes ] ( http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/084/e/1/silhouettes_of_beograd_by_azrfl666.jpg ) and [ dat statue ] ( http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/084/6/0/silent_watcher_by_azrfl666.jpg ), 
  yup looks like kalemegdan , just posted two of mine shots from there in a different comment . 
  animated jpg is weird . . 
  i do love the shot , do n't get me wrong . 
  i have some shots from different angles , but this is my favourite , the statute , overseeing the city and looking at that huge building . 
  looks more suitable for / r/earthporn , just sayin, 
  bad to the bone ( r ) . 
  needs more ghosts !, 
  [ ] ( / whoa `` hey everybody , it 's a girl '' ), 
  ( just saying ), 
  was n't she , or another of the sg a redditor ? 
  ninja/samurai edit :, 
  it is indeed [ her ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/hattiewatson ), 
  and her [ ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hipstergurlz/comments/g3glr/i_am_hattie_watson_ama/ ), 
  nature is fine !, 
  nah , looks like shes working solo , just the looks and the vague memory of a hot redditor with tons of sg like tattoos got me thinking , 
  not sure if i have the right to ask , but i 'm kinda curious if i read this semi-correct . 
  ca n't really make a good guess for delta h and s delta t, 
  but from what i get your music started in 89 and continues to infinity , your equation , which kinda creates your music is :, 
  ( first two ) + cannabis , with or without love ( difference in love ? 
  ) , with or without target ( goal in life ? ), 
  i think i 've been doing it wrong . 
  shit i have to start a new world again . 
  not sure if serious , or just kidding, 
  i upvoted you , not because you are right , but because those are common questions which i 've seen asked around milions of times . 
  the answers alanna provided are good and needs more people to see them . 
  those two are two specific cases or scenarios which have nothing to do with the general gm food safety . 
  i 'm jelly . 
  i 'm gon na take a wild guess and call ` ghostbusters ' ? 
  probably has been posted before , but it was new to me , so here is the speech in question :, 
  [ taoiseach enda kenny criticises the vatican ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo5mxrqbdea ), 
   he released the * krapen *, 
  ftfy, 
  manifesting the madm ( a | e ) n ? 
  yeah , ` killing the children ' did n't have the same ring to it ... 
  artist , location ? 
  try not being a fucking idiot .
