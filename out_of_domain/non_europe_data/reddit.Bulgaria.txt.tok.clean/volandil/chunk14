  i like this one . . but i dislike that the posting seems pretty automated . 
  tsk tsk tsk . 
  so that reddit gold some time ago was n't wasted at all  ) ), 
  animals , i.e. 
  chickens do n't have souls , so it 's basically ok to do whatever . 
  u n i, 
  t e d, 
  check ? 
  edit : check !, 
  that 's a pretty light sentence , compared to eternity . 
  yeah that was a really huge turn off for me . 
  and the fact that i maybe had way too big expectations of the series . 
  i expected something at least at par with tears of the dragon . 
  anyway , i was generally disappointed , the inclusion of himself was the tip of the iceberg . 
  i love this !, 
  yup , i was there on the stadium when they recorded it , a fucking hail storm during the megadeth part . 
  dave could n't event pretend to be bothered about being on stage . 
  huge disappointment . 
  is that what you call it now ? 
  you people ... 
  wheres the crescent moon then ? 
  at first i was : ` wtf is ortho-molecular doctor ? 
  ' , but then i googled :, 
  `` the term `` orthomolecular '' was coined by linus pauling to mean `` the right molecules in the right amounts '' ( ortho is greek for `` right '' ) ; thus orthomolecular medicine focuses on using the right nutritional molecules in the right amounts for the individual . 
  proponents state that treatments are based on patients ' individual biochemistries . '', 
  so , someone with some sort of phd in balooney states the balooney in question works wonders . 
  right . 
  ha , it 's the guy with the scandinavian comics , oh i love this !, 
  funny thing is , later in competitive starcraft/broodwar , they called the base structure - ` sim city ' and some players were famous for making amazing ` sim cities ' which they used for their advantage . 
  * 26/female/denmark * - yes , ` the lady ' is what i really meant . 
  thanks , 
  besides , boaron is n't really small pharma , it 's pretty big shit . 
  in the bible , nobody knows you 're a dog . 
  upvote should be arnie 's thumbs up hand from terminator 2 , 
  sounded like him , which book is it from ? 
  ** one/zero **, 
  ** red pill/blue pill **,

  * sigh *, 
  it 's only insightful if you manage to decipher paddy 's talking, 
  pires on the pitch . 
  old trafford needs more booooo, 
  needs to be 18 + - it 's just pure sex, 
  oh come on , they were n't really there . 
  with all disrespect to citeh , yeah , know your fucking place . 
  wigan using him on left wing and england using him on right wing is something i 'll never really understand . 
  saves the ' y u no audio ' questions we get with the gifs you know . 
  because me copy pasta :-|, 
  our ` left wing ' position is kinda weird . 
  it 's a left wing , but you move in the center when the team is attacking , making space for the full back to bomb forward . 
  in the 97th minute . 
  wtf ? 
  obvious troll is pretty obvious . 
  definately bulgaria . 
  cheap booze too . 
  the author will definitely be dan brown . 
  they torched greggs man , they torched greggs . 
  wow , they 're young . 
  use the ` save ' button luke , use the ` save ' button . 
  the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  aside of the team you support ? 
  yes , absolutely . 
  i 'm also a bit concerned that pogba has n't even been out on loan yet , but if saf and the coaches who see him play and train almost every day think he is ready , we 'll just have to wait and see . 
  edit :, 
  a bit silly that you 're being downvoted for this question , it is very relevant . 
  i thought it was luiz, 
  obertan is gon na be a very good signing for newcastle . 
  you misspelled ` cunt ' . 
  but yeah , technically he is not bad at all . 
  i still think he should 've been cast instead of brad pitt for the movie . 
  so yeah , when you have time , count me in too , 
  cheers !, 
  i love him . 
  love ^ love ^ love ^ love ^ 08, 
  so , did it help ? 
  [ relevant butter safe comic ] ( http://buttersafe.com/2011/07/07/a-nice-day/ ), 
  so you did . . so they did . 
  as i do . 
  yes . 
  blocks - shat . 
  then who was creeper ?!, 
  there is a great animated gif of nathan fillion basically doing the same . 
  [ right here ] ( http://awesomegifs.com/wp-content/uploads/nathan-fillion-well-nevermind.gif ), 
  srsly , flashblock . 
  then just scroll down to the actual flashblocked movie . 
  i heard it in the bus . 
  the berbatov flick vs. west ham was better _ and _ intentional, 
  but ... but ... that only took 2 passes to happen . 
  arsenal does n't play like that anymore . 
  i 'm happy for stoke . 
  their supporters can be complete cunts most of the time , but i still like the stoke team and the way they made britannia stadium a fucking fortress . 
  you did well young rykell . 
  from now on , you shall be known as ... rykell . 
  the crowd noise is incredible and makes it so much more real . 
  the setup was really a piece of genius , and ronaldo 's hunger for the goal , the run he made was amazing also . 
  anyway , love it , 
  i feel sorry you 've been downvoted , you speak the truth . 
  i saw the article reposted and reprinted in way too many ` organic ' ` one with nature ' ` tree hugger ' type of blogs along the mainstream media .
