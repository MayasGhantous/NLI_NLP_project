  which songs did you join in and well , everything !,

  also there is a hidden mouse-over panel, 
  ka-ching !, 
  seems every other big english club was trying to get him . 
  brazillian with belgian passport , which makes him eligible to play in uk , obviously a talent . 
  the kid explained on twitter himself that he plays attacking midfield . 
  the belgian passport makes him a citizen of the european union , hence different rules for signing him . 
  english clubs can not to my knowledge sign someone this young , whos not from eu . 
  i recall such issues with several fm legends like kerlon and etc. 
  edit : now when i think about it , it 's different in some countries , that 's why we were loaning out players like dong to antwerp , until they can play for united . 
  you are right , the working visa is the main problem , but there are some other issues with players that young ( he is 15 ) and from outside eu . 
  cheers , 
  if god himself came down and told her , it 's no big surprise she would and you will get many similar answers . 
  i would continue asking after this :, 
  what if a preacher who talks directly to god tells you to ? 
  what if a prophet who talks directly to god tells you to ? 
  what if the neighborhood priest tells you to ? 
  and so on ... and so on ... 
  yup , also a very good question , 
  and why is that ? 
  because they refused to loan out a gk to a rival ? 
  because a person that gets something in the range of 30-40k in # is complaining ? 
  when an offer matching the club expectations comes , he will be sold , simple as that . 
  amazing , if you need a hand with anything related to the setup , maintenance or whatever just give us a hint . 
  i know me and many others will be glad to help free of charge , just for the chance to participate actively in this . 
  the compensation package would render further jobs pointless . 
  [ tomasz kuszczak statement ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2011/nov/tomasz-kuszczak-issues-statement.aspx ), 
  my head is a door , your argument is invalid . 
  nope, 
  it 's not funny , some people are born with lack of oxygen !, 
  not just yet , but you lot seem to be working hard in that direction . 
  * assuming you 're from the us *, 
  you got ** single ** right . 
  you have less in your first night ? 
  huh huh . 
  i think you accidentally the [ link ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2011/nov/tomasz-kuszczak-issues-statement.aspx ), 
   implying that you 've been upvoted, 
  wait , what ? 
   in 2006 , united beat chelsea in moscow to win their second champions league trophy under ferguson ,, 
  should be 2008 . 
  good read thou , 
  drank some period , what about you ? 
  i upvoted this shit so hard , it dropped a golden apple, 
  \\ m / -_- \\ m /, 
  saha , hargreaves, 
   ** v ** odka, 
  ftfy, 
  yeah , put up or shut up !, 
  thanks for sharing and all that , but ze russians consume more vodka so their spelling wins !, 
  i do n't recall seeing any ` failed ' auditions thou, 
  hmm . . did that get caught in the spam filter ? 
  it 's a sad news for him really , but is n't this a bit of an overreaction ? 
  we still have :, 
  carrick, 
  fletcher, 
  park, 
  gibson, 
  with the following able to fill in and do the job if needed :, 
  rooney , jones , valencia, 
  and with the following of the youth/reserves team able to do the job , again , if needed :, 
  so , yeah , it really sucks for him , but come on !, 
   but as utd always does , will find a way to win . 
  i completely agree with this , just your wording seemed a bit over dramatic , that 's all . 
  i too love watching him play , the kid is amazing and doing the right things the right way . 
  however , the veterans which are so easily dismissed will sooner or later get back in form and will carry us once again forward . 
  a bit offtopic , but i like gibson , i 'm genuinely happy that he recovered from the injury and still have some hopes he will feature . 
  if saf and the coaches decide to sell him in january , fine , i 'll be a bit sad to see him leave , just like i was sad seeing wes and o'shea leave . 
  anyway , end of rant , have a good weekend , 
  cheers , 
  united 's left winger has been spending most of his time cutting inside , creating space for evra to bomb down the flank . 
  we have been playing like this for the last 3 or 4 years already , that 's why we employ lots of central midfielders in that position and that 's why nani looks less effective on the left wing . 
  that 's a joke , right ? 
  would n't you need some professional it services ? 
  i would bring bacon every day , just hire me , 
  yeah , i 'm going to have to incorporate ` vowel challenged ' in my vocabulary from now on , if that 's ok with you , okay ? 
  hmm . . 
  oh , come on !, 
  could 've been spiders !, 
  nop ... 
  wait , well , yes . 
  you now have a pink tag ` cute spiders ' . 
  use your power for great justice . 
  yes .

  i am actually serious !, 
  i would love to work somewhere in or around mediacityuk , as it 's very close to where i can stay in manchester . 
  delete it !, 
  yup , did n't have something i can apply for when last checked , but you gave me a good idea to subscribe for alerts there . 
  well , if you hear anything , you know where you can pm me , 
  the winter pic will be scary, 
  no , not really . 
  we have a young squad , which will eventually make mistakes , no big deal , they are learning this way and they 're becoming better with every game . 
  in yesterday 's game we played some of our best football in the last 2 months , yes , we got some silly goals , but they were mostly our own fault , mistakes which will be learned upon . 
  [ lilcho arsov ladies and gents ] ( http://images.ibox.bg/2006/05/23/arsov/460x352.jpg ), 
  have no fear , darron gibson is here . 
  he really is n't . 
  not yet . 
  he will need more time in the reserves , to get used to playing against opponents who are heavier , stronger then him . 
  yes he bossed the midfield at academy level , because he could just shrug off anyone , but not so much with the big boys .
