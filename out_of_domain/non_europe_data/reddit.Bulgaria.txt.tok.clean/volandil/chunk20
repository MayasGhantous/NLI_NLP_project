  found other guys that were there to see united . 
  found guys wearing the colours , wearing scarves , chanting . 
  noone asks ` what is your bulgarian team ' . 
  feels good man , i have none of those . 
  heh . . found out i 've got the melodies wrong on half the chants , shame . 
  exact years and exact games are a little messed up in my mind , i have a very clear memory of the 2007 coventry fiasco , most of the people leaving the pub way earlier , complaining . 
  still ca n't figure out wtf was going through their heads . 
  me and 4 or 5 more people remain there on different tables , looking at each other and starting ` we 'll never die , we 'll never die ' to the amusement of some of the foreigners in the pub . 
  a guy comes by , says he is from leeds , hates us to his guts but admires that there are people that stayed and watched till the end . 
  another guy comes and joins , says he is from mcr , been season ticket holder and was at nou camp , in barcelona in 99 . 
  shakes my hand , gives me a little lecture where and what is sang the wrong way . 
  we get together with the few others in the pub and hey , a year later we have an unofficial fanclub in 5 cities of bulgaria . 
  i think for the 2008 cl final we managed to squeeze something like 300 people in that little poor pub . 
  2011 was a great year , went to old trafford 3 times , managed to grab a cl away game ( bucharest , romania ) . 
  fingers crossed i get lucky at the ajax away ballot . 
  so there it is , in a nutshell . 
  tl ; dr - did n't care about football , got involved , gradually became fan , trying as hard as i can to be a supporter . 
  surely you can simply _ not _ visit this subreddit and the football related ones , eh ? 
  really impressed with daehli , januzaj and of course with barmby . 
  and blackett ? 
  he looks on his way to become bigger even then samba !, 
  goal.com is n't really a good source . 
  i ca n't recall the last time they printed an actual news , or a rumour that would happen to be true . 
  \u0411\u0425\u041a \u0441\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043b\u0438 [ \u0441 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e \u0434\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 ] ( http://www.bghelsinki.org/bg/novini/press/single/otvoreno-pismo-do-redakciyata-na-7-dni-sport/ ), 
  is that the andy mitten column that gets all those rumours ? 
  i thought he meant beckham , but becks resigned with la. 
  here is the actual link : [ link ] ( http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport-news/man-utd-fc/2012/01/17/ex-man-united-star-considers-paul-scholes-esque-return-55578-30144784/ ), 
  they 're in the fifth now, 
  he is injured thou , is n't he ? 
  carrick and jones maybe ? 
  i expect us to approach it as we did with citeh away , 4-1-4-1 with rooney dropping very deep and carrick sweeping behind , soaking pressure , looking for swift counter attacks . 
  clev is good two weeks away from playing mate, 
  it 's from 2006 , but it does look like a wig a bit . 
  [ press the button , well deserved . 
  ` dat zola backheel goal ' . . yeah , i had lots of sympathy for that team , reporting in . 
  well . . played i would say . 
  i have really no idea . 
  brain-fart probably, 
  i think that 's how it started , but it 's a third level comment and wont move up the whole thread it was attached to , 
  so yeah , brainfart , 
  well , duh . 
  soon, 
  were you there ? 
  can you compare the noise level that was on tv with the noise level on the stadium ? 
  it 's an honest question !, 
  i 've been suspecting sky and other channels to be silencing the mics in the united sections and specially the ones aimed at stretford end for awhile now . 
  i 've been at old trafford just a few times , but every time i watched the full match with commentary later it struck me how quiet the stadium seemed , and believe me , it was n't that bad when i was there . 
  any match going fans here that can confirm or dismiss this suspicion of mine ? 
  technically , he is right , `` derby '' is :, 
  `` a derby ( pronounced darby ) is a game between two teams from the same area . '', 
  while it 's been widely used lately for two teams that have intense rivalry between them , the original meaning is for local teams . 
  that 's deep man , far out maan . . 
  ahh . . the to-be-wonder-kid bojinov who decided learning from del piero was n't good enough for him . 
  u dun dig it bro , tis gangsta tok , k, 
  did that get caught in the spam filter ? 
  tbf , you 're forgetting that the build up of the rvp 's goal started from rafael bursting in the penalty box , completely unmarked by ox . 
  it was only koscielny 's last ditch tackle that saved the day and created the counter attack that led to the goal . 
  who assisted and picked up the ball on the other end of the pitch - ox , who did n't bother tracking back after the bursting forward rafael at all . 
  john o'shea or quinton fortune, 
  even better , clone each of them 11 times , make a team of o'sheas fight with a team of fortunes . 
  honestly ? 
  yes , for awhile . 
  when the time comes to change generations , he will fail . 
  i 'm starting to hate the ` what the papers say ' section of the website with passion . 
  they republish any idiotic rumor out there and give them credibility , it 's beyond moronic . 
  i would expect the fucking official site to publish fucking official information . 
  it 's the [ helivets !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbp3oss195q ), 
  well , it 's just my opinion :-), 
  on a side note , daniel taylor from ` the guardian ' has complained on twitter :, 
  `` six nationals and two agencies now banned from #mufc press confs , all for different reasons . 
  only four dailies standing . '', 
  pogba was taken off because he would be used as backup , ca n't see him starting at anfield . 
  or starting the reserves game at all if he was gon na play full game on saturday . 
  i 'm nervous : - x, 
  but . . but . . it was funny !, 
  is she related to inspector catani ? 
  aka michele placido ? 
  woah , beautiful . 
  bravo corado , bravo !, 
  seems to be a common problem for the big clubs nowadays . 
  not bad for a basketball game , eh ? 
  come to think about it , the most popular video of ` horto magiko ' is from a basketball game too . 
  thanks !, 
  took inspiration from here : http://www.redcafe.net/f7/classic-photos-166011/, 
  i 'm glad it turned out well . 
  check the redcafe thread i posted in the upper comment, 
  traveling there soon and taking tips from this thread as well , thanks !, 
  thanks , taking a note for the tyler 's museum , looks good . 
  nemo is something like 600-700 meters from the hotel , so will probably visit it anyway when we have time , but will definitely lower my expectations , 
  been in the manchester science and industry museum and the london museum of natural history - they do set the bar quite high i must agree . 
  great , thanks , 
  are n't the canals frozen ? 
  very nice , 
  i laughed . 
  quite loud actually . 
  right , red light district it will be then !, 
  cheers !, 
  i guess there is an easy metro/train link to the stadium ? 
  i 'm pretty sure they rooney goal has been done already , but i was thinking about it too , will just have to dig out a good quality hi-res pic and give a try .
