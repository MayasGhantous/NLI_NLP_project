  so dawkins wrote a letter to emma watson ?

  i 'm confuse . 
  i did , back when i was 10 . 
  it really depends on how you 've got used to spend your time . 
  woah . 
  umm . . 
  i do n't agree with you . 
  knowing about placebo effects and them functioning on you are two different things . 
  placebo does n't work on your ` rational ' parts of the brain , the ones you use consciously , it pretty much activates/unlocks automated responses . 
  i 's working on the systems which you ca n't control on purpose . 
  of course , it has it 's limitations , it will work on the little things like headache , common cold and etc. 
  but it will still work , regardless if you repeat ` it 's a placebo ' like a mantra , over and over again . 
  been there :-), 
  objects in the rear view mirror ... are losing . 
  ( edit : stupid typo ), 
  of all the things i 've lost , i miss my mind the most . 
  wesley snipes .

  woah . 
  woah . 
  woah .

  i want to believe, 
  woah . 
  you must be new around here .

  big pun :d, 
  hear hear , the man knows stories from them distant pasts, 
  make sure you hear [ white and nerdy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9qyf9dzpdw ), 
  it 's about potency , geddit ? 
  the herbal stuff which you probably are referencing is not homeopathy . 
  you do n't geddit !, 
  so , basically , they 're fucked ? 
  ( i 'm tempted to test how much more attention this post will get by writing down ` their ' instead * ashamed * ), 
  i ca n't really figure out if it 's legit or not , but i 'm pretty sure nano-diamonds have been in the root of the last 5 scams/frauds for miracle cancer cure . 
  so i 'm a bit skeptical to this , the only thing saving it from labeling it ` wtf ' is the fact that it 's on discovery.news, 
  if you think about it , ozzy osbourne has been resisting death for awhile now . 
  some other musicians should also have their genes sequenced, 
  100 % of the people born between 1901 and 1905 have eaten cucumbers and most of them are dead now !, 
  the alive are exactly number as the statistical error margin suggests . 
  do you want to believe ? 
  but . . 
  i have yet to see a crying gypsy . 
  bastards .

  it must be a troll !, 
  tell me it 's a troll !, 
  everytime someone reposts that picture , i upvote . 
  yup . . you do n't go out very often , do you ? 
  it 's a phone . 
  i 'll just put them on hold and continue browsing reddit .

  you 're chinegro , which is a bit better than blactino , and scores a bit lower compared to hispasian . 
  i try . . but i do n't get it really . 
  of course it 's good not to rush into making babies , but why stressing out ` no kids ' like gazillion times ?
