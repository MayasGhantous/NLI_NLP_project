  be warned that ` deary me ' is copyrighted by paddy crerand and you owe him a huge sum of money for using it , 
  keeper was n't last in defense , a defender went to cover at the goal , so technically it 's not a red, 
  da da-da da da-da da da-da da, 
  daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  are you sure you 're in the right place mate ? 
  [ @mubg ] ( http://twitter.com/mubg ), 
  can i suggest editing your posts and formatting it like this :, 
  [ made it into a list ] ( https://twitter.com/#!/mubg/reddit-com-r-reddevils/members ) , for easier subscribing and following each other , will update as appropriate later . 
  edit : updated the list , should have everyone who posted so far, 
  edit2 : thanks to chewdl the twitter list is in the sidebar now !, 
  it 's news , because prior to them changing that stupid rule , we had scholes and rooney banned because of red cards in a friendly . 
  ca n't recall if we did or did not really , but it was a written rule when it was applied ( august ) and i believe the fa changed it around october the same year . 
  one could argue they 've realized their mistake , but then again , it 's the fa we 're talking about . 
  i expect ( and observed today actually ) very few people to be aware that the rule has been changed , hence - news . 
  let 's not be bitter please . 
  messaged the mods and it 's there now !, 
  * twiddles fingers * something irish . 
  [ me , right now ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx2n9sjaht1r3550v.gif ), 
  nope , but if you find one , post it here so i can update the match thread . 
  we can try playing a ` deary me ' drinking game , but noone will last after the first half, 
  working fine for me , it 's not the stream quality , it 's really _ that _ misty, 
  here , use this as soundtrack : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ityrjy-06uk :d, 
  neither welbeck , rooney , chicharito are there , think you 're reading too much into it . 
  oh , i do n't mean it 's not possible , just personally do n't find it very likely that to be the reason . 
  what ? 
  i 'm saying they 're also not in the squad for that particular friendly game .

  he has a goal in the champions league !, 
  saf has been quoted numerous times that he loves having 4 different strikers available . 
  in a 8-2 win ... 
  doubt it to be honest . 
  they were at the end of a really bad period and they healed pretty well after that . 
  do n't think that 's the kind of decision you take after one embarrassing game . 
  you should take a picture at the so called ` futurama bench ' in didsbury 's moss park, 
  the bad news is : it works for either team !, 
  true !, 
  it 's because for the neutral ( or rival ) rodgers is much more likable then dalglish . 
  yeah , it 's a bit behind the real event , 10 minutes or so , but it 's the closest to live stream we have , 
  comes across as a really nice guy , saying the right things , respectful . 
  bright stuff . 
  the `` let 's do this '' is so . . so perfect , i 'm giggling like a little girl . 
  the manutd.com website has been shit for awhile , last few days with the overlays have been real hell . 
  my solution is to approach it as you approach a porn site , firefox + adlbock + noscript + flashblock, 
  8:08 - let 's do this !, 
  that 's maturity at the back , but in times of trouble you need a cool head upfront too, 
  it 's not a stupid question !, 
  probably the twelve days of cantona for me , second would be ` jingle bells , jingle bells , jingle all the way , oh what fun it is to see united win away ' . 
  third place would go for ` thursday nights in amsterdam ' , nostalgia and everything, 
  seems i 've missed that , what did they try to do ?

  lol :d yeah , this one never gets old , does it , 
  i will not be able to provide the usual match thread as i need to head out , but here is a stream for the game . 
  also , seems fletch is with the u21s , either playing or as coach, 
  oh but we were , it was used first when liverpool did n't make the champions league for the first time , taunting them with ` thursdays nights , channel five ' . 
  it was adopted vs. wolverhampton as a ironic cheer when we could n't make it out of the group stage , it only changed to amsterdam , when the opponent was clear . 
  okay honestly , who the fuck would downvote this ? 
  funny how even on a platform that supports hd , they 've chosen not to use it . 
  * sigh * the web team is pretty clueless, 
  lol , 
  '' ... poor production processes resulting in 1 in 6 products failing to receive the homeopathic ingredient ... '', 
  that 's hilarious !, 
  one would argue that is precisely the problem with homeopathy . 
  umm , i 'll have to disagree with you there , the amount of important , critical goals nani has scored is astonishing . 
  he pretty much solo carried the team through the first half of the 2010/2011 season . 
  need i point back to the community shield 3:2 win over city , to remind you who scored the injury time winning goal ? 
  nani might be frustrating , might be a bit selfish , but he is in no way the way you describe him . 
  rant over , as for the bid , the russian fanclub said the media in russia is going with the story , so it seems legit . 
  however nobody really expect us to agree a deal with them . 
  `` sex at dawn '' and everything by michael shermer, 
  having medical at bridgewater hospital , but looks like it 's close . 
  i like that he looks eager and impatient to start , 
  seeing he was bought as cover , probably will play some reserves games and feature in the carling cup . 
  nani of all people is one-footed ? 
  seriously ? 
  look , i do n't ask you to like him , but for fuck sake , that 's a lame excuse . 
  uuum . . a bit of [ reddiquette ] ( http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette ) for you :, 
  `` vote . 
  the up and down arrows are your tools to make reddit what you want it to be . 
  if you think something contributes to conversation , upvote it . 
  if you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community , downvote it . '', 
  you should n't downvote someone , just because his opinion does n't match yours . 
  next , for your statement , nani being one footed , there are tons of video evidence that it 's wrong . 
  obviously you have chosen to ignore it and keep to your agenda , that 's fine really , sad , but fine . 
  the guy has more goals and crosses with either foot probably then everyone else in the team . 
  obviously we will not agree with each other on the matter , so i 'm just gon na stop replying . 
  but - please inform your self, 
  i would really love different color for tagged threads like :, 
  [ press conference ] - * self explanatory *, 
  [ friendly ] - * self explanatory *, 
  [ u21s ] - * former reserves league , basically match threads for the reserves *, 
  [ u18s ] - * former academy league , basically match threads for the reserves *, 
  if possible and definately not urgent at all , little icons for match threads , a football , yellow card , red card etc, 
  but . . 
  i do n't really need to be a mod to do this ? 
  no need for the mod stuff , i 'm fine as it is,
