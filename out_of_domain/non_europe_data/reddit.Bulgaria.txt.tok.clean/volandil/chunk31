  i would . 
  him or thorpe , michael keane also . 
  but that 's me , obviously saf has different ideas . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if he was not doing what the management expects him to do he would 've been dropped long ago . 
  instead , evra is the record starter for mufc for the last two seasons at least - ergo , he must be doing something right . 
  do you really believe there could be a mufc player who does n't do exactly what is asked of him by saf and he would continue to start in each and every game , as a captain nonetheless ? 
  honestly ? 
  yes , he is being caught out of position , because you ca n't expect from someone who has just sprinted 50 yards to get to the opponent 's penalty box to magically teleport himself back in defense , but that is expected and that 's why you have a winger or a cm ready to fill in the gap . 
  seriously , it 's not just you , sorry if i am being a bit over dramatic , but i 've seen this complain/comment so many times , while it 's baffling obvious that evra himself is doing just fine with whatever is asked of him . 
  yup , they quote the same press conference . 
  you 're right thou , bbc are one of the last islands of reliability . 
  good find , added the youtube link in the post . 
  awesome , congratulations !!, 
  now that the welcome party is over , go on , make this an even more awesome subreddit , 
  i think we should stick to a standard size for that ` picture of the day or month ' , otherwise everything will keep on being . . you know , different , 
  oh look , spam . 
  the homo-sapiens needs huge cock drawn in , just to show off how big our balls are . 
  both should be gone imo . 
  incorporate the crest in the title bar , up top , have a relevant picture in the side bar and clear background . 
  excluding the hitchhiker , i would recommend : [ `` year zero : a novel by rob reid '' ] ( http://www.amazon.com/year-zero-a-novel-ebook/dp/b005x0k520/ref=tmm_kin_title_0 ), 
  this will go in history as `` the great transfer muppet suicide of 2012 '', 
  it 's a joke , not a dick . 
  do n't take it so hard . 
  so , a lenovo commercial trying to go viral ? 
  please . 
  wow . 
  just wow . 
  love it !!, 
  thank you all !,

   `` well done there like '', 
  ftfy , 
  true , but if i am not wrong , his goals against arsenal and blackburn came when he technically was a right back . 
  as that guy just said on twitter - ` nobody comes out of a 50/50 with ryan tunnicliffe with the ball . ', 
  wow . . did you just see that ? 
  looks rusty to me , needs some games to get some sharpness and should be fine, 
  oh when the cheats go diving iiin , they wan na go down in numbers , oh when the cheats go diving in, 
  him and evans both with 90 minutes is great news , yeah !, 
  the carling cup run should be exciting to watch , just hope we get the right mix of youth and experience,

  you 'll like the trafford bar , no question about that . 
  love the blaize on non-match days , quiet and decent food . 
  never really managed to like the food in the trafford bar , thou the place is awesome for it 's memorabilia . 
  match day drinks - under the tent at sam platts ', 
  tunnicliffe : i think so , yeah . 
  when the academy side won the fa youth cup ravel and pogba stole all the headlines , but it was the hardworking guys that actually drove the team forward . 
  away from the spotlight , assists and ball winning were provided by tunnicliffe , lingard and larnell cole , combined with the lethal finishing of will keane . 
  all of those stand a decent chance at the 1st team , with some luck with injuries and good cup runs . 
  i really hope things turn out well for them . 
  macheda needs a break with his loans , just a decent championship side and a good run of games will do wonders for him . 
  games in two neighbor countries . 
  i should make it to the cluj and galatasaray games and hopefully ( if my boss does n't kill me ) the braga at ot one . 
  just keep your fingers crossed cluj use the national stadium in bucharest and not their own stadia !, 
  edit : if anyone , and i mean ** anyone ** goes to any of the away games , let 's try to arrange meeting points and help each other . 
  if cluj choose bucharest for venue and for people passing through sofia on the way to istanbul i 'll be glad to help with anything !, 
  absolutely !, 
  and would 've been nice to be an away game , our travelling fans sound terrific when packed inside one stand instead of spread around the quiet ot,

  i laughed . 
  i have to admit i also downvoted , but i had a laugh , so thank you , 
  mufc had a statement today that young is missing from this squad due to a knock he got against fulham . 
  30k capacity ? 
  not bad at all !, 
  any ideas hows air traffic to and from cluj-napoca ? 
  any low-cost companies ? 
  i do n't really , have n't seen it , have n't been there . 
  just got a little emotional yesterday , a bucharest stadium will ease my travelling a lot . 
  good idea to edit that a bit now , when i 'm much more calm , 
  you must be an atheist :p, 
  there you go mate : http://redd.it/ukwgd, 
  just recalled the thread , tought to educate you how easy it is to use the ` search ' function and ended digging through my own history to find it . 
  sooo , it was n't really easily searchable , 
  if ( when ) we get the country flairs after our usernames it will be fun :p, 
  the league cup - former carling cup , it got rebranded again ,

  ever since i watched ` parade ' i ca n't help to call all former yugo republics with their nicknames from the movie . 
  soo , what 's up ustash ? 
  ( hope i got that right ), 
  yes , you need to . 
  next bid is not aimed at you directly , it 's a general frustration of mine . 
  the membership costs 32/35 pounds . 
  that 's not a lot of money once a year . 
  it 's not a monthly subscription and you actually get a nice pack with a dvd and some memorabilia with it . 
  so many people making such a big fuss about the membership , it 's stunning . 
  i was able to afford the one united membership when i was a poor student , when i was just starting work and now when i have a decent job . 
  it 's not that hard.the expense to get your ou is minimal , compared to any other expense related to going to matches . 
  ca n't get my head around why would n't anyone get it , really . 
  hm . . well , that puts things into perspective , 
  ca n't you get tickets through galatasaray ? 
  would n't need membership for united for that, 
  @doronsolomon on twitter has such lists , current players , young players , etc. 
  will dig out a link in a bit, 
  edit : @doronsalomon is the correct account , here are the lists :, 
  squirrels , squirrels everywhere . 
  ca n't paint them all .
