  brilliant !!, 
  thanks a lot for this !, 
  ace !, 
  ha , just got back from the pub and saw the match thread , love the opta style explanations - ace , 
  huge ginger head , aaah !!, 
  just play ` seven nation army ' in the background and start humming , 
  also : [ link ] ( http://youtu.be/sgyfwp8v2me ), 
  you 're suggesting that his mental state is deteriorating and this is evident for you , as a casual tv viewer , but not evident for the board , the directors and the other coaches and people involved in the club , who see him on a day to day basis . 
  i love how you went and put arguments to prove your hypothesis , but i 'm sorry , it 's pretty much bollocks . 
  i am too surprised by the keeper rotation , but on the other hand , it worked pretty well for ddg . 
  he came back stronger , more confident and put all those amazing displays which showed his shot stopping skills . 
  i 'm still not understanding what exactly saf is doing in terms of man management of the two keepers and it 's a bit early to judge the result of it yet . 
  the evra argument thing is getting a bit tiring already . 
  seriously , you and everyone else that is absolutely 100 % sure evra is shit at defending - do you really , honestly think such thought did n't occur to the coaches at all ? 
  he is an attacking full back , this is his role in the team , to push forward , to occupy the defense and stretch the game , while the left ` winger ' is drifting inside the open space created by evra . 
  yes , he does n't have that many assists or goals , but the opportunities that arise from his play are numerous . 
  no , nobody expects him to teleport himself back in defense when someone looses the ball in the middle of an attacking move . 
  that 's why there are two center backs and a midfielder staying a bit further back , to intercept such moments . 
  it 's very simple the reason he is starting all those games is not because of lack of backup , but simply because evra is doing exactly what the management expects of him . 
  sure , he makes mistakes , slips , lets in some headers that he should 've won , but that 's what every player does - mistakes . 
  they 're rare enough . 
  if , and i 'm pretty sure of this , if a player does n't follow the tactical approach by saf and the coaches he is simply frozen out of the team , take berba for example . 
  it 's from a bulgarian bank commercial . 
  the whole commercial goes with an english gentleman always going ahead of berbatov everywhere , with explanation from a voice ` the gentleman is from london ' and berba getting more and more frustrated . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hflgrixhbs ) is the second clip from it , funny , 
  [ ah , here it is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd9gb9v57e0 ), 
  what you did is the easiest way , last season ( and this , and next ) there is a slight change that viagogo is eliminated , thus reducing the cost of ticket s some quid . 
  or , you can try to get your hands on some spares before a not-very-popular game , but i would n't really risk it . 
  have n't seen it happen personally , but i 've heard the same too , so there might be some truth in it . 
  as for the one united membership , i really do n't see the big deal about it , it 's once a year , you get a pack with some nice memorabilia with it , you get your card with 10 % off the megastore and you can apply for games . 
  it 's 30 quid , it 's not 300 !, 
  people spent more then this a week on booze and cigs ffs . 
  oh i do know , it 's not that easy unfortunately . 
  [ oh you !, 
  ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/312/563/05d.jpg ), 
  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=numberwang be my guest , 
  oh , that 's fake for sure . 
  using the same username as ando 's instagram handle , that 's clever , but it 's fake . 
  he did n't really mention the twitter account , just the instagram handle , which has been known for awhile . 
  someone decided to cash in that the same twitter username was free . 
  since they ditched viagogo it has been really easy to get tickets for the non-derby games . 
  i 'm very happy with that change !, 
  the guy running it is the typical pr person , charity work here , we prepare for the next game yadda yadda the lads yadda yadda . 
  i 'm not sure if it has been once or twice , nani himself wrote something and the way it was written was so different it was obvious it was him . 
  like berbatov 's use of smilies on his facebook page . 
  by the way , his twitter account is genuine : [ @anriquez9 ] ( https://twitter.com/anriquez9 ), 
  anyone else unable to get rid of the fucking overlays in manutd.com ? 
  it 's showing up for registered , logged in users too . 
  they already have that information for them , wtf ? 
  nah , i 've been registered for years , usually stay logged in , it 's showing up and ca n't be removed for registered , logged in users also !, 
  i 've been approaching manutd.com lately with the caution i use for new porn sites . 
  it makes it bearable , but one should not need to resort to such tactics to see the club 's website . 
  for pre game drinks i would add the bishop 's blaize ( even if it 's just for being famous on youtube , real hell to get into thou ) and the toll gate inn ( redcafe seems to like it ) . 
  stuff to do , places to visit beside the stadium :, 
  cloud 23 , it 's the fancy bar in the middle of the beetham tower ( the tall signature building on deansgate ) , the view from the bar is great late , when all the lights are up . 
  you can and should check ` the hole ' in the bar , where you can peek 23 stories below you . 
  ( might be refused entrance if you 're wearing sport shoes/clothes , be more casual ), 
  mosi - the museum of science and industry , great place to spend your whole day . 
  the kyoto lounge on grosvernor street , near the manchester university , an internet cafe , games lounge and great place for nachos and fifa on xbox , 
  the brittons protection on deansgate , ancient pub established in 1811 , very authentic , amazing place . 
  the bench in didsbury 's moss park with bender and all the other comic characters is reddit famous , so you might want to take a picture on it . 
  for food , i would really recommend the ` pesto ' italian restaurants , they serve small dishes , so you can try many different things and they 're all cooked great . 
  there is one in the center , on deansgate street and one in the trafford center . 
  for hotels , the etap hotel is very close to the stadium and is suited very well for ` just visiting for the game ' kind of people . 
  i 'll think of more and i 'll add it later , but ** we better sumarize all this in a faq section , linked in the sidebar **, 
  we definately need to have this in a faq summary , linked pretty high on the sidebar, 
  oops , did n't see that . 
  awesome !, 
  one ticket per membership , you are correct . 
  the seats which are sold for ou members are those who are not owned by season ticket holders , usually high up in the stands . 
  the scarves ... the half and half scarves . . * shudder *, 
  that 's not how it works really , the ticket office works mostly online , through the site that d1794 posted in the start . 
  you can pick up your ticket from the ticket office at the stadium , but ordering , paying and etc is done online anyway . 
  check your account [ history ] ( https://www.eticketing.co.uk/muticketsandmembership/myaccount/accounthistory.aspx ) - if the purchase is there , your tickets are there . 
  if you 're in one of the blocks which operate with paper tickets , they 'll arrive in your mailbox 1-2 weeks before the game . 
  if the seats are in the other blocks , they 'll be assigned to your membership card and you 'll get an email about it . 
  i believe the idea was put on hold : [ link ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/tickets-and-hospitality/tickets-and-hospitality-news/2012/may/manchester-united-singing-section-update.aspx ), 
  i personally loved it and would love to see it implemented . 
  those pics are sort of a tradition , just the guy uploading them and managing ` hqworld ' was on a vacation for awhile . 
  hopefully we 'll be up to date with high resolution match pics soon . 
  false . 
  that 's 60 bgn ( bulgarian lev ) which is roughly 30 eur . 
  on a side note , moar ? 
  great to see the fcuom doing well . 
  good lads . 
  it 's not that bad , kagawa stated today it 's just a twinge and should be fine for saturday . 
  `` a recent survey from market research team kantar found that 659 million people - close to 10 % of the world 's population - follows manchester united . '', 
  - ** false **, 
  the study which came up with that number had numerous structural issues :, 
  * kantar questioned 54,000 people in 39 countries between june and august 2011 , and its survey revealed football had 1.6 billion followers globally . 
  fans were allowed to name more than one club as their favourite . 
  let 's agree that extrapolating a % of 54k people that can name more then one ( and two , and three ) clubs for favorite is flawed . 
  the number was coined as part of the campaign to raise the awareness and value of the club before the ipo on the new york stock exchange . 
  the ** brand united ** - sorry , but i 'll have to disagree with you . 
  the whoring of the brand began very recently and is directly correlated with the arrival of the glazer family as owners . 
  one of the first major changes to backroom staff that happened after their leveraged buyout of the club was a brand new office in canary warf , london for a team of 40 people . 
  that was the brand new marketing department , that created the amazing partnerships with dhl ( paying money to have their name on the reserves/training gear ) and created the amazing feat of ` local ' sponsorship , where brands which are limited to mostly one country , can become exclusive partners and promoters of united . 
  the test deal for such local partnership was the bulgarian telecom globul , which is selling a ` man united ' subscription plan and some branded little things . 
  as far as i know , at least 2 more such ` local ' partnerships has been signed meanwhile . 
  those are just the prime examples of the change of focus that happened to the manchester united brand recently .
