  i think we can all agree that the line was actually crossed a little bit further back , when the famous logo was changed from ` manchester united football club ' , dropping the fc part all together . 
  not sure exactly which year that happened , but i think that 's the moment ` the brand ' became more important then the club . 
  ** brandstanding **, 
  while i agree that the general social media presence of united is either non-existing or just terrible , i would argue that you and i do n't see the targeted messages which are aimed only at specific auditorium . 
  i 've received and seen at least 2 specific posts about my region , which is not very interesting region anyway , i think it 's safe to assume they post more stuff for different markets . 
  conclusion might be simple , that england and the united kingdom are not considered facebook worthy market . 
  those are my objection about what you wrote . 
  what i really do n't understand is the point the post is trying to make ? 
  that the club lied about the number of fans ? 
  that their social media usage is horrendous ? 
  that there are different types of people across the planet ? 
  fyi : i said `` worthy '' not `` ready '', 
  still did n't word that properly i guess , let me explain :, 
  facebook pages can target messages to specific audience , you can limit the viewers by geographical region , by language spoken and others . 
  what we all see is the ` general ' nonsense talk by the united facebook page : ` click like if you bla bla ' and so on . 
  my points was , that there might be more communication and actually better use of the social media presence , which uk citizens simply do not see , because they 're not in the target audience . 
  if the return rate or general buzz created by people that speak english as primary language and live in the united kingdom is very small , no marketing department will bother targeting it specifically . 
  that 's all i was trying to explain, 
  oh , i agree completely that we 're light years away from them in term of usage of social media . 
  however , there are other reasons for that . 
  mufc just recently moved up to become the 6th most recognizable brand in the ** world ** , i 'll quote :, 
  `` behind only google , apple , the bbc , dyson and facebook . 
  in the same survey chelsea are placed 54th , arsenal 160th and liverpool 171st . '', 
  [ link ] ( http://www.soccerticketsonline.com/man-united-are-sixth-most-recognisable-brand-in-the-world/ ), 
  that means mufc as a brand is ahead in brand recognition of `` coca cola '' , `` microsoft '' and `` mcdonalds '' . 
  think about it . 
  the red devil logo is more recognizable around the world , compared to those brands . 
  this means , the most useful thing that social media provides - brand recognition , is lost for the brand . 
  that is already there . 
  others , as the aforementioned clubs need to expand , need to be more recognized , so they have a huge intent of doing better and finding new venues . 
  in short , i think it 's just complacency . 
  the club has put minimum effort in it , because it can do just fine without it . 
  that can be shortsighted and maybe disastrous , but it might as wel be the better way to deal with the situation . 
  i really do n't feel educated enough on the matter to decide which one is the correct way to handle it . 
  oh , i do hate it with passion . 
  i 'm just trying to figure out an unlikely explanation why it is so bad . 
  by the way , if you check the ` timeline ' part of it , it 's amazing , just click on different years ( way back , in the 50s and 60s ) and you get a great archive of all things united , with proper photos and everything . 
  so obviously someone there has a good idea how to use it , but for some reason , they are not using it on 100 % on a day to day basis . 
  game was n't on any tv station unfortunately . 
  full 90 minutes i think , it 's good , getting full games ( even at reserves level ) under his belt is good . 
  one day , when i grow up , i 'll know how to make pictures with such color tone and i 'll be a happy person . 
  welcome , 
  when he grows up ,, 
  oh you know he 's gon na be ,, 
  he 's gon na be the only scotsman in our team ,, 
  now he 's grown up ,, 
  and he 's realised his dream ,, 
  he 's gon na play alongside giggsy , scholes and keane . 
  oh he would run 500 miles ,, 
  and he would run 500 more ,, 
  just to be that man who might just score ,, 
  and to ruin the scousers day once more ( ), 
  na na na na na na na . . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8wjoql79ci there you go , completely forgot about it , now added to the original post up there too . 
  cheers !, 
  experience wise , evra brings something buttner will be unable to provide for some years still . 
  the fuck are the media on about ? 
  it even says it in the article :, 
  * `` making clear that there was * ** `` nothing specifically referencing hillsborough '' ** * in saturday 's anti-liverpool chanting . 
  * the song in question has been sung * ** ever since the luis su\u00e1rez-patrice evra incident ** * in the corresponding anfield fixture last season , after which the uruguayan was found guilty of aiming racist slurs at the french left-back , receiving an eight-match ban and a # 40,000 fine . 
  as glad as i am that the jft96 campaign was successful , i suspect it will be heavily twisted and used by the media just because of our next pl fixture . 
  why would it be out of order ? 
  the chant in question has nothing to do with hillsborough and everyone knows it . 
  what a weird thing to hope for . 
  what 's next , hoping they have more points ? 
  to prove an imaginary argument you have with the manager ? 
  if it was so widely known , how come no one had a problem with that chant till now ? 
  that chant has been in wide use ever since the evra/suarez incident , if nobody found it bad before the investigation results , i do n't really agree it could be attributed extra meaning now . 
  think beckham and scholes might disagree with you there . 
  i for one agree completely with your words . 
  about time we stop accepting guilt-inducing movie quotes so literally . 
  i 'm not into predictions , but i 'm so pumped up about this match , the next few hours will take forever . 
  been a shitty busy day at work , i need a pint and i need it now !, 
  for some reason i 've been warming up with [ this ] ( http://youtu.be/7qz1rdoouc0 ), 
  united !, 
  united !, 
  yup , that 's the moment from the tour where words desert you and you just sit there like a sponge , absorbing every precious moment of it . 
  or simply you did n't like it . 
  while i love the style of writing of stephen king , i found myself hating some of his works . 
  try some other books of his , some of the older things , see if it clicks for you , if it does n't , just move on . 
  just because some majority considers it a good book , does n't mean you should like it automatically . 
  do n't think location/region has anything to do with it . 
  oh jesus , i really wish he did n't . 
  the asshole minority will not care for that letter and the majority of normal , match going fans has had pretty much enough of media drum-banging about the importance of being polite . 
  ca n't wait for this game to be over . 
  could n't play them at a worst time really . 
  * insite * ( i 'm not trying to be a dick , i 'm just assuming english is n't your native language , as it is n't mine , and i 'm trying to help ), 
  i 'm a moron obviously , correct word is ** insight ** thanks to daveisme, 
  i 'll just repost the same thing i posted in / r/reddevils, 
  `` the asshole minority will not care for that letter and the majority of normal , match going fans has had pretty much enough of media drum-banging about the importance of being polite .

  oh what an embarrassment . 
  you are of course , correct .

  the whole thing has been blown way out of proportion and is getting ridiculous now .
