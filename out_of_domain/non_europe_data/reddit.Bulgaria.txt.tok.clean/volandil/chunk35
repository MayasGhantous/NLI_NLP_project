  hear hear ? 
  was a very good shot too , off the bar and in , not much the keeper could do . 
  if only that combination between jesse lingard and cole a minute earlier was in . 
  eeeh ... 
  wootton and michael keane seems to be closest , partly because of the defensive crisis we have . 
  they 're getting precious playing time with the first team , which will speed up their progress . 
  from the current reserves crop , my personal favorite is tunnicliffe , i was hoping for a good league cup draw , so he can be utilized , but with newcastle at home and now chelsea away , it 's doubtful he will see much playing time . 
  maybe in the fa cup , if we draw a league 1/2 side . 
  two other players which seem to be ready for first team action are jesse lingard and larnell cole , both have been training with the first team at some point last season , both made their debuts already . 
  same goes for petrucci , everyone 's been expecting him to start challenging for the first team by now , i 'm personally surprised he did n't go out on loan . 
  biggest question mark for me is how will will keane do when he finally goes back to training and playing , after that horrible injury he got . 
  he looked too good for the reserves last season , his debut was though but he did well . 
  hopefully he will recover form quickly . 
  if he only had the brain to match his skills . . 
  in the same way i ca n't wait for a nuclear war . 
  the resulting post-apocalyptica would be amazing , fascinating , unbelievable , but really , really scary . 
  you , or rather your dad should 've gotten an email from the ticketing office with a subject, 
  `` your ticket has been added to your membership card . '', 
  you can always just call the ticketing office and ask them , they 'll ask for your membership number , date of birth and names to verify that it 's really you . 
  another thing you can do , is check your account history on the ticketing section of the website . 
  the purchase and the two tickets should appear in the account history , probably of your dads account . 
  a wild , and a bit overweight anderson appeared -  [ link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/h2irc.jpg ), 
  away games are amazing and here i want to express my gratitude to romania for having teams in the cl groups two years in a row , allowing me to visit at least two away games so far . 
  this drink goes to the hard work of the ocelul galati and cfr cluj people . 
  cheers . 
  these guys are reliable , reporting touts and helping people at face value : https://twitter.com/mufc_tickets, 
  this one too : https://twitter.com/chrls_metcalfe/status/258327954164183040, 
  '' got a spare for stoke this weekend , stretford end upper , face value '', 
  you sorted ? 
  wan na go to the reserves game today ? 
  my vote is for nw , great atmosphere , as close as you can get to stretty without a season ticket, 
  i can not words , because boobs, 
  ha , seems ralics got a little famous  i just asked him for a non-ugly version of this , hopefully he 'll send me one and i 'll post it here . 
  the internationals would take some rest if possible , specially with a cl game 3 days later . 
  so scholes + anderson midfield is pretty possible . 
  fletch played for scotland , cleverley and carrick for england , doubt they 'll start . 
  well , except carrick maybe .

  the side bar has a link to a post with lots of stuff to do around/in manchester you might want to check it out . 
  no biggie , glad it 's useful !, 
  he was , i 'm too lazy to dig back the previous press conference threads , but he was supposed to be 2 weeks from returning a week ago or something . 
  now it 's 2-3 weeks . 
  no idea if it has any added significance to be honest , usually there is at least one player accompanying him at press conferences . 
  michael keane and one of rio/evra ( just in case ) i guess, 
  the guy 's facebook is : https://www.facebook.com/ralicsgfx so if you 're kind enough to send him some traffic , it would be terrific . 
  the paul scholes testimonial game vs. ny cosmos , full hi-res gallery [ here ] ( http://hqworld.net/2011/08/paul-scholes-testimonial-5-august/#axzz2a8vylocx ), 
  do n't think so , the background picture is hard to find in a high resolution as it 's ancient, 
  there is one old video like that , from the 80s , and it 's amazing . 
  [ link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j33aw-selfi&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=pl3a5a9eb1f643fdd3&amp;feature=results_video ), 
  but it might be too big for a header image , 
  so much pure joy in one picture , 
  it 's not the chelsea fans , sorry . 
  we just do n't like the idea . 
  i think the upvote/downvote mechanism is perfect for voting purposes . 
  we 're having a vote on which picture to put on their subreddit if we win , of course i would upvote the ones i like and downvote the ones i dislike . 
  i 'm sorry if you disagree . 
  your idea is funny , i ca n't deny you that . 
  i just do n't like it . 
  done !, 
  i would go with the scorers/assist table . 
  it 's build on solid statistics , unlike the injury one , which is based on what saf allows the public to know on press conferences . 
  we just do n't have accurate information on the injuries , the physioroom site is just doing educated guesses based on rumors and bits and pieces of information . 
  problem with it is that the information is not very reliable . 
  we have estimations , we have the dreaded ` back in two weeks ' mantra and that 's it . 
  seems the mods have honored it and you as fans and as a community ( subreddit ) have really grown in my eyes . 
  really want to virtually shake your hand . 
  been taking the piss whole day with ` ferguson 's ref army !! ', 
  ca n't believe some of the responses i get , from our own fans even !, 
  come on mate , you just happen to remember the ones that go against your team . 
  i have clear and horrible memories of drogba being 3 meters offside and scoring a winning goal and that carrick penalty that was never one . 
  refs fuck up , it happens . 
  you !, 
  how dare you talk sense !, 
  go back in the mod corner you crawled out of !, 
  still think he is a bit of a twat , but you 're correct . 
  `` duncan jenkins '' was a parody account . 
  it was well known to be a parody account . 
  this is like suing someone for a story on the onion or newsthump . 
  well , if they choose to believe what a parody account says , i do n't ... 
  i do n't even . 
  the ones that did n't leave at around the 30th minute are cool , i agree . 
  ^ it 's ^ ok , ^ i ^ ^ wont ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ anyone, 
  last few days there has been a lot of buzz that talks for new contract has ceased and both sides agreed that nani would be off in the summer . 
  now , i would take it with a pinch of salt , as most are daily mail , the sun etc with ` sources close to the player ' and ` sources close to the club ' . 
  if and that 's a huge if , it is true , i can see him leaving in january . 
  or the queen, 
  `` their '', 
  twitter chatter says 6 on pitch , 6 on bench ? 
  whos the sixth on pitch , does rafael qualify as an academy player ? 
  yup , 6 on pitch , seems rafael does qualify as `` homegrown '' .

  just sort the thread by ` new ' not by ` top ' and refresh from time to time, 
  `` typical sturridge dive '' :d, 
  there is a great sopcast link in the comments . 
  edit : [ link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/12ewjk/match_thread_chelsea_vs_manchester_united/c6uht5p ), 
  giggs will tear you apart , again !!, 
  6000 for this game , loving it . 
  in london , kids wear chicharito 's masks for helloween . 
  there is a consensus among the fans , loudly proclaimed every home and away game , that he indeed , can shag who he wants .
