  pogba is the strange matter . 
  clearly the coaching staff and saf had long term plans for him , what happened is still not quiet clear . 
  was it his agent , was it him wanting too much , was it saf being too cautious , i 'm still not sure we know everything about that . 
  think will should be returning to training any moment now , no ? 
  awesome !, 
  that 's why one of the first siringes you can craft is ` animal repellent ', 
  i 'm living in an east european former communist country and thought pretty much the same . 
  then one of the creation museum founders came here to promote their wierd dvd 's that explain `` everything '' and show the mistakes of science and etc , etc. 
  we had a meeting to discuss the science behind it , it was horrible . 
  it 's one of the most demoralizing experiences i 've ever had . 
  it 's not that they 're stupid per se , it 's the way they rationalize idiotic beliefs that 's really troubling . 
  * shudder *, 
  he is humble with journalists , that is correct . 
  however , in his daily life , with other people , specially normal , non-famous folks , he is an ass . 
  source : i 'm a bulgarian . 
  only once , in the lobby before a local tv show . 
  he was still in leverkusen back then . 
  ca n't say he was really an ass , but we were sit on the same sofa for 30 minutes waiting for the hosts to arrive and brief us , and he did n't really aknowledge my existance for that time . 
  it was kinda funny actually , because my gf back then did n't like him at all before that and when she saw him live there , right next to her , she was kinda starstruck . 
  he does look very good in person . 
  a lot of stories i 've heard come from people that worked in hotels he stayed in and some from carrington staff . 
  usually the stories ( from people that have no relation to each other ) match pertty close on how he behaves with people that are considered ` not important ' . 
  it 's certinaly a possibility , yes . 
  this one time i was just in the audience , but a month or two later - in the show yeah . 
  not really sure if it counts as a ` product ' , but i use terminal and bash shell for simple arithmetic operations by echo $ ( ( x-y * z ) ) when i 'm too lazy to click on the calculator icon, 
  he will most definitely need some games before he reaches that form again , but yeah , me too !, 
  rooney is training . . yeah starting on sunday then . 
  i am . 
  they always perform against us . 
  we do n't always perform against them . 
  so yeah , i 'm pretty nervous , specially with everyone thinking it 's done . 
  the spirit of the first team seems to be present even at reserves and academy level , 
  those extra goals are so fucking distracting !, 
  great volley that !, 
  `` typical united '' , 
  he had a quiet game , but still was key figure for our first goal, 
  why so catholic ? 
  that 's pete boyle 's chant i guess ? 
  ` never ' win ` fuck all ' is a double negative so it does n't make much sense to me ? 
  with cfr 's cluj half time song as background music , loved it : http://youtu.be/kmuyabzyxjo, 
  hello father . 
  yes . 
  ' a bargain ', 
  so that 's why they killed off curtis !, 
  those bastards !, 
  ca n't wait for them to sell the rights for the toilets to someone ( probably onyl thing left unbranded at the stadium ) . 
  `` company name '' restrooms , your piss powered by ` company name ' . . bah . 
  neither any of his teammates from the 1994 miracle team . 
  things changed shortly afterwards . 
  maybe only stillian petrov is a good , hard working and non-lazy bulgarian footballer from the newer generations . 
  [ you ] ( http://files-cdn.formspring.me/photos/20120302/n4f5095c631db8.jpg ), 
  came to say tosic . 
  thou , in an interview i read somewhere , he ( tosic ) did say to the journalist that he is still wondering from time to time if he should 've stayed for another year and is having doubts if he made the best move . 
  so i guess at the end it was his choice to leave . 
  you should totally meet in platts and drink a strongbow on my behalf . 
  for the norwich home game , think every normal one united member will be able to get a ticket . 
  if you 're not memebrs , the guys behind [ @mufc_tickets ] ( https://twitter.com/mufc_tickets ) should be able to help you . 
  so . . how do you follow footy down there , do you put the tv upside down ? 
  `` this is staged as fuck '' - pretty much every bulgarian out there, 
  `` your third clue would 've been a lot of monopoly money '' - hahaha :d, 
  i would go for the outlet shops if i were you , the lowry in salford quays and tk max ( theres one at arndale ), 
  i thought degea had a great day and saved our asses in the second half . 
  he is at fault for the goal obviously . 
  did n't think so , still does n't seem correct to ` blame it at him ' but if both vds and garry say so , i 'll have to take their word on the matter . 
  still my motm . 
  mistakes happen . 
  '' [ qatar ] manchester united are staying at the grand heritage doha hotel & spa , first training session of their trip is at 5pm ast today '' \u0430ccording to [ @redmancunian ] ( https://twitter.com/redmancunian ), 
  what the fuck man , how did i missed that ? 
  * mind blown *, 
  fur ... fur everywhere, 
  [ mufc ministry of silly walks ] ( http://www.imagebam.com/image/0d7b8f233509901 ), 
  is n't that tufty you 're talking about ? 
  ( everton/liverpool resident coming to manchester , not the songs/cds ), 
  mirror are ` breaking ' a story that it 's thumb fracture and will miss the games against us . 
  same thing has been bugging me too . 
  no idea why are we handling the goalkeepers this last two seasons like this . 
  just no idea . 
  not a gif but a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t6qpqkhv5y ), 
  great idea this , maybe the mods can put up some highlight code for [ loan watch ] or something similar and we can have a weekly update ? 
  would be awesome !, 
  sunday . 
  5:45 pm gmt, 
  this sounds kinda awesome , but i do n't understand probably 90 % of it . 
  can you explain it for people coming from the frontpage , like me ? 
  i guess jump to is intrusional , while open bridge to is kinda ok ? 
  location , location , location . 
  yeah . . that 's not down to the computer , you 're basically running a huge java applet trying to do 3d rendering . 
  it 's gon na be this slow and more . 
  get the optifine patch and enjoy your far rendered distances . 
  is it just me , or boyle has been overreacting on everything lately ? 
  his new chants , for example , anything i can recall , including this one are all half-arsed attempts to come up with something original . 
  just trying too hard . 
  sometimes you do n't really need to ` invent ' the chant , ffs , let it happen when the occasion comes . 
  oh fuck this guy with a stick !, 
  do n't be a dick . 
  the guy is asking legitimate questions which are bothering more then just him . 
  it looks like you have an agenda . 
  either explain it or fuck off . 
  i know , right ?!, 
  his own association of all .
