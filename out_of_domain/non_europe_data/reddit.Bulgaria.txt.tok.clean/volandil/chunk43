  waiter . 
  think you 're looking for / r/reddevils mate, 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  thanks . 
  that 's the crappen , 
  and another one , from earlier : [ link ] ( http://redflagflyinghigh.com/2013/02/blogs/an-apology-to-ryan-giggs ), 
  do n't think it will be possible to get normal tickets for the game mate , there was russel fuckin brand whoring tickets from rio on twitter earlier , it 's that bad . 
  that explains why i have n't heard anything about him . 
  sorry , no real idea about him , 
   if you are waiting for him to become a great striker you will definitely be disappointed !, 
  i disagree . 
  he will indeed become a great striker . 
  the foundations are there already to see . 
  the rest is practice and determination . 
  might take a year or two , but sooner later then later we 'll have a real treasure in him . 
  we should just enjoy the ride and be happy that we can witness it unraveling in front of us . 
  strong side indeed . 
  i remember morgan from the fayc run from 2011 , was very important player for them , interesting to see how he is handling the u21s . 
  think the ` debut ' label is messing with his head , hopefully he 'll recover from it quickly . 
  not really sure to be honest . 
  when he plays , he is doing what is expected of him , does n't shine too much thou . 
  seems to be getting more playing time lately , so he must be doing something right . 
  cheers mate , thought it needed refreshment . 
  now if we can get some icons for subs , cards and goals and it will be perfect, 
  oh yeah , it 's always a pleasure to beat them , at any level . 
  maybe if there is a way to change the background color of the table cell with some sort of css trickery ?

  it 's an old poll , 
  [ there you go ] ( http://youtu.be/cq8otqvcovu ), 
  ha , did n't realize it sounded elfish , but no , it 's not really related , 
  even funnier , if male identical twins have children with female identical twins , all their kids will be genetically brothers/sisters without being able to distinguish which family each of them belongs to . 
  blows my mind , 
  sam platt 's under the tent !, 
  the bishop blaize will be hell to get into . 
  go there two hours prior to the game , drink a lot , sing a lot . 
  enjoy it !, 
  i love how you 're getting downvoted for this :d, 
  i can understand why would you go there and joke about it , sure , banter and all that . 
  what i do n't understand is why would you come here to boast about it . 
  live : from the ` no shit sherlock ' department . 
  mother-facht !, 
  not yet mate , when i 'm in manchester i usually am at the stadium , next away when i 'm there i 'll check it probably . 
  the lime bar at the lowry just does n't have the correct feel for watching footy !, 
  this is embarrassing . 
  do n't tell me what to do !, 
  ** how do you know this ? 
  it 's not that bad really , you were in high school ffs . 
  when looking at the 2d model , just imagine you 're the destination the sun heads to . 
  you 're just keeping your distance from it constant . 
  at this rate , your kids will be able to see him play live , 
  this is brilliant !, 
  agreed , rooney plays better when he plays more often . 
  so a start vs. norwich should be good for him on tuesday . 
  welbeck and rvp rested for real as well , might get some time in the second half , but should n't start . 
  how is that an actual product with the badge on the wrong side ? 
  edit : and in mirrorish . . wtf is this ? 
  [ santiago bernabeu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mzssz2d.jpg ) did it like this, 
  here we go , here we go , here we go !, 
  not sure really , their u21s are very good indeed , so i expect the kids to be above average too, 
  our academy/u21s keepers actually look very promising , amos has already been tested vs. 
  stoke and did ok for such a game . 
  johnstone had very good loans out last season and sutherland did well when filling in for him . 
  who was the guy that shot over ? 
  and it does n't even include wilson at the moment , who has been scoring for fun lately . 
  think he is injured right now . 
  those transfer threads always remind me of people who play too much football manager . 
  hey , we need to transfer these 4 players in , change the training regime and we 're champions by a margin and unbeaten season . 
  yeah , like it works that way really . 
  watching the little kids grow into mature and dangerous footballers is so much more fun . 
  from me and / u/fallark - you 're welcome , 
  the episode 1 scene with piers morgan photo is priceless :d, 
  only for comic relief, 
  [ did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebdi0im2kcu ), 
  @henrywinter : #thfc fans chanting : `` arsene wenger ... we want you to stay '', 
  already posted the other day mate , just few posts below !, 
  he might be missing only the open training session and to go through the drills after the journalists are shown out the door . 
  thanks !, 
  ha , you beat me to it , got the script bookmarked for tonight when i have more time !, 
  edit : i love how it forms : ` play game / think united ' , 
  and added !, 
  one of the better jones games before he got badly injured was playing in a midfield position so advanced he was almost a support striker . 
  i still think he will play . 
  he puts on the table much more then just ` defensive cover ', 
  why would you do that ? 
  family ? 
  [ full game / hd 4.4 gb ] ( https://mega.co.nz/#!ioz2alrj!guxl-xk5mpmoamlmslay9fpcb-uxjqrnslcpdgyaoze ), 
  hm , just rechecked , nope , just the hd torrent file, 
  that gif :d, 
  you might like this one then : [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj15tx06kfq ), 
  think he forgot to post the video he intended , probaably the adyta promo , it 's a good one . 
  great stuff , maybe just add that anyone that wants to be in the twitter list should just message me here or @mubg on twitter, 
  ^ sunday , ^ remember ? 
  below the waist , one foot , studs up late tackle - yellow card . 
  this one was correct . 
  [ this one on the other hand , was n't ] ( http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1745003.ece/alternates/s1227b/manchester%20united%20v%20real%20madrid%20-%20uefa%20champions%20league%20round%20of%2016-1745003.jpg ), 
  it was a 50/50 challenge , holden said it , bolton 's manager at that time said , everyone else said it . 
  bad luck . 
  that 's all .
