  done his hamstring in the start of the game unfortunately , had some pretty good games recently . 
  i 've given up on will returning this season :(, 
  apparently it 's a power failure in the area , not just the stadium , so yeah , 
  i 've actually been 2 or 3 times to moss lane , it is a dull gloomy place even with the lights on !, 
  greetings from the / r/reddevils match thread for this game . 
  seems the lights are back and game will resume . 
  oh you :d, 
  it simply is . 
  ffs . 
  current squad : evans , the guy is so down to earth and intelligent , it should be awesome . 
  all time : cantona . 
  no question about that . 
  ~ ~ low percentage of them , around 6 % as far as i recall , will try to lookup sources later when i have more time . ~ ~, 
  link, 
  strange , completely missed that part . 
  thanks !, 
  white hat is young , 19-20 years old , middle asian ( whatever that means ) kid , this one was described as 50-60 year old white male on police radio chatter . 
  might be a victim with a deadman 's switch , nobody knows yet really, 
  it 's not a stupid question , but the answer is n't known as of yet . 
  probably was forced to wear it , as he seems to be cooperating with the police . 
  friend of suspect or someone who knew him , who approached police thinking they want to talk with him ( about the suspect ), 
  it 's from the start of the situation in mit , when the first suspect was shot . 
  there were two car jackings and shootings with officers since then . 
  brown is natural orange !, 
  yes , shaddap !, 
  really happy for you , enjoy every moment !, 
  it 's funny how suddenly all the spares going around for tomorrow disappeared after the spurs/city game . 
  saw a lot being offered before that, 
  it 's because the league ends in may , that 's what the lyrics are typically . 
  since citeh 's title defense will probably , ( hopefully ) not even manage to last till the end of april , they 've reuploaded it with new subs , to mock them , 
  video was uploaded today , so probably yeah , 
  [ red square ] ( https://www.facebook.com/redsquaremufc/info ) looks alright from photos and videos , should still be able to get tickets for it . 
  it 's in the old liverpool warehouse just off trafford wharf road i think . 
  would n't that be at the last home game , vs. swansea ? 
  right . 
  helps if you read a bit further up , 
  players that were in the stands ( i.e. 
  scholes , vida ) were n't on the pitch . 
  they 'll be there at the swansea game , when the title is presented, 
  you lucky sonnamabitch  ), 
  [ come as you are ] ( http://youtu.be/xpgwmfrmumq ),

  number ooone , is georgie best ... 
  shut up wenger . 
  could n't have picked up uglier places to visit and film really . 
  of all places in sofia , these ?

  is n't there an option to ` stick ' a thread to the top ? 
  thank you !, 
  nw is great place to be at ot , congrats !, 
  i thought it was funny , 
  way . 
  that baboon/pet dogs remark got me curious , googled a bit about it , saw the youtube clip , saw this : [ article from psychology today ] ( http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201112/scientific-mystery-do-wild-baboons-kidnap-puppies-pets ), 
  so while it does sound fascinating , think that baboon/dog relationship might be a bit less common then implied . 
  absolutely , and it 's great that his consistency in the u21s have been rewarded !, 
  to think he was playing in the u18s last season ... 
  what the fuck is up with sef lately and the 20 miles long banners ? 
  yeah there is , and there was a pretty big fuss couple of season ago , when we were already champions and we played hull in the last game of the season . 
  we sent not the second but the third string of players and still won of course , so all the talk about ` not the best team ' has halted since then . 
  ] ( http://bearsharkaxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/you-dont-say.jpg ), 
  ... well , i thought it was kinda funny , 
  looks good to me !, 
  i would maybe add a column for ` source ' of the information, 
  yup , i 'm not buying that ` strongest ' team statement . 
  been said before , never done . 
  yup , definitely need to get jay ( @rffh ) on reddit , would be great . 
  shit journalism starts earlier than usual this year . 
  i kinda hope they do . 
  gon na be interesting watching the shitstorm that will happen afterwards . 
  chelsea fans on their high ` we did it when we had to ' horse and etc. 
  real wankfest for the media . 
  yeah . . the science behind the arsenal poznan is kinda foggy :d, 
  [ exhibit one ] ( http://chelsea.theoffside.com/files/2010/04/gallery-chel-guard-of-hon-001.jpg ), 
  and, 
  [ exhibit two ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/10/article-2127666-1288e2ea000005dc-485_468x314.jpg ), 
  basically it 's a kind gesture by the opponents of the newly crowned champions , played once on the first game after they become champions . 
  we 've done it for chelsea and arsenal when needed , both have clapped us back i think . 
  issue this time is ( according to the media ) that a certain mister rvp is included in our squad . 
  it 's brilliant , is n't it ? 
  heard a funny one in the tram yesterday :, 
  kolo toure kolo toure sells raybans on the beach , raybans on the beach . 
  carlos tevez , carlos tevez sells cattle on the beach , cattle on the beach . . etc. . anyone know the whole lot ? 
  i happen to be in manchester for the next 3 days , i 'll be heading for that game tomorrow . 
  if you 're around and wonder what to do - let 's have a drink in the bishop 's before the game !, 
  edit :, 
  tomorrow - tuesday , 30th of april . 
  even that ` do n't use man u ' thing is wrong . 
  people would get butthurt on anything really . 
  just ignore and enjoy !, 
  but . . but . . but the u21s game is on tuesday !, 
  ( so that 's why they 're playing at ot ), 
  a shared account between 3 or 4 people , that would do the maintenance of such thread might do the trick . 
  like the ` matchdevil ' for the reserves/academy threads . 
  but yeah , i agree the wild speculations should be deleted promptly !,
