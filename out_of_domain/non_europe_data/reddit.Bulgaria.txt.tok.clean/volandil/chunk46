  ha , did n't know that , cheers !, 
  think they finally rescheduled it for 6th of may ? 
  oh i 'm taking a camera for sure , do n't think i 'll manage a banner on such short notice thou, 
  yup , been with the u21s for awhile !, 
  it 's live on mutv , there will be a match thread going on probably !, 
  there will be streams , do n't worry , 
  met paul scholes when he was ` retired ' and was doing book signings . 
  2 hours queue to get to him , quick autograph on the book , ** [ photo ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/384734_10150416615742635_690931328_n.jpg ) ** and off you go . 
  he was bored as fuck after all those people , but still managed to say hi and smile for the camera . 
  i was a bit starstruck and forgot to speak any language for awhile . 
  one of my happiest moments ** ever ** . 
  that 's some 4 or 5 year old lumix superzoom compact actually , but it does make good photos !, 
  200-300 on good days , might be less than 50 on slow days as far as i 've seen . 
  you can play up to 3 older than 21 years players . 
  actually , not at all . 
  i 'm glad it happened in a meaningless game . 
  rafael will get the needed experience , everyone will know what cunt luiz is ( like they do n't ) and nothing of significance was lost . 
  i do appreciate a well executed troll too , hope this thread does n't get downvoted , just because it 's taking the piss . 
  his twitter looks a bit different too : [ link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pydehkj.png ), 
  it was posted by the press office twitter account , taken down very quickly afterwards . 
  link was up as of 5 minutes ago , now is down it seems . 
  it 's part faith , part statement that they 're backing him . 
  those are huge shoes to fill , he 'll need all the support . 
  barthez should n't be in this . 
  vds - yes , barthez of all people , fuck no . 
  forlan and blanc there but missing liam miller ? 
  oh he is there , we just ca n't see him , right !, 
  is this page even real ? 
  i know berbatov is really using his one , but this one looks fake as fuck . 
  500k likes , on rvp , like really ? 
  he stopped using his twitter around the time he signed for us , really doubt he would switch to facebook somehow . 
  ~ ~ i call fake . ~ ~, 
  oh , carry on then !, 
  he is one of the very few , if not the only united player i really despise . 
  ca n't really explain why , because it 's not exactly rational , but i really ca n't stand him . 
  and i 'll always blame him for those 3 ronaldo goals . 
  should 've saved at least 2 of them . 
  no press conference today , asked around twitter yesterday just to be sure , was confirmed by adam marshall ( of the manutd.com team ) . 
  in a way , it makes sense . 
  ha , i 've been ranting about this for months !, 
  finally sent them an email on the well hidden enquiries@manutd.co.uk address , which is supposed to be handling such things , but i expect fuck all to happen . 
  we do and it suddenly started behaving like a proper official account the last few days !, 
  oh sweet summer child , there is nothing like good old gay british heavy metal ( tm ), 
  he is still in charge for the last two games , 
  already does n't feel like a title celebration . 
  probably will get better as the game progresses and we get more distracted with the play , but blimey , what a strange , strange week . 
  once you get emotionally entangled with certain team , it stops to matter for how long you have been like that . 
  every win is a celebration till the next one , every defeat is hurting you physically , every news about your team needs ot be hunted down , every little detail matters , everyone supporting your team is your mate and there are the ` enemies ' around . 
  once you 're a fan does n't matter if it started yesterday or 25 years ago , you just are . 
  either you care or you do n't - and if you do , you ca n't half care , you 're all in . 
  the thing that might change with time is perspective , opinion on players , improvement of knowledge about the traditions of the club , understanding the local region where the club was found , all these and more - but being a fan , being a fan never changes . 
  [ away keeper 's goal kick you say ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd_sua0an4c ), 
  always hated text-speak or whatever that leet typing with numbers is supposed to be called , so i 'm all for ** champions 20 | 13 ** and getting rid of the champ20s thing . 
  bonus : [ leet comic ] ( http://megatokyo.com/strip/9 ), 
  yeah . . no . 
  let 's all laugh at citeh , let 's all laugh at citeh !, 
  love the rafael tshirt :d, 
  this was posted just 2 days ago mate . 
  hockey . 
  he needs to hockey . 
  you !, 
  i like you . 
  rio is either baked or pissed :d really love him !, 
  saf `` tomorrow night our u21s play liverpool , that mob across the road '', 
  oh man , oooh fergie we love you !, 
  \\ #scenes, 
  brilliant moment !, 
  not at all random !, 
  the pics posted from that account kinda prove it , but yeah , needs rio to officially approve it :d, 
  [ moyes is there !, 
  q : what will you miss about this club ? 
  paul scholes : `` everything really '' . 
  kinda wonder what 's passing through rooney 's head right now , really . 
  helen ( i think ? ), 
  was really good and `` subtle '' about it :d, 
  you 're actually , probably right . 
  never thought about it that way . 
  still a dick , 
  i was in shambles last couple of days , that parade actually lifted me up pretty well . 
  it was fun while it lasted with saf , we now have to simply . . go on . 
  all the right people are there already . 
  brilliant !!, 
  thanks !, 
  atta boy, 
  while this is a valid opinion , many others have argued that his suspension for the 2009 final is the thing that cost us another cl cup . 
  i agree with them - fletcher 's role in midfield was pretty much what carrick is doing and it took 3 full seasons for most ( not all ! ), 
  people to realize how important that is . 
  slayer . 
  yes please !, 
  the way they 're handling it is different of course , carrick has superior to probably everyone positioning therefore does n't need to resort to last-second tackles and winning the ball back the hard way , he is usually there to intercept the initial pass . 
  fletch on the other hand is doing a lot of running , if he ca n't intercept the pass , he will catchup with the opposition player and try to take the ball away . 
  probably that 's why he was catching the eye more often , because that is much more spectacular then being in the right time at the right place . 
  i 'm just theorizing of course , i do n't even play football so i might be completely wrong . 
  i do n't know man , just look at the difference when we ca n't resort to using carrick in midfield . 
  i actually have about an hour of battery life left at the remote office . 
  come on you young reds , smash that mob across the street !, 
  edit : question , anyone managed to get any of these streams running on android ? 
  pelanty !!, 
  goal !,
