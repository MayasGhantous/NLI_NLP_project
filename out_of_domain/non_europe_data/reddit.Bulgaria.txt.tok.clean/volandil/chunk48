  variations of it were thrown around on twitter when it was kind obvious it would be moyes , even without it being officially announced . 
  first i 've seen on my timeline to throw in a variation of ` cum on feel the noize ' was [ @utdrantcast ] ( https://twitter.com/utdrantcast ) but could 've been a coincidence . 
  great job with the editing !, 
  great video too , 
  and are still protected from prosecution, 
  the online version is pretty limited , but they 're showing most u21s and u18s games live at least . 
  it 's total shit compared to the full programme of course . 
  the idea is so absurd , i had to check twice that it 's not the onion , but i guess it 's just me . 
  cheers !, 
  interesting , but i do n't understand why the extra man from wide aiding the bodies in the middle is being lauded as something new and groundbreaking . 
  saf has been using this tactic ever since evra joined the club . 
  our left `` winger '' has been on the wing only in defense . 
  in attacking formation , whoever is playing in there is moving closer to the center of the midfield , dragging/occupying at least one defender/midfielder from the opposition team with him , openning space for the lb to go one on one with their fullback . 
  that 's why young is usually effective there , because he does n't depend on crossing with his left ( weaker ) foot at all . 
  shooting on the other hand , is perfect with the right foot from the left of the goal . 
  using one of the strikers to ` fall back ' into midfield and add another exta body in there has also been used a lot . 
  ca n't wait for the cl group stage opponents to be announced . 
  europe and shit, 
  wait to visit an away game and have a whole day of like minded people singing and drinking around a foreign city . 
  it 's unforgettable . 
  ca n't stop laugh at that, 
  make that microtransactions and you 're ready for ea or blizzard career, 
  oh sweet summer child ... 
  bollocks mate . 
  ` power happy mods ' is the last thing this subreddit has . 
  sometimes , just sometimes , a popular post is against the guidelines . 
  so what , big deal . 
  yeah , i 'm mulling buying the plane tickets already to get them cheaper , pretty confident i 'll get a ticket , but still kinda hesitant to book the non-refundable ( cheapest ) tickets . 
  i guess i could wait till 24th and they would n't be much more expensive , but still ... 
  we had similar situation around here , blue seemed to have disappeared from the city at all , aside of some small islands of 3 or 4 close to each other lvl 7 and 8 portals . 
  nothing happened for a month or two and suddenly 6 high level blue players swept half the city . 
  looks like they 've been stockpiling the whole time . 
  it 's much more even now , but we 'll paint it green again . 
  of course . 
  there are so many open wifis here , you 'll spent at most 500 mb for the month !, 
  nothing in mine yet :(, 
  just got the text !, 
  see ya there , 
  just curious , if they 're public tweets , why the sign in ? 
  now it makes sense , thanks !, 
  i 'm sorry , but this is the lamest excuse i 've seen . 
  we 've been protesting for 20 days now ( today is the 21st ) . 
  everyday , after work . 
  if a bunch of bulgarians can do it , i 'm sure everyone can . 
  good point . 
  but i do n't see ( m ) any protests in the big us cities as well . 
  it 's not work hours , distance or whatever excuse you can think of that is causing the lack of protests . 
  it 's just that you have n't had enough yet . 
  maybe i have n't had enough coffee yet , but i fail to see how is this related ? 
  why does it matter what size is the government , if it 's not doing the right thing ? 
  why does it matter how many people are employed , if the general direction taken by those in charge is wrong ? 
  not strictly a transfer story , but moyes ' first press conference will be tomorrow , 4pm bst . 
  i should be around for it , if there is none till 15:50 bst ( that would mean the work gnomes have kidnapped me and i could n't escape ) feel free to create one . 
  so far , / u/fallark , / u/d1794 and / u/rb1011 have volunteered to create it so yeah , there definitely will be one . 
  do n't cross the streams !!, 
  got a bit distracted , was that paddy that said it ? 
  nope , unfortunately not . 
  i 'm just collecting stuff from the website , twitter and streams and putting them all in one place . 
  all hail bebe !, 
  all hail bebe !, 
  all hail bebe !, 
  the new defender we got a month ago . 
  judging by twitter , it is , 
  nani are you ok ?!, 
  are you ok ?!, 
  are you ok nani !!? 
  you 've been hit by , ugh , you 've been struck by the smooth footballer . 
  ( cue music ), 
  you 're welcome , 
  i would n't mind !, 
  thanks for doing this !, 
  pretty much all my spare time is consumed by the anti-government protests here and completely missed the press conference :(, 
  look at you two , getting along and everything !, 
  today marks ** protest day 30 ** . 
  and yeah , it 's not getting much coverage unfortunately . 
  we 've managed to keep it peaceful and clean so far , which is great for our spirit , but is also allowing the government to ignore us completely . 
  their ` sponsors ' also own half the press here and one of the major tv stations , you can imagine what kind of a infowar we 're facing . 
  the lack of blood and tear gas also does n't make it very much newsworthy outside of bulgaria , there have been little snippets in euronews and bbc and that 's all so far . 
  you can check the #\u0414\u0410\u041d\u0421withme hashtags on [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/%d0%b4%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%81withme ) , [ twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23%d0%94%d0%90%d0%9d%d0%a1withme&amp;src=hash ) and [ flickr ] ( http://flickr.com/search/?q=%23\u0414\u0410\u041d\u0421withme ) to get a quick look at what 's up . 
  yep , the bbc article is correct , that appointment started it , however after they withdrew it , the shady appointments in less visible areas continued . 
  there are also some strange decisions on energy and gas projects , which nobody cares to explain to the public . 
  the protests have meanwhile evolved and now want the resignation of the government and new elections . 
  the president speech was good boost for us , but he is more like an international figure , he does n't have real political power . 
  here are some good articles on the subject :, 
  [ euronews ] ( http://euronews.com/2013/07/06/who-are-the-bulgarian-protesters/ ), 
  [ economist ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21580522-new-government-looks-unlikely-last-long-noresharski-noligarchy?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/noresharski_noligarchy_ ), 
  and my favourite little post : [ from storify ] ( http://storify.com/saaabina/10-reasons-bulgaria-s-withme-protests-are-glorious ) you can even see me on page two , chapter 9 with the troll sign , 
  hello [ match thread ] , been awhile !, 
  approximately an hour and 10 minutes as of now, 
  [ me , reading this ` news ' ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5871obaz21ry10fwo1_500.gif ), 
  this is so gorgeous !, 
  only if we put you on a diet , 
  good to see 3 kids from the academy combine for the second goal , 
  combine with a shot for ` deary me ' to cut it down to 15 minutes, 
  in february there is a good chance that there will be a champions league game played as well . 
  so keep that in mind too,
