  [ the green hills of earth ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_green_hills_of_earth ), 
  i am one of the few people that actually enjoy massive amounts of tone mapping in hdr  have an upvote, 
  that 's just the config file for magic and the mandatory magic mime , which mimics whatever magic does ( that 's why deaf people can use computers ) . 
  actual magic resides in / usr/sbin/magicd which is of course - a daemon . 
  so when the daemon gets started , or should i say , summoned , the magic mime , draws a pentagram around it , so it can not escape . 
  if the pentagram is poorly drawn , the daemons try to escape and you get a glimps of it when the screen turns blue with white letters . 
  blue is * the * magic color after all . 
  funny factoid , me and my friends always had that joke that the musical style of ` bon jovi ' is happy metal :d \\ m / rok on !, 
  it 's simple - you need to burn more mine then you craft, 
  i like this, 
  i want a 1920x version of this .

  also , what he said, 
  revenge buttseks is teh best, 
  [ he dropped hints in the past ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qq6xoragwm ), 
  that is a valid point , and when arguing and discussing religion i 'm more of the asshole-like , attacking , rude type of atheists , but when you are just fanatically yelling at people all the time , you do make the whole look bad . 
  and yeah , i would say , the example conversation in the screencap up is not really good example . 
  awesome, 
  looks funny , someone needs to poke the guy making the comics to support an english version , 
  my spare time for the last 2 days and nights has been filled with watching this . 
  thank you !, 
  freedom fighter stallman or some dnd reference, 
  funny , i have completely forgotten about that one :d, 
  yeah , i was suspecting something like that . 
  best jokes are exactly like this , unfortunately for us , foreigners . 
  alternatively , how hard can finish be ? 
  i mean , come on , 
  oh you . 
  you !, 
  parent should be top comment, 
  yeah , they blew me , it was n't half bad :-), 
  the million whores march to follow in protest, 
  sun-ring is the real name of a popular korean e-sports player . 
  do you know his game nickname ? 
  protip : did n't do too well last year . 
  well , the article author is working for oprah . 
  ooh , great one , just before a storm eh ? 
  * facedesk *, 
  seconded, 
  the sad and funny part about it is , it was meant as a satire . . * sigh *, 
  probably gon na be buried deep , deep down , but i 'll ask anyway . 
  in my recent discussions with creationists , their most commonly used argument was something in the lines of ` information can not appear from nowhere ' or ` information this , information that ' , let 's call it ` information theory ' . 
  can you try to predict what would be their next ` big argument ' ? 
  a very , very underappreciated comics , 
  i 'll second dem .

  you were listening to lulz : a corruption of lol . 
  what do i win ? 
  oh , also : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3sjb2tcojy , 
  i 've read here and there that it 's mostly used to get rid of old `` dead '' sperm and replenish with new , lively one . 
  it was some movie/article about the giant balls squirrels, 
  jaw , dropped, 
  the name in the url gives out a hint too many, 
  funny thing that , faith and stuff . 
  i have pushed myself into the irrational believe that i can change stuff , which seemed unchangeable . 
  i have learned my self to believe the very impossible things to make myself a better person . 
  i have even tattooed ` believe ' on me , as part of that experience , yet , i 've never really needed an omnipotent supernatural being to justify that faith . 
  what i did all that knowing very well that i 'm pushing my self to believe the impossible , just to take that extra step forward . 
  i believe i 'm a better person now , because of all that , i also think i understand faith 's mechanisms much better . 
  but that 's a silly excuse , and it 's just that - an excuse . 
  now , dust up , get your shit together and go on with your fight . 
  make your own chances , stop waiting for them . 
  it 's good that people here are mentioning guilt , because that 's what churches are selling . 
  you need to be guilty , you need to feel dirty , no good , a little useless , so they can sell you their salvation . 
  easiest route for that is to make you feel bad for the most basic things , eating , fucking , loving . 
  so , why were you searching for fbi ? 
  you . 
  yes , yes , you . 
  you made me google that . 
  thank you . 
  repost , die in a orbital fire, 
  no dude , we went too far . 
  woah . 
  and just in time , 
  congrats , looks awesome !, 
  look at the future , now look at me , look at the future , back to me . 
  it is only logical \\ \\ / /, 
  come out of closet, 
  funny how in neither post roger zelazny is mentioned . 
  he has a good ability to ` explain ' the magic stuff used in his books . 
  thumbnail suggests picture is from a rammstein concert . 
  is not . 
  i fuckin love the cathedratank . 
  oh wow , i 'm such a sucker for tattooed chix with a body like this . 
  you 're gorgeous , moar !, 
  might not be really funny or whatever , but ... 
  i 've never really understood that problem . 
  i mean , yeah , i understand insecurities and jealousy and i know for fact those things exist , however i never managed to comprehend people like that . 
  do you find her attractive - yes or no , it 's that simple . 
  that illogical jump to ` if you like him/her , then you do n't like me ' is so , so absurdly ignorant . 
  the comments section on that video is scary . 
  of course it does n't count . 
  there is that ` thou shalt not kill ' part as well , but it 's not relevant to heretics and enemies of god apparently .
