  never heard of him , but i have to admit i like the song . 
  what 's the problem with him , one of simon cowell 's products ? 
  jesus this is entertaining as hell . 
  yeah he has a punchable face , but the guy can play guitar !, 
  ah , fair enough :-), 
  come on !, 
  * yellow star with a sign ` you tried ' appears in the room and fades away *, 
  just because it sounds so stupid , i would guess yeah . 
  your body is ready ? 
  i was n't aiming at girls to be honest , thou i see it might not be clear . 
  people are stupid , similar stupid excuse has been probably used by men . 
  have n't made it to a domestic game away yet , but the euro away crowd is something special . 
  they 're all crazy fuckers drinking too much of course , but there is a real feel of brotherhood and acceptance as ` one of our own ' if you can make it for the trip . 
  the further the trip , the bigger the admiration i 've noticed . 
  bucharest , cluj , amesterdam and madrid - had the best time ever . 
  and yeah , amsterdam and madrid do stand out . 
  anyone that has a chance to get to even one away game , do it . 
  it will be worth it . 
  loaned ? 
  i really think you 're underestimating his importance in big games and his abilities as well . 
  hey , that 's my blog :d, 
  edit :, 
  alright , let 's talk ` must hear ' music and bands from the greater manchester area . 
  i 'm really digging inspiral carpets and doves for some reason . 
  joy divison - depending on the mood i 'm in , but i guess that really goes for most of the ` new wave ' bands . 
  what other good bands are from the region ? 
  * not including the most popular ones like the stone roses , james , kasabian and etc , because they 're obvious *, 
  shows up on ` bacon reader ' as text , not number , so i see a lot of them . 
  my personal game is to try to guess the number , based on the not-so-obvious choices of hover text , 
  good call !, 
  elbow too !, 
  definitely ` the stone roses ' and ` james ' !, 
  also elbow , doves , joy division , inspiral carpets . 
  and as / u/fastantic4 mentioned - the courteeners, 
  thought the carrick one was done by pete boyle , but it did take ages to catch on . 
  once it did - it was awesome thou , 
  nah , too far out for such view , something on chester road/chorley street i think . 
  that 's the south stand you 're looking at . 
  right from the ` well , duh ! ', 
  department, 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9js6osnez6y ( around 29:15 ), 
  because [ slayer . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5er2mc3e8ss ) duh . 
  happy holidays mate !, 
  that 's what i wanted to know most from the presser , but unfortunately the boss decided not to say anything about it . 
  maybe more info will be available tomorrow, 
  he is unspectacular , but can be really useful in the middle . 
  i have n't been able to keep track on his loan progress , so my view on him is a bit outdated . 
  * visit affleck 's palace . 
  * have a glass of rum in cloud 23 in the evening and just look at the manchester lights from above . 
  * go to didsbury 's fletcher moss gardens and take a photo at rory 's bench, 
  * definitely visit mosi ( as someone else suggested ), 
  * have a drink in the brittons protection, 
  * walk around castlefield and the old wall, 
  * walk around bridgewater canal, 
  the person taking the picture , what 's he/she standing on ? 
  please do n't buy ` match-day scarves ' :(, 
  sam platt 's down wharf side is open and much bigger than the bishop 's blaize , i actually prefer it on match day . 
  i would also add the mosi ( museum of science and industry ) to the ` must visit ' places while in mcr . 
  there are no ` match-day scarves ' . 
  they 're just half and half scarves for tourists . 
  they were acceptable for euro games , while those were rare , i can somewhat understand the idea for having them , when there is a big pl club playing a smallish conference or league 2 club , but nowadays , they 're everywhere . 
  i ca n't comprehend the idea of having a half-united/half-city scarf around my neck . 
  they 're aimed at people that go occasionally to a game , maybe one in their lifetime , to hang them on their walls and tell to friends about that one time they went to see united . 
  i 'm sorry , but those people can have much better souvenirs that actually benefit the club they support , instead of the knockoffs sold outside . 
  did you notice it does n't usually say ` manchester united ' on them , it says ` red devils ' or other uncopyrighted stuff . 
  i can go on and on about it , but that 's basically it . 
  i hate them . 
  try / r/reddevils for that . 
   the world ( is going up in flames ) by charles bradley,

  however i do n't think that 's the song, 
  hows life in london ? 
  hope you do n't mind that i dropped my cv as well :-), 
  but i thought it was funny :(, 
  it has that itallian restaurant with the tiny dishes where you can eat 10 things at once . 
  pesto i think ? 
  there was one on deansgate , but they closed it, 
  mate , that 's spanish cuisine , i meant the italian restaurant ... nevermind . 
  wonder how many will cite ` no sex before game ' , 
  it 's tires . 
  some sides of the square are guarded literally by firewalls . 
  south korea h as mandatory military service . 
  usually gets more press and exposure when a famous starcraft player like boxer needs to enter the service .
