  it 's not an easy game . 
  there are so many irish pubs in madrid it 's hard to imagine you ca n't see all the games, 
  how dare he scores !, 
  a small book with poems by a friend of mine , published post-mortem , two years after his suicide . 
  it looks like [ this ] ( http://i5.helikon.bg/products/8580/11/118580/118580z.jpg ), 
  mason 's, 
  big hands !, 
  they do , but still - fuck the international break . 
  it 's called muta stacking, 
  might want to post that also in / r/reddevils, 
  a list of things that people can check would be nice , google docs or something - with you , marking whatever from the list has been obtained . 
  * and better *, 
  yes and no . 
  statistics show that enforcing people to wear helmets leads to less people riding bikes , which leads to more incidents with cyclists . 
  not requiring helmets - more cyclists on the roads , drivers more aware of them , less incidents , less need for helmets . 
  i personally find riding without a helmet to be one of the worst ideas ever , but making them mandatory has it 's drawbacks . 
  i want to buy them . 
  ( the old trafford one would work great for my secret santa match ), 
  just did !, 
  any idea how long it will take for it to arrive ? 
  ( shipping to manchester ), 
  i think we 're always hiring new translators , it 's more like a freelance job , but you can give it a shot :, 
  and now i know someone who works in one of my favourite places in salford quays , 
  i 'm with you on this . 
  the script was horrible , some of the acting - as you said , also horrible . 
  thing that saves it is the visuals and the huge hype about it being scientifically correct as much as possible . 
  too many people do n't want to criticize it , because it 's one of the few films that at least tries to be close to reality . 
  but it was a poor , poor execution imo . 
  it 's getting closer and closer to my driving test and i keep trying to get in the opposite lane on right turns . 
  * sigh * oh uk , why ca n't you drive on the side the rest of the world drives on ? 
  i 'll be all for that once i pass the test , i promise !, 
  you three need to talk , together , and a lot . 
  not just he said , she said , sit down all 3 of you and talk - about what each of you expects , fears ( ca n't stress this enough ) and is ready to compromise with . 
  sorry i ca n't be of more help . 
  firebox is ukish , jinx , thinkgeek all ship to the uk, 
  electrified at least, 
  not all all . 
  still find it ugly as ever . 
  i really hope adidas manage to convince someone to use a contour kind of logo for next season , i just ca n't see a design happening that will make the full colour version bearable . 
  they 'll laugh while stoning you . 
  why am i reading this in attenboroughs voice ? 
  one of the must see things that you 're lucky to be happening in that period :, 
  ** saturday 20th of december ** - club studio 5 , national palace of culture -, 
  one of my favourite ever bulgarian bands - ** bulgara ** will be performing . 
  they have a unique style combining traditional balkan elements with drum and base . 
  they 're simply amazing and great showmen , all of them . 
  aside of that , couple of places/things to recommend :, 
  nearby mall of sofia there is a small rock/hard rock bar which i simply adore :, 
  [ road 66 ] ( https://foursquare.com/v/road-66/4bbcc39a8a4fb7132a203c9d ), 
  ( it 's not exactly in the theme of music you said you prefer , but it 's a lovely place , so yeah . ), 
  best place for craft beers and general beer adventures is kanaal :, 
  another great place for beers :, 
  [ ale house ] ( https://foursquare.com/v/ale-house/4c0946babbc676b064eb47d5 ), 
  good eating places and general good kitchen , different tastes :, 
  a bit hipsterish , but great food :, 
  a bit more expensive , irish pub , great ribs :, 
  [ j.j. murphies ] ( https://foursquare.com/v/jj-murphys-%d1%81%d0%be%d1%84%d0%b8%d1%8f/4bd4261ecaff95212d3fd6f0 ), 
  that 's what the forks are there for , to keep me crawling , took me awhile to figure out that i need axe for kindling , to find one and pretty much right after i finally had a splint and was able to walk upright someone shot me :d, 
  macros ? 
  lime bar in salford quays , gave my ticket to a colleague for his birthday . 
  feels a bit weird tbh . 
  sounds like a striptease bar, 
  that subreddit gets even weirder when a poly person tries to get an advice , the inability to comprehend poly relationships and yet giving advice after advice, 
  well , driving test on tuesday , then running to work to cover for the rest of the day and wednesday and then 4 days of playing dayz and skyrim without getting out of bed at all . 
  looking forward to it . 
  message me when you 're around manchester !, 
  yeah , extra fun because i 'm used to driving on the other side of the streets and every now and then i try to get into the opposite lane on a right turn , 
  little lupe ( fuentes ) something, 
  hah , which uk city was that ? 
  huh , i kinda assumed there were , interesting , thanks !, 
  seriously ? 
  thanks !, 
  yeah , it 's a first insurance , i 'm new to the country and can never get a quote below 3k from comparison websites . 
  i 'm well above 24 , so i ca n't get a blackbox discount or use marmalade and etc , even thou am i brand new driver ( just got my full license ) . 
  a colleague recommended aviva and using their website i 've managed to narrow it down to couple of brands of cars i can insure for less than 2k , which is great , but seems in the process i managed to get my self blocked from aviva 's website . 
  i did use it a lot and triggered some defence mechanism , just got off the phone with them and they refuse to lift the ban off . 
  you think a broker would help ? 
  someone specific , or just go to a random one in the region ? 
  ah , great thanks , 
  oh yeah , i realise that . 
  i 've been through the different insurance groups and again , there 's sometimes huge difference between companies . 
  same car that get 's quoted 1.9 k on direct line for example , is 1.2 k on elephant . 
  good call , area is pretty new and expensive , so it should n't be a problem , includes secure parks . 
  thanks for the tip !, 
  those i have n't heard of , will check them right away , thanks !, 
  nothing yet , but i 'm mostly looking at small engine 1 - 1.2 l , problem is i have no previous driving experience and zero no claims discount yet . 
  my experience so far is exactly the opposite , direct line , aviva , elephant so far has provided lower quotes, 
  do read [ the better angels of our nature ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11107244-the-better-angels-of-our-nature ) by prof. steven pinker , it 's fascinating . 
  basically , violence worldwide has been on a strong decline and will continue to decline , it 's just that we 're exposed more to it , due to the advanced communications we now have . 
  but the world is getting better each day . 
  so it 's not all so bad . 
  right , so i passed my driving test in december , just received my driving license in the post . 
  now for the complicated matter of finding a car that does n't cost an arm and a leg to insure . 
  wish me luck !, 
  there 's probably an oglaf comic about that, 
  turn off ` terrain ' mode , that 's what fucks it for me, 
  try posting this to / r/reddevils as well, 
  they 'll be in the tattoo fest , that 's happening on the 28th of february , so you can take a look at their and others work i guess ? 
  slipknot + korn at the phones4u arena, 
  the problem is , someone will find your body , chance is that someone is your relative .
