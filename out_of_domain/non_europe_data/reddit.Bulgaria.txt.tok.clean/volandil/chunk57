  and the city itself , i do n't know . 
  i 've been living here for a year and 4 months now and i can say i love it . 
  i think you either `` get it '' and love it , or you never adjust to it . 
  seems that way with everyone around me . 
  haha , we went to one of the coffee shops , but it 's not my thing . 
  tried half a space cake ( well , muffin ) but as with joints , it just does n't work on me . 
   at least you van say you went to amsterdam and sampled some of the local produce though !, 
  and had some great spanish tapas at joselito !, 
  a man said to the universe :, 
  `` sir , i exist ! '', 
  used it in town and abroad ( amsterdam and sofia ), 
  big fan , prices are more than fine if you avoid ` surge ' periods , you do n't have to deal with cash and look for atms . 
  and i 'm big fan of the rating system , the idea that you rate the driver but they also rate you as a customer - if two of them give you low rating , many of the drivers will ignore you altogether . 
  true , that 's the backup plan , but it would be better if the ticket goes to someone who would enjoy the gig thou . 
  you have it then , 
  edit :, 
  but seriously , lots have changed since then , pretty much most of it - positive !, 
  * hugs *, 
  for hard rock and metal stuff - rock it, 
  for jazzy stuff , depending on the evening , sofia live club , studio 5, 
  for great selection of craft beers : kanaal , beer garden praga or ` halbite ', 
  for dance - culture beat is nice , but it 's not my kind of music and others will be able to give better advice . 
  i know , right ? 
  yeah , the cunts . 
  we were . 
  stretty was loud through the whole game , it does n't transalate well on tv , because of microphone positioning and the way the roof of stretty bounces back the sound , but it was a loud game . 
  it 's the last home game of the season ffs , of course we were loud and bouncing . 
  arsenal fans were asleep for most of the game , they finally woke up when they equalized and fair play , they were loud then . 
  edit :, 
  if it 's not clear , i was standing in stretford end and i probably have a good idea if we were singing or we were not . 
  downvoting me , or any opinion that disagrees with yours will not make that headline true , but if that 's what makes you happy - you 're welcome . 
  ah , heres a video from stretty, 
  and this one :, 
  does it come off as a dickish comment ? 
  hm , not my intention at all really , all i 'm saying is that every comment that tries to explain that yes , indeed the united fans were chanting the whole time is downvoted . 
  i even provided videos recorded from stretford end here : http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/36aecg/louis_van_gaal_struggles_to_give_a_speech_to_the/crctiqg so you can judge for yourself . 
  probably it 's the remark that the arsenal fans were very quiet till they scored ? 
  well , sorry , but that 's the truth . 
  they were very loud after that , you could see and hear they were enjoying it , but for the first 50-60 minutes they were n't making any significant noise . 
  oh , i 'm sure they were singing the whole time , i ca n't even imagine away crowd that would just sit and chew on their hot dogs or whatever . 
  just that tv can sometimes misrepresent the amount of noise on a stadium . 
  stretford end , especially the second tier is a very loud place , but not a lot of the sound reaches the other side of the stadium , because the roof bounces it back to the stand . 
  when we played bayern in 2014 , my ears were ringing after the game for a good 30 minutes . 
  one of the loudest i 've ever seen old trafford , but - when i watched the report later , none of that amazing atmosphere in the stretty made it into the report - you could hear some chants , you could feel the fans were there and having a go at it , it just did n't feel amazing at all on tv . 
  anyway , that 's now irrelevant, 
  denis law agrees, 
  yeah , like in watergate gate, 
  \\* crickets \\*, 
  yep , same here . 
  what i do remember is the parts where he said ` everyone screams for help in their native language ' . 
  that 's something that really made impression in my infant mind . 
  yes !, 
  pm 'd, 
  bastards :d, 
  cheerio , let me know if that changes !, 
  you 're right , the flight de4710 is manchester to mallorca, 
  as / u/bellrott said further down - it 's an arrivals board in mallorca . 
  de4710 according to google is manchester to mallorca ,, 
  4u9586 is a german wings flight to mallorca, 
  that 's a typical case of a ` full kermit ' confirmed , yes . 
  and you gon na believe us , and now you 're gon na believe us ,, 
  we 'll sue the fucking world ,, 
  we 'll sue the fucking world . 
  how can i possibly introduce you to the manager ? 
  and she was put on probation after that , hah . 
  i would love a trip to fucking brugges for a cl game . 
  you have n't seen the russia 's foreign ministry statement then ? 
  green light motorcare were reasonable and worked ok for me :, 
  a bit further away , but was recommended by numerous uber and cab drivers is brantingham autos in longsight , postcode : m13 0lf ( https://plus.google.com/110493705209624246829/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en ),

   original music by nick martel , dan gauthier and ray balberman, 
  / r/brookemarks /, 
  there is very little in the books about the white walkers . 
  the show is miles ahead in that regard . 
  so yeah , it 's just a guess . 
  i 'll be happy if they just start using the e-passport gates again for a start really . 
  but yeah , in seriousness , great news . 
  they usually just post the sim cards via post , so not sure if that will be useful for a tourist . 
  ah , did n't know that , thanks !, 
  [ cheers for that !,

  i bet promo things will just fly off his hands, 
  old trafford being the other one ? 
  sense8 !, 
  you probably need to be added to the group : https://www.facebook.com/groups/646692615380573/, 
  i 'm really curious about how it will turn out , i 've watched the original swedish series `` real humans ( \u00c4kta m\u00e4nniskor ) '' and it was fun . 
  have n't seen the first episode of the uk version yet , really looking forward to catching up with that tonight . 
  only feel i can comment on is the hazmat suits . 
  i think they 're using them mostly as disguise and an excuse . 
  even if some bystander sees them , they can always say - sorry , we had to clean the area , there was an infection going on , blah blah . 
  would n't need to explain any body bags or people carrying what looks like corpses . 
  welcome to the club !, 
  loved it . 
  as for the rest of the series , well , you 're in for a ride , it gets even better . 
  also : / r/sense8, 
  i do n't know , it builds up and builds up and i would definitely give episode 3 a go if i were you , but that 's just my 2 cents . 
  * sigh * if only kyoto lounge was still open :(, 
  it 's still just june mate , chill . 
  i fuckin ' miss them counter goals, 
  lutenitsa is awesome .
