  saw the same jar as in the all time upvoted post , and so bought it without really knowing what to expect , but i want some more . 
  well , theres that : http://i.imgur.com/5gyy4fd.jpg, 
  nationwide i believe . 
  where in the uk are you based ? 
  there are a few bg shops in london and one in manchester ( eccles ) ? 
  they played together for aston villa , 2 or 3 seasons maybe ? 
  so not really that surprising , is n't it ? 
  yeah . . but he does have access to some insider information . 
  craig is a freelancer photographer , he is being hired often by newspapers when they have insider information that a deal will happen soon . 
  that shot with degea hiding behind the blanket was his i believe . 
  oh , do n't get me wrong , i definitely agree this is a bollocks thing to post to reddit . 
  looks like it 's not just victoria thou : http://redd.it/3bypmf ( of course , it could be a coincidence . ), 
  it makes sense that / r/reddevils does n't join the mass closure of subreddits , but i do n't think we 're that disconnected from what 's happening . 
  issues have been surfacing every now and then . 
  i think it 's obvious there is a shift in the direction reddit is going and that there is a huge rift between where community or maybe old time users want it to be and where management wants it to go . 
  not sure how it will all end , on one hand , we have the ` digg v4 ' example how quickly a community driven project can dissapear , on the other hand , no matter how incompetent we might perceive management to be , they must have weighted the risks . 
  my personal 2 pennies - admins are in damage control mode , willing to promise anything to diffuse the situation , the way / r/pics and / r/books have opened again minutes after the announce is a very bad example , how easily empty promises can diffuse the situation . 
  if the users of the site really want to have their voices heard , they 'll have to be more persistent and they 'll have to make little sacrifices , even when it does n't seem to be relevant to their interests . 
  - the drama with jailbait , the fappening , fatpeoplehate and other subreddits . 
  ( not saying whatever content they had was legitimate , or that they did n't deserve closure , just not agreeing with the way in it was handled . ), 
  he means we 've no idea what you 're talking about, 
  ah . . based on the great book by the strugatski brothers . 
  you know , if you just posted that it 's your birthday and would like to have a pint with someone in the facebook group , instead of trying to get money for it , you might have met likeminded and funny people and had good time . 
  so , let me get this straight . 
  `` bollocks '' is bad , whereas `` the dogs bollocks '' is good , huh ? 
  do n't be a dick mate . 
  do it . 
  i 'm pretty sure vidic still has red cards nightmares from these games, 
  ah , found the redhat guy . 
  \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e : http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=1011268, 
  do n't just look for something similar , look for something good but different :, 
  slipknot , fear factory , rammstein , shinedown , enter shikari , trivium all good stuff , 
   here , you will reach a crucial stage , where you 've to pick to go either old-school rock , old-school progressive , new age progressive or melodic/melodeath , or even power metal . 
  or you know , just listen to stuff and play whatever he likes ? 
  just finished daemon and freedom by daniel suarez , good , modern cyberpunk . 
  a bit too preachy sometimes , not as subtle as gibson , but still enjoyable . 
  listening to . . hmm , new oomph !, 
  is out , so yeah , mostly that !, 
  there is oxfam on oldham street as someone already said and there are also ` drop off ' bins for old clothes in the tkmaxx in the arndale, 
  sandinista 's quiz is also on sunday, 
  about fucking time !, 
  stretty second tier , w3105, 
  i see you 've already got yourself sorted , but for smaller airports like the one in sofia you should n't worry , just go to the checkin desk and they 'll reissue it . 
  3rd , after heinze . 
  [ because he is a twat . 
  think currently telenor 's goweb prepaid is the best option . 
  they show sports there ? 
  did n't even notice any screens last time i went , nice !, 
  i just found me a place to watch the game tonight then !, 
  blind did pretty good in the air on couple of occasions against kane in the opening game . 
  [ indeed . 
  ca n't disagree more . 
  for me , his choice of words and sentences helps me read quickly and get deep into his world , my focus on what 's happening , not on the words used . 
  in contrast , david mitchell for example , uses so many heavy words and sentences , it makes me stop reading too often , just to ponder what did he want to say really and i lose rhythm and i need to start again from the beginning of the sentence . 
  for me at least , when telling a story , sometimes it 's better to keep it simple . 
  or it might be that just i 'm not a native english speaker . 
  also , yeah , / r/iamverysmart is that way, 
  that would depend on you including a generalization to all of / r/fantasy needing to realize something only you grasp . 
  like above . 
  - we are definitely closer to the rest of the balkans culturally , even if we would n't be happy to admit it , but hey , every nation thinks they 're greater than their neighbors . 
  there is some russia , or more like ussr nostalgia present at large , due to years of conditioning and propaganda , but i hope it disappears soon . 
  - yes , we can mostly understand it , some of the bulgarian dialects from the eastern part of the country are really a mix between bulgarian and serbian . 
  there are words that are different , but you can get an idea of what the other person is trying to say . 
  as a side note - everything macedonians say sounds just so funny !, 
  - we 're in the balkans , period . 
  as in , take stoke and fill it with millwall 's hooligans . 
  s a r s wait , that 's not that !, 
  overplayed is an understatement mate, 
  reavers !, 
  or blackburn ... 
  eeh . . 
  i do n't see tourists leaving the game 10 minutes before the end to `` beat the traffic '' to be honest , it 's always the moaning local/localish folk . 
  on the other hand , them half and half scarves , yuck .

  edit :, 
  * sigh * guess nobody liked ` the leftovers ' around here . 
  there are too many of us, 
  in tiny houses here and there, 
  all looking through the windows, 
  on everything we share, 
  `` sofia ai n't a night city '' wtf ? 
  check @mufc_tickets on twitter , should be farely easy to get a ticket on face value for the group stage, 
  you can sign up here as well : http://www.capitatranslationinterpreting.com/work-us/, 
  somewhat recommended reading order, 
  with you there . 
  unless it 's united of course , then they suddenly start handing out suspensions for red cards in a friendly . 
  it 's huge outside of the uk , in bulgaria for example , people are using groups in facebook to facilitate the orders of 20-30 people together to cut on the shipping costs . 
  most offices with more than 30 employees would have an internal mailing list to collect the orders for the next shipment and would ship it to the office address . 
  it would , if wwe allowed knifes, 
  classic would be a tracksuit bottom with leather jacket and white socks . 
  sometimes they might omit the leather jacket . 
  yeah i 'm in , should be back in town around 5:30 pm . 
  might want to post that to the fb group thou , might be a bit easier to organize, 
  oh , and happy cake day,

  as cliche as it sounds , always did . 
  but then again , also rated tunnicliffe and larnell , so theres that . 
  short term you might just try airbnb, 
  yeah , your budget is more than enough for that type of flat .
