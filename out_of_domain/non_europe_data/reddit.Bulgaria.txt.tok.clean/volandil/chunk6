  ` crouching neckbeard , hidden camera ' must be one of the most brilliant puns i 've read here . 
  bravo , sir , bravo .

  i would have to downvote you sir , you 're not really contributing anything to the site that guy is browsing . 
  \u266c \u266a burn motherfucker , burn .

  great , now i feel very bad about missing on this one back then :(, 
  same here , loved it and that got me into reading more vonnegut . 
  it 's complicated really , i can tell you , but then i 'll have to kill you . 
  you do realize that you got the number because you asked , not because you bulked up or something ? 
  lies , damn lies !, 
  you copy pasting me ? 
  ooh , i remember this one , was one of the first sci-fi tv series to be broadcasted on tv in post-communist bulgaria . 
  we had only blake 's 7 and captain power before that . 
  funny thing , looking at the cast now , there is a certain ` traci lords ' listed , interesting . 
  somehow reminds me of ` war of the worlds ' much more , but yeah , the v reference i get now , could n't back then . 
  hear hear !, 
  upvoting for a valid question , i 've read some \u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 and ca n't make the connection . 
  i know redditfu . 
  i can downvote in the jerkix, 
  preach on brother , praaaisee the void, 
  you can now tell her about the orgies and the uber-sikrit handshake . 
  i 'm kinda curious on what is this ` hi-tech ' christian stuff .

  i hereby request this to be turned into hilarious comic . 
  thank you . 
  ^ should be top comment . 
  * on a side note , the sample size seems a bit tiny . 
  while you do have a point , i can assure you gay-hatred is not trademarked by religion . 
  both extreme left and right wings of nationalism tend to be very anti-gay . 
  in less religious countries ( like the former communist ones ) , anti-gay feelings can be very strong , without any religious foundation . 
  take the last gay pride in serbia for example . 
  careful , last i heard blasphemy is crime in poland . 
  i like the ` for life ' part .

  one of the few good christmas movies ( imho ), 
  the 4th panel is from the [ `` walking dead '' ] ( http://bit.ly/cvksnt ), 
  same guy plays in both ( andrew lincoln ), 
  when they go on about the relation with seasons ( many of them do ) i ask them why is the zodiac not reversed in the southern hemisphere . 
  not a single answer to that so far :(, 
  damn , i thought the style looked familiar , something i 've seen recently , but i would 've never guessed ' i pooped a little ' . 
  kudos , well deserved upvotes , and i like your sense of humor . 
  edit :, 
  [ shit , is this yours too ? 
  i 'm laughing my ass out , right now . 
  how , how can you spell trapped correct , and use ` their ' , how ? 
  oh well , at least you did n't mistake rapping , 
  then who was [ ] ( / rtroll `` digg ? '' ), 
  karma and/or rebirth are more common in eastern religions , hindu , buddism for example . 
  christianity does not allow karma and/or rebirth .

  funny factoid , mom used to work in one of the ` meat plants ' as they used to call them here . 
  i visited her there many times , the earliest i can remember must be somewhere at my 5th year . 
  all i remember is the stench . 
  the place stank . 
  never really got any issues with eating meat , although her colleagues showed me most of the ` manufacturing ' process . 
  i do n't want to sound creepy or anything , but i 'll follow you . 
  downvoted for lack of humour . 
  nice save , 
  oh cut it already , this is / r/atheism and maher can be very very relevant .

  i too hate his anti-big-pharma idiotics , but please , the topic is different right now . 
  seconded , do tell . 
  you 'll be surprised , 
  i thought oglaf are by default nsfw and marked explicitly sfw , in the rare occasion ,
