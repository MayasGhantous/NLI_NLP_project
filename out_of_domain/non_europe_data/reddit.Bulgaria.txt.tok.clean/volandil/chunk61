  could n't find one posted , so here it is . 
  another one , earlier in the van flight : http://i.imgur.com/twv1jfk.jpg, 
  totally - when everyone was expecting them to fly over the van , boom , van flies :d, 
  you ... 
  you clicked , alan , you clicked on one of them :(, 
  he has been a club ambassador for couple of years now , hes regulary on mutv and seems to be an all around fun guy , 
  [ luilin , sofia ( bulgaria ) ] ( http://img.photo-forum.net/site_pics/169/e_1235655947_dsc01959.jpg ), 
  it has payload . 
  and i do n't want to exaggerate here , but that is the best novel ever written . 
  and just like every other october for the last 20ish years - i `` m rereading it again , one chapter a day . 
  good luck , but better take this to / r/reddevils, 
  were n't they just shot ? 
  they might not need to fake anything ? 
  i still do n't get it ? 
  but of course , thanks !, 
  ot is always bouncing after a defeat - the game after basel kicked us out of the cl few years back , was amazing in terms of atmosphere . 
  it is - at work there are about 3 city fans , 30 united fans and the rest do n't care about footy at all . 
  oh , and one liverpool fan that 's actually from leeds , quite funny . 
  now known as ` feeld ', 
  i totally thought that was gon na be one of the ` hot intelligent women ' posts , but with tentacles . 
  nah , you 're alright, 
  fantastic beasts and where to find them - same universe , different characters, 
  307 cliff drive, 
  and desert installation :, 
  no idea really , i just did a reverse image search and found the articles . 
  how the hell did i miss that , ha !, 
  thanks !, 
  wait , what ? 
   the summer, 
  so - thursday ? 
  the doctor 's skit - stuck ? 
  that 's sooo tim minchin i ca n't imagine it being cut at all :d, 
  except salford . 
  looks like it 's global : http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-cyber-idukkbn1881ti, 
  enterprise do n't have such requirement - https://enterprise.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8473/~/what-are-the-driving-license-requirements-when-renting-in-europe%3f-%28uk%2c-germany%2c, 
  what ? 
  i 've never seen anything paid in feeld , i would give them money to be honest , just so the creators get some revenue and continue to develop it . 
  the story , the facts , they 're all explained and told in a very intriguing way , but what really stood out for me was the real life characters of the scientists . 
  what i loved most about that book was the way he is demythologising all the greats - newton , looking for hidden meaning and numbers in the bible , einstein being opposed to the theory of tectonic plates - it just makes them so much more human , great in their field , but just as bad as each of us in the fields we do n't focus on and just as much products of our time . 
  every fan would seem `` obsessed '' with their main rival , what else is new ? 
  it 's not that there are n't good youth coaches in england , there are - it 's just the way the u21s or u23s ( do n't even know what it 's called now ) league is structured . 
  they 're getting fewer and fewer games , it 's getting less and less competitive and it 's harder for them to develop any ` real world ' skills and composure . 
  the fa has systematically failed to address this in the last few years and the changes that were implemented are so far making it even worse . 
  the people are alright , it 's the monsters they become when they go abroad to do touristy stuff that are the problem . 
  eh . . he is not the club 's photographer , he is freelancing . 
  subreddit ** s ** as in . . multiple ones ? 
  why on earth would there be more than one ?!, 
  ( or even one , huh ), 
  yeah . . 
  i can see that being an issue :d, 
  since i was in your exact situation not too long ago , couple of things that might help :, 
  * go sign up at https://www.internations.org/ - and attend some of the meetups , not everyone you meet at these will be funny or interesting , but they 're all in your situation and there are some locals that attend as well - after awhile you 'll find people to hangout with . 
  * join the r/manchester facebook group : https://www.facebook.com/groups/646692615380573/ and just drop by to one of the meetings , that 's what i did and it was great . 
  * if you 're not already - rent a house or an appartment with someone local , or at least from the uk , that flatmate 's social circle will be including you now and then - and you 'll get to know more people . 
  * of curse , as it has been suggested - there is the meetup page , where you can focus on meeting people with hobbies similar to yours, 
  good luck , it 's a great city and most of the locals are good sports , most of the time . 
  wba really, 
  might be a bit obvious , but i 'm really digging the sweeter rums , 
  how does that work ??? 
  ( in africa ), 
  hypnobbbbbbbzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, 
  drinks own piss . 
  theres gon na be ` sleeping ' flashmob in town soon , seemingly random people will pretend to be asleep fr couple of minutes in public , and then continue as if nothing happened . 
  what funny things should we do to them , while they 're faking their sleep ? 
  i have this supersoaker thing in mind , but noone else likes it , so i decided to look for inspiration . 
  thanks i guess . 
  `` and the sins of the fathers shall be, 
  visited upon the heads of the children ,, 
  even unto the third and fourth, 
  generation of them that hate me . '', 
  well , then i hate thee , unrighteous picture ;, 
  wicked image , i hate thee ;, 
  so , strike with thy vengeance, 
  the heads of those little men, 
  who come blindly . 
  it will be a brave thing . 
  that 's all really , it 's just awesome, 
  that 's all , really . 
  i 'm not sure if many of you have heard of ` peter danov ( \u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0414\u044a\u043d\u043e\u0432 ) ' , but he was a very popular spiritual leader in bulgaria and still have many followers of his ` white brotherhood ' here . 
  ( it 's not a racist organization , they 're just dressing in white ), 
  anyway , there is a famous einstein quote which they really love to cite whenever they can :, 
  ` the whole world bows down before me . 
  i bow before master peter deunov from bulgaria . ', 
  i 've been looking for source , but ca n't find any , unfortunately , i ca n't find a good rebuttal also :(, 
  so , skeptics , can you help with this ? 
  does this quote exist at all in writing somewhere ? 
  is it completely fake , if so - who manufactured it ? 
  the ` whole world bows before me ' sound so fake , i ca n't really picture einstein saying it at all . 
  has he been quoted saying similar stuff ? 
  well , do you ? 
  would he be named hodour ? 
  if someone knowingly scarifies himself , to save others , to save thousands of people , that 's technically a suicide . 
  he should be banished into hell for it . 
  weird shit that . 
  that 's really annoying . 
  after starting and deleting several worlds since 1.8.1 i decided to give hardcore a try . 
  started brand new map , enjoying it so far . 
  spawned in a forest biome , but very close near was a small hill with a ravine going by it . 
  good place to dig in my first shelter and start smelting wood into charcoal .
