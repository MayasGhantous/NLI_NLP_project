  settled well , expanded shelter into a 3 floor house with a lookout ( pictures with view from the lookout ), 
  animal farm , wheat farm and pumpkin farm . 
  have n't found melons yet . 
  quickly reached bedrock , still have n't found an abandoned mine or a dungeon thou . 
  equipped with diamond sword , pick and shovel . 
  so , nothing special , but i 'm so much enjoying this new mode it 's unbelievable . 
  anything that can be done to a rat can be done to a human being . 
  and we can do most anything to rats . 
  this is a hard thing to think about , but it 's the truth . 
  it wo n't go away because we cover our eyes . 
  * this * is cyberpunk . 
  bruce sterling, 
  ... and many people regard him as our saviour . 
  i really hope he can handle the expectations people are putting on his young shoulders . 
  team : amos ; fabio , jones , vidic , fryers , valencia , cleverley , park , diouf , owen , betbatov . 
  subs : de gea , vermijl , will keane , michael keane , pogba , morrison , cole . 
  and a spade recipe . 
  really happy for him and molde , first year as a manager and champion of norway , first ever for the club in their 100 years of history . 
  amazing guy , amazing player and the signs of an amazing manager in the making . 
  love him . 
  i * really * wanted to use that title and not some other !, 
  expected united lineup :, 
  jones , rio , evans , fabio, 
  should be interesting ... 
  and that 's a bad miss . 
  on injuries :, 
  `` we 've got one or two doubts for tomorrow - smalling and jones got knocks in the derby . 
  we 'll see what they 're like tomorrow . 
  anderson got aknock in training but hopefully be okay . 
  in the main i think we 've got a reasonable squad for tomorrow . 
  on facing bolton :, 
  `` any time you play a team that 's down at the bottom , as we experienced against blackburn , you have to address it properly . 
  we need a good performamnce against a team that will be battling for everything tomorrow, 
  on the situation with ravel morrison :, 
  `` his agent has been working hard to get him another club . 
  we 've offered him terms which he has refused . 
  we 've rejected an offer from newcastle . 
  we 'll see how that progresses . 
  his demands are unrealistic as far as we 're concerned . 
  on darron gibson 's departure to everton :, 
  `` it 's a good move for him . 
  he has to get on with his career . 
  he has terrific ability but in terms of the pecking order here he knew he would n't be a first team regular all the time . 
  he missed the opportunity to go to sunderland and i think he regretted that . 
  he 's taken the opportnity to go to everton and i think they need a player like him . '', 
  main updates from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  `` we 're a bit better in terms of injuries . 
  smalling and jones are fit . 
  cleverley and young have done some running which is good . 
  it would be a great boost to have them back - they 're influential players . 
  `` anderson is still a bit short - he got an injury in training last week . 
  `` sunday 's game [ against arsenal ] is the start of a hectic spell for us and i hope we come through the programme well . '', 
  sir alex has just completed his pre-match press conference . 
  on united 's injury problems , he did n't name names but did say he hopes to have `` two or three '' players back training today ahead of tomorrow 's match against liverpool . 
  on the match , he said : `` it 's a massive game for both clubs . 
  there 's a tremendous profile around it . 
  steven gerrard said it 's the responsibility of the players to behave properly and i expect my players to . 
  and also the fans . 
  both sets of fans need to make sure we 're talking about the game and nothing else . '', 
  on how to combat an expected hostile atmosphere : `` you just have to concentrate on the game . 
  that 's what you have to do , just try and play your game . 
  that helps . 
  i think both sets of players are aware of that . '', 
  there was also high praise for danny welbeck and the boss commented on his journey from boy to man : `` when he was 16 he had problems with his knees because he was growing . 
  then he had some thigh problems . 
  it was just a matter of danny developing into a man . 
  he has a great physique about him now but i think there 's still more to come . 
  i do n't think he 's finished . '', 
  hello everyone ,, 
  i already have most of the trip planned and booked , what remains as grey area so far is the period after i pick up my tickets , before the actual kickoff . 
  i 'm with the mufc traveling supporters , but i 'm traveling from a different country and i do n't really know anyone . 
  it 's only my second away game and the first one was generally a rush of running around and no time for pubs . 
  this time i 'm coming a bit earlier and will have some spare time , so ... 
  any idea what pubs the fans will probably be in ? 
  are they downtown , or in/around the stadium ? 
  how safe is it for a united fan to show his colors so to say ? 
  i 've heard some scary stories about the ajax rivalry with feyenoord , does this translate into others teams , or european games are generally safe ? 
  i 'm also staying till monday , so any general tips on ` stuff that 's not in your guide ' are also welcome , i already got some ideas from [ this thread ] ( http://redd.it/or7il ), 
  i 'm generally interested in reason and science , will be skipping the art and madam tussauds museums , they 're just not my type . 
  planning to visit the nemo science center , looks amazing . 
  also looking into the heavy metal/industrial scene , i think i 've liked the ` korsakoff ' so far as a bar and the ` blue bird ' cafe for morning coffee , any better places ? 
  cheers !, 
  just noticed the wiki page and i 'm reading up there for any things i asked that are already answered , i apologize if there are duplicates !,
