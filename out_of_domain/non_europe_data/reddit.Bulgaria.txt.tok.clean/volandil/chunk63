  main points from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  `` we 're a bit better in terms of injuries . 
  i hope rooney , nani , cleverley and young will all be in the squad . 
  rooney and nani have trained for the last two days . 
  it 's more likely tom will play against chelsea reserves on monday but he 'll travel [ on sunday ] . 
  `` it 's not an easy game going to the bridge . 
  we have n't beaten them there [ in the league ] since 2002 . 
  we 're hopeful our form will stand up as it did at arsenal and even last week [ at anfield ] when we put on a good performance and did n't deserve to lose . 
  `` it was a crazy game [ against chelsea ] at old trafford earlier in the season - it could have been 20-18 !, 
  i do n't think it will be like that on sunday . 
  `` de gea should be fit . 
  it looks like lindegaard will be out for at least four weeks , maybe even five or six . 
  it 's ankle ligaments . 
  `` ben amos has been looking for his opportunity for quite a while and we wondered about sending him out of loan . 
  but it 's not easy when you 're in europe - you need three keepers . 
  he did very well the other night . 
  we have tomasz kuszczak as well but his contract is up in the summer and he does n't want to sign another . '',
