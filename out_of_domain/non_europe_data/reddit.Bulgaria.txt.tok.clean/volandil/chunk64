  sir alex 's press conference at carrington has just finished . 
  here are the main points :, 
  * tom cleverley will be involved in some capacity against liverpool tomorrow . 
  `` he 's training well at the moment . '', 
  * chris smalling could also be available , although no other players are expected to retirn . 
  * the liverpool game will come too soon for phil jones but sir alex says he 'll take the young defender to holland next week for the europa league tie against ajax . 
  * on saturday 's liverpool match : `` we expect a hard game tomorrow but i 'm just looking for the sort of performance we 've been showing recently . 
  that should help us . '', 
  i was playing around and came up with [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xsnl1.jpg ) . 
  how about a week or two in which to submit ideas for logo/header image and to have a poll to decide one at the end ? 
  i 'm getting a bit tired with the current one . 
  defenders : evans , rafael , fabio , jones , ferdinand , smalling , fryers . 
  midfielders : valencia , nani , carrick , young , park , scholes , cleverley , pogba . 
  strikers : rooney , hernandez , welbeck . 
  interesting absentees : patrice evra , ryan giggs , dimitar berbatov, 
  * via manutd.com ( today in amsterdam ) and twitter *, 
  `` ryan giggs and dimitar berbatov are injured . 
  we rested patrice evra . 
  it was an emotional weekend for him so i think this is the right thing to do . 
  it 's a strong squad we 've got here . '', 
  sir alex gives more details on the team news : `` ryan got a knock in the first half against liverpool on the ankle and dimitar got an injury in training on sunday . 
  i 've got plenty of options up front with wayne , chicha and danny welbeck . 
  i could also play ashley young off the front or nani through the middle . 
  it was better to leave dimitar behind . 
  it 's not a serious injury - he 'd be available if i asked him to play - but i thought it better not to risk it , so i left him behind . '', 
  sir alex says rio ferdinand will captain united against ajax , in the absence of evra , giggs and of course , vidic . 
  `` bayern and juventus have won all three european tournaments . 
  irrespective of that , it 's important for our own history to win this trophy . '', 
  sir alex : `` we respect all our opponents . 
  we 've taken that lesson from basel . 
  no matter which team you play in europe they 're always capable of producing good players and teams that can worry you . 
  i worry more about ajax 's history than any individual at this moment in time . 
  i respect that history - it 's fantastic they 've retained that philosophy . 
  they play the same style , the same tactics , the same way ... it 's fantastic . '', 
  sir alex : `` when you look at the teams that are in this competition it 's a challenge . 
  there are some very good teams in it but hopefully we 'll do well . 
  `` i think our form is very good at the moment . 
  we 're getting players back , which helps . 
  i will certainly try and play my strongest team in each round now . 
  `` we threw it away against basel in the home game and were unlucky against benfica in the other home game . 
  that caught us short and we suffered for it . 
  now players are coming back and i 'm sure , with the number of players i have , we can combine the league and the europa league . '', 
  sir alex : `` i feel good about being in the europa league . 
  it 's a tournament we 're going to try and win . 
  i think we have a responsibility to do better [ in europe ] than we 've done earlier in the season . 
  that was n't expected but it happens . 
  we have an opportunity now to do better in the second half of the season . '', 
  sir alex on scholes : `` i do n't think there 's any chance of that . 
  ( scholes returning for england ) . 
  it 's hard to describe scholes . 
  honestly ... on saturday he was unbelievable . 
  `` when i told paul last season he could play 25 to 30 games this season , he said that was n't enough . 
  he decided to retire after that - he did n't want to go from being a top player who 's in the team all the time to a player playing only 25 games a season . 
  he was approaching 37 years of age and it 's difficult for players to do that at the top level . 
  i was honest with paul , though , and i told him that if i got 25 games of quality from him i 'd be delighted . 
  `` when he decided to come back i saw no negatives . 
  i was delighted . 
  there could n't be a negative attached to it because he was training really hard in the couple of months before that . 
  he 'd realised he 'd made a mistake . 
  he 's come back refreshed and enthusiastic and he 's his normal self in terms of his training performances . 
  it 's been an amazing turnabout for us in the sense of the order and class he brings to the team . 
  barcelona talk about xavi in the same way we talk about scholes . '', 
  sir alex : `` it was over two months ago that we went out of the champions league . 
  we have so many young players who do n't have much experience of europe , so being in the tournament should be great . 
  there 's a final in romania - they want to be there , i want to be there and our fans want us to be there . '', 
  sir alex is asked about recent matters between united and liverpool . 
  `` i think we 're all delighted we 've put the matter to bed , to be honest with you . 
  the two clubs have too much great history and a great rivalry . 
  that 's what we want to concentrate on . '', 
  via twitter and manutd.com 's `` today at old trafford '' blog . 
  ten minutes in , we get to the main news from the conference : rooney will miss the game . 
  `` rooney 's out for tomorrow , '' sir alex says . 
  `` he has a bad throat . 
  there were traces of it in amsterdam last thursday and he 's been in bed for a lot of the weekend . '', 
  on paul pogba staying : `` it 's possible . 
  there 's been no progress on his contract talks . '', 
  `` michael owen 's training well . 
  with his record of injuries we need to make sure he does a full preparation before he joins us . 
  i would think he 'd join us in about two weeks . 
  berbatov 's fit and he 'll be here next year . '', 
  and i really need to poo !, 
  chris smalling a major doubt for spurs . 
  decision to be made on saturday . 
  no concussion , just a deep cut . 
  tom cleverley and antonio valencia are definitely ruled out but michael owen is back in training . 
  wayne rooney returns after his throat infection . 
  sir alex on spurs : `` harry redknapp 's added lot of players and changed things around . 
  the boy kyle walker is a tremendous full-back with great pace going forward and there 's pace on other side from gareth bale . 
  rafael van der vaart has cleverness off the front . 
  with luka modric , everyone realiess what a tremendous player he is so it 's a team full of talent and they 're having a great season . '', 
  sir alex ferguson followed sunday 's vital victory over tottenham on sunday by revealing some positive news on the injury front . 
  the united boss welcomed anderson back to the squad at white hart lane as an unused substitute and he also hopes to have tom cleverley , chris smalling and antonio valencia available again in the coming fortnight . 
  `` the good thing is i 'm getting players back , '' he told mutv . 
  `` anderson is back now , cleverley will be fit for next week [ against west brom on sunday ] and chris smalling will be back for thursday [ against athletic club ] . 
  `` valencia should be back for the away trip the week after . 
  if we 've got a full squad it gives us a better chance [ to win the league ] .
