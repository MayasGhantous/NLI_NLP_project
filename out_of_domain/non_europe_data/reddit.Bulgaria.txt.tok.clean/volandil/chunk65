  ** west bromich albion 1:0 manchester united **, 
  ** 18 ' ** - goal for wba - nicky shorey, 
  ** 45 ' ** - great chance for united , will keane steals the ball , rounds the keeper and has his shot cleared off the line by an incoming defender . 
  ** half time **, 
  no changes at half time , second half under way, 
  ** 49 ' ** early united pressure , resulting in some corner kicks . 
  ** 60 ' ** mufc sub : veseli off , wilson on,

  so we 've been running a vanilla 1.1 server for awhile , 1.2.3 came out and we decided to start clean . 
  world has been generated , we 've played for awhile and suddenly these holes in the world begin to appear here and there , visible to only one of the connected clients . 
  i can see my hole , ca n't see yours , you can walk on top of mine and etc. 
  would n't be a huge problem , but sometimes people fell through it down to bedrock and bellow and loose their stuff . 
  if you disconnect/reconnect - the hole is gone and you can play normal until you encounter another one . 
  anyway , it looks really weird , i 'm attaching some screenshots from me and others . 
  nothing in the server log file . 
  has anyone seen anything like this ? 
  any ideas ? 
  sir alex says :, 
  we were a bit unlucky against benfica at home but at that point we needed to beat them . 
  it was a disappointment but tomorrow i 'm playing a strong team and i hope that makes a difference . '', 
  `` ferdinand 's form in particular over the last couple of months has been outstanding . 
  it tells you that when you play two players together over long periods , rather than chop and change , it makes a difference . 
  jonny evans has benefited there . 
  that 's been a plus . '', 
  `` i 'll accept 1-0 tomorrow rather than 2-1 or 3-2 . 
  without question . '', 
  paul scholes is fit . 
  sir alex : `` we just gave him a day off . 
  we gave him a rest . 
  he was indoors [ today ] . 
  paul and ryan [ giggs ] do n't train every day . 
  we give them certain days off . '', 
  sir alex on anderson and lindegaard : `` anderson was a sub on sunday . 
  he 's back now and fit , training very well . 
  he 'll be involved tomorrow . 
  it 's good to get a player of that quality back for the run-in . 
  it 's an exciting time at the club . 
  we had a fantastic result on sunday . 
  if we have the full squad available for us it 's going to help us . '', 
  `` anders is training now . 
  he 's doing the running but it will take two or three weeks before he gets to the football side of it . 
  he 's progressing very well , though . '', 
  tom cleverley is fit again . 
  sir alex : `` cleverley 's back training with the first team . 
  he 's been with the phyios for a few days but he 's now back in our control . 
  [ antonio ] valencia should join us on monday . 
  then , apart from vidic and fletcher , that gives us a full squad . 
  hopefully it stays that way until the end of the season . '', 
  ** saf on pogba ** - i ca n't tell you anything about that . 
  i dont know, 
  david de gea on the criticism he 's had this season : `` it only serves to make you a strong person , to keep fighting and not get down . 
  it can almost be a positive thing . '',

  manchester united xi :, 
  formation :, 
  ** match highlights : **, 
  ** 9 ' ** long shot from pogba makes it hard for the goalkeeper who drops the ball but manages to take away the rebound by petrucci . 
  nothing comes out of the resulting corner . 
  ** 15 ' ** great pass across the pitch from michael keane finds pogba in space , he goes past the keeper one cool move , but the shot is cleared off the line, 
  ** 22 ' ** heavy united pressure , good corner ends in will keane who shoots but has his shot blocked, 
  ** half time **, 
  pretty even after the first 25 minutes , petrucci and pogba impressing so far , united dominating but hard to create many clear chances . 
  ** 46 ' ** game restarts and united carry on where they left it , petrucci shoots just over the bar after a good work down the right wing by fabio, 
  ** 54 ' ** ahh , and that 's a painful miss by fabio , clear header after a good cross by petrucci and it 's wide !, 
  ** 65 ' ** ** goal manchester united **, 
  paul pogba freekick is parried by the blackburn keeper into the path of will keane who shoots and michael keane either taps it in or is n't . . either way the keane family scores , 
  ** 66 ' ** substitution united : fabio off , matt james on . 
  ** 86 ' ** substition united : lingard off , veseli on . 
  ** full time ** united win ** 0:1 **, 
  18:08 sir alex : `` it 's a difficult game for us , athletic club have a tremedous advantage after winning at old trafford . 
  it 's a challenge but not one beyond us . 
  our record away from home helps us - we 've done very well . 
  we 're going to need a good performance . '', 
  18:11 sir alex : `` i think march has always proved to be an important month and historically it proved to be a good month for us . 
  we have to kick on now and win our games . '', 
  on balancing his team selection : `` i have no option tomorrow because jones is out and smalling is not 100 per cent ready , he will only be ready for the bench . 
  so i will play rafael at right-back with rio and evans as centre-backs . 
  there may be one or two changes in terms of the midfield composition . '', 
  18:14 sir alex on berbatov : `` he could play tomorrow but i have good options with front players . 
  his contract situation is we will be taking up the renewal option on the contract , but having had chats with him , he wants to get first team football and we need to consider that at the end of the season . 
  at the moment he remains at united . 
  i 'd listen to what he says . 
  i think he 's concerned he is n't getting enough first-team football but it 's difficult for me to guarantee that . 
  you can understand he wants that at 31 . 
  it may lead to him looking elsewhere . '', 
  18:20 sir alex on keeping pressure on manchester city : `` we 've just hung in there and we got a break at the weekend . 
  we hope we do n't slip up now . 
  we want to win our games . 
  we 've got a difficult game on sunday . 
  our run-in on paper looks okay but you do n't perform on paper , you have to perform on the field and make sure you 're sensible with your performances . '', 
  on facing wolves this sunday : `` you have to respect the teams at the bottom of the league - they 're fighting for their lives . '', 
  18:21 sir alex on tomorrow 's approach : `` we 'll try to win . 
  it needs a good performance to do that .
