  10:32 sir alex spoke about patrick vieira 's ` united are desperate ' comments in his press conference : `` if it 's desperation bringing the best midfielder in britain back for the last 20 years [ paul scholes ] then i think we can accept that . 
  i think he was programmed for that . 
  roberto [ mancini ] had a wee dig a couple of weeks back . 
  we 're all going to play our hand that way . 
  there will be plenty of ammunition for that . 
  `` i think the point vieira makes about ravel morrison and losing our young players -- we wanted to sell him let 's be clear about that for obvious reasons . 
  but we want pogba to stay because we think he 's going to be a fantastic manchester united player and hopefully that 's the case . 
  `` if you talk about desperation ... city played a player the other night who refused to go on the pitch and the manager said he 'd never play again and he takes a five-month holiday in argentina ... what is that ? 
  could that come under the description of desperation ? 
  there will be plenty of ammunition do n't worry . '', 
  10:15 here are the main team-news points from sir alex 's press conference : `` we had a good stint out of the young first-team players last night . 
  jones and smalling have been in and out with injuries and illness , while cleverley , pogba and fabio have had bits of games [ in the first team ] . 
  we took paul pogba off as he will be involved on monday . 
  we 're only waiting on nani and owen now - we expect both to start training with us next week . '', 
  sir alex on the title race : `` every game is a must-win game . 
  hopefully we can keep the momentum going . 
  we have to kick on with nine league games and hopefully we pick the right teams . 
  we got a break when city lost to swansea . 
  each game represents its own challenge as we go along - we need to win all of them . 
  the players have shown resilience and dug in and we 're in the position now because of that . 
  getting players back strengthens our challenge . 
  we 're delighted to have most of the players fit now - it gives me a variety . '', 
  sir alex on pogba : `` we want paul pogba to stay because we think he 's going to be a fantastic manchester united player . 
  we hope that 's the case . '', 
  sir alex on jonny evans : `` evans ' partnership with rio ferdinand has been very good and a lot of that is down to rio - he 's really helped evans . 
  jonny has been in fanatstic form . '', 
  sir alex on paul scholes ' record since coming back : `` he can dictate the tempo of games very well . 
  he has the experience . 
  he has a terrific football brain . 
  the reason he wanted to retire was because he wanted to play 50 games , not 25 games . 
  it was because he wanted to play more . 
  [ contrary to press reports ] i have not spoken to him about next season . '', 
  so the hq pics from the wolves game were finally [ published ] ( http://hqworld.net/2012/03/wolverhampton-0-5-manchester-united-18-march/ ), 
  not really sure if it turned out alright , but there they are :, 
  they are a bit silly , someone with more skills can definitely make them better , as the photos are amazing . 
  09:40 here are the main team news points from sir alex 's press conference : `` we have the same squad as on monday night , there are no changes . 
  rio is okay - he just felt a bit stiff . 
  we know the situation with that - we addressed it right away and put smalling on . 
  he 's fine . 
  we expect nani to train tomorrow but the game will come too soon for him .
