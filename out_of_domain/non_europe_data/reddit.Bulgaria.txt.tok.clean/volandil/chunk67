  lindegaard was training very well and maybe overdid it . 
  we 've given him a week off and he should be back before the end of the season . '', 
  sir alex on blackburn : `` blackburn is always a difficult type of game . 
  it 's always a bit feisty and has a local derby feeling about it . 
  last season we came back from a goal down to win the league . 
  we expect a difficult game - that 's the way all the games will be . 
  you can look at all the games and say blackburn , qpr , wigan and villa are all fighting for their lives . 
  hopefully we can navigate them . 
  it 's important for us to make sure we get in front in games . '', 
  sir alex on the lack of european football : `` we 've been used to playing wednesday-saturday-wednesday-saturday - we miss it . 
  but it does give us freshness . 
  we 'd rather have champions league games though . '', 
  sir alex on the fulham game and penalty decisions : `` it was an interesting game on monday night . 
  it showed how teams are determined to stick to their job and defend well . 
  from the referee 's position i can see why the murphy penalty was n't given because the ball moved at an angle . 
  we could have had a penalty ourselves . 
  `` you get breaks here and there - good and bad . 
  they even themselves out . 
  we 've had some terrible decisions at old trafford - look at the newcastle game . 
  [ against city ] tottenham had a claim when balotelli was n't sent off ... 
  someone said united do n't get penalties at old trafford - but the average over the last 20 years or so is only about three a season or something like that . 
  most managers believe the breaks even themselves out . '',

  ** 6 ' ** - goal manchester united - pearson slides it in after some nice play by van velzen on the left, 
  ** 25 ' ** - much more even game after the early goal . 
  patches of united and newcastle dominance but pretty even overall . 
  ** 34 ' ** goal newcastle : flick from from a set piece . 
  good free kick that . 
  ** 40 ' ** goal manchester united : rudge scores after another nice run from van velzen, 
  ** half time **, 
  not much happening in the second half , 60 minutes gone , van velzen made another of his menacing runs , this time on the right wing , but could n't connect with anyone for the final ball . 
  ** 70 ' ** sub : mufc barmby off - byrne on,

  sir alex on reported valencia ankle op in summer : `` i do n't know where that story has come from - it 's never been on the agenda or discussed . 
  he has a plate in there and at the moment it stays there . 
  his form has been unbelievable . 
  when you get players hitting form , their best form , at this time of season , it 's a bonus . '', 
  sir alex on the importance of the fans : `` they have been important over the years at this time of the season . 
  the surge they can give us , particularly at old trafford , in the last 15 minutes or so of games almost helps to suck the ball into the net . 
  they definitely give us an advantage . 
  they were fantastic at blackburn from the first minute and it would be great if they can create that for the rest of the games . '', 
  saf on qpr - it 's never easy against a team fighting for survival . 
  qpr is going to be a hard one .

  edit, 
  ** second game **, 
  ajax amsterdam ** 1:0 ** manchester united, 
  game was live on eurosport2 , and if the thread was n't downvoted to 0 someone could 've seen it . 
  i 'm not saying everyone should care about the academy and the reserves , but this is still manchester united related and even if someone has a personal problem with me , should n't just downvote those threads . 
  here are the main updates from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  ** team news : **, 
  `` we have no injuries from wednesday . 
  that 's probably the only thing we 've taken out of the game . 
  we did the right thing resting paul scholes -- he 'll play on sunday . 
  he 's shown his influence since he came back . '', 
  ** on the wigan defeat : ** `` we were disappointed to lose but we have to put it into perspective . 
  in the treble year we went through the whole season from december without losing . 
  a couple of years back we lost 4-1 at home to liverpool and won the league by nine points . 
  from the position of a few months ago to where we are today , we have to be delighted . '', 
  ** on aston villa : ** `` they are probably safe but you never know . 
  i expect them , as they showed against liverpool , to be very determined . 
  sunday is very important and we must get back on track . 
  a great thing about our club is we do recover and we have to do that again . '', 
  ** on alex mcleish : ** `` he is a very capable manager . 
  he 's had some criticism from fans but has handled it very well . 
  i 've known him since he was a little kid . 
  he was always a very receptive and intelligent young man . 
  he was a great player and had a good career . 
  he did a great job for scotland and at birmingham , and will do a good job at villa given time . '', 
  ** on roberto mancini conceding the title : ** `` i think he has maybe picked the wrong time to say it -- there are still five games to go . 
  the premier league is fascinating . 
  our experience will help us and sunday 's game is the one to focus on . '',
