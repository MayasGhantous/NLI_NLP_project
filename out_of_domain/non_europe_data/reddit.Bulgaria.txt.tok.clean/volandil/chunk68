  [ stream # 1 ] ( http://www.coolsport.tv/stream2.php ), 
  ** kick off **, 
  ** 4 ' ** : will keane tests the keeper with a good shot from just outside the area , comfortably saved thou . 
  ** 5 ' ** : now lingard tests the newcastle keeper , trying to chip him , but it 's low and he catches it . 
  reverse attack , newcastle go close with a cross on the back post . 
  lively . 
  ** 13 ' ** : nice combination on the flank has vermijl pass the ball into petrucci to tap in , but he is offside and the goal is disallowed . 
  ** 15 ' ** : ** goal for newcastle ** - good cross from the right in the area , the united defense gets distracted by some geordie flashing his man boobs and noone of 3 people reacts to the cross , leaving the newcastle striker to tap it in on the far post . 
  ** 19 ' ** : good run on the left wing by de laet , goes into the box , cross back to lingard , who shoots soft at the keeper . 
  response . 
  ** 25 ' ** : penalty for newcastle - scored . 
  2:0 for newcastle . 
  zeki fryers penalized for a handball in the penalty area , did n't look like it from the replays , but given by the linesman . 
  ** 31 ' ** : goal newcastle , 3:0 up now . 
  simple cross on the far post , defenders watch from close distance and headed into the net . 
  good header . 
  ** 39 ' ** : will keane pulls one back for united , 3:1 now . 
  ** 40 ' ** : will keane with a second , great shot in the keepers corner , very good goal that . 
  just 3:2 now !, 
  ** half time **, 
  ** 50 ' ** : thorpe replaces larnell cole, 
  ** 53 ' ** : goal for united and it 's ** will keane ** again !, 
  scores a good team goal , started by a good one two with richie delaet . 
  ** 63 ' ** : goal for united - petrucci and it 's 3:4, 
  ** 70 ' ** : another good attack by united , with delaet heading just high . 
  richie seem to be playing way further up the pitch in the striker position and has been pretty dangerous there . 
  ** 72 ' ** : goal for united - 4th for will keane who is quickest to get to a long ball behind the newcastle defense , rounds the keeper and scores in the empty net . 
  five for united , four for will keane . 
  ** 75 ' ** : goal for united - the cherry on top - de laet scores a typical strikers goal and it 's now 3:6 . 
  ** complete meltdown . 
  fair to say , the reserves want to win the league today , not next game . 
  ** 79 ' ** : substitution for united : de laet replaced by fornasier, 
  ** 86 ' ** substition for united : blackett replaces lingard . 
  very promising defender from the academy , not sure if it is his debut at reserves level . 
  ** full time **, 
  and we get the reserve league north title , with more then 4 games in hand .

  ** fun fact : ** mufc are already champions of the northern reserves league and will play against aston villa , who won the south reserves league . 
  ** fun fact : ** many of the players in this reserve games from both teams , played against each other in a very interesting fa youth cup semi final last year . 
  the game ended with a 2:3 win for united , with 4 red cards shown , 2 for each team . 
  ** kick off **, 
  ** ^ 13 ' ** : not much happening in the first 10-15 minutes of the game , the two teams pretty much canceling each other with lfc being a bit more active in attack . 
  ** ^ 23 ' ** : will keane a bit isolated upfront , tunnicliffe and petrucci failing to control the midfield so far , hopefully will improve as game progresses . 
  ** ^ 25 ' ** : ** goal ** for mufc - michael keane assist ( cross ) by jesse lingard, 
  * lfc defense fails to clear a free kick low cross in the penalty area and michael keane is fastest to get to it and put it in the net . 
  ** ^ 40 ' ** : ** goal ** for mufc - jesse lingard assist ( long ball ) by michael keane, 
  * long ball from our own half finds jesse lingard running behind the lfc defense and a calm finish by jesse . 
  ** half time **, 
  ** second half **, 
  * weather changed a little there ... *, 
  ** ^ 49 ' ** : ** goal ** for lfc , their striker unmarked at the far post . 
  the conditions are bad really , very heavy rain pouring down . 
  ** ^ 65 ' ** : ** sub ** united - forbasier on cole off, 
  ** ^ 90 ' ** : nervous last minutes of the game , as lfc look for an equalizer , wasting some good chances in the process . 
  ** ^ 90 ' ** : ** goal ** lfc - and they find the equalizer in stopage time , poor defending by mufc, 
  ** full time **, 
  * probably realistic result , we played better in the first half , they really tried hard in the second . 
  here are the main points from sir alex 's press conference ... 
  `` everbody 's fit after last sunday . 
  ashley young got a knock in the second half but i 'm hoing he 's okay . 
  the only injury we received is paul pogba suffered ankle ligament damage in the reserves on monday . 
  we think he 's out for the season now . 
  `` michael owen 's been training with the first team for about a week now . 
  that 's good news . 
  if there 's a player who can score an important goal at any stage of the match it 's him . 
  when he gets an injury it 's never an easy one - it 's months rather than weeks . 
  it 's unfortunate because he 's a fantastic striker . 
  `` we want to try and get michael back . 
  if we get him back and he continues his training he 'll be incontention as a sub . 
  he wo n't be involved on sunday , though . 
  but for his injuries , who 's to say what sort of career he 'd have had . 
  `` i do n't think anderson will play again this season . 
  there are only four games left and it will be difficult for him . 
  `` we hope we can show the same form we showed last sunday against aston villa . 
  it 's never an easy game against everton . 
  hopefully we can get the result we want . '', 
  `` what david moyes has achieved in 10 years is phenomenal . 
  especially given the financial reserves he has . 
  but he 's managed to do it , time and time again . 
  it defies logic that he still gets decent results and keeps his team in the top half of the league . 
  `` everton going out of the fa cup was a bad result for them . 
  they went into that game in good form but losing a semi-final and a derby is always disappotining . 
  no matter what happened last week it was always going to be a hard game for us .
