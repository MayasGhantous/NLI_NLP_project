  * 14:18 here are the main points from sir alex 's press conference ... *, 
  `` i suppose when the fixture came out it all pointed to this game . 
  there was an inevitability to it . 
  but we are where we are . 
  now it 's all down to this game . 
  it will be a fantastic atmosphere . 
  `` we 're smarting from the four goals we gave away last week . 
  we tend to make it hard for ourselves , we subject our supporters to that sort of drama . 
  for years and years it 's been like that . 
  hopefully we 'll make amends on monday . 
  `` it 's not a cup final . 
  it 's a league game , although i think it could decide the title . 
  `` roberto [ mancini ] wants to take pressure off his own players . 
  it wo n't affect our approach or attitude to the game . 
  we know the situation we 're in . 
  we 're in a better position than manchester city . 
  we could come out with two results , whereas they have to win . 
  although you know this club 's attitude . 
  we 'll be trying to win . 
  `` i think there 's enough experience . 
  carrick as well . 
  there 's enough experience to cope with this siutation . 
  `` i think the previous encounters this season are irrelevant . 
  we 've already met three times but the past is the past . 
  it does n't matter . 
  it 's all down to monday . 
  `` we have to get used to playing city in important games . 
  the financial support they have means we 'll meet them in a lot of big games . 
  therefore , if we 're going to be contesting with them for the league title it will become almost as important as the liverpool derbies . 
  in fact , this supercedes liverpool at the moment because they 're our direct opponents . 
  we have to focus on the team who can affect our progress in terms of winning the league . 
  `` i do n't know if you thrive in this sort of situation . 
  i do n't know if i 'm looking forward to it , but i 'm up for it . 
  i 'm prepared for it and i think the players are prepared for it . '', 
  14:45 sir alex has confirmed the team are going away before the derby game but he did n't confirm the location .

  res : united win on penalties, 
  anders lindegaard made his first appearance since january and kept a clean sheet before saving twice in the penalty shoot-out victory over blackpool in the lancashire senior cup semi-final . 
  warren joyce fielded a mix of players who have been out on loan and academy youngsters in front of the dane and a goalless draw was played out before the drama of spot-kicks with lindegaard saving jamie menagh 's shot in sudden death . 
  the seasiders were the better side in the opening exchanges with gerardo bruna seeing a shot deflect wide inside the first minute . 
  roman bednar spurned a glorious chance after a defensive lapse by blazing over and craig sutherland took aim to fire another deflected attempt off target . 
  lindegaard , who has been sidelined with an ankle injury , threw himself to his right to pull off a top-class save to frustrate louis almond but the visitors were soon threatening again with sutherland guilty of a bad miss with a free header . 
  it took united 33 minutes to register a first real attempt on goal , skipper robbie brady firing over the top following persistent work by former hull loanee joshua king , while stephen husband had the final noteworthy shot of the half , lindegaard dealing with the ball as it skidded off the turf . 
  joyce switched brady to join king in attack at the start of the second half and it almost reaped dividends within four minutes . 
  king forced a superb save out of mark halstead after being fed by charni ekangamene with the ball then bouncing off the frame of the goal . 
  john murphy 's team responded with an almond snap-shot that was well fielded by lindegaard but the, 
  reds looked handier up front with jack rudge playing king through and , although the flag stayed down , the norwegian could only fire against halstead 's legs as the stalemate continued . 
  john fleck and almond blasted efforts wide of lindegaard 's goal while united responded with a brady scooped shot that was easily handled by halstead and another wayward drive from the irishman when rudge was in the clear to his left . 
  lindegaard denied almond in stoppage time so the tie went to a penalty shoot-out and the scandinavian shot-stopper kept out blackpool 's first kick by robert harris . 
  although king , reece brown , luke giverin and brady scored , scott wootton 's miss meant sudden death . 
  ekangamene displayed great composure to chip his spot-kick over halstead and substitute menagh showed courage to face lindegaard from 12 yards but the dane 's save means united progress to the final against accrington stanley , with the pre-season date to still be confirmed . 
  united : lindegaard ; vermijl , wootton , brown , giverin ; rudge ( gorre 89 ) , fornasier , hendrie , ekangamene , brady ; king . 
  subs : wilkinson , johnstone , fletcher . 
  ** team news : ** `` evans is still injured . 
  he 's improving a bit but i do n't think he 'll make sunday . 
  welbeck is out -- he got injured on monday night , but he 'll hopefully be ready for sunderland . 
  other than that , we 're well prepared . '', 
  ** on the title race : ** `` monday night was a blow to us . 
  we have to do what we can now and hopefully win our game on sunday . 
  by that time we 'll know what we 'll need to do , after city 's game [ vs newcastle ] . 
  hopefully we can recover and win our own game . 
  we 'll be aware of the game going on before ours -- you ca n't avoid it . 
  we still have to prepare for our game , though -- we wo n't neglect our preparation . 
  but if city were to win by 3-0 , say , the goal difference would be 11 . 
  it would be impossible for us then , i think . '', 
  ** on newcastle 's prospects against city : ** `` newcastle are fighting for that position in the top four and they have a chance . 
  it 's an exciting end to the season .
