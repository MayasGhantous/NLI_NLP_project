  here are the main points from sir alex ferguson 's press conference :, 
  ** team news for sunday : ** `` chris smalling had a bad ( groin ) injury last weekend . 
  we tried to take him off but then rio got a knock . 
  chris is going to miss the european championship . 
  we 're assessing at the moment what we 'll do but certainly it 's a bad injury . 
  rio is okay and i can play phil jones in there ( at centre-back ) with rio . '', 
  ** on going for a final-day victory : ** `` everyone wants to win their last game of the season and we 're no different . 
  it 's important for us , we 'll try and do our best and hopefully something stupid will happen to city . '', 
  ** on facing martin o'neill 's sunderland : ** `` martin has turned the club around , no question about that . 
  steve bruce was very unfortunate , it had a lot to do with him being from newcastle so he never got any leeway . 
  martin came with a great cv - every club he 's been at he 's made them better , like villa , leicester and celtic . 
  he is an outstanding manager , no doubt about that , and it 's not going to be easy for us up there , we know that . 
  we 're going there with a chance of winning the league and you know it 'll never be easy . 
  in these last day matches where we have a chance of winning the league , three times we 've won it , and once we lost the title by drawing at west ham . 
  they 're not easy games . 
  we were 1-0 down to tottenham in 1999 . 
  they 're never easy . '',
