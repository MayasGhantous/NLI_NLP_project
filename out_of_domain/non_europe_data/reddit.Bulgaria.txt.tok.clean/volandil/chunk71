  ** kick off **, 
  ** 18 ' ** : mostly even game , brady wastes two good chances with poor finishing so far . 
  both teams still not fully in the game . 
  ** 22 ' ** : brady wins a good free kick just on the edge of the area . 
  ** 23 ' ** : brady shoots a very powerful shot from the freekick , but city 's keeper manages to punch it out . 
  ** 26 ' ** : goal for mufc - will keane * assist by petrucci *, 
  ** 35 ' ** : ryan tunnicliffe somehow is not sent off for a crazy , dangerous , reckless and late challenge . 
  just a yellow , should 've been off really . 
  ** 45 ' ** : brady and lingard are booked in the last minutes of the first half . 
  ** half time **, 
  ** second half **, 
  ** 55 ' ** : couple of good chances for lingard , will keane and paul pogba , but no second goal yet . 
  ** 57 ' ** : zeky fryers goes in the book too . 
  ** 69 ' ** : sub for mufc , davide petruccci is replaced by tom thorpe, 
  ** 75 ' ** : good cross from the right hand side by tunnicliffe , but will keane heads it just wide . 
  ** 81 ' ** : sub for mufc , fornasier replaces brady, 
  ** 89 ' ** : sub for mufc , giverin replaces vermijl . 
  ** 92 ' ** : goal for mufc !, 
  giverin runs onto a ball provided by will keane and scores !, 
  game should 've ended , but obviously there is a mini pitch invasion on the emptyhad . 
  ** full time **, 
  stupid stewarding by emptyhad staff .
