  full time - 1:1, 
  12:43 sir alex begins by talking about how he 'll cover chris smalling 's injury . 
  `` it 's not 100 % jonny evans and nemanja vidic will start the season . 
  jonny will start running today . 
  vida and phil jones started full training today , which is very positive . 
  if i can keep rio fit , then vidic and jones should give us ample cover . '', 
  12:45 rio on shinji kagawa : `` i 've been very , very impressed . 
  i 'd seen him play for dortmund on tv and i looked on youtube . 
  he 's been fantastic . 
  he 's quick , he 's sharp , he has great awareness , he plays off both feet . 
  i 'm excited about playing with him and getting the season started . 
  he 's been one of the better players in germany for the last few years . 
  i think he 'll bring that form to manchester united . 
  i think he 'll be a great acquisition . '', 
  12:46 sir alex on kagawa : `` on the training ground he never needs an explanation . 
  after one demonstration he picks it up right away . 
  the language is n't a problem . 
  a good footballer can pick up what 's needed . 
  he 's been fantastic in that respect . 
  i 've been quite surprised at that . '', 
  12:47 sir alex on reports united have agreed to sign lucas moura : `` it 's not correct . 
  we have n't reached an agreement for the player . 
  we 've shown an interest but until such time a we get a deal agreed we ca n't say he 's our player . '', 
  12:49 sir alex on more signings : `` we 've signed two players in the summer - kagawa and powell . 
  we think they both have fantastic potential . 
  at this moment we 're looking at other options in terms of bringing other players in . 
  we 're not lying on our backsides doing nothing . 
  we 're trying hard to bring other players to the club . '', 
  12:51 rio on shanghai shenhua : `` we 're looking forward to playing shanghai . 
  it 's a great game for both clubs . 
  shanghai get to see where they 're at and the main focus for us is to get through the game unscathed and step up our fitness . 
  there 's a lot of interest because of drogba and anelka but for us it 's just another game . '', 
  12:52 sir alex is asked whether he would have considered signing drogba on a free : `` the decision was his anyway . 
  he said he was going to leave chelsea and not play again in england . 
  so that eliminated everyone . '', 
  12:54 sir alex on chinese fans ' reception : `` as we expected , there 's a great enthusiasm for manchester united from the fans . 
  we 're very pleased with that . '', 
  12:56 sir alex on darren fletcher : `` darren has a medical situation that he 's trying hard to keep under control . 
  we do n't expect him back immediately but hopefully he does come back at some point . 
  paul scholes , a year ago , was coaching my reserves . 
  now he 's back playing and everybody attached to united is delighted . 
  he 's such a fantastic player . 
  in the long-term , trying to replace scholes is very difficult . 
  to replace a great player like him would be hard for anyone . 
  we always hope somebody turns up through the ranks of united , from the academy . 
  we 've also signed the young boy powell . 
  we hope he devlops into a top-class centre midfield player because he has very good potential . '', 
  12:58 sir alex on chelsea : `` i think the owners have got their enthusiasm back . 
  having won the champions league there 's more expectation on them now . 
  that was the trophy roman always wanted to win , so he 's invested in the team again this summer . 
  it 's a challenge for us , i suppose , and we always respect chelsea . 
  you just have to wait and see how good these players are . '',
