  13:31 wayne : `` it 's great to play in big games and barcelona is one of them . 
  it 's all part of our preparation and we need to make sure we do the right things . 
  we want to enjoy the game and get our fitness ready for the first game of the season . 
  the result , in some ways , is n't the most important thing . 
  what 's important is the fitness and the sharpness . 
  i 'm happy with how i 'm doing . 
  i 've been training for almost two weeks and i 've been working hard . 
  13:32 nemanja : `` we have two new players with us . 
  we 've improved a bit in the middle . 
  nick and shinji have done well so far . 
  we 've had more experience than last year . 
  we had some young players play a lot of games last season and they 'll have learned a lot . 
  we all learned . 
  in europe we 've had so much success in recent years - we 've had three finals , a semi-final - and maybe we relaxed a bit last season . 
  we were punished last season and we ca n't allow that to happen again . 
  we had a few injuries last season too . 
  i hope everyone can stay fit this season . 
  the young players can learn from last year , so i 'm confident we 'll be better this year . '', 
  13:33 nemanja : `` it 's hard to take when you lose the league in the last few minutes , but we do n't think about that now . 
  we 've had success in the past as well , but we forget about that too . 
  we move forward . 
  that 's something we 've always been good at . 
  now we 're training hard and we 're playing barcelona , who are a great team . 
  we can test ourselves to see where we are . '', 
  13:38 nemanja : `` we have a lot of players in defence . 
  but that 's good for the team . 
  the last two years we 've had a lot of injuries in defence and we 've had to bring carrick into that position sometimes . 
  but i believe this year we 'll all be in good shape and we 'll do the best we can to help the team do well . '', 
  13:39 wayne : `` we have n't been here that long . 
  it 's obviously a nice city and it 's great that two of the biggest teams in the world can play a game here . 
  it 's exciting . 
  we just want to put on an exciting game . 
  we do n't get to see much , though . 
  we just train and stay at the hotel . '', 
  13:40 mike phelan : `` as a club , you look at the issues that may have caused injuries . 
  some of those are created on the pitch and there 's not a lot you can do about that . 
  maybe some have crept in through overuse or overwork but we 've analysed those things and we 're sure our players are prepared for what 's always a hard league . 
  all of these players are preparing for what could be a season of 60-plus games . 
  that takes time , obviously . 
  what we try and get to is a point where everybody is fit for selection in the first game of the season . '', 
  13:42 mike phelan : `` at the moment , chris smalling is going to be a bit longer in his recovery . 
  he 's had a setback , an injury , and he 's progressing slowly . 
  jonny evans will hopefully be available when we get back [ from euorpe ] . 
  he 's back doing light work on the training ground . 
  we hope he 'll be available for the start of the season . 
  he wo n't have had the games under his belt but if he 's fit and progressing well we 'll push him forward . '', 
  phelan on gap between #mufc & barca : `` i think there is a gap there , but there 's a gap for a lot of teams , not just ourselves . '', 
  from gotteborg , sweden .
