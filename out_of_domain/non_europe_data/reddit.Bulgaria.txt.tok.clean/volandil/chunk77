  defending is every bit as important as the goals we 're scoring . 
  there are goals in our team , certainly but you have to balance that out . 
  do we have to score three to win every game ? 
  i do n't want to go down that road . 
  hopefully we can keep ferdinand and vidic fit . 
  that will help . '',

  14:00 sir alex and javier hernandez are here and we 're ready to get started . 
  the boss opens by declaring the team will reflect his desire of not wanting to be careless . 
  `` i 'll be playing a more experienced team tomorrow , '' he says , and then admits the key to success in the competition will be keeping the defenders fit . 
  14:03 the manager hopes the home form will return to its impressive best in europe after the relatively poor performances at old trafford last term in both the champions league and europa league . 
  `` it has to be a driving force , '' he says of the need to put teams to bed and go for more goals rather than resting on any laurels . 
  `` goal difference feels like a priority . 
  better being on the black side of that than the red . 
  it has to be an important issue for us . '', 
  14:06 sir alex is asked about playing away on the back of a champions league tie , with liverpool on the horizon . 
  `` you do n't get it all your own way just got to accept it and get on with it , '' he replies . 
  when a journalist from nippon tv makes a query about shinji kagawa , the boss says he could have played on saturday as he 's fit and has trained today . 
  `` he 'll be a very important player for us . '', 
  14:11 javier hernandez takes centre stage and declares : `` right now , i 'm happy . 
  every time you have a proper rest and i made my first pre-season with the team of course it 's going to help me a lot . 
  i 'm the luckiest player in the world to be at this club . '', 
  14:14 the inevitable question about the goalkeeping situation crops up but the manager merely states there is a strong possibility that david de gea could come back . 
  he continues to add it will be a very close game tomorrow because , speaking from experience , games against turkish opposition are always tough . 
  14:15 sir alex elaborates a little about his choice in goal , admitting both david de gea and anders lindegaard are young and inexperienced in the english game so `` alternating is not a big problem for me '' . 
  14:18 sir alex says he did not hear any chants about liverpool on saturday but chief executive david gill did from the directors ' box and was disappointed with them . 
  `` we are completely in support of liverpool football club at this moment in time and understand what the families must have felt when they got that report , '' he stated . 
  `` i 'm disappointed to hear that . 
  it 's a minority . '', 
  14:20 the manager also addresses a question about racism in football and reckons you would not have heard that issue brought up last year . 
  `` last season was a bad one for the sport , '' he admits . 
  `` i do n't think , apart from last year , it 's been an issue . '',

  on brendan rogers : `` he is a young manager and any young manager needs time . 
  in the modern world you do n't get that . 
  the only route for any manager is success . 
  it 's a results industry . 
  there was less pressure when i started , but the world has changed , the press has changed . '', 
  on sunday 's game : `` we 've given a lot of messages from manchester united . 
  it 's an important game for both clubs . 
  it 's possible everything around the game could affect the players and the game , but hopefully we can concentrate on a good match . 
  we want to try and achieve a good performance and result . '', 
  on darren fletcher : `` he made a start on wednesday . 
  he wo n't start on sunday but he 'll play against newcastle - that 's the perfect game for him to start . 
  then we have spurs and he may be involved in that . '', 
  team news : `` everyone who played on wednesday is available . 
  i know there were reports on wayne rooney being available but that 's not the case , though he 's not far away . 
  he could be back next week . 
  ashley young has a bruised cartilage - he 'll be okay in two to three weeks . '',

  and, 
  it 's fucking amazing . 
  [ everything is ready ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1dxko.gif ), 
  here are the main points from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  `` we had bad news earlier in the week about nemanja vidic . 
  it 's a blow . 
  we 've had a terrible time with defenders . 
  hopefully we get through the next three games and the international break comes along . 
  by that time we should have chris smalling back . 
  `` on wednesday we played two young boys and they did very well . 
  scott wootton reads the game well , passes the ball well and having seen him in a situation against very experienced players , i thought he did very well . 
  that 's a bonus for us and he 'll be involved in the game tomorrow . 
  `` antonio valencia 's doubtful . 
  he got a knock first of all when he went into the tackle with agger and johnson [ at anfield ] before he broke clear and got brought down . 
  he got an ankle injury there . 
  but if he 's not okay for tomorrow he should be okay for tuesday [ against cluj ] . 
  `` tottenham is always an interesting game and they play good football . 
  it 's disappoiting for harry redknapp not to be there after the job he did but the new lad , andre villas-boas has a similar philosophy that suits tottenham . 
  his teams always try and play and it should be an interesting game . 
  i think it will be open and they 'll come to try and express themselves . 
  united/tottenham games are always good . 
  hopefully we can maintain our consistency at the moment , which is n't too bad . 
  `` darren fletcher is in the squad for tomorrow . 
  obviously having played on wednesday night and contributed so well - also it was his first game of that magnitute for 10 months - i would n't start him . 
  but he may get a place on the bench and he could possibly go to romania and play against cluj . 
  that could be an ideal opportunity for him . 
  his enthusiasm on wednesday night was fantastic . 
  darren sat in front of the two centre-backs and did a really good job . '', 
  saf on rio/england : `` it 's entirely up to rio , i do n't think he 'll be called up.roy made his decision & i ca n't see him changing that . '',

  18:58 we expect sir alex will provide updates on why the likes of michael carrick , paul scholes , ryan giggs and antonio valencia have n't travelled , as well as his thoughts on tomorrow night 's match . 
  hopefully he 'll also bring us some good news in terms of other injury updates . 
  19:00 sir alex insists united will give cluj plenty of respect . 
  `` we saw them in the last game against braga and they 've beaten basel twice in the last few years , '' he says . 
  `` and basel knocked us out , so we need to give them every respect . 
  that tells you they 're a good team . '', 
  19:03 the boss believes jonny evans and rio ferdinand will benefit the more they play together . 
  `` at the end of october last season , when jonny and rio played consistently every week , we got better . 
  everyone will tell you that when you have a settled partner beside you then you get a good understanding . 
  that 's something i can hopefully build on in the next few weeks . '', 
  19:05 the manager has explained why united trained at carrington this morning instead of in the opposition stadium as they traditionally have done on european trips . 
  `` we made the decision because most of the time when you train abroad you ca n't do anything because everyone is watching . 
  training at carrington this morning allowed us to do things around picking the team and tactics . '', 
  19:05 michael carrick is missing , `` in bed with a virus '' , according to sir alex. 
  ryan giggs also has `` a bit of a virus and felt rough '' . 
  paul scholes has been left behind because `` he was n't feeling great this morning '' .
