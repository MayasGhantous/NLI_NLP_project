  `` he played so well on saturday and at 37 i ca n't expect him to play three days later . '', 
  19:07 sir alex on the 3-2 loss to tottenham : `` you have to be concerned the way we lost goals . 
  we were well off the pace of the game . 
  i do n't think we won a tackle in the first half . 
  we have some work to do in that respect . '', 
  19:08 defender jonny evans is also at the press conference . 
  of cluj 's win against braga in portugal a fortnight ago , he says : `` you ca n't go away from home in the champions league and get lucky . 
  cluj scored two goals and kept a clean sheet . 
  they 're obviously a good side . '', 
  19:10 sir alex says he hopes united do n't rely on playing well after christmas in order to challenge for the league title . 
  `` if you go back 12 years ago our normal thing was to start slowly and build up to the second half of the season . 
  but when chelsea won the two titles we changed our pre-season training and had to start quickly . 
  it 's not planned what 's happened this season [ starting slowly ] but hopefully that will bethe last of it . '', 
  19:13 there have been plenty of positives this season , of course , including the number of different scorers who have found the net for united . 
  `` i 'm dleighted with the spread of goals , '' sir alex said . 
  `` it does n't bother me who is scoring as long as we 're scoring . 
  it 's fantastic to see so many different players scoring . '', 
  19:14 a romanian journalist has just asked the boss if any of the cfr cluj players have caught his eye . 
  brazilian midfielder rafael bastos is the lucky recipient of sir alex 's seal of approval . 
  19:16 what does sir alex expect from cluj ? 
  `` they 're a team who defend quickly and get plenty of bodies behind the ball . 
  their main strength is the counter attack , as they showed against braga . 
  counter-attacking is very important in european football these days . '', 
  19:19 sir alex admits he 's found it tough to leave out anderson so far this season . 
  `` he 's a difficult one to leave out . 
  there 's been nothing wrong with the form of scholes and carrick . 
  it makes it difficult to involve others in the team , especially as our desire is always to play with two wide players . 
  but anderson 's pre-season form was terrific . 
  he 's a top player . '', 
  19:21 the boss has also confirmed that mikael silvestre is `` just training with us '' . 
  sir alex expects him to go and play in india in december . 
  19:22 sir alex also revealed he 's `` very pleased '' with shinji kagawa . 
  `` he 's been terrific . 
  he 's a very good professional , finds space very well and he 's got me two goals . 
  and he could have scored another two !, 
  he 's a goal threat . 
  it 's not easy to adapt to english football but bit by bit he 's getting down to that part . '', 
  19:23 that 's a wrap . 
  press conference over . 
  it 's a little worrying to hear michael carrick and ryan giggs had to stay behind in manchester due to the flu , but united have plenty of options in midfield . 
  we should see a few other players gain some valuable minutes tomorrow night .

  jonny evans is okay - he had a dead leg that he picked up on saturday against tottenham and we just took him off towards the end . '',

  on attacking options : `` as i 've said before , we have strength in our attacking options . 
  i put shinji on the bench [ v cluj ] . 
  we played really good football at times - it was interesting to play rooney , chicharito and van persie together . 
  it gives me some thoughts and options for certain games . 
  hopefully i 'll pick the right team . '', 
  on other injuries : `` the only one who has chance of coming back is smalling . 
  he has started training on the football side and that helps us particularly as we have problem at centre-back . 
  jones is still out , young will start training while the internationals are on , particularly in the second week , and could at a stretch be back for the stoke game . '', 
  af confirms that while he 's rotating at de gea & lindegaard at the moment , one keeper will take over at some stage .
