  ( looking for more and a sopcast if possible ), 
  no idea where petrucci , macheda or henriquez are tbh ;, 
  ** kick off **, 
  ** goal ** jesse lingard 's deflected shot puts united ahead . 
  1:0 ( deflection , assist by joshua king ), 
  ** 10 ' ** : minutes of united pressure , trying to squeeze it in through the packed southampton 's defense . 
  ** 20 ' ** : tunnicliffe runs away , puts a great pass to bebe on the right hand side , but his effort is punched into corner by the keeper . 
  ** 35 ' ** : southampton seeing more of the ball in the last few minutes , united taking their foot off the gas . 
  ** 39 ' ** : good long-rage effort by jesse lingard , corner . 
  ** half time **, 
  ** second half ** ( no changes ), 
  ** 52 ' ** : 52th minute of the game and bebe finally delivers a good cross into the penalty area . 
  unfortunately , noone is near to connect to it . 
  ** 58 ' ** : jesse lingard with another spectacular long-range effort , lands just on top of the net . 
  southampton much more dangerous compared to first half, 
  ** goal ** sinclair outjumps blackett and equilizes for southampton , ** 1:1 **, 
  ** goal ** sinclair heads another one in , ** 1:2 ** - 65th minute, 
  ** mufc sub ** : tyler blackett makes way for sean mcginty, 
  ** goal ** larnell cole makes it 2:2 with a great 1-2 with bebe , 70th minute, 
  ** mufc sub ** : bebe makes way for veseli ~ 77 minutes, 
  ** 86 ' ** : southampton pushing hard for a winner , united looking to hit them on a counter . 
  ** goal ** veseli volleys after a joshua king cross and it 's 3:2 !, 
  ** 90 ' ** : jesse lingard and larnell cole make a beautiful combination in the sotton penalty area but jesse 's shot is juust wide, 
  ** mufc sub ** : joshua king makes way for reece james, 
  ** goal ** curtis shoots from the edge of the area , and off the bar it goes in for 3:3, 
  and the ref signals for the end of the game . 
  second half was much more lively and interesting . 
  both teams could 've won it , at the end , a draw is a fair result . 
  here are the main points from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  * everyone has returned from the internationals fit . 
  sir alex says it 's `` always a time when you 're a bit concerned but we 've been lucky this time '' . 
  * ashley young is fit . 
  chris smalling is n't quite at full fitness but is making good progress . 
  on young , he says : `` very few players can cross as well as he can and his goalscoring ratio is very good . '', 
  * sir alex says stoke are `` a handful with their set-piece play and long throw-ins '' . 
  `` i think stoke have only lost one goal away from home this season , '' he says . 
  `` continuity brings consistency and they 've had the same manager and staff for a long time and , mainly , the same set of players . 
  it makes them better . '', 
  13:45 rafael is the player alongside sir alex today . 
  14:00 first on the agenda is the issue surrounding rio ferdinand and him not wearing the kick it out t-shirt . 
  sir alex says the matter is resolved . 
  `` the issue 's simple . 
  i 've spoken to rio . 
  it was a communication issue . 
  he felt i should have spoken to him on friday and i did n't anticipate that he 'd have a problem wearing the shirt . 
  my advice is to him is that i always feel a union is stronger than an individual . 
  it 's important he airs his greivances to the right people , the fa . 
  it 's been a communication issue more than anything else . 
  we 've resolved the situation , there 's no lingering problems and we move on . 
  that 's the end of the matter . '', 
  14:01 regarding his team for tomorrow the united manager adds : `` i 'm not playing rio . 
  i 'm making a few changes . 
  i 'm leaving out rio and patrice evra . 
  we have a big game against chelsea [ to think about on sunday ] . 
  we 've got ashley young back and he 'll be involved tomorrow . 
  we 've got nani , valencia , giggs ... plenty of wide players . 
  i have an issue in terms of picking the team . 
  hopefully i get it right . '', 
  14:03 sir alex says chris smalling and phil jones are `` two or three weeks away from returning which is good news . '', 
  he added : `` chris smalling trained this morning with warren joyce 's team . 
  he 's trained with them for a couple of days . 
  it 's non-contact for him at the moment . 
  the encouraging thing is that he 's getting closer . 
  i expect phil jones to start on the football side of things next monday as well . 
  they 're both two or three weeks away , which is good news . 
  they 're not far away . '', 
  boss : `` i would n't rule joshua king out of playing for us this season but he does have opposition . '', 
  14:07 sir alex believes rio ferdinand can carry on playing for another `` two or three years '' when asked about the defender 's future given his contract is up at the end of the season . 
  `` we 've always adopted the policy of offering them [ the older players ] one-year contracts . 
  i think rio could play for two or three more years . 
  he has different issues to paul [ scholes ] and ryan [ giggs ] in terms of the injuries he 's had . 
  he 's not as quick as he was but that 's not a problem for me - the experience he has in that position is more important to me and he 's still a great footballer . 
  i did n't know his contract was up at the end of the season . 
  now you 've made me panic ! '', 
  14:12 sir alex has just been asked about porto attacker james rodriguez and united 's potential interest in him . 
  the boss joked : `` as far as james rodriguez is concerned , i hope it 's not true because it costs a fortune to get a player from porto ! '', 
  14:16 the manager has some words of encouragement and praise for the man next to him , rafael . 
  `` he 's maturing and learning all the time and he 's blessed with great enthusiasm . 
  he has all the qualities - skill , speed ... he has all these things and his maturity has brought them out . 
  in the past he 's been impulsive and over-committed himself . 
  he 's maturing fantastically now . '', 
  video of the press conference will appear here when i find one . 
  shinji kagawa has been ruled out for three to four weeks with a knee injury , similar to the one ashley young suffered earlier in the season . 
  chris smalling is back training on the football side of things and phil jones will hopefully start football training a week on monday . 
  everyone else is fit . 
  sir alex says it is `` always a difficult game at chelsea . 
  two good teams and they 've had a great start to the season and have done really well . 
  they 've played an interesting formation - something we have to deal with . 
  they 've bought oscar and hazard into the team - similar types of players . 
  they 're adapting to having players like mata . 
  there is a situation where they 're in behind the front player all of the time . 
  they 're difficult to deal with . 
  they do n't have drogba so their game had to change anyway . '', 
  the boss on competition for places up front : `` it 's a good problem to have [ choosing my front players ] . 
  in fairness to all the players they 've accepted it well when i 've had to tell them they 're not playing . 
  chicha was tremendous the other night and is such a dedicated footballer . 
  he trains so well and he got a proper rest in the summer - that has made a difference and helped him . '',
