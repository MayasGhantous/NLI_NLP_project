  anderson was again brilliant for 65-70 minutes and ran out of steam . 
  chelsea 's subs were combined 75 million . 
  ours - not so much . 
  biggest problem for the team , was fletch had to move to right back and could n't shield the defenders . 
  that costs us a lot . 
  great game of football that . 
  please , do n't blame the kids , they 'll only get better from such games . 
  team news : `` we have no injuries from last sunday or wednesday . 
  chris smalling is training with the first-team squad on the football side , which is good news . 
  he 's not ready for us yet but it 's encouraging . '', 
  on arsenal : `` every game against arsenal is always a big one and it wo n't be any different tomorrow . 
  they have proved defensively this year that they 're a stronger , more physical team . 
  they have much more physical types of players than they 've had in the past . 
  i watched them last week against qpr . 
  it 'll be a hard game -- we wo n't score eight tomorrow ! '', 
  on chelsea cup defeat : `` wednesday was frustrating -- we did n't deserve to lose . 
  football is football , though . 
  it was a fantastic game . 
  we 're in a situation now where we need to score six goals to win games ! '', 
  on anderson : `` he was the best player on the pitch until he tired . 
  he needs games now and hopefully we can give him them . '', 
  on robin van persie : `` robin is a mature player and that experience helps . 
  he has great experience of playing in england . 
  it 's very satisfying for us to see the start he 's had . '', 
  on javier hernandez : `` we 've got options . 
  chicharito is in terrific form -- he is improving all the time . 
  the key to chicha 's form is the decent rest he 's had in the summer . '', 
  on arsenal 's comeback vs reading : `` it was an amazing turnaround -- you have to give fantastic credit to arsenal . 
  both teams could have scored four or five in extra time . 
  it was a crazy game and a great advert for the cup . '',

  moss lane , altrincham, 
  kick off : 19:00 bst ( approximately when this post is one hour old ), 
  mufc u21s starting xi :, 
  johnstone , vermijl , wootton , fornasier , mcginty , cole , thorpe , tunnicliffe , powell , januzaj ; macheda, 
  mufc u21s subs : veseli , sutherland , lawrence , james , ekangamene . 
  ** streams : ** [ stream # 1 ] ( http://coolsport.tv/stream1.html ), 
  team news : the lineup seems to confirm that michael keane and jesse lingard have been loaned to leicester city fc . 
  former youth reds ritchie de laet and matty james have signed for ` the foxes ' this transfer window . 
  seems roby brady is rejoining hull on loan too . 
  ** kick off **, 
  ** 5 ' ** - ** goal ** alabi steals the ball off fronasier and shoots very accurately from the edge of the box . 
  ** stoke ** one up . 
  ** 10 ' ** - united 's defense almost concede another one in similar fashion , but the misjudged backpass luckily goes out for a goal kick . 
  off topic : does anyone has an idea why the thread stays at one upvote and does n't seem to be moving up the list ? 
  is it some anti-spam filter because of the stream link ( think it 's an issue in / r/soccer ) ? 
  ** 17 ' ** - finally mufc create something interesting , powell crosses well from the left wing , but there is noone to connect at the far post . 
  ** 32 ' ** - long distance shot hits the cross bar of united 's goal . 
  johnstone got lucky this time . 
  ** 43 ' ** - ** goal ** powell with a solo run from the right wing and a great finish from tight angle . 
  ** half time ** - 1:1, 
  * second half starts *, 
  ** 60 ' ** - much quieter second half from both teams . 
  stoke making a change , palacious makes way . 
  * back *, 
  ** 80 ' ** - cole 's effort is parried into the path of januzaj , but his shot passes just outside the post, 
  ** 84 ' ** - powell almost scores again , header from a corner , inches wide, 
  ** full time ** - manchester united - stoke 1:1, 
  fair result . 
  `` we hope jonny evans will be okay for saturday . 
  he is a doubt , not a serious one though . 
  it 's a lot to ask chris smalling to play wednesday and saturday . 
  it 's great he 's back and he came through the [ braga ] game well . 
  we 're monitoring the situation with jonny - if he does n't make it chris will have to play . 
  `` nani is out with a tight hamstring and that will be around 10 days . 
  but he should be okay as it 's not torn , just tight . 
  `` although we have a great record at villa park , we have never taken them for granted . 
  we 've always had to perform there but it 's been a good ground for us as a team . 
  we 've always enjoyed it . 
  it 's one of the old traditional grounds and always has a good atmosphere , their support is always fantastic . 
  hopefully we can keep the momentum going as it 's got us into a good position at the moment . 
  `` we 're delighted to get through in the champions league . 
  we found the game [ in braga ] difficult but that 's an indication of how teams prepare - they just sat back and hoped we 'd make mistakes . 
  we lost the goal from the penalty and i thought it was going to be very difficult after that . 
  there was no indication we were going to win the match but then i brought van persie on and it made them come out a bit and from then on we went on to win it . 
  `` i do n't think it 's a problem relying on robin van persie . 
  last year we lost on goal difference - i do n't expect us to lose on goal difference again - robin may make that difference . 
  you 've seen the way young chicharito has started this season - he 'll get 20 goals plus . 
  wazza will get there too - he 'll get 20 goals plus i 'm sure . 
  it 's a healthy combination we 've got there . '',
