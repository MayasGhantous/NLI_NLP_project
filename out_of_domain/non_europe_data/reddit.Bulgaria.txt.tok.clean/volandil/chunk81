  team news : `` we still have some doubts about wayne and evans . 
  robin should be fit . 
  we 'll see what they 're like today . 
  jones has been training all week and we will take him to turkey with us . 
  chicharito should start tomorrow . '', 
  on conceding early goals : `` after last saturday 's experience we do n't want to concede two goals . 
  the fact we have players to change the course of the game has been a big advantage . 
  bringing chicharito on was good for us . 
  `` hopefully we are going to defend better . 
  it 's frustrating there is no consistent theme to what is happening defensively . 
  we have players who can change the course of the game and we have a scoring threat . 
  but we ca n't continue to give teams a headstart . '', 
  on recent unbeaten run : `` it 's good to get momentum . 
  to win the league you need that momentum . 
  in the past we 've gone 20 games without losing . 
  at the moment it 's only five . 
  there 's a long way to go and it 's a tough league , but we are certainly well equipped . '',

  20:58 sir alex on making changes : `` we 're in a great position . 
  we 've qualified so this is a matter that we play with some pride tomorrow and we have to be fair to the other teams in the group . 
  we 're making a lot of changes but the younger players all need games . 
  and they have the experience to handle the situation tomorrow . '', 
  21:00 sir alex confirms phil jones will start against galatasaray , but reveals shinji kagawa is still about `` four weeks '' from a return . 
  `` it 's a big day for phil jones . 
  he 's been out all season . 
  he 's done enough training to make sure his fitness is okay . 
  i 'm looking forward to bringing him back . 
  shinji 's progress has been quite slow actually . 
  he 's not started any outside work and we 're looking at another four weeks , which is disappointing . 
  originally we thought three or four weeks - now it looks like seven or eight weeks . '', 
  21:03 sir alex says the champions league is getting stronger all the time . 
  `` i think it 's tough . 
  you see some surprise results - celtic beat barcelona . 
  bate beat bayern munich . 
  these are all indications that the quality of the champions league is improving . '', 
  21:06 darren fletcher has joined sir alex at the press conference and has just been asked about the hostile atmosphere awaiting united on tuesday evening . 
  `` it 'll be hostile - they are really passionate [ fans ] . 
  i 've not played against galatasaray but i 've been to bursaspor and besiktas and it 's a unique atmosphere . 
  it 's a challenge and something we have to experience . 
  for me it 's a new stadium , a new occasion and you want to enjoy the experience . 
  hopefully that brings out the best in your performance . '', 
  21:08 sir alex is confident his young players can handle the occasion inside the turk telekom arena . 
  `` most of them , apart from nick powell , will have experience of big games . 
  maybe alexander buttner too . 
  but they 're used to playing in front of big crowds . 
  obviously for nick powell it 's completely different - he 's played in front of 76,000 as a substitute but this will be his first european away game . 
  it will be a big day for him but he has the temperament , which is important . 
  `` we do n't consider the young players a gamble . 
  what we do consider is our reputation and we have to be fair to the other teams in the group . 
  when we discussed the team for tomorrow we had to give serious consideration to how the media and the public would react , so we had to think hard about the team we picked . '', 
  21:10 sir alex says club are now used to the fanatical support of turkish football fans . 
  `` we did n't get the greeting by the fans [ this time ] - we dodged that . 
  in 1993 when we came here it was incredible . 
  it was quite frightening . 
  it was something new . 
  we 've been here a few times since so we 're getting used to the turkish fanaticism and enthusiasm . 
  it 's no issue for us . '', 
  21:12 the boss was asked again about the possibility of re-signing cristiano ronaldo following his quotes in yesterday papers . 
  he joked : `` that 's a christmas wish ! '', 
  21:13 sir alex 's final thoughts on tuesday 's game were simple : `` we 'll go out to win . 
  there 's no other way for us . '',

  ** team news **, 
  `` wayne rooney is fit and has been training all week which is good for us . 
  jonny evans will hopefully train today but i do n't know if he will be available . 
  smalling should be available . 
  he had a small shoulder injury the other night . 
  i wanted to play jones anyway and he did very well in his first game . 
  nani is not available yet .
