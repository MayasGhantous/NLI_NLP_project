  ** on qpr , norwich and the league **, 
  `` hopefully we can get back on track tomorrow after the disappointment of last week against norwich . 
  we want to get some momentum going up to the new year so winning games now is important . 
  i have n't seen a team run as hard as norwich did in my life last week . 
  they deserve full credit for that . '', 
  ** on chelsea **, 
  `` everyone feels for roberto di matteo . 
  quite rightly too . 
  it 's amazing when you consider he 's won the champions league . 
  you would have thought they would have waited to let the guy try and win a club world cup . 
  a few weeks ago we were thinking it would be a three-horse title race . 
  that 's not out of the question . 
  chelsea have a big squad and lots of experience and they 've brought in a couple of young players in hazard and oscar . 
  they have a sprinkling of youth coming through too . 
  you ca n't dismiss them . 
  benitez has been trying to get a job for a long time - i hope he 's lucky on sunday too ! '',

  09:45 here are the main team news points from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  - nani will be out for 4-5 weeks with a hamstring injury, 
  - valencia still out with a hip injury but should be fit for next week, 
  - nick powell has had a virus but should be okay for tomorrow, 
  - paul scholes is back from suspension, 
  - ryan giggs had a slight hamstring strain but should be ok, 
  - nemanja vidic has started training again, 
  so nani aside , the news is largely positive and the boss will have plenty of options for tomorrow 's trip to reading . 
  09:47 the manager went on to say about nemanja vidic 's return date : `` it would be nice to play him on wednesday in the champions league game against cluj . 
  i would n't be adverse to playing him . '', 
  wow , that 's earlier than we anticipated for a comeback . 
  great to hear . 
  unless you 're a cluj fan , or a man city supporter come to think of it . 
  sir alex : `` scholes is back from suspension . 
  it 's quite late for scholesy to get a suspension -- it 's usually about october ! '', 
  [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ibk8srgtm8 ), 
  14:00 the main points from the press conference are as follows :, 
  sir alex : `` i do n't think nemanja [ vidic ] will play . 
  he feels he needs another few days ' training so he wo n't be available . 
  he 's not far away . 
  he 's training well now but i think another few days will bring him on better . 
  if he does n't play tomorrow there 's no chance he 'll play in the derby game . '', 
  14:02 sir alex on the defence : `` i think we 're getting punished when the ball 's going into our box at the moment . 
  but we should be defending far better . 
  albeit , reading produced some fantastic balls into the box . 
  we should be expecting better . 
  it 's a worry . 
  if we perform like that on sunday then god knows what 's going to happen to us . 
  when you see the goals against - we 've lost 32 already - i ca n't remember us losing so many goals before christmas . 
  it 's a concern , there 's no question about that . 
  when you see city have balotelli , dzeko - all really tall players - it 's going to be a big challenge . 
  but that 's on sunday . 
  tomorrow we 've got a different game . '', 
  14:08 the boss on team selection : `` we 'll rest some players tomorrow , as we did against galatasaray . 
  but we have to be fair to all the teams who are trying to reach important positions - whether that 's the champions league or the europa league . 
  in that respect , we 'll play a team that we expect will win . 
  but there will be changes . '', 
  14:10 sir alex on the situation in group h : `` the situation cluj are in is that they lost to galatasaray at home , which puts galatasaray in a stronger position . 
  but cluj still have an opportunity if they beat us tomorrow . 
  it 's very tight - there 's not much between all three other teams . 
  that 's been shown in the tightness of the group . '', 
  14:16 sir alex on rooney : `` wayne needs to play a lot of games to get his match-fitness up . 
  he 's a strong built lad and when he misses two games it takes him three games to come back . 
  it 's the way he 's always been . 
  he 'll play tomorrow night and hopefully that brings him on further . 
  on saturday , that was his best performance of the season so far . '', 
  14:14 sir alex says shinji kagawa is making progress : `` kagawa started running today . 
  he may make the bench [ against city ] . 
  obviously nani and valencia are still out and that 's why i played rooney on wide right .
