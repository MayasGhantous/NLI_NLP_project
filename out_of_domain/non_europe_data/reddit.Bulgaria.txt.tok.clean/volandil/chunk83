  i thought it was his best performance of the season . 
  against cluj i 'm picking a team without any thought of manchester city . 
  it 's a matter of who needs a game . '', 
  here are the main updates from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  ** team news : ** `` nemanja vidic is back in the squad tomorrow . 
  jonny evans is out with the hamstring injury from last week . 
  chris smalling came on and did very well . 
  shinji kagawa is back in training and doing very well . 
  nani is still out . '', 
  ** on vidic 's return : ** `` it 's a big , big win to have him back in the squad -- his ability to head the ball , his captaincy . 
  we hope we 've given him the proper rehab . 
  we 'll give him a chance and we hope he sails through it . 
  i do n't know whether he will start tomorrow -- he 's only played about 10 games in the last 12 months , which is not like nemanja . '', 
  ** on last season 's finale at sunderland : ** `` their fans ' reaction on the last day was disappointing . 
  when you think about the players we 've given them over the years , including evans and simpson , who helped them win promotion . 
  i do n't think it was malicious from their fans , just foolishness ; they were just enjoying the moment . '', 
  ** on martin o'neill : ** `` he was asked last week if he still has self-belief . 
  that was an insult to him , after the success he 's had with celtic and aston villa , for example . 
  what a silly question . '', 
  ** on being top of the league : ** `` i 'm happy with six points . 
  it 's city 's challenge to try and catch us . 
  if we can keep our players fit , it will give us a better chance . 
  we 've got a heavy programme of fixtures -- if we can negotiate that and still be top , we 'll be delighted . '',

  friday 21 december, 
  12:23 here are the main updates from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  ** team news : ** `` rafael is still out with a hamstring injury , nani is still injured . 
  vidic might not be ready to start . 
  evans is fit and kagawa takes training with the first team on monday . 
  vida is doing great in training , it 's just a matter of picking the time to bring him back . 
  it gives me options with smalling , jones , ferdinand and evans . '', 
  ** on jonny evans ' new contract : ** `` we 're very happy . 
  it 's keeping with our normal policy of players getting into their second last-year of their contract . 
  we 're delighted . 
  he 's had a fantastic career for us and is progressing all the time . 
  he had one or two injury situations but hopefully they 're behind him now . '', 
  ** on swansea : ** `` you 've seen the results they have had and the progress they have made as a football club over the last years . 
  the important thing for me is they try to play and have the courage to play their football , which is good . '', 
  ** on the festive fixture list : ** `` this time of year , all the games are challenges and they come thick and fast now up to the cup tie on 5 january . 
  utilising the squad will be important , as will picking the right team , but hopefully we can get through it and be in the same position as we are now . '', 
  ** sir alex ferguson has dismissed newspaper speculation that paul scholes has already decided to quit at the end of the season . 
  the reports claimed the midfielder had told friends he was hanging up his boots - for good this time - after coming out of retirement last term . 
  the manager is sceptical about the rumours as he has yet to have his own conversation on the subject with the veteran playmaker . 
  `` it 's interesting that as scholesy says very little so i 'm surprised if he spoke to some pal before he spoke to me , which he has n't done , '' said sir alex at his weekly press conference . 
  `` so you can dismiss that . '', 
  the manager also responded to the suggestion that ryan giggs and rio ferdinand will also depart next summer . 
  `` i think giggs can play for another year or two years and rio 's form has been fantastic , '' he opined . 
  `` it 's that type of speculaion you expect with people on one-year contracts but i would n't give it too much credence . '',

  danny welbeck and ashley young could return for saturday 's visit of west brom but sir alex ferguson will assess the fitness of his squad after the midweek exertions against newcastle . 
  the attacking pair missed out on the 4-3 boxing day thriller but , with shinji kagawa also a possible inclusion as a substitute , there should be more forward options open to the boss . 
  wayne rooney 's injury is improving but he will again miss out while ryan giggs is unlikely to feature despite his superb second-half display against the magpies . 
  `` i ca n't give you an update on the injuries as it 's only two days on from wednesday and there were issues with a soft , tiring pitch , '' sir alex said at his press conference . 
  `` we need to assess players like paul scholes and ryan giggs as i think , at their age , it took a lot out of them . 
  `` we 're hoping maybe young will be ready and daniel welbeck should be ready . 
  he was ill on tuesday night but i think he should be okay . 
  at least that 's a couple of bodies back fresh for us . 
  we 'll just assess the rest in terms of tiredness . 
  `` all the players are key now as we 're picking up one or two injuries . 
  rooney is out for at least another two games . 
  he was a bit better yesterday . 
  we 're going to assess phil jones but i do n't think he 'll be ready . 
  `` shinji kagawa wanted to do a warm-up and training on the pitch and he is gettiing close . 
  i 'll see what he 's like today and i could maybe put him on the bench tomorrow depending on who is, 
  available . 
  `` the most important thing is to assess the tiredness and also the fitness of one or two others . '', 
  ** [ on giggs ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2012/dec/sir-alex-ferguson-cannot-understand-giggs-criticism.aspx ) **, 
  sir alex ferguson admits he is running out of superlatives to describe ryan giggs after the 39-year-old rolled back the years again in the win against newcastle . 
  the welshman was a driving force as united collected three valuable points on boxing day and , such were his exertions , that he is unlikely to be available for the clash against west brom on saturday . 
  the reds boss is puzzled by any criticism of his loyal servant and feels giggs often defies belief with his longevity . 
  `` how can you a criticise a player who has given you 20 years ? '', 
  asked sir alex. 
  `` the problem for a player with ryan 's pride and experience is he probably wants to play more so he loses that game-play time that gives him consistency . 
  `` at his age , i ca n't afford to risk that though . 
  `` i do n't think i 'll play him tomorrow simply because of the energy he spent on wednesday night to help win the match for us . 
  it is simply beyond belief how you can criticise him . 
  i do n't understand it . '', 
  ** [ fergie on pardew and newcastle ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/dec/28/sir-alex-ferguson-alan-pardew ) ** :, 
  pardew said on thursday that ferguson 's conduct was worthy of a dismissal , adding that dean will have been `` slightly disappointed '' he did not take action at the time . 
  on friday , ferguson hit back . 
  `` alan pardew has come out and criticised me , '' he said . 
  `` he is the worst at haranguing referees . 
  he shoves them and makes a joke of it . 
  how he can criticise me is unbelievable . 
  he forgets the help i gave him , by the way . 
  `` i was demonstrative but i was not out of order . 
  the press have had a field day . 
  ** the only person they have not spoken to is barack obama because he is busy ** . 
  it is unfortunate but i am the manager of the most famous club in the world . 
  ** not newcastle , a wee club in the north east . 
  `` i was demonstrative . 
  i am always demonstrative . 
  everyone knows that . 
  i am an emotional guy . 
  but i was not abusive . 
  i shouted mike over . 
  we walked towards each other . 
  i was only on [ the pitch ] three or four yards . 
  that has been overplayed .
