  `` wayne rooney is still injured . 
  i 'm surprised , it 's been longer than we thought it would be . 
  he was meant to be back training but he 's not . 
  it 's nothing serious but it looks like he 's going to be out for another two weeks or so . 
  ** nani is expected to start training today ** , and ** phil jones is available ** against west ham . 
  everyone else is ok i think . 
  ** rooney wo n't be fit for liverpool ** . 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's nothing serious , he just got clipped behind his knee . 
  nothing shows in the scan but he 's still feeling it . 
  hopefully in two weeks it 'll be sorted but nonetheless it 's a loss . '', 
  ** west ham in the cup **, 
  `` we 've had some really difficult ties over last three or four years . 
  you hope first of all you 're going to be at home in the draw , then you want a draw you can get through . 
  but this is a particularly hard one , they 're in good form and they 're at home . 
  sam [ allardyce ] has done great job there getting them promoted first of all . 
  it 's not easy to bounce right back but they 've done well and their form has been very good . 
  they 've had some excellent results . 
  so it 's going to be a tough game . 
  i do n't think we 'll make too many changes . 
  i think we 'll more or less play a strong team and hopefully we 'll get through . '',

  wayne rooney is set to miss manchester united 's fa cup tie at west ham this weekend - and the home league clash with liverpool next sunday - after sir alex ferguson announced a longer than anticipated absence . 
  `` wayne 's still injured , and it looks like going to be out another two weeks or so '' said sir alex at friday 's pre-match press conference . 
  `` it 's a surprise as he was meant to be back training now . 
  so he 'll be out for longer than we thought and i do n't think he will be fit for the liverpool match . 
  `` the injury is nothing serious . 
  he just got clipped behind his knee . 
  nothing shows in the scan but he 's still feeling it . 
  hopefully in two weeks it 'll be sorted but nonetheless it 's a loss . '', 
  the better team news from the boss included nani being `` expected to start training today '' and phil jones being available for the saturday tea-time trip to upton park . 
  darren fletcher 's inclusion , meanwhile , could depend on the state of west ham 's pitch . 
  `` the ground has been really heavy recently and i do n't think the pitches have suited him . 
  i 've explained that to him . 
  `` but we 're in good shape now with good options . 
  we 've utilised the squad very well in the last few weeks . '',

  ** team news **, 
  wayne 's still out . 
  i 'm hoping he starts training today , in which case he wo n't be far away . 
  i do n't think it 's a big issue but it will help him along . 
  the injury is quite straightforward so if he starts today we should have him available for wednesday 's game . 
  nani 's back in training and will be in the squad on sunday . 
  phil jones is back , although i think wednesday is more likely for him . 
  anderson has been back training for 10 days so he 'll be in the squad on sunday . 
  all in all , we 're in a healthy situation . 
  how long it will last i do n't know but it 's good to have them back . 
  ** liverpool preview **, 
  it 's a derby game - it 's intense , emotional . 
  everything you can think of in a derby game will be there on sunday . 
  we go into the game in reasonable form . 
  i obviously made changes last sunday - carrick and evra had a rest after a full contribution in december . 
  robin van persie came on and scored an unbelievable goal . 
  he 's available . 
  ** transfers **, 
  there 's nothing to report !, 
  it 's january , what can i say ? 
  i know you 're desperate for a story but there 's no story . 
  i 've got nothing to tell you .

  sir alex ferguson has confirmed both nani and anderson will be in the squad for the clash with liverpool at old trafford on sunday . 
  phil jones is also fit again , but sir alex says he is more likely to be involved in wednesday 's fa cup replay against west ham . 
  wayne rooney could make a return against the hammers as well having missed the last four games after picking up a knee injury . 
  `` i 'm hoping wayne will start training today actually , in which case he wo n't be far away , '' the boss told reporters on friday . 
  `` i do n't think it 's a big issue but it will help him along .
