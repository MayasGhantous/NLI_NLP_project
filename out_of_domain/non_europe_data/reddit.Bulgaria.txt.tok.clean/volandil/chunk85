  ** on dimitar berbatov : ** `` berbatov is fulham 's best player .

  at his age it 's not easy to be not playing when i have lots of choices . 
  he wanted first-team football and it was the right thing to do . 
  i think he 's doing well there . '', 
  here are the main points from sir alex 's pre-fulham press conference :, 
  * ashley young is still out but jonny evans should return to training today and rio ferdinand will definitely start at craven cottage . 
  `` we 're quite healthy in terms of the players available , '' states the manager . 
  * the boss is surprised phil jones is in the england under-21 squad rather than the seniors . 
  `` i have n't paid much attention to it , '' he says , quashing newspaper talk that he is furious at the call-up . 
  * work is continuing in a bid to improve the old trafford pitch . 
  `` it has n't been the same since that game against newcastle and the deluge of rain . '', 
  * sir alex does n't feel he needs to warn the players about complacency as he appreciates fulham played very well in midweek against west ham . 
  `` every game is treated the same way , '' he asserts . 
  * there is a call for the away fans to roar united on in the capital on saturday . 
  `` we get great support at fulham which is unusual in the modern day , '' he stresses , likening it to trips to wimbledon in the past . 
  ** [ here are the main points from sir alex 's press conference  ( http://www.manutd.com/en/fanzone/news-and-blogs/2013/feb/today-at-old-trafford-manchester-united-blog.aspx ) **, 
  * all the players are back fit from the internationals although we are still waiting on chicharito to return . 
  ashley young is back and phil jones ' illness is not as bad as was suggested by england under-21 boss stuart pearce . 
  * `` it 's a terrific spell for us and where we want to be , '' says the boss ahead of the everton and real madrid fixtures . 
  * everton will be `` tough '' as they 've only lost three times in the league all season and , of course , the 4-4 draw last term lost us the title , according to the manager . 
  he feels the toffees have a `` genuine chance '' of finishing in the top four . 
  * sir alex thinks there will be a problem in trying to enforce financial fair play . 
  ** [ young fit for everton ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/feb/sir-alex-ferguson-gives-team-news-ahead-of-united-v-everton.aspx ) **, 
  sir alex ferguson has declared ashley young fit for sunday 's clash with everton and played down fears over phil jones , who contracted shingles earlier this month . 
  speaking at his weekly press conference at carrington , the boss also confirmed the full fitness of the reds ' plethora of international stars , although he is yet to speak to javier ` chicharito ' hernandez after he took part in mexico 's 0-0 draw with jamaica on wednesday . 
  sunday 's match with the toffees offers united a chance to build on a nine point lead at the top of the barclays premier league , but after last season 's 4-4 draw at old trafford which subsequently contributed to losing the title , sir alex is taking nothing for granted . 
  `` everton are very experienced and they 've only lost three games this season , '' the boss told reporters . 
  `` our memory of last season is disappointing - we lost the title versus everton !, 
  `` but we 're playing well , i 'm pleased with our form . 
  i 'm changing the team around and everyone who has played has done well , which creates competition . '', 
  ** [ sir alex wary of everton threat ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/feb/everton-preview-sir-alex-no-repeat-of-last-season.aspx ) **, 
  sir alex ferguson is determined not to witness a repeat of last season 's home game against everton when the toffees visit old trafford on sunday . 
  on that occasion , a victory would have almost certainly secured a 20th premier league title , but the reds threw away a 4-2 lead in the dying stages of the game to come away with only a point . 
  and although united are currently flying high , on a 13-game unbeaten run in all competitions , the united manager says the reds can expect a similarly tough encounter this weekend . 
  `` it 's a tough game on sunday , '' sir alex said at his pre-match press conference . 
  `` we were 4-2 up with seven or eight minutes to go . 
  it was unexpected and we have to anticipate the unexpected in the run-in . 
  that was a bad blow for us and it cost us the league . 
  `` everton are very experienced and , if you look at their record , they 've only lost three games this season [ the same number as united ] . 
  they 're obviously hard to beat . 
  `` but the team is playing well , i 'm pleased with their form and i 'm pleased that the players we 're changing around , when i 'm making different team selections , are buying into it well . 
  `` they 're all contributing in their own way and that gives us a better chance in terms of dealing with the various competitions we 're in now . '', 
  united began the 2012/13 season with defeat away at everton , on a night in which toffees target man marouane fellaini caused the reds ' defensive line untold problems . 
  full-back leighton baines has also drawn widespread praise this term for his performances . 
  but they 're not the only everton players sir alex 's men will need to monitor on sunday . 
  '' [ there 's also ] players like pienaar , who 's been really good since he came back from spurs . 
  he 's actually improved since he came back from his short spell at tottenham . 
  `` nikica jelavic had a great season last season and is in a bit of a lull at the moment in terms of his goals . 
  now they 've brought the big lad on , victor anichebe , and he 's a different player to jelavic . 
  `` you also look at the experience and consistency they 've got at the back with silvain distin , tim howard , phil jagielka and phil neville . 
  they play every week so they 've got a good unit there .
