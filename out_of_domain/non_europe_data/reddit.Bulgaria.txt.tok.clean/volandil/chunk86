  `` david moyes has made gradual progress because when he first took over i do n't think he had any money to spend , i do n't think he had a squad anything like what he has now . 
  given time you can do these things and i think that 's a great value that everton have got out of david -- each year he has progressed to good levels . 
  `` they 're challenging for a top-four place now . 
  i think they have a genuine chance of being in the top four . '',

  saf , phil neville and david gill in attendance at moss lane, 
  ** kick off **, 
  ** 5 ' ** - good cross from the right by veseli but tunnicliffe fails to connect to it .

  ** 19 ' ** - tom thorpe with a free header from a corner , but an arsenal defender clears it . 
  ** 21 ' ** - ** goal ** for mufc . 
  ** lingard ** finishes off a brilliant counter attacking move . 
  * dat counter !, 
  ** 25 ' ** - woodwork !!, 
  vermijl combines nice on the left wing , cuts inside , crosses to tunnicliffe who volleys into the woodwork and into out . 
  beautiful football from our young guns !, 
  ** 29 ' ** - ** goal ** for arsenal . 
  amos only manages to parry a shot from distance and ** akpom ** scores the rebound . 
  ** 31 ' ** - united try to respond quickly and a free kick is barely cleared by arsenal , appeals for a handball from united players , but they 're waved on by the ref . 
  ** 36 ' ** - ** sub mufc ** - mcginty replaces veseli ( who seems to have picked an injury ), 
  ** 45 +2 ' ** - afc 's number 7 shoots from the edge of the area just wide , decent shot . 
  ** half time ** - entertaining game , both teams dangerous on the attack . 
  fare result so far . 
  ** second half ** is under way . 
  ** 47 ' ** - early afc pressure wins them a corner , but it 's cleared safely away . 
  ** 52 ' ** - afc continue to be productive , a free kick goes out for a corner , the corner is dealt with by the united defense . 
  ** 60 ' ** - ** yellow card ** for ben amos , who was outside his penalty area trying to head out a long ball , but caught the arsenal player with his elbow . 
  results in a free kick for afc in a very dangerous position . 
  ** 62 ' ** - poor freekick from arsenal and it 's out . 
  ** 64 ' ** - now united have a fk in a good position , near the corner flag . 
  lots of bodies in the area but it 's cleared . 
  ** 70 ' ** - akpom almost gets his hattrick , but his header is just above the cross bar . 
  danger man . 
  ** 80 ' ** - 10 minutes to go , tempo a bit slower now , arsenal having most of the possession and united looking for a quick break, 
  ** 87 ' ** - ** yellow card ** for januzaj , who chases after an arsenal striker that 's getting away and fouls him just in front of the penalty area . 
  freekick is close , but wide . 
  ** full time - 2:2 ** fair result . 
  * i 'll try to update this thread as the game progresses , but might have to run out at some point *, 
  ** [ from the `` today at madrid '' blog ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/fanzone/news-and-blogs/2013/feb/today-in-madrid.aspx ) **, 
  tuesday 12 february ( all times are local , spain is 1 hour ahead of gmt ), 
  19:11 sir alex : `` it 's a fantastic challenge and a great challenge for two clubs who embrace the best parts of football . 
  both have great reputations . 
  i have everyone fit and i 'm looking forward to it . '', 
  19:15 the boss also describes cristiano ronaldo as `` phenomenal '' . 
  he says : `` ronaldo is a better player than when he left us because of his maturity . 
  he 's at the peak of his career now and the next three years will be the same . 
  i never thought he 'd ever get the amout of goals he 's scored . 
  to score the goals he has scored is phenomenal . '', 
  19:15 sir alex : `` i think it 's a good time to be playing real madrid . 
  we 've got a fantastic lead in the league and we have everyone fit . 
  when you come to this part of the season you usually have one or two or three players injured . 
  we do n't have that , which is a bonus . '', 
  19:16 sir alex is positive about the reds ' chances , not just tomorrow night but for the rest of the season : `` our team is capable of winning the champions league . 
  there 's a great spirit about them . 
  the reality is that this team does n't know when it 's beaten , which is a great quality . 
  the acid test is tomorrow and we have to get through it if we are to win this trophy . '', 
  19:20 david de gea is alongside sir alex in madrid , and the boss has just launched a staunch defence of his goalkeeper . 
  `` david has shown his character because he has taken a lot of critisicm and sometimes unfair criticism . 
  what we 're good at is developing people . 
  bit by bit it 's a like a young kid moving forward -- he wobbles , gets up , wolbbles , gets up again and now he 's walking . '', 
  19:22 the manager says it 's possible jose mourinho will finish his career as the most successful manager ever . 
  `` i think it 's very possible . 
  he 's won the european cup twice with two different teams . 
  he 's won the eruopa league , the treble in milan ... 
  he 's won a lot of trophies for a young man and it 's possible he could beat my record . '', 
  19:24 sir alex reveals shinji kagawa will feature at some point tomorrow . 
  `` we did n't play shinji on sunday because he had a long trip back from japan . 
  i wanted him fresh in case i decide to use him tomorrow so i rested him on sunday . 
  he will certainly be involved at some stage tomorrow . '', 
  19:26 the boss is confident the game wo n't end up 0-0 . 
  `` i can assure you of that , '' he says . 
  `` it can live up to expectations . 
  history always plays a part in these types of games , as well as the two teams ' desire to go forward . 
  it 's a shame we 're meeting this early in the competition . 
  i wish it had been at wembley [ in the final ] . '', 
  19:28 sir alex admits tomorrow night 's match is `` special '' . 
  `` since the champions league started , almost every year we seem to play one of the biggest clubs in the world . 
  when i started as a coach many years ago i dreamt i 'd be playing against the top teams as a manager and you get the opportunity to do that in the champions league on a regular basis . 
  there is a special significance when you play the big teams and you 'll see that tomorrow . '', 
  19:30 reds striker wayne rooney was described as `` a hooligan '' by spanish paper marca today . 
  sir alex responds : `` rooney is a mature player now at 27 . 
  his goalscoring has been very consistent over the last few years . 
  he can play different positions with a great enthusiasm . 
  what can i say ? 
  the boy is a terrific player and he has great desire . 
  i 'm not interested in what a spanish paper says . '', 
  19:33 the manager admits cristiano ronaldo is real 's biggest threat but warns against complacency when it comes to madrid 's other players .
