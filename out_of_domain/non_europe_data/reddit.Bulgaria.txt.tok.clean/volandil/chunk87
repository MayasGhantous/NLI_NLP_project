  `` ronaldo is the one i worry about , but you ca n't dismiss they have a good team and good players in other positions . '', 
  as for ronaldo 's qualities , he says : `` the old ronaldo as a young player was one of the best . 
  i do n't think he was a top player when he came to madrid . 
  cristiano 's fitness , speed , goals ... and he 's never injured . 
  he wants to play all the time . 
  like lionel messi , he 's never injured . 
  both have exceptional qualities . '', 
  ** [ we can rule europe ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/feb/sir-alex-ferguson-says-manchester-united-can-win-champions-league.aspx ) ** - [ sir alex ferguson at the santiago bernabeau press conference ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xad7jhd.jpg ), 
  sir alex ferguson says manchester united can win the champions league this season - if the reds can next knock out one of the favourites in real madrid . 
  the runaway leaders of the english league lined up wednesday 's clash with the spanish champions by racing through the group stage , qualifying well before christmas with a couple of games to spare . 
  sir alex 's men have since demonstrated their powers on the domestic stage , going 12 points clear of manchester city in the table and marching into the last 16 of the fa cup . 
  `` our team is capable of winning the champions league , '' said sir alex at a pre-match press conference in madrid . 
  `` there is a great spirit about them . 
  people keep saying we 're not as good as past united teams but sometimes we get foggy impressions about the past and i do so myself at times . 
  `` the reality is this team does n't know when it 's beaten which is a great quality . 
  `` the acid test is tomorrow and we have to get through it if we are to win this trophy . '', 
  the united boss is buoyed not only by form , but by the fitness of his squad with paul scholes the only notable absentee from the plane to spain . 
  `` i think it 's a good time for us to be playing real madrid , '' said sir alex. 
  `` we have a fantastic lead in our league and we have everyone fit . 
  when you come to this part of the season you [ often ] have two or three players injured . 
  we do n't have that , which is a bonus . 
  `` we 're ready for tomorrow . 
  since the champions league started , almost every year we have played one of the biggest clubs in the world . 
  `` when i started as a coach many years ago , i dreamt i 'd be playing against the top teams as a manager and you get the opportunity to do that in the champions league on a regular basis . 
  `` there is a special significance when you play the big teams and you 'll see that tomorrow . 
  it wo n't be 0-0 tomorrow night , i can assure you of that . 
  this match can live up to expectations . 
  history always plays a part in this type of the games and the two teams ' desires to go forward . 
  `` it 's just a shame we 're meeting this early . 
  i wish it had been at wembley , in the final . '', 
  friday 15 february, 
  09:50 here are the main points from this morning 's press conference :, 
  * there are no injuries from midweek but sir alex will make changes for monday night 's fa cup tie against reading . 
  `` it 's an incentive to get to the quarter-final . 
  whatever side i pick , i expect to qualify . '', 
  * nothing will be taken for granted against a reading side in decent form . 
  `` in the fa cup , you always expect the unexpected . '', 
  * the centre-back situation involving jonny eans , rio ferdinand and nemanja vidic is being managed . 
  `` three days after everton was a risk , '' admits the boss regarding vidic 's non-involvement at the bernabeu while evans ' consistency is praised . 
  * the manager does not expect goalkeepers to properly mature until their mid-twenties , although there are a few exceptions . 
  patience is preached for both david de gea and also midfielder tom cleverley who is `` an important member of our squad '' . 
  * rotation will be the name of the game for the upcoming fixtures with reading , qpr , norwich and real . 
  `` it 's not easy to rotate but it has to be done . 
  the biggest responsibility lies with myself in picking the right team . '',

  ** injury update **, 
  phil jones is the one we 're concerned about for the real madrid game . 
  we 're working hard on it and i 'd say he has an outside chance - no more than that . 
  we 'll have to wait and see if he 's fit for the second leg . 
  it 's two weeks away . 
  a lot can happen . 
  he 's an outside chance , that 's all . 
  other than that , everybody 's fit . 
  ** [ more on phil jones @ manutd.com ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/feb/sir-alex-previews-qpr-v-manchester-united.aspx ) **, 
  ** team selection v qpr **, 
  we have a problem picking teams at the moment but that 's where we want to be . 
  qpr are fighting for survival and we know it 's going to be a hard game . 
  that 's what we need - we need to make sure we do our job right . 
  the fact is , city will drop points too . 
  that 's where we are , coming into the run-in . 
  we expect to drop a few points but so will they . 
  to be honest , it 's always a hard run-in in the premier league . 
  with the right attitude and the right players we have a chance .

  ** david gill 's impending departure **, 
  he spoke to me some weeks ago and i was surprised . 
  i understand where he 's coming from , though . 
  he has other challenges , and i think he 'll do fantastic at uefa . 
  i think he 'll contribute to the game in general and have an influence on football . 
  there 's a good stability here . 
  the foundations david 's laid down ... it 's easy to carry on from that . 
  there 's a template we can follow and i think that 's what ed [ woodward ] will do . 
  the job is to support the manager and staff so we can maintain the success we have . 
  i do n't think that should change that much . 
  we had a good relationship and i used to wind [ david ] up . 
  we had a lot of arguments and i 'd say , `` you know what your problem is ? 
  you 're an accountant ! '', 
  but david was straight as a dice , it 's always black and white . 
  it 's a great quality .
