  first breaking news is already out : [ ryan giggs signs contract extension ] ( http://redd.it/19ge84 ), 
  ** robin van persie ** is fit for saturday after overcoming his hip injury but ** phil jones ** is out . 
  the england international has a ` fighting chance ' of making tuesday 's champions league tie . 
  ** sir alex ** insists the players are not even thinking about midweek yet . 
  they have all been told to focus on getting the three points against the canaries . 
  the news of ryan giggs signing a new one-year contract inevitably dominated the press conference this morning . 
  here are some of the main points :, 
  * ryan will be involved against norwich and real madrid , says the boss . 
  he and paul scholes will stay involved with the club after they retire like nicky butt , brian mcclair etc. 
  * the boss does not think anybody will match ryan 's achievements in the game . 
  * despite some newspaper talk on friday morning , sir alex hopes that any director 's role at old trafford will be a ` long way off ' for him as he continues managing the side and competing for trophies . 
  [ there is some interest in the press conference ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fjqoizp.jpg ), 
  here are main points from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  - '' ** phil jones ** is not fit and wo n't be available for tomorrow . 
  `` it 's a blow , but it 's not something we ca n't manage . 
  we have options . 
  hopefully i get it right . 
  we must trust the players . 
  that 's what we always do and they must trust each other . '', 
  - '' ** ryan giggs ** will be involved at some point tomorrow , either as a starter or on the bench . 
  i have n't made my mind up yet . 
  he 'll be important to us . '', 
  - `` the three centre-backs [ ** vidic ** , ** ferdinand ** , ** evans ** ] are playing well . 
  it 's a good problem for me to have . 
  i 'll make that decision tomorrow [ about which two play ] . 
  i could n't be happier with the three of them . '', 
  - `` i think there will be goals tomorrow . 
  i think both teams will score , but we have to think we can score more than them . '', 
  - `` there has been a massive build-up . 
  you can see from the number of photographers at the training ground today - that an indication of how important a game it is for both clubs . 
  it 's an occasion you always want to have and that 's the beauty of the champions league , you have the opportunity each year to play against one of the big teams from europe . 
  tomorow is one of the biggest . '', 
  - `` i think both teams are in form . 
  real had two fantastic performances against barcelona and found form at the right time for a game of this nature . 
  our form been consistent for quite a while which we need tomorrow . 
  i do n't think it gets any bigger than this for a euoropean night . 
  it 's set up to be a potentilally marvellous game - i do n't think we 'll be disappointed . '', 
  - `` my biggest concern about ronaldo is that he turns up ! '', 
  - on rvp : `` he , like the rest of us would like to win things , lots of desire in team to achieve . 
  he has good chance this year . 
  rvp has been fantastic since he 's been here and there 's no doubt he has improved our chances of winning things . '', 
  giggs : `` it was strange going on at bernabeu and realised their fans gave me a good reception ... but i was focused on game at time ... '', 
  `` afterwards i realised it was a big compliment and i thank the madrid fans for that ... '', 
  ryan giggs says he is `` proud '' to have played so many games ahead of his 1000th competitive appearance . 
  he also said he has enjoyed things more and tried to take things in more as he 's got older . 
  sir alex was asked the ( now regular ) question about who is going to replace him when he leaves and whether it would be jose mourinho . 
  the boss smiled and said : `` it 's impossible to say who will replace me because there is no time factor on it . '',

  ** [ here are the key points from sir alex 's press conference at carrington this morning ... ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/fanzone/news-and-blogs/2013/mar/today-at-old-trafford-manchester-united-blog.aspx ) **, 
  * ** [ on wayne rooney ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/mar/sir-alex-ferguson-sets-record-straight-regarding-wayne-rooney.aspx ) **, 
  or do you want to talk sense ? 
  the issue you 're all going on about is rubbish . 
  there 's absolutely no issue between wayne rooney and i. 
  the suggestion we do n't talk on the training ground is nonsense . 
  the decision to not play him was purely tactical and he understood that . 
  wayne will be here next year . 
  you have my word on that . 
  * ** [ on refereeing decisions and defeat to real ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/mar/sir-alex-offers-team-news-ahead-of-united-v-chelsea.aspx ) **, 
  it 's hard to keep your faith when you see what 's happened the last few years . 
  it 's the third time we 've been knocked out because of that . 
  it 's not easy to take but we 're manchester united and we have to get on with it . 
  we now have an important issue of an fa cup tie on sunday . 
  my job is to galvanise the troops , who were fantastic on tuesday . 
  so were the fans . 
  we owe them a good performance . 
  * ** chelsea on sunday **, 
  it 's a home draw and i always say that if you get a home draw you 're happy . 
  hopefully we can navigate that and get through . 
  giggs wo n't play on sunday because he was the best player on the pitch on tuesday . 
  he 's done his bit for us this week . 
  now we 'll rest him and prepare him for next week . 
  phil jones wo n't be ready for sunday . 
  he 'll be available for the following week , though .
