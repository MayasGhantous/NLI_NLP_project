  sir alex ferguson will carefully manage tiredness in his squad when selecting teams for the forthcoming matches against sunderland and chelsea over the easter weekend , but nani , paul scholes and phil jones have trained this week and could bolster united 's ranks . 
  the aftermath of an international break is a delicate time for managers , but sir alex was mostly `` very satisfied '' with the freshness of his players . 
  `` ** i do n't think there are any injuries from the internationals which is really good news ** , '' the boss told reporters on friday . 
  `` there 's a fair bit of tiredness and the answer to that is to make sure we get the energies back in their bodies . 
  so there 's the recovery side to it with not much training . 
  `` there was a fair bit of travel - chicharito and valencia only got in yesterday [ thursday ] afternoon and the english players got back at 5am . 
  other than that , we 're very satisfied . '', 
  having nani , jones and scholes available would be another boon for the boss . 
  `` ** nani , jones and scholes are all doing a little bit of training ** , '' he added . 
  `` hopefully it will give us a good strong squad to approach the two games on saturday and monday . 
  we 'll try and keep the momentum going with he run we 're in at the moment . 
  if we do that , monday will take care of itself . '', 
  ** [ no issues with black cats ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/mar/manchester-united-boss-sir-alex-ferguson-has-no-issues-with-sunderland-fans.aspx ) **, 
  sir alex ferguson insists he has forgiven sunderland 's supporters for their joyous reaction to sergio aguero 's last-gasp title winner last may . 
  with the reds concluding a 1-0 win at the stadium of light , there was an anxious wait for news to filter through from manchester and a section of the home fans went wild on hearing the dramatic update and even mirrored city 's ` poznan ' celebration . 
  it may have been hard to take at the time , and the boss was clearly still upset afterwards , but he has stressed that it is merely a reflection of modern football followers and not the black cats in isolation . 
  `` i think that 's modern society , '' he stated in friday 's press conference . 
  `` you see a lot of that with supporters ' reaction to many things . 
  i do n't think we can change that . 
  it was disappointing and it 's hard to take these things with the way it all panned out . 
  i thought we 'd won it for 20 seconds and it was snatched away from us . 
  `` there 's not any bitterness from my point of view . 
  it happens and we move on . 
  we 've dusted ourselves down and made a really good challenge in the league this year . 
  the concentration has been fantastic and the team spirit is really good . 
  so , in that respect , we 've answered it as best we can . 
  `` so i do n't have any issues with the sunderland fans . 
  i do n't think the sunderland fans wanted city to win it any more than we did . 
  it was just a fact that they were our opponents that day and it goes back to what i was saying about present society . 
  you see it with supporters every week . 
  wherever the fans are in opposite corners , they are venting their spleens at each other . 
  it 's what happens in modern-day football . '', 
  ** [ surprise return for bebe ] ( http://i.imgur.com/r8lw6zi.gif ) **, 
  unnamed but reliable source has revealed that bebe 's loan at rio ave has been urgently terminated and the footballer has been secretly flown into london last night . 
  he is expected to start against chelsea in the fa cup replay . 
  possible reason for this unorthodox decision by saf is the injury suffered by the preffered right winger valencia , who sprained an ankle while sprinting for the toilet at carrington . 
  manchester united are happy to announce a new kit sponsorship deal with the football association . 
  one of the last deals done by david gill will put the ` the fa ' and the famous ' 3 lions ' logo on the united shirts for the next 20 years . 
  financial details have not been disclosed yet , but rafael benitez was quoted in saying ' i knew it !, 
  it 's a facht ! ', 
  the financial analyzers are expecting another deal to be finalized soon , with mike riley 's `` professional game match officials board ( pgmob ) '' to be printed on training gear and the old trafford refreshment facilities . 
  sir alex also held two separate briefings with journalists for the sunday newspapers and the daily newspapers ( to be printed on monday ) so we can probably expect some different quotes to emerge on the eve of the big match and matchday itself . 
  the manchester derby is now the game that everybody wants to talk , write and read about . 
  here as promised are the main points , paraphrased , from sir alex 's press conference :, 
  ** team news : ** rooney and rafael started training this morning ( [ read more ... ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/apr/sir-alex-ferguson-delivers-team-news-for-manchester-derby.aspx ) ) and will hopefully be fit for monday . 
  evans and vidic are behind them but could return to training tomorrow or on saturday . 
  ** derby thoughts : ** sir alex says derbies are different to how they were a few years ago - `` we have to get used to playing manchester city in big games . '', 
  ** united 's form : ** the manager congratulates his players on their consistency after winning 25 of the first 30 games , an all-time record for englishtop-flight teams . 
  ** david de gea : ** sir alex feels his goalkeeper has developed and matured as the season has gone on . 
  `` next year he 'll be even better . '', 
  ** title race : ** the boss says united 's approach throughout the season , to simply win the next game , has been the correct one and will hopefully lead to winning the title . 
  but he warns there are still eight games left , so 24 points still to play for . 
  ** van persie : ** the manager does n't feel robin needs a rest and suggests that all strikers have `` dry spells '' in terms of goals . 
  ( [ read more ... ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/apr/sir-alex-press-conference-no-concern-with-van-persie-drought.aspx ) ) all strikers , that is , except for sir alex himself ... `` i had a spell at the start of one season when i did n't score until october - but i still ended up with 30-odd goals !

   `` as far as taking rooney off the other night , it was simple : he was n't playing as well as shinji was . 
  in so many games wayne is better than most players but on the night shinji was playing so well .
