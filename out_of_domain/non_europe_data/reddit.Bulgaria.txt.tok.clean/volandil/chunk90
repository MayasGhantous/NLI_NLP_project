   `` the ironic thing was , when we were chasing a goal with 14 minutes left , i decided to put chicharito on and shinji made the second goal . 
   `` i 'd already given the fourth official the card , chicha was standing on the touchline and then we scored the second goal . 
  i think if i 'd have changed my decision then we would have won it . 
   `` shinji was doing really well but unfortunately he came off . 
  chicha came on simply because you always think he 'll get a chance in the game . 
  at that point we wanted to win it and you make decisions like that that maybe are not fair . '', 
  ** praise for shinji ** :, 
   `` he 's doing very well for us now , '' sir alex added . 
  `` he has fantastic composure on the ball and his decision-making is good . 
  he has a good selection of passes ; he seems to always pick the more sensible pass . 
   `` and he made a terrific first goal . 
  there were a few involved in that build-up but he had the composure to take the player on in a tight area and roll the ball to valencia for a tap-in . 
  he 's doing very well . '',
