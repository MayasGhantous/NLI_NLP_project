  16:11 paul scholes is taking some time off to spend with his family . 
  ryan giggs is described as an `` incredible footballer '' and the new man wants some young members of staff behind him . 
  16:13 `` i 've never seen united get a tougher premier league start over the years , '' jokes the manager . 
  he hopes to get balance right between winning and entertaining . 
  `` i hope i have the same magic touch as sir alex , '' he asserts . 
  it is made clear that not all of the squad is back in training .

  i 'm just gon na say i love this quote : ** `` moyes : `` i come to a club where success is tattooed across its badge . 
  here are the key points from moyes ' first press conference of the barclays premier league season : [ source ] ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/united-today/2013/aug/united-today-manchester-united-live-blog.aspx?pageno=1 ),

  speaking during his first press conference at the aon training complex , the boss confirmed rafael will be out of action for up to four weeks with the hamstring injury sustained at wembley earlier this month , whilst also offering an update on the progress of ashley young , nani and javier hernandez . 
  `` rafa picked up an injury in the community shield game so we 've lost him for three or four weeks , '' moyes told reporters . 
  `` we have one or two coming back from injury - the likes of nani , ashley young and chicharito . 
  they 're still recovering . 
  `` so we 've got two or three coming back from really the effects of not having a proper pre-season because they came back from international duty a bit late . 
  hopefully they 'll all not too far away now . 
  `` we 've got a really squad here and we 're able to cope if you do get injuries . 
  but it 's only just a case of getting then up to speed because they 've missed pre-season . '', 
  monday 's match sees chelsea visit old trafford for an early season dust-up between the two title rivals and , understandably , moyes ca n't wait for the action to begin . 
  the boss is also keen to welcome his jose mourinho back to the english game following his recent return to chelsea . 
  `` i really like jose , he 's had great success and i 've not seen him for a long time so i 'm looking forward to seeing him , '' the boss explained . 
  `` i came ( to united ) for this sort of level of game , but i came to win trophies . 
  if you are going to win trophies then you are going to have to beat teams like chelsea and manchester city because that 's the way our league is . 
  `` i 'm looking forward to it . 
  it 's one of 38 league games we 've got this season and it 's a great first home game . '', 
  ** [ on new signings  ( http://www.manutd.com/en/news-and-features/football-news/2013/aug/david-moyes-press-conference-v-chelsea.aspx ) **, 
  manchester united boss david moyes says he is under no pressure to bring in any new signings ahead of the transfer deadline on 2 september . 
  the reds manager addressed the media ahead of the bank holiday fixture against chelsea and was inevitably asked about the latest on the window . 
  `` there is a need to do it , '' explained moyes , when quizzed on introducing new faces to the title-winning squad . 
  `` but there is no pressure to do it . 
  `` we 've been talking about it since i took the job on 1 july . 
  i have an idea of where i 'd like to strengthen and what we need to do . 
  but we wo n't do it because people like you tell us we should be signing players . 
  we 'll do it because we think it 's the right thing to do . 
  if the right players are available then great , but , if not , the first thing we 'll do is encourage our own young players in the squad to do as well as they did last year . 
  `` there is a possibility [ we wo n't sign anybody ] but the plan is we bring in one or two if we can . 
  i think there is [ value out there ] but we have only targeted certain players and do n't have a big , big list . 
  there are only certain quality players we want to bring to the club . '', 
  the manager also rebuffed another question regarding chelsea 's interest in striker wayne rooney ahead of monday 's game . 
  `` we 've told you , have n't we ? '', 
  he asserted . 
  `` i hardly need to repeat it again . 
  it does n't need to be said . '', 
  ** on chelsea : ** i came for this sort of level of game but i also came to win trophies . 
  to do that you have to beat the likes of chelsea . 
  it 's a great first home game for us to have . 
  they have started strongly , have good players and are a good team . 
  there 's not a big change to the team -- they just have a new manager , a bit like us . 
  ** on jose mourinho 's return : ** i really like jose . 
  he 's had great success . 
  i 've not seen him for a long time so i 'm looking forward to seeing him . 
  ** on swansea win : ** we had a great performance and result . 
  it was a difficult game and i think swansea will cause teams a lot of problems . 
  it was nice to win .
