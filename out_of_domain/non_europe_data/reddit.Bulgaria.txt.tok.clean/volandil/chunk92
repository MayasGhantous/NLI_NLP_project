  david moyes says that competition for places is intensifying within manchester united 's squad as the reds boss feels his side is * `` beginning to show what we are capable of . '' *,

  * `` that is what i hope . 
  midweek [ against bayer leverkusen ] certainly showed what we are capable of when we are playing well and the job is to do that week in , week out . '' *,

  here are the main points from david moyes ' press conference :, 
  - robin van persie `` has a chance '' of being involved against everton on wednesday . 
  the striker has been sidelined with a groin injury . 
  - asked if he had mixed feelings going into the game against his former club , the manager said he had a great time at everton , who were `` fabulous '' to him . 
  - moyes does not necessarily believe he has an advantage over the toffees simply because he knows most of their players . 
  he believes roberto martinez `` has done a very good job '' at goodison park . 
  - he admits it would have been `` a really good week '' if united had beaten cardiff but says the reds ' job now is to `` keep on a good run of form '' . 
  - the manager accepts marouane fellaini has taken a while to settle in at united but insists he 's not alone in that regard as it 's common to most players who join the club . 
  - moyes insists he handled his departure from everton in the best way possible , given he only found out about the united job four weeks before the end of the season . 
  - the boss admits the reception from everton fans could be mixed but hopes they understand he created a strong team on merseyside by bringing in some good players .

  14:05 the manager says it 's `` important to give ourselves the best possible chance in the next round '' of the champions league . 
  he wants united to `` finish the group unbeaten and if we do that it will see us through [ as group winners ] . '', 
  in other words , a draw or a victory against shakhtar donetsk tomorrow night is the target . 
  14:10 moyes admits the current run of results is `` tough '' , `` because the expectancy here is to win all the games . '', 
  the boss adds , `` i take complete responsibility for the results . 
  fortunately they have been good in the champions league , but i would like them to be much better in the premier league and i think they will be . '', 
  14:15 as for team news ahead of the shakhtar match , moyes admitted that training-session absentees patrice evra , chris smalling and nemanja vidic are all ` doubts ' . 
  a more positive update on shinji kagawa after the japanese star sat out saturday 's clash with newcastle : `` he 's trained today and i think he 'll be okay for tomorrow . '', 
  14:35 david moyes also gave an insight into the mood among his players following three consecutive games without a victory . 
  `` the players are hurting because they are used to winning . 
  when they do n't win , that hurts them as they care very much about their team and their club . 
  they are good lads and will respond in the right way . '',
