  david moyes says he is more driven than ever to succeed at manchester united and is confident he can turn things around at old trafford . 
  after excellent performances against olympiacos and west ham , the reds suffered a disappointing 3-0 derby defeat to manchester city in midweek . 
  with two more home clashes to follow against aston villa and in tuesday 's champions league quarter-final against bayern munich , the manager feels he just needs time to get the reds competing for league glory again . 
  `` the players know exactly what it is to play for manchester united and the standards they have to set , '' declared moyes at friday 's press conference . 
  `` but they 're hurting as well as me and are desperate to put it right . 
  and hopefully when we get to the game against villa , they can show that . 
  `` it 's a long journey here and this is only the start of it , '' he explained . 
  `` you work hard to get here in the first place but i 've got to say i 'm more driven to succeed than ever because i want the team to turn around and i want to change the position we 're in just now . 
  `` i really do believe we can do that . 
  we 've got a great club , which gives you the chance to do that because of the people we can attract and the players we can attract to the club . 
  but it 's just going to take a little bit of time to get it sorted . '', 
  moyes believes the vast majority of fans are supportive and will continue to provide their backing inside the stadium . 
  `` everywhere i go , i get great support from manchester united supporters , '' he stated . 
  `` i was really fortunate to be at a dinner last night for darren fletcher and the amount of supporters who were up ,, 
  saying : ` keep going , we understand exactly the situation the club and the team is in ' . 
  so they were really supportive and every time i 've gone to old trafford , the crowd have been great . 
  i 'm seeing it differently to what a lot of people are seeing . 
  `` but results are what really matter . 
  the business is results-driven and i 'm keen to get those results to move up the table . 
  i 'm repeating myself but it 's actually not what i 've been witnessing [ any negativity ] . 
  i 'm witnessing great support : the people i bump into outside the ground , manchester united supporters . 
  `` there 's a rebuilding plan underway and anybody who has an understanding of the game understands that will happen . 
  and the people who put me in the job here are top football people who understand the game and know exactly what is required at manchester united . 
  they know exactly the sort of characters you need to run the club . '',

  david moyes insists his manchester united players are `` desperate '' to bounce back from wednesday 's defeat to manchester city with a positive performance against aston villa at old trafford . 
  the reds were beaten 3-0 by manuel pellegrini 's men to halt any momentum that was gained by the preceding wins against olympiacos and west ham . 
  while speaking to the media on friday , the boss was clear when explaining his hopes for villa . 
  `` we did n't play well in midweek and it was disappointing but going into the game , we 'd played well against olympiacos and against west ham , '' moyes told reporters . 
  `` so going into the game against aston villa i 'd like to get more of the west ham performance rather than the midweek one . 
  `` the players know exactly what it is to play for manchester united -- they know the standards they have to set . 
  but they 're hurting as well as me and are desperate to put it right . 
  and hopefully when we get to the game against villa , they can show that . '', 
  saturday 's match is followed by tuesday 's champions league tie with bayern munich and , understandably , moyes wants to boost morale ahead of that occasion : `` we go into the villa game knowing that we want to go into the munich game in good fettle . 
  `` we 're looking forward to it because we played really well at west ham and if we can follow up with a similar performance , i 'll be more than happy . 
  then we play against maybe the best team in europe in midweek , which we 're looking forward to . '',

  david moyes said of united 's champions league form this season : `` it 's been a very good competition for us so far in my short time here . 
  i came into it very inexperienced in the champions league but we 've done well and now we 've got the ultimate test in bayern munich . '', 
  when asked if bayern munich are under more pressure to win the quarter-final , given their status as reigning champions , moyes replied : `` i think the pressure is equally balanced because we want to win the game as much as they do . 
  we go into the game knowing on our day , we are as good a side as any . 
  we have to show it more often but i have got great belief in the players . '', 
  it seems there is stiff competition for places in united 's team tomorrow night .
