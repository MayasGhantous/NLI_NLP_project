  so chamberlain fucked up . 
  or promoted , as it shows foreigners want to know more about the glorious north korea . 
   somewhat western, 
  well ba'athism has roots tied to nazism and fascism , so i guess that 's the western values they have . 
  more like french , british and americans beaten germany so austria-hungary surrendered along with germany . 
  italy really only technically beaten austria-hungary mainly because they sided with entente . 
  does n't afd love putin ? 
  yeah , there 's a huge trend of far-right worldwide loving both putin and trump . 
  except in ukraine , their far-right hates both of them . 
  what 's with military personal loving libertarians ? 
  those guys would destroy your jobs . 
  eeeh , us military usually wins battles . 
  it 's just us leadership that screw up to win a war with lack of serious post-war strategy . 
  it 's not military means that fail , it 's political side that fails . 
  i love how libertarians hold so many non-libertarian beliefs . 
  it 's justified though , it is inexcusable what had happened with rome 2 on launch . 
  and since this was n't the first time something like that happened to ca , i.e. 
  empires , the stigma should stick to remind ca to never screw up like that again . 
  warhammer is a great step to right direction , but there 's always a danger ca might try to get away with half-ass release with their next major tw instalment . 
  i remember when forbes took side with gamers against gaming media and bioware over mass effect 3 ending controversy . 
  troll right ? 
   that has no one jewish in his blood line ... 
  provable jewish line !, 
  ca n't we just nuke both adolf mkii and stalin mkii ? 
  differences on who 's more evil are borderline trivial . 
  why not both at same time ? 
  we have plenty of nukes to bomb them both several times at same time . 
  i know , but when people counter argue them there 's this creeping apologism happening for stalin and his regime . 
  i ca n't help myself to react to that . 
  i 'd personally just go with it 's irrelevant who 's worse , they 're both evil shits burning in hell right now . 
   no nation that took part in world war 2 is free of responsibility . 
  those evil , evil belgians !, 
  i 'm not accusing you of doing that , it 's just i 've seen it so many times where people go `` stalin did nothing wrong '' route when using them same genocide olympics argument . 
  i 'm personally coming from region that got fucked over by both nazism and communism and it 's damages are still seen in our society , so it does make me rather uneasy to say at least when such topic comes up . 
  i find it amazing how wehraboos never really talk about those tanks . 
  i do think it would deny nazi germany quick victory over france , but france would still fall eventually due to too much internal problems and still not recovered from ww1 . 
  but that would have bled nazi germany much more as well buy british more time to make raf superior to luftwaffe , so perhaps making the war even shorter . 
  totally unbiased source !, 
  i on je u saboru ? 
  only a small fraction of iraqi oil is owned by western companies , majority of iraqi oil is in chinese corporations hands by democratically elected iraqi government consent . 
  i 'd dare to say trump only had first 10-15 minutes , but clinton dominated the rest of debate . 
  i think his aide just underestimated his stupidity . 
  as a european , this was great thing to hear . 
  we need nato to keep stability in our continent . 
  everyone who thinks europe is unified is fooling himself . 
  we are hugely divided and without cold war 's nato we 'd never even have hint of unity . 
  also putin 's russia , very much putin 's russia and their 19th century imperialistic ambitions . 
  and that 's why trump 's presidency scares the living shit out me . 
  that is the most positive they said for clinton ever , so it 's progress . 
  because for centuries western europe considered slavs in general as subhuman , just like with jews ( although that one went for over a millennia and in eastern europe ) . 
  in a vain hope tj will read here , i 'm posting it here . 
  i find it rather shocking to see him say trump came out the most liberal out of this debate . 
  how ? 
  nafta is a liberal globalist bill for starter . 
  as well while it 's highly controversial , there is no real consensus was that bill bad or good for us among economists . 
  but even if it 's unanimously bad , it 's still derived from liberal globalist agenda, 
  as for tpp , hillary dropped her support for that bill once she got access to read it fully and due to public pressure . 
  you can say whatever you want from that , but the fact is she 's no longer supporting it . 
  but what makes me shocked the most , something i already told tj on twitter , is that trump would be willing to order us warships to attack iranian warships over mere taunting ?!, 
  seriously ?!, 
  nafta is more important to you then to randomly declare a war against a strong , big and developed country over some iranian sailors flipping off ?!, 
  and then there 's also a fact that trump wants to drag an entire nato , alliance that he despises and wants to abolish anyway , into a war in middle east . 
  just middle east , no specific country . 
  no specific reason . 
  just war in middle east . 
  how do you after these points still consider trump more liberal then clinton after this debate ? 
  it 's an utter absurdity . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  i completely forgot to mention how donald trump had stated he supports tax cuts for the rich , especially bigger cuts or the reach then for the middle class and poor like hillary accurately stated . 
  meanwhile hillary stated she wants to increased taxes on the rich and bring more regulations on the wall street . 
  i know she 's not very trustworthy , that right there gives her a lot more liberalism points while trump should lose some . 
  do n't you think ? 
  ** edit *** # 2 *, 
  also another gem i forgot to mention . 
  donald trump was more then happy to admit , in middle of debate , he exploited his workers and cheated them out of their money . 
  as well happy to admit he was expecting the housing bubble to burst and to earn shit ton of money , because it 's business as 9 millions of americans lost their homes . 
  again , how in the world is he more liberal then clinton ? 
  you mean either china or russia ? 
  putin blew that chance after invasion of georgia , then killed it when invading ukraine . 
  while china has strong ambitions to become the next world superpower that seem to be a possibility in next 20-40 years . 
  while it did favoured the rich , nafta on it 's foundations and it 's core is a liberal bill in theory . 
  it just backfired badly when set in practice . 
  big problem with nafta to work like it it 's intended is that there is no possibility to have international regulation that would be enforced properly . 
  but at same time , something like nafta was needed . 
  corporations and industries had to expand internationally and move their business elsewhere , otherwise economic would stagnate and we 'd have another world economy crash . 
  so nafta was the best thing that could have been came up to at the time . 
  what should have followed up with it are higher taxes on the rich and corporations within us , to offset the losses . 
  something what only clinton is today in these elections promising to do . 
  so the more i think about it , the more i see clinton is still somewhat liberal but she 's very pragmatic and compromising about it . 
  i do n't know , it really did irk me wrongly when tj said trump came out more liberal then clinton . 
  i just do n't see that objectively possible after watching the video . 
  gib crimea back !, 
  yet in hoi4 italy a.i. 
  is better then germany a.i. 
  wow , a sino-japanese war that was stuck in a bitter stalemate for years ?!, 
  stara infrastruktura . 
  but it also means trump lost hispanic vote . 
  cuban americans hate the castro regime in cuba . 
  him doing business in castro 's cuba ? 
  bye bye the only republican hispanic vote , especially in a key swing state florida .
