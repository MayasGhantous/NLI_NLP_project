  also i had auto save that was only a month before i noticed yugoslavia formed . 
  and albania was still there and had no rebels . 
  oh , that i did n't know . 
  but even then , there were no rebels in albania a month before it became yugoslavia . 
  define `` small '' . 
  that 's better . 
  to be fair , nra would want that such gun to exist and be legal for civilians to purchase . 
   when in reality , assholes have been assholes for billions of years . 
  depressing fact , considering humans exists only several millions of years . 
  well , they do use similar symbols so it could be just a honest mistake . 
  that 's some hardcore hunting to be made . 
  that 's it , someone needs to give those kind of people a free trip around earth 's orbit . 
  i should n't have laugh so much when i read `` alexander the peaceful '' . 
  so , wait . 
  if it was n't for islam , there would n't be usa ? 
  til !, 
  just make sure you point that gun to the heretics . 
  just gon na confirm it was sarcastic . 
  my answer would be both yes and no . 
  cause , in this context , i do n't see how usa would n't exist whatever or not islam existed . 
  but hey , those are some nasty variables to play with . 
  since overall statement is correct , it would massively change the world history if not islam existed . 
  since islam did made a huge impact in history . 
  exactly . 
  oooooh , it 's that gun . 
  yeah , it 's been a few years since i played last 40k game . 
   ( essentially human + computer since ai in the future is banned ), 
  why in every damn sci-fi , a.i. 
  's are banned ? 
  oh wow , with that russians would be the to explore americas . 
  unless sweden/scandinavia wanted to get piece of the action is world trade . 
  and since native americans would be way more advanced , this would be very fun alternative history to be made . 
  brave meter just broke . 
  not in my game . 
  every damn time , they send quick aid of shit-ton-of troops to france , when i 'm in war with it as germany . 
  i think they just do that because i 'm german . 
  but where 's fun in that ? 
  for some reason , i read `` unjust laws '' as `` unjust jews '' . 
  i 'm on this subreddit for waaay too long . 
  humanity is always genius in stupidity . 
  aaaaaaand instant subscribe to / r/bad _ religion . 
  i do n't get this hatred on the catholics . 
  why do i get the feeling only reason khazar jews are picked upon now , is due to next crusader kings 2 expansion will include them ? 
  as in , they got that snippet of history just so they can use it as strawman . 
   `` in all honesty there are more interesting religious books than the bible . 
  read the book of mormon it is like a fan-fic based on the bible '', 
  could n't make myself , but to giggle at this comment . 
  `` what the hell is going on ?!, 
  am i under arrest ?! '', 
  lmao !, 
  what a retard . 
  i 'm gon na be little sad when croatia beats them out of the world cup . 
  sorry icelanders , but it 's gon na happen . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ok , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hope ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ gon na ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ happen . 
  well color me interested . 
  by everyone , you mean everyone in rich western countries ? 
  probably due to the pope being mentioned , it 's number # 1 post . 
  talk about an overkill . 
  looks like a good pr stunt for him , to salvage some respect back . 
  well , despite loss of respect , polls on his popularity risen after admitting he did crack . 
  well ... not exactly reliable , but it was from the recent daily show segment on the mayor . 
  or was it in the colbert report ? 
  and since i 'm getting upvotes , either what i said is correct or internet users trust random funny comments too much . 
  but i also get a lot of downvotes , so it 's more likely to be the latter situation . 
  though still should be attempted to limit politics in football , s much as possible . 
  what spanish team did here is a pretty well done move . 
  usa did and does a lot of bad shit , but no way near as bad as obiang 's regime . 
  just that usa 's bad shit is done globally . 
  just because it does n't work on you , it does n't mean it does n't work on others . 
  besides , i did say save some of his respect back . 
  some people would respect him again , just how many is the question . 
  so a desperate pr stunt move on his part , to salvage back something . 
  ah , thanks for clarification . 
  i never said us government is n't piece of shit . 
  however he 's not doing this because us wants it , but because he rules the country with stuff us wants . 
  so us turns the blind eye on his atrocities because he 's willing to give his country stuff . 
  or to be more accurate what international corporations ( usually based in usa ) want , since usa does n't gain shit from this stuff but us government loves those ~ ~ bribes ~ ~ lobby donations from said international corporations . 
  italy would n't execute either , as death penalty is abolished there . 
  even in argentina it is abolished , so they would n't execute assassin of their citizen either . 
  especially since italian mafia definitely has mainly catholic members . 
  so usa is n't ... 
   ** most ** civilized countries, 
  damn it !, 
  conspiracy theories and fictions do n't count . 
  it 's like they never heard of agnosticism and deism . 
  they 'd still nuke each other . 
   my fusion bomb is fundamentally different than your fusion bomb . 
  ftfy, 
  fanta is orange in the us ?!, 
  til ... 
  well you ca n't treat cancer , if your currency worth 's shit . 
  but that means we would need to start and like that certain someone . 
  but never under kebab rule !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ remnants ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ remnants ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ temporary ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kebab ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ occupation ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ lasted ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ over ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ century . 
  shots fired !, 
  only after you free vojvodina . 
  they look pretty . 
  we only love them to keep our casus belli to get our clay back , soon . 
  after that , love is gone . 
  i to od one starije verzije .
