  he wo n't , he will fail catastrophically . 
  problem is he will very likely try and consequences will be catastrophic for everyone . 
  there is some sort of unwritten rule that celebrities should be neutral . 
  and no , i have no clue where did that one come from . 
  it 's bullshit . 
  tpp needed renegotiation , not be outright killed . 
  and clinton was willing to renegotiate . 
  tpp was afterall rushed to quickly tame china 's aggressive trade and sea territory expansionism . 
  new tpp is now impossible . 
  not only because trump killed it without talking to other countries part of tpp , but also by becoming hostile to key countries of tpp deal . 
  none of these countries will ever trust us , even if next president is a fdr-obama hybrid . 
  tpp is dead and no such similar deal will be made in foreseeable future . 
  ok , seriously , why is that propagandist youtuber not banned from being posted on this subreddit after 2 years ? 
  almost everything he says it 's complete and utter nonsense and lies . 
  french already did that . 
  libertarians are mostly just closeted fascists who only pay lip service for individual freedom , but only for their white right wing asses . 
  no , it 's absurd to everyone with any sense . 
  will it be out this year ? 
  yes , they raised more money in that week then in past 6 years combined . 
  and they are still receiving a lot of donations . 
  democratic party is a coalition of moderate conservatives , liberals and socialists , afterall . 
   sane trump supporters, 
  that 's an oxymoron, 
  idiots !, 
  all of them !, 
  every single trump voter is a damn idiot !, 
  which seems to be a trend with american conservatives . 
  trump is everyone 's puppet . 
  he 'll do whatever last person advised him what to do . 
  hell , just look with him declaring to start safe zones in syria after talking with erdogan , despite pissing off russia . 
  and russia said earlier today that they had no idea trump had a phone call with erdogan . 
  it 's obvious it was erdogan who advised him to start implementing a plan for safe zones in syria . 
  and let 's not forget trump had a phone call with poroshenko recently too . 
  poroshenko likely stroke his ego and advised trump to continue sanctions against russia over crimea and likely more . 
  this is ridiculous , now everyone is fighting to become a puppet-master over trump . 
  so first victory on local level , i see . 
  i hope it 's just first of many victories . 
  yeah , because you ca n't go to vote and masturbate before or after . 
  but it was n't for iraqi resources either . 
  i severely doubt china contracted us to topple down saddam so that china can buy off iraqi oil . 
  and yet american companies only own a small fraction of iraqi oils , while it 's chinese competitors own overwhelming majority . 
  great , now i ca n't stop thinking of baghdadi cuddling with a teddy bear . 
   uncontrollable love for russia \u2714 \u2716, 
  hitler had uncontrollable love for russia too . 
  well for russian territory , not so much for the russians . 
  actually if it were n't for starting ww2 and looting occupied countries , germany would have economically collapsed . 
  looting and pillaging managed to delay the inevitable . 
  but yes , nazi german economic policies were a disaster . 
  question , what kind of forum is that ? 
  yeah , i went to read that thread 's comments fully . 
  it 's interesting place , from what i can see . 
  while australia has no issue yet on voting in a wanna-be-dictator , their politics are sure fucked despite compulsory voting . 
  and even then , it 's very likely even conservative supreme court justices will vote against trump 's eo . 
  yeah , by kosovo ... 
  i mean jesus , at least say albania to make it at least have some sense . 
  but this one just hits me . 
  he wants to partition macedonia between bulgaria and kosovo . 
  it 's a unique proposition , i guess . 
  croats do n't hate albanians . 
  they 're basically our mexicans . 
  trump has zero capacity for subtlety . 
  although to be fair , stalin sure did made a lot of efforts to lose the war with his idiocy and paranoia . 
  oh they have been build long time ago , when we had other illegal aliens coming in like mongols and turks . 
  hungary and later austria paid for those walls too !, 
  good point . 
  that happened for 2016 presidential elections , but not in 2010 nor 2014 midterms . 
  article does n't dispute that using data for campaigning is bad . 
  it 's saying being obsessed with data only is . 
  data you gathered is useless if you do n't use it properly . 
  well , i joined now . 
  oh i know . 
  serbia and russia still officially consider kosovo as part of serbia . 
  yes , those played a major role too . 
  but both of those can be overcame if democrats start sending a proper and clear message to voters . 
  in fact that 's the only way to beat those two major obstacle now , before they can be removed . 
  because people listen to what story you tell , not what data you say . 
  in reality is , you need combine the two . 
  you make sure to tell a good story to tell , while using data you gathered on how , where and when to tell that story . 
  the combination of the two is key to victory , you just need to give an edge to a story as humans are emotional creatures not rational robots . 
  in reality , bigger issue was losing pilots . 
  even with great manpower , it takes a lot of time and resources to train pilots to fly a strategic bomber plane . 
  on the serious note , if rommel somehow fully captured palestine and syria , what then ? 
  invade turkey ? 
  mccain does n't even make sense to not actually act against trump . 
  he is like 80 years old and very likely to retire by next arizona senate elections . 
  he ca n't go anymore higher then he is , after failing to become a us president . 
  he really ca n't lose anything by standing up against trump . 
  yet , he still fully supports trump despite his dissenting comments . 
  it 's quite sickening that a guy who is pretty much one feet from retirement still ca n't get himself to not tow the party line to actually help his country . 
  punching a nazi is not same as punching someone for their speech . 
   an interesting bit of data related to killed or wounded in action numbers of ukraine/dnr forces in ** crimea ** for 2017 so far :, 
  entire war is ongoing in donbass region . 
  crimea is occupied by russia and neither side is shooting at one another as it would mean russia and ukraine are fully in war . 
  neither ukraine nor russia want that . 
  so entire war is happening in donbass where pro-russian warlords with russian military backing are continuously provoking ukrainian forces with artillery shelling and small scale offensives . 
  that was quick . 
  good work overall , buddy . 
  ** italian far right ** : we will do it better the second time !, 
  we promise !, 
  bush was capable to be professional and serious when needed .
