  you fought and lost . 
  we slaughtered them and won . 
  kada so turci ratovali s austrijom , naravno . 
  one day . 
  one day . 
  there should have been some goals , but i ca n't be disappointed with the game so far . 
  fucking hell , this ended disappointingly . 
  sure , it 's a draw but croatia failed to capitalized on some many great opportunities . 
  and peri\u0161i\u0107 ca n't shoot for shit !, 
  i read this is gon na be the dullest an goalless game . 
  yet , i see the opposite instead . 
  though , icelander 's defense only one shown to play great in this match . 
  hey , they still like croats too . 
  rakiti\u0107 had a very accurate and powerful shot . 
  too bad goalkeeper was in perfect position . 
  great job ukraine !, 
  i watched entire match of iceland vs ~ ~ iceland ~ ~ croatia . 
  man it was dreadful . 
  so many mistakes iceland made , yet croatia failed to capitalize . 
  and peri\u0161i\u0107 ca n't shoot for shit . 
  then i managed to catch last 20 minutes of greece vs romania . 
  match was fun to watch and i did n't miss on that last great goal made by greece . 
  also wow , that romanian substitute got two yellow cards quite fast . 
  for others i did n't nor could n't watch . 
  which sucks , since i wanted to see french tears . 
  also , goddamn it ronaldo !, 
  i want you to lose !, 
  stop being good when you need to be !, 
  as in , you hosted euro . 
  damn it , i 'm tired as fuck right now . 
  gon na edit it now . 
  do n't give them that idea . 
  again . 
  damn , that should give him more then just typical red card 2 game suspension . 
  it was n't a foul , it was a damn assault . 
  guy got into argument with one of ukrainian player , one that did a foul on french player moments earlier , then kocielny either punched or pushed him hard on the field ( [ ca n't say from poor camera angle ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gytz1r4zo90 ) ) . 
  pretty sure such hard shove counts as an assault . 
  instead , allow more national teams to qualify . 
  it 's quite stupid if football is europe and south america centric , which would make football lower it 's popularity on other continents . 
  and that 's why i do n't like the guy . 
  people love the underdogs , so that 's why iceland get 's more love over croatia . 
  i would have love to cheer for them , but alas i 'm croatian so i have to go with my team . 
  i think he/she merely tried to explain it from vegetarian point of view . 
  well those 3 put up some serious weight , after a too long trip in auschwitz . 
  i think he did wanted to forcibly deport them to palestine , but palestinian far-right was a serious opposition to that . 
  til fascism existed since the ancient times . 
  til facism existed since the ancient times . 
  so , sweden should hire more scots again . 
  i like you . 
  \u0160to su to ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ remove ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kebab ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ premises . 
  america is in dire need of 3rd parties getting elected . 
  i know . 
  what a shitty system . 
  they would speak like the poor innocent nazis getting wronged after ww2 . 
   / r/pyongyang ... which is apparently now private . 
  this is the saddest thing i have ever discovered on reddit . 
  no , that was you . 
  because they 're english and the french hate those damn english !, 
  * goes to cry in the corner , again . 
  ... that 's it , gon na go canadian . 
  thanks obama !, 
  but that requires for the same person to leave the line to get those two . 
  nah , those were like their cool ass cars , dude !, 
  because they needed to feed their ego , dude !, 
  pure capitalism at it 's worst , dude !!, 
  nah , they were just exercising their 2nd amendment rights . 
  well , they all ended up in same result . 
  dice insanity . 
  maybe other time , dice will go on your side . 
  florida is owned by cuba ? 
  what did cubans done wrong to deserve such curse ? 
  us enemy # 1 : why are n't they counter-attacking ? 
  us enemy # 2 : their public is voting on how to do it . 
  it 's gon na take like a month . 
  us enemy # 1 : then why are we waiting ? 
  us enemy # 2 : we may want to destroy freedom an democracy , but we must do it in polite way !, 
  now that 's one way to go with the politics . 
  but why twitter of all social medias ? 
  you ca n't make non-generic and good pr on 140 character limit . 
  this is nonsense . 
  no way they would do such thing , while niko kova\u010d is their coach . 
   because he 's on the internet . 
  ftfy, 
  why ? 
  lol , they think un is competent to do such thing, 
  how cute .

  that 's more for / r/badhistory and is n't there a sub for bad politics ? 
  do make sure you explain why is bad history , before posting . 
   the journalism in this country is a joke . 
  from what i 've seen on internet , it 's pretty much a global issue . 
  i guess longer the war goes and more both sides are damaged , better for israel ? 
  that 's what i can think , for israel gaining anything from the war . 
  still , this is way more reliable source then ... unexplained source this newspaper said . 
  not exactly well informed on iraqi situation , but are they in shape to do that ? 
  i 'll chuckle if slovenia get 's in front of france .

   people always whine about england 's lack of talent,
