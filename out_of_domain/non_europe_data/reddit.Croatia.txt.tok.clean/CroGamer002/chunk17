  i thought it was just lack of talent for their goalkeepers . 
  and croatia is even warmer then ukraine , as well during in summer . 
  20 minutes red card for ukraine and a penalty kick for france . 
  well , france is guilty of those in last euro and wc . 
  we 'd both chuckle even more , if both get in front of france . 
  very pretty . 
  was n't this posted alr ... wait , ukraine is in it instead of france . 
  so it got updated . 
  a very nice and accurate update . 
  fifa ranking does matter for qualifications . 
  [ well this is what i got . 
  man , it would be very nasty . 
  yeah . 
  even here in croatia we call iceland , island . 
  you shall be outraged today too , my friend . 
  or just very drunk . 
  only if it comes to the penalty shots . 
  cause , croatia sucks with penalties . 
  and to reach to the world cup finals !, 
  just me ? 
  that 's because scotland had the best ally . 
  pointlessly experimental \u0160timac !, 
  hah , if only i can say a yes . 
  sadly i 'm like the only croatian that does n't drink . 
  yeah , i 'm exited to see usa this wc . 
  you guys pleasantly surprised me in south africa and i expect to see even better show from ya . 
  that 's a very fitting stereotype for all slavic nations . 
  from russia to macedonia . 
  it fits . 
  despite me not fitting the profile , cheers !, 
  i meant in being drunk stereotype , not in being nice . 
  also latvians are baltic 's , not slavs . 
  though their language is quite slavic . 
  animals are an exception . 
  especially cats . 
  baltic tribes existed that are direct descendents , existed there long before slavs even got mentioned first time in history accountants . 
  cultures of baltic nations are a unusual mesh of celtic-german-slavic influences . 
  well you 'll have a lot of free time do that during summer , as iceland ai n't going to brazil . 
  deal !, 
  croatian line up is from previous game . 
  it 's confirmed earlier today that ivica oli\u0107 is replacing eduardo , while mateo kova\u010di\u0107 is replacing illi\u010devi\u0107 . 
  that makes no damn sense , but i 'm still laughing hard . 
  some calculation bug , i presume . 
  cause i see no reason why netherlands would be behind , either . 
  [ it 's in croatian , so gim me a minute to get webpage translated . 
  edit # 1, 
  [ here 's translated . 
  ] ( http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=hr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.24sata.hr%2fnogomet%2fpromjene-u-pocetnoj-postavi-od-prve-krecu-olic-i-kovacic-341616&amp;sandbox=1 ), 
  hmh , that would make sense . 
  though it would still be an error , cause none of the team is playing home . 
  at least , i think that does n't count for world cup . 
  pretty much . 
  this simulator ai n't perfect , that 's for sure confirmed . 
  it should n't be . 
  second pass alone is an offside offense . 
  true enough . 
  still , usa performed very well . 
  i except your guys will shine some more this wc . 
  1st half done and man . 
  there should have been more then 1 scored goal , but it 's good enough for now . 
  and goddamn it , that red card should n't have happen . 
  it was n't on purpose , damn it !, 
  now croatia needs to pull miracles with one player down . 
  i believe you need to do some homework , good sir . 
  after you sober up , ofcourse . 
  enjoy the beers . 
  we love you too , iceland . 
  now , do go and get yourself in russia in 2016 and 2018 . 
  you deserve to get there . 
  unless \u0160uker makes a deal with ea for croatia dlc . 
  man . 
  i do n't know what he was saying , but i do understand what he was expressing . 
  very heartbreaking way to end . 
  man it sucks , but it had to be croatia man . 
  only mexico and uruguay left to confirm their bookings to brazil . 
  and mexico 5-1 against new zealand . 
  so yeah , neither jordan nor new zealand ca n't pull a miracle to qualify . 
  so all we are just waiting is mexico and uruguay confirm their booking officially . 
   and then break ronaldo 's knees, 
  wo n't that make us the most loved team ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  if it was n't for him , croatia would have won at least 5:0 . 
  their goalkeeper is truly amazing !, 
   our goalkeeper was our only player who had a ** decent ** match . 
  now that 's a huge understatement . 
  shots fired !, 
  yet , that was the only goal that romania got . 
  so i got this time is spain , usa , ecuador and croatia . 
  excuse me , but i need to go and cry in the corner . 
  so , we should then entirely blame belgium for being neutral assholes ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding . 
  well stipe is still truly amazing goalkeeper . 
  however , my point on halldorsson still stands . 
  he really needs to get full time job as goalkeeper and get to a major club . 
  he still has a 2nd job as a producer . 
  so he 's not fully focused on his goalkeeper career . 
  ouch . 
   and democracy, 
  well ... maybe not that one . 
  i still wish there 's a linked explanations behind all those .
