  there are unknown rich saudis citizens that do , but government itself fights against islamic terrorists because terrorists are a threat to their monarchy . 
  that 's way too early to say . 
  not enough content of the game was release , nor there are pre-order numbers you can see ( as pre-ordering still is n't even an option ) . 
  i see wyoming had a lot of game of thrones fans in 2015 . 
  he continued :, 
   i should further note that although the mail vote was very democratic in georgia 6 's round one , it 's also much smaller than the in-person early vote . 
  so it can make up a small deficit for democrats , but not a large one . 
  yeah , we have to wait for early mail voting to be counted . 
  eh , ship was set on a time bomb . 
  bomb in fact exploded much later then british commandos expected . 
  hell , commanding officers of that raid units were marched uncomfortably close to that rammed ship , with no idea when it will explode . 
  they had to also keep a calm face to germans officers to not raise any suspicion , even when they were within blast range . 
  does n't matter , they 'll still vote republican . 
  me2 and me3 got permanent discount by this point . 
  and [ me : a most likely sold 4 to 5 million copies in first 3 months ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/6gruzc/no_spoiler_some_sales_number_for_andromeda/ ) , way above ea 's expected 3 million copies . 
  hilariously , militaryhistoryvisualized had made a video in past talking how stalingrad air supply was ineffective . 
  well clearly he is just deflecting it all on germans doing everything wrong !, 
  well if they do n't want to take part of eu responsibilities , then they can leave eu and forget about their eu money . 
  it 's how things work in real world , you do n't just get money for free . 
  but apparently , countries are run by children in modern age . 
  which is a good thing . 
  3rd party dlc 's are an excellent idea for games that still have an active playabase , while game devs can focus on developing a brand new game . 
  is there a mod that does that but only affects leader portraits ? 
  for ironman compatibility . 
  leviathan was done by bw edmonton , it was omega that was done by bw montreal . 
  also that is still first party dlc , because bw montreal is still bioware . 
  also leviathan was a good dlc , so what the hell are you talking about ? 
  damn , that sucks . 
  true , but this thing would be a whole new level of 3rd party dlc development . 
  except , he was super vague on the whole me : a being put on ice and then retracted his statement on `` no me : a dlc 's '' to `` i do n't know will there be '' . 
  oh and while doing so he promoted his book . 
  or 3rd , most likely scenario , me : a dlc development is ongoing as normal and there 's no shut down at bw montreal . 
  it is deleted . 
  people on facebook called them out on their bs , they had backtracked their statement more then once , said even more bizarre things , then finally deleted the post and said `` we do n't want to deal with trolls '' . 
  someone bsn ( who was initially arguing that sinclair networks is real i should add ) had called the provided number of sinclair networks fb page and millennium tower administration . 
  turns out you were correct , sn 's phone number belongs to cisco austria company and millennium tower administration says such company does not exists . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  also i personally went to check random me : a walkthrough video , posted post 1.08 patch , for end credits . 
  sinclair networks is not credited under external partners list . 
  imdb can be edited by anyone and , unlike with wikipedia , there are no citations revealed nor any transparency of editing work . 
  meanwhile as i posted earlier , i went to check me : a 's end credits and sinclair networks is not credited under external partners list . 
  quite a lot of people online are not right in the head or just super bored or both . 
  / u/qolx did most of the work here on reddit , really . 
  their facebook page just went private . 
  yep , they got caught and they are abandoning ship . 
  bioware teased some dlc yesterday ? 
  can you link it , because i 'd like to see . 
  i do know there will be me : a mp twitch stream today from bioware , but that 's about it . 
   the fact that sinclair network has already been removed from the game credits points to this being a hoax . 
  removed implies they were credited in first place . 
  they never were . 
  and they still are credited on [ imdb page ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4876864/ ) , which someone should fix . 
  yeah , he was hand picked by saren to be trained and recruited as spectre . 
  as well saren going awol and attacking citadel station with geth ( and reapers ) , made him decide to retire from spectre work . 
  fearing he might snap in similar fashion like saren did . 
  to add to the pile , here is fernando being [ cheeky ] ( https://twitter.com/discobabaloo/status/880460938033250304 ) . 
  also him stating [ the obvious ] ( https://twitter.com/discobabaloo/status/880463761143865344 ) , but necessary needed to be stated it seems . 
  well it is confirmed now . 
  bioware devs are not allowed to say anything . 
  while that was damn obvious , at least we got that confirmation . 
  instead them not caring to say anything . 
  ian is the best . 
  i 'm still quite upset , yes . 
  although i am far more upset with priority : earth mission , then with ending itself . 
  there 's at least a mod i can ignore the endings , but not that terrible final mission . 
  what a terrible mission to end this amazing trilogy . 
  bioware is under nda obligation to remain silent . 
  until higher up management allows it , they have to remain silent . 
  smart . 
  i agree , but that 's how it is . 
  i have no idea who and why decides to keep this like that . 
  i guess ea just firmly does n't want give rumours any acknowledgement and to not set precedent of them pressuring them to reveal any info prematurely . 
  no they do n't . 
  [ you 're wrong , it 's turnips !, 
  jeff theriault works at bioware edmonton , he had so far worked on dragon age inquisition , jaws of hakkon dlc and mass effect andromeda . 
  so it 's quite interesting he posted this after today 's fiasco . 
  for a fully gutted team , they sure did released quite a lot of decent sized patches in just first 3 months . 
  [ sinclair networks hoax ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/6k7t7p/no_spoilers_summary_of_possible_hoax/ ) . 
  eh , dude , bioware montreal had to call in voice actors , writer and animators just to update jaal as bisexual romance . 
  for free . 
  a gutted studio would n't have this luxury . 
  yeah , he deleted just now . 
  this is what he posted :, 
  zzzzzzzzzzz, 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  is it a job requirement for bioware to be [ a cheeky bastard ] ( https://twitter.com/fieldflux/status/880553129007239170 ) ? 
  ** edit *** # 2 *, 
  oh shit , he just put his account under protected tweets mode . 
  he posted this :, 
   zzzzzzzzzzz, 
   https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ddg5tsuumaahcyx.jpg, 
  783,390 files , not kilobytes . 
  no , they called in voice actor [ to record new lines ] ( https://twitter.com/gamblemike/status/872207428846145536 ) . 
  [ ryder 's va ] ( https://twitter.com/taylorson/status/872208343732858880 ) and [ jaal 's va ] ( https://twitter.com/nyashabishbish/status/872843664963383296 ) had confirmed it too . 
  if me3 managed to recover from ending backlash , so to can me : a from technical issues . 
  backlashes of both games are just not comparable , me : a got tame reception compared to me3 . 
  but i do have to add , quite a few unlisted soundtracks from me : a is far better then most of ost we got . 
  it 's bizarre we got weaker ost featured . 
  it 's a job requirement in bioware to be a cheeky bastard . 
  ofcourse they are laughing at us .
