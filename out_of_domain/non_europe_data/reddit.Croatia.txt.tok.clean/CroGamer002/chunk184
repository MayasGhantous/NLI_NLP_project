  look at his wording here :, 
   ** unless bioware decides to make some sort of drastic pivot ( plans can always change !, 
  ) ** , mass effect : andromeda will not be getting single-player dlc . 
  he is literary leaving room for him to be blatantly wrong on purpose , to cover his ass . 
  also what kind of devs under ea , where follow strict nda 's , would just spill the beans of no dlc 's at short notice ? 
  all the while no specifics nor details allowed . 
  and whole time , this guy is the only one having these sources . 
  not a single out mainstream media outlet is revealing anything similar . 
  just this guy , apparently , has a network of anonymous sources on this issue . 
  that 's impossible . 
  if he can have sources to give him this info so casually , so should other outlets have their own sources to do the same . 
  but it 's not the case . 
  i genuinely think this guy is all over his head after blowing a few major stories , so now he thinks his credibility is unteachable and everything he spews will be treated as correct .

  this guy 's reputation is seriously overblown . 
  dude , a very successful me2 could n't get voice actors for dlc 's . 
  why the hell would apparent failure me : a get voice actors called in for patches and rewrites that are delivered for free ? 
  for an abandoned game , ea and bioware sure are spending quite a lot of money for content delivered for free . 
  this makes no business sense . 
  this logic makes no sense . 
  so they do n't want to release dlc 's , because apparently they would n't sell . 
  but they wo n't state they wo n't release dlc 's , because they 'll lose costumers for future games if they do . 
  so that means , they do have costumers for new games , but not for dlc 's ? 
  the fuck ? 
  and if they release or announce nothing in following few months , it would be quite obvious they wo n't release dlc 's , so people will get mad only a bit later . 
  so this shit does n't make any logical sense . 
  if he was legit , he would n't work in gaming press media . 
  except he is not relaying any facts nor details at all this time . 
  just `` hey some 3 sources that only i have there wo n't be dlc 's , but they must still happen if something drastic happens '' . 
  he 's literary covering his ass , while trying to write a story there is definitely no dlc 's coming . 
  did you even read rest of my paragraph , one you actually quoted ? 
  he is the only person with these sources . 
  not just one outlet , only person . 
  where is gameinformer , ign , gamestop and others ? 
  why not a single other mainstream nor independent came out with one of their own sources ? 
  why is he the only person here with that , while others do n't ? 
  not only is there different outlet with own sources to confirm this story , but now he also being vague and covering his ass in case `` drastic changes '' happen . 
  i call bs on this .

  this guy 's reputation is seriously overblown . 
  there 's always the first time for blow . 
  and this is looking to be the case , considering he is being vague and passive aggressive about this . 
  nothing like he was with destiny and me : a troubled development stories . 
  he never went to defend himself on those two stories , yet here he is super defensive . 
  why change the tune now , if you relied on credibility in past ? 
  almost as if he realized he fucked up originally , so now he 's in panic mode and trying to cover his ass but without admitting he was wrong in first place .

  respected journalist from well respected hundred year old institution , every once in a while , break false stories from sheer idiocy , get caught and fired with disgrace . 
  gaming press media has no journalistic credibility in first place , nor ever will at that , so there 's doubt in my mind this guy is doing the same . 
  he got huge respect for breaking few major stories and now he thinks he ca n't do no wrong and is slacking with reporting . 
  i 'm calling this now , we will have me : a sp dlc announced and released between july and september period . 
  and he will still act he did nothing wrong , just that bioware made `` drastic changed '' in last moment .

  that 's what everyone is doing here . 
  including writer of this article . 
  if there 's not enough people to buy dlc 's , then there 's trivial amount of sales of base game itself . 
  and btw , here 's some history lesson . 
  dead space 3 was a financial failure . 
  ea admitted in public , game was a financial failure . 
  game also received even worse reception then me : a did . 
  yet , that game got dlc 's . 
  and they sold alright . 
  then series got canceled . 
  why the hell would they not openly say the same with me : a that it was disappointing ? 
  oh wait , they said the oposite . 
  ea said they are happy with bioware and still have high expectations for mass effect franchise . 
  who the hell would have high expectations for a franchise , while also thinking at same time dlc 's would sold poorly ?!, 
  that also goes against ea 's historic precedent where they always admit in public when their games sell disappointingly . 
  me : a would have to be the first game they break that precedent , for some unexplained reason . 
  battlefield 4 was a massive success and got tons of dlc 's , only with a big delay to fix game breaking bugs . 
  dice and battlefield series still remain big . 
  i mean , shit , they released battlefield hardline and star wars battlefront . 
  those two games were received poorly on release . 
  yet dice still got to release a massive success bf one and now that looks to be heavily improved sw battlefront 2 . 
  i 'm very baffled what you 're trying to compare me : a with bf4 here . 
  that there will be a delay for me : a sp dlc 's due to patches ? 
  i guess , me3 's leviathan dlc got delayed by 2 months due to extended cut . 
  now with simcity , ea still felt confident to sell overpriced dlc 's , as well stubborn resit for long time until giving up on mandatory online feature . 
  this was not a time where they were `` repairing '' the brand . 
  no comment on the sims 4 , i am not familiar with that game 's situation . 
  well i guess we should ignore how ea operated in past and still does , because me franchise has special standards apparently . 
  so i should just shut up when i see bs and people keep talking about bs as gospel of truth ? 
  yeah , well , i do n't live in a cave you know . 
  burden of evidence is on the writer of article , not me . 
  and he had so far only provided his words , without anything to show for to believe his words that contradict ea 's business policy and statements .
