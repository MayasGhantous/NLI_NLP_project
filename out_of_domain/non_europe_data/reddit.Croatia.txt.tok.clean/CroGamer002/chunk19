  no , i meant [ coup d'etat ] ( http://mashable.com/2013/06/14/reddit-atheism-mods/ ) . 
  not only that , person is classless too . 
  and genderless . 
  talk about screwed up individual . 
  wait , people were legitimately banned from / r/pyongyang left and right ? 
  i 'm not a real redditor then ? 
  and may he stay ` murikan and out of europe . 
   ps : nsfl, 
  not safe for life ? 
  [ that 's nothing . 
  here i have croatia , serbia , montenegro and bulgaria existing , while albania formed yugoslavia . 
  later i even released slovenia . 
  though by then i conquered yugoslavia and released albania . 
  just because it looked hideous to my eyes , as non-slavic nation formed pan-nationalist slavic state . 
  how in the world did you become a secondary power ? 
  that has to be a joke . 
  mislim o [ izborima ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_parliament_election,_2013_%28croatia%29 ) , ne referendumu . 
  after their boston marathon bombing coverage fuck up , that 's a progress . 
  well that explains why this theory is made . 
  lolno, 
  kada sam glaso . 
  jebem ti eu referendum . 
  1st december 2013 will be remembered well in croatian history , when bigots won the day and put a giant shame to the country . 
  only hope now is that prime minister will keep his word and gon na push civil union register law . 
  but who am i kidding , he 's a giant incompetent coward despite owning majority of the parliament . 
  as much as i hate this ban , but fuck that !, 
  i 'm sick and tired of the godwin 's law being broken so much in past weeks . 
  gay marriages are as of today constitutionally banned in croatia . 
  and this is [ godwin 's law ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/godwin%27s_law ) . 
  as well as infringed copyright protections . 
  [ here 's an example of one ironic copyright infringement ] ( http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/hate-group-fail-used-gay-bands-song-anti-gay-marriage-ad251113 ) . 
  not even remotely close . 
  in 1940 's germany political opponents and undesirables were sent and killed in concentration camps . 
  here , croatian bigots went full douche and retard just for a symbolic victory . 
  and only 1/5 decided that ( 65 % of people were absent from voting !, 
  ) , by exploiting no minimal requirement that was removed for eu referendum . 
  gays , while still having some rights restricted , still have parliamentary majority support with prime minister promising to put registered civil unions in motion . 
  basically , nothing like germany in 1940 's . 
  nor in 1930 's , in case you made a typo . 
  how in the world assassination of political opponents ( many who were part of nazi party too ) is same as douche and bigoted constitutional ban that is voted in by 1/5 of voters ( 65 % of voters were absent ! ), 
  and not supported by leading majority of government ? 
  index je zbilja pretjero . 
  putting creationism would be going against vatican , as pope john paul ii accepted theory of evolution and dismissed creationism ( unless you want to go technical and say theistic evolution is still creationism ) . 
  though there is now proposed ban on use of cyrillic , however that might fail before it starts . 
  cause it would be infringement of national minority rights , which already protected by constitutional . 
  unlike sexual orientation . 
  it 's alright . 
  just i 'm sick of bad historical analogies and revisionism that is done lately by all political sides . 
  well i have n't see croatian creationists ever in my life . 
  well there was some obscure website i 've seen last summer , but that 's about it . 
  also theistic evolution is pretty much word to word like theory evolution , only with `` god did that in that way , bible is merely metaphorical '' . 
  intelligent design is still very deeply literal on bible teaching , with some theory of evolution elements being used . 
  also you have to realize as much as it is a basic human right , it is not considered to be by either the eu nor un . 
  so technically , lgtb 's are very in unequal position worldwide still . 
  eu for sure , un not . 
  most of un members are anti-gays , many of them still criminalizing homosexuality . 
  unless majority of member 's and all great powers ( russia says fuck you ) are for it , it 's not gon na happen . 
  [ ovo sam napravio ] ( http://www.reddit.com/search?q=croatia&amp;sort=new ) kad je referendum pro\u0161o . 
  [ ahem ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war ), 
  it was still a war . 
  they could have been no casualties and it would still be a war . 
  i mean , look at the [ cod wars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cod_wars ) . 
  there was n't even any battle in all 3 wars , in which also resulted in 1 death and 1 wounded . 
  still a war . 
  yeah , i merely simplified that fact . 
  even then , all coalition members are pro-gay . 
  ok , i do n't know for pensioner party . 
  what was their standing ? 
  it was still a war , it just did n't had a big , long and horrendous scale bosnia had . 
  and shit , use the damn headphones in the future . 
   at this point , i think only a miracle can keep me here . 
  or just your immigration application get 's reject or you do n't have money to move out . 
  well , my only hope is my friend from denmark can genuinely let me move to his place while i try to find a job there . 
  and then from there , go canadian . 
  at least , that 's my dream . 
  though their coalition did nearly break up over rising real estate prices ( with liberals ) , new pension cuts ( with pensioners ) and new regional county change ( with istrian regional party ) . 
  i went to skim through his profile and my best guess is ... 
  i 'm surely wrong , right ? 
  and it can still be removed from constitution , which requires 66 % of approval in the parliament . 
  which , basically , socialist-liberal coalition already has and who are openly in pro-gay . 
  plus , even the labor party is pro-gay despite being independent . 
  so if they grow some balls , they can technically remove that amendment . 
  though that is nearly a political suicide . 
  best they can do now , is to have registered civil unions . 
  which they promised to do in following days . 
  why is there a random picture of cat ther ... oh , that other picture . 
  i know , i just added more details . 
  worse then russian orthodox church ? 
  let us not forget 1/5 of population decided on this ban . 
  i mean , a pathetic 35 % voter turnout . 
  sad thing , this referendum would have failed before 2012 . 
  since before we had 50 % +1 voter turnout requirement for referendum to be eligible . 
  but ti was removed for eu joining referendum that had 47 % voter turnout . 
  so basically , minority decided faith of other minority due to this exploit . 
  to make yourself feel better , choose russians to be worse . 
  i do n't think it would get much support as it did here . 
  i know of many who voted for gay marriage ban , but are for fully for registered civil unions . 
  actually , ban can still be averted . 
  it requires 66 % of votes in parliament for constitution amendments to be added or removed . 
  you know , there should be a referendum to remove mami\u0107 out of dinamo zagreb ...
