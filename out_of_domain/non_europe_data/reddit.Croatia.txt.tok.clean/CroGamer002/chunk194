  it took them until 2015 to recover to pre-recession levels . 
  today ea is far bigger , far more valuable and far more profitable then ever before . 
  and now all of their studios can collaborate in developing all of their games , because they work under single game engine instead of multiple different ones . 
  to think they are doing badly is just flat out delusional . 
  ea has n't acquired any new studio in many years . 
  they stopped aggressive expansion strategy due to 2008 recession nearly killing them , so basically your comment is almost a decade out of date . 
  that 's some seriously elitist and entitled comment . 
  sports games and competitive multiplayer fsp 's are not for hardcore gamers ? 
  no wonder people do n't take `` gamers '' seriously . 
  also look at [ ea 's overall stock value ] ( https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ea/ ) . 
  their stock value today is worth twice as much as their pre-2008 recession peak . 
  ea has never been in greater position then ever before . 
  and they still managed to release a good game that sold well . 
  also do note bw montreal was under going merger with ea motive before me : a went gold . 
  ea was clearly not satisfied with bw montreal senior management , but it still had many talented developers under it 's helm . 
  hence the merger and not closure . 
  because ea is source of all evils in gaming industry , did n't you get the memo ? 
  me : a 's side quests are definitely worse from me2 and me3 , while there 's also no well developed level designs outside of main story quests , loyalty mission quests , havarl and remnant vaults . 
  open world element for me : a was a major mistake , clearly bioware does n't know how to make open world elements good . 
  we do n't know that . 
  no dlc development for me : a is not confirmed . 
  we do know now that bw montreal was undergoing merger with ea motive since before game even went gold , so any plans of sp dlc 's and sequel were halted post launch for certain . 
  however this does not rule out bw edmonton and even perhaps bw austin not setting up a plan to take the helm of dlc development later on . 
  game did received a soft re-launch after 1.09 patch and got some marketing through nvidia of free game copies . 
  so clearly ea and bioware were doing some research does game still has interest . 
  right now , it is confirmed bw edmonton is working on me : a multiplayer fully , while unable to answer for any progress over sp content due to nda . 
  i 'll also note that mass effect discovery # 4 comic was bizarrely delayed from late august to late september , and that final chapter of that specific series will be heavily involved about quarians . 
  same with mass effect annihilation novel , previously known as lost ark , was meant to be released before mass effect initiation novel . 
  but as of yet , it appears initiation will be released before annihilation . 
  and similarly like discovery # 4 , annihilation is expected to be about quarians , specifically quarian ark. 
  it is assumed both comic and novel are dlc tie , so perhaps they are delayed heavily just like dlc development is too . 
  but we have to wait and see . 
  mismanagement of bw montreal leadership got us to this point of uncertainty . 
  no , that 's a myth . 
  german soldiers and officers were allowed to opt out of not committing war atrocities . 
  they rarely received even minor disciplinary actions for refusal , as well many received promotions despite refusing to commit war crimes . 
  they are clearly more incompetent and far more physically unfit then original nazis . 
  they do n't like her because she has no charisma nor is she a populist . 
  actually that is a myth . 
  he was already falling in polls before that weird sound `` controversy '' , it was just a coincidence . 
  trump tolerates and encurages terror bombing campaign in syria and iraq . 
  as well is doing nothing to stop iraqi military and iranian militias from mass torturing and executing sunni iraqis . 
  and is fully backing ypg/pkk terrorists that are ethnically cleansing non-kurdish populace in rojava syria , along with jailing and torturing political opposition within kurdish people too . 
  and there was that botched yemen raid . 
  trump has plenty of blood on his hands too . 
  as well he wants to push for wars against north korea and venezuela . 
  it is his sheer incopetance that makes him fail to get his kill count from thousands to millions . 
  well only a portion of autobahn that was necessary for military use of invading every neighbouring country . 
  some people want to remove lenin statues in response of confederates statues removal , failing to realize those lenin statues are on private property unlike confederate statues which are on public property . 
   the video of this part-time nazi , this junior secessionist ,, 
  i 'm done . 
  i 'm just ... wow this just perfect description of that fucking pussy . 
  i get the feeling he was never truly racist , but just incredibly opportunistic for quick power grab but it did n't work out so well for him in the end . 
  it 's random to me who wins , but without my player intervention *** coughs *** cheating *** coughs *** it is always a one sided slaughter by one of the two . 
  i have to intervene *** coughs *** cheat *** coughs *** to turn it into a much longer war . 
  i think he lied . 
  wait that was him ? 
  he 's now even saying that [ pyramids were build by jewish slaves ] ( https://twitter.com/geraldorivera/status/898186762178244608 ) . 
  that statement makes far more sense now and why neo-nazis were happy with trump 's weak ass statement . 
  it 's like they do n't know nationalist china was n't actually communist . 
  those merchant ships were totally asking for it !, 
  ah fuck , we still did n't get rid of the sand snakes . 
  at best arya is messing with both sansa and littlefinger , but yeah . 
  arya vs waif is a major precedent that shows it is just plan bad writing and what we see on the screen actually happens . 
  oh and that d&d have no respect for fans and for making fan-theories . 
  he probably got some earth-bender to make some massive chains . 
  as a king of the iron throne i declared this move invalid !, 
   dragons making no attempt whatsoever to actually attack the night king, 
  to be fair , i do n't think daenerys knew who was the night 's king until after her dragon was killed . 
  to be fair , neither do i. 
  since start of 2016 primaries . 
  someone photoshop them out , to give stalin purge vibe . 
  oh that 's just bad writing . 
  pope benedict xvi was n't even that bad , he just lacked charisma and looked like a villain . 
  he pretty much continued what pope john paul ii was doing , just again lacked charisma to be as effective . 
  but yes , pope francis is still far superior alternative in every way . 
  that 's not fair , it was mandatory in nazi germany for every boy to join hitler 's youth . 
  he was lucky he was too young to be conscripted into volkssturm . 
   do n't have so many god damned babies ( the world can not sustain such a population ) . 
  considering overpopulation issues is only caused in india , china and few other east asian countries , none of which have significant christian populace , that 's not really effective . 
  now massive waste of resources that westerns do , like in us where like half of edible food is thrown to waste and never eaten , is an actual issue we need to fight against . 
  well those are federal agents , just of other country . 
  a lot of people seem to mix having a high intellect with actually just being apathetic cunts . 
  you have to put `` np '' instead of `` www '' , not both at same time , otherwise you only get `` insecure page '' message . 
  no , rommel did n't took part of assassination plot . 
  he knew about it happening , but he refused to join it while also did n't want to report it . 
  rommel was an opportunistic shit , he only waited on who will win out in the end and then join the winning side . 
  however he idiotically did n't anticipated hitler will be mad at him for not reporting the plot to murder him . 
  that is a very stupid ending . 
   ugh ... it 's serbian, 
  croatian dub is even worse . 
  we used to do great dub work many years ago , what the hell happened ? 
  i 'm pretty sure much higher likelihood many would be playing god-emperor with use of advance technology to rule over stone age natives and escalate their technological advancement to massive degree . 
  also probably accidentally kill most of them through disease alone . 
  if i was stranded on a planet with no return home , my first thought or even a last one would not be , let 's destroy our advance technology and go back to stone age . 
  at least not get rid of advanced medicine like vaccines to avoid mass deaths of kids in their infancy . 
  but each to their own i guess . 
  yeah , what himmler did is to evolve concentration camps into industrialized extermination camps . 
  now that shit is fucked up yo . 
   if you do n't have another mouse ready , i hope you 're good at navigating your computer using your keyboard .
