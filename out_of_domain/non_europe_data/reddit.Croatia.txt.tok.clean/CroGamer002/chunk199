  that has to be the most confusing gibberish of someone explaining why he/she hates my nationality . 
  and that says a lot . 
  ouch .

  it will be months for me . 
  moving to ireland in little over 2 weeks and not gon na bring my pc with me ( parents will ship it to me weeks or months later when it is clear i 'll stay long term ) , so not worth for me to buy the game right now . 
  ah well , maybe i 'll be able to get the game by steam winter sale , even if just 10 % on sale . 
  burn them all !, 
  you can hear bell ringing , but just barely .

   the country is fucked beyond all help at this point, 
  creationists are still strong in us education system , so let 's not go that far . 
  now they 're just copying russian propaganda . 
  i remember back in 2014 when one russian outlet ( rt or sputnik ) claim they would conquer germany within few days and only because tanks would need refuelling , otherwise would be even shorter . 
  oooh , they have to make that as a quest in mortal empires campaign . 
  finally i got those 4 dlc 's . 
  i 'm only missing norsca now , which i wo n't get for long a while .

  [ so ~ ~ some old dude that i never heard of before ~ ~ bob dylan is getting sued by french croats for hate speech , due to saying some nonsense . 
  ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/30/bob-dylan-sued-croatian-group_n_4365425.html ), 
  however not gon na talk about him , but on the written article that i stumble upon in [ r/croatia ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/1u1b3k/bob_dylan_sued_by_croatian_group_for_comments/ ) . 
   it 's those last few words that caused the stir . 
  ** harking back to centuries-old religious conflict between the majority roman catholic croats and the christian orthodox serbs ** as well as further rivalry that sprang up during world war ii , dylan referenced the bad relations that exist between the two groups . 
  amid lingering memories of the croatian war of independence that lasted from 1991 to 1995 , the france-based croatian community group in question has brought a lawsuit after finding dylan 's comments unsettling . 
  why is that bad history ? 
  for starters , conflict between the croats and serbs is not religious one . 
  it 's purely based on ethnic and national tensions . 
  while some religious figures did played ( some still do even today ) part in making tensions even worse , it was still from their nationalistic views . 
  not religious views . 
  another bad history is length of the conflict . 
  conflict did n't happen until after world war 1 . 
  which is , well , little less then a century ago . 
  let alone centuries . 
  in matter of fact , serbs and croats lived in very friendly relations ( many serbs taken refuge in austrian controlled croatia and both nations fought against common enemy ottoman muslims for centuries ) until after the formation of yugoslavian monarchy . 
  pan-nationalistic idea of yugoslavia would n't even exist , let alone actually be put in action , if croats and serbs hated each other guts for centuries .

  ** who 's barry m. 
  he 's a assistant history professor in medgar evers college in new york and vice-president of memorial park of the holocaust in brooklyn . 
  he 's most known for defending dictator slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 , calling kosovo liberation army a fascist paramilitary force and he bizarrely called [ alija izetbegovi\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alija_izetbegovi%c4%87#early_life ) a ww2 war criminal . 
  oh boy , what a guy . 
  ** what did he do ? 
  well he sent [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sufuefn.jpg ) to fifa , concerning the appeal case over [ controversy with croatian football player \u0160imuni\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josip_%c5%a0imuni%c4%87#salute_after_croatia-iceland_game ) . 
  ** what is and why is it bad a history ? 
  his claim that croats were a minority pre-holocaust withing independent state of croatia is an absolute nonsense . 
  as well as exaggerated number of killed serbs and jews in holocaust . 
  [ according to german ministry of foreign affairs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independent_state_of_croatia#population ) , population demographics of independent state of croatia was was approximately 6,285,000 of which 3,300,000 were croats , 1,925,000 were serbs , 700,000 were muslims , 150,000 germans , 65,000 czechs and slovaks , 40,000 jews , and 30,000 slovenes . 
  now you can question that source to since it was made by nazi germany , however there was a census made in 1931 by kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  [ census of serbian population within modern borders of croatia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbs_of_croatia#demographics ) shows that 636,518 of serbs lived and made 16.81 % of total population that was 3,785,455 . 
  [ different source of croat population within modern croatian borders ] ( http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/croatia/about/population/ ) is 2,481,000, 
  [ census of religions within modern borders of bosnia and herzegovina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_bosnia_and_herzegovina#1931 ) shows there were 1,028,139 of serbian orthodox christians ( mostly serbs ) , 718,079 of sunni muslims , 547,949 of catholics ( mostly croats ) and others 29,388 . 
  so yeah , his numbers are hugely far off from reality . 
  only to serve the purpose to exaggerate numbers of deaths done by nazi croatia . 
  most commonly accepted number among historians is around 100,000 and 300,000 of killed serbs with around 12,000-30 ,000 of jews and 27,000 roma . 
  too claim 700,000 of serbs were killed in the holocaust is very absurd , considering serbs still remained to have significant population in croatia and still the largest nationality in bosnia post-ww2 . 
  while also it would require for nazi croatian concentration camps to works like auschwitz for 3 and half years straight , despite it 's economy was in giant shitter and had very little resources to pull of such thing while still required to give it 's resources and manpower to nazi germany and fascist italy war efforts . 
  as well it would mean nazi croatia somehow killed nearly 1/6 of it 's total population . 
  and whole time was fighting against [ yugoslav partisans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans ) who 's numbers ranged from [ 80,000 to 800,000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans#composition ) !, 
  with that [ overall death count of yugoslavia in ww2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslavia_in_world_war_ii#casualties ) goes little over 1,000,000 and 500,000 of that were civilians . 
  so yeah , his numbers are hugely far off . 
  as on the jews , he claims around 40,000 were killed . 
  except that 's exactly how many jews lived in independent state of croatia , like i mentioned previously . 
  with that 9,000 of them survived the war . 
  as well large numbers of jew were extracted to german concentration camps , while also many joined yugoslav partisans and got killed during guerrilla warfare . 
  so officially considered numbers are going around 12,000-30 ,000 of jews killed by nazi croatian holocaust , not 40,000 . 
  i recently exported my ck2 israel game to eu4 and i 'm currently fixing borders , cultures , cores and so on . 
  i 've done some progress but i 'm stuck on few things . 
  like i do n't know how to change flags , since most of muslim nations that got exported have christian flags . 
  which just looks plain silly . 
  i also would like to know how to create a new country , as i want to give possibility for kurds to become independent through rebellion , creating vassal or liberation . 
  any help would be appreciated . 
  i 'm trying to buy metro franchise pack and i keep getting error message :, 
   your purchase has not been completed . 
  the payment processor has reported an authorization failure . 
  please select a different payment method . 
  when i went to check my paypal i noticed i got transaction list of payments being denied . 
  all were also withdrawn in croatian kuna , despite my primary currency on paypal is euro , my debit card connected with paypal and so is on steam . 
  i never had croatian kuna on my paypal nor i ever set up to have it and even then steam does n't accept that currency . 
  so i 'm utterly confused why is this being done and no idea is this a problem on steam or paypal side . 
  i even tried to buy steam wallet money , but got same result . 
  since it is related to steam , i wonder did others had similar problem and have a solution . 
  whatever it is issue on steam , paypal or perhaps both . 
  thanks for anyone trying to help me , in advance .
