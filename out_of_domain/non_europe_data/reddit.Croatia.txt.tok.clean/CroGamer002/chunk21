  oh boy how would greece , cyprus and armenia be happy if usa decides to `` liberate '' turkey . 
  you have just been added on nsa 's watch list . 
  2 more strikes and we are sending a drone over your home . 
  have a nice day . 
  heh , croatian catholic cardinal may as well create his own schism . 
  guy is very backwards and more fundamentalist then the previous pope . 
  only reason he does n't do it is because he get 's a fat paycheck from the vatican and from the state too , due to vatican treaty croatia has . 
   but it is making me question my position about a few things . 
  do tell more . 
  how can you be a pessimist despite dominating noobs on bf4 ? 
  eh , \u0161to je to ? 
  oooooh , to . 
  ok , i just imagined the headline . 
  `` pope saved by an atheist kidney ! '', 
  now for that i would love to see reaction from everyone . 
  he was definitely deeply conservative and traditionalist . 
  though you have no idea how bad is croatian cardinal . 
  samo nemoj pokazivati [ njegov stav o knji\u017enici aleksandrije ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1nqrl0/carl_sagan_the_library_of_alexandria_and_the/ ) . 
  someone should mod tf2 with that , already . 
  both the doctor and child are like `` bitch please '' . 
  i wonder how long until illuminati controlled valve bans you . 
  also it 's for the best to have tax 50 % for middle and rich tax , so they can have own money to improve your economy . 
  to je bilo interesatno za pro\u010ditat . 
  i see nothing wrong with it . 
  i always have such things in paradox and total war games . 
  but you get to see bad fb comments !, 
  that 's assuming ryse : sons of rome is a video game . 
  game is nothing but a long tech demo with quick time events . 
  not just a fantasy , very dull and uninspired fantasy . 
  jokes aside , when the fuck was usa at war with russia ? 
  i 'd question china too , as only time usa and china were at war was only during korean war . 
  croatia , why are you annexing italian and slovenian provinces ? 
  annex back bosnia !!, 
  hmh , there were no proxy wars over yugoslavia . 
  and yugoslavia hated ussr ever since stalin-tito split . 
  tempted to send that to / r/nottheonion too . 
  some support is n't a proxy war . 
  [ success !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vrr9ng7re0 ), 
  we corrected that by laying off our previous coach . 
  so much mismanagement . 
  this is oddly fitting for current situation in ukraine . 
  dude , their con for cod ghost is `` maps are too large '' . 
  weird , when i released croatia as germany ( austria was in my sphere when i formed germany ) , it got modern borders only . 
  while i released slovenia later on , though still kept trieste . 
  oh right , forgot about that one . 
  but besides kotor , it still get 's only modern borders for me . 
  ooooooh . 
  that makes sense , then . 
  i pretty much released them , instead of liberating through war . 
  plus , croatia has cores on kotor , hence that extra from modern borders . 
  slovenia big and stronk !, 
  that map is called [ shipment ] ( http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/shipment ) . 
  croatia to start game with brazil ?!, 
  * weeps in the corner *, 
  why do we start like this ? 
  i 'm not that evil , man . 
  no , to je samo skoro nemogu\u0107 san . 
  it is for croatia . 
  one word . 
  it 's still unknown for how long we wo n't have mand\u017euki\u0107 . 
  it could still be just 1 game . 
  though at same time , we 're in no shortage of great strikers . 
  oli\u0107 , rakiti\u0107 , eduardo and petri\u0107 . 
  sure , mario is our the best player , however we 're not depending solely on him like portugal with ronaldo . 
  just saying we ca n't be judged due to lackluster qualifications . 
  i 'm not saying mexico is terrible . 
  i 'm merely saying croatia ca n't be judged due to lackluster qualifications . 
  basically , we wo n't see real croatia and mexico until world cup . 
  or friendlies before it . 
  insanity and paranoia makes that too hard . 
  not only she 's allowed to vote , but also allowed to drive . 
  i 'm honestly more worried with mexico , then brazil . 
  heck even cameroon is more worrying then brazil , since those two should be very tricky . 
  now create new one `` racist + '' . 
  they better allow public beta testing then !, 
  i believe this disaster of alternative history was posted here before . 
  wait , it says this is / r/badhistory , yet comments are right from / r/conspiratard ? 
  do n't they want to be removed ? 
  just give them clay and problem solved . 
  what 's next , he does n't like football ? 
  that 's assuming chile wo n't break one or both of them . 
  you 're just bitter we defeated you in 1998 in quarterfinals . 
  spain is still having a grudge on catalonian best club still demolishing spanish best club . 
  i do n't think believing in life outside earth counts as a conspiracy theory . 
  though aliens abducting/observing humanity while government is covering it up in other hand ... 
  1944 world cup , hosted in france . 
  nope , neither drunk nor drugged . 
  that 's her `` normal '' driving , while driving two kids . 
  sramim se \u0161to sam glaso za tu bandu . 
  hmh , that 's not what i meant . 
  guy in video says cops stopped her later on , discovering she driven two kids while no influence of alcohol or drugs in her . 
  actually that was a decision made between newly formed state of slovenes , croats and serbs and kingdom of serbia , after austria-hungary collapsed . 
  state shs had to do it , since it had no means of defending itself from italy to take territory it was promised to get by the allies off austria-hungary . 
  and since kingdom of serbia was part of the allies , state shs saved itself nearly intact ( istria and city of rijeka were annexed by italy ) by being joined into serbia as kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes , later named yugoslavia . 
  well no croat hated serbs for them being orthodox , that 's for sure . 
  it 's fully national and ethnic tension , not religious . 
   and humble, 
  lolno, 
  he refused to pay any tax , once he got into power .
