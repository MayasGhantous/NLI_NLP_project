  when the hell was the last time al qaeda even attempted to strike outside middle east ? 
  actually , when the hell did even try to do multiple simultaneous attacks last time too ? 
  we croats ruled by austria and we 're still calling you austrija . 
  down with the oppressor !, 
  they have n't been even caught to attempt any similar attack since , well , ever . 
  also , bioware edmonton has 2 branches itself . 
  dragon age team and unknown new ip team ( previously me team ) . 
  that 's for greeks to say , canada . 
  but it does n't give as big emotional reaction , man . 
  no , you 're just canada . 
   the nazis did n't believe in ** equal opportunities for men ** . 
  but ofcourse !, 
  they were nothing but a feminist tool to suppress men !, 
  thing is , at least from where i live , we 're not thought about history of christianity but some few segments in both history and catechism class . 
  neither in public school nor in church . 
  basically , people are left on their own to learn about council of nicaea and other important historic events . 
  hey , i 'm mostly joking man . 
  besides it 's too late to change their name , that 's how they call themselves now . 
  only problem that will cause is for wikipedia needing to put `` do n't mistake macedonia with ancient macedonia '' . 
  stealing greek history in other hand is unacceptable . 
  who does n't read that in harbinger 's voice ? 
  well , they were aggressors in 2nd war . 
  also , croats also played major part to liberate serbia from nazi germany and croatia . 
  considering tito was a croat ( though considered himself a yugoslav ) and 1/4 of yugoslav partisans were croats , i 'd say that 's major . 
  vidi , vidi . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  you can say that for any sort of group . 
  so we wait for uganda to invade kenya , then un get 's a casus belli . 
  usa , you 're allowed to bomb them with shit-ton-of freedom now . 
  i had similar happen to me . 
  did n't play for a month , due to how i raged . 
  more likely an issue with game engine , depending on how large was the battle . 
  so , anything else you can say about game but it looks very pretty ? 
  catholic , though i 'm like 3 weeks late to respond . 
   and clearly , this guy has not played a single paradox game . 
  i hate france there . 
  nearly never allies with me , never helps me in war when allied , nearly always back-stabs me and usually steamrolls me . 
  i was so happy in victoria 2 with my germany playthrough where i got hugely op and just steamrolled france , even when fighting on several fronts against italy , russia and ottomans . 
  germany is so op , man . 
  i do n't know what you said , but i do n't need google translator to understand what you said . 
   war of 1812 - lost to said empire , had their purty little white house burned down by canadians , of all people, 
  if it was n't for napoleon , usa would have got terrible territorial losses . 
  instead of lucking out with status quo , since uk needed credibility to not allow their allies against napoleon to expand their borders . 
  well it 's about an insightfull as saying sky is blue and water is wet . 
  jesus , steguweit sounds like a guy slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 hired for his propaganda . 
  and us generals were mostly ( key word mostly , not all ) shit at the time . 
  `` the croats are cultured , but backstabbing '', 
  odakle to ? 
  now that what makes me interested to check the game . 
  thanks . 
  ca n't believe i believed in that shit few years ago . 
  edit - o\u0161o sam vidjet [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inhh4-nhzmw ) . 
  i truly do hope he 's the only one . 
  that would be some orgy , if you 're worshiping polytheistic religion . 
  man [ that song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fadcahjn-s ) is stuck in my head , again . 
  yeah , he should n't be a good person . 
  that 's for pussies . 
  why is your name green in first post , but not in second post ? 
   christianity was made up by the romans to pacify the jewish rebellions ? 
  no way that plan can backfire !, 
  well i learned something today . 
  you ca n't tell me what to do !, 
  merry fucking christmas !, 
   fetish for pregnant dinosaurs, 
  that 's oddly specific . 
  heh , guy that has a voice in his head that is actually voice of reason . 
  to me stvarno iznenadilo . 
  well unless nk get 's lucky ( and insane enough ) and manages to nuke seoul . 
  that would be near destruction of the city . 
  and that 's the most that could do so , they 'd get wiped out but sk and usa pretty quickly by next month ( being generous to nk , i know ) of nuking seoul . 
  man , and i was wondering what kind of patients give gifts to their doctors . 
  poor south korea . 
  everyone thinks north is the toughest there , just because it yells a lot . 
   i had always accepted the mass media 's portrayal of gays as a colorful minority like the croatians, 
  i do n't get it . 
  plus , roman legions carry massive shields and have testudo formation to deflect range attacks . 
  macedonian phalanxes ? 
  yeah , i 'm sure they 'd get their asses handed to to by horse archers . 
  ooooooh , that was an awesome move by alexander . 
   destruction of all existing copies of all the books by richard dawkins, 
  where do i sign up ? 
  [ citation needed ], 
  unmanned drones and soldier robots , ofcorse !, 
  someone burns just one book for attohypatia , fundie neckbears burn down a table in library for millihypatia , someone causes a fire alarm by smoking in major university library for centihypatia , rick santorum enters in library of congress and talks how evil it is for decihypatia and there 's a sex tape scandal with alex jones on the internet that causes many to leave it permenatly for gigahypatia .

  ** most informative rebuttal ** : well , [ smileyman 's rebuttal ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1nqrl0/carl_sagan_the_library_of_alexandria_and_the/ ) of sagan 's claims that burning of library of alexandria set humanity 's advances back , is the most informative i could think off . 
  as for `` best honored opponent '' , i 'll need examples since i have n't seen any of those threads . 
  marshal josip broz tito will come out of his grave , just to smack that little bitch that claims he was a stalinist . 
  oh come on , did n't you want for him to buy shit-ton-of nukes ? 
  it can go full nazi now . 
  well that explains 2nd balkan war .
