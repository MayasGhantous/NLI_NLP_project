  koja je to strava i uza\u0161 is ' 92 ? 
  damn , i was just thinking of that accident when i 've seen op 's pic . 
  croatia is finally gon na get it 's european gold , i guarantee it !, 
  and that 's why serbia will never join eu . 
   ( as well as the achievements of eastern european cultures , which are n't europe for some reason ), 
  i truly do n't get that stance . 
  til tourism is inappropriate and self-hate . 
  while i do have my doubts hitler offed himself in berlin , it 's just plain silly to claim soviets covered it up . 
  just imagine what would happen if we discover hitler escaped and soviets covered that up . 
  not very pretty for the russians , let alone during cold war . 
  mistaking with monarchy yugoslavia means death !, 
  you pay for this insult , nazi !, 
  we should have a sidebar . 
  [ so my mother dig up some old flags ] ( http://imgur.com/a/a3n8o ) . 
  i have no idea how we have them . 
  well i have n't dwell into that topic for a long time , so only thing i can offer is no body no dead . 
  with that many nazis managed to escape both the allies and soviets and fine refuge in one of south american countries . 
  as well hitler had huge amount of luck by evading assassination attempts , so i would n't be surprised his insane luck saved him from getting caught ever . 
  i know no evidence on it and i 'm only assuming stuff , but still my doubts exist . 
  yet she 's a hippie commie . 
  then again , she opposes gay marriage and it 's still a christian . 
  that 's what happens when you live in communist state of yugoslavia , that is unable to remove religion without destroying itself in civil war . 
  always making [ statistical anomalies ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_vatican_city#petty_crimes_per_capita ) . 
  oboje . 
  or just bad in geography . 
  for example bosnia and albania are waaaaaay off . 
  jebiga , to se doga\u0111a kada glasa\u0161 za mafija\u0161e . 
  paradox games always troll me , so i say this confirms it 's made by paradox . 
  sooo , how do you call merge of state and modern corporation ? 
    would you be happy if the us was supplying oil to a nation that was invading other countries ? 
   * i would n't give a shit . 
  it 's not my problem . 
  spoken like a true switz !, 
  shit , that subreddit exist ? 
  subbed, 
  no , scandinavians are the whitest of the white . 
  oh wow , few days there was a thread on him in / r/todayilearned and considered how badass guy is at not giving up to die . 
  now i feel sad to learn he died yesterday . 
  and reason why that happen is due to serbian supremacy over other nationalities in kingdom of yugoslavia , which given birth to anti-serb sentiment . 
  well in eu4 ( i think also in eu3 too ) is portrayed to be of serbian culture . 
  which is incorrect , as until after ottomans conquering bosnia , it 's majority of population was croatian and ruled by croatian nobility . 
  as well bosnia was n't eastern orthodox but in bogomilism , though understandably heresies overall do n't exist in eu4 game mechanics . 
  though ruling nobility was mainly catholic , but even then it 's understandable to not be catholic withing game . 
  except in winning lottery 's . 
  pope , what are you doing here ? 
  nah , that 's not how catholics work . 
  they 're more subtle . 
  i bet his mother is a justin bieber . 
  he-he , he-he , he-he . 
  the fuck is a / r/conspirology ? 
  he does make one point . 
  i have n't seen a single peer reviewed article either supporting nor denying global warming . 
   i mean by that logic i guess everybody in europe in the last 500 was a devout greenlandish patriot . 
  blasted !, 
  our secret is out !, 
   serbia 58.2, 
  wait , really ?

  man that goal should n't have happen , but thankfully it did n't matter . 
   although we 've never been accused of being fascists ... 
  that 's easy , we just let some racists to invade this subreddit and mods ban them for racism . 
  then we 'd get accused for being fascists . 
  damn it , how i missed that ?

  here 's a thing . 
  they 're cheating british bastards . 
  no , eu is a pathetic joke that wants to become usa 2.0 . 
  yet , still better then be puppet state of putin 's russia . 
   how does this get 13 thumbs up ? 
  every reply to comments counts as thumbs up , for some retard reason . 
  well i noticed one bad history and bad geography . 
  croatia was never fully under ottoman rule . 
  while most of croatia was under it 's rule in past , it was around middle of 17 century . 
  and after that not even an millimeter of modern croatian territory was ever under ottomans . 
  that was a century and a half before creation of this eurocentric bigoted map . 
  that 's a giant gap . 
  edit - holy shit , somehow he put ethiopia in central africa . 
  while still having abyssinia on the map , which is ethiopia . 
  and they 're corrupt christians ? 
  what ? 
  well croatia was mostly under ottoman rule during the middle of 17th century . 
  though after that not even milimeter of modern croatian territory was under their rule . 
  which makes like a century and a half diffrence gap , in territory of austria and ottomans in croatia . 
  talk about bad geography of that time . 
  article forgets to mention that nations under austria-hungary won in war , despite being on losing side . 
  just because they got independence or formed own states union . 
  je li gay otporna ? 
  youtube comments . 
  i never heard of that conspiracy theory before .
