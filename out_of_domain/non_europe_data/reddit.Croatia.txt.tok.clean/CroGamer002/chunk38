  this guys in ukraine are more irrelevant then the damn golden dawn without any outside help . 
  and with right sector leader killed in police shootout , while svoboda party is taking hits after one of their mp 's assaulting that state broadcast and now sacked their minister of defense , they 're totally screwed . 
  fascists in ukraine are a total joke and ukrainians are not desperate nor without other choices to let them take charge . 
  yeah , their party member got sacked from minister position . 
  and with right sector leader being killed in police shoot out , fascists in ukraine are now doomed . 
  good riddance . 
  for right sector , yes . 
  however svoboda is trying to become moderate in their beliefs , though with no real successes . 
  their party members are out of control , because that 's the kind of crowd they were attracting for years . 
  and with interim government doing a lot of efforts to retain control over the country , it 's getting more and more unlikely ukraine will fall under anarchy and chaos . 
  so i would n't worry too much about them , unless some drastic event happens . 
  even if it did , i doubt they would waste it to spy on transdniestria . 
  `` the pope '', 
  which one ? 
  there 's 266 of them . 
  and why is greenpeace there ? 
  that 's not a person . 
  hell , even the amish are there . 
  hah , i was actually tempted to post that here . 
  but that would mean i actually have real confidence that i know the shit i 'm talking about . 
  progressives are anti-religion ? 
  i truly just hope creator merely mistakes secularism with that . 
  yeah , like winning the world wa ... oh . 
  murdoch empire ? 
  the hell is that ? 
  well fort was n't made for early 20th century warfare , hence it 's uselessness . 
  though , i may be just as ignorant . 
  yeah , reject support from overwhelming majority demographic of world population and demonize them at same time too . 
  that 's gon na work out so well . 
  hmh , both right sector and svoboda are fascist parties . 
  only svoboda tries to become moderate about it . 
  and re-read entire conversation i did , for context why i 'm talking about svoboda here . 
   first the most prominent and active right sector leader gets ** executed ** by sbu, 
  no , he resisted police arrest with a gun , even after police shot him in the leg . 
  that 's not an execution . 
  that 's an insulting statement to the most euromaidan protestors . 
  except what 's said it 's a total nonsense . 
  pretty sure right sector is anti-semitic . 
  and i said svoboda is ** trying ** to be moderate , not that it actually is . 
  oh boy does it fails to do it too . 
  however , russia media is full of lies and propaganda over the whole crisis . 
  freedom of speech should n't be freedom to lie , especially without consequences . 
  and this are the enacted consequences . 
  [ well my country finally does something right and in great way too ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/21emzb/croatian_constitutional_court_decides_all_kids/ ) . 
  vaccination was mandatory in croatia long before this ruling . 
  ruling merely validated that law . 
  well , croatia is geographically southeastern european country . 
  damn it , i wanted to post that . 
  with a clever title . 
  anyway , screw you guys in / r/conspiracy , my country is gon na rather remain healthy then to bother with misguided ideological thinking . 
  you 're a sociopath and deluded by your misguided ideological beliefs . 
  you 're getting an upvote for proper use of the meme , though . 
  i feel dirty for upvoting the thread , only because he 's using the meme properly . 
  ( s ) he is secretly transgender . 
  holy shit , 3 stars hotels i was in look like luxury penthouses compared to that . 
  if they use crisis actors to stage false flag ops , you 'd think they would use different people each operation to not get caught in their scam . 
  yep , from croatia . 
  and yeah , this should be an issue at all . 
  yet it is in many western countries , for some reason . 
  and this whole anti-vaccine movement in croatia started only recently and already got bitch-slapped hard by the court . 
  well that 's because north koreans are not allowed to use internet . 
  i do n't see the religious reason over being anti-vaccine . 
  croatia is quite of a religious country too . 
  i still think he should retire very soon . 
  better leave when you 're on glorious position , then very beaten and weaken by age . 
  that 's how vaccinations work , at least in croatia . 
  you 're vaccinated in reasonable time spam difference , not all at once . 
  what ? 
  hell no . 
  unemployment is one of the highest in eu , bloated bureaucracy that makes investments and starting new private business near impossible , inept government and political parties , some political parties are just mafia ( especially the croatian conservative party hdz ) , dumb judicial system , mass corruption and few months ago de facto banned gay marriage . 
  i want to believe !, 
  is it ironic if putin is aware he 's full of shit ? 
  is it cheating if i say what i know about croatia , since i 've born , raised and still live there ? 
  / r/india ?!, 
  what 's going on there ? 
  sounds like a re-run of every damn elections . 
  well croatia was lead by nazis during ww2 , so does that count ? 
  man you mods are getting slightly too strict on r5 . 
  oh but it 's ukraine that is actually fascist here . 
  oh boy , us domestic political nonsense is getting international headlines once again . 
  that 's assuming croatia is n't politically diverse . 
  just because we in croatia are overwhelmingly of same nationality , race and ethnicity , does n't mean we 're politically united . 
  in fact we have multiple party system , so we 're more divided then americans who have only 2 parties . 
  and pseudo-science is still rampant in croatia , though not in same extent as in the us . 
  but enough to be very worrying . 
  yesterday croatia was top on reddit for bitch-slapping anti-vaccine on supreme court . 
  today croatia is getting embarrassed by letting pseudo-science documentary `` water the mystery of life '' to be aired on public television as part of science program , despite major outrage of scientists . 
   because greece has been oppressed by the ottomans so ... it 's time ... to oppress them back ? 
  soon croatia will oppress back hungarians , austrians and italians !, 
  i love how you misspelled everyone 's names .

  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  ah , you put an extra '' . '', 
  between `` np '' . 
   i d guess abstainers are not fond of usa hipocricy but dont want to worsen their relationships with usa . 
  or they do find russia to be a bad guy this , but ca n't afford to vote against russia . 
  whatever for economic or diplomatic reasons . 
  brics merely do n't want to kick out russia from g20 , hence they `` support '' russia . 
  [ except there fucking was a referendum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovan_independence_referendum,_1991 ) . 
  so [ russia today ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/21jqnf/obama_states_kosovo_left_serbia_only_after/ ) is trying to sell a story there was never a kosovar referendum for independence .
