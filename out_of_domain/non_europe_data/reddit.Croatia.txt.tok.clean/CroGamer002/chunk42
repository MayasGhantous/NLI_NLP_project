  man , it 's too costly for me . 
  i 'm gon na need to wait for it to get on huge sale . 
  nah , cannibalism is worse for me . 
  why is istria white ? 
  they have n't separated from croatia still . 
  they ca n't just be let to vote , because referendum demands are totally illegal . 
  not only they want referendum at absurdly short time , but there 's no legal basis for them to even have a right to secede . 
  neither the us nor russia give to state nor autonomy a right of secession from federation , nor does ukraine that is n't even a federation . 
  legal basis first has to be made , then you can talk about referendum for secession for around a year before putting it to vote . 
  / r/conspiracy is that way, 
  it 's not ironic , it 's hypocritical . 
  benedict xvi covered up those crimes while he was a bishop in germany , not francis i. 
  ** putin ** : hahahahaha , shut up !, 
  damn fascists , now they dare to tell me what to do . 
  it 's my russian right to oppress my citizens !, 
  wait , cersai did it with lancel too ?!, 
  ugh ... too much incest . 
  when you have thor 's hammer and you pretty much do everything by yourself , it 's hardly like that . 
  well that 's weird , would n't federalization make such thing ? 
  then again when i look at bosnian ethnic based federalization , i just cringe at same happening to ukraine . 
  yeah , i remember reading the comments . 
  it was genuine . 
  ah , it makes sense now . 
  vice news has it 's own website , in which they also have many written opinion piece articles . 
  they 're little bit ... not on same quality journalism vice news does in video format . 
   does this mean that i can use my google searches for `` hitler spaceship '' as proof of nazis on the moon ? 
  you say like it did n't actually happen . 
  til imdb gives automatic title translation . 
  they do n't have access to google , youtube nor facebook . 
  i think they do have access to twitter . 
  we killed it !, 
  not reel !, 
  well , i got 2 of those right at least . 
  basically it says exactly like original title in english , only lamer . 
  except those were n't puppeteer either . 
  what a cheap propaganda . 
  talking about video , not john kerry statement . 
  shit , the thing is still alive !, 
  mobilize all troops !, 
  that 's a huge generalization . 
  because kiev is afraid their actions may cause a massacre that russia would exploit as an excuse for invasion to `` restore order '' and `` protect russians '' . 
  that was in donetsk , not kharkov . 
  to make it simple . 
  1980 's yugoslav economic collapse , tito died , rise of nationalism and ultranationalism , milo\u0161evi\u0107 was a giant totalitarian ultranationalist cunt , slovenia and croatia wanted out , milo\u0161evi\u0107 was being an ass about it and attacked . 
  you mean like hitler , when he pulled it off with austria and czechoslovakia ? 
  geez , what a good legend to be . 
  they were too much professional to be bunch militant self-defense units . 
  this are damn soldiers , most likely russians . 
  this is a damn blatant invasion !, 
  you keep using that word , i do n't think you know what it means . 
  so they 're not even hiding themselves this time . 
  with top of the line russian weaponry and equipment ? 
  my ass . 
  no way an average ukrainian resident can afford such weaponry on it 's own , let alone weapons that are only accessible to russian military and anti-terrorist units . 
  yeah , sure . 
  the most incompetent and inept us agency totally managed to pull it off . 
  happy birthday , here 's an upvote since i 'm too poor to give actual gifts . 
  well , at least i upvoted you 250 times . 
  i do n't think i 've upvoted anyone above 100 , weirdly . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  never mind , i upvoted / u/smileyman over 400 times . 
  i give chart points for adding titoism . 
  you do n't pass such drastic laws in such short time . 
  well video is gone now . 
  good , ukraine 's inaction was hugely frustrating to lot 's of people . 
  mostly to ukrainians , ofcourse . 
  while it 's fun to poke at those charts , someone should really find some other bad politics content . 
  no , i am not doing that . 
  i refuse to search at tabloid comments section to show how brain-dead people can be from croatia and serbia . 
   i unsubbed from els, 
  a what now ? 
  lack of firearms , bats and burning tires caught me by surprise . 
  ah , i kinda suspected it . 
  fox news loves putin and russia , so that 's nonsense from the get go . 
  it 's kind of a big trend in ukraine right now . 
  first euromaidan , then pro-russian separatists . 
  he 'll die in a month from natural causes . 
  like in last minute . 
  strangely , crowd is very calm at gunshots . 
  i smell edited sound effects . 
  i guess , though i have hard time buying that crowd can be so calm during gunshots . 
  dunno , russia kinda has a trend to bully anyone it does n't like for past few centuries . 
  yeah , he 's probably a creep . 
  eu is an empire ? 
  lol !, 
  to be fair , most leaders let someone else to do it all the time . 
   i believe first thing that russians will suggest osce delegation to monitor will be disarmament of pravy sector and various kiev self defence forces, 
  i think on that part , russia and new ukraine government would finally agree on something . 
  euromaidan was mostly a peaceful protest , however yanukavoch 's illegal and tyrannical actions forced euromaidan to rebel against him and overthrow him . 
  they tried hard to get peaceful deal , but yanukovich was too stubborn and even broke one deal he agreed on , that resulted him fleeing the country . 
  i do wonder how would referendum go , if it comes to action . 
  it 's illegal and clearly it lacks option that majority of population in the region wants . 
  would n't surprise me that over 90 % vote to be annexed by russia , but voter turnout proves to be less then 10 % . 
  well you got to get morale and discipline up . 
  no , it was over a year away at the time . 
  later reduced to later this year , however yanukovich broke the deal only a day later . 
  only after he got ousted , are the elections now a month away . 
  crimea in other hand is a total joke . 
  it 's referendum made no legal sense , illegally made , under illegal circumstances and voter fraud was more then highly likely . 
  now the eu trade agreement would be great for ukraine .
