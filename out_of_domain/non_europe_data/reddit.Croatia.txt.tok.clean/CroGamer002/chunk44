  which it ai n't , despite few radicals that had no real power in the party nor government . 
   so in some of their first sessions they decided to change the constitution, 
  more like it created it 's own constitution , not changed it . 
  croatia seceded from yugoslavia , legal by yugoslav 1972 constitution , so it had to create it 's own state constitution . 
   but they also changed the founding document of any state to include only croatians as a constitutional nation . 
  its a wierd technicality , which in pratice means constitutional ethnic cleansing . 
  what ? 
  no , it only meant that citizens in newly formed croatia are croatian citizens . 
  as in , have croatian citizenship . 
  which is basically a normal thing for any country . 
   at this point at least , it is important to note , that some areas of newly formed croatia had indiguines serbian population , in other words they lived there since ever . 
  lolno, 
  they slowly mass migrated into krajina and slavonia , after ottomans conquered kingdom of serbia and then bosnia . 
  as ottomans were kicked out of balkans , many migrated back to serbia . 
  however many decided to stay , just like many more stayed in bosnia . 
   so this new croatia comes into being , which in itself was not a popular move among serbian population , then they have the balls to provoke them with such actions . 
  how dares croatian government to legally secede and implement croatian citizenship !, 
   another thing which had a major impact is history of yu , mainly ww2 ( which many people still remember vividly ) or the last ( and ** only ** other ) time croatia was an independent state . 
  [ croatian kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_croatia_%28925%e2%80%931102%29 ) apparently not real . 
   it was during ww2 when german army occupied yugoslavija there was a ** strong ** clero-faschist movement in croatia commonly called ustashi and they were running hitlers puppet state . 
  lolno, 
  usta\u0161e were very obscure movement among croats , having barely 30k members before mussolini gifted them rule . 
  and most of it it was in already italian controlled croatia ( istria peninsular and city of rijeka ) . 
  those guys would have remained obscure , if hitler 's original choice vlatko ma\u010dek , leader of croatian peasant party ( the strongest croatian party during kingdom of yugoslavia ) , refused to collaborate with the axis after occupation of yugoslavia . 
   put all of this together ( and some logistic support from serbian extremist in belgrade ) and you will be declared a saint if you can stop a war ... 
  oh yeah , a tyrant milo\u0161evi\u0107 that wanted to end yugoslavia and enforce serbian nationalism on all yugoslav nations and create greater serbia is totally a saint compared to croatia who went to legally secede due to that tyrant . 
  if it was n't for fal , we would have been able to destroy russian nukes with mere thought by now !, 
   i would call tu\u0111man quite extreeme . 
  he 's definitely extreme on bureaucracy ( seriously , fuck him for ruining my future by his retard economic policies ) , but sure as hell not extreme in nationalism . 
   while writting your constitution you should include serbs more , not like you are doing it now when brussels is forcing you . 
  eeeh , croatian constitution always protected minorities . 
  even more so then some of original eu members ( i 'm looking at you italy and france , how you treat romani ) . 
   there were many serbs who migrated when ottomans invaded ( and dont forget who helped you keep the turks in serbia ) , but there are also many areas ( khm , knin ... ) ** where serbs lived since ever ** . 
  citation needed . 
   usta\u0161e are so obscured , you can still see their signs and symbols all over croatia if you are carefull and know what to look . 
  same reason why you can see kkk and csa signs all over the southern usa . 
  they 're obscure but loud movement . 
  only because if nk does that , it would be it 's death sentence . 
   for example , nobody is going to ask you for id to buy alcohol , or hassle you for drinking a beer in the street , or give you a traffic ticket for not wearing a seat belt . 
  that 's got to be the worst examples of freedom . 
   i assumed your name was crogamer because you were joking about being a different species of gamer , like cro-magnons . 
  sadly , my mind is not that creative . 
  in croatia and bosnia , nato mainly implemented no fly zone and given major reconnaissance assistance to croatian military forces . 
  which were also trained by nato officers . 
  however , nato did n't fight until 1999 in kosovo . 
  by then all conflicts ended in croatia and bosnia . 
  military intervene ? 
  still not good enough excuse . 
  in other words , they 're pathological lairs ? 
  who 's somehow not elected by anyone . 
  perfect excuse for russians , not for international community . 
  everyone ( but syria , north korea and cuba ) would disown russia if they invade ukraine and annex half of country . 
  not even china nor g20 would be able to stay neutral . 
  noooooooooooo !!!, 
  i never got to play medieval 2 mp . 
  but i thought nazism was a feminist agenda to wipe out all men ? 
  damn you turkey !, 
  yet in entire history of mankind , i doubt we still capped to have billion of cops overall worldwide . 
  jesus ai n't real !, 
  --  jesus ... eeeeh ... jesus was liberal ? 
   then establish a pro-russian government , or maybe split the country into two parts . 
  they would do both things . 
  pretty vandalism , but vandalism never-the-less . 
  just for shits and giggles . 
  iran is n't a totalitarian state . 
  for starters , multiparty democracy is allowed and voting fraud ai n't much worse then in most eastern european countries . 
  as well the state ai n't much more oppressive to human rights then russia is . 
  it 's definitely an oppressive authoritarian state , but far from being totalitarian . 
  russians are asleep right now , so that ai n't happening . 
  and it would be in ukraine 's interested to promote protests , as they would outnumber pro-russians by huge amount . 
  though that 's kinda not an option when armed insurgents are holding government buildings , oppressing city residents , robbing stores , taking hostages and killing people . 
  military has to step in so civilians should get out of the way . 
  15 now , as simon was released . 
  i do n't see germany trying to rape poland again , so it 's not repeating . 
  i wish i can buy the game , but my fundings are small and already prioritizing to buy civ v complete when its ' on sale . 
  i hate being poor . 
  still too much for me , as i have no income . 
  all money i have is gift from birthday , which was in february . 
  sending it . 
  one day i 'll repay properly this kindness . 
   should i get myself civ v ? 
  only with expansions . 
  civ v vanilla is mediocre , however expansions make it great . 
  well complete edition is only 10 euros/dollars more expensive then vanilla edition . 
  however expansions individually cost as much as vanilla game , while they 're a ton of dlc 's . 
  seriously , it would cost you over 136 euros ( more so dollars ) to buy everything individually . 
  complete edition bundle is just 40 euros/dollars , so that 's a huge save . 
  and that 's not even on sale offer , so it will get even better soon . 
  that 's why i ca n't wait to buy civ v complete edition on sale . 
  i do n't have a damn clue . 
  it will surely be on summer sale , but before that it 's a giant unknown . 
  or a lucky shot . 
  except if russia invades , every damn relevant country in un would disown russia and put big sanctions on it . 
  china nor g20 ca n't tolerate russian 's blatant aggression on ukraine . 
  and that would to russian economic collapse . 
  so no , putin does n't have best cards in his hand . 
  he just likes to make a show he does have it . 
  if they wo n't invade ( though they already did invaded crimea ) , then putin is bluffing . 
  which means ukraine has no worries to put down the insurgency . 
  if they do invade , this will force china 's hand as this fully goes against their foreign policies .
