  if they do n't act , they lose all credibility over keeping north korea around and gives full legitimacy to tibet independence . 
  and russia 's buffer zone against nato only exists because putin hates the west . 
  nato and eu wanted for russia to join their ranks in long term , but putin is stuck in cold war mentality . 
  with economy collapsing fast in russia , putin is only shooting himself to the foot . 
  well i guess taking all money from switz banks would be a nice pay off . 
  though it did n't control much of the territory , in practice . 
  there was a mass insurgency since the day after paveli\u0107 and his usta\u0161e party was picked by mussolini to lead the country . 
  mostly small isolated groups , but would eventually become heavily organized and massive anti-fascist yugoslav partisans . 
  briliant !, 
  canada will survive . 
  16 kilometers ? 
  why that far from city ? 
  nobody seen that coming . 
  more like ** s ** he knows military intervention would mean economic collapse to russia and giant diplomatic isolation from entire world . 
  ** edited **, 
  you mean like political circus ? 
  i doubt it , they were always unanimous without even act of any political dissidence so far . 
  one with lot 's of explosions . 
  too bad moldavia is too poor and weak to do anything concrete about it . 
  but if russia wo n't invade , ukraine can deal with insurgency on it 's own . 
  i know people who 'd go full rage on such sentence . 
  every damn picture he looks like the damn emperor palapatine . 
  note yourself vatican , do n't elect germans as a pope ever again . 
  except this citizens do n't consider themselves ukrainian citizens and had with open arms welcomed russian invaders to defect . 
  so their treason is not gon na go without a consequence . 
  no , i 'm not . 
  treason ca n't go unpunished . 
  even if not , crimea is still territory under russian occupation . 
  ukraine has no obligation to supply enemy controlled territory . 
  it 's a strategic idiocy to do such thing . 
  most of them choose to be with russia , so they should be supplied by the russians when they so desired to be with them . 
  they picked the wrong choice here , so if they want ukraine to supply them once again they have to kick out russian presence or assist ukrainian military to kick out russians or just not get in the way of ukraine military recapturing it 's land back . 
  anyone who still sticks with russia deserves worse then just not getting free shit from ukraine . 
  yes , this water supply would be given out for free as they do n't pay taxes to ukraine . 
  and since no trade agreement exists with russia over this , they should n't get it for free especially since most choose to defect . 
  well eastern ukraine is nowhere near iraq situation , so ukraine military can contain the problem eventually . 
  russian invasion is once that worries them on do they have luxury to contain the problem on their own . 
  again , it 's a strategic idiocy to do such thing . 
  you do n't supply enemy controlled territory , just because it 's your territory . 
  that 's not how it 's done in real world . 
  what 's that ? 
  so brilliant , yet depressing . 
  protheans are uplifting the romans , i see . 
  well obviously this is how romans expanded their empire . 
  de me ne jebi , to more biti photoshop . 
  mi hrvatine !, 
  you 're drunk . 
  you mean with same army that frequently got lost when invading georgia only a few years ago ? 
  they did n't vote for him . 
  independence , independences everywhere !, 
  would that slovyansk `` mayor '' be joffrey ? 
  til roman empire started to fall just before it even started . 
  but nowhere near in same extent on ukrainian side , like on russian side . 
  naruto must be pissed . 
  but , that means hitler was bad for germany . 
  that ca n't be true , right ? 
  the fuck 's a gypsy culture ? 
  i mean in how many are there and how daring they are in their thuggish behavior . 
  ukrainian thugs looks like schoolyard bullies compared to russian thugs , in ukraine right now . 
  ah , so that 's why he let the allies invade germany . 
  well the point is still the same . 
  oh , well never mind my comment then . 
  well if you do kill 20-30 people on your own , they damn sure should retreat . 
  ili hvata\u0161 ribe ili ide\u0161 na internet . 
  well at least you knew moon landing was legit . 
  yugoslavia also had that going with tito 's death . 
  on the day and hour of of his announced death , sirens would go like that . 
  though it only went for few years because yugoslavia pretty much died after his death . 
  what do they mean by limited abolition ? 
  because that was the only time russians were the good guys in a looooong ass time . 
  i 'm talking about soviet great patriotic war , not ww2 as a whole . 
  otherwise yeah , ussr was far from being a good guy in the ww2 . 
  well this one will be short lived one as russia is nowhere near to ussr level , while china ca n't afford to isolate itself from the west . 
  but if they do n't do it , eastern ukraine will fall under anarchy and putin will step in to `` restore order '' . 
  russian army is a total joke , their economy only exists in oil exports , diplomatically isolate through most of the world and so on . 
  china going with russia over this will not only go against their foreign politics strategy but also risks their economy crumbling as they fully depend on exporting their cheap shit to the west . 
  only countries that support russia are north korea ( lovely ) , syria ( ravaged by civil war ) and venezuela ( only because it hates the usa ) . 
  even the damn belarus shows skepticism onto russia . 
  overall , putin hugely miscalculated on when to act to start new cold war as russia is in no position to even pretend it 's a superpower . 
  oh yeah , cause how could i forget about such relevant country in modern world geopolitics ? 
  no , us police is ruthless and murderous only when they think they can get away with and it 's aimed at people they politically or racially dislike . 
  but when there 's a far-right armed militia setting up illegal checkpoints to protect some ranch farmer who refuses to pay what he owes to the federal government , all of the sudden not even local police force dares to do anything . 
  let along send in swat or national guard against those insurgents . 
  / r/atheism procuriva, 
  well his grandfather and father made sure of that by making car traffic in north korea not existing . 
  well , every us president since nixon . 
  not really important in worldwide theater . 
  ss commanders would n't . 
  is this legitimate ? 
  cause ukraine interior ministers have lied too many time of their operation successes , only to be proven that operation did n't happen or it failed . 
  i truly do hope this news are true , though . 
   american journalist possibly kidnapped ( buzzfeed -- mike giglio ), 
  he was released like 10 minutes ago , along with captured cbs reporters who also got captured an hour earlier . 
  well they should have expected that . 
  ukraine army should n't give any more tolerance to their disobedience . 
  they should consider themselves lucky only one guy was knocked down by an apc or truck . 
  that diplomatic agreement went to waste not even a day after it was signed . 
  and russia was the main factor for that , so those imperialists in kremlin can freely shut the hell up . 
  you mean authorities that were violating their own laws first and started violence first against protestors ? 
  they were acting illegitimately and wrongly !,
