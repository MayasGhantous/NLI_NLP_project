  foot fetish . 
  just , why ? 
  even `` stan '' map is dumb . 
  seriously , pakistan would rather reunite with india then unite with afghanistan . 
  but it 's fun kind of dumb . 
  it should be in / r/mapporncirclejerk though . 
  hold on , i need to claim rest of antarctica for the glorious sealand . 
  to bi bio duet . 
  but reagan is awesome !!, 
   i kinda wish the daily show would do another segment on the guy . 
  they 'd have a field day with this one . 
  they could have glenn and alex accusing each other of being fascists , shouting incoherently about liberty , ultimately realizing they 're not so different and finally falling into each others arms , kissing passionately . 
  every bad fanfic ever . 
  [ eh malo si me krivo procjenio ] ( http://www.politicalcompass.org/facebook/pcgraphpng.php?ec=-6.88&amp;soc=-3.79 ) . 
  that would be one amazing risky move to do , if made in real life . 
  i 'm sorry , but who takes those crooks in hungary seriously ? 
  map is bs , cause rebels control only handful of towns in reality . 
  jesus , what 's with so many players taking ball with their hands ? 
  also from all wars usa fought , it extremely rarely expanded it 's territory since 20th century . 
  in fact last time it expanded it 's territory was in 1945 , but it returned most of the territory back to japan soon after , which did n't belong to china and korea that is . 
  that 's a major distinction , since usa has no interest to expand it 's territory . 
  heck , they still did n't let puerto rico to join the usa despite most people there voted in referendum to be fully part of the usa . 
  heretik !, 
  koju kurac je abeceda demokracije ? 
  `` journalism , me , twitter , sex and so on '', 
  what ? 
   but look how blindly the world followed america into iraq, 
  eeeeh , which one ? 
  cause in second war , un and nato objected to us invasion of iraq . 
  in before american weather machine conspiracy theory did it . 
  why the fuck police ai n't doing anything ? 
  especially the infamous trigger happy us police . 
  they actually have genuine terrorists in the area , but apparently they 're just white enough and right wing enough to get a pass . 
   this may be a controversial opinion , it may not be . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  controversial to who ? 
  oligarchs that want to host major world sport events in their country that ca n't afford it , but they 'll personally will profit a shit ton of money ?

  cnn is too obsessed with malaysian missing plane , fox news only bashes on obama , msnbc is too busy defending obama and corporations , bbc seems to have allergy to report anything from ex-yugoslav republics and russia today works 24/7 on producing kremlin 's propaganda over ukraine crisis . 
  eeeeeeh ... 
  we 're too lazy and too expensive to be cheap labor . 
  yeah , they should have expected you 'd be a lying son of a cow . 
   it continues the long tradition of the liberals social warfare against the poor and middle classes . 
  i do n't think australian liberals know what is liberal ideology actually about . 
  i can get the dinosaur relic , cause dinosaurs are awesome , but come on nutella is in front ?

  nah , it 's totally haarp responsible !,

  no , really , reddit admins created bots making upvotes or downvotes to battle possible bots that downvote or upvote . 
  but , but ... only america is imperialist pig that invades countries for oil !, 
  this only blocks flame wars on twitter . 
  so , good move ? 
  tanks are pretty shitty to be used in urban warfare , so they 're either shipped to border or assist blockade of insurgent control cities . 
  and way , way more satisfying . 
  but batman does n't kill . 
  intentionally anyway . 
  and jaime was already tyrion 's only friend . 
  floods are in my region and my city is under threat of embankment collapsing due to sheer weight of water . 
  i took many pics :,

  only to be replaced by russian oligarch . 
  desperate times demand for desperate measures . 
  you mean like whole 2 of them in entire crisis ? 
  separatists ? 
  a big lot kidnapped or detained for fantasy reasons , along many of them being tortured and some even killed . 
  i think they bought in same store like crimean russians bought their apc 's . 
  that actually sounds menacing . 
  coca-cola *, 
  what exactly is reason behind this , though ? 
  i have n't heard of any law or orders to detain russian reporters on sight . 
  good title choice . 
  australia is too stable for that . 
  and even then it would be tony abbot 's cronies that would do assassinations against his opponents . 
  creationists are one of the first to believe of end of the world myths and of new floods due to gays or something . 
  `` cow '', 
  jesus , this is absurdly high in many places . 
  true enough , but it is slightly uneasy feeling to me they 're not giving any formal statement of their detaining . 
  they 're being treated well , so that 's good . 
  but still , it 's coming out of nowhere and neither military nor government explained their reasons . 
  at least did n't found any report on their reasoning . 
  i have a feeling soldiers that detained this russian propag ... 
  i mean , totally objective journalists happen out of spite by an army that is very annoyed by their blatant prop ... 
  i mean , slightly bias reporting . 
  and higher chain of command and government is embarrassed over that , so now try to make damage control . 
  answer is ... uuuuh , 666 ? 
  eeeeh , both ? 
  wait , really ? 
  still waiting for that promised croatia vs kosovo friendly match . 
  though i would add there should be an american spring . 
  occupy wall street is a total failure , while tea party ca n't be more pro-establishment even if it tried . 
  am i dreaming ? 
  now i hope next movement will take pointers from ukraine 's euromaidan . 
  set goals , proper organization and endurance are a key !,
