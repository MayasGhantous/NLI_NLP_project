  no , greece vs japan was worse . 
  hopefully for you , italy wo n't do 11 men defense against uruguay . 
  the bigger the group is , more idiots it attracts . 
  that made it even worse !, 
  japan had an extra man advantage and it still did jackshit . 
  with exception of colombia and chile , all south american play mediocre at best this world cup . 
  european teams are n't much better either . 
  usa needs to prove that against portugal first . 
  beating ghana is one thing , but beating desperate portugal for points is another . 
  not exactly a well thought out ultimatum . 
  but russia has oil !, 
  why no freedom for russia ? 
  weird , bosnia is n't in medium . 
  while greece is . 
  fuck those referees !, 
  bosnia should have won the damn game !, 
   do n't be so childish , nigeria played well , you should n't be insulting them . 
  i have hard time respecting a team that literary started to lay on the ground to waste time . 
  bunch of cowards . 
  does n't exactly works that way , but i 'm taking it . 
  iran played like shit with it 's bus defense . 
  iran deserved to lose with it 's unfootball strategy . 
  and merkel . 
   hey world , we 're sorry for being the most boring team in the tournament . 
  i 'm sorry , but you 're nowhere near close to japan , greece and , especially , iran . 
  when it comes to boring teams . 
  have fun running a `` country '' without infrastructure !, 
  this is why you should have let me annex you , bosnia !, 
  you 'd be in western europe instead !, 
  but noooo , you wanted your silly independence . 
  but no matter , i will get my clay back . 
  they can remain independent . 
  with entire wall surrounding our border . 
  fifa let 's qatar to host a world cup , which uses slave labor that die in thousands !, 
  fifa is directly responsible for qatar committing crimes against humanity and gives no flying fuck . 
  so i think they 'll have no problem sleeping due to this shitty and very likely corrupt referee . 
  croatia has \u0107evapi !, 
  also only thing fifa has a call on is : is player natural born citizen of a country he 's called to play for , if not natural born then does player has citizenship of playing country for like 5 years ( ? 
  ) , is player of proper age and sanctioning players over their anti-sport behavior . 
  ... is my burger . 
  it has been 16 years since croatia last time got out of world cup group . 
  28 years since we won 3rd game of word cup group stage , as yugoslavia . 
  time to change this !, 
  ** edit *** # 1 * i need a hug . 
  nah there 's a bunch of us here . 
  just many croats on reddit are likely away on public places to watch the game . 
  while there 's far more mexicans on reddit then croats , as well americans that support their fellow concacaf member . 
  as long as you have money to spend , you 'll live . 
  there 's few of us always , but we always show up to impress and win . 
  yes . 
  [ you have a massive amnesia then ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_fifa_world_cup#group_g ) . 
  looks like we will need to wait whole 2 decades to get out of group stage , now . 
  god i hope netherlands gives spanish ex-colony same treatment like it given to spain . 
  and you chile ? 
  you better crush brazil !, 
  yeah . 
  ever since we won 3rd place in 1998 , croatia failed to leave group stage . 
  where the fuck were you 80 minutes ago ?!, 
  it was a typo . 
   terrorists blew up a railway track . 
  me too wants to run a country without a infrastructure !, 
  what 's the starting age of legal idiocy ? 
  hell no , every damn team that plays ultra-defensive should be on the bottom of their group !, 
  i do n't remember croatia annexing back bosnia . 
  i 'm gon na hate you forever !, 
  i hate this week and it only started . 
  i better see croatia vs greece in euro 2016 with croatia kicking greek ass !, 
   ` austria-hungary would have worked out ethnic nationalism on its own ', 
  ha-ha-ha ... 
  ha-ha-ha-ha ... 
  ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ... 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha !, 
  not only should he get major long time if not life-time ban from playing official football matches , he should face criminal charges for an assault !, 
  ** fifa ** : nah , still no need for replay technology . 
  not really , only costa rica deserved to get out of group . 
  all 3 ex-world champs played mediocre at best . 
  well , people all over world love your president and your country 's politics . 
  though , you were always hated in football . 
  why kurdistan ? 
  why not some better name instead ? 
  you 're not a ex-soviet state to pick up `` stan '' in your country name . 
  guy 's a psychopath and a thug . 
  plain and simple . 
  yeah , but i 'd still go with some better name if i had the call on this . 
   if fifa does n't do something drastic , i think there will be a lot of negative press . 
  oh yeah , because bad press totally made fifa reconsider qatar hosting . 
  colombia to kick some ass , confirmed . 
  croatia the best eliminated team !, 
  [ vidi , vidi !, 
  physics do n't work like that . 
  no , continue !, 
  i want for neymar to cry ever since his dive !, 
  i 'm confused . 
  well , shit . 
  my mistake . 
  i did n't said it 's stupid , just boring . 
  well that makes it even more boring . 
  nope . 
  hey op , why does bosnia has italian flag ? 
  also put the d\u017eeko 's goal gif already !,
