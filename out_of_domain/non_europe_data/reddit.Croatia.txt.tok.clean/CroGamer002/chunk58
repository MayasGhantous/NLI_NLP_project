  ja sam ti ina\u0107e hrvat , [ samo sam izgubi okladu ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/28npxu/postmatch_thread_italy_0_1_costa_rica/cicqyn1?context=3 ) . 
  you 're coming home with first ever victory !, 
  shame for that own goal against argentine and for referees robbing you against nigeria . 
  but hey , you should n't go better then croatia . 
  finally argentine decided to wake up . 
  now i can finally see them going far into the finals . 
  and if not for that unlucky own goal either , they 'd have a draw with argentine . 
  croatia has it . 
  only that we have 3-4 old idiots on air instead . 
  come on usa !, 
  you can beat germany !, 
  and damn i wish ghana makes a miracle and demolishes portugal . 
  usa and ghana going to playoffs would be an amazing shocker !, 
  you 're damn lucky croatia underestimated him and did n't invited him to play for our team . 
  for croatia . 
  also , [ reason why i have greece flair ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/28npxu/postmatch_thread_italy_0_1_costa_rica/cicqyn1?context=3 ) . 
  drmi\u0107 did had major interest to play for croatia , however he never received any calls . 
  ehm , why would the british media make that one up of all media ? 
  it just feels like a random pick . 
  i miss it more . 
  3rd place and the golden booth for \u0160uker , never forget . 
  good news !, 
  you wo n't play with him next saturday ! . 
  bad news . 
  well , you wo n't play at all . 
  indeed . 
  it 's not our fault for being financially incapable to keep up with upgrading our lower-end shrines . 
  [ this happened ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/28npxu/postmatch_thread_italy_0_1_costa_rica/cicqyn1?context=3 ) . 
  yeah and if refugees do n't comply they should be put in prisons instead !, 
  cause that 's more fiscally responsible , am i right ? 
  well they did played with a b squad . 
  yet it 's americans who are mocked for loving their warmongering leaders . 
  that 's not how economy works . 
  honestly , it 's a pathetically low punishment for blatant assault that he done before . 
  yeah , fifa 's a joke on it 's punishments . 
  they 're either pathetically weak or ridiculously harsh . 
  to su neki rezultati . 
  those things are destroying us economy . 
  only few some corporations and rich elite profit , but the whole country suffers . 
  yep , you do n't know how economy works . 
  because costa rica beaten 2 ex-champs and eliminated another one . 
  too badass for greece . 
  [ wait , i created exact prediction as a joke last night ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bkzd5au.png ) . 
  nope . 
  [ well i 'm no greek ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/28npxu/postmatch_thread_italy_0_1_costa_rica/cicqyn1?context=3 ) . 
  i think they 're well aware of that . 
  well you got rusty with taxing . 
  fade brazil !, 
  fade brazil !, 
  fade brazil !, 
  yeah , you have to be nearly over 15 centuries old to say such thing . 
  first nishimura allowed this bs to neymar , now howard !, 
  [ gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool !!!,

  come on colombia !, 
  [ i 've made a prediction you 'd go to the finals !, 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  [ brilliant teamwork !!!!,

  more i learn about kurds , more i love kurds . 
  ex-yugoslav republics are also better off apart . 
  true , but they 're doing quite well for a state that lost shit ton of territory in less then 2 decades . 
  somehow i think ukraine would n't be bothered much over that . 
  well , tatars too . 
  fifa would know if it 's a fake . 
  nope !, 
   the habsburg monarchy, 
  yeah , sure . 
  they would totally be capable to do that . 
  holy shit , he does looks a bit black in that picture . 
  [ i 'm testing this right now !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/29aurk/psa_just_to_let_you_know_our_automoderator_will/ ), 
  well that was fast . 
  well i had to test it does it work . 
  i wo n't do it again in future , though . 
  ca n't someone talk to / r/history mods to deal with this poor quality control ? 
  with cercei , it 's justified violence . 
  no way dragon age inquisition would stay 60 dollars . 
  ea tends to drop their price tag real hard in matter of few months . 
  activision in other hand ... 
  best part is , that signed was n't even put up by qatar government nor do they have plans to make such requirment . 
  sign was basically a political protest from minor parts of really radical muslims in qatar . 
  they 're trying to put up those modest clothes laws , but they barely have power in qatar to actually pull it off . 
  partially , yeah . 
  that has got to be the most retarded scored goal in world cup . 
  i ca n't wait to see greek flag faded . 
  fade the flag !, 
  fade the flag !, 
  fade the flag !, 
  that 's gon na make me little sad when colombia beats brazil in quarter finals . 
  til spain ruled parts of croatia . 
  and if they listened to the terms , then it would have been a jackpot for ukraine . 
  i think he moved to costa rica recently . 
  genghis khan is a croat !, 
  algeria will be a true menace in next world cup , that 's for damn sure . 
  he 's been more of a defender then a goalkeeper . 
  now that 's badass . 
  great , it 's on sale when i 'm literary broke for several months . 
  definitely both . 
  russia has no grounds to demand shit from ukraine .
