  lenin is on the same list of people like mussolini and franco who should not have statues of himself to be honored . 
  insurgents are on massive retreat right now , so they might be shooting down on straggles . 
  well , no trip wired flare mine for him to tip off now . 
  good call , the british have one of the best people for such investigation . 
  holy shit , guy not only get 's close to that thing , but also touches it !, 
   in terms of the size of these units as a reference you can use today 's claim from a separatist source that `` 250 serbian fighters have arrived to the front , making them the largest single unit . '', 
  i doubt that happened , otherwise it would have been a huge news in croatia . 
  that one guy with few of his friends in crimea sparked large media attention . 
  entire unit of 250 serbs would be a major headline here . 
  but that brigade was disbanded after a bunch of them defected to rebels and given them 6 apc 's . 
  true , but it still suggests insurgents used that location before for it 's aa weapons . 
  likely they used it again when mh17 was brought down . 
  `` stop kiev aggression '', 
  oh come on , this is just as dumb as saying csa fought against northern aggression . 
  did they used it for reconnaissance ? 
  cause that would make sense . 
  as i doubt ukraine has drones with missiles on them . 
  and let alone some volunteer militia . 
   drone has no family to worry if it gets shot, 
  racist !, 
  talk about a fuck up . 
  except they do not ? 
  but that would mean we would ban 70 % of articles posted here . 
   especially after sochi . 
  and they 're preparing for football world cup 2018 . 
  no way they 'll get rich class to spend on crimea , while that 's being done . 
  that 's one way to shot down someone 's bushiness . 
  hopefully they did n't compromise crash site too much . 
  spainish embassy pretty much said no spanish is working in ukraine air control . 
  man i hope every class in russia turns against putin in close future . 
  so it was a lose-lose scenario ? 
  nothing new , really . 
  what is `` orthodox culture '' ? 
  total embarrassment and disgrace . 
  insurgents could have gained buk and it 's missiles only from 2 places . 
  stealing from ukraine or getting it from russia . 
  meanwhile , ukraine claims all of it 's buk 's are under their control . 
  that has to be some sort of record . 
  nobody ever truly assumed there was a ** direct ** russian involvement in shooting down that plane . 
  indirectly , however , they 're so did it . 
  i meant in actual long term success . 
  and russians know thing or two of creating a violent revolution . 
  eeeeh , us intelligence still holds onto indirect russian involvement . 
  which is what most people and media already assume , as russia trained , supplied and reinforced insurgents in ukraine . 
  russia has without a doubt created situation in which this plane was shot down . 
   hitler and the nazi party are special . 
  they are probably the single most irredeemable group to ever exist . 
  ca n't i nominate serb chetniks to add them on that list ? 
  by communist , you mean russian/chinese fascist imperialists who have no regard for human life while pretending to be something they 're not . 
  it 's goddamn impossible to see what uniform someone wears from a spy satellite . 
  that 's basically csi enchant stupid . 
  nah , you just got ta wait for the old rich people to start organizing armed rebellion . 
  what city ? 
  once luhansk and donetsk fall , there 's only handful of villages and towns left for insurgents . 
  and those places are impossible to defend . 
  while everything else is just empty plains or small hills , not exactly a natural defensive position either . 
  those two cities are their last line of defense . 
  once they fall , they can only surrender or escape to russia . 
   the fact that someone would n't know why a bosnian would n't like a serb is a ** little sad ** . 
  that would be an understatement . 
  glory to russia ? 
   it 's even worse , he does n't think the civil war happened either . 
  no , denying would war 2 existing is way worse . 
  and event that killed over 60 million people and changed entire world to be considered a hoax is the worst . 
  at least he accepts ww2 happened . 
  slow , but steadily and efficiently . 
  hardly a cold war , as russia is nowhere near of being a superpower . 
  wtf ?!, 
  there 's a car in middle of place where bridge collapsed . 
  did insurgents left their car there like morons or they did n't cared for a civilian crossing the bridge ? 
  they 're only considered to as great power due to bloated military budget , nukes and oil . 
  basically , russia committing suicide ? 
   the dpr calling for the nationalization of the property of oligarchy, 
  so that different and even worse kind of oligarchy can take over ? 
  also , it was the invading germans that were surrounded in stalingrad , not russians . 
   and the sbu summarily kicked them out, 
  actually , protestors left those buildings on their own once berkut forces were kicked out of the buildings and insured to not be used as staging area to attack protestors . 
  well to be fair , going bill o'reilly style dumb-asking is always a fail . 
  yep . 
  even if it 's fake , she 's still a horrible human being . 
  if it 's legit , then one more evidence of looting . 
  if fake , then it 's not relevant . 
  israel as well . 
  still too low . 
  do n't realize this `` strong leader '' would most likely go against them in far future if he 's not stopped ? 
  you did good job at running away !, 
  after ww2 , ussr did occupied half of austria . 
  and due to a deal with the allies , they had to have released it austria to unify . 
  instead of having eastern austria as puppet , like eastern germany . 
  now ofcourse , different context due to hitler and all , but it would be a plausible scenario if putin , with eu 's and un 's ineptitude , manages to make russia once again a superpower in far future . 
  ofcourse it 's really unlikely scenario to ever happen , but a lot can change in soon years . 
  it depends a lot on what will nato do and will eu ever grow a spine , as well if not so stable russia does n't fall under another revolution . 
  you mean creating fictional stories that spread mass hysteria and paranoia against ukraine government , what it 's enemy putin 's russia wants to do ? 
   how is he a key suspect ? 
  according to sbu 's released radio transmission , he likely given an order to shoot down that plane . 
  but it does show that those involved in fighting did shitty job on securing the crash site from looters . 
  most likely no , as they have full hands with swtor still . 
  mmo 's are highly demanding . 
  he wants to be surrounded in donetsk , just like germans were in stalingrad . 
  til serbian government is washington 's puppet .
