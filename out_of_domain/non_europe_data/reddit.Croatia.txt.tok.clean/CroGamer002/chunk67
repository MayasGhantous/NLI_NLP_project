  as well there 's still shit ton of independent media still flourishing in usa , while russia is hunting down even small independent journalists . 
  sure , usa is highly flawed , but compared to russia it 's heaven of freedom . 
  libya was french former colony , while saudi 's were british key allies against ottomans so relationship stick for a while , while other arab states were also their former colonies . 
  that 's goddamn impossible . 
  you ca n't hide 4,000 deaths like that and also have this major offensive going on rather well . 
  troops morale would too damn low as they 'd know casualties rates are much higher . 
  i really hope one day his popularity hits rock bottom . 
  he did n't said anything about anyone should die . 
  if they start doing actions , instead of just words . 
  i love what they said , but back up those words with some serious action . 
   when you see those old experienced granny hands , you know the handjob will be amazing !, 
  completely pointless event !, 
  this was truly not needed , maidan . 
   libya was an italian colony . 
  did n't they lose it after ww2 ? 
   so what ? 
  saudi arabia is still an absolute monarchy with limited rights, 
  former colonial ties and alliances are hard to get rid off , especially since you have ussr to worry about . 
  even then , they both abandoned their support later on . 
  it 's been two hours and no report of this tanks anymore . 
  what happened ? 
  ups . 
  ukraine does n't need weapons , it needs training . 
  should have been a strategy since the start . 
  taking border back directly was too ambitious while using only 30k troops in entire operation . 
   stalin did shit like this, 
  yeah , he just shot ordered that soldiers , officers and commanders to be shot on spot and without trial for `` treasonous '' and `` cowardly '' acts . 
  one of those rare moments that insurgents gives us good news before ukraine army does . 
  ** ukraine ** : will you disarm yourselves and surrender , allowing civilians to negotiate for more minority rights , any autonomy and even federalism ? 
  ** dpr ** : no . 
  ** ukraine ** : ceasefire denied . 
  ** putin ** : i wanted to build a that bridge to connect crimea with russian mainland . 
  but china jumped to ship on that deal , so ... 
  here 's this big show !, 
  insurgents kinda lacked both . 
  they just assumed crimea scenario to happen . 
  only that that time ukraine army shot back . 
  so since then , it 's nothing but improvisations , massive support of supplies , weapons and manpower from russia and praying russia will invade . 
  not working out too well . 
  sure , russian invasion is still possible but that would be a giant disaster at this point . 
  who puts tattoos on their fingers ? 
  it would have been a disaster if kharkov people 's republic managed to happen . 
  i hope they keep it . 
  it 's basically a memorial by this point . 
   til that the catholic church during the middle ages were literally reapers, 
  and i think i got a new flair . 
  i hope the succeed with limited casualties of ukraine soldiers and civilians . 
  it 's naive to think there wo n't be casualties . 
  may as well add ex-yugoslav nations that are crossed . 
  with exception of maybe serbia , no ex-yugoslav nation would join in another pan-slavic union ever again . 
  especially not in one in which russia rules . 
  then what did he meant ? 
  and that 's what i also said . 
  why did he repeated it then ? 
  he could have been lot more clear on that . 
   shell damaged the ** penal colony ** building, 
  i had no idea ukraine had a colony . 
  i know , but who says penal colony instead of prison ? 
  why would you give a shit if your hose can be crushed from heavy use of force ? 
  unless you 're a firefighter , there is no situation when that would be your concern . 
  if you want a stable large empire , you kind do need it . 
  ethnic cleansing and iron first rule have limits . 
  so i still call bs . 
   mfw no successful empires are done by conquest, 
  in this time of age , pretty much . 
  empires and conquests are just not worth it anymore , economically and stability wise . 
   mfw no diplomatic change in hundreds of years, 
  you 're underestimating the centuries old national grudges . 
  well i did said maybe . 
  you 're forgetting about russian `` tourists '' . 
  ofcourse i do . 
  or both . 
   `` igor girkin arrived in bosnia with the cossacks as member of the cossack unit . 
  he was 23 years old when he appeared in visegrad . 
  his commander was alexander zagrebov , whose name was also alexander as . 
  his unit committed different war crimes , crimes against humanity , including ethnic cleansing in visegrad , foka , ruda , and in saraj . 
  girkin must be brought to justice for the crimes he committed , along with the people who ordered them . 
  he then fought throughout of bosnia . 
  after the war he left , and now is fighting in ukraine , '' the bosnian researcher said . 
  it was named swastika long before whole nazism thing started , though . 
   you 're right , that 's the reason that britain and france will never be allies, 
  you mean after they found common enemy germany ? 
   it 's why japan is still hated in south korea and us . 
  you mean after long us occupation of japan ? 
  and he should stay in russia . 
  he 's not good at the whole reporting at freaking warzone . 
   obviously , ukraine wants him dead . 
  or , you know , trialed for war crimes and/or get everything out of him on russian involvement over ukraine invasion and mh17 destruction . 
  well that 's dumb of them . 
   - keeping the saudis and israelis happy, 
   - and the middle east stable, 
  pick one . 
  israel can me mad as much as it wants , but it will never risk itself to go to full scale war with it 's neighbors . 
  saudi arabia meanwhile funds terrorism , so them going to war would be an improvement to middle east . 
  cause then they would have to focus to defend their oil ... 
  i mean , their country . 
  and he 's still alive . 
  damn , that 's a total badass . 
  what 's with this agenda 21 scare ? 
  because the glorious bush fought the un !,
