  ukraine army not shelling donetsk is just plain fantasy . 
  however !, 
  residents of donetsk saying that , in the capital of insurgents , is what makes this interesting . 
  considering they 're under occupation of insurgents for months , it does n't add up . 
  for every normal country , aiding an enemy is treason . 
  but the ua army means the ukraine army army . 
  well that just makes it confusing . 
  by kidnapping , you mean ** arresting ** insurgents and collaborators that were left behind . 
  and by shooting at ambulance , you mean shooting at ambulance ** tires ** , as it most likely refused to stop to an order to stop . 
  seriously , any normal police would chase you down if you refuse to stop to their order , no matter the reason for stopping . 
  guy was shooting ** at tires ** instead , cause he does n't have a speedy police car to chase it down . 
  nothing really new from ukraine government . 
  mariupol police was in bed with insurgents , so are untrustworthy and pretty much traitors . 
  military and militia will have to enforce peace and justice instead for a while , until new police force is formed . 
   edit : mito i korupcija ? 
  what 's with arabs and their need to shoot guns at celebrations ? 
  not even trigger happy ultra-pro-gun type of americans do that . 
  ... why ? 
  just , why ? 
  i do n't see fascination in this . 
  8,500 usd is still incredibly cheap for a tank . 
  how big is the market for collectors anyway ? 
  talk about waste of explosives . 
  they are either unable or have nowhere to go . 
  they 're naked . 
   the owner of this website ( crime.in.ua ) has banned your ip address ( -- . -- . -- . -- ) on the country or region you are accessing it from . 
  i mean , how many people are willing and able to buy them ? 
  it is a tank . 
  it 's not a bunch of uniforms and weapons you can just put in your room . 
  so any collector needs to be really rich , as he/she needs big warehouse to keep that tank in good condition . 
  i doubt collectors alone can make that market big enough and sustainable . 
  it 's mostly circumstantial to get collector interested and with money and ability to own a tank as part of collection . 
  so yeah , selling them darn cheap to very poor or just desperate countries is what you 'll depend upon . 
  that and selling it for scrap , i guess . 
  ukraine and dpr government both seem to live in fantasy , when talking about their controlled territory and troops position . 
  or , you know , ukrainians would have seceded like baltic nations and poland did amid russian civil war and after germany pretty much demolished russia in ww1 . 
  lenin would n't even started a civil war without germany smuggling him to russia . 
  and germany was sending every damn radical from left and right to stir up trouble in russia during ww1 , lenin was just the most successful one . 
   it highlights the nonsense that such hardware is acquired on the black market . 
  russia would be in utter panic and chaos if such military hardware is sold on black market . 
  it would be a giant national security breach .

  short summary . 
  croatia made a deal with usa on sending 14 mi 8 mtv and 10 mi 117 sh transport helicopters to ukraine , in exchange for 20 used black hawk transport helicopters . 
  win-win scenario for everyone . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  why is thread tagged as misleading ? 
  well , i guess usa can avoid it 's domestic technicalities by indirectly aiding non-nato country with such military equipment ? 
  also usa was helping out modernization of croatian forces for ages already . 
  they even given us 212 logistics and combat vehicles for free few months ago . 
  used ofcourse . 
  so they were to do similiar thing again anyway , as croatia started to abandon russian made arms even more , but they simply sweeten up the deal to also aid ukraine . 
  my assumption anyway . 
  this are transport helicopters , not gunships . 
  because going through congress first slows down the process . 
  likely also because usa does n't want to lose their made weapons and equipment to russians . 
  it would be a terrible thing if russians lay their hands on those and look through weaknesses or even replicate them for own purposes . 
  going through croatia that mostly uses russian cold war era heavy weapons and equipment ( leftover from yugoslavia and cheaply modernized in ukraine ) , so if it falls in russian hands it wo n't really matter . 
  so there 's that too . 
  croatia was already looking at getting black hawk helicopters , but lacked money to get proper amount . 
  this was a great compromised deal for croatia . 
  we 're ditching really old russian helicopters for , while far from new , very useful american ones . 
  you know what also violates that treaty ? 
  invading and annexing crimea . 
  well ukraine is desperate for helicopters . 
  many of them are already shot down , so they need anything they can get . 
  they just need to use them tactically differently from now on . 
  yeah . 
  usa has a huge stockpile of heavy modern weapons and equipment that is just collecting dust and wasting military budget on maintaining them . 
  better from them to just give them to their allies that they can put to use . 
  in reasonable amount , ofcourse . 
  i hope they keep it . 
  yeah , that way usa get 's more business in selling spare parts , get 's payed for modernization and even sometimes to even for for major repairs that specific country has no enough manpower to do itself . 
  i think most of them know latin alphabet , just prefer cyrillic . 
  i 'd prefer confederation over federation . 
  mislim da se on samo \u0161alio . 
  but nothing yet on is city liberated . 
  which would be a major victory , considering there 's lot 's of insurgents there that have no where to retreat . 
  if it is real , likely just some obscure minority of radicals . 
  but , i 'd laugh hard if siberia decides to secede from russia and actually does it . 
  yay, 
  well , if it ever happens it better happen withing my lifetime . 
  your numbers are rather optimistic in my opinion , but who knows . 
  also i 'm 21 . 
  hardly , russian treaty violation made that treaty seize it 's purpose to exist . 
  it 's kind of a common sense with all treaties . 
  if one of parties violates the treaty , it kinda seizes to exist unless that party backs down from violation . 
  you mean after russian invasion , occupation , local governments coup and completely illegally made referendum with no real credibility ? 
  well that and the weather . 
  true , but you know mother nature . 
  you do n't fuck with her . 
  fun fact . 
  what if he 's not ? 
  what if he merely made himself disappear to avoid an `` accident '' in russia . 
  also part of treaty , which is how russia annex crimea . 
  russian staged junta of local governments in crimea is talked very often , sadly . 
  people seem to not realize none of the people in charge of crimea were elected officials . 
  tinypic sucks !, 
   they are alive because we alow it . 
  since when did we become reapers ?
