  most islamists and islamist terrorist groups hate isis and what they stand for . 
  damn al-qaeda thinks they 're too extreme . 
  i 'm gon na go and defend on mars . 
  because isis does n't stand for even most of islamist terrorist organization ? 
  seriously , those fuckers think this fuckers are too extreme . 
  and all islamists do n't stand for most muslims . 
  well they do use different calendar . 
  what does multiculturalism has to do with this ? 
  also they are 3rd world country . 
  north korea is far more threatening them them . 
  germany always takes an extreme of their current position . 
  19 years ago . 
  perhaps they could strike a deal with iraq government , by iraq accepting their independence referendum in exchange of kurds directly assisting them to liberate isis occupied iraq . 
   ended the european infighting that had gone on for ** hundreds of years ** . 
  there has n't even been a century since ww2 ended . 
  also , there have been a bunch of wars in europe since ww2 . 
  while all just regional wars with no danger of any global power intervening , wars were still fought in europe . 
  i say , start / r/independentsiberia and move discussion there . 
   the ukrainian general staff seem stuck in an old soviet-esque mindset of the very expendible soldier . 
  quite large formations are sacrificed `` for the greater good '' and left without support or proper orders . 
  this way of conducting business `` works '' when you have a significant numerical advantage and the ability to severely sanction soldiers that are unhappy with this approach . 
  while this `` problem '' is unlikely to totally derail the `` ato '' , the generals may want to take an extended vacation when this conflict is over . 
  there will be a lot of bitter soldiers . 
  which is why nato really needs to train ukraine army . 
  they 're tactically obsolete and need to get modernized before actually modernizing their arms . 
  i like how there 's no such thing as civilian justice system for them . 
  i do hope they 'll manage to somehow block insurgents from coming back and even from just passing by . 
  cause that would be a major blow to dpr . 
  it pretty much looks like a trench . 
  well then it 's a foxhole . 
  but basically it was still used for dug in fortified position for insurgents to use for defense . 
  like trenches , just for few people . 
  this link is about as credible as my reddit posts . 
  but sadly , nothing is done properly to oppose putin 's russia . 
  it would be like creating nazi theme park and hire communist jew as a tour guide . 
  it 's not gon na work out well . 
  that 's because you ca n't trial nor give sentence to a dead man . 
  his nose and lips do n't match up . 
  neither does chin , but hard to tell from that angle . 
  this does make me think this picture was taken in iraq or syria , not in ukraine . 
  well , that 's bad . 
  yet , ukraine army is still pressing an advantage so that proves that wrong . 
   could serbia become the next ukraine ? 
  mostly small late cold war firearms , though . 
  one does not simply burn down flag of ukraine . 
   the vice, 
  they have game reviews ? 
  however , isis/isil is universally the most hated group . 
  even the extremists hate them , especially the rich extremist that found those other extremist groups . 
  even if they were to properly reorganize and keep their state , no way they 'll be able to do anything serious outside their state and neighboring states . 
  they just lack any foreign support . 
  hopefully we can do the impossible and get euro trophy , with him scoring winning goal . 
  but alas , dreams only . 
  we need to get through france and germany for that . 
  and women . 
  and children . 
  and second one going down is definitely not their fault . 
  yes . 
  fear merkel !, 
  feels like creator of that map got drunk , when he/she needed to draw borders for croatia . 
   somalia is in deep shit . 
  that 's news to people ? 
  i learned that hard from it 's little southern brother . 
  perhaps there should be some trade . 
  you 're welcome . 
  yes , but they want to convert croatia not remove croatia like alleged kebab it is . 
  yeah , but us invasion of iraq and giant mismanagement and naivety in forming new iraq democratic government caused for isis to grow this big . 
  this issue ca n't be solved with us leading yet another military campaign , but by kurds and iraqis with only limited direct us support . 
  that 's true . 
  and while i was aware somalia was in deep shit , i never took time to research on why it is until you linked that article . 
  damn , what a mess . 
  then he dies and people start killing each other . 
  well kurds and iraqis are making great gains , once the us air-force kicked in to help them out . 
  so that limited direct support from the us is good enough , especially since isis has no real aa defenses to defend against advanced us military jets . 
  but time will tell will that be enough . 
  cause if not , then we 're in the shitter . 
  isis is n't supported by saudis , though . 
  they managed to be too extreme for them as well . 
  i honestly never heard of avignon . 
  what 's going on ? 
  support that they 're regretting now and had cut it off . 
  i kinda blobbed as france and did n't give a shit for anyone but austria-england-prussia alliance that kinda hated me hard . 
   secret police, 
  tla did that much better . 
  still the most creepiest episodes in entire franchise . 
  well it 's true . 
  if 9/11 did n't increased islamophobia worldwide , it would have been completely irrelevant event for indonesians . 
  ** edit *** # 1 * holy shit , i just caused lot 's of deleted comments . 
   fuck him . 
  that would be necrophilia now . 
  she 's not a catholic , so she has no right to wage crusades !, 
  that 's our thing !, 
  you missed his point . 
  first france , then germany , then russia and looks like again russia . 
  you mean after russia invaded ukraine ? 
  also crimea is in way bigger shithole then ukraine is . 
  and how does that ties to irrational hate and fear of islam and every average joe muslim ? 
  yes . 
  putin caused the civil war . 
  this insurgents would never get this far , if it were n't for russia taking over crimea so easily and supplying insurgents .
