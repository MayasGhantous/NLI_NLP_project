  there 's a fast food franchise with that name . 
  ~ ~ she and some other 4 guys are primary figures of this scandal . ~ ~, 
  wait , i rechecked . 
  she slept with 5 guys for free advertisement and great reviews . 
  3 are confirmed that did it , 2 are still disputed . 
  i only know of 3 direct responses to me , which were blatantly islamophobic . 
  i did n't even bothered to check for rest of conversation , until later tonight . 
  just imagine the shitstom if croatia pulled same thing mocked serbia on their independence day with similiar posters . 
  someone should update wikipedia on that . 
  allowing hitler to take over czechoslovakia was a disaster for the western powers . 
  if they went to war with him right then , there would n't be a ww2 but just one big regional war . 
  \u0106ro ? 
  genocidal mass murdering warmongering religious zealous terrorists that killed 10s of thousands of people  video gamers angered by gaming media corruption that quinn exploited, 
  seems legit . 
  eu is unwilling to tackle the bear , not unable . 
  they should have at least change the colors . 
  this guy is trying to get himself killed . 
   just russia abusing international law and commitments . 
  by abusing , you mean ignoring and blatantly violating them . 
  it 's not working , it 's just that the western powers are merely unwilling to do anything about it . 
  their leaders and commanders are criminals for ordering them to go there . 
  well it took nearly a year to see a very first nazi flag by ukraine forces . 
  for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity ? 
  definitely not . 
  for doing convert military operation that is violating international laws ? 
  following order is a valid excuse . 
   history does n't follow `` legalities '' . 
  turkey called , they want crimea back . 
  mongolia called , they want siberia back . 
  it get 's sillier longer you go . 
  that 's australia . 
  oh , i thought that 's how they called the natives of australia . 
  but is nato denying it 's arming ? 
  some nato countries might supply their old soviet weapons to ukraine dirt cheap , while the us will send their trainers to modernize ukrainian troops tactics and strategies . 
  those things would give major advantage to ukraine , but only in long term . 
  basically , ukraine is gon na be stuck in similiar scenario that croatia was in with serb insurgents back in 1990 's . 
  unless putin goes truly nuts and invades ukraine . 
  to make it confusing to everyone ? 
  she must have learned that from those black americans who 'd rather kill themselves then go to jail for a night , while handcuffed from back and in police car . 
  it saves money on paper and ink . 
   especially in odessa and kharkiv . 
  ukrainians outnumber russians there . 
  any armed insurgents there would be doomed to failure , even if you assume all russians would side with insurgents . 
   navi pillay , whose term is ending , suggests vetos and impasses between members have cost ` hundreds of thousands of lives ', 
  and she 's damn right . 
  russia and usa are equally guilty on abusing their unsc veto right for their state interests , which only caused hundreds of thousands innocents getting killed worldwide . 
  . . yet . 
   bigotry - high . 
  compared with norway ? 
  absolutely . 
  compared with , let 's say , france ? 
  not really . 
  oh so that 's from where slovenia got their idea from . 
  you know , the good old convectional invasion . 
   they had a legit vote, 
   still , i do think there is a risk of similar , ** he could just keep creating enemies and expanding his conflicts ** so that russians unite against the common enemy and ignore their internal economic struggles . 
  i 'm gon na laugh hard if putin creates china as russia 's enemy . 
  that was done by militias , not professional army . 
  page not found, 
  lawl, 
   externally by russia, 
  russia has no power in that decision . 
  there were many pro-separatism protest going on all over eastern and southern ukraine , earlier this year . 
  and us ... 
  wait , that was 11 years ago . 
  never mind me . 
  and to think only few months ago , they were under insurgent control . 
   threatening to cut of gas supply to europe, 
  ** russia ** : if ukraine joins nato , we will commit suicide !, 
  that was n't an invasion . 
  merkel , the 21st century chamberlain . 
   it has been the case since germany was founded in 1871 that when germany has good relations with the other most biggest population and biggest country in europe - russia , then europe as a whole advances . 
  that does n't explain ww1 and ww2 . 
  i always said luxemburg was crazy !, 
  liveuamap is much better from rebel map and official ato map . 
  and liveuamap is still shit , it just speak the quality of what those two maps have . 
  it would be a disaster for insurgents to siege heavily defended mariupol that can easily be supplied by sea . 
  meanwhile , ukraine would be able to attack them with full force from behind the siege . 
  seriously , further the insurgents are from the border , the less direct support they can get from the russians , so that any lousy pretense can exist of them not being involved . 
  and i doubt russia would be ~ ~ crazy ~ ~ stupid enough to send in their navy to blockade maripoul by sea . 
  cause such act ca n't be covered up as insurgents have own navy out of nowhere . 
  such move would make russia officially involved in conflict and forced to abstain from any unsc decisions . 
   small villages and large cities surrounded by the ukrainian army which is directly hitting residential areas with the aim of destroying the infrastructure ... 
  it sadly reminds me of the events of the second world war , when german fascist ... occupiers surrounded our cities . '', 
  why the fuck would ukraine destroy it 's fucking infrastructure on purpose ?!, 
  also there 's ton of video evidence of insurgents destroyed the infrastructure to slow down ukraine army advances , so putin completely off the rails . 
  us surveys are useless , as most people do n't take them seriously and make up stupid guesses on purposes to be funny . 
  that does n't explain anything . 
  one that get 's invades is not one that declares a war . 
  also , ukraine wo n't make any war state emergency before the elections . 
  cause it otherwise suspends elections they desperately want . 
  though if the plane refuses to do so , then shoot ? 
  thread should be renamed into `` insurgents commit another war crime by publicly humiliating their pow 's once more '' . 
  i think it 's because ukraine army nor government do n't have any reason to publicly show their pow 's . 
  but that would be hugely drastic and painful to european nations , without quick replacement . 
   1 ) assassination, 
  of putin ? 
  that would surely create collapse of russia , considering how it was build around his persona . 
  problem is that then china , india and number of other regional powers can go free for all , if the western powers decide to stop following agreed upon world rules . 
  that was the case in earlier years of putin rule .
