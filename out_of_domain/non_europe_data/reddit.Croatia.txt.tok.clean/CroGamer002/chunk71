  but since then , he was building up state to be all about him . 
  russia export oil to china too cheaply and south american countries are too far from them to have survivable profit out of them . 
  and south american countries are hardly russian friends , so they 'd most likely exploit the hell out of russia for food export , just like china did few months ago for russian gas import . 
  so no , russia would only get exploited by this situation . 
  european nations instead can easily find replacement of energy import from the usa and , if it goes well , iran too.it 's gon na take a while to build infrastructure for that , but would n't be hard . 
  also , european nations have enough food for themselves and those who do not can easily import in south american food . 
  so why bother mentioning that ? 
  come on , kamikaze attacks worked well for japan . 
  because they were full chamberlain then . 
  500 million is too little for what damage there already is already . 
  it works now . 
  5 minutes ago it did n't work for me . 
  yeah . 
  allegedly it got overloaded . 
  why would they do that ? 
  ukraine will need billions . 
  other countries combined will only be able to give the fraction of it . 
  well that 's overly too paranoid . 
  unota\u0107 so sam je \u010distio , nije se popravilo . 
  kod cinestara u plodini . 
  ms flipper wired gaming keyboard . 
  lmao, 
  that 's why !, 
  oh yeah , china must be having a field day for past several months . 
  that makes no sense . 
   since it was them and ** not serbia ** fighting in the bosnian war, 
  o.o ;, 
  who the hell is yanukowitch ? 
  maybe not desired it , but sure as hell caused by just winning the cold war . 
  yeah , who 's that guy ? 
  sounds similiar to yanukovych , i have to say . 
   if so , this would be the first time russia has used its jets against ukraine . 
  first time it ca n't be denied russia used jets . 
  ukraine government claims some of their shot down jets were shot down by russian airforce . 
  there were even mass rapes in belgrade after soviets liberated it . 
  fucking belgrade , on serbs . 
  whatever happen to serbs and russians being brothers ? 
  i think it 's more of a anti-merkel sentiment . 
   they can be pretty critical of big budget games . 
  as long as it 's not call of duty or bioware 's game . 
  i do n't see it . 
  \u0160to demokracija ima s time ? 
  around 11-17 millions of people were killed in holocaust , over 60 million in entire ww2 ( including far east asian and pacific fronts which germany took no part off ) . 
  yet they refuse to send any lethal aid to ukraine . 
  thanks ~ ~ chamberlain ~ ~ merkel . 
  or turkey could give to kurds a right to hold referendum for indepedence . 
  what 's he doing wrong ? 
  i got the impression obama is acting almost perfectly in this conflict by directly aiding iraqis and kurds with air support and without sending boots on ground . 
  kako to ti ima\u0161 flair ? 
   i mean cod : bo2 had a better story and i hate that story . 
  why ? 
  [ gon na link this over here ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/15i3nihgjtp_9snxhacypjqvsc3tmqvebx4_nggtknxc/edit ) . 
   slavery would likely still exist there as well . 
  unlikely . 
  csa would have abolished slavery few generations later as they would finally realize backwater slavery is inferior to industrialism and capitalism or be pressured by western powers to end slavery or suffer worldwide embargo . 
  or usa would have annex back csa , eventually . 
  drone strikes anyone ? 
   you do realize that the top photo is from lugansk, 
  around ukraine soldiers ? 
   and the second photo is from the first anti kiev protests months ago right, 
  then why do they wave ukraine flag ? 
  ** china ** : oh goodies !, 
  russia is killing itself and the western world is spineless !, 
   there 's much more to the world than europe , north america and japan you know . 
  yeah , cause cuba and venezuela are such valuable friends to russia . 
  china will never ally with russia . 
  they were n't allies during the cold war , they sure as hell wo n't be allies now . 
  now nothing surprises me . 
  not sure about them wanting to land grab siberia , but they sure as hell wo n't mind for russia to be gone from the world stage . 
  no , china never supported russian annexation of crimea nor russian intervention in ukraine . 
  also china 's economy depends too much on exporting it 's cheap shit to the western world . 
  they wo n't do anything that would hurt their trade , until they get their domestic economy to get it 's act together . 
  jel ' ti to ismijava\u0161 moj thread ? 
   serbo-croatian, 
  * grabs a knife *, 
  what 's the magic word ? 
  fine !, 
  * puts a knife down *, 
  yeah , china sees no gain in taking a side . 
  * grumbles and puts down the rest *, 
  ** russia ** : `` instead of nuking , we will nuke you ! '', 
   demilitarized border zone, 
  hahahahahahahahahahahahaha !!!, 
  russia would never respect that agreement . 
  it would agree to it but then violate it soon after . 
  downvoted for stupid title . 
   i think mr.motorola overreacted and possibly did n't know the reason . 
  i got the feeling he knew . 
  because i dropped them ? 
  samo na invidualce i na neke kompanije , al ' oko krima . 
  thank god they managed to escape . 
  what a fucking mess that putin has caused . 
  nemam problem s time . 
  and putin pretty much shot himself on the foot . 
  if he get 's novorossiya , then he 'll have to fix all the war damage done in donetsk and luhansk . 
  which would doom russian economy . 
  if he does n't fix it , he 'll gain major outrage in entire russia . 
  other option is to just give up on donetsk and luhansk , but that would only mean he wasted everyone 's time , money and lives on this disaster . 
  sure he 'll pretty much destroy ukraine economy with that , but he 'll also get major unrest in russia for this failure . 
  not even frozen conflict will be a good idea , as he 'd still need to fix destroyed infrastructure in donetsk and luhansk .
