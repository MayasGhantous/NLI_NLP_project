  but i could see that scenario to happen way more likely , then mad option . 
  hold on , did you meant in a way of nato forces being permenatly stations in ukraine with bases , right ? 
  donetsk and luhansk can still be liberated through military means , but crimea is whole different story however . 
  neat , croatia is 14th . 
  hopefully friendly match with argentine and qualification match with italy will bounce croatia back to top 10 . 
   japan can attempt to grab the northern teritory islands back from russai . 
  japan is an us ally , despite not being part of nato . 
  so that 's possible . 
   china can make a dash for taiwan . 
  yeah , no . 
  china would n't be stupid to go for taiwan just because usa is busy with russia . 
  heck , us pacific fleet would barely do anything as russian defenses in far east would quickly collapse under us and japan forces . 
   north korea might try to take south korea . 
  which would only result in quick destruction of the north , as their only true threat is to bombard seoul for long while before usa takes out all artillery positions at the border . 
  and for that attack , china would seize to support north ever again . 
   argentina might go for the falklands . 
  argentine would n't be stupid to try that again , until not properly ready . 
   iran might try a shia uprising in bharain . 
  or they 'd try to negotiate end western sanctions to join forces against russia . 
   azerbaijan wiil try to reconquer the armenian enclave within its territory . 
  why would that be relevant ? 
   ethiopia will try to force open a route to the red sea . 
  how 's that relevant too ? 
   serbia will try to take back kosovo . 
  no , kosovo is forever lost for serbia . 
  especially since they want to join eu . 
  and radicals in serbia hardly have any power . 
  eeeeeh , china is importing pretty much every coal that australia mines out . 
  may the best happen after this elections for ukraine . 
   `` honestly , the csto is something of a mess , '', 
  that would be an understatement of the day . 
  no chance in hell he 'll walk away . 
  they need time for proper training and replenish lost heavy weapons and equipment . 
  better than expected , after recent events . 
   i hope the cyborgs survive this , best of luck to the ua !, 
  i hope they survive and win and give a giant beating to the aggressors . 
  it would be hilarious if he wins one seat . 
  title of article was change to `` alleged russian intelligence agent caught outside kyiv claiming to be fsb general '' . 
  sramota . 
  they 're hardly surrounded , as they keep getting supplies , reinforcements and keep having rotations . 
  not a good standard . 
  and beck is mainly saying more reasonable things to remain relevant . 
  now if someone would be patient and creative enough to edit out everything in article . 
  thing is that most of bad policies obama has caused are policies republicans love . 
  he looks more annoyed and bored then that he suffers from insomnia . 
   meanwhile , extremist parties of both the far-right and far-left look unlikely to enter the new parliament , which is set to be the first without communist party representation since the fall of the soviet union . 
  brilliant !, 
  svoboda party seems to have around 6 % of vote , which passes 5 % limit to be elected . 
  so they 'll stay , but with almost half of loss of seats they had . 
  however , radical party looks like it will get elected with major rise rise . 
  as in , they 'll have more then 1 seat now . 
  while fatherland party , while it 's center-left , a populist party is gon na get some seats too but behind svoboda party . 
  so it 's not gon na get rid of radicals and populists , but they 'll be highly limited . 
  however , ukraine parliament will most likely still have fistfights . 
  but this is all exit polls , actual votes will be shown soon . 
  yeah , an absolute overhaul of party seats . 
  only pro-russian party in this is opposition bloc and they do n't even have 10 % . 
  the only percentage i found today is that voter turnout was 40 % at 4 pm , 4 hours before closing . 
  gon na try to find an article that mentions that . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  [ alright , found this . 
  ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/10/24/ukraine-parliamentary-elections-follow-the-crunch-vote-live-on-euronews/ ) though this one just says it 's over 40 % , so ca n't find one that said it was at 4 pm that it reached 40 % . 
  likely edited out , i guess . 
  [ yeah , even hitler had decency to say 99.71 % voter turnout . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_anschluss_referendum,_1938 ), 
  [ found it in liveuamap ] ( http://liveuamap.com/en/2014/26-october-turnout-map-by-regions?ll=50.43869999999999;30.528260000000003&amp;zoom=8 ) . 
  it 's sadly a typical voter turnout in countries with apathetic voters . 
  ~ ~ was n't in last us presidential elections voter turnout was 51 % ? ~ ~, 
  never mind , it was 58 % . 
  ukrainians did n't beat americans voter turnout . 
  a on je isti ko i ja siromak . '', 
  now if only radical party also drops out and self help party get 's above 15 % . 
  i am surprised people 's front is currently in minor lead over poroshenko bloc . 
  though yatseniuk as ukraine pm can only be a good thing . 
  sramota . 
  and `` barbarians '' commonly had semi-decent crafted weapons and armor , for that time . 
  they definitely were n't dressed as cave people either . 
   why do the gauls or whatever barbarians, 
  just to point out , `` barbarian '' tribes in this game are some weird mesh of celtic and germanic tribes wearing cave people clothing . 
  gaulic tribes by the time this game is set are fully rominised , as in basically they were culturally romans . 
  well i 'm shocked poroshenko bloc went behind people 's front , even with small margin . 
  though do n't get it over your head . 
  well , i 'm just saying . 
  why would a nazi dissent agai ... oooooh , i see what you did there . 
  argentine was n't proto-fascist lead when that referendum took place . 
   in many respects , putin has only himself to blame for the ukraine vote : his anschluss of crimea and aggression in the southeast helped unite ukrainians as never before . 
  ooooh that irony . 
  yeah . 
  english ai n't native to me , so i often butcher grammar . 
  did n't ea back out from data mining with origin , ever since it nearly reached to be put on court in germany over privacy laws ? 
  origin sells several non-ea developed games like [ the witcher ] ( https://www.origin.com/en-ie/store/buy/witcher-2/pc-download/base-game/enhanced-edition ) . 
  i forgot i blocked destructoid . 
  or because jesus and miracles . 
  oh wow , this ca n't be real . 
  thank you . 
  what / u/lbdragon said . 
   which raises the suspicion that isis ' `` advanced antiaircraft missile systems '' are n't advanced enough for us helicopters . 
  or they do n't know how to use that advanced aa missile system . 
  ok , seriously , i 'm getting fed up with this ships . 
  are they going to russia or not ?
