  those temples were build over a millennia ago on foundations of roman pagan temples made centuries before . 
  while numerous holy artifacts have only value to the catholic church and some mega-rich art collectors . 
  rest of the wealth is spend on building churches , schools and hospitals worldwide , as well a lot is donated as charity to many poor and weak people all over the world . 
  that 's still not tiny . 
  it would be like to say germany is tiny for having a quarter of us population . 
  hmh , was n't he an iranian refugee ? 
  jokes on you . 
   its important to remember that the call to pull the interview was made by the japanese head of the parent sony company , not the american-run sony pictures entertainment . 
   japan is currently trying to broker the release of a number of japanese prisoners held by north korea . 
  but japan government did not ask nor pressure sony to do that . 
  sony acted upon this on it 's own and there 's nothing to suggest they did it due to prisoners situation . 
  from sony , not japanese government . 
  but why did he mention the prisoner situation between nk with sk and japan ? 
  why would sony cancel the movie over that , without japanese government request ? 
  it 's just a baseless claim at this point . 
  and only reason they went for finland too is because nazi germany sold finland ( and baltic 's ) to ussr for western half of poland and non-aggression pack so germany can focus military offensive freely on western europe . 
  ukraine did n't violate crimean autonomy , let along illegally . 
  nor tried ethnic removal for ruskies . 
  try again russia . 
  if you were to believe far right conspiracy theorists who hate commies from istria . 
  well nothing suggests they did , so it 's still a baseless claim . 
  stalin never seriously thought there would be war with nazi germany . 
  you mean property catholic church had build it 's churches , schools and hospitals for past millennia ? 
  just would like to elaborate , there is no serious separatist movement in istria . 
  the most there is about it is some italian minorities wanting autonomy , but they already have lot 's of benefits ( allowed to name their towns and villages on italian , have schools in italian language and etc. ), 
  so even that lacks serious support among italian minority . 
  meanwhile far right conspiracy theories hugely exaggerate that county wants to secede , primary since their regional party is very progressive and liberal while always get 's enough votes to get one or few seats in parliament . 
  so trough that they , i presume , want to ban that party over separatism claims . 
  i doubt stalin read mein kampf or he thought it is what hitler truly believed . 
   kurdish forces kill dozens of european, 
  * get 's a shocked look on my face *, 
   , african ** isis fighters **, 
  phew . 
   ** as the west attempting regime change ** ala libya , ** ukraine ** , etc, 
  i 'd buy that . 
  bosnia was still part of yugoslavia during that time and after it 's independence , serbs in bosnia rebelled as well that given land connection to krajina to serbia . 
  yugoslav wars are far from simple to understand , that 's for sure . 
  what did they expect from illegally seceding from ukraine , free stuff ? 
  true enough . 
  not really , lukashenko loosen up his authority in past few years . 
  well congress is us parliament . 
  the best kind of janitors . 
  nah , payday 2 stealth heist went wrong . 
  do n't worry , usa will do the right thing once they try every other alternative . 
  you assume daesh is opposite of stupid . 
  i think most italians would welcome that change of government . 
  i doubt there 's a real threat from him to be assassinated by someone from the vatican , at this age of time . 
  depends on which sect of satanists . 
  oh wow , only now i noticed that spelling . 
   the next day , trains loaded with workers originating from factories in the south arrived . 
  the regime was attempting to use them to repress the mass protests , but after a brief encounter they ended up joining the protests . 
  one worker explained : `` yesterday , our factory boss and a party official rounded us up in the yard , handed us wooden clubs and told us that hungarians and ` hooligans ' were devastating timi\u0219oara and that it is our duty to go there and help crush the riots . 
  but i realized that was n't the truth . '', 
  this is my favorite part . 
  but soon we will get our clay . 
  * watches carefully bosnia kebab from behind *, 
  they have weapons to waste , instead they lack properly trained people to use them . 
  like i said many months ago , china is having a field day over this crisis . 
  blue part went too far west . 
  this is an old article , but i come across it only today and do n't remember it being posted . 
  it shows a lot of good insight of what ukraine can learn from croatia , not just from operation storm , but also from croatia 's massive 4 years reforms on creating new post-cold war modern army despite major handicaps in territorial losses and major economical troubles . 
  true , there some major differences over this war . 
  but point is n't to copy/paste what croatia did , but to learn from croatian situation and for ukraine to adapt it to own situation . 
  ukraine definitely has disadvantages over what croatia went through ( separatists sharing border with russia , russia has no other disaster war like serbia in bosnia , economy is still way better situation then serbia was in and etc. 
  ) , but also has advantages ( no need to build an entire army from scratch , no un weapons embargo , nato and eu support from start , has own successful firearm and heavy weapons industry , can potentially mobilize way more people and etc. 
  there was no need to match jna , what it was needed to have big enough army with proper modern training and discipline supported proper equipment and heavy weapons support . 
  which was done by around late 1994 and early 1995 , with help of nato which contributed in training , reconnaissance and air support . 
  since jna was heavily demoralized and suffered major losses by 1995 ( as well even since 1991 milo\u0161evi\u0107 failed to mobilize majority of serbian reserves to recover losses ) through failed campaign in bosnia , croatian army was more then good enough shape to smash insurgents in krajina . 
  putin , in this situation , ca n't afford to blatantly invade ukraine to save insurgents from storm like military operation . 
  both economically and on domestic support . 
  overwhelming majority of russians in russia object to any military presence in ukraine , even less so to invade ukraine . 
  so even in this case , ukraine has no need to match russian military might . 
  it only needs to eliminate insurgents as quickly as possible to not allow russia to intervene in time through proxies . 
  wait , is n't that what they want ? 
  indeed , there were even two attempts by croatia to liberate vukovar from siege . 
  both of which failed catastrophically and vukovar eventually fallen . 
   on a linguistic note , is n't `` serbska '' the wrong use of the word ? 
  either write it serbian or srpska . 
  yeah , which is why i corrected it in my thread title . 
  very silly error . 
  ukraine offensive was very slow compared to operation storm , which bought a lot of time for russia to support rebels through proxies and unofficial military aid . 
  however if ukraine were to go full blitzkrieg and do it correctly like croatia in 1995 , russia would just not be able to respond quickly enough without blatantly invading . 
  and time is not on putin 's side , as longer the sanctions stay the worse russian economy is in , which makes russia much weaker and rebels even more so . 
  while longer poroshenko waits , longer ukraine army is properly trained and disciplined in big numbers . 
  though obviously , poroshenko ca n't wait for too long as ukraine economy is on life support just like russia , just has advantage in eu , us and japan economic aid , no sanctions on it and new government willing to do real economic and anti-corruption reforms . 
  but true , it 's still a major gamble for ukraine to pull it 's own operation storm . 
  putin is unpredictable and has shown he has no interest for russian people well being . 
  i love that scene in the movie , but too be a party pooper it 's historically inaccurate . 
  only reason it was also added in movie , it 's because irish and scottish extras refused to fight each other during making of movie . 
  how dare they leave glorious ussr and later join facist junta nato !, 
  i did said it 's old article . 
   operation storm resulted in ethnic cleansing, 
  absolutely it did not . 
  ** ukraine ** : if we ca n't have donbass , then nobody can !, 
  also i love how croatia is mostly intact . 
  suck it italy !,

   what are the rules regarding intra-nato conflict ? 
  everyone else sits back ? 
  you mean conflicts between nato members ?
