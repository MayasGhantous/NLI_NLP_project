  cause greece and turkey had a few wars , despite both being part of nato .

  what would they be doing there with mobile aa missiles ? 
  pro-russian forces do n't even have helicopters to use , let alone jets . 
  and also you have to note majority of resolutions against those countries would be get veto by one of unsc members . 
  so much free shit posted makes me envious . 
  hahahahahahahahaha .

  for this to happen , ukrainian jet had to have had start to fly from black sea ( last time i checked ukraine has no aircraft carriers ) or russia , then fly through pro-russian territory ( where they had already shot down several ukrainian jets before this ) to make a very perfect shot on very perfect time while mh17 stays perfectly on it 's flight path and then go back to it 's airbase without fuel running out . 
  it never left . 
  even with that , they still depend a lot on pro-russian forces not shooting down ukrainian jet for some reason , as no matter what ukrainian jet has to go through pro-russian controlled territory covered with many aa system 's . 
   there 's 50 states . 
  apparently the user ca n't do simple math , like count the stars on the us flag .

  heights impossible for ukrainian jets to reach , so they would have gotten shot down before ever getting close to mh17 .

  sculpture/painting of a child being carried by it 's mother looks very similiar to other sculpture/painting about a child being carried by it 's mother ?!, 
  it must be an art theft !, 
  nobody wrote anything about alexander the great for few centuries . 
  nobody disputes his existence either . 
  how 's it without substance ? 
  according to just one ss guy . 
  in general germans were way more brutal , just modernized their brutality techniques . 
  their volcano canceled many flights few years ago . 
  a giant war crime . 
  how do n't pro-russians do n't find this disgusting ? 
  this guys fight and die for , apparently , a just cause . 
  yet when they get burred , nobody is paying them a final respect . 
  not even something modest . 
  they just get burred like business as usual . 
   jewish bankers were seen as the most oppressive and privileged people in germany , and this is why they became a target, 
  or , you know , because jews were prosecuted ethnicity and religion in europe since medieval times while used as scape goats for any bad thing happening . 
  and because christians were forbidden to loan money with interest , so jews were the only legal bankers for many centuries and people , just like today , hated bankers caused they owed money to them . 
  as well many christians blamed ( and many still do today ) jews for murdering jesus , even though romans did that . 
  i think this is why jews were prosecuted by the fucking nazis , not because of some sort of privileges . 
  oh and in case you did n't know , jews were the biggest supporters of socialist movement in germany !, 
  and hitler manged to mass arrest german socialist and communist political party members before he was even able to oppress the jews !, 
  in other words , what nonsense did you just spew in that one sentence ? 
  it is n't . 
  some people here are just plain ignorant about history and dismiss historical facts because it goes against their ideology . 
  i do wish for / r/kotakuinaction to not allow this to be a trend , just because poster is opposing sjw 's and automatically trust him . 
  it 's still part of bad history , as nazi party actions were totally misrepresented in historical context as well . 
  especially since nazi party was hugely anti-socialist and anti-communist . 
  so post in question just dismisses the historical fact of socialists and communists being highly prosecuted by the nazi regime . 
  so yes , it does n't break that subreddit rule and post in kia was very historically inaccurate to brand nazi party as left wing . 
  it 's because many users from those subreddits are also subcribers of / r/badhistory . 
  i 've been on / r/badhistory for over year and a half and i recognize many of these posters , as they 're very frequent there . 
  so ofcourse they 'll post comments there and get upvoted . 
   rule 2a : badhistory comparing ** current political figures or events ** to the past are not allowed . 
   ** current political figures or events ** to the past are not allowed . 
  nazi party is not a current existing political party . 
  this rule is there to not allow any discussion about policies and political party activity from today and past 20 years . 
  for example , topics about republican party and it 's today racist and anti-imigration policies being compared to jim crow 's laws are not allowed . 
  meanwhile talking about republican party `` southern strategy '' in late 1960 's to explain why they went from socially liberal to socially conservative is allowed , as it 's talking about political shift from 20 + years ago ( rule for historians when events are considered historic ) in historical context , not out of pushing personal political ideology in discussion . 
  but the post in / r/badhistory was not talking about it , but only debunked the notion nazi party was left wing . 
  it completely ignored sjw comparison in debunking itself , only mentioned to provide context . 
  the poster in badhistory is not allowed to bring today 's politics , but linked post getting debunked is not prohibited as long as you only tackle historical inaccuracies . 
  understand what i mean now , or am i over-complicating it ? 
  sorry for any bad grammar due to english not being my native language . 
  meanwhile in 1 month and half , i 'll have 6 years badge . 
  goddamn it , i 'm 4 years off . 
  i subbed to this subreddit since it started , but i mainly lurk here and rarely post as ukrainian crisis took most of my attention . 
  so do n't judge me cause you just scrolled a little on my post history . 
  kurds got the guns after ? 
  isis controls little over 1/3 of the city . 
  bit that 's been steadily and slowly being reduced . 
  except even more us troops are getting deployed in afghanistan . 
   the taliban 's goal is to make the us withdraw . 
  us ai n't leaving afghanistan , despite this formal end of the war . 
   or if the bombers are merely incompetent . 
  my vote goes for that . 
  well i dodged that one . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  they instead blackmail you . 
  this is so damn fake . 
  nobody who posts legit recording of this would have this brown effect .
