  lol, 
  is this picture legit or not ? 
  i need confirmation . 
  thanks for confirmation . 
  it looked way to similar to lebanon film poster . 
  well he ca n't be worse than blatter . 
  right ? 
   jesus fucking christ , it 's a hell of a world we live in where a man with a pencil and a paintbrush can make a coward with a gun feel intimidated . 
  in past , it made a coward with a sword feel intimidated . 
  seriously , this is not a new phenomena . 
  it just happens much rarely and not by most of world governments in this century . 
  melodramatic much ? 
  germany is in incredibly great situation . 
  bilo je dobro . 
  it 's dead jim . 
  so basically you 're a sucker for populist rhetoric 's . 
  not because he actually made russia in any shape or form safer ( in fact he made it lot more unstable due to his catastrophic economic policies and waging proxy war in ukraine ) . 
  america saves hostages for the most part . 
  russia in other hand kills more hostages then the terrorists themselves . 
  maybe if they did n't show blatant corruption over sochi olympics , invaded ukraine , founded insurgents and terrorists in ukraine , oppressed crimean tartars , oppressed political opposition , kidnapped foreigners under `` spying '' excuse , violated airspace more then ever before in a single year and nearly crashing into a couple of civilian airliners during those violations . 
  and highly likely funds terrorism in eastern ukraine . 
  easier said then done . 
  the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  france still has way lower murder rate and terrorist attacks then usa , country with death penalty . 
  there 's a big increase of bombing attacks on ukraine government controlled territory in past month . 
  [ conflict news ] ( www.conflict-news.com ) and / r/ukraineconflict are way better places , as bbc lost interest to cover ukraine properly since mh17 being shot down . 
  not even close . 
  we do ? 
  that 's news for me . 
  i remember ign had an article talking about a.i. 
  in games not being improved for nearly a decade and in one of examples of good a.i. 
  was half life where valve given an a.i. 
  to bugs . 
  i just know someone at infinity ward read that article and wanted to show it as we 're improving a.i. 
  in this game . 
  kebab shop was bombed , not a mosque . 
  shootout did happen after a car accident and only two cops are wounded . 
  it 's either unrelated and some idiot involved in car accident had panicked by shooting at cops to run away or one of suspects was involved in car accident and just panicked when seeing cops approaching . 
  either way , it does n't look at all to be a planned attack . 
  why is it in croatian ?!, 
  i love it !, 
  afghanistan is doing rather well , considering it 's shitty situation . 
  they 're holding off talibans mostly on their own , while most of population rejects talibans and their ideology . 
  iraq is whole different story . 
   edit : annnnnd as soon as i post this , cnn tweets that this attack is considered terrorism , so i 'm wrong . 
  cnn posted that , there 's a big chance they 're very wrong . 
  * throws a cross at your face *, 
  crusades bitch !, 
  your family does n't represent entire country . 
  i 'm sure there 's more people loving russia then hating her , while vast majority does n't really care for russia . 
  at the time , bulgaria was assumed to join the entente ( but joined central powers later same year as bulgarian economy depended on austro-hungary ) , while greek king was very sympathetic with the kaiser and wanted for greece to ally with central powers ( but greek parliament instead side with the entente , but had to strip down king 's executive powers first and finally join entente in 1917 ) . 
  so i think that 's the case . 
   putin, 
   communism, 
  pick one . 
  no , it 's confirmed his alibi is correct . 
  europe is n't a country ? 
  and islamist extremists are only a very small fraction of muslim population , which is already very small minority in all eu countries ( france the most with 7 % , average in eu is less then 2 % ) . 
  less than 1 terrorist attack a year in entire eu is pathetically low to start any sort of major european war . 
  it would be interesting . 
  two named suspects are suspected to be trained by al qaeda in yemen . 
  and since al qaeda opposes isis and isis has no real support in yemen , it 's highly likely someone in al qaeda is raging right now for isis stealing their credit . 
  taliban were formed in 1994 , so where did you get extra 20 years ? 
  afghanistan mujahideen was a loose alliance of many different political groups , ranging between islamist , conservatives , nationalists and others opposing the ussr controlled regime . 
  that loose alliance died not too long after ussr collapsed and only then taliban were formed . 
  highly trained islamist terrorists never commit suicide . 
  it 's a grave sin to commit suicide , so they send illiterate ignorant folk to do that instead . 
  meanwhile to die in battle for the jihad is a great honor , so instead this guys will try to get themselves killed by the police in firefight . 
  not an expert so take it with a grain of salt . 
  isis wants to exterminate shia muslims and want to destroy all religious temples , holy artifacts and monuments even from sunni muslims . 
  as well they want to expand islam whenever there were any muslim country historically . 
  and obviously want to exterminate every other religion in their territory through forced conversions or killings . 
  al qaeda , while anti-shia , wants to reunite them back under sunni 's . 
  they have no interest expand but instead unite current muslim countries under same united state . 
  as well they have no interest to remove non-muslims out of their lands nor support forced conversions ( however neither oppose it ) . 
  as well they see their jihad as a war against western imperialism of muslim world . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  oh and another thing . 
  isis wants to create it 's own state , islamic state , and it fights through convectional military means . 
  meanwhile al qaeda is instead fighting through guerrilla and espionage means to spread their ideology to all muslim countries . 
  some sects of al qaeda did make peace with isis and even allied , but as a whole they 're still in opposition . 
   sure not all muslims are terrorists , ** but 99 % of terrorists today are muslims ** . 
  citation needed . 
  kurds are alright . 
  istria is important , ok ? 
  christian terrorists are notorious in many countries in africa , as well buddhist ones in some parts of asia . 
  they get very little to no coverage as they do n't attack westerners . 
  but there is no scientific statistic made to show that even 1 % of muslims support terrorism . 
  kurds live and idea of forming kurdistan state goes through syria , turkey , iraq and iran . 
  i was joking on the last part . 
  they have n't start killing people , so no . 
  they 're not as extreme as terrorists , in practice at very least . 
  i explained it earlier . 
   not an expert so take it with a grain of salt .
