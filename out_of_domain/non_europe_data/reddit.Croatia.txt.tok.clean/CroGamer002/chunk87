  as well they see their jihad as a war against western imperialism of muslim world . 
   edit # 1, 
   oh and another thing . 
  isis wants to create it 's own state , islamic state , and it fights through convectional military means . 
   meanwhile al qaeda is instead fighting through guerrilla and espionage means to spread their ideology to all muslim countries . 
  us never said that . 
  even on internet information warfront , you need some rotation to keep sanity . 
  well i still have only 2 gb of ram . 
   they are extremely lucky no one else ( hostages/police ) were hurt . 
  well one cop got wounded , as we see him dragged out of the scene . 
  moderates are fascists ? 
  establishment democrats are communist ? 
  i 'm sure this cop abuses power on his certain someone rear . 
  finally !, 
  by interesting , you mean bat-shit insane . 
  as if overwhelming majority of world population does n't use twitter !, 
  they 're used for nothing but as putin 's political weapon . 
  so wait , croats are greeks too ? 
  is that the pope john paul ii shooting out eye beams ? 
  kolinda 48,10 %, 
  twin , genius , sickly . 
  ck2 in nutshell . 
  i 'm not sure any amount of training will help that granny . 
  my guess is after mh17 being shot down , they 'll no longer risk any incriminating evidence against them being shown online ever again . 
  first asian pope elected before 2050 . 
  problem is n't burqua , problem is that is forced upon . 
  yeah , i meant from far east asia . 
  it 's shocking it even stood for this long . 
   then i started digging deep into facts and what was going on . 
  and ended up realising maidan was a coup orchistrated by us to get rid of pro-russian president . 
  us was barely involved for the most this conflict and euromaidan revolution caught everyone off guard . 
  if usa was involved , us would have been very aggressive on assisting ukraine . 
  instead , they treat ukraine as secondary conflict while wars in iraq and syria are still their primary concern . 
  russia ca n't afford it and assaulting during winter would be a massive mistake . 
   why would anyone sacrifice their lives and everything else just to grow that ? 
  lot 's of lies , propaganda and intimidation . 
  it had happened before in history many times . 
  russian economy in massive recession and it keeps growing worse due to oil prices , sanctions and no economic reforms in sight . 
  they could n't , yet they did it and now paying a massive price of that massive mistake . 
  control tower was pretty much abandoned a while ago and ukraine soldiers only went there to put up a flag of ukraine as a sign of defiance and as proof pro-russian forces do n't control that part of the airport . 
  unless ukraine army is capable to do [ operation storm 2.0 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm ) , it 's too damn ambitious claim . 
  strelkov is not in donbass nor has any control over dpr . 
  and note that he said he will no longer post on that forum ages ago , so this claim has no real credibility . 
  they 're still the biggest militia battalion . 
  i hope so . 
  eu needs to grow a spine and do it . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.hromadske.tv%2fsociety%2fvtracheno-tretinu-teritoriyi-novogo-terminalu-aero%2f ) , ukraine lost 1/3 of it 's forces . 
  i utterly misread it . 
  i should have went to sleep , instead . 
  world , especially russia , is not that lucky . 
  yet they claimed they captured the airport many times . 
  they bombed the airport more then anything else . 
  especially after ultimatum they declared 2 days ago . 
  they 're wasting troops at the airport instead to be used at maripoul and debeltseve . 
  they lost many troops and tanks and all for no real gain at the airport . 
  yet this guy has no shame to say this airport battle is not important and they could remove cyborgs with easy if they wanted . 
  ... well fuck , broken english got me . 
  my national pride is through the roof !, 
  hype hype hype !!, 
  horvat is croat in old croatian language , though . 
  though that hotel is in city dubrovnik , trailer was set in city zagreb . 
   dallas is still a bank manager , if i remember rightly . 
  so there 's that . 
  dallas would continue robbing people , but legit way . 
   in croatia there is no huge mafias, 
  you must have missed hdz and hns . 
   edit : croatian rifle . 
  former soviet state . 
  * hits you with vhs tape *, 
  not the case in 20 % of the matches . 
  oi , shit-for-brains !, 
  oh i need a link to full documentary . 
  youtube still wins , cause steam is primary focused on gaming . 
  youtube has political ideologies , nationalism , religion , anti-religion , science , pseudo-science and etc. 
  to make it way worse from steam . 
  i 'd prefer if there was a skill perk that gives you extra pager or two to answer . 
  or just fixing a.i. 
  pathing in stealth would help . 
  hmh , there are paradox games . 
   slavic tribesmen would trade cursed furs with the people of constantinople , which in turn converted the city into a beacon of dark magic and evil , thus justifying the fourth crusade in the following centuries . 
  pretty sure it did n't happened like that . 
  i had hoped you had the link . 
  yeah , you do n't get released from hospital only a few days after getting hit by an explosive . 
  uuuugh , this so damn cringy to watch . 
  i do n't think they even bothered to set correct date . 
   not like i have friends who died or ** who have been to concentration camps **, 
  wow . 
   to not allow enemy to take full control of our country , while this is happening we will wait for nato to build force and ** start a wwiii ** , which i 'm not sure will happen . 
  why does everyone say that war with russia means ww3 ? 
  what allies russia has ? 
  north korea ? 
  south ossetia ? 
  winter is the worst time to start military offensive . 
  either russia is desperate for quick victory or stupidly believe in myth that winter is russia 's ally like the most redditors do . 
  i 'd personally go for desperate part . 
  china has not been russian ally since sino-soviet split . 
  in fact , they were very close to get into the war between one another in late 60 's . 
  now china 's economy depends too much on exporting it 's stuff to the western countries and is very focused on becoming world economic superpower in next few decades . 
  they have no interest to join sides with russia , ever . 
  especially without any shared ideology .
