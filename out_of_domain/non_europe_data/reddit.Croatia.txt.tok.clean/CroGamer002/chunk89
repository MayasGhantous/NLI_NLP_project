  it 's berkut . 
  ukrainian police was a total joke during the whole thing . 
  point missed . 
  at least they 're not being neglected !, 
  totally worth it to secede . 
  why do this people hate catholics so much ? 
  it 's heavily outdated estimation . 
   bernie sanders will be successfully attacked as a socialist because he calls himself one , and that will scare too many americans . 
  this is your best candidate then !, 
  you can have different skill builds now , so it does n't matter that inspire is better . 
  now that 's very generous of this community . 
  ca n't wait to play as dragan !, 
  since it 's a melee attack boost , i think it should have extra percentage boost to be useful . 
  except it is ? 
  or am i just bad at this game . 
  game for me crashed often regardless do i use hoxhud or not . 
  i find the game more stable with huxhud , weirdly enough . 
  very nice . 
  well dragan is of different ethnicity . 
  where ? 
  if that happens , russia will lose military jets and pilots for no gain . 
  if they want to pull airstrikes in ukraine territory through dpr , none of those jets will survive ukraine aa defense . 
  ukraine will only get russian pilots as pow 's . 
  complete and utter embargo on russia !, 
  exact same thing happened to me while i was playing croatia . 
  however , did n't inherit byzantine as i my other son 's son was an heir to poland . 
  and since seljuk turks were just destroying byzantine and poland was huge , i elected my other heir to poland grandson to be next king of croatia . 
  it payed off long term . 
  if this is true , i simply have to be skeptical without proof , that this is a massive reveal . 
  internet thought me a lot of people are smart with their imaginations . 
  while i do think this post is quite legit , i 'll remain skeptical on this being actually legitimate . 
   but really , massive reveal about what ? 
  it would prove that it is n't ukraine and nato fiction , but reality that there are russian federation soldiers in donbass . 
  both sides need to get political solution they can agree on . 
  however , that 's impossible without one side capitulating to another demands . 
   ** afghan ** and iraq armies were both us trained and both are terrible . 
  ** ( especially afghan ) **, 
  afghanistan army is doing wonders , considering it 's 1st grader literacy and merely basic education . 
  they have n't lost a single territory from talibans yet either . 
  iraq is an only army that the us had trained and had many division collapsing without a fight . 
  russia is n't a super power . 
  most & orah koalicija ? 
  he 's dumb . 
  that 's not a pow , but terrorist/saboteur organizer suspect . 
   finland would never fall . 
  russia has attacked them before , and lost . 
  no , finland lost the war but managed to remain independent with some territorial loss . 
  to be air , some of us founding fathers did wanted to abolish slavery , but others resisted either to keep stability of new country and some for being pro-slavery . 
   that is n't really their biggest use . 
  even an utter imbecile could use simpler surface to air missile systems such as manpads or learn how to target artillery . 
  that explains why bunch of imbeciles were allowed to use buk in donbass war few months ago . 
  protestant christians do circumcision as well . 
  poroshenko really needs to stop being indecisive with decisions matter of war . 
  his first good decisions ever made . 
  i watched the movie 2 days ago . 
  what an awful movie . 
  i do n't see how people like this terrible movie . 
  state made by thieves for the thieves . 
  what 's pro-russian defense here ?!, 
  do tell me !, 
  i 'm talking about this order that is a flat out war crime . 
  what 's their justification on this ? 
  you mean like how poland declared war on germany ? 
  you do n't win wars by executing surrendering soldiers . 
  or will make ukrainians fight more viciously until bitter end , as they know they 'll die regardless and will instead slow down and take out as many enemies as possible . 
  not only is it morally bankrupt decision , but also idiotic military tactic . 
  [ proof of battle aftermath ] ( https://twitter.com/rconflictnews/status/558664149220487170 ) . 
   `` we never watch ukrainian news , only russian , because ukrainian news is lying , '' another woman chimes in . 
  then why do you listen to russian media ? 
  i must have imagined the whole nazi facist genocidal ethnic cleansing junta that wants to kill russians and russian language . 
  basically croatian `` get the fuck up !, 
  man , overkill has to allow us to modify gloves and armor colors and patterns . 
  you missed the point , he was n't a serb that ruined it all . 
  you were also poking the free giant eagle and a bulldog at same time . 
  no wonder it was n't fun . 
  this is why donetsk airport was an important battle . 
  now that it had been lost , there will be bloodshed in maripoul and debeltseve . 
  donetsk airport will become a minor thing , after what bloodshed goes through maripoul and debeltseve . 
  however this time , pro-russian forces shall fail . 
  it took them 4 months and massive casualties just to take one ruined airport that ukraine had difficulties to supply and reinforce . 
  this battles will be a slaughter . 
  yeah , that 's only gon na make maripoul residents to resist more . 
  obviously , they ca n't wait to get `` liberated '' by pro-russian forces . 
  my guess is too many pro-putin chechens and russian army soldiers went from chechnya to ukraine . 
  [ maripoul residents still paying respect to the killed , despite claims that dpr had entered maripoul . 
  [ maripoul residents still paying respect to the killed , despite claims that dpr had entered maripoul . 
  there 's pc master race group chat ? 
  nah , they can see into future . 
  executions are still legit , just recording studio is used to make geolocating impossible . 
  considering israel is in very good terms with russia , this accusation just shows how bad russian diplomacy is right now . 
  ukraine holds debeltseve and maripoul with heavy losses on each side , along with heavy civilian losses . 
  no , it would n't trigger ww3 . 
  it 's an absurd notion . 
  hahahahahahahahahahaha !!!, 
  we had no idea . 
  oh boy did we had no idea . 
  are there any pro-isis users here ? 
  not very often in this subreddit , so i 'm curious . 
  i 'm gon na go brave and say egypt , poland , iceland and argentina will win !, 
   i 'll watch argentina since i 've heard they play entertaining,
