  i sure as hell hope they 'll give same treatment to france , like brazil did to croatia last night . 
  lies !, 
  it 's a trap !, 
   that mistral deal is absolutely going ahead . 
  no , otherwise it would have happen by now . 
  instead process is dragged on with no indication that ships are ever coming to russia . 
  in fact , russia wants to sue france to get money back now , instead of getting those ships . 
   i say unnecessary because ukraine is ultimately irrelevant to the eu and it 's common knowledge that the eu was and is very reluctant to put further strain on their budgets with sanctions against russia . 
  [ hahahahahahahaha !!!, 
  ] ( https://news.google.com/news/story?ncl=dmjfsormxq0zqrm1y6oztv7kpo6im&amp;q=eu+sanctions&amp;lr=english&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=_2zgvmh6j4gqu7gphian&amp;ved=0ccyqqgiwaa ), 
  because small nations are incapable to decide own future !, 
  that is if you truly think russia would actually use nukes . 
  no , putin is incredibly stupid . 
  he has no sense of strategy and simply going mindlessly for short term tactical gains . 
  now for the entire region of kobane to be liberated . 
  i think ypg will need heavy reinforces though , kobane region is large to hold and they they ca n't risk to overstretch their lines against isis . 
  if mosul get 's liberated soon , i think isis will collapse as an army and defective state , while then return to it 's insurgent guerrilla ways . 
  this is such a massive blow to morale , that majority of their supporters will have to desert , surrender to saa/isf or defect back to fsa . 
  yeah , holding mosul is isis 's one last hope . 
  isf , do destroy that hope . 
   20-20 : dnr admit that the storming of peski failed and there will be no attempt to storm avdeevka in the near future . 
  ha-ha !, 
  and only poland did n't disappoint me . 
  considering primary job of spy agencies is to spread propaganda to keep it 's country people in check and to create disorder in opponent country , it makes sense . 
  is n't fbi just us federal police , not a spy agency like nsa and cia ? 
  if they somehow reach to the point to threaten take over of odessa , then full on total war mobilization will be declared . 
  sultan erdogan does not approve !, 
  you do n't need total war mobilization to defend maripoul and debeltseve . 
  now if those cities are lost , then it 's worth considering that desperate option . 
  that is one odd combination of music with combat footage . 
  and i have seen a lot of serb made videos with questionable combination of combat footage and certain music . 
  if there was youtube in 1990 's , you 'd see a competition between serbs and croats with the best slow-mo [ zolja ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m80_zolja ) shots . 
  damn dutch , you had one job . 
  hard on big oil job day 2 is super hard . 
  will citizens of kobane finally start returning to their homes ? 
  she 's a cheap populist and a puppet of ~ ~ mafia ~ ~ conservative party president who borderline has putin 's mentality . 
  that 's a terrible idea . 
  debeltseve is heavily fortified and encirclement had failed . 
  holding debeltseve ( and maripoul ) at all costs should be the top priority . 
  there will be no counter-attack if they retreat . 
  there will be lot 's of lives lost during the retreat . 
  debeltseve residents will suffer under pro-russian rule . 
  and pro-russians will continue to advance and ukraine forces defend , die and eventually retreat more due to lack of other fortified defenses . 
  no , retreat would be a disaster and more lives will be lost . 
  defending debeltseve and denying encirclement will cause massive casualties on pro-russian side as they 'll just keep hitting on heavily defended fortified city , not ruins of an airport with small troops presence . 
  more ukrainian soldiers will survive like this in long run and they 'll have a great position for new offensive in summer . 
  nice to know my country is helping out . 
  unless greece wishes to default on it 's debt , they wo n't piss off eu by forcing change of policy on russia . 
  nah , it 's totally a car mod !, 
  great wisdom of great sultanate erdogan-pasha . 
  yeah . 
  syriza is most likely just pulling a bluff for own political gains . 
  this is gon na be a massive massacre for pro-russian and their illovaisk . 
   350 + upvoted comments, 
  it likely means over 300 replies to that comment . 
  google and youtube thought it was a great idea to implement it like that . 
  russian army is not that good . 
  encirclement had failed so far and full on assault on debeltseve suggests pro-russian forces wo n't prioritize encirclement . 
  do n't discourage them from doing this again . 
  what a poor showing from croatia in first half time . 
  even if we manage to beat poland , any hopes for winning world cup are gone now . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  it 's over . 
  very shitty coach who thinks too highly of himself and his tactics . 
  only reason we remain on top is because we have great players , but alas not worth for being contender for winning anything without a coach worth a damn . 
  they wo n't do it unless they 're utterly insane . 
  do n't you mean referee bribing ? 
  greece . 
  or because it 's just an absurd conspiracy theory , as euromaidan was ongoing in ukraine . 
  i 'm sorry , usa prepared for civil war in ukraine is somehow a proven fact ? 
  that 's not an evidence . 
   that is what everybody said in 1990, 
  and your point is ? 
  are kosovo and south korea eligible ? 
  i always knew blatter was a defunct a.i. 
  how ? 
  you can take a civilian hostage and trade . 
  guards wo n't notice . 
  you lucky . 
  they 're out of major cities , only controlling some villages and mountains . 
  i like the guy in purple jacket . 
  he feels lost . 
  there was no coup . 
  yanukovich 's allies abandoned him and then he decided to flee the country . 
  he abdicated his position of president of ukraine by running away . 
  it was n't a war crime at the time and until after un was founded . 
  not only because it was an insane order commander refused to do , he also could n't do it as his garrison did n't had any explosives to even blow up a single bridge and that very small garrison could n't even damage a street bloc . 
  you can , i discovered that over a week ago . 
  some justice at last . 
  you could put gold sunglasses . 
  here i am jobless with no hope without making a drastic decision to leave my country , yet this professional victim gets to have a nice luxurious life just because someone on internet may have said something rude to her !, 
  fuck this shit !, 
   where 's ** bbc ** , cnn , ** euronews ** ? 
  they 're too busy shitting on greece . 
  also cnn is a farce for past decade . 
  that awkward time i 'll have too root for france . 
  well i 'd negotiate peace with fsa , cause they would n't hate my very existence like with assad . 
  cause i 'm not a war criminal nor committed crimes against humanity on them . 
  seriously this is a silly question , cause pretty much anyone not related or just supportive of assad regime would have easy time to negotiate peace with fsa , if they replaced assad . 
  however , they 're not sent to frontline until much after .
