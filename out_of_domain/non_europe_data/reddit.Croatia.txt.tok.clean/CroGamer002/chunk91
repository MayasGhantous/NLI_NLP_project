  eh , that 's not true ? 
  oh god those balkan borders !, 
  scratch that , entire eastern europe !, 
  well he was in a war zone , it would be very hard to not get at least bruised up . 
  bmp 's are mostly a death trap in this war anyway . 
  congrats poland on your bronze . 
  this is n't exclusive to handball , this is a massive problem with all professional sports . 
  even with rf regulars it 's impossible , without outnumbering ukrainian forces 3 to 1 . 
  yeah , no , that 's not gon na happen . 
  for the first time ever i 'm happy france won the world cup . 
  i damn hope this does n't happen again . 
   the bishop at my church was nearly excommunicated for speaking out against the abuse . 
  that 's bullshit , excommunication is the most severe punishment and it is not given out just for being a kinda dissenter . 
  they just wo n't stop milking this . 
  even bosnia arms ukraine too , so yeah . 
  this thread proves that removing downvotes was a terrible idea . 
  arming croatia worked well . 
  that happened in his last 2-3 years of rule , before that he was a sane person . 
  only the pope can order excommunication . 
   considering the poor success that any mobilization may achieve on both sides, 
  no , ukraine had mobilized all the people it needed , it 's just that only 20 % of mobilized reserves ** volunteer ** to go to the front . 
  theoretically it 's possible , because croatia mobilized over 200,000 troops out of 4 and half million population , during the homeland war in 1990 's . 
  however , it took over 4 years to do that with major arming from nato . 
  as well majority of mobilized troops were volunteers and many already fought in numerous militias all over the country . 
  my mistake then . 
   ** the economy has been destroyed **, 
   this makes it easier to draft men into war . 
  especially if ** the pay is good **, 
  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmh ... 
   yes , sure he was wounded . 
  how convenient . 
  you do n't fake mortar shrapnel wounds . 
  not gon na give long translations , as they speak mostly in russian then in serbian , but will write a short summary . 
  they first shout about freedom of all orthodox countries , then specifically say freedom for serbia , belarus and new russia . 
  after that talk about how they liberated the airport from fascists and that they 'll build a new airport , while making fun of on who 'll pay for that . 
  and then they speak in russian with cameraman few times talking in serbian , but nothing noteworthy . 
  well deserved celebration . 
  great save !, 
  no , otherwise he and his men would have been executed . 
  what this guy did is to retreat without any permission , leaving a major hole in debaltseve defenses and engendering entire city and rest of military forces in the city . 
  no country , but the us and philippines , allow militias until they 're in a desperate defensive war . 
  velike sramota . 
  do n't pre-order games . 
  does n't matter if game is blessed by gaben himself , do n't pre-order games . 
  there is no advantage for consumers to pre-order and it 's a very abused practice . 
  crimea is free to oppress . 
  neither was the taliban . 
  a group that was n't formed into the taliban until 1994 . 
  maybe they hired someone new to translate and botched the job ? 
  i still wait for them to support kosovo independence . 
  that 's not bad , it shows major improvements as well that eu countries are helping ukraine a lot . 
  i kinda noted eu countries , because lot 's of people still think that eu does n't assist ukraine beyond `` deep concerns '' and mildly angry worded letters . 
  ukraine has more then enough of tanks and grad 's , while their soldiers could use nato standard training that they 'll receive this spring . 
  giving them new weapons , with exception of anti-tank weapons like javelins , would actually hurt ukraine since they it would cause more strain into their already badly managed logistics . 
  while eu and nato could and should provide more help to ukraine , which it looks they will do more , so far they are providing significant enough support . 
  tanks are not the issue , but the tank crew is . 
   white single line on the bmp , is n't that ukrainian marking ? 
  could have been a captured bmp from before and pro-russians did n't bothered or were n't able to change it . 
   can you see the blue-yellow flag on the right tank 's turret ? 
  i would highly doubt that rebels would have such markings . 
  i can see a bit of blue , but no yellow . 
  and that blue stripe is too narrow to be for ukrainian flag . 
  could have been some other marking or coat of arms . 
   ukrainian tank - wolf is written on the barrel, 
   http://codename-it.livejournal.com/573821.html, 
  this two do look pretty same , i have to admit . 
  if it is a pro-russian tank , tank was either captured recently or it 's a strange coincidence for both sides having two tanks painted the same . 
  ** edit *** # 1 *, 
  on a second look , tank does n't look destroyed . 
  maybe trying to push that tank in front out of the ditch ? 
  it looks intact as well and ukrainian soldiers want to reuse it for themselves . 
  as well that bmp with a stripe is also intact , just standing there as troops are inspecting the damage . 
  senseless destruction of civilian property is a war crime . 
  no evidence of this claim yet to be proven . 
  man this war just refuses to get out of stalemate . 
  there was nobody in that building and city was fully under pro-russian control . 
  so yes , there was no need to destroy that building and it 's a war crime . 
  it would be funny if this happens some day . 
  uuuh , i wish i can be that optimistic . 
  i dislike the idea of mega-countries . 
  and it would be ironic way to make russia crumble from ever again being a super power . 
   interesting . 
  which countries are too big , in your opinion ? 
  with russia , it 's also china , india and usa . 
   oh , you obviously dislike russia . 
  their past and present policies do n't exactly make me love russia . 
  no , not ever there obama 's administration did it . 
  the people and oppositional political parties did it , with us government aid . 
  but i was told rada is keeping the status quo !, 
  they 're fighting for the city , this frozen wasteland is just in path for that city . 
  oh wow , game will be launched on my birthday . 
  well henry has yet to be close to the hornets nest , like simon was a few times . 
  he was in donetsk then yes , but never near the most fanatical or most powerful members of dpr like simon was . 
  and that interpreter definitely helps him to not get in same trouble simon got in . 
  he definitely looks he 's trying to be lot more cautious then simon in his reporting . 
  though i 'm using a word `` cautious '' loosely , since he does put himself in frontline where there 's major danger of getting killed by artillery or sniper . 
  because pro-russians in ukraine are armed insurgents ? 
  conflict will continue to escalate as long as ukraine rejects to be russian vassal state . 
  simon did return to ukraine [ for the parliamentary elections ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6eho05chee&amp;index=81&amp;list=plw613m86o5o5zqf6wjr8zuc7uwyv76h7r ) in ukraine and [ even for illegal elections in dpr ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0m8xy1tqp8&amp;list=plw613m86o5o5zqf6wjr8zuc7uwyv76h7r&amp;index=82 ) . 
  in fact , simon was in ukraine since [ early september ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1k6bn6f6kc&amp;list=plw613m86o5o5zqf6wjr8zuc7uwyv76h7r&amp;index=79 ) until [ mid november ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyeh6tfzouo&amp;index=86&amp;list=plw613m86o5o5zqf6wjr8zuc7uwyv76h7r ) of 2014 .
