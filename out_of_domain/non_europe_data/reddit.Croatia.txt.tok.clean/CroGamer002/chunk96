  which is why nearly every time after death of dictator , their country falls apart . 
  this is the most bizarre and the most hilarious thing i 've watched about this war . 
  i found it much better then in me3 , honestly . 
  i can do mining 2-3 times in whole one playthrough and get great upgrades in me2 , while in me3 i have to do it nearly every other main plot plot mission for minor rewards and just bumping up war assets . 
  i believe azov battalion claimed that 1/3 of their members are ethnic russians and nearly half of their battalion speaks russian as primary language . 
  that was said in late summer of 2014 , i believe . 
  in eastern ukraine , yes . 
  problem is that pro-russian forces will have massively difficult task to take territory west of maripoul and would make them very exposed by ukraine airforce as well ukraine navy . 
  also pro-russian rebels ca n't do a naval blockade without russia declaring open war and using own navy , so maripoul would be easily supplied by sea . 
  another thing , azov battalion is rather fanatical and most likely wo n't abandon the city nor surrender unless they have no supplies to do any fighting . 
  taking over maripoul would really be next to impossible unless ukraine leadership goes full retard or putin declares open war with ukraine . 
   i meant nothing bad by calling you `` amateurs '', 
  i think amateur is today mostly used in neutral form , instead of as an insult . 
   graham phillips is obviously a donkey ( he thought england were going to win the world cup ffs ), 
  someone in costa rica just died from laughter . 
  large chunk of population sure , but even more do n't speak russian . 
  guards and manager ( only walking civilian in bank ) can , but obviously you take them out first before putting a drill . 
  what a fucking douchebag . 
  i remember one time me and my friends set shadow raid heist and friend who hosted forgot to set it on friends only . 
  one pub showed up and bought all assets ( before pre-planning update ) , right before my friend kicked him . 
  we felt like assholes whole heist , for that . 
  there was only one bag zipline ( i think ) , dumpster shortcut only in one location , thermal paste at only one location close to van , spotter only at one location , no spy cameras , body bags case only at van . 
  aidar battalion is still suspended from being put in any active duty for their abuse of power , as well possible committed war crimes . 
  not yet disbanded , however . 
  even though it 's heavily unlikely and this is just nothing , but damn it would be very major if medvedev somehow pulled a secret coup . 
  yes , almost impossible scenario , but just damn it would be massive if it did happen . 
  a lot of people are shitting on ukraine government , but truth this they are trying hard on pushing many reforms while still dealing with war . 
  changes like this happen slowly and will take effect even slower . 
  while that does n't make them immune from criticism , some slack should be given . 
  as well near collapse of russian ruble and ukrainian hryvnia most likely also played the major part . 
  hahahahahahahahahaha !, 
  e , hvala puno . 
  mostly peacefull demostrations , with violence only erupting in kiev and lviv . 
  but why is it not in cyrilics ? 
  you should have fight me , not give me a factual answer . 
  they should stop listening to fox news . 
  so kia count of ukraine army went from over 1000 , to over 500 and now to over 360 ? 
  oh yeah , regadless if it was 360 or 1000 kia 's , that battle was a massive fuck up done by these high ranking military officials . 
  well around a 1000 combatans in that battle were killed , but on both sides . 
   or , more likely , until the situation is normalized and the western imperial powers begrudgingly accept the situation . 
   the western imperial powers, 
  what ? 
  someone save this comment for future reminder as he was correct . 
  ok , for that you 're allowed to hack just to get infamy i achievement . 
  it 's impossible if you depend on bots . 
  fucking retarded bots , not knowing turrets are to be avoided . 
  while i am ignorant of comic book sales industry , this numbers are pathetically low . 
  holy hell , this worked like a charm . 
  man did me and my friends got frustrated to do this on overkill . 
  ca n't wait to tell them this . 
  give me a break , spore had 8 years of game development . 
  8 damn years . 
  that 's how long you develop an mmo . 
  ea gave maxis a ton of time and resources , but their terrible management and lack of focus is what ruined the game . 
  you say as if there was a time where marketing was n't what got your game a massive success . 
  pretty sure usa won it with landing on moon . 
  they do now . 
  ussr had an early lead , but the moon was the main prize . 
  something what usa reached and ussr never could . 
  so did usa , multiple times . 
  and landed on moon . 
  with people . 
  and ussr admitted it 's space race defeat . 
  because communists in eastern europe are just fascist imperialists waving red flag . 
  so ofcourse they hate liberals . 
  699 hours left for me . 
  now this has to be my ring-tone now . 
  he gets hate ? 
  people were skeptical about him before release and many do n't like character pack being sold separately from heist . 
  but no outright hate post-release . 
  1/4 of mine country . 
  twice as much of population of my country capital city . 
   `` not croatia , i say ** mayor ** european counties '', 
  major *, 
  what are you , member of ukip ? 
  in other news , reddit missed my joke . 
  because uk has the most loud euroskeptics ( i.e. 
  ukip ) in eu 's mainstream media , it was kind of a must do joke . 
  why the hell would i bring eu politics on / r/pcmasterrace ? 
  i have / r/europe for that . 
  molotov cocktail something that was truly missing . 
  yeah , but he is even older then dallas . 
  while funny , it would be too easy . 
  because bioware makes mediocre pc ports . 
  now that 's massive development . 
  they wo n't , since you need dlc to get this hat . 
  hopefully it will bite them in ass in long run in this qualifications . 
  i really hate how spain still refuses to change it 's boring and easily exploited tactics . 
  hey now , croatia is not ... wait shit , game with italy . 
  well greece is ... wait , they 're awful this qualification . 
  goddamn it . 
  hey don ' offend neanderthals , they had advanced culture at the time . 
  because some people plan in advance to cheat . 
  ** anti-us circlejerk ** : `` they only made aids cure just to capitalize on it ! '', 
  is this good news ? 
  while beating assad is always great , but i 'm not exactly sure how al-nusra will work out much better . 
  did you just said assad should just mass murder massive civilian population and level an entire city ? 
  jesus , this is hitler level evil . 
  cheaters are n't usually bright . 
  assad has a massive ego issue to have golden/golden colored statues of himself all over the country .
