  viva la flaggy flag !, 
  it looks cool , a bit more analytical than i thought . 
  does na\u0161 have declensions ? 
  also , the name `` na\u0161 '' is quite funny to me because here rural people refer to speaking in croatian as speaking `` po na\u0161ki '' ( in * our * sian ) , so the name for your lang sounds a bit peasanty to me . 
  no offense , 
  metric is love , metric is life , 
  not to split hairs , but declension is changing a nominal ( noun , pronoun , adjective , ... ) through cases . 
  also , are you at all familiar with interslavic ( me\u0111uslovjanski ) ? 
  when i first stumbled into it i was amazed how much i actually could understand . 
  it truly could serve as a lingua franca for slavs ( not that i 'm implying that this is your goal with na\u0161 ) . 
  just curious . 
  me\u0111uslovjanski , of course , but it is intended to be that way , to be as comprehensive for all slavs as possible . 
  what is your goal for na\u0161 ? 
  a slavlang intended to be understood by others , or a slavlang created for fun , to explore strange concepts for slavic languages ( like extremely small number of inflections ) ? 
  i thought it was the latter . 
  well , i do n't mean to be rude , but na\u0161 kinda fails in the `` to be understood by all slavs '' department . 
  there needs to be a certain level of complexity in slavlangs for them to be understood by a large portion of slavic speakers , like seven cases , two numbers , konjugation in three singular persons and three plural persons , so on . 
  but i still look forward to find out more about na\u0161 , 
  well , i get the basic meaning of it once i know the context , but nothing more , it 's quite foreign to me , although it does seem that it would be easier for czechs and slovaks to understand ( i say that even though i do n't speak either sloven\u010dina or \u010de\u0161tina ) your backstory is quite cool  but i 'm afraid that austria-hungary was never going to have czechs and slovaks as an indepentend entity , but rather croatia , slovenia and bosnia under the [ `` lands of the zvonimir 's crown '' ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/trijalizam#/media/file:trialisti%c4%8dni_zemljevid_be%c4%8d_1905.jpg ) ( as opposed to `` lands of the crown of saint stephen '' and `` lands of the imperial crown '' ) . 
  so `` lands of the crown of saint wenceslaus '' were never going to be , not that that means there could n't have been an attempt at something like na\u0161 . 
  i went on quite a tangent there , did n't i :d, 
  well , this thread is getting ridiculously long , so i wo n't be replying any more , but definitely make a new post when you make that sound clip !, 
  looking forward to discuss na\u0161 again !, 
  ooo , sounds cool . 
  unfortunately , i was n't able to make out the words , so i had to read your text at the same time , one of the reasons being that na\u0161 has accents weird places ( like at the end of the word ) , which a bit foreign to south slavs . 
  no worries  in croatian , there are four accents : long falling , long rising , short falling and short rising . 
  the rules are :, 
  * no accents on final syllable, 
  * no falling accents in the middle, 
  * in one-syllable words - falling accent, 
  * one accent per word, 
  say-indicative . ( pres.active.contin . ), 
  drink-imprative seven waterglass-g . pl . 
  on day.a *, 
  i used this ipa chart for [ vowels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ipa_vowel_chart_with_audio ) and this one for [ consonants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ipa_pulmonic_consonant_chart_with_audio ) . 
  you-n so subhuman-predicate , pres.act.cont . 
  you are so ... subhuman . 
  kaaf - eye, 
  rdwr - old , ancient, 
  i wrote that on my phone , so i did n't have access to the letter < \u00fb  , so the word would be ` rd\u00fbr ' . 
  old niveni :, 
  ** saadi ** - to rise, 
  ** aarden ** - north, 
  ** rasood ** - coast, 
  ** x\u00fbrn ** - frost, 
  i 'll take :, 
  ** jhaadui ** - to taste, 
  ** zinaadun ** - meeting place , square, 
  ooo that 's nice . 
  and a good change from just replacing stars with hammer-and-sickles, 
  saudi arabia, 
  it looks suspiciously similar to [ german emperor 's standard ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_german_flags#/media/file:kaiserstandarte.svg ) . 
  it even has the same text `` s nami bog '' = `` gott mit uns '' . 
   consonants at the end of words are followed by a short / \u0259 /, 
  old church slavonic inspiration ? 
  ok , i just assumed you took inspiration from old church slavonic , because all its syllables have to end with a vowel . 
  in modern slavic languages , if you see a syllable ending in a consonant , it most likely ended in an `` ultrashort '' vowel , [ jer or jor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yer ) , which in time either became a normal vowel or the short '' \u0259 '' sound and then , eventually , it disappeared . 
  no offense , but these are quite ugly . 
  my two biggest complaints are : 1 . most ( or at least a significant part ) of the us related flags are very poorly designed and very ugly already , so , in turn , your redesigns are quite ugly too . 
  usa flag really does n't work as a canton , it is far too busy ( what with all the stripes and the 50 stars ) and it already has a canton , so it looks kinda goofy in the canton of another flag . 
  disclaimer : before some twat gets triggered i am just kidding, 
  i found that video ( and , by extension , your channel ) through xidnaf 's video . 
  now i am a new subscriber . 
  but that would be incredibly difficult to use in speech . 
  i can do the / b / sound , but only isolated . 
  i do n't think that would than be oc ( it stands for original content , what means that you made the flag you posted ) , although i do n't know how else you would flair it . 
  current , maybe . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  no they can not . 
  it 's white-red-blue-white-red ... so definitely not croatian tricolour . 
  it was just an off-handed comment , do n't worry about it . 
  what i meant is that although your post is n't oc , i do n't know how else you would flair it , because it does n't really fit any other flair . 
  redesigns seems to be the closest it can get , i think . 
  holy crap i 've never seen something like that before . 
  and the 0-economy period lasted for quite a while , too . 
  dear god that 's beautiful, 
  wind roars through my land . 
  traitor, 
  should that than be added in the rules ? 
  what do you think about using some cyrilic letters along with latin , or modifying latin alphabet in general ( like adding some letters from ipa ), 
  now i-n become-ind . pres.act . 
  death-n . sg . 
  void agent-n . sg . 
  world-g . pl . 
  thank you . 
  i have seen some user here ( ca n't remember the name ) use latin alphabet with some cyrilic sprinkled in so that 's why i was asking . 
  i was personally considering using ** \u0283 ** and possibly ** \u0292 ** . 
  actually , cyrilic letters are used along latin - in old church slavonic , old croatian and other old slavic languages ( ** \u044a ** and ** \u044c ** ) . 
  the sun ? 
  that sounds quite orwellian , like newspeek . 
  on the serious sinde , it sounds like your words will be quite long and complicated , you could get quite a lot of confusion if you have to use your opo - prefix for a word that already has opo - in it . 
  yup , made it in flagmaker, 
  honestly , you ca n't really use flagmaker for these flags . 
  you need to incorporate hold symbols somehow and flagmaker ca n't do that . 
  also , the falkreath one is quite bad ... 
  well , either just put in some proper dear head , or just make it colors , without the symbol . 
  perhaps something like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a4emxbh ) ? 
  the top color is for ever-grey sky , mid is for its great forests and bottom is for the lake ilinalta . 
  that 's why i asked  it hurts my eyes a little bit when i look at the flag for too long , and i made it, 
  i am croatian and i am currently using croatian keyboard , and the keys i have are : all english letters , \u0161\u0111\u017e\u010d\u0107 .
