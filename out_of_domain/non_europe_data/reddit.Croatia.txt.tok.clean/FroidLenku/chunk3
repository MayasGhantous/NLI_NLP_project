  none of these letters are used in my conlang . 
  perhaps i could use \u0161 and \u017e , but i generally do n't like consonants with diacritics . 
  because my conlang would n't look ( in my oppinion ) original enough , because it would use letters my mother language uses , and also i prefer to have separate symbols for separate sounds , diacritics on my vowels only change their length and depth . 
  thanks , looks good . 
  btw , type 3 is a mix between type 1 and type 2 . 
  type two is the way of typing when you do n't have access to diacritics and modified letters . 
  well , it is xd, 
  i used < c  for [ o ] because it looks similar , w for the same reason . 
  i had no ideas for [ \u0251 ] and [ e ] . 
  and , also , the different vowel lengths are short , medium and long , not short , long and overlong . 
  i just marked them as such because i did n't know how to mark shortness in ipa . 
  so [ i ] - short , [ i  - medium , [ i :  - long, 
  and , i forgot to mention that the alternative pronunciations for , for example x , are intentional and i want to keep them because it is correct to either way . 
  yrax [ \u0259 ` r\u00e4h\u0283 ] / [ \u0268 ` r\u00e4h\u0283 ] / [ \u0259 ` r\u00e4ks ] / [ \u0268 ` r\u00e4ks ] - all of these pronunciations are equally valid ( although i would use the first one ) . 
  i wanted to write a book , but it turned out i had no artistic talent , so i just focus on the world the book was supposed to be set in . 
  it would be amazing to have a thought in my language . 
  i use english frequently enough to sometimes have thoughts in it , but in my own language ... that would be cool . 
  it 's not at all weird . 
  i believe this is the first usage of the new phonology flair . 
  nice , 
  i see what you did there ... 
  heartland ? 
  empire ? 
  my spider senses tell me you took some inspiration from the elder scrolls , specifically lore of cyrodiil . 
  it looks very much like armenian . 
  i like it !, 
  i did n't mean to imply that it 's not your original idea , i was obvious that it was n't inspired by tes as soon as i saw text in your lang . 
  i only meant that the names are inspired by tes . 
  ( btw if you did n't know hestia was a cyrodiilic empress notable for conquering the kingdom of the reach and defeating their king , the red eagle ) . 
  also i am quite impressed with the scope of your conworld , you have a wiki ?!, 
  ( rhetorical ), 
  edit : some text, 
  lol . 
  but seriously , i meant the best , not the most over-the-top, 
  i disagree with his grades quite a bit . 
  it is also outdated . 
  ** zuun ** - physical , adj. 
  i guess i did n't understand the rules , i thought we were supposed to modify the last word in the chain and change it 's meaning a bit . 
  ( or did i change the word too much and did n't see the resemblance ? ), 
  edit : senos - zeon - zuun, 
  where did you find senyions , it 's senos , which is much more similar to zuun . 
  i admit i over-adapted , but i only skipped one step ( you can see it in the edit ) . 
  also , in my defense , in old niveni it is common for letters to move when making new words ( e.g. 
  but ok , i remain more faithful to the original word in future . 
  btw . 
  jenetiko -  \u0455\u0438\u0439\u0433\u043e | \u0237ii\u01f0o is a much better example for you to pick on, 
  hebrew, 
  i 'm listening ... 
  my conlangs are actually just reboots of previous ones . 
  the first time i tried to make a language for my fictional race and world ( i was twelve ) i basically just managed to make a shitty writing system ( i was much more interested in scripts ) , a few shitty words and a shitty conjugation of the two auxiliary verbs ( to be and to want ) . 
  after i started again i made up a bunch of words for the rebooted world and made a shitty language that was basically croatian with different words . 
  after i rebooted that , i developed a grammar a bit , so it is n't exactly the same as croatian and made up a bit over a hundred words . 
  now , old niveni is for yet another reboot of the word ( i 'm 17 currently ) , with words that are mostly inspired by my last reboot and with a new grammar that is also inspired by my last reboot . 
  the sound and setting for old niveni was heavily inspired by skyrim and dragon language . 
  i 'm on a computer and it displays as sen\u014ds ( senos with a straight line above tho o to mark length of the vowel ) and you used senyions in your reply so i was a bit confused . 
  but as i said , i get where you are coming from , it 's just that i think senos -  zuun is n't so very far fetched as symbol -  zebra, 
  ** teiam ** , teymaim , - a,-u / tejam / brook, 
  what compelled you to make this ? 
  it become-pres . cont.act . 
  difficult differentiate-inf . 
  satire-acc . sg . 
  and straight idiocy-acc . sg . 
  ** ayktun ** / ajktun / river head, 
  this sounds like a really cool idea . 
  i think i would get a nervous breakdown trying to come to terms with such ambiguous and impractical language . 
  beautiful , 
  also , do you have an idea of how will this language sound , like semetic , slavic or something else ? 
  huh , sounds interesting . 
   in an ideal universe , this would be a language that would make the speaker speak it for the beauty of speaking it , and it would make listeners listen to it for the beauty of it . 
  that reminds me of tolkien 's stories and the ainulindale . 
  old niveni is very much wip , so this will change :, 
  croatian , latin, 
  in my school informatics is compulsory , we use python . 
  i quite like your idea and , to answer your question , no , they never spoke , they always used telepathy . 
  i was wondering how would they even form concepts and ` sentences ' in that script if language actually never existed . 
  i have , but i think such a script would have to be even more abstract and even less language-like . 
  also i like how the maya script has alternative ways of writing symbols , like it was n't complicated enough .
