  your kingdom will come .

  please give us our bread,

  but save us from darkness . 
  amen, 
  well , it is kind of brainwashy , but it still has huge cultural importance . 
  here we are n't evaluating text on how moral its message is , how it is used or even its factual correctness . 
  so please , just focus on the text itself , from a linguistic point of view . 
  even mein kampf should n't be a problem ( in my opinion ) for translating , as long as people are n't endorsing nazism .

  qing empire will rise again !,

  btw for some reason that image has -7 upvotes on imgur !,

  that 's supposed to be ` redesigns ', 
  hejun / he\u0292un / - ornament, 
   myth : according to a culture , the world was created when the god marduk slayed the goddess tihamat into two halves . 
  from the upper half he created the sky and from the bottom half he made the earth . 
   adaptation : according to another culture , there was originally only one god and the world was in chaos , with darkness above `` tehom '' ( = word for `` deep water '' ) , and the spirit of god was hovering above the water . 
  in the second day , god took the water , and separated it into two halves with the horizon . 
  from the upper half he later created the sky and from the bottom half he created the earth . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , the second one is genesis ? 
  hexuru / heh\u0283uru / - appearance, 
  yess, 
  these are still very much wip , i just started yesterday toying with the idea of noun classes , honestly i do n't think i 'll keep them, 
  ** class 1 ** : conlanger , demon , wife , klingon, 
  ** class 4 ** : dog , bush , uv-radiation, 
  ** class 5 ** : conlanging , radiating , marriage, 
  * ahem * byzantine nordic cross, 
  2nd or 3rd , definitely not the first one . 
  that seems like a really cool conworld, 
  i 'm interested in the setting of na\u0161 , if i recall you said it is used in some alternate version of austria-hungary, 
  i 'm interested in the setting of na\u0161 , if i recall you said it is used in some alternate version of austria-hungary, 
   or should it be abolish just like the [ nazi swastika ] ( http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450f/tsminteractive.com/files/2011/09/naziflags1.jpg ) and the [ soviet hammer and sickle ] ( http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4824044600_5f94c18bbf.jpg ) as they stand for racism too ? 
  how does hammer and sickle stand for racism, 
  also , i 'm not american , but i think that everyone should be able to fly whatever flag they want , but that only the government 's flag should be flown on the government grounds, 
  why nsfw, 
  well , it 's still not racist, 
  austria did n't really conquer hungary , the habsburgs ( the dynasty which ruled austria ) became croatian and hungarian kings and were also holy roman ( aka german ) emperors . 
  their lands were later reorganized ( because they were n't really a country but rather a collection of various territories under habsburg rule ) in the austro-hungarian empire . 
  yes . 
  they were forced to give hungary more power and made it an equal to austria in that new state . 
  so first : croatia and hungary were in a personal union ( which has , eventually , seen the habsburgs ascend to the throne ) , bohemia was once a kingdom ( with habsburgs as kings ) but after the reformation and a rebellion the habsburgs removed its status as a state and a kingdom , slovakia was in hungary , austrian and slovenian lands were basically habsburgs ' fiefdom , etc. 
  after napoleon abolished the holy roman empire ( of which the habsburgs were often the emperors , it was an elected title ) the habsburgs still ruled all of the before mentioned lands , but they still were n't officially a single country , although they effectively were one , just by virtue of being ruled by the same person . 
  np , also they could n't have conquered them all , the majority of habsburg soldiers were not german . 
  this made my day, 
  looks pretty cool , but is completely implausible . 
  this seems very interesting , i like it !, 
  thanks , i 'll check it out, 
  ` northern imperial sky navy ', 
  sade - sea, 
  andar - empire, 
  aarden ( dron for compounds ) - north, 
  this word is so absurd because old niveni has mostly short words and very few compounds , and that word could be said like this :, 
  krist\u017fyn [ krist\u0283\u1d4an ], 
  hristorei , if translated literally, 
  finally someone , 
  i 'm sad that so few people outside croatia and some other slavic countries know about glagolitic . 
  i 've lately been adapting a glagolitic font for old niveni , it 's called `` vinodolski zakonik '' if you 're interested . 
  do you use glagolitic for your conlang/s ? 
  [ fixed ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/zastava_republike_hrvatske#/media/file:flag_of_croatia.svg ), 
  yeah , it 's old niveni ( or ` stari nivenski ' in my mother language ) . 
  it is an a priori conlang and was used by the ancient people who lived in the far north of my conworld and were called ` the old niveni ' or ` the old nivens ' ( sample text : * ainule zaj hun saami darimv , z tor\u00f4ke tirimi ei saad xuurys * ) . 
  they and their language are called ` old ' because the land is still named after them but is now inhabited by my version of slavs who also call themselves ` the niveni ' and their language is called ` naevin ' ( sample text : * vosdah hucze m\u00e6h semlah , vosdije se stableh tar dije morazu * ) . 
  old niveni is not related to naevin . 
  these slavs ( the ` new ' niveni ) used their script , glagolitic , to transcribe old niveni texts . 
  as you can see from my flair , i 'm from croatia . 
  edit : here 's [ the font ] ( http://www.nenad.bplaced.net/doku.php/hr:glagolvinodolski ) , if you 're interested . 
  i used font forge to ` correct ' it and modify it . 
  might i ask for some info about your conlang ? 
  ( the slavic one you mentioned ), 
  edit 2 : the both sample texts say : * wind roars through my land , it climbs trees and raises frost . 
  i have recently lost hope in flagmaker , i thought nothing original could be made in it anymore . 
  you have restored my hope . 
  i use excel, 
  i 'm sorry about this,
