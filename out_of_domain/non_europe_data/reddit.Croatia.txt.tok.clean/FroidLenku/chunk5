   if it was a successor of the byzantine empire rather than the roman . 
  if it was a successor of the byzantine empire rather than the ** western ** roman . 
  roman empire split in eastern and western roman empire , the eastern half survived a thousands years longer that the western half . 
  eastern was later referred to as ` byzantine ' by other europeans . 
  but podcast numbers will get out of sync with the months . 
  you will have to make like three episodes in may . 
  republic of china , only china, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzuu1q8qpok ), 
  i love sabaton , too, 
  welp , at least we have jurjevo and some cool bonfires , right ? 
  my god , this version of croatian flag looks horrendous , you should rethink it . 
  others are pretty cool, 
  helsinki can into fourth rome, 
  it seems cool , will you update us on grammar ? 
  also , why runes ? 
  confederate states of siresea ? 
  this looks very darksoulsy or bloodborny, 
  same, 
  why did they change it ? 
  nice . 
  the last one is a bit of an overkill , i think . 
  how would you even look up pronunciation of a conlang 's name . 
  it 's a conlang . 
  you ca n't know how to pronounce it , only if the conlanger provides ipa will you be able to . 
  edit : this does n't mean that i think conlangs should all have stupid anglicized names just so some twat can feel better . 
  my own conlang has an anglicized name just because it 's very easy to make . 
  niven - a person , niveni - a language . 
  in my mother language , croatian , i call it nivenski . 
  it 's quite ugly , but it mirrors the soviet flags perfectly . 
  if that 's what you were going for , nice work . 
  then why so much downvotes , it 's great, 
  is there a flaggy flag flair ? 
  it 's elsa\u00df not alsace and stra\u00dfburg not strasbourg !!, 
  yeah , it really looks like anor londo or maybe irithyll, 
  * facepalms *, 
  i was joking . 
  notice a lack of german empire flair next to my username ? 
  i quite like the current flag of portugal , but the rest are awesome, 
  that did n't work for me, 
  that 's a crazy orthography you got there, 
  yeah , the capitals in the middle of the words and that weird ' \u0404\u03f5 ' letter . 
  the diacritics are not that strange . 
  what is the significance of those capitals in the middle of the words , anyway ? 
  still is, 
  i 'm really annoyed that people use ` europe ' as a synonym for the eu . 
  uk is a part of europe , like it or not . 
  except the eu is n't a state , and member nations are free to leave , unlike yugoslavia . 
  oh a fellow citizen of the great hello internet, 
  again , the eu is n't a state . 
  it 's an alliance . 
  think of it as , say the commonwealth of nations , just with more significant power . 
  edit : also , [ `` any member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/withdrawal_from_the_european_union ), 
  op , why did n't you put the whole name of hsv in the title ? 
  i was just joking * notice the xd at the end of my post * because the full name is hamburger sport-verein . 
  what makes it more republican ? 
  but this one has no monarchic elements . 
  how did you repost so quickly . 
  it just loaded for me, 
  i did n't know you made it , so i did n't credit you . 
  yup, 
  hammer and sickle is kinda soviet symbol , and not really universal communist . 
  also , communists would n't keep crosses and monarchic elements on flags, 
  how many speakers does vyrmag have ? 
  a proud hello internet citizen , i see, 
  or monolingual speakers of some slavic language, 
  i think your conlang is amazing . 
  i 've always liked how latin sounded and its words but i do n't like how its grammar works . 
  your conlang is in my opinion perfect . 
  or from the witcher, 
  you could use fita ( \u0472 , \u0473 ) for / \u03b8 / . 
  it was used to transcribe greek theta . 
  of course , muricah remains unchanged, 
  notice the '  ' it implies that i 'm joking . 
  germans call that land lothringen , the french call it lorraine . 
  it was once a part of germany , that 's why i ` corrected ' him/her, 
  yeah , fair enough . 
  please stop that joke . 
  it was repeated so many times, 
  i 've visited budapest and paprika was literally everywhere . 
  i mean , i saw it hanging in front of shoe stores , shoe stores !!, 
  etc etc, 
  basically , https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillologycirclejerk/search?q=cyprusized&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on, 
  yeah but seriously . 
  they 're no longer funny . 
  if you 're just say ` cyprusized whatever ' and just plop a map of ` whatever ' on the flag of cyprus , just do n't . 
  the more unique ones are fine , i guess . 
  that 's precisely what i thought . 
  polish is also weird because it uses w for / v / and v for nothing . 
  also , regarding your vocalic r situation , this is an actual sentence in my native language , croatian : * ... i cvr\u010di , cvr\u010di cvr\u010dak na \u010dvoru crne smr\u010de . 
  [ ahem ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/38enb8/flag_of_a_trialist_austriahungary/ ), 
  you should 've credited the creators , / u/vkreso for this version and / u/foulcoke for the original , with the crown of st.steven, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/38enb8/flag_of_a_trialist_austriahungary/ ) is the original post from which op copied the flag . 
  it 's discussed there . 
  well , maybe this would symbolize that austria is the center , the leader , and hungary and croatia ( they would be equal in this scenario ) are its satellites, 
  yeah , i know , but this would also be a plausible explanation . 
  almost none . 
  it was supported by croatian elite , but not really in vienna . 
  based on the symbol of the [ illyrian movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illyrian_movement ) , ** `` ljeljiva '' ** . 
  it is also featured on the [ current flag and coa ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/zastava_republike_hrvatske#/media/file:flag_of_croatia.svg ) , but is colored blue for aesthetic reasons .
