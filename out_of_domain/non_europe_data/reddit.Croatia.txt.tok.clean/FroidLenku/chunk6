  it 's [ this way ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillologycirclejerk/ ), 
  i 'm pretty sure that most croatians know who the illyirans were and that this was their symbol , they wo n't mistake ljeljiva for a muslim symbol, 
  well , we can mostly understand them . 
  especially if we 're from the north , that 's where dialects are more similar to slovenian . 
  also , the main difference is in vocabulary , grammar is more or less the same . 
  osman by ivan gunduli\u0107 , an epic from 17 . century . 
  well , if a slovenian and i both make an effort we can understand each other but if i just listened two slovenians talking in the street , i probably would n't be able to understand as much , perhaps around 60 % if i really concentrate . 
  it does n't get much recognition . 
  i was gon na say quenya , but i guess it is too inspired by gaelic . 
  i really want to show people my lang , but it is considered extremely nerdy and i 'm in high school so i ca n't really do it without being shamed ( i think ) . 
  i guess i could show it to family members ... but nah, 
  i do n't think that was where op was going with this, 
  viva la flaggy flag !, 
  i wanted to do something like that for croatia ( it also used glagolitic , although a [ prettier kind ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagoljica#/media/file:vergleich_glagolitische_schrift.jpg ) , in my opinion ) but i just never got around to doing it . 
  nice work !, 
  i really like the sound of l\u00fathnaek . 
  do you have any documentation you could link to ? 
  i figured out what the diacritics are . 
  quite nice-looking , too . 
  i never really liked azeroth because it felt a bit ... too unrealistic , too fairy-tale-esk . 
  you 've changed that , good sir . 
  that sounds a lot like bloodborne , i like it !, 
  sure , croatia please . 
  ooo , that seems like an awesome idea . 
  i think it would be like old english-norman type thing . 
  turkic words would be used for more prestigious things , like meat and slavic for animals ( you know pork-swine , beef-cow ) . 
  it could be interesting . 
  that 's because persian and arabic languages were languages of culture , science , islam and so on . 
  they were the languages of more advanced , higher cultures that influenced the turks . 
  it was the opposite during the norman conquest and i imagine in this scenario as well ( or the two cultures are on an equal level ) . 
  are you hungarian ? 
  i 'm actually starting to experiment with more than 7 cases . 
  this is a big deal for me because i 've never studied a language with over 6 cases and my mother language ( croatian ) has 7 cases . 
  also , the conlang i 'm experimenting with is my long running conlang which previously had 7 cases . 
  do you have any advice for me ? 
  well , so far i have ** nominative ** * ( subject ) * , ** accusative ** * ( direct object ) * , ** dative ** * ( indirect object ) * , ** possessive ** * ( literal possession ) * , ** genitive ** * ( any kind of relation , partitive ) * , ** vocative ** , ** instrumental/comitative ** , three spatial/temporal cases - ** locative ** * ( at the location ) * , ** ablative ** * ( motion away from ) * and ** lative ** * ( motion towards ) *, 
  what is your mother language , predsjedni\u010de ? 
  the idea is that old niveni was discovered and transcribed by ` con-slavs ' in my conworld . 
  the orthography has changed a little since i wrote that text , e.g. 
  i no longer use [ ` i\u017eica ' ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/i%c5%beica ) and so on ... 
  i made an assumption based on your username , seems i was wrong . 
  no , most of them were n't . 
  they were communist , but sovereign . 
  yugoslavia was for example hostile towards ussr, 
  your world is ... strange , to say the least . 
  care to elaborate or link me to a summary ? 
  no , dative and locative have a pitch accent difference . 
  also locative singular morphemes are the same as dative singular , but locative plural is not the same as dative but as instrumental plural, 
  it 's actually very nice . 
  no glagolitic :( i 'm disappointed, 
  sure . 
  you do n't have to mark the number at all , if you choose so . 
  two jerks unsubbed lol, 
  maybe the iris could be a little bigger and the chequy be made from actual squares ? 
  it 's from `` we are most amused '' if anyone is wondering, 
  [ perfect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perfect_ ( grammar \\ ) ) can refer to both the tense and the aspect . 
  the same goes for [ imperfect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperfect ), 
  it 's chi and phi . 
  also is ' \u0268 ' what you mean by upsilon , because latin alphabet already has uspilon - y, 
  your idea of eastern europe is ... interesting . 
  you more than doubled the size of `` eastern europe '', 
  holy crap, 
  damn , i was just about to write that , 
  categorical powers , definitely . 
  i try to make my magic system appear as believable and as realistic as possible and `` knacks '' do n't really suit that . 
  although , i try and make individuals/factions have colors associated with them , for example my necromancers ' magic is green and black and so on . 
  ** d avindyhl hers-deies vian\u00f4rys . 
  you lived through the seventeenth year . 
  it is not surprising .

  happy birthday btw , i too am seventeen , 
  that must be a nightmare to write , do you have a custom keyboard layout ? 
  old niveni :, 
  ** doijhland ** * [ d\u0254j ' \u0283la\u0308nd ] *, 
  the ship in the middle has a too big blob of black , maybe use some different colours ... 
  you could use [ \u00darogham ] ( http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/urogham.htm ) , which is ogham adapted for writing by hand on paper . 
  would n't spaindonesia be philippines ? 
  kyle kulinski of secular talk on youtube . 
  he mostly deals with us domestic policy , but he covers their foreign policy as well, 
  slavic stuff , the witcher is a great example of it being implemented right, 
  i would like to see your code , if that 's alright . 
  i currently study python in middle school . 
  how on earth does this remind you of czech , is it because of na\u0161 , another op 's lang which is actually based on czech ( and some others ) ? 
  or maybe the diacritics ? 
  egyptian also is n't semitic , but is afro-asiatic, 
  so that means that all the religions you mentioned are true in your world ? 
  it was rigged all along . 
  sanders should 've won the nomination . 
  or end parties all together, 
  i wanted to write a book with a fleshed out lore and background world , but i got stuck in the worldbuilding and realised that i 'm not talented enough to write and whenever i tried it was shit . 
  now old niveni is partly a personal conlang and partly for the world . 
  please do n't name it linga , that 's so incredibly boring . 
  many many romlangs have terrible names like that . 
  regarding the translation ... only thing i could make out is * `` voice of the people ... something '' *, 
  that seems like an awesome idea, 
  i noticed that a bit different versions of latin are taught in middle schools depending on the country , where did you attend mid.sch . 
  that 's actually pretty cool, 
  you are aware that we do n't know what ` correct ' pronunciation of classical latin is , yes ? 
  i dunno , vos popul\u00ed sounds cooler , but just popul\u00ed works a little bit better as a language name .
