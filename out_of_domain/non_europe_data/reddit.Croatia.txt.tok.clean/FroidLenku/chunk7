  i would personally go for the cooler option , but it 's your conlang . 
  your lang seems very ... polish, 
  chromoturgy sounds cool, 
  how much time and effort did you put in all those languages . 
  that 's a huge hobby . 
  slavic mythology is rich with dark and creepy gods/entities . 
  you could use ingredients to invoke them and they would fit nicely in a dark fantasy . 
  slavs , like germanic tribes , also had a world-tree but instead of it being ash ( as yggdrasil was ) it was an oak . 
  gods were often associated with the parts of the world-oak . 
  you could use that parts as ingredients for invoking the gods along with their symbols if they have any . 
  veles/volos/voloh is the god of the underworld , magic , has horns and is known to transform in a horned snake and other animals . 
  he is associated with the root . 
  there is a ritual , `` plesti velesovu bradu '' , `` to braid veles ' beard '' where people braid wheat and hang it to bring them luck . 
  a horned snake could be considered his symbol . 
  perun is the god of thunder and sky . 
  he has a spear he throws at veles when he pisses him off . 
  he is associated with the treetop . 
  people used tho draw the `` thunder signs '' , `` gromoviti znaci '' on their roofs to protect their houses from perun 's spears aka lightning . 
  you could use those . 
  morana is the godess of winter , ice and death . 
  she could be associated with the treetop , or the root . 
  svarog/svarun is the god of the sun . 
  he has a symbol called kolovrat . 
  svarog has a son , svaro\u017ei\u0107 , who is often considered a personification of the sun and fire . 
  there are many more . 
  for more info and images just google `` slavic mythology '' and go to the wiki page . 
  also , i know all this because i myself am a slav and i was interested . 
  the white sea you 're referring to , do you mean the real-world white sea in russia or some other body of water , because i 'm not sure if this is set in a conworld or alt history earth or just earth . 
  how did you decide on vocabulary . 
  as far as i know only a few words of etruscan are known . 
  colors in my magic system depend on multiple factors and are character/faction specific , not spell specific . 
  first is what soul-color i want that character 's magic to have , and i try to rationalise it from there . 
  if a user is interacts with the nothingness , depending on its presence , all their magic gets engulfed by thick black ... smoke , i guess , and their soul-color glows in the middle of the '' smoke '' . 
  the user 's soul-color is dependant on their soul 's type ( characteristics ) and the source , and by extension type , of their magic . 
  the s\u00fbl , necromancers , have a creepy , sickly green soul-color as they draw their power from their own soul and their enslaved and bound deaths . 
  the consequences of bounding ones death is that your magic leaves nothingness behind , so , naturally , a s\u00fbl 's magic is always engulfed by darkness . 
  the fiirn family are the last remnants of their kind . 
  they do n't have deaths . 
  well would n't that make them undead , you ask . 
  they too do n't have a death . 
  true , the difference is that the fiirns are a relic of a long-gone world , they 've never had a death , their souls are different , older , and their color is cold blue , reflective of their icy personality and cold northern home . 
  when their world ended , the mist transported them here , and the journey branded their souls with nothingness . 
  they too are engulfed by it . 
  as a final example , that order within the demetrian church you 've heard about lately , no , they are n't tricking us , they truly have power but i 'm certain someone or something is providing them with it , it 's not from their own souls . 
  an unknown old god , perhaps ? 
  whatever it is , it has to have an agenda because it gave their magic holy golden color . 
  oh well , time to go now , good chatting with you . 
  why so many downvotes ? 
  this i can relate to, 
  persian and old church slavonic, 
  oh my god how did i not see any posts from you . 
  i want you to link me all the documentation of these languages you have , now !, 
  cool , but i think it would remain red and white . 
  on the other hand , that would n't look nearly as soviety, 
  you seem to draw a lot of inspiration from slavic culture/mythology . 
  i like that , 
  holy shit that 's terrifying, 
  do you have a book or something , because if you do , i would be very interested in reading it . 
  perhaps even buying it , if i can afford it . 
  because i 've so far loved everything i saw written by you . 
  ooo , that gave me ideas, 
  you could 've probably divided the land a bit differently , but other than that , a cool map . 
  d you have a political context and a time period for this state, 
  i thought `` herself '' referred to elenwen, 
  [ relevant thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2xfjw9/i_just_wrote_a_thing_that_explains_a_lot_of_things/ ), 
  and polish, 
  it has a lot of ` w ' - s and looks like it 's impossible to read xd, 
  actually , that 's an easy word for polish standards ( and i thing it 's spelled ** w\u0142adek ** ) . 
  i thing it is pronounced / vwadek / . 
  yeah , but that 's not what i meant . 
  yugoslav is not a nationality , ethnicity , or anything . 
  that 's like saying austro-hungarian , or soviet . 
  * freedom fries, 
  what , a tigfa flair . 
  akkadian language is completely different from dovahzul . 
  akkadian cuneiform is similar to dragon script only in appearance . 
  that plot twist ... 
  so , casting ` non third way ' spells does n't put the mage on trial ? 
  i 'm croatian and i 'm also a proud hello internet citizen . 
  in my world a * human * is a species created from primates ( from * genus homo * ) that were experimented on by some eldritch abominations which resulted in a * human * - defining phenomenon called a * soul * . 
  technically , the undead ( or * the first * ) the purest * humans * because they were made in the first experiment by said eldritch abominations . 
  a * human * has superior intelligence to a * homo sapiens * , his emotional state is similar to a psychopath or a sociopath ( although sadism is not very common ) and also a * human * has a high degree of control over his body ( e.g. 
  if they are tortured they can temporarily `` shut down '' their sense of pain ) . 
  there are very few ` true ' * humans * left , however . 
  the ones still existing came to this planet through a series of time-shifting , space-bending , reality-warping , alt . 
  universe-clashing events . 
  the inhabitants of the planet that refer to themselves as `` human '' are almost in every way identical to the primates of the * genus homo * , except they have a soul , although their soul differs from a * human * soul . 
  the new , ` lesser ' humans have a ` split ' soul , consisting of the * essence * and that human 's * death * . 
  the purest of * humans * lack a * death * of their own , so they are called `` undead '' . 
  that 's very interesting , i 'll have to check it out in detail . 
  thanks !, 
  i have dragons , but they are semi-cyborg experiments created by the s\u00fbl ( the necromancers ) . 
  a mind can be ` uploaded ' into them , but usually , they are just operating by their default program , a semi-intelligent flying tank . 
  how did you come by that translation ? 
   if not , is there a site for fan-submitted words where it could be found ? 
  that 's why i 'm asking , i do n't know about any non-cannon dictionaries , but i would like to . 
  could you tell me ? 
  i often need a word in dovahzul ( for a conlang i 'm making ) but there is no cannon version of it and i do n't want to keep asking for it here . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/40rcjf/flag_of_josip_jela%c4%8di%c4%87_ban_of_the_triune_kingdom/ ) is an old post of mine where i linked to possibly a first ever [ croatian tricolour ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gphrbtk.jpg ) from 1848 . 
  the tricolour was made by combining the flags of the habsburg kingdoms of [ croatia ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/kraljevina_hrvatska_pod_habsburzima#/media/file:flag_of_the_kingdom_of_croatia_ ( habsburg \\ ) . svg ) and [ slavonia ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/kraljevina_slavonija#/media/file:flag_of_the_kingdom_of_slavonia.svg ) .
