  yeah , but just think of how much was taken from greece , mesopotamia , rome and egypt by the british alone . 
  i mean , we in zagreb have a bunch of egyptian stuff along with an [ etruscan mummy ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/zagreba%c4%8dka_mumija ) from alexandria . 
  we also have had stuff stolen by the venetians , the hungarians , the turks , ... like [ * hrvojev misal * ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/hrvojev_misal ) , for example . 
  if everyone started giving back everything , it would be a complete mess . 
  ooo that looks cool, 
  how many native speakers does focurc have ? 
  also , i thought focurc was considered a dialect of scots . 
  oh , i thought it was a conlang . 
  yes , as i stated multiple times , i know that . 
  what i want to know ( also stated multiple times ) is where i can find a ** non-cannon ** dictionary . 
  how did i not see that . 
  thanks !, 
  do you have any slavic background ? 
  i ask because i pretty much never see anyone who is n't a slav messing with slavic mythology and folklore . 
  i 'm surprised i have n't seen that ` broken wheel ' inn mentioned yet . 
  ** would a ` reverse nazalisation ' be realistic ? 
  often in a language a nasal consonant turns the preceding vowel into a nasal vowel and disappears . 
  for example * am * 'n * \u00e3 * . 
  i very much dislike the sound of nasal vowels , but i 'm considering putting them in a protolanguage if i could dissolve them into * vowel plus nasal consonant * ( so * \u00e3 * would become * am * ) . 
  would that be at all realistic ? 
  edit : so , i want my protolang to have nasal vowels which would in my main conlang ( a direct descendant of the protolang ) become vowel + nasal consonant . 
  i am wondering if a nasal vowel becoming vowel + nazal consonant is at all naturalistic, 
  jafiki91 coming to rescue as always . 
  many thanks !, 
  1 . viking is a perfectly valid name, 
  2 . the horned helmet misconception is older then wagner, 
  3 . wagner was dealing with german/germanic mythology , a version of which is norse mythology . 
  sigfried , not sigurd, 
  do you have a map of fri ? 
  i would like to see it, 
  i personally hate tones , even pitch accent , so if i were you , i would n't put it in, 
  * ahem * it 's * byzantine * cross, 
  i love how you made austria-hungary have glasses . 
  they look really cool . 
  people usually just draw two eyepatches . 
  ah , true . 
  but is n't it funny how the most important serbian national symbols are just copied ? 
  the double-headed eagle and the cross from byzantium and also the tricolor from russia ( although most slavic countries copied the russian colors ), 
  have you considered using the simurgh symbol ? 
  you should make an album of this stuff , and also put the fri map in it . 
  true , but croatian tricolour has a reason to be red-white-blue , it was made by merging the flag of kingdom of croatia ( red-white ) and kingdom of slavonia ( blue-white ) . 
  i do n't know the history behind the serbian tricolour . 
  also , no need to downvote , i said nothing disagreeable , i even upvoted all your comments that contribute to the discussion . 
  that 's what downvote and upvote are for . 
  name one, 
  notice how i never referred to any \u010detnik symbols , because they are n't national symbols of serbs , the same goes for usta\u0161a symbols . 
  they represent a radical ideology that belongs in the past and in no way represent croats or serbs ( i would hope so ) . 
  it really is n't necessary to go there . 
  also , no need to downvote , i said nothing disagreeable , i even upvoted all your comments that contribute to the discussion ( so not your nazi comment ) . 
  that 's what downvote and upvote are for . 
  french sounds nothing like latin, 
  did you see this concept in a natural language or did you think of it yourself ? 
  slavic mythology . 
  i rarely see anyone ( who is n't a slav ) using it as inspiration . 
  a lot can be drawn from it because it 's european but different . 
  it 's quite strange and dark , too . 
  i mean , god of the underworld , veles , is also a god music and , by extension , magic . 
  also , he looks like satan and often shapeahifts into a snake . 
  just imagine witnessing a ritual of veles , it 's a misty morning , and you hear ominous ringing from far away . 
  then you see emerging from the mist deamon-like figures ( men dressed in furs , with animal heads and horns ) with bells strapped on them . 
  so cool . 
  not to mention an abundance of evil forest spirits , witches and undead . 
  bbcev sherlock i vikings od history channela, 
  course , for sure, 
  a proud citizen of hello internet , i see . 
  how did you get the names , they seem quite non-related to anything irl, 
  a few thoughts :, 
   it is based on the polynesian languages ( tokelauan in particular ), 
  why do you use the greek alphabet for a polinesian-inspired conlang ? 
  i do n't get this part . 
  do you use gamma to represent the glottal stop , which you romanise as g \u00b4 ? 
  and why does sigma or iota represent h ? 
  you can ( imo ) change the usage of a given letter a little bit ( hell , i do that with glagolitic alphabet ) , but not this much , unless / \u0279 / in your conlang evolved from / d / , for example . 
  you could use [ \u03dc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digamma ) , the greek letter digamma for / w / , as that was its original purpose . 
  when adapting an existing script to your conlang or making a romanisation for it , ** never ever use vowel letters for consonants or consonant letters for vowels ** , unless , as i previously said , you have a good historical reason for it ( but i suspect that in this case , you do n't ) . 
   would it be too much to have one symbol for every vowel , diphthong , and triphthong ? 
  well , i see nothing wrong with adapting the usage of diacritics to represent diphthongs , but you have to use the letters which make sense , not , for example , using < \u017e  for / oi / . 
  as for the triphthongs , i think it will be a bit more complicated to devise a way to write them down with one symbol , but i think it 's doable , although i do n't think it 's worth the hassle . 
  i think your main problem is sorting out the logical and natural usage of [ the alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_alphabet ) , and after you 're done with that , i think you 'll easily deal with the triphthongs . 
  i suggest posting a phoneme inventory in the ** small discussions thread ** , along with your proposed ( hopefully tweaked ) writing system , so that way , someone can help you devise a better one . 
  it 's kinda difficult giving advice when i do n't know what phonemes your language has , or what kind of orthography you 're going for . 
  also , i suggest reading up a little bit on [ the alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_alphabet ) and looking through various orthographies posted on this subreddit . 
  i think the discussion flair is appropriate , although i think you should 've posted this as a question to the small discussions thread , not as a full post . 
  that 's the thing , they created a new script by adapting an existing one . 
  op did n't do that , they are just using an existing script in a weird way . 
  it 's like there 's a language that uses latin alphabet , but for / ae / uses < \u017e  , for / oi / uses < q  , and for / g / uses < o  . 
  it just does n't make sense . 
  if , on the other hand , there happens to be a language family that does n't have an adequate script to represent their language , so they adapted the greek alphabet and made a new script . 
  surprise , that 's [ cyrillic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyrillic_script ) . 
  do you see the difference ? 
  edit : i do n't mean to come of as hostile , i was just a little bit pissed of today . 
  is there a graph like this for secular talk ? 
  ok thanks, 
  i was always confused by the ancient skyrim history , the dragon war and the return in particular . 
  i wonder if there is a culture where the ` scientific ' language is more logical and mathematical then the ` common ' speech and in contrast with the ecclesiastical speech which would be older , rich with metaphors and highly irregular . 
  that could be a cool idea for a conculture .

  manchukuo empire, 
  sorry for the extremely late comment , but take a look at [ this ] ( http://www.omniglot.com/writing/gyorsrovas.htm ) , it 's a modernised version of the old hungarian script . 
  the second one , definitely .
