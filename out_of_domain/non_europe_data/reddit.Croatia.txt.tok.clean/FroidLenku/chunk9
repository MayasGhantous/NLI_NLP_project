  but that 's mostly because i 'm shit at writing and ca n't make up a good story arc and interesting characters . 
  i do like history , linguistics and politics , though, 
  did you write `` spqr '' on that statue intentionally or by mistake ? 
  oh , it was rome ? 
  i just assumed it was ancient greece because the comic was about greece . 
  i use the [ glagolitic ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagoljica#/media/file:vergleich_glagolitische_schrift.jpg ) alphabet , albeit modified . 
  it says :, 
  it does , does n't it ? 
  it 's a shame so few people ( outside croatia ) even know about it , and even fewer people use it . 
  finally someone acknowledging the existence of glagolitic !, 
  edit :, 
  also , it reminded you of the ethiopic syllabary because it was likely inspired by it . 
  the script you refer to as `` old church slavonic '' is actually [ old cyrillic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_cyrillic_alphabet ) alphabet and it was constructed to write slavic languages , [ old curch slavonic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_church_slavonic ) in particular . 
  glagolitic was created to write ocs before that , by two greek missionaries , [ st. cyril and st. methodius ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saints_cyril_and_methodius ) . 
  cyrillic was probably designed by one of st. cyril 's students , clement of ohrid . 
  i made a [ cursive version ] ( http://imgur.com/a/sdumz ) of glagolitic , and your script looks quite similar to it !, 
   do n't exceed four sentences . 
  f * ck the police, 
   montreal / hello internet, 
  we really * nailed * the design , too, 
  likkinja, 
  thank you for that, 
  note , the byzantine chroniclers translated \u017eupan as iupannus, 
  [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/2wf6yblqshs ) perhaps, 
  was n't it called kerrodish ?

  on my birthday !, 
  are you talking about the real finns ? 
  because the serbian coat of arms is heavily inspired by the byzantine banner in the picture, 
  * flag of polan, 
  `` oh poor me , girls use me for sex '', 
  eh , more like nawa\u0361t\u026c, 
  did he ? 
  i must have misheard . 
  wow , i can imagine a sprawling , neo-gothic and industrial city , brimming with undead and haunted graveyards and cathedrals , with the sky being perpetually grey . 
  you 've started my imagination , too bad i ca n't draw . 
  what gods , are some europeans not christian in your setting ? 
  edit : nvm , just looked at the original comment and noticed pre-christian european pagan religions . 
  no , that 's kolovrat , a symbol from slavic paganism , usually thought to represent the sun, 
  that 's the us, 
  spanish ai n't got nothin on croatian, 
  that 's the word i was missing , steampunk, 
  btw , croatian is n't written in cyrillic , that 's basically like having poland `` say '' things in cyrillic . 
  but , that aside , a cool comic, 
  there is n't really a heated debate on the characters , croatian is written only in latin alphabet and nobody is trying to change that , but there is a problem regarding recognising minority language rights for serbs ( whose language is written in cyrillic ) in areas that experienced war crimes by serbs during the nineties ( notably , city of vukovar ) . 
  the standard varieties are , but that has kinda been forced ( particularly on croatian ) because standard croatian , serbian , bosniak and montenegrin are all based on neoshtokavian dialect . 
  when the standard for croatian language was being created in the 19 . century , the side that wanted unity with the rest of the south slavs eventually won .

  my world is n't really fleshed out , but depending on the time in history , the region in the world , or how lovecraftian i 'm feeling , it fluctuates between noble dark , true neutral and grim bright . 
  take a look at [ klaekson-zaen ] ( http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/klaekson-zaen.htm ) , it should inspire you because it has similar shapes to what you 're aiming for . 
  will there be a recording of your live show ? 
  i 'd like to see it . 
  or , at least , is there a recording of your ted-talk ? 
  what sounds do the letters represent , i 'm not sure . 
  ( for example j , ch , ee , ... ), 
  if you do n't speak serbian , croatian , bosnian or montenegrin , i asked if your world is supposed to be taken seriously, 
  svemo\u0107nibi sounds ridiculous , like almightybee . 
  btw , the name of your world , `` mojvelsvijet '' , what does it mean ? 
  moj means my , svijet means world , but what does ` vel ' mean ? 
  could it be a part of the word ` veli ' or ` veliki ' meaning great ? 
  ok cool , but you shoud put the ipa on your posts ( if you know it ) , just so people are n't confused . 
  also , no need to spell out the name of the sound , just do this : / x / , or this : [ x ] , where ` x ' is the ipa symbol of the sound in question . 
  in my own conlang , old niveni , the greeting goes like this :,

  what can trigger ablaut and how can it manifest ? 
  note : other than indo-european ablaut , i know about that one, 
  edit : za one sporijeg uma , pi\u0161e \u0161ampioni, 
  thank you , i 've read the ccc post a long time ago , but i was wondering how can ablaut actually occur , what causes the vowel alternation , and can it occur in different ways than it does in pie . 
  edit : also , is n't your example umlaut ? 
  is there a thing on the internet where you wrote stuff down about hoa in a structured manner , other than reddit ? 
  i 'd like to get into it .

  did you count serbian , croatian , bosnian and montenegrin as separate languages ? 
  as you can tell from my flair , my native language is ** croatian ** , i 'm fluent in ** english ** , i studied ** german ** for 12 years in school , but i 'm not fluent in it , i studied ** spanish ** on duolingo and i can hold a very basic conversation in it and , finally , i studied ** latin ** in school for two years and have some basic understanding of it . 
  do you have any documentation of fit , it sounds interesting , i 'd like to check it out, 
  good sir , have some karma !, 
  or russian and american , which seems more appropriate these times / s, 
  links are broken, 
  the name tomislav likely comes from `` dominslav '' or dominus slavus , meaning `` slavic ruler '' in latin . 
  so it is kinda like that , except it is n't cause it 's not tommy but master . 
  tommy slav - johnny chinese, 
  what .

  edit : pun not intended, 
  umm , i 'll just leave here the ( real ) official grand title of franz joseph i.
