i do n't even, 
   and the etruscan culture would simply disappear, 
  more like greatly infuse itself with roman . 
  a lot of roman kings were etruscan too . 
  where can i learn more about the jews and jewish history ? 
  i know next to nothing except that short touching point of judaism and christianity . 
  me too . 
  have read the book , no idea which event is being discussed here exactly . 
  the privy incident seems to be the most likely candidate - but please pm me as well . 
  are you fucking kiddi -, 
   rprevolution, 
  yeah yeah whatever , please do go on, 
   cat stayed dead . 
  well fuck, 
   this was n't a murder , just a rape . 
  that leaves open the possibility that it was consensual . 
  holy shit what the fuck is this, 
  i like it when people like you just talk out of their ass . 
  so pretty much any developed country is living under a terrible , gun-pointing , communist regime by you ? 
  i like it how ideologies basically melt your brain away faster than drugs . 
  when people use the word `` communist '' i ca n't tell if they 're joking or serious anymore . 
  rights only exist because they are enforced by the government . 
  if you think that paying taxes so you can have basic things such as firefighters , a police force , maybe even free healthcare and education ( * gasp * evil communist ! ), 
  - then please pack your things and get the fuck out . 
   i literally have no idea what basic income is and i came here just to spout my simplistic ideology-inspired opinions !, 
  * fuck * getting informed about things !, 
  communist-marxist fucks , you 'll never defeat me !, 
  where have you been ? 
  fiscal conservatism is pretty much the most popular ideology on the internet . 
  people here have always been economically-right and socially liberal . 
  please do n't label everyone `` right wing '' like it 's a bad word . 
  aside from that one guy most likely from some `` white rights '' sub , pretty much everyone here is `` left '' when it comes to social issues . 
  it seems like you are american . 
  please read up on what [ communism ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism ) actually means . 
  i 'm tired of people using it in debates which have nothing to do with it . 
  would you object to firefighters trying to keep your house from burning down ? 
  because , you know , according to your ideology , what happened is that the evil communist state went from citizen from citizen and violently robbed them at gunpoint . 
  which is obviously ** not ** what happened , so in the meantime you could also stop using this pathetic rhetoric . 
  we have enough ideologues already , * thank you . 
  it is factually not communist . 
  like , at all , you do n't know what that word means . 
  i see no violence there . 
  it 's not violent . 
   if you want to implement this , then you ca n't be mad at people who do n't want to work , yet want free food , housing , clothing , medical care . 
  yeeeah , no . 
  unless you 've got some proof ? 
  wow , things have to come from somewhere , you say ? 
  brilliant observation ? 
  if you do n't agree with that , do n't be a part of society . 
  nah , you 're just uninformed . 
  here , did the work for you , read up : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism . 
  most countries implement what he was saying and work just fine . 
  nah , you 're just uninformed . 
  here , did the work for you , read up : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism .

   extreme left, 
  you mean college undergrads sipping some hip coffee brand while reading marx on the mac books ? 
  yeah , * so fucking extreme and violent , man . 
   an alf raid removing 82 beagles and 26 rabbits from interfauna in cambridge on st patrick 's night 1990 . 
  aw ** shit ** we 've got some badasses over here . 
  they 're so cute with their masks and all !, 
  pretty much yeah, 
  not american here . 
  i do n't understand how universal healthcare can be attributed to a single president . 
  what happens when obama leaves , and a republican is elected into office ? 
  can he just fuck the system up ? 
  in my country universal healthcare has been pretty much the same - free everything for everyone - for the last like 50 years . 
  it 's not even an issue , nor part of any public debate , it just is , and every government appoints its minister of healthcare and things just slowly improve over time ... 
  but in the usa , i do n't get how you are getting this only now , and you 're a more advanced country than we are , and how this will work if it 's such a big deal for some reason ( ??? 
   `` contains gmos '', 
  if you 're gon na get into political activism you should also have even basic scientific literacy . 
  sorry , enumerating instances of gmos being handled badly , does not prove they are inherently harmful themselves . 
  they 've provided food for * billions * of people and saved countless lives too . 
  they 're a * technology * . 
  they need to be regulated and studied , for sure , and exploited for maximum gain for the society ( i definitely do n't agree with `` closed source '' food , i want my genes open sourced ! ), 
  - but the whole campaign that a lot of leftists cling to is simply ridiculous and irrational . 
  as far as guns go , i agree with you . 
  fuck guns . 
  however in my country they 're not even a problem . 
  in america , apparently , everybody has guns , so it 's a slight issue when it comes to regulation . 
  yeah , america does do some questionable things . 
  but that has nothing to do with the idea of taxes . 
  for example my country has n't waged a single war in many years but it has free healthcare , free education for good students ( easy to get in all colleges ) , etc etc. 
  also i did not downvote you , just did n't reply until now . 
  you do n't have to be so upset about your internet points though no one really cares . 
   maybe one day our `` more advanced '' country will reach the level of healthcare your country enjoys today . 
  haha i wish you luck . 
  i read somewhere about a guy that got two of his fingers cut off * and he had to choose which one he wanted to keep . 
  * that sounds horrible . 
  still though , i 'd live in the us if i could , i love that country even for all its drawbacks . 
  actually why do n't you continue reading a little while longer ? 
  marx did talk about 8-8-8 , and many communists were probably for leisure time , although this is not quite the central point of most thinkers . 
  what, 
  if that 's your thing sure , maybe you 'll be able to contribute to their society more than you would in this debate . 
  this is not about disagreeing with a single point nor a specific government . 
  this is about the idea of taxes . 
  nice try , though . 
  rights are not inherently good . 
  i * want * your rights limited . 
  such as the right to kill me , for instance .
