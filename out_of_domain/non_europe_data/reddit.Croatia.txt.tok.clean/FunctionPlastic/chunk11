  i only see hyper-anti-feminism . 
  only answers once per parent comment i believe , just so you know you have n't fucked up the syntax, 
  856 days `` this probably wo n't work '', 
  maybe we do n't go to the same sites , but speaking about reddit , anti-feminism , hostility to women , and stories only from the male perspective are pretty much a norm ( except of course on minor , dedicated subs ) . 
  what we can also learn from history is that authority is a constant present on most levels of civilization ( i 'm saying that in order to exclude hunter-gatherer or similar primitive societies which might 've not had authority of this kind ) . 
  i 'd say a functioning , freedom protecting * anarchy * is a much less likely utopia . 
  compromise is important , a democracy is never complete , but it can always get better - or worse , depends on people . 
  is this the `` feminist oppression '' myth ? 
  what 's next , the reddit-secretly-ran-by-srs conspiracy ? 
  reddit 's male majority loves bashing feminism . 
  oh and just a couple of days ago we had statistically meaningless opinion survey boosted to the front page - masked as a real study that proved women to be the true oppressors of everything . 
  it would 've been funny if it was n't sad . 
  there are even popular subs devoted to mentally molesting women ( trp ) - thankfully these are usually shunned upon by the wider audience . 
  thanks for exemplifying my point, 
  so you deny that trp is involved in any sort of abuse of females ? 
  they 're just there to share dating tips ? 
  ah the tumblr bogeyman, 
   let 's repost this single site over and over as if it proved our point, 
  exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  i 'm a man . 
  and yes , just for mentioning that reddit might not be the bastion of objectivity it likes to imagine - i 've received a half a dozen insults in my inbox and bitter replies here . 
  not that i care - it just proves my point . 
  especially your post . 
   how all men are evil bastards, 
  no , you 've not , because that 's not feminism . 
   trp, 
  which is an actual fucking problem because they promote abuse of females and are quite a big sub . 
  simply its existence proves my point - reddit is not the bastion of objectivity it claims to be and only provides the male perspective to issues . 
  no it 's really not , almost all kids that are n't busy starving or fighting in a war can do it a before they 're 8 . 
  besides being able to make a hello world program is n't that useful - and bad programmers are quite detrimental . 
  i 'm gon na stick to my plan of investing in people with potential more ( i guarantee you we 're failing them ) - and just giving others an equal opportunity . 
  programming is just a part of ict education though - other parts definitely need to improve because people actually do need to know them and will use them . 
  i 'd much rather my collogues know how to fix basic issues , the basics of computer and hardware maintenance , installing and using other operating systems - than program . 
  simply because programming is very specific and requires an immense investment to actually be useful - while other skills i mentioned are very practical , applicable and relevant . 
   for the majority of human history , society existed in a war-free, 
  yeah , no , if you read a history book you 'll see people ate genocide for breakfast up until 50 years ago . 
  besides - define your terms . 
  what societies are we looking at , exactly ? 
  because i do n't consider anything before a writing system that relevant . 
  i hope you can see that african tribes are a bit pointless topic when discussing modern society . 
   anarchism has worked , can work , and will work . 
  where and when has it worked ? 
   coercive hierarchy should be opposed , not propped up as freedom . 
  you 're making it sound like we live in an ant colony . 
  we do n't . 
  you 're freer now than ever before . 
  the path to freedom is through technology and science ( consequently , the economy ) - not politics . 
  with sufficient levels of automation it will all become irrelevant anyway . 
  they did n't just collect data at one point and then stopped . 
  they 're continually collecting data and analyzing it . 
  and the fact is that if you use linux , you will be a narrower target , up for ** more ** violation of your rights . 
  bogeyman is a misrepresentation used to coerce people into your own agenda , in this case the `` feminists hate men ! '', 
  rhetoric that is so prevalent on reddit . 
   the shit they do is essentially what alot of women do to men, 
  ah , i knew it , females are out there to get us , you 've got to organize maaan . 
   please , reply on how i am a misogynistic piece of shit and that i deserve to be lit on fire . 
  besides this discussion is offtopic, 
   my guess is the entire `` charity '' is a small group of extremist crackpots running out of someone 's basement . 
  god damn marine biologists !, 
  always up to something !, 
  dumping bodies in creeks sounds like a very unintelligent thing to do . 
  ~ ~ i 'm pretty sure burying is a sanitary practice ~ ~ ( [ i was wrong ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/29w5uc/the_oldest_confirmed_case_of_downs_syndrome_has/cip54zh ) ) - but there are many ways to bury someone ( like with valuable possessions as opposed to an anonymous mass grave ) . 
  so can you elaborate or provide a source ? 
  what the fuck are you even talking about, 
  pretty much everyone brings up tumblr . 
  it sure is a dear bogeyman to you . 
  honestly i 'm completely certain you do n't need germ theory . 
  you need a nose and a brain that can process cause and effect relationships . 
  but then again , the plague happened ( many times ) . 
  tumblr is a permanent porn site in my mind , i do n't browse it for other reasons , and for that usually only when i 'm linked to something good . 
  i only ever hear about it in the context of porn and `` extreme feminism '' - which has become quite annoying when used as an actual argument ( literally every post in this thread ) . 
  it 's become a boogeyman used to coerce others by association to a site that ( i presume ) is just as awful as they make it to be ( main demographic are clueless american teenagers i read ) . 
  imagine if you 're discussing conservative economics and someone comes in completely uninformed claiming that you 're basically hitler . 
  that 's what i see any time feminism is mentioned on reddit or most other sites discussion sites i browse . 
  thanks for correcting me !, 
  please remove that !, 
  search engines ** punish duplicate content on different domains . 
  ** you 're greatly hurting their discoverability . 
  [bluehost.com ] ( http://www.bluehost.com/ ) - website for roughly $ 5/mo . 
  they manage everything for you ( technical server details - you have the actual administration over the site of course ) . 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
   you may consider them irrelevant , but it does prove that humans can exist without genocide , hierarchy , etc. 
  those things are n't inherent in our nature . 
  the only thing it proves is that we were once primitive . 
  it 's ** completely ** irrelevant because the society was fundamentally different . 
  unless you 're advocating that we abandon absolutely all progress we 've ever made except basic tools - i do n't see your point . 
  and if that 's your point , well , i do n't agree with it , because i kind of like the whole food and not dying as a kid thing . 
  i used to watch molyneux ' videos a while back , but i recently noticed that he appears to hate women and is particularly close to the whole red pill psychology . 
  i unsubbed after seeing that video where he interviewed a guy that walked around in a crowd with a loaded shotgun in washington and was whining about being arrested . 
  that video made me wary of even mentioning libertarianism in the public . 
  what 's up with communists and trees ? 
  ban the trees !, 
   the invisible hand of the market, 
  does n't this sound a little too close to magic ? 
  why would anyone use it in a discussion with people who do n't agree with you ? 
  who ? 
   proof of your claims here, 
  mostly from the videos about single moms . 
  oh so you hate women as well ? 
  and like abuse ?
