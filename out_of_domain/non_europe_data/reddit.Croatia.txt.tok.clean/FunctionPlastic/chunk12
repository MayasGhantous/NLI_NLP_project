   are you , like , new here ? 
  evidently, 
  that 's nice ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i was literally shitting when writing that , sorry but i could n't afford your comment quite the attention it deserved , i kind of supposed you 'd be able to connect sequences of characters with their meanings . 
  if that 's a classic you might want to reconsider the source of the problem . 
  besides i did not disagree with anything . 
  i simply stated a fact that you did not dispute . 
  the question - `` so ? '', 
  - would suggest you see no issue in trp . 
  which means that you support mental abuse of women , since that 's what the sub is about . 
  and i have absolutely no interest in arguing about trp itself with you ( or anything else for that matter , unless you want to get back on topic ) - the question is all i needed to draw my conclusions . 
  wow i was * just * researching this topic myself !, 
  the wikipedia article is pretty much useless because to understand it you need to already know all the theory and more ... 
  yeah , white people totally did n't colonize africa or commit genocide there or anything !, 
  genocide is for black people we 're more interested in culture and art !, 
  but white people are cultured , efficient angels who are being oppressed by the blacks , * ca n't you see ? 
  edit : shit , forgot my / s, 
  holy shit ants are * amazing * . 
  i 've loved them since i watched an epic fight between them and a giant hurt moth . 
  he kept flailing at them and they had actual * strategy * . 
  how do ants learn these behaviors ? 
  is it `` evolutionary '' learning where they have the information in genes , or do they live long enough to develop a `` culture '' and have other ants just imitate those who have already learned a specific behavior ? 
  the only thing that sub wants to hear about these days is feminism and how women are ruining everything . 
  whot, 
  i use [ pc assembly language ] ( http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/ ) by paul a. carter as my go to book on the subject, 
  [ we give you , both sides !, 
  ] ( http://youtu.be/sgarqof0tpq ), 
   now we know that those fat is bad scientists were wrong for decades, 
  we do n't . 
  exercise is good for you . 
  butter sticks are n't . 
  do you have some motherfucking sources ? 
  yeah , like they did with us flat earthers , or how i prefer to refer : sphere rationalists . 
  those lefty oppressors !, 
  no because despite the fact that i fucking love science loves to imply it , there is n't actually a lot of research to provide a definite answer about the long term health effect of various gmo products . 
  besides , most of the debate is about ** intellectual property ** , and not health effects . 
  the people who are claiming gmos are unhealthy are just as full of shit as those that are claiming they 're not . 
  oh you mean scientists ? 
   so-called `` deniers '', 
  oh you mean paid corporate shills ? 
   even in the face of ( reliable , mind you ) conflicting evidence, 
  right lets see those sources . 
   china is going to carry on polluting no matter what we do, 
  buddy i have news for you . 
  china is turning around , due to their ability to actually decide and carry out . 
  scientific theories are not tested on public tv . 
  the only purpose of tv is to inform the public , * not * to misguide it . 
  if you have evidence that 99 % of the expert community is wrong , you 're free and welcomed to show it . 
  *** that 's *** scientific debate . 
  not corporate shills lying to people in order to influence their votes and opinion . 
  thanks for posting it , now i 'll use your comment in future as an example of how far-right lunatics are a dangerous bunch . 
  i do n't see them banning policy debates , just misinformation and unscientific corporate shilling . 
  this word does n't mean what you think it means . 
  huh , my bad , not a native speaker . 
  in my language those are totally different words . 
  i personally believe that most current gm food does not pose a significant hazard , but to conclude that it 's completely ok to ban the discussion on tv , ** or to even draw a clear conclusion about the actual health benefits ** at this point , would be crazy . 
  the technology has been changing rapidly and continues to change . 
  10 years worth of studies in not enough for a conclusion to such an important question - and definitely not enough for banning its discussion on tv . 
  at least in europe there has not been a single generation that has been eating gm food throughout the majority of their lives , and the effects might manifest over multiple generations anyway . 
  again i do not believe this to be a primary concern , but it simply can not be discarded . 
  i was replying to / u/c4ptainmorgan and his hivemind mentality that refuses to accept that the actual problems with gmos have ** nothing to do with health effects ** - this is the strawman built up by the ifls community and the like , who even go on to say that selective breading falls into the same category and thus anyone who opposes monsanto 's tactics is a lunatic and enemy of science ( even though most of them are there for the black science man memes , which is fine but qualifies you for nothing ) . 
  the actual issues are about intellectual property , preserving local farmers , and more complicated issues that are usually very specific to different eu regions . 
  if someone ca n't comprehend why i might want to suggest on tv , that it might not be the best idea for a us corporation to have complete control over the closed genetic information that conditions the food which we all eat - then that person is obviously malicious to me and every other eu citizen . 
  it 's per se , by the way , from latin . 
  tl ; dr jews bad palestinians good, 
  your simplifications are not helping the situation . 
   accurate description of the conflict, 
  yeah , totally unbiased . 
  whew , after all these years it comes down to `` jews = bad , palestinians = good '' !, 
  who would 've guessed !, 
  mentally replacing `` jews '' with `` the jews '' makes these posts so much more entertaining, 
  hey i remember you guys from civ, 
  you 're might not be an antisemite , but you 're definitely simplifying the situation . 
  and you definitely not helping the people of paelstine , who also suffer from this . 
  the fact of the matter is that there is no two entities named `` the jews '' fighting the `` palestinians '' : there are many institutions , groupations , and organizations that are interacting on all sides of the conflicts . 
  the israeli government and military are not in a holy war against the poor palestinian people who they are oppressing , they 're juggling attacks against jews , international pressure , possible escalation and war , communication with the institutions from other countries , internal safety , various operations , etc. 
  there are civilian casualties on both sides and there are crimes committed as well . 
  you 're doing a disservice to all of them by painting it in a black and white picture , you 're here to demonize one side , but peace is the only solution . 
  this is reddit , the site practically exists so people could anonymously post their unbased assumptions and wild theories . 
  wait a second , i thought you had to kill the original owner to inherit the ownership ? 
  hopefully you 're not referring to fox news as a positive intellectual influence here , since it 's comparable to violent indoctrination by rock to the head . 
  agreed . 
  i do n't see a party that puts god anywhere near public policy , surviving the 80s and 90s kids , at least not without core reforms . 
   well hopefully gcc will die too . 
  yeah that 's thankfully not gon na happen . 
  msvc sucks and should die , gcc is still the best compiler when it comes to multiplatform support , has excellent performance , and has many interesting technologies . 
  besides it 's gpl and unlike llvm ( could be wrong about their license ) can not just be taken by ms and closed as someone above suggested . 
  i do n't understand your point . 
  is some imaginary guy named `` the left '' out there to oppress you again ? 
  i agree , although i was n't trying to argue that . 
  i was arguing that gcc is still the most relevant compiler and no where near msvc if you 're judging which compilers should ` die ' . 
  or are you now talking about msvc again ? 
  honestly i do n't think it should die , i do n't really care about it either . 
  but you can we even call it an implementation of any standard these days ? 
  we can be secret agents together, 
  as men, 
   reddit , despite constantly being called `` left wing '', 
  basically this is done by people who are constantly complaining about `` liberal bias '' , `` social marxism '' , `` leftist oppression '' , ie . 
  fake victims of the right . 
  reddit is definitely more right wing ( excluding minor subs like this ) - except for the issue of marijuana ( which is great ) , and i often see a lot of support for gay rights , which is also great .
