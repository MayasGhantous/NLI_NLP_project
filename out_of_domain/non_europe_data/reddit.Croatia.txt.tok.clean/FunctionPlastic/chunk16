   minimum wage creates winners and losers , and the losers are always the lowest skilled and least educated . 
  do you have evidence to back this up ? 
  because i certainly have evidence to disprove it , oh how i love to invoke it : [ a nice collection ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2a1kg8/no_raising_the_minimum_wage_doesnt_lead_to/ciqm4i5 ) . 
   there 's a liberal equivalent, 
  it 's rationalwiki . 
  and it usually is quite rational , unlike conservapedia . 
  seriously , go there , they actually respect science and logic . 
  ( but never use it as a source or anything , it 's merely educational/satirical/political . 
  definitely ** biased ** , but not insane . ), 
  of course there 's an agenda being pushed , that 's the point of the site , it even says so on their front page i think . 
  they do n't claim to be unbiased . 
  just like pretty much any post here , and a lot of political books . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
  unlike conservapedia though , they 're do n't deny science and make shit up . 
  i want 1 . answered ... 
  they did n't misspell anything , how will she know to put it on social media ? 
  usually these countries are very antagonistic to the west - the us specifically , which israel seems to have strong ties with . 
  but my country is in nato and eu , so we have strong ties as well , and do n't really care about china either - so i can understand . 
  what is weird ? 
  i 'm from croatia ( got into eu last year , in nato like 5 years ago ) . 
  your post makes absolutely no sense , you 've got yourself mixed up buddy, 
  go on then , present your peer reviewed papers by reputable individuals or academic institutions . 
  97 % of the climate science community agree that man-made climate change is incredibly damaging to the environment . 
  i agree , aside from some rare examples , it 's always an act of pr . 
  this just means that charity is a ridiculous alternative to taxation . 
  you post is non-sensical , i do n't understand `` baaa baaa baaa '' . 
  and of the links you 've provided - one is a blog that gets completely destroyed in the comment section by other scientists and provides nothing but baseless claims , and the other is the review paper i was citing . 
  ah , i thought you said that it 's weird we do n't really care for china . 
  i post on my country 's sub , so i ca n't really consider that private information . 
  sounds like you need a lawyer . 
  yes absolutely . 
  and did you talk to friends/family ? 
  great , make sure to get opinions from different people . 
  i wish you good luck !, 
  no , they are not . 
  those people really are neo-nazis . 
  most of the people who have those flags there are nazis . 
  i used to browse 4chan . 
  i sometimes went to pol . 
  not all of them are nazi , not even the majority . 
  if you deny that they are , you 're denying reality . 
  go there and see for yourself . 
  just like stormfront , right ? 
  [ i think you might be off by a billon , or forty . 
  ] ( http://thinkbynumbers.org/government-spending/corporate-welfare/corporate-welfare-statistics-vs-social-welfare-statistics/ ), 
  but yeah , fuck the poor , right ? 
  source engine = games, 
  linux = operating system for servers and neckbears operating those servers, 
  edit : yeah you neckbears keep denying it while i can smell your buritos, 
  except when you have to recompile just because you 've changed a setting . 
  also , do they detect and automatically mount my flash drives ? 
  what about providing useful features like universal search , various tools in a bar , and notifications ? 
  visual effects for window spreading and workspaces ? 
  what about searching for windows ? 
  when i have dozens of them open i can literally just mouse over a corner in unity , and start typing the program 's name . 
  graphical settings managers and all of that are also extremely useful when you do n't want to learn a custom language just for scripting your desktop . 
  when people say `` just works '' , they do n't mean `` it does n't crash '' , they mean that they provide enough features for the average user to be able to work normally without having to know shell commands , weird shortcuts, 
  i think he started using it around 3.8 when they had a lot of changes that improved usability . 
  i 'm not gon na argue workflows with you , it 's a simple fact that the statement `` terminal is easier anyway ! '', 
  is * exactly the opposite * of what people mean when they say `` just works '' . 
  that works for you , but not for a lot of others . 
   visual effects ? 
  like eye-candy ? 
  pointless , and do n't want it . 
  visual effect are the wrong term , i meant features like window spread . 
  that 's an overview both unity and gnome have , where you can see all of your open windows , and just type to select them . 
  as i 've said incredibly useful for people who have loads of windows . 
  besides , visual layout can be great , for example , unity 's workspace switcher and they way it allows you to just drag windows around wherever you want them to be . 
  i 'm do n't know why you 're so bent on proving that tiling wms are suited for normal users , but i 'm not gon na participate further in that pointless exercise, 
   the logical conclusion of the move to more ` permissive ' licences -- one that permits everything . '', 
  what ? 
  posting code without a license ** means it 's copyrighted with all rights reserved . 
  you ca n't use some random code you find on github ** if it does n't explicitly say that you can , with a license . 
  the what ? 
  it 's kind of funny when people from the wealthiest country in the world try to explain how they do n't have money for things like education , healthcare , infrastructure , and fucking *** water *** . 
  meanwhile , you sure do have the money for your elites . 
  like how the federal government keeps going to war and pouring trillions into the private pockets of the 1 % , or how they keep bailing out the banks , or subsidizing various industries . 
  yeah , your elites have successfully convinced you that working in your interest is immoral , and you eat it up and ask for more . 
  thanks for the warning then, 
  excuse my ignorance , but why are n't they paying ? 
  we do n't have that problem here , and the water is not privatized . 
  works rather well . 
  although my country does in fact have some of the largest reserves of quality drinking water ... 
  you still pay for your water when it 's not privatized , it 's just that instead of going into someone 's pockets it goes into the infrastructure . 
  i think my country has had functioning water infrastructure in major cities for well over a millennia in fact . 
  it was the cities whole purpose back in the roman days . 
   gps before clinton would randomize your exact location within a few meters . 
  they still do that . 
  but if you have two receivers it 's easy to pinpoint . 
  i 'm not quoting the author , but glyn moody , who was quoted by the author . 
  i 'm from croatia that also had death camps for serbs and jews , i was n't alive back then , but my family was . 
  i really do n't want to tell you that you 're lying , but i know for fact that our people certainly did know about the ustashi crimes - and this pretty much enabled the antifascist sentiment . 
  hundreds of thousands of people , entire towns and villages , ** do n't just fucking disappear without anyone noticing . 
  especially because a large portion of the people killed were croats and christians who were against the regime . 
  you mean tsarist , russia never had capitalism . 
  you must 've been one ugly baby, 
  please , do n't give us any context or explain the situation , who 'd want that, 
  you mention him dying two times and then being fine , what the fuck ? 
  i 'm expressing my state of shock at the ignorance about licensing people still display . 
  right , that 's why they take money from the poor and give to the rich .
