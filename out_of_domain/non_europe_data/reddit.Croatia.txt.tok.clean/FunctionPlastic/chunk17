  they 're perfectly fine with spending ** trillions ** on war . 
  and there 's still idiots like you who make it all possible !, 
  fitting name . 
  why do americans still call it `` donors '' ? 
  call it what it is . 
  buyers . 
  owners . 
  any of those will do because they 're all equally valid . 
  no , not the cloud , stop using that marketing hype word . 
  it literally means `` unreliable , insecure servers we ca n't control '' . 
  what ? 
  oh hey it 's you guys , uh , want me to shi - i mean spread the good word of the merciful corporation a little , nudge nudge wink wink ? 
  excuse me i over reacted in general, 
  i 'm not sure what your point is . 
  for a hip startup , third party servers might be an acceptable solution . 
  but for anything this serious , not . 
  care to post an example ? 
  i see next to no support for israel . 
  my posts are often interpreted as pro-israel but they 're usually just calling out populism , one-sidedness , and simplification . 
  it 's literally started buddy , at [ mayday.us ] ( https://mayday.us ) . 
  compared to half life ( 1 or 2 ) , how good of a game is doom 3 ? 
  i really wanted to play it before because i idolized carmack , but never got around doing it and now i do n't quite game anymore . 
   are you really not seeing the glaring hole in that logic ? 
  for some reason , people seem to suck at detecting glaring holes in their logic when discussing this particular topic . 
  the daily mail literally supported hitler and mussolini . 
  not trying to make an argument here , just pointing it out as an interesting thing ( because nazis today would probably be against the muslims , not jews ) . 
  i do n't think you should be allowed to entice violence or genocide . 
  that 's not what freedom of speech is supposed to protect . 
  in europe , we 've learned from our mistakes , but it would seem that we are forgetting ... 
  if we ever invent a time machine , people like you should be made to live ( hah ) through the 90s balkans , so you would understand what genocide and hate lead to . 
  so you 're logically advocating the same thing now . 
  the worst problem for the linux desktop is lack of hardware support . 
  i bought a mid-range ati card that 's been out for a few years most likely ( hd7790 ) and it did n't fucking work . 
  imagine how bad you feel when your 8-core , 16 gigs of ram , relatively good gpu pc you just assembled works slower than a 10 year old pre-built . 
  ran windows on it for almost a year and i was so happy when it finally became usable on linux . 
  the x problem is the second most important one , thankfully it 's practically fixed already . 
  i do n't see how kde/gnome is anything but healthy competition and choices . 
   btw did i express prejudice or merely point out a black american cultural norm ? 
  oh so you 're basically as racist as the op . 
   ... is it racist of me to say that the vast majority of our shoplifters are african american ? 
  yes if you try to generalize it or conclude anything from your anecdote . 
  because research shows that they 're not . 
  so a ` culturist ' is someone who is a racist but lacks the spine to admit it ? 
  learned a new word today . 
  do n't try that at home . 
   any argument from a capitalist perspective , that government ca n't innovate fast enough or manage properly, 
  i never got this fucking argument . 
  the us government ** gave ** us the fucking internet . 
  a european public research facility gave us the web . 
  ** publicly funded science ** is what gives us most of our fucking inventions in the first place . 
  i do n't want a shinier apple device * because that 's not innovation , that 's a corporate lie * - they 're all to scared to actually innovate . 
  but they sure are n't scared to be the largest propaganda machine in history . 
  nasa gave us silicon valley and do much more , and the republicans hate it because gibmint baaad !, 
  well , frankly , it 's not bad at all , when you compare it to the private sector . 
   and it 's government legislation which set up a system where only 1 company gets to operate in a given area in the first place !, 
  ok tell us which pieces of legislation . 
  exactly . 
  actually governments maintain sovereignty and control inflation through taxation , so i do n't see your point . 
  and through externalities , corporations do spend our money . 
  oh and child slavery is also very popular in those corporate circles . 
  and fraud , in the financial ones . 
  the cognitive dissonance is strong in this one . 
  except government funded research * created * the internet . 
  the nsa is not the entire government . 
  also , they can much more easily get the data from unaccountable private corporations like microsoft , than they could from the local government . 
  yeah , we need more indirection , incompatibility , and bloat !, 
  on mobile and too busy to look it up , what does the ciphertext in the first few words say ? 
  ( it 's italicized , that 's what he was hinting at right ? ), 
  if competition is good , then the local governments should be allowed to compete . 
  dude hold that anus together it looks close to bursting !, 
  and they get it from isps unconditionally now . 
  it would be much harder to orchestrate that on the local level , so it would be done at other points anyway . 
  and if that offers a better service because private pockets do n't need to be filled ... sign me up !, 
  it works fine on linux , and on os x too i 'd wager . 
  it 's a windows problem , because it 's technologically behind for about two decades when it comes to installing software . 
  i do n't get it , why do n't republicans like aclu ? 
  what possible reason ? 
  your name fits your comment, 
  here in europe you can burn your flag and people will just assume you 're an artist/activist ... 
  but when our nationalism does get out of control it 's fucked up . 
  yeah well , grandparents do n't count when it comes to politics , or driving . 
  * oh wait , they 're all allowed to participate in ___ both ___ ... *, 
  holy fucking shit, 
  full respect, 
  please report back , possibly ping me as well by replying, 
  nah man , he was on a small island when during a murder rampage with 70 kids killed , pretty sure he never saw death in his life, 
  still do n't get it . 
  do you also hate eff for supporting freedom of speech ? 
  so they 're basically ... evil ? 
  yes , but they do work on others . 
  do they actively fight against the right to bear arms or ? 
  do you have a source for that ? 
  i find it hard to believe . 
  if there was a victim in the crime then they should not be defending them because of a technicality . 
  especially if it 's fucking rape . 
  yeah , i see now . 
  personally i find it hard to care for that , but i know it 's a controversial issue in the states . 
  however i 'm currently giving them the benefit of the doubt and considering they probably have some good reason , more elaborate than `` we do n't like guns '' . 
   . net will probably always run faster than mono . 
  [ uh , . net is slower , actually .
