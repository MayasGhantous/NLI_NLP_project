  which is obviously wrong since better systems exist . 
  see : europe . 
  the american government gave a shit enough to revolutionize the entire human civilization with nasa - something that the private sector could never have done . 
  because the profit was not seen as a direct consequence of the exploration , and came more as a reshaping of the world than concrete cash . 
  sure , you have silicon valley because of nasa , that 's a trillion dollar industry - but was it obvious that it would result from space exploration ? 
  obvious as in some billionaire would fund it all because of his profit motive ? 
  no privately owned corporation would ever fund the effort and ** give away the results , ie . 
  the scientific and technological discoveries ** , for everyone to use . 
  however - once the initial research and infrastructure has been laid down by government funding - maybe markets could take over , and truly bring space to everyone . 
  i ca n't tell obviously , i 'll have to wait and see . 
  it 's simply my opinion that it 's not the most efficient way to do it , nor a way that would benefit the public the most . 
  ok , i see , and i agree that whoever was responsible for the gun should 've been adequately punished . 
   the majority of americans do not want british/australian type of gun control , election results routinely prove this . 
  the minority of americans who do are free to move to those nations . 
  that 's circular logic - you 're stating that any decision arrived to democratically is the correct one because it was arrived to democratically . 
  i 'm *** obviously not *** contesting your sovereignty - i am questioning your current laws . 
   redbull is sharing their data from the record breaking space jump with nasa to develop better space suits . 
  i think you 're buying their propaganda ( marketing ) a bit too much . 
  sure red bull has shared their data . 
  meanwhile nasa developed [ some of the most important technologies ever ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nasa_spin-off_technologies ) . 
  not comparable in the slightest . 
   plenty of big corporations have very rich executives who want to develop the world for human kind . 
  if you think sociopaths are limited to private industry and not government , like i said , i have a bridge in arizona to sell you . 
  and i 'm not concerned with sociopaths or anything irregular at the moment - but the very way the systems are set up . 
  public agencies like nasa work for the benefit of all , with funding that does not directly depend on fiscal return on investment . 
   we can also get into philanthropy , which is private industry and better than anything the government could ever do for humanitarian aid . 
  i will consider your claim that philanthropy is `` better than anything government could ever do '' outrageously ridiculous , until you elaborate and provide sources . 
  no one gives a shit we can just send it to kosovo or some other shithole , nuclear power all the way !, 
  `` i know i 'll get down voted but '', 
  did you miss the '' / s '' ? 
  ( that means sarcasm . ), 
  [ for starters , you watch ads . 
  that 's pretty much enough . 
  i 'm not from the us . 
  i up voted , but i wo n't sign for obvious reasons . 
  because they 're all part of an evil social marxist conspiracy to rid the world of us respectable straight white christian males , obviously . 
  i see that all the time , what is it supposed to mean ? 
  what the actual fuck ? 
  ok i do n't think that this tweet was serious . 
  my friends post `` random '' bullshit that makes no sense all the time , it 's just humour . 
  this is absolutely ridiculous . 
  why are people willing to put up with these severe restrictions that serve literally no purpose ? 
  i can use programming languages on my android and could easily run desktop apps - because guess what it 's a full computer . 
  chinese make mangas ? 
  if this were a duel , now would be the point where i 'd say `` i yield ! '', 
  seems like i really was too uninformed to have this discussion . 
  however , my personal opinion is still that guns are too dangerous to be handed to those who explicitly do n't need them , and i would much prefer a society where they played a much lesser role . 
  and it definitely is possible , except maybe not in america where there are too many guns already so that it is difficult to enforce stricter laws . 
  they 're seriously great . 
  i got a c720 couple of weeks ago , and it took me like an hour to wipe chrome off of it , and install ubuntu . 
  now i 've got a $ 199 super-light laptop that is fully capable for all non-intensive work , for programming , email , etc. 
  also the battery life is * awesome . 
  [ check out the list of fixes for problems you might need to apply ( all straight-forward ) if you 'll get one . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/chrubuntu/comments/1rsxkd/list_of_fixes_for_xubuntu_1310_on_the_acer_c720/ ), 
  why are you posting in askreddit , and not some tech-related sub ? 
  that 's actually a common bacterial infection , vagina does not naturally smell like fish . 
  crouton and chrubuntu are worthless pieces of trash that make no sense unless you * absolutely must dual boot chrome . 
  * follow the link i provided if you want a proper way of installing ubuntu on it - the regular one , not a special derivative . 
  it 's not just a list of fixes , but a complete installation guide . 
  essentially you just install it like on any other normal laptop , by wiping all other partitions off and choosing the default overall options . 
  works fine - but make sure you have a usb mouse at hand because the default touchpad drivers need additional settings . 
  no pretty much the only thing you see is palestinian shilling . 
  almost every news headline is against israel . 
  were they a threat to you , or the system ? 
  as a citizen of a former communist state , i can definitely tell you that - no matter the amount of propaganda - the former system worked in my interest , and the current one does n't . 
  it works in the interest of capitalist elites . 
  that is a clich\u00e9 expression , but it 's true nonetheless . 
  what was once public property of us all has been handed over to about 200 rich families , who 've also ruined our industry . 
  what 's even more interesting that americans helped in all of this . 
  and you 've been told we were a threat to you . 
  the *** entire reason *** social media exists is ** advertising and corporate control . 
  jesus christ reddit is disgusting sometimes . 
  yes , their usefulness is derived from their ability to play nicely with chrome , my point is that if you want to go all the way linux , you can easily clone chrome to an usb and install ubuntu normally . 
  restoring it takes half an hour . 
  you really do n't want to run virtual machines on an underpowered laptop with 2gb ram and a mobile processor . 
  it takes up a couple of gb , i think a around 4 , out of 16 . 
  * dies internally *, 
  no like linux in the past two decades . 
  i do n't know how you 're even able to work without them . 
  unless you 're running a couple of windows , and even then , it gets too cluttered . 
  i have a terminal and ide on one , firefox on another with related windows , file management on a third , etc. 
  but ubuntu has so many more features like windows spread and searching for applications , it 's an entirely different workflow than on windows . 
   there 's a free lite version . 
  i never understood why people put up with this on windows . 
   hey here 's a pretty essential feature that 's somehow not first-party , but it 's closed source and you have to shell out cash for it !, 
  just like you had for the os , or even the ability to install more than a couple of programs !, 
  10 years old ? 
  it was available in the 80 . 
  it 's ** older than linux , or os x. 
  i do n't understand the difference . 
  if you do this you can cause huge material damage , destroy reputation , and practically ruin someone . 
  for the record , i absolutely support this leak , i 'm just not a moral absolutist . 
  wait but do n't you know that unions are basically satan ? 
  think of the billionaires !, 
  honestly that 's a bit of a too strong conviction . 
  i like unions and believe workers should have more power , but i do n't consider myself a socialist or a communist . 
  the ideas might 've originated together , but they do n't belong to the same idea anymore . 
  how did you end up on the complete opposite side of every political spectrum than your surrounding , if i may ask ? 
  were you not born there ? 
  but accessing confidential information can lead to theft of actual property , and enormous damages .
