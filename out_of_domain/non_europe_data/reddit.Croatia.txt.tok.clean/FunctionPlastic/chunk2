  it just happens that a ** lot ** of other people also want to take this right away from you , so we kind of came together and created a police force , to make sure you do n't attempt such a thing . 
  effectively , taking your right away . 
  of course , we 've also given you the freedom of speech : for example i ca n't imprison you because i disagree with you . 
  also , the government is there to protect you when someone attacks you for your religious beliefs or lack of thereof . 
  edit : to clarify , my original point was that the concept of a right * does n't even make sense * outside the context of a government . 
  ** of course ** you do n't have `` the right to kill me '' . 
  no such thing exists . 
   it does when it 's taxes that pay for those things . 
  obviously . 
  no that 's not how logic works . 
  just because taxes are misused in your opinion , does not make the general concept bad . 
   if my money is going to be stolen , i 'd rather it be used on helping people * ... * rather than bombing them . 
  it 's not stealing . 
  if you want to do business in my country , you have to pay your share to the society . 
  it 's a basic concept that has always existed and always will , equating it actually stealing property is ridiculous . 
   even though it will be used in the least efficient way possible, 
  wow another random unprovable conjecture that amounts to `` taxes bad ! '' . 
  yes . 
  were you trying to make a point ? 
  so you 're not joking ? 
  please take your own advice :, 
   ... which focuses on the establishment of classless and stateless societies ... 
  oh and this is a ** very ** incomplete and simplified definition . 
  if you want to actually engage in meaningful discourse in the future , i suggest you stop using words you do n't know the meaning of , and optionally inform yourself to actually realize why you were wrong ( quite a healthy thing to do ) . 
  i definitely support transparency and want to open source , common-good all the genes . 
  i was referring to the quote above circled in bright red , referring to some product . 
  i do n't think gmos are inherently bad and that should not be a reason to boycott anything . 
  i think the world ` liberal ' has lost all meaning . 
  what does it mean , exactly ? 
  here where i live liberals are for free markets , more akin to libertarians , but not crazy . 
  so obviously socialists do n't like them . 
  in america liberals are whoever you currently do n't agree with . 
  but my `` what '' was referring to the point of your comment . 
  what, 
  the existence of terrible regimes is not an argument against the idea of a state . 
  despite what you think , politics is not divided only into `` statists '' ( imaginary , meaningless word ) and `` people who are right , like me '' ( what are you even right about ? 
   makes sense , seeing as they do n't reproduce, 
  wow you sure had me until this point . 
  i was about to write you a nasty comment but i burst out of laughter when i read this . 
   a successful and happy society that tries to ensure happiness to as many people as possible . 
  how exactly is the right striving for that ? 
  seeing how they 're doing literally their best to sell our society to the ultra rich , make brown people not vote , disagree with women 's rights and oppose gay rights ? 
   maybe if the garbage man is living a shitty life , he should work harder and try to improve his situation . 
  i ca n't believe americans still buy this crap, 
  if you have a point then make it . 
   i , on the other hand , do . 
  what is your reasoning ? 
   our god given rights that exist with or without government, 
  out of the two concepts you mentioned above , god and government , which has the power to actually protect and limit your rights ? 
  the one which is not imaginary , of course . 
  natural rights are just as imaginary as god . 
  if not enforced , rights do n't exist . 
   you 're conflating `` society '' with `` government '' . 
  do n't do that . 
  unless you 're gon na assert that free healthcare and education do n't help the society , then i 'm not . 
  if you are , then you 'd be wrong . 
   it 's actually a fairly modern phenomenon . 
  as modern as ancient rome or greece ? 
  or pretty much any civilization with a monetary system ? 
   taking what belongs to me against my will is the definition of theft . 
  you enter a contract when you do business in some country . 
  the contract includes tax . 
  too bad . 
   feel free to read a few studies that compare the efficiency of funds spent on public works with those spent on private . 
  it 's an abysmal investment . 
  feel free to link them to me . 
  however i 'm pretty sure that it amounts to `` the rich get richer and the wealth trickles down !, 
  '' , not actually helpful to the rest of us . 
  how can you actually be misinformed enough as to assert that evolution will get rid of homosexuality because they do n't reproduce is above me . 
  but , better me trolled , than you misinformed , so let me this chance and clear things up for you . 
  homosexuality is a perfectly natural phenomenon . 
  it is not a disgrace to anything , including biology . 
  [ it is observed in countless species . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexual_behavior_in_animals ) also , homosexuals can reproduce , they just choose not to most of the time . 
  you also seem to not understand evolution nor the time scale at which it occurs . 
  do you believe homosexuality was created recently ? 
  the fact that we observe it in so many different species , suggests otherwise , and historical evidence traces it thousands of years back . 
  there are many hormonal processes that govern your sexuality , and the gene ( s ) could totally be carried over by heterosexual partners - but i do n't think we know exactly what causes homosexuality . 
  [ here 's a video that explains evolution thuogh . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghhojc4oxh8 ), 
  the part where you want to weed people out because of things that they did not choose and can not change suggests you have some issues , i 'm afraid i 'm not qualified to help you with those . 
  i can suggest you try and be more tolerant of others . 
  b-but they 're dirty commies !, 
  what kind of an educational system is that if you do n't end up at least half a million in debt after college ? 
  yeah , totally . 
  it 's so * obvious * that the blacks are holding us down . 
  no sir , it has nothing to do with the abysmally bad us education system , nor the innovative policies implemented in finland - the only solution is ** racism . 
  why ca n't the libtards understand our flawless logic ? 
  america for americans !, 
  smashing windows ? 
  *** throwing rocks ?!, 
  jesus christ it 's almost as if they were retarded kids !, 
  what will they do next , bomb an abortion clinic ? 
  kill 70 white kids in the name of white power ? 
  go on pogroms and kill roma kids ? 
  oh wait , they wont , extreme right already taking care of that . 
  they can continue *** planting trees in public to fight the evil corporations , maaan !, 
  *** , though . 
   you missed the whole part where i said `` if that 's what they 're into , have at it ... '' huh ? 
  expressing extreme disgust and hate for millions of people you have n't met is not what i meant by tolerance .
