  it could influence some completely different trait . 
  it may have no influence at all . 
  it might work differently for different people . 
  all i 'm saying is that we ca n't tell . 
  the study you cited does n't show the relationship between the amount of consumed pornography and behavioural change in real life situations . 
  to assume it exists would be unscientific . 
  i confused you with the dudette / dude i was originally talking to , but my reply is still legit . 
  there may be influence , there might be not , but you ca n't make any judgements until someone actually provides research on the subject . 
  all i 'm basically saying is that i have no idea how porn influences men . 
  if you do , i 'll be glad to listen . 
  all that i 'm saying is that this fact ( different parts of brain lighting up lighting up ) does not prove that porn makes men more likely to view women as objects . 
  you make an assumption that how men view women * in porn * influences how men view women * in real life * in a way to make them objectify women more . 
  with the evidence provided , there could be a thousand more possible variations . 
  maybe that part of the brain just naturally activate during sexual activity or arousal , maybe there simply is no connection , maybe it depends on the type of porn , maybe all of these things . 
  i really do n't even like most porn nor do i want to defend it , my point is that in science you ca n't make such assumptions . 
  of course , you might not have included the relevant part of the research in your posts , if that 's the case i 'd gladly be proven wrong . 
  yes , i agree it probably has a negative influence on him . 
  til it 's totally ok to drug someone up and use them . 
  til you can have sex without someone 's consent . 
  can you give some examples ? 
  you are discussing a nonsensical situation that has no basis in reality . 
  men and women are sentient beings capable of thinking for themselves . 
  if some men decided not to vote , as a lot of them already do , it would n't have any effect on women . 
  because democracy is not about gender . 
  the current laws are state-defined and both them and this list include `` made to penetrate '' . 
  a victim is defined as a person who did not * consent * , ** not ** as the one who was penetrated . 
  the penetration is simply used to define the * act * , which make sense , not to define the victim , which can be on both sides . 
  sorry to break your circlejerk , do carry on . 
  you ca n't opt out of rights . 
  you are a thick one are n't you, 
  if you want to learn git , and generally continue programming , i 'd strongly recommend installing a * nix based os , mac or any linux ( ubuntu is fine ) . 
  there is a program for windows , but it does all the work for you . 
  it will not teach you how to use git in any other situation , nor even how it works - but most importantly you wo n't learn how it interacts with other programs like ssh , grep , and other * nix utils . 
  as for other things , you 'll find that programming is generally much easier . 
  want to install java ? 
  just apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk . 
  same goes for other tools like editors , git , etc. 
  this is even more true for other languages/fws that do n't require comprehensive ides that solve everything - like python , c , node.js ( last i checked it worked horribly and did n't have npm on windows , but it 's been a long time ) . 
  and not to even mention tools like valgrind , various compilers , editors , and the whole dev-tailored design , that make * nix a great choice for developers . 
  you can easily dual-boot , the ubuntu installer offers that option . 
  just give it like 10gb and that 's it . 
   i consider the move away from `` faster '' languages to `` more correct '' languages an enduring blessing of my career . 
  performance and safety are not mutually exclusive qualities , though . 
  a lot of newer c++ design decisions are actually made to move away from the c style of programming - because that is the true source of many bugs people are complaining about . 
  it 's entirely possible to have language constructs that are inexpensive and safe !, 
  using vectors and safe pointers will solve most of the nastiest bugs and vulnerabilities that creep up ** constantly ** in c and old c++ - and they incur no significant cost unless you 're developing a hard real time system that runs on toaster hardware and is super-important . 
  i seriously doubt the android part , do you have a source to back it up ? 
  you have a sample bias though . 
  lots of open source projects choose c++ because it 's the effective lingua franca , you can simply expect to reach more potential contributors that way . 
  unless you 're writing a library for another language , c++ is a great choice just because of its ubiquity . 
  or was , at least , there 's lots going on . 
  this should be the top comment . 
  seriously c is a disaster . 
  the language encourages writing insecure and unsafe code . 
  it 's not the developers ' fault - it 's mostly c 's . 
  modern c++ is a much better choice when you need qualities of c ( performance , low level access ) , and want your application to be secure and safe . 
   basically irrational bases are not possible, 
  that 's not true at all . 
  jesus christ chill the fuck out, 
   sun would never have considered making the jvm so c++ - like . 
  could you expand on that ? 
  what do you mean by making the jvm `` so c++ - like '' ? 
  i think you 've got your terminology mixed up a bit . 
  these are n't pointers in the c sense , and lambdas are definitely * not * function pointers . 
  i agree with specialization though , and value types , ca n't wait for these things to arrive . 
  pretty sure the article is complaining about the same thing as you are . 
  everyone hates cops until they need one . 
  when i was in the states a couple of months ago , i tried bacon for the first time in my life . 
  i always though : `` ugh , those fat americans , overblowing everything '', 
  but holy christ it was so delicious i do n't know how you guys are not ** all ** fat blobs of bacon . 
  by printing money and taxation , the government is essentially redistributing wealth . 
  universal healthcare and free education are great ways of doing that because most people benefit from it . 
   china is constantly trying to fuck over foreign companies . 
  just like the us , russia , and anyone with power is / would . 
  oh you mean public ownership of the means of production ? 
  well , damn , then it ai n't socialism . 
   that depends . 
  many would argue that , because `` the government is us , '' and because it is funded by taxpayers all , that a government-run anything constitutes public ownership of that thing , and therefore socialism . 
  public ownership of * something * ** does n't ** constitute socialism , which is a socio-economic system in which the * means of production * - that is , industries , large companies , factories , etc , are owned and operated by the proletariat , i.e. 
  the working class . 
  this can be accomplished and designed in a variety of ways , via soviets , the state , other organisations , etc. 
  your definition would include absolutely everything so i do n't see why it has any merit , or i have misunderstood you . 
   i just called it socialism because the common vernacular seems to refer to government-run things add socialism , so , my apologies . 
  it 's not socialist , it 's just a frequent element of social democracies , which tend to be socialist-leaning , but are ** not ** the same thing . 
  yes , i 'm certain you 've just presented an unbiased view on a well-defined group of people . 
  that 's one of reddit 's favourite straw men . 
  `` feminists are irrational and want to ruin everything for hardworking stem students ! '', 
  feminists argue that it 's the patriarchy that 's the cause of [ the gender bias against hiring women in stem fields ] ( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/06/140623121000.htm ) , and not only the that , but the cause of a much bigger problem : society systematically discourages girls from entering engineering and science fields by constantly representing them as boys-only fields . 
  but sure , do n't let me interrupt the circlejerking . 
   in truth feminists are idiots, 
  yes i 'm sure of it , just like all other groups who dare to disagree with you . 
   look at these videos, 
  fuck your videos, 
  well i can see why he did n't mention jasenovac , he was listing the recent camps , after wwii . 
  what happened in gospic though ? 
   complains i 'm not mature enough, 
  also til feminists are nazis, 
  i think you have a twisted view of ` feminists ' . 
  sure , if you only read the example reddit loves to share when bashing feminism , you 'd think that they 're all man-hating, 
  but almost all feminists who are actually doing something from the cause and not just trolling on tumblr ( for example , running programs to get more girls into software development ) , are not .
