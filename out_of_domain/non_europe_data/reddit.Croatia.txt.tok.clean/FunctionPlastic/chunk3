  it 's a personal issue that i suggest you work on in order to become a better person . 
   i am entitled to my opinion , and i am of the opinion that it is disgusting and wrong . 
  so fucking what ? 
  i 'm entitled to telling you you 're being a huge asshole and calling you out on your bigotry , and so is the rest of the society , freedom goes both ways . 
   homosexual homo sapiens can not naturally reproduce , that is an undisputed fact . 
  no it is not , ** they are perfectly capable of reproduction . 
  ** sometimes , in regimes that oppress homosexual individuals , they were even forced to live heterosexual lives , including reproduction . 
  i live in a place that used to have such examples . 
  it 's truly horrible what hate and fear of others can lead you to . 
   does n't mean i 'm going to go light some gay guys house on fire or drag one behind my truck . 
  how nice of you !, 
   they think that having sex with women is gross im assuming . 
  or not ? 
  who knows ? 
  who cares ? 
  do you think that the gays hate you for liking women ? 
  do you think that they consider you disgusting and wrong ? 
  are you trying to defend yourself by hating them back ? 
  yeah pretty much . 
  might not be the worst but ruthless systematic extermination is definitely a top contender . 
  also not just the jews , but the gays , roma , and others . 
  i 've been programming on unix since i owned my first computer , but i still just try to search for examples and documentation in books or online ... 
  but i rarely do c ( unix ) development anyway so that 's understandable . 
  easily ? 
  10101010 + 01000000 sets the second bit to 1 and does n't touch others ... 
  you were referring to the fact that single bits can not be addressed but that is irrelevant - they 're still there and you can still manipulate them . 
  there 's quite a lot of informed people bashing ignoramuses itt . 
  i for one do not hold an irrational `` fear '' from nuclear power plants - i have a real concern - nuclear waste . 
  what about that ? 
  please educate me . 
  do we have ** sustainable ** methods of treating nuclear waste ? 
  something that wo n't render large portions of the environment unlivable practically forever ? 
  ( i would inform myself before being able to make any decision about nuclear power when it comes to the democratic process , or engaging in any public discourse , in case that makes you feel better . ), 
   you 're shitting on your own women 's rights . 
  i have a feeling these guys do n't quite value the same things as you or i do . 
  maybe it means that you have to form an actual argument instead of crying `` they be obresing muh free speech '' . 
  ** especially ** when it involves minority rights . 
  because that 's a very popular tactic of the real oppressors - they do n't have an actual argument and thus they only respond with crying about freedom of speech . 
  because who hates that , right ? 
  i do n't see why intolerance should be tolerated . 
  if you 're actively making my life worse , trying to diminish my rights , using hate speech to entice violence against people like me - you ** ca n't ** call me an asshole for disagreeing with you . 
   what do you mean people will call me out on being an asshole ? 
  no one is banning you . 
  when people complain about having to be tolerant , they 're complaining about the social consequences of being intolerant . 
  which are there with a reason . 
  if someone is a bigot , he * should * be treated accordingly . 
  hm your post still leaves me a bit hesitant ( although currently i 'd vote for nuclear over any other dirty energy sources like coal ) . 
  i really hope new tech arrives that makes nuclear waste handling a sustainable practice . 
   it cools for a number of years in a spent fuel pool , then goes into secure , sealed , storage casks for interim storage , and those casks sometimes go to a special storage facility, 
  i would * like * if that was happening . 
  but at the moment a lot of waste [ gets dumped into the third world ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toxic_waste_dumping_by_the_%27ndrangheta ) and that 's terrible . 
  no , i wo n't be ok with discrimination and intolerance . 
  if that hurts your feelings too much , i suggest you ** try being more tolerant . 
  i have literally no obligation to like you , agree with you , not tell you how you are wrong if you try to hurt me . 
  that 's not `` eye for an eye '' , that 's simple social dynamics . 
   the bolsheviks controlled all the production, 
  actually yes it was , and the quran is not evidence of real behavior . 
  there 's fucked up shit in the bible as well . 
  i do n't see the problem . 
  if they 're not contributing to the community , derailing threads , causing flamewars , they can gtfo in my opinion . 
   actually no it was n't, 
  nice evidence there . 
  i 'll definitely believe a guy with an obvious political agenda based on that alone !, 
  are you implying that semantic gymnastics is an actual argument ? 
  or that i should * like * people who try to hurt me ? 
  great logic there . 
  roma population should * thank * their local neo-nazis for murder and kidnapping of their family members !, 
  the gays should be all over homophobes - what , you do n't want to * insult * the poor fellas , do you ? 
  `` my statement is true until you prove it otherwise ! '', 
  nice try there . 
  are you religious maybe ? 
  also , again , quran is not the proof of anything . 
  the bible , quran , and most holy books are just ancient stories . 
  not dissertations on the social norms and practices of the time . 
  i do n't have `` my own '' since there is a universal one , and it definitely is n't `` someone i disagree with '' , especially when subject policies ** are already mostly implemented through social security . 
  try reading wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communism . 
   you are obviously very ignorant about islam . 
  says you , with no evidence . 
  still . 
  also nice way making sweeping generalizations about muslims . 
  i guess propaganda really does work : simply show the same picture of 20 angry muslims burning some flag as many times as possible and people will believe you . 
   i have posted a source . 
  you ? 
  nothing but claims . 
  no you 've posted an analysis of some literary works in the quran , which is ** not evidence . 
  in either case you have an political agenda , and you 're obviously not interested in debate . 
  do n't even bother replying if you have nothing constructive to add . 
  what is * yours ? 
  * that they reenact it annually ? 
  but yes , most muslims do n't follow the quran directly even today , and the islamic culture ** definitely ** has been a more tolerant one in the past . 
  they are responsible for quite a lot of our current knowledge of mathematics and greatly influenced european culture . 
  see [ this post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/22zg0d/did_mongols_cause_the_cultural_shift_from/cgs0had ) for further analysis of what caused the islamic culture to shift to more conservative waters . 
   so from `` quran is just ancient stories '' to something very different . 
  no , quran is still just ancient stories , always was , and always will be . 
  of great literary value nonetheless , it is not proof of anything . 
  i never disputed there were many muslims living by it . 
  also , you have n't even defined what that means . 
  do the reenact the stories ? 
  i could just as well post to stories of terribleness in the bible , say that it is the basis of christianity after which millions of christians live their lives , but that 's not proof of anything . 
   where 's the source for your claim ?
