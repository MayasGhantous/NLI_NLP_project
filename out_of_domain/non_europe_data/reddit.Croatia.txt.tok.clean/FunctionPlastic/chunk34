  damn you , concentration, 
  yes my mistake, 
  well i do n't think you can even connect the name to the character before he actually dies , can you ? 
  is it mentioned as early as the support group 's meeting ? 
  then i must 've forgotten . 
  anyways i would n't call him one of the main characters . 
  well do n't know what the flight club of yours is , or what you 're ** talking ** about , but i 've sure as hell downvoted you now . 
  ( besides i think that people consider bob a major character so basically you might want to edit out the name and the concrete details of that flight club so you do n't spoil it . ), 
  oh , yes , i totally agree with you . 
  but with oop being the primary paradigm in the industry , it 's not really that weird to see the meaning of the term ` abstraction ' shift towards such uses ( data abstraction instead of patterns ) . 
  i think that with the functional paradigm becoming more and more mainstream , the meaning will start shifting in the other direction again . 
  that sounds absolutely horrible . 
  european schools seem so much more relaxed haha , 
  here they let students manage all the systems . 
  at one point the entire infrastructure , from radio , physical servers , website , thin clients , os images - literally all school it , was being managed by a former student and a couple of us current students . 
  now there 's a company managing the website because the students who used to do it are not there anymore ( * slowly raises hand * ) , but if at any point someone wanted to do it , he 'd be given free reign . 
  sure , switching to another os would be quite a big deal , and they 'd probably would n't let us do it because microsoft 's in the official curriculum ( which is ** bullshit ** ) - but hey , it could be done . 
  true . 
  but at least in my country , they do n't give a fuck . 
  you should vote for yourself . 
  that means you believe yourself to be the best for the job . 
  if you did n't , get out . 
  if i was a politician , i 'd say proudly they i voted for myself because * that 's * voting for the american people . 
  this is dumb . 
  you 're supposed to have policies and principles of your own , not mindlessly following the public . 
  no that 's how democracy works . 
  you stand for ideas and people vote you in to implement them . 
  if you you do n't like someone 's policies you do n't vote for them . 
  of course politicians need feedback from citizenry to adjust actual implementations , but we * have * representative democracy so we do n't have to do everything the masses demand directly . 
  because it 's mostly moronic bullshit . 
   why do we trust the to make the right choice in that case , but do n't think they 're capable of making the right choices for themselves in the areas that matter , i.e. 
  the actual laws that they are agreeing to be governed by ? 
  lol . 
  what a disaster would that be . 
  i 'd run as far as possible from a country where a mass of uneducated idiots got to make the laws directly . 
  besides , it does n't scale . 
  people do n't actually bother to think about 99 % of policies , they would n't start now . 
  it 's easy to form an opinion about a presidential candidate , but hard to design specific policies . 
  especially when you do n't know shit about economics , agriculture , science , politics , and everything else . 
  yeah , the working class seems to be completely unrepresented on reddit . 
  the only opinions you see on the popular subs are incredibly anti-labour . 
  nije problem u restrikcijama i kaznama , problem je kad se one primjenjuju nekonzistentno , tj . 
  sure , then i can make the jump from capitalism to fascism to nazism . 
  basically the same thing . 
  just like communism and stalinism . 
  oh and those interrogation rooms sound just like those that freedom land agencies use . 
  oh and the usa overthrew a democratically elected chilean socialist government and installed a brutal fascist regime . 
  china is capitalist . 
  partisans in yugoslavia . 
  they were instrumental in the libration of europe from the nazis . 
  your utter ignorance of history is appalling . 
  your arguments are not reasonable but emotional . 
  the state and corporations are two vital components of the same system . 
  both ought to be removed . 
  i see quite a lot of fascists and libertarians around so i 'd say yes . 
  thread about the holocaust gets subverted by anti-communist propaganda less intellectually honest than mccarthyanism . 
  yes this is / pol / . 
  except after all that work is done by the workers , someone else collects the profit . 
  finance , marketing , and logistics are also work . 
  famine and genocide are n't the same thing . 
  mao did n't willingly kill those people like hitler did to the jews . 
  also , i lived in yugoslavia . 
  please tell me about which genocides my country committed . 
  oh , right , they did n't , tito 's partisans were busy freeing europe from fascism . 
  i 'm proud my grandfather 's were partisans . 
  see that 's the problem with making shit up , someone well call you out on it . 
  private property implies force and coercion to protect it too . 
  removed as in workers taking control of the means of production . 
  which is pretty unrealistic ( in large due to capitalists using force and coercion to maintain private property ) but it still does n't mean that criticism is useless . 
  but the problems in china your parents are mad about are caused by the current repressive state-capitalist government , not communists . 
  so basically you do n't know shit and are just spewing based on your ideological bias . 
  tito ** was one of the most important fighters for liberation of europe . 
  ** i actually lived under him , although i was an infant when he died , but i know it was better back then . 
  ask most people , tito was a fair ruler , much better than the current criminals in power . 
  mmmmm \u0161lag all over, 
  when i said you need force and coercion to protect private property , i was mainly thinking of the current system . 
  it 's obvious who you need to protect it from - practically everyone else , that 's why the state and police exist . 
  and workers who are misled and bred on statist and capitalist propaganda would oppose anything that is in their interest ( rights , healthcare , minimum wage , unions ) - [ see this ] ( http://imgur.com/ik0c8hs ) . 
  sad je sve jasno, 
  misuse of that informal logical fallacy ( which is in itself a fallacy , see argument from fallacy ) - has to stop . 
  no , you ca n't just cry no true scotsman at everything , it does n't work that way , read about it . 
  ok so i 'll just conclude you 're s troll . 
  one story of a misreporting journalist and some unrelated article ? 
  that 's your proof to accuse the entire left of supporting regimes ? 
  lol . 
  then i can accuse you of being a fascists . 
  it 's funny because capitalists actually supported fascism . 
  even a few years ago by overthrowing a democratic socialist in chile and replacing him with the murderous animal pinochet . 
  such things happened at numerous other times . 
  some on the right supported fascists and hitler but that does n't mean everyone on the right does . 
  if you actually believe what you are writing you are completely delusional . 
  i would n't know honestly . 
  tito never liked stalin and from what little i remember of yugoslavian politics we did n't particularity like the ussr . 
  my best guess is that people did n't know the extent of the crimes of those regimes or were just lying for political points . 
  yes ? 
  you think management is magic that only capitalists can do ? 
  i do n't think that people are either ` fine ' or ` not fine ' . 
  it 's a constant struggle between classes . 
  fuck being ` fine ' when the 1 % are taking everything you produce . 
  and most people are ` fine ' ?
