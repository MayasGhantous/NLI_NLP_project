  like you literally destroyed all bridges in belgrade and bombed many civilian buildings . 
  also , what about the american army ? 
  it 's ok when they commit genocide on a much greater scale ? 
  the serbian army is nothing in comparison . 
  and i say this as a croat . 
  yes , you 're right , what americans are doing in the middle east is n't exactly genocide , but it 's still large-scale murder , and practical destruction of entire countries . 
  drones are just one uncannily inhuman part of it . 
  i do n't think you understand the seriousness of bombing the shit out of a european sovereign nation 's capital . 
  especially when that nation is russia 's biggest ideological and military ally in europe . 
  and no it 's not some war-torn shithole of a country either , it 's definitely a part of the western civilization , with modern technology , a good standard of living ( that matters because it increases the shock factor on the citizens and makes others easier to relate to their situation ) . 
  yep you quite fucked up there and the hate wo n't wash soon . 
  you may or may not be right , but playing the global policeman is ought to get you some hate . 
  privacy is a right , not a need , though . 
  you 're making it sound as anyone who wants ultimate privacy actually needs it out of ulterior motives , or at least that 's the sentiment i 'm picking up . 
  in either case , it is not so , some people want to be free/private out of principle . 
  for those wondering , this is a reference to a great anime called welcome to the nhk ! , i definitely recommend it . 
  this press is n't free and independent , just pointing it out . 
  well if you were n't actually involved in it i doubt it . 
  were you ? 
  and understanding it would surely mean you also understand why americans are perceived badly in serbia in general , so we do n't disagree on anything ( well , except whether the attacks were justified , but that 's not my original point anyway ) . 
   just realized this is a thing, 
   then realized i do n't even need to copy , just select text, 
  wow i have that habit as well . 
  i was frantically selecting your comment while getting through it , and then got weired out as you were mentioning it :d, 
  i 've got a weird text [ layout ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5wyay3u.png ) on page # 1 ( and probably others , did n't check ) . 
  - browser : firefox 33, 
  source ? 
  inb4 gay pornjava, 
  yes , just google it . 
  the fact that most fantasy books of today are actually influenced heavily by lotr . 
  tolkien created so much by merging various mythologies , this particular form , and creating a world on that scale . 
  such things simply did not exist before . 
  he not only created a world , but an entirely new mechanism for literature imo . 
  what 's the problem with ` vrms ` ? 
  looks neat , i 'll use it . 
  also , you can share it at / r/ubuntuappdev - especially if you tell us what technologies you used , and also post some resources , 
  well he clearly pointed out that the system can be improved . 
  unless he 's wrong there are many things you can do between canonical 's anonymization and simply not using the net at all . 
  but why is that so ? 
  almost all platforms use stack overflow as their place to ask questions ( microsoft , apple , etc ) . 
  also , sometimes it 's not really clear whether a question is about ubuntu or just the underlaying technologies , so there 'd be a needles split among questions . 
  i know what it is , but i why ca n't the op use that ? 
  this . 
  read manufacturing consent by chomsky . 
  likewise for haskell , you do n't get monads until you 've invented a entirely new convulated analogy for them and blogged about it . 
  this will explain it without appealing to wild analogies : http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html . 
  best one i 've found yet . 
  i do n't get this, 
  edit : got it . 
  it 's saying that if a compiler can detect a missing semicolon , it should add it and stop complaining . 
  which is kind of retarded , how is it supposed to edit your files ? 
  besides adding a semicolon is not always unambiguous . 
  lol why is this so down voted ? 
  am i missing something ? 
  or rather , javascript is just a bad language . 
  in scala it works great , having optional semicolons , because the language is not rife with unexpected rules regarding formatting . 
  no i would n't say so . 
  it 's important that the ` wrapped values ' can function as lists ( oversimplification ) - in fact , lists are one of the values which satisfy the functor typeclass . 
  that is important because it allows you to treat the results of many different types of values as lists over which you can fmap again , flatten them , and so on . 
  functors essentially add another dimension to your programming . 
  yes but compiler executables are n't supposed to edit your source files at all . 
  that 'd be a disaster on so many levels . 
  i 'm not of course saying it 's technically impossible it 's just beyond all reason . 
  and ide or a code formatter , on the other hand , could do this - so i guess the idea is for * them * , not compilers ... 
  i do n't understand what would be the benefit of this . 
  the obvious ** huge ** downside is making some devices needlessly unusable . 
  i 'm too tired to detect sarcasm , please tell me whether you are genuinely asking me to explain monads or just making a funny yoke , in which case , explain that . 
  b-but we can,

  [ what is free software ? 
  / r/freesoftware / r/opensource / r/gnu / r/linux, 
  what are some other subs that focus on free software ( or do n't have it as a primary topic but the free software community is active in them ) ? 
  i 'm already subscribed to / r/freesoftware , / r/linux , and / r/opensource . 
  woah man calm down . 
  i 'm just spreading the idea , and you 'd definitely agree that it 's relevant here ? 
  the victim complex is strong in this one . 
  might i suggest you also add links to the job listings or other hiring information of the companies ? 
  happened to me a few days ago . 
  reboot to finish updating . 
  reboot to configure . 
  on linux i do n't have to reboot , ever . 
  even kernels can be hotswapped , although on servers , i rarely update the kernels , i.e. 
  bother to reboot . 
  nope . 
  chemical evolution and amino acids explain the origins of life much better than god . 
  on the contrary even the people who are feeling anxious do end up having a good time and forming bonds on such activities . 
  i added and installed the tox-bootstrapd package on my ubuntu server , started the service - and i can see the public key in the syslog - but what else do i need to do ? 
  you mean terminus ? 
  yep . 
  trantor is kind of in the center , terminus is on one side of the periphery , and the second foundation on the other ( i only read the first book so i 'm not sure ) . 
  right , ok, 
  did you try to talk to them and explain the problem ? 
  read [ opensources ] ( http://www.smaldone.com.ar/documentos/libros/opensources.pdf ) for a great summary of hacker culture and operating systems before unix . 
  it was an incredibly diverse and rich field before unix spread , 
  well that 's an obviously false statement . 
  you do n't care . 
  or at least pretend not to - since your tone seems perturbed - but others obviously do . 
  since , you know , this is a fucking ** technology ** subreddit . 
  fucking imperative language programmers amirite ?
