  the product is useless trash . 
  just because people are gullible enough to buy into it does not make it a good product . 
  my point is that there are actually people who work hard to earn their cash ( eduction , hours spent developing ) , and ** contribute to the actual market ** , but you 're just flooding it and destroying it for everyone else . 
  nothing personal of course , but i 'm sure that money can also buy you a thick enough skin to stand the truth . 
  interesting . 
  investing seems a lot of fun , and something i 'd definitely like to get into - but it 's practically unreachable since you already need to have money to get into it ... 
  well you certainly need to be lucky to be born in a part of the world where you even stand a chance at success , for starters . 
  then , you need to be in a family which cares about you and can provide basic needs , and care for your education . 
  but even after all those preliminary steps , a lot of businesses fail , and a lot of investments do n't pay off - i think there 's a fair bit of luck in there too . 
  it 's not * all * luck , and there certainly is a lower risk option - but luck is a component still . 
  just study markdown syntax guys, 
  ** submission statement **, 
  / r/programmingdiscussion was created primarily because i think there needs to be a place on reddit where you can actually submit text posts about programming , and not just external websites . 
  it 's not dedicated to noob questions directly , but discussions about programming and all related activities , and the topics can range from stuff like `` what programming language would be the best tool for to job '' , `` how do you think rust will impact the current systems languages landscape '' , to `` how best to configure my multiple monitors for coding '' or `` how to deal with some specific configuration of git repositories '' . 
  it 's essentially a more general version of this sub , not limited to just news . 
  sure , i 'll make you a mod . 
  try to drive some activity to the sub to bootstrap it , 
  the particular distribution of wealth in society is problematic , and the growing trend for the wealth to be concentrated in the hands of the elite who are using it to subvert the democracy even more so . 
  i 'd definitely be happy if more people were able to do it . 
  but sadly less and less people are . 
  more like unga bunga has 100s of millions coconuts and i 'm in debt for almost a million to him . 
  additionally he 's giving a tiny fraction of his coconuts to people who have guns and force me to be even more indebted to him by idiotic policies . 
  also those people with guns take my money and give it to unga bunga . 
  also there 's like 1 unga and several million me 's . 
  but unga bunga also bought out the media and now most me 's support him and think * he 's * the endangered one . 
  but yeah , how dare i even talk about distribution of wealth . 
  we 'll all have to try to make it so . 
  i 'll make you a mod if you 'd be willing to help to achieve that . 
  oh it 's a more growing trend now than ever . 
  [ watch this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpkkqnijnsm ) they do n't prove it 's growing but give you a very good perspective - if you do some research you 'll find the concrete proof that the gap is growing - essentially it 's like a u shape , with inequality rapidly increasing as you get further away from ww 1 in either direction of history . 
  besides you must 've seen the data about corporate profits vs. worker wages . 
  you will find the most detailed analysis in capital in the 21st century by thomas piketty - the summary of a pretty much the most comprehensive economic study i 've ever seen . 
  yep , that 's the idea . 
  yeah why do n't poor people just ** buy more money ? 
  wow wild conjecture and personal insults instead of an actual economic argument . 
   good luck with your attitude , it may be all that 's holding you back, 
  what makes you think there 's anything holding me back ? 
  personally , i 'm doing just fine as a software developer , and probably will not live in poverty until the rest of my life . 
  but that has ** nothing to do with how bad the economic system actually is . 
  ** rich people are becoming richer while to poor are becoming poorer , that is destroying our economies ** and ** democracies . 
  besides how naive do you have to be to think that effort = award ? 
  what about the bankers - who 've robbed us all ? 
  you think those people worked more than you and me ? 
  and what about those who inherited it ? 
  quite a lot of wealth has been inherited . 
  and what about the kids in third world countries that made this laptop i 'm typing this on ? 
  they worked pretty fucking hard would n't you agree ? 
  they worked themselves to an early death , quite a lot of them , and they were robbed of any chance of having a good life . 
  but you go on taunting republican propaganda like a good , compliant citizen . 
  well , it will practically be the antithesis of stack overflow - mostly oriented around subjective discussion , advice , and not just concrete hard facts that so is constrained to . 
  i 'll make you a mod soon . 
  thanks will do, 
  i 'll think of something and put it in the sidebar but i doubt there 'd be many problems . 
  you ca n't stop people from voting on their preferences , and of course flamewars will be banned . 
  ** submission statement **, 
  / r/programmingdiscussion was created primarily because i think there needs to be a place on reddit where you can actually submit text posts about programming , and not just external websites . 
  it is in contrast to the currently existing / r/programming , which only allows external links and no textual discussion . 
  so , if you want to talk about stuff like which language is the best for some particular task , are looking for cool projects to join , or have general ( subjective or otherwise ! ), 
  questions about programming or development , feel free to subscribe !, 
  i 'm also looking for people who 're willing to volunteer some of their time to help manage the community . 
  since it is related to computer science , i 'm posting it here as well !, 
  my prof said that the longer you study imperative languages , the harder functional languages will be to grok . 
  that was n't true for me , since functional languages almost immediately made * more * sense ... 
  it seems to me like people in your uni are generally not that interested in programming . 
  if you had a more thorough introduction with more serious requirements , surely people would exhibit more effort . 
  how are monads applied to parsers ? 
  i 'm currently working with parsers ... 
  you 're not replying to the person you think you 're replying to . 
  can you explain that first type signature ? 
  personally i 've only worked with parsers in the context of c and for me they 're just processes which analyze some sequence of symbols for grammatical structures and execute rules based on that ... 
  specifically what is the string in that tuple - i suppose the result is the concrete syntax tree of the input . 
  i did n't say i was sad about his success . 
  i 'm happy for it . 
  i 'm sad that less and less people are able to do what he has because of the rising economic inequality . 
  you do n't actually need to do that with flash memory only with drives . 
  i was calling you out on your bullshit to begin with and you think that calling me names would be constructive . 
  my advice is to cool down a bit and stop taking yourself so seriously . 
  i was just going through my messages, 
  it 's not bullshit it 's statistics . 
  the wealth distribution is becoming less and less equal . 
  in fact it was this unequal right about before the french revolution . 
  a couple of nerds ( i say this as a positive epithet ) getting rich off apps is an anomaly in an otherwise downwards system . 
  ah , thanks . 
  would you be kind enough to provide some links where i can learn more about parser ? 
  i 'm currently reading the dragon book , but it 's mostly a technical overview - you seem to know much more about the theory behind them . 
  suicide : http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/09/the_nanny_state_didnt_show_up.html ( actually about responsibility , power , etc , not about suicide , it 's just a detail i remembered the article by ), 
  feminism : [ one ] ( http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/05/cyberbll.html ) and [ two ] ( http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/03/dont_hate_her_because_shes_suc.html ) ( actually about power , he just reflects upon feminism as well ), 
  i think that these articles , along with his first ones in the [ narcissism ] ( http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/narcissism/ ) category , are the best he 's written . 
  he also does have a [ suicide ] ( http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/clinical/suicide/ ) category , but it 's a subcategory of [ clinical ] ( http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/clinical/ ) . 
  six with 3 by 2 i suppose ? 
  two rows with three horizontal monitors ? 
  also why that second configuration specifically ( one portrait , three landscape ) ? 
   i might do 1 portrait for reading articles, 
  the thing is - i do n't see an advantage in that at all . 
  it does n't make you read faster , only enables you to see more text ... which you have n't yet read . 
  well , maybe it helps build context out of content - pictures , shape of text , paragraphs , code snippets - that sort of thing , it might be useful to see more of . 
  i 'm gon na go 1 week all landscape and then another week 2 +1 ( portrait ) . 
  woah that 's one neat setup . 
  are all of those full hd ?
