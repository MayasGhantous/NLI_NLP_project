  additionally - where did you get that stand ? 
  is there a place i can order them online in europe ? 
  thanks a tonne , i 'll look into it . 
  / usr/lib/firefox / firefox : elf 64-bit lsb shared object , x86-64, 
  do n't know what you 've talking about , it 's been here for years !, 
  at least on linux :p, 
  ( do n't know what 's the disparity for . ), 
  c , mostly robotics and electronics stuff for avrs . 
  probably responsible for my love of the lower level to this day !, 
  used ram is wasted ram ? 
  on the contrary , i 'd like to `` sacrifice '' some free ( wasted ) ram for more capabilities !, 
  actually no , there are specific advantages to using 64 bit software on 64 bit hardware . 
  more registers , more memory , faster encryption ( ssl ) , and lots of other benefits you can probably google yourself ... 
  since we 're talking geeks they 're probably using linux , so that would make the cool hud gnome , kde , unity , or conky ... 
  [ first of the posts i 'm referring to . 
  ] ( http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2006/12/times_person_of_the_year_is_so.html ), 
  start from the oldest ones in the narcissism category [ here ] ( http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/narcissism/7.html ) . 
  flip your phone for the edit button on compact ( horrible i know ), 
  why not use linux ? 
  you can start with a popular distribution like [ ubuntu ] ( http://ubuntu.com ) or [ fedora ] ( https://fedoraproject.org ) !, 
  [ `` free software , free society '' - a video that explains free software philosophy . ] ( https://youtu.be/ag1akil_2gm ) . 
  it 's strikingly similar logic to anarchism/marxism . 
  and remember to join the appropriate subs : / r/linux , / r/gnu , / r/ubuntu , / r/fsf , / r/eff , and others . 
  also i have to recommend using firefox over chrome or any other browser , as mozilla does much more for your freedom and the web in general . 
  also install extensions like https everywhere and remember to block corporate propaganda with adblock ** edge ** ( plus cooperates with the advertisers ) . 
  i 've been on the web since forever and never ever encountered that ... 
  i consider even a slight detection and notice , invasive ... 
  but it really is , under these conditions :, 
  your hardware is compatible . 
  you do n't want to mess with drivers much , it should just work , and in 90 % of cases it does . 
  you do n't require exclusive software . 
  unless you 're a professional this is most likely not the case . 
  otherwise with gnome and unity i 'd say it 's even easier to use . 
  if you have any questions just ask on those subs . 
  edit : why am i being downvoted ? 
  which problems were you experiencing ? 
  ubuntu is much easier to install than windows , and has been for quite some time . 
  i 've done literally multiple dozens of installs of both systems on multiple environments . 
  most likely there were compatibility problems which are sadly out of anyone 's power but the manufacturer ... 
  i donate to sites and projects i actually want to support . 
  suggesting i have *** any *** moral obligation to support blogspam , corporate propaganda , and cancerous youtubers is ridiculous . 
  i only have the ad blocker disabled on a couple of sites , like reddit , 4chan , and some blogs . 
   in a more direct response to your question , almost nobody uses ad-block in the grand scheme of things . 
  especially on mobile devices . 
  well seems like i have to start advertising ( hah ! ), 
  this idea then . 
  i probably live in a bubble , but i have no idea whether most regular users have it installed ... 
  but it seems probable that they do n't . 
  i 'm really not that well informed on the topic , sorry . 
  if it 's a big deal , then you can specifically let that site show you ads . 
  but they 're a violent attack against my sanity and rationality , so i almost exclusively forbid them . 
  also , donations are much better , since you actually have a choice over what you support . 
  i do n't know enough about it to be able to say . 
  but the article places a heavy emphasis on windows 8 being required for this backdoor . 
  if it 's truly a hardware issue , then any os would be equally vulnerable i suppose . 
  but that 's not what this is i think . 
  well that 's definitely not the expected behavior . 
  i 'd look into whether you 've downloaded the image for the correct architecture , for example if your computer is 32-bit then the image has to be 32-bit as well . 
  other than that if you still want to proceed you will need to ask specifically somewhere . 
  [ askubuntu ] ( http://askubuntu.com ) is a good choice . 
  be specific about your procedure and hardware . 
  the article you 've linked is n't that exact in denying it , either :, 
   reports began to spread -- albeit a little away from the mainstream media -- following the german publication 's story on tuesday suggesting that a small `` trusted computing '' chip embedded in many modern computers can aid the u.s. government 's surveillance efforts . 
  as a result , the report claimed -- citing an internal document from germany 's office for information security ( bsi ) -- that the latest version of windows in certain circumstances could not be trusted in a government setting . 
   on thursday , the bsi published an opinion walking back on the report 's claims [ pdf ] , while offering advice to the federal and civilian it community on the matter . 
  [ it is known for certain ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/12/glenn-greenwald-nsa-tampers-us-internet-routers-snowden ) that nsa inserts spying devices into it equipment such as routers . 
  microsoft has one of the most extensive cooperation programs with the nsa , [ being the first to join many of their operations ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/prism_slide_5.jpg ) ( literally the first major corporation to join prism ) . 
  dr. richard stallman 's interview on the topic of the [ universal backdoor ] ( http://techrights.org/2013/07/04/techbytes-episode-80-richard-stallman-on-universal-back-door-in-microsoft-windows-and-his-search-engine-habits/ ) for windows . 
  none of this is shocking or new . 
  if software can not be audited and verified by a third party , ** it can not be trusted . 
  ** the rationality of this statement is backed up by a mountain of evidence . 
  ok , if you need any assistance just ask here or send me a message . 
  i hope it works good for you !, 
  yeah , i did n't mean to imply it had something to do with windows , just making certain that we share common context about the scope of spying going on . 
  it 's not just obscure nsa datacenters doing obscure nsa business , it 's ** literally ** an invasion into our lives on all levels . 
  my point was that , although this particular case might be a case of sensationalism , the problem is actually even bigger than what most people realize . 
  thanks for the warning , i did n't properly check that fsf article for some time , i 'll remove the link . 
   in fact , as far as mitigations go , windows is more secure than linux , and os x. 
  please substantiate it . 
  i 'd say this is very wrong since linux has a superior permissions system , a centralized app directory , and better defaults . 
  additionally , the existence of systems such as selinux is a major boon to linux security , although not available on all desktops ( it is activated by default on fedora ) . 
  [ no one ever asked me if i wanted to see them .

  you can not prove this . 
  any argument about * human nature * translates to absolute bullshit at its core . 
  and lower employment , leading to less buying power , leading to less profits , leading to lower wages , and the vicious cycle repeats . 
  welcome to marxism 101 !, 
  and what you get is an even more vicious forms of organization , with private armies and such . 
  just a small detail you forgot to mention . 
  no it 's literally your burden to prove your arguments . 
  i have no such burden . 
  until you explain exactly what this human nature is , prove that it ca n't be counteracted , and explain how it 's relevant ... 
  and let me give you a hint it 's much more complex than ` human nature ' . 
  and stop getting so perturbed about people swearing on the internet because no one gives a shit honestly . 
  he 's talking about ethnicity not citizenship . 
  literally every state i know of . 
  for example my state gives special rights to minorities such as serbs . 
  but hey do n't let me interfere with the antisemitic circle jerk , because why criticise the actually important things when you can politicize ... 
  i fail to see the point . 
  sure israel might be oppressive towards minorities but that 's another issue .
