  literally in the link i posted, 
  look into the [ opencog ] ( http://opencog.org/ ) project , they are lead by a couple of researchers and based in hong kong , devoted to creating and artificial general intelligence ( agi ) . 
  there 's been a documentary by raj dye ( leader afaik ) called [ singularity or bust ] ( http://youtu.be/owppju3jwpe ) - i recommend it to anyone interested in ai !, 
  and do n't forget to donate to them if you care !, 
  ( not affiliated in any way . ), 
  so you have a phd in the field ? 
  must be some breakthrough research , link it !, 
  i do n't get the relationship between flatmap and   = . 
  is n't   = the bind function , and flatmap a function that essentially flattens a list after mapping all the elements recursively ( if i understood it well after a quick google session ) ? 
  maybe flatmap is a specific bind function ? 
  ah ca n't wait to tell that to my muslim friends . 
  `` you know , guys , since you have n't violently killed me yet in the name of allah , you 're no real muslims . 
  i mean , come on , i 'm a freakin ' infidel , you ca n't just tolerate me ! '', 
  i really do n't know what to say to you guys . 
  i 'm starting to suspect you 're arguing with an external political agenda against muslims because your posts just do n't make any sense . 
  and before i get accused of dodging the question , no , muslims are not required to follow the quran literally . 
  in fact most muslim philosophers have interpreted it as a ** peaceful ** battle with one 's own lack of faith , not modern extremism . 
  you 're basically proclaiming more than a billion people violent savages ** but using your logic almost all religious people are that because they 're commanded to be by their god . 
  ** nevermind that they 're actually not , nevermind that no one is required to follow religion 100 % . ah ca n't wait to tell that to my muslim friends .

  i guess you just are n't admin material . 
  hopeful you wo n't be managing any online communities in the future , or you 'll have to learn the hard way . 
  anyway +1 internet points for arguing for the sake of arguing , you sure perfected the skill of playing dumb . 
   the people, 
  what a funny way of saying `` a small number of untouchable rich elite '' . 
  if it were owned by the people , it 'd be socialism . 
  * fab, 
  please remind me , what happens with him after davos sets him off ? 
  hell , what happens to davos ? 
  yeah what * happened * to that thing ? 
  it was all over got but then * whoosh * , not mentioned a single time . 
  what ? 
  please elaborate, 
  what are you referring to ? 
  link, 
  these are my two favorite comments on this sub haha < 3, 
  yeah but i am not really sure what you are referring to . 
  i vaguely remember reading that statement , but i forgot the context . 
  so if you could remind me , that 'd be great , thanks . 
  i remember how davos went to reason with maderly , but then his fleet got wrecked , i just do n't know what happened to edric storm ( or davos immediately after ) . 
  ah , great then . 
  mark shuttleworth is a notable and relevant example . 
  billionaire ( or at least was ) , flew to space , now funds canonical to make ubuntu and just does n't give a fuck . 
  the literal translation of literally in my language is also being used this way . 
  i do n't get the problem , i thought it was simple hyperbole , right ? 
  or is the problem here that literally is meant to mean strictly ** not ** hyperbole ? 
  well in either case , it 's pretty much become a part of the language here , i do n't even remember a time when it was . 
  i doubt you could change anything about that . 
  git the fuck out dirty commie, 
  took our jerbs, 
  majority shareholders are sergey and page , over 50 % . 
  they have the power to do anything they want . 
  please do n't make your own . 
  you 'll repeat thousands of security and design mistakes . 
  check out [ discourse ] ( http://www.discourse.org/ ) instead . 
  god damn it i just started using it for real ... 
  oh , so you 're against firefighters saving your house when there 's a fire ? 
  you would never request help from the police after or during being robbed ? 
  you have forfeit your rights of ever suing everyone ? 
  or driving on roads ? 
  or having your kids educated ? 
  well you can basically go live in the woods then . 
  unless , you 're specifically against * welfare * , and ok with everything else - the you 're simply an asshole . 
  but your last sentence suggests that you 're against ** all ** taxes ( * it 's my money to spend as i please * ) - not that it makes you any less an asshole though . 
   the cold hard fact of life is that you are in the situation you are in because you either made bad choices , or because you continue to not accept that you are fully responsibility for your own success, 
  seriously , honestly fuck you . 
  per megawatt generated or just annually ? 
  because there 's a huge difference . 
  as far as i know we could simply be using 10 times more coal . 
  i can absolutely understand his position . 
  and i believe others do too ( except the guy you replied to was kind of offensive ) . 
  but that does n't mean that this information should not be posted . 
  that will only happen if our civilization essentially crashes and burns . 
  tolerance , women 's rights , etc - are not just there * randomly * , they 're a product of a society which ** had ** to evolve its values in order to progress . 
  i doubt you could have a capitalistic society where more and more people would be happy and accepted as they are if only white males were free . 
  probably what they always `` think '' about everything : `` ids da joooz !!! '', 
  i remember being called out for an idiot when i suggested this to my biology teacher . 
  this was in every biology textbook i 've ever had . 
  what the fuck . 
  yawn , no , shill , we do n't want to succumb to corporate interests . 
  but you already pay . 
  b-but the free market will solve this !, 
  ! 1 you can just swtich to another provider !!!, 
  * or boycott the internet !, 
  stop fighting for your rights , that 's immoral !, 
  think of those poor rich people and nice corporations , what are they going to do if some bad , baaaad gubmint tries to tell them what to do ? 
  national sovereignty or democracy ? 
  you do n't need that !, 
  *** gubmint bad ron paul 2012 ***, 
   tywin is bald and has whiskers . 
  i watched a few episodes before starting to read the books , and i always imagined tywin looking exactly like he does in the show . 
  same for harry potter , basically the movie influenced how i imagined the atmosphere , the interior , and the characters quite a lot .
