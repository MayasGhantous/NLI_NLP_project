  because burden of proof is on you . 
  you 're claiming that a ( biology ) causes b ( behavior ) , while i 'm pointing out that it also could be c ( gender roles ) , and have n't actually established a causal relationship at all . 
  also if you 're the one downvoting me that 's truly pathetic . 
  when you 're getting defensive because someone is pointing flaws in your logic that 's further proof of your entire position being of questionable rationality . 
  haha i 'll google that as well ... 
  thanks !, 
  what 's going on ? 
  not from the us, 
  great blog all-around , definitely dig further than that i recommend . 
  oh so the unrest has spread from ferguson ? 
  i do n't understand . 
  are you suggesting racism is benign ? 
  i agree that people overreact , but i do n't agree it 's part of some `` leftist conspiracy '' . 
  i still do n't understand what you 're saying . 
  it 's bad that people are brainwashed , i agree , but how 's that related ? 
  these people were n't brainwashed into rejecting racism . 
  good luck !, 
  so you 're saying that reputation is a bad thing in general ? 
  i disagree . 
  it 's a useful mechanism that can get out of hand . 
   are you misreading me on purpose ? 
  no , you 're not being concrete enough . 
  i ca n't see the argument here at all . 
   if the people around have bad ideas , you can get a bad reputation for bad reasons . 
  again , what are you trying to say ? 
  this does n't contradict anything i stated before . 
  this [ web upd8 article ] ( http://www.webupd8.org/2014/09/pushbullet-indicator-gets-partial.html ) explains that it currently works only in one direction : phone -  desktop . 
  however , for me , firefox is n't picking it up either . 
  only the indicator app is . 
  i agree with your suggestion that society can negatively react to differing opinions , but i think you 're not sufficiently analyzing the way that works . 
  you 're leaving out a key element of the mechanism : rationality and discussion . 
  you have to construct an actual case of why you 're reacting to something negatively , so it makes no sense to just conclude `` all negative reactions are bad because the proposed opinion has a chance to actually be good '' . 
  you already implied a sort-of objective measure of merit ( otherwise you could n't talk about good and bad opinions ) - so you have to accept that thorough rational debate it is possible to create a `` social context '' that determines what is accepted and what is not . 
  ** edit : ** let me just be clear that i do not think that must common instances of political correctness at work that people are pissed about have been rationally discussed . 
  especially when it comes to harmless , unintentional stuff . 
  but this is not it . 
  i see this said for absolutely every oem . 
  i 'm utterly confused about laptops and too afraid to actually but anything now ; _ ;, 
  what the fuck . 
  are american parents retarded ? 
  i 'm looking at this i ca n't find any other explanation . 
  like how do you get those ideas in your mind . 
  i doubt you can get a lot of people interested by * not telling them anything about the project . 
  that 's like basic stuff . 
  this post makes no sense . 
  do you have any rational reason to disagree with what he said ? 
  because you ca n't disagree with facts , assuming they 're correct . 
  unless you were referring to the temporal approximation . 
  i chuckled, 
  oh , thanks . 
  i thought it tested and chached automatically or something , but this is simpler and makes more sense . 
  actually free market theories assume rational agents acting in their own self-interest . 
  which , of course , is a fictious construct , not only due to advertising . 
  ancap morals are another topic ... 
   do they also assume that any market transaction , simply by virtue of being a market transaction , is a fair exchange ? 
  they deny the concept of fairness . 
  i think . 
  try being more specific maybe i 'll be able to answer you better . 
   because advertisers plastering ads over our communities is kind of a great example of rational agents acting in their own self-interest . 
  yep , that 's the point . 
  other people 's interests are not in your interest . 
  cue contradiction . 
  information asymmetry , wealth inequality , externalities , coercion , fraud - all these things your ` theory ' ( definitely not a scientific one ) has n't accounted for . 
  this has been debated so many times i do n't see much coming out of it . 
  just making sure - dae is an acronym and itt is an initialism , because of the way they are pronounced , right ? 
  i was once in a thread on a mainstream sub , where every other comment was like `` we need to genocide the roma '' , and some of them had the score in like thousands . 
  but it 's ok i read somewhere that they steal a lot !, 
  - literally the logic when i wondered what the fuck, 
  they did ? 
  link please ? 
  edit : must be terrible when you get so mad that easily lol, 
  i do ; _ ;, 
  someone sure is mad . 
   morality suddenly becomes irrelevant when you make money off something, 
  probably the logic that the oil industry uses when they fuck up and have the tax payers clear it up . 
  not saying that he 's doing anything on that level , just attacking your logic in isolation . 
  what ? 
  the entire point is to ease the development and distribution . 
  currently packaging for linux is a nightmare . 
  packaging for click is easy-peasy and has incredible benefits . 
  i just hope that the architecture will be ** usable ** and ** widely adopted ** in other distributions . 
  per se click is awesome but what use of it will there be to the wider linux community if it 's ubuntu-exclusive ? 
  most of us use or at lest have used other distros - so we should lobby for wider support !, 
  i did n't know about it . 
  mocking someone for not knowing something makes no rational sense . 
  he did n't even tell me about it , he was just insulting . 
  so i have every right to tell him to go have a heart attack if he so prefers to get mad . 
  yes i agree , but the response i got to my laziness was definitely not justified, 
  probably both , working together on common practices , standards , communicating with app devs , and of course collaborating on upstream dev ( at least redhat and suse should chime in at this front ) . 
   not saying that he 's doing anything on that level , just attacking your logic in isolation . 
  besides the morality and market effects of advertising are a whole other topic . 
  you can view it from a generalized context where aggressive advertising is a technique to condition you and free you off your agency , and is incredibly invasive to your mind . 
  or , if you disregard that and conclude that it * must * be moral *** because everyone is doing it !!!, 
  *** then he 's just an asshole for breaking the established in-rules of advertising and being advertised to , by placing the ad at that particular spot . 
  i doubt it since `` acting in one 's self-interest '' is the main driving force behind them , so surely your theory - or , more accurately , ideology - would not do much else but perpetuate them . 
  of cours , e i 'd gladly hear your rebuttal/defense , do n't take this personally/seriously . 
  you have no fucking idea ( rhetorical ) of what your isp , services you use , ad networks , and the aggregate organizations they form , know about you , and the mechanisms they use to spy on you . 
  it 's not in your interest . 
  it 's in corporate and government interest . 
  and you certainly would n't want an internet like that if you did .
