  i fail to see your point . 
  the way i see moral rules is like conventions . 
  claiming that they have some fundamental grounding in anything other than a sense is empathy is silly because it promotes social conventions into the material world . 
  all the things you mentioned are just more-or-less abstract ideas , which resemble reality quite accurately most of the time . 
  sets and addition are very abstract ideas that still have an application in reality though , mainly because they allow us to reason about it . 
  none of this makes moral rules anything but our ideas about how we should behave . 
  so your point is that people make decisions sometimes taking into account something we call ` moral rules ' ? 
  i do n't disagree with that but i fail to see how it 's an informative idea ... 
  i just ca n't see what 's being claimed here . 
  is it that moral rules exist independently of people ? 
  that 's false by definition ( as they are ` things which inform our ethical decisions ' ) . 
  is it that there are absolute ` best ' rules we should all follow ? 
  well it depends on what you mean by best , you still need some kind of framework that will ultimately be subjective . 
   first paragraph, 
  sure . 
  but when you 're claiming that morals are a part of that reality you 've conceded that `` reality is real '' , or whatever your point was there . 
   second paragraph, 
  if morals are not social constructs then what are they ? 
  then we just have different definitions of what constitutes a part of reality . 
  if you 're claiming that you can construct a moral system based on some axioms and then use logical inference to prove things within it , sure . 
  but that 's still just a human construct , like mathematics . 
  first off , math does n't predict anything , science does , and scientific predictions are flawed in many ways , however they are selected based on * how good they are at predicting * , and relativity was quite good at it . 
  math is just logic applied to our understating of numbers . 
  science is driven by empirical data , that 's completely different than making up axioms '' about what is right and what is n't . 
  you 're like a theist telling an atheist he ca n't prove the inexistence of god - to which my reply is usually * sure , whatever * . 
  if some people decide to believe morals exist as some objective rules , that 's just a silly belief . 
  i do n't see the need to post it here . 
   i 'd argue that ( at their base ) they 're properties of social and individual psychology that relate to positive changes in conscious systems , unbeholden to bias through personal preference . 
  i partially agree with this . 
  my definition emphasises that they are arbitrary rules which the collective enforces because it is beneficial to the collective ( and sometimes not to the individual , but often important enough to disregard direct aims for the sake of preserving the norms ) . 
   that is a strange and fairly arbitrary boundary to draw . 
  no it 's actually a widely accepted and well understood difference . 
  mathematics is the discipline which uses logical inference ( proofs ) to arrive at truths about mathematical objects ( numbers , functions , sets , etc ) under some agreed upon set of axioms . 
  deductive reasoning and mathematics can be * employed * to make arguments for certain scientific theories , but the predictions are the theories themselves ( they may be expressed with mathematical mechanisms ) . 
  string theory is an especially silly example because it makes virtually no testable predictions , and we have no idea whether it is an adequate explanation of the phenomena . 
  just because mathematical reasoning was used to construct the theory does n't imply that the theory was a * consequence * of mathematics . 
  essentially mathematics concerns abstract objects and human constructs , while scientific theories concern the nature of reality . 
  the former can be used to reason about the latter , but it in no way conditions it . 
  we 're losing the thread here - how does anything you said relate to the nature of morality ? 
  my stance is that i 've proven it is possible for a human construct , a set of ideas like mathematics and morality , to have no impact on the nature of reality , whether we are able to formally reason about it or not ( so it 's actually an even stronger position than my initial one , such pointed out the informal nature of moral theories ) . 
   you can write safe , bug-free code in c but you ca n't be lazy about it . 
  you can do it in any language , it 's just that c makes it extremely hard and encourages bad practices . 
  if you think there 's no difference between say rust and c you 're delusional , and if you agree that there is surely then c * is * part of the problem . 
   guys i 've never heard of rust, 
  it 's completely possible to design fast and safe languages . 
  c and c++ encourage very unsafe practices and to think we have n't learned anything new about systems language design in decades is silly . 
  i do n't think such assumptions are necessary . 
  what would you be assuming ? 
  science can account for faulty sensory experience ( that 's why we have statistics ) , and even more importantly , scientists do n't need an interest in ontology . 
  why should a biologist care if his observations are a result of a simulation or ` real ' ? 
  ( i mean except for obvious , * holy shit nothing is real * personal reasons ) it does n't impact his science in any way - except his discoveries are now valid for that simulation and not ` reality ' - but there 's no colloquial notion of reality needed in science at all . 
  * philosophically * it is an important idea . 
  scientifically , irrelevant . 
  now regarding the discussion about morality . 
  your analogy with economics is faulty . 
  economics produces models of economic behavior that can be tested for their predictive power . 
  morality is prescriptive - this is ` good ' and this is ` bad ' - and it fails as a scientific theory both to predict behavior , and it is simply a bad idea because it 's assigning subjective experience ( ` this feels right ' ) the status of an objective fact ( ` this * is * right ) . 
  to summarize exploring moral theories can be useful for society , but it 's simply exploring which behaviors are adopted for which reasons and how - but that 's decision theory , not philosophy . 
  sure , but my point was n't that rust * today * is as fast as c++ - it was that there 's nothing about the language which prohibit it being as fast . 
  essentially i was contesting your claim that having a safer language means sacrificing performance . 
  good job dude !, 
   your gh page looks impressive , i 'm happy there are pioneers like you working on the language . 
  i agree with most of what you 've said now . 
   do you agree on this point ? 
  if not , please explain what mechanism you use to authenticate the value of evidence etc. 
   the truth is that we ca n't derive derive facts without accepting certain values . 
  you 'll have to be more specific here . 
  i do n't see any need to ` value ' empirical data - it just has to exist , so we can reason about it . 
  you create a hypothesis h which predicts event e under condition t. ` h * t =  e ` . 
  you create an experiment and see whether ` t =  e ` . 
  if that fails , h must be false . 
  no values needed there , it 's just logical inference !, 
  it 's obviously more complicated in real life , but that 's the crux of it . 
   ... likewise , it 's irrelevant to the point i 'm trying to make . 
  i thought your entire point was the cartesian ` demon ' argument - that something might be out there deceiving our senses , and that we need some kind of * irrational trust * ( ` value ' ) in our senses to be able to conduct any kind of inquiry . 
  to which my reply was , no , it 's perfectly fine , because science ultimately does n't care if it 's studying ` real ' or ` demonic ' phenomena . 
   why could n't a moral framework - even a shitty one - produce models of moral behaviour that could be tested for their predictive power ? 
  models are descriptive , moral theories are prescriptive , therefore you can not test them in the same way . 
  you can test the effectiveness of some mechanism of * enforcing certain values * , you can test how those values lead to certain behaviors , but `` testing a moral framework '' is meaningless . 
  what metric would you use to test the golden rule , for example ? 
  how willing people are to adopt it , or what happens when they do ? 
   beating children, 
  once again , what you 're testing here is effectiveness of a parenting method , not a moral framework . 
   but i feel as though i 've exhausted my explanatory capabilities repeating and rephrasing the same points on axioms, 
  maybe you should turn inwards and re-examine your own definitions of morality , moral frameworks , values , axioms , testing , and so on . 
  please realize that testing the effectiveness of certain values ( such as beating children ) on other values ( such as ` well functioning adults ' ) * is * ( sort of ) a scientific endeavor - but assuming that you can objectively , absolutely prove that a certain value is ` correct ' - is not . 
  you always need a preexisting definition of what is ` right ' - of * what your moral framework * is actually trying to achieve . 
  then , it comes to concrete terms . 
  i have no problems with using stuff like `` empathy '' for those preexisting definitions , and then basing judgements on that . 
  but you have to admit that this value is not floating out there in the material world just waiting to be discovered , and that it 's not implicated by some mathematatical rules - but it 's there because it ** makes you feel good ** , and leads to values ** you find good ** ( well-functioning society , well-being of others , and so on ) . 
   much of your response is extraneous material that does n't really have much to do with what i 'm trying to say . 
  half of it is probably because i 've lost track of the thread of the discussion honestly . 
  i see science as a continuing pursuit of understanding of natural phenomena . 
  of course you need to ` value evidence ' and ` value logic ' because in the end that 's * what you 're studying . 
  * you ca n't study anything without accepting logic and mathematics ( because not doing so amounts to accepting paradoxes , that something can be both true and false at the same time ) - and when you 're studying nature you have to ` place value ' in it . 
  perhaps you could try being more precise about what you mean by ` value ' and ` axiom ' . 
  also , your example does n't really make sense as a criticism of logic . 
  it 's a perfectly valid conclusion , you just had incorrect premises , which had to be corrected by further experimentation or theorizing . 
  scientists are wrong all the time but so what ? 
  ultimately your example is a problem of neither science nor logic - but belief .
