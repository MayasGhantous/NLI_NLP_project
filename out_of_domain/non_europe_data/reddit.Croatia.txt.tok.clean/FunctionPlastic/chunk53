  private corporate profit, 
  pure academic interest ( with pressures to produce results and achieve excellence of course ), 
  my argument is that they lead to different forms of research , and that we should n't undercut public spending on science because we need it as well . 
  without hard data which that relying exclusively on the 1st one is the best for us all , and with quite strong evidence that it is not ( all the publicly-funded programs that were only later monetized for the benefit of everyone ) -- i still hold that we must fund public science . 
  another argument is that everyone benefits off it . 
   and at most this could account for an increase of a couple of percentage points . 
  ok , did n't know that . 
   i 'd also like to add that government research may have initially created things like the internet and transistors , but it was the research and investment of private industry that turned those things into the myriad products that have actually had a material effect on our daily lives . 
  which is fine , as long as we still fund this type of research so everyone benefits from it -- both companies and citizens . 
   sounds amazing as a human-readable , portable way for compilers to store syntax trees for later retrieval or for debugging . 
  i think you just discovered syntax trees . 
  and the universe could 've been created half a second ago . 
  i do n't really see how thisis relevant to some serious discussion about consciousness as it 's blind guessing . 
  i definitely recommend an intel chip with integrated graphics . 
  they can play games these days , and have excellent linux support . 
  you can always upgrade to discrete later if you feel like it . 
  i was quite unsatisfied that i went with a full amd build before , now i 'm even more ... 
  what does this mean ? 
  aside from it being literally over, 
   notably , what the go authors meant by systems is different than what the rust authors meant , thus the confusion, 
  can you elaborate ? 
   english letters, 
  is n't the second case is also utilitarian , if the agent finds utility in more autonomous agents, 
  yes they can lol . 
  the board votes on these issues . 
  the implicit criteria can be some utility , or virtue , or tradition , for example -- usually the terms that the ` moral ' umbrella is associated with . 
  how can debian alone be more than 6 times the cost of the * kernel * ? 
  are they counting the development of all the software included in the repos , and not just the packaging efforts ? 
  how exactly does this work , could you elaborate ? 
  your company for example needs the kernel for a project , so instead of just cloning it once , making required fixes ( for custom hardware perhaps ) -- you have chosen to contirbute directly to upstream and then benefit from what exactly ? 
  awesome , thanks a lot . 
  well you can , especially in serious discussions . 
  `` we prefer to make africans better off ** therefore ** we ought to invest in vaccines '' -- an example . 
  again you could go a level deeper and establish some moral framework like utilitarianism , and derive your conclusions from there . 
  yeah , exactly , when you get to the bottom of it it 's just our innate preferences for certain outcomes combined with our ability to verbalize them . 
  why did you think that ? 
  he is a right wing troll , he constantly does that , one of the few redditors i know by name and do n't have tagged, 
  well there 's only one dealer and his name is apparently ` lik ' , try to get his contacts . 
  it should be easy though as everybody seems to know him, 
  what 's dipping ? 
   so it 's about immutability , not higher order functions . 
  no , functional programming is a matter of style -- structuring code by writing and composing smaller functions . 
  higher order functions are ** required ** for that , while immutability is not . 
  case in point : ocaml is functional , but also imperative and immutable . 
  only * pure * functional programming requires immutability . 
  why do so many people assume he 's a she ? 
  was there misinformation spread at some moment ? 
  oh , thanks, 
  i always get the impression that everybody in the us is so obsessed with looks . 
  i mean your high schools and colleges seem to be uber-competetive compared to europe ( here we do n't even have a notion of popularity as some scale people talk about ) . 
  and yet the average person / kid is obese . 
  weird . 
  could you explain what you mean ? 
  thanks . 
  i know about this sub , i just thought there was something specific about / r/television that poster was referring to ( if there was , i still do n't get it ) . 
  just a warning if you were planning on browsing further : this is one of those countless racist ( `` human biodiversity '' ) blogs . 
  if that 's your thing , go ahead , but these guys are basically as boring as racists get , not even funny : blaming obama and welfare for everything . 
  it 's as if a republican , a ron paul supporter ( they even use ` internet libertarianism ' nonironically ) , an mra , and a white supremacist started writing together . 
   i love the fact that i know where all the racists are , where all the sexists are , and where all the homophobes are . 
  yeah , they 're on the most popular subreddits . 
  the right to discriminate views ( censor ) is one of the most important for communities to form and function . 
  take a neutral example of a hobbyist electronics forum . 
  is it moral for the moderators to filter out harassment , personal attacks , and racism/sexism ? 
  yes it fucking is because such content exclusively destroys the community . 
  it starts alienating legitimate contributors , and attracting those that just contribute to the community 's detriment . 
  i used to think that reddit had this problem figured out ( well , conceptually ) -- subreddits were simply communities for themselves , and they * were * allowed to discriminate to set their own direction . 
  however , in the light of recent events , we have all seen that this idealistic notion was completely wrong : hate spreads , hate infects other users , and hate drives people away from reddit in general . 
  i 'm all up for open debate , but there has to be a set of minimum ** standards ** both for reddit 's and its users ' sake !, 
  realistically , will anyone 's rights to discuss * ideas * be hurt by that ? 
  can you really imagine being banned for discussing , say , conservativism , or communism ? 
  heck no !, 
  that 's what reddit 's for . 
  but a sub that 's basically dedicated to harassment and hate is indefensible . 
   i 'm pretty sure that real `` currying '' is something that happens in lazy-evaluation languages . 
  well you 're wrong . 
  if we look at currying as a process , not as a concept in general , it means converting a function which accepts a * tuple of arguments * ( all functions of multiple arguments in javascript , by default ) , into a function which accepts a * single argument * -- the first member of the tuple -- and returns a function which also accepts a single argument -- the second member of the tuple -- and so on , until the last function accepts the last member of the tuple , and returns the result of the original function . 
  this is useful for functions like ` map f list ` , where you can create more concrete versions like ` addone = map ( +1 ) ` which then just accepts a single list and adds one to all elements ( e.g. 
  ` addone [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ` instead of ` map ( +1 ) [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ` ) . 
  this is similar to implementation hiding , i.e. 
  abstraction in reverse . 
  lazy evaluation means that expressions are computed only when they are immediately needed . 
  nothing precludes a strict ( non-lazy ) language from leveraging currying . 
  edit : elaborated, 
   who cares about functional programming when you just want referential transparency ? 
  and this is where the argument falls apart . 
  referential transparency is n't a requirement for functional languages -- ocaml is functional but it also allows for side-effects , for example . 
  functional programming is an example of an aptly-named paradigm -- it 's clear that it refers to a * way of programming * using many small higher-order functions . 
  oop is simply a problematic , undefineable term per se , it does n't invalidate the general concept of a paradigm . 
  what more do you want me to say ? 
  lazy evaluation simply has nothing to do with currying , it 's an orthogonal , independent concept ... 
  ok you have a point , i 've edited my post . 
  it 's just a bit hard to formulate because the ideas have no relation to one another , so basically i just explained each one in turn and wrote what i did before . 
   predominantly using function composition, 
  i did n't exclude that from my definition . 
  though i would n't call it `` predominant '' -- it 's just one of the supported higher-order operations . 
  and they 've been around for years , yet nothing 's changed . 
  what the fuck is this, 
  this is the opposite of rms ? 
  wait are you joking ? 
  you 're a radi\u0107 ?
