  i do n't even know when the episodes get out honestly . 
  and it does n't really matter , if you 're an avid fan ( which i 'm not , i only followed breaking bad really closely ) , then you only care about the delay * between * the episodes which is the same . 
   the sps player wo n't advance through the commercial breaks without playing the commercials . 
  ca n't be skipped . 
  hulu has new sp episodes as soon as they air . 
  i 've been using that site * for years * and i 've never seen a commercial . 
  maybe one or two times , but it seemed almost accidental . 
  edit : grammar, 
  that 's really nice , hope you have a good time  is n't the ` real south park ' in colorado tho ? 
   so it 's all just part of the deal with hulu , therefore only affecting us users . 
  ah , well . 
  honestly we usually have it much worse . 
  i 'm extra glad for south park tho , but i also think it 's quite a huge cultural/intellectual export by the us , i do n't know whether you guys realize how seriously this show is taken here . 
  ( i do n't mean literally seriously ), 
   researchers in many fields insist that their teaching experience , or their work building actually working prototypes and maintaining them over the long run , has been instrumental to their most solid research results . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  you seriously do n't want to pd it . 
  look up [ creative commons ] ( http://creativecommons.org/ ) , this is what you 're probably *** really *** looking for . 
  anyway could you link me a description of your project , i 'm interested to learn more about it ? 
  also , look up [ wikibooks ] ( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/wikibooks:what_is_wikibooks ) , maybe you can instead contribute/create it there ? 
  first off , ianal . 
  secondly , i see no need for you to actually * employ * these volunteers . 
  i contribute code to open source projects for example , but they 're not my employers : it 's and equitable relationship between me and the project . 
  ** p.s. 
  ** please use more descriptive thread titles in the future, 
  european ? 
  feel you so hard, 
  it 's very popular to be a contrarian but you have n't really thought this through . 
  a huge part of the science that gets done ** is actually about people . 
  yeah we could 've * not * sent any humans to space . 
  but then a ) obviously would n't be able to b ) would n't have all the knowledge about people in space c ) would n't have all the amazin tech required to actually achieve that and most importantly d ) would n't have many amazing spinoff technologies . 
  honestly that 's why you just downvote and do n't engage them . 
  i mean anyone with a bit of education can see what a load of crap that was so why bother ? 
   for example , my compiler interprets '' \\ n '' ( a sequence of backslash and character `` n '' ) in a string literal as '' \\ n '' ( a newline character in this case ) . 
  if you think about this , you would find this a little bit weird , because it does not have information as to the actual ascii character code for '' \\ n '' . 
  the information about the character code is not present in the source code but passed on from a compiler compiling the compiler . 
  newline characters of my compiler can be traced back to gcc which compiled mine . 
  what is he referring to by the compiler not having information about the ascii code for / n ? 
  i do n't get how this entire part is analogous to the ken thompson hack . 
   stalin, 
  what the fuck dude ? 
  could you give more details ? 
  where do you work , what do you work on , what 's the pay ? 
  the modern concept of freedom usually excludes the freedom to enslave others , kill , etc. 
  gpl-style software freedom is analogous in that way . 
   if the intent is to buy-off foreign governments in order to further the interests of world powers, 
  as in ... capitalist interests ? 
  lol, 
  ako ti to \u017eeli\u0161 vjerovati ja nemam problem s time . 
  sorry how is that related to howl 's moving castle ? 
  there was no such reveal that i remember , they just removed spells from certain characters and ended the war . 
  honestly i do n't see it . 
  i 've skimmed both the film and book wiki pages , and they 're a bit confusing as to what 's going on . 
  it seems to me that the plot is in a parallel universe , to which howl came from our own . 
  he grew up in our wales and now spends most of his time there , for some reason . 
  it does n't seem like the worlds are chronologically or causally correlated at all . 
  uh the war that 's central to the plot in the movie ? 
  i did n't read the book . 
  i do n't get it , do you mean pure as immutable ? 
  honestly i sort of consider that cheating . 
  i mean if we 're comparing languages for speed , then i 'm interested in * that language * , not * c * . 
  any language can call c , if we allow for that it 's a pretty meaningless comparison . 
  ok i actually agree with you that the criteria for what gets benchmarked should be realistic code . 
  i didi n't consider that , and was thinking in an absolute `` anything can be written in c '' way . 
   there are open source project owners, 
  what is this ? 
  how is that related at all ? 
  you can create extra ugly ui and bad ux no matter which framework . 
   qt and gtk should always be used in a such a way that the ui simply follows the theme the user set up . 
  no you do n't understand , a visual theme is just one small part of ui/ux . 
  it 's about what the widgets are , their arrangement and relation , the transitions , the different screens , etc etc. 
  you can have the prettiest colors ever but ui can still be terrible . 
   waaah why wo n't they allow private companies to break the law and take from the community without giving back, 
  i rarely say this , but fuck you . 
  i just do n't get america . 
  this sounds 18th-century-like, 
  so basically the literature department decided to troll the science department and blame it on the philosophy one ? 
   i base my understanding of the world on reddit thread titles, 
  i do n't know why this is being downvoted . 
  socialists would agree with you . 
  the definition of socialism is clear : proletarian ownership of the means of production , either directly via cooperatives or inderictly via the state . 
  no amount of welfare can nullify capitalism . 
  but my ... extremely useful feature ? 
  nonono , torvalds is way too sane for the first and the last one . 
  he 's an asshole sometimes , but very predictably so . 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's what he meant by `` this is n't nihilism '', 
  do you see a difference between `` black people ca n't use this toilet '' and `` we are going to spend more money in order to help black people get involved with software development '' ? 
  they 're * both discrimination . 
  * the first rule discriminates against black people , and the second against white people . 
  but if you agree that black people are disadvantaged in certain ways , an argument can easily be made that deciding to spend your money in a way that offsets said disadvantage is a good thing to do , even if less money can be spent on promoting to white people . 
  i 'm not talking about jobs , but promotion programs and workshops, 
  holy shit * thank you . 
  * i totally forgot about that movie , i 'll be rewatching the shit out of it !, 
  but more importantly : did you read the visual novel ? 
  it 's beautiful . 
  way more gripping and emotional than the film as i remember it . 
  yeah , by [ neil gaiman ] ( http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/comics/stardust/ ) . 
  def recommend , the illustrations are beautiful as well, 
  w-what ? 
  that sounds superillegal,
