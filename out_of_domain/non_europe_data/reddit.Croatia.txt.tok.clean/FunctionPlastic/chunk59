  spotted the serbojugochetnik, 
  holy shit lol username definitely checks out, 
  yes yes i know , that was a joke . 
  in croatia neologisms like that are very popular among the nationalists , they usually call anyone they dislike that even though none of the terms actually apply to that specific person except maybe the `` jugo '' part lol . 
  yep they do , but i 'm a croat so this is what first popped to mind  also calling others names is common , but i think that unironically stringing together four or more mutually exclusive adjectives is a uniquely croatian thing, 
  what a load of bullshit . 
  this is an ad . 
  they charge for actual logos . 
  you can download ** a handful of dumb symbols with background images ** , which is completely useless lol . 
  reddit wants to believe that stuff like prostitution and porn are `` just voluntary services exchanged between adults it 's totally ethical m8 ! '', 
  see any ama thread with a prostitute or porn star , if it adheres to this narrative it gets very popular on reddit . 
  but lurk some women 's sub where they talk about sex work and it 's much more closer to reality with people actually caring for you and telling you the truth about how exploitative , stressful , and demeaning those industries are . 
  but yeah if someone is literally flirting with a sex worker in their ama , i guess they 're no different than people who hire them and do n't really care about their wellbeing . 
  but all amas are pr/marketing stunts you do realize this ? 
  caution and awareness are natural responses to realities of sex work . 
  celebrating and pretending there 's nothing wrong with it , even twisting it to sound like you 're heroically battling `` the social stigma associated with sex work '' , is not . 
  i could believe that many of these porn stars and high-end prostitutes are sincere when they converse with reddit , but they make up a very small amount of sex workers . 
  generalizing that to `` all sex workers are motivated and enthusiastic individuals '' is wrong and immoral . 
   imagine if a cs program only used cobol or basic to teach with , never touching c++ , c # , python , ruby or any modern language . 
  their graduates would be quite unhappy with that . 
  this is a strawman . 
  do you really think those languages are better suited for studying core computer science concepts ? 
  wait i did n't express myself clearly : by `` those languages '' i meant cobol and basic . 
  my argument is that you can only learn about stuff like first-order functions , types , and practically everything relevant to newer cs by using languages like python and c++ . 
  this is n't true for vcs . 
  they 're just tools . 
  languages on the other hand are about relevant concepts , and study of languages belongs under cs . 
   as i would not consider newer cs concepts as `` core computer science concepts '' . 
  is n't that sort of contrary to what the word `` new '' means ? 
   what ? 
  you could just as easily make the same argument about several modern languages , that they are just tools . 
  i 'm talking about oop courses , functional programming courses , fundamental concepts like structured programming , data structures which are probably hard to define in basic and cobol ( ** although i do not know those languages ** ) -- these things sound like they ** require modern languages to practically teach . 
   furthermore , i could make a similar argument about vcs systems , that one could use them to teach core cs concepts such as graph theory , atomic operations , and concurrent access problems . 
  then it 's not really a `` how to use vcs '' course op seems to have implied . 
   to take it a step further , some other redditor suggested that schools have students implement their own basic vcs system , which i think would be an excellent way to teach core cs concepts while simultaneously giving them basic proficiency with it . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are many projects like this in various unis . 
   literally official strategy for destroying comptetition and open standards, 
  no i 100 % agree with you . 
  i do n't think this is an example of triple e . but the poster i replied to was denying it was even a thing - it was a ** huge ** thing that must not he labeled as a meme !, 
  furthermore , the downvotes and upvotes are showing a clear bias , not critical thought . 
  yeah these are just feel-good anecdotes . 
  statistically an extremely hot chick somewhere has a crush on someone below average . 
  in fact i 'm sure many do . 
  but lol that 's very unlikely to ever actually happen , and on average people can objectively agree on who is hot and who is n't no matter how they themselves look , and usually the hot ones get the most attention . 
  it 's just a biological fact . 
  sure it 's not impossible for less than good looking people to get laid it 's just * harder and rarer . 
  you 're defending anecdotes with more anecdotes . 
  i never said there are n't other factors . 
  if you have lots of sex because of your personality fucking great for you man . 
  but by definition most people are not exceptionally interesting/popular , and even more people are primarily interested in looks . 
  the concept of physical attractiveness is so entrenched in our societies . 
  again , many people * have to * settle for someone who is n't beautiful . 
  but that does n't mean that they ca n't tell who is or is n't physically attractive . 
  and it does n't mean that they have unsatisfactory relationships . 
  but attractive people choose attractive people . 
  there 's tonnes of research about this , i suggest you start with : http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty#t-4249, 
   feature-based funding platforms such as kickstarter have become popular among open source developers . 
  however , in my opinion , pledging on specific features can create conflicts of interest , and neglects the maintenance aspect of software development, 
  i get the maintenance part , but where do conflicts of interest tend to arise ? 
  reddit and 4chan use the term to refer to any inclusive activist and ** you ** know it . 
  / pol / loves the term just as much as / g / does , or reactionary subs . 
  but when they get called out on it , it suddenly gets reduced to a few examples of people flipping out . 
  nope , no pasaran , it 's very obviously a reactionary slur-word aimed at anti-racists and anti-sexits in general . 
  if you dismiss all racists because they make you uncomfortable then yeah the world looks like a pretty good place . 
  but that 's completely ridiculous . 
  you ca n't just ignore examples you disagree with . 
  what about reactionary subreddits ? 
  would you argue tumblr in action serves any purpose other than demonizong social justice as a whole ? 
  or the hordes of `` race realists '' ? 
  4chan is one of the central breeding grounds and organizing places for racist attacks and movements , they 're one of the main forces who pushed the term sjw into acceptance in the first place . 
  it 's absolutely about using events like `` donglegate '' as a charade for a large-scale pushback against inclusory politics . 
  i would personally prefer `` regressive '' if those were the only two options , as i do n't necessarily have problems with their goals : only their means and priorities . 
  additionally , `` social marxist '' looks eerily like `` cultural marxist '' , which is now a term employed almost exclusively by a fringe cross section of the extreme right and conspiracy theorists ( infowars , / pol / , etc ) -- it 's much more irredeemable than `` sjw '' . 
  this is a pretty good starting point for a left-wing critique of these `` regressives '' : http://fredrikdeboer.com/2015/12/22/yes-virginia-there-is-a-left-wing-reform-movement/ , for anyone interested . 
  note : it 's not anti-racist and anti-sexist sentiments being argued against , it 's their * tactics * and mechanisms of action . 
  reddit is predictably pretending this is some deep , insightful criticism . 
  literally one of the first sentences of his `` critique '' :, 
   in case there is still doubt that brown was , at worst , justifiably killed , and at the best , a thug , the grand jury cleared wilson of any wrongdoing . 
  this is n't about what brown did or did n't do , this is about it being * so obviously racist * to simply disregard ** a person 's fucking life ** because they 're black ( we can talk about this once the police start murdering white teenagers like this ) . 
  oh and a jury did n't convict the killer , means no wrong was done !, 
  well the jury did n't convict kkk murderers either because guess what the jury is n't supposed to be the arbiter of objective reality and truth , but a voice of the people . 
  not an american but i 'm pretty sure that literally taking federal property with guns and every news outlet and drones documenting the process , is a bit clearer situation than a cop killing an unarmed black teenager saying `` he attacked me '' with 0 witnesses in a country where black people are killed by the cops who lie about it ** all the time . 
  ** like there 's a frontpaged article i think right now about an entire police department rigging their recording equipment . 
  just the sheer unwillingness to even consider that taking the life of a black teenager might be problematic and not ** justified ** perfectly exemplifies how prevalent racism is on reddit . 
  that is a racist thing to say . 
  i do n't think ` racist ' can be used as a binary label like that for the whole person , and i do n't believe the kid posts on stormfront or goes to nazi rallies . 
  you do n't own the means of production so have fun starving tho ( if you by any chance actually do own some , substitute for `` majority '' ), 
  on an article about right wingers beating up children , leftists are to blame . 
  i expected nothing less of / r/worldnews . 
  you are literally replying to a guy siding with the nazis, 
   fucking finally . 
  i have waited for this . 
  literally below your post . 
  or , this entire thread . 
  i meant * literally * literally . 
  like , you know , ** actual literal do n't - know-how-else-to-put-it migrant-children-beating swastika-wearing ** *** nazi . 
  *** that 's what i meant by `` nazi '' if it was n't clear . 
  and this guy called them justified . 
  so he 's ** literally ** siding with the ** actual nazis . 
  ** does n't get more black and white than this .
