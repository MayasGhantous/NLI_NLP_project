  what does not make sense there ? 
  this already ** was ** the policy at all places i worked at , even . 
  the romantic part - there 's no policing involved . 
  it 's just a guideline that makes sense as well . 
   i think a lot of nerdy `` computer guys '' would like to see more females in industry because it would improve the sex ratio . 
  probably nicer to look at than a bunch of unwashed dudes too - the guys might even step up their fashion and grooming game a bit , in order to impress the girls . 
  i think you 're missing the point here . 
  it 's about lacking a perspective from such a huge group of people , and how it negatively impacts women as well . 
  and there 's no need to insult software developers . 
  the stereotype might be stronger where you live but here we 're just normal guys , nerds are associated with comic books and star wars mostly . 
  except statistics does n't agree : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/18/gun-ownership-gun-deaths-study + http://steve.cooleysekula.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/guns.png . 
   ideologically , that sounds like a violation of the non-aggression principle . 
  ideologies can be poisonous in these amounts , i suggest taking yourself less seriously as a first step . 
  for god 's sake there 's a white power sub . 
  anti-gay people should n't really surprise you . 
   meaning libertarians against net neutrality legislation , not ` net neutrality ' itself, 
  this has no meaning . 
  net neutrality is legislation . 
  it 's not some `` dreamy principle '' , it 's an actual thing you have to fight for and legislate . 
  ah , that 's what i needed in a sub about a series i like . 
  someone 's ideology . 
  woah , sorry , completely misunderstood the title . 
  i am not a linux-specific game developer , in fact i only developed html5 games as a hobby ( but that 's unrelated ) . 
  i thought this was about users and not developers . 
  still however , i think linux should be supported , it 's definitely gaining a lot of steam ( heh ) in the gaming community and more and more games are expected to be ported to it . 
  it 's the duty of developers and people who create these events to make portable applications a * rule * not an exception . 
  with proper software development techniques - this should be easy . 
  your game should n't even * have * os-specific code - it should depend on an abstraction that deals with os details . 
  linux already has all the required libraries to make the engines work - all that is needed is better cooperation from hardware manufacturers ( i can compliment intel here , except in this small case  ) , and of course incentive to engine and game developers . 
  yeah i see where you are coming from . 
  you see net neutrality as a value - like freedom of speech or equal rights - and think that it 's common sense that net neutrality is beneficial or even necessary for a well functioning internet . 
  however , at its core it is really based in regulation - forcing corporations to submit to the public interest at the expense of their own potential profits - which are unethical , harmful , deceitful , etc. 
  right-wing , american libertarians ** would not ** agree with that . 
  they have different solutions which usually boil down to `` free market fixes itself '' , or that it is unethical to force corporations to do stuff for the public , or that net neutrality is bad i suppose . 
  personally i think that 's bullshit and have no sympathy for the `` poor corporations '' . 
  the free market has its limits ( would you let corporations just pollute the environment for the sake of profit ) and private interest rarely aligns with what is good for the rest of society . 
  this is the perfect example of that . 
   not all data needs to be transferred at the same speed . 
  that 's not net neutrality though : http://youtu.be/wtt2asv8wdw . 
  you pay for data . 
  content providers pay to get it to you . 
  that 's it , no additional charges that discriminate against types of content because it will always result in something not beneficial for the consumer on both ends - and only amounts to isps profiting without actually adding any additional value . 
  what do you think would be the benefits of discriminating data ? 
  what would we gain for it ? 
  also are you not paying attention to what is going on ? 
  cable companies * already have a monopoly and they 're doing an absolutely terrible job with massive profits . 
  if you do n't mind being robbed and getting an even more awful internet thats your problem . 
  is n't one of the first things hitler does in his political text redefining socialism to mean the exact opposite and dissing marx ? 
  pretty sure that the name was just a leftover from times where it would gather people . 
  fascists did that as well until they got power , and then they went to the right . 
   someone forgot atlas shrugged, 
  yes if only . 
   that sounds so fucking boring, 
  it 's almost as if we were forcing you to read this . 
  no , it 's entirely your decision to be an asshole . 
  no seriously watch that video . 
  the only correct answer to my question is ** nothing but worse internet and more powerful isps ** - which is the one thing we * do n't * need . 
  i ca n't stress this enough - you ca n't approach this debate with the pov that removing net neutrality might be good for the society in any conceivable way , at least here . 
  it wont . 
  they have already demonstrated that they just want more power and money , profiting off public infrastructure and research , double-charging , definitely ruining internet and stifling innovation . 
  ** that 's ** where the debating even starts , at least here where people are informed . 
  and no offense but you just come off as uninformed . 
  that 's really easy to fix with so many resources available to you , just google and youtube away . 
  yes , i agree , 
  and thank you , it really is important to get linux more recognition in consumer/desktop industries . 
  you can always visit / r/linux _ gaming if you need input i suppose . 
   will congress tighten regulations ? 
  no no no !, 
  the free market will fix it !, 
  if bees are dying that 's because they 're not * working hard enough * . 
  i did n't know authors these days used office word processing programs , i thought there were specific programs that help you deal with chapters , characters , etc. . . 
  he should learn vim . 
  i 'm not talking about formatting , [ myintellectisbored ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2596up/til_george_rr_martin_writes_all_his_novels_in_dos/chf642p ) described exactly what i meant :, 
   fiction authors have programs that allow for notes , character development and bios , plot development . 
  i 'm sure it works in your utopian fantasy land , especially if the majority of your cadre already denies climate science and other threats that require regulation anyway ( why change your ideology when you could just ignore the facts right ? ), 
  meanwhile in reality , corporations really do n't give a fuck and as they 've demonstrated time and time again can not be trusted with jack shit . 
  they 're there for profit . 
  people are not rational agents , they also have no power over corporations , and your freedom to make informed choices absolutely can be taken away from you with marketing , propaganda , violence - and who are we kidding most people do n't even care and choose convenience over all . 
  this has to be regulated or ** nothing will get done . 
  and please do n't get upset about the op , it was a joke . 
  or , you know , do n't . 
  strange to see my country mentioned randomly !, 
  are you from croatia , working in the us maybe ? 
  did you hold an online streaming presentation at s3 two years ago ? 
  til there are no subjects in slavic languages, 
   people always have been the foolish victims of deception and self-deception in politics , and they always will be until they have learnt to seek out the interests of some class or other behind all moral , religious , political and social phrases , declarations and promises . 
  lenin sounds like a smart guy . 
  do you think the future of humanity lies in technological modification of our bodies ? 
  at the point that ai is created , will human consciousness and existence make sense , would it be better if we combined both traits to form some sort of ubermensch ? 
  how will the fact that the ai can essentially exist as a single instance , or multiple ones that could share data , affect the future ? 
  would you care to provide some directions about where can i learn more about this philosophical side of ai ? 
  i 'm a cs student and it 's one of my favorite subjects , the only problem being of course that it 's all actually just statistics and probably has nothing to do with actual biological intelligence , but at least it 's easy to trick yourself into believing that , 
  it seems like none of that could account for * experience * or * sensation * . 
  i can understand how such a system could make intelligent decisions , process and store information , but something is missing from our understanding because none if those things are connected to experience - i think a basic dumb piece of matter could be experiencing something without being intelligent , and vice versa . 
  there are gray areas , like self awareness , because awareness requires sensation . 
  i think , therefore i am , 
  edit : misspelling, 
  as i wrote above , the brain is not a computer because it can experience and sense . 
  nothing in the turing model explains that . 
  and there are more models of course ( oracles ) but as far as i can see they either rely in quantum effects , or magic .
