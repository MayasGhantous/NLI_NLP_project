  how did you like to pimp a butterfly ? 
  personally i like the more jazzy sound better , although the narrative structure of gkmc is amazing . 
  too soon, 
   that might be your interpretation but any consequentialist is going to disagree, 
  i 'm a consequentialist , i just disagree with you about what the consequences are . 
  consequences do n't stop at `` quantification of immediate damage '' . 
  no , the * real * consequences are answers to the question `` what happens to our society if we accept this as a norm ? '', 
   to say that the answer to the trolley problem dictates the answer to snatching people off the streets or not seems juvenile to me . 
  `` juvenile '' is not an argument . 
  if your criteria for morality is `` do the action that minimizes the amount of people killed in a situation '' , then organ harvesting ** is a logical consequence . 
  consequentialism and much of ethics is exactly about determining general moral systems from which you deduce about specific situations . 
  what you 're describing is more like skepticism/nihilism . 
  hahaha , you should 've followed up with `` and you might be not '' , 
  what 's the context here i do n't get it ? 
   these are all rappers who came up under how, 
  what does this mean ? 
  i 'm just not sure what ` how ' is ? 
  and how did they come up under it ? 
  except we 're mostly just slavs and that 's a myth . 
   12 ) while the critique of the regime of censorship do fall flat it is important to note that the power of censorship is significantly less powerful than more , for lack of a better word , constructive ( creation and destruction are just different lenses and always contain elements of each other ) culturally based projects and these projects should be accessible to oppressed peoples should not become stagnant cliques like bakunin 's secret pilots at the center of the storm, 
  could you expand on this ? 
  i do n't really understand what you mean by constructive nor the reference to bakunin, 
  could n't that be seven by sunny day real estate ? 
  always see them mentioned, 
  nice  i 'm totally new to emo music , i have n't heard that song above , but honestly i do n't really like it that much . 
  the melodies in seven are much more in my style . 
  wow , thanks !, 
  :d mineral is the second emo band who i 've listened to integrally , and the power of failing is my favorite emo album and probably in my top 10 fav albums generally . 
  i 'll definitely listen to the other stuff, 
  i got downvoted for mentioning that when people were salivating about their actions . 
  how come eminem is not on that list ? 
  i 'd say eminem , kanye , and kendrick, 
  like the constant talk about political correctness is not political ? 
  thanks hairyballs007 ,, 
   best thing to do is keep it between 40-80 % and never let it go below 20 % . 
  damn that 's gon na be bothersome a bit . 
   do you have an internal or replaceable battery ? 
  if it is replaceable who cares cause you can always get a new one . 
  it 's a galaxy a5 so i think it 's irreplaceable : s, 
   with fast charging , there 's nothing you can really do to stop it from happening, 
  what do you mean , stop what ? 
  deterioration ? 
  so i should buy a normal charger ? 
  says the guy who thinks he voluntarily came up with his confession . 
  you could easily be duller than him . 
  lol, 
  what the fuck is this ? 
  a whole package for literally 5 lines of code that do a completely trivial thing ? 
  `` this is really messing things up for a lot of people '' ?? 
  could you not use phrases nonnative speakers may not be familiar with in titles ? 
  keep it formal .

  holy shit the amount of paranoia and fear mongering in this thread, 
  right wing shitfest, 
  but there is no discussion . 
  `` btw here 's my completely politically clueless opinion . 
  it sounds contradictory but i put a btw in it so you know it 's legit '', 
  [ horseshoe theory ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory ) is the homeopathy of politics . 
  there is no discussion , just a huge reactionary circlejerk , i 'm just telling you shit your opinions are that 's all . 
  i 'm not interested in discussing shit with you . 
   hey spend two hours at our reactionary outrage echo chamber we created for ourselves, 
  nah i only have time to tell you guys how shit your opinions are . 
  but even if i had the time i 'd still rather gouge my eyes out than observe that shitfest . 
  so what ? 
  it adversely affects the uninformed , who often happen to be poor or some other disadvantage demographic . 
  this is called privilege . 
  you 're informed yourself , and you just do n't give a shit about people who are n't - often those who come from a disadvantaged background . 
  i 'm sorry what ? 
  was there no poverty or misinformation in socialist countries to prey upon ? 
  i started writing a longer response about rational behavior being a function of a stimulating environment , and in part a skill like any other , but i 'm just going to respond to you with a question that gets my point across better : ** is it not public knowledge that meth will fuck you up ? 
  now if you 're a hardline conservative who believes drug addicts sat down one day in their expensive home , decided `` fuck it , i might as well just live miserably and die soon in pain !, 
  '' , and then got what they deserved - we do n't have much to talk about . 
  but if you agree that a lot of what we attribute to simple personal choices is actually a function of the environment - then how can you not agree that the lottery is a ** unprivileged people tax ? 
  i believe that making fun of triggers and using terms like `` sjw '' is just a kneejerk reaction by the majority to avoid addressing their own privilege or engaging in the discussion . 
  easier to just yell people away . 
  can we agree that a choice can be less or more freely made ? 
  it 's a spectrum . 
  deciding to smoke cigarettes is likely to be a more freely-made decision than smoking meth , in a sense that the people who make up the meth-smoking demographic are by and large very disadvantaged and do n't have many options , while it 's not the case with smoking . 
  i believe we can change society in such a way to make choices in general more free for most people . 
  i would also want to change society in such a way that people would n't have to take up meth or cigarettes to feel better . 
  i mean that 's a pipe dream ( heh ) but i 'm just explaining where i stand morally on this issue , and by proxy i 'm blaming society for these things . 
  but this position also has nuance since it acknowledges both individual responsibility * and * social structures that shape us . 
  no but it 's pretty much a textbook example of irony , maybe you did n't see [ the relevant episode ?

  it 's interesting that they seem to follow two official bernie sanders accounts, 
  what kind of bullshit is this, 
  why are people upvoting this ? 
  it 's disgraceful, 
  eli5 who is this ? 
  i 'm even more confused now . 
  i mean why him ? 
  why did he have an ama ? 
  is he famous or something ? 
  other than that she 's also incredibly influential in today 's pop-ish music . 
  kanye sampled her in a few songs ( blood on the leaves ) , lana del rey covered her ( [ the other woman ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh8cjr_g3kk ) , [ do n't let me be misunderstood ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsmcbp-mqku ) ) -- and i 'm sure there are many , many more examples . 
   a few years ago , an article like this would 've been met with a ` duh ' , but reddit is heading in a much more different direction today than it was back then . 
  this is so true , especially for the default subs , and / r/europe ( no , not the white nationalist / r/european , but the ` legit ' one ) . 
  you can literally see posts which are indistinguishable from stormfront or / pol / . 
  and do n't get me started on playing the victim .
