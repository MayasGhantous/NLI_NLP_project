  you know , the actual right-wingers . 
  this contradicts basic facts of biology - people differ in intelligence and it has everything to do with nature , not as much as nurture ( can link sources if you want but this is very evident if you think about it - some people are smarter than other 's and that 's all there is to it ) . 
  solving pde 's has fuck all to do with intelligence . 
  it 's a skill that intelligence will help you be better at , like any other . 
  i absolutely agree with that person you quoted . 
  lots of people are underachievers . 
  many are not especially intelligent , but some are . 
  about the first part , i 'd say intelligence , all other things being equal ( like you have a happy childhood and normal brain chemistry ) , will be correlated more than randomly with achievements . 
  but that does n't necessarily mean an orderly work ethic . 
  in fact , i mostly see that in people of above-averge intelligence -- they actually need to be very organized and have tidy and thorough notes and they are conditioned to conform with the education system because that works for them . 
  but there is a smarter group of people with much more divergent approaches to life that often does n't include tidiness and compliance . 
  they can achieve without that , they want to achieve without that . 
  and then there 's very smart people who will underachieve because life is a random bitch . 
  ** they 're still smart ** is my point . 
   its not connected to your morality in any way . 
  you make the mistake that individual morality is relevant . 
  it is not . 
  bill gates may as well be the person who has objectively done the most good of all people , and that 's really commendable . 
  i want * systems * to be moral , not individuals . 
  this is an example of ** systemic disadvantage ** . 
  we should all be entitled to equal opportunities . 
   what are you advocating ? 
  a particular ethics that i believe to more fully address the needs of all people . 
  and by ethics i do mean just that : a moral philosophy . 
  a philosophy that does not concern itself with the virtue of an individual and then attacks or defends that , but with the system as a whole . 
   a private school is n't even an extravagant amount of wealth , its just upper middle class . 
  nobody is talking about billionaires here , you might be talking about an owner of a few local restaurants . 
  there is a clear divide between the rich and the poor , between the few and the many . 
  any amount of inequality in access to education is immoral . 
   in your world , should i be prevented from doing this , or should the public purse pay to bring all other children to the same level ? 
  i would say both for now , but i 'm not sure the first one is possible without other major changes which are kind of out of the scope of this discussion and very hard to implement under most current systems . 
  so yes , more public funding for education , specifically of younger people ( elementary through high school ) . 
  and of course not just more of the same , i have ideas about ideal education systems but they 're out of scope for now . 
   should i be prevented from helping my children with their homework , or from educating them myself ? 
  you ca n't and should n't be . 
  i do believe however in more informal education systems where you could , for example , teach kids who would benefit the most from your knowledge , while someone else teaches yours . 
  it 's not mutually exclusive . 
  i for example as a student teach kids about science and computing for free , and i get free informal education from my own peers and mentors too . 
  i 'm not american and i 'm not very familiar with your particular systems and problems , so i ca n't give you a list of concrete policies . 
  however i am in favor for both reform and more funding of the public education system for young people ( elementary through high school ) . 
  we need more peer education and more informal education . 
  how is that relevant ? 
  our system is not very good , we are on the european periphery , but there are areas we do excell at . 
  our students frequently top international maths and coding competitions and olympiads , and all of our education is completely free and the best schools and universities are public . 
   it 's only relevant because you brought up not being familiar with the system in the states . 
  i gave a very broad idea on the direction in which i would design an education system , and i said that because i think he assumed i was american and had a list of relative policy changes i would like to see . 
  i live in a country where education is completely free * already * and still want to change it tremendously -- i doubt anyone here ( judging by the amount of downvotes i 'm getting ) can even conceive of that kind of system really . 
  so that 's why i 'm talking broad strokes and values . 
  that 's not meaningless , it gets people thinking , and promotes my ideological underpinnings . 
   so they are free and public , what 's the college graduation rate like compared to the us ? 
  % of the whole population that have graduated or % of people who enroll and then make it until - which point exactly ? 
  3 years for a bachelor degree or 5 for a masters ? 
  either way for the whole population it 's like slightly above 15 % , but i doubt you can make much use of this number because it 's only relevant because of competition , i do n't think that `` produce a service economy workforce '' should be the goal of the education system to begin with so i do n't care about this number . 
  i do n't know the other percentages though but if it matters to you i can research it . 
   for example if the us graduated a higher percentage of it 's population than your system or vice versa would that be an indicator of which system is superior ? 
  well not really . 
  is it a more lenient system ? 
  does it have stricter entrance requirements but similar workload so the smarter people who got in naturally complete more of it in your system ? 
  is your primary and secondary education superior , but not your higher education ? 
  there would be many interpretations . 
  you need much more data than that . 
   i really do n't know btw , everyone has to establish what they value before we can answer the question of what metric to measure to figure out if we are being successful . 
  exactly , very true . 
  i 'm planning to write an article about the goals an education system should have and some general policies how we can get closer to that , however , in my native tongue . 
  but my ideas lean to developing character traits like assurance and curiosity , along with the * skill of studying and teaching others * , coupled with an encouraging project-based approach where you would maximize freedom of learning . 
  this , of course , requires much more emphasis on informal education , and less influence of the market demands on education output . 
  i 've seen the best individuals in educational programs which were equal and informal , and allowed us to set our own goals . 
  the other half of my answer focuses on association . 
  if by `` individuality '' you actually mean selfishness , then yes . 
   modern socialism is liberalism, 
  that 's not remotely true . 
  socialists views american liberalism as an essentially right-wing effort to coddle capitalism . 
   that 's a legal thing, 
  maybe some people do n't agree with the current conception of the state and its legal system and that 's not really an argument for them . 
   used to good effect to go after jews and blacks, 
  are you equating them with rapists ? 
   supporters of rape have just as much right to meet as supporters of video gaming, 
  what about isis rallies and propaganda meetings ? 
  do you see no harm in that ? 
  do n't worry . 
  they wo n't be * planning * anything . 
  they 'll just be * talking very persuasively * to a group of young alienated muslims . 
  ** why do you hate their freedom ? 
  what are you referring to ? 
   i never knew the whole right movement on 4chan was started by the gamer-gate thing . 
  4chan has always normalized extreme intolerance -- but it was apolitical and completely harmless unless you wanted to participate in the community . 
  however , even before gg , it started getting / pol/iticized . 
  the board / pol / basically attracted half of stormfront . 
  now one of the most popular boards on 4chan was taken over by * literal fucking nazis . 
  i remember the transition . 
  one month it was all * ron paul 2012 !, 
  ! 1 * and the next was ** gas the jews ** -- and no , not as a joke , as a literal , serious , accepted ideological norm there . 
  and they started `` invading '' other boards , primarily the video games board , since they were very afraid of sjws in the first place and normalized to reactionary ideas beforehand . 
  i would say the real turning point was anita sarkeesian 's series * tropes vs. women in videogames . 
  * for / g / it was the dongle gate scandal ( and the feminist programming language thing ) . 
  most of that was before gg . 
  to an outsider , these events may look completely trivial , but they are essentially mythologized on 4chan . 
  ** edit ** , to the guy who said that the racism is 90 % times a joke and then deleted his comment :, 
  ah there 's always the guy who thinks it 's all a joke . 
  no it fucking is n't .
