  sure they may be joking with it on the surface sometimes , but the underlying assumptions are extremely politicized and right wing . 
  these people believe in white genocide , these people casually discuss strategies for ` cleansing europe ' , these people are literal nazis no fucking joke . 
  for every thread talking about how fun it would be to kill all the jews there are ten more spreading real nazi propaganda . 
  ** you ** must be new to / pol / if no one had link-dumped you 34589063 documentaries about why the holocaust did n't happen . 
  while simultaneously talking about the need to exterminate minorities . 
  there are multiple boards and if it specifically refers to / pol / it was always that way, 
  well it 's not completely true but it 's not entirely * bullshit * either . 
  the largest boards are very rightist . 
  / g / and / v / , for example . 
  there are boards like / sci / which , last time i was there , actively shat all over / pol / 's attempts to invade them in a vary calm and savvy manner , but that 's a small specific board anyway . 
  not only that , / pol / actively invaded other boards before gamergate . 
  no , fuck you , intolerance does n't have to be tolerated ( if feel the need to cry about me oppressing you because i said fuck you , you fell for it ) . 
  just like when people advocate more freedom they 're not advocating the freedom to murder . 
   that 's what you think, 
  no that 's like what dictionaries think . 
  and anyone who has any idea about politics . 
  some people may be deluded about what socialism and liberalism mean , but that does n't matter because those words have fucking definitions . 
  and i guarantee you , aside from bernie supporters , anyone calling themselves socialists probably knows what that means . 
  america is weird . 
   the same utopian stuff from the 1800 's that was totally ineffectual and in practice indistinguishable from liberal capitalism . 
  i do n't know what that means . 
  are you referring to pre-marxist utopian socialists like owen ? 
  and by liberal capitalism do you mean social democracy ? 
  because you can hardly draw parallels between the two . 
  and i do n't consider pre-marxists to be very relevant to anything except the history of these ideas . 
   none of you retards are doing anything remotely `` revolutionary '' or vaguely anti-capitalist . 
  i am so confused , who do you think i am ? 
   you 're just a different breed of liberalism critiquing itself while changing none of the underlying conditions because it 's a trendy thing to say, 
  buddy i 'm a borderline authoritarian communist i literally have no idea what you 're talking about, 
   then you do n't believe in free speech, 
  only when we have a society free of oppression can we have completely free speech , which is something we should want . 
  however i have a different view on how the society functions and how speech affects people than what is currently ideologically accepted . 
  speech can be oppressive and oppressed groups should not be expected to reason their way out of oppression . 
  i 'm perfectly aware you 're discussing a tactic . 
  but when you say that the tactic is wrong because it has been used against jews and blacks , and that it is also wrong when it is used against rapists , you are making an implicit assumption that there is an underlying reason why we should protect * both of those groups * . 
  i 'm saying there is n't any . 
  i understand the need for law to be consistent , and i want to protect the law . 
  so the state should handle these people , not vigilantes . 
  but even when we ca n't do that , handling them is more important than the rule of law , so even an inferior option like vigilantes threatening them is good . 
   so intolerance is cool as long as you 're intolerant of what you think of as intolerance . 
  rape , murder , racism , sexism , fascism and so on have to be intolerated . 
  yes . 
   maybe you can point me to the evidence that you have that op is a bigot besides liking a presidential candidate . 
  oh , right , that 's your only evidence . 
  i did n't even say that , check the username . 
  but if someone is an active / r/the _ donald poster that 's a pretty good fucking indication . 
   oh you think i 'm intolerant * just because i joined the nazi party ? 
  * how intolerant of you !, 
   so in response you want less freedom . 
  yes ? 
  freedom is not an absolutely good thing . 
  freedom to murder , rape , and harm society ** are freedoms ** . 
  and they need to be taken away . 
  mind you this is * basic political philosophy * . 
   can you please explain to me how you know op supports rape , murder , racism , sexism , and fascism just because he posts on / r/the _ donald ? 
  i mean , would n't that require you to stereotype him ? 
  not what i said . 
  again , i do n't give a shit about the op . 
  i responded to you explaining how the principles of tolerance and freedom can not be taken as absolutes . 
  from this point on you can assume i think the op is a nice smelling flower on a nice smelling flower field called / r/the _ donald or something , i really do n't care . 
   ah , right back to your strawman again . 
  again , can you explain to me how op posting in / r/the _ donald means he supports murder and rape ? 
  is that just basic political philosophy ? 
  again , this was proving the need for society to limit certain freedoms . 
  it 's an analogy about needing to limit certain types of tolerance . 
  you 're conflating performance competition and and basic structural injustices . 
  not all competition is necessarily a good thing , and it is often a driver of exploitation . 
  i do n't believe that controlling some of it is necessarily bad . 
   stamping out all forms of inequality means removing our humanity in the name of a lofty ideal that is likely folly . 
  this is handwavy reasoning . 
  why ? 
   a completely level playing field means everyone gets to be mediocre, 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by a completely level playing field . 
  our education system is completely public and free for everyone , but that 's not the reason for its problems , in fact commercialization would cause many more on top of those . 
   so you think we should criminalize speech ? 
  we 're talking about speech here . 
  you do realize that right ? 
  no , we 're strictly talking about tolerance in this thread , which is a social not a legal function . 
   how would you `` limit '' tolerance ? 
  by telling shitlords to fuck off . 
   we need to figure out what an optimal outcome is if we want an optimal system . 
  we are starting with the system before the outcome . 
  good point , i just do n't think that we need an actual number we would optimize for . 
  my `` preferred outcome '' is instilling a set of values , experiences , skills , and interests in people , so that they as free individuals can best utilize them to help society . 
  the values would be independent and critical thinking , cooperation and altruism , and very importantly curiosity . 
  experiences would include starting and finishing a project by yourself , including the required research , construction , measuring , and reporting to others ; then of course group work and division of labor . 
  skills and interests are very intuitive and do n't require enumerating , but the most important aspect is to * have a genuine interest in some socially useful thing . 
  * and that can be literature , technology , history , anything really just as long as it 's not guided by market principles . 
  i suggest you check out [ petnica ] ( http://petnica.rs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;itemid=41 ) . 
  their site is horrible , but it 's an example of a perfect educational institution in my opinion , except for one thing : it 's highly selective and slightly elitist . 
  i want ** everyone ** to have access to quality education , not just the select intelligent elites . 
   i would be fascinated to read such a thing . 
  unfortunately my language skills only extend to english ( sad i know ) . 
  most of my insight here is sadly a product of my own experiences , thoughts , and informal discussions with others . 
  if i find some useful article , i will try to link it to you in another response so you get a notification . 
  currently i do n't plan to write anything in english since i have too much on my hands . 
   perhaps this goes along with my ideas about how the internet can revolutionize education . 
  the internet would absolutely be a part of all of this . 
  i believe in self-paced , organic learning when it comes to things like math and coding . 
  but the revolutionary factor is always political , the internet in my model is merely a tool .
