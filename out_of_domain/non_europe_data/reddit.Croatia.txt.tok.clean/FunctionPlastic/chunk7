  well i obviously can not define it but since this is not academic discourse i do n't feel obligated to . 
  unless my narcissistic fears are true , then you can as well know exactly what i mean when i say sensation - the subjective experience that separates you from your environment and can allow for feedback - if you do n't know what i 'm trying to say then that is a complaint on a completely semantic level because * i am not trying to actually define the thing * , i 'm just trying to get the idea across , so we both know what i 'm referring to . 
  as far as i know , plants could sense as well . 
  so what i am taking about does not have much to do with our conception if intelligence , self awareness , or even consciousness , but might be a crucial component of those in increasing order ( this conjecture by me being completely useless in the scientific sense ) . 
  yes , of course , but i am not convinced that the only components we need for that are deterministic nand gates . 
   then clearly you are wrong about neurons . 
  since i did n't even claim anything about neurons i do n't see how that follows . 
  it was the person i was replying to that was making assumptions that neurons only add and subtract . 
  with my own knowledge i can already guarantee you that that is false . 
  they have non-linear activation functions for starters ( at least in anns which i 'm more familiar with than their biological inspiration ) . 
  there are also multiple types of neurons which we do * not * understand . 
  saying that the brain is a computer in our current understanding is the big assumption here , not me being skeptical of that claim . 
  even our understanding of computing is changing * rapidly * , you can not possibly make any such claims . 
    then clearly you can not experience or feel . 
  what ? 
  i explained what i meant in [ another comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/25cnbr/science_ama_series_we_are_researchers_at_the/chg5tkc ) . 
  she is purposefully robbing herself of her sense of responsibility and individuality . 
  that 's definitely a bad thing in itself , but who knows , maybe some people just were n't created to actually deal with reality . 
  since you are using the internet , created by the government , benefit from the roads and public infrastructure , benefit from countless innovations the public sector spawned , probably have or will benefit from the police or public courts - i assume you have ** no problem whatever ** about the moral issues surrounding taxation . 
  and from the rest of your post i conclude your also have no problem with welfare - but government inefficiency . 
  i agree that 's a problem in america . 
  i suggest concentrating on that . 
  you are posting this on the internet , paid for by tax dollars . 
  either you oppose it entirely or you prove that private charity is more efficient on that scale . 
  since you obviously do n't support oppose it entirely - you enjoy its benefits - good luck with proving anything . 
  why is it awful ? 
  it 's better because it prohibits creating non-free programs . 
  there 's also case declination , if that 's the english term for it , which is the equivalent for nouns . 
  personally i prefer it because it condenses more information in the word . 
  less context needed and less ambiguity overall . 
  i think i accidentally became half-native in english because of video games and cartoons as a kid . 
  i 've never had any problem with it , i just * knew * most of them, 
  i also almost never learned anything new in classes at all , except formal forms of what was already natural for me . 
  i never implied any of that , and many people get paid to write free software . 
  i suggest you educate yourself on what free and open source actually stands for . 
  that 's fucking brilliant . 
  now instead of going through the trauma of getting raped , some asshole will publish your private information !, 
  wanting to damage real rape victims because some people might be falsely accused of rape is fucking disgusting . 
  for the record , i do n't agree with publishing * any * personal information before the verdict . 
  initials should be enough , that 's how it works in my country , and i 'm pretty sure most are fake . 
  actually feminists are very vocal about the fact that men do n't automatically consent . 
  but why rely on facts when you can spew your political agenda online and entice hate ? 
  a thread on an internet forum is meaningless, 
  srs are not representative of feminists, 
  i do n't see anyone blaming men . 
  are you implying only men commit statutory rape ? 
  you sure are confused !, 
  and what 's your suggestion ? 
  never trusting victims ? 
  someone sure is emotionally invested in this whole internet thing huh ? 
  i 'm a man and have no idea what half those words you just typed mean . 
  you just go ahead , it sure is entertaining . 
   not just falsely accused , falsely accused with their name plastered on every newspaper , television , and website . 
  exactly what i said . 
   releasing the name of the accuser is a great way to point out the hypocrisy . 
  and absolutely horrible for actual victims . 
  of which there are many . 
  but hey it 's ok to be a hypocrite if it suits your political agenda !, 
  i believe no one 's name should be released before the verdict , female or male , accuser or the accused . 
  you defend those accused of rape and support damaging the potential victims , of which you know there are many . 
  i followed a link here thinking it was the red pill sub . 
  reading these comments i got so fucking confused that they make actual sense , until i realized it said `` blue '' in the url haha ... 
  you support an act that is incredibly damaging to real victims . 
  less than 10 % of rape accusations are actually false ( [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_accusation_of_rape#fbi_statistics ) ) . 
  that guy is hurting ** real people who have been raped ** to support some sort of agenda that sympathises with those accused of rape . 
  that is utterly despicable . 
  as a man i have a hard time even imagining what is that even supposed to mean . 
  `` i want to rape women around me '' ? 
  i 'm pretty sure that 's legitimately sociopathic . 
  and this is why excepts that tell you what the hell is the article about are useful . 
  it literally takes 31 paragraphs before linux is even mentioned , and 20 + before you * even get to know what the fuck is going on * . 
  seriously i applaud the open source seed initiative , but you could 've at least told us that 's what the article was about before drabbling on about broccoli for 20 long paragraphs . 
  yes the title is brilliant, 
  that 's my favorite series by far . 
  so much ... variety . 
  in emotion , atmosphere , characters ... just wow . 
  i 'll have to read it all again some day . 
   sucks even more that they are not making the second or third installment . 
  why is that ? 
  the movie really was n't terrible . 
  i would 've preferred something a tad bit more serious and honest to the books , but they should n't have just stopped ... 
  knowledge and information is * not * education . 
  education often ** sucks ** even when it is available . 
  it mostly is n't available , especially higher education . 
  here 's a good article on scheduling algorithms at osdev wiki ( great resource for this type of stuff ) : http://wiki.osdev.org/scheduling_algorithms . 
  oh , yeah , i understood what you were saying . 
  `` why is that ? '', 
  meant `` why are n't they making more movies ? '', 
  - i was wondering just like you were i suppose . 
  lol what ? 
  why the downvotes ? 
  a comment would be more useful ... 
  i read the entire sidebar and my thread still seems on topic . 
  it 's about operating systems , compilers , and programming languages . 
   also , javascript is horrible and should die . 
  why would you have it in your os ? 
  well , not javascript , but asm.js , which is a subset of it . 
  technologically , javascript environments are quite optimized , and gary did present real numbers and make sense . 
  i do n't think you understood my post . 
  it 's not about using javascript , that 's why the video is called `` the * death * of javascript '' , it 's about using the technologies behind it - mainly vms , as ** compile targets ** for native code , and to provide facilities that modern hardware provides .
