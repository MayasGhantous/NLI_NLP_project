  i just think people with privileges are often very inconsiderate of others ' perspectives . 
   denying freedoms to people seems well within the bounds of a discussion of ethics . 
  yes , i 'm sorry , i was n't being precise : there are sets of values that do n't include fascists ' freedom of speech . 
  i was talking about my own . 
  besides i do n't believe in individual ethics in general . 
   my point was that you counter ignorance with education , not by trying to shut ignorance up . 
  that 's the point of the article as well . 
  could be . 
   what constitutes an illegitimate restriction for you ? 
  things which do n't incite violence against certain groups of people or argue for their oppression or inferiority . 
   they clearly differ from what constitutes an illegitimate restriction for me, 
  yes , but i do think we could agree on two sets of speech : fascist and non-fascist . 
  then we can talk about legitimacy of restriction , but it is possible to separate these two categories . 
   your pragmatic approach to pc , at least in the scope of this conversation , seems to be ignoring where it 's headed . 
  not all slopes are slippery . 
  but yes this could happen . 
  i do n't know if i 've said this here or someplace else , but i am worried about using pc mechanisms to clear language and make it more comfortable , as a substitute for real change . 
   `` to ensure the integrity of the vote '' ( when we all know what they 're really doing ? ), 
  not american , what are they doing ? 
   none of this conversation applies to anything that really matters, 
  free speech and individual ethics are central ideologems in liberal democracies and on reddit , so i do think they ` matter ' . 
   ending gender identity , or ending the differences between the biological sexes ? 
  well one is potentially under our control , and one is ( at the moment lol ) not . 
  we can hardly make women better manual workers or soldiers than men , but we can certainly make men more accepted as teachers/nurses , or women as programmers . 
   my minor experience with ai does not invalidate my opinion . 
  that 's true , but your major inexperience with ai * risk * does , in this case . 
   you seem not to realise how much control programmers like to have over their toys . 
  well yesterday i spent my day writing assembly code and looking at memory dumps so i really do . 
   keep in mind we can literally read the minds of these ai, 
  no no no !, 
  you can * read * , but not interpret . 
  this is one of the basic lessons of early work with neural networks , which are so simple . 
  they * work * , you just have no idea how . 
  it 's kinda like hashing : it 's easy to get there , but once you are there , you ca n't go back . 
  you have a bunch of weights connecting a network . 
  they look like nothing but somehow classify dogs in pictures . 
  so now you would n't really be able to tell if your ai is generating a billion dog pictures or plotting to take over to world . 
  completely opaque to you . 
  maybe it 's already gotten out and is making random noise to delay your realization . 
   these ai may be super intelligent , but we should have a lot more experience with directing ai by the time that a real strong motivated ai is realizable . 
  a few days ago a computer made a 200 tb mathematical proof . 
  200 tb of text essentially . 
  we have no idea what happened there . 
  sure we know how the software works , but the result of its working , not so much . 
  i just get annoyed when people completely uninformed about a subject i care about claim that those of us interested in it are ` wasting air ' , so i told him he was wasting it . 
  but there , i removed that part . 
  context ? 
  that was mostly tongue in cheek . 
  i have n't thought about this a lot but what i 'm generally referring to is that women deserve more important roles in this society , for example in science and software development . 
   and have experience with light ai and neural networks, 
  great then go respond to my actually important comment illustrating how ai can be opaque using exactly neural networks . 
   i 'm not accusing you of wasting air , but all these tech giants and ceo 's freaking out the general population are . 
  this is probably ** the most important issue there is . 
  ** there are not * enough * people going * absolutely apeshit * over it . 
  obama should be screaming about it . 
  creating superintelligent ai can literally wipe us all out . 
   you sound like you 've written an image recog net , and you know that while it may be confusing , you can still dictate how it outputs , and control it 's inputs . 
  what does this even mean ? 
  i used nns as an example of opaqueness , as a counter to your point that you can always understand what the ai is doing . 
  you ** ca n't ** , even for very simple networks . 
  you ca n't just look at it and say `` oh it 's at stage 4 of recognizing a dog '' , because the information is not encoded symbolically . 
   i expect that our ability to control and debug ai will keep pace with our ability to make them . 
  yeah i will trust the mathematicians working on decision and game theory a bit sooner than your `` expectations '' . 
  there are literally experts whose entire careers are devoted to studying the problems of conflict and rationality . 
  the fact that you * are n't even thinking * in the terms of motivation , utility , rational decisions , and so on , but instead rely on vague terms like ` debugging ai ' , shows that you really need to research this topic more before commenting on it . 
  there are so many paradoxes and problems you are n't aware of when discussing intelligent agents that, 
  there are thousands of people like you all over the net . 
  you 're completely unaware that studying ai risk has become an entire academic field , and since you 've done some technical work you feel the need to comment on it . 
  however that 's a failure on their part , for not informing the general public and other technical people better . 
  watch this : https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are?language=en, 
   as long as we are n't forcing people . 
  yes i mean obviously . 
  the problem is however , the messages society conveys to you about your gender 's role are often implicit and have a significant impact on your decisions . 
   they are not dangerous until we give them those tools . 
  ` atomic bombs are not dangerous until we build them / use them ', 
  the central problem with all powerful tools is competition between people . 
  ai risk is secondary if * the chinese are on a brink of a major ai discovery . 
  * anyone who does it first has a huge advantage , therefore there is an incentive to progress despite risk . 
  besides , we 're talking about a point where we have superintelligent ai , so saying that it has only been fed pictures of the sky is not a valid point . 
  if we do n't have superintelligence then we do n't need to have this conversation . 
  you can just as well broaden your point to include any computer program , ai or not , and say `` see , that 's not intelligence '' . 
  of course it is n't , but we * are talking * about intelligence , so that 's irrelevant . 
  we 're back to the problem of ai in a box , which you seem to believe is possible to contain it in . 
  seriously , read up on that , you are misguided about how superintelligent systems behave . 
   for children , yes . 
  i do n't think this part of the discussion is relevant anymore , as i 've said . 
  you will see what i believe about speech and how ` offense ' is irrelevant , below . 
   you have n't made a single comment about the article and its assertion that pc is now being used to avoid criticism of ideas and beliefs , or criticism in general . 
  i generally do n't think in terms of free speech as a value . 
  for me , the main ideologem is conflict in society , mainly between the oppressed and the oppressors - the main one being class conflict . 
  free speech does n't fit in this paradigm . 
  the article gives examples of states using violence to suppress criticism of politicians - i do n't support this , not because of some nebulous ` free speech ' - but because it 's actually a direct attack on the oppressed , which must be fought against . 
  i can not give the same consideration to people who would like to say racist and sexist things . 
  clearly , they are on the oppressors ' side . 
   an ignorant attempt at silencing a criticism by attacking the person 's perceived `` privilege '' . 
  you attempted to stereotype me , and in doing so insinuated that i 'm incapable of understanding the human condition , or having empathy for others who have felt the sting of ignorant speech . 
  i was very careful to not make an argument out of that , but to simply use it to show you how you might not be considering the full perspective ( and you still might not be , for many other situations ) . 
  i still think that a person with privilege can have a lacking perspective which blocks their empathy . 
   `` kill this piece of scum fag who lives at this address '' is one thing , `` fags are sick and god abhors them '' is another entirely . 
  yes , the second one is ** more dangerous ** for society .
