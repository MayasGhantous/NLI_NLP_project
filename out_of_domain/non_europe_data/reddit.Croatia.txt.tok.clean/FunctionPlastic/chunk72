   it 's happening now , and the scope is expanding at a rapid pace to engulf wide ranges of criticism and thought . 
  for me the real problem are the people saying such things . 
  i live in a country where we have a literal nazi for our minister of culture . 
  people are calling for ethnic cleansing and are more xenophobic than in the wars during the 90 's . 
  ** they ** are the problem . 
   policing the language has n't brought about significant change in preventing disenfranchisement . 
  which i acknowledged as a possibility before . 
  but not because someone had their right to free speech infringed , but because we have n't fought well . 
  because we fell into this liberal trap where if it is no longer acceptable to say certain words , people think the problem is solved . 
  but fighting for the oppressors `` freedom of speech '' is just as misguided . 
   yes , clearly a communication line to humans makes for a not so safe agent . 
  * everything * is a communication line . 
  reading the outputs of the network is a communication line . 
  *** magnetic resonance of individual parts inside the computer *** is a communication line . 
  read [ this article ] ( https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2732-radio-emerges-from-the-electronic-soup/ ) where they accidentally evolved a radio module while applying genetic algorithms to some electronics . 
  you are simply anthropomorphizing communication . 
  the situation which the [ ai-box experiment ] ( http://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox ) describes is * inescapable * , by definition . 
   i guess the main reason i 'm just not that fussed about the ai predicting and manipulating humans is that it would require a huge amount of data and power and feedback to do that . 
  in your definition of ai , it had access to all the training and input data it could want , in which case , yes , this becomes a serious concern . 
  but the chinese are doing it !, 
  quick invest another few billion of public money in developing and militarizing ai asap *** or the chinese will rule over us !, 
  *** seriously what do you think drives countries to get nuclear weapons ? 
  well think of ai as nuclear weapons but with their own sets of motivations . 
  i agree anything remotely superintelligent is impossible to build with current technology . 
  these academics i keep mentioning also have interesting papers on how hard it is to even predict when we will have ai , and how expert and layman predictions are basically both equally wrong . 
   but why should knowledge about ; humans , the laboratory it lives in , and the ai 's own construction ; be necessary knowledge for an ai ? 
  great question !, 
  i suggest you read about the paper on [ basic ai drives ] ( https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/basic_ai_drives ) . 
  in short , every agent has a utility function , which describes what states of the world it prefers , and generally guides its behavior . 
  for humans , the utility function is a complex mix of brain chemicals , but for a machine , it could be anything : for example , the amount of paperclips it produces . 
  a paperclip-maximizing machine might sound ridiculously harmless , however , it is not so . 
  because , for any conceivable goal , * having more control * implies accomplishing that goal more easily . 
  more control means you want to :, 
  get more resources, 
  get smarter and more rational, 
  protect yourself, 
  etc, 
  so the rational thing to do for the paperclip maximizer is to take over the planet , the solar system , the galaxy , the cluster , and whatever comes next , to maximize the amount of metals it can form into the shape of a paperclip . 
  it would probably mark humans as a threat and not even produce paperclips until we are exterminated . 
  so , we say an ai would * converge * on these things ( and others , follow the link ) , * whatever the structure of its motivational drive . 
   you dismiss my counterargument about your point that offensive speech must cause harm as irrelevant . 
  we were leading two parallel discussions : the effect of certain types of speech on an individual , emotional level , and the general concept of free speech as it relates to society . 
  the first one is psychological , the second one is political . 
  i considered the second discussion much more relevant in this context . 
   how do oppressors oppress ? 
  they remove fundamental rights and freedoms . 
  this is a meaningless statement . 
  the oppressors i am referring to oppress on various levels but their most important device is state enforcement of private property which allows for unequal access to social goods like education , healthcare , generally bad working conditions , but most importantly the concentration of the fruits of labor into private and few hands . 
  there is a political incentive for the owning class to create divisions among the working class , and where i 'm from , they do this through nationalism and religious intolerance ( prominently of homosexuals as of recent ) . 
  so instead of focusing on international working-class solidarity , the politicians and various other public personalities ( all either capitalists or in their pockets ) all stress the importance of a nation , religion , and state . 
  that is fascism on a small scale , the types of divisions in the working class created to extinguish their class-consciousness , solidarity , and cooperation . 
  so when i am talking about fighting fascists , this is the type of people i want to fight , and when i talk about conflict being the relevant issue , class-conflict is what i am talking about . 
   you do n't seem to realize that oppressors can not oppress if the fundamental protections for freedoms are strong and unmalleable . 
  a racist in power is n't going to be able to suppress criticism of their policies if freedom of expression is well protected . 
  but if you take away those freedoms , if you leave room for widening what constitutes harmful speech , critics are just as likely to have their freedom of expression taken away . 
  this paragraph is a * perfect * illustration of how we disagree , so read what i 'm about to say more than three times if necessary and if you do n't get dizzy from all that head-shaking . 
  your model of free speech and society is essentially this : there is some form of central repression , be it by the state of the `` pc crowd '' , which then reduces the overall amount of free speech in society . 
  this repression can be leveraged by anyone with enough power -- say , a racist -- to silence criticism . 
  since rational debate would most likely result in a positive change , you see this is a harm and want to increase the amount of free speech available . 
  is that an at least somewhat useful summary ? 
  well , i think that 's simply a false model . 
  there is no universal , general , ` amount of free speech ' , and there is no central authority to regulate it : there is , rather , a * culture * which is either receptive or nonreceptive of certain ideas , and these ideas primarily fall on the left-right axis ( for our relevant political topics ) . 
  this culture then gives rise to eventual concrete restrictions against certain speech , but the culture is malleable through political action -- you can make it i.e. 
  more receptive of gays , or less , and that will then impact how speech regarding gays is received . 
  and you can make it more or less receptive of racism . 
  so for me , it makes sense , * as always * , to actually engage in this conflict rather than ignore it . 
  silencing certain people might be a direct result of it , but that 's not the goal , the goal is always social change . 
   oppressors also often use the same language you 're using - the language of `` oppression '' . 
  i agree this is most annoying . 
  but i 'm not a relativist so them twisting our language proves nothing to me . 
  no , they are most certainly not necessarily , or clearly , on the oppressors side . 
  oppression can take many forms , and does n't have to stem from your standard portfolio of race/religion/creed / etc. 
  i explained my view of this above . 
   they say things like :, 
    i generally do n't think in terms of free speech as a value . 
  i explained how i view the dynamics of oppression above and i believe that is a sufficient answer to this jab . 
   but your only tool seems to be telling people what they can or can not say . 
  woah woah woah , you 're assuming stuff about me personally . 
  we 're discussing a certain topic so of course i 'm talking about that , that would be similar to me reducing all your political views to `` you want fascists to express their opinions '' . 
   am i talking to a communist , because the reasoning here is nearing that level of incomprehensibility, 
  that should 've been obvious by now , but i 'm honestly trying to lead a discussion here ( and enjoying it ) , and i do n't really consider myself an incomprehensible person . 
   you do n't recognize that the most powerful defense is the freedom to openly express yourself in your own defense , and the freedom to choose how to react to offensive speech ( where this conversation started , but has veered off course from . 
  well maybe you should start your argument from there . 
  during the course of this entire debate you 've just cried `` free speech free speech free speech '' * without actually making an argument for it . 
  when someone does n't believe in the same values as you do , you do n't convince him by simply appealing to that value . 
  either way , i felt this general topic of oppression and free speech was more important than what happens to an individual when they hear something offensive , so that 's why i 'm primarily talking about that . 
  in case you literally just wanted to discuss the psychology of offense , i 'm not interested . 
   this is the problem with pc people . 
  they are so quick to stereotype , so quick to use race , religion , background , etc against people when it 's convenient , and then blow off being called out on it as well , that was n't the core of your argument . 
  i do n't consider myself one of the pc people , and that * was n't * my argument , at any level . 
  it was n't ` against ' you , it was a call for you to consider a potentially differing perspective . 
  and i will repeat it again , it is still quite possible that you do n't have a real grasp over how oppression functions , so i 'm perfectly fine with `` going there '' . 
   saying something stupid is more dangerous than actually inciting violence against someone !, 
  wow . 
  and your support for this statement ? 
  well , when a politician in my country gets on the tv , they do n't outright say `` kill the serbs '' ( well at least not anymore , or yet ) , they say something like `` serbs refuse to fit in blah blah blah , dangerous to our values blah blah '' -- substitute serbs for immigrants , homosexuals , blacks , or any other oppressed people . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  clearly , saying `` kill them all '' is not very politically sound , and gets you framed as a fringe lunatic . 
  no one agrees with people saluting hitler , but people do agree with actual rightists in power . 
   so you have a nazi for your culture minister , and you what , think that by my supporting free speech , i 'm really just trying to protect his right to enact nazi like policies ?
