  would you go on a protest against him ? 
  would you do everything you can to get him not to appear at certain events ( boycotts etc ) ? 
  that 's reducing his freedom of speech . 
  if you would literally only talk about how bad he is , then yes , you are enabling him . 
   you know , for someone to say this and simultaneously state that misguided and delusional rantings are more dangerous than actually inciting violence is a perfect example of cognitive dissonance . 
  ( ie that saying fags are sick and will burn in hell is more dangerous than actually inciting people to go kill homosexuals ) . 
  so is the problem the conflict , of people being killed , or the problem that there are people saying things that are offensive ? 
  which one is it ? 
  i do n't understand what you mean here . 
  workers created them . 
  also , milk is just as ` capitalistic ' if you look at it that way . 
  individual consumption choices are irrelevant . 
  you evaded the actually important part of my comment . 
  we are perfectly aware that the mode of production is capitalist . 
  pointing that out repeatedly * is not * an argument . 
  we do n't care about individual consumption , but systemic change . 
   how did the workers know how to create them ? 
  what is this question asking ? 
  by working . 
   did the workers also design them ? 
  yes . 
  did the assemblers do the electrical engineering ? 
  what, 
   did the electrical engineers mine for the copper ? 
  ** what **, 
   who found the copper mines ? 
  did the copper miners find the copper in the ground , or did a survey team find it ? 
  where is this guy going with this ? 
  is he informing me that division of labor is a thing ? 
  and other hard questions in life, 
   who dug for the oil to make the plastic ? 
   just saying `` the workers made it so they own it '' is incredibly ignorant of the complexity it requires to make even the simplest products, 
  no it is n't . 
  resource allocation and control is also work , so is management . 
  that is a vapid argument that can be used to discredit * any form of social change whatsoever . 
  want private property instead of feudalism ? 
  * go somewhere else !, 
  want rights to pick your religion ? 
  * fuck off to < insert country with particular religious majority  !, 
  want a minimum living wage ? 
  * start your own country !, 
  creating a parallel society is a ridiculous idea . 
  we want to continue the progress of justice , not discard everything and start over . 
  * tips copy of state and revolution *, 
  you really suck at this, 
  honestly i 'm the wrong person to ask , since this is a recent interest of mine ( i mean i 've always been a leftist , just not class-conscious and openly communist ) . 
  that said , i think it 's a fantastic work and it has definitely upgraded my understanding of marxist thought and discourse . 
  it has many hisorical references , and the theory looks rather solid , or at least much better than * not * thinking about those things . 
  i definitely encourage you to read on !, 
  well it really depends on which government , i do n't think the current forms of government should exist for example . 
   like i wanted to just break my teeth on them if that makes any sense, 
  what, 
   you could probably capture a lot of the supposed benefits of communism, 
  enjoying the comments here but this is wrong . 
  communism is n't about `` benefits '' for the capitalist economy , or the economy in general , it 's about owning the fruits of your labour and the means to produce them . 
  there are * utilitarian * arguments to be made for large governments and equality -- but then you 're just talking about a welfare state , not communism . 
  there are ** also ** utilitarian arguments for communism in the sense of * centrally planned economies * -- you can read about them on this ( libertarian-leaning , very well known in rationalist communities ) blog : http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/, 
  you can see communists discussing that book review here : https://www.reddit.com/r/debateacommunist/comments/4mtp3r/book_review_of_red_plenty_anyone_care_to_comment/, 
   see , your whole ideology is bullshit . 
  there 's really no point in further discussion , because if entire countries trying , and failing , under your ideology is n't enough to convince you that there 's something wrong , what point is there for me to even try ? 
  no , it 's hopeless . 
  this has to be among the most common sentences uttered on the internet , it 's off topic here and boring in general . 
  i made very concrete points that you must attack on their own , not just use some bullshit handwavy rhetoric of `` oh communism failed so worker 's rights do n't matter '' . 
  that makes you politically illiterate and a bad discussion opponent . 
   freedom of speech ? 
  that 's just some nebulous term for you . 
  no , ** you ** are making it a nebulous term . 
  you have n't even attempted to show how it is relevant . 
   what really matters is `` conflict '' and `` oppressors '' , words that you get to define , and define in such a way so that when the communists oppress political ideas , it is n't `` oppression '' it 's just them protecting the rest of us from oppression . 
  you are completely free to contest my models and definitions , but instead you choose to attack the * notion * questioning the existing system . 
  it 's pretty obvious you 're defending an unjust status quo and are the real enemy of freedom and progress !, 
   the capitalists are the ones who are bringing about conflict , and we must work to combat them !, 
  * no * , the system is set up in such a way that it conflicts the owning and the working class . 
  and yes . 
   you ask me for examples ? 
  the article is full of them . 
  tons of examples of what happens when you silence people , and why it 's a bad thing . 
  again , you did not understand my model , which perfectly fits these examples . 
  i 'm not * against * freedom of speech , i think it 's an * irrelevant concept * and that such examples are not examples of attacks made on freedom of speech but attacks made against specific groups of people out of specific political motivations . 
  i do n't agree with those attacks nor those motivations . 
  you think that it is my burden of proof to defend those examples of authoritarians silencing people . 
  fuck no , i disagree with it on those instances . 
  again , not because of some nebulous value , but because * they 're against my political aims . 
   i want to know that if i stop hearing them , it 's because society has ensured people are educated enough to realize that that sort of nonsense is ... well , nonsense, 
  capitalism encourages divisions , so your dream of a good educational system actually working to stop oppression will never happen . 
  see : europe , now . 
  or , if you want more subtle examples , i 'm being told daily by a superhero named after our country , dressed in our country 's flag , to use the services of some ( foreign-owned ) bank . 
  [ the mode of production determines culture in a very significant way ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/base_and_superstructure ), 
   i recognize this because i recognize how easy it is for any group to come along , capture that authority , and then begin to subvert it so as to make it possible to actually oppress others . 
  great and i have acknowledged this time and time again . 
  not a value-level argument . 
  you 're literally just saying that someone else might promote their ideas which you do n't like . 
  that 's a very utilitarian , tactics-level argument . 
   all fucking nonsense, 
  do you honestly believe class conflict is `` all fucking nonsense '' ? 
  you are seriously indoctrinated if you do . 
  u uk-u, 
  this rhethoric is passe with languages like / r/rust solving security problems statically . 
  you really think compilers have n't progressed for decades ? 
  / r/rust does this type of checks statically , and that part does n't make it slower .
