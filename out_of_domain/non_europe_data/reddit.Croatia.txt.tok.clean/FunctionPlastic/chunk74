  such as ? 
  i 'm talking about a new systems/embedded programming language called [ rust ] ( https://www.rust-lang.org/ ) , which does n't sacrifice speed for safety , but has both . 
  the idea that you * have * to be insecure in order to be fast is passe . 
  just because c has horrible holes , does n't mean all fast low-level languages have to have them . 
  while ` data structures involving pointers ' is meaningless in the context of rust , as rust has many types of `` pointers '' , i assure you it is not limited and you can do ` non-trivial ' things with it . 
  that 's because our methods of static analysis ( compilers ) have vastly improved . 
  c is old tech . 
  why is that sad ? 
  this . 
  the prevailing attitude online seems to be that you ca n't make objective comparisons between languages . 
  which is false . 
  * rust is safer than c * is a completely valid claim . 
   waaah a group created to help people deal with problems i do n't care about does n't cater to my unrelated interests , better call them sad whiners, 
  yeah no fuck you, 
  garrosh did nothing wrong, 
  you 're making an emotional jump from expropriation to crooks without explaining how they 're logical equivalents . 
  sure , you do n't like when the workers take control of the means of production , but that does n't mean you can equate that with what 's happening in venezuela . 
   and that 's why people are n't starving there . 
  yep that 's the only difference between fucking europe and a small south american nation , nothing else . 
  lets disregard that europe has been the greatest economic , scientific , cultural , and technological force for centuries , lets disregard that venezuala was fuck poor ** before ** ` muh socialists ' , lets discard the fact that this thread exists mainly because oil prices crash . 
  ca n't wait for people to start calling / r/economics to be less left-biased !, 
   those policies had the exact same outcomes in east germany , bulgaria , the soviet union , north korea and czechoslovakia . 
  except none of these policies are the same thing . 
  privatization is a singular thing , but planned economies can have multiple forms , you can not equate them . 
  to quote my other comment in this thread :, 
   you do n't have definitive proof that planned economies fail : for example , leonid kantorovich , a soviet mathematician and holder of nobel prize in economics , developed a very effective optimization method that solved traditional economic planning problems , and was very successful in several industries which struggled with economic calculations -- he was however shot down politically . 
  here 's an article about such efforts , written by a well-known libertarian-leaning psychologist : http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/ . 
   that 's just * one * of the infinite possible ways to plan/command an economy , then there 's [ cybersyn ] ( https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/04/allende-chile-beer-medina-cybersyn/ ) . 
  much more could be done with today 's optimization methods and computing power . 
  besides , the soviet union achieved wonders in the early years , they literally lifted a dirt-poor peasant society to an industrial superpower . 
   i do n't think it is an emotional jump , but rather a simple issue of property rights being respected or not . 
  ` property rights ' are a very abstract concept , in the sense that they refer to various differing situations under a common name . 
  if you only think in terms of property and coercion , then of course , both expropriation and * literal mafia * are pretty much the same thing !, 
  and so are taxes and by extension most state owned industries and services and so on . 
  so if i were to follow your reasoning i would have no choice but to conclude i am , essentially , living in a brutal , socially dysfunctional war zone . 
  this , of course , is extremely myopic and lacks any sort of nuance . 
  breaking into your house and stealing something from you is ** not ** the same as taxation , or social ownership . 
  yet all of these things infringe on ` property rights ' . 
  my conclusion is : ` property rights ' are an ideologem created by the bourgeoisie for the purpose of protecting their privileged and exploiting status as ` owners ' of the means of production . 
  they ( as a class , not as individuals , i 'm aware managers and employees and so on can also be owners ) serve no qualitative purpose in the process of production , yet they reap all of the benefits , while the bulk majority of us are nothing more but wage-slaves , on whom the entire system depends . 
  they have no other choice , but to use the state to enforce their ` property rights ' , and thus that 's now a part of modern legal frameworks . 
   one can try to legitimize the theft somehow with dogma , rhetoric and appeal to inequity , but please do n't be surprised when the society that legitimizes theft itself has a problem with theft and corruption . 
  well i think this sentence applies * extremely well * to capitalism . 
  i mean , you can try to legitimize a society where a small minority has to do no work and owns yachts , collections of sports cars , and any conceivable luxury ; and where the majority of other , working people , barely make ends meet , but do n't be surprised that a society which legitimizes exploitation has a problem with exploitation . 
   property rights are a fairly basic concept . 
  what does this statement mean ? 
  i explained to you how property rights encircle a very wide set of relations , many of which are not intuitively similar : for example , robbing at gunpoint , and taxation . 
  they both involve * coercion * , but many people would disagree they are * equivalent * . 
  my point was the following : if you defend property rights , you must be fully anarcho-capitalist , you can not defend taxation but be against expropriation because ` property rights ' . 
   a man 's claim to his house , for example , relies on property rights . 
  i agree people have a right to their personal possesion , such as cars , phones , houses , etc. 
  i disagree the same applies to means of production in which they do no work , but reap the benefits . 
  in the case of the means of production , it is the workers who are responsible for the entire process of production , and they are exploited by the capitalists and the state which work to keep them out of control . 
  this is n't really a moral argument , it 's simple class analysis : were it not for state/private coercion , the workers could control the economy . 
   were any of the transactions involuntary ? 
  no , but what * was * involuntary is the entire framework in which the transactions take place . 
  when you have a choice between barely making ends meet at company a , and barely making ends meet at company b , it does n't matter that you were free to choose where you would like to barely make ends meet . 
   or was the wealth created through astute capital investment and paying the market clearing price for labour and materials ? 
  the entire problem is that labor is commodified , and thus people are alienated from work . 
  rand literally wrote a book titled * the virtue of selfishness * . 
  well what 's corruption ? 
  buying a privileged status from public offices . 
  what 's privatization ? 
  literally corruption made legal . 
  a society where access to goods and services is determined solely by economic power is * by definition * an extremely ` corrupt ' society . 
  so corruption is the goal of libertarianism . 
  i 've literally seen libertarians from my country praising corruption because it is more market-based than democracy . 
  what does representative mean ? 
  does the majority of libertarians hold her in high regard ? 
  i 'd say yes , both in the us ( paul ryan and many other influential politicians and public figures cite her as an influence ) and in europe , although she 's not that mainstream here . 
  do her views reflect libertarian ideology ? 
  yes , i think she 's * more * consistent and brings libertarianism to its logical conclusion . 
  exactly and do n't plan to . 
  am i wrong to assume that she praises , you know , selfishness ? 
  i 've read some other texts about her , especially her letters to some niece or whatever , where she went on a diatribe about * loaning * her like $ 5 . 
  she was almost autistic about it . 
   with expropriation , both ownership and control goes to the men with guns . 
  with taxes , the state get 's a piece of the profit pie , but leaves control of the assets to the rightful owners . 
  ownership and control is * currently * guaranteed through the ( bourgeois ) state ( i.e. 
  guns ) . 
  in communism , the workers would be in control . 
  and of course , some form of ( non-bourgeois ) state coercion would be necessary to defend this position of control . 
  as long as there exist opposing classes in society , * some kind of state * is necessary , in order to ensure the dominance of one class . 
  currently , that 's the bourgeoisie , in the future , it could be the proletariat . 
  and of course , due to the progressive nature of socialism , the proletariat should work to transform the society in such a way that a state is no longer needed -- a transformation to communism , a classless , stateless society . 
  if you have free time , lenin explains all of this in the state and revolution , it 's a really interesting read even for non-communists seeking to get educated on theory of the state . 
   but the working class does control the direction of the economy in capitalism , through their consumption choices . 
  so everyone has an equal say ? 
  bullshit , there is a very clear divide between the owning class and the working class . 
  the working class needs to spend a large portion of their lives just to survive , while the owning class reaps the benefits , and decides how resources are allocated . 
  just because you have a choice between pepsi and cola does n't mean shit . 
  what is meant by control here is a more democratic and reasonable economy which meets everyone 's needs . 
  it means a command economy . 
  an economy where instead of buying 20 yachts or hoarding wealth , resources could be reinvested into productive industries , so everyone would have their material needs met . 
  long-term , this would eliminate petty crime . 
   it is the role of the capitalist to identify the items of value to the working class and allocate capital to produce them . 
  the role of the capitalist is to reproduce capital and create profit . 
  most business today has nothing to do with consumers , it 's business-to-business anyway , financial markets , etc. 
  and maximizing profit also means destroying the environment in many cases . 
   the typical unskilled labour commodity worker is not very well suited to this function .
