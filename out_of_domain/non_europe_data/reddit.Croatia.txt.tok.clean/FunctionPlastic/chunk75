  yes of course , i 'm for scientific management of economies . 
   highly skilled labour on the other hand , is not a commodity . 
  yes it is . 
  i 'm a programmer , if that 's what you mean by highly skilled . 
  i still sell my time in order to buy food , so my work is still a commodity . 
   who is best suited to control the means of production , the man who 's ability to allocate capital effectively has been proven , or a bunch of thugs and crooks ? 
  a bunch of thugs and crooks if by that you mean the proletarian state , 
  which one , then ? 
  that you ca n't condense the message into a simple post just tells me you 're full of shit , not that i should read it . 
  it 's as if the op actually talked about rand and the guy who i 've responded to tried to change the subject, 
  no lol you 're like a preacher going from door to door telling people about some deity . 
  i read serious literature , not bad fiction and even worse politics . 
  if you ca n't summarize it i 'll continue believeing you 're full of shit . 
   yes , i can see you 're stupid . 
  are you 12 ? 
   how exactly you can tell what literature is serious and which is n't when you only read the title is bit of a mystery . 
  the same way i know mein kampf is bollocks without actually reading it . 
  reputation and common sense . 
   you do n't even seem to be aware that it 's non-fiction, 
  lol i 'm talking about her other works . 
   you keep believing , boy, 
  * tips fedora *, 
   do n't let reality shake your faith . 
  aaand you still ca n't provide a summary !,

  why do people keep writing ** john ** snow ? 
  i see it more and more . 
  what the fuck ? 
  absolutely the gpl . 
  if you want to sell your software for one-time use , you can sell dual-licensed copies ( of course , ** not ** with an open source license , but a proprietary one , that will prevent the commercial users to modify it and resell it etc. 
  something something banned from / r/pyongyang, 
  this is really great , where was it posted , some group/page for discussion ? 
   this just sounds like social democracy . 
  it sounds like a planned economy . 
  socialism arguably has more elements of that than does social democracy , although both * tend * in that direction . 
   we say it because these examples retained commodity production , money , wage labor , the valorization of capital , exchange and the nation state . 
  yeah , they were n't * communist * in the utopian sense , i do n't really see how you can get rid of any of that after a devastating civil war for example , followed by unrest , famine , ww ii , and so on . 
  they were socialist in the sense that the means of production were n't privately owned and they aspired towards communism . 
   and massive corporations plan their production and distribution -- does n't make them socialist . 
  ` planned economy ' refers to the * entire economy * , i.e. 
  replacement of market mechanisms with scientific ones . 
  how do you not know this ? 
   so then what 's socialism ? 
  well in that historic period it is very decidedly a state-led effort at achieving communism . 
  ( in the soviet case , if we 're going to be cynical , trying not to get obliterated from without and within , which is what mainly influenced soviet decision-making during most of its existence . ), 
   if you retain every single feature of capitalism , since when did you even experience system change ? 
  but they did n't . 
  the central characteristic of capitalism is the existence of a market and private property . 
  lenin introduced market mechanisms , was he also `` not a socialist '' according to you ? 
  he was pressured by the realities of the historic moment to do so . 
  it was a mistake , though , and was corrected by stalin . 
   so now the us postal office is socialist ? 
  whatever the government does is socialist ? 
  what are we now , a mix of sanders supporters and fox news viewers ? 
  again , no , * the means of production being socialized * refers to ** all ** means of production . 
  for the record i do n't think that the existence of public roads means we 're living in a communist utopia . 
   but they were n't owned by the workers, 
  what does that mean ? 
  like , market socialism where workers are the shareholders ? 
  yeah , no , they were n't . 
   socialism ( and communism ) is about common ownership of the means of production , and these states did n't have that, 
  what is common ownership , again ? 
  and at which point does it become possible and desirable ? 
  i agree the ideal is * democratic * production . 
  but that 's communism , and none of these countries had communism . 
  they had socialism , if we define socialism as a state-led effort at achieving communism . 
   since when did i dispute this ? 
  implicitly by comparing it to a ` massive corporation ' , which is a term applicable only to * market * economies , i.e. 
  largely non-planned ones . 
   i was trying to tell you there 's nothing inherently socialist about planning , central or otherwise . 
  i mean , i 'm pretty sure the nazis must 've implemented certain planning mechanisms , for instance , and i do n't think anyone here would argue that they were socialists . 
  i would disagree . 
  the nazis collaborated with the bourgeoisie and industrialists . 
  state power and capitalism go hand in hand . 
  centralizing the means of production in the hands of the representatives of the proletariat with the aim of achieving communism * is definitely socialist . 
  * read the manifesto again , this is almost a * word-for-word recipe * by ~ ~ marx ~ ~ engels . 
   i now see the problem . 
  the state and the people are not one in the same . 
  the state is an apparatus for ensuring the dominance of one class , it is not even in the same category as ` the people ' , so i 'm not sure how you can compare them . 
  however , the state can be oppressing either the bourgeoisie , or the proletariat , and a socialist state tries to do the former . 
  that 's called the dictatorship of the proletariat , i 'm starting to think you have n't read your marx . 
   technically modern china is socialist by your definition . 
  what ? 
  the state is strong and totalitarian , but it is very much a market-oriented country !, 
  one of the most so . 
   what comprises capitalism 's base is the existence of capital , which was not replaced by the soviet union in any period, 
  that was one of my points though . 
  you ca n't jump from feudal society to full communism just with pure faith . 
  no matter how much you theorize the material situation of the society exists as it does . 
  that 's why i say the * governments * were socialist , i.e. 
  they had a communistic/socialist * tendency * , but they could n't truly solve concrete issues in order to achieve communism . 
   under lenin you had the nep , under stalin the ussr exported grain to other countries for profit , and after stalin firms were expected to make profits to fill the state 's coffers . 
  yes the nep was thought to be a necessity . 
  you ca n't wish communism and a good industrial base into existence . 
  especially not after a devastating war where like tens of millions of people died and many more were sick etc. 
  if you want to find out why it was necessary , i really suggest you listen to this podcast , it 's amazing : http://www.podcastchart.com/podcasts/symptomaticredness-s-podcast/episodes/jacob-feygin-on-economic-history-of-the-ussr-part-1, 
   so the difference between socialismtm and capitalismtm can be gauged on a sliding scale ? 
  i 'm sorry i 'm not sure how you got this from what i said ? 
  i said the complete opposite . 
  it 's * not * socialism if the means of production are n't socialized -- ** all of them .
