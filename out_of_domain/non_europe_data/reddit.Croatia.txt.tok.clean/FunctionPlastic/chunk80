  freedom of speech is a universal value which can be protected by the government , in areas where it has jurisdiction . 
  it has none on reddit , so the government , without breaking the right to private property , can not protect your freedom of speech here ( and probably does n't want to ) . 
  freedom of speech is * still a thing * on reddit . 
  you can have subs which respect it more , and those which do not . 
   it says nothing of protecting people from other people or from the court of public opinion . 
  that 's the thing : lots of people disagreeing with you does not harm your freedom of speech . 
  but ** mods removing things you say ** , does . 
  it 's a universally-valid distinction , which has nothing to do with governments . 
  out of those , honestly , i 'm only really interested in the vale . 
  any ` far left ' they get is by definition not far left . 
  far left has to be left of social democracy , and has no representation in parliamentary politics of the usa . 
  first off , not every statement in the form of `` no true x does y '' is a fallacy . 
  there may have been * some * nazis who loved the jews , but saying that jews have nazi support is ridiculous , because the individuals who are nazis and support jews have cognitive dissonance . 
  the international far left actually views hillary as a bigger threat than trump ( she 's more imperialist ) . 
  the american far left does n't want to endorse either , and especially attacks the effective blackmailing of minorities to support a neoliberal imperialist just because trump is scary . 
   us politics in general skews right of most other western countries . 
  i do n't think the term far left is that linear and relativistic . 
  far left is socialists and communists wherever you go . 
  social democracy is ` left ' . 
   also , the us does n't have a parliament so ... 
  i 'm not sure why you 're even talking about parliamentary politics . 
  am european . 
  you 're completely mistaken . 
  i 'm pretty sure you posted in the wrong sub . 
  he 's talking about american progressives , social democracy , and sanders . 
  these things have nothing to do with socialism , and this is a socialist sub . 
  they 're parts of the bourgeois ideology , we 're * anti * - capitalist . 
  oh okay , thanks . 
  have n't read it i 'm on a phone , but i 'll give it a look . 
  do you think developers always design every aspect of their software ? 
  usually they just implement it . 
  in this case , i think that scientists and developers would form a healthy collaboration . 
  well obviously there 's a difference between analyzing something and talking about how best to support it , that 's how i interpreted his post . 
   democratic technocracy, 
  that 's an oxymoron . 
  i 'm not for relegating all power to scientists , but rather engaging them in designing the algorithms that govern our economy . 
  why except the infertillity ? 
  the majority of people like him more than the current oligarchy , much of the liberal intellectual elite support his legacy . 
  he led the most successful resistance movement during ww2 and anyone who does n't respect him for that is probably a nazi sympathizer . 
  he unified the people in the fucking balkans . 
  only during his lifetime were we truly brothers . 
  the cia and capitalist powers kill more innocent people today than tito ever did . 
  lol his economic policies were much better than what we have now . 
  we had industry back then , now it 's all sold away . 
  thanks , makes sense . 
  but well we see her growing from a little girl to what she is now , maybe she could learn . 
  where did you get the third arc from and why ados ? 
  read the state and revolution by lenin, 
   it seems like communists are obsessed with ideological purity, 
  we are obsessed with correct revolutionary theory in the same way bourgeoisie sociologists are obsessed with correcting their own theories . 
  marxism at its core is a tendency to create a social science . 
   and true scotsmen , nothing is true communism , no one is a true leftist , etc. 
  have you thought about that not all of us are americans who think bernie sanders is the leftiest leftist ever ? 
  it 's the opposite , america is extremely right-biased . 
  capitalists are for regulations that benefit them . 
   society stopping a bunch of workers from banding together and forming some sort of cooperative in which they all have equal ownership and share in the profits of their labor . 
  the majority of society will be capitalist still . 
  you missed the part where communists believe capitalism is wrong . 
  if society is capitalistic , you can not just one day decide that it 's not gon na be for you and your ten friends -- i mean you can by separating yourself from it . 
  but communists want the exact opposite . 
  besides cooperatives are mostly a pipedream and also exploit labour and function by market principles , try googling leftist critiques of mondragon . 
   so how is a communist society different from a very large cooperative ? 
  the cooperative operates on a market , it just has a different ownership structure . 
  the communist economy is planned . . 
   unless the whole world is communist , the communist country will still have to deal with a larger capitalist society . 
  full communism is all-encompassing , and includes the entire planet ( s ) . 
  so yeah , you ca n't have true communism in a single country . 
  you should know , however , that you do n't get communism overnight . 
  when communists say ussr and prc were n't communist , they 're not trying to disassociate themselves from their wrongdoings , but point out that you need to separate the transition from the final goal -- which has never been reached . 
  communist society has a clear definition set in stone : a moneyless , stateless society . 
  communism ** never ** existed and that 's a hard fact . 
  the `` communist countries '' were countries in this transitionary period of ** socialism ** , where you still have many elements of the previous society , and the state still exists : but it was coopted by the proletariat and transformed into a fundamentally different type of state . 
  so through the revolution , the vanguard party ( e.g. 
  bolsheviks ) , takes over the state and basically does what engels describes in point 18 in [ principles of communism ] ( https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm ) . 
  if you want to know more , read the state and revolution by lenin . 
  i do n't know much about the organization of foreign trade in communist society from an ideological perspective though , sadly . 
  but the main point is that you have planned , centralized control that you can control rationally and in the interests of the society as a whole , which cooperatives ca n't do . 
  state power is necessary . 
   unless they cut off all foreign trade , which is a non-starter . 
  the ussr still managed , this was n't the largest problem of their economy . 
   as the ussr and maoist china has shown , this is pretty much impossible to do effectively . 
  nnnnah . 
  there are infinite ways in which you can plan an economy , and only one type of system towards which markets tend ( capitalism ) . 
  `` less regulation '' narrows , `` more regulation '' widens , if you will , the possible ways in which your economy could go . 
  so it is not logical to say that concrete market economies that failed are proof that economic planning * in general * can not work . 
  here 's a review of the book red plenty by a very respected rationalist with libertarian tendencies ( [ who is wrong about a lot regarding marxism ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/debateacommunist/comments/4mtp3r/book_review_of_red_plenty_anyone_care_to_comment/ ) ) , in which he summarily explains how there * were * mathematical methods which worked ( in theory and in practice ) to solve the economic calculation problem : http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/ . 
  the problems which soviets faced ( then ) were political , they blocked the implementation of the methods . 
  additionally , we have a much better understanding of complex systems and could utilize advanced algorithms and supercomputers , they would definitely make economic planning easier . 
   and at what point do you decide that the state is no longer necessary and you can transition to the stateless communist society as promised by marx ? 
  you do n't decide it . 
  the state is a product of class antagonisms : the capitalist state exists to oppress the proletariat , and the proletarian state would exist to oppress the bourgeois elements and defend socialism . 
  once there are no classes , there are no class antagonisms , and the state no longer exists . 
  this is a * very * simplified point , if you 're interested in getting a clearer picture you really should read the state and revolution . 
   once the state has stepped out of the picture , how do you keep capitalism from reemerging ? 
  how do you keep feudalism and slavery from reemerging in capitalism ? 
  capitalism did n't just emerge out of nowhere , it 's a specific stage of development of the means of production . 
  socialism/communism are the next steps . 
  that would be like reversing entropy basically . 
  no money means no capital . 
  and there are also many implications regarding culture and human psychology , i mean as individual you have incentives to compete with others economically , such incentives would n't exist .
