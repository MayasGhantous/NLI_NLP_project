  i do n't agree with stalin 's approach to dealing with his comrades though , but you have to know that the show trials are also vastly exaggerated by capitalist states . 
  it 's a form of anti-communist dogma . 
  free discourse is essential to communism . 
   you mean the lenin who oversaw a red terror and said `` the state is an institution built up for the sake of exercising violence . 
  previously , this violence was exercised by a handful of moneybags over the entire people ; now we want ... to organise violence in the interests of the people . '', 
  well i mean of course class enemies call it the `` red terror '' . 
  there was a fucking civil war going on . 
  like 11 capitalist imperialistic armies collaborated with internal class enemies to fight against the proletarian state . 
  it 's gon na be bloody . 
  that 's what states do . 
   the fact that red terror lynch mobs were supported by a large majority of the population was probably little comfort to the rich kulaks who were killed . 
  the kulaks who hoarded grain and financed anti-communist activity ? 
   the whole crux of the problem is . 
  how do you convince the current owners of the means of production to give up that ownership without resorting to force ? 
  you fell into the classic liberal pacifist trap . 
  you do n't . 
   how do you make society classless ( that is , lack of any differences in economic status ) without forcibly transferring wealth from more productive people to less productive people . 
  social ownership is not about transferring wealth , it 's about organizing the means of production in everyone 's benefit . 
   and yes , i recognize we do that anyway in our current society , since we are not living in the fantasy world of ayn rand . 
  i agree that some amount of redistribution is necessary to keep a modern society functioning . 
  communism takes it to an extreme . 
  no it does n't . 
  communism has nothing to do with redistributionism . 
  lenin hated social democrats . 
   that article has sections on `` trade with western industrialized countries '' and `` trade with third world countries '' . 
  it was n't the largest part of the soviet economy , but it was n't negligible . 
  i do n't think this is a very important fact for what you are saying . 
  they were clearly not operating on a global market in the sense capitalist countries do . 
  suddenly it 's wrong to mock trump supporters ? 
  fuck them, 
  fascists `` were our family '' . 
  umm the problems people are facing are much wider and deeper than what trump addresses , and while his supporters got dragged into quite a terrible scapegoating escapade , they are still harmful * the the majority of the working class * , especially minorities . 
  they actively work against their class interest . 
   [ the reddit hivemind of new-age socialism ] ( http://www.joemygod.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/donaldtrumpls21-660x330.gif ), 
  the political motivations are what matters . 
  this is part of a wider racism problem . 
   oh , and the fact that economics is a science . 
  it 's a science in the sense that it creates models which try to predict real-world phenomena . 
  however , unlike natural sciences , it has many underlying value assumptions , which are purely ideological . 
  so yes , it constructs a model on how to maintain the status quo in a capitalist country . 
  but that model itself would only be followed by those with political motivations to actually pursue the predicted results . 
  economics could just as well be about central planning , for example , which got quite developed in the ussr , but the calcified political structure could not implement it . 
  he 's probably a mod alt that posted it for the karma right before deciding to not allow it anymore, 
  reading this comment i came up with a creative challenge for everyone : point out ** one ** thing in it that directly engages any of my points . 
  you did n't even understand my comment if you think it 's about economics not being perfect , or some other vague ideological bullshit you read into it . 
   how can i do that when you spoke broadly about the issue of discrediting all the economic science out there while using excessivly strong language to describe the weaknesses of it ... essentially since you point out an imperfection in it and make it seem that it holds no value as a result . 
  i did none of that . 
  i merely said that most activity in mainstream economics is ideologically motivated . 
  it is still a science , but with the goal of aiding the status quo , and most of its practitioners have a dual function as ideologues . 
  milton friedman , for example , literally caused a democratically elected president to be overthrown and installed a murderous fascist dictatorship that killed millions and ruined the economy with his experiments . 
  the neoliberal advisers of politicians are working for the capitalist class . 
   i 'll give it a try but someone that is already anti-science is unlikely to be convinced of anything . 
  lol i guess i 'll quit uni and disavow all my academic work . 
  because someone who is a communist * clearly * can not be a scientist !, 
  oh wait einstein was a socialist and many , many other academics are too . 
   ` purely ideological ' ? 
  seriously ? 
  the assumptions are mostly based on real life examples and conditions , or the best that we can measure something irl . 
  your argugment here seems to be that economist are purposely fucking up the science so that that outcome fits some predetermined opinion . 
  their fucking up of science has nothing to with ideology per se , just their incompetence . 
  that 's not the point though , they could have theories that match reality perfectly ( they do n't , ** far ** from it ) -- but the reality that what the theories match is merely the functioning of the capitalist system and the ways to strengthen it . 
  the question is : how do we maintain status quo while benefiting the capitalist class as much as possible ? 
  i was about to say this is usually just an implication before i remembered many neoliberal economists are openly advocate more power for capitalists , even to the point of being openly hostile to workers because it benefits the `` economy '' ( ruling class ) . 
   and there you go . 
  exactly my point . 
  you think that scientist are all in agreement with each other to create models that support predetermined opinions . 
  why would they want that ? 
  no i do n't . 
  i think they operate in a system that incentivizes its own reproduction , through , among other means , ideology . 
   why would these scientist not want the truth ? 
  conspiracy theory much ?? 
  fuck off with your dumb non-engagement . 
   no economy even remotely similar to the ussr has ever succeeded and for a good reason ... 
  except planned economies , almost everywhere , brought up the people from a state of feudalism to industrialized superpowers , increased literacy rates enormously , eliminated famine , all in a span of a couple decades . 
  i do n't deny the objective problems - that 's where economics and computer science come in handy . 
  there are methods which solve many of the ussr 's efficiency problems ( linear programming , invented by a soviet mathematician , tested in several industries , chucked away because of the aforementioned political calcification ) as i 've mentioned , but hey your ideology does n't like that fact so i guess it ai n't true . 
   it 's total bullshit . 
  woah i never thought of that, 
   you 're socialist belief only works in a perfect world but humans are n't perfect and the science , real life case studies , etc all show that . 
  `` m-muh human nature ! '', 
  and you have seen evidence it is because of his race and gender ? 
  i mean these reddit comments where white men pretend to care about racism and sexism because they feel it 's a witty attack on the `` sjw '' strawman are n't proof of anything . 
  homophobia and sexism were considered normal until some time ago and to many people they still are . 
  but i get the the thing we are really doing here is protecting the feelings of white men . 
  congrats on your gold medal in completely irrelevant commentary . 
  why ? 
  my post is not about him . 
  it 's about the general idea that what society considers `` normal '' can often be oppressive . 
  the sentiment here is that these types of behavior should not be challenged * at all * , this entire charade got this amount of attention because it 's extremely easy to use it as an example that * all * engagement is actually just the evil sjws attacking white men ( this is what people \\ ^ r white men on reddit and 4chan quite literally believe ) . 
  i agree with what you said . 
  i just find this part hard to believe :, 
   are some people going to jump on the bandwagon because it suits their anti-sjw agenda ? 
  sure . 
  but that does n't mean it 's the main thing here . 
  jumping on the bandwagon and injustice towards crockford are * not * mutually exclusive . 
  people in this thread are making things up to make this seem worse than it is , there 's even a guy who used `` cuck '' and `` mangina '' and he got compassionate replies about not being too hard on himself . 
  political motivation of these posters coud n't be more evident . 
  it 's not about justice for crockford . 
  the sentiment is obvious : this community is against social justice , and the most useful tool they have to fight it is misrepresenting the entire movement . 
  evidenced again by people posting tumblrinaction as some sort of unbiased window into social justice .
