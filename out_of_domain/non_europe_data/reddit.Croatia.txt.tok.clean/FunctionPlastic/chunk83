  i 'm not saying bad things do n't happen , i 'm saying reddit and 4chan * enjoy * when they do : several years after the donglegate thing happened , for example , there were ** still ** * daily threads about it * on / g / . 
  it 's outrage culture and identity politics for internet reactionaries . 
   so what we have is this :, 
  no , we do n't , because you 're ignoring the wider political context in which all of this happens . 
  this is n't happening in isolation , it 's happening on reddit and 4chan , two communities who are by and large the main opponents of the social justice movement . 
  it 's the same two sites which gave birth to gamergate , for example . 
  it 's the same two sites which almost exclusively focus on one side of the story with clear political motivations : sjw is a slur that pops up in every other thread , the climate is undeniable . 
  now , you can say that this is completely unrelated , and that everyone 's motivations in this thread are completely sincere and focused on douglas . 
  and in response i can simply point you to the guy posting an article about how outrageous it is for the american military to have sensitivity training about islam . 
  why ? 
  it proves my point that people here are motivated not by genuine concern for anyone 's well-being , but by participating in the fight against social justice . 
  they post enraging stuff related to the topic by just one single vague notion of `` oversensitivity '' , thereby removing focus from douglas , and onto the fight against what they perceive to be social justice and its values . 
   is kind of ironic , because you are doing pretty much the same thing to this community . 
  what part of what i 'm saying is misrepresentation ? 
  ctrl + f-ing `` sjw '' brings out like 20 results in this thread . 
  there are people saying `` cuck '' and `` mangina '' which is not questioned . 
  as i said , it 's evident that * this community * has picked a side , and it 's not social justice . 
  i do n't know whether you truly do n't understand how communities work , or whether you 're pretending not to . 
  either way this is a huge strawman . 
  not ** all ** posts in a community express explicit sentiment . 
  despite what the alt-right believes , saying `` cuck '' 100x times is not a sentence through which you can communicate anything constructive . 
  i 'm not accusing this community of being * only * about right-wing politics , that 's absurd , i 'm accusing it of holding a general sentiment , and pretending not to hold it . 
  the same goes for / g / . 
  the nominal topic for that board is technology . 
  90 % of posts ** are ** about technology . 
  however , there are posts which make fun of feminists , social justice activists , try to entice rage in the community against certain topics , etc. 
  statistically , these are in minority , but their success and * acceptance * is what shows the general sentiment in the community . 
  if you have daily threads where people express outrage about something stupid a feminist did 5 years ago : do you think people who are n't hostile to social justice would feel welcome in that community ? 
  in a thread explicitly about technology , if someone posts something like `` women are dumb and ca n't program as good as men '' -- ** and the rest of the community just accepts it and does n't challenge it ** -- would you think that 's not indicative of a problem ? 
  ( not saying this happens on / r/javascript , it obviously does n't , but much worse things to happen on 4chan , i 'm talking about sentiments and tendencies here . ), 
   all it proves is that this particular guy exists . 
  statistics do not work with n = 1 . 
  that is cherry-picking , and your conclusions are not supported by your evidence . 
  so for you to consider my experience , that i share with many others both inside and outside the mentioned communities , it would take a thorough statistical analysis of all actual beliefs and behaviors people in these communities exhibit -- despite that being practically impossible ? 
  sorry m8 , when someone asks rigorous mathematical proof for perspectives they do n't agree with , and continues accepting those which do n't bother them , it 's not proper skepticism , but denial . 
  and did you apply the same rigorous standards to all the numerous posters accusing sjws of something in general ? 
  after all , these are just singled-out examples of bad behavior , not a trait of their community !, 
  you did n't . 
  you replied to me , practically the only person with a dissenting opinion in this entire thread . 
  who 's at like 10 downvotes . 
  the irony is that * your behavior * proves my general point : communities defend their culture and shared beliefs . 
  in this community 's case , the shared belief is that social justice is bad . 
  a spook *, 
  wow so original, 
  so brave, 
  had the same thing happen to me , although we were just dating . 
  it was n't a big problem , but the minute afterwards a new friend came over and said `` oh you must be < a girl everybody knew i had a crush on recently  '' . 
  hated myself that night, 
  what the fuck is this . 
  i have a strong sense that i 'd be vomitting if i was n't so weirded out . 
  we are n't motivated `` by science '' , what ever that would mean . 
  we are motivated by social pressures . 
  just like women are motivated to reach unhealthy standards . 
  sexual selection can be extremely detrimental to organisms . 
  and women are pressured to be extremely unhealthy , as individual organisms . 
  this is why no one likes scientism . 
   hey guys i know practically nothing about history of human societies and my trivial understanding of science makes me right every time !, 
  also most people have averge weight . 
  mostly usa has such problems . 
  due to social structures too . 
  being healthy is valued in my country just as much even though obesity is rare . 
  you would actually have to try rather hard to get fat , in fact i 've been trying to put on weight but it 's not working . 
  i did n't blurt out any statistics, 
  i see you are completely unfamiliar with / r/socialistart . 
  of course not , i was referring to this part :, 
   it 's a boring , square , repressive society . 
  liberal democracies and third world countries always produce the good culture . 
  i 'm a revolutionary socialist . 
  so yeah i 'm in favor of violent revolution . 
  some of the most nuanced arguers have also been of those inclinations . 
  it has literally zero impact on the quality of their arguments : in fact , it 's an indicator that they have probably put more thought into them . 
  fetishizing the status quo does n't make your arguments any better . 
  which is the same class of people , really , and often literally the same people . 
  politics is violence . 
  pacifists pretend to be anti-violence , and maybe honestly are , but they 're actually supporting a status quo which is unjust and murderous . 
  revolutions merely * expose * the violence and bring it to the ruling class . 
   i simply oppose random or otherwise ignorantly misdirected murder, 
  me too ? 
   fringe political views, 
  literally the most influential political ideology is hardly fringe . 
  the apolitical masses are not a good measure of fringeness . 
   what you perceive to be the `` ruling class . '', 
  so you 're saying our society has ... no political hierarchy ? 
  what ? 
  lol, 
  what, 
   well , now is n't that just convenient ... 
  literaly any non-ad-hoc political opinion is fringe . 
  how many people hold an opinion is a meaningless measure . 
  you need to look at some kind of historical context and credibility . 
  and revolutionary socialism is extremely non-fringe by those standards , as people as diverse as einsten and noam chomsky agree with it . 
  tons of academics and historical figurey drew inspiration from it . 
  it is the top alternative to the status quo by far . 
  just looking at growing wealth inequality disproves the idea that private ownership of the means of production benefits the common man . 
  and those things have nothing to do with pension funds , but increased productivity and transport technology . 
  if you define credibility as `` likeliness somone will agree with it '' , and especially if you are asking the media and politicians which uphold the ruling order , then revolutionary socialism * never had any credibility * . 
  which as you can tell is not a very useful model for thinking . 
  my point stands . 
  it 's not fringe . 
   libertarian policies have many commonalities with liberal policies , specifically on social freedoms .
