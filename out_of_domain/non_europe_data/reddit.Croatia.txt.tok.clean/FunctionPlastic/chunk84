  `` guys , guys , ** 420 blaze it ** xdd !, 
  we 're so cool !, 
  now do n't mind us completely undermining the working class and removing all protections from minorities , we like weed !, 
  weed ! '', 
  and they 're always also trp posters , pick-up artists , and overall horrible misogynysists . 
  can confirm . 
  huge number of young edgy memsters started liking trump and getting into alt-right . 
  usually it 's the ones which were insufferable before , but man did this give them direction . 
  for some reason i read this like a joy division line, 
  holy shit this is an upvoted comment here . 
  do you people consider gays abnormal too ? 
  it is statistically `` normal '' , whatever that means , to be straight , and white in america . 
  let me repeat the question : do you call gays and blacks abnormal ? 
  yeah choosing to tell people they are not normal , when you literally have a specific term for it , is a very political thing to do . 
  besides this is a level of dishonesty akin to telling people they 're retarded and then going back saying `` you 're prejudiced against retards ! '', 
  saying things like `` black people commit more crime '' without any context is clearly meant to imply something much different than the facticity of the statement . 
  same thing when someone calls gays abnormal . 
  or calls someone a retard . 
  this thread is kind of a caricature i ca n't but imagine everyone wearing fedoras and trenchcoats as they type stuff like `` computers do n't care about your feelings '', 
  pretty sure if you 're the one with the defect if you ca n't get implications and context, 
  what does this mean ? 
  you realize those words literally just mean handheld antitank granade launcher on russian ? 
  well you would n't say `` hand me the handheld granare launcher sergei ! '', 
  in english for the same reason , 
  trust me i 'm slavic , all of those words are totally intuitive to me , how would they not be to someone who actually speaks russian . 
  yes and people generate interest out of thin air !!, 
  men are more physically suited for dangerous jobs like the military or oil rigs ? 
  the level of intellectual dishonesty when reddit discusses these topics is amazing . 
  what is this ? 
  you believe men and women are * literally the same !, 
  * '' no , i believe there are justified and non-justified forms of discrimination . 
  discrimination due to physical differences is justified , but due to gender roles -- is n't . 
  now of course it * is * possible there is a cultural component contributing to male workplace deaths , no one 's saying men are n't hurt by gender roles too in some areas . 
  this thread is literally the epitome of reddit . 
  - `` women just do n't choose good jobs ! '', 
  - `` yeah , why is that , could it be humans are n't isolated from their environments and culture ? '', 
  `` citation needed ! '', 
  - * gives citation *, 
  - *** downvoted ***, 
  ca n't get better than this at * actually proving our point . 
   that 's exactly what you 're saying . 
  no it 's like literally exactly not what i 'm saying, 
   whether you mean to or not , you 're coincidentally saying discrimination is okay when men are being shit on and bad when women are being shit on . 
  wait let me guess you also think racism against whites is a huge issue right ? 
  or is that the next level of your progression into a reactionary asshole ? 
   why are most of the homeless male ? 
  wait let me hear what * you 're * doing about it because bringing it up when you need to shit on feminists on reddit ai n't doing ** shit . 
   new black panthers, 
  yeah lol basically the same thing as kkk, 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  the black panthers were n't supremacist . 
  this is a common misconception , where people try to minimize the influence of actual nazis in communities close-by ( reddit and some subs - 4chan ) . 
  this is like the millionth time i 'm doing this . 
  go to / pol / . 
  these people are ** literal ** nazis . 
  they cross-post from stormfront . 
  they discuss ` white genocide ' and how to keep their countries ` pure ' . 
  these are not jokes , unless you also believe hitler was pretty funny and harmless -- like most of the world thought until late 30 's . 
  ** all ** i have to do to prove you wrong , is go to / pol / and simply copy-paste stuff from there into my comment , but for now that 's not necessary . 
  sure , there 's a pretty big number of computer-savvy edgy teenagers there who make memes . 
  so what ? 
  there are fascists facebook pages , in fact some of the most popular ones on facebook right now with literal `` fashy '' and `` goyim '' in their names , who also make ironic memes . 
  does n't make them any less nazi . 
  pretty much everyone relevant to politics , 
  it 's not . 
  4chan used to be chaotic . 
  now it 's pretty much neo-nazi due to the / pol / ` containing ' stormfront posters and edgelords so efficiently . 
  swear to god , / g / is not about tech anymore , but about right-wing politics in tech . 
   charlie is tito ( idiot of the bunch ), 
   which leaves sweet dee as lenin ( loose cannon ), 
  these two do n't really work , tito was n't dumb idk where you got that from , and lenin was hardly a loose cannon, 
  i mean * obvioisly it 's funny to you guys . 
  * it was funny to me . 
  but holy shit imagine if someone commented on your facebook with a reference to a piece of pop culture completely unknown to you or probably everyone who reads your facebook , lets say a makeup joke or something . 
  that 's cringe 101 . 
  the joke funny to her or her friends she 's just confused . 
  i mean * obvioisly it 's funny to you guys . 
  * it was funny to me . 
  but holy shit imagine if someone commented on your facebook with a reference to a piece of pop culture completely unknown to you or probably everyone who reads your facebook , lets say a makeup joke or something . 
  that 's cringe 101 . 
  the joke is n't funny to her or her friends she 's just confused . 
  it 's not fun for her or anyone reading that post . 
  it 's still cringe and people saying it 's funny to them are missing the point . 
  it 's not that she does n't understand , it 's about him knowing she does n't and still posting it . 
  the fact that it 's public is what * makes * it cringey . 
  like imagine being on a party and dropping an mlp reference which no one gets . 
  but it 's even worse because you knew no one would get it * and still chose to fucking say it . 
  these statuses are pathetic but they 're socially acceptable . 
  i 'm not defending her or anything , i really do n't care , i 'm simply pointing out that people who are saying that it 's funny to them are missing the point . 
  it 's as funny as talking about buttershy 's tail to a group of regular people . 
   once something is public anything can be said . 
  yeah and it can also be unfunny , cringey , or socially unacceptable , which is what this is about . 
  how funny a joke is depends on the context . 
  if you ca n't comprehend the difference between going around and dropping obscure references to people * you know wo n't get them * , and actually using them in appropriate context , i have nothing more to say to you . 
  this is literally a `` no u '' - level response, 
  i literally said i think it 's funny . 
  both for me and for this forum . 
  but analyzing why it 's cringey in that particular context seems to be unpopular here so people are purpusefully misinterpreting what i said . 
  they look similar if you care about those things specifically . 
  as a communist i consider them also products of a liberal ideology , and dont see much of a difference between a liberalism and a fascism in the sense that they 're both bourgeois ideologies .
