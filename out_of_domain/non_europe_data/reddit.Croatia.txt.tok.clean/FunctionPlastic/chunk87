   what happens right now in north korea is exactly the same what happened in the soviet union . 
  lmao that nuance, 
   the soviet union systematically deported and murdered different races/peoples for the sake of even distribution and creation of the single ` soviet man ' . 
  absolutely wrong . 
  the soviets supported the international liberation of oppressed people . 
  they often criticized the u.s. for being racist both domestically and through imperialism . 
  they had posters lauding mlk , even . 
  cooperated with every race and ethnicity on the planet to achieve their liberation . 
  well since bernie is not a socialist i do n't even understand why he used that word . 
  he 's a social democrat . 
  no it does n't lmao . 
  those are words that have definitions , and social democracy and socialism are not synonymous . 
  source : lives in europe, 
  is it though ? 
  why do you think that ? 
  i mean there 's a union of `` socialists '' and democrats in the ep , but even that does n't invalidate basic political theory . 
  socialism , whether you define it as `` the proletarian ideology '' or `` a stage between capitalism and communism '' , always involves two things : a violent revolution , and using state power to reach communism . 
  it 's always , also , anti-capitalist , obviously . 
  social democrats and reformists today are neither revolutionary nor anti-capitalist . 
  alright . 
  ours are plainly called the social-democratic party . 
  che called, 
  privilege is not everything . 
  it does not automatically invalidate someone 's position . 
  it 's simply a concept we should be more aware of , when people are making reactionary statements . 
  engels came from a bourgeois family , lenin was like half-aristocrat , so what ? 
  if they were reactionaries * then * we could examine their privilege . 
  you do n't say, 
  you 're all liberals . 
  i literally want a command economy and think the ussr was a good idea , not ironic , not trying to be edgy , just breaking the circlejerk because you people are incredibly boring . 
  edit : also i live in a former communist state so do n't even think about it, 
  space, 
  i too follow neon trotsky, 
  i only see dots like *** ? 
  wtf ? 
   furthermore , to pass on racial bias , the study would have to show that adult disapproval of one individual completely on the basis of their race results in the children 's disapproval of a completely different individual who shares the same race as the first disapproved individual , and the children are doing that using racial cues . 
  it might as well be a much more complex learning mechanism that you ca n't show through such a simplistic experiment . 
  we know racial bias in children is a thing , but we do n't know if frowning at a black person causes it . 
  stop posting and go check on your doritos - cs student, 
  i 'm utterly fascinated how this entire fox news phenomena is possible . 
  you believe you have free speech , but your definition of it is `` a much more powerful corporation is allowed to deceive us '' . 
  incredible . 
   leftists really are n't very good at parsing cause & effect , i see . 
   i will exploit that weakness ... 
  this looks so honestly dumb and childish to write , i ca n't even insult you with a neckbeard reference, 
  i 'm not even american . 
  dear god it 's not even funny how stupid you look, 
  edit : unless you 're trolling . 
  it 's pretty good . 
  i 'm not * mad * but i am intrigued and replying, 
  you 're arguing semantics . 
  lenin was very clear on this : while there are classes , there is a state . 
  you can not get rid of the state , without first completely restructuring the economy , and then the whole of society -- i.e. 
  getting rid of classes . 
  once classes are removed , only then can society be transformed into full communism . 
  socialism is exactly this first step : the state exists , but it 's under the control of the proletariat . 
  it has to exist , simply because a revolution is not enough to get rid of capitalism completely . 
  man did it feel satisfying when that downvote turned into a middle finger for this one, 
   camerae, 
  their ... rooms ? 
  theres something vaguely poetic about this concept, 
  pop two tabs of acid and see something similar but in 3d , changing through time , and with a lot richer color palette and abstract shapes, 
  mineral and sdre were my introductions to emo , and still the two fav bands of the genre , upvoted because your comment is quite interesting to me, 
   compared to copy and move semantics in c++ ? 
  the intricacies of pythons weird scoping rules ? 
  rusts borrow checker ? 
  yeah , on the same levels of rigidity , all of those things are an order of magnitude easier to understand than some haskell concepts . 
  dude i 'm an actual `` marxist-communist '' ( which is pleonasm because those terms are essentially equivalent and no one connects them ) , and holy shit you 're utterly hilarious, 
  words have definitions , and you 're using them wrongly . 
  just because your particular cultural environment attaches vague connotations to certain terms does n't mean you can rely on those connotations in every context ( such as when providing further information about those terms , which is what you 're trying to do ) -- socialism is defined as the transitional period towards communism , in which all industry is collectivized but certain bourgeois elements like the state and the some inequality still remain . 
  socialists and communists in almost every way are the same group of people , relying on the same ideological assumptions . 
  ( and no , the fact that some social-democratic or even liberal parties have `` socialist '' in their names does n't change that , it 's a historical matter not a politically relevant one . ), 
   which is socialism forcibly implemented by an authoritarian regime either political or military, 
  let 's pretend that it makes sense to write that in the way you think it does : you have it the opposite way around . 
  communism is a ** stateless ** society . 
  socialism is a transitional period towards communism which * utilizes the state * . 
  marx and engels called this period the `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' . 
  educate yourself jesus christ it 's cringeworthy to read comments in this thread, 
  you literally have no idea what you 're talking about , this is painful to read, 
  and i 'm essentially the complete opposite of an anarchist ideologically, 
  educate yourself . 
  not because i care , but so that i have to see less of this garbage on the internet, 
   but that was literally two thousand years ago in hellenistic greece, 
  no it was like two hundred and some years ago actually during the bourgeois revolutions in europe, 
  i instinctively downvoted you when i saw `` crony '' capitalism then i realized you were n't giving the cookiecutter liberal argument for capitalism but attacking it , glad to see this on reddit, 
  that 's literally a random dude calling you out , not me . 
  you are laughable , that 's me . 
  sadly , completely normal , not insane . 
  lmao i do have to work on my praxis got me there, 
  you ... do realize that `` free , sovereign individual citizens '' referred to ** a small minority of literal slave-owners ** , right ? 
  the bourgeois revolutions although aesthetically inspired by antiquity had a * completely different * ideology -- that of liberalism . 
   therefore , in their minds , reagan and obama are entirely the same , because neither wanted to destroy international commerce like they do . 
  which i think is actually the more correct and objective view . 
  you 're merely assuming that the left-liberal ideology is the only correct way to form a political framing . 
  i did i did , afterwards , 
  let 's finish this quickly , you do n't know what neoliberalism is . 
  i do n't use that word as a slur , i use it to describe a specific * political movement and moment * , which oversaw the slow deconstruction of the welfare state especially after the fall of the official communist movement and the acceleration of globalization . 
  obama and clinton are the perfect examples of the neoliberal establishment . 
  reagan might have started it all , but these people sure are continuing it . 
  i mean obviously i was being a bit hyperbolic , anarchists are alright ,
