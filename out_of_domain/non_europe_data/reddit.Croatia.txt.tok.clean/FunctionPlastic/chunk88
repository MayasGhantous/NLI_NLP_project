  i do n't think that 's a concrete ideology though, 
  top kek / 10, 
  please give me sources for those stalin 's stances . 
  literally look up basic political theory on like wikipedia or whatever , you 're spouting nonsense . 
  unless you 're one of those people who believe nazi germany was socialist/communist , no hope for you then . 
   just like russia is not too, 
  are you actually this stupid is this real life, 
  i feel second-hand shame because of how uneducated you are in basic political theory and world events . 
  at this point i do n't believe you could point to russia on the world map . 
   lighting fires while protesting fascism is the same as killing dozens random civilians in the name of it !, 
  liberals never cease to amaze me, 
   that 's where it becomes terrorism defined as something intended to provoke terror or fear . 
  terrorism is intentional mass killings , this is being dumb . 
  raf , unabomber , and ira are examples of left-wing terrorism , angry american kids with fireworks just are n't . 
  there 's fuzzbox, 
  oh come on . 
  yes they get it . 
  they 're opportunistically dishonest . 
   a lot of this is covered in the much-hated , much-loved stalin did nothing wrong : the book by ludo martens, 
  uphold marxism-botism, 
  it would definitely be more appropriate, 
  contact central economic command to reallocate my comment to you idk, 
  then put then in another suit, 
  can confirm as a european . 
  this whole situation is utterly bizzare to me, 
  uhh ok but that 's totally different lol, 
  programming-wise events are most often implemented through a ` subscription ' system : ding 20 -  trigger actions subscribed to this event . 
  such as , unlock dungeon x. 
  so the guy above is probably correct, 
  yep , true, 
  i refuse to believe you are actually like this, 
   surgeries that transgender individuals should be paying for themselves, 
  what ? 
  gender dysphoria is an extremely serious medical condition , and the surgery is not aesthetic but ** life-saving ** . 
  i thought she was victarion 's concubine ? 
  oh shit that 's right i forgot, 
  i 'm on coke rn and i 'm histerical but i ca n't tell if it 's just reddit or coke : / /, 
  the best part is that i 'm also sick , the drips cause me to cough my stomach out . 
  i called in sick and did more coke, 
  ironically for once , the reddit community is really the moral vertical compared to the facebook community , even by ` sjw ' standards . 
  the main facebook group for r&m has been taking the last two episodes with quite some . . difficulty . 
  and by difficulty i mean there was a point where 90 % of the posts , comments , and memes , were literally , and i mean ** literally ** , `` women biologically are n't funny '' . 
  it was n't even political or masked like misogyny can be on reddit , it was ** just honestly stupid . 
   however , i can see this episode failing you if you had high hopes for the story in season 3, 
  wait but this * was * about the story ?? 
  you know , character development and shit ? 
  am not american , can confirm, 
  i 'm just saying the show now follows a paradigm . 
  for now . 
  maybe they 'll go back in the next episode . 
  maybe in the next season . 
  or maybe they 'll just reinvent themselves again ? 
  i approve of everything they 've done thus far , i 'm here to see * more * of it . 
  and i generally have a positive view of change when it 's handled well . 
  especially if it 's radical . 
  but yeah , all of that shit especially rick 's past is sort of established arbitrarily , not through a narrative with a point behind it . 
  a fucking ` bird person ' shows up to a kalaxian crystal party and tells morty * oh you know your grandpa 's considered a terrorist and has like a __ reeeeally __ complex and emotional past *, 
  that 's called exposition . 
  the last two episodes were story-telling in their fullest sense . 
  they had a consistent plot both internally and externally . 
  yeeeeah i 'm down , i feel ashamed for lying about not knowing it was 100 % just coke , but i 'm not deleting shit in order to punish myself . 
  i am going to do more coke though since punishment does n't actually contribute to functional behavior . 
  learn on my parents ' mistakes , because i sure as fuck did not . 
   picking, 
  edit : im going to krombopulos michael myself, 
   for me rick and morty is a lot about breaking expectations and surprise . 
  this is the articulation of how i feel about the show i was looking for !, 
  you 're wasting your time on reddit tbh, 
  yes , that 's what tetanus does . 
  google the images , the back ` arching ' is straight out of a horror movie . 
  jfc , you sure it was n't 300 ? 
  when i tried researching monads i found some very confusing information out there . 
  most of it using haskell as an example and context . 
  i understand the basic idea why monads are called `` programmable semicolons '' - they chain operations together and allow for better composition of functions . 
  but to get anywhere further i 'd have to know haskell , which i do n't . 
  i know scala , and since it 's also a functional language , i thought that there might be some tutorials on monads that use scala as an example . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  is n't the rational position to support success and acceptance based on merit ? 
  is n't preferring one group over another like that institutional racism and sexism ? 
  i do understand that there are biases against women ( e.g. 
  a woman with the same skillset is less likely to be admitted to some position or something like that ) , especially in it which is my field , but how is making `` reverse '' biases ( that are even institutional ! ), 
  morally justifiable ? 
  first , i hope i 'm not posting in the wrong sub . 
  the topic of this post is mainly operating systems but also computer hardware and pure computer science ( programming languages , compilers ) . 
  moving on ... 
  in his talk , [ the birth & death of javascript ] ( https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript ) , gary bernhardt starts talking about a project called asm.js ( around 4:50 ) . 
  essentially what asm.js is supposed to do is to make it really easy to efficiently optimize ( jit ) javascript code . 
  it is a subset of the language , and resembles an assembly language . 
  currently it seems to be used as a compile target for c and c++ . 
  the presentation shows various examples of this : you take a python vm , made in c , compile it to asm.js - and run it in the browser !, 
  it works perfectly . 
  then they show a video game running at close to native performance ( 0.5 x ) . 
  at around 10:00 , the idea of porting entire development suites comes around . 
  basically you can see gcc being used via zsh inside chrome to compile c code into asm.js , and then running that `` binary '' ( c -  asm.js , not native ! ), 
  inside zsh . 
  at 14:10 , he begins presenting the problems which modern hardware and operating systems are intended to solve : mainly process isolation , via virtual memory and protection rings . 
  however , these methods used by traditional systems incur significant ovearhead whenever interfacing with the kernel - interrupts , switching rings , switching vm tables , etc. 
  the suggested solution is to have process isolation implemented using software - namely ** asm.js-enabled javascript virtual machines embedded in a linux kernel ** , which save you from needing hardware isolation , reducing overhead . 
  gary calls this idea * metal * ( not sure if that 's an official name of any project yet ) . 
  interesting quote that gets the point across quite nicely :,
