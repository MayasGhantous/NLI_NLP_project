  and they 've been dead for quite some time now . 
  there are/were many exploits for javascript and flash especially , if that 's what you 're referring to . 
  but the jvm has a very different purpose than a js vm , which is designed for the browser . 
  jvm simply should n't be running such code because it can do more damage and browser security is an afterthought , whereas javascript has very strict constraints . 
  these were not vulnerabilities in java per se - you usually trust your programming languages - but problems in the idea itself . 
  you ** can ** execute your developers ' code on your server with much greater permissions than you can some random java code - in fact , you never should . 
  did n't he take like 6 years to write the last book , which was published only the years ago ? 
  is he really that close to publishing twow ? 
  practically any modern language . 
  for example , java . 
  so you think that in javascript , or enterprise applications , programmers should be managing memory because ... ? 
  or should be using a non-standard library to do that , because ? 
  that which you suggested sounds * very * impractical because it 's one of the main criteria we use to even ** define ** high level languages . 
  you could n't really implement efficient garbage collection in javascript or java as an * afterthought * , firstly because you ca n't access the actual memory , so you 'd have to drastically change the languages . 
  android developers ? 
  ndk is very unpopular . 
  people actually use java . 
   they did n't make c # so completely different from anything else, 
  i can only think of obscure academic languages that actually are different from anything else , so this argument is moot . 
  how ? 
  they did their very best to harm mono ( all those c # standards shenanigans ) . 
  and they definitely do n't support them . 
  you misunderstood me . 
  my point was that learning * any * of the top languages `` puts you in a position to learn a few other similar languages for other platforms '' . 
  i wanted to show how that similarity is completely disconnected from the fact that the programming language is largely aimed at a single platform . 
  of course , that is n't true for `` obscure academic languages '' - such as coq , or haskell , because you 'll spend a great amount of time dealing with concepts that simply do n't exist in the majority of popular languages . 
  essentially , if you pick a language that * does not * have the feature you assigned to c # ( essentially the ability to translate concepts to/from other languages easily ) - then it 's most likely a language that 's not well used anyway . 
  * i can only thing of ... * seems like a subjective statement because it 's just colloquial speech . 
  it just so happens that i do actually as a developer know that the popular languages share a lot of features in common , and that if you learn c++ , c , java , c # - you 'll gon na learn some of them . 
  they 're still not obligated to support competitors . 
  and afaik they have n't open sourced the clr , which is the central component of . net , and it would be great if someone linked me to an open standard of c # . 
  you think that they can just go ` fuck it ' and find a job one day ? 
  their women are very oppressed for starters , and there are incredible structural pressures inside their communities . 
  they are sometimes slaves to their elders and are only thought to beg . 
  levels of literacy are very low . 
  your decision to quit playing video games and get a job at mc donald 's ( joking , do n't get offended ) is a completely alien concept for them , because you 've been getting societie 's help your whole life ( simply going to school and not having to worry much about getting fed , for example ) . 
  so you just storm in one day and take their children by force , that will fix all the problems right ? 
  how very ... european of you . 
  you know , such simplistic ideas have already been tried . 
  look up the lost generation in australia . 
  and for your information , there are people who are working with improving the roma 's condition . 
  but it usually does n't involve things like genocide .

  yeah , i 'm sure all options have already been tried , and i guess that multiple projects that i know of that are still working with roma 's are just my imagination . 
  never mind that merely 70 years ago we tried to mass-exterminate them in the holocaust and continued destroying them . 
  but since you 're the expert , i guess the roma really do simply choose to live like they live out of the blue !, 
  he has n't shown how it would work . 
  at all . 
  in fact it has already been tried and it destroyed the lives of thousands and only made the situation worse . 
  look up the lost generation in australia . 
  also ever heard of the holocaust ? 
  you 've successfully emulated the roma crime lord mentality and you do n't even see the irony . 
  so you 're a cop that had to deal with roma criminals and then you extrapolated then to the whole population . 
  not a very logical thing to do . 
  i 'm not denying of course that they are much more problematic then the rest of society , but stating that `` all roma 's are evil '' is about as unproductive as it gets . 
  yes , you are racist . 
  first you make a giant generalization , second , instead of showing * any * will to actually analyze the problem or solve it - you choose to hate them all . 
  believe it or not , these behaviors have their causes , they do n't just choose them . 
  roma girls do n't choose to get pregnant at 13 . 
  roma children do n't choose to rob people . 
  your mentality of hate is a part of the problem . 
  aha , ok , my mistake, 
  i thought it a real word ; _ ;, 
  no , it would n't , because it does n't work . 
  you are obviously very irrational about this topic , so you 're speaking out of hate . 
  you do n't know anything about these projects and just make assumptions . 
  no they do n't . 
  their children and women are often forced into slavery , and this very thread is an example of rampant discrimination . 
  the guy next to you is calling for genocide and receiving multiple upvotes , and so are many others - and you just claim they can decide one day and get a job . 
  what a joke !, 
  no fucking way, 
  while in oxford i saw the pub where they used to exchange their ideas daily . 
  i 'm very fond of that memory . 
  how does that compare to the hyper 212 evo ? 
  which seems to be quite popular on the internet ... 
  wow way to downplay the work actual volunteers do . 
  reddit , not hostile to women at all, 
  i feel like a lot of people who enjoy this kind of stuff would love linux . 
  the whole system is laid out very transparently and lets you do absolutely anything . 
  some linux desktops , like gnome , are built using javascript and css , so practically anyone can tweak anything about their system . 
  here 's a poster that has some distro recommendations : http://i.imgur.com/bvz7p6f.jpg, 
  personally i 'd recommend ubuntu or fedora . 
  why would you ever do that to an operating system ? 
  like , what 's the point ? 
  why are people downvoting this ? 
  the interview is of really good quality , and bi asked just the right questions . 
  linus did a great part in making it a very entertaining and inspiring read . 
  can you finish ?
