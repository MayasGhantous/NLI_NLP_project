  of course . 
  why is there a guy ... on moy tindah ? 
  yes . 
  this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen . 
  it got me thinking about a commonly overlooked artistic medium , and the theories that circulate reagarding its authenticity make it even more appealing .

  feel free to go by and say hi , matt is super cool and he will answer all of your questions . 
  he 's out of town for the weekend , but he 'll be back on monday .
