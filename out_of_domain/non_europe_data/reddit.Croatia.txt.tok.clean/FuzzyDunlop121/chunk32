  see if he can shorten the top so it 's not so bushy, 
  based on op 's username , i would guess he/she is croatian or serbian , so probably not a native english speaker .

  the most egregious thing about this picture is the chain tension on his bike, 
  yo that guy at the end was fantastically chill, 
  i just bought a bike with an ultegra group and i 'd like to replace it with sram red or campagnolo record . 
  what 's a fair price to sell my group for ? 
  i 'm doing a 30-min meeting of my school 's cycling club , which is primarily geared toward group rides , but we have to do some meetings in school . 
  any ideas for what to do ? 
  it 's primarily roadies with some mountain bikers . 
  i do n't know if further clarification is needed , but maybe you find a way to start a nuclear war and count on mutually assured destruction to destroy the regime and set you free . 
  as satan says in paradise lost , `` better to reign in hell than serve in heaven '' . 
  make me both hate and respect you . 
  i 'm looking at the 11nine direwolf , which is a fatbike with full suspension . 
  as ridiculous as it sounds , the area in which i live actually makes it worth riding . 
  do fatbikes handle poorly due to their weight and tire width ? 
  will i still be able to ride dh and do some fast shredding or will the fatty not handle very well ? 
  i 'm about to finish finals and i would love to hit the road with some people this upcoming weekend . 
  i live in washington , dc . 
  i 'd like to do a 30-40 mile road ride with a 17-20 average speed . 
  if you want to find someone to ride with , post your city below and the type of riding you do , and see if there are any other r/bicycling redditors who want to ride with you !, 
  edit : is there any particular reason that you would downvote this ? 
  sorry for trying to get people together . 
  from the videos of professional and amateur curling that i have watched , there seems to be little physical prowess needed to play successfully . 
  there is no lifting and no sustained effort required . 
  the person who launches the stone must make an effort to keep the stone moving straight , but this is a fairly simple process . 
  additionally , estimating the optimal speed at which to release the stone can probably be learned fairly quickly , and retained through latent memory . 
  the player doing the `` sweeping '' must simply gauge the speed of the stone , and whether it is faster or slower than optimal . 
  while i acknowledge that this requires some skill , it is not enough to classify curling as a sport . 
  to me , curling is in the same league as recreational games , such as shuffleboard and minigolf . 
  change my view , as i hope to watch the 2014 olympic games with an appreciation of curling . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : words, 
  i 'm on k street and there have been tons of police cars , ambulances , and three police boats running up river . 
  does anyone know what the reason is ? 
  i hate saying `` der junge isst einen apfel '' only to have duolingo interpret that as `` der junge isst ** ein ** apfel '', 
  there should be a button that says `` submit '' , so if there 's a problem with the voice recognition , you can re-record before it grades you . 
  this is the bike in question : http://www.pinarello.com/en/bike2014/fixie/catena, 
  i appreciate the vintage look , and i would be willing to upgrade the wheelset and switch the crank to dura-ace or something similar . 
  the question is : does anyone have one / know about it ? 
  are the hubs good ? 
  is it comfortable ? 
  thanks, 
  i know sram has 1 to 1 , but they make some exceptions . 
  does anyone know which those are ? 
  i 'm building a bike frame out of wood . 
  i need a type of wood that 's stiff but not brittle , and relatively light . 
  i will cut the wood down into dowels and then create carbon fiber lugs . 
  roses are red, 
  violets are blue, 
  they say it do n't be like it is , but it do . 
  when i came down , i realized it was just a magnifier . 
  chanko nabe is a japanese stew . 
  however , most japanese restaurants do not have it . 
  i 'd like to find a restaurant , preferably somewhat authentic , where i can get chanko nabe ( also known as sumo stew ) .

  as the title says , i 'm 18 and i would like to buy my first bike . 
  i 'm hoping to spend around 2000 dollars . 
  i want a standard/naked bike with the capacity to mount saddle bags . 
  i would like something that is n't too crazy powerful . 
  here are a few options from my local craigslist ( washington dc ) that i 'm looking at . 
  [ 1981 suzuki gs750l ] ( http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/mcy/4788634237.html ), 
  [ 1998 honda shadow vts 750 ] ( http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/mcy/4780901947.html ),

  i 'm wondering if socialism has ever * not * led to authoritarianism . 
  basically i 'm trying to win a debate by claiming that , historically , giving the government control over the economy inevitably opens the door for government control over speech , ideology , assembly , and dissent . 
  can anyone provide a counterexample ?
