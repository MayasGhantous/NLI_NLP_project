  after a while , it starts to get boring . 
  entertainment has value too . 
  you could use an aluminum shim to take up the extra diameter , otherwise just measure the diameter of the shifter mount and look for the tube diameter on each pair of bullhorns you look at . 
  try 3t for good bars . 
  the title of this post makes it sound like any pair of gloves will work , when this is in fact a plug for a particular pair of gloves . 
  perhaps in the future be more specific ? 
  not at all . 
  i 'm advocating variety . 
  you want noise ? 
  check out / r/adviceanimals . 
  ( just kidding , do n't bother going there ), 
  are we talking bar end shifters or something that mounts on the outside of the bar ? 
  ** update as of 12/10/13 : ** specialized ceo mike sinyard has personally apologized to the owner of the store , and has withdrawn the threat of lawsuit . .

  probably not / r/bicycling . 
  not feeling nervous enough about rollers ? 
  here 's a trick to help you get tangled up and crash !, 
  sorry , you 're a little late to the ... party . 
  that 's incredible . 
  i 'm addicted to bike building videos , can you recommend any more ? 
  is it cold out ? 
  sram just recalled some of their red hydros for failing in the cold , maybe you have a similar problem . 
  i 'd say red . 
  sram has a sketchy track record with non-mechanical components ( hydro rim/disc recall ) . 
  if you want electronic , think about di2 or super record eps . 
  just my $ 0.02 . 
  ca n't wait to see the pics when you upgrade !, 
  bmcs are amazing , definitely some of the best frame quality out there . 
  it boggles the mind how a frame can be so laterally stiff but vertically compliant . 
  there 's zero flex when pedaling , and then you go over a bump without even knowing it . 
  try out something less luxurious like a sl01 or rm01 . 
  i ride an rm01 and i would n't trade it for anything . 
  except an impec . 
  i want an impec . 
  i 'm mother fucking jens voigt , you know ? 
  something something look at the trees . 
  schleck is drafting behind voigt to reduce air resistance, 
   saw you blow past a lot of red lights, 
  this is how alleycat works .

  you see solo attacks in the alps because mountain stages space out the peloton .

  shimano to sram is always an upgrade in my book . 
  yes , the things you said are also right . 
  are you happy now ? 
  i do n't know much about their coverage of races , i mostly read about tech . 
  our taxis ' ids are a letter and three numbers . 
  new dura-ace 9000 is probably the best-shifting mechanical gruppo , but you ca n't beat doubletap when it comes to the feeling of the shifter in your hand and the quality of the shifting motion . 
  ouch . 
  it happens . 
  i still like sram though , but to each their own . 
  every build should be meticulous . 
  unless your customers do n't want the best service possible ... 
  downtube . 
  but yes . 
  the specialized fuelselage system, 
  if you want to spend some money , you can do a di2 build with tri shifters on the bullhorns . 
  this will only do 11 speed though . 
  passport . 
  stick ... stick your dick in it . 
  correct . 
  these are light , affordable , and virtually bombproof . 
  do n't buy chinese unless you are willing to experience catastrophic equipment failure and personal injury . 
  and before you downvote me , [ google it ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=chinese+carbon+failure&amp;amp;oq=chinese+carbon+fa&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l3&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;hl=en-us&amp;amp;espv=1 ), 
  suuuuure , because chinese knockoff companies care about their customers ' safety and can be easily held accountable for their actions . 
  trek puts their frames through a battery of test to make sure they stand up to the rigors of riding . 
  knockoff companies do n't give a shit , as long as they make money . 
  pinarello takes their inspiration from salvador dal\u00ed . 
  i was laying on my bed with a freshly broken rib watching top gear . 
  clarkson said some funny shit and i started laughing , then immediately began to cry from the pain . 
  american mechanic here . 
  i 've never heard it called anything but a derailleur . 
  this was a while ago , but i remember * everything * hurt . 
  tr01 is carbon though . 
  it has slr01 geometry and it 's absolutely gorgeous . 
  damn . 
  how did his tubular come off ? 
  was it not glued on well ? 
  hmm . 
  that 's really strange . 
  but i would think that pros have good mechanics who would prevent such a failure . 
  or maybe the tire was tubeless , in which case it 's a little bit more reasonable ( ? ), 
  for this to happen . 
  our usernames . 
  love it . 
  absolutely . 
  i 've found that people here are usually very nice unless you stand in their way on the metro escalators . 
  or drive slowly . 
  or have opposing political views . 
  yes . 
  it 's from a cracked `` photoplasty '' contest . 
  lookin good , op . 
  let me know how the trp hyrd brakes feel . 
  i 've always been curious about mechanical-hydraulic hybrid systems . 
  yup . 
  they are n't abbreviations , just brand names . 
  the hyrd system allows you to combine the versatility and easy availability of cable brake levers with the smooth modulation of hydraulic disc brakes . 
  this allows the use of shifters/brakes with no hydraulic equivalent . 
  for example , i can use a standard mechanical 105 gruppo with cable brakes , and then connect the cables to the hyrds , where the cable drives a piston in a hydraulic cylinder on the brake , [ like so ] ( http://www.trpbrakes.com/category.php?productid=1198&amp;catid=206&amp;subcat=0 ) .
