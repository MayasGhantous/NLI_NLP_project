  let me know how it goes . 
  x-post = / = repost, 
  incredible videos of woodworking , metalworking , pottery , and other craftsmanship . 
  why do they appear to be almost touching ? 
  wallpaper and icon theme please , 
  i had an industrial paint stripper gun with a label, 
  ** do not use as a hair dryer **, 
  yes but there is no need to write intro 's . 
  intros will do . 
  then do n't be an illiterate fuck . 
  you 're a genius, 
  it would find its way here anyway . 
  everyone chill . 
  grateful dead , affectionately referred to as ` dead ' . 
  and phish is a real name . 
  google it . 
  mine is : this lan is my lan, 
  lik dys if u wifi everytim, 
  shut up . 
  shut up !, 
  shut up !, 
  * shut up * !, 
  shut ** up ** !, 
  shut up !, 
  shut up ? 
  * shut * up !, 
  i was once traveling by megabus and someone hacked the wifi and changed the name to mega shitty internet . 
  plug for / r/mildlyinfuriating, 
  yes , and by upvoting and sharing this stuff , you just * became * old spice 's marketing department . 
  probably to guide the captain , although it looks pretty badass . 
  i love that jehova 's witnesses are so puritanical , yet one of them clearly volunteered to mimic ejaculating on his own face . 
  to me , this is * the perfect * nononono video , because you have no idea what 's about to happen , and a million things could go wrong . 
  i was expecting him to fall and be hit by a scooter , or to fall over the barrier onto the highway . 
  this video had me wincing in white-knuckle terror . 
  i like it . 
  pictured : your tax dollars at work, 
  yep . 
  that and the $ 12,000 bmc impec . 
  buy a tea infuser ball and cut it up . 
  alternately , go to a hardware store and buy a faucet aerator . 
  that was incredible . 
  although i ca n't help but feel that that ` tailpiece ' really threw the lettering off balance and made it too loopy . 
  what, 
  you . 
  i like you . 
  one last forlorn call of resignation, 
  because it 's a endless image of walter white 's oscillating wrinkles . 
  yeah , i saw this when i was about 12 . 
  it was a huge mistake . 
  thanks !, 
  glad you like ( ? ), 
  i would n't try to search for deep existential insight from a youtube video . 
  just watch it and rid your eyes of excess water , okay ? 
  i think the takeaway is that it 's better to die fulfilled than it is to live in mediocrity and dissatisfaction . 
  the kiwi gave his life to experience flight , and probably ended up happier than if he had continued to live on the ground . 
  i respect this guy 's passion , but i was n't really impressed with what he made . 
  i have been throwing for four years , and in my experience , people make pots like that one within their first month on the wheel , and then move on to better things . 
  no offense intended , but i 'm sure he could do better . 
  a jebiga , fake internet points, 
  unless they look like a bitch, 
  okay bic boi , i wan da boosack noodews and a oran-gee chicken . 
  that 's the most grotesque thing i 've ever seen . 
  i love it . 
  church , yo . 
  sounds gucci, 
  mechanic here !, 
  that is unfortunately pretty accurate . 
  i love most of the customers , but the other day i had a lady come in asking to buy a road bike to ride across the country on . 
  while i was helping her zero in on what she wanted ( think 20-questions - cycling edition ) she helpfully chimed in `` hey , look at this bike over here !, 
  i can lean down and rest my elbows on the handlebars !, 
  that 's perfect for a cross-country ride '' - as in a fucking time trial bike . 
  edit : here , i made a thing http://i.imgur.com/ah0cmke.gif, 
  sorry , i was n't sure if you knew about r/croatia . 
  if your hands get cold on the water , pogies are the answer . 
  they are gloves that attach to the shaft of your paddle , while leaving your hands in direct contact with the paddle , so there is no loss of grip . 
  pogies are the bomb . 
  i recommend [ these ] ( http://nextadventure.net/glacier-glove-fleece-lined-pogies.html?catargetid=1440609499&amp;cadevice= { device } & gclid = cjq-koliobwcfwyaogodpxgazg ) . 
  smile , explain the purpose of a tt bike , steer her toward the bike she actually needed . 
  she eventually just walked around the store pointing to pretty looking bikes . 
  then she asked if we could do custom paint jobs . 
  when i told her we could n't , she left . 
  i was super friendly , but it took everything i had . 
  i always respect the customer , even when he/she does n't know anything at all . 
  i care about my shop 's reputation and keeping people happy . 
  she also asked me to show her a bike `` similar to a cervelo '', 
  what . 
  fair enough , but not deciding to buy them based solely on appearance . 
  yes . 
  he 's actually an ostrich . 
  i 'm laying in bed sick and your comment made me feel a little better . 
  have some mother fucking reddit gold on me . 
  i mean sure , use di2 sprint or climbing shifters , remove the paddles from the sram shifters and use them as brake levers only . 
  yeah it could happen . 
  `` yeah i know the tire has an inch-long gash in it , but i do n't want to replace it . 
  money does n't grow on trees , you know '' . 
  says the lady on a $ 1400 commuter with a continuously variable transmission built into the rear hub . 
  disclaimer : i do n't know what gold actually does, 
  still be able to doubletap with di2 ? 
  you 'd have to work really hard to make it happen , but i guess you could . 
  you 'd have to re-write the sprint shifters to shift down as well .
