  the minute you venture into multiple data connections with star or snowflake data models in the background nothing beats qix engine who is doing associations on the fly and for you . 
  with power bi or tableau you will need to work hard and understand properly database design to get the best of it . 
   `` maybe a simple script . 
  it does n't compare to power bi for data preparation without having to know code though . '', 
  you do n't need a single line of code to prepare the data in qlik sense also , so i do n't understand your argument here . 
   `` that 's a developer function . 
  power bi has embedded which has a great pricing model which is much easier to afford than qlik if that 's all you want to do . '', 
  oh . . not true : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rinc2c_5xu8, 
  dear tim , you need to understand the difference between the candy dashboards and proper ones . 
  do some reading please . 
  same here , mostly stuck on the loading map screen . 
  now and then managed to get thru thou . 
  anything to make u a better man tim ] : - , 
  er . . no . . that was true in 2014 . . not anymore . 
  now on prem its ssrs + zen ( old name ) . 
  power bi is cloud only ( btw says so on power bi pages too . . ) link :, 
  `` power bi is a ** cloud-based ** business analytics service that yada yada ... '', 
  here from microsoft mouth : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfscrnbx4za&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=48m38s, 
   few evenings in at home on power bi so i get a decent feel for it . 
  thats great , just try to connect more then 2-3 tables with power bi and see how much more time you will need to spend to have a full view of data as you would in qlik ( qix engine ftw  ), 
  if most of my points are a fact , tell me , am i lying ? 
  no its not . 
  it about ** considering ** to move to power bi . 
  i agree , was there done that , but notice how things get damn complicated damn quickly the minute you decide to go on prem . 
  not the mention the issues making all working nicely in harmony ... 
  well and guess how many people in 1955 worked in google , or facebook , oracle , ibm or microsoft ? 
  almost . 
  too bad he missed the camera shot of his life, 
  well they have canceled again my preorder . 
  again . 
  and no reply from the support . 
  again . 
  and that proves exactly what ? 
  here is how :, 
  a ) pay pr firm to create xyz reddit accounts, 
  b ) pay pr firm to write replies like yours and glide your original post, 
  c ) pay pr firm to buy gold and give it to you, 
  hope you have learned something today : - /, 
  a great video tutorial for you, 
  mike monteiro - `` f * ck you pay me '', 
  well , i have cats . . so thats a big no no lol , 
  glad it works for you thou !, 
  so what does madeliene albright and the people that run this kind of policy deserves ? 
  `` madeleine albright says 500,000 dead iraqi children was ` worth it ' '', 
  also there is a free version too , with 2 planes so you can try it . 
  highly recommended . 
  uh oh . . well i would never even try to use anything other than joystick with that game , 
  i do have xbox controller but never tried . . 
  try qlik sense , not qlik view . 
  you can download fully functional ( not trial ) qlik sense desktop version and see how it works for you . 
  of course qlik sense desktop comes without security and governance for that you would need qlik sense enterprise . 
  qlik help youtube channel with tons of tutorials :, 
  qlik youtube channel ( even more stuff ) : https://www.youtube.com/user/qlikview/videos, 
  power bi is not a bi . 
  it is a shell . 
  for proper ms bi you need sql server . 
  yeah that is so damn sad . 
  as plane looks almost undamaged and for sure landed quite gently and well safely , how come pilot did not managed to escape ? 
  any more info ? 
  bullshit , i have rift that was working for 5 days and now is dead . 
  so i will up-vote op and down-vote you . 
  if there would be trash reward , i would give you that too . 
  oh damn it , such a sad chain of events :(, 
  yeah i have the same issue it seems . 
  rift was working for a few days then stopped . 
  tbh i think it is a software issue . . some windows/nividia/oculus update had broke something, 
  oh man just bring back some a1s !, 
  just tried to access https://torguard.net/ , no luck :(, 
  for me pucara is super sexy, 
  but i think a1 would be perfect , its big ( resistant ) can carry ridiculous amount of armament and ( relatively ) cheap !, 
  if bil gates come back to you and says pick a plane to fight those poachers , and i would buy it for you - what would it be ? 
  * air tractor at-802 - military specs, 
  oh some .50 s and plate of armor would do just fine , cmon , 
  this is so true . 
  such a shame he did not have a vest ... 
  amen to that buying it now too !, 
  preporucam giants of space , lucky tale i standardne cv1 demoe . 
  and that is simply not true its the camera setup for the vive in this case, 
  agree 100 % !, 
  i was very disappointed when they announced tww , but i bough it anyway ( as i do all tw games ), 
  i am having such a blast !!!, 
  and each fraction plays so differently !, 
  having tons of fun with heroes . 
  i was in the same boat , was playing as empire mostly then tried warriors of chaos - man so much fun !, 
  looks great !, 
  is there some kind of mod where u can properly test it with waves of enemies that get more numerous and stronger at each pass ? 
  that would be super cool, 
  they have online store, 
  ... and then you are grateful it was n't you ... 
  it looks to me like they were firing from the pylons and then something went wrong with the charges ? 
  i do n't see missile flying towards them at all ... 
  actualy it does not look at all . 
  if you look carefully you can see that hind is firing rockets and then looks like a rocket malfunction that explodes in the pylon and that breaks the back rotor, 
  maybe , just maybe , she took the job to move away from you ? 
  and even if you get the job ( no way ) you think your rosters would match ? 
  just let it go man . 
  btw i am in uae and cant access the article without the vpn . . 
  i am amazed that from all the smart people in great country like usa , you have to choose between two terrible people for the job . 
  it is a clear sign there is something ( a lot ) broken in the process . 
  you seem not familiar at all with the language this people understand .
