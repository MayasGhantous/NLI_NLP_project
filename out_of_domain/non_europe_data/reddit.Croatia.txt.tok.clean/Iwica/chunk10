  could we get / u/shakuswag 's expert opinion on the matter ?

   trying to slaughter everyone who owned businesses, 
  just because you keep saying something does n't make it true . 
  / d2g / is fucking dead though, 
  why not ? 
  that 's not institutional racism , though . 
  then why did you call it institutional racism if you knew what it was ? 
  and do you really believe other races do n't have an inherent disadvantage in the us ? 
  the one that always comes to mind for me is the [ arrest/incarceration rate for marijuana possession compared to marijuana usage by race . 
  ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/ ), 
  on average , they 're 3.5 more likely to get arrested , and in iowa it goes up to 8 times more likely to get arrested , even though the rate of use is almost the same . 
  there 's also the fact that even though 62 % of america is white , the 13 % of black people are [ rougly 2.5 times as likely to get shot by police . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database ), 
  or how about the fact that [ black men without a felony have only a 6 % better chance of passing a hiring process compared to white men with a felony . 
  when comparing black and white felons , black felons have a 125 % lower chance to find employment . 
  ] ( http://thecrimereport.s3.amazonaws.com/2/fb/e/2362/criminal_stigma_race_crime_and_unemployment.pdf ), 
  these are just a few examples that have a very , very big impact on society , much larger than , let 's say , affirmative action ( though i do n't completely agree with that programme ) . 
  but you ca n't just ignore the glaring facts that black men are unequally arrested when it comes to marijuana , which leads to later troubles in life . 
  is that not institutional racism ? 
  and yes , more white people die from police , but that 's because they make up 62 % of the population . 
  but when you look at the proportional statistics , out of 1502 killed by police between january 1st 2015 and july 11th 2016 , 732 were white and 381 were black , with the other 382 being of other races . 
  white people make up 48 % of those shot while being 62 % of the population , and black people make up 25 % of those shot while being only 13 % of the population . 
  even when you account for the fact that black people commit more crime , these numbers are completely unacceptable . 
  i do n't think you should be using anecdotal evidence when there 's a study literally doing it for you . 
  it 's described in the [ last paragraph of page 1 . 
  ] ( http://thecrimereport.s3.amazonaws.com/2/fb/e/2362/criminal_stigma_race_crime_and_unemployment.pdf ),

  [ this table on wikipedia shows you how much of them actually are in the middle eastern countries , with the vast majority being outside of europe . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/refugees_of_the_syrian_civil_war ), 
  while i do agree that saudi arabia is in part responsible for this , [ this report ] ( http://gulfmigration.eu/media/pubs/exno/glmm_en_2015_11.pdf ) says they 've taken in quite a lot . 
   press sources have published estimates of syrian nationals residing in the country ranging from, 
  500,000 to 700,000 and even one million . 
  however , such figures are not supported by any available, 
  official data , nor are the sources given by those who publish the data . 
   using the figure of 100,000 syrian students whom saudi authorities claim they enrolled in the, 
  country 's public schools , and under the reasonable assumption that their families accompanied syrian, 
  schoolchildren , an estimate can be drawn of the syrian nationals composing these families . 
  the syrian, 
  population census of 2010 provides a distribution of the population residing in syria at the time of the, 
  census , broken down by five-year age groups . 
  the categories aged 5 to 15 made up 24 per cent of the, 
  total population and 23.3 per cent of the urban population . 
  considering for the sake of comparison , that, 
  the 100,000 syrian schoolchildren are within the 5 to 15 years age bracket , the total number of syrian, 
  nationals in these families can be estimated at around 420,000 persons . 
   however , this remains a minimal, 
  estimate , as 1 ) some syrians may be enrolled in private education for which no data by citizenship is, 
  available and 2 ) some syrians in saudi arabia may be without school-age children . 
  on the other hand ,, 
  a share of these nationals from syria may be syrian spouses of saudi citizens . 
  always rated him, 
  but how does that justify the police assaulting people who were merely trying to clear burnt-out , unused vehicles out of the way for emergency services ? 
  as far as i can see from the article , the police were in no threat and this was an aggressive action . 
  you forgot about the petty bourgeoisie dummy,
