  that was physically painful, 
  i 'm guessing it 's regarding the lycan wolf thing, 
  [ it begins ] ( http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120402225423/random-ness/images/3/34/michael_jackson_popcorn.gif ), 
  game 3 had tc and wayto on support , qojqva mid storm , bulba offlane seer and carry demon on lycan, 
  c9 was pushing top t2 and demon almost got caught by clock hook but he blocked it with his wolf . 
  capitalist said it was skill , sneyking said it was luck, 
  fixed, 
  holy shit that sub is so ugly, 
  as soon as i saw that pic , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs7uyhpeoeg ) played in my head . 
  it 's not a [ joke ] ( http://www.feralnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/1390325053045.png ), 
  also [ gamagoori ] ( http://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/tg/image/1392/93/1392939902868.gif ) is [ kittan 's ] ( http://gallery.burrowowl.net/images/8e/8e1f4427490f055252a9125e1ac928d5 ) father, 
  i was n't ready for that kamina flash, 
  that 's a pretty shitty itembuild for a carry, 
  i love how it jumps from ganking a wd to just taking rax, 
  i do n't know whether to laugh or cry, 
  2/10 not enough eyebrow, 
  that would make so much sense, 
  why the fuck did i open this even though i can accewss the site, 
  juggernaut , pudge , ^ ^ ^ ^ earth ^ ^ ^ ^ spirit, 
  why not tide ? 
  my point still stands, 
  i 've seen the other side . 
  it can wait . 
  yes , the game continues into the next season . 
  it goes like that until you turn ~ 80 years in game and it automatically retires you . 
  ( might be wrong ), 
  a good one ? 
  who would n't be into [ this ? 
  rooney back in everton , oh god, 
  i thought it was lumi, 
  are you from the past or something, 
  considering they 've had only 1 official match since new eg has formed , i would n't be so sure of dk being better, 
  eg beat empire too , i do n't see how this is relevant, 
  woah , calm down there son, 
   relax , you 're doing fine . 
  i know , i just prefer quoting . 
  regular  looks weird . 
  i fucking hate that word, 
  currently managing peterborough in 2025 , been with them for 7 years now . 
  moved up from league 1 and now we 're in our 3rd year in the premiership doing surprisingly well with a 7th place finish last season thanks to a couple of amazing free transfers . 
  i fear we wo n't go as high this year as my 2 star players have been sold off due to their release clause ( which is something i completely forgot about ) . 
  at least we made one hell of a profit . 
  we 've won all our group matches in the euro cup so far , might make it as far as the second knockout round if we get a good draw . 
  all in all it 's been quite fun so far , only regret is losing those 2 star players . 
  too soon, 
  unfortunately , yeah . 
  i really hoped they 'd prove how much they improved , but oh well, 
  why does n't anyone carry a fucking tp, 
  reading comprehension, 
  these fucking ads make me cry every god damn time, 
  ironic shitcasting is still shitcasting, 
  i would n't call this passion , it just looks like anger and rage to me . 
  shoutout to dreamleague for fixing pieliedie 's keyboard, 
  i read it more as like `` yeah ... that 's right motherfucker . '', 
  apparently , lots of people care . 
  i could understand 01/02 , but 2012 ? 
  really ? 
  christ you people can not take a joke, 
  technology, 
  that cm, 
  `` you should n't blindly follow guides , you just need to build according to the situation you 're in '' said clockwerk , as he finished his skadi after getting a battlefury . 
  it was a 60 minute game , so i would n't say that . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://dotabuff.com/matches/427061150 ) the match if anyone 's interested . 
  based fucking andy stiles, 
   wall sit for 2 minutes, 
  what are you , satan ? 
   depending on the complacency of the cow , attempting to tip one would take between two and four people to actually succeed . 
  wow , someone actually did the research . 
  this is n't starladder, 
  this is n't starladder, 
  this is just the easiest way to get the attention of joindota/whoever, 
  i do n't really care if people think it 's shitposting , i want to see ee and rtz, 
  some people do it for a living, 
  use soul ring fukcing trashcan, 
  fuck em , they 're all dicks anyway, 
  what kind of legitimate business pays after 3 to 4 months, 
  then that lot is n't considered legitimate, 
  butt, 
  dumb, 
  trying to make history, 
  the totem looks like a hat that he 's really unhappy with, 
  there is no hope . 
  leave now , leave while you still have hope . 
  was there ever any doubt, 
  i 'm sure you obviously know what 's best, 
  kind of reminds me of [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn3xrnybtci ), 
  i imagined someone with a scottish accent saying that it 's confusing his alot . 
  damn , they 're just flowin today huh, 
  so what happened ? 
  did he steal the money or is he telling the truth ? 
  and how is moon still on the team if they ( seemingly ) dislike each other ? 
  smirnoff fucking sucks dude, 
  every damn year, 
  weedman 's like 3k mmr, 
  some dust or a gem is n't a lot of resources, 
  tranqs , lots of truesight and a blademail is , especially for a support dazzle, 
  if another teammate got it , then yeah i guess . 
  blademail on dazzle 's just a waste imo, 
  i do n't think you could make a more american commercial .
