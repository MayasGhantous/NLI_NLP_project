  i think i could do with one right now . 
  sure , [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=191926180 ), 
  typical winger, 
  dude what, 
  to think i went through the trouble to make [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mxstrup.jpg ) , all for nothing, 
  said the man named love and kappa, 
  tank for the wolves , bottle crow so you do n't have to go heal to base , i guess ? 
  god damn it dude, 
  you do n't have to drag , you can shift click an item and it gets added to quickbuy, 
  you 're getting old, 
  so am i, 
  holy fuck yes, 
  2nd forever, 
  except now, 
  i prefer valve, 
  i added la liga into my save last season , so [ this ] ( http://puu.sh/blp4q/5e5bd01c8e.jpg ) happened . 
  also [ this . 
  here 's the one that 's actually [ good ] ( http://puu.sh/blp6e/2b940f6554.jpg ), 
  i guess , they were n't bought or anything , they just appeared, 
  wow it 's almost as if different people have different tastes, 
  oh my gaawd, 
  i thought you were talking about an ova or something that i might not have seen and was super confused for a second, 
  your taste is shit, 
  your taste, 
  is shit, 
  puush works outside chrome, 
  but you might one day, 
  you seriously think you can say that after telling someone to fuck right off, 
  how fucking daft are you, 
  i do n't get it , he 's watching his stream inbetween games ? 
  there 's nothing here that proves that he 's actually sniping him . 
  that prophet build is all over the fucking place, 
  literally our guy, 
  no , but i think you 're a fucking asshat rofl, 
  it 's funny , not much to understand . 
  someone on / a / made a thread , people started making their own stuff , then it spread to other places . 
  oh we 're already back to hating naruto, 
  oh , well , my mistake then . 
  i never watched naruto so i did n't know, 
  it 's not about the rules , it 's about not being a fucking asshole, 
   it 's not about the rules , it 's about not being a fucking asshole, 
  what would happen if the player blocked the shot with his hands ? 
  [ it 's from the show . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siabiwpyccg ), 
  now this was a cringegasm, 
  fuck that word though, 
  i 'm not entirely sure this is legal, 
  why exactly is that ? 
  i think that 's more a problem with unequal salaries and certain individuals, 
  i guess you 've never seen zai stream, 
  whoop , there it is . 
  i dont understand how saying `` grow a thicker skin '' justifies someone being an asshole, 
  if anything we should be telling people to stop being fucking assholes , not blaming the victim for getting harrased, 
  oh boy , here we go, 
  he was standing in, 
  just you m8, 
  i think that depends on the board you 're visiting . 
  oh wow it 's like you 're the first person to post this comment !, 
  lmao hunky talkin shit, 
  `` go to sleep '', 
  the crime rate is the lowest it has ever been , only reason people think otherwise is due to wider and more aggressive media coverage, 
  just a [ test ] ( http://puu.sh/dqbal/4b9f691804.png ), 
  i actually enjoy the art that people put out and do n't mind it at all, 
  this post came from my boredom and this steam conversation, 
  i 'm on mobile and ca n't be fucked to do it properly, 
  you people are disgusting, 
  i 'm using opera mini and it 's a buggy piece of shit, 
  now we can jerk even harder, 
  top, 
  lmao goblak dropped the rapier in the woods and no one gave a shit, 
  i think he was talking about [ the box ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362478/ ),

  [ well then . 
  back of the knee maybe ? 
  yes , it 's from lagann-hen, 
  this is happening to me as well , friend keeps sending links but i never get any, 
  he saw the right click land and he kept chasing into fog , what are you talking about ? 
  hey kid wan na / ss /, 
  that 's what i was thinking , but why disable links to google and the like ? 
  does n't seem like a very good solution . 
  if we 're going to be technical , it should be joey-kouhai , since he 's supposedly younger than you, 
  huh , i did not know that, 
  thanks guy, 
  thanks , soe . 
  holy fuck neverhood, 
  haha racism is so funny xd, 
  `` heritage '' because the only hungarian in my family is my great great grandmother . 
  i disagree . 
  of course the person who uses an autohex has to click on a 1 charge wand lmao, 
  because `` not liking '' usually means hating,
