  learn some geography mate, 
  and some manners while you 're at it, 
  if hdz does n't win sdp does, 
  not good either way, 
  you 're out of your element tbh, 
  seriously how do you not pet a dog, 
  thats some shitty antivirus, 
  no its becky, 
  get on my level jelly son, 
  ** get on my level jelly son **, 
  and look at him now, 
  probably because they make up like 1 % of the playerbase, 
  yeah but the fact that `` men are miles better than the best women '' is irrelevant considering the proportion of the playerbase, 
  cna you even read dude, 
  i 've got him [ tagged ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unexpectedthuglife/comments/31x7r5/a_thug_on_the_opposite_side_of_the_law/cq6598t ) as the real one, 
  they call him cutty from the cut, 
   did n't use crest, 
   did n't use sigil, 
   did n't complete his ac, 
  1/10 do n't come here again, 
  here comes another chinese earthquake, 
  incontrol 's a fucking beast holy shit, 
  just, 
  yeah really . 
  surprised the casters did n't say anything about it,

  so brave !, 
  he has 5 wins over 3 losses with meepo on secret, 
  their average winrate is 66 % while their winrate with meepo is 62 % , so it 's not that big of a difference . 
  i think you need to go back to / r/theredpill my friend, 
  and this is bad why exactly ? 
  yes , but why is craving attention necessarily bad ? 
  literally everyone wants attention , it 's part of human nature, 
  but she did n't call out anyone . 
  this is probably the dumbest thing i 've heard all day, 
  it 's like sex in my mouth !, 
  [ hilarious and original ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1yzoiuiggs ), 
  do you have a single fact to back that up ? 
  number two : that 's terror . 
  you do n't pay muslims to protect and serve, 
  something something protect and serve, 
  people who are trusted with the lives of others should be held to a higher level than members of a religion, 
  mate how can you be so blinded by hate , it 's incredible, 
  do you honestly believe policemen should not be held to a higher standard ? 
  i think he 's one of them redpillers, 
  i hole-hardedly agree , but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment . 
  for all intensive purposes i think you are wrong . 
  in an age where false morals are a diamond dozen , true virtues are a blessing in the skies . 
  we often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-madonnas , but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite . 
  so i ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there . 
  although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder . 
  in your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids nsync , and even though you are having a feel day with this i am here to bring you back into reality . 
  i have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things . 
  it is almost spooky , because i can not turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric . 
  i have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness . 
  you just need to remember what comes around is all around , and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go . 
  make my words , when you get down to brass stacks it does n't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once . 
  it 's clear who makes the pants in this relationship , and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts . 
  you might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but i swear on my mother 's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it 's a peach of cake . 
  i whole-heartedly agree , but allow me to play devils advocate for a moment . 
  for all intents and purposes i think you are wrong . 
  in an age where false morals are a dime-a-dozen , true virtues are a blessing in disguise . 
  we often put our false morality on a pedastal like a bunch of prima donnas , but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granted . 
  so i ask of you to muster up all the strength you can because it is a dog eat dog world out there . 
  although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge chip on your shoulder . 
  in your argument you seem to throw in everything but the kitchen sink , and even though you are having a field day with this i am here to bring you back into reality . 
  i have a sixth sense when it comes to these types of things . 
  it is almost spooky , because i can not turn a blind eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric . 
  i have zero tolerance when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness . 
  you just need to remember what comes around goes around , and when supply and demand fails , you will be the first to go . 
  mark my words , when you get down to brass tacks , it does n't take rocket science to kill two birds with one stone . 
  it 's clear who wears the pants in this relationship , and sometimes you just have to swallow your pride and accept the facts . 
  you might have to come to this conclusion through trial and error but i swear on my mother 's maiden name that when you put the pedal to the metal you will pass with flying colours like it 's a piece of cake . 
  fuck \u2642 you, 
  wow dude ca n't take a joak ? 
  he hates it, 
  she 's been alliance 's manager for years now , stop talking out of your ass, 
  more like 2 years, 
  alliance won ti3 , but they 've pretty much been in the dumpster since then, 
   she gets attention because shes a random girl whos infatuated with the esports scene . 
  ah , i see the problem now . 
  just go back to kia or redpill or whatever shithole you crawled out of mate, 
   could n't be a player ? 
  becomes a caster . 
  cant be a caster ? 
  becomes a manager . 
  that 's not how it works at all, 
  name one person from the dota scene who would retweet something like [ this ] ( http://puu.sh/lchdl/638d07546c.png ), 
  i was thinking more like casters , analysts , etc. 
  there 's plenty of scumbag players in our scene , no one would deny that, 
  she and loda got mad because she was the one carrying around the sign , and lewis implying he 'd fucked her . 
  rlewis retweeted it . 
  [ it 's canon . 
  they already have one . 
  peanut butter on my balls let the dog lick it . 
  measure ur words, 
  [ wait just a minute here ] ( http://puu.sh/lmzrz/768d5e7c19.jpg ), 
  well , they ** did ** learn from the best . 
  what about the back,
