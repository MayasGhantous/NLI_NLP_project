   communism is marked by single party control of the state, 
  jesus fucking christ , are you serious ? 
  read a book about it , do n't spout shit your parents told you, 
   communism is a social , political , and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, 
   a communist society or communist system is the type of society and economic system postulated to emerge from technological advances in the productive forces in marxist thought , representing the ultimate goal of the political ideology of communism . 
  a communist society is characterized by common ownership of the means of production with free access to the articles of consumption and is classless and stateless , implying the end of the exploitation of labor . 
  i suggest you read up on something other than marxist-leninist shitholes , like revolutionary spain for example, 
  i 'd take muslims over you any day of the week, 
  so unchanged from vanilla ?

  / u/user _ history_bot @iwica, 
  8 years of elementary school , the first 4 years you have 1 teacher who teaches every class , the other 4 years you have a different teacher for every subject , and you have the same classmates for the whole 8 years . 
  after that you have 4 years of high school which is basically the same as the previous 4 years , just more in depth and more classes . 
  when they finish hs , most people go to a public university which takes 3 +2 years to complete , and are free as long as you pass their entry requirements ( which most people do ), 
  should have banned the users along with the subs, 
  better than nothin,
