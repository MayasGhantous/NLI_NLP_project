  you can be one of those , and not be a tremendous asswipe at the same time . 
   lebanon , a country of 4.4 million inhabitants , is hosting around 1.1 million syrian refugees ( including non -- registered ), 
   as of february 2016 , turkey hosts 2,688,686 registered refugees . 
   as of june 2015 , there were 628,427 registered syrian refugees in jordan . 
  iraq and egypt have another ~ 400 thousand as well . 
  why ? 
  honestly i 'd choose boban over rakiti\u0107 any day, 
  things that never happened, 
  if everyone had just `` kept the peace '' , we 'd still be under monarchs dude . 
  and i do n't really see why fucking around with a balloon is considered such a big deal . 
  all of those stemmed from france though . 
  and france went through some serious shit . 
  and you 're basing that on what exactly, 
  many pro players have stated that it 's not in their , or their ( ex ) team member 's interests to share reasons for kicking , and he only revealed it after being pressured so much . 
  `` i like raping girls who ca n't run away from me . '', 
  - you, 
  i 'm so sorry for invading your safe space , have i triggered you ? 
  [ something else is also expanding ] ( http://puu.sh/pmm6f/ac3bb152a6.png ), 
  psy, 
  i really do n't think they understand, 
  for me it 's 1 abandon a week, 
  sounding like a jackass falls well within the range of free speech though . 
  pff , does n't even compare to the [ croatian way ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nwipmmbr_q ), 
  you do n't have to be a fucking pillar of community to realize that publicly humiliating children is a bad thing . 
  camera 's on the sidelines , it 's zoomed in quite a bit . 
  [ this one 's better imo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/htsaprv.png ) , it uses the croatian crown instead of the hungarian . 
  it does , actually . 
  doxxing and the like gets you a permaban . 
  same reason they 're more represented in basketball , a disproportionate amount of black people are poor , and poor people play more sports because they see it as a possible way out of poverty . 
  it 's the same in europe/africa with soccer .

  he straight up ruined his games . 
  how are you supposed to activate it without getting terraformed though, 
  do they just use a really long stick or something, 
  will this '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' `` joke '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' ever die, 
   american, 
   culture, 
  lol, 
  he used it way too late though , it was already off cooldown by then, 
  [ i laughed so hard at this ] ( http://puu.sh/pq9u3/6ef3d316a5.png ), 
  fight fire with fire ? 
  make some pretty graphs so we know what you 're talking about, 
  seek help, 
   ramsay 's dogs is actually a faceless man . 
   ramsay 's dogs is actually jaqen h'ghar . 
  a mentally ill person , not a `` piece of scum '', 
  no one said he had free reign to threaten the lives of others , stop strawmanning, 
  mentally ill people need help , not hate and exclusion, 
  bipolar disorder is [ well documented in dsm 5 as a serious mental illness ] ( http://journalbipolardisorders.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2194-7511-1-12 ) so i really do n't know why you would think he was `` a total asshole sometimes '', 
  please look at the facts before making conclusions based on emotion . 
  it 's supposed to mean that maybe , just maybe , this man needed help and we should not be calling him `` scum '' and `` a total asshole '', 
  [ this looked better in my head ] ( http://puu.sh/pz1ks/a4000e3397.jpg ), 
  but if you 're leeching the pulls , then you 're not talon farming, 
  i never said he lost all understanding of right and wrong , i 'm just saying his condition more than likely impacted his decision to break in . 
  i 'm not against self defense , but i do have sympathy for the mentally ill person who died and i do n't think this should be regarded as a `` feel good '' story . 
  one of those is staying blue . 
  [ yup .

  men make up 50 % of the population but are responsible for 90.5 % of murders . 
  men make up 50 % of the population , but are responsible for 80 % of arrests for most crime . 
  men make up 50 % of the population , but are responsible for 88 % of violent crime and 95 % of new court commitments for violent offenses . 
  men make up 50 % of the population , but are nine times for likely to be incarcerated . 
  men make up 50 % of the population , but are responsible for 85 % of domestic violence cases . 
  it 's not that i hate men , but facts are facts . 
  men just did n't evolve to be capable of higher thinking like women did . 
  they evolved to be violent and hunt mammoths . 
  now that 's not their fault , but we have to say no to political correctness and admit once and for all men are unfit for modern society . 
  i 'm not sexist i 'm a gender realist .

   call her a boy,

  [ holy shit it 's real ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb3urjjaac4 ), 
  i dunno dude , florida man is crazy . 
  usually it involves a lot of stuttering , vague descriptions and general crippling anxiety, 
  also i do n't look good, 
  yeah see in order to get medication i 'd have to actually interact with people, 
  [ that did n't end well . 
  it does n't say it will last another 9 hours , it says it 's lasted 9 hours . 
  i 've checked online and my phone ( xperia t3 ) is supposed to have a 19 hour talk time , but it drops to 37 % within 10 hours of idling . 
  i bought it used , it 's from 2015 . 
  that 's probably it , guess i 'll have to get a new battery . 
  bili\u0107 does want him , though i doubt mand\u017eo would want to come .

  i got qo and fenrir out of 15 packs , that 's decent i guess, 
  so what you 're saying is you 're worse than a broken clock :\\ ^ ), 
  and what facts are you basing these claims off of ? 
  any sources ? 
  first season was amazing dude , the columbus arc was probably the best thing japan has ever produced . 
  ever since they switched production to that cloud studio shit has been going downhill , and it seems like this turkish director has no idea what he 's doing . 
  they beat all of them at least once last season though .
