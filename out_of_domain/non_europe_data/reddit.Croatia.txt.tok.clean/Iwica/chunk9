  do n't see why not again with better players, 
  of course they have , does n't mean west ham ca n't beat them though, 
  everyone thought chelsea would dominate and we saw how that turned out, 
  anything is possible this season tbh, 
  alright mate , whatever you say . 
  it 's amazing how many people do n't realize this , yet talk so much shit, 
  he wanted more play time but management would n't budge to an 18 year old ( which is good ) , so he left . 
  what else could they do but let him go ? 
  fair point , though it 's hard for the pr to pass up on a pun as clever as that one :\\ ^ ), 
  edit : / s, 
  i do n't remember how either team played back then , but i 'm sure saf had his reasons for not including him . 
  if he ca n't adapt to your team 's playstyle then yes ? 
  up to 108, 
  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, 
  personally i do n't see the problem in wanting 5 players with the same nationality/language, 
  of course , that guy went over the top, 
  well i wo n't pay full price . 
  so , i 'll give you a dime . 
  reboot fucking when ? 
  but can you actually provide some proof instead of just talking out of your ass ? 
  you said 9/10 . 
  sounds like you 're talking out of your ass about something you know nothing about, 
  i 'm not the one claiming 9/10 esports girlfriends are asians and assholes , so i really do n't see how that 's relevant, 
  i do n't give a shit what your opinion is , you said something and i am asking you to back it up with facts , which you have yet to do, 
  here 's some ex-yu stuff,

  any time i speak to a player before confirming their sale , if they say that fucking `` there 's no way i 'm coming back while you 're still here '' line , i cancel the fucking transfer and let them rot for the rest of their contract . 
  god damned assholes .

  did you mute voice or text ? 
  [ i told you about states bro ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cl5vchfukaaqg4j.jpg ), 
   the on-campus housing is meant to gather those interested in issues concerning the black community . 
  twenty-four students are living in the themed dorm space , and cal state l.a. said there is a wait list to get in . 
   `` this community is open to all students , '' said cal state l.a. spokesman robert lopez . 
  `` this living-learning community focuses on academic excellence and learning experiences that are inclusive and non-discriminatory . '', 
  because he 's casting the game ? 
  alright then . 
  this was a lot funnier in my head, 
   the vast majority have not even finished primary school and are illiterate, 
  you got any sources to back those claims up ?

   fun, 
   in dota, 
  where do you think we are mate, 
  i think it has less to do with bob himself and more to do with the fact that guidolin got axed . 
  all the owners want is someone who does what they 're told , i guess petev 's no different . 
  they swapped an na team for an na team , what is the problem here . 
  no pics though . 
  holy fuck .

  is this a joke ? 
  social democrats are extremely left now ? 
   the op 's english is atrocious, 
  that 's the joke . 
   the next time feminist activists fight a political battle which makes my life better as a man will be the first time . 
  off the top of my head , [ they successfuly pushed for male rape to be classified as rape ] ( http://feminist.org/nomoreexcuses/rapeisrape.asp ) , [ equalized the drinking age for men and women ] ( http://www.casebriefsummary.com/craig-v-boren/ ) , [ helped fight ( primarily male ) prison rape ] ( http://justdetention.org/what-we-do/prisoner-rape-culture/ ) and [ fights male gender stereotyping ] ( http://therepresentationproject.org/ ) . 
  there 's more examples but i 'm really lazy . 
   let 's start with making registration for selective service mandatory for women . 
  ever heard a feminist fight for that ? 
  feminists generally fight for the abolishment of ss in itself , since it 's a pretty shitty programme . 
   your first link was 99 % for the benefit of women . 
  the benefit to males was barely mentioned . 
  but it still got male rape recognized as actual rape , just because it focused on female rape as well does n't negate that . 
  i suppose the 2nd and 3rd link are bad , i was told jdi was started by feminists but i guess i 'm wrong . 
   it 's not going away , it 's not going to be replaced . 
  that 's a really bad attitude , we should fight any bad policy , no matter how `` set in stone '' it is .
