well , no . 
  but , according to alex st. john , head of direct x project , after working on win 3.1 gabe lost motivation and eventually retired from microsoft . 
  it seems win 3.1 and other projects at microsoft left gabe exhausted :, 
   gabe was a tremendously accomplished microsoft technology veteran . 
  he was responsible for shipping windows 3.1 long ago along with dozens of other major microsoft products . 
  when i met gabe he had taken one of those rest-and-vest jobs in the advanced technology group working on set top box ui . 
  even then gabe was very wealthy and very tired . 
  gabe was the one who originally lent me an engineer from his team to port doom to windows 3.1 . 
  years later when gabe finally left microsoft his `` intention '' was to retire rich and do whatever he wanted after years of hard service to microsoft ... . 
  what he wanted to do was make games for fun . 
  he funded valve entirely with his own money . 
  even `` retired '' and `` exhausted '' gabe newell 's `` hobby '' was to create a massively successful game franchise and online publishing service that came to dominate the pc game industry .

   he does it for free, 
   he takes his `` job '' very seriously, 
   he does it because it is the only amount of power & control he will ever have in his pathetic life, 
   he deletes threads he does n't like because whenever he gets upset he has an asthma attack, 
   he deletes threads he does n't like because they interfere with the large backlog of little girl chinese cartoons he still has to watch, 
   he will never have a real job,
