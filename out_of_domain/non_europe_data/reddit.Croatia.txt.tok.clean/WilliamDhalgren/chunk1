so basicly ban gay people from getting married ( not that they could ) and adopt children . 
  they said it was to protect children from all horrible gay people ,, 
  more precisely , to put that ban in the constitution , since already by family law here , gays/lesbians already are banned from marriage ( obviously ) . 
  i think this should sound familiar to us residents here at least , a number of states used referendums for stunts like this one , right ? 
  and re adoption , interestingly yes , that 's their rhetoric , though its quite clear that if they succeed , all they do is reserve the word marriage for opposite-sex families . 
  it does n't limit what rights same-sex families could have at all , beyond not being able to call it a marriage in a legal context . 
  and specifically , it certainly would not block any legislative reform to allow same-sex couples from adopting ( ofc now , they ca n't adopt anyhow ) . 
  like in uk until marriage equality now in process comes in force - civil unions w a right to adopt . 
   poligamne brakove ? 
   to je bilo po danasnjem gledanju tradicionalno drustvo . 
  ... prema tebi you mean . 
  najavljena su samo registrirana partnerstva , sto ovaj referendum nece sprijeciti . 
   koliki je vremenski limit za raspisivanje referenduma ? 
   food prices are kept in place by the govt . 
  idk how it works in the us ; but i think the eu rolled out most intervention funding . 
  instead of subsidizing the price of food , it pays a subsidy per hectare of land . 
  so whatever happened to prices , farmers are guaranteed income, 
    a minority of one ideology not wanting to eat gmo 's based on fears, 
  being overly cautious about health and environmental impacts of a new technology seems far more reasonable , lacking sufficient knowledge to satisfy such concerns , than ignoring repeatedly proven dangers of another . 
  when stakes are potentially as high as they are in case of climate change , or at least claimed to be of comparable magnitude in case of gmos , precautionary principle is a good default . 
  rest is a matter of being sufficiently malleable when receiving actual data or not . 
   they oppose the one viable carbon-free source of energy because of luddite fears held over from the 1970s . 
  one viable ? 
  i 'm not sure science supports such a blanket statement :, 
  `` as infrastructure and energy systems develop , in spite of the complexities , there are few , if any , fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied '', 
  `` un 's climate change science body says renewables supply , particularly solar power , can meet global demand '' http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world, 
  and , carbon-free ? 
  surely you mean less/among the least carbon intensive , http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn_383-carbon-footprint-electricity-generation.pdf, 
  now , they may have exaggerated fears from nuclear energy , and it may be advisable or even necessary to use it in our energy mix , but there has been fairly famous real-life demonstrations of catastrophic dangers of this type of power generations . 
  which again , given lack of data or statistical perspective , easily impresses people . 
  and again a precautionary stance is at first hand warranted . 
  especially when alternatives are apparently not considered unrealistic by the science , and this route does have honestly unsolved conundrums , like waste disposal . 
  managing nuclear , as well as regulating food are significant regulatory challenges with famous failures of the relevant regulatory bodies ( uk foot and mouth for 01 ' i think , starlink scandal and obviously the fukusima accident to take more recent examples ) , and one need n't disbelieve scientific data to take a cautious stance . 
  this is in severe contrast with creationism and science denial , where they simply outright dismiss entire domains of science as fabricated , based neither on caution or impressive statistical outliers supporting their conclusions , but pure unmodulated ideological prejudice . 
   and , in their day to day lives , they are not significantly more carbon-conscious than those on the right . 
  if half the country really did try to drive less ... 
  idk , i do n't think people have nearly as much effect on the routines of their day-to-day life individually , as they can collectively through the democratic process and government bodies enforcing decisions so arrived at . 
  thx for illustrating my point, 
  etc, 
   idiots have said this since the seventies . 
  in those forty years that we 've held out for non-nuclear , non-carbon energy we 've instead emitted a dose of carbon dioxide that modern climate science predicts will doom us all . 
  even if we can get sufficient non-nuclear renewables online in the next twenty years it is already too late . 
  we missed our opportunity to stop carbon emissions four decades ago and the blame lies with the `` environmentalists '' . 
  i agree completely , completely lost decades , and this was an obvious way out . 
  though it need n't be `` too late '' for managing climate change yet . 
  and i think those decades were also lost simply because of general inaction ; lack of political will to really focus on dealing with climate change to any extent and by any methods , not only by some overly tight straightjacket of allowed technologies . 
  this is my main problem with the anti-nuclear movement - focusing on the totally wrong `` enemy '' even if they dislike nuclear plants . 
  for rationally as environmentalists , they should dislike fossil fuels by every metric imaginable , in a far greater extent . 
   if you look at it in terms of kilowatt-hours per curie released , nuclear ( including all disasters so far ) is still cleaner than the ** practical alternatives ** we 've been using ** such as coal . 
  ** the scientific verdict would proclaim nuclear the victor even by that metric . 
  over coal ? 
  sure , basically anything is a victor over coal . 
  what i 'm disputing is that a grid based mainly on renewables is impractical technologically . 
  and i 've quoted some fairly authoritative sources to support this possibility . 
  that does n't mean nuclear might not be a better choice , or even necessary in some substantial percentage of power generation , or at least for a time . 
  really all i object here is the strength of your language , not your position - ( the one viable , he practical alternatives ... ), 
   those three demonstrations were relatively mild in terms of human cost , particularly compared to all the radioactive material emitted by coal plants in those four decades since the seventies . 
   nuclear power is going to be a century old soon . 
  a `` precautionary stance '' becomes a luddite stance after a certain period of time . 
  oh absolutely . 
  this is why i said ** given lack of data or statistical perspective , ** . 
  what i mean is , its easy to raise fears about a technology that had such dramatic failures , and since its a given most people are uninformed on relevant comparisons , their reaction under the circumstances is not unreasonable , albeit ultimately wrong . 
  in contrast , what is reasonable about creationism and climate denial ? 
  the thinking process there starts with a dogma , or in pure recklessness and conspiracy theory . 
   waste can be recycled and burned in a properly-designed fuel cycle . 
  and it 's not like non-nuclear renewables do n't have environmental externalities . 
  it could , but this raises other issues , eg using a fleet of fast breeders for burning the spent fuel , or managing additional proliferation risks . 
  i 'm not saying either are necessarily show-stoppers , just that they are n't currently deployed , and raise additional regulatory issues . 
  i really have n't seen even nuclear advocacy denying there is an open issue in what would one best do to deal with waste products . 
   since we 're back to bashing republicans , 76 % of democrats are religious . 
  please tell me how any religious affiliation is more rational than a particular set of nonsense you 're singling out : creationism . 
  really my only intention was to point out what i saw as differences between gmo , or nuclear opposition to creationism and climate denialism . 
  i do n't really want to summarize my argument in one sentence , since i gave it some paragraphs already above , but as a shorthand , let 's say i think these are on the opposite ends of the application of precautionary principle , and that some very visible statistical outliers they 're easily familiar with , support the wrong conclusion in case of anti-rational behavior of the left . 
  which is n't the case with the crazier and prominent elements of the right . 
  its not a very strong objection to your position , really , simply thought i found some interesting distinctions to be drawn between these issues after all , and you were denying there being any at all . 
   and what decisions have been arrived at , even when the american left has been in control of the reins of power . 
  has it ever implemented any change in this department ? 
  no , of course not . 
  exactly . 
  maybe i should point out i 'm european . 
  american supposed left is even more disappointing than `` third wave '' social democrats here , and those are a laugh . 
  but still , the former makes even more moderate conservative parties in europe seem leftist . 
   you attempt to deny the fact that ** most people ** , regardless of political affiliation , are religious , and attempt to construe this as a republican trait . 
  oh well most people , that really varies from country to country , some really are mostly secular , and afaik religiosity is generally heavily correlated with being conservative , as it is in the us, 
  '' very religious white americans are more than twice as likely to identify with or lean toward the republican party , while nonreligious whites are significantly more likely to identify with the democratic party . '', 
  vise je do sramote po drzavu . 
  o referendumu se donosi zakon . 
   aristotle , socrates etc. . . hung there . 
  so , if you can stand all the fetuses , and noone proselytized you , you 'd have a chance to hang with a best-of cast of human antiquity - and they removed it ??? 
  those fucking catholic pricks , that sounds like one of the best destinations in the multiverse !, 
  well it would seem impolite to see `` i just donated x '' posts , i think , like bragging , if that 's what you mean . 
  i 'd expect posts about helping the poor would be like here - links/pics of actions or organisations doing such work and asking for donations ? 
  i guess many different denizens live in r/atheism , but i 'd say its such a hypothetical subscriber that would be entirely in the wrong here , were he/she to react like that to such posts . 
  so no goalposts need to be moved ; simple manners will do instead :p, 
  i could see us doing this kind of nonsense , but that is a huge disappointment to learn . 
   so , she should spend an eternity of punishment for disobeying god , when she dies ? 
  if she is selfless enough not to care about what happens to her , but rather wishes well on her children and their future . . um , she should kill them as soon as they 're baptized , i guess . . 
  mislim da nema nista vise za izgubiti , a moze mobilizirati svoju stranu at least . 
  the threat itself might do it though, 
   how can i make this all stop ?
