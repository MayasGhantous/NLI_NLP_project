  but i 'm not sure . 
  edit : i think i 'm wrong judging by the replies, 
  funny how advances in science get such a passing note here ( reason 2 , subpoint 3 ) . 
  i 'd have thought this to be one of the dominant reasons ppl can feel religion is unjustified . 
   now where am i supposed to go to get laughs and feel like a part of something big ? 
  i gather new and old atheism related subs for this are in place, 
   it is that education should always come before legislation, 
  that is just a political opinion . 
  i think it 's legitimate for mods of a sub to have a final say in what the place is supposed to be , and that a sub , having a certain demographic satisfied with what it is unfiltered , is quite a different place , even if filtered , than a sub that actually imposes a ( weak ) restriction . 
  now which of those it would be appropriate for / r/atheism be , is an open question ofc . 
  but that this was n't the way to do it . 
  because even then , if they had predicted the reaction and consequences ( which i know they did n't ) , it should have been discussed more beforehand , , as a consultation non-obligatory process and that further , they could have been just upfront that the decision is already made , rather than create a false sense of community decisionmaking with the vote thread . 
  but this argument has been rehashed for days now , i 'm not really saying anything new . 
  just hope this place wo n't have too many meta posts , though this one seems thoughtful and constructive . 
  mother be merciful , what the f * that , a leaflet from an insane asylum ? 
  its frightening she took something like that , in terms of her psychological stability or is she generally fascist/far right ? 
  i do n't mean to insult , but goodness , given the content ... 
  i do n't believe you 've understood his point at all . 
  ( its about self-selection bias ) . 
  think he 's trying to say , most active sub users , being users that engaged or did n't disengage from the sub as it is , is already a self-selected group fairly satisfied with a sub , whatever the sub and whatever its state , not a proper unbiased poll ( though i wonder , of whom , all of reddit ? 
  self proclaimed atheists on reddit ? ), 
  not automatically . 
  but there 's a correlation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religiosity_and_intelligence, 
   his results , published in the scientific journal intelligence , demonstrated that atheists scored an average of 1.95 iq points higher than agnostics , 3.82 points higher than liberal persuasions , and 5.89 iq points higher than dogmatic persuasions . 
  i 'd ignore the cross-country comparisons the article points ( supporting the same conclusion ) due to the flynn effect etc. 
  so , not knowing anything else about a person , and finding out he or she is an atheist really should increase your priors that they 're also smart . 
  not a great deal of effect , but just to note there 's a tiny bit of truth in that prejudice . 
  if for eg average redditor 's ( edit or sub subscriber ) opinion is what they want to measure , guess they 'd need to construct an unbiased sample of those . 
  transparency of selecting it is an obv problem . 
  do they need to compensate by some demographic characteristics ? 
  idk how good polling is done , but doable , yet its just a lot of extra work , in comparison to a worthless poll . 
  i 'm really dissatisfied that thread was even started given all this . 
  or at least , that it was n't more clearly stated its in no way taken to be a vote on the matter , just a way to collect reasons and demographics or whatever about ppl of differing positions , that will be taken into account in deciding on how to tweak moderation policies further , say . 
  creating or not dissuading this impression when it was quite clearly widespread , and then ignoring it ( presuming they do ) , that 's even worse than deciding on a completely faulty methodology , simply procedurally . 
  saying `` that 's what well do and that 's that '' would also have been procedurally preferable , it is a top mod 's call in the end . 
   if there 's a self selection bias , would n't it be more users would leave if they did n't like the changes , and those who stayed would be happy to vote for their long awaited changes ? 
  honest question . 
  i would expect that to be true over time , yes . 
  since mods and just the level of outcry have given hope of a revert , not sure that 'd be felt so shortly . 
  if anything , outraged ppl , might have a greater emotional stake in the matter while its supposedly still `` happening '' . 
  i agree , but i think this post is substantially offtopic to r/atheism . 
  its also totally us-centric . 
   but does he have to also spread the condesceding , rude and militant atheist stereotype - the kind that believes that it 's okay to view religious people as inferior or stupid and make fun of them . 
  uh , well its his freedom of speech , no ? 
  its just a matter of what the rest of us like to read or not . 
  anyhow is he particularly rude or condescending ? 
  he ridicules the most extreme beliefs , and objects to the more moderate ones . 
  i though him fairly polite , while allowing for a jest . 
  now i have n't consumed much of what he 's put out , so you may well be right from my perspective too . 
  i do n't think he 's any less polite than i would be . 
  which includes ruthlessly and disrespectfully rejecting people 's cherished ** convictions ** ( rather than actually engaging in insults or adhominems ) that are unjustified in my opinion , which will by definition insult ppl , but is simply a matter of being honest and not self censoring more than a religious person would about his or her convictions . 
  i do n't see how a position that religion is positively dangerous and harmful to the society can exactly be put without it being seen as divisive and insulting by the religious . 
  which is his position , 9/11 inspired him to talk about atheism i gather from a documentary . 
  i do n't even see how a position that there is just nothing at all either truthful or valuable about ones worldview and even the methods one took to get to it and continue to justify it could be anything but insulting to religions used to having dominance about such worldview messages . 
  there are no two religions remotely as different in this respect than any of them is from atheism ( no superstitions , little or no value in their morality system , no possibily of say allowing for their redemption in an future life or an afterlife , no evidential value in the kinds of evidence strategies like texts and spiritual experiences all religious belief systems employ etc ), 
   but i do not dislike religious people ; i remember that if i were born under the right circumstances at the right time , i may not even be an atheist now now . 
  if there were less militants and a bit more kind educators , we 'd have a higher percentage of religious people putting their fingers in their ears . 
  the divide is terrible , we 're all people, 
  hm , well as i understand it , what happened when he and a few other authors started the `` new atheism '' , was that they considered , atheism has been low-key and polite , nonconfronting for all this time and yet so many believe to the point of causing 9/11 , let 's try speaking frankly for a change . 
  given the demographic changes since , it appears it worked , so i do n't understand how you get your priors . 
   the divide is terrible , we 're all people, 
  ha look , when i feel opressed , and as an atheist i do daily on at least minor things , i 'm not that interested in not being divisive . 
  i 'll just be loud about the fact . 
  not that i really am loud mind you , religion just is n't a topic i 'd discuss with someone who is n't a friend . 
  and i 'd have a hard time being friends with a particularly committed believer , simply for all the other ideological positions that heavly correlate , and most prominently , being gay in a conservative catholic country . 
  meh , both are far too famous for the extent of their actual contributions to science , in comparison to other less familiar names . 
  hipstery , but simply true . 
  edit , though thinking about it honestly , i do think you 're right , hawking ( no s ) had more influential original ideas . 
   and does not improve the image of atheists anywhere . 
  a ) and that 's supposed to be his goal , why exactly ? 
  if a bank robber is an atheist , and wants to write about it , he 's not improving the image , but i maybe his story is nevertheless interesting and popular . 
  b ) his goal is to improve the visibility not the image of atheists , and that seems to be working out brilliant . 
  and seems to be having the desired effect . 
  < edit  for more context , he drew parallels with the lgbt community . 
  that fight is hardly waged by trying to make that population less antagonistic towards the homophobic majority . 
  quite the contrary . 
  and this does n't help the stereotypes . 
  but any visible group will have them , and ppl who dislike the group will have negative stereotypes more in their mind . 
  so i do n't think `` improving image '' is ever a winning strategy . 
  yet this seems to be working < / edit , 
  and , you 've just ignored my entire post , thanks, 
   what is there to debate about ? 
  since you 've not engaged with any of my arguments , nothing really . 
  what 's the point of your submission even , then ? 
  not the greatest phrasing of the title . 
  thought ` he ' referred to the admin , the subject of the previous sentence . 
  and its inverse . 
  ha , idk i 've not really seen conversations , however nonconfrontational , that simply consist of parties stating their differing positions and then disengaging , utterly disinterested in what the other person said in reply . 
  but whatever you prefer ... 
  i 'm also not convinced causality is unproblematic as this implies . 
  it does n't play a role in the actual statements of physical rules , and as far as i understood , its not trivial to find a completely unproblematic meaning for the word in philosophy of science . 
  at least it presumes time , which is too much when making conclusions about the origins of spacetime, 
  someone targeting you in something you ** might ** care about , as far as he can know , is infuriating even if you do n't ** actually ** particularly care about those points . 
  is n't vote-rigging just against reddit rules ? 
  would n't it be simplest to ban by ip the 30-40 users in question ? 
  and , has n't this been going on since about sunday ? 
  not a particularly prompt response . 
  i do n't understand the point of this . 
  there 's too much meta here as it is imho . 
   was it worth losing your job over not pretending to pray ?
