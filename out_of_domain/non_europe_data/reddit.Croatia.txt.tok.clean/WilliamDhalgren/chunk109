  admittedly the gain in strength over just using one box is n't that large - not even 1 dan rank - but it does help ) and a convolutional neural network to suggest promising lines of plays to investigate , with a completely novel component , an evaluation network ( also convolutional ) , tasked to estimate whether a certain board position it 's exploring looks like a winning situation or not . 
  managing to create a working evaluation function for go was thought impossible for no heuristic similar to say material advantage in chess could work well in judging the security of territory and the likely potential territory in go . 
  the workaround was to use monte carlo simulations of entire games , hundereds of thousands of games played from a position to the end - clearly those ca n't be played on a high level as they need to play extremely fast - and looking at statistics of wins and losses to approximate the evaluation of the position . 
  alphago team found a way to complement this ( mixing 50 % -50 % with the statistics still done in the monte carlo way as described above ) with an actual evaluation function based on convolutional neural networks , the most innovative third component of their system . 
  or , so the story was back when they played vs fan hui . 
  we 've yet to learn what changed in the meantime, 
  * ) reducing the error rate on the imagenet test from ~ 22 % just before this method was first applied , to about 3 % in a span of ~ 5 years , which is almost the best possible result , given that there 's a little below 3 % errors in the labels on the data anyhow , and significantly better than the ~ 5 % error rate a human that tried to take that test got on it, 
   the fury i 've received over the usage of `` mahalo and aloha '' has been pretty nuts . 
  huh , that does seem strange ; how are those offensive to anyone at all ? 
  still i think in this particular case / u/mfdj2 should step down . 
  this `` you have 30min to apologize for an imagined insult '' is a serious abuse of mod powers and little can sit worse with any community than hypersensitive mods very eager to demonstrate their powers . 
  a mod should act professionally rather than vengefully even if slighted . 
  another thing :, 
   most vendors simply say `` sorry , i understand '' . 
  this user did not and basically said he will just use his mailing list instead of trying to comply with sitewide rules, 
  users are not obliged to grovel at the sight of a mod and give only servile agreement to your proclamations . 
  you are in the position of enforcing the sitewide rule so of course you 'll be subject to any dissatisfied reactions to the existence of such a rule , even if it is a sitewide one . 
  you should react professionally . 
  so this in no way excuses your vengeful behavior , even if you were called a name . 
   go flip off a cop , or call the lady working the counter at the dmv a bitch . 
  very true , i 'd just suggest that emulating the brutal and untouchable behavior of the police in one 's moderation practice is a poor idea . 
  its not simply a matter of shit occasionally and accidentaly happening , but a systemic problem in at least some societies . 
  so that 's actually exactly what should be avoided . 
  that counts ? 
  i mean , its against reddiquette to even post such comments at all ; they should just be an upvote . 
  wtf !? 
  christ , that was the creepiest exchange i 've ever read on reddit !, 
  `` i 've only banned one vendor so far ... since i woke up this morning ... tbh we 've been lenient . . trust me that activity will not be allowed in the future '', 
  wow so smug , such textbook power trip !, 
  this guy is really not up to being a mod in any capacity . 
  well , dependent on the continent you 're on . 
  its all spam to me really , and quite a putoff from this sub tbh . 
  well , it also creates a lot of uninformative posts taking up front page space , lowering the quality or diversity of discussions in this sub , and restricting potential interest of this sub to basically north america . 
  i would be rather happy if this sub completely banned self-promotions ; there 's certainly many more of those than a few years ago on the front page , and i am consequently significantly less engaged with the sub . 
  now , this has nothing to do with the moderation incident in this case ; that was quite shameful behavior by a mod . 
  ideally he 'll step down on his own , though i presume i ca n't count on such honorable behavior . 
  team has not done much wrong here , no . 
  but the judgement fault of the mod in question - if you can call `` you have 30 minutes to apologize '' that - is so egregious and in a way most communities are very sensitive to ( ie blatant abuse of power ) that it would be nice to see the person in question voluntarily step down , imho . 
  petitions do n't have a yes/no option afaik , just a list of signatures . 
  this is a straw poll , not a petition . 
  just saw that thread , its prob the creepiest exchange i saw on reddit yet . 
  such a person should n't be a mod . 
  your analogy is off though ; mods are n't anyone 's bosses ; rather , they 're there to provide a service to the users . 
  all the more reason to exercise restraint even when users actually are pissed off at you . 
  and yet another thing :, 
  your mail exchange even contains this gem :, 
   you are the first to not even acknowledge the content and appear to get a ** defiant attitude ** about it, 
  . . and this is after you were informed what mailchimp is , ie at the point of the exchange where you should be profusely apologizing yourself ( especially if , as you now claim , you have at that point already clicked a ban over an imagined slight ), 
  defiant attitude , really ? 
  do you imagine you 're schooling a toddler ? 
  or telling off your subordinate ? 
  their attitude , defiant or not , is none of your concern . 
  this is inticative of acting as a bully . 
  this behavior is unacceptable , and is another reason for you to step down . 
  have that dignity , sir !, 
  happened at least twice in that exchange . 
  even if it were pertinent to the situation whether he was actually called some names or not , the bully continues to write some crap about the guy showing a `` defiant attitude '' even after being made aware what `` mailchimp '' is . 
  he should be apologising , yet he 's bullying instead . 
  some mistakes are understandable , some should be the last one you make in a position of power . 
  there should be no tolerance for bullying by mods . 
  couple of reasons :, 
  1 ) a habit , and an occasional reference - this place helped me with info and advice to get rid of cigarettes a few years ago , and i 'll check it out when considering upgrades , if i 've been out of the loop for a while . 
  this was the case recently for me . 
  in this case , i 'm interested in mod and rda/tank reviews , and possibly anything about current trends in coiling and wicking . 
  2 ) advocacy , science and safety - i 'm pretty interested in improving safety of ecigs and research in this field . 
  recent stuff in this category was finding and posting on some aldehyde emission studies at various pg/vg mixes and at various wattages , and with various tanks , and some discussion on safety of glowing various metals . 
  of course , battery safety fails posted around here were interesting ( and shocking ) too . 
  did i somehow imply i 'm terribly important ? 
  you gave an argument on how giveaways increase user partitipation in the sub ; i gave both a personal example and two generic arguments on how it can work in the opposite direction too . 
  yes , half of my interest is in particular in user experiences , troubleshooting requests , and so common problems people have with a mod or a tank or an rda , once in a blue moon when i 'm considering taking new ones . 
  oh i 'm sure juice vedor promotions are of use to north americans on this sub , some amount of it is certainly understandable , if absolutely useless most non-us readers here . 
  point was just to add a caveat to your answer on why promotions -  you said free stuff , i mentioned the geographic limitation of that advantage . 
  well , i mean alexa gives 54 % of visits to reddit coming from the us , snoosecret gives 45 % , so its hardly a minority voice - but yes , i always welcome minority inclusive policies , esp on subs that do n't imply a geographically limited orientation . 
  but still i had no intention of petitioning to ban anything ; just stated that i 'd be happy if that were the sub 's policy . 
   not sure why you 're against the majority hosting theirs . 
  supposed majority . 
  and i 'm certainly not . 
  in fact i 'm keenly interested in what 's going on in the legal realm in the us , in notorious incidents with battery safety there etc. 
  and i 've already stated :, 
    oh i 'm sure juice vedor promotions are of use to north americans on this sub , some amount of it is certainly understandable , if absolutely useless most non-us readers here, 
  and i 'm not going to repeat myself one more time either . 
   almost sounds like a persecution complex . 
  persecution complex , really ? 
  so now you 've stooped to this level of discussion ? 
  you know , this discussion is starting to seriously piss me off . 
  i 've restated my rather limited counterpoint on the effects mass promotional self-posting has on a fair proportion of existing or potential ecr audience , and repeated each point a few times when you insisted on reading them significantly more maliciously than intended or stated, 
  yet now i get this in my face ? 
  this waste of time is over , have a good day , sir . 
  this is indeed going on for too long already . 
  no official response re disciplinary actions , not even an apology , though i do n't think it would be enough given the gravity of the offense , and still on the mod list . 
   we will take action to diffuse and relieve the situation to the best of our ability . 
  utterly disgusting ; too bad i did n't see this comment sooner ; would n't have taken almost a day to lose hope in a resolution . 
  this became a public matter and was consequently supposed to have been dealt transparently . 
  certainly not ** diffused and relieved ** , apparenly while keeping the creepiest power hungry mod i 've yet witnessed on the team !, 
  further - without the bully in question giving even any acknowledgement of any blame in any statement to the community !, 
  worse , instead covering oneself with the flimsiest public lies after the fact like a 9 to 90 day misclick or issuing a ban before finding out what the chimp meant ( though you can plainly see equally bullying messages in response to being told what it is ) . 
  what eye for an eye - give me a break . 
  abuse of power , bullying is as bad as a mod 's infraction ever gets ( hell , bullies should n't be tolerated generally ) !, 
  yet such a creep has your confidence ? 
  then such a mod team in total deserves no confidence at all .
