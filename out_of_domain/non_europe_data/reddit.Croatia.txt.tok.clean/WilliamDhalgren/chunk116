  he seems to presume a classical symbol processing machine to make the argument , just like say searle , even though nobody suggested that would be the way to do it -- and then switches to discussing such subsymbolic approaches like in actual computational neuroscience as if were the same thing . 
   what would it mean to make a computer simulation of the human stomach ? 
  a ** functional ** simulation of human digestion is a black box that would have digestible organic material for its inputs , and glucose and other nutrients plus waste for its outputs . 
  a fuctional simulation of a brain ( or its part ) is a black box that has patterns of neural firing as both . 
  computers are simply machines quite decent at implementing such signal transformations ; their actual similarity to how the brains are physically made is ofc no closer than the extent to which an industrial chemical process needed to extract nutrients from organic material is to human digestion . 
   but the purpose of the brain is not to fire neurons . 
  it 's for the coordination and control of action . 
  it 's for the coordination and control of action . 
  electrical impulses might be the currency of the brain , but they are not what is being purchased . 
  do you imagine someone expects it to be of any use as a virtual brain in a vat ? 
  also , lots of colorful language . 
  what `` makes sense '' , what is a `` purpose '' , what is `` purchased '' and what is the `` currency '' . 
  i was speaking simply about inputs and outputs of a system . 
  an artificial heart pumps blood . 
  that 's its currency in your terms ; and it buys energy , nutrients , pushes around immune cells etc for the body . 
  ones based on say a centrifugal or axial flow pump is quite different from an actual heart ; there 's no pulse at all , yet is a fairly decent approach to making a * functional * replacement . 
  precisely because it reproduces the crucial aspects of the i/o behavior of natural hearts ( near - ) well enough . 
  we can interface electrically with neurons functionally : cochlear implants , artificial retinas ; we can even give patients robotic limbs and they can get used to clumsily controlling them . 
  i 've just recently watched a lecture on the progress of spinal bypass ; reading of the motor cortex signals and stimulating either the spinal cord , or skeletal muscles directly , with or w/o exoskeletal assist as well , in monkeys . 
  so , the interfacing of signals the brain produces with biological * and * mechanical systems . 
  while by no means a done thing , still is clearly more developed than the step of `` merely '' firing the proper neurons -- or , the ridiculously nonlinear transformation of its inputs to outputs . 
  so hence the interest in that step . 
  computers are not just a particular machine or architecture , so that arguments of this form could carry much weight : `` if a model of a process is very different from the physical architecture of a computer , its not apriori plausible that the computer can instantiate the process '' . 
  this is the chinese room argument and what seems much of the thrust in this article . 
  rather , they are turing-complete , or computationally universal . 
  and all known laws of physics have consequences that are computable by a series of approximations on a digital computer . 
  ofc , whether these can be done with sufficient efficiency to be practical is a different matter , and depends on what level of detail is necessary to replicate the electrical behavior of neurons . 
  if arguments that quantum physics actually does play a key role ala penrose are true , prob not -- but these seem implausable to many due to implying extremely large scale quantum coherence in a messy biological system somehow survives , yet is normally so fragile . 
  more practical worry is about the chemical signaling , protein folding etc on the synapses not being something you can abstract away with just some electrical variable , but needing to model it physically . 
  most models in computational neuroscience ( say variants on the hodgkin -- huxley model ) do treat the system as essentially a relatively simple electrical circuit . 
  so is that a computer-based model ? 
  actually only in the sense that computers can simulate arbitrary electrical circuits ; giving the same outputs as that circuit would for an input , up to some arbitrary lvl of precision . 
  this is what makes these armchair talks on why symbolic processing systems are so different from brains infuriating . 
  that a hodgkin -- huxley-eque model is even running on a computer , as opposed to baking it into a custom analog silicon asic ( or whatever ) , that looks nothing like digital computers architecturally is just an incidental consequence of the power and ubiquity of computers around us , and says nothing deep about the model used , apart maybe of it being a relatively tractable electrical simulation on such hardware . 
  now an argument on why * these * models too are wrong , would def be an interesting discussion , but that 's sadly not what the author chose to do . 
  as to whether making such a simulation with appropriate actuators and sensors is `` you '' in any meaningful sense , i 'm not even sure there 's much science could do to resolve it . 
  the i/o of the system should match ... 
  well , is it really a change , or just a jargon update :, 
  now it says :, 
   `` the green party supports a wide range of health care services , including conventional medicine , as well as the teaching , funding and practice of ** complementary , integrative and licensed alternative health care ** approaches . '', 
  which can be taken to cover woo like chiro , acupuncture , homeopathy , naturopathy etc , just as much as the old phrasing ( yes , even the `` licensed '' part ), 
  is n't bodhi a strictly buddhist term ? 
  a perfectly predictable development . 
  what else did you think putting your picture on your profile would get you ? 
  can you plz source that to a quote by deepmind ? 
  cuz i saw a number of articles claiming so ( well , giving such numbers ) , but it seemed more like a misreading of the nature paper , and i was never able to find deepmind folks stating much more than `` roughly the same hardware '' on it ? 
  damn , that 's extremely impressive !, 
  this is quite an inspiration , and - agreed - seems overall quite plausible . 
  i think some security aspects were not fully explored here though ; like in the last scene , we have a figure cloaked by an ar display . 
  a hack , fine -- but actually , everything and everyone in this world was just allowed to cover parts of the users visual field with their own custom displays . 
  blt this is a clear security risk in itself ; if you can make a person see what you want him/her to see , you can prob make them do what yy , and an actual system would probably think about permissions and procedures of sharing what one 's displaying and who 's seeing it in a structured manner . 
  maybe something like how sharing of content works on social networks ; being able to categorize what one emits towards some custom groups/classes/circles of people/channels/organizations that are allowed to see it if they want to ; and also , being able to categorize what one accepts in one 's own display in a similar fashion ? 
  i 'm simply dubious about giving parts of my screen over to random strangers on the street , or really to anyone at all who cares to hijack it , and doubt * that * kaleidoscopic free-for-all is the way it 'd get organized in reality , as the technology starts to get both accepted and scrutinized . 
  no , not quite - theists make * arguments * for the existence of a god . 
  that does n't mean they * submit evidence * for this , at least not in the sense meant here - broadly , the kind of evidence you otherwise require to accept other factual premises . 
  say someone suggests a then-new theory - general theory of relativity . 
  they can solidly show that this necessarily entails certain observable evidence ; at the time , this was perihelion precession of mercury 's orbit , deflection of the light by the sun , and gravitational redshift ; other evidence now includes gravitational lensing , frame dragging , now gravity waves and a series of other ones . 
  more or less spectacular , this kind of pattern of making necessary predictions of measurable effects is however universal in the sciences . 
  in everyday life , you 'd take a similar approach to ufos , bigfoot or medical woo ; one approaches any claims about the world with skepticism and only accepts them when failing to shoot them down . 
  the bar is somewhat prohibitive for accepting additional premises - see below on why this is probabilistically justified . 
  there is no definitive measurable difference in the world that can be made by the presumption of a god existing or not . 
  nothing at all about the facts of the world depends on the premise . 
  in this sense , there is no evidence for a god existing . 
  whatever your theory of the world may be , adding any premise to it reduces the chances of it being true ; the theory is otherwise equally likely to be true , but additional premise may or may not be , and the total theory 's likelihood is the product of the two . 
  so the premise needs to have a predictive payoff that increases the chances of the model being true to compensate , else its addition merely worsened your model of the world . 
  this is a ( poor ) probabilistic phrasing of occam 's razor . 
  the god premise has no predictive payoff . 
  and everything we do know about the world still requires the same ( scientific ) model as before , with the same evidential basis . 
  hence it is to be rejected . 
  this is the same kind of reasoning ( by lack of evidence ) by which you do n't believe there 's a species of rock-eating creatures on the planet orbiting sirius a , etc. 
  i 'd be convinced something at least very much like what the christians imagine is god exists if a reasonably clear , replicable experiment on a phenomena we can independently tie to the universe as a whole and its creation indicated it . 
  since that 's about analogous to the evidence and relevance of evidence one would accept in the relevant sciences for any other phenomena . 
  say a new testament text spelled out in greek ( cuz why not :p i mean , i 'm giving an example of conclusive evidence , so simplifying ) on the cosmic microwave background . 
  a primordial gravity wave inprint on it would be seen as fairly conclusive evidence for inflation , essentially explaining the creation ( of all space and matter and radiation at least ; if admittedly not of the laws themselves ) ; i think it would be fair a religious inprint on it is indicative of a creator ; consider how much like a god would a phenomena that could do that have to be !, 
  reliability of evidence is a really , and i mean * really * hard problem . 
  best we 've managed yet , in terms of a procedure or set of practices that have given centuries of progressively deepening insights and near-consensus on them among those devoting themselves to the problems at hand are statistical methods , and institutional and conceptual practices we call by shorthand the scientific method . 
  and still , the reliabiity of evidence is a really hard problem . 
  see problems with publication bias , frequent non-reproducible results , even results that may or may not be reproducible persist for a while in literature ( see cold fusion or maybe now the emdrive ) . 
  as this is already hard enough , anything much below such rigor seems just hopeless as a method for finding at least a pragmatically usable model of truth ( let alone any capital t truth ) . 
  heh , i never got that mentality at all . 
  howevermuch is needed never to fear starvation/homelesless/netlesness in your life - yeah , that 's a tempting offer to me . 
  but billions ? 
  wtf would i even * do * with billions ? 
  invest so that i can have even more to invest in the future seems hopelessly circular ? 
  sounds like a marginal life-comfort upgrade over say a millionish , and possibly even one where i 'd worry if i 'd end up spoiling myself too much ... 
  yeah , i think sadly that was the reasoning ; they really could n't do vr w/o a buyer , being after all too small a startup . 
  now they can . 
  they just have to do it in a way that makes business sense to their buyer . 
  and facebook is not a gaming company . 
  nor do they care about open platforms . 
  ehh , just saddens me that they would n't care as much about that . 
  but they certainly are n't alone in not caring ; sony 's doing vr , apple has done great financially spitting on openness ... 
  eh , you can call them that way i guess ; but this is a semantic quibble then ; seemed rather clear that the meaning of evidence in the post that started this was rather more precise ; true facts necessary/implied by the premise yet unlikely otherwise , as in scientific evidence . 
  true predictions of measurable outcomes that inexorably follow from positing that a god exists , yet unconstrained or contrary otherwise . 
   you ca n't just appeal to parsimony because you 'd still have to give argument to use that criteria . 
  oh sure ; there 's quite a bit of philosophy going into this ( centuries really ) ; i was just doing some argumentation above ; a probabilistic casting of an argument for parsimony . 
  this one should be a verifiable mathematical truth . 
  but more importantly , it is actually already accepted by the religious person , to the extent they make use of the scientific conclusions on the world ( consciously or implicitly ) , as these ( such as parsimony , regardless of the justification ) are presumptions of these disciplines . 
   it 's not like you have a position and toss out random facts without further comment - you tie them together and say what them support your position . 
  no , no , not at all !,
