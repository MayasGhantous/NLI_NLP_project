   following icc * ( barras and bernardo 2008 ) ,, 
  we could also view the implicit language as the `` real '' semantics for, 
  fc , and consider the language of this paper as an adaptation of that, 
  semantics with annotations to make typing decidable . 
  furthermore ,, 
  the implicit language is interesting in its own right as it is closer to, 
  source haskell , which also makes implicit use of type equalities . 
  however , although the implicit language allows type equality, 
  assumptions to be used implicitly , it is not extensional type theory, 
  ( ett ) ( martin-l\u00f6f 1984 ) : it separates proofs from programs so that, 
  it can weaken the former ( ensuring consistency ) while enriching, 
  the latter ( with `` type-in-type '' ) . 
  as a result , the proof language of, 
  fc is not as expressive as ett ; besides the limitations on equalities, 
  between coercion abstractions in section 6 , fc lacks, 
  or extensional reasoning for type-level functions . 
  well not that i disagree at all , but html is a poor argument ; that 's a use-case that should be using utf8 regardless , since it 's not a piece of say devanagari , arabic , chinese , japanese , korean , or say cyrillic text , but a * mixed * latin/x document . 
  so that benefits from 1 byte encoding of the latin at least as much as it 's harmed by 3-byte encodings of the language-specific text . 
  the interesting case is what one would choose when putting non-latin text in a database , and how to have haskell 's text support that well . 
  i would hope that by using any fast/lightweight compression , one could remove so much of utf8 overhead for this usecase too that it would be practical w/o being computationally prohibitive , but i do n't really know . 
  of course its the way to go for a website , for the reasons you state - a mixed latin/x document should be in utf8 no doubt . 
  but , how about using it in say a database to store non-latin text ? 
  is it the clear winner there too in usage statistics despite the size penalty , or would many engineers choose some 2bit encoding instead for non-latin languages ? 
  or would they find using some fast compression practical to remove the overhead or such ? 
  you 're not gon na build something like that in orbit anytime soon -- especially a heavy steel ship and pusher plate needed for orion . 
  and i really despise the fact that this is what 's required to consider this technology publically palatable . 
  i really do n't get why people are so frantic about radiation risks in particular ; this is a transportation device ; transportation devices kill people , reliably , cars murder more than a million of them each goddamn year . 
  yet that is fine , nobody 's demanding a comprehensive car ban treaty because of it . 
  and we 've already thrown 500 sizable nukes on this planet ( launch would be effectively like throwing a biggish one extra ) , in atmosphere , for significantly more worrying reasons than space exploration ... 
  cumulative effect of all those explosions is some miniscule increase in the chance of someone getting cancer so that over the entire damn lifetimes , 11000 people would die , statistically ( and even most of those would 've been avoidable by giving iodine pills to ppl for i think a few weeks , as it was mostly thyroid ) . 
  yet people go crazy over that ... 
  technology kills people . 
  energy kills people , transport kills people , construction kills people . 
  radiation is literally the least of our actual murderers . 
  ffs ... 
   are n't venus and mars pretty `` earthlike '' too ? 
  ... and both are of huge scientific interest . 
  how much more that would be the case for one of those around a red dwarf , where we get to see how tidaly locked planets behave , how flaring and early hot phase effects them etc. 
  we could even get lucky and have something really funky in our backyard , a planetary composition not seen in sol , say superearths etc. 
  and i 'm pretty sure nobody even mentioned any real estate 's on sale in proxima . 
  there 's certainly lots of far cheaper and rather fine real estate on earth anyhow , so what would be the point ? 
  seriously ppl , if this turns out to be true , its an incredible bombshell of a discovery with fascinating implications , but most ppl go -- if its not the galactic jackpot of it also being a living/livable world , meh . 
  wtf, 
  the idea is to get a flyby precise enough that its within 1au of the target planet or so - and get decent-rez pictures . 
  kinda like what voyager did ... 
  dyson stated he 'd expect 0.1 - 1 person to die from the orion launch , and ofc you 'd want to do it in a remote location anyhow . 
  cancer treatment advances should push it further down :d, 
  i think 11000 people dying from a trivially preventable cause is truly insane , and especially when the killed are civilians and the cause is war. , my point there is merely that we did that without a second thought already with nuclear airbursts for far worse reasons , yet fret about the maybe 1 person from orion launch , dredged up from the statistical noise and over decades , thx to zero-no treshold response . 
  and yeah , that even 11000 dying even annually , let alone over decades , from a technological advance really is peanuts , compared to how routinely we kill millions in the same name . 
  its rational and likely saves lives in balance , compared to the counterfactual world where we avoid such ( ie practically all industrial ) technologies really . 
  orion is potentially the same , for it opens up space and its economic potential when we ca n't get up there effectively otherwise with available tech . 
  orbital just wo n't happen all that soon , and the capability to do it wo n't be developed either as long as access to leo is within orders of magnitude of what it is. , and nothing 's on the horizon to change that as substantially as necessary -- except orion to kickstart it that is . 
  i do n't really have anything else against it ; just that i and prob any hypothetical kids of mine will die before it happens that way ; i 'd have a shot at seeing it otherwise . . 
  anyhow for this mission if we 'd do it in this generation , we 'd prob use the breakthrough starshot approach of just flyby with a gram-scale device at 0.2 c in a large extent , as you say , because i nor anyone else will ever convince people that risks and benefits of tech involving radiation are of the same kind as with other tech , and should be evaluated comparably strictly . . sigh . . 
  well , no ; the plan is simply to see what it is , whatever that happens to be , substantially better than what we can hope to do with telescopes in the meantime - maybe some coarse surface/weather features . 
  future telescopes at best can hope for 1 pixel . 
  maybe a focal mission to 550 + au exactly and very precisely in the opposite direction of the star could get a few pixels . 
  so they should n't be ** too ** hard to beat with a smartphone-level device ( + some optics ) looking at the planet for a few minutes at that distance . 
  i think they can measure the magnetic field if any also ; we do n't know if tidaly locked planets can sustain a dynamo in the core , and if that would let its atmosphere be destroyed by the star for eg . 
  getting its spectrum too would be just great , we 'd know the composition of its atmosphere is any exists ; i do n't think the early concept of the mission can do it , but the project 's deep deep on the drawing board so ... 
  if the rumors are true , its a fascinating little place however it happened to have evolved . 
  :d heh , i do n't think anyone could tell you what its likely to be or not be like , but basically just because there 's so many different things it could potentially be , and only one of those is earth-like hospitable , yeah , do n't sell your house in search of new real-estate :d all we have if this is even true , is something thats * probably * rocky ( they could only figure out the mass and they just figure if its somewhat smallish , guess its rocks ) and * maaybe * of right temperature that * if * it had any water it * could * be liquid - and actually all of those conditionals could easily turn out to be false as we do n't know practically anything about red dwarfs , their habitable zones , actual sizes and extents of any habitable zones , or if they even ever are habitable etc. 
  and even with all those , if it just happens not to have life ( is that possible ? 
  ) , you 'd suffocate for it would n't have breathable oxygen anyhow :p maybe it 's too big , maybe too small ( though given that we were even able to see it , that seems unlikely ) , maybe it rotates too slowly , maybe its fried by x rays , maybe it lost its atmosphere , maybe its made of mostly iron or carbon ( what would that do to chemistry of everything ) , maybe the entire thing is mostly water , maybe its too hot , maybe too cold etc. 
  sure , life would be the sexy option , but plenty of those on the table are damn funky too , i think :d, 
  they actually are to have small thrusters embedded , so they can navigate to correct . 
  also i think its more just about how far miniaturisation of instruments has come since voyager , that they could prob do a fair bit of its capabilities ; i 've not yet read about swarm collaboration proposals in the mission -- though maybe the project is just too young and will get to it -- they mostly want to send a number of them for redundancy , since at such speeds , interstellar dust could kill them easily , and what is worse , we really do n't know much about the interstellar medium between us and proxima ( well , they consider alpha centauri as the target , but surely that would change if this is confirmed ; same thing though ), 
  i mostly mentioned voyager because it too was a flyby mission , and a high payoff one , so in that sense similar . 
  oh , yeah , absolutely , i completely agree that asteroid mining will eventually be a really big deal . 
  still the economics of taking any material from * another star system * are so extremely terrible if you want them to reach us in reasonable time , and the potential resources of our own ( including asteroid mining for sure ) so huge , that i ca n't see * that * proposition ending up being economical . 
  now learning about some interesting compounds there to synthesize at home , that seems possible . 
  but the unobtainium/spice melange scenario is pretty much unimaginable , as the basic elements are all available to us in abundance , and you 'd need something both incredibly vital to us , and that is cheaper to move at a sizable fraction of the speed of light , an inherently incredibly energy expensive task , than to create by an industrial process at home . 
  actually i was just jokingly referencing the fact that the top poster immediately jumped to whether he 'd want to live on this yet totally uncharacterized planet . 
  to get a bit more speculative , i really do n't like transporting hairless apes around , they 're so sensitive and in consequence expensive , and robots are making great strides ; that development needs to be pushed and accelerated for all off-world applications . 
  well i guess doing so around the solar system is n't too bad , but gigantinc rockets to get the impatient buggers across the interstellar abyss , i really would just not ever do . 
  once we become good enough with the relevant technologies and find good spots for them , synthesizing a few or thawing some embryos to establish a couple of colonies just for redundancy , that does seem sensible . 
  cheaper rare minerals should definitely not cause a recession , quite the contrary ; i do n't know what kind of economic models you presume to get to that conclusion . 
  primary resource extraction is a small part of the economy - extraction of rare minerals positively tiny - and most of the economy , both the manufactured goods and end consumers end up benefitting , boosting effective purchasihg power . 
  if its a high-volume commodity like recently with cheap oil , it can cause very low inflation and worries of deflation , but that 's definitely managable . 
  you can see the macroeconomic modelling of the effects of this cheap oil by say central banks ( i 've looked at the ecb quarterly reports in particular but there 's not that much diversity in mainstream modeling of this kind so it should be broadly representative ) -- it has been quite a positive effect for the developed economies and world economy in total , with the disruption being limited to those highly dependant on primary extraction like venezuela and russia . 
  plus you really are n't talking about a sudden economic shock here , and certainly not a high volume one , due to the economies of spaceflight ; it takes a lot of energy to get the resources extracted back to earth . 
  so initially the industrial capacities of the field are limited , costs for setting up high , and return of cargo intrinsically expensive -- it makes sense for only a limited volume of the highest valued stuff , and to amortize the sunken costs of getting there , as well as for simple economic sense , priced close to what they can get away with , so roughly around market prices . 
  as the industry develops , capacities get built , more frequent flight needs leverage economies of scale to continualy lower prices and a wider range of materials starts to slowly make sense . 
  and there is an increased focus on further technological development in access to space , now having a strong economic incentive to invest . 
  none of this happens overnight , nor is it likely to target anything but the truly rare minerals . 
  anything abundant on earth still has a clear energetic/economic advantage in being extracted on the ground . 
  which is most of the stuff we use now . 
  i guess i can largely agree with that , maybe i just take a less ambitious perspective . 
  so yeah , if you push the exponential curve indefinitely , nothing is big enough for us . 
  and sure , if some unexpected surprises surface about interstellar flight , anything is possible . 
  i just do n't bet on either being the case ; population growth seems to be naturally limited , minor or negative in developed countries , and set to stabilize globally . 
  and energy intensity in terms of kwh per $ of gdp has been falling , and materials , esp metals , even largely recycleable . 
  guess this is my biased perspective from living in europe :d but if it holds , then even as interstellar travel becomes practical wherever we really want it -- this i think rather plausible even if we do n't find loopholes in the laws of nature -- still profitable interstellar ** freight ** needs to not only be doable , but also more efficient than using the resources of the solar system to replicate the material in question . 
  unless as you say , we can really deplete the solar system by breeding and spending ever more of everything , that seems hard to believe ; even if whatever the process needed to replicate the substance is highly inefficient , it 's gon na have a hard time to be quite as inefficient than interstellar transportation . 
  but i 'm speculating about technologies of far future , ofc i could easily be wrong . 
  just my feel on how that shakes out . 
  first of all , congrats ; i was following the campaign 's progress thx to articles over at centauri dreams ; it was amazing to see it succeed so magnificantly !, 
  i 'm probably too late to the party but i 'm gon na try and ask anyhow :, 
  i was skimming this paper yesterday : http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0275 and its modelling seemed very pessimistic about the chances of holding on to an atmosphere in the habitable zone of small red dwarfs . 
  yet model from the pale blue dot seems to suggest keeping on to an atmosphere is much more plausible .
