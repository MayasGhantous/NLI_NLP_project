  it really depends on what you 're willing to put up with and for what kind of resolution . 
  my family is fairly fucked up , we argue easily and make peace with difficulty if at all , so my advice is simply what escalates the situation to the point of no possibility of repair . 
  i 'd be ok with that if i had someone :, 
   my aunt is calling , messaging , sending me letters in the mail , and trying to get me to see the error of my ways . 
  i am trying to ignore it but it is starting to make me feel annoyed , angry , and bitter . 
  ... about something that 's none of their business in the first place . 
  but that 's just me , and i 'm quite sensitive about anyone overstepping boundaries ( and i think such behavior is generally more common in us culture judging by the tourists ) . 
  i 'd consider , changing the phone number , not speaking in any way , if any communication is forced on you , yelling at them about this fact , threatening with the police , throwing curses and insults , as disgusting and humiliating as you can , and all the verbal abuse you can muster against them until it hurts them just as much as it does you , if you can . 
  it should work , but i do n't think you 'd come asking for advice if this was anywhere in the direction of your desires and intent ; i guess its a fairly obvious possible course of action . . 
  since its the same in croatia , i presume its a common approach to jail time accounting , 
   refusing to listen to music just because it comes from a christian ... 
  also robs you of so much of classical music . 
  bach 's st matthew passion , organ mass , and b-minor mass , handel 's oratorios ... 
  what bothers me there is , some of the best compositions in history were written for a church , fucking messiaen wrote a fucking opera on st francis , premiered in 1983 , and if you scroll through christian channel , you wo n't hear anything like that , no -- rarely will you find anything but the worst kitsch, 
  edit its b-minor in english ... 
  nope , thx for the correction . 
  its h in my language too ; i was just translating unthinkingly, 
   and the conservative parties of europe seem marxist to us . 
  cultural values are relative !, 
  i get your point , but , if you 'd allow a digression , marxist would mean , advocating the abolition of private property over means of production ( ie industry , companies ) , of profits , rents and interests . 
  using it to simply mean leftist is simply an abuse of terms . 
  difficult to find marxists in the european politics outside the fringe around the european left party . 
  and most even there arent . 
   most renewables are based on generation that is n't constant . 
  be it solar , wind , or tidal , there is still a need for some other source of power generation to cover the base-load . 
  the obvious choice for this is nuclear , particularly given its properties ( nuclear reactors do n't stop or start on a dime ) . 
  without nuclear taking up the baseload in any system that could succeed carbon-based generation the renewables have n't been viable . 
  if you do n't have big enough hydro , yes , that 's how i 'd like to see them used . 
  though a large ( hvdc ) grid across the continent so weather can balance itself out a bit more , a good mix so that one is likely high when another is low ( solar vs hydro , wind ) , and large scale grid storage ( i think some coal mines in germany are used or supposed to be used for compressed air storage ) can make the grid more tolerant of intermittent sources than it is now . 
  regardless , i think we 're in decent agreement re nuclear here . 
   they 're currently not deployed in the us because of political obstruction by our left-environmental lobby . 
  france and the us military both run fuel recycling programs well . 
  well , idk mere processing still leaves a lot of waste to deposit . 
  i was under the impression that were nuclear industry much larger , we 'd have to get into breeders . 
  liquid flouride thermal ones sound good . 
  fast neutron ones , well there are certainly safer designs than sodium cooled ones ( eg lead ) , i would n't particularly want to see such machines spread . 
   that poll seems to indicate that race is a more important factor when it comes to partisan allegiance than religion . 
  in that non-whites vote massively democratic irrespective of religion . 
  sure , and the causes there are unrelated to the discussion we 're having . 
   only slightly . 
  the vast majority of both liberals and conservatives in the us are religious . 
  excuse me , but :, 
    62 % of very religious whites identified as republicans or were independents who leaned republican , compared with 28 % who identified themselves as democrats . 
  by contrast , 33 % of nonreligious whites identified themselves as republican , compared with 51 % who identified as democrats . 
  that 's a pretty strong correlation , and so the report is titled `` religion and party id ** strongly linked ** among whites , not blacks '', 
   honestly , the politics of climate science are more than a bit dogmatic so i do n't feel this is a valid criticism . 
  uh , what ?? 
   no , i 'm denying that the issue is as clear-cut as the poster above would have us believe . 
  in the us , both sides are religious . 
  some believe in slightly more literal interpretations of the same thing but at the end of the day they both think a big sky fairy is in charge of the universe . 
  sure , i agree completely, 
  oh , ok , this is where this otherwise interesting discussion turns into nonsense . 
   yes , and calling the party that generally wants to change things in the us `` conservative '' is an abuse of terms . 
  conservative policy is preservation of traditional values , not preservation of status quo whatever it is . 
  conservative revolutionary is n't a contradiction in terms . 
   there is no single set of policies that are universally regarded as conservative , because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time . 
  and apparently republicans are generically termed conservative even in the us , not due to some cultural misunderstanding :, 
  ototh , marxism is a perfectly precise term . 
  indeed , dogmatically so , as much as any religions can be , to the extent of causing sectarian feuds etc. 
  anyhow , i do n't get the point of your contention , at best it can be , that americans just generally misrepresent political positions . 
  all i said was , marxism has a precise meaning , and conservative ( often those are even christian democratic in term and program ) parties in europe are way way outside its definition . 
   you 're looking at the statistic the wrong way . 
  apparently so do ppl who made the report . 
   firstly , you 're limiting yourself to whites . 
  no i 'm not . 
  since nonwhites overwhelmingly vote democrats , they just do n't have an affect to the correlation . 
  but let me limit myself to whites even more and demonstrate the correlation further with some data from europe ,, 
  see correlation , pg13 illustrates it nicely . 
  a perfectly clear linear plot , tilting one way for the left , another for the right . 
    religious denomination , in contrast , has a significant effect on party, 
  choice across all party families . 
  citizens who belong to a religious group are generally more likely to vote for a centre-right party , and less likely to vote for a left-wing party . 
  not surprisingly , this effect is particularly strong when it comes to preferences for christian democratic parties : citizens who belong to a religious community are more likely to vote for a christian democratic party compared to citizens who are unaffiliated . 
  interestingly , christian denomination is not positively correlated with vote choice for far right eurosceptic parties ; in fact orthodox voters are significantly less likely to vote for a far right party . 
  catholic or protestant voters are significantly less likely to vote for a left-wing eurosceptic party . 
  green parties also receive less support from voters who belong to a faith community . 
   secondly , you 're looking at religious people and examining how often they 're of a certain party when it would be more revealing to look at each party and see how often its members are religious . 
  oh really . 
  why exactly would it be `` more revealing '' ? 
  given that the country is still overwhelmingly religious , this diminishes any correlations in the data simply by construction . 
  it would be more interesting in a country with a very high proportion of atheists like sweden or france . 
  but my googling skills were n't enough to ferret that out . 
   this poll indicates that 76 % of democrats and 89 % of republicans are religious . 
  to me , that shows that people of both parties are likely to be, 
  it also means that `` religiously unaffiliated '' are more than twice as likely to be democrats ( 11 % vs 24 % ) . 
  yet you want to pretend there is no correlation between religiosity and party affiliation , when even the numbers you give show a huge effect . 
  and this poll is of less value than ones that measured intensity of belief as well . 
   climate science , at least in terms of what it tried to predict , is based on a set of models that are ** unverifiable ** and essentially held in place by political pressure, 
  nonsense , then it would n't even be science , by definition . 
  if you believe it is n't based on measurable empirical data to a fair degree of certainty , you simply have fallen victim to same kind of nonscientific nonsense you 've just spend a lot of time denouncing also in the left re nuclear . 
  fact its based modelling is hardly exceptional to this science , but rather typical - check out how particle physics research is conducted, 
  ( hint , by comparing statistical models of expected debris with data ; existence of a new particle like the higgs only inferred by seeing a statistical anomaly in the number of measurements of completely different , longer lived particles ), 
  and thats why i have no intention to further responding in this thread . 
   not a gay male but i think that racial preference is fine but throwing it out there is crass and rude . 
  agreed . 
  but its a matter of manners then , not necessarily of racism . 
  hm , but reading that article , does n't seem to me it is ok w a racial preference in any way . 
  now , i 've only ever seen a few nonwhite people outside tv and porn ( and have no consistent preference , just phases ) , but yeah to the extent i can find any physical attribute or set of attributes more appealing than some other , i 'd imagine it should be perfectly valid to like a certain tan ? 
  seems to me equivalent to say preferring blonds or something like that . 
  possibly shallow , but hey . .
