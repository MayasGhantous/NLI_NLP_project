  as far as i understand it , nicotine is probably carcinogenic ( animal models , cell cultures would so indicate , though there is no epidemiological testing of this - so idk how severe this effect is ) , but still most of tobacco smoking harm comes from the say 4000 other chemicals ; benzenes , formaldehyde , cyanides , nitrosamines etc , as well as carbon monoxide , developing in the combustion process . 
  now , vaporizer only changes the aggregate state of the compound , rather than producing all the organic shit during a chemical reaction of combustion , so should make a huge difference in the harm caused . 
  and indeed , concentrations of above-mentioned toxins are some orders of magnitude lesser in the vapor as opposed to smoke ( say 10 to 1000 times less ), 
  i do n't understand what 's this tale about conservation of matter ? 
  conservation of energy is fundamental , and it relates to mass by the famous e = mc ^ 2 . 
  and matter ( ! = mass ) simply is n't conserved , but in approximation in low energy reactions , like in chemistry . 
  `` creating matter '' out of energy is pretty much what any particle accelerator does constantly ( and depending on what you take matter here to be - i 'm presuming particles with a rest mass ) . 
  a proton accelerator like lhc collides 2 protons , so rest-mass is just below 2gev for the two of them . 
  yet it produces all kinds of heavy exotic particles , including say the higgs , with a rest mass of some 125gev . 
  and one of the strongest pathways ( indeed possibly anomalously strong ) where higgs was detected was where in an intermediate stage , you had two photons , rest mass 0 , colliding to make it . 
  and the obvious opposite example is when you have matter and antimatter annihilating . 
  so the entire `` thing '' ( rest mass , or matter particles ) comes from their kinetic energy , or rather a better way of putting it is that mass and energy are just equivalent . 
  conservation of matter holds in chemistry approximately simply because chemical reactions release , or spend so little energy in comparison to the energy that say annihilation would produce . 
  ( and y if you squint this is also their mass by equivalence , but that seems an awkward way of looking at it , and matter ! = mass so . . ), 
  further , on a cosmic scale , its not quite true that energy is conserved either . 
  in an expanding universe it simply can not be conserved . 
  conservation of energy is the conserved quantity that , by noether 's theorem , comes from a symmetry of nature not ( directly ) applicable to dynamic spacetime - namely time invariance . 
  in an expanding universe , the energy contained in massive particles is constant , but the energy contained in radiation , like primordial photons in the cosmic microwave background drops , because they are redshifted by the expanding space between the crests of the waves ( and the number of them stays the same ) . 
  so with a big bang cosmology , universe loses energy with time . 
  that does n't seem to bother people as much , oddly , but is a violation of conservation of energy just as much as creating it would be . 
  with the cosmological constant and consequently accelerating expansion , the energy of the universe grows with time , for each unit of space has a non-zero energy ( dark energy ) associated with it , and there 's more and more of it . 
  and it is quite similar to this now observed phenomena , that inflationary cosmology postulated how the energy in the universe originated - just start from a tiny patch of `` empty '' space expanding rapidly , driven by some postulated field one could call an inflaton field , and you get a universe-worth of energy in that field . 
  be that as it may , understanding why energy is conserved certainly tells you why it need n't be apparently conserved in the evolution of the universe . 
  rest is just our closet aristotelian biases , ie now baseless belief that `` ex nihilo nihil fit '' ( nothing comes from nothing ) . 
  hardly the first place antique intuitions lead us astray when discovering more fundamental dynamics of nature . 
  oh , and since some pull out the claim that evolution in unfalsifiable , hence unscientific , a simple counterpoint would be - a precambrian rabbit . 
  if anyone ever found say a precambrian rabbit , evolution is clearly false . 
  . . and a bunch of others , thx for making me recheck ( hope i did n't miss more of them again ), 
  uhh , i mean nice and all , but you might then understand that your individual case can not possibly confirm much about graduation ** rates ** , right ? 
  whether the percentages were alike or different , there 'd be plenty of such examples of either . 
  heh , and i 'm apparently humorless , sry my bad ; have n't seen such type of jokes :d, 
   to an atheist the world soul means a person 's humanity not some magic floaty things that lives on forever . 
  hmmm , well that seems peculiar - i think soul necessarily implies something supernatural , albeit it could be used metaphorically ( as `` god '' got used to mean the lawfulness of nature to einstein etc ) . 
  seems to me that 's the vibe of the relevant wiki article too - with the only mention of nonsupernatural use of the term , metaphorical :, 
   when modern scientists speak of the soul outside of this cultural context , they generally treat soul as a poetic synonym for mind . 
  anyhow to me the answer seems dead-simple ; nope i 'm not the least bit `` spiritual '' , however one might wish to stretch the meaning :-d awe or connection with the universe ? 
  nature is immensely fascinating , i spend a bunch of time following the sciences for that reason , but this does n't overflow me with some extra warm fuzzy emotions , simply with intense curiosity . 
  unless you plan to specialize in the field , actually no its neither your duty nor even reasonably doable for you to understand where the preponderance of evidence on some controversial matter lies . 
  and this too is a trap creationists easily fall into , ending up making what amounts to arguments from personal incredulity . 
  there is simply no reason for us to particularly care which way such factual claim goes . 
  and to the extent we do care , we should recognize this as a liability , as a bias . 
  ofc my bias would be to favor deflationary arguments about this ( ie , with the religion i feel most oppressed by , christianity , ending up with the least amount of any kind of factual support ) . 
  but i just do n't have the necessary skillset to offer an informed opinion . 
  and i would n't have it even after hearing say a week 's worth of arguments and counterarguments on the matter . 
  which is already more than i 'm willing to invest ; it would realistically take years . 
  now naturally . 
  history can hardly come to the level of security in our knowledge we have in many natural sciences . 
  but its still the best game in town . 
  and as far as i can see , some in the field do advocate arguments that there need n't have been any jesus , or that basically nothing or barely anything can be reconstructed from him . 
  most i think will however accept that some kind of guy , with certain specific attitudes and claims did exist , and the mythos accreted around him . 
  by romans though ? 
  have n't heard that one , i 've got various alarms on my bullshit meter coming up from the premise itself . 
  but still the point is , it 's really up to the field to sort such stuff out , and so it is in scientific journals , rather than with posts or articles to the general public , where such argument should be made ( or should have been made ), 
   but science is the only thing we are supposed to believe in, 
  just that one should n't commit to the truth or falsity of claims unless one has good reason to consider these true of false , respectively . 
  in other words , to limit one 's definite claims to what he/she can justify claiming , which is just minimally reasonable . 
   science can not explain everything, 
  just that it does n't . 
  which is obvious anyhow ; there 's a bunch of things we do n't know , otherwise there would be no need for further research . 
  though its perfectly fair to say science also can not explain everything , simply because any scientific theory will , while generating predictions about a bunch of phenomena , depend on presumptions , ie . 
  postulates and axioms , that are merely asserted , so not explained within a theory . 
  which simply means that the business of explaining things is neither always desirable , nor even the primary point of science , but rather stops at the point where it does n't further contribute to either simplifying a theory or extending its predictive reach . 
  also :, 
   so are you saying, 
  false dillema :, 
   do not have any inner life ? 
  or are you saying science can not explain everything and we require non-scientific systems ? 
  in the context here `` require non-scientific systems '' meaning , believing things that are n't proven - and how would it possibly be epistemically productive to claim to know things without justification ? 
  moreover , following this false dillema , then life does n't exist because we do n't know how it originated exactly , and universe never came to be because we do n't know quantum gravity , or its inflationary mechanism ( and are n't even sure on that point ) . 
   i said `` science can not explain everything '', 
  i understood you perfectly : you said `` are you saying that ... '' and i claim that the poster to which you replied rather just said that it has n't explained everything , by saying `` psychology is still not a science !, 
  , see your own sentence , and his :, 
     psychology is still not a science !, 
    are you saying science can not explain everything ... 
   just that it does n't . 
  which is obvious anyhow ; ... 
  and also since i do cover and agree that it ca n't , but in a specific sense , see below :, 
    though its perfectly fair to say science also *** can not **** explain everything ,, 
   for example , history , ... 
  nobody mentioned history , it was not even mentioned in the comment to which you replied . 
  yet you were saying `` are you saying that ... '' , so you must have been talking about something previously mentioned . 
  so that ca n't be history, 
   see above . 
   we can study what lead up to wwii but we can never prove scientifically that the events we think led up to wwii actually caused wwii . 
  we can make some useful arguments and such , but we cant prove it . 
  well couple of points ,, 
  a ) strictly speaking , causation is a philosophically problematic notion about pretty much anything . 
  this is an old humean argument ; experience only ever shows correlation , never causation . 
  nor is it clear exactly what the term means . 
  there are various attempts at approaching the concept of causation in philosophy of science and never is it perfectly satisfiable . 
  in fact , the notion is n't fundamental to how say physics is even formulated ; the theory is just a set of laws of co-variation of parameters . 
  but anyhow , causation can be part of a mechanism of some theory , if it does do anything , and is subject to proof just like any other part of the theory - by the experimental or observational confirmation of the theory as a whole . 
  b ) you distinguish making `` useful arguments '' and `` proving '' something . 
  yet a proof just is a kind of argument . 
  outside mathematics , that is , where it establishes a logical necessity , though even there one does n't in practice encounter many formally verified arguments , to consider the certainty more than an argument from the fact that nobody reading the proof found any mistakes in it . 
  let alone the complete formal proof of the validity of the compiler , and system running the compiler from its hardware design through the kernel , but i digress . 
  proof in the context of scientific proof and even in most rigorous fields like particle physics is simply - low probability of it not being the case . 
  5sigma , for example , and successful replication . 
  c ) in this sense , history is different : there is no possibility of experimentation . 
  admittedly astronomy is observational too .
