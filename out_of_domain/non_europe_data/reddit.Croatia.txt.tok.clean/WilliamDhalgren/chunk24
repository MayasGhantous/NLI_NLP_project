  which wo n't be helped by speeches in parliaments , judging by how any other scientific theory convinced its field ... 
  edit : oh and i liked this argument :, 
  `` if there ever was a time that nothing existed , then nothing would exist now . '', 
  a ) for surely there 's no point in time where nothing existed , time being a feature of general relativity , collapsing in on itself just when space does , as we 've known since the 30s ,, 
  b ) for the claim seems correct if by nothing he means proper philosophical nothing , not even natural laws operating at all, 
  c ) for the claim is definitely false if by nothing he just means no matter yet existing within them , since a dynamic space-time as a whole can and continuously does break preservation of energy ( at least in the relevant sense ), 
  hm , unexpectedly i ended up agreeing with you , if i interpret you right . 
  first i though you meant charity and good will to one 's peers was the prime aspect of various religions , which is n't really true ; in their full generality , there are aspects common to religions , but these are n't among them , and neither are these as central in large abrahamic apocalyptic cults as a benevolent observer might wish and based on cherry-picking from societal roles they fulfill in their histories long after being founded . 
  but this much is i think generally true - large old religious structures survive and mostly consist of people who are genuine in whatever they 're doing or promoting , or at least as much people are genuine in anything they do . 
  so in this sense , wishing people are saved from eternal torture is certainly compassionate . 
  and while certainly many players in such large religions are obviously shady , for others i can just as well see honest people good at mental gymnastics and compartmentalizing and other ways of limiting cognitive dissonance . 
  knowingly taking advantage of people does n't seem the essential aspect of the entire organization in its history and throughout its size ( just a vicious circle of sustaining and propagating a fucked up belief system they never shook off after being afflicted with it before being able to think ) . 
  and this does n't always seem to be the case when people who created the thing or some early inner circle of them , are still around . 
   at the heart of christianity ( christianity meaning to be christ like ) is actually some pretty awesome philosophies in the nt, 
  uhhh , really at the very very heart of christianity is a millenarian expectation of some occupied folk . 
  exactly what comes with it depends on what book of the nt you 're reading , each being composed by different groups with different and sometimes conflicting agendas and beliefs . 
  including now fairly repugnant attitudes . 
  as a character , he admittedly is n't malicious , but in fact giving , honest and gracious - though this trope is so common with religious figures as well as sages , so not remarkable . 
  still , a plus . 
   s actually doing a pretty decent job, 
  that 's good news - i have n't yet heard him having actually ** done ** anything yet , or even saying anything different from what the church has always officially stated - so what was the major breakthrough , and when ? 
  so maybe now the catholic church will end its campaign for a constitutional limit on marriage as opposite sex only , do you think ? 
  or release us from the concordat treaty by which it gets around half a percent of the state budget along with various extra-monetary special treatment ? 
   well , there are two ways to try to counter this . 
  how about fighting for some actual antidiscrimination laws ? 
  its a broader and more powerfull matter , to make discrimination based on race , ethnicity , gender , religious affiliation , sexual orientation , gender identity and gender expression illegal both on the commercial market , as well as any state funded anything ? 
  our country got it few years ago ( and cisgender version only i think , though i think strasbourg court interprets gender discrimination in a trans-friendly manner , not exactly sure ) , it being a condition for joining the eu . 
  so it should be doable to one of the oldest democracies in the world ... 
  that 's probably already illegal , like white schools that kick out anyone who is n't white ? 
  this is just a matter of sexual orientation not being covered by similar laws . 
  but religion or worldview probably is . 
  i think its ok for private schools to exist , provided they 're subject to nondescrimination in employment and enrollment , and subject to following the exact same curriculum as public shools . 
  they can experiment with pedagogic methodologies only , even if comptetely private , otherwise their diploma and grades have no validity for any futher educational institutions , or in determining the education level of you in the labor market . 
  if they get any taxpayer 's money , then they can not charge anything to the kids further ( else they 're skimming the `` cream '' from the public programmes ) , nor choose in who they enroll any more than public schools can . 
  if they 're just tax-exempt , they need to show so with their books like any other nonreligious charity would need to . 
  only given all this do i think a private school is ok . 
  we also can make hlist-like extensible records work with the new system very easily . 
  really ?? 
  did n't he recently say the opposite ? 
   the short answer is that it should n't . 
  vinyl ( which i was n't aware of, 
  before now , thanks for the pointer ! ), 
  basically replaces the haskell, 
  records system wholesale , making records entirely separate from data, 
  declarations , and turning fields into first-class objects . 
  this should, 
  peaceably coexist with - xoverloadedrecordfields but i do n't see a way to, 
  integrate the two . 
  practically no private schools , religious or otherwise even existed when i went to school , the government having a monopoly on it in this now postcommunist country - now there 's more . 
  and that 's exactly why i 'm cautious on how they should function - when seeing such horror stories such as this on the few that do abuse their status . 
  i do n't imagine they 're genarally a problem . 
  but ensuring against their abuse by law , drawing on the swedish model ( which too has been criticized , and is exactly as cautious as i 've described the one above ) , seems the minimal sensible safety valve to me . 
  note that none of this should really bother a religion-owned school that is honestly run as an educational charity , rather than a propaganda/indoctrination camp , which is what their tax form says they 're doing . 
  so let 's just hold them to it , its just a matter of honesty and taxes . 
  for the system swamped with religious schools and other private educational entities seems to produce a population swarming with people miseducated on key scientific facts where they conflict with the teachings of the majority religions . 
  and i do n't see how , without it , schools could be made to teach a science-based sexual education , introduction of which to public shools ( by far the dominant educational system here still ) , against the wishes of many parents now being a hot political issue . 
  which i fully support . 
  edit :, 
   have you ever been to a class on religion, 
  oh yes i did , the concordat with vatican introduced eclessiastically controlled religious education in the public system . 
  truly a disgusting practice , secular parents , or parents with small religions try to fight it here . 
  often ends up with children enrolled in bible classes even though they nor their parents believe it , for either fear of sicking out , or simply because they put it in the middle of the schoolday , so nobody is there to take care of the children during it . 
  the daughter of some close friends of mine is in such a situation now in primary school ... and i had to go to church to get a passing grade , having religions parents that enrolled me into it !, 
   a non-interest bearing deposit of 0.2 % of gdp may be requested from a ** euro-area country ** which is placed in edp on the basis of its deficit or its debt . 
  failure of a ** euro-area country ** to comply with recommendations for corrective action will result in a fine . 
   mip relies on a graduated approach that reflects the gravity of imbalances and can eventually lead to the imposition of sanctions on ** euro area member states ** should they repeatedly fail to meet their obligations under the corrective arm of the mip .

  probably exploded though ? 
  thousands of years are n't much for stars generally , though admittedly the really big ones are very short lived - but on the scale of millions of years still ( and article mentiones that ) . 
  d/k how long a particular evolutionary stage of largest red supergiants lasts . 
  but 16000 years could easily be just a fraction of a percent of its life like this , so even if almost dead , it would have to be very very very almost dead to say that . 
  think its worse than inappropriate - use of mics in a parliament is governed by that parliament 's rules of order , no ? 
  else anyone in the house could rant however they want . 
  and surely there 's no way a stenographer gets to use it for whatever purpose . 
   sibling to a converted jw, 
  hm , so they actually succeed some times ? 
  hm , but the evangelicals are almost just as successful in attracting them away from catholicism . 
  indeed , it really seems great !, 
  i think i 'd prefer it if minimal were a proper extension of the class mechanism , rather than ( just ) a pragma . 
  i think its a desirable language feature to be defining minimal complete definitions wherever appropriate , while pragmas typically deal with extralinguistic compiler stuff , like optimizations . 
  ofc tiny nitpick . 
  we surely would n't have gotten the antidiscrimination laws , the church was in uproar and that gov does n't normally do anything not blessed by the church - if they were n't a condition for joining . 
  i guess this is like the prop8 situation , a rabid religious group exploiting the weakness in the constitutional order , left after loosening referendum rules , including constitutional referendums , w/o any limits on eligable questions , w/o a minimal quorum , or dual majority or supermajority requirements etc. 
  combined with a highly politicized structure of the constitutional court , unlikely to stop this on some horizontal grounds . . 
  edit : we are getting all the material benefits of marriage supposedly , apart from adoption ; they can have the bloddy name , 
  it 's a pyrrhic victory for them i think - nobody was prepared to open the issue of gay marriage yet . 
  new government said they 'll create this strong civil union , but that we should be `` realistic '' and not expect marriage soon . 
  and now , they 've divided the croats roughly in half on the matter , and kept gay rights topics in the news for a year or so more or less non-stop . 
  last and only poll suggest 54 % is in favor of this bigoted line in the constitution ( though a far greater majority is predicted in the referendum by that same poll , 70ish % i guess the religious bigots are much more motivated to vote than ppl who are n't affected by this one way or another ) . 
  that 's looks amazingly low to me , in such short time . 
  consider , first gay pride was in 2002 , and quite violent . 
  just 2 years ago , a violent first pride in the second largest city etc. 
   christian rather than actually following the bible ? 
  fundamentalist protestant bias . 
  for one , more mainstream protestants will accept historical reading of the bible as simply more informed of the intention and purpose of those texts , and in consequence the intentions of the supposedly divinely inspired people writing and consuming them . 
  and for another , catholics and orthodox will not even see the raw bible so definitive , as opposed to its traditional interpretations by church bishops annointed in the magic of apostolic succession or something like that . 
  do n't presume the parochial strain of christianity you 're best aquainted with is universal . 
   lol bias ? 
  i 'm not even christian . 
  you can call yourself whatever you want ,,
