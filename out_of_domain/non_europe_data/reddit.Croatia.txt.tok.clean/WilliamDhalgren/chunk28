  and most of those banning also civil unions ? 
   i like how the ** catholic church acts all liberal ** and accepting of science in ** europe **, 
  try any eastern european country dominated by catholicism and then tell me it acts liberal ... its unabashedly as conservative in say social questions , as probably fundamentalist across the pond . 
  case in point - recent croatian referendum ... 
   written by in hebrew by the ancient israelites ,, 
  huh ? 
  what gave you that idea ? 
  its from the gospels , hence the original , as far as anyone can tell , is greek . 
  really ? 
  that 's actually sooner than i thought , so it has say 1 % chance to go off in just the next two centuries , or 10 % for the next two millenia ? 
  wow , not negligible at all . 
  luckly , should n't be that terrible according to this source http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23458-supervolcano-eruptions-may-not-be-so-deadly-after-all.html#.uquv1uj9bv8, 
  ie , kills off everything in a 100km radius , 1-2 degc cooling for a few decades , possibly much worse in the first years , and that seems to be it . 
  north america would get royally fucked , the world would be hit for a time , but not catastrophically beyond the initial years . 
  strange it tries to link gotovina to the conservatives and the church , since after return , he distinctly avoided meeting with the conservative icons , whilst maintaining some personal links with the centre-left government , and his public statements have been either completely apolitical or vaguely problematic to the right - thanking the institutions of government and the president ( both center-left at this point ) , stating that the war is long over , and we should rather turn to the future , in the eu , where we belong , that people of all nationalities defended croatia , and that serbs should return etc. 
  to the extent some right-wing extremists already pronounced him a traitor , paradoxically . 
  he did n't even comment any issues relating to war veterans , like opening of their list to the public , or matters of material rights . 
  edit2 : and if he chose differently , his popularity at a peak , and openly attacked the government , as he could on multiple fronts , i could easily see it crumbling under massive protests . 
  so given that opportunity cost , so to speak , he 's actually been quite supportive . 
  if he does choose a political career , these acts are probably consistent with seeking the presidency , as a unifying cross-partisan figure , and so avoiding spending his political capital in partisan ways . 
  though he ofc claims to have no political ambitions . 
  edit : anyhow , apart from this point , a decent overview , and pretty much the reason i feel like puking when seeing pope francis in the media . 
  its that same fucking church that pretty openly campaigned for and entrenched my continuing discrimination in the constitution couple of weeks ago , and is now openly campaigning for limiting serb minority rights - that 's their actions , and impact , his for now empty posturing does exactly nothing to mitigate it , and even probably helps its continuation , by improving their previously damaged image . 
  yes , i think its the only reasonable compromise - at least if having some kind of restriction is non-negotiable ( which i do prefer but also feel bad about having this preference imposed on ppl who do n't ) , then better a more targeted intervention to the content that actually provoked it . 
  and provided the modteam is confident it can consistently enforce it , reasonably promptly . 
  which seems to be the case . 
  given the options in the original discussion thread , certainly this feels more consistent than weekends-flavor options . 
  that was my understanding too . 
  and if anything 's caucasian , surely the greeks are , irrespective of a climante-dependant and slightly darker skin tone vs some random nordic ideal . 
  but , biologically , even the existence of race is dubious - forensics claim it a useful category , while evolutionary biology just does n't see any races in humans . 
  it 's not a clade , its not even a bunch of correlated clines - there 's just no `` joints '' in nature there by which to split humanity . 
  all you get is just porous genetic variation generally following the planet 's geography , neighbors similar to neighbors , and with various genetic traits having little coordination in how they vary over it . 
  so given that , i guess its a matter of social convention more than anything . 
  i think your point is better than your examples . 
  since , if genghis khan is your reference , then i think that 's exactly op 's point - that type of awful . 
  now , monarchy may be immoral , but there 's still a world of difference between a genghis khan , and say a frederick the great ( which is n't to say frederick is a saintly figure ofc ) . 
  now , murdering political opponents certainly is n't something any kind of dictator would necessarily oppose . 
  nor would demanding whatever you need to further your imperialist goals . 
  so i do n't see any issue with putting pressure on john to get whatever he needs , and he 's prob right to get rid of a lord of questionable loyality . 
  otoh , i do think the religion thing is a huge minus with him , and i do n't think a rigid legalist with little taste or skill in intrigue would make an effective ruler . 
  and i do n't see any potential for positive reform from his rule - which could be expected of a good king ala the enlightened absolutists of actual history . 
  he 'd even ban prostitution ffs !, 
  not sure re his mastermind status , since a boy outplayed him easily , and not by doing anything truly brilliant . 
  and to an extent because tywin underestimated him . 
  but , surely nobody claimed he 's a saint ? 
  but brutal , ruthless , without restraint , powerful . 
  that 's the point of the castelmere story surely , even disregarding the terror of riverlands ? 
  but also , effective . 
  remember the stony sept story by john connington ? 
  john kept telling himself that even tywin would not have been able to do better . 
  but myles toyne notes , that tywin would n't have bothered with the search , but would have simply burned the place down . 
  killing innocents and winning the war . 
  sounded like john regrets not doing the same , but rather acting `` honorably '' , and `` good '' ... 
  seems to be consensual , even well after adulthood . 
  not sure where the problem is ( `` uhhhh but the taboo : there 's a proper and all the wrong ways for ppl to fuck ... '' : / ) . 
  really seems like the only honest love story in the `` now '' of the books , and even that went sour fairly quickly ... 
  ah , fair point . 
  its a political marriage though , so i ca n't hold it much against them . 
  though many expect it to turn reealy bad wrt valonqar prophecy , y. 
  re cersei 's feelings , quite right , but i still do n't think she 's insincere ; she needed to manipulate lancel ( and others ) , and also , from tyrion 's pow i think , maybe saw a bit of jaime in him . 
  think there are some gnostic strands along those lines . 
  i remember a description of such a belief in a book by ernesto sabato , `` abaddon el exterminador '' . 
  it 's been a while but the idea i think was , that jesus was the last and failed attempt for the good deity to free itself from the shackles in hell , where the demon yahweh imprisoned it for eternity . 
  i think a fairly typical gnostic belief is that the creator is a demon , and creation inherently evil . 
  unless you can find natural antimatter around , its not a source but the most potent fuel , but one you need to produce by expending energy from some other source . 
  you could make a micro black hole though , use hawking radiation for source . 
  but there are other kinds of fusion you can use if you make hot enough plasma . 
  deuterium is abundant , or you can use boron 11 , or the cno cycle , or just plain hydrogen etc. 
  after tritium , next easiest for fusion would be deuterium , which is quite abundant . 
  much easier than he3 anyhow . 
  or if you want aprotic fusion , boron seems ideal . 
  seems to be plenty of it around natural gas deposits , so no need to mine the moon for it yet . 
  you could also breed helium 3 . 
  iter will breed tritium from lithium 6 . and tritium decays to helium3 . 
  can be also created from deuterium , boron , nitrogen . . 
  i 'm not sure why its worth the bother , esp if breeding it from tritium ; much much easier to burn tritium directly . 
  d-t is actually feasible , jet and jt-60 tokamak can prob produce more power than they consume already ( was below on the actual run while back , but later tweaking under d-d plasma test should extrapolate to producing just over what it consumes when they add tritium again ) that way , and iter should even have a self-sustaining reaction . 
  and he3 is far more remote , and needs even bigger , hotter plasma , and these are already at the limits of current engineering . 
  and for what gain ? 
  could be interesting for propulsion perhaps ... 
  ca n't remember any documentaries on the topic per se, 
  but , there are ttc video lectures by bart d. ehrman , `` historical jesus '' . 
  torrentable . 
  a yale course on the new testament , `` new testament history and literature '' by dale b. martin , had a lot to say on the matter too . 
  that 's on youtube and i really enjoyed it , http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl279cfa55c51e75e0&amp;feature=plcp, 
  hm , well , i 'm a big fan of classical and esp romantic-era music , edit and poetry / edit but less familiar with the visual arts . 
  too bad there was no way to express that among the questions . 
  so i lied and claimed to visit art galleries all the time to compensate :-d, 
  hm , thx i guess , but if i read that correctly , the atheist on that screenshot did seem quite crass ... 
  edit ah , and that was your point , then ppl started generalizing , and you had to object . 
  stupid comment , ignore , sry . 
  i would n't be surprised if the combined militaries of the planet were n't big enough to match it . 
  though russia could always nuke it out of existence i guess . 
  and take the retaliatory strike ... 
  but that 's not a great scenario ... 
  or finland , albeit there its blocked due to coalition dynamics , with the christian democrats a crucial partner for the coalition, 
  i was confused where was your post above aiming . 
  oh , so you just mean , a bunch of other causes . 
  fine , i agree with the other response then - obv lgbt equality is all that 's meant here . 
   ( and , in fact , does n't even necessarily address the inequality faced by those gender and sexual minorities for whom marriage is not a panacea ) .
