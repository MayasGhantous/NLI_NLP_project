  we know this to be the case since 98 ' . 
  another such case is if it is permeated by a scalar field , like in models of inflation . 
  in inflationary model , you start with a tiny patch of space , possibly something that could happen by a random quantum fluctuation spontaneously ( or maybe we just do n't know ) , and it is filled by just such a field , and of incredible density . 
  this causes the spacetime to inflate to gargantuan proportions at least - and possibly , in some models , never stops at all so at any time some parts of that space continue to inflate . 
  the field decays as this happens , and at some point reheating happens , and the huge potential energy of the inflation fields convers into particles , radiation . 
  inflaton creates all the matter and all of the spacetime of the universe from ( practically ) nothing . 
  confirming this story is why the recent bicep2 result , still contested , is such a big deal . 
  an article that goes further on the matter : http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/inflation/, 
  so , i 'm calling the account such as this deflationary because it seems to reject the premise of the question - the notion that nothing is somehow fundamental and that something comes from it . 
  our best understanding of cosmology seems to imply that `` nothing '' , if it ever existed at all ( ie in eternal inflation , there need n't be anything before ) , is highly unstable , spontaneously nucleating many different somethings , some of which at least grow into gargantuan universes , far far bigger than the farthest we could possibly see with our instruments , and spontaneously generate a bunch of radiation and matter when this ridiculously fast growth comes to an end . 
  in a quite different sense then originally meant , nature maybe really does abhor `` vacuum '' . 
  now as to the possibly deeper question , like `` but why these equations '' - ie : fine , our theory can , let 's be generous here , `` predict '' events like creation happening in the manner described , but why these specific equations , allowing things like creation , complexity etc , happen to be the real world , rather than anything else at all - or nothing at all ? 
  i not only do n't have an answer , a sketch of an answer - i 'm not even sure what an answer could possibly entail . 
  it asks about a hypothetical scenario about which we not only can not have an experimental contact , but ca n't even speculate based on hints from the theory - since it considers precisely - why not a different theory . 
  only notion i know of that touches it at all seems to be tengmak 's argument - as far as we can tell , the fundamental nature of reality consists of mathematical structures . 
  so since its hopeless to determine why some would exist and other not , presume all of mathematical objects is real , describing different universes . 
  many really trivial , but some complex enough to describe what we see around us . 
  but what does this speculation buy us ? 
  also , sri lanka is mostly buddhist , not exclusively hindu, 
   most american adverts are dubbed into in aussie accent ,, 
  huh ? 
  why do they bother doing even that ? 
  well neither situation would have necessarily lead to ww3 - it was just a really risky one . 
  in the second case :, 
  `` petrov 's responsibilities included observing the satellite early warning network and notifying his superiors of any impending nuclear missile attack against the soviet union . 
  if notification was received from the early warning systems that inbound missiles had been detected , the soviet union 's strategy was an immediate nuclear counter-attack against the united states ( launch on warning ) ... 
  some cold war analysts [ who ? ], 
  question whether the soviet union 's standard ** protocol requiring multiple-source warnings ** would have been strictly followed in the case of the missile attack warning involving petrov . 
  it is ** conceivable ** that if petrov had declared the satellite warnings valid , such an erroneous report could have provoked the soviet leadership into becoming bellicose . 
  . . so the incident was prevented at the earliest stage , but it should n't have caused `` retaliatory '' strike if the protocol were followed to the letter anyhow - though there was a real risk of it being ignored and a first strike launch happening nevertheless . 
  in the first case , they were supposed to launch the 10kt torpedo , but this need n't have ended with a full-force nuclear exchange . 
  kennedy adopted the policy of flexible response http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flexible_response , allowing for a more proportional response to attacks , rather than relying on massive response as the only option . 
  that 's what ( serbo ) croatian uses too , nilski konj . 
  or alternatively `` water horse '' , voden ( i ) konj . 
  voltaire did something like that in candide . 
   the state , which is bound constitutionally to neither promote or impede religion , is simply trying to issue license photos . 
  well , either the rules in question are pointless anyhow and should be universally removed , or the exceptions for headgear are actually impeding the effectiveness of those regulation . 
  in which case the state is trading the common interest to accommodate religious interests , effectively hurting at least those that are n't of such religions to the benefit of those who are , rather than actually being neutral on the matter of religion . 
  wow , sooo , a person opposed to the belief in god or gods should be disqualified by an atheist activist organization on the basis of holding such a view ? 
  obviously those that consider religious belief and organized religions harmful and worth opposing will be most motivated to engage in atheist activism . 
  but you manage to sound like this is somehow a bad thing ?? 
  bizzare ... 
  i guess symmetrically , people that consider that convincing others in the existence of a god or correctness of a religion is important should not be allowed to engage in public relations positions in religious organizations either . 
  that 's supposed to be the milky way ? 
  looks like a photo . 
  so it ca n't be . 
  that was fun . 
  yeah , us centric questions are all well known issues , though i guess merely being european biases me to the liberal choices there . . 
  right , exactly - thought it was a photo of some spiral galaxy , so that labeling it milky way was a bit deceptive . 
  rendered you say - but i thought the big visible dots on its edges were individual foreground stars on a photo . 
  what are they then , rendered clusters ? 
  ha , nice , thx for the explanation . 
   if someone were to present a good argument for the merit of eastern philosophy , present good works of eastern philosophy that fit this mold , or if new philosophers who happened to be from the east arose who displayed these levels of rigor in their work ( i.e. 
  presenting arguments for their positions , developing those positions , etc. ), 
  i think its akin to reading philosophy from some earlier stages of western thought , plus a huge barrier in translating and connecting the concepts . 
  which is something that 's done , at least as history of philosophy . 
  i remember struggling with vasubandhu 's abhidharmakosabhasyam . 
  difficult enough to just understand the system it develops - but twice as difficult to connect to matters philosophy is usually concerned about . 
  comparative philosophy does work on such issues though . 
  i think it can be inspiring - seeing how different premises could have lead to different systems than what we 're used to in history of western thought - but i would n't expect it to be full of truly relevant and original insights on its own . 
  rofl , makes you proud to be british . 
   thx !, 
  while that notion is just pure fiction - why would people even think hinduism or buddhism have any notion of jesus is beyond me - the reverse is actually the case . 
  there is a medieval legend of barlaam and josaphat , ostensibly about a christian martyr , but apparently it developed as a corruption of the story of the life of buddha . 
  buddha , under the name of josaphat , was made a saint of the catholic and orthodox church . 
  had the great pleasure and opportunity to hear an early music concert , by katarina livljanich , tracing the development of the story across time and space , with her singing in greek , latin , old-russian , old-croatian , old-french , and medieval occitan . 
  hm , i thought price 's position was more that any historical jesus figure , whether it existed or not , is so overlaid by mythological accretions that there 's no way to identify it - rather than arguing that there probably was no historical figure around which this all nucleated at all . 
  carrier was more aggressively pursuing that strand , at least . 
  here in the quote from wiki this seems explicit :, 
   '' ( w ) hat one jesus reconstruction leaves aside , the next one takes up and makes its cornerstone . 
  jesus simply wears too many hats in the gospels -- exorcist , healer , king , prophet , sage , rabbi , demigod , and so on . 
  the jesus christ of the new testament is a composite figure ( ... ) the historical jesus ( if there was one ) might well have been a messianic king , or a progressive pharisee , or a galilean shaman , or a magus , or a hellenistic sage . 
  but he can not very well have been all of them at the same time . '', 
  on the other hand , an author like bart d. ehrman is very critical of the jesus myth theory while being no less critical of biblical interpretation in religions ( see books like misquoting jesus , forged , how jesus became god , the orthodox corruption of scripture ) . 
  so i 'd think it would be wise to not be too committed to this theory unless its more solidly substantiated or argued - so that any honest scientist comes to that conclusion ( as opposed to the partisan apologists who never will ) . 
  ha , just mentioned the barlaam legend to another poster in this thread !, 
  as a fellow ex-buddhist , do you still find certain buddhist text worth revisiting , or topics interesting to re-explore ? 
  i 've not actually gone back to reading the text with any intensity after finally severing my buddhist identity ( last effort was struggling with abhidharma-ko\u015ba-bh\u0101sya , in pruden-poussin translation ) , but think that some early parts of the pali canon might still feel inspiring , like the theragata . . 
  right , re article , i completely agree . 
  i think a few interesting connections that did happen were with the continental tradition , similarly lacking rigor - between the existentialists and the kyoto school . 
  perhaps nishida , tanabe , nishitani could be given the kind of attention given to say jaspers or sartre . 
  re abhidharmakosabhasyam - well , its a mind-numbing work consisting mostly of lists  a decent portion ( say half of a volume ) of it is on some mythical cosmology , describing various sections of hells or various superqualities of a buddha or levels of meditation etc. 
  various madhyamaka works are probably heavier on the polemics , with interesting argumentations , and probably a better introductory material - but after some surface understanding of what they 're trying to say , interpreting the arguments and their real targets and the strength of the objections in their true context properly can be a bitch , and the authors there presuppose their readers being familiar with the kind of thinking detailed in kosha . 
  that 's what led me there . . 
  but what felt as such excessive self-referentiality ( or just a wide cultural gap - that 's likely how it would feel ) and heavy jargon of these traditions is what ultimately defeated my interest in it , and trying to figure out what 's actually at stake there and so `` fish '' out some relevant insights from their fights about say the svabhava or s\u016bnyata or say shentong in the tibetan thought etc. 
  it really does take dedicated scholars specializing in the field to digest . 
  it is a very systematic exposition of a specific strand of abhidharmic thought , however , and of high historic significance for northern strands of buddhism - but not one i 'd recommend for dipping your fingers into it . 
  probably the interesting portion is analyzing world into phenomena in a few parallel systems ( skandhas , ayatanas , dhatus , indriyas ) , in the first volume . 
  or at least this was where i still felt getting something insightful for the effort spent . 
  karma and defilements parts was challenging but had potential , should reread them . 
  i 'm not familiar with das kapital or another work by marx discussing the death penalty ... 
  he did say that no study of this population plausibly demonstrated adverse effects of eating gmo foods specifically - but yeah it would be nice to know exactly what methodologies are used to reach such conclusions . 
  he proposed that societies will abolish the category of private ownership of the means of production ( factories and the like ) . 
  and he described this as something that inevitably will develop in societies - a process of social evolution like the one by which capitalism dismantled serfdom and feudal rule . 
  how exactly this would work was a debatable matter - even in soviet russia - which are events removed from marx by quite a gulf in time and space , as well as the social situation and political position of the protagonists - bukharin vs stalin had differing opinions on whether this should continue to only include nationalization of the `` commandeering heights '' of the industry - largest enterprises , especially those of strategic importance like say coal and steel - or much more invasive methods . 
  obviously insisting that something law does n't recognize you can own , like a factory , is really yours is so hopeless that short of desperate physical attempts to block access to it , or hiring thugs to do the same somewhat less desperately , which would indeed surely provoke a police intervention , there is not that much you even can do about it . 
  certainly does n't seem threatening enough to require the death penalty , or really any additional legal tool to deal with . 
   the tremendous zeal with which the apostles pursued the ideals they held . 
  usual accusations were of being a counterrevolutionary and/or a western collaborator . 
  which is to say , a threat to their grip on political power - rather than a worry about possible nonconformism to the economic order of things .
