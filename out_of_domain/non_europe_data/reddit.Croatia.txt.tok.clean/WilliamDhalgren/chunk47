  hm , well i heard this thinking , was given to believe its the catholic party line , did n't check . 
  who you 're attracted to may not be a choice , fine - but ofc its still a choice to live a `` gay life '' - since you could live in celibacy instead . 
  people do live sexless lives , its a sacrifice but certainly a bearable one . 
  being gay is not a sin , acting on these impulses is . 
  action implies choice . 
  i guess they see it as some kind of a test by god or something like that . 
  oh yes , diacetyl has been on the radar for advocates of stronger workplace safety standards for a while . 
  apparently ultimately successfully . 
  somewhat stale info :, 
   the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) conducted several studies that confirmed the link between occupational exposure to artificial butter flavoring and lung diseases . 
  in 2000 they issued recommendations to a missouri microwave popcorn plant about protecting workers from this hazard , and in 2003 they sent an alert recommending safeguards to 4,000 businesses that might use or make butter flavoring . 
  these standards are what farsalinos study compared with and found them exceeded over two times in vapor . 
  comparing with workplace exposure standards has been common practice in assessing vaping toxicity and apart from diacetyl containing juices shows an impressive level of safety for vaping . 
  this is solvable , since its not a contaminant of something essential , nor produced by the mechanism of vaporisation ; it may not be panic worthy but its def the worst skeleton in our closet , it does seem actually significantly harmful , and so we can and should fix it . 
  not that difficult - simply stop selling diacetyl-containing juices . 
  costs are just the costs of making the tests and removing the offending flavors . 
  not trivial but for a business not that expensive either . 
  fda and similar regulatory agencies will force such shit anyhow , and it will just get worse the more we ignore it . 
  yeah , fact you ca n't buy the juices normally seems far far worse than this . 
  if they 're really gon na treat it like a cig , they can put some pictures of corpses on envelopes of juice but sell it on every stand . 
  i would n't mind that much . 
  yeah , i often vape base . 
  just vg ( + some water ) and nicotine . 
  and like it quite a lot , possibly more consistently than any particular flavor i tried yet . 
  dropping a bit of flavor here and there for variety but mostly just that . 
  i 'd certainly suggest going that way , if you have any inclination . 
  not so much that i had any health issues , but finding a flavor that 's good for a long time/big order is difficult for me , and for health precaution reasons you state - there 's too much unknown , and simply unnecessary . 
  wow fire and then explosion !, 
  much worse than many other imr short tests i saw . 
  and this too is li-mn02 apparently . 
  is the size a factor here ? 
  eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz21ekqnnsg edit as a commenter below warned --  this guy 's doing this indoors without ventilation or using a respirator - so this is highly dangerous given how toxic these gasses are . 
  / edit, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqocka-rh-s - that 's not a short really , just a too low build left on autofire . 
  ahh , right , forgot about that . 
  no idea . 
  summary says so yes . 
  i did n't really see the study because paywall ; so idk if they measured or quoted literature on that . 
  does n't change anything i said imho - we 're far far better than that standard on any other unavoidable exposure , yet this is manifestly avoidable , since we 're putting it there for flavor . 
  yeah , absolutely , should have stated so next to the link as well . 
  will add . 
  yeah , i gathered the temperature imr needed to get to to start a thermal runaway is far greater than what other tests saw them plateauing around ( think that was around 120degc ) . 
  maybe some sparking happened around that short or something ? 
  or as you said , bad luck . 
  ... so use a fuse , why regulation ? 
  exactly - if nic is legal to adults , should be legal for a minor under parental supervision as well . 
  it might be their attempt at quitting . 
  law should n't pronounce on what 's a good way to do so , risk tradeoffs are a personal decision . 
  additionally , i find criminalizing possession of anything really problematic . 
  you 're just terrorizing the victims there . 
  you should be targeting sales with the law . 
  further , owning a resistor connected to a power source and a switch can not ever be a felony , and that 's the only sane definition of an ecig device itself . 
  those feet do n't seem too brontosaurus ' y ( aka apatosaurus ` y )  happy cakeday !, 
  wonderful . 
  think i 'll go for a .6 ohm version of that . 
  today . 
  vapemail in . 
  why yes , where all the other battery tests can be found too . 
  http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/efest%20imr18650%203100mah%20%28purple%29%202014%20uk.html look pretty good at 10a actually . 
  they do look like the panasonics . 
  quite similar - and under the keepower is also :, 
  - an ncr18650be , just like what the report says for the efests . 
  however the tests for either do look good at 10a to the tester . 
  could anyone see the spec of it ? 
  would be interesting to see ncr18650be vs ncr18650bd which def is rated at 10a by panasonic too . 
  maybe just market segmentation ? 
  donthatetheplayer stated the common best options . 
  just to add if you 're staying well below 10a ( say above or around .5 ohm builds , or .4 tops ) , two panasonic cells seem good too : ncr18650pd/pf at 2900mah and the newer ncr18650bd at 3200mah . 
  and you can see the discussion below about the uncertainties re ncr18650be and its rewrapped version , including a purple efest , at similar capacity to ncr18650bd and provisionally good-looking tests , but more dubious rating . 
  this seems interesting http://dampfakkus.de/akkutest.php?id=535 . 
  curve at 7a is quite similar and a tiny bit better than ncr-pf/pd , little usable difference from the increased capacity rating . 
  too bad i do n't have a proper ncr-bd test to compare that with . 
  at least should n't be worse , so i 'd expect a really good cell there . 
   en : there 's some confusion about its rated max continuous discharge rate . 
  some say it 's roughly 4a , others quote a default 2c rating which would put it to 6,4 a. 
  it does perform fine at up to 10a in my own tests . 
  so i 'd say 6.4 a is more likely . 
  also to link some tests on batteries mentioned , in my pecking order , based on http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/common18650comparator.php :, 
  * vtc5 from which you started : http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/sony%20us18650vtc5%202600mah%20%28green%29%20uk.html . 
  nothing is really quite as good in terms of voltage drop , capacity at relevant voltages for even a 7a load . 
  * sadly no 25-r samsung test by the same guy , but according to some other tests should be quite close to and slightly better to lg he2 . 
  * lg he2 rewrapped as purple efest ' 35a ' : http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/efest%20imr18650%202500mah%20%28purple%29%202014%20uk.html or rewrapped as keeppower http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/keeppower%20imr18650%202500mah%20%28black%29%202014%20uk.html - a really good cell , at 7a or at 20a , less voltage drop and at least somewhat better capacity to vtc4 , for overall def more power . 
  * vtc4 rewrapped as keeppower : http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/keeppower%20imr18650%202100mah%20%28black%29%202014%20uk.html . 
  i was using this one as my measuring stick , compairing it with others . 
  * samsung inr18650-20r 2000mah to 20a - http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/samsung%20inr18650-20r%202000mah%20%28green%29%20uk.html - that one holds it own against a vtc4 , giving even slightly less of a voltage drop , tracking the curve closely , and giving exactly no difference in capacity , at any drain to 20a tested . 
  * panasonic ncr18650pf / orbitronic ncr18650pd : http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/orbtronic%2018650pd%202900mah%20%28black%29%20uk.html - in comparison at 7a , seems worse but surprisingly close to vtc4 . 
  somewhat more voltage drop esp at the start , but catches up . 
  prob would n't actually get more power out of it overall , but might even out if drained to around 3.1 v . 
  ofc there is no contest if i try even higher amperages . 
  * panasonic cgr1850ch / orbtronic imr18650 to 10a : http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/orbtronic%20imr18650%202250mah%20%28black%29%20uk.html - in comparison at 7a , seems def worse than ncr-be or ncr-pf . 
  more voltage drop , less capacity . 
  ofc far worse than a vtc4 if i up the amperage . 
  quite possible , its listed on the last additions . 
  vtc5 , the real one , rather than keepower rewrapped is on that list too . 
  i was looking for that just a few days ago , did n't notice it either at the time :, 
   last additions : charger awt utc , sony us18650nc1 2900mah ( green ) , is my battery protected ? , sony us18650vtc5 2600mah ( green ) , charger opus bt-c3100 v2 .1 , samsung icr18650-26h 2600mah ( pink ) , samsung icr18650-26f 2600mah ( pink ) , lg 18650 e1 3200mah ( green ) , charger basen s2 , ** efest imr18650 3100mah ( purple ) 2014 ** , brillipower 18650 3400mah ( black ) , windyfire imr18350 850mah ( red ), 
  if this is the same clive bates , he 's a long-term ally http://www.clivebates.com/ looks highly active in advocacy against the tobacco products directive . 
  loved his piece on snus too http://www.clivebates.com/?p=434,
