  running tally of the votes seems to show some 2/3 rejects . 
  hope this wo n't drag on for days before any official decision is made . 
  still , i disagree with your premise - the only relevant indicator what the community thinks has been the vote thread , and that 's only from yesterday . 
  that 's not taking an unreasonably long time to judge the situation . 
  grrm said new gods were inspired by medieval catholicism actually , in structure and institutions , with the 7 who are 1 inspired by the doctrine of the trinity . 
  and r'lhllor , `` lord of light '' was his fictionalization of zoroastrianism . 
  as i understand it , technically subs on reddit are the dictatorships of the top mod . 
  so only / u/tuber can do anything about anything . 
  btw your posting is simpy a lie , read your damn link :, 
    if that 's the case , i would guess he has n't completely decided yet , and ** does n't want to commit ** to a course of action ** until he actually looks over the data . 
   ** pretty much this . 
  i realize people want assurances , but things are chaos right now and i do n't want to commit to something . 
  ** i will say that so far ** i 'm not quite happy with the outcome of the changes ** anyway . 
  so he confirmed that he does n't particularly like the changes either , and has not stated he wo n't commit to the results ( nor has he stated that he will - which is more troubling ) . 
  all he sad in what you link is that he 'll study the data before deciding . 
  agreed . 
  i just saw jij saying in a comment explicitly : '' so far i 'm not quite happy with the outcome of the changes anyway . '', 
  and in another , which i ca n't find to quote exactly , that he did n't expect this change would wipe out the memes from the sub as near-completely as it did . 
  so i presume that 's what he 's unhappy with in the outcomes . 
  so i think he agrees with those points too . 
  he just wanted to up the bar a bit to make them float to the top a bit less . 
  seems to have decimated them instead . 
  . . and 6 of those are now seen as infallible papal declarations only retroactively . 
  while the tradition of papal infallibility has older roots , it has only been the dogma since 1870 . 
  and only the assumption of mary dogma from 1950 by pius xii has happened since of those in that list ( there 's no official list ), 
  how did this work ? 
  image posts which is n't a self.post ? 
  will the bot remove it ? 
  did the rules change already ? 
  if its just pending for the bot to kick in , note that there 's a raging dissatisfaction that the mod changed the rules making imageposts banned unless they 're made as self posts - see the sidebar :, 
   images are still allowed ... just make them a self post . 
  if you do n't , the bot will remove then and even reply with a helpful link so that you can repost as a self in just 2 clicks . 
  any images can be in a self post . 
  edit : ah , here comes the bot . 
  i 'm sorry for the inconvenience . 
  wow , what an overreaction, 
  um , `` i had no idea this was going to turn into such a fiasco '' does n't seem like some great support to what and how it was done ( just that he overall prefers it and hopes for the best in the future ) , and the specific change made was not apparently suggested , ( `` some system in place '' is all that 's mentioned ) . 
  i do n't see him being opposed to provocative content - i really do n't see anyone here being opposed to provocative content . 
  he just agrees that the reddit scoring algorithm unjustly favors `` low-effort content '' and that this should be corrected for somehow . 
  thus far , i 'd agree . 
  most of what was done , and how , and the actual effects of the changes , not really . 
  these are the kinds of posts that worry me most re the new changes . 
  others for eg claim some witty memes mocking their religion were their first steps in deconversion etc. 
  and this place has always been here , among other things , for venting and coping of ppl stuck in a bad religious place . 
  i must admit , did n't like that r/atheism was so circlejearky and so many memes were quite bad ( damn i wish rage comics make a comeback and displace sheltered suburban moms , they at least had a few panels of context ) < edit  , and consequently was so looked down upon by most reddit , even on quality of content alone . 
  like we do n't get enough stigma based on the type of content ... < / edit , 
  and i too use r/atheism as a coping tool in a religious environment ( though not under pressure from immediate family and friends ) . 
  but this is working out a bit better for me ( its too draconian still i think ), 
  so , what specifically about how it was helped you cope ? 
  why the current one does n't do it ? 
  too tame ? 
  that still leaves the 2-step submission/viewing process . 
  < edit  and there 's the inability of ppl to filter this content completely if its all self.posts < / edit  if one is to add features to reddit itself , maybe it would be easier to be able to make posts karmaless based on a filter ? 
  or just a bot that can add as much negative link karma to a user , as he got positive by upvotes on a particular post ? < edit  or if one could create a post for all the negative karma , somehow hidden from the normal users , and undeletable , one per submitter , and just have a bot downvote that in proportion to the upvotes any of his image submission get ? < / edit , 
  if karmawhoring prevention is the target of the change . 
   the other subreddits i 've seen that have disallowed direct image posts have had their content improve drastically . 
  could you expand on this ? 
  similar stories in different subs , similar rules , maybe a story of subs going through such changes ? 
  i love the idea . 
  and ianal so ... 
  section 4 seems to have no effect . 
  it states what does n't exist in the constitution anyhow . 
   the subreddit started with an experiment in minimal , hands-off moderation . 
   as the subreddit has grown the userbase has naturally come to differ in the opinion of how moderation shoud be handled . 
  the only possible compromise between `` minimal hands-off moderation '' and `` some hands-on moderation '' is `` minimal hands-on moderation . '', 
  i think constitutional matters ( principles , rights and institutional structure ) should be distinct from operational ( eg . 
  current moderator policy ) . 
  if this document should in principle be a lasting statement on how this place is run , i do n't think it can contain judgements on what kind of moderation rules will apply . 
  we could rather specify how to create and amend moderation policy . 
  ( for eg , describe how the initiative for the current change should have been handled - say formal initiative , discussion period , vote , eligibility of voters , calculating result ), 
  regarding the amendment procedure for the constitution , i 'd propose using the same policy as for moderation changes < edit  possibly requiring a greater majority < / edit  , but also allowing for moderators to veto . 
  say 2 moderator votes against the change or more can block any constitutional amendment . 
  i 'd remove section 3 . completely from the constitution , and consider that a lesser document . 
  i do n't have any insights into the practicalities of moderation , so idk , few things strike me as possibly impractical in it , like 10min limit ( but idk what exactly is a moderation queue ) , and voting to moderate . 
  i 'll write more in another post . 
   qualifications for elected moderators will consist of subscription to the atheism subreddit for a period of one year or greater . 
  qualifications for randomly chosen moderators will consist of having posted to the atheism subreddit at least once . 
  q : why are these so different ? 
  there 's ppl then who are eligible for elections but not for random choice and vice versa . 
  for consistency , maybe i 'd rather go with :, 
   qualifications for ~ ~ elected ~ ~ moderators will consist of subscription to the atheism subreddit for a period of one year or greater . 
  qualifications for randomly chosen moderators will ** additionally ** consist of having posted to the atheism subreddit at least once . 
  next :, 
   should an elected moderator wish to become inactive intentionally for a period of time ( not to exceed one and one half months ) notice needs to be given near the beginning of ( at least one week prior , and up to one week after ) the period of inactivity . 
  so , to get 2 weeks more of inactivity than what you can do with no fuss , you need to announce it a week before , and further you need to announce your return . 
  return should be fairly clear by the activity log , i do n't see the need for it at all . 
  and perhaps i 'd go with allowing a longer period of announced inactivity , or shorter period of unannounced , for there to be much point for the sentence . 
   any moderator may be recalled by a simple majority of the moderater pool . 
  a recall shall be initiated by the userbase with a 2/3rd majority in a poll . 
  ca n't we get a direct recall too somehow ? 
  i do n't see anything about how they 'll be elected . 
  i guess there needs to be some way to announce you 're standing for elections , check on eligibility by the moderators , some period for running , and finally some vote . 
  since there can be multiple candidates , and multiple seats , maybe the vote can be preferential ? 
  i 'd advocate schulze method for single-seat elections , and guess those would be most practical here ( not sure what proportional vote would supposed to mean in moderators , and if the number of elected ones is small , there is n't much proportionality you could get anyhow . 
  if its say 5 + , some stv variant is an option , that 's both proportional and individual vs list-based ) . 
  i think this site implemets it https://modernballots.com/ debian uses it ( as does wikimedia , gentoo , some pirate parties etc ) , think they have a . deb for the implementation somewhere http://www.debian.org/vote/, 
  anyhow , exact election method again should be more maleable than the overarching principle of democratic elections , so would treat that choice and changes like moderation policy, 
   things from here hit the front page and can impact the larger reddit community . 
  its only fair to allow outside members a voice . 
  fair enough ; either makes sense really .
