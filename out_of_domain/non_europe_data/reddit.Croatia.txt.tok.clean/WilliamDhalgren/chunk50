   there are no known toxicological synergies among compounds in the aerosol , and mixture of the contaminants does not pose a risk to health . 
  however , exposure of vapers to propylene glycol and glycerin reaches the levels at which , if one were considering the exposure in connection with a workplace setting , it would be prudent to scrutinize the health of exposed individuals and examine how exposures could be reduced . 
  all identified contaminants are on exposure levels at the very least an order of magnitude less than threshold limit values for workplace exposure standard , and similarly one or two orders of magnitude less than in tobbaco smoke . 
  what is less clear is possible long term effects of continued high exposure to the aerosol carriers themselves , propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin . 
  while there are generally recognized as safe , and used at concentrations below their threshold limit value - for pg , of 10 or 50 mg/m3 over 8 hours ( depending who you ask , lower is the us number set precautionary for `` all organic mists with no specific exposure limits or identified toxicity '' , higher from a review for health council of the netherlands trying to actually asses the best scientifically based risks ) - while ecig aerosol contains up to around 1 -- 6 mg/m3 in cases of extreme consumption and with worst case assumptions - as well as used as carriers for medicine , even in cases of asthmatic patients , this is not even an order of magnitude distance , and is a significant and long-term exposure . 
  ofc nicotine itself is taken at levels exceeding the tlv significantly , but that 's the whole point . 
  the aim here is to in fact approximate the exposure created by cigarettes so as to satisfy the addiction , and if anything , due to a slower increase in blood concentrations and lower peak , this is sadly underachieved with all but the most extremely concentrated liquids vaped on strong devices ( i wo n't go digging for that study , but there is one comparing the two , which seems to find parity only at something like 50mg/ml nicotine , which nobody vapes ), 
  so , there is every reason for preliminary optimism , certainly in comparison to smoking and possibly even regardless - still nothing before electronic cigarettes created quite such long term and significant exposures to declared ingredients ( as opposed to contaminants ) to be positive . 
   overall , the ** declared ingredients in the liquid would warrant a concern by standards used in occupational hygiene ** , provided that comparison to occupational exposure limits is valid , as discussed in the introduction . 
  however , ** this is not to say that the exposure is affirmatively believed to be harmful ; as noted , the tlvs for propylene glycol and glycerin mists is based on uncertainty rather than knowledge ** . 
  these tlvs are not derived from knowledge of toxicity of propylene glycol and glycerin mists , but merely apply to any compound of no known toxicity present in workplace atmosphere . 
  this aspect of the exposure from e-cigarettes simply has little precedent ( but see ** study of theatrical fogs ** below ) . 
  therefore , ** the exposure will provide the first substantial collection evidence about the effects ** , which ** calls for monitoring ** of both exposure levels and outcomes , ** even though there are currently no grounds to be concerned about the immediate or chronic health effects of the exposure ** . 
  theatrical fog study shows there is in fact preliminary reasons to limit exposure to propylene glycol :, 
   from this perspective , and taking the analogy of work on theatrical fogs [ 46,47 ] , it can be speculated that respiratory functions and symptoms ( but not cancer of respiratory tract or non-malignant respiratory disease ) of the vaper is of primary interest . 
  acrolein and formaldehide concentrations are another thing to keep an eye on . 
  again here they are generally fine , around 1 % of the tlv for acrolein , around 0 to 4 % of tlv for formaldehyde , better tests slighly lower . 
  far far below cigarette values ofc , like with everything else . 
  these can easily vary from devices and setups and generally vaping large amounts of liquid ( say of low nicotine concentration ) , risks higher exposure levels . 
  there was another study ( individual study not a review , so the conclusions are more suspect in principle ) i wo n't dig up , on how these levels varied with temperature and liquid type . 
  given a fixed , factory made coil , and changing the voltage - hence heating the same volume of metal with a fixed surface area to different temperature - showed significant increases in the exposure to the two , especially - and interestingly with pg-based and mixed liquids , reaching almost the levels of exposure in cigarettes . 
  i expected contrary since acrolein is a possible product of thermal decomposing of vg , and should be produced in some quantities when vaporizing it because its evaporation point is very slightly higher than the temperature of thermal decomposition . 
  admittedly its diluted , boiling temperature lowered with water and possibly some pg , but some fractional distillation could be happening etc. 
  in fact , vg liquids showed both lower initial concentrations and far less sensitivity to the temperature of the coil . 
  my take from this would be that if you wish maximal precaution , sticking to vg liquids with some water content , keeping your coils not too hot ( lower voltages on regulated devices with factory coils , or if building them for yourself , having substantial thermal mass and surface area of your coils , for the wattage you 're pushing ) , not doing particularly high wattage builds , but rather vaping less quantity with , if needed , somewhat higher nicotine content , minimum necessary to satisfy you .

  conclusion :, 
   ec aerosol can contain some of the toxicants present in tobacco smoke , but at levels which are much lower . 
  long-term health effects of ec use are unknown but compared with cigarettes , ec are likely to be much less , if at all , harmful to users or bystanders, 
  another thing to keep in mind is the possibility of flavorings containing food flavoring that while safe for ingestion , nevertheless are suspected to be harmful if inhaled . 
  see http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/g225g/ and a recent study - just a summary - http://www.scribd.com/doc/238345295/dr-farsalinos-study-on-diacetyl-in-e-liquid . 
  conclusions :, 
   da and ap were found in a ** large proportion of sweet-flavored ec liquids ** , at ** levels that were higher than the strictest safety limits but significantly lower compared to smoking . 
  ** the presence of these chemicals in ec liquids represents an ** avoidable risk ** . 
  proper measures should be taken by ec liquid manufacturers and flavoring suppliers to eliminate these hazards from the products , without necessarily limiting the availability of sweet flavors . 
  and when it says higher than strictest safety limits , its really serious - its double those limits !, 
  compare that to the discussion about unavoidable contaminants and ingredients above , where things did n't reach above 10 % of the limits . 
  but it can be avoided . 
  this is a problem the industry should eliminate - because it can be eliminated - but for now , prudent thing is to investigate the manufacturer of the liquid you plan to vape and/or to avoid certain flavors most likely to contain it , like sweet , buttery , creamy flavors . 
  mere declarations that they do n't contain it apparently are n't worth much , the study found juices so declared containing it as well . 
  right - then a translation - basically if he 's into rebuildables , he really needs most of the equipment on the picture . 
  or its prudent for him to have it . 
  and most of it need n't be expensive either ( cotton , wire , multimeter are dirt chip for eg ) . 
  he does have a lot of juices and i 'd be ok w 2 devices rather than 4 . 
  but that 's about it , nothing else is excessive there . 
  hmm , unfortunately its often not easy to find continuous amp rating . 
  sometimes shops just add `` continuous '' while they 're reporting max discharge , and the specs we know can inflate what the battery can take . 
  the easy way is to simply stick to just the top recommended batteries , these are widely tested , independently , and often have full specs online . 
  people know facts about them well . 
  you made that point yourself . 
  hell , i 'm not convinced what the actual rating of a famous battery , sony 26650vt is ( ie is it 50a max or continuous ) . 
  various sources give different info , ca n't google up the official spec , independent test would suggest its prob something between 20 and 30a continuous , consistent with the sources claiming its 26a . 
  who knows ... 
  chart you give is fairly dubious . 
  various numbers are questionable , and no references are provided . 
  but at least the numbers are conservative , so not a bad direction to point people towards . 
  declared specs , plus curves in specs and from independent tests , with discharge rates and ideally temperature curves ( i 've seen those in specs , not really on independent test ) can give you a good idea - on a continous rating the voltage drop wo n't eat up much into the overall capacity you get from it , and it wo n't be much worse , in equal amp increments than the difference from the previous lower amp curves . 
  and when you can see a temperature curve , prudent to keep below whatever current would cause it to go beyond say at worst 80degc . 
  pick the least number from all of this . 
  yeah , a cheapo multimeter is not really accurate enough for metering your ohms . 
  cheapo i 've got needs deducting the resistance of the probes , and takes a while for that number to stabilize . 
  in the end i 'm not sure within + -.1 ohms . 
  a normal ohmmeter can be far more precise . 
  regarding the tools you linked ( as opposed to the one you demonstrate , that is good ) says - `` calculate how many amps & volts your device is drawing from your battery '' - that is absolute nonsense . 
  the actual battery can only ever give its natural voltage , minus the voltage drop due to the current drawn . 
  you ca n't make a lipo/limn etc chemistries give say 7.75 v , ever which is what that piece of shit claims if i put say 50w and 1.2 ohm and calculate . 
  its not just that you do n't want to stress the battery , and might decide to go lower - if you check the discharge curves of say a good 10a rated battery w a good say 20/30a rated battery - you 'll see that even at say 7a load , you are n't actually getting any extra overall power even though the first one has a higher rated capacity , due to a deeper voltage drop . 
  you 're not even getting a the extra capacity unless you use the battery really low , almost fully discharged , yet you may want to stop discharging substantially before ~ 3v . 
  so effectively , you also just get a better battery ; ie more power , less voltage drop , by buying the highest-drain ones , even if you could be safe with a lower-rated one . 
  albeit a bit late - they should have done this from the start/years ago , its not a new issue - still , very responsible of them , kudos !, 
  i hope people with such scruples get back to making a good juice . 
  edit : oh wow ppl really did n't like this . 
  well , the psa on dyacetil has been on this subreddit for 3 years , the vaping world did n't just wake up to this issue and so i think manufacturers should have been more carefull since about 2009 , when the worry on this started . 
  maybe we could have avoided the negative publicity on it then . . 
  but i hope i was clear enough on how i respect them for this responsible decision once they found out , many would have done much less . 
  right . 
  though its not really hinsight - diacetyl has been a worry since 2009 , everyone knew it was in some flavorings , everyone knew it is potentially dangerous , some did steps to remove it way back then etc. 
  would make perfect and obvious sense to run some lab tests if you value safety , knowing the risk is there . 
  i simply think manufacturers such as these admirable people should have reacted sooner and more vigorously , and so this media histeria could have been avoided in the first place . 
  community had ample warning and knowledge , but apparently did n't care sufficiently . 
  i 'm amazed how negatively reddit reacted to presenting that opinion . 
  think it was a talk show with dimitri that discussed just this community responsibility for the debacle we 're facing. , thought it was a common position ... 
  my really cheap multimeter does have a sufficienty fine dial to be useful but not very precise . 
  you have to deduct the resistance on the leads , and end up with some + -.1 ohm imprecision in the end . 
  ohm meter in my local b&m store was not even able to get a contact with the old atty i had , while my probes can go anywhere , so it was at least better than that . 
  now 's the first time i 'm too low ( .6 ) so this imprecision matters somewhat , so i 'll take an ohmmeter too . 
  this build , i complemented the multimeter , used to check for shorts and the like and a preliminary verification of the resistance , with measuring out the precalculated wire length . 
  and was spot-on in resistance in the end . 
  i think this is a good practice - know your resistance precisely beforehand as well , by measuring out the wire accurately ( with a realistic number for what will be extra wire cut on the leads ) . 
  on the other hand , a multimeter is invaluable for debugging my mods , and builds generally - like looking for where the contact is failing if the thing is n't firing , measuring the voltage drop , checking if the resistance of the mod body or atty is suspicious , seeing the discharge status of the battery , checking the actual voltage over the coil ( the only real measure of the wattage ) ... 
  the gods only know how much more fiddling it would have taken me to debug at least 2 substantial malfunctions , with a button , where a tiny depression on the negative contact was preventing a connection , and another with a fuse where only measuring out the amperes showed something was off , and another with a 510 connection , which had a subtle short , i 've had in the last year without it . 
  presuming vapers self-titrate to achieve similar nicotine daily consumption levels to those cigarettes they smoked gave them , it would give around 60 % absorption . 
  i 've yet to see actual studies on the matter , testing this experimentally . 
  http://www.ecita.org.uk/blog/index.php/how-much-nicotine-is-absorbed-following-electronic-cigarette-use/ uses 1.4 mg for a cig . 
  when i first started vaping , i saw some other place giving 1.2 mg for a cig number . 
  vaping raises blood nicotine levels generally much slower than cigarettes do - http://www.nature.com/srep/2014/140226/srep04133/full/srep04133.html - perhaps one could extract some absorbtion numbers from this study ? 
   in this study a liquid with ** 18 mg/ml ** nicotine concentration was chosen , based on previous findings from our group showing that this is ** approximately the level of nicotine concentration needed for experienced vapers to consume 1 mg of nicotine in 5 minutes ** ( which is similar to the level of nicotine in the smoke of one cigarette when smoked according to iso 3308 ) 7 . 
  despite that , the main findings herein showed that such a liquid is insufficient to deliver nicotine to the blood stream as rapidly as smoking . 
  in fact , ** it took about 35 minutes of vaping with the new-generation device at high wattage in order to obtain plasma levels similar to smoking one cigarette in 5 minutes ** . 
   considering that it is reasonable to ** expect ec users to self-titrate nicotine ** intake in a way similar to smoking 20 , this study indicates that there is an inherent inability of the ec to deliver nicotine to the blood stream at levels similar to tobacco cigarettes within the same time-period of use , although a previous study from our group showed that an ** 18 mg/ml liquid would theoreticaly be adequate for that in terms of liquid consumption ** 7 .
