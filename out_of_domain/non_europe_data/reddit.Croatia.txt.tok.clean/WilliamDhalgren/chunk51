  ** possible reasons ** for these findings may be that nicotine delivered to the ec aerosol is ** not absorbed from the lungs but from the oral mucosa ** . 
  therefore , nicotine absorption would be expected to occur at a similar rate to nicotine-replacement therapies ( nrts ) .

  did n't that study also find that 25 % of the juices tested - and i think he only tested sweet flavors , ie those more likely to have it in the first place - did n't in fact have any of it ? 
  then it can be done . 
  but still there 's quite a difference between trace amounts and double the conservative workplace exposure limits . 
  if it were around 1 % of the tlv , it would be no worse than with formaldehyde , metals and other unavoidable contaminants we 're getting anyhow . 
  single guy , what ? 
   niosh has investigated the occurrence of, 
  severe lung disease in workers at a micro -,

   vg , or nicotine , or cotton , or kanthal , or nichrome , or rayon , or brass , or copper , or silica across the limitless spectrum of devices , wattages and temperatures, 
  but we have tested vg , nicotine and factory made coils , under common marketed devices ( egos and the like ) , use patterns and wattages fairly substantially , to conclusions that contaminants involved , like various metals , various volatile organic compounds , tobacco-specific nitrosamines etc are deply in the safe zone in comparison to occupational safety standards . 
  diacetyl is n't . 
  not by a long shot . 
  and we have some preliminary reasons to limit exposure to pg , on the basis of studies of effects of theatrical fogs to theatre workers , though this evidence is indirect and we should be fairly safe anyhow . 
  and production of any of the flavorings listed might come on the radar for occupational safety reasons , these are far greater and easier to identify populations exposed to their vapors than us vapers . 
  diacetyl did , these did n't . 
  yet . 
  we can manage some risks , those identified . 
  we ca n't manage unidentified risks , but there is a case to be made that we would have identified further risks if they were large , for occupational safety reasons . 
   but they were inhaling it 24/7 for a week ,, 
  common procedure to try to see what the long term effects of something at lower levels of exposure may be , when you do n't have long-term funding to follow up , or need quicker results otherwise . 
  all of this is precautionary , even when they do n't have sufficient data of any kind they can put precautionary limits ( like w pg ) . 
  but that seems a sensible conservative stance to take in face of uncertainties you need to manage . 
   i would expect to hear stories by now of people having lung damage due to vaping if this was the case . 
  it took decades to even realize the risks of cigarette smoke, 
  / r/mildlypenis, 
  what 's the diameter there ? 
  build calc suggests its something like 6mm if i counted those wraps right ( 6 ) ? 
  looks like some really low temperature vape , interesting . 
  i 'm running a .6 ohm dual parallel with 30ga and 2.4 mm dia , qute similar, 
  hm , would n't it be easier to go dual w parallel wire , with effectively the same end result ? 
  your coils are beautiful btw , 
  http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp?a=true&amp;s=dp&amp;r=1&amp;hfnw=17&amp;id=1.5 you 're prob not off by much ; numbers fit perfectly if its 1.5 mm . 
  turns out fairly hot given its barely subohm . 
  i ca n't believe coils in that photo really have less than 2mm diameter . 
  they look huge , somehow . 
  i was thinking of `` writing something that big ca n't be called a microcoil '' , but actually they are much smaller than it seems on the photo . 
  plenty of ppl said that already , but you must meter your resistance - this is the worst build i 've ever seen simply on the basis that you do n't know if you have a short in it or not before firing . 
  you were also unable to pulse fire them to make them even without idk protective gear since you did n't know if you have a short or not . 
  is one supposed to wear a kevlar suite just to vape ? 
  meter your resistance . 
  well , a parallel can still be a single wire , folded in half, 
  yeah , like any other surviving qm interpretation , it too is consistent with all tests we made so far . 
   decide what that theory actually says about reality . 
  we may be beholden to take the most fundamental notions of our most fundamental theories as an ontology - realists will , antirealists wo n't care even there - but the ontological baggage of pilot wave is substantially heavier than competing approaches , with the purpose of preserving determinism . 
  which is just a prejudice , not an argument . 
  which just seems worse , since that - existence of such hidden variables - is a substantive ontological claim , but by making them non-local , one is even in principle protected from contact with experiment . 
  plus needs to swallow actual real ftl effects existing in nature for it to work . 
   de broglie-bohm requires fewer axioms than copenhagen , not more . 
  ... and more than many-worlds . 
  ugh `` orthodoxy '' . 
  and dbb is so very hip right ? 
  what a loaded way to frame a perfectly reasonable disagreement . 
  postulating hidden variables not detectable to any experiment , and actual ftl effects that plague pilot wave , just to preserve both realism and determinism , are just what most see as too high a price to pay , and would rather give up on at least one of those . 
  they always claimed to have derived it . 
  latest one is the deutsch-wallace derivation . 
  or that 's the sales pitch anyhow . 
  could you go into more details ? 
  is it like , what one would feel faced with eating dog or insects in some exotic asian cuisine or is it something different ? 
  but you could , honestly , and you could have various reasons . 
  i had a short-lasting identification with buddhism in my mid 20s , though raised catholic , which i stopped being somewhere between the 7th grade of primary school and 1st grade of high school . 
  right ; interesting . 
  i just think you should avoid such emotional terms when explaining this . 
  hm , that is interesting !, 
  well loaded , yes - invokes associations of religious , uncritical adherence to an official creed , where one only finds genuine philosophical disagreement here . 
  and there is no official position , only a most common one . 
  and even there , there was only ever a partial victory for copenhagen , jiving best with the antirealist positivism of the period . 
  oh at such ams , there 'll be plenty of sag . 
  if it were pulling 30a , vtc5 would never get above 3.6 v http://lygte-info.dk/review/batteries2012/sony%20us18650vtc5%202600mah%20%28green%29%20uk.html which fits exactly for .12 . 
  so i guess this is at the very edge of the spec, 
  one caveat here is that if you 're using the fuse , and the fuse is on the + , then it does n't matter which way you put it . 
  if inverse with a damaged wrap , it will just blow a fuse instead of not doing anything . 
  now , if venting were better from the bottom and if battery vented more from its top , this might even make sense . 
  that 's not how it works though , 
  oh , no , feel compassion precisely because they did something in their past life to cause the consequences ripening now ; that cycle is what samsara is all about , and they 're trapped in it , again and again to kill and harm and be killed and harmed etc. . 
  nevermind a genetic defect , the state of anger that pushed you to commit mass murder is ripening of karma from a past life , so is the greed that , thwarted , created conditions conducive to ripening that seed of anger , and the fact of being repeatedly stabbed is ripening of karma from a past life too , prob of stabbing someone or something yourself ( perhaps you slaughtered say a pig ? ),
