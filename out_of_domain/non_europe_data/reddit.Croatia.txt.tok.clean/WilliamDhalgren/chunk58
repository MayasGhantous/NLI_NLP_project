   and even the author said a few years ago :, 
    and if no one sees the pictures , it shows these experiences are illusions or false memories . 
  so they do n't get that result - but neither do they even get obes that put the supposed viewer on a vantage point to see the hidden image ( or so they later claim ) . 
  money wasted , study failed to even achieve its experimental setup in order to test ? 
  so what they offer instead is :, 
    the new ultimate ` objective ' measure for whether a patient had a verifiable out of body experience was , `` an interview ... conducted by the study principal investigator ( pi ) '' , aka dr. sam parnia . 
  so the final , most objective , measure to determine whether a patient 's account represented a true obe , was an interview from a heavily invested researcher , who gives public talks and interviews ( and published a number of books ) arguing that obes are evidence that consciousness is separate from the brain and has spent half a decade running a study to prove that to be the case . 
   there are very simple tests to be done for out of body experiences : put a message on piece of paper on top of a cabinet in the operating room , then ask the revived patient what the message said . 
  apparently they did just that - hid an image one could only possibly see by floating to the ceiling - and as one would expect , got no results http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2inomi/largescale_aware_study_examines_the_human_mind/, 
  but `` sadly '' neither did anyone report having such an experience that would be so falsified ( or so they justify the null result ? ) . 
  money wasted , what to write up about the study ? 
  subjective experiences of the patients ... 
  a simple crack pipe for eg ? 
  hm , is n't it too simplistic to take only wattage and puff duration , rather than things like heat flux per watt , heat capacity of the resistor etc , when measuring temperature ? 
  it would 've been counterproductive to name specific companies when the number is so high . 
  it 's not a matter of individual companies doing bad things , or not doing enough , its a matter of the entire industry doing this wrong . 
  naming the companies that gave those particular 150 sweet-tastes samples he tested would only drive people towards other companies , while it seems practically certain that would not diminish their risks at all . 
  you learned the scale of the problem ; you learned not to trust mere diacetyl-free claims without independent tests or other reasons to additionally trust the manufacturing process ; you learned about the particular concentrations and hence levels of risk when using sweet tastes . 
  far more importantly , both the consumers and the producers learned not to trust the upstream claims without tests , which might push the industry into taking this worry into account better . 
  this study was not designed to be able to recommend juices one should stay away from ; the sample size was far too small ; you 'd need a fairly comprehensive sweep - and really there is no science to be learned from the extra cost of doing that ; its up to the producers to test their stuff . 
  the guy is a researcher into ecig safety , not a regulator . 
  further , the study already focused on what they expected to be the riskiest flavors , rather than trying a bit of everything ; they tested sweet flavors only . 
  you can google for yourself to see what kinds of flavors are likely to be flavored using diacetyl ; such info is nothing new . 
  you can likewise google about the quality of assurances given by any particular producer that their process does n't contain it if you insist on vaping riskier flavors . 
  some link independent tests , though really until a regulator steps in and randomly tests their products , nothing will be particularly resistant to intentional fraud .

  nope , that describes every meson ( by definition ) . 
  prob hundreds are known . 
  first one , the pi meson , was discovered in 1947 . 
  predicted in 1934 . 
  ofc at the time we did n't know they were made of anything more fundamental , like quarks ; rather , the notion there were quarks came from systematizing then already numerous mesons and baryons . 
  when new quarks were being discovered , what would actually get detected were mesons containing new quarks ; charm quark was discovered as the j/psi meson ; bottom quark as the upsilon meson etc. 
  well , top quark was too unstable to even manage to form a meson ... 
  where did you get that ?? 
  kaons are anti-strange plus up or down ; or strange plus anti-up or anti-down . 
  analogous b mesons are a bottom antiquark plus either up , down , strange or charm quark , and vice-versa for anti-b mesons . 
  d meson is a charm quark with up , down or strange antiquark . 
  need n't be the same quark and anti-quark but it does have to be some kind of quark and some kind of anti-quark in a meson . 
  if its 3 quarks , the hadron ( baryon in that case ) can be color-neutral by having a red , green and a blue quark - but with 2 quarks the only way it color-neutral is with a color and its anti-color . 
  which is carried only by antiparticles ( though not necessarily the antiparticle of the same quark ) . 
  hadrons must have zero color charge . 
  mesons consisting of a particle and its antiparticle are also called by the quark in question , adding a suffix - ( o ) nium . 
  so a j/psi meson is charm and anti-charm , hence is also called as charmonium ( as are other charm and anti-charm mesons ; that one is just the first excited state of charmonium ; many others with the same composition are known ) ; upsilon meson is bottom and anti-bottom , hence is also called bottomnium,

  such a sudden change - this is so inspiring to watch . 
  so , are the conservatives going apeshit currnetly ? 
  if so , could you link some of their panicked shit , for schadenfreude ? 
  ha , interesting , so the orange ones are still appealing , but do n't have a stay . 
  still basically the same thing ; difficult to see at this point that any will succeed reverting their current situation through the appeal . 
   `` this result is contrary to my personal beliefs and those of many others , '' he said in a statement . 
  `` as in all matters , i respect the role of the courts and the ruling of the court . 
   `` while this is not the result i and others would have hoped , i recognize people have different points of view and i hope all citizens agree we are bound by the law . '', 
  hm , is that all this article is going on in claiming they wo n't appeal ? 
  does n't sound like it needs to be interpreted that way . 
  they can still be saddened by the decision of the court but have respect for the role of courts and the rule of law , whilst choosing to use all legal means at their disposal to revert this decision within the courts and following the laws . 
  ha , silly me ; missed it skimming the thing . 
  thx for the correction .
