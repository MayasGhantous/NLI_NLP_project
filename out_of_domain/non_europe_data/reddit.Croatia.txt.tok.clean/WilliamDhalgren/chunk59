   but is vaping really better for a developing body ? 
  not to disagree with your overall point , but on is it better - can you doubt it ? 
  than smoking ? 
  how would smoking imaginably be better ? 
  glycerol and water are as safe as anything could possibly be , and anything else is much worse with smoke than with vape - one or two orders of magnitude on any measure you want . 
  have you not seen the relevant scientific literature yet ? 
  but yeah , could still be worse than it would be for an adult . 
  and certainly worse than not vaping . 
  how do they get their gear though ? 
  and in particular , how are they getting their juices ? 
  not the ones you 're saying are being supported by the parents , but you also said its a general trend , and in fairly low grades . 
  diy 0nic would be simple to do i guess ( and least potential of any harm ) , and dirt cheap too , but would they go through the trouble ? 
  would they know how ? 
  i 'm not at all comfortable if any of this is easily accesible to unsupervised kids . 
   my older teens told me their friends parents bought them their vaping gear when they discovered they were smoking tobacco . 
  i am not comfortable with this . 
  thoughts ? 
  hmm idk what to say , heavily depends on the circumstances . 
  if i were a teen smoker , having failed some attemts to quit , and wise enough to weight the evidence and the risks , i 'd choose to vape . 
  if parents did n't support me , i 'd try getting my stuff in secret . 
  today i would n't have any regrets were i to have made such choices as a teen . 
  one thing seems seems proper to me there - parents judging its better their smoker teens start vaping instead , having given up on making them quit otherwise , and choosing the overwhelmingly likely overwhelmingly less harm to their kids . 
  and even if the parents in question are wrong , the general principle seems correct - that its up to the guardians to decide on how to deal with problems of their kids , and that harm reduction strategies in any of these are as legitimate an approach as they generally are - nothing changed with efficacy and fundamental difficulties with age . 
  indeed , like i said this is exactly what i 'd hope an ideal parent would do to me were i a smoking teen failing to quit . 
  and sadly sometimes you wo n't be able to make your kids quit no matter what , just like one sometimes is n't able to make one adult self quit . 
  though this is ofc preferable and first thing to try as a parent . 
  another thing to consider is , were the teens seriously addicted to tobacco , or just had some smokes in hiding here and there ? 
  i 've known quite a few people that smoked a few cigarettes but were n't at any point smokers . 
  it 'd be a shame both to hook a nonaddicted teen to nicotine , and vaping really need n't be the first way to attempt to quit for a new smoker . 
  i was amazed few days ago when my friend told me she started smoking at 8 . 
  not a cigarette here or there , but a proper smoker , maybe not pad but a fair portion of a pack nevertheless . 
  warning : i 'm writing this in a fairly overly-honest way , freely allowing myself to make presumptions based on limited impressions one can get from one-way textual encounter with a person and their situation . 
  please do n't get offended ( and hopefully it wo n't depress you any further ) . 
  it was a dilemma of giving polite generic advice , not my strong suit , and others seem to have done this anyhow , or to try at a kind of relaxed humor at life and human striving , importance . 
   i also have asperger syndrome . 
  well , then i have good news - not anymore !, 
  since 2013 fifth edition of the dsm , asperger syndrome does n't exist . 
  now you have autism spectrum disorder of some level of severity . 
   the trouble started back in february . 
  i had been a member of an ** online manga forum ** for almost two years at that point . 
  i saw the forum as a mostly safe place , and i had met several other trans women there , who i considered my friends ... and ** i had been permanently banned from nearly every other forum i had been a part of ** , so this manga forum was almost like a home for me . 
  huh , well how the hell did you manage to do that ? 
   in february , i was ** voted queen of the forums ** , which was something i had hoped to achieve for a long time , something to prove that i was just as good as the best cis women on the site . 
  ** i had been a bit scared ** that my friend elaine , another trans woman who i had met on the site , ** would win ** . 
  about a month prior , ** she had been `` seniored '' ** on the forum , something that she accomplished in less than a year when i had been ** unable to secure senior membership ** in a full two years of speaking out about trans issues ... 
  i 'm confused , we 're speaking about a certain online manga forum here ? 
  does n't this seem like an excessive amount of social competitiveness over honorary pronouncements on a forum ? 
  i 'm admittedly prone to spending an inordinate amount of time online myself , but jeez ... 
  is n't having responsibilities on a forum more like `` damn , someone 'll have to do this or the place will go to hell , and i 've been around since forever , and could , so ... '' rather than `` uh , if only i could get an op , so i 'm be sure i 'm well liked and important ... '' . 
  is n't the point of the forum to provide the possibility to communicate with people , a possibility granted to all members , and not to sustain one 's fragile ego with awards and positions , confirming you 're liked and worthy ? 
  you can still do anything worth doing for your convictions on an online forum , junior and uncrowned , or not , so why fret ? 
  not to be unfair to you , i 'd think its common and quite normal for teens to be in such need and with such insecurities . 
   around that time , i called out jared leto, 
  think i 've head of the name . 
  forgive me i wo n't be able to follow this bit ; i 'm on a different continent , and fairly disinterested in ( what could he be ) tv ? 
   of course , parker malloy did that for me , but therein lies the problem does n't it ? 
  meh , as long as whatever happened got cleared up by whoever with whoever else , should n't really matter who said what to whom . 
  you started this post with :, 
   i have wanted nothing more than to advocate for the trans community , and i always figured that i would end up turning that into a career somehow . 
  i know that sounds silly now , but i really thought that i was fully capable of becoming an author , a screenwriter , an actress , a model , something with high visibility that would better allow me to help the trans community . 
  ... its a bit unclear what 's the means and what 's the ends here . 
  if your desire is activism in a social cause , surely the right motivation is - the social cause in question . 
  whatever you happen to contribute to it or not as secondary to having the cause be succesfull ? 
  then how could it possibly matter who corrected whom if the deed got done one way or another ? 
   i got into a fight with some of the people on there . 
  it started with me ** criticizing the pope ** and other pseudo-liberal heroes , but nobody really understood what i was getting at , so i got more and more frustrated . 
  i was also ** a bit paranoid , ** as always , and ** perceived personal attacks where there were none . 
  ah , so in other words , the good old internet flaming , those are the best of days !, 
  :p well it 's never easy to debate things in a civil manner online ( and sometimes its just not fun to do so either :p ) , takes lots of practice , and still fails often enough . 
   in the end , i was permanently banned from the site . 
  ugh , wait , what ? 
  again - how the hell did you manage to do that ? 
  heh , must 've been some glorious flaming !, 
   i was still elated about the jared leto thing and some of the ** opportunities that had cropped up as a result ** , so i did n't dwell on it much back then . 
  besides , one of the other members of the forum started to show interest in me , and we started dating some time afterwards . 
  spilling words only to produce a lot of heat is always a cause for some reexamination though . 
  and opportunities or not , bans left and right should give one pause . 
  at least as indicating not using online communitations particularly effectively . 
   in the months that followed , i did do some cool trans-related things . 
  i went to see laverne cox speak in san francisco , and i got to go to the reception afterwards . 
  i went down to la to meet up with some folks from trans hollywood , who had invited me there . 
  and i went to the trans leadership conference at northridge . 
  fun !, 
  and think , you 're only 19 !, 
   it struck me that i had failed on ap forums . 
  that 's the manga forum again ? 
  well , yeah , prob . 
   < some random names  had succeeded where i had failed , in successfully communicating with cis people . 
  they could still advocate for trans rights where i could not , they had allies where i did not , all because of my stupid mistake . 
  the mistake here would be - arguing with people over the motherfucking pope ? 
  idk apologies seem appropriate if you really went overboard in the argument , somehow . 
  not so appropriate if this was a reflection of a lack of pluralism on the place . 
  but begging admins to be let back in if they 're disinclined - hm , can it be worth it ; the internet 's a big place , and most of it is a bit toxic . 
  as in - random drama , occasional authoritarian tendencies of mods , personal dynamics can become heated if too much familiarity is encouraged ( using real identities , random banter etc ) and possibly abrasive etc. 
  you can just as well calk this one up as a learning experience and move on . 
   realizing that i would flunk a course when i had already flunked all my courses the last two times i had attempted college , and knowing that p and the others had beaten me , i decided to kill myself by jumping in front of a train . 
  wow that escalated quickly . 
  jumping in front of a train because you were overcompetitive and insecure , and because you flunked . 
  far too unstable , you should ask for psychological help .
