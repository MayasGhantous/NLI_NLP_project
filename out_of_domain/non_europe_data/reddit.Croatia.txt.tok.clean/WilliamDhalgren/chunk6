  oh , then a clarification , do you mean being subscribed for one year or more consecutively or overall ? 
  one could 've unsubscribed some time ago after having been a regular for a long while , if he subscribes again shortly before the vote , not sure if he 's eligible or not . 
  but that 's pure speculation . 
  i 'm not even sure new planck data supports it or not . 
  but , cosmic variance makes conclusions about statistical features of the universe on the largest scales quite uncertain afaik, 
  uh , a lot of it , for eg , bach 's st matthew passion . 
  because its a f * brilliant composition . 
  i do n't really mind his inspiration being religious . 
  are gothic cathedrals any less impressive for that , for eg ? 
  wtf do you imagine dark matter has to do with it ? 
  if dark matter is a wimp as most suspect , its just a fundamental particle like any other , much like neutrinos except heavier , and created in the process of the early evolution of the universe like everything else . 
  it 's not nothing by any standards , and i do n't see what you are trying to imply . 
  beyond adding to the `` all explanations need to stop at some point - whatever extra we postulate as to why is open to the same question '' and `` we do n't know '' and `` why not - why would nothing be the default - there is no such thing in the known laws of nature '' , i find this little tidbit of science re the origin of `` stuff '' interesting . 
  for the more philosophical concept of nothing , ie `` but why even physics '' , see above , this is about the more mundane question , but i think its interesting how it does away with the intuition that 's i think behind posing this question . 
  it also shows , how extra new `` stuff '' comming into existence is not something that happened some billions of years ago and we 're now puzzled how , but rather , is happening constantly , as we speak !, 
  we have this cherished notion that stuff does n't simply arise . 
  existing stuff transforms from one form to another , but stuff like conservation of energy , would imply that stuff can not just pop into existence . 
  well , i was watching a ttc lectures on dark matter and dark energy , and as a sideline , he explained an interesting thing ( i think ) . 
  in quantum physics , and in classical physics , conservation of energy is indeed valid . 
  now this is n't merely a premise one needs to accept for the physics to work out . 
  rather , many conservation laws have their origin in some fundamental symmetries of nature . 
  this is called the [ noether 's theorem ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noether%27s_theorem ), 
  and so does conservation of energy . 
  specifically , it is linked to the time-translation invariance ( i think , or some such time-related symmetry ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conservation_of_energy#noether.27s_theorem . 
  now this symmetry need n't hold for every theory of physics . 
  and indeed , as you can see in the following section on relativity ,, 
   the theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe . 
  now , the lecturer in question has put it much more strongly ( maybe this has something to do with what we imagine the `` entire universe '' to be , since it need n't be - and given inflation ca n't be - just the observable universe , which is what seems to be what the lecturer had in mind ) - given cosmology , its quite impossible for the laws of nature to conserve energy for the entire universe , because we live in an expanding universe . 
  this is quite evident given dark energy - constant in every point of space , while space expands , so total energy need grow . 
  but this would be true even without it ( in the opposite direction , the universe losing energy ) - because energy density falls quickly as the universe expands , there being both less photons and they 're redshifting . 
  now somehow , ppl are less upset about learning that the universe may be losing energy , then when we 've learned universe constantly has more energy . 
  there is no formal difference though , both invalidate conservation of energy in general relativity or just its instantiation in modern cosmology , so this is no more than our philosophical prejudice . 
  now , inflation , which while it has some experimental support ( esp w the new planck data ) , is n't quite considered a proven fact , is taken to do be much like dark energy ( only much more concentrated ) , and the decay of this energy ( so called reheating ) into `` normal '' particles is the origin of all the `` something '' . 
  and it also blows up what can be a planckian patch of space ( something quantum physics would allow arising just as a random fluctuation ) into much much more than our visible universe . 
  so it is pretty much our best scientific guess at how everything originated . 
  except the very laws of physics themselves ofc . 
  tldr `` something '' becoming happens all the time , as we speak , its only a classical physics and philosophical prejudice that it should n't, 
  hm , well there 's a lot of `` negativity '' to share here , apart from reasoning why religious claims do n't stand up to scrutiny - like being bullied by parents or discriminated at work or other situations , unjust governments marginalizing atheists or even persecuting them . . 
  its a part of life of an opressed minority , just check / r/lgbt and you 'll see much of similar type of content . 
  its still fairly important to people that have to suffer all that . 
  but maybe you 're equivocating a bit here , not sure what `` a negative thing by default '' is supposed to imply ? 
   an eastern viewpoint would view religion as more of a metaphor for becoming enlightened or free from our minds . 
  some reputable scientific studies claiming this would be welcome . 
  that most certainly is n't alan watts or youtube videos . 
  i did n't find abhidharmakosa metaphorical at all , but a typical theological work . . 
  strangle all the priests ? 
  come on , i do n't fully disagree , but this is n't helpful at all . 
  instead of cooling down to sanely discuss matters , you 're just adding more fuel to the now fairly raging fire . 
  and this smells of straw manning the opposition to the change . 
  like there is n't enough posts pro or contra the changes swarming / new that do little more than voice their opinion ... 
  and , everything new has been apparently blocked by indiscriminate rage downvotes . 
  well , downvoting content you 're just personally not interested in is certainly wrong , in contradiction with just general reddiquette . 
  so is organizing mass upvote/downvote campaigns . 
  you 're also supposed to read the content before voting . 
   s between identical twins were typically double those for fraternal twins , a finding suggesting that genetic factors account for approximately ** half of the observed variance ** in their measures of religious beliefs . 
  half of the variance , quite a strong effect . 
  still , its hardly news that many people are so attached to their beliefs that they just wo n't lose them . 
  i am however puzzled at how this works across countries - is the incidence of the gene less in say nordic countries or japan ? 
  or does it express different behavioral traits ? 
   why are n't you telling them to ignore content they 're `` not personally interested in '' . 
  i 'm not telling anyone anything , just made two uncontroversial statements of fact ? 
  or am i supposed to be fuming about whether some forum online is moderated one way or another like you seem to be ? 
  to spell it out , not believing in the existence of gods and believing belief in a god is harmful are quite orthogonal . 
  one is one 's position on whether god is real , and another about the effects of believing so on humanity . 
  its amazing you can comment on a sentence twice w/o reading it , ** downvoting ** a content you 're not interested in is against rediquette . 
  moderation , including censorship of pretty much anything the mods wants to censor , is not . 
  it is practiced on subs generally ( most of which just ban completely imageposts or whole subclasses of imageposts ) . 
  it can still be a wrong choice for a particular sub , that 's again a different matter . 
  and, 
   those who think their opinion of content is superior to the opinions, 
  is just your strawman , but whatever , you seem far too worked up about this to have more than insults and downvotes to contribute ... 
  i was discussing rediquette , not my opinion on the changes , and certainly not on the way they were implemented ??!!, 
  and only interpreted actual facts about the rules , when prompted explicitly . 
  and actually do disapprove of how these changes were instituted . 
  but actually , am nevertheless elitist/technocratic on many matters . 
  has a gnostic ring to it , many directions of it believed an evil demiurge created everything , not god . 
  maybe she 's a heretic ? 
  in that being pissed at a mod on some sub is not a great excuse for violating reddit 's general rules , and in that they actually are n't forced or obliged to give a shit of what you or the majority thinks , yes . 
  but more to the point , simply because someone asked is there actually something wrong in mass downvoting , or downvoting w/o reading . 
  and since so many use the upvote/downvote system incorrectly unknowingly , thought it might be interesting for them to find out about their intended use . 
  and what is n't . 
  but let 's not by any chance allow anything distracts us from this fascinating drama i never even mentioned but you keep pushing into the discussion / s, 
  this looks fascinating , thx !, 
  or , disbelief as your `` belief '' ? 
  and no thumbs ... 
  well , you can get the truly unfiltered view of the content as it comes in / new also . 
  presuming the poster of the image bothers making it a self post that is, 
   i can see how religion might help someone with understanding morality . 
  hm , that 's one thing that seems to me religion gets wrong on the big matters fairly frequently . 
  and is `` because x says so '' really a satisfactory answer to you on ethical questions ? 
  i find considerations of morality that do n't depend on an adhoc and diverse set of rules deeper ( more consistent , more malleable to facts about the situation being taken properly into account in reaching the conclusion ), 
   but sometimes it does feel like there is something out there . 
  is it ignorant to believe in such things ? 
  well , i just do n't think it is well justified to believe in assertions that have n't been rigorously proven , esp when they 're as overreaching and often incongruous with the things we do know . 
  not sure why for eg, 
   it makes things seem more significant to think that there is something bigger out there ,, 
  would even enter into consideration of whether a claim is actually true or not ? 
  to take an example , believing as many cultures did , that one 's rituals sustained the rising of the sun at dawn gives one great significance , but how is that an argument as to its truth ? 
  well , i 'd like to help , but goodness , how could i ?
