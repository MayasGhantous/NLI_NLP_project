  now , i do n't necessarily agree - i think whatever you do as a private citizen is your own business . 
  but when you operate as a business , yeah the state can impose reasonable conditions on how you can operate . 
  otherwise one may easily be forced to jump through some serious hoops , in comparison to a non-disprivileged person , to find a place where one might even be able to spend his or her money just because there 's a high concentration of bigots around . 
  i 'd rather impose on the bigots and force them to do what they rather would n't if they wan na continue to be able to earn money doing it instead . 
  but whatever , that 's academic to this case .

  right , certainly a sensible position , even if i 'd disagree . 
  its just that whatever would or would n't be a better legal framework to have , this particular lawsuit will be held under the laws they in fact do have . 
  so it better make the best sense of the law as it is . 
  and it is n't even particularly difficult in this case .

   clearly you 've never read the actual bible . 
  and that book 's claims are supposed to be the definitive pronouncement on what being a christian need mean ? 
  how very protestant of you . 
  ` tis just an anthology of writings by various groups of the periods in question , shaped by cultural and historical happenings of the times as well as attitudes of the guys ( surely its guys ) writing them . 
  you might find various contemporary christians fairly open to the historical criticism of the texts contained in that selection of literature from the period . 
  not that i find much point in sifting through what i see as mostly iron age superstitions , but still one should recognize not all who do find it inspirational are quite that limited in their interpretative strategies ( though admittedly many are ) . 
   intermarry , they can not possibly have any progeny, 
  wait , what ? 
  when was this ? 
  i understand rationalizations can often be quite thin and transparent , but how could they have possibly believed that ? 
  surely there was no lack of cases of say black servants birthing master 's children etc ? 
  was this really believed at any point in time ? 
  so , did you lower the nic intake gradually , or what exactly was your strategy ? 
  i 've been doing it very gradually , got to using some 1-2mg nic juice at say 3ml a day , ( and plan to lower wattage as i continue ) yet still feel moderately far from being able to comfortably completely ditch it . 
  as i understand it , with this particular library chances are any random scroll is another work by the epicurean philosopher philodemus :-(, 
  banning snus would be even less scientifically justified than banning ecigs , since there we do have stats on long-term effects with a large population , and it looks quite decent - apart from looking fairly good `` on paper '' ie in the lab . 
  its unlikely but imaginable that given similar data ecigs might be found to be actually problematic . 
  but these are n't supernovae - they are brief and rare - but apparently young supernova remnants . 
  ufff . 
  my point is that, 
   godawful ** high temps created by supernovae create ** ultra-energetic electromagnetic energies, 
  is true yet totally unrelated to the phenomena under discussion , for we 're seeing ultra-energetic electromagnetic energies ** now ** and the supernova is long gone . 
  the high temperatures ** right now ** , the dectection of which is under discussion here , are not being `` created by supernovae '' but by the highly energetic young pulsars that remain there !, 
  right ; what odd dissonance between the text and the menu, 
  ... and surely only old men are eligible . 
  as to the fetuses part , well i guess it makes sense , in their framework . 
  i mean , where else are they supposed to go since they have n't been baptized ? 
  did n't the catholics used to put them in limbo , which is technically a part of hell , ie the mildest one ? 
  and that now they speculate perhaps they can go to purgatory and eventually find heaven , which seems just as silly ? 
  anyhow , this is an interesting piece of reasoning :, 
   ( conversely , one could argue that if all babies go to heaven , then abortion is the best gift for a baby because in killing the child , you send him to immediate heaven without giving him an opportunity to grow up and possibly reject the gospel in the future . 
  discounting the baby part , this is basically the plot of a story by borges . 
  i 'm unsure how to find its title right now , without a visit to the library . 
  from memory its something like this - a priest takes shelter at a home of very religious folk . 
  they examine his morals and the like in detail and conclude that , were he killed now , surely he 'd go to heaven . 
  since who knows what the future would bring , they kill him then and there . 
  of course , murder is a deadly sin , but they 're willing , out of compassion , to take eternal damnation upon themselves to ensure the passage of another to heaven . 
  he had a similar analysis of the character of judas as a savior choosing to go to hell for the greater good , in different works , though i guess those have gnostic precursors . 
  anyhow , i thought the story demonstrated how unworkable it is to base one 's ethics merely on fear of punishment as religious folks tend to , so i love to see them actually following the same train of thought . 
  i see , sry , that never works online if unmarked .

  afaik they sterilize the males by irradiation , not genetic engineering . 
  have been for decades . 
  the novelty w gmo would be not to have to irradiate them , since that makes them sick and hence worse competitors for mates , and easier to breed and to select an all-male population . 
  they do n't make them sterile , but make them dependent on an antibiotic to develop . 
  so that 's easy to breed , just add it to their diets while making your swarms . 
  and they add some female-specific kill switch of similar kind to leave out just the males - which used to be quite difficult a step . 
   actually the irradiation is a less common practice for sterilizing mosquitoes . 
  general irradiation has a tendency to weaken an entire organism ( as well as make them sterile ) . 
  weakened males do n't compete as well as healthy males resulting in less sterile males mating , and a less effective method . 
  right , that 's what i meant by :, 
    the novelty w gmo would be not to have to irradiate them , since that makes them sick and hence worse competitors for mates, 
  but still i thought ge did n't make mosquitoes sterile , but ones who had ( and hence whose offspring had ) a dominant lethal gene , suppressible by an additive . 
  how is this different from programing yeast or e. coli to manufacture insulin and the like , as we currently do ? 
  so , gmo humans with the mitochondrial dna migrated into the nucleus ? 
  hmm , seems to me the few decades humans live is a joke really . 
  millennia at least seem a more appropriate timescale . 
  time enough to see humanity 's projects - like physics or globalization - come to some fruition , time enough to visit at least the closest stellar neighbors etc. 
  but sure , one should just off oneself when overly bored , or if living in sustained discomfort .

  ofc . 
   also what about moving to uk ? 
  unless some shit ( ie brexit ) goes down in the upcomming elections , as an eu citizen you have the legal right to move to the uk and seek employment there . 
  3 months time to seek employment at least is guaranteed . 
  should be no more complicated than buying a ticket and renting a room or whatever you 'd do at home . 
  for those 3 months , no particular registration or the like is needed , i think . 
  there 's also the eures portal , precisely in order to seek cross-border eu employment . 
  should be getting an upgrade soon ; the new commission wants to see more worker mobility . .
