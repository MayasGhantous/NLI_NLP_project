  how do you know that if you 're still waiting for their reply ? 
  few ppl , including myself thought this might be what 's happening ? 
  did some automated mail come to you or ? 
  he does know of the posts . 
  or method at least , he commented in the thread where arrow74 announced it ( with an applause pic http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1fyzqh/i_found_a_great_loophole/caf5znt ) . 
  and posts did go missing from new . 
  now idk if it was due to reports/spamfilters or explicit moderator action . 
   when you break it down , either in the beginning there was god , or in the beginning there was matter . 
  our best , provable , testable idea on what `` beginning '' was like is cosmology . 
  which does n't postulate a god , it serves no function in deriving its predictions . 
  now if you take a theory , any theory , and add and extra premise to it ( like , `` and before this , there was god who created it all '' ) , you better also get a more precise prediction from it . 
  otherwise , you 've only added one more way your theory can be wrong - namely , that everything about it is right , except that premise . 
  with the god premise , you can derive no additional predictions , let alone test if they 're false . 
  so it is strictly less likely that believing in cosmology plus that god created it all is correct , than just believing in cosmology as it stands . 
  i 'm just stating the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occam%27s_razor in a way that 's hopefully compelling . 
  so its not so much that i 'd consider a god impossible , as a belief in a god unjustified by evidence . 
  and why would one believe in stuff without sufficient evidence ? 
  edit : another way of putting it would be , if something about say the origins of the universe has n't been proven by science to be the case , this has already considered all the reliable evidence on the issue and was n't compelled to make such a conclusion , then on what grounds would we accept it as nevertheless true ? 
  huh . 
  well you can reason with him , maybe pointing out that you have a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_thought and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_religion and that in light of these his imposition of his view against your explicit opposition is unreasonable and way beyond what a parent ought to require from his child as a condition to have basic material support from him . 
  or some such argument . 
  otoh , if this fails , would living with your mum be such a bad option ? 
  perhaps calling him out in not so polite tones on his oppressive conditions for his love and support , disassociating with him or threatening to do so would either call his bluff or shake some sense into him ? 
  maybe its not such a bad thing to drift apart from him if this is how he intends to treat you . 
  why give up immediately on their first day of addressing the issue though ? 
  it may take some moments and some opposition for the father to realize the extent of his imposition . 
   if you are under 18 and you live in his house then he has all the right to tell you what to do . 
  he may be able to do so , but does he have the right ? 
  european convention on human rights which is applicable to the netherlands states :, 
  everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom , either alone or in community with others and in public or private , and to manifest his religion or belief , in worship , teaching , practice and observance . 
  edit : father 's right to impose his beliefs in this case could also be dubious given that the child has two parents of differing religious convictions . 
  anyhow he just needs to be able to make such an argument :d, 
  i 'd suggest you put up some fight against it then . 
  not necessarily to the point of burning your bridges , but this sounds fresh ( confrontation i mean ) , perhaps further reasoning with him is worth a try . 
  idk , apparently many have been in such a situation and would n't see a big deal in having to go to church . 
  i really could n't have tolerated something like that from my mum ( in croatia , and goodness , i 'd really have expected dutch standards in such matters much better - but i guess there 's always exceptions ) , though she is very religious , since say entering the high school and having a clear notion of not being religious . 
  same with political attitudes , would you need to support his party as well ? 
  well the quote i gave specifies how freedom of religion does not only mean freedom of conscience , but includes communal and private expressions , practices , worship , observances thereof . 
  if it was just a matter of sitting in a room , then the parents would have little reason to object if the child was made to go into a mosque or a buddhist temple once a week as well , presuming the father is christian . 
  state would n't say it needs to believe in those religions , of course , just to sit in that room . 
  while clearly this would be an outrage . 
  look idk , i was in a family where my views on many matters , philosophical or political , differed from my parent 's ones from early on , and i certainly would consider this totally unacceptable . 
  had my mom apologizing for some passing tantrum on reading an anarchist book in high-school for eg ( she 'd wish to tell me what i 'm to read ?? ) . 
  so at least i can see how the extent to which this may bother him/her is purely subjective . 
  and apparently it bothers him/her . 
  i guess i 'm just surprised the us does n't have more than 5 multi-million cities . 
   they told me the laws of thermodynamics proves gods existence . 
  first of all , then god would be a fact , part of a physical theory . 
  physicists would invariably believe in god , just as they do in laws of thermodynamics . 
  yet if you look at the belief statistics among physicists , say in the academy of science , number if believers is in the single digits and falling with time . 
  maybe you can ridicule them for claiming science proves god , yet scientists , knowing the supposed evidence , overwhelmingly do n't believe it ? 
  they might mean that complexity such as displayed by life is incompatible with the 2nd law of thermodynamics , which states that the entropy of a closed system always increases with time . 
  if that 's their argument , they really do n't know much about science they quote . 
  prob just some distilled propaganda versions they wanted to hear . 
  complex organisms are states of very low entropy . 
  yet entropy has been higher in the past , say when this space was just a ball of collapsing gas . 
  this argument , if that 's what it is , is immediately incorrect , for the conclusion is valid for a closed system only . 
  and organisms are certainly anything but . 
  they need to metabolize to grow , dissipating energy in a high entropy form like heat , they exchange matter with their surroundings etc. 
  and this is true for earth and the planets in their totality . 
   morality is n't a darwinian thing , its a religious thing , and thus proves god exist . 
  hm , there are good adaptive reasons for animals to adopt what we 'd consider moral behavior ( presuming your family is aiming at evolution of altruism here ) . 
  it is seen in various animals , and even very specific non-obvious moral judgements ( eg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trolley_problem ) give consistent responses across cultures , regardless of religions of the participants . 
  so first , basic human ethical behavior existing is consistent with buddhism ( which is basically atheist , or rather somewhat indifferent to deities ) , or animist or humanist ideas as theists . 
  regarding how it might be adaptive behavior to behave altruistically , and hence for this to be selected for during natural selection of social animals , an interesting model is the tit-for-tat strategy . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tit_for_tat . 
  it is a largely cooperative approach to acting in a situation called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prisoner%27s_dilemma#the_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma , a game with two players , where each side will do better if it betrayes the other , either by winning more ( if the other cooperates ) , or losing less ( if both betray ) . 
  but if both are betraying each other , they 'll do worse than if they both cooperated . 
  anyhow , the point is that a fairly goodnatured approach to playing it is dominant - starting off cooperative , and then just doing whatever the other person did last turn . 
  so trust another at first , are quick to retaliate if slighted , proportional in your retaliation to the slight , and quick to forgive . 
  presuming just you 'll prosper with your group better if ppl work together in the community ( even if each could possibly benefit from cheating the others ), 
  here 's dawkins about evolution of altruism and an overview of these ideas , in `` nice guys finish first '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i71mjzefg8g , an oldish documentary . 
  bo , that translates to , life ca n't find enough food to eat ? 
  obviously it can , now it uses photosysthesis to tap into the wast energy input comming from the sun , and its fusion reaction . 
  and when it was starting out , who knows , but presumably early earth 's oceans were filled with organic moleculs that simple organisms could eat . 
  does n't make much sense . 
  i think its more handwavey than that - just that somehow chaos is supposed to be always increasing in that misinterpretation of the laws of theirs , yet look at life developing such order and complexity in its delicate structure . 
  another gay atheist here, 
   that all lgbt rights issues are inherently issues for atheists, 
  hm , maybe chinese lgbt rights are n't deemed a problem relating to atheism , if this is n't a confucian/buddhist thing , but the communist regime ? 
  though then again , precisely this - atheists against lgbt rights seems a topic relevant to atheism . 
  maybe the argument is that this would have little to do with their stance on the existence or not of gods , but on political conviction in this case . 
  maybe . 
  lets just see some lgbt rights content being rejected and the reasoning behind it , or find some clarification , example of an offtopic lgbt rights matter before making the conclusion ? 
  since it was n't stated that lgbt rights issues are outright offtopic , i 'd give this the benefit of the doubt . 
   sexual preference has nothing to do with atheism, 
  agreed . 
  but as far as i can see , rules and he were speaking about lgbt ** rights ** issues . 
  and you know the argument - opposition to equality is overwhelmingly driven by religions , ie both by beliefs and by large religious institutions . 
  do you disagree ? 
  yeah , seems like it could be possible in principle . 
  but having trouble thinking of an example which was still lgbt ** rights ** related . 
  i have n't slept in a while now , help me out plz ? 
  nonono , you have me backwards ( in a nonsexual way ) . 
  i meant , while there 's certainly lgbt ** news ** that are offtopic , lgbt ** rights ** seem to me overwhelmingly opposed by religions . 
  i ca n't quite then think of a good example where those ** do n't ** relate to atheism then . 
  i do n't think the point is in how much atheists and lgbt experiences of discrimination are similar . 
  but how discrimination of lgbt folk is basically a crime being perpetrated before our eyes in the name of superstitions bullshit ? 
  like `` country x votes in a kill the gays bill '' , invariably a story of religiously inspired , state sanctioned persecution and/or murder , is analogous to say `` turkish girl burned alive for talking to boys '' on the current front , or `` at the urging of the catholic church abortion in latin america is banned in all cases '', 
  and i 've gotten clarifications that no rules on this have actually been changed .
