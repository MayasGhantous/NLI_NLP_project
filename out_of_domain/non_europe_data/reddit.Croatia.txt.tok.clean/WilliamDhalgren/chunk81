  yet the plot is driven by him trying to own horo by crashing a market . 
  a goal as disgusting as it is futile . 
  yet continues to get respect with anyone he interacts with and suggests his intentions to . '' ), 
  its sadly so often the case that the way these japanese authors depict romantic behavior seems usually appalling and disgusting to me . 
  few exceptions i 've seen yet are the crescent/banner of the stars , which is so adorable , and kids on the slope . 
  looks like a toxic cocktail of anger , sadness and jealously , expressed in on-screen pointless jelling , pathetic weeping and inexcusable aggression , and i do n't get why any leads would drink that poison . 
  second half of the second season seems to be making up for this in the wit department , the economics plot is more enjoyable , and art and music and food continue to contribute to great wordlbuilding . 
  so 8/10 for s1 , 6/10 for s2 . 
  [ gunbuster ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/949/top_wo_nerae!_gunbuster ), 
  as someone who had endless disappointments with stuff marked shounen up to this point , this was one great positive surprise . 
  the story is straightforward , but quite hard sf . 
  it does require changes to physics , and makes these changes not randomly but by plausibly depicting the development of the field . 
  it 's so amazingly rare to see that done right in hard sf . 
  as a subgenre it usually needs to either stay within known physics or the transition requires quite a big suspension of disbelief . 
  not nearly so bad here however . 
  the technobabble portion it gave about it was so great ( still babble mind you , but so well done ) , because much of it was about actually relevant parts of physics and with the right vocabulary . 
  [ ] ( / s `` for eg , it defined bosons and fermions correctly ( and i was about to jump at it with \\ `` but this is obvious , no brilliant physicist would need to spend a sentence on this in a scientific paper \\ '' - but then it turns out the sentence is from a highschool paper , which is quite appropriate ) , it namedropped for eg , yangs-mill gauge theories etc. 
  it did n't use whatever for ftl but rather it described kerr black holes . '' ), 
  so its a history-of-science hard-sf moment done amazingly right . 
  [ ] ( / s `` temporal dilatation having prominent role in the story is another huge props '' ), 
  i guess i should rave about this for quite some time . 
  how noriko is a great lead , especially for a female character depiction that can easily go so terribly wrong , how unique it is to see some time given to the effort needed to even manage to control a mecha well , how amazingly gunbuster looks etc. 
  but this has been long enough already and beyond maybe my technobabble rant has all been said before quite often . 
  really my 8 , 9 , 10 and favs are a mess , until i rewatch them all the differences mean little . 
  i 'm a bit tired from writing the last two , so i 'll keep this brief - pedestrian story , but with well-made dialogues . 
  however , soooo gorgeous !, 
  imagination that drips from every frame is in quite a different league . 
  [ ghost in a shell - stand alone complex ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/ghost_in_the_shell:_stand_alone_complex ) both seasons and, 
  [ ghost in a shell - stand alone complex - solid state society ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/1566/ghost_in_the_shell:_stand_alone_complex_-_solid_state_society ), 
  ahh , yes , this is cyberpunk done so right . 
  tachikoma moments in the first season were a bit irritating , and the setup in the first season was of slightly less socially relevant variety , so i 've provisionally given the first season 8 while the film and especially the second season sit on a 9 . 
  but subject to change for sure . 
  gritty realism , power plays and politics , a realistic art-style that matches it , a storyline mirroring real world issues -- i can clearly see this is being done by the same director as the great `` eden of the east '' in these aspects , only with an even stronger premise -- , a rather well-done early take on 2d and 3d blending , though not quite seamless , still one of the better ones i 've seen , stellar music - one of those shows where you do n't often even skip the opening theme . . 
  this is how a well-rounded anime of top quality feels like , with no glaring flaws to the masterpiece . 
  [ ghost in a shell - arise ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/17187/ghost_in_the_shell:_arise_-_border:1_ghost_pain ) and on . 
  i hate how i ca n't group series in mal . 
  on the other hand , this offers nothing but good looking cg . 
  if this were a live-action show , i 'd be raving how amazing a solid piece of cyberpunk is . 
  given the competition in anime however , the pedestrian if occasionally solid story barely raises it above average . 
  [ rose of versailles ] ( http://myanimelist.net/anime/338/rose_of_versailles ), 
  i 'm still going through this one , and it seems quite great . 
  provisionally a 9/10 . 
  i do have a bit of a problem with [ ] ( / s `` oscar defeating so many foes at the start , and how court intrigue suspiciously resembles schoolyard intrigue - though maybe this is not incorrect either . 
  however correct implications to world peace from it are quickly drawn so it immediately rises above the possible triviality , '' ) its take on marie antoinette is quite promising . 
  animation has certainly stood the test of quite a lot of time . 
  interesting detail [ ] ( / s `` with that blotch on the marriage certificate . 
  i remember gankutsuou speaking about that historic blotch as a bad omen well . 
  wonder if the storyboarder there remembered rose of versailles and subtly referenced it , or is that minor history detail just generally popular in japan , as a kind of bad omen for the rule . '' ), 
  since it was not something mentioned in my history lessons for sure , though it is true . 
  third movie wraps it up a bit more ( you can just jump into it , plotline of the movie series is otherwise the same ) , basically an episode worth of extra narration bridging that ending and where the first episode started ( and a little bit of setup earlier in the same film ) , but it still quite chaotic . 
  i don ' think the series would work at all [ spoilers to someone who did n't watch the series ] ( / s `` as the dark tragedy about the world of daemons it was hinting itself to be without all the rape and murder of the end though . '' ), 
  limbs getting cut in ~ ~ the first moments of ~ ~ the film would make it rather inappropriate for children by western standards even . 
  actually i 'm having trouble finding the offending scenes right now , so maybe i 'm wrong ? 
  but i did n't pull that out of my ass either - thought its been ages since a rewatch , i was parroting something said in a lecture recently linked here , by jonathan clements - wrong about anime ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bevpfbmodig around 37min ) - i guess he 's exaggerating but the claim was two hands get chopped off at the beginning . 
  in the first fight if anything the two arrows to the eyes were more visceral than the touch of that corruptive thingy to his arm . 
  and i did n't see something getting cut off , though i do n't want to do a rewatch right now just for this comment either so i was skipping , and only watched the first minutes properly . 
  or is some other situation in question ? 
  anyhow , i do n't think its inappropriate at all , if anything the parental guidance in the west is far too pampered . 
  but his claim was that western industry standards might almost perceive it as such . 
  frankly its all suspension of disbelief by the time the only way for them to read some data for ibm 5100 is by finding an actual working physical ibm 5100 ... 
  yeah that ; s got ta be the one . 
  clemens said in the first 5 min so i figured it had to be the boar fight . 
  thx for tracking that down . 
  is there any place where we can see all 4 groups ? 
  i possibly missed some of them ? 
  even if the voting is closed , i 'd like to see which ones i did and which ones i missed . 
  hm , but i did see that entire list . 
  i was wondering rather if one could see the previous groups . 
  possibly with one 's votes as well . 
  i see , thx . 
  somewhat skewed , sure . 
  but here we have a wall of people claiming they 'd only give less than 5 to shows that were terrible . 
  that 's just waaaay skewed . 
  4 should still be an enjoyable show , just one you find a below your notion of average . 
  as you watch more and more anime , you should expect a greater and greater portion of them should be in the 4-6 range . 
  if you were watching anime randomly , only then would it make sense for 5 to be your personal average . 
  so your 5 is what you imagine an average anime would feel like . 
  if you 're scouting to any extent , probably what you watched is higher than average in average . 
  the more you scout and the less you 've seen , you 'd deviate to a greater extent . 
  people with really big lists should see their personal averages drop towards the 4-6 range as their lists expand . 
  yeah , sounds high-ish : possibly what you call a 5 is better suited to a 4 , description of your 6 could be a 5 . . 
  its a needless compression of the grades , that 's all . 
  there is no notion of passing with 50 % points or anything like that - the grades are abstract . 
  anyhow , even in academia , it is about the averages - the average kid is supposed to get a 3 ( where 2 is pass and 1 is fail ) . 
  mum 's a math teacher , their inspectors keep an eye on how a teacher grading curves looks like ... 
  well , to be nitpicky at the expense of my own thesis , 5 is not really the midpoint ; 5.5 is the midpoint . 
  which makes 5 already slightly low . 
  it is only by the assertion the system makes that 5 is supposed to be average that we even think of it as a centrist score . 
  and sure i totally agree - it ca n't be your personal average unless you either watch by random selection or pretty much everything , for surely you select to watch things rather likely to be enjoyable . 
  just as your list grows you 've seen a greater and greater sample of all the shows , so i 'm thinking its a less selective one . 
  need n't be , sure . 
  re the meaning of 4 , i just think that something around the middle point , however you understand the middle point , even if slightly on the low end of it , is still not so flawed to be quite that unenjoyable , so the comments that one is unlikely to even finish anything below 5 seems a bit excessive . 
  source material disappears as well ????? 
  oh god damn , i ca n't quite pin down 2 favorite shows with any consistency , but berserk could be among those in the running , depending on the day of the week , the weather , what the tealeaves say etc. 
  but to kill the 300 + chapter manga that people swear by is just cultural genocide , i could n't do that no matter what berserk was running against . 
  if not , its exactly the opposite - though the anime is great , the world loses little by axing a particular adaptation as long as the manga and its world lives . 
  that explains it perfectly . 
  could i see your list btw ? 
  yeah , i 'm wondering about that too in that upcoming shows thread . 
  plus its the only historical show on the list , so i think it has the best chances of appealing to me .
