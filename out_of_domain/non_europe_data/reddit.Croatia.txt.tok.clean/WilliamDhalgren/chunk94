  or maybe battery shorts if they 're both put wrong way and have damaged wrapping , though i ca n't really see that easily happening by mistake . . 
  its for mitigating these risks that i mentioned my disappointment that better fuses were n't around . 
  mention of convenience was simply about your comment on not being able to use particular tanks with mechs , not about the required curriculum unless you want to hurt yourself ... 
   rl learned network is not used for generating moves because it is inferior to the network trained on expert moves . 
  in that role it is - but its actually a much stronger go player , think its like 5d kgs - with no search !, 
   this part of network training takes over 3 weeks to run so it is not easy to tune . 
  well , on mere 50gpus it did . 
  did google up the resources fot the team ? 
  did they even try using any pro games for that components - their final net was n't trained on any of them ? 
   now the real strength of alphago really comes from mcts, 
  odd thing to say ; what do you find particularly strong about alphago 's version of mcts ? 
  does n't use even rave , progressive bias/widening , adaptive playout etc , as they did n't find any of these did much to make it stronger in the mix of the nn algorithms it 's using . 
  and mcts usually does n't scale great ; but maybe google has some new ideas here too , who knows ... would n't call it plain old , but it has stagnated in the last ~ 4 years , not really giving further improvements , as opposed to a great quick run it had mid-late 2000 's , when it revolutionized go-plaing programs ( and a bunch of other fields ) . . 
  also , if you look at the paper , you can see that the weakest configuration of alphago is the one using just the mcts rollouts . 
  jusing just the value network or just the policy network was somewhat stronger , though not by much . 
  combining them 2 by two was stronger , and all 3 components ofc strongest . 
  as far as i can tell each of its components is contributing about equally to its final strength . 
  and i 'd expect least innovation in the rollouts , as that 's its most traditional component . 
  on the other hand , training a value network is completely new ; unique to alphago . 
  would you consider an unregulated box mod instead ? 
  provided you get one with fuses , mosfet switches and a master on-off switch , you get all the safety of a regulated mod with reasonable minimalism of a mech , plus more battery life, 
  ... provided you can find any w fuses and a main switch that is , but should exist ... 
   the distributed alphago beats single machine alphago 77 % of times , indicating mcts is what really ups the game . 
  you think distributed alphago distributes just the rollouts ? 
  why ? 
  single machine runs the neural nets with 8 gpus , distributed version runs them on 280 gpus , distributing both policy network move generation as well as value network truncated evaluation . 
  final evaluation of any node in a tree is a balanced 50-50 average of what the value network said and what the rollouts say . 
  distributed system gets 278elo over a single machine one . 
  in comparison say , turning off the value network loses them 474elo , turning off the policy network 813elo . 
   there 's no reason why conv net should work other than that it can mimic human plays and presumably human play patterns provide good enough heuristics , at least against human players . 
  well , bad asymptotic complexity kills many an `` optimal '' algorithm  if you look at the paper , it states precisely why it works - because move generation reduces the width of the search , and value network reduces the depth of the search , attacking two problems that give tree search such combinatorial explosion . 
  t is asserted in the paper that the rl network performs worse at generating moves for alphago because it is not as creative . 
  that is rl seems to have reduced creativity .

  well , sure - for move prediction this is the case , i 'm just noticing how the thing turned out to be a damn good player on its own , as far as computer go programs pre-alphago go . 
   it is well known that networks alone are not very strong players . 
  sure . 
  though a search-less 5d kgs is quite impressive ; only a few programs have yet reached that power at all - dolbaram , zen & crazystone , maaybe abacus . . am i missing something ? 
  and these are complex fine-tuned beasts . 
  the rl-net in comparison trained itself ( for the most part ), 
  oh , yeah , certainly , clearly - distributed version runs the networks many more times , constructing deeper trees that way . 
  that 's not merely rollouts though , for they run on cpus ; each of the nodes of this deeper tree was evaluated by the value network for eg , and had equal contribution to its final evaluation as the rollout - these nets run on the extra gpus . 
  to make this scale , they need better tree pruning , both in width and depth , for the hardware they throw at the rollouts alone wo n't cut it , and the pruning they have already has pretty much been scaled as much as it could , given the tiny returns they were getting for extra hw . 
  and that means creating better nets . 
  a tree policy with a policy neural network and move evaluation with a value neural network is n't mcts - not particularly more similar than to say alpha-beta search , or the two to each other ( even runs on different hardware !, 
  ) , and is really just a novel tree search algoritm ; mcts uses rollouts for move evaluation and information from rollouts + random moves ( + possibly some large scale patterns ) for tree policy . 
  and ** that ** is only a component of the overall scaling . 
  and , the scaling of the tree search as they have it is horrible . 
  i mean it is google , maybe throwing ridiculous amounts of hardware , diminishing returns be damned could make sense to them , but i still ca n't see huge gains here - 428cpu/64gpu to 764cpu/112gpu they get 142 elo ; 764cpu/112gpu to 1202cpu/176gpu they get 61 elo ; from that to 1920cpu/280gpu its just 28elo . 
  making ** that ** scale does n't boil down to making one third of it scale alone , even presuming there 's much to be done there at all , for we 've had large clusters of cpu 's running mcts before , to marginal gains . 
  they 've got many more variables to play with in network architectures and training regimes - as these are pretty much virgin territory - than in their rollouts , esp since they 've stated they 've tried the typical mcts techniques already ( rapid-action-value estimation , all-moves-as-first , progressive widening , dynamic komi , opening books ) ... you should n't think of this as just giving the nets more time , since obviously they 've trained them to convergence , but in finding a net that can learn better/more , or generating better trainign datasets . 
  a trivial and prob bad but still illustrative idea -- their value network was trained on a dataset generated by the rl-net , a `` mere '' 5d . 
  now they 've got a system that plays much stronger than that , and given enough resources , can self-play that , or some sub-configurations of that , for the dataset generation ... 
  still seems a bit risky to dimly glow the thing at ~ 6w . 
  would n't it be safer to just do what dr. farsalinos suggest and never glow any metal , esp such at ti , but not even kanthal , and just tolerate somewhat untuned coils ? 
  for me , the tables turned w tc . 
  that 's a truly novel safe-vaping feature that does n't have an equivalent in the unregulated world . 
  i 'm happily waiting for my first regulated device in a long while just for that . 
  but before i 'd take a mech over a regulated box because the latter is more expensive and/or more limited ( usually varying balance of the two , and both got much better lately ) , in a bigger form factor than it need have ( wasting space on the chips and shit ) , and with a slightly shorter battery life ( though such losses got rather tiny too as regulated boxes got better , but unless there 's a relevant pro , unjustified ) , w/o actually doing anything useful except for having a fuse . 
  a mighty big and expensive way of finding oneself a fuse . . 
  i 'd look for an unregulated box mod instead , with the relevant safety features , and be in no worse shape safety-wise . 
  and i 'm frustrated the mech market is n't more safety conscious . 
  uninsulated hybrid top-caps , how the hell does such an idea get popular ffs !? 
  and little to no venting , esp on the top ... its that clouds and showing off and voltage drop obsession that 's driving me nuts in the vaping world , but i digress . 
  i can tune my vape how i want to just by how i roll the coils ( i 'm not even good at it ... ) , and i know how to take care of batteries , and have no interest in extreme builds . 
  had to know it , for i started vaping when the regulated boxes were particularly shitty . 
  ca n't exactly format my memory and lose that knowledge now , so for me the benefits of regulation are non-existant basically . 
  today , starting over yeah , i prob would n't bother . 
  yeah makes sense . 
  re dry hits/burnt cotton , you can turn your temp a bit further down than what you would , work on making your coils better from the start , test with some dry cotton in tc before use ( maybe heating it a bit in tc helps shaping them while being miles away from any glow ? ), 
  i would like to know however if there 's a way to realistically balance a dual coil w/o any glowing ; seems to me giving the coil more space and wicking - as in , by using two - could enable keeping them at lower temperatures while still getting a satisfying amout of vapor . 
  still seems sensible as long as one is staying well away from tio \u2082 temperatures . . 
  very good point re projectiles . 
  strange how the least safe designs became most popular , such asthin/flimsy top-caps , direct battery connections , uninsulated tops , little to no venting , esp above , no lock rings ... damn . 
  but ppl fuss about the voltage drop instead ... sigh ... 
  there are better pipes around though , just not hyped ( or recent ? 
  ) , and an unregulated box can be just as safe as a regulated device ( though ppl seem to avoid fuses there too - b/c of the voltage drop :( ) . 
  ie , the user error that gets dangerous is different batteries in the box , and that 's it . 
  alphago is at core a tree search . 
  sophisticated one , with neural network fancy pruning but fundamentally yet another tree search . 
  you 're generally right , but in reality it depends on the beginner . 
  does his eye glow if you talk about discharge curves at different amperages , pulsed and continous discharge , voltage drop and the basic ohm 's law ? 
  think such a guy would 've gotten a mech rather soon . 
  maybe today even then there 's no point . 
  few years ago though . 
  certainly . 
  will you pay through your nose for stuff like provari used to be - or learn some rather basic hobby electronics , which is first of all a fun hobby , and be as good ( hell , be in a much better position , both in wattage and in terms of form factor ) for a fraction of the price ? 
  i went with a mech right after figuring out my first ego was shit . 
  never went near doing dangerously high-powered stuff ; no interest . 
  at that time , i still think it was the right choice . 
  now , i 'm buying a cuboid , 
  i think someone in the thread from tomorrow , on an explosion quoted a stat with 25 ecig related explosion ove 6 years in us , 2 of which happened during use . 
  i 've seen accidents with unregulated devices , ie . 
  hobbyist-only devices in apparently beginner 's hands , or pushed to their limits , or even worse a hobbyist-built diy device that was improperly designed . 
  this is clearly dangerous territory , and one where one might venture into only if knowing a bit on electronics , and in particular on battery safety , lest one make a circuit that will effectively turn the thing into a pipe bomb ... 
  with most models on the mass market though , this is quite unlikely - but still not impossible . 
  especially unlikely to happen during use as opposed to during charging , which at least is n't as deadly . 
  i think a further 20 of those cases were all about battery failures during charging . 
  here 's the quote :,
