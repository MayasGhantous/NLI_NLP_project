why the downvotes ? 
  the man is simply stating his opinion . 
  anyway , i ca n't think of the last time i viewed a pdf outside my browser , so having it built in means i have one less thing to install after setting up a new system . 
  i do agree it should n't be a priority , but it is how it is . 
  what ? 
  [ no ] ( http://greenorganicdevotion.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/ar123700913225793.jpg ) , there is no excrement in the toilet ** tank ** . 
  touchwiz on samsung phones also has the screenshot capability . 
  i believe it uses the same shortcut ( power + home ) , or you can hold the power button and pick ` screenshot ' from the menu . 
  i think you can check it in settings-about phone , but here 's a [ list of phones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/htc_sense#devices ) which lists the phones by its htc sense version . 
  nope , it 's the same people that are amazed by `` proof of god 's existence '' whenever they see a picture like [ this one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kayym.png ) . 
  yeah , i 'd say it 's photoshopped . 
  i 'm guessing it never did delete a file . 
  the user probably corrupted it himself , since text editors can open any kind of file you throw at them . 
  once you delete some of the contents of that file , naturally it gets corrupted . 
  revenue, 
  lik dis if u cry evertim :(,

  you 're only not allowed to take photos of locations with a '' [ photography forbidden ] ( http://linea.hr/files/image/proizvodniprogram/znakovisigurnosti/znakovizabrane/za-41al-zabranjeno-fotograf.jpg ) '' sign visible or when the authorities specifically tell you not to . 
  however , the law also dictates you can be penalized only after a warning , so if you do try to or take a picture in a location where it 's forbidden you 'll get warned first . 
  you can only get fined if you do it a second time . 
  hey there !, 
  if you 're using chrome , you can actually install [ this ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/piohdenkodpbcigpkmicjapilbfjioil ) addon . 
  it disables sending read reports in messages , works great . 
  not sure if there 's a counterpart for firefox , and even if there is n't you could probably just do it via adblock plus ... 
  somehow . 
  hitting grass crashes the game for me ( survival mode ) . 
  it wo n't . 
  do n't worry , the wiki was already updated prior to the announcement . 
  12.04 is awesome . 
  unity is pretty good , but the version from ikarosdev 's ppa is a must-have for me . 
  with it you can disable global menu auto hide ( then the application menu always shows , just like in os x ) , and enable window dodge for the dock ( hides the dock if a window overlaps with it , which means more horizontal space ) . 
  more info and how to install [ here ] ( http://www.webupd8.org/2012/07/disable-global-menu-autohide-behaviour.html ) . 
  useful information indeed . 
  maybe this should be in the sidebar as well ? 
  [ for the lazy . 
  ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback ), 
  it 's just a launcher though , like any other app you install . 
  no root needed . 
  when the update comes you can just uninstall it and go back to the stock launcher if you like it more . 
  ah , well that 's a totally different thing then . 
  thanks for the clarification , and i hope your father gets to experience android as the wonderful os it truly is , 
  also features an [ expandable notification ] ( http://imgur.com/a/yysbr ) in jelly bean , although i 'm not sure if it was added with this or a previous update .

  much faster than rapidgator . 
  it 's a multipart . rar file . 
  you extract a . tar.md5 from those two rars , and rename it to just . tar in order for it to work . 
  i think you can just find the firmware on sammobile now , though . 
  nova launcher + nova launcher prime : 5.5 mb in total ( app + data ),

  works fine on my s2, 
  so is most of europe ... 
  why not use [ google 's official calendar app ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&amp;hl=en ) ? 
  also , you can find the calculator from cyanogenmod [ here ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android2.calculator3 ) . 
  yes, 
  nice !, 
  had no idea about this . 
  they have, 
  yeah , quite a bit snappier than opening the camera app and taking a picture , though you have to deal with a much smaller viewfinder . 
  because other people without access to the server 's cpanel/phpmyadmin need to be able to export the database contents into csv at any time with an easy to use web ui . 
  i also need to be able to summon the export script with a weekly cronjob and have the csv saved on the server . 
  i 'll have to look that up . 
  for now i have it partially resolved with adding the utf-8 bom ... might just be ok for internal use . 
  could n't you just use post instead of get ? 
  ha , completely missed that the request was coming via a link in an email . 
  i just checked and it 's pretty easy for me . 
  open youtube , click on the user picture , click ` switch account ' and select a different channel from the list . 
  how does it work for you ? 
  seems the problems is in the missing semicolon on line 5, 
  it 's called mindset .
