  db bahn also has a cheap ic-bus from m\u00fcnchen to zagreb .

  yeah , nintendo reminds me a lot of this clip from fingt club - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sydlv8rk4z8, 
  like they 're stuck in some insomnia-like state for some 30 years alredy ; just making a copy of a copy of a copy of some nice games they made a long long time ago . 
  that 's also wrong as there 's a lot more than 1 dwarf planet in the solar system ... 
  and that 's the croatian flag .

  what did they do ? 
  god damn it , not sure if i really even wan na know ... 
  it 's a shitty camera so i did n't really care about it . 
  though after cleaning it for a few hours it was like new ( but still shitty ) . 
  after reevaluating i must agree . 
  it was darude all along . 
  [ osmaaan my man !, 
  cannon ixus series ( unfortunately i do n't remember the exact model ) but i bought it on christmas sale of 2010 in mediamarkt for 50 eur - so you can imagine how shitty it is . 
  ha ha ha , that 's awesome . 
  i 'll send it to everyone in this picture ... except darude, 
  yeah , it was my first time in the desert and it was really sureal for me when storm appeared and swept over us in a matter of minutes . 
  i had to climb the nearest dune to take a few pictures . 
  [ i really like this one too ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tzw15er.jpg ) . 
  shame i never managed to give this picture to the girl on the dune ( have no idea who she is ) - bet she would like it . 
  nah , not my job ; though would be awesome if it were . 
  in reality i was quite lucky with this photo as i 'm not educated in or naturally any good with photography . 
  i went on a trip to tunis to treat myself for graduating collage . 
  there i decided to go and see the desert . 
  yeah , think so too . 
  i had to reread the series after this trip . 
  though i 'm still waiting for spacex to bring me a bit closer to foundation series .

  pohani camembert + marmelada od brusnice, 
  how is this mapporn ? 
  it 's amazingly inaccurate . 
  for starters dalmatia was never under or dependant of ottoman rule , neather was istria . 
  what happened with dubrovnik/ragusa ? 
  also zagreb , zagorje or any part of slovenia that were never even close to areas of ottoman rule . 
  what happened with mapporn ? 
  it used to have quality content and now it 's mostly shit like this . 
  / end rant, 
  ottomans managed to achieve some victories against venetia and even hold some parts of dalmatia for some time but how does this make the whole region a dependency or an ottoman territory ? 
  that 's just ridiculous . 
  that 's like saying that the whole north america was under the dutch rule for last 500 years as they obviously held some territory there . 
  how about the other places i mentioned ? 
  dubrovnik was clearly independent for the whole time . 
  what about montenegro ? 
  ok , zagreb was somewhat close to the borders of ah with the ottoman empire but was clearly for the whole time under the ah rule ( this is not me just saying shit - there 's plenty of sources online ) . 
  also what about the whole of slovenia and areas of austria that you included ? 
  how is that close ? 
  even if we pretend it is , how does that make it in any way under the ottoman rule ? 
  you were also more than liberal with the hungarian territories . 
  are you by any chance turkish ? 
  is this what you learn in school ? 
  i 'm just stating the facts . 
  it 's a crappy map with a plethora of errors and such should not be posted here . 
  no ajde i to je nesto , pa da se zna . 
  sorry op but this is shitpost . 
  and i 'm even a huge fan of j. r. r. tolkien 's work ( got all the books and everything ) . 
  oh op ; i ca n't stay mad at you ... gim me a kiss !, 
  i 'll take it !, 
  yes , people care even less about eu now as it 's not in the news as much . 
  dunno , but there 's a lot of choices . 
  depends which town and which language would you prefer . 
  guess so , zagreb , split , zadar , pula and osjek have good public universities . 
  never cared for the private ones so have no idea about those . 
  zagreb uni is definitely the best but i 've heard some good stuff about studying in dubrovnik but also costs something like 6000 eur a year ... so if you can spend that much on your masters it could be a good choice . 
  yup , looks awfull . 
  a portion of pure disgusting fat . 
  and to be clear i really like pizza and any type of cheese . 
  dunno what 's with americans and shit like this . 
  scott manley and totalbiscuit , nothing changed . 
  well i knew about it , and i only played the damn game for maybe 100 hours . 
  jonas brothers , for sure . 
  it 's a commercial centre of the country - off course it has a business district . 
  there 's 3 of em that i know of , so it 's not really centralized as in some cities .

  if you would like to play some cartoonish fps type games maybe you should give unreal tournament 3 a chance , strangely enough it still looks somewhat better than this . 
  colonization ? 
  croatia was under the habsburg crown but i do n't think a term colonization could be applied here . 
  similarly you could ask the austrians what do they think about the colonization under sigismund i or perhaps scots about the colonization since the formation of the great britain . 
  well , it could be argued that for the most parts of the middle ages serbia was an ottoman colony . 
   national movement and nationalists were jailed and persecuted, 
  well , i guess than these people and movements never existed :, 
   official language was austrian ( or hungarian ),
