  also i guess all that naver happened ? 
  also austrian language ?!? 
   all public and high offices were held by austrian or hungarian nationals, 
  also these people never exisited , right ? 
   as every subdued and defeated nation , croatia suffered under foreign regime . 
  on the positive side , austrians brought much culture , industry and development . 
  so i would say that total influence was not all that bad . 
  dude go back to primary school ( if you 're not there already ) as you 're missing at least 5-8th grade history lessons ( if you 're croatian ) . 
  you rustled my jimmies hard with spewing all this bullshit . 
  yes , lets just ignore all the arguments and go directly ad hominem . 
  that will prove you right for sure . 
  am i taking crazy pills over here ? 
  all of the links are nicely ordered to debunk the quoted statements right above . 
  is there maybe an android version ? 
  mine is an old htc desire x with 480 x 800 resolution . 
  but do n't they all need to also accommodate other 2 or 4 screens ? 
  google says 960x800 , 720p or 1080p would be perfect . 
  you got any of those ? 
  oh , i said it somewhat wrongly . 
  i ment that as - 1920x1080 . 
  if i just flipped the image it would probably not look as awesome . 
  when taling about hobits even sam has a better ass . 
  you should consider that not everyone is into gigantic fat asses .

  the number of hospitals refusing to do abortions for `` moral reasons '' is raising daily ( currently at 5 ) and there is no possible compromise in sight .

   religious instruction is mandatory in all or most state-funded schools with no secular or humanist alternative, 
  lol , what ? 
  this is not even funny any more . 
  pure garbage . 
  to clarify - religious instruction is by no means mandatory and every school is required to provide an secular or humanist alternative . 
  last time religious instruction was mandatory was probably during the habsburg rule , maybe not even then . 
  just dont answer the door naked ; that works for maybe 20 % of cases . 
  also good luck . 
  this kind of self ridicule sure helps to repute this almost comical perception of gamers worldwide . 
  so if you do n't mind me asking - what exactly are you looking for on this subreddit ? 
  yeah , i 've heard that argument before but always found it quite ilogical . 
  let me rephrase your words - `` not necessarily taking their position , but it 's very possible to practise religion and not identify as a beleiver ( or care how beleivers are perceived ) . 
  i 'm reluctant to adopt the label , myself . '',
