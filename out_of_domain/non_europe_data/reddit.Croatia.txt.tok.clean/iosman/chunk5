  schneider weisse a good beer ? 
  what ? 
  that 's the first . 
  i know a lot of people ( including myself ) that consider it extremelly shitty . 
  maybe i was a bit too harsh but i 've never felt schneider weisse was worth a review or even being drunk other when you 're already quite drunk and ca n't really taste the difference . 
  though i 'm not gon na claim to be a beer expert my current favorite are :, 
  1 ) [ bamberg rauchbier ] ( http://www.schlenkerla.de/ ) - unbelievably good , what beer dreams are made of . 
  2 ) [ weltenburg klosterbier ] ( http://www.weltenburger.de/ ) - they started brewing in 1050 ad , awesome beer , awesome wurst . 
  i strongly recommend their asam bock and hefe-wei\u00dfbier dunkel but everything they make is quite great . 
  3 ) [ regensburg weissbr\u00e4uhaus ] ( http://www.regensburger-weissbrauhaus.de/ ) - not that famous , and i 'm sure not a lot of people would claim it to be that awesome but i really like their altbayerisch dunkel and weissbier hell . 
  if you 're really interested in getting any of those and are unable to , i 'm always ready to make a sorts of exchange . 
  i would kill for some good bombardier bitter ( i know it 's not that great but for some reason i really like it and it sure brings back some good memories ) . 
  also sorry for my english - i 'm aware that i suck at it . 
  cheers from bayern . 
  it 's a shame most of these are quite bad but still manage to circle the internet for a few years already . 
  so i 'm not the only one ... 
  regensburg : cozy - foggy - friendly - magnificent, 
  yes they can , just not jointly with their partner . 
  nop , would never encourage a child to step into the money sucking scam that driving is - at least in europe . 
  i 've never gotten the drivers licence and am more than happy with this decision . 
  let 's break it down :, 
  driving school : 1200 eur, 
  insurance and tax : ~ 700 eur ( per year ), 
  a decent car :  2000 eur ( every 5 to 10 years ), 
  gas :  150 eur ( per month ), 
  that 's about 240 eur per month for the rest of your life + 1200 eur just to get you started . 
  with a decent public transportation ( at least wherever i 've lived so far ) or just cycling - getting a car is among the shittiest mistakes a person can do . 
  though if you live in a small village far away from the civilization , it would be a great decision to get a car . 
  reminds me of a quote by davor gobac , a frontman of croatian band [ psihomodo pop ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psihomodo_pop ) when talking about his generation of non-mainstream musicians that are now mostly dead or braindead from varying combinations of sex/drugs/alcohol . 
  `` they came out of nowhere , headed nowhere , and finally became noone and nothing '', 
  there was no recent war in croatia . 
  it 's an eu country that 's not exactly poor . 
  dude should do a bit of research before he starts begging for games - 2/10 for effort . 
  than by all means bush senior was recently a president , nintendo is a console we all recently played and just maybe i could still install some current games on my machintos classic 2 as i got it only recently in 1992 . 
  nop , not gon na be persuaded to something i personally find disgusting just becouse a group of people likes it . 
  i love lamp !, 
  everyone ... at least the last time i checked . 
  though i do n't count the 3 % apple and 1 % linux market share . 
  it 's impossible to know what was going trough her head but i ca n't shake the feeling that some people are just not ment for this world . 
  no matter how briliant and loved they are they would never find themselves fitting here and thus death becomes the only possible escape from this unwanted reality . 
  i 'm not really sure how to feel about it . 
  reminds me of a famous quote from a shawshank redemption -, 
  red : [ narrating ] sometimes it makes me sad , though ... andy being gone . 
  i have to remind myself that some birds are n't meant to be caged . 
  their feathers are just too bright . 
  and when they fly away , the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice . 
  but still , the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they 're gone . 
  i guess i just miss my friend . 
  a preacher from my local church ( where i was born ) repeatedly refused to debaptise me/remove from the list ( they get a financial support from the goverment based on the size of their community ) - i approached him about it many times . 
  now that i live in another country i registered myselfe as a nonbeleiver . 
  so i got that goin for me which is nice . 
  do n't know about the american pizza ( tasted it only a couple of times but the ones i 've tried were somewhat discusting ) but at least from my experience you did get one thing right - italian pizza is just bad , really really bad . 
  it might be traditional and whatnot but i 'm sure you 'll find a much better pizza almost anywhere else in europe ( and i do know a lot of europeans just like me who do think the same ) . 
  the fear of russia and communism has become a part of their national identity during the cold war . 
  considering how american ego is also still probably butthurt about it - it 's only natural that they are still dealing with it .
