  what 's with people and framing their degrees and puting them on walls ? 
  i took mine , looked at it for 10 to 15 seconds to be sure everything 's correct and than put it with the rest of the paperwork i might need whenever . 
  am not really sure how it looks anymore ... 
  [ no , it does not . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8kyi0wng40 ), 
  you seem to know a huge deal about me , considering you 've only read one sentence that i 've written . 
  oh , this is very interesting . 
  though , can you elaborate a bit more on the `` third-world schooling '' ? 
   marking the end of ottoman rule, 
  there was no ottoman rule in croatia . 
  ottomans held small parts of croatia for short periods of time but have never been even close to having something you could call a ottoman rule in croatia . 
  not really - http://www.us.mensa.org/join/joinnow/member-dues/, 
  annual dues are $ 70 unless specified in a multi-year or life plan . 
  not really sure what you 're talking about . 
  not that i 'm a huge fan of mensa but in their iq tests you get problems that test your logic skills and not mathematical skills . 
  it looks more or less like this - [ example ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/figuralrelation_german.png ), 
  not really , only a small number of people ever considered themselves yugoslav ( ethnicity ) . 
  also yugoslavia was a union of states ... so the chances are she was still a croatian citizen of croatian ethinicity ; even in 1970s . 
  oh honey , bless your heart . 
  you do try really hard . 
  for starters you should look up the results of [ croatian census of 1991 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_croatian_census ) - 2,2 % of all people considered themselves to be yugoslavian . 
  also everyone born in that time in a modern day croatia was automatically a citizen of [ socialist republic of croatia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_republic_of_croatia ) , which was a part of a federation of republics known as yugoslavia . 
  so as i sad ; a huge majority of people that lived in croatia at that time were still citizens of croatia ( which was a part of yugoslav federation ) as well as ethnically croatian . 
  hope this helps , 
  split is a really nice town but not exactly a beer mecca . 
  if you want some good croatian beer you should consider going to [ gospic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gospi%c4%87 ) , [ zagreb ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zagreb ) or [ vukovar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vukovar ) . 
  gospic and vukovar might not be nearly as nice as spit but that 's where the good stuff is brewed . 
  i guess zagreb would be a best option as it has some nice microbrew as well as a couple of the big producers . 
  netfliks i piratebay - najbolje rjesenje . 
  as a ( wishfully ) objective observer i would say they have a lot in common . 
  and it 's somewhat scarry that any of those 2 countrie ( + russia ) is a great power in this world . 
  centralserb you should give it a rest . 
  you would probably feel a bit better too . 
  i \u00b4 m in a similar situation and while i ca n't say everything 's perfect , it 's definitely not as grim as you portray it to be . 
  there are many things that could be improved in science in general but there 's 2 things that are bothering me about your post -, 
  1 ) money - if you 're into science for money than maybe being a science is not really for you . 
  i 'm not trying to put you down ... most of the people i know that find themselves in science do n't really care about money . 
  if you have enough to feed yourself and pay your expenses - you 're good . 
  everything else is a bonus . 
  if you really love science , you should be living to do science and not doing science to live . 
  if you understand it the wrong way around you 're never gon na feel complete or satisfied with your work and life . 
  2 ) `` i am the `` best and brightest '' '' - sure you are , just like the thousands of others in your field of work . 
  you are the most precious snowflake out there . 
  let me tell you something . 
  it 's anecdotal but i think it 's quite relevant for this rant of yours . 
  the best and most of the good scientists i 've had a pleasure to meet do n't care enough to put a phd or whatever title they hold on their door , their, 
  business card or whatnot , and they would most certainly never state they 're the most unique and the most awesome snowflake out there . 
  if you 're into science for social status and recognition you 're doing it wrong , extremely wrong . 
  i really do n't wan na seem patronizing more so as you seem like a bright person , but maybe you should really rethink your goals in life . 
  maybe you would feel a lot better doing something else , or going into the private sector . 
  i 'm quite sure that as you 've written you are good and just might become the best at what you do but if your motivation is not aligned with what you aredoing right now or trying to achieve , it 's just not going to make you happy ... 
  damn ... a small town where i spend my summers is about 2400 years old , and it looks almost the same as it did 180 years ago . 
  compared to the expansion of european cities american ones are like an atomic bomb - out of nowhere a huge explosion that devours everything in mere seconds . 
   to do what !, 
  i do n't like the original at all but the way lissie performs the persuit of happiness makes it damn good . 
  whatever your opinion or anyone elses actually is , it is irelevant in this matter as croatian is an official language of the eu ( not serbo-croatian or whatever you wan na call it ) and an official language of republic of croatia and that makes this map invalid . 
  well than it 's also swedish-norwegian and ukranian-russian ... now when we have bridged the languages with small differences why not progress logically -  slovenian-serbo-croatian . 
  though as a croatian i do understand slovakian perfectly well so why not slovakian-slovenian-serbo-croatian . 
  czech , polish and bulgarian are not that far away so why not czech-slovakian-slovenian-serbo-croatian-bulgarian . 
  the bottom line is that slavic languages are extremely similar to begin with and only difference in the case of croatian and serbian is that they were standardized at the time when the idea of uniting the south slavic people was at its peak . 
  there 's only one dialect of croatian and only one ( and only ) dialect of serbian that understand each other well ( and even those have some noticeable differences ) . 
  no one from serbia could understand kajkavian - croatian or chakavian - croatian any better than polish , ukrainian or czech . 
  even if you turn your blind eye on a lot of grammatical and vocabulary differences between these two languages there 's more than 1000 years of written evidence of independent development of croatian language - 100 years of a similar standardization can not possibly erase that .

  til americans really like to circlejerk on ther rice-corn-piss-water . 
  most of americna breweries ( the ones that make anything close to a real beer ) are younger than 20 years . 
  they make a really small share of the market and in 100 % of the cases are a blutant copy of a european styles of beer and tradition . 
  okay , whatever ... enjoy your beer , but the circlejerk attitude that `` america is hands down the best country in the world for beer '' is laughable at best when you 're comparing your beer , which is a copy tradition of 20 years to a for example more than 1000 years of beer production of a [ weltenburg kloster ] ( http://kloster-weltenburg.de/ ) . 
  sure , enjoy your kraft beer ... just do n't be so pretentious about it . 
  having some good beer does not make american beer culture the best in the world , especially if you 've been making some good stuff for only last 20 years . 
  also noone in their right mind would compare croatian to german , belgian or czech beer tradition ( though there are some good beer in croatia ) - do n't really see your point here . 
  and purity laws only apply in germany , bayern - nowhere else in europe . 
  having a good local beer culture is awesome and you should be proud of it ( as it seems you are ) but there 's plenty of time and inovation before you can call it the best in the world , especially when considering some other countries . 
  have you ever been to german , belgium , czech republic , england or ireland ? 
  yeah , i did overreact with the first post . 
  i 'm just a bit sick of the constant pretencious push of american beer on reddit . 
  have you seen \\ r \\ beer ? 
  ah well , whatever . 
  if you 're really going to croatia in some months - send me a message and we can meet up in zagreb for a nice glass of microbrew .

  the value of bitcoins is half of what it used to be a month or so ago ... [ a lot of people lost a lot of money ] ( http://www.coindesk.com/price/ ) .

  it \u00b4 s slovenia god damn it , it \u00b4 s nowhere near to bulgaria ... 
  oh god , where to start ... 
  [ here \u00b4 s balkans ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/balkan_topo_en.jpg ) . 
  so slovenia is clearly partially in the balkans , also even if you were not refering to slovenia ; the other blue colored ( lighter blue than slovenia ) country is actually serbia ... still not bulgaria  . 
  bulgaria is coloured yellow .
