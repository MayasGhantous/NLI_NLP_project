  there 's plenty of wrong things going on in croatia but this is definitely not it . 
  you should probably not base your opinion on experiences in some other balkan countries or what it used to be like some 20 years ago . 
  croatian coast does get a lot from tourism , but it also produces a lot of wine , exports fish , olives , olive oil , ships and whatnot . 
  i do n't think people go into tourism because everything else collapsed but it 's the easiest and the best way to earn money . 
  why would you wan na work in farming if you can rent apartments for 3 months a year and enjoy whatever you like for the rest 9 months . 
  if the tourism were to fade away they would just go back to more fishing , making ships and producing wine or whatnot ... 
  yes , and a republic of kosovo by a overwhelming majority of eu goverments .

  tuzla is not in croatia ... 
  shit , had no idea about the russian store error ... ah well . 
  thanks for the tip . 
  nah bro , compared to most of southern europe scandinavia is the filthy one, 
  faust ftw , i 've read it in 3 different languages so far . 
  i 'm really disapointed with croatia not being a member so far . 
  maybe soon ... 
  yes , i 've been to the south and the north . 
  you fail to take into account that sounthern european countries are a lot more densly populated and still manage to upkeep a better water and air quality than scandinavian countries . 
  you should also look up the kyoto protocol deadlines and implementation if you wan na see which european countries are more eco-friendly . 
  let me give you a hint - none of the scandinavian countries are making a huge progress . 
  if i remember correctly the biggest progress so far is made by croatia which sure is nowhere near sweden . 
  a few garbage power plants do n't make you an eco-friendly nation , 
  guy ?!? 
  he 's clearly a debateokin . 
  yes , it 's a bit like hitting an ` edge ball ' in table tennis . 
  not that i 'm defending his moronic comment but which exactly arabs are not muslim ? 
  you mean egyptian christians - that 's not really a lot . 
  i knew about egypt and lebanon but am really surprosed that christians make 50 % ( i expected maybe 20 % ) in lebanon . 
  though i would not really call a 3 % non muslims in iraq a significant percentage . 
  thanks for the info , though i wonder how is the civil war reflecting on syrian christians ... 
  i would guess that with this clusterfuck going on they do n't receive a lot of tolerance over there . 
  yugoslavia was never behind the iron curtain ... if only people cared enough to look at the wiki page on the subject before drawing any maps - what a glorious world would that be . 
  with / r/croatia being one of the bigger european subreddits i do n't really think your statement holds .

  slovenia stronk - devoured quite a big chunk of croatia, 
  [ bravo !,

  ah hvar - hvar , gon na be there next week . 
  croatia - eastern europe - [ wat ?!? 
  ummm no , not at all . 
  [ this is the flag of split ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/flag_of_the_city_of_split.svg/1000px-flag_of_the_city_of_split.svg.png ), 
  [ op , have you ever heard about google - our lord and saviour ? 
  ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=split%2c+croatia+wiki ), 
  ok , lets go with your classification then . 
  [ so logically it follows that austria , slovenia and czech republic are simply east europe and sweden is north-east europe . 
  right ? 
  i do n't think anyone outside australia really cares what they think , i was just stating the obvious . 
  i 'm not even from australia - not my problem . 
  to me it looked like one of those [ ant death circles ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma37cb10wmu ) . 
  thanks , ozama . 
  close but no , serbia is orthodox and croatia is mostly catholic . 
  though bosnia , which is inbetween is some 50 % muslim . 
  so you would be ok with german secret services spying on all the american communications if nsa is doing it already anyways ? 
  a dead hooker , no wait ... am i doing this right ? 
  come on man , there 's plenty of awesome stuff about mexico and central america . 
  food , tequila , rum , beaches , indian culture and probably plenty more . 
  i 'm somewhat sure you would be doing even somewhat better if there was not for a certain bully up north . 
  [ pula is nowhere close to eastern meiterranean .

  strai grad on island hvar . 
  it 's some 50kn for a 2 hour ferry ride to get there . 
  not as many tourists as in hvar , hvar but just as interesting and beautiful . 
  for croatia i would recommend - velebitsko , vukovarsko , kasacko , osjecko tamno , san servolo and tomislav . 
  they are all from different regions of the country so you might find it hard to find all of em at one place ( if not in zagreb or split ) . 
  nop , it is of venetian dialect but originates from the city state of dubrovnik ( ragusa ) , which is now part of croatia . 
  the word `` quarantine '' originates from the venetian dialect form of the italian quaranta giorni , meaning ` forty days ' . 
  this is due to the 40 day isolation of ships and people before entering the city of dubrovnik in dalmatia ( formerly known as ragusa ) . 
  this was practised as a measure of disease prevention related to the black death . 
  between 1348 and 1359 the black death wiped out an estimated 30 % of europe 's population , and a significant percentage of asia 's population . 
  the original document from 1377 , which is kept in the archives of dubrovnik , states that before entering the city , newcomers had to spend 30 days ( a trentine ) in a restricted place ( originally nearby islands ) waiting to see whether the symptoms of black death would develop . 
  later , isolation was prolonged to 40 days and was called quarantine . 
  star wars and dr. who - both are shit but for different reasons . 
  i 'm just glad you 're traveling a bit , maybe you get rid of some of that ignorance . 
  quite a loaded title you have here , especially as right there on the wikipedia page it shows they were ordered by their own ( rsk ) government to evacuate - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm#refugee_crisis, 
  also all the similar charges were dropped , or dismissed in the international court of law in hague later onn . 
  please do n't spread propaganda , it 's not nice and is counterproductive and somewhat disrespectful as you 're making the true serbian civil casulties of this operation seem like bullshit propaganda too .
