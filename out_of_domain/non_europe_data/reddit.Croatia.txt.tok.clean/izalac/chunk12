  then - when you get the basics done - you can be certain you can pull the drink well . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://gearpatrol.com/2013/03/01/espresso-the-complete-guide/ ) one of the recipe lists with more details - i do n't know about books though . 
  plenty of amtgard in fl . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.amtgardrecords.com/atlas/state.php?stateid=9 ) . 
  [ come at me , bro . 
  your skull is awesome tho . 
  i 've only played amtgard in europe , 
  you might be able to reach the florida amtgard players via [ e-sam forums ] ( http://www.electricsamurai.com/forums/ ) or [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/222753014406145/ ) . 
  for other larps , there 's a [larping.org search tool ] ( http://www.larping.org/larps/ ) . 
  good luck , 
  you have the prop skull from twh ??? 
  now i 'm jealous  and you absolutely should , 
  i just did this - though i made two large fauxppucinos instead of a mocha - or perhaps they 're closer to lattes , since milk expanded like crazy to over twice the original size . 
  thanks op . 
  it worked wonderfully . 
  maybe they 're having a winter break ? 
  not sure . 
  better ask them . 
  [ here 's their facebook group too ] ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/104321018986/ ) . 
  once you press the coffee , get it out immediately . 
  do n't make too much coffee ( better to make it fresh later than to make a full press and then sip on it for the rest of the day ) . 
  i preheat my cups with hot water . 
  that keeps the coffee warmer for longer . 
  if it 's roasted fresh , i 'd give it a try as long as it 's not roasted to char . 
  some coffee shops or clubs might offer courses ( or provide them as part of your training if you get a job there ) . 
  check them out , and learn what you can on the internet . 
  i was playing an imperial captain on an elder scrolls larp , 
  personally , i use 1 ( heaping ) teaspoon per dl with the coffee i have at the moment , but it 's been ground to espresso consistency ... should be coarser for optimal results , and then you 'll need more . 
  weight-based , i 've heard 1:10 ratio often mentioned . 
  i read that recommendation on the [ blue bottle website ] ( https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/french-press ) , 1:10 by mass . 
  i 've seen that ratio [ in other places too ] ( http://bellyupbaking.blogspot.com/2014/03/french-press-coffee.html ) . 
  [ starbucks mentions 2 tbsp/6 oz water ] ( http://www.starbucks.com/coffee/how-to-brew/coffee-press ) which is ... 1:12 - ish by volume ? 
  what i use would be more like 1:15 , but it 's not precise ... 
  i guess it would vary depending on coffee grind , type , age , personal tastes , and however you want to drink your coffee . 
  yesterday i got some good , freshly roasted coffee in a bean , a blend of four single origin arabica beans from a local coffee shop ( 40 % guatemala , 20 % costa rica , 20 % ethiopian and 20 % indian , i do n't remember the regions ) ... and i do n't have a grinder . 
  no brick and mortar store around here sells cheap burr grinders ... 
  i decided to order one online . 
  but while i wait , rather than just let it grow stale ( or buy a cheap blade grinder ) i decided to prep a coffee the old method : using mortar and pestle . 
  this is a good workout , and it makes everything around you have a scent of a freshly ground coffee . 
  if you want to do it , it 's best to do it standing so you can use your shoulders and hips . 
  after five minutes it looked like [ this ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fjm1use5x2i/vluifyxpd0i/aaaaaaaahz0/gi8xca5jing/w469-h833-no/20150118_111646.jpg ) . 
  the [ end result ] ( http://imgur.com/dq1blny ) was achieved after 15 minutes of grinding . 
  it could be finer ( especially those few larger chunks ) , but i decided to leave it like this so that the grounds do n't begin to lose the taste since enough time has passed . 
  besides , this was my first attempt ... 
  i prepared it in the french press . 
  it was delicious . 
  incomparable to anything pre-ground . 
  a few larger chunks than desired , but no dust . 
  nothing got in my drink . 
  strainer , now that 's a nice advice , 
  standing helps a lot , you can use shoulders and hips , 
  that 's the spirit , 
  makes the coffee sweeter :d, 
  or the back part of the axe . 
  that works too . 
  i ordered a hario mini , 
  in a week or two . 
  i 'll use mortar and pestle in the meanwhile , 
  me , obviously . 
  possibly some other folks who are just getting their coffee gear . 
  i made another cup . 
  half the amount of beans , since i was making only one small cup for myself . 
  6 minutes grinding time , much better consistency . 
  yesterday i had 3 . 
  2 days ago i had 10 . 
  but it 's usually around 5 . 
  i had it with medium grind 21g and it was great . 
  but that was with 3 dl of water - how much water are you using ? 
  i made [ these ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-wmryd7mxsq0/vlgboywmhki/aaaaaaaahvs/kkrlkq_daxg/s1009-no/img_20150115_190407.jpg ) lattes with a moka pot and they were perfectly fine . 
  i never tried making them with an aeropress since i do n't have one , but having tried aeropress coffee i think it should be good enough . 
  try using more coffee , finer grind and less water to make your shot more concentrated and espresso-like ( you 'll need shorter steeping time with that ) . 
  it will never be exactly the same as espresso , but it can be very tasty and concentrated . 
  you may also consider making your lattes with more coffee , or changing the beans/blend in some way to get a more noticeable taste . 
  googling around , it seems like the machine has a pressurized portafilter . 
  whether that is `` real espresso '' is sometimes a matter of debate . 
  on a positive side , it will taste close to the real thing . 
  on a negative side , you probably wo n't be able to tinker with grind / tamper pressure as much for optimal results ... 
  depends on what you consider `` acceptably fresh '' , only you can define that for yourself  but if it 's gon na sit in an airtight container it should be less than optimal but still fine . 
  try it , 
  17g at 250 ml is almost an equal ratio to 21g at 300 ml . 
  yes , totally unscientific . 
  french press = for more people than espresso machine ? 
  under espresso/capsule machine , all of them are capsule machines ( and 3 out of 4 are manufactured by krups ) . 
  under french / aero press , all of them are french presses . 
  under filter / drip machines , the first one is , of course , the one they 're offering if you subscribe to their newsletter ... 
  also , the list needs more superautos . 
  cool  i ordered one yesterday as well , 
  we make turkish . 
  i 'm brewing a blend of guatemala shb , costa rica tournon , ethiopia sidama and india baba budan coffee ( guatemala is 40 % , others are 20 % ) from a local coffee shop , roasted january 7th . 
  it 's nice and well rounded . 
  i 'm brewing it in a french press . 
  sounds pretty serious . 
  if i was a [ batista ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/batista25355a_crop4.jpg/800px-batista25355a_crop4.jpg ) , i 'd prefer someone tell me they 're attracted to me during my birthday parade where i 'd force every youth of the country to attend and do a show after i install myself as a dictator of their country . 
  however , i 'm neither a batista nor i have dated one . 
  nor am i a barista ... but i have married one , 
  meet them while they 're not working if you want to be taken seriously . 
  small french press , aeropress , single-cup drip devices , moka pots etc. 
  are all affordable and perfectly capable of producing a good single cup of coffee . 
  which one would you prefer ? 
  a ( very ) general guide : drip devices such as v60 or chemex produce a clear cup of filter coffee .
