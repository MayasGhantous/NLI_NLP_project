  grinder is probably the most important piece of gear you can own if you want good coffee . 
  get a burr grinder within your budget and preferred mode of operation . 
  even cheap coffee makers such as aeropress , french press etc. 
  can produce world class coffee , but only when you put in awesome beans which are well ground . 
  can i get a bit of coffee in my sugar please ? 
  method 1 : cold water , put ground coffee on top . 
  let boil and do not stir at all ( unless crema already starts forming beneath your coffee , then stir it in ) . 
  when it raises , it 's done . 
  spices / sugar optional , but i never use them - if you would , you 'd put it before the coffee . 
  method 2 : like above , but with immediate stirring of the coffee , and sugar/spices go after the coffee . 
  method 3 ( the quick method , the bosnian method etc. 
  ) : boil water separately in a kettle . 
  heat up your cezve/ibrik with some ground coffee in , when you feel it smelling nicely pour boiling water over , stir , and put it back on flames . 
  as soon as it starts to raise , remove ( do n't let it raise fully ) and wait until it `` drops '' . 
  you may remove some crema with spoons and put them into cups . 
  return it for one or two more partial raises , and then it 's done - leave it for a minute or two to settle , than pour over glasses . 
  do not sweeten , but instead serve sugar cubes on side , dunk them in coffee and eat them in bits . 
  these are all genuine , traditional variants ( and you 'll probably find dozens of others too ) . 
  find which you like best . 
  you may serve turkish coffee with turkish delight on side . 
  also , a glass of water ( to clean your palate before drinking the coffee ) . 
  the website does n't work for me , my dns ca n't resolve the address . 
  i tried it with both my regular and mobile isp . 
  lots of caffeine ? 
  i do n't see a problem there . 
  on the contrary . 
  he probably went to mcdonalds afterwards and complained that their cheeseburgers taste different from burger king cb . 
  i do n't recommend the second pot . 
  i 've had one like that fail on me - the handle attachment is not always secure on such models , and mine fell off and could n't be reattached . 
  if you want something that looks more like a generic pot , i recomment enameled ones which usually have welded handles . 
  both cook very good coffee though . 
  cocoa and powdered sugar are good examples of the consistency it needs to be at ( also , flour ) . 
  blade grinder is not ideal , but it will work - using a sieve to remove larger chunks would be a good idea , though . 
   6 inches of snow, 
  are you unused to snow ? 
  6 inches is not bad . 
  every job i 've ever been to expected me to be at work on time unless something disastrous happens . 
  wake up earlier , clean your car , driveway or however you usually get ready for work , prepare for slower traffic and drive carefully . 
  i use a moka pot to produce coffee at home which is very much like espresso . 
  it allows me to use freshly-ground coffee . 
  it 's both cheaper than a pod machine , has cheaper running costs ( these capsules do add up ) , and overall i 'm more pleased with results . 
  it is , however , slightly more work than pushing a button , but it 's done in a few minutes . 
  you could probably get similar results with an aeropress , which will be even faster than a moka pot to brew coffee . 
  you can possibly clean it in the evening and then throw some road salt on it ( if you have / can get any ) . 
  this will help with the fresh snowfall and ice , and may result in having very little ( if anything ) to clean in the morning . 
  keep in mind that what seems reasonable to you might not sound very reasonable to your sm or dm . 
  planning to open late in advance might be a risky call . 
  but i do n't know you , or them . 
  i 'm just making assumptions and saying what i would do in a similar situation , and what i would expect from others to do . 
  what situation will your opening partner be in ? 
  will he/she be there on time ? 
  that would be important to know . 
  no filtering . 
  i dissolve the calcium from my kettle using some white vinegar and water . 
  '' ... alright , so ten extra pumps of caramel syrup and white mocha . 
  [ got it ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/2td6lg/i_felt_disgusting_the_entire_time_i_made_this/ ) . '', 
  yeah , they 're all pretty much looking and working the same , regardless of the manufacturer . 
  there 's [ some on amazon ] ( http://www.amazon.com/enamel-coffee-pot-large-no/dp/b000lrfyzi/ ) too . 
  probably by your ip range ( i bet you ca n't even watch bbc on their website anymore ) . 
  some services are country locked . 
  this video was only released yesterday , 
  but he did some videos earlier too . 
  moka will not heat it , it will boil it . 
  under pressure . 
  i would not recommend that . 
  plus , it is not meant for milk and if some of the milk gets stuck e.g. 
  behind the gasket , you could get yourself a brand new mold colony . 
  even if that does n't happen , you could affect the flavor of future coffees made in the pot ... 
  without any logos and upper parts of the pot , it 's hard to say . 
  but you can check your [ gasket ] ( http://www.bialettishop.com/bw/info/bwmakersizegasket.htm ) and [ funnel ] ( http://www.bialettishop.com/bw/info/bwmakersizefunnel.htm ) dimensions to find out whether bialetti parts can fit . 
  good luck with your upkeep , 
  food and water does it for me . 
  butter in the coffee is a new fad ... google for bulletproof coffee . 
  i 've had a lot of success making lattes and cappuccinos with a moka pot . 
  although the result is not exactly the same as espresso , it works perfectly fine . . 
  they do n't . 
  pre-ground coffee was already exposed to oxygen and vented a lot of its ' co2 before packing ( otherwise , the bag would burst ) . 
  that is the time when ground coffee is fresh , but it is too volatile to pack in . 
  once it 's packed ( in an oxygen-free atmosphere ) , their further degradation is slowed down . 
  once the pack is opened , it 's already stale on some level - and that 's what most people drink . 
  as the time goes on , it goes even more stale since it 's exposed to oxygen . 
  how fresh is your coffee ? 
  have you tried other beans or coffee making methods ? 
  are you drinking it with or without the milk ? 
  these can make a lot of difference . 
  [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pcydtxckcdi/vmajjfnjpbi/aaaaaaaaijk/ichynlr0vz4/s1600/coffee_bs.jpg ) is my setup . 
  i 'm making turkish , french press and moka pot coffee . 
  top row , left to right :, 
  * coffee mill ( hario mini ceramic slim ),
