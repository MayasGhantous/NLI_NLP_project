  finished w2d1 today myself . 
  i had 6 sets of 90 sec running , 2 min walking + 5 min warmup , 5 min cooldown . 
  i use the zenlabs app on android , but it 's also available on ios : https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/c25k-5k-trainer-free-go-from/id485971733?mt=8, 
  congratulations on quitting smoking ( i also did that 3 years ago ) and making additional positive changes to your health with running , 
  remember , if you 're out of breath try running slower and focus on distance rather than speed . 
  if you 're in a decent physical shape , you 're probably able to run 5k with very little prep . 
  however , going from the beginning of the program to the end will get your body gradually used to long distance running . 
  if you follow the program in full , the runs you perform will be much more safe , comfortable and fun and with better times . 
  therefore , i would advise playing it safe and starting from the beginning - unless you really need to participate in a race soon ... 
  hey  w1d2 and w1d3 are identical to w1d1 so you will be repeating it . 
  it 's possible that you 're running too fast - i made the same mistake too . 
  long distance running is very different from 100 m sprinting . 
  jog slowly , even if it 's barely faster than walking - you will eventually build up speed as you build up your distance . 
  good luck !, 
  water . 
  artificial sweeteners can mess you up . 
  i also hated water , drinking tons of flavored drinks . 
  forced myself to drink water , which was horrible at first . 
  but in a few days that changed , and i did n't mind it at all - i even began to prefer it to sugary drinks . 
  dropped a lot of weight doing that . 
  water 's really best for you , and you quickly get used to it . 
  other acceptable drinks : black coffee , green tea . 
  unsweetened . 
  when i quit sodas i lost 5 kg in a very short time . 
  no more sugar in my drinks . 
  do n't think you 'll reach your target weight on cutting sodas alone , but it can be a significant part of your strategy . 
  might be platform specific issues . 
  did n't encounter these issues on android - i get ads once the workout is done , and nothing pauses my workouts . 
  i did n't get days accidentally completed , but i got one un-completed when i accidentally started the previous day , and then stopped it . 
  i 'm using the free version . 
  lavazza is not a gourmet coffee experience , but it should definitely taste better than instant . 
  * was your package well sealed ? 
  lavazza 's packaging is not always of the most reliable nature , and they can get air exposure . 
  * what 's the expiration date ? 
  also , lavazza will lose flavor way before the actual expiration date hits ... 
  * are you used to how italian-made espresso usually tastes ? 
  it 's a slightly different flavor profile than what most us drinkers are accustomed to . 
  * do you use sugar ? 
  with lavazza , you probably should . 
  also :, 
  * you wo n't get crema without an espresso machine . 
  * get some freshly roasted beans . 
  nothing beats freshly roasted coffee . 
  got it . 
  it can mark the day as complete/incomplete if you double tap on the day . 
  i 'm gon na try running w2d2 on ios tomorrow with that app ... see if i get the ad blocking issue . 
  ( edit : i wrote tap instead of double tap ), 
  wow !, 
  i got a cheap chinese waist pack from ebay . 
  weighs almost nothing and does the job well . 
  ok , i just ran w2d2 with ios version . 
  did n't get any full screen ads at all , only the banner on the bottom . 
  i 'm also a newbie , slightly heavier and fatter than you . 
  i lost 9 lbs in 4 weeks at a 1000 cal deficit . 
  i lifted and ate my proteins ... did n't lose measurable muscle mass so far - in fact i gained strength , but these are probably just newbie gains . 
  1k calorie deficit is n't the most comfortable thing around , but as long as you drink water and if possible keep away from restaurants you should be fine . 
  good luck bro !, 
  hey deem  the workout that you will find most helpful is fork putdowns . 
  i 'm 6 ' 2 '' , actually doing the journey from 240 to 175 ( at 211 now , planning to gain some muscle after reaching 175 ) , and i 've previously failed in losing weight because despite working my ass off i ate too much . 
  i 'm losing 2 pounds a week by eating 1000 calories under maintenance . 
  sometimes it 's not easy , but i do feel much more energetic . 
  i recommend myfitnesspal for tracking calories and macros - sometimes it 's surprizing how much ( or how little ) certain foods contain . 
  i 'm combining it with intermittent fasting , so basically on most days i eat only what i previously had for dinner and nothing else . 
  this works for me , but whatever works for you - as long as you 're in a caloric deficit you 'll lose weight . 
  if you 're not losing weight , you 're not in deficit . 
  while the nutritional change might seem unappealing ( or even unmanly ) to you , remember that it 's much easier to not eat 500 calories than to burn that amount while working out ( and feel sore for the next few days ) . 
  but you still want to work out - it will preserve your muscle mass as you lose weight , and make sure you 're losing fat instead . 
  aim for 2 pounds per week , as it is sustainable . 
  do n't be surprized if you lose more in the first few weeks ( but do n't expect to keep that rate ) . 
  remember , if you do it you must be in for the long run as that weight loss wo n't happen overnight . 
  do n't expect too much . 
  you wo n't have an athletic physique by this summer . 
  but you might get it by the next year , it is entirely possible . 
  and keep in mind ... while the best time to start is sometimes in the past , the second best time is right now  good luck !, 
  i ** love ** running and working out !, 
  it feels great !, 
  however , when i started running i hated every moment of it . 
  there was pain in places i did n't even know could hurt , and i felt miserable . 
  the trick is to run ** slower ** - that makes it so much more enjoyable . 
  i recommend / r/c25k - check it out if you have n't already . 
  i also did hiit/plyo circuit workouts that got me breathless , sweaty , aching and out of energy . 
  not fun . 
  lifting is just much more enjoyable , getting your upper body pumped is an awesome feeling . 
  leg day always sucks ... but it 's good for balance . 
  bottom line : you might be pushing yourself ** too ** hard . 
  yeah , that happened to me . 
  and still happens . 
  the answer for me was to change what i 'm eating . 
  that mostly happens with fried food to me , or with a lot of pasta . 
  vegetables , cottage cheese etc. 
  tend to make me full without eating tons of calories . 
  yes , please do some weight training . 
  since you 're on a deficit diet , it does n't really matter much what you do as long as you keep doing it . 
  whether it 's sl , ss , split routine , full body circuit on machines or something else - all of it will work and it will help you preserve your muscle mass while you lose weight , and on top of that you 'll get some strength . 
  but do n't expect big gains on a deficit . 
  once your weight is down , then it is the time to evaluate what sort of training/nutrition program you wish to follow next . 
  running can help with hiking tremendously - however , a 5 day hike can be much more difficult ( depends on how many breaks you take ) . 
  mix in some actual hikes with gear you intend to bring along , and be prepared for all weather conditions . 
  two things helped me : intermittent fasting and eating healthier food ( which will take less calories to sate you ) . 
  i still feel hungry at times , but it 's more manageable .
