  but if you skip a day for some reason it 's no problem . 
  just do it the next day !, 
   before i start , i need some advice . 
  i already missed a day this week so should i start next week ? 
  no need . 
  do your first run today , and do your first week tue - thu - sat . 
  then switch to your planned schedule next week . 
   i would n't really postpone anything , but i do n't know . 
  go out and run , it 's gon na be fun :d, 
   when should i run ? 
  in the morning or evening . 
  since i have problems waking up in the morning ( lack of structure and routine ) i think it might be a good idea to run in the morning , since it will give me some routine . 
  what do you say ? 
  i usually run on mornings , as it 's a bit colder then . 
  running made me a morning person , i always had trouble getting up early but since i started running i 'm looking forward to the run . 
  it wakes you up and gives you energy - especially when you get used to it , first few runs can be a bit difficult , 
   how has your life improved since you started running ? 
  in any aspect , not just physical fitness / weight loss . 
  are you more structured , disciplined , have more energy , sleep more/less ? 
  i certainly have more energy and alertness , and i feel more capable and useful in general . 
  plus , there 's also that fitness / weight loss thing . 
  it has already become sort of a habit . 
  for me , the hardest were w1d1 , w4d1 and w5d3 . 
  i ran my last run in wrong shoes , and did n't have much issues with it . 
  are you walking in your shoes , or only running ? 
  if you 're only running try walking in them for a few hours - watch how you step - and see if the problem goes away . 
  if not , return them . 
  keep it up , 
  great job !, 
  i 'm a croatian guy , and we also eat a lot of carbs culturally - pasta , potatoes , and tons of white bread that goes with everything . 
  we also eat tons of soups , and while people historically have n't been eating a lot of meat , there have always been beans , lentils , eggs , dairy etc. 
  the key to not eating tons of carbs is simply portion control . 
  and then you can supplement with your favorite choice of protein - eggs , whey protein etc. 
  i would n't drink that stuff unless you plan to ~ ~ impress ~ ~ gross out people around you . 
  if you drink that stuff separately it will have the same effect but it will be less vile . 
  you had a bad run . 
  happens to everyone , do n't worry about that - it 's not permanent . 
  i 'm sure w6d2 will be easier for you !, 
  well , round is a shape ... right ? 
  ok , now a serious answer . 
  finishing a 5k is cool , but it 's not a definition of fitness . 
  i 'm still overweight by a few kg and i do n't consider myself fit - but i finished a few 5k runs , yes . 
  i finished my 1st one when i was 10 kg heavier , and it was ** much ** more difficult doing so . 
  jogging a 5k is easy as long as you follow a structured plan such as c25k and if you have more or less normal mobility . 
  but with extra weight it will be more difficult , you 'll be ** way ** slower and you 'll have extra potential for injury . 
  however , if combined by caloric restriction it can help someone get into shape and improve their results , so it 's usually a good idea to start doing it . 
  awesome , congratulations !, 
  that 's my goal too :d what was your time ? 
  how did you train after finishing the program ? 
  great job !, 
  for me , w4d1 was one of the hardest days , but also pretty much a turning point in the program when i realized this is all possible ... you can do it , 
  are there any trails nearby which are cleared ? 
  i actually came here to post this :d, 
  i 'd say stick with the training plan to be sure you 'll recover well . 
  you 'll get longer runs at w6d3 and every day after anyway . 
  if you feel that it 's going too easy , feel free to increase your pace for the last few minutes or so . 
  that should get you winded , 
  increase your pace . 
  it will do wonders for you and it will ramp up the difficulty  i blasted through w7 and w8 and ran my w9d1 at an increased pace , i could n't repeat it today on w9d2 . 
  also , / r/running has a nice [ order of operations ] ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0b3tyr3d9s1s1dfpwa3e4nmzfow8/view ) guide which you might want to check out . 
  are you using the zen labs app ? 
  their w8d3 is 30 mins ( like w9 should be ) instead of 28 . 
  i switched to runkeeper after i stopped having walking intervals in the program . 
  i 'm not a muslim , but i 'm an if guy . 
  i eat one meal a day ( only dinner ) , and i typically work out twice a day : morning run ( on an empty stomach ) , and i lift about 2 hours after dinner . 
  when i 'm not on a cut , i also add another post-workout meal . 
  it works well for me - took me about a week to adjust from eating several meals a day . 
  if you find lifting hard in a fasted state , try doing it after prayer - whether the one in evening , or the one in morning - depending on what suits you better . 
  i 'm a guy , and not an american ... but yeah , a lot of this is also true for me . 
  i lost 17 kg ( 38 lbs ) in a year , and i also have wardrobe issues - pants which previously used to fit me now look like very loose cargo pants . 
  luckily , i got this thin several years ago for my wedding ( did n't last for long though ) , so i still got a bunch of barely-used clothes which i can wear once again . 
  i plan to lose another 10 kg or so . 
  i noticed the same thing when it comes to people . 
  they just treat you different !, 
  when i lost weight , a bunch of cold , distant and uncaring people in my everyday life suddenly became polite , caring , smiling , kind and warm . 
  people are more interested in what i have to say , and more inclined to trust me . 
  and there is no other apparent reason for that , none . 
  the change is very real , and very drastic . 
  sometimes it feels almost as if i 'm living someone else 's fantasy life that should not be possible to exist . 
  awesome weight loss and face gains , keep it up  request sent on mfp , same username as here . 
  how 's your muscle mass ? 
  if it 's low , lifting and building some muscle can help shape your body . 
  build muscle and then cut hard , and the love handles should go away . 
  everybody has some few stubborn areas of fat which are last to go away . 
  a cup of cooked quinoa is 222 kcals . 
  625 sounds about the right quantity for dry quinoa . 
  it soaks up water and gets bigger , but calories remain the same . 
  lots of people weigh it before cooking as it 's easier and makes less of a mess . 
  depends on what you consider `` pretty accurate '' . 
  i do n't consider any numbers on mfp to be 100 % accurate in every case , but a small inaccuracy does n't really matter in a long run . 
  as long as you 're eating less than you spend , you will slim down . 
  i 'm slimming down while lifting at the moment , and i certainly did n't get big . 
  food input is how you control weight . 
  workouts are about shaping your body . 
  i do , although it 's not my first choice . 
  i go from my training run straight to work , and i have nowhere to change . 
  wow !, 
  awesome pace and time , 
  yeah , that would be pretty accurate , 
  i run in the mornings on an empty stomach .
