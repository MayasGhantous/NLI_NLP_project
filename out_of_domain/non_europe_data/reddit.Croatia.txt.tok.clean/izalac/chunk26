  or if you do n't like coffee you can try tea . 
  black or green . 
  without anything in it . 
  it 's actually quite simple . 
  if you 're not losing weight , you 're maintaining - not starving yourself . 
  starving is when your body wastes away to nothing . 
  if you 're maintaining weight , it is safe to cut calories as long as you keep in healthy bmi range . 
  if you end up cutting more than 2 lbs/week , that is unhealthy in long term . 
  check out / r/bodyweightfitness / and their recommended routine in the right sidebar . 
  it has workout progressions , so you start from easier versions of workouts ... you do what you can . 
   is press-up a fancy word for push-up ? 
  it 's a british term afaik . 
  omg ... ** everything ** is better . 
  every part of my life is easier now . 
  walking , running , pooping , showering , working , cleaning around the house ... just plain existing and interacting with people . 
  mentioned a more detailed list in a post several days ago , but seriously i did not expect the benefits to be so ... drastic . 
  i did not realize how much i 've been eating . 
  what seemed small or reasonable back then ... well , mfp changed that perception for good . 
  eating less shrunk my stomach , i can not eat as much as i used to or i feel sick . 
  smaller portions now perfectly sate me . 
  i used to like donuts . 
  the one i ate few days ago was no different than those i used to eat before , but this time somehow it was horrible . 
  overly sweet and that nasty taste of oil . 
  i certainly did n't feel it before . 
  i had this happen to me . 
  i 'm no longer overweight but still near the top of the normal bmi range , and i 've been told by some people that i 'm too thin and even `` sickly '' . 
  sometimes i eat a lot in front of them just to keep them from making these comments , but i still watch out for my daily calories and i work out to be sure i 'm still losing weight . 
  your first meal after you wake up breaks your overnight fast , so it 's technically a breakfast - even if it 's actually a lunch or dinner . 
  this is normal and it will go away . 
  your body is not accustomed to the stress of running . 
  besides cardio , there 's also impact and since you 're overweight you also get your fat jiggling . 
  all of this is new for your body - despite the fact you did it years ago , your body lost the adaptations it once had . 
  a short checklist which might help you further :, 
  * make sure you 're not running too fast, 
  * do n't run on a full stomach, 
  * be well hydrated , but not bloated, 
  * try alternating your breathing , if you used to always exhale when you 're stepping down with one particular foot , change it up, 
  * some strength training ( gym , bodyweight etc ) is good for injury prevention and running comfort , 
  i do that too , but then i keep exhaling for 2 or 4 steps , which alternates my sides . 
   i have no desire to become a marathon runner or a sprinter, 
  but who do you want to look like one day ? 
  would you prefer the lean physique that long distance running will give you , or a more strong , muscular one that you can build by sprinting ? 
  and even if you do n't ever plan to sign up for a race , would n't you like to know you 're able to run a certain distance in a certain time ? 
  caloric restriction is for weight loss . 
  working out is for fitness , reaching your goals and shaping your body in a certain way . 
  best use of your time is logging calories on myfitnesspal or something similar . 
  remember that you ca n't outrun a bad diet , and 500 calories are much easier to not eat than they are to burn out - and working out tends to make you hungry . 
  personally , i do strength training - the / r/bodyweightfitness routine - but i also run long distance ( liss ) because it 's something i can do even if i just worked out . 
  and vice versa - i can work out after running . 
  which enables me to do work out more and go for more goals . 
  yeah , it hit me that i could almost run a hm if i needed . 
  it 's kinda nice to know, 
  i did actually carb up for it , 
  fast recovery to you as well , 
  do n't worry about your father 's side !, 
  you did n't inherit bad genetics ... maybe just a few bad eating habits . 
  you can fix everything . 
  everyone in my dad 's family smokes . 
  i quit . 
  everyone in both sides of my family has at least a bit of a gut , and i decided i wo n't have it anymore . 
  and i 'm on my way to do it . 
  at 31 i 'm a bit older than you , but if i can fix things after decades of bad decisions ... so can you , do n't worry . 
  mfp is great not only for counting calories , but also for learning how much calories certain foods have . 
  you do n't need a huge willpower to stay within your goals - just a discipline to log stuff accurately and try to hit your goals . 
  after a short time , it becomes easier to eat less . 
  eating old portions becomes hard . 
  your perception of what is a small meal and what is a big meal changes . 
  it 's not a constant struggle - just a short period of adaptation , which is not that bad actually because no food tastes as good as thin feels . 
  log everything you eat in myfitnesspal . 
  eat at a deficit - it can be hard because insanity is hard and it makes you hungry , but eating less is what you 'll need to lose weight . 
  mfp ( or some other tracker ) will help you know exactly where you 're at and how much you 're eating . 
  are you working out ? 
  if not , adding a workout allows you to eat more while maintaining the same deficit , and ensure most of your weight loss comes from fat instead of muscles . 
  i 've done 20/4 if for months with success . 
  it was easier for me to keep at work ( skip breakfast , go to work , eat two meals when i get home ) than on weekends . 
  i took a walk , or a light jog during my lunch break at work . 
  for me , if is the easiest way to stay under a calorie limit . 
  he has awesome tools at his disposal , and is in better situation than most people . 
  take healthy choices in a restaurant ( it 's paid for anyway ) , perhaps skip a meal , and utilize the gym . 
  i keep a log of both my food and my results - scale , tape measure , exercise results etc. 
  that way i have plenty of goals that i reach and visibly improve at all the time . 
  after a while , you just get used to the new eating habits . 
  even if you eat too much from time to time , as long as you 're improving at a rate you 're satisfied with , you 're doing fine . 
  we 'd all love our journeys to be shorter ... but time creates new habits , and slow and steady wins the race . 
  i log everything , and for me the log is just a number . 
  on some days i go under it , on others i go over it - as long as i lose weight consistently , i do n't fret much about it . 
  however , even on my `` cheat days '' i do my best to still eat under maintenance ( i usually eat at a 1k deficit ) . 
  15 lbs would be hard and possibly less than healthy , up to 10 lbs would be realistic and way more tolerable to lose in that time frame . 
  whether you 'd need to lose more is up to you , but this weight loss would be very visible . 
  best way to compare it is to take before/after photos and your measurements . 
  from top to bottom , i 'd suggest : neck , chest , waist , hips . 
  yeah , 10 lbs is manageable through just healthy eating - nutrition is actually crucial for weight loss . 
  i also recommend logging your food and activities on myfitnesspal or some other tracker to keep track of your calories and macros . 
  i would , however , recommend some form of working out . 
  it is not crucial for weight loss , but working out will improve how your body looks ( toning , skin health etc ) . 
  awesome , good luck , 
  even if it happens , a bit of loose skin will look ** far ** better on you than those 50-60 lbs . 
  it 's a risk . 
  i lost 50 lbs , i have a slight amount of loose skin but it 's not really visible , it can only be seen if it 's pinched . 
  it 's not the same amount as the people who lost 200 lbs have .
