  * at my lowest i was 81 kg ( 178 lbs ) , was prepping for a half marathon, 
  * i gained 9 kg during winter , i reached 90 kg again ( 198 lbs , this is the 20 lbs gain i mentioned ), 
  * i lost some weight since then , scale says 87 kg one morning , 88 other . 
  so about 2-3 kg , that 's the 5 lbs loss i mentioned . 
  this currently makes me exactly 30 kg less than my starting weight . 
  my regular units of measure are metric , including my bath scales so i list my weight in metric . 
  however , most people here seem to use imperial units , so i tend to convert on the fly and use them as well while posting in this sub . 
  sorry about the confusion , 
  thanks !, 
  and give it a go , it 's a very interesting experience in what you can do once you set your mind to it  and it opens many new roads and possibilities . 
  thanks , 
  it started being just a number on the scale for me , along the way i realized it 's much more , 
  awesome !, 
  keep it up bro , 
  can confirm the food thing  i find myself choosing and enjoying vegetables and lean protein far more , and pasta , greasy and extra salty food less . 
  2 years ago i was this fat guy laughing at people eating their `` bland rabbit food '' . 
  i never thought i would enjoy it so much one day . 
  or be a fit , active guy . 
  tastes change . 
  can confirm . 
  honestly it felt like i was in a second puberty for a while . 
  so ... how soon do you need to lose it ? 
  targeted weight loss is a myth . 
  as long as you eat less than you work out , you will lose the fat - from all around the place . 
  hit the weights and eat enough protein , this will prevent you from losing a lot of muscle as you lose the fat . 
  you will not build muscle as long as you eat in deficit . 
  if it 's working for you , it 's working for you . 
  when it 's no longer working for you , you 'll feel it . 
  it does n't really matter if you mess up a day . 
  if you mess up a week significantly , you 'll feel it . 
  here 's my advice :, 
  * diet : avoid/reduce carbs ( bread , mac & cheese , crackers etc ) , replace with lean protein ( e.g. 
  grilled chicken breasts , salmon etc ) and non-starchy vegetables . 
  you 'll get best results from adjusting your diet - diet is about 80 % of your weight loss , 
  * cheat day : maybe make it a single cheat meal in the day instead ? 
  * exercise / additional : start doing weights . 
  you already get your basic cardio from riding a bike . 
  get a trainer ( or at least a knowledgeable gymbro ) to show you proper form for barbell squats , deadlifts , bench press and standing overhead press - these are compound exercises which will have a huge overall effect . 
  you want big weights , which you can lift max 5-10 times before muscle failure . 
  arms and stomach weight exercises will be of limited use , as they train comparatively small muscles ( if for some reason you insist on not doing barbells - which are awesome - at least do the full circuit on machines 3 times a week ) . 
  as long as you keep losing weight , you wo n't get muscular - but you 'll gain strength , which is awesome . 
  more on / r/fitness, 
  should n't be a problem for oatmeal . 
  oatmeal can be prepared even in cold water , it just takes a long time for it to absorb liquid . 
  first of all , oats are 100 % edible raw ( us europeans like to just pour cold milk over it and eat it immediately before it goes soft ) . 
  so just pour hot water over it , wait a while , try it , and if it 's not soft enough just wait some more until it is . 
  you 're welcome . 
  good luck , 
  think of it like this :, 
  * diet is 80 % of the weight loss, 
  * it 's far easier to not eat 500 calories than it is to burn it with cardio, 
  * you need to lift - at this moment not to be stronger , but to help retain your muscle as you lose weight ( you want to keep muscle and lose fat ), 
  if you 're working out in your work gym an hour a day , my suggestion is 3 days of focused and quality weight lifting , 2 days of cardio . 
  focus on compound exercises and your biggest muscles . 
  i 'm talking about legs , glutes and back of course . 
  is there a chance you could increase your activity in a meaningful way outside of work ? 
  here 's a few ideas :, 
  * build / repair something, 
  * clean stuff, 
  * play with kids , or cousins , or something, 
  * do workouts at home with your wife , such as [ stronger challenge ] ( http://www.livestrong.com/stronger/ ) , [ yoga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plui6eyny-uzx5brnb2_kvycrn5h9osahc ) or something , it 's a nice experience to do stuff together, 
  * walk or cycle to places instead of driving ( if you 're not travelling too far ), 
  good luck !, 
  sounds like you do n't need to loseit , you need to / r/gainit , 
  you might want to try a recomp diet . 
  lift hard and maintain weight . 
  this is less effective than bulk/cut cycle though , and i 'm not quite sure you can achieve it fast . 
  if you 're doing a feminine cosplay , perhaps wearing a corset is an option ? 
  yes , pushups are awesome  i totally understand that , i recently started the [ 100 pushups challenge ] ( http://www.100pushups.com/ ) and i just keep finding ways to sneak in a few sets during the day :d, 
  there 's no bad weather - just bad clothes for the weather  if you 're adequately protected from the cold , wind and rain , you can be anywhere at any time ( most important things : layers , waterproof other layer , clothes that can get dirty ) . 
  once i avoided outdoors , these days i put on my rain gear and bike to work , it 's really just a matter of getting used to it . 
  any liquid will work . 
  i find milk to be tastier , but water is fewer calories , 
   trans boy, 
  sounds legit, 
  try to talk him into lifting or bodyweight strength training instead of cardio . 
  this will do a better job into preserving muscle mass , especially if he 's taking testosterone . 
  at 130 lbs , both of you still have little to worry about . 
  just enjoy life and your time together , this is likely to have more positive impact than arguing about food . 
  if he goes below 110 , raise some alarms . 
  hello . 
  did you read the [ faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq ) ? 
   so i stay in my room all day , which describes my current `` diet and exercise . '', 
  do n't let that stop you . 
  plenty of stuff you can do in your room , such as [ bodyweight exercises ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine ) , [ workout videos ] ( http://www.livestrong.com/stronger/ ) , [ yoga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plui6eyny-uzx5brnb2_kvycrn5h9osahc ) etc. 
   we should be moving out in a few weeks , and when we do , i 'd like to make some changes . 
  what 's stopping you from starting today ? 
  first of all , loose skin looks better than extra weight  second , a lot of it will come off with time . 
  skin also needs some time to adjust . 
  i had some loose skin several months ago , but it got better . 
  my advice :, 
  * go to your gw or even slightly below it, 
  * start bulking - nice , clean , slow bulk , while lifting heavy and often , getting enough protein and sleeping a lot, 
  * cut again, 
  muscle should fill in that skin as it slowly shrinks to your new body shape . 
  give your body a few months to adjust - it will look and feel different than now . 
  then ask yourself the same question . 
  if you got enough space to lie down , you can do almost everything regarding bodyweight , including pushups , yoga etc. 
  even if you only got barely enough space to stand , you can still do bodyweight squats , air punches , stretches and more . 
  if you have a 5-20 lbs object that you can lift , you can do plenty of exercises with it .
