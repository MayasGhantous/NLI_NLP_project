  do you like to run ? 
  or jump rope ? 
  if you 're buying gear yourself , a rope is cheaper than a treadmill . 
  treadmill running can help you prepare for outdoor running . 
  how fast do you jump / skip rope ? 
  do you have knee issues ? 
  are you doing liis , hiit , tabata something something ? 
  running fast burns more calories than jumping rope slowly . 
  jumping rope fast burns more calories than running . 
  you can do jumping jacks instead of rope jump too . 
  jumping needs less room at your home , but is more likely to irritate your neighbors below you if you live in an apartment/condo . 
  it 's hard to give a definite answer without knowing your current situation or goals . 
  and besides , any difference in effectivity for a particular effort is trivial . 
  do stuff . 
  i would n't suggest it . 
  for me , doing hiit and lifting did n't really work well together well . 
  liss cardio worked ok however . 
  or lift first , cardio later . 
  lose more , look better than them , and it will all pay off , 
  until then , do n't let it get to you . 
  there 's also / r/xxfitness with over 90k subscribers . 
  most of the good fitness advice is universal and gender-neutral , we 're all humans after all , 
  my body looked similar when i ended with my major weight loss . 
  bulk time . 
  starvation mode is a thing ... if you 're underweight , look like a death camp inmate , and are actually dying of starvation . 
  otherwise do n't worry about it . 
  personal experience : i did a few 24 hour fasts , they 're perfectly fine . 
  have n't done any longer periods . 
  average your calories and macros per week , you do n't need to micromanage every day . 
  ohp , pullups , deadlift , squats ... 
  op asked what to do . 
  if he 's focusing too much on the bench press other lifts should balance out his physique . 
  about 1700 . 
  with light activity levels , you should lose about 2 kg / month . 
  here 's links to your [ bmi ] ( http://www.smartbmicalculator.com/result.html?unit=0&amp;hc=170&amp;wk=62&amp;us=0&amp;ua=16&amp;gk= ) and [ tdee ] ( https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=metric&amp;g=male&amp;age=16&amp;kg=62&amp;cm=170&amp;act=1.2&amp;f=1 ) , i assumed you 're a guy from your other posts . 
  if pecs are too big , for a balanced physique you can either make them smaller or other muscles bigger . 
  i know which i would prefer , 
  do / r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine instead . 
  p90x is mostly cardio , and light weights with lots of reps. 
  however , to do it right you also need to be able to do a lot of pullups . 
  bulking / cutting is mostly about diet and not workouts . 
  yeh but there are a lot of routines that will work for both bulks and cuts . 
  better for what ? 
  did you read the faq ? 
  * treadmill is not to be believed because it probably vastly overestimates the calories , 5k of walk/run should be about half of what your treadmill is suggesting , maybe less, 
  * start tracking your calories , track everything including milk , fruit etc. 
  bananas and pears have about 100 cal/piece , oranges/tangerines are slightly better . 
  bread has tons of calories . 
  add milk and oil from your coffee , and your lunch + snacks begins to look more like 1500 calories . 
  are you still sure your main meal is 500ish ? 
  * results will probably take a while , be prepared for that, 
  * get decent sleep, 
  do n't worry about it !, 
  if it was a 6 lbs gain in a day , it was probably mostly water because of the extra sodium . 
  you know what works and how you got there , you 're living a healthier life now and you learned a lot of new things along the way . 
  overall , that 's an awesome accomplishment . 
  cycling to work is always good !, 
  is there a chance that you might switch to black coffee ? 
  it took me a while to switch to it , but after a few days you get used to the taste . 
  in fact , after a few days i started preferring black coffee . 
  it gets you the caffeine , and has no calories . 
  any chance that you just skip the bread and eat the soup without it ? 
  if nothing else changes , and you start cycling to work , cut out the milk and bread , this alone should be sufficient to lose about 2 kg in a month . 
  halving the fruit portion ( or going for equivalent number of tangerines/oranges instead of bananas/pears ) might boost this number to 3 kg . 
  and if you do a good weight routine , you 'll increase your strength and your loss will mainly come from fat . 
  win/win . 
  sounds like you pulled a muscle . 
  but to be safe , please discuss this with your doctor . 
  rule 5 on the sidebar . 
  if you never ran before , take it easy . 
  your muscles might be able to do it , but your connective tissue might not . 
  if you do too soon to fast , it 's easy to get an injury . 
  last summer i got my first runner 's high , then [ i pushed myself too hard during a run ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/39rans/i_was_stupid_today/ ) , went for too long distance and messed up my left knee . 
  took 2 painful months to fully recover because i allowed my ego to get the best of me . 
  check out / r/c25k for a safe training plan . 
  after you graduate it , go for 10k or half marathon training plans . 
  hmm . 
  perhaps you can try an indoor rower or an elliptical ? 
  they would allow you to use more arms for your cardio compared to a bike or treadmill ... 
  keep it up , 
  i do , more times than i should , but still way less often than when i was bigger , and with far smaller portions . 
  more sleep ? 
  good company ? 
  light yoga or something relaxing ? 
  yeah , agree with others . 
  bulk time . 
  your calorie count sounds good , but add some variety . 
  vegetables are your friends . 
  regarding your training , perhaps add something for legs . 
  i prefer lifting barefoot . 
  luckily i 'm in a gym which allows it . 
  i was actually 15 lbs lighter half a year ago , but i lost a lot of muscle mass . 
  i went on my first ( intentional ) bulk , gained some muscle mass and a lot of strength and i 'm now cutting . 
  not at my best now , but i 'm stronger , more muscular and with less bodyfat now than when i was previously on this weight . 
  but that 's ok , i was n't at my worst in the before picture either , it was the first time i dared to take a pic - after i lost 15 lbs . 
  currently doing a slow cut ( about 200-300 cal/day ) , training is martial arts + stronglifts . 
  i pulled mine , although not while benching . 
  was n't a bad pull , but still i could n't bench or do pushups for about 2 weeks . 
  i could do ohp without pain though . 
  never heard of that company , but that gear looks like injection molding technology such as is used by the german manufacturer hammerkunst .
