  hockey helmets and gloves ) - better safe than sorry . 
  i 'm a lurking kenjutsu practicioner ( with a historical interest and several friends who are into hema ) so take my opinions with a bit of salt , 
  which weapon interests you in hema ? 
  if it 's a longsword , katana is relatively similar so kendo techniques would transfer better . 
  if it 's say a smallsword or rapier , fencing would translate to it better . 
  fencing is purely sporty , kendo is sporty as well but has a large component of etiquette . 
  fencing will have you sparring sooner - with kendo , you 'll spend a few months first drilling footwork and cuts . 
  equipment wise , fencing can be cheaper if you do n't intend to participate in tournaments which require fie certified gear ... 
  kendo clubs can vary a lot in what they teach . 
  some of them might place greater emphasis on paired kata , or have separate iaido sections - this is good for learning historical techniques ( not used in sparring ) , which make you a more well-rounded swordsman . 
  good luck . 
  cardio is cardio . 
  the main muscles it works out are your heart and lungs . 
  regarding actual muscular involvement , impact is minimal regardless of what type you do . 
  lifting , kettlebells , box jumps and hiit on the other hand will have more noticeable impact on performance . 
  remember to eat well , drink a lot of water and rest a lot . 
  4 years ago i bought a calimacil bellator sword . 
  it was the best larp purchase i ever made . 
  the sword has a few nicks and scratches today ( mostly due to contact with sharp armor edges ) , but it 's still usable despite being abused on countless larps over these years ( including 2x drachenfest and 2x conquest , and i played a combat npc on all of these events ) . 
  nowadays they have an updated version , which looks better and is cheaper ... blades especially got a big visual upgrade in the last few years . 
  tamahagane is ... well , not really the best sort of steel . 
  however , traditional japanese swordsmithing will use forging processes and folding which will purify it to a degree . 
  there are some modern steels which would work better . 
  however , it 's a doubtful that a japanese master swordsmith would know how to use them best . 
  or even want to do that . 
  licenced japanese swordsmiths are all about making blades in a traditional way , with traditional materials . 
  they 're not about innovation with new materials and techniques . 
  i 'm riding a foldable bike actually , not a kids bike . 
  most folders around here have even smaller wheels ( 16 '' ) . 
  thanks , i 'll recheck again , and i 'll check the third puncture this evening when i disassemble it . 
  from the photos on the internet it certainly looks like a pinch flat . 
  i heard that starbucks has some single origin coffees as well ? 
  i do n't know if they have them where i 'm going to though . 
  interesting , i never tried iced coffee . 
  only hot . 
  and hot with ice cream in it , 
  trenta sounds scary though , it 's 4x the size of the largest size available in local shops . 
  i googled doubleshot , it 's a canned drink ? 
  i might take one to go then . 
  not a chai fan myself ( nothing wrong with it , i 'd just rather drink coffee 99 % of the time ) , but i might try their macchiato . 
  i might try that one , 
  i 'm not sure how to recognize regional specialties since i do n't know the regular offer well except by reading about it on the internet  but maybe you can find it on the [ website ] ( http://www.starbucks.hu/ ) ( it 's in hungarian though , which i do n't understand , and google translate does a bad job of translating it ) . 
  fixed the imgur link , thanks . 
  i pasted the wrong one by accident . 
  my max . 
  sidewall pressure is 2.7 bar , which is close to 40 psi . 
  i 'll look into getting a bike gauge , since my tires have presta valves so the car gauge does n't fit them . 
  thanks for the chain tips , they have been very useful !, 
  good advice . 
  i 'd also add : if it has been a long time since you peed , you probably need to drink more . 
  if the urine is deep yellow or darker , you probably need to drink more . 
  most people drink half the ammount of water than it 's good for them , while being sedentary indoors . 
  this amount needs to be ** at least doubled or tripled ** while being outdoors , active and during heat . 
  also , shade is your friend . 
  there 's only one larp in my entire country that 's older than 4 years and still running ... 
  up you go . 
  i have n't heard of these larps before , and i always love reading about the stuff i have n't heard before ( even though i 'm an ocean away and unlikely to participate in these games but oh well ) . 
  i have a question about rules . 
  checked out both of them , and they seem fairly complex . 
  we used to have a larp with a rather complex set of rules - though still simpler than this one - and we had some players who played for years and did n't really master it well . 
  nowadays , most european larps are far simpler , [ here 's an example ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tqun7jrppkxh2ayudndkhwzorjmsi0yvly91pz9ca2y/edit ) . 
  how do you manage to play ** two ** such systems ? 
  do you encounter any issues while playing them , like rules getting mixed up sometimes ? 
  also , how does your typical day as npc look like ? 
  how many characters do you play during the day ? 
  cheers . 
  hi and welcome !, 
  larping is a wide subject , there are numerous styles , themes , subjects , theories , practices and whatnot . 
  you 'll find that many larps are completely different from one another in their look , feel , how and what they play , and what they 're trying to accomplish . 
   i 'm interested in volunteering , npc and the like . 
  i 'd like to get a feel for it before i even thought about creating a character . 
  many larps differ about this . 
  there are larps which practically require npcing , there are larps who discourage it , and there are larps without npcs . 
  i suggest you talk to the organizers and ask them about what their recommendations are , and what would give you the best feel for the larp . 
  volunteering might or might not be it , and in fact it might be detrimental to your pc experience - because if you enter a game and you already know how stuff is organized , a little bit of magic and sense of wonder in there is lost forever . 
   i 've noticed that most larp groups i 've searched are listed for the whole weekend . 
  do you go and camp out , stay in hotels , drive home each evening , or what ? 
  i 've done all of that , and more . 
  depends on the larp really . 
  not pitching anyway , since i 'm on the wrong side of atlantic , but ... 
   a troupe that can make eight + / - episodes a year . 
  quarterly episodes feels like a bar to investment ic wise . 
  i 'm curious , why do you feel this is the case ? 
  where i live , most fantasy larps have 1-2 events a year , and are n't considering more . 
  also , have you considered larps such as vampire , or other world of darkness larps ? 
  they are not camping larps , but they would work well with your requirement of playing often , heavy rp ( storytelling might vary ) , and light travel . 
  it really depends on what you want out of the larp . 
  npcing can get you to learn how the larp works faster , and in nero it can get you more xp . 
  if xp is what you 're after . 
  but there are downsides . 
  as you learn how the larp works , the illusion of it being a real world is lessened , and you 'll learn the actual structure . 
  like watching the filming process instead of the finished movie . 
  if you 're approaching this from a gamified perspective , go npc . 
  if you want a memorable experience , go pc . 
  fighting you can practice elsewhere , or find a local amtgard / dagorhir / belegarth group who do that anyway and where you 'll probably get more fighting training than on npc weekend ( apart from calling out damage like in nero , but they also use real larp safe bows and arrows ) . 
  even if you find out that you do n't like something , you can always reroll another character . 
  you do n't have to have stellar acting , just be consistent and do n't break character . 
  any game set would be great on any larp that i participate on if it 's not overly out of character ( e.g. 
  plastic would not be ok on a fantasy larp ) . 
  as others already said , a maille needs to be roomy .
