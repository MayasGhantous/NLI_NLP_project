  my main characters are alliance on aggramar ( eu , pve ) since game launch . 
  it used to be medium , now it 's low - however it got `` joined '' with hellscream server , so they both effectively make one server where you can talk to , meet , trade , join guilds etc with people from both servers . 
  [ here ] ( http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8715582685 ) is a list of all connected eu servers . 
  no server is really isolated anymore anyway . 
  in early levels you get cross-realm zones , so you 'll play with people from all other servers in the region , not just your server . 
  same with dungeons if you use the lfg tool . 
  the only zones really unique to your server ( or connected servers ) are stormwind , orgrimmar , wintergrasp , tol barad , and the current expansion content . 
  on my server , most of the draenor is empty-ish , except tanaan , which is the last zone in current expansion which is well populated . 
  certain daily quests there can be hard to finish at certain times of the day when it 's highly populated , but most of the times it 's ok . 
  you can raid capitals on pve , and some other world pvp can still happen ( when it 's consensual , you can flag yourself by typing / pvp to become attackable by opposing faction , which in turn flags them for pvp as well ) . 
  it does not happen often though . 
  xpac launches can have queues and lag , but overall they 're well worth it . 
  the initial rush of doing everything with everyone else makes the game world feel very much alive . 
  conquest here , black ice - swarm 1 . 
  there 's absolutely no larps out there that do everything in a way that would please everyone . 
  everything about dagorhir strikes me as a more sporty oriented group . 
  is the injury issue specific to your chapter , or does it involve dag in total ? 
  if it 's specific to your local chapter , you should sort it out locally . 
  if it 's a global issue , there 's not much you can do except perhaps re-adjusting your ( and others ' ) expectations . 
  garb-wise , try to organize sca-style workshops etc for your chapter . 
  lead by example . 
  although with so many people there are limits to individual influence . 
  there are also other larps . 
  some of them might do certain things better . 
  maybe add one or two other larps that you 'll go to for your fix of stuff that dag leaves you unsatisfied with . 
  100 % of fantasy larps in southeastern europe are fought at full speed and significant contact . 
  i include the larp scene of my own country here - croatia - but also hungary , serbia , bulgaria , romania and greece . 
  i 've seen cinematic stuff in germany , but even there it 's mostly used in duels . 
  line combat can ( and often does ) get faster and less `` cinematic '' . 
  similar over here in croatia , but 10 years ago . 
  in effort to bring more people into larping in general , i talked to some tabletop folks and organized a first vampire larp in croatia slightly less than 3 years ago . 
  it grew beyond my imagination , split , tons of drama happened , sucked in all players old and new . 
  currently 2 strongest larps around here are both vampire larps . 
  so it kinda backfired ( for fantasy ) , although there have never been more larps in country . 
  only 1 fantasy larp has been held in the country this year so far , got about 15 players . 
  my own was postponed till september . 
  2 more are announced to happen , but nothing beyond that . 
  vampire is still getting stronger . 
  running a game this evening . 
  not sure if it 's a solution you want . 
  actually cycling exposes you to [ five times ** less ** air pollution ] ( http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/cyclists-exposed-five-times-less-air-pollution-cars-experiment-suggests-133129 ) compared to doing the same route in car . 
  bike commuter here , i 've got 14 km round trip to my workplace . 
  i started riding my bike in november . 
  cycling is awesome for me . 
  takes me about the same time to reach my workplace as it does in a car . 
  no traffic jams . 
  it 's cheap and helps me stay in shape .

  ili da citiram baki\u0107a :, 
   there is a small problem that makes it a bit more difficult for me to go and eat healthy , i do n't like raw food and almost do n't eat vegetables . 
  since i was a kid i never ate it and i just hate the taste , i 've tried to eat it but just noo . 
  so salads , raw tomato 's is all a no no . 
  i hated that as a kid as well - even in my 20s !, 
  but once i stopped eating as much fried food and pasta and started eating more vegetables , i found out that my taste buds changed - and did so very fast . 
  the first bite was horrible , but after only a single week i started really craving the stuff . 
  now i love salads , especially if i add some eggs , tuna or chicken ... and put a bit of yoghurt ( unflavored ofc ) and olive oil on top as dressing . 
  yum . 
   i do n't know if i 'm the right person for the gym, 
  yes . 
  you absolutely , positively , 100 % are . 
  gyms are for everyone , and everyone is the right person for the gym . 
  if you 're the right person to go to the store , or walk down the park , you are certainly the right person for the gym , 
   i forgot to say that i have a desk job ( 8 hours/day ) go to work with the train and when i leave the train i have to take 10 steps and i 'm at work . 
  so not much movement going on . 
  bicycle to work ? 
  if you do n't live too far . 
  i 've had the same when i 've been on deficit for a long time . 
  are you sticking to your meal plan religiously , every day ? 
  if yes , try having an extra meal one day a week , make sure you get at least at your daily maintenance ( * after * counting in your running calories ) . 
  should help with dizziness and tiredness ( although probably not with cold ) . 
   i have come to the conclusion that after many years of dieting including near starvation diets , shakes and appetite suppressants , i have messed my metabolism up, 
  are you a doctor ? 
  if not , please do n't try to self-diagnose medical conditions . 
  and in the unlikely event that you actually have a medical condition , the usual way to fix it is by doctor prescribing you some meds - not by any secret knowledge that strangers on the internet can tell you . 
  eat less ( but sustainable , not crash diets ) . 
  eat better . 
  move more . 
  logging will help you with accuracy and accountability . 
  that 's really all that is . 
  it helps supplement companies selling you their product . 
  a lot of people ( including sometimes me , depending on other stuff i ate that day ) drink a whey protein shake . 
  with water , not milk . 
  however , keep in mind it 's still calories and it wo n't really do much to you unless you lifted heavy or your other food is really protein deficient . 
  eating before workout , you do n't need it . 
  not after a week and half of training . 
  it can actually make you throw up . 
  ask again in 2 years of continuous training , then you 'll maybe find some use cases depending on your goals , but since you 're posting about it on loseit i guess weight loss is your goal . 
  eating extra stuff before or after training goes directly against that goal . 
  best muscle recovery is plenty of water and sleep . 
   summertime, 
   temps of up to 18c, 
   most people are wearing sleeveless tops and shorts, 
  around here ( croatia ) , up to 18c is not sleeveless weather . 
  it 's not even short sleeves weather . 
  it 's definitely long sleeve ( and long trouser ) weather , and if temperature reaches 15 or below plenty of people would be in jackets . 
  today 's max temperature here will be 27 , and it 's refreshing from last week 's 32 :d, 
  so yeah , jacket seems normal to me for your weather , i 'd probably wear one too , 
   barely drinking water and having pretty much no carbs, 
  this is a very unhealthy way to drop a ton of weight fast . 
  basically , it 's dehydration .
