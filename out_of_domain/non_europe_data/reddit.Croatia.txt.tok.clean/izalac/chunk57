  outside of tabletop format :, 
  * larping - role-playing while dressed up , full time in character , what 's there not to like ? 
  * computer-based rpgs - so i can have something to play alone or with online friends at times when we do n't play . 
  hmm . 
  would n't that actually be a good argument for keeping the lists separate ? 
  if your sorcerers have `` guided '' access that would limit their selection , and if wizards have the access to spells that sorcerers do n't , that could be an additional reason for sorcerers to perceive wizards as a threat . 
  sounds like a very cool idea . 
  you could also hand them notes with some clues ... which have a different message on them in uv ink , so when you do the switch the other text becomes visible . 
  you can always :, 
  * do something of personal importance to player characters , their backgrounds could provide plot hooks . 
  * build some opponents as characters with full stats to spice things up . 
  * use devious traps , ambushes , environment etc. 
  to make things more difficult . 
  * use puzzles . 
  * get them into some political play , they could be powerful enough to be of interest to various parties who 'd gladly use them as pawns for their own needs . 
  * when all else fails , roll a bunch of dice behind your screen , study them for a moment with a look of deep concern mixed with regret , let loose a heavy sigh , and announce that tiamat swoops from the sky and attacks . 
  the boars your druid would find on the market would be the domesticated sort of boars . 
  otherwise known as pigs . 
  i 'd say that about 8 gp is a reasonable price for a pig ( same as a donkey ) , compared to other phb prices . 
  hi , i 'm one of the cheapest fr heroes , 
  the only product i actually own is the starter set , although i 've been playing d&d in some form for the past 18 years . 
  i 'm quite satisfied about my purchase - lmop will last for a few months , the printed basic rules are useful for quick reference and handing them over to players , pregenerated character with instant plot hooks for lmop are nicely done , and the dice are very nice ( despite lacking d % ) . 
  now , here 's the catch . 
  it 's absolutely worth it ... for my needs . 
  i 'm running lmop in my home at the moment . 
  i 'm a player in a group which has all three core books and out of the abyss ( we 're having a blast ) . 
  monster manual sees a lot of use in our games . 
  we encounter something , dm finds the entry and shows us the illustration : `` you see this in front of you '' . 
  i 'm not quite sure whether it 's required for running the prewritten campaigns or the basic has all the necessary stats . 
  totyp looks great . 
  a word of warning : never run tomb of horrors unless you ** really ** want your players to hate you . 
  but as i said ... 
  i have my reasons why something is worth some money to me . 
  you have yours . 
  other redditors will have theirs . 
  the question being , what do ** you ** want to play/run ? 
  go with that . 
  you can do this with core options too . 
  variant human with skilled feat ( 4 skills + 2 from bg ) , starts as rogue ( 4 + 2 expertise ) , takes a level of cleric ( knowledge domain , 2 skills , expertised ) , 3 levels of lore bard ( 4 skills + 2 expertise + jack of all trades ) , 2 levels of warlock for beguiling influence invocation ( 2 skills , plus you pick up eldritch blast + agonizing invoc to make your damage competitive forever if you 're cha based ) . 
  18/18 , 6 expertise at level 7 . 
  granted , that 's 2 less expertise than taking scout , but it uses materials which will be allowed for more players , and it actually has competitive damage to go with it . 
  good luck if you go with it !, 
   also wants to expand his library of the books for the ultimate goal of having all of them, 
  you did say you 're not the wealthiest guy around , and now you say you want to have all of them . 
  can you buy books at their release schedule and still have spare money to buy those you missed ? 
  my advice for the next book would be mm ( if you plan to do your own adventures ) or a single campaign book ( they will last you for at least 6 months of play , perhaps even over a year ) , depends on what you plan to play . 
  afterwards , reevaluate your priorities and consider what would you want to do next . 
  starter set could be useful due to offering a nice adventure , 5 pregen characters , and a very quick set of rules . 
  phb next . 
  just checked out all these books on wotc site . 
  scag and upcoming totyp outright say `` for use with the fifth edition player 's handbook , ** monster manual ** , and dungeon master 's guide '' . 
  it could be that they rely on some mm content - i could see that happening for totyp . 
  if you do n't plan to run those long adventures , their relative value decreases for your needs . 
  in that case , i 'd suggest getting mm first , then totyp when it comes out , then volo , then scag . 
  once you got all core books and splat , if you have the money , go for adventures in the order you prefer . 
  also , if you do n't have it yet get yourself [ elemental evil player 's companion ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/player%e2%80%99s-companion ) , pdf version is free and you can print it or order the pod version for $ 10 . 
  are any of those restrictions optional ? 
  mechanically , the combination of light armor and strength is ... not an ideal option , as it makes you mad . 
  you 'll need str , dex for ac which will be low , con to soak up all the damage you would get , and maybe one more attribute ... 
  i suggest a pure bladelock going polearm master route - you get damage and reach so you can stay behind the tank . 
  i 'd build it like :, 
  race : human ( variant ) with polearm master feat ( gets you 2 attacks , one with a butt end ) and a way to use your reaction , an attack of opportunity when someone enters your reach . 
  full action economy at lvl 1 with quarterstaff . 
  stats ( assuming standard array ) : 16 14 12 10 8 14 ( well , i 'd actually put 12 in cha and 14 in con but you did say you want one mental stat at 14 so ... ), 
  at level 1 : booming blade and green-flame blade are excellent cantrips from scag which work on the melee swing . 
  since they do n't allow you bonus attack from polearm master , i suggest you take them but use them only when you do n't have hex on . 
  fiend pact is a suggested option due to dark one 's blessing which gets you temp hp ( though not much since your cha is not stellar . 
  goo is also an option for access to dissonant whispers as your lvl 1 spell - you can peel off a tough mob off you and opportunity attack them in their back when they run away . 
  i suggest getting hex and armor of agathys spells . 
  level 2 : extra spell and slot !, 
  hellish rebuke is good if you do n't get better uses for your reaction in a turn . 
  and two invocations : armor of shadows for that free mage armor ( sell your existing armor ) and fiendish vigor for false life and 8 temp hp between fights . 
  level 3 : this is when you come online . 
  pact of the blade and a nice polearm to go with it . 
  spell slot upgrade and a lvl 2 spell - mirror image is nice !, 
  if you got a party setup which can set you up with advantage ( battlemaster , monk , shield master , caster generous with faerie fire etc ) and/or a cleric/pally who keeps bless up a lot , i suggest taking great weapon master . 
  mobile is also a great option if you want to do hit & run ( and setup opportunity attacks with your polearm ) , if none of these appeal go for +2 str . 
  also a spell and a cantrip ... might be a good time to pick up that eldritch blast , just to have a ranged option . 
  lvl 5 : extra invocation ( thirsting blade ) , extra attack , all slots upgraded , extra spell . 
  your goal with that build is rush to lvl 12 for lifedrinker . 
  after that , feel free to either stay in the class or to multiclass . 
  great choices are fighter for some self healing and action surge ( especially battlemaster for tactical control which you already got good setup for ) , barbarian ( rage , reckless attack , danger sense and maybe extra speed if you stay in the class for a while ) , paladin ( smiting ) , or maybe all 3 . 
  of course , hurl through hell and a few more spells and arcanums are also a very attractive option . 
  sounds like a great composition with all the bases covered  their abilities can vary a lot depending on the chosen archetypes . 
  for monk , i 'd suggest open hand . 
  it 's very friendly to the ki pool , allowing you to use your abilities more often , and a very durable archetype which can function as awesome battlefield controller . 
  you can do great damage , set up advantage for your party , and get out in time . 
  if your fighter takes battlemaster and/or shield master feat , the two of you can play dodgeball with your enemies . 
  mutual acquaintances , pivotal events in their history that both characters took part in in some way , their past actions influencing another 's past because of the stuff they 've done ... etc. 
  i half-expected the egg to hatch from the heat , and baby dragon poking out saying `` mommy ? '', 
  if he 's into pathfinder , there 's a very nice related [ humble bundle ] ( https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-worldscape-book-bundle ) for a few more days , plenty of pdfs and some comics ( of both digital and printed variety ) . 
  if he does n't have that stuff yet that would be a nice gift . 
  armor of agathys is awesome , however , it costs a spell slot - something you 'll be sorely lacking for the entire play as warlock , unless you can short rest after every fight . 
  after you get hit , fiend pact will give you extra thp during the battle , and you 'll be able to get extra thp with fiendish vigor . 
  granted , there 's bound to be some overlap between three of them , but getting them all will make you extremely durable in battle . 
  hex is worth it - at lvl 5 + it gives you 2d6 extra on your first round ( if your main attacks hit ) + 3d6 on your following rounds ( if all your attacks hit and you can keep it ) , potentially more if you get opportunity attacks . 
  with polearms you got range , so ideally you wo n't be frontline but poking behind the tank and moving back a bit ( so you can score opportunity attacks if they decide to go for you ) . 
  mobile feat will also be a big help if you play that way , as it 's basically free disengage if you make an attack against people who are in melee with you . 
  er is ok ... if you got free slots . 
  which will often not be the case because when you need to run you 'll be out of spells , and you ca n't use it the first round anyway .
