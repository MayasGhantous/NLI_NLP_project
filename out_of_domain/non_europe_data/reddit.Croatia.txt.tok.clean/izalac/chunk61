  uncanny dodge and evasion makes you quite more durable than them . 
  your damage will suffer a bit from not hiding but you 'll be helping your party . 
  bad skills ? 
  you get expertise at lvl 1 and another at lvl 6 , which skills did you take proficiency and expertise in ? 
  bad damage ? 
  are you using poisons ? 
  what are your stats ? 
  feats ? 
  full spellcasters outperforming you ? 
  do you have a 5 minute adventure day , taking a long rest after every encounter ? 
  it 's gon na happen then . 
  do you ever need to sneak , hide , find/remove traps , steal/plant something , infiltrate stuff ? 
  when do you level them ? 
  do n't do it in the middle of the session . 
  we also have a party of 6 , 1 set of books and party level up is maybe 10-20 minutes in total . 
  here 's a few tips :, 
  * ask everyone to look up [ online srd ] ( http://www.5esrd.com/ ) between sessions and plan what to do next, 
  * taking average hp for level ( rounded up ) is a faster way than waiting for your turn to roll the dice ( and potentially trying to negotiate for rerolls ), 
  * ask your players to get their own copy of either phb or print out [ player 's basic rules ] ( http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/dnd/playerbasicrulesv03.pdf ) or bring tablets to open srd on - all of which can be used for looking up a lot of stuff for level up, 
  * get your casters to use the [ spellbook app ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spellsdd5 ) , this frees them from hogging phb, 
  * assist them to level up faster, 
  i 'm running lmop for a single player ( my wife ) . 
  i did n't shrink the dungeons , but i did reduce the number of combatants . 
  afterwards i found [ this blog ] ( http://pactofthetome.blogspot.hr/2015/03/getting-started-with-starter-set-part-1.html ) with some advice on making the adventure easier , the author did it in a similar way like i did . 
  however , be aware that reducing the difficulty could make combat encounters more boring and less adrenaline-pumping . 
  if you have a grid and minis , i suggest you use them in order to make combat more interesting . 
  if not , try to at least draw the dungeon on paper as players move - this gets them more involved . 
  i have n't tried shrinking the dungeon , as having the printed one in book gives me some nice visuals to show around , and i do n't have to redesign everything . 
  i do n't see the benefits of redoing the layout if you go that route - simply make some rooms empty and that 's it . 
  this . 
  d&d is about players having fun and being heroes . 
  if op 's dm wants to keep a npc in spotlight all the time , he might be better off writing fan fiction than running a game . 
  you need nothing . 
  or all . 
  depends on what your goals are . 
  * phb has tons of player options - extra races , classes , archetypes , backgrounds , and other stuff . 
  * mm has monsters - more than in basic , and with much more detailed description , ecology , and pretty pictures of them . 
  * dmg has extra magic items , planes , optional rules and stuff which helps you build and run your homebrew campaign . 
  overall , i 'd say :, 
  * all books are optional, 
  * if you plan to buy only one core book , make it phb, 
  * if you plan to run mainly published adventures , mm  dmg, 
  * if you plan to run mainly homebrew stuff , dmg  mm, 
  * buying adventures without phb or other core books is also valid , srd/basic cover all that you ** need ** - though perhaps not necessarily all that you ** want **, 
  if this is your first time , i suggest you get yourself a pre-written adventure ( lost mine of phandelver from 5e starter set is great for starting ) , read it cover to cover at least twice , and and run it as written . 
  this will give you some hands-on experience and allow you to develop a sense of how system works and how it is balanced . 
  our dm modded that part a bit , so it was found cursed and chaotic evil . 
  we did an extra quest to purify and restore it , several months later . 
  much fun was had , 
  * paladin cuts and burns through necromancer 's minions while necro casts a long spell, 
  * after a minute , pally kills all minions , gets to the necro and stabs him ... only to discover that the necro seems to have offered absolutely zero resistance, 
  * pally 's eyegaze falls upon a curious gem ... and then he finds his mind and soul pushed out of his body and into the gem . 
  magic jar . 
  * necro , now in the younger pally 's body , laughs and pockets the gem , his plan having succeeded . 
  he 'll have some fun this evening , torturing the trapped paladin 's soul just before dinner time . 
  there 's a brief description in sword coast adventurer 's guide , you can go from there and play with the old fluff and setting info . 
  if you 're a beast conclave archetype of revised ranger ( which does n't get an extra attack ) , mcing into fighter is useful . 
  up to almost any level really , but 5 is what you 're after for extra attack . 
  at 1 choose a fighting style you do n't have , at 2 you get action surge , 3 is archetype ( battle master is awesome ) , 4 , 6 and 8 get you an asi . 
  if you already got extra attack , go rogue . 
  you 're aiming for cunning action at lvl 2 , and you get some nice skills in the meanwhile . 
  if you 're a dual-wielding melee , also consider monk with these stats . 
  that could be a fun build . 
  personally , i 'd rather take 1 less level of either paladin or fighter and put it into warlock instead . 
  yes , you lose an asi in the long run - but you get another invocation , another spell and a spell slot upgrade for rechargeable smiting . 
  another build to consider : pal 6 / lock 11 / war 3 - 2 asis down , but 3 lvl5 rechargeable slots to spend on smiting , manuevers , 5 invocations and a lvl 6 arcanum . 
  that 's why necro has his lucky feat . 
  he 'll also get to use his other 2 daily uses later that night when he hits a tavern after dinner , in his new , young , muscular body and gets some girls . 
  hey it 's been 50 years since last time . 
  talk eldreth into tanking for your party ? 
  how about paladin ? 
  perhaps with polearm master to make things interesting on the battlefield . 
  moon druid ? 
  great meatshield , and still a full spellcaster . 
  or perhaps a wizard ? 
  abjurer has a full wizard spell list , and projected ward can make your squishies less squishy , eliminating some need for the healing . 
   red dragon wyrmling, 
  you let that egg hatch ? 
  assassinate at rogue/assassin 3 guarantees crits on surprised opponents . 
  and guaranteed assassinate crits also double your battle master dice, 
  their passive perception . 
  with high dex and expertise that should n't be a problem . 
  battlemaster is more reliable than extra 5 % crit and you can get some nice setups for future advantage / sneak attacks . 
  also , variant human = sharpshooter feat at lvl 1 . 
  goggles of the night give everyone darkvision , if your dm is nice enough . 
  i started my wife 's character at lvl 4 , she barely made it through the first dungeon . 
  she would n't , but i fudged one roll of bbeg . 
  i only modified one room ( the one with the most opponents ) , but decided to trim down for the future . 
  big number of opponents is a major problem , because when there are n't that many characters they get focused . 
  and they have fewer attacks . 
  later on she got kinda joined by sildar . 
  changed that part to give her an extra body to take hits . 
  i controlled him in combat so far , but i 'll give her combat control of him in the future sessions to make it more interesting . 
  i 'd say the main issue would probably be not balance but the fact that it 's always more fun in the party :d, 
  variant human  mobile is a great feat for rogue and pactlock focusing on hit and run . 
  lucky is always great . 
  ritual caster will round you up nicely if you go blade . 
  resilient ( con ) is also great - not so much in the beginning , but once you take lock levels you 'll love it because it will help you keep your concentration spells up when you 're in melee . 
  also , since you 'll be a warlock darkvision is not terribly important to you . 
  you can always pick up devil 's sight at warlock 2 , much better than darkvision and you can combo it with casting darkness at warlock 3 .
