  ua is not official game material , there 's always options to keep it basic only / phb only / phb +1 / published stuff only . 
  there 's nothing forcing dms to accept ua , and there are plenty of good reasons not to . 
  ua is ideas / playtest . 
  dms whom i know locally who allow ua tend to allow homebrew stuff as well , and are less concerned about the exact balance . 
  i do n't think they 'll get out a hardcover book with `` all the ua material '' . 
  some of it might see light of the day in another book , but my guess is it will be reworked and rebalanced from the way it is in ua . 
  ee player companion might be a free download , but it 's not ogl content , and therefore it ca n't be a part of srd . 
  as others have said , [ basic rules ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules ) are free . 
  you can download them , print them etc. 
  player 's rules are like a stripped-down version of phb , dungeon master 's rules are like a stripped down version of mm and dmg . 
  you might also be interested in getting the srd - the official version is [ here ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd ) , but [ some of the ] ( http://www.5esrd.com/ ) [ web versions ] ( https://www.5thsrd.org/ ) might be more useful . 
  basically , srd contains more options than basic ( though not as much as phb ) , but fewer explanations . 
  you can use 2nd edition characters to play a 5e game , but you should convert them . 
  [ here ] ( https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/dnd_conversions_1.0.pdf ) is a rather short guide on how to do it from wotc . 
  it covers all previous versions of the game . 
  converting them will be more like re-creating them in 5e , so for example you 'd use your new regular 5e attack bonuses ( proficiency + attribute ) instead of direct math conversion of the old ones ( 20 - thac0 + hit prob . / missile attack adjustment ) . 
  this will often result in 5e characters being more powerful ( e.g. 
  17 strength used to give melee +1 to hit and damage , now it gives +3 etc ) , especially combined with all the new stuff characters can do ( e.g. 
  cantrips , action surge etc ) . 
  there are plenty of things working differently in 5e ( action economy , spellcasting , surprise etc. 
  ) , be sure to give rules a good read . 
  while starter set is not required if you wish to run 5e , it 's a good investment . 
  i got it as a convert from 2e , and i 'm quite happy about it . 
  it 's an adventure of decent length and variety , relatively easy to run and play , and as a dm i found it gave me nice insight into pacing and balance of 5e . 
  i dipped only 1 in rogue with my monk for expertise and sneak attack . 
  most of the cunning action stuff can be duplicated by monk 2 + anyway ( though there 's a ki cost , and no hide ) , and i have the mobile feat ( excellent for monks ) which removes the need for fancy footwork . 
  cha is typically a dump stat for monks . 
  what would you do with your extra attack ? 
  if you can cast 9th level wizard spells , using regular attacks on that character will probably be very suboptimal in comparison to other stuff you can do . 
  if you used rapier , you 'd get 2 attacks for 1d8 + mod each ... or you can spam firebolts for free for 4d10 damage , from safe range , or you can use your spell slots to control the battlefield or blast for much higher . 
  may i suggest the following alternatives , all of which would work with 2 levels of fighter for action surge 1/short rest , and would give you 9th level spells :, 
  * warlock , blade pact - you get both 2 attacks with extra damage and a lvl 9 spell , plus you 're somewhat tougher than most wizards . 
  * sorcerer - metamagic , you can throw a quickened spell + a cantrip in a same turn , making this into two attacks . 
  this will work at range . 
   coffin room so they can see how many vampires are left, 
  this would eliminate the fear of the unknown and much of the horror mood . 
   trapped prisoners they can free, 
   any freed prisoners might turn into vampires later, 
  these are solid . 
  perhaps some of the prisoners might be charmed by the vampires as well ? 
  how about extra traps , which would try to disable / divide / trap party members ? 
   blood on the floor that makes evil replicas of themselfs ( so they would have future puzzles to avoid the blood ), 
  ok , could work ... 
   getting the big bad vampire to initially escape the players as they defeat him , but then only to be trapped at the dungeon 's entrance because he ca n't escape into the outside sunlight . 
  is the big bad vampire stupid / unaware of his condition ? 
  how about the fake big bad ? 
  one of his minions ( or lesser vampires ) impersonating him , and the big bad instead operates from the safety / traps the players / drops from behind while they 're engaged in fight ? 
  some other ideas :, 
  * darkness , let players use torches or darkvision - use the dim light rules , if they all rely on darkvision do n't give them the exact descriptions of e.g. 
  blood unless they investigate it , as they see it only in black and white, 
  * chilling screams in the background - maybe requiring a wis save if they want to rest, 
  * maze-like layout - have the layout to yourself and just describe directions to players , get them to map it out or not , either way do n't accept `` we go back '' unless they describe the way, 
  * a puzzle to open a part of the dungeon also closes the exit, 
  * vampires do n't need to breathe , players do - water/gas traps are nice for this , especially if triggered in combat, 
  * cultists / worshippers who wish to `` prove worthy enough '' to become vampires themselves, 
  there 's a part on building encounters in [ dm basic rules ] ( http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop/dm-basic-rules ) . 
  although if this is your first time , i suggest you take an existing adventure ( such as lost mine of phandelver from the starter set ) and maybe simply modify the geography to fit your own world . 
  regarding the party , it 's best to always start them in the same place . 
  that way you do n't have players waiting for the introduction . 
  `` you have been hired for the x job '' works . 
  you can build a lot of trouble for your changeling . 
  if he passes as an existing duke , perhaps that duke owns someone money , someone who 'd like to collect that money ... or break some knees . 
  if he 's passing as some other noble , perhaps that attracts unwanted attention from the local nobility and he gets treated as an enemy and/or spy . 
  perhaps someone notices a person entering a room and another person coming out , or the guards notice a person they did n't let in town , and they organize a witch hunt . 
  it can drive a lot of plot by itself . 
  just play as normal . 
  respect the player , of course . 
  but remember that the player came here to play d&d . changing the world into your vision of extremely socially progressive society with a lot of genderbending / gender-neutral stuff at every step might come off looking like a bit forced and weird . 
  i did n't play with trans people , but i played with a lot of gay and bi people ( had some games dmed by them too ) , and it was normal stuff all the time . 
  the game is a game , it will be attractive to people who want to play it . 
  however , if you insist and if you 're playing in forgotten realms , it might be interesting to introduce the [ church of eilistraee ] ( http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/church_of_eilistraee ) , a cg drow goddess . 
  most drow are matriarchal . 
  eilistraee 's clergy is too , but they allow males to join the clergy too . 
  the trick is that males have to dance the changedance , which turns them female , and they have to spend at least some time as female as a mark of dedication . 
  so effectively they are trans . 
  if you 're wearing heavy armor , you do n't need dex - and if you 're a barbarian , your abilities use str , not dex . 
  str also gives you athletics , which is an awesome skill , and you can grapple with it . 
  great weapon master can give you a huge bonus to damage - pathfinder 's power attack needs lvl 16 to give you a boost that big . 
  and you can reroll 1s and 2s on these damage dice if you have great weapon fighting style . 
  greatsword damage is very good for 5e , and in some cases it 's really top of the line ( e.g. 
  with eldritch knights using war magic and scag cantrip green-flame blade , gwm , assuming everything hits because someone set you up with advantage 2x ( 2d6 + str +10 ) slashing + 1d8 fire + 1d8 + int fire to nearby creature , at lvl 7 ) . 
  you 're playing 5e ? 
  which monster stats did you use , the ones from the adventure or the regular ones ? 
  what sort of items did you give them ? 
  18 dex monk is still very hittable . 
  also spells tend to mess them up . 
  with your current stats , i 'd get +2 cha . 
  more damage , better dc , more face . 
  you 're already quite durable for a caster with your stats . 
  remember , as a sorcerer - killing your enemies faster is the best defense . 
  stay in the back row . 
  at lvl 12 , i 'd consider either + dex / + con asi or war caster , depending on how your game continues to play . 
  whatever you get , get the other option at 16 . 
  make a bunch of pregen characters , run tomb of horrors . 
  when they die horribly and unfairly , give them the new characters which arrive as the second wave of adventurers . 
  and then third . 
  enjoy , 
  backstory is not a competition . 
  it exists to provide you and your gm some context , rp guidelines and potential plot hooks . 
  if it works for you , great .
