  with vtm , i know i can always rely on tensions , power play , statuses , boons etc. 
  which keep the internal social game going . 
  what makes the werewolves tick ( apart from the external enemy ) ? 
  what keeps the players engaged ? 
  planned format would be a one-shot event , sometime six months from now so there 's enough time to plan it nicely . 
  maybe a sequel , or continue doing it every few months ... 
  all advice welcome !, 
  i noticed the book is no longer available on dtrpg . 
  could they be [ rebranding it as vtr 2e ] ( http://theonyxpath.com/the-world-of-darkness-second-edition/ ) at the moment ? 
  hi folks , i 'm new to / r/coffee . 
  i 'm from croatia where the coffee culture is very strong , but also very different from what is described here . 
  so it might make an interesting read for you , 
  first of all , we have no coffee chains to speak off - the only one being mccaf\u00e9 , and it survives only because it 's attached to mcdonald 's . 
  no starbucks . 
  we had costa coffee , but it failed after a few years . 
  but we have an independant coffee shop on every corner . 
  in a five-minute circle around my workplace , there 's around 30 of them . 
  no food is served there , but alcohol usually is . 
  similar to italy , you can get an espresso , macchiato ( small and large , with the small one being in an espresso cup ) , cappuccino , and `` white coffee '' which has much more milk . 
  cups are typically small , usually 1 dl or smaller . 
  unlike in italy , we tend to drink our coffee very slowly ( 20 min - 1 h or more ) and socially ... we drink it with water on side ( usually comes free ) , and usually with friends . 
  `` let 's go out for a coffee '' is a typical way of saying `` let 's hang out and talk '' . 
  there is a small artisan coffee scene , limited to a few coffee shops . 
  take-out coffee is rare , and you usually wo n't find it in cafes but in bakeries or kiosks . 
  it 's rarely good , and sometimes it 's instant stuff . 
  at home , the most popular coffee is turkish . 
  stores are full of pre-ground turkish coffee - apart from instant , it 's the only one which you 're guaranteed to find in any store . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.franck.eu/media/images/brandovi/kava_brand_jubilarna_brand.jpg ) is probably the most popular local brand . 
  to most people over here , the producer is more important than bean origin , and they 're usually arabica/robusta mixes , dark roasts . 
  minas taste is very popular . 
  the turkish coffee pot is called `` d\u017eezva '' around this parts ( pronounced similar to turkish word for it - `` cezve '' ) . 
  very few of them are fancy , tiny copper ones - most of them are larger , cheaper and more practical [ stainless ] ( http://www.ebritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dzezva.jpg ) or [ enameled steel ] ( http://www.konzum.hr/var/plain_site/storage/images/proizvodi/sve-za-dom/posude-i-oprema-za-dom/tave-lonci-i-posude-za-pecenje/lonci-i-dezve-emajl/metalac-dzezva-crvena-4-kave/40144313-1-cro-hr/metalac-dzezva-crvena-4-kave_product_full.gif ) ones . 
  in a pinch ( or when cooking for a large number of people , or when camping ) , we can also make a coffee in a large pot . 
  this is how we usually prepare it :, 
  * add a single heaping teaspoon of coffee for every cup, 
  * add sugar per taste ( since it can be sweetened after , if you 're cooking for multiple people you always sweeten it according to the tastes of person who wants least sweet coffee - or no sugar at all , if someone prefers unsweetened ), 
  * stir , put on stove and wait ... do n't take your eyes off it , because it will pick the moment you do to boil over , 
  * when the coffee `` raises '' take it off , pour in a bit of water and wait a minute before pouring into cups, 
  * add any additional sugar or milk to taste ( some consider milk to be sacrilege in a turkish coffee ), 
  i prepare it a bit differently though , i use electrical kettle to bring the water to boil . 
  much faster results , 
  filter coffee ( drip ) is very rare . 
  it was sort of popular back in 80 's and 90 's as a status symbol , but nowadays it 's very rare , just like moka pots . 
  the novelty of drip machines wore off , filters were an extra cost and people were n't usually fans of the filter coffee taste . 
  people typically make turkish coffee at home , or they use instant , or they have an espresso machine . 
  everything else is virtually unknown and unused ( we got a french press as a gift for christmas and we love it - though it 's pretty much unknown piece of gear around these parts ) . 
  that 's basically it ... hope you found it informative , if you have any questions , feel free to ask , 
  so , i 've been lurking on this subreddit for a while , got some gear , beans and ordered my first grinder - which i just received today : [ hario mini ceramic slim ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-13jpbqaxspm/vmajij0asxi/aaaaaaaaijc/3qnz9v-hvhu/s1600/hario.jpg ) . 
  i have some freshly roasted coffee ( less than three weeks ago ) from a local craft coffee shop , a blend of costa rica tournon , guatemala shb , ehtiopia sidamo and india parchment ab . 
  for about a week now , i 've been grinding it [ manually in a mortar and pestle ] ( https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8qv4dpwwvca/vl40txeusni/aaaaaaaah5i/s0uyrwafwlw/w431-h766-no/mp3.jpg ) and drinking a flavorful cup of french press coffee . 
  today , i was testing out hario mini . 
  i turned it to 8 clicks , and [ ground some coffee ] ( https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-clusbr4bbdc/vmasfe6lhhi/aaaaaaaaikg/ui7xsqqbgs8/w431-h766-no/20150126_201310.jpg ) which i prepared in a moka pot . 
  i was blown away . 
  i 'm not sure if i 've done it completely right . 
  it ended up a bit bitter ... but it 's perhaps hard to describe it , but it was not the unpleasant kind of bitter . 
  perhaps there 's a fancy term to describe it , i do n't know . 
  but it was * flavorful * kind of bitter and acidic . 
  that coffee 's taste certainly packed a punch . 
  i have to say , both me and my wife were overwhelmed - i drank it black and sugarless , she put in some milk and sugar . 
  compared to cheap preground coffee which we used before , this just had so much more flavor . 
  it shocked me a bit , because my previous fp manual ground was very smooth ... but perhaps that one was underextracted ? 
  or this one got overextracted a bit ? 
  it 's still delicious compared to previous results . 
  grinders are awesome . 
  coffee is awesome . 
  / r/coffee is awesome . 
  i might or might not be on a caffeine high due to all the delicious coffee i 'm drinking . 
  i 've got some great beans from a local roaster . 
  i hand grind them in my hario slim , and make delicious mugs of french press coffee , or flat white / cappuccino / latte-like drinks with my moka pot . 
  i love it . 
  my wife loves it . 
  but when i 'm not at home , she makes herself instant coffee ... because it 's convenient for her ( i wake up earlier for work , plus we 're not really morning people ) . 
  she ca n't be bothered grinding , or even using pre-ground coffee . 
  so i was looking for a solution that would make real coffee but be convenient ( and inexpensive ) . 
  i 've been looking at programmable filter machines such as philips hd7459 , i could hand grind coffee in the evening and it would be brewed fresh as we wake up ... 
  i do n't know , i never used such a machine , are they ( in general ) worth it ? 
  got any suggestions and solutions ? 
  i started running last year , and after a few short weeks of ( very sporadic and bad quality ) training , i managed to complete my first 5k at 0:33:26 . 
  then i somehow stopped running as the weather got colder , i got sick etc. , so basically i have n't been running since november . 
  so after i got better i restarted exercising , but after trying out some cardio my endurance was quite bad after two months of mostly not training . 
  i 'd like to run 5k again ( and , hey , perhaps even a half marathon this autumn if everything works out ? 
  ) , so today during my lunch break i started c25k ( with zen labs app ) and did my w1d1 . 
  it was ... easier than i thought it will be . 
  lunch break and time before work works for me so i 'm planning to do m-w-f schedule . 
  i plan to do w1d2 tomorrow , while continuing to crosstrain with weights . 
  so , i 've got a question . 
  running that 5k undertrained was sheer hell that i barely pushed through , with everything aching and me sweating like a pig . 
  i would imagine it gets easier the more you train - my w1d1 warmed me up , but did n't get me drenched . 
  how do the later weeks feel ? 
  can you finish them without getting totally drenched in sweat ? 
  hey folks  i just learned today that this subreddit exists ... so i 'd like to share my story . 
  i 'm an oily hair guy , and i 've had some dandruff issue ( i used head & shoulders ) . 
  i learned about nopoo last summer , and decided to try it . 
  i went water only . 
  never used any other substances on my head . 
  the first month was really oily , but it got better afterwards . 
  my hair looks fuller now . 
  it 's also a lot firmer , and it maintains the same look and feel even if i do n't wash it for a while . 
  people think it 's conditioned . 
  it only feels extra oily when i 'm getting a haircut - which i 'm getting because my hair , which used to be limp , goes pretty wild now once it reaches the certain length .
