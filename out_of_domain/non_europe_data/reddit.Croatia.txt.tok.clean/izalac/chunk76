  i instantly get trusted more , smiled at more etc. 
  this was very noticable and shocking . 
  * people notice that i lost weight on an almost daily basis . 
  most of them are positive , encouraging and supportive but there have been some who told me i look too thin and that i should eat something and certainly not lose any more weight . 
  this started to happen approximately as i got to bmi 25 . 
  * after a year of training , a few days ago i was finally able to do 2 pullups . 
  it felt incredible . 
  the ability to do pull ups was my goal which seemed unreachable . 
  * i 'm no longer avoided by others in trams & buses . 
  people seem more comfortable standing closer to me than they used to . 
  * feels like my entire life changed and that i 'm watching it with different eyes . 
  * my teeth are better . 
  * my food bill is way lower . 
  potentially tmi , skip if you 're sensitive :, 
  * i wo n't go into detail , but love life is way better in pretty much every imaginable way . 
  * i sweat much less , and when i do i stink less . 
  i mean , i was never one of the guys who sweated all the time , but i would need a shower in the afternoon . 
  nowadays even if i do n't shower for 2-3 days i still smell better than i used to after one day . 
  * pooping is better . 
  there 's less of it , it 's not as stinky , and it 's easier to clean . 
  ** tl ; dr ** i lost 20 kg ( 44 lbs ) , gone from obese to normal range , feels like my entire life changed to the better . 
  i 'll continue eating right and exercising .

  [ here 's the after pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2pwfjap.jpg ) . 
  until today , my maximum in a single run was 7 km . 
  i did a long run today , hoping to do 10 km . 
  that 's when i started feeling awesome , and i. . . umm ... ran 19.15 km . 
  for the next 2 hours i was pale . 
  drank lots of water and apple juice , ate something salty . 
  felt very cold , shivered as if i had fever , and my left knee refuses to cooperate when i went downstairs . 
  it was a stupid thing to do . 
  i know it , and i knew it before i started running . 
  but it did feel awesome  now i think i should probably rest for a few days ... 
  i suffer from a general lack of air conditioning , and there 's a huge heat wave ongoing . 
  it just makes me want to lie down and do nothing except drink water and not sleep because it 's too hot to even sleep . 
  i postponed my workout to deep in the night ( since temperature is sort of manageable now ) , and my strength and focus are noticably down . 
  some of it is probably due to sleep deprivation , because it 's too hot to sleep . 
  anyways . 
  have you previously worked out in a hot environment ? 
  got any tips ? 
  i used to ride bikes when i was a kid and i loved it . 
  then i moved away from the city and sort of did n't do it for about 15 years . 
  i decided to give it another try several years ago during the recession when a store was having an all-out sale because it was going out of business , so i picked up 2 mountain bikes - one for me , one for my so - for a wonderful price of about $ 50 each . 
  several days later , the weather was nice enough for me to take this quality product to a 5 km test ride . 
  which ended up in a derailleur dying on me , seat falling out and handlebars bending , and that `` bike '' almost sending me to hospital several times as it kept failing . 
  since the store went out of business , i could n't return the bike so i donated it to my father-in-law who welded the parts which were falling out and got some use of it for about a year before it broke down completely . 
  after that wonderful experience , we did n't even bother trying the second `` bike '' . 
  it still sits assembled and unused after all these years . 
  our enthusiasm went down for years . 
  i only got interested recently , after moving back in the city , because now i 'm in the biking distance of my workplace . 
  i tried the local bike share program and found out that i enjoy biking to work . 
  so now i do - the bike share is my main way of commute now . 
  this also got me interested in owning a bike , to be less limited by time constraints , coverage and bike availability of the share program - but still mostly for the purposes of commute and city riding . 
  which gets me back to the remaining `` bike '' i own . 
  should i even bother getting it serviced ( i 'm not skilled in bike maintenance ) ? 
  can it actually be made into a safe road-worthy vehicle ? 
  or should i just get rid of it and get something better ? 
  it 's been sitting unused for about 7 years . 
  what i 'd want is a ride that 's road-worthy and reliable for as little money as possible , since i 'm on a tight budget . 
  i 'm also considering used bikes , but since i 'm generally clueless about bikes i 'd like to avoid overpaying a bike or buying a stolen one . 
  we 're also considering getting our son a bike for his 6th birthday . 
  training wheels or no ? 
  he already owned a wooden `` bike '' with no pedals , so ... 
  i 'm curious to what is a general consensus nowadays on the best way for kids to learn . 
  hello everyone , 
  i 've been practicing some martial arts for a couple of months now , and the dojo i 'm in includes some tsksr kenjutsu . 
  since we rarely do sword kata , i 'd like to learn some iaido to learn more about the sword , but currently there 's no iaido dojo in my entire country . 
  i 'm looking for resources ( websites , videos , books , manuals etc ) which would enable me to start practicing iaido at home ( as much as it can be learned alone ) . 
  i do n't have any preferences for school or style , as long as it 's quality , detailed instructions in both technical and mental aspects of iaido . 
  thanks . 
  [ removed ], 
  my gym is closing during christmas / new year , which means i 'll be gymless for almost 3 weeks . 
  i 'm on starting strength ( as well as some martial arts in that same place ) , and i do n't want to lose my gains . 
  is it possible to keep my lifting results ( or even improve them ) without a gym in that period ? 
  what would your advice be ? 
  at home i have a pullup bar , some light weights , and a bike which i use for commute . 
  i started running this spring , and finished a hm just over 2 months ago in 2:11 . 
  however , certain things in life happened including new hobbies , new job , new things in my schedule etc. 
  i have n't really been running properly since then , mostly since i found myself tired due to all the obligations . 
  i have n't been inactive though - my current weekly schedule is as follows :, 
  * 7 hours of biking - approx . 
  75 km/week ( i commute by bike , this is not a separate workout ), 
  * 6 hours of martial arts, 
  * 2 hours of gym ( strength training , i do this after martial arts ), 
  i sorted out some stuff in life , and also my gym/ma studio is closing during christmas time so i 'm hoping to get back to running starting from this weekend . 
  i have no idea about my current running ability , so here 's a few questions for everyone who might have had similar experiences :, 
  * how much will a 2 month break deteriorate one 's running ability ? 
  * is it possible to improve running in a meaningful way if there 's a lot of cross training involved ? 
  thanks . 
  it was played in croatia , hungary and usa at the same time . 
  somewhat arg-ish .

  before i started working out and eating right , i could n't help but notice my growing inability , inflexibility , random pains , tiredness etc. 
  looking at other friends and coworkers , i thought that this ( and weight increase ) was normal as i was getting older .
