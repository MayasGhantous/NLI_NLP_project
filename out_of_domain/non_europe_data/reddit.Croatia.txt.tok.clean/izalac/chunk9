  one of the larps i currently run has a leveling system , but which has a very flat power curve . 
  you start being able to do pretty much everything you can irl ( and a few more mechanical bonuses ) , but five years later you 're only slightly more powerful . 
  it helps that it 's a campaign that 's run once a year - i also have a weekly vampire game where players ca n't seem to get enough of the xp ... 
  but a peculiarity of that system is that it allows for specialization . 
  a lowbie might be able to do one thing well , while someone with 5x his xp will be able to do several things well but it 's quite likely they wo n't overlap and he still wo n't be an expert in a lot of things , while the lowbie will still be unique , useful and able to contribute in a meaningful manner . 
  eventually , they 'll start closing the gap because xp is capped monthly and the cap decreases after a certain amount of xp . 
  xp/level gain is addictive ( the more you get the more you want ) , and might be significant reason why someone plays ... and why someone fears character death and loss and rerolling . 
  in croatia , in the last two years several `` no level up '' larp systems got popular . 
  it drastically simplifies rule design and balance . 
  however , such systems got more delegated to one shot events as opposed to campaigns . 
  i believe that bulgarians actually use a non-leveling system for campaigns , shash1 can probably tell you more about it . 
  germans use a dkwddk system , which is ... umm , not really wysiwyg but a sort of a dramatic , theatricised version of it that also allows for creative magic and stuff . 
  i described it [ here ] ( http://www.crolarper.com/2014/06/dkwddk-mechanic-less-larping.html ) in better detail . 
  it does permit some advancement , but it 's very freeformish and it 's related to a character 's position and appearance - e.g. 
  an army captain should be tougher and stronger than a common soldier , and they 'll probably take more hits to drop etc. 
  but the exact numbers are fuzzy and never strictly defined . 
  germans play campaigns in that way too , afaik . 
  well , that covered a few options i believe , 
  i wrote a [ series of guides ] ( http://www.crolarper.com/search/label/start%20a%20larp ) that might help you while starting your own larp . 
  however , before you do that , are you sure there are no fighting groups in your area ? 
  if you 're in usa , you should be able to find amtgard , dagorhir or belegarth someplace nearby ( if not , they 're easy to set up and have plenty of guides on starting up ) . 
  or even sca ( yeah , not really a larp but it might be what suits you ) . 
  they typically do not advertise using common larping channels , but they have a list of chapters on their websites . 
  for combat larp , you can always recruit your friends , in your local rp channels ( forums , facebook , etc. 
  ) , perhaps to some martial artists , and certainly to students in campuses .

  they had only two events so far ( one in september , one in october ) . 
  both of these were prequel events , the regular campaign should launch next year . 
  [ their pics are available on facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.759165160811478.1073741840.561488080579188&amp;type=3 ) .

  well ... 
  i 'm overseas and i played games here  i do n't recognize most conventions of the arcane as something i 'm used to here , but perhaps they 're very heavily reinterpreted version of something familiar to me ... 
  still seems fascinating and very unique . 
  i know some of the staff , and if i lived nearby i 'd probably sign as npc and play it . 
  nope , i just know some of the staff and players . 
  but cramulus below seems to have attended from his response , might wan na ask him , 
  perhaps make magic something like a cultural thing ? 
  much like elaborate religious rituals and ceremonies that are often part of one 's life , and perhaps even law ? 
  ( such as weddings and funerals ), 
  personally , i 'd focus less on the rules - you could even [ completely handwave them away ] ( http://www.crolarper.com/2014/06/dkwddk-mechanic-less-larping.html ) and still get a game that works - and more about the types of stories you wish to tell . 
  if you have the same style of adventures , leveling and overall experience as your next door fantasy larp , and pretty much same mechanics despite different lore behind it , you 'll only end up looking like a reskinned version of the same thing . 
  political drama , inequality , exploitation , lack of resources , treachery , survival , hunger , sickness , violence , people displaced by the war ... etc. 
  would all make for some lovely themes , or even some low key drama : how does a family function and look like in that environment ? 
  all questions probably worth considering . 
  if you 're going for tournaments , why not just go for `` first hit '' , or `` three hits '' with added `` no headshots '' ? 
  way simpler and more easily manageable than a full battlegame system for your intended purpose . 
  i 'm a lowercase guy . 
  [ here 's my take on it . 
  ] ( http://www.crolarper.com/2012/09/commitment-to-lowercase-larp-instead-of.html ), 
  that 's interesting to hear . 
  some people from croatia heard about the `` lrp '' term several years ago , and started to use it in a derogatory manner , such as : `` your larp did n't really provide any action , so it does n't deserve to be called larp . 
  it 's just a lrp . '', 
  we did have a discussion about this , and provided some references - but that line of reasoning still exists . 
  when we play amtgard over here in croatia we mostly do a variant of capture the flag ( class battle ) . 
  a popular variant is when we mark a `` bridge '' that 's really the only way across - a chokepoint and a tactical objective . 
  hi , i wrote [ this guide ] ( http://www.crolarper.com/2014/08/these-10-easy-steps-are-all-you-need-to.html ) specifically to answer that question - read it and let me know if it helped  there 's plenty of larps in ohio , in various genres . 
  good luck !, 
  try running it as a larp instead ? 
  it scales better to the large number of players . 
  which state are you from ? 
  larpcore mentions [ aeryngale ] ( http://larpcore.com/area/kentucky/aeryngale/ ) . 
  there 's [ plenty of amtgard in kentucky . 
  ] ( http://www.amtgardrecords.com/atlas/state.php?stateid=17 ) [ several vampire games are also going on ] ( http://www.bynightstudios.com/?page_id=499 ) . 
  i 'll link you [ some advice which i always link to new larpers ] ( http://www.crolarper.com/2014/08/these-10-easy-steps-are-all-you-need-to.html ) . 
  seconded for larpcraft if you can find it nearby ( or start a group yourself ) , we have a group in croatia too and it might be what you 're looking for . 
  you can also shop around . 
  do a few larps . 
  heck , maybe play a few larps in parallel and play larp a for the fighting and larp b for the rp . 
  i 'm not really sure what to compare it with without a common frame of reference . 
  it depends on what you use it for . 
  it 's decent for turkish coffee ( though , it 's still a pre-ground coffee ) , and better than most other turkish-style blends sold here . 
  i cooked a pot of it to some turkish friends who liked it . 
  it 's not so good for moka pot though ( tried to make it there ) or anything remotely espresso-like . 
  so i would recommend it , but only for making turkish coffee . 
  there seem to be two , but they 're in remote parts of the city . 
  i 'll check them out when i 'm nearby . 
  however , they seem to be 3-4 times as much expensive ( or more ) as store brands . 
  i love it too  however , being the most affordable type of coffee around it 's often not highly regarded here . 
  it 's pretty much `` standard '' around these parts , not a lot of people get excited over it because it 's so common . 
  nope . 
  just coffee , water and maybe sugar . 
  i tried adding cinnamon once ( which i found somewhere on the internet ) but i did n't like the results . 
  personally , i drink turkish coffee with no sugar or milk . 
  espressos , i drink with both . 
  i was n't really much aware of such differences either , until i stumbled on [ this ] ( http://zablogreb.blogspot.com/2013/01/having-coffee-in-croatia-or-idemo-na.html ) blog post 2 years ago . 
  i 'll try getting some fresh beans , 
  homonyms [ can be interesting ] ( http://www.digdang.com/media/images/im_a_huge_fan_6815.jpg ) . 
  while we 're on the subject , most people who do home roasting here do it in the oven . 
  they do n't use colanders or cooling fans , instead they just put the tray out on the balcony to cool down , 
  low tech stuff , but gets the job done . 
  thanks for the compliment  and no , my first language is croatian , 
  different beans maybe ? 
  most people around here drink espressos with sugar and milk , so most of the espressos sold around are on the bitter side without it but they do blend well with sugar and milk . 
  i got hooked on french press after being gifted a small one ( though some decorative plastics on it broke when i poured in the hot water ... ) . 
  i bought a bigger one to cook coffee for more people - upphetta from ikea . 
  is it considered a good press ? 
  i 've heard that french presses tend to break - what are usually the main causes of breakage ? 
  being dropped , or something else ? 
  i have yet to visit eli 's , but i heard good stuff about them .
