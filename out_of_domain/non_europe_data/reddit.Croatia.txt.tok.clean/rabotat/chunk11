  i tried to find an objective estimation , but all i found are wildly different claims , from 83 000 , 300 000 , 600 000 up to 800 000 . 
  i did n't see any claims higher than that , though . 
  did n't realize this , but it was last month that this happened to me !, 
  rado . 
  i am sorry for what happened to you . 
  i know from experience that medical workers can be very mad at suicide attempts . 
  even now , 8 years later , just thinking about people 's reactions on that day is what bothers me the most . 
  [ op ] ( http://cdnb.20m.es/sinefectos/files/cerayi-1.jpg ), 
  i agree , but i still find it funny that a guy who spends his time writing racists ramblings on the internet feels olympic athletes are his inferior . 
  [ just the screens . 
  i had the one in the picture . 
  the joystick clitoris thingamingy got clogged with dust within 6 months and never worked right after that . 
  here are just the screens : http://i.imgur.com/bzhkmdt.jpg, 
  ima , dnevno.hr, 
  i was a complete idiot at 18 . 
  true , it 's a cold food , best enjoyed slathered in olive oil and eaten with freshly baked bread . 
  relative to body size . 
  in absolute terms they have 3 inches , or 8 cm . 
  samsung has several . 
  i do n't know the model , i 'll check it when i come home . 
  i ` ts not a smartphone , though . 
  edit : here it is : http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_c3350-4271.php, 
  they also have samsung made headphones , not sure if you can use some other , but it has a micro usb port . 
  i would n't know , i 'm at work and it was blocked for being `` historical revisionism '' . 
  i did n't even know we had a block like that . 
  i self harmed as well , and i must say i really dislike it when people dismiss it by saying `` oh , she just wants attention '' . 
  even if it 's true ( and it often is n't ) someone cutting themselvs for attention is still a very sad and harmful thing , and they really do need attention . 
  professional or otherwise . 
  / r/india truly has the spiciest drama . 
  i do n't know what a frosh girl means , but if google pictures is any sign , it 's a green cat wearing pink frog pajamas . 
  i 'm not sure how to put it . 
  a bit creepy . 
  yeah , she 's obsessed with being a strong independent person , no matter what , sometimes going to irrational lengths to show this . 
  and she also does n't like locke nearly as much as he does her . 
  and the rain wilds trilogy . 
  at my company it 's normal to work 06-14 . 
  i wake up at 03:50 every morning , since i have an hour and a half commute . 
  for me i think it 's worse that , if you 're lucky , you 'll get to grow old and feeble . 
  my last grandfather is in bad shape lately and i visit him on the weekends and help lift him , get him to toilet and so on ... 
  it 's depressing to think that is the best case scenario . 
  i honestly think i wo n't reach 88 , but it is still possible that i 'll nedd help to eat , turn in bed or wipe my butt . 
   boredom in everything, 
  boredom , apathy , lack of motivation and ambition and a lack of ability to emphatize with others ( except children , animals and fictional people ) can all be symptoms of depression . 
  sure there is , / r/shittankiessay, 
  i thought it might be makarska , croatia .

  ken m. confirmed . 
  most russian tanks in the last three decades have had three crewmen , and armata is not a deviation in this . 
  i do n't know where this 2 crewmen info is coming from , i heard it recently from my cousin too . 
  everywhere i checked it says three . 
   ancestors of people living in the himalayas or the andes likely went into the mountains much later, 
  sure , but they have some amazing adaptations . 
  [ link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high-altitude_adaptation_in_humans#tibetans ), 
     for some it was freed , for some it was occupied . 
    the same way sudetes were liberated from the czech in 1939 , right ? 
   did the germans who lived there not consider it liberation ? 
  stellar reasoning . 
  there was something remarkably like a cheetah . 
  [ this ] ( http://cdn.honeytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/fairwayshelf12.jpg?9deb11 ) pic is much more mildly not interesting . 
  i was brought to er , very drunk , having slit my veins . 
  the person stitching me up was angry with me , and among other stuff said : `` when i get patients like this i 'd gladly stitch them without anesthetics '', 
  i said `` go ahead '' and she did . 
  i did n't really care , as physical pain was something of a relief for me at the time , but as i remember it over the years it upsets me that she was that unprofessional . 
  not the pain part , the visibly being angry with me part . 
  yes , it was 8 years ago , i am doing much better , thank you . 
  if we 're talking themes , bfp4f had the best [ one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lcqnte4juy ) hands down . 
  true . 
  and your worth as a woman is directly reflected by the number of men you refuse to have sex with . 
   he fell in with a pigeon, 
  sounds like a dangerous pigeon . 
  it 's fine on my browser . 
  yeah , you might be right . 
  not that we do n't like it , it 's just not a thing . 
  in croatia you 'll find one store in 5 has any , and it 's only one brand , usually sticky and too sweet . 
  i was surprised to find that ajvar is not a thing outside ex-yu countries . 
  i always thought the `` standard '' condiments are ketchup , mayonaisse , ajvar and mustard . 
  common in the balkans , and probably turkey . 
   the standard grocery store stuff is just horrifyingly bland . 
  very true . 
  when i was reading the book i saw it as brandon trying to write a funny and clever character , and failing . 
  i loved the books otherwise , he should just get someone to help him with humour . 
  i agree completely . 
  he is a great writer and i loved his books , but wittines is not his strong suit . 
  so , how did you enjoy the last chapter of unsong ? 
   you can end the war, 
  no , you can enact a temporary truce , until you deal with alduin . 
  you can also pick sides after . 
   blades side-quests or recruitment, 
  ok , i see i 've been missing something . 
  maybe because i never killed paarthurnax ? 
   nazi 's are fighting post war tanks, 
  germans have post ww2 tanks as well , and as it is in the nature of the br system , every nation has tanks that served in ww2 fight later tanks . 
  in fact , in real life many ww2 type vehicles were used in cold war conflicts . 
   anyone who thinks the current situation is fair is quite frankly an idiot . 
  i do n't think it 's fair , i just think the imbalance is to be blamed on overly compressed and poorly thought-out br system . 
  and i do n't think germany suffers for it more than us , for example . 
   i 'm not at tier v with the us, 
  well , neither am i , but i got the impression from pepole around here that there are some problems .
