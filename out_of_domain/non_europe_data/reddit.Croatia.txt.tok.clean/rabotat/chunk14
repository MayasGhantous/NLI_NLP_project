  here are two reddit comments with a bit of perspective on that :,

  yep , this is like taking some right wing american book and pronouncing it `` the american agenda '' . 
  are you joking ? 
  sex is not food or water . 
  or maybe it 's `` i do n't want to have sex with you right now , and as i am not sure when will i want it again i will give you a guesstimate , so that you do n't ask me every day and i have to reject you time and again . '', 
  that 's a relationship advice site . 
  there is no consensus on what exactly is emotional abuse :, 
  `` as of 1996 , [ 3 ] there are `` no consensus views about the definition of emotional abuse . '', 
  as such , clinicians and researchers have offered sometimes divergent definitions of emotional abuse . 
  however , the widely used conflict tactics scale measures roughly twenty distinct acts of `` psychological aggression '' in three different categories :, 
  verbal aggression ( e.g. , saying something that upsets or annoys someone else ) ;, 
  dominant behaviors ( e.g. , preventing someone from contacting their family ) ;, 
  jealous behaviors ( e.g. , accusing a partner of maintaining other parallel relations ) . 
  also :, 
  `` several studies have argued that an isolated incident of verbal aggression , dominant conduct or jealous behaviors does not constitute the term `` psychological abuse . '', 
  rather , a pattern of such behaviors is a more appropriate scenario to be considered , unlike physical and sexual maltreatment where only one incident is necessary to label it as abuse . '', 
  in fact , nothing on [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychological_abuse ) or [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conflict_tactics_scale ) wiki articles mentions witholding sex as part of abuse . 
  it 's not really a reference . 
  to sell a bridge to someone is a common idiom in english , as you probably know . 
  in case you do n't : [ here ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=i%20have%20a%20bridge%20to%20sell%20you ), 
  it is essentially calling someone na\u00efve . 
  self image , i suppose , means that you are naively overconfident . 
  we do n't actually know how she phrased it , provided she exists and op is not a troll . 
   but now she cant see a light , so she has given up . 
  me too , thanks, 
  being angry with someone and not wanting to talk for a while is alright and not abuse . 
  the earth will be uninhabitable by humans within a hundred million years , and uninhabitable by anything within a billion . 
   space being finite, 
  how sure are you about this ? 
  also , i read ak as kala\u0161njikov , haha . 
  it still makes sense , though . 
  what did you do ? 
  well , they did . 
  just because legion is despicable , does n't mean we get to ignore alli ... uh ncr crimes . 
  true , except for the `` tide of overwhelming numbers '' . 
  plenty of [ them ] ( http://www.njuskalo.hr/?ctl=browse_ads&amp;sort=new&amp;categoryid=7&amp;modelid=11481&amp;modelid_level_0=11481&amp;modelid_level_1=0&amp;price%5bmin%5d=100&amp;price%5bmax%5d=3000&amp;locationid=&amp;locationid_level_0=0&amp;yearmanufacturedmin=&amp;yearmanufacturedmax=&amp;fueltypeid=0&amp;fuelhaslpg=&amp;motorsizemin=&amp;motorsizemax=&amp;motorpowermin=&amp;motorpowermax=&amp;mileagemin=&amp;mileagemax=&amp;airconditiontypeid=0&amp;transmissiontypeid=0&amp;gearnumberid=0 ) where i live for less than 3000 euros . 
  what ? 
  you are not joking ? 
  you think chemtrails are a thing ? 
  here 's the thing . 
  you said a `` chimp is a bonobo . '', 
  is it in the same family ? 
  yes . 
  no one 's arguing that . 
  as someone who is a scientist who studies apes , i am telling you , specifically , in science , no one calls bonobos chimps . 
  if you want to be `` specific '' like you said , then you should n't either . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  if you 're saying `` ape family '' you 're referring to the taxonomic grouping of hominoidea , which includes things from gorillas to orangutans to humans . 
  so your reasoning for calling a bonobo a chimp is because random people `` call the black oneschimps ? '', 
  let 's get baboons and macaques in there , then , too . 
  also , calling someone a human or an ape ? 
  it 's not one or the other , that 's not how taxonomy works . 
  they 're both . 
  a chimpanzee is a chimpanzee and a member of the ape family . 
  but that 's not what you said . 
  you said a bonobo is a chimp , which is not true unless you 're okay with calling all members of the ape family chimps , which means you 'd call orangutangs , gibons , and other apes chimps , too . 
  which you said you do n't . 
  it 's okay to just admit you 're wrong , you know ? 
  here 's the thing . 
  you said a `` trilby is a fedora . '', 
  is it in the same family ? 
  yes . 
  no one 's arguing that . 
  as someone who is an atheist who studies euphoria , i am telling you , specifically , in atheism , no one calls trilbys fedoras . 
  if you want to be `` specific '' like you said , then you should too . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  if you 're saying `` fedora family '' you 're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army , which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like myself . 
  so your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people `` say that only neckbeards wear fedoras ? '', 
  let 's get mountain dew and doritos in there , then , too . 
  i agree with you . 
  i also have a love-hate relationship with hpmor , with things i love and things i do n't in it . 
  one of the things i love is the rational approach , and fixing of the things from original ; among the things i hate is the arrogance . 
  and let 's be honest here , it 's not just a personality flaw that does n't have anything to do with the author . 
  ey obviously does think many of the things harry does . 
  if you read the authors notes you will definitely see some arrogance . 
  add to that the fact that ey is simply wrong about how some things work in canon , while mocking them with his superior science , that he is also often wrong about , and yes , it rankles . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/hpmor/comments/2zg0dq/actual_canon_modelling_flaws_in_hpmor/ ) is a thread . 
  i highly recommend reading that [ review . 
  it brings good points forward and puts concepts into words better than i could . 
  i know it is uncomfortable reading a criticism of a thing you like , and i liked hpmor , that 's why i 'm here in the first place . 
  but the review is honestly interesting , and if your goal is actually learning , as opposed to just being entertained , it explains and corrects some things that were glossed over in the fic . 
  a rational person should be able to consider a different point of view , after all , even if they do n't like it , 
  well , what do * you * call forced kissing ? 
  in [ 1964 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emergency_%e2%80%93_ward_10 ), 
  here 's google translate back to english :, 
  what the fuck did you say about me , you bitch ? 
  i 'll let you know that i graduated from the top of my class at navy seals , and i 've been involved in several secret forays at al-quaeda , and i have more than 300 confirmed deaths . 
  i am trained in the gorilla war and i am the top sniper in the entire us military . 
  you are nothing to me , but just another target . 
  i 'll clean it with the fuck accurately tastes that i 've never seen before on this earth , mark my fucking words . 
  do you think you can get away with this shit on the internet for me ? 
  think again , fucked up . 
  as i speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being mapped now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . 
  the storm that nullifies the pathetic thing you call your life . 
  you 're fucking dead , boy .
