  i can be anywhere , anytime , and i can kill you in more than seven hundred ways , and that 's just with my hands . 
  not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat , but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe its miserable butt from the face of the mainland , you little shit . 
  if only you could know what ruthless retribution your little `` smart '' comment was about to knock over you , maybe you would have kept your tongue fucked . 
  but you could not , you did not , and now you 're paying the price , goddamn idiot .

  you 're fucking dead , girl . 
  as far as i know `` o '' is pronounced like that in every european language , except english , due to the [ great vowel shift ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_vowel_shift ) . 
  a communist asiatic pro-immigration partisan and b-17 bombardier was teaching a class on joseph stalin , known rapist . 
  `` before the class begins , you must get on your knees and worship stalin and accept that he was the least evil being the world has ever known , even greater than rommel '', 
  at this moment , a brave , honorable , prussian aristocracy panzer ace who had destroyed 12,000 shermans and understood that slavs are n't europeans and fully supported all military decisions made by the wehrmacht stood up and held up a dead child . 
  `` is killing this kid a war crime ? '', 
  the arrogant war criminal smirked quite jewishly and smugly replied `` of course it is , you stupid german . '', 
  `` wrong . 
  he was within twenty miles of a partisan camp . 
  besides , we were just following orders and you ca n't really judge us because you were n't there and do n't understand how we 're just fighting for our country and how most of us hate the nazis anyway . 
  if this was a war-crime , as you say , it would 've been in dresden . '', 
  the partisan was visibly shaken , and dropped his ppsh and copy of the treaty of versailles . 
  he stormed out of the room crying those communist crocodile tears . 
  the students applauded and all subscribed to / r/history that day and accepted rommel as their lord and savior . 
  a tiger tank named `` following orders '' smashed into the room and stood guard next to the reich flag and shed a tear on a v2 . 
  infantry attacks was read several times , and guderian himself showed up and advanced science by 1,000 years . 
  the partisan was caught trying to rape berlin women and was arrested the next day . 
  he died of typhus and nothing else in a prison camp that had a swimming pool .

  i 've begun to realize this is where i 'm fat . 
  eh , it was n't a rag on op , i was talking about myself . 
  in retrospect writing it in quotes made that unclear .

  here 's the thing . 
  you said a `` cockatrice is a basilisk . '', 
  is it in the same family ? 
  yes . 
  no one 's arguing that . 
  as someone who is a scientist who studies basilisks , i am telling you , specifically , in science , no one calls cockatrices basilisks . 
  if you want to be `` specific '' like you said , then you should n't either . 
  they 're not the same thing . 
  if you 're saying `` basilisk family '' you 're referring to the taxonomic grouping of regulusae , which includes things from seaserpents to dragons to wyverns . 
  so your reasoning for calling a cockatrice a basilisk is because random people `` call the green ones basilisk ? '', 
  let 's get sirru\u0161u and wyrms in there , then , too . 
  also , calling someone a human or an ape ? 
  it 's not one or the other , that 's not how taxonomy works . 
  they 're both . 
  a cockatrice is a cockatrice and a member of the basilisk family . 
  but that 's not what you said . 
  you said a cockatrice is a basilisk , which is not true unless you 're okay with calling all members of the basilisk family basilisks , which means you 'd call nagas , pakhangbas , and other mythical reptiles basilisks , too . 
  which you said you do n't . 
  it 's okay to just admit you 're wrong , you know ? 
  if ukrainan is like most european languages it has different words for male and female virgins , so i assume the legend words it as female virgin . 
  edit : actually i checked it on google translate and it gives me the same translation for male and female virgins : nezaymana . 
  so , i was wrong . 
  lots of periods is all i see .

  should n't it be minus ?

  neither have i. 
  probably beacause i do n't listen to radio , i 'd have to go out of my way to find any song .

  the second one was surprisingly low budget . 
  i could n't believe it was officially in the same series . 
  the third one was like the first , only more . 
  i still ca n't tell how ironic they were trying to be .

  `` opsec is the process of protecting individual pieces of data that could be grouped together to give the bigger picture . 
  the process results in the development of countermeasures such as the use of email encryption software , taking precautions against eavesdropping , paying close attention to a picture you have taken ( such as items in the background ) , or not talking openly on social media sites about information on the unit , activity or organization 's critical information list .
