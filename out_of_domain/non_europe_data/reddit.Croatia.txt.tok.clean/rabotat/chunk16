  just fyi , ableist slurs on that sub include words like : `` crazy , insane , stupid , lame , dumb , idiot , moron . '', 
  it 's deleted in the sub , but is visible on the first page of your comment history . 
  i am not sure , but i guess so . 
  reminds me of the watch oath , from discworld .

  i am croatian and i was just thinking that all those number fit perfectly for my country .

  i love hobb 's characters , but they are often so stupid , and as you said the story is written in a way where it would be over in a day if they were n't . 
  still enjoyed it for other reasons , though . 
  the funeral was pretty original though . 
  they do , and the process they used to get lime juice included copper tubes . 
  copper , as we all know , reduces the vitamin c , so they got a lot of useless juice . 
  but by this time royal navy ships were so fast that no journey ever lasted more than a few months woithout seeing a harbour , so people never got scurvy anyway . 
  this proved to be a problem , because after a while everyone forgot that fresh fruit was a preventative , so when folks went on longer expeditions , for example trying to get to the south pole , they did get scurvy . 
  which re-ignitied the whole debate among physicians about what exactly causes it , when numerous theories emerged . 
  some thought it was caused by a bacteria that survived the canning process , since it was clear that eating preserved meats did n't prevent scurvy , whereas eating fresh meat did . 
  it took quite a while for europeans to rediscover the real cause .

  [ armed robbery ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w347mv4vn3w ) is jolly, 
  when it 's done while you 're afloat !, 
  hey , you 're the guy from the thread !, 
  even though i disagree with you , i must say you are good at debating , and it is obvious you have good understanding of philosophy . 
  you presented clear , well spoken arguments . 
  here is the [ link ] ( https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/prologue/ ) . 
  i also recommend it . 
   peregrine falcon is just so extremely aerodynamic, 
  i think i ` ts really the fact that the falcon can survive after hitting it 's terminal velocity . 
  exactly what i 'm saying . 
  this is why elephants are not on the list , even though they have a large terminal velocity . 
  edit : take my comment in context , the person i was replaying to said :, 
   i somewhat agree , but also each animal would have a terminal velocity . 
  i think it means that when you drop something in the atmosphere it will hit a maximum speed , because of drag . 
  the denser and more aerodynamic something is , the faster it falls . 
  my first comment was a joke , since jenus13 said :, 
   i somewhat agree , but also each animal would have a terminal velocity . 
  there 's a certain speed they will go and will no longer be able to go any faster . 
  they could tuck in their limbs and all to become more aerodynamic but only to a certain point . 
  peregrine falcon is just so extremely aerodynamic compared to every other animal and every other bird + has the ability to dive from such great heights . 
  horizontal speed could be a different graph by itself , sure . 
  as long as it 's stated . 
  so i made a joke . 
  `` i think i ` ts really the fact that the falcon can survive after hitting it 's terminal velocity . '', 
  which most animals will not . 
  hence why the falcon is on the list . 
  elephants will have a larger terminal velocity than mice due to square-cube law . 
  air resistance per unit mass is higher for smaller animals because they have more surface area compared to volume and mass . 
  no problem !, 
  since i live here i can shed some light . 
  dalmatia is covered in field stone walls because it has a very rocky soil , with little usable land . 
  so , over the centuries people cleared their fields by heaping rock into walls and terraces . 
  this was mostly to clear enough land to plant something , mostly vines and olive trees . 
  it had a secondary benefit of keeping that soil from being blown away by wind or washed away by rain . 
  also it is used as a marker between neighbouring fields .

  yes , there is little room for anything large . 
  it was a poor region historically . 
  recently turism has added a lot of capital for investment and infrastructure , though . 
  it 's not if you count gay sex . 
  or that gay men have significantly more sex . 
  i 'm not sure i follow . 
  let 's say 96 % of the population is straight , men and women of this population can only have an equal amount of sex . 
  then the only question that remains is who is having more sex , lesbians or gay guys . 
  if it is guys , by even a small amount , it turns out that men have more sex than women . 
  oh , i missed that , you 're right . 
  i 'm a bit late , but disabling autosaves makes your game more stable . 
  if you would like to increase stability you should make a new save every time , not save over old ones .

   selecting a hud secretary that thinks slaves were immigrants who came to america to follow their dreams ? 
  that seems very bad , let 's se what ben carson actually said :, 
   `` that 's what america is about , '' carson said . 
  `` a land of dreams and opportunity . 
  there were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships , worked even longer , even harder for less . 
  but they too had a dream that one day their sons , daughters , grandsons , granddaughters , great-grandsons , great-granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land . '', 
  he is a shitty person , wrong and so on , but it seems to me this was more him being awkward with his phrasing , than having a seriously skewed picture of history . 
  i may be wrong , though .
