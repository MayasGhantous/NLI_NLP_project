  he threw away the elder wand so that it does n't get trapped in time , presumably so that harry can take it . 
   she 's a bad teacher in canon . 
  we do n't know her teaching skills in the hpmor-verse though . 
  also do seers not remember their prophecies ? 
  do n't see why her teaching skills would be any different , since it was n't mentioned specifically . 
  and seers do n't remember prophecies , dumbledore listens in on her in some way , perhaps ? 
  there were razors before we knew how to work metal . 
  this is the bet solution by far !, 
  i love it , and i love you !, 
  it 's basically a finely ground crystal that abrades the exoskeletons , making their thorax dry up . 
  i guess i agree with you on that one . 
  a much as i hate cockroaches it 's not as if they have intentions , will or morals . 
  might as well hate cancer . 
  which i also do . 
  i do n't really care about hurting them , i just want them away from me , or dead . 
  same with mosquitoes and rats . 
  it can do some minor burns , but it 's hard to keep it so steady that it has time to do anything more serious in a single spot . 
  sky-rim is opposite of middle-earth . 
  it 's the haag , not the people . 
  a lot of serbian generals were sentenced in haag for war crimes . 
  some serbians see it as unjust , because `` everyone was doing it ! '', 
  there has been 100 billion people in history , only 93 percent of them died . 
  nije li to definicija autoritarizma ? 
   the money 's fault . 
  i do n't know if this was a typo , but it 's true . 
   two prostitutes and a fag . 
  if you redid `` gay '' why not `` whores '' ? 
  ugh , why did you have to remind me of him . 
  seriously , if that world was real i would anonymously tip off us government that nynaeve an rand have wmds . 
   little bit clumsy when the situation calls for it ? 
  and ridiculously agile in dangerous situations . 
  it 's a kebab . 
  i will eat it . 
  well ... 
  yes ? 
  of course it is . 
  it 's in many clubs here . 
  ugh i hate that shit . 
   btw i took a nasty smelly shit in grandmas bathroom , this got got me physically pushed outside and banned from the house . 
  you 're an amazing person !, 
  so ... at the end ? 
  it was raw . 
   my only complaint about the dresden files is the seemingly obligatory 2 page long descriptions about how much you have to believe in what you 're doing for the magic to be effective - i 'm 10 books in , butcher , i get it . 
  and why his car is beat up , and how cute and tough murphy is , and how mister adopted him , how circles work , who is bob and what does he do , how thresholds work , and short biographies of any recurring character he meets . 
  i just finished ghost story and i 'm not sure if i can take one more description of murphy . 
  oh , also , bob smirked which was impressive for a guy with no lips . 
  so sue me . 
  i guess every country has it 's own , it could be north ireland , south germany , some parts of poland who knows ? 
  i think netherlands or belgium have conservative areas as well . 
  i could n't watch even a single episode of the wire . 
  an i tried , too . 
  my neck , my back , khia i think . 
  it actually prolongs it . 
  this metaphor is falling apart . 
  ... is what i 'm saying . 
  read the chain again :, 
  - life is but a short hiccup in death . 
  - unfortunately drinking water does n't get rid of this hiccup . 
  - it actually prolongs it . 
  therefore drinking water prolongs life . 
  because now water is prolonging the hiccup which is not how it works . 
  `` ste '' is plural . 
  plural is used in formal speech , this would be alright . 
  for a friend this would be `` si '' , but since she is older than you `` ste '' is appropriate . 
  easy way to think of this is `` would i call that person sir , ma'am , mister , miss etc '' if yes , then plural , if you would call them by first name , then singular . 
  no problem . 
  croatia is realistically closer to slovenia , certainly not scandinavia . 
  you mean the khergit khanate . 
  yeah , but you mentioned dothraki which are more like khergits , than the sarranids . 
  you did , you just thought he was a lumberjack . 
  now actually translated instead of google translated :, 
  mac : on nema otrov . 
  to je mamac . 
  the son of toaa and satan , he does n't kill them though , just banishes them to fight each other forever , and then he recreats earth and revives everyone . 
  i do n't know how it is in other countries , but a go with a prostitute in germany ( where this is legal ) is under 50 euros . 
  or at least it was a couple of years ago . 
  there are brothels in any larger city . 
  no problem . 
  no problem . 
  no problem . 
  i love the dark brotherhood quests in oblivion . 
  although fighters guild and thieves guild is also ok , mage guild was not as great . 
  if you are interested in this concept the book is [ `` salvation war '' . 
  ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/literature/thesalvationwar ), 
  so , you hate hogwarts , is what you 're saying ? 
  not sure if this qualifies as fantasy , but there are demons and angels , and whatnot ? 
  but anyway , [ salvation war ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20880178-armageddon?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service ) and the sequel [ pantheocide ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20880203-pantheocide?from_search=true&amp;search_version=service ) . 
  they break a lot of cliches i dislike , are original and enjoyable in general and have a few tropes and elements i like . 
  i think the first was published , but i ca n't seem to find it anywhere .

  there will come a day when you will hug your grandma for the very last time , and chances are , you wo n't even know it .
