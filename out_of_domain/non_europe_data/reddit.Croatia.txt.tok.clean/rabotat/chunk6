  i 'd say it 's english that de-genderized it 's vocabulary . 
  as far as i know every european language has genders for nouns . 
  cows can be pretty smart , while also being dumb . 
  i was just thinking about isis the other day . 
  bearded men with strange religion and language coming to uk to murder , steal and rape their women ? 
  creating areas under their own law ? 
  they are the modern day vikings . 
  we have [ super hrvoje ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/super_hrvoje ) whose super power is rock throwing . 
  i agree on morrowind , but why do you hate oblivion ? 
  except for the stupid faces that game is pretty good , especially for it 's time . 
  maybe i liked it because it came in a certain period in my life and now i see it through rose tinted glasses , but i enjoyed that game immensely . 
  press the red button . 
  i recommend it . 
  i 'm croatian , and you can say this about any ex-yu country . 
  i agree with you , but i could never upvote something like that . 
  i did n't downvote , either , of course . 
  for a fun and relatively well written exploration of the theme read the [ harry potter and the natural 20 ] ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/harry-potter-and-the-natural-20 ), 
  he actually proposed a 25 percent tariff on chinese goods 5 years ago . 
  i see a lot of people dislike it when protagonists become over powered , but i honestly kinda enjoy that kind of fiction from time to time . 
  and what you call whish fulfillment porn is what i call a satisfactory end to a book or series where characters faced a lot of difficulties . 
  i honestly hate it when long works end abruptly : `` oh , yeah , after 10 000 pages we finally defeated the big bad , the remaining good guys now have some power and time to use it to better the world while their enemies are dead and the worst problems taken care of . 
  imagine what could happen . 
  the end . '', 
  in the same vein i * do * enjoy `` giving radio to the romans '' fiction . 
  i like world building and problem solving without action , combat and classic enemies , just the improving the world . 
  sorry if it sounded negative , i was actually just thinking about this the other day , and it seemed like an appropriate place to put those thoughts . 
  thanks , it 's what i ended up doing . 
  yes , of course . 
  every time . 
  thanks , i 'll try that . 
  thanks again , scanning for rootkits did the trick . 
  some have argued that japan really surrendered because the soviet union declared war right after hiroshima was nuked and invaded manchukuo and not so much because of the atomic bombings - after all , most japanese cities were already leveled by conventional bombing , what 's two more cities ? 
  it 's not conclusive , but there is a lot of debate about this , even today . 
  i thinks she is a great writer and i enjoyed a lot of her books , but i generally love intelligent characters , so yeah , i do get frustrated with that aspect . 
  also , i find long periods of recuperation and sickness very boring , and after awhile sad , tragic and fucked up things that happen to a character stop having emotional impact . 
  it was an airsoft . 
  possible . 
  but i do n't think you can carry a firearm around in sweden . 
  not an expert , though . 
  his name is ivan . 
  ivane is vocativ . 
  well , honestly vocabulary is more important than grammar . 
  if you just string a bunch of words together that have the meaning you want most people will understand it . 
  especially since in croatian the order of the words is not so important . 
  to add to that croatian grammar is pretty complicated and even foreigners who have lived here for a long time have problems with clauses and genders . 
  so my advice is really just to cram the words , as boring as that is . 
  edit : using google translate , form english to croatian should be enough for your purposes . 
  yeah , i am trying to learn german and am having some trouble with remembering which gender is for which word , not to mention when is `` den '' in akuzativ , and when it is something else . 
  btw , croatian genders are relatively easy . 
  in nominativ , if a word ends with - a it is almost always feminine , - e is almost always neutral , - o is very often neutral , except with personal names . 
  if it ends in something else it is usually masculine . 
  it 's dativ in plural . 
  and yeah , there only a few loose rules about genders . 
  hahahaha , [ yeah !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/7a6dwv7fcjg?t=1m57s ), 
  in the movie it was a 7.62 \u00d7 54mmr from a mosin-nagant . 
  not very relevant , but i remembered , because the fat guy talks about his rifle a couple of scenes before this . 
  which means we 're due , and soon . 
  well i , for one , like roman numerals . 
  the picture , for those who ca n't see it https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s4m5nytp9di/maxresdefault.jpg, 
  no , but his favourite power ranger was the white one . 
  as far as i know that is not a prevailing theory , but an un-tested remark in a conclusion of a single research ( that involved soaking feet in cold water as a test ) . 
  since they did n't find any corelation between respiratory cold and cold feet , they suggested that as an alternative cause . 
  also , here is an article with some relevant info : http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/there-scientific-reason-cold-weather-could-cause-colds-180953817/?no-ist, 
  i think this whole `` cold weather does n't cause cold '' thing only spread bacuse people like feeling smarter and better informed than others . 
  to be honest i believed it myself , before i researched it a bit . 
  deathclaws stomp . 
  i have fallout 4 and witcher 3 . 
  i 'd like to see geralt with a gauss rifle . 
  um ... we are not the ones touching them . 
  i 'm ^ joking ^ i ^ do n't ^ give ^ a ^ fuck . 
  if i was american i would have so many guns and so little money . 
  yeah , me too . 
  any word the author invented instead of using a real word is a bit irritating to me . 
  [ ( relevant xkcd ) ] ( https://xkcd.com/483/ ), 
  the way i see it , any fantasy world has different languages , and they are just translated into modern english , in a way we can relate to . 
  where i am from what i think americans call burpees we call `` marines '' . 
  where you jump after every push up ? 
  shark is commonly eaten where i live , it does not taste or smell bad . 
  i suppose it depends n the species . 
  maybe you could try explaining it with your mind ? 
  what about naked mole rats ? 
  are they an outlier ? 
  as far as i know that wiki is both the source material and the encyclopedia . 
  no , i think many people searched for their own first , then skipped down . 
  this is , unfortunately ,, 
  not true . 
  also , we are talking 1939 here , so panzer iii is the tank , no tigers or panthers yet . 
   mg42s, 
  not in 1939 . 
   `` sanctuary '', 
  `` sanctuary '' . 
  so , you 're the pretty one ? 
  or did your mother just not care for your sister ? 
  i spilled concentrated sulfuric acid on myself , died of the burns later that week in the hospital . 
  i do n't know american degrees , but in celsius boil your brain is over 42 . 
  so 40 is still safe . 
  or [ amon amarth ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/versus_the_world.jpg ), 
  i expected him to don a red shirt and go serve on voyager . 
  why is his mother so sad , then ?
