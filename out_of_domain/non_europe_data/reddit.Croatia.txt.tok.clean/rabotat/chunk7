   almost each story is back to what it was : logan on the run, 
  this was , in fact done very symmetrically , in the beginning he is cold from falling in the river , having just lost all his friends , and i do n't remember , but i think he had nothing on him except a knife or something like that . 
  i did that as a kid . 
  it 's amusing , foreskin is very stretchy . 
  you got philosophical about this . 
  it 's a linguistics issue . 
  words have meaning , the meaning is the one most people use . 
  botanically speaking tomatoes , bell peppers , cucumbers , beans , squash , egg plants , zucchini , etc. 
  are fruit . 
  culinary speaking they are vegetables . 
  what do people picture when you say vegetable ? 
  [ example .

  word . 
  they did , however , have belowdecks , of a [ sort ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/wikingerschiff_oslo.jpg ), 
  i work with lysate extracted from their blood . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/limulus_amebocyte_lysate ) is what we need them for . 
  before this method most companies ( including mine ) used living [ bunnies ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/depyrogenation#pyrogen_detection ) . 
  so i see this as progress . 
  in short , one of the methods mentioned is the gel clot . 
  this means that in presence of pyrrogens lal reagens clots and becomes gel . 
  so we have standard solutions of bacterial endotoxins ( chemicals from dead escherichia coli cells . ), 
  so i put a specific amount of lal in two test tubes , with a sample . 
  in one i also put a specific concentration of the endotoxin standard . 
  i leave it for an hour on 37 degrees , and check if it clotted . 
  if the negative control did n't clot and the positive did now i know that this sample has less endotoxins than that specific concentration . 
  by using different dilutions of the standard i can determine at which point the sample with lal becomes gel , so now i know how `` dirty '' the sample is , and if it 's clean enough to go into peoples bloodstream without causing high temperature etc. 
  to be honest a lot of guys take imgur 's frontpage results and repost them to r/pics and r/funny . 
  so when they get a lot of views imgur gets to see them again , within hours of being posted , because that 's how their frontpage works . 
  she is severely malnourished , slightly below average height for a woman , i think i can take her . 
  maybe she can run away , because she is into sports , especially long distance running . 
  sure , but from their perspective it means a lot of double posts , which nobody likes . 
  yeah , but the guys sharing that picture on reddit could just use that link , and this would n't happen . 
  instead , they rehost it on their own account , i guess to make it look as if it 's their pic ? 
  i 'm not sure why .

  so , you 're saying you know nothing about 18th century ? 
   no idea what would be up at 37,000 feet to run into . 
  `` r\u00fcppell 's vulture is considered to be the highest-flying bird , with confirmed evidence of a flight at an altitude of 11,300 m ( 37,000 ft ) above sea level . '', 
  `` a r\u00fcppell 's vulture was confirmed to have been ingested by a jet engine of an airplane flying over abidjan , ivory coast on november 29 , 1973 at an altitude of 11,300 m ( 37,000 ft ) '', 
  i would n't know , i just like birds . 
  it 's relatively safe because of lots of padding and good armor . 
  weapons are full weight , or even a little heavier than historical , because they are blunt . 
  win condition is having everyone in the enemy team fall , at least on one knee . 
  you do n't have to fall when hit , it happens ... organically . 
  chafing is fine , lots of padding . 
  no wenches , although most groups have women as part of reenactment . 
  i do n't know any women who compete in the melee , but there are some pretty good ones in duels . 
  maybe vaginalette ? 
  not every sarcastic comment needs an s . it should be fairly obvious . 
  i also keep things from my mom because she 's a perpetual worrier . 
  but my dad is a snoop , so he finds out anyway . 
  happily he does n't tell mom , because she is a perpetual worrier . 
  psyllium husk is in metamucil . 
  to better blend in , as that is their purpose . 
  the institute has little problems creating synths , they use them for everything , even janitorial work !, 
  it 's easier training humans for any of it . 
  if synths are almost indistinguishable from humans , and the covenant questline seems to indicate that they are , it appears to me that it would be quite easy to make synths who age . 
  and some which do n't , of course . 
  dogdashdash was agreeing with you , i believe . 
  in april 1986 , following an attack on american soldiers in a berlin disco , president reagan ordered the bombing of muammar qaddafi 's terrorist camps in libya . 
  my duty was to fly over libya and take photos recording the damage our f-111 's had inflicted . 
  qaddafi had established a ` line of death , ' a territorial marking across the gulf of sidra , swearing to shoot down any intruder that crossed the boundary . 
  on the morning of april 15 , i rocketed past the line at 2,125 mph . 
  i was piloting the sr-71 spy plane , the world 's fastest jet , accompanied by maj walter watson , the aircraft 's reconnaissance systems officer ( rso ) . 
  we had crossed into libya and were approaching our final turn over the bleak desert landscape when walter informed me that he was receiving missile launch signals . 
  i quickly increased our speed , calculating the time it would take for the weapons-most likely sa-2 and sa-4 surface-to-air missiles capable of mach 5 - to reach our altitude . 
  i estimated that we could beat the rocket-powered missiles to the turn and stayed our course , betting our lives on the plane 's performance . 
  after several agonizingly long seconds , we made the turn and blasted toward the mediterranean ` you might want to pull it back , ' walter suggested . 
  it was then that i noticed i still had the throttles full forward . 
  the plane was flying a mile every 1.6 seconds , well above our mach 3.2 limit . 
  it was the fastest we would ever fly . 
  i pulled the throttles to idle just south of sicily , but we still overran the refueling tanker awaiting us over gibraltar . 
  scores of significant aircraft have been produced in the 100 years of flight , following the achievements of the wright brothers , which we celebrate in december . 
  aircraft such as the boeing 707 , the f-86 sabre jet , and the p-51 mustang are among the important machines that have flown our skies . 
  but the sr-71 , also known as the blackbird , stands alone as a significant contributor to cold war victory and as the fastest plane ever-and only 93 air force pilots ever steered the ` sled , ' as we called our aircraft . 
  as inconceivable as it may sound , i once discarded the plane . 
  literally . 
  my first encounter with the sr-71 came when i was 10 years old in the form of molded black plastic in a revell kit . 
  cementing together the long fuselage parts proved tricky , and my finished product looked less than menacing . 
  glue , oozing from the seams , discolored the black plastic . 
  it seemed ungainly alongside the fighter planes in my collection , and i threw it away . 
  twenty-nine years later , i stood awe-struck in a beale air force base hangar , staring at the very real sr-71 before me . 
  i had applied to fly the world 's fastest jet and was receiving my first walk-around of our nation 's most prestigious aircraft . 
  in my previous 13 years as an air force fighter pilot , i had never seen an aircraft with such presence . 
  at 107 feet long , it appeared big , but far from ungainly . 
  ironically , the plane was dripping , much like the misshapen model had assembled in my youth . 
  fuel was seeping through the joints , raining down on the hangar floor . 
  at mach 3 , the plane would expand several inches because of the severe temperature , which could heat the leading edge of the wing to 1,100 degrees . 
  to prevent cracking , expansion joints had been built into the plane . 
  sealant resembling rubber glue covered the seams , but when the plane was subsonic , fuel would leak through the joints . 
  origins, 
  the sr-71 was the brainchild of kelly johnson , the famed lockheed designer who created the p-38 , the f-104 starfighter , and the u-2 .
