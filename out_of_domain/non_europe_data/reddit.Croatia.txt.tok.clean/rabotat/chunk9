  what have pandas ever done to you ? 
  i do n't think we spend * that * much on pandas , and anyway it 's not an either/or situation . 
  i made it up to 30 second mark . 
  this is really ... 
  i mean , someone had to think about it , write a script , have rehearsals and so on , and all that to produce this . 
  incredible . 
  i do n't want to know . 
  alright , buddy . 
  for you , i 'll try . 
  edit : hahahaha !, 
  it was going worse and worse , but the ceo really saved the day !, 
  he is being pedantic , and also wrong . 
  yes , it 's called venom when it is injected , not ingested . 
  but it is poison in both cases , venom is a subset of the word poison , not something different . 
  poison is not necessarily venom , but all venom is poison . 
  here is merriam-webster dictionary definition for venom : poison that is produced by an animal ( such as a snake ) and used to kill or injure another animal usually through biting or stinging, 
  venom is not a different thing from poison , it is a subset of that word . 
  labeled for [ convenience ? 
   it is german ww2 tanks that are generally portrayed in an overly-positive light . 
  sorry to butt in here , but could you tell me what do you think where this myth stems from ? 
  i mean , before i went deeper into it i honestly believed it was a historically accepted fact that the nazis had the best tanks and planes , especially fighters . 
  and i noticed a lot of people on the internet thought so as well . 
  imagine my surprise when i found out this was n't the case !, 
  so , i thought about it , and i believe that my preconceptions came from sensationalized history channel-style documentaries . 
  but , i am not sure if this is true . 
  i 'd really like to know how did this myth form and why is it so prevalent ? 
  thanks . 
  i actually thought about posting a question like that on / r/askhistorians , but was n't sure , i 'll check if it 's been asked already . 
  there is [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/21boyl/when_reading_about_wwii_you_often_hear_that_the/cgbnej2?context=3 ), 
  true . 
  oh , i missed that you already asked it . 
  mine does n't , but it has \u0111\u0107\u010d\u0161\u017e, 
  honestly , i think i 've never seen a fixed showerhead in my life . 
  is this very common in other countries ? 
  that having been said , you should not interact with your students orally , except to talk . 
  did you confuse me for / u/christianmunich ? 
   `` back to sleep '' campaign, 
  the safe to sleep campaign , formerly known as the back to sleep campaign , is an initiative backed by the us national institute of child health and human development ( nichd ) at the us national institutes of health to encourage parents to have their infants sleep on their backs ( supine position ) to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome , or sids . 
  since `` safe to sleep '' was launched in 1994 , the incidence of sids has declined by more than 50 % . 
  it 's not so clear cut . 
  well , having superior firepower seems like the most important thing in a tank . 
  but panthers and tigers were pretty shit in every other aspect . 
  croatian translation of the first star wars book . 
  they translated jabba the hutt as `` jabba called the shed '' . 
   three highest vehicle 's br, 
  did they change that ? 
  because , when i started playing only your highest br . 
  vehicle mattered in gf . 
  ah , thanks , i misunderstood that . 
  what does he mean by that ? 
  i mean , why the three highest ? 
  three highest vehicle 's br of * every * player '' sounds to me as if he was talking about three highest vehicles , not three highest players . 
  my advice is : stick with your starting nation , at least for a time . 
  you said you picked russians . 
  good choice , especially for a newbie , they can be forgiving of mistakes more than other nations . 
  it is fun to play with all nations , and i do suggest you try them , but concetrating your plays time on a single one lets you level your crews more quickly . 
  crews are not transmissible between nations !, 
  and leveling them is important , and you have to appoint the points manually . 
  also , climb at the start as high as you can . 
  good luck !, 
  but , for shame !, 
  you did n't even upvote the guy who made the gif . 
   he might think that brs work in ground rb work as brs in air ab, 
  that 's what i thought , but was unsure if they did n't change something recently . 
  also , as this seems to be rb , and the first screenshot is from the beggining of the match i would guess they did use their best vehicle . 
  honest question about bombing . 
  what counts as base ? 
  i always try to hit the airfield , did n't know buildings count ? 
  also , i get a really minuscule amount of points , how is that even worth it ? 
  or is that because i use early bombers so i do n't have all that many bombs ? 
  to be honest t-34 was pretty op in war thunder for a while there . 
  thanks . 
  i know it 's a joke , but it 's meant to be the [ `` greater serbia '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greater_serbia ) , which was the reason serbia attacked croatia . 
  that sounds a lot to me , but i am not american , so i would n't know . 
  but i think she gets free board and room , and does n't have to pay any bills , so this seems reasonable ? 
  my favourite book of his is `` pounded in the butt by my book `` pounded in the butt by my book ` pounded in the butt by my book `` pounded in the butt by my book ` pounded in the butt by my own butt ' '' ' '' ( may 8 , 2016 ) '', 
  it will butterfly anyway , because of the aranea and mercenaries that were ejected , not to mention the red robe . 
  and yeah , also the demons and gods . 
  yes , that is the case .

  star wars spacecraft can cross the entire galaxy in months . 
  i think star trek spacecraft are a lot slower . 
   it 's very very mild, 
  i am very happy for you . 
  a middle school classmate of mine had cerebral palsy . 
  she died last month of complications . 
  she could n't walk since childhood , though . 
   they could n't ` fix ' my being deaf in one ear, 
  so you can hear on one ear ? 
  do you use sign language ? 
   they say the words light speed all the time, 
  i do n't understand what you mean by this . 
  in star wars they use [ hyperdrive ] ( http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/hyperdrive/legends ) which is faster than light . 
  as far as i know star wars craft are significantly faster than star trek , as shown [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/map_of_the_week/2013/05/star_trek_enterprise_vs_star_wars_millennium_falcon_which_ship_is_fastest.html ), 
  both franchises are science fiction , neither is realistic .
