  the best punk song there is , a perfect song . 
  garcia plays kyuss tomorrow in rijeka , croatia . 
  go ahead ... mate ? 
  friend . 
  yes , the state hates jobs and the well being of its citizens !, 
  description changed to accomodate you . 
  oh god , i remember i was a kid when this started , just barely knew what linux meant . 
  today i work for an it magazine . 
  as a croat , i 'm cheering for you guys . 
  there was a guy on reddit who wrote a long and interesting comment on the crowd that uses 4chan and how they got there . 
  i ca n't find that comment right now , but i remember that it was a very interesting read . 
  i 'd buy that book . 
  hvala i tebi , i 'm keeping my fingers crossed . 
  did you see this ? 
  croatia is currently the 10th on the fifa world rankings list , but did we deserve to go ... 
  i 'm not sure . 
  anyway , we got a lesson in modesty . 
  sneak in ? 
  gosh , is everyone so naive that they think that those references are n't there on purpose . 
  also , the director of the video is the highly talented jonas akerlund so i do n't know why he does n't get any credit for it . 
   the scp foundation, 
  i just went there and ... 
  i 'm not sure what i saw . 
   i think this is what you are looking for . 
  yes , yes it is . 
  it was a great post , worthy of more than just a repost .

  i thought the war died down a decade ago . 
  why do you think he 's a democrat ? 
  being liberal does n't have to do anything with joining a party . 
  that kind of thinking is what brought the us to the current two party system . 
  i 'm sorry for aussies , but the headline is total sensationalist bullshit . 
  fell free to check out [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:internet_blackholes.svg ) map which shows more than one country restricting web access . 
  i hope you 're capable of delivering an answer to that statement , not just a snotty remark . 
  hello there . 
  i noticed you posted a personal army request connected to the ** us ** national guard banning filming of birds on the ** us ** coast in a subreddit dedicated to ** world ** politics . 
  please , contain us centric news in the rest of reddit , not one of the rare subreddits made for people who do n't care about us politics . 
  the best president the us never had . 
   instruction manuals are generally written at a 3rd grade level . 
  the washington post is written at an 8th grade level . 
  the wall street journal is written at a 10th grade level . 
  is that your guess or a fact ? 
  is there some data for other mediums ? 
  yeah , but he was ... you know ... black . 
  thanks , i 'll check it out . 
  oh damn , was expecting rick astley . 
  love the black keys and recommend radio moscow for other fans . 
  write about music and technology . 
  best be joking ... 
  blame sprint , not htc . 
  they forced it out before it was ready . 
  also , blame the fucking battery makers who have n't made a single step forward for years , while the need for energy and expectations are rising, 
  fucking hell ... americans , get over yourselves . 
  this happens all of the time and you are n't on a high pedestal just because you did n't lynch the referee . 
  and for a country that does n't care about football , i present to you the next three days of us rage all over reddit . 
  he did n't question the ideals behind any side here , but right or wrong , the ira was a terrorist organization , even though i 'm on the irish side in this conflict . 
   6 - france vs. croatia , france 1998 semi-final, 
  the only time football almost made me cry . 
   places tinfoil hat on head and what will britons do if their government needs to be overthrown - there is a reason that dictators do n't allow the populace to arm - ask the poor iranians who protested their election results what it meant to go up against the armed police with rocks . 
  cite me an example where an armed population and guns helped to overthrow a government in a western industrial country . 
  and if the iranians had guns there would be massive bloodshed on the streets , and after that fraction battles in every village with tens of thousands dead and the government would still be in power , unless you can train rioters to drive helicopters , planes and tanks . 
  why do americans think that every gun owner would be responsible ? 
  you always have romanticized visions of the tyrannical government killing your rights and then you topple it in a revolutionary manner , saving the day . 
  what if , let 's say , teabaggers or birthers or any other right wing fraction decides to pick up arms against a government they see as tyrannical ? 
  would you give them that right ? 
  khm , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war, 
  some people think wrestling is real . 
  although he did n't present it very well , i get the point . 
  we do n't want to be patronised and do n't want gamer girls , but rather girl gamers . 
  not olivia munn that is a hottie first and a gamer second ( or third ... ) , but someone who knows his/her shit . 
  after that the gender is n't important . 
  a good analogy would be car shows . 
  i 've seen hundreds of them with women reading off a script , but top gear has three unattractive middle aged men and the show rocks . 
  granted , it is entertaining for a number of different reasons , and the three of them are not the greatest car experts alive , but the show caught a great middle ground . 
  the hosts can be identified with , they have fair knowledge and they know how to present . 
  that 's what missing in the gaming world . 
  me too . 
  where did you see them ? 
  god i love that show . 
  and sam . 
  parents were hippies i presume . 
  does n't matter to me though , i 'll take her like that . 
  so what ? 
  it 's funny and related to gaming . 
  look at [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idlg6jh23ye ) ad and tell me that it 's not better than some movies made today . 
  upvoted for doing the same thing i am . 
  you used to be cool 2000 years ago , what happened ? 
  i thought the guy that fucked that geldof chick proved that once and for all . 
  and he was a ginger . 
  my first one had an mmc reader and 32 mb of memory . 
  i remember upgrading to 96 mb and converting my songs to wma to have as much song on it . 
  bitchin ' . 
  do n't forget that myspace was n't big everywhere , while facebook is pretty much dominating worldwide . 
  maybe a couple of my friends had a myspace profile , while at the moment i have more than 200 friends on facebook . 
  i feel tired just reading this . 
  i ca n't believe something so ignorant is being upvoted .
