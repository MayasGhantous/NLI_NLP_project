   heart-shaped island in croatia, 
  i actually passed there three days ago , when on a ferry . 
  does n't look impresive from the ground . 
  if you give me 5 minutes to get a witty insult i would find something better , but in other situations i 'll use what i have . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ztyax.jpg ) is the best guide to the usage of the word . 
  but ... but ... 
  the facial hair !, 
  i was trying !, 
  as someone who was sued for something similar in europe , i agree with this . 
  europe has different standards than the us , and their kind of free speech is n't suited for this continent . 
  i have a huge amount of bookmarks that do n't even get synced by opera link , not to mention notes , settings , toolbars , hacks and mods . 
  every upgrade is about an hour of work just to get everything the way i like it . 
  yup !, 
  god damnit , that woman should have killed herself a dozen times . 
  if she did it before ( she did ) kurt , maybe she would be remembered as something , now she 's just a hasbeen rag . 
  a disgrace for her daughter and herself . 
  ( i 'm sorry , i 'm just pissed because i had to review last hole 's album ), 
  i 'm sort of glad pixies broke up . 
  with the reunion they do n't have much pressure to make new material and kill the memory of their best stuff , when they were active . 
  here 's hoping to see them ... 
  i watched all of them , about 20 or so . 
  they are awesome , the definition of a great ad . 
  awesome boots , right there . 
  how is this legal ? 
  being in a union is a basic human right in most european countries . 
  it 's called globalization . 
   what can the government really do when they offer them free education and they do n't take it ? 
  in my town they got free apartments . 
  45 to 80 sq meter new apartments in new buildings next to people who bought the apartments from working half of their life or getting loans . 
  they ransacked the apartments , took everything from windows to cables and destroyed the common staircase and elevator . 
  that 's next to free education and healthcare . 
  pray tell , what was the sound of that like ? 
  i 'd do it . 
  ( if i were n't around 4 and a half thousand miles away ), 
  shut your mouth !, 
  also , i never got what 's the problem with spelling it phoenix . 
  are you suggesting the us political system is better than the swedish ? 
  seriously ? 
   when dave grohl of the foo fighters heard of the miners ' request to have the band 's music sent down on mp3 players , he issued a personal message via fax to them indicating he would meet them for a beer . 
  consider them a somewhat more liberal version of the us republican party . 
  in germany a gay minister is second in command in a coalition government led by the christian democrats . 
  weezer and metallica both have fanbases that hate most of the stuff the band made . 
  awwww so cute . 
  i do n't get the title because it 's obviously intentional , but ok . 
  poker face, 
  the us is running out of former presidents to send to north korea to save lost tourists . 
  i would recommend they skip bush jr. 
  paradox and introversion are two of my favourite developers . 
  gon na go buy all of their games on steam now , just for the support . 
  here 's a [ list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_government_pension_fund_of_norway#excluded_companies ) of excluded companies . 
  very interesting . 
  thanks , i will . 
  they have a great boxed version of all of their games . 
  would n't bet on it . 
  the world is living in an unusualy peaceful times at the moment , and technology , communication and economy made such changes less feasable . 
  although i would n't speculate for the world scene , europe definitely has reached a phase where only small changes can occur ( basque , scottish independence ) , maybe a russian annexation of belarus ( i 'm talking out of my ass , but 100 years from now ... who knows ) or something similar . 
  i 'm reading an interesting book from robert cooper about a similar subject . 
  one of the things he wrote is that this may just be europe 's final form for many years to come . 
  more about his theories [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_cooper_ ( strategist ) #publications ), 
  well . . do n't most of us have african roots ? 
  disagree on this one . 
  die antwoord is a parody , while mike skinner has a lot of genuine ( snicker ) material that wo n't be just a fad .

  the last two examples are mostly the same people in both bands . 
   as the costs for education is too high for most of the population, 
  i 'm a student here . 
  the maximum you will pay for two semesters is about a month and half of the average salary which is around the price of a better lcd tv or laptop here . 
  personally , my laptop was more than my tuition . 
  also , this is info for 2009 , this year i 've heard it 's free , although the universities and the department of education did n't find common ground . 
  the protest was n't about high prices , it was about free education , the principle of it . 
  i 've heard people had to sign a document that says that they 'll have to pay if the state does n't . 
  is that right ? 
  i failed my first year , i should check out what the deal is this year . 
  cynicism makes every discussion better , right ? 
  check out the [ bologna process ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bologna_process ) . 
  under it you ca n't study more than x years or times to avoid such perpatual students . 
  also , free education is n't all about making money and getting it back to the state . 
  such wild capitalism does n't make any sense , because a society needs a lot of stuff that does n't profit to be functional and modern . 
  you ca n't put a price tag on everything . 
  here 's a very interesting article on how norway managed their oil . 
  i strongly recommend it to everyone : http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/99680a04-92a0-11de-b63b-00144feabdc0.html#, 
  golf jokes ? 
  on * my * reddit ? 
  as someone from the balkans , i resent dissing on what the us did then . 
  europe had its head way up their ass and had no idea how to deal with a conflict in their own back yard . 
  clinton took initiative and with minimal casulties on both sides ( i do n't have the info because i 'm on my phone , but i think nato had maybe two or three casulties ) forced milosevic to stop the war . 
  this was the definition of humanitarian intervention , while iraq was borderline war crime and afghanistan knee jerk and awfully planned and executed . 
  god damn he was the best . 
  i cry a patriotic tear when re-watching some episodes and i 'm not even american . 
  i 'm not a programmer , but did some scripts and stuff for a certain phone manufacturer . 
  some time after that i was buying a different brand of phone from a guy , and he gave me a cd with some software on it . 
  one of them was my script , dumped from the other phone and ready to use . 
  i was proud . 
  whoa .
