  do you use apple products ? 
  well i would like a big field where they can all live together but life sometimes sucks . 
  well ... you watched spy kids . 
  you are n't pressured to use them . 
  i do n't torrent with opera , or use the in built mail client , but you have it there . 
  better you than me [ ] ( / fy1 ), 
  not only that , but they vote on croatia elections as well !, 
  in yugoslavia that numbers go from 100 000 upwards . 
  i feel dirty liking most of the list . 
  and really surprised there 's only one radiohead song in the top 10 . 
  had to check the url again . 
  oh , i did n't know that . 
  i run an android app competition for a magazine i work in along with the android section and the corresponding website . 
  for a country with three it magazines , that 's the most we can do . 
  maybe investing in a fleet together would be a good idea . 
  i 'm sure both french and uk carriers would be highly similar and share a lot of characteristics . 
  nope , the concert start in four hours . 
  thanks for the question . 
  i think we 're looking at a fight to the death boys . 
  ever refueled an airplane that was going into combat ? 
  ever actually had a `` combat '' mission ? 
  caps in title ?

  in a bad religion kind of way . 
  as a guy who reviews laptops , i 'm bummed . 
  when i have 20 opened laptops in front of me , the stickers are the easiest way to quickly review the situation and identify them . 
  that 's what is always ( always i say ! ), 
  bothering me . 
  how do i know if i have high or low karma ? 
  how is my karma in the whole reddit scheme of things ? 
  is my 16k in a year and half high , low or normal ? 
  i almost cry when reading that . 
  which i actually do every week . 
  that 's ok , but with stickers i can look at the bunch of 'em from a distance and know if they 're intel/amd or nvidia/at ... um ... amd . 
  exactly why i said `` as a guy who reviews laptops '' . 
  i remove the fuckers off of * my * computers two minutes after the purchase . 
  in 1994 or 1995 i saw a news report that shocked me . 
  being in croatia during that time violent images were a normal thing on tv , but i was always shielded from them by my mom . 
  but that time i footage of a man killing civilians . 
  i do n't wan na go into details , but the guy in uniform with a russian-made assault rifle got into my brain and i never forgot him . 
  i often remember him , but i 'm far too lazy to actually find him or do anything . 
  my only hope is to one day find out who he is . 
  / semi related story, 
  i went to a school where sign language was a compulsary class . 
  do you think it should be in all schools ? 
  where i live you have a primary foreign language and a secondary one , but since i went to a private school we got sign language as a `` foreign language '' , along with english as the main . 
  both statements are tragically wrong . 
  payment method is n't supported . 
  i see we 're all hating rolling stone here , but the message has a point . 
  a fucking big one . 
  oh nostalgia , you hit me so hard . 
  oh yes , although he 's 50-something , the show was energetic and powerful . 
  he gave his short speeches between songs , made improvisations ( one song was almost 10 minutes ) he even jumped into the audience twice . 
  his voice is still great , and the band is excellent . 
  really a good show . 
  / mu / had a [ epic thread ] ( http://4chanarchive.org/brchive/dspl_thread.php5?thread_id=8991988&amp;x=mu+-+choco+tacos ) about choco tacos . 
  rts was milosevic 's main propaganda station which is responisble for many deaths in five countries . 
  i 'm sorry about the civilians killed but that was a legitimate target and milosevic knew it but decided to keep the people in . 
  you should link to the albanian civilian convoy or use of cluster bombs . 
  compare that to what the eu did and you 'll see that the us was the only side actually doing shit . 
  there was feet dragging , but in the end clinton made the right decisions . 
  this coming from a europhile . 
  just listening to flip your wig heh . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=hr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.muzika.hr%2fclanak%2f27829%2fizvjestaji%2fodabrao-jello-biafra-boogaloo.aspx ) a translated version of my review . 
  the first sentence is flipped and some verbs got screwed but you 'll get it . 
  speeches were about corporatism , institutionalized torture , hope obama did n't bring , the shit bush did , wars and the media . 
  he even mentioned slobodan milosevic and the war we had here . 
  he also talked about gentrification in san francisco ( which is slowly becoming an issue where i live , too ) and the whole dot-com generation and living in our computers . 
  he did n't say anything we already did n't know , but it was fun hearing him speak . 
  smart guy . 
  yes , redditor of 6 days , everything posted is self promotion . 
  do n't judge a band by its fans . 
  can they even be compared ? 
  i was thinking more about coming from liverpool station to my hotel , i think i found a good line . 
  thanks for the link and help . 
  reddit had croatia in its logo ? 
  atari teenage riot , but you 'll be turned off by the sound . 
  anything jello biafra touches . 
  thom yorke said :, 
   that 's just not right !, 
  the pixies opening for us is like the beatles opening for us . 
  i actually fell in love with this song only then . 
  loved pixies years before i played the game , but the melody just got me and soon i was playing it without looking . 
  weird , really . 
  america holds money and making more of it in higher esteem than most european countries . 
  it 's in your culture and it is much more visible than over here . 
  the saying goes ... 
  us is the business capital of the world , but europe is the lifestyle one . 
  but it 's certainly looking at an evolution soon . 
  perhaps you meant to write small or something , because estonia is n't weak and is in many ways a better place than the us . 
  also , people should refrain from naming countries they know shit about . 
  eastern europe is n't a dirty word anymore . 
  thanks , i will . 
  there are a lot of bands on my `` listen to '' list that i did n't yet cover , but really should . 
   7 what 's more , he once [ played guitar onstage with eric clapton ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh9hdpqoaxo&amp;feature=related ) .
