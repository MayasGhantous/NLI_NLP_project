  [ paul krugman ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvsyzo86s-k ) might be near . 
  i 'm proud that i was a part of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/february_15,_2003_anti-war_protest ) . 
  your reaction is immature and childish . 
  maybe he just does n't like him . 
  he was n't rude and did n't insult anyone , unlike your post . 
  think about it . 
  scudda does n't like something the hivemind ( myself included ) likes and he * must * be a fan of ann coulter and something `` the fuck '' is wrong with him ? 
  get a grip man . 
  what a dumb argument . 
  does that mean that whatever happens in ... let 's say subsaharan africa will happen in the us soon ? 
  i just deleted my search history . 
  * crisis averted *, 
  because ... who hates cake ? 
  yes , the us is n't all milk and honey , but russia is as [ low as a functioning democracy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index ) goes . 
  the last four lines are the same in my country too ( croatia ) . 
  except you can go to jail for marijuana possesion . 
  you have absolutely no idea how good americans have it , yet you give yourselves the right to shit about the us day after day . 
  yes , it is not a perfect country , but it 's far from a third world shithole . 
  russia de facto has a dictator that rules the country with an iron fist and a secret police . 
  the us is most certainly a functioning and strong democracy , with all of its strenghts and weaknesses . 
  then fight until it 's perfect or whatever you strive at . 
  but get some perspective and realize that that , when compared to the rest of the world , it is n't so bad . 
  more of a jon stewart fan but i guess colbert is n't that bad . 
  ( kidding ! ), 
  [ bambi molesters ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0_nyzx161c ), 
  it depends . 
  ratm , soad , csny , dead kennedys , bad religion , the clash ... all good in my opinion . 
  what exactly are you trying to say ? 
  great read . 
  i would have seen that , but i 'm not subscribed to every fucking tech subreddit there is . 
  r/geek ? 
  why do we need that ? 
  why do i need another subreddit frontpaged when r/technology or r/software would be equally suitable ? 
   perhaps you do n't realize we have 50 individual `` countries '' in our country, 
  if i were to sit in my car ( ok ... buy a car first ) and drive two hours in every direction i would be in four different countries with different languages , different ads , shops , cultures and radically different laws . 
  that 's not mentioning different taxes , state philosophies , a different army and police protecting me , even a different alphabet . 
  if anyone is eager to calculate , they would find around 10 individual `` states '' in the us , certainly not 50 . 
  you would be surprised to find a democracy or a capitalist country without mcdonald 's so that 's a lousy argument . 
  as for starbucks and ikea , the nearest ones are a country away from me , and i 'm from europe . 
  actually walmart is a good indicator , since it is very american . 
  there are n't a lot of examples of shops that are pan-european but not global . 
  whoa . 
  * looks at username *, 
  no , it 's all the illuminati . 
  she asks me why ... 
  i 'm just a hairy guy . 
  oh god ... 
  i can hear [ his ] ( http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0062597/ ) voice in my head ... 
  * cover me limp dick fuckups !, 
  have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight , mmofan ? 
  have you ? 
  you should put grrr 1998 on croatia , too . 
  third place bitches !, 
  i see a `` curtis jakson '' graffiti on my way to work . 
  really funny , considering his fans . 
  politics aside , russia is still a credible threat to europe , for more than one reason . 
  itt : americans not getting the joke , europeans being smug . 
   but where i put my foot down is when someone starts insulting me for being a soldier . 
  i 'm sorry , but i have no respect for someone who willingly put himself in a situation to shoot another human being . 
  we can talk about your motives , politics and reasons , but a normal person would not volunteer to ( maybe ) be put in a situation to kill people . 
  i want you to stay safe , whatever your side and motives are , but i want the same to the other guy too . 
  my country was attacked some 20 years ago and people put their lives on the line , fought with hunting weapons ( because there was an embargo on importing arms ) literally to protect their homes against one of the strongest armies in europe . 
  comparing that to people volunteering to go to the other side of the world to fight someone just does n't seem right . 
  my two cents . 
  es , they definitely will , for sure , no doubt in my mind : that will happen . 
  paging icommentinsong ... 
   micro $ oft, 
  * sigh *, 
   the only thing left to nail is the voice, 
  and some men . 
  very simple . 
  fascism in its very core is evil , while communism is primarily an economic system and is noble in its intention to bring justice and social equality to everyone , something fascism forgets while struggling for authoritariansm , totalitarism and imperialism . 
  you have to seperate leaders and implementations from the ideology . 
  stalin was evil as hitler was , but that does n't have to make communism bad . 
  read the communist manifesto . 
  there 's nothing about violence inside . 
  here are the ten points of communism :, 
  - abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes . 
  - a heavy progressive or graduated income tax . 
  - abolition of all right of inheritance . 
  - confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels . 
  - centralisation of credit in the hands of the state , by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly . 
  - centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state . 
  - extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state ; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands , and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan . 
  - equal liability of all to labour . 
  establishment of industrial armies , especially for agriculture . 
  - combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries ; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country , by a more equitable distribution of the population over the country . 
  - free education for all children in public schools . 
  abolition of children 's factory labour in its present form . 
  combination of education with industrial production . 
  most of these do n't sound bad , and a couple are in use not only in europe but in the us , too . 
  76 / 223 in population . 
  139 / 231 in size . 
  nope , not ridiculously tiny . 
  most priests rotate between parishes so there 's a chance that not every church had an abuser . 
  so , a question i asked the [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/cbr3n/elections_in_the_netherlands_party_preferences_by/c0rik0i ) . 
  that answer was pretty good , so watch what you write !, 
  what is the stance of the parties towards expanding the eu , namely croatia ? 
  is he taking her behind a middle school and getting her pregnant ? 
  yes , there are problems and some points are highly controversial , but it 's less violent and totalitarian than fascism .
