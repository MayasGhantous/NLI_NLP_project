  unlike the people who downvoted my posts . 
  the balkans !, 
  1 ) he was n't elected . 
  2 ) even if he were , it does n't make him a positive figure . 
  he supresses the media , executes/prosecutes his opponents and rules with an iron fist . 
  hitler was elected too , damnit , not to mention popular . 
  putin is n't making death camps , but he is far * far * away from a normal democratic leader . 
  i guess it takes time , because rem is pretty popular in europe right now . 
  since it 's a smaller resolution i guess it could be optimised . 
  i 'm sure the guy who makes minecraft is seriously thinking about an iphone version . 
  he 'd make millions ( more ) . 
  you 're right , i apologise . 
  it was a photo story and i mistook a hungarian river with a croatian one . 
  i was wrong and edited my post . 
  wrong . 
  every country has debt . 
  norway has 143 % of gdp external debt and 60 % of gdp public debt . 
  sources : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_external_debt, 
   $ 5m sounds too much for a company that does nothing . 
  it 's just a small step to the next dotcom bubble . 
  edit : i do n't want to pee on anybody 's parade , and congratulate op on his newfound wealth , but some serious cash is being spent these days . 
  i 'm aware of that , but that does n't mean norway does n't have any debt . 
  many countries have a huge amount of cash or gold reserves , enough to pay off their debt , but do n't do it . 
  also , only a small portion of the fund can be used every year . 
  i guess you wanted to say `` norway does n't have the need to get bailed out by china since it is financially solvent '', 
  not sure about the us , but in some countries sites and isp 's have a legal obligation to keep ip addresses for a certain amount of days . 
  here , upvote [ this guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/doh27/the_nobel_peace_prize_2010_goes_to_liu_xiaobo_for/c11sg5w?context=3 ), 
  oh , and do [ me ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/do1u4/hungarian_sludge_spill_reaches_danube_river/c11oz9l ) too !, 
   wiki pedia, 
  this disturbs me more than i thought it would . 
  similar thing with me , but it was a bunch of usenet posts and a website about something legal . 
  some time passes and i spent hours in a police station on a questioning . 
  do n't mess with big corporations and the government , kids . 
  i 'm guessing it has to do something with taxes combined with residence . 
  name or source ? 
  i sure hope so . 
  croatia is playing against israel today . 
  at least he did n't get donkey punch 'd . 
  but not the most convenient for day-to-day use ( speech ) . 
  when the eu said they were funding the same researches most redditors complained about the nanny state and damn bureaucrats killing the fun in driving . 
  now google does it and everyone is creaming themselves over it . 
  sorry if the title offended you , i was in a hurry . 
  black people were just too long in the sun , and their children just got darker and darker through generations . 
  ( i live in a 99 % white country ), 
  locus can save google maps offline . 
  the losers were meant to be taken seriously ? 
  i guess you liked taken btw ? 
  also , some coming of age movies , john hughes was awesome . 
   laurence olivier in `` the boys from brazil . '', 
  really ? 
  that film is a classic , probably one of the most famous he starred in . 
  do n't go to wikipedia to check it out . 
  they show spoilers damnit . 
  having 90 % of the croatian population declare themselves as catholics , being in the mid-low part of the table is n't that bad . 
  then again , spain , italy and ireland are in the upper part . 
   most music you hear requires a pretty elementary knowledge of music . 
  most music i prefer listening to does , but music most people hear ... 
  i 'm not sure . 
  every huge pop star these days has a huge production and business behind them . 
  i once saw an ad for a new band that said something like `` looks first , if you have the right attitude we can fix the skills '' . 
   now , do i believe piracy is theft ? 
  absolutely . 
  i wo n't defend piracy . 
  it has its pluses , but it is wrong . 
  but then again , it is n't theft , it 's copyright infringement . 
  when i download a song i copy it , the original does n't disappear . 
  if i were to steal a cd , that would be theft . 
  the main problem is that people are viewing piracy and the music industry like it 's 1995 , not 2010 . 
  lawmakers and businessmen still have the physical mindset and the only reason piracy is booming is the lack of a good alternative ( with the exception of online music stores which have a good idea ) . 
  we need a new model , a new idea and a new way of thinking . 
  i 'm just waiting until it comes up . 
  i do n't choose my listening habits over the label that sells their music and doubt that anyone does . 
  your idea is ok , but not possible in reality . 
  but abortion is still illegal , right ? 
  * hey man you know i 'm really ok , the gun in my hand will tell you the same . 
  how the hell did that one guy survive ? 
  also , i could n't help but picture pulp fiction at moments . 
  just a mental image i ca n't escape . 
  i do n't have it . 
  as i said , people smarter than me should come up with something because the current situation is n't working . 
  i applaud ideas like the one above , but it could never work . 
  nobody will stop liking a band just because they changed labels . 
  people like bands because of the music , not some arbitrary politics . 
  the last couple of years some movies were hyped to hell and back . 
  i did n't enjoy avatar or hurt locker , but would n't say they were complete crap . 
  i never got the strokes . 
  if i look at it in the garage rock revival of the early 00 's i just ca n't hear it . 
  the white stripes rocked , the hives rocked , even the vines rocked , but the strokes just had a couple of catchy songs and an attitude . 
  is this it was just ... bland . 
   gary mulholland of the observer considers the release of is this it a `` world-changing moment '' and notes that its impact was `` immediate and dramatic '' on both music and attire . 
  [ 61 ] bbc radio 1 's zane lowe suggests that the album moved popular opinion from djs and pop music to `` skinny jeans and guitars '' , `` the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day '', 
  i just do n't hear it . 
  can someone explain ? 
  why the hate for american pie ? 
  because it 's popular ? 
  because madonna covered it ? 
  also , the riff from butterfly is pretty good . 
  original by the rhcp . 
  black sabbath , maybe something stoner or drone , but that would be a little too depressive for a party . 
   it has a very melancholy feel to it , it 's like `` the stranger '' by camus , or at least that 's how i imagine it .
