  try listening to it on a rainy day when you 're feeling existential . 
  i agree on this part , and i listened to it on a fucked up rainy day . 
  it just made me more depressed , but not the kind i 'd listen to again . 
  thanks , this is the reply i was thinking of . 
  also , i would n't trace it back to h\u00fcsker d\u00fc or fugazi . 
  both were influental to the scene , but i 'd make it more like minor threat  rites of spring  emocore . 
  zen arcade and 13 songs are among my favourite albums . 
  i know , but h\u00fcsker d\u00fc are pure hardcore punk and alternative rock later , and fugazi post-hardcore , while rites of spring can safely be considered emocore . 
  one is part of it , the others are just influental . 
  but i agree with your sentiment . 
  some songs are depressive by their nature , like the ones you posted , but some depend on the listener . 
  [ where is my mind ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggxdxcpnsv4 ) by pixies will crush me down faster than any other song , but that 's because i connect it some memories , while other people wo n't . 
  anyway , here goes :, 
  the beatles - [ eleanor rigby ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsz4db6dum ), 
  the white stripes - [ jolene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge3-q-aofzi ) ( original by dolly parton ), 
  h\u00fcsker d\u00fc - [ never talking to you again ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pedtqrbke94 ) or [ girl who lives on heaven hill ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puvuuvddivo ), 
  joy division - anything really , but i 'll take [ she 's lost control ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvc29byivcm ) or [ love will tear us apart ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ii8m1jgn_m ) .

  also , [ flexible flyer ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-ntitiqoos ) is one of the saddest songs i know . 
  but then again , it 's all about the memories . 
  exactly . 
  that 's the beauty with music , * everything * depends on the listener .

  look , hillary ... with such great success in iraq and afghanistan , there is no european government that will have the balls to go to war anywhere in the next 10 years , so even if the uk had a bigger budget and more troops , they would n't be put to use . 
  i 'm ... confused . 
  with that amount or karma three dicks are a minimum .
