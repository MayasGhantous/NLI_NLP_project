  here 's [ mine ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/rospaya2 ), 
  `` did i listen to pop music because i was miserable ? 
  or was i miserable because i listened to pop music ? '', 
  first line of the movie . 
  i use it every day . 
  my country has allegiance during wartime in its constitution , but until i get drafted ... fuck that . 
  i 'm making the great risk of being ridiculed or downvoted , but music is a very important part of my life and not understanding that ( and having the same passion ) is a dealbreaker . 
  ( also , i can swear i wrote this comment before ), 
  good manners are n't genetic damnit . 
  etiquette is something that comes naturally . 
  i 'm not talking about spoon types , but generally being `` not rude '' . 
  that 's why i do n't blame the parents . 
  i do n't want to say `` i blame rap music and tv '' ... but i do . 
  i think being nice is basic characteristic , but we 're going into psychology here ... 
  do they verify those ? 
  this is a wider problem , not only about beauty or women , but the fact that being smart or intelectual is n't a positive trait anymore . 
  it 's like the stereotypical movie high school where reading is laughable . 
  sad , really . 
  i agree that parents have a role in that , but adults use common sense to avoid socially unacceptable situations . 
  that 's the reason we do n't chew food loudly , give tips when deserved and are generally polite . 
  our parents install the conscience to feel bad when we do n't . 
  then again , this is just my opinion , i have n't read anything on the subject . 
  someone that did should chip in . 
   parents of any color who let their kids run amok create people with no conscience . 
  i agree and just wrote that in another [ reply ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/du0rw/iama_restaurant_owner_who_saved_his_business_by/c12ws16 ), 
   our parents install the conscience to feel bad when we do n't . 
  i do n't understand anything in this thread . 
  - a european, 
  i lost it after prom . 
   breaking news : expensive $ 1000 + subnotebooks existed for a long time before the sub - $ 450 netbook was invented . 
  sony , toshiba and others were selling skinny subnotebooks with no internal optical drive that cost $ 1800 + ten years ago , with p3 processors , 256mb of ram and 20gb 1.8 '' hdds . 
  the point is , they were actually very expensive to make and served a certain demographic because you did n't have a cheaper alternative . 
  i do n't get the comparison . 
  netbooks are ( by definition ) , 10,1 '' or smaller , cheap and with limited computing power . 
  people should be comparing them with other subnotebooks with 11,6 or 13,3 '' screens . 
  i have a 13,3 '' toshiba laptop with excellent warrant , a great cpu , 4 gb or ram , 320 gb hdd and an optical drive . 
  i do n't have to tell you that a year ago it costed a third less than the air . 
  what about nicotine , valium , marijuana , ecstasy and alcohol ? 
  were you addicted to them , too ? 
  for people who do n't know what the deal is , listen to these older songs :,

  today they 're just turning into u2 , but back then they were actually good . 
  ironic , since i actually saw the daily show on cnn the first time . 
  although cnn international is actually a good network and far from the us version . 
  not everybody 's cup of tea . 
  that 's fucking obscene !, 
  some download helper . 
  my video card drivers are screwed up so minecraft is practically unplayable . 
  i did n't download the new ones so i could save my soul and free time . 
  yea , fuck consoles , they 're the ones limiting the [ number of players ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mag_%28video_game%29 ), 
  it was on thursdays on hrt when i was a kid . 
  i learned days of the week that way . 
  i learned left and right ( also right from wrong ) from sledge hammer . 
  i guess chuck was good for something after all . 
  the guy from foreign policy had talked to him even before the threats . 
  [ the article ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/29/my_pen_pal_the_jihadist ) is interesting . 
  did n't one have a wife and kid ? 
   - wearing good , new or very little worn clothing , usually of western cut . 
   - freshly bathed , well groomed and possibly smelling of perfume or rosewater . 
   - freshly shaved . 
  now i know why i never have problems on airports . 
  call esmeralda and marisol strange to my face , i dare you !, 
  also , serbo-croat and slight misspelling of `` radiotelevizija '' tells me you have n't been here a while , am i right ? 
  this map does n't spell good for the baghdad real estate market . 
  serbo-croat is a political term , neither serbs nor croats actually like it or use it . 
  croatian is its own language , serbian is its own language , although we share a lot of the rules and words . 
  also , you 're aware of the animosities between us , so the language is a strong identifier . 
   do they still show the bill on hrt ? 
  not anymore , but they redeemed themselves with spooks and midsomer murders . 
  yes , i am aware of that , but as a term it 's almost dead ( at least in croatia and serbia , where it matters most ) . 
  we 're trying to discontinue its usage , but the fact is it still exists and there 's not much we can do about it ... 
   edit : i guess it 's a matter of opinion , nationality and semantics . 
  yup . 
  ask a liberal where the line is , then ask a teabagger where the limit is to his liberties . 
  that makes this quote not worth anything . 
  depends where . 
  the allman brothers were never half as big as queen in europe . 
  rod strewart maybe , and the grateful dead -- legend but not greatly popular . 
  i love gorillaz , but the new album did n't do it for me either . 
  do n't downvote fuckingjerk , it 's just his opinion . 
  take the right to bare arms . 
  a lot of people are against it , even in the us . 
  take the teabagger arguments against big government , socialised healthcare and taxes infringing on their rights . 
  take abortion , same sex marriage and freedom of religion around the world . 
  we ca n't even define the fine line of what a right is , so without that the quote does n't make sense . 
  no disrespect to ben , he had the right idea . 
   p.s. 
  to the downvoters , learn your reddiquette . 
  whilst you may not agree with my sentiments , my comment did not detract from the conversation , nor was it off topic . 
  i did n't downvote you , but your comment is condescending and i 'm not surprised people took it as hostile . 
   `` news before it happens . '', 
  very 1984 , now that i think about it . 
   do ya like dags ? 
  ftfy, 
  i 'm twitching like a mofo right now . 
  i have a feeling that the whole afghanistan situation would be over years ago if the occupying forces just sat at the fucking table and planned the whole thing out . 
  like iraq , this looks like a flaming shithole of bad planning and hidden interests . 
  with so much firepower , money and the greatest minds the world has the offer ... why the hell is there no end in sight , even almost a decade later ? 
  some of these have zero contact information ...
