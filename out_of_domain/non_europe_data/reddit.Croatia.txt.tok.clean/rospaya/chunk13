  i did a similar thing when i moved to another school . 
  me : `` for mother russia ! '', 
  class : `` for the union ! '', 
  i knew i was home . 
  number 37 croatia 101 people ? 
  wow , i 'd say 20 maximum . 
  that 's sad . 
  here 's an upvote . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqquddmujea ) is great too . 
  the complete masterworks part ii . 
  it 's croatia . 
  i like this one by george bernard shaw better :, 
  `` patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it . '', 
  i am dissapointed . 
  only one guy got it right . 
  my upvote for you , good sir . 
  i 'm sure we can find good things hitler did , so do n't bother . 
  does anybody have a list with proportions , percentages of the world population in the time ? 
  i can only listen to tommy in one piece . 
  it 's a story that has to be told in one sitting .

  thanks , i 'm sending you my e-mail address . 
  [ dammit ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9uy_paau-o ), 
  as i said before , it 's one thing to use legal forces ( police , courts , lawyers etc ) to indict him , arrest or something . 
  but when the army takes control , acts as the jury , judge and executioner in the same move , suspends the media and exiles the president in another country - well , that 's a coup . 
  in most countries the constitution provides that a person born in a country ca n't be exiled or stripped of citizenship , no matter what .

  7 $ for a high end pizza in croatia . 
  if you know where to look . 
  i like the opera approach more - there are a couple of lists going around with ads to filter , but i do n't use them - why should you filter ** every ** ad on the web ? 
  google ads are n't intrusive , and there are a lot of web sites and blogs that have only a few ads just to get some cash . 
  so i just filter the ones that are particulary annoying . 
  reddit - not filtering anything , gsmarena.com - filtering . 
  there was a project , but i think it 's abandoned now . 
  hey fuck you !, 
  i with the convictio that there is , somewhere , somebody that evil and having that much fun . 
  somewhere on the seaside ? 
  be lucky if you find a slice of pizza for 7 bucks . 
  you probably just saved my life . 
  how about using playlists ? 
  it can be time consuming but once it 's done there 's no need changing it . 
  using a retarded kid to get heaps of free marketing , rasing tuitions while cutting on staff ( and buying useless lcd tvs in the same time ) , having wild expectations from the staff who are expected to teach at least two classes ( one of my professors was teaching geography , history and web programming , the other one web programming and biology ) . 
  when they objected the whole staff got fired . 
  during my 3 years in that high school i 've changed about 40 professors from no more than 13 subjects . 
  someone please upmod this comment , i 'm too lazy to make another account and he deserves it .

  my dad asked me one to put on a new ringtone to his phone and he wanted the solo from [ november rain ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm9pwfbtdvc ) ( sorry for the buckethead ) . 
  i cropped barbie girl and put that . 
  his business trip the day after was fun , especially when you know he does n't know how to change the ringtone . 
  she 's over 50 even !, 
  there are a couple of java apps for cell phones that record a part of the song and identify it from an online database . 
  w series sony ericsson phones have it already installed . 
   obviously once a person is 21 , they are in full possession of all their rights, 
  most countries have a minimum limit for running for president . 
  the us has it at 35 iirc . 
  in croatia and other yugoslav republics we had the jmbg which is in the process of replacing with the oib . 
  the thing is the transition is a bitch because the jmbg was made a secret and removed from id documents but banks and other institutions still ask for it , and although everybody already has his non-secret oib nobody uses it yet . 
  just half an hour ago i needed to but my jmbg on an exam , but how the hell should i know it ? 
  it 's not on my id , it 's too long to remember ... 
  they ca n't . 
  i can give a fake one if i want to but if they find out i could get in trouble . 
  that 's the beauty of it , the catch 22 . 
  oh yeah , i even remember some kids trying to buy an invite . 
  it felt like a special club and it was cool . 
  after i got the invite and got some of them to hand out i sent one to myself and other to friends .

  most of the balkans ( bosniaks more than others ) have a great sense of humor , mostly dark and bizzare , but great .

  sacha is a great comedian , but a fucking brilliant actor and documentarian . 
  you 're mad as hell and wo n't take this anymore ? 
  wow , you 're trying to be in an even smaller minority , the only thing missing is being gay . 
  are you more of a denzel black or obama black ? 
  how much was the expected pay ? 
  i saw some casting calls on newsgroups years ago and they all mentioned good money . 
   nazi, 
  really ? 
  behaving like a nazi is a one thing , but being a follower of the national socialist pary another . 
  also , you fucking coward , make that comment with your real nickname . 
  it 's something of a sign when you do n't stand behing your statements even with fake internet nicknames . 
  kazakhstan has nothing to do with it , he could 've chosen any fairly unknown and funny sounding country in the world . 
  the subject of borat is the us , not an actor . 
  it 's not nice . 
  it 's not polite . 
  it 's not fair . 
  that 's why we call it satire and comedy . 
  surely you heard of them ? 
  i 've found it on the spawn soundtrack and fell in love with them .
