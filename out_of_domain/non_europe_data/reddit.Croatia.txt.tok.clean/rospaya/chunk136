  i saw this , and those are not all of the leaks . 
  and it 's only guardian 's database , i want to see all of it . 
  i 'm cool with not publishing sensitive names , but i want to see all of the leaks . 
  the major ones are important for the major players , but the small ones could be interesting for smaller countries like mine . 
  you son of a bitch . 
  really ? 
  i could have swear i saw some women with headscarfs . 
  i feel the same when reading british newspapers and books . 
  i need to hunt some references down on wikipedia . 
  posting the ** same ** article over and over on reddit will fix it somehow ? 
  the soundtrack was awesome . 
  until they took down wm roms . 
  but still , pretty cool . 
  downvoted for a fact ? 
  microsoft [ requested that the roms be taken down ] ( http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1018935/microsoft-stomps-xda-developers ) . 
  i 'm a member for years , and i know what 's been going on . 
  yes , i know that some information should n't be posted , but i ca n't find the info when all of the leaks will be posted . 
  shameless plug for http://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/, 
  not anymore . 
   implying there are n't many of us here, 
  graduate and that 's it . 
  i 'd rather the show finishes while still funny ( like arrested development ) than moving on for seasons after loosing the touch ( like weeds ) . 
  that option was on already , i checked that out since i noticed problems . 
  also , it 's not really msn but trillian , and the situation is the same in every other program . 
  i just clicked a link to facebook from ms word and i got the login page , but when i type www.facebook.com i get my normal news feed . 
  i ca n't find the alternative version of this comic ... 
  i 'm at work right now so i 'll see when i come home , but allow me to say ... what ? 
  why ? 
  can this be reversed ? 
  i really do n't want to upgrade since i have a lot of custom things i 'm very used to and it takes me a long time to get it all the way i like . 
  also , i lost all my notes and logins once , good thing i keep backups of them . 
  since then i always do it manually . 
   it will be seen that , as used , the word ` fascism ' is almost entirely meaningless . 
  in conversation , of course , it is used even more wildly than in print . 
  i have heard it applied to farmers , shopkeepers , social credit , corporal punishment , fox-hunting , bull-fighting , the 1922 committee , the 1941 committee , kipling , gandhi , chiang kai-shek , homosexuality , priestley 's broadcasts , youth hostels , astrology , women , dogs and i do not know what else . 
  george orwell, 
  i keep reading about you angry americans being pissed about lousy cell providers and isps . 
  someone says they 're on at&t and it 's shit , t-mobile and it 's shit , comcast and it 's shit ... 
  is there one major telco in the us that 's not a piece of shit ? 
  also see : fascist and socialist . 
  i could n't imagine being in a situation i would need a gun . 
  is violence so rampant in the us ? 
  i know the homicide rates are way above average , but i live in a european city about the population of denver or portland and never , even when lost in a ** very ** bad part of town did i wish i had a weapon . 
  well , maybe pepper spray would be nice , but in my 21 years i have been a victim of zero crimes , and i traveled half of europe as well . 
  ooh , a colleague . 
  web or print ? 
  huh ? 
  it 's higher than the rest of the western world . 
  my country has 1.62 , your has 5.0 . 
  yup , it 's a private tab . 
  damn . 
  i was proud to learn that my country provides free care for all aids patients in my country . 
  ... probably because we have a very low rate of infection , around a hundred people . 
  neither method worked ... 
  i mean , in the first i could n't find `` file types '' , i guess w7 does n't have it there . 
  simon and garfunkel inspired username ? 
  i 'm surprised amazon took wikileaks in the first place ... also , the site might be illegal so i do n't see why amazon should n't have the right to reject hosting them . 
  as much as it sound bad for amazon , i 'm not blaming them . 
  cosmos means space so the meanings are almost exact . 
  somebody ask hotforwords . 
  not hating on these guys , but youtube is really full of quasi sarcastic video blogger ( or vlogger or whatever their name is ) and people who ca n't act . 
  what surprises me is that they get millions of views and enough money to live off of it . 
  do we have lower standards just because it 's online ? 
  yup , along with a shitload of other references . 
  that episode is one of those you do n't forget . 
  also : http://www.reddit.com/r/community/, 
  does he have a cold or is his voice always like this ? 
  i have n't listened to him in a long time . 
  a lot of wars were defensive against an invasion , provoked or otherwise . 
  the us got a world cup in 1994 . 
  it 's too soon for a new one now . 
  very excited and looking forward to seeing all the leaks out , even though i 'm opposed to the leaks . 
  how can governments conduct business without the shadow of secrecy ? 
  some info in the leaks is just embarrasing , not always informative . 
  nevertheless , it 's a gold mine . 
  sometimes the truth is hidden in small packets , so the lack of blockbuster leaks is n't surprising . 
  most of the stuff we already knew , right ? 
  but it 's in the small things that might interest people in smaller countries and concerning some situations which are historic by now . 
  i 'm waiting for all of the leaks to analyse them and see what interesting stuff i can find . 
  then look at the table you posted : there is no western european country above the us homicide rate . 
  us at 5.0 , finland at 2.17 . 
   how the hell exactly is our measly 5 higher than any of the averages on those continents ? 
  any western continent ? 
  if you want to put south and central america under the western world , be my guest , but you 're still leagues worse than europe . 
  look at the breakdown for us states . 
  out of 50 ( + dc ) , only 7 have the same or smaller average as western and central europe . 
  just face it , homicide rates are huge . 
  also `` da je baba musko zvala bi se dusko '', 
  slavic languages are great for these things , i guess there are a lot of us here so i 'll start . 
  in croatian/serbian :, 
  - `` ozenio me za 20 eura '' , he married me for 20 euros , meaning that somebody cheated me out of 20 euros . 
  to get married = cheated out of . 
  listening to the long version puts me in some kind of a trans . 
  that 's how much i love this song . 
  god damnit , they got me again . 
  hey , i remember the hospital rap thing , that was great . 
  thumbs up . 
   declare natalie portman and bar refaeli national treasures and have them moved into the presidential bedroom . 
  putting the aipac agenda on top i see . 
  swimming in oil ?
