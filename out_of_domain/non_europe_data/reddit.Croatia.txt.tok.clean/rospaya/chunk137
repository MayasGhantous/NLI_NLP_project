  facing bankruptcy ? 
  because of a global financial crisis * someone * started . 
  it 's not that it 's fake , or a stupid fw , but the fact that it was posted yesterday with the same comments busting it as unfunny and fake , and people still upvoted it again . 
  do you realize how many countries there are in europe ? 
  and then you 're claiming that social programs do n't work in all of them and goldman sachs forced them ... those programs exist for over 50 years and have been working for that long , and most ( if not all ) western european countries are out of recessions . 
  he 's on reddit , so your wish may be granted . 
  at least virtually . 
  hack a day used to be awesome , the guy who ran it had an ama a while ago . 
  most of the replies to this post are exactly what 's wrong with reddit . 
  as someone said the other day , you people ( or we people ) are n't nice . 
  thegardiner wrote an argumented post with some percieved snobbery , but made his point politely , while people called him judgemental , elitist , douchey and an asshole . 
  read his replies , he admitted his mistakes , but stood by his ideas , while people attacked him instead of just saying `` i think you 're wrong , here 's why ... '', 
  i wo n't cry `` reddit is turning into 4chan/digg/geocities '' , but this kind of behaviour annoys me . 
  i agree with some of your points , but they all fail when you consider that however tasteless or expensive it may be , op made it for himself and his happiness . 
  he probably has the money for it so again that 's not an issue - people live according to their income and it seems that he can take it . 
  personally , i would scale it down , make it warmer and more hospitable , a true man cave , not a bar , and put in some movie and music posters , a fooseball table and of course that 's all if i had op 's income . 
  that said , i am jealous and think the whole thing is extremely cool for people that dig basement bars . 
   this is why i like browsers that let you hold the back button to get a full list of the history . 
  ( read : opera ), 
  opera user here , i did n't knew about that feature until now . 
  i know it 's not the best thing to do , but i 'll wait until some feature makes me upgrade . 
  as i 've said before , bad experiences with upgrades make me hold still and wait it out . 
  also , you work for opera , right ? 
  i 'm wondering what is the limit for bookmarks for sync ? 
  having a few thousand makes synching impossible for me . 
  sorry if that 's not your area i just do n't know who to ask . 
  joe lieberman is a colossal douche . 
  wikileaks is a goldmine that will fuel news and academics for years . 
  but !, 
  holding leaked secret documents on your servers is probably illegal and amazon has a right to refuse such risky business . 
  people calling for boycotts are blind ideologues that have a problem seeing how the world functions . 
  amazon works for money , not goodwill and rainbows . 
  my two ( euro ) cents :, 
  i am ** against ** such leaks because some things are just international gossip and the public does n't have to know what diplomats think of berlusconi or putin . 
  stuff like that can only deteriorate affairs between two countries , not mentioning embassy staffers who have to work with those people every day . 
  i do n't want people to know what i said behind their back , secrets are secrets . 
  i am ** for ** these leaks because they revealed illegal activities done under the disguise of diplomacy . 
  i also like them because they 'll reveal a lot of interesting historical facts and make some events clearer . 
  unrelated question : now that games have near photographic quality , huge budgets and teams , what do you think what are those limitations today ? 
  technological maybe ? 
   heaven forfend somebody does something illegal, 
  yes , actually . 
  i wo n't defend illegal actions from anyone , but i will be against morally wrong laws like banning marijuana for personal use and similar . 
  how about technology ? 
   so communication with the other countries was possible . 
  possible is far from available . 
   olding leaked secret documents on your servers is probably ** illegal **, 
  this is n't only risky in the pr sense , but the fact that they could get into trouble because of it . 
  i 'm only disappointed that amazon pulled it after some half-private threat by lieberman , and not waiting for an official request or be forced . 
  also think of the situation : high ranking and serious politicians from both sides of the aisle were radical about the whole leak , some even mentioning assassination ( what the hell ! ) . 
  think about how would amazon be marked if they kept hosting the files . 
  this way they got some flack from people who think the leaks were a good thing ( minority ) , but that way ... 
  i can see it now : `` amazon serving top secret us documents to taliban '' , `` amazon endangering us lives abroad '' . 
  we know how much the media cares about details when juicy deadlines are at stake . 
  downvoted due to the unability to lead a polite conversation . 
  you could have said anything you wanted politely , but you chose to insult a commenter just because you disagree with him . 
  i agree that there is a lot of important information in the leaks , like the ones you mentioned and so nicely sourced . 
  but when i open my newspapers i see that berlusconi is called a playboy and china plans to ditch north korea . 
  in the first case the us embassy in rome , the officials and diplomats that wrote that document will have a hard time talking to italians , and that only made relations worse . 
  substitute italy with any other country who 's politicians were mocked , and there are a lot of them . 
  that 's just pure gossip . 
  the north korea issue is worse and could lead to bad consequences , especially with the recent tensions . 
  personally , i 'm glad i know this since i 'm interested in the subject , but should it be public ? 
  not sure . 
  i 'm all for leaking incriminating documents , exposing affairs and illegal stuff , but nondiscriminating and nonsystematic leaking ( with redacting only very sensitive information like names ) seems wrong to me . 
  ( also , i 'm at the half of the thread and most of it is well argumented , sourced and respective despite conflicting stances , nice to see it ), 
  i 'm all for exposing lies , affairs , illegal crap . 
  but how important is :, 
   mehriban aliyeva , azerbaijani president ilham aliyev 's wife , according to us embassy dispatches , was said to have `` so much plastic surgery that it is possible to confuse her for one of her daughters from a distance , but that she can barely still move her face '', 
   president of turkmenistan , was described as `` vain , fastidious , vindictive , a micro-manager , and a bit of an ahal teke ` nationalist . ' '', 
  the american diplomat also commented that berdymukhammedov has a russian mistress, 
  that 's just gossip . 
  it 's the equivalent of posting about paris hilton , just mindless crap that does n't help anyone . 
  imagine if there 's someone smuggling nuclear material through armenia , and imagine some diplomat trying to stop it , only to get refused because he embarrased the president . 
   maybe the benefit is that gossip will not be part of official government records from now on ? 
  it 's rude , but it is needed . 
  knowing details about someone makes it easier to do business with him/her . 
  plus , it 's fun reading about kim jong-il 's golfing skills . 
   the idea that there is a safe drop box for whistle blowers is a great thing , and some good has come from their work in the past . 
  agreed . 
   i think expecting them to make judgment calls about what should or should n't be released ( aside from if it 's true or not ) is asking them to make ethical calls that i do n't feel a non elected entity should be doing . 
  not sure about this one . 
  but i guess it 's the old dilemma , would you rather keep a criminal free or an innocent man in jail ? 
  someone said the other day that bush was a libertarian and `` not that bad '' . 
  is tracy a man or a woman ? 
  i must know !, 
  oh god edit it !!, 
  [ has anyone else seen citizen kane ?

  pretty sneaky of you , [ hiding ] ( https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/nte1ndiymtq3oq?src=global0 ) a referral link like that . 
  ogrish does n't exist anymore ? 
  aw damn , i remember that site from my younger days . 
  how old are ? 
  male or female ? 
  throw in a good word about him , that might help . 
   i have absolutely no idea how that kid could have possibly lived . 
  there 's another ama you might be [ interested in ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/egbqy/i_impaled_my_head_on_a_spike_ama/ ) . 
  that 's not the point . 
  the point is that the diplomats that wrote that might have problems because of it , and communication with locals will suffer because of it .
