  under the bridge . 
  as much as i love coupling , this part is just wrong :, 
   as soon as caxton had invented the printing press, 
  caxton only brought it to england , he did n't invent it . 
  if it were n't for matthew bellamy i 'd like it . 
  is n't this quite old ? 
  i think i saw the japanese version a couple of years ago and i 'm fairly sure i saw the mtv version something like two years ago . 
  screw you man , my generation grew up wanting to be him . 
  do n't turn this into a chuck norris thing . 
  and because of a thing that happened a hundred years ago turkey is forever banned to complain about another country 's human rights ... 
  ** every ** country in the world has a black spot which can be used in this stupid argument which i 'm sure has its own wikipedia page but i do n't know what its name is . 
  it 's a privatly owned company which has no obligations to do so , and until now i have n't seen anybody having a problem with that practice . 
  as a long time opera user i am satisfied with the service i 'm getting and do n't see the need for opera to publicize their security issues . 
  after years of good service i 'm willing to give them some benefit of a doubt over that sort of things . 
  yes . 
  you are an overconcerned paranoic and i am just a regular user . 
  there is a great chance they are living right next to the people they shot at 15 years ago . 
  in croatia the government welcomes all refugees back , including serbian ones ( they have been amnestied after the war ) so there are a lot of cases where your next door neighbour could be the person that killed your family . 
  and it 's all legal . 
  i write tech reviews and articles about technology ... as a geek it 's awesome , you get the best and newest hardware to play with , even prototypes and experimental stuff . 
  if you have a good relationship with pr people you get free swag , go to conferences and get to meet great people . 
  since i 'm mostly focused on mobility i play with and write about most stuff at home ( sans pants ) but when i get 30 laptops , or tvs i do it in the office . 
  the boss is ok , co-workers interesting and the time spent working not proportional to the money i get . 
  i get a lot of freedom , the pay is good ( i write from 5 to 20 pages each month ) but this kind of work does n't ask for time off or weekdays . 
  if i have to be awake three days to write what i have to that 's it . 
  and the thing i 'm proud of , in the last three and a half years i have never wrote some pr bullshit or wrote positive about a product just because they got me something . 
  i 've wrote nasty things about a couple of products and my boss stood behing my words everytime we got heat because of that . 
  edit : i forgot to mention that i 'm between high school and college ( i 'll know if i 'm admitted on tuesday , wish me luck ) so the amount of people i 've met and the money i earned is really great . 
  ok , what movie was it ? 
  did she choose it or was it a compromise ? 
  this is crucial information man !, 
  croatian magazine , not online . 
  i used to read both of them , but in the end both turned out very unprofessional , a product of lazy and lame web 2.0 habits . 
  i could write a book about it but i 'll stop here . 
  now i read gizmodo but mostly for entertainment . 
  i 'll call it macedonia no matter what . 
  just fyi . 
  step 5 : profit !, 
  and/or sex . 
  thanks man , i need it . 
  get yourselves a good government and have peace ** and ** good healthcare . 
  you can blame only yourself . 
  or or or ... we distribute the 6 year olds now and ... oh , excuse me , someones knocking on my door . 
  since i 'm listening to where eagles dare at the moment - massive upvote . 
  up the irons !, 
  [ rock off ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-nuxfzmmjg ), 
  soon you 'll be wearing my sword like a shish kebab !, 
  the first one : no . 
  i ca n't stand touchscreens on my players , since 90 % of the time i switch songs while the player is in a pocket . 
  if it were a pmp or something ... 
  second : yes , fuck yes . 
  why is it a problem to copy nokia on this one ? 
  you can simply select what option you want : mass storage , pc suite , multimedia device etc. 
  my movie reviews are usually really long and nobody has the nerves to read them , so i 'll just say :, 
  the guy has balls , and i respect him for using such genius episodes to show other peoples racism and stupidity . 
  it was n't a take on the ufc , not even on fighting . 
  it was a take on dumbasses , homophobes and rednecks , their culture and a short lesson on the effects of inbreeding . 
  do you have a last.fm account ? 
  i think you and me would have 100 % compatibility . 
  also , half of the songs are from rock band/guitar hero , battlefield : vietnam and gta : sa soundtracks . 
  well i 'm pretty sure it was n't imported directly from croatia , but the balkans share a lot of food that everybody thinks is his . 
   now that we 've started with the flaws of the apple ecosystem , let 's take a look at the software that only steve jobs and satan himself could use on windows - itunes, 
  a approximate translation of my recent article about a certain tiny music player . 
  gizmodo would probably fire me that second , and my boss just smiled and said it 's ok . 
  the coffee thing is more european . 
  in the balkans going out for coffee means to go in a cafe , have a drink , talk with a friend and relax . 
  that 's mostly pro form , the same as nordic countries . 
  having a national church as a part of an old tradition does n't mean that it 's forced on people to believe in a god . 
  the thing op was trying to say is : in the us you could never get someone like darwin on a banknote , and even agreeing with his theory makes you weird in a large part of the population . 
  i 'm sure that there are people in the uk that disagree with him , but he 'll still remain there , the same as disagreeing with having a national religion ( btw , read [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rowan_williams ) , very interesting ) : people can live with that as long as it is n't shove down their throats . 
  kulen , purica s mlincima , strukli , lamb made in a hundred ways ... 
  i 'd say prsut and tartufi but that 's popular in croatia , too . 
  i 'm sure he never saw a dick before that !, 
   personally , i think that cops should be required to live in the zipcode they are responsible for serving/patrolling etc. . 
  this makes them more likely to be less objective , dealing with people they or their friends know personally . 
  actually , system restore was first available with windows me , not xp . 
  it has positive sides , but i do n't have a problem imagining the local nutjob harrasing me for something i did to him 10 years ago . 
  the who and a couple of other artist played hall of the mountaing king, 
  i 'm sorry , but according to my experience on online gaming sites ... you simply do n't exist . 
  kidding ... 
  does being a female has some advantages in gaming ? 
  i have the beginning of [ master exploder ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80dtqd5bq_a ) from 0:45 to 1:20 . 
  my dad has the riff from [ november rain ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qezs1g4rqzy ) 6:48 . 
  my mom has a part from [ bohemian rhapsody ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irp8cnj9qbi ) from 3:04 . 
  what can i say , we 're a rock family . 
  * the crowd suddenly falls silent *, 
  if i leave here tomorrow , will you still remember me ? 
  the game . 
  we all lost it . 
  13 or 14 years old , a couple of guys decided to get drunk . 
  we buy 3 beers each and go to my place , because my parents were out . 
  naturally , we got drunk and called girls from the class and as i remember , i ** loved ** and really enjoyed having my perception altered . 
  anyway , we heard my the car , my parents came so i took all of the bottles and put it in my school backpack and escorted the guys out . 
  on monday my mom woke me up in the morning for school and i got nervous because of the bottles . 
  i just dumped them in an old closet and used the stinky backpack . 
  fast forward about 3 years , i was getting a new closet so this one was going to the trash or something , i do n't remember . 
  but i do remember dumping the bottles in another old closet in a hurry . 
  they were here until a year ago and i had a nostalgia moment when i was cleaning my room . 
  i picked them up and threw them in a recycle dump . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** i kept the bottles in my room for 5 years .
