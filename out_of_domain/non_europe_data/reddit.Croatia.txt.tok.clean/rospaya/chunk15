  the last scene is elton john , slash , bono , sting and chris martin singing in a tribute song parody . 
  it 's not important . 
  but when i was getting out of the cinema a guy behind me asked his girlfriend : `` i did n't know eric clapton was gay '' . 
  she said he is n't and is n't even in the movie . 
  `` oh , but bono must be gay , right ? '' . 
  sigh . 
  bloodninja, 
  7 or 8 currently , but when working intensivly it can get up to 200 . 
  the maximum was around a thousand or so , i really do n't remember . 
  i 've accidentally opened all my bookmarks . 
  it took me 5 minutes to get a screenshot of that , a couple of years ago . 
  [ the ending of hair ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rxsxvl_gry ) . 
  always gets me . 
  there are millions of tv educated kids that want to be you right now . 
  i have a couple of friends about your age that literally * dream * of living in oc . 
  it 's a little depressing that people are that much ready to trade their lives for fictional ones . 
  can you tell me what is the main difference between the tv perception of orange county ( and the supposed lifestyle ) and the real life ? 
  fuck you vanilla is better . 
  they have a new album ?!, 
  woot !, 
  a couple of months ago , as a gift to one of my friends who still buys them . 
  for myself ? 
  years ago ... more than 5 , less than 10 . 
  it 's not important , but it is a nice feeling seeing that somebody thought that something you wrote was smart , funny or otherwise meaningful . 
  english is not my first language so i see this as an exercise in writing , too . 
   fap furiously to the beautiful masterpiece you have just created . 
  i think i 'm gon na buy a printer just for this . 
  story time !, 
  my friend and i went drinking and sliding in a nearby forrest when it was snowing a couple of months ago . 
  it was kinda foggy and we went for something to eat . 
  we where walking down the street and started talking dumb jokes , one of them was about a local celebrity and ends with `` but my son is x '' . 
  in that moment the celeb x walks past us , out of the fog . 
  we both stood there silent for a minute and then i called all my friends to tell them the story . 
  when i got home ( about an hour later , at 4 am ) i woke everybody up to tell them the story . 
  how about [ this thingy ] ( http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future ) ? 
  they are not forced to use the euro . 
  languages of all member countries are official in the eu , so it has 23 official languages . 
  i was in the living room watching tv slightly groggy from a couple of beers , the sofa where i was sitting was near a balcony , but turned away from it . 
  it was around 2 am when i turned my head and saw a black cat staring at me incredibly calmly . 
  usually we would hear if a cat got in the room because of their loud claws , but nothing this time . 
  anyway , i stared at her for a second and decided to take a picture , and turned around for a split second ... she was gone . 
  weird . 
  i personally do n't care about this subject , os 's are personal choices and mine is windows and linux , but not everything you wrote is correct . 
  most linux distributions are free , that 's true , but windows could too be installed on almost any box , with the obvious exception of different architectures and similar things . 
  repositories are great , but all software you require ... well , you personally , but again , many people have trouble finding alternative software on linux , much less free . 
  despite the huge choice . 
  that is , if you choose free ( as in beer ) software , something you can do on any other os too . 
  you found that out thru your knowledge and extensive thinking about it , but what about the regular joe ? 
  is there a way to find out there is no god with a simple explanation ? 
  also :, 
   in the end , i decided first that christianity was bunk - at the very least , insofar as it is practiced today, 
  do you care to explain the last part ? 
  it 's ok if you kill foreigners . 
  people are racist , not games . 
  the dumbasses did n't see killing obama in a game . 
  it 's a tie between his girlfriend and mom . 
  i did n't mention that part because i agree with it . 
  i agree with most of the stuff you wrote . 
  well , i agree about some of your arguments , but an adult person ( and such materials are mostly adult only ) knows the difference between racism and a white person killing black people . . in ** africa ** . 
  it 's one thing when the mission is : `` kill the niggers '' and another one when you use statistics , habits and probabilities to find out that something may be racist . 
  in the second case , we are racist for exploring so much possibilities and thinking so pc that we can find it anywhere . 
  c'mon , the only black character in l4d having a bottle as a weapon ? 
  stuff like this are extremly picky .

  not related , but [ funny ] ( http://img.letssingit.com/artists/w9d3d/a_69722_1195330519.jpg ), 
  hoping someone will be blowing my trumpet ? 
  even karmanaut ( bless him ! ), 
  has negative posts . 
  it happens to everyone . 
  one day , putin decides to surprise medvedev and gives him a brand new ferarri . 
  medvedev looks around nervously and sits inside , happy that he got such a lovely present . 
  he notes the fine leather , navigation but theres something missing ... 
  `` wheres the wheel putin ? '', 
  - `` in safe hands '' , says putin with a steering wheel in his hands . 
  bullying never stops , it just changes forms . 
  in high school it 's the frustrated jock , at work it 's the dumb boss ... 
  phil got o.j. 
  it appears that the comic is changed now . 
  you should n't hotlinked it . 
  ** great ** analogy , i 've watched that scene so many times and still find some more underlying meaning . 
  btw , i could n't say riba ribi grize rep until i was 7 or 8 ... 
  as a guy who had massive problems in every school i went to , and finally got into college at age 20 - i wish you luck . 
  a new pr director got to my former company ( think smartphones ) , and before i met her my boss told me she 'll come by my house to leave a device i needed . 
  i partied the night before and expected a friend to come by in the morning for something . 
  long story short , i opened the door in my boxers and asked `` who the hell are you ? 
  i thought it would be seasons in the sun . 
  man , you must be puttin ' me on . 
  wait , what was this about , i forgot ? 
  thinking is hard , let 's go shopping !, 
  wow , what 's with the hate ? 
  the principle of anonymous up/down votes has its bad sides , and that 's what we have to live with . 
  i 'm against the whole green mod sign because it has little or no benefit in practice , but that would never influence my voting/commenting habits . 
  that 's where the douchebags come in - they are influenced by it . 
  there is nothing more that i hate on reddit than looking at my last comments and seeing all of them a point minus where i left them . 
  i hate it . 
  but then i find a guy giving a camera to a school , saving a soap shop , saving a tortured cat and other epic threads . 
  in the end , it 's worth it . 
  i agree , shallow and pedantic . 
  reminds me of a scene in a turkish movie , [ valley of the wolves ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/valley_of_the_wolves_iraq ) .
