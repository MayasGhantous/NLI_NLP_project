  seriously ? 
  if anything , i thought that americans excel at number of tv channels available . 
  my iptv service has everything from deutche welle and france24 to euronews , bbc and cnn , with sky news , bloomberg and cnbc europe in between . 
  edit : i 'm in europe, 
  sorry , i misread the post . 
  are you william shatner ? 
  yes it is . 
  so is lady gaga . 
  * but rospaya , she can play the piano and ke $ ha is just a parody *, 
  go to hell . 
  boys and girls in america is my favourite album . 
  i know it 's corny and dumb , but that album changed me . 
  [ network decay ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/networkdecay ), 
  * warning : tv tropes link *, 
  maybe concentrating them in one place ... 
  because in 90 % of cases grammar nazis are acting like smug dicks . 
  i fucking learned to speak english with cartoon network and cnn so i 'd like to think i deserve to be treated like a human when i make a mistake . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mardi_gras_\\ ( album \\ ), 
  i agree with low social rights us workers have , but the first part of the comment really forgets that the average us worker has one of the biggest disposable incomes in the world . 
  a lot of other countries , poorer or richer , have a larger cost of living . 
  food , gas , vehicles , consumer electronics ... all of that is pretty cheap in the us . 
  my country is in the high hdi bracket , with about a third of the income . 
  i have higher taxes , a gallon of gas is double the price , a 17 '' toshiba laptop is almost three times the price , a pack of cherios is a third more expensive ... you get the picture . 
  sure , i 've got `` free '' healthcare , education is free and social rights are some times too high , but an average american still lives better than an average ... well you name it . 
  there are a few exceptions . 
  i was n't even interested in the subject , but not being in the uk now i do n't know what the reporter looks like . 
  you can opt out if you want , but some people enjoy those features . 
  i for one look forward to using the new google images . 
  that was the first thing that came to mind . 
  good read . 
   wheres the third guy in this equation that can completely fuck them both by doing everything right ? 
  does n't some company come every couple of years , threatening to give better performances and then burns out after the first product ? 
  or intel , announcing that their next chipsets will include a graphics chip good enough for gaming ... every . 
  year . 
  despite everybody telling you cute inspirational crap about how it 's the same thing ... it is n't . 
  like eating out , tennis or sex , some things are better when you have somebody to share it with . 
  i 've been to hundreds of concerts and in most cases i do n't go if i ca n't find somebody to go with me , but like you , one band had a three concert reunion , and one of them happened where i live so i went alone . 
  not as fun , but not bad . 
  yes , there is no reason it would n't be socially acceptable . 
  i 'm from croatia so if you need some local pointers let me know . 
  interrail is a product of a company named eurail . 
  it 's the same thing . 
  oh and i would rather use the bus when in croatia . 
  i went from zagreb to zadar a couple of times ( and am going again in two months ) and the train on that relation is crap . 
  the bus is cheap and fast enough . 
  if you 're luck maybe you can catch one that stops in privlaka . 
  holy shit . 
  my kingdom for her name . 
  is that the porn version of eurotrip ? 
  it has amsterdam , prostitutes , incest ... 
  to be fair , russia today is a kremlin half-propaganda channel , but i get your point . 
  thanks . 
  i just pasted the link , did n't even try to make one . 
  the movie sucked . 
  the [ soundtrack ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spawn_\\ ( film \\ ) #soundtrack ) rocked . 
  find it and listen to it . 
  i had a baba roga ( same thing , other language ) doll in my room ever since i was a kid . 
  my mom would use her as the boogeyman of my childhood . 
  still keep in above my bed . 
  although i could take a picture , i am far too lazy . 
  [ here 's a video of a cute canadian girl showing you how that looks ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtpgd4huk4w ), 
  any idea when it will go public ? 
  no they are not . 
  karl habsburg was an austrian mp a decade ago . 
  they are only banned from running for presidency , a largly ceremonial duty . 
  they are also planning to abolish that amendment . 
  i got a limp bizkit flashback . 
  me too . 
  six months later i hate using a keyboard on my desire and i 'm just waiting for a good qwerty android device . 
  although i miss my e71 for the keyboard and battery life , everything else is superior . 
  the actor who plays troy on community wrote that song . 
   was n't karl habsburg a member of the european parliament , though ? 
  yup , my mistake . 
  i 'm not too into austrian politics , but being croatian i pick up something now and then . 
   stack 's rant inveighs against capitalism , catholicism , and george w. bush . 
  an average redditor . 
  the last song that needs an acoustic cover . 
  he 's just going to an album cover shooting . 
  women bathrooms probably look like that . 
  a lot of the countries posted have low women rights . 
  bad behaviour to women does n't have to be coded into the law if the local traditions support it . 
  think of it as a smaller , less touristy vienna or prague . 
  by tesla 's proposal , zagreb was one of the first cities with electrical public lighting .

  yes , my mistake . 
  you are right . 
  `` cool '' in the title is n't the cool i was thinking of . 
  it does in only once a month and craves chocolate before . 
  way to bite the hand that feeds . 
  without guardian and other major newspapers , assange would n't get a fraction of the publicity he did . 
  limey detected . 
  love musicals , hate sports , hate cars . 
   he had the guts to boycott the olympics in protest the ussr occupation of afghanistan . 
  petty politics that led to needless politicising of a sport event , the same as boycotting the la olympics . 
  jesus christ superstar has an interesting perspective on him . 
  though artistic , but considering the time it happened it could be true . 
   the greatest president of the 20th century , calvin coolidge . 
  could you expand on that ? 
  is n't roosevelt usually taken as the best 20th century us president ? 
  evilness is n't measured by the height of bodies .
