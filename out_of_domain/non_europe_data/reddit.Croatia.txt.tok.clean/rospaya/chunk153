  we need a music version of zoolander who will break rivers legs , put nick cave back on heroin and make metallica mad again . 
  ok , i 'm not being fair with cave , his recent stuff is great . 
  got noticed on a forum years ago and worked my way through it . 
  [ here 's a list of all the songs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_number-one_hits_/ ( united_states / ) / ), 
  my conclusions :, 
  - disco phase was awful, 
  - maybe three non-english songs, 
  - elvis and beatles were big , man, 
  - rick astley made me flinch for a second, 
  - the rock songs really were combo breakers, 
  eurail goes from bucharest or sofia to belgrade and then zagreb . 
  i ca n't stand trains so i wo n't judge what the better options is , but know that there are bus lines to and from every village in the balkans , you ca n't miss them , but their quality varies as well . 
  since you are going in june , you could find a flight to split , dubrovnik or maybe zagreb from belgrade as well , i 'm not sure if we have off season flights with them . 
  croatia is well connected within , but trains do n't go much southern than split . 
  if you are in zagreb there are flights to bigger cities , and bus rides are n't too bad on the new highways . 
  obiously split , dubrovnik , zadar , hvar , rovinj and such are the touristy places , but zagreb is cool to see during the summer . 
  inb4 questions :, 
  goran is a fairly common slavic name . 
  [ goran ivanisevic ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pbpyrx8c8w ) is the 2001 wimbledon champion ( croatia ) , [ goran visnjic ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0899681/ ) is an actor ( croatia ) , [ goran bregovic ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdylrtfwg2a ) is a musician and composer ( serbia ) and [ goran dragic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goran_dragic ) is a slovenian nba player . 
  no , that 's rospija . 
  people ask me what the hell it means but i do n't know what to say . 
  jerry from devo was at kent state when the shootings happened . 
  they [ also ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70wwqy0isc8 ) did the song . 
  not op , but since i 'm a music journalist i 'll answer . 
   why should i read more articles written by you and your ilk ? 
  nobody says you should . 
  i read music reviews to find new music , to learn something about an album or artist , to seperate wheat from the chaff . 
   why do y' all ( and this is a generalization , so correct me if i 'm wrong ) have such a poor knowledge of theory, 
  i know basic music theory , but i do n't see it as important when reviewing music . 
  a drummer friend was pissed at me the other day how could i like the white stripes , since their drummer is crap . 
  they are the best example why skill and knowledge are n't the most important things when making music . 
  music is n't math , you ca n't judge whether it 's good just over theory . 
   and delineation of genres of music ( go to r/metal , then r/truemetal , for reference ) ? 
  it seems that you 're reading the wrong stuff . 
  metal is n't mainstream and looking into any mainstream music resource for metal that 's beyond metallica or iron maiden is n't for you . 
  i 'm sure there are tons of metal review sites and publications . 
  just for the record , i like metal and the publication i work for reviews a broad spectre of genres . 
  since i 'm not writing for myself , i write about what my editor gives me . 
   my pet explanation is that y' all are people who wanted to be musicians but could n't cut it so you decided to write about us . 
  do n't be full of yourself . 
  sure , i want to be a rockstar as anybody else , but i enjoy writing and listening more than playing and singing , the same way i enjoy it more than programming or digging ditches . 
  i do what i like most . 
  and why the negative stance ? 
  if you gather 20 honest reviews about some album , most of them will be minus or plus 10 % the same , meaning that they carry some weight and are n't just invented out of thin air . 
  i 'm thinking more of a typical slavic old hag with a wooden spoon in her hands , being all grumpy and yelling . 
  what i 'm interested is the dataset . 
  where did it come from , how big is it , how is it formatted ? 
   you should be able to sell your product to consumers or your chosen career wo n't be a viable one much longer . 
  i 'm not a salesman , but here goes : nobody has time to listen to all of the music that comes out in any given time . 
  so you find sites/magazines that you like and trust and use their reviews to find what you might like . 
   this is 2011 , where we have last.fm . 
  a proud last.fm user 2005 myself . 
   to a large extent that 's made your profession obsolete . 
  say that to millions of people that still read reviews . 
  you are obviously not the kind of person that reads them , but the market is there , people still want sentences , analysis and scores ( which i despise ) about music . 
  the site i write for deals exclusivly with music and is among the top read sites in my country , which counts for something . 
  and we 're no industry bitches , the last reviews at this moment are kt tunstall , times of grace , alexisonfire , white lies , battlelore . 
  not exacty mainstream , most of it . 
   and i guess it 's because when i think ` music journalism ' i think rolling stone . 
  that 's your prejudice . 
  i like rolling stone because matt taibbi , michael hastings , hunter thompson and evan wright , but do n't really read anything they say about music . 
  check out popmatters , av club , guardian music , hell even pitchfork . 
  all of them are popular and good reads . 
   seems to me that you should be able to communicate in the language or you 're ripe for your drummer buddy ripping you when your defense of the white stripes is that they 're ` catchy ' . 
  there is a shitload of descriptions between `` catchy '' and `` bad drummer '' . 
  i write reviews for the type of people that the white stripes are reaching for , so neither technical descriptions which you would like , neither `` catchy '' what the lady gaga crowd would like are n't right . 
   music is subjective , but if you want to defend your subjective decisions you 'd better learn how to speak the language or snobs like me are going to mock you ceaselessly . 
  i defend myself , but i am well aware of criticism and ready for it , like the artists i 'm reviewing . 
  it comes with both jobs , although one is obviously more prone to it . 
  tumbler : the social network/blog for hipsters . 
  where is this not blocked ? 
  also , i like the trend of giving good directors money for great commercials , like the excellent guy ritchie [ take it to the next level ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lza-57h64ke ) thing for nike . 
  and how could i forget [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbzthavvslq ) masterpiece . 
  not blocked for me too , right now , but 30 minutes ago nothing . 
  could anyone tell me how much would one prolong the battery life on my htc desire ? 
  hope monoprice delivers overseas . 
  edit : damnit , it looks like the delivery would cost more than the battery . 
  this is a great moment for microsoft history . 
  for the first time in 10 years , i see a windows service pack out and think : `` do i even need it ? 
  w7 is serving me just fine as it is '' . 
  the title confuses me . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  the foreign legion is under french military command . 
  the fact that a lot of recruits have criminal background and use it to get military training might have an influence on their decision to later become mercenaries for hire . 
  this way you are a mercenary for france . 
  take notice , americans . 
  david cameron is a conservative . 
  exacty what is needed for a nice and bloody civil war . 
  having grown up with that , it 's a little too sweet for my taste . 
  it looks like imgur was down for a second so i see [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pmphq.jpg ) and think `` heh , that 's a funny post '' . 
  until i read the comments and it came to me ... 
  reap additional karma by joining [ r/posters ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/posters ) . 
  this is a joke , right ? 
  i mean , it must be . 
  please tell me it is . 
  is n't that the french stereotype ? 
   nixon , the last president to operate within the `` american consensus '', 
  could you expand on this ? 
  what made nixon different from those who came after him , except the reagan swing to the right ? 
  except big bang theory is n't smart or funny .
