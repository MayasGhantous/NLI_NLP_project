  i feel better after it . 
   meaning that a literate , educated person has a greater chance of getting a permanent visa etc , than a non-literate person etc. 
  i do n't see why a rich , safe , well off nation should accept any other than the best people that can contribute the most . 
  as someone who will maybe one day will move out of croatia and seek a better fortune somewhere else , i 'm sure i will integrate and contribute , but expertise these days is calculated mostly in university degrees and other formal ways , something i do n't have . 
  that 's what 's bothering me . 
  kra\u0161 is the company that makes them , and bajadera is their brand . 
  ok , this is the fifth repost of this in the last few days . 
  aw , i was waiting of something more juicy . 
  the lulz . 
  anyone hungry ? 
  do n't fear the reaper , man . 
  interesting [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/fs088/6_months_of_a_german_green_mps_data_retention/ ) about that over in r/europe . 
  be sure to check the link . 
  it 's a hip hop group that likes to troll people with this . 
  the guy in the picture is in the band . 
  the daily show runs a special edition once a week on cnn international . 
  that 's how i found out about it in the first place . 
  for someone who has a shitload of stuff on his htc desire and does n't want to lose them , is it possible to root and put a new rom easily ? 
  in the wm days it was loss by default . 
   rts ? 
  really ? 
  i can think of a handful of good rts games - the post-warcraft-2 rts boom is long over . 
  as someone who does n't like warcraft or any other fantasy game ( bracing !, 
  ) , the rts market is very short of good games in the last years . 
  while age of empires and command & conquer became pop culture references of the 90s , one is now a farmville style game and the other is more rpg than rts . 
  company of heroes was great , so was world in conflict , but where the hell did others go ? 
  that 's 10 % of the market in the us , macs are less popular in the rest of the world .

   do minimal marketing for the game , let it sell by word of mouth like amnesia or minecraft . 
  one out of a thousand indie games make it . 
  one out of a million become minecraft . 
  you being downvoted means you are being censored and freedom will soon be taken away from you ? 
   he 's the most respected president of the last 30 years - you should probably learn why . 
  please enlighten me . 
  i 'm serious , reagan is severely overrated . 
  hearts of iron is one of my favourite games . 
   any specific thing you 're worried about losing ? 
  lots of bookmarks , color note notes . 
  both problems could have been solved by using better applications . 
  mostly it 's just the annoyance of having all of my stuff here and working and then configuring everything again . 
  i think i 'll just backup the main stuff and take the plunge . 
  thanks . 
  living in europe has its advantages , never heard a single song . 
  maybe . 
  but nirvana is real music . 
  it 's derived from feelings , from pain , from experience and does n't strive to be populist , clear or pretty . 
  the only reason it got popular is the huge growth of the genre at that time , of which nirvana was a prime example . 
   facetious, 
  i have no idea how to pronounce that word . 
  i do n't live in an english speaking country so i 'm good , but if i did i would use it * all of the time * . 
  was expecting ginger kids in a wheelbarrow . 
  somewhat relieved now . 
  thank you my good man , i was running out of options but noble niggerdick saves the day . 
  tomorrow is a little too soon , no ? 
  sit on it a little longer . 
  but i want apple news . 
  i want all the news , just balanced and not the engadget/gizmodo circlejerk about the latest iproduct . 
  alternative title : real life sim city . 
  enjoy your free speech . 
  yes you could . 
  i 'm from croatia where 15k would be a little more than average yearly salary , and serbia is cheaper so i 'm guessing you could . 
  but travelling on tha kind of money ... 
  i do n't think so . 
  water is the essence of wetness . 
  i thought people dump porn only in the woods . 
  maybe try novi sad , it 's a medium sized city , probably cheaper than beograd and better for living . 
  more european than pancevo . 
  just watched battle of algiers the other day , very interesting movie . 
  do n't like him , but love his songs . 
  simple . 
  coincidentally , i just today learned about [ r/archerfx ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/archerfx/ ), 
  what documentary was it ? 
  link maybe ? 
  the armed forces use different rules . 
  when you gon na let me tap that and no bueno , from the same thread . 
  it was popular for a few weeks . 
  i 'm a sucker for ever command and conquer clip , but [ red alert 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guwtndkhch0 ) takes the cake . 
  music , story , animation . 
  it 's just perfect . 
  most people in this part of the world own their own place , and the rent is too damn high , so that 's a massive cost for op that eats up almost half of the money . 
  i 'm wondering the same thing . 
  i 'll be in sweden for a week and i 'd like to surf the web . 
  which prepaid provider offers cheap megabytes ? 
  i have wifi where i 'm staying , but i 'd like to use the internet everywhere , if it 's not expensive . 
  whatever !, 
  according to some old christian rules , i 'd be branded a mass murderer . 
  [ there 's a list of fapping achievements ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iaqwp.jpg ), 
  also , 73 . 
  it 's in the url : krystle lina . 
  i 've heard of it but i do n't get it . 
  did the police horribly overreact ( i mean , dropping a freaking bomb ... ) or were the move people dangerous and a threat ? 
  i always wondered what the line meant . 
  thanks . 
  some submissions just get shafted , that 's it . 
  most of my submissions have zero points and zero comments , as if nobody ever saw them . 
  shit just happens . 
  i 'll try using google translate to find something , thanks . 
  just to be clear , it is possible to get at least 200 mb of data for a week for cheap ?
