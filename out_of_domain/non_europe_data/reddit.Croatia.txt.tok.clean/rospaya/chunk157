  now get that stuff away from me . 
   he 's watching ... waiting . 
  [ commiserating ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ht5rzpzpqw `` yes i hate myself '' ) ? 
  op , you are a douche . 
  worldpolitics ? 
  seriously ? 
  really hope that 's the gogol bordello kind , not the mile kiti\u0107 kind . 
  you un-deleted my profile when i accidentally deleted it some time ago , after bothering you on irc about it . 
  thanks for that . 
  croat here . 
  i can stand the brass and gypsy kinds , but i draw the line at turbofolk . 
  if you still live here i guess you know what kind of people that kind of music is connected to . 
  the two labels you mentioned are exceptions to the rule . 
  a majority of the money and talent is behind major labels and their smaller fronts , which put money first and artist second . 
  a similar thing happened to me , except it was a knife , the guy was a nutjub and i did n't notice what it was until he said `` oops '' , got it from the ground , opened it and pointed it at me . 
  excuse me , but warcraft 3 is one of the most popular pc games in recent history and is almost universally acclaimed . 
  very , ** very ** far from `` under-appreciated '' . 
  moscow is special in that case . 
  notice the graph [ here ] ( http://marketurbanism.com/2010/10/19/the-economics-of-redevelopment-and-the-shape-of-socialist-cities/ ) . 
  also , suburbs in the us sense does n't exist in much of the world . 
  * there 's a batman waiting in the sky *, 
  * he 'd like to come and meet us *, 
  * but he thinks he 'd blow our minds *, 
  both have their benefits . 
  i use them both as search engines in opera , with the usual wikipedia , youtube , amazon , last.fm ... just `` wolf distance new york tokyo '' or `` eu gdp per capita '' when i need data or `` g reddit commenting markup '' when i need a search . 
  germany was an economic powerhouse long before that .

  [ my favourite ] ( http://www.overthinkingit.com/2010/03/23/the-musical-talmud-one-less-lonely-girl-by-justin-bieber/ ), 
  the main reason i go to zadar is because ryanair does n't have flights from zagreb . 
  split has a beautiful old city but is n't fit for everyday urban life , and dubrovnik is too touristy for my taste . 
  maybe because i 'm local , but all these places are great , but not spectacular . 
  if anyone has any questions , fire away . 
  depends what you like . 
  there 's rovinj up in istria , hvar on an island near split , and if it 's your thing , [ lubenice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lubenice ) and beli on cres or motovun in inner istria . 
  motovun is also a small and beautiful village , but it turns into a party during the summer , with the annual [ motovun film festival ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motovun_film_festival ) . 
  it 's a great town to see off season too . 
  \u0160ibenik is nice , so is trogir . 
  richard nixon ? 
  nobody ( sane ) says it 's ok to hate the us , or any other country , but you have to see that the us is the most powerful country in the world and does n't have a problem acting on it . 
  from the positive things ( wwii ) to the negative ( iraq and numerous other wars ) , the us has influence over most of the western world in a way nobody else has . 
  count to that the stereotypes hollywood produces , the cultural imperialism and american exceptionalism and nationalism that makes you easy targets for the more liberal part of the world . 
  so ... why not a referendum on proportional voting ? 
   e-voters tend to be significantly to the right of the broader electorate . 
  does that mean that e-voters are more conservative ? 
  that does n't seem logical . 
   i have read the weather averages about 10-14 \u00b0 c , was it really about that temperature ? 
  not really , the temperature from april to october rarely goes under 20 celsius on the adriatic coast . 
  i 'm not objective since i live here , but zagreb is pretty cool this time of the year . 
  there 's the old upper town to see , lot of great parks and museums , and clubs at night . 
  there was some rain today , but the temperature is around 20 degrees celsius and sunny . 
  ask if you have any questions . 
  does saab even make small cars ? 
  is anyone staying ? 
  is n't gta originally british ? 
  oh look , it 's this time of the month . 
  voicemail and answering machines practically are n't used in some countries . 
  i know two people who had an answering machine , and got like 10 voicemail messages in the last 10 years on my cell phone . 
  we 're complaining about a small popup that happens when you cross over a certain button ... that clearly says what it 's about ? 
  although he dresses better . 
  what ? 
  you guys do n't have super sweet sixteen celebrations ? 
  then you 're a member of a country which does n't exist anymore . 
  except a lot of us take that as an insult . 
  you know , the four wars fought to get out of yugoslavia . 
  you mean people that lived in former yugoslavia , a country that no longer exists . 
  many of us take it as an insult because of four bloody wars fought to get out of yugoslavia , so please consider that the next time . 
   but europe is much worse, 
  unlike the us , europe has little experience with immigration . 
  the whole continent was fighting within itself for hundreds of years and we have relative peace for only 60-ish years , not counting the 90s . 
  it 's a miracle that we can live with each other , that french and german troops are training together , that the british and french are constructing an aircraft carrier ... 
  the us ** is ** an immigrant nation , and not just white , but latino and black . 
  you have black people for 400 years , i see one black guy a week . 
  give us some time . 
   i loooove youuuu jeeesuuuusss chriiiist, 
  so ... much ... schadenfreude ... 
  death of ( most ) mp3 players is long coming . 
  although i 'm an early smartphone adopter and played music on my phone since 2003 , i still prefered more storage , a seperate battery and just a better experience . 
  even today , i 'm waiting to replace the hdd on my creative zen vision : m , and use my htc desire just in the mean time . 
  you ca n't beat 60 gb , tv out , great battery life and excellent video support , even if it is a small brick . 
   jimmy carter was right . 
  about what ? 
  edit : at minus one for some reason ... but i seriously do n't get what op meant , what was carter right about . 
  i 'm afraid we wo n't be forced , we wo n't be made to degrade our internet experience . 
  most of us will want to do it on purpose . 
  we purposely limit ourselves at 160 characters on one of the most popular social networks . 
  we praise the cell phone which has the highes walled garden , we prefer using `` apps '' more than web sites . 
  like the 1984 vs brave new world comparison , we will choose our future , not be forced into it . 
  ( of course , all of this does n't make net neutrality any less important ), 
  not to be an asshole , since i get your point , but are n't a lot of surnames very common in china ? 
  if i 'm confusing it with other countries excuse me . 
  except when they 're hacking hackers and vc entrepreneurs . 
  it 's still just a silicon valley circlejerk . 
  and saddam got the same no fly treatment . 
  full blown invasion is another thing . 
  the same as i was ok with removing saddam from power . 
  they both are bloody dictators and should be removed , but there were no grounds for the iraq war , and we see now how messed up it ended . 
  ground wars are messy and without a strong will , wide coalition and a very good reason to invade , i 'm against an agression . 
  to answer your question , i do n't know . 
  the best case scenario is that the rebels take power with limited western air support and they turn out cooperative and somewhat liberal . 
  the worst ... well i do n't want to go there , but having a rouge state on the mediterranean , with the money and will to get strategic weapons is about my worst nightmare .
