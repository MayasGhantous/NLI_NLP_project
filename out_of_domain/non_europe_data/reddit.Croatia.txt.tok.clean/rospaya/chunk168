  most of the leaks covered were in the range of common gossip : gadaffi has a big titty nurse , the president of country x is cheating on his wife ... 
  out of the serious ones : spying on un personnel , f-25 lobbying around the world , guantanamo `` interrogation '' ... 
  nothing surprising . 
  the big stories revealed were local , but looking at [ this list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contents_of_the_united_states_diplomatic_cables_leak ) , nothing is huge or shocking . 
  nice to see it in public , but nothing earth shattering . 
  i had no idea people are that flexible . 
  anyone else reminded about the [ stabbing scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuxpssjbww0 ) in saving private ryan ? 
  disturbing as hell . 
  i have n't seen the video so i wo n't comment on that , just the title . 
  nobody deserves to get punched , self defense is one thing ( it seems that was the case by reading other comments ) , but `` deserving '' a punch is n't a solid reason . 
  do you know about the guy in san francisco that ran a marathon drunk ? 
  and the pope is in town !, 
  but at least the rain fell and spoiled their fun . 
  ( yes , i stalk you ), 
  this ... is n't bad . 
  i expected bad . 
  ok , i clicked , i tested and i 'm wondering what the danger is of someone knowing my user agent , time zone , screen size , system fonts or plugins ? 
   se how easy it is to spin facts straight in to bullshit ? 
  is what you wrote true ? 
  then it 's facts . 
  stayin ' alive !,

  i was shocked when i used hulu over a vpn once . 
  even short 22 minute shows had three ad blocks or more . 
  ca n't comment on all european countries , but plenty of public tv stations do n't have * any * ads , or they are very limited . 
  in some ( like mine ) , a law regulates the number of ads per hour on private tv stations as well .

  old map bro . 
   except man-boobies . 
  hey fuck you buddy . 
  - robert paulson, 
  as someone who mainly plays zombie mode : i fucking hate it with the power of a thousand suns . 
  gawker did a big story . 
  but it takes the space that could be occupied with some other sweet weapon . 
  after level 15 it is as useful as a marzipan dildo . 
  you are right . 
  5 articles from that site on reddit in the last week . 
  do n't worry , they know . 
  yes it can , but i 'm thinking that slot could be in better use . 
  is that old thread still running ? 
  he only visited one city , and vatican is around 45 minutes away by plane . 
  i 'm very much looking forward to this , even though i 'm sure it wo n't be anything earth shattering or special . 
  half of this thread is incest related . 
  reddit is becoming more and more like an extended part of arrested development . 
   definitely not from the country that elected g.w. 
  bush . 
  twice . 
  i 'd laugh if this comment was somewhere out of r/history . 
  i 'd like to think we have a higher standard here , unlike the `` gen pop '' reddit where `` us won the war '' became `` ussr won the war '' when neither is correct . 
  talk shit about chloe moretz once again and i will end you dipshit . 
  were n't the mtv mva 's once good ? 
  i remember pissing myself of laughter about 6-7-8 years ago when i watched them . 
  i mean hell :, 
  se7en , pulp fiction , the matrix and now twilight three years in a row ? 
  i 'm pretty sure this generation is n't like the ones before . 
  i 'm thinking they paid for that . 
   which i think is highly unfair and his comical statements are usually a result of his dyslexia, 
  source please . 
  183rd city wooo !, 
  i miss mrohai . 
  yup , i 've found around 30-40 of us , out of about a hundred . 
  i searched for quite a lot and not only did i not find * solid * proof of that , i found a clear no . 
  [ the scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuxpssjbww0 ) is n't that enraging as it is uncomfortable . 
  i respect any director that can translate the feelings that characters on screen are experiencing onto me . 
  why mystic river ? 
  it 's a good movie . 
  i could write pages about that movie , but in the end i love it , however rage inducing summer can be . 
  the story was interesting , the humor was cool and people could relate with it . 
  the odd thing is that it is one of rare romantic comedies that guys like . 
  regarding black movie stars in europe ... 
  i do n't agree . 
  it 's not black people , it 's black culture that does n't translate well , not the fact that a black man/woman is acting . 
  you have a point there , but what does being an american have to do with it ? 
  i maybe used the wrong wording , i do n't know any black people and where i live i see one black person a week so i would n't know shit about it except what i read and see on tv . 
  i 'm talking about modern black culture in the us . 
  maybe i 'm stereotyping , but the `` ghetto '' culture is strong . 
  denzel is huge in europe . 
  so is will smith . 
  not to get in the whole console vs pc war , but millions of people are doing it and they 're happy with it . 
  no mystery there . 
  the guardian has the story , the same as last year . 
  just because you 're not looking does n't mean it 's not there . 
  thanks for enlighening me op , if it were n't for you i would have never known about all those things because i only read ew and tmz . 
  but seriously , all of the issues you are talking about are on the frontpage of reddit , of guardian and fucking cnn . 
  get off your high horse . 
  croat here . 
  because most people follow your username . 
  they do n't care . 
  it 's on dealextreme ( along with everything else ever made ) if anybody wants to save on shipping . 
  i played with one last week . 
  where i live it will be very expensive when sim free , the games i tried sucked ( fifa was shit , something i did n't think was possible ) and the device felt clunky . 
  i was very optimistic , but after using it i 'm no longer a fan . 
  i do n't like both . 
   `` the west wing '' is an amazing series that does n't get much love on reddit . 
  what ? 
  it gets a lot of love . 
  maybe because it 's one of my favorite shows , but i constantly see it mentioned . 
  seriously , op ? 
  really ?
