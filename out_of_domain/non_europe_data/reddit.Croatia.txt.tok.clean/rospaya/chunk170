  oh god i just saw the pun . 
  kornati national park is a bit north from split , but a wonderful place . 
  benevolent indeed . 
  i seriously do n't get it . 
  the pictures are are childish and dumb and there is nothing new being said about coldplay . 
  this could have fitted in a 5 sentence essay about how you feel about the concert you saw . 
  instead , it 's a scrollfest with two dozen nonsense image macros and stock photos , with maybe four related photos in the mix . 
  i hate coldplay as much as the next person , but this does n't make any sense .

  you can easily get a what.cd invitation . 
  just [ follow this guide ] ( http://www.whatinterviewprep.com/ ) . 
  it 's simple , you 'll learn something and in my case it was about half an hour long . 
  i 'm sorry , but i do n't find it funny or informative . 
  maybe not my cup of tea . 
  in a world where generic music like coldplay is stealing the spotlight and money from talented musicians , i do n't find it hard to hate them . 
  reparations are n't really popular after the wwi debacle , so wwii reparations were that huge and germany lost machinery , factories and intelectuals , as well as property of german expats , so the cash reparations were limited to holocaust survivors , forced work and stolen property . 
  israel is using that even today to get discounts on german military hardware . 
  italy , bulgaria , hungary and finland were forced to pay cash to yugoslavia , soviet union , greece etc. 
  iraq is still paying reparations for invading kuwait , but the funds came from taking 30 % from the food for oil program . 
  i 'm not sure how that 's working today . 
  hyperbole ? 
  on * my * / r/music ? 
  say it ai n't so !, 
  anyone else reminded of the [ luxury yacht concept ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1392768/the-beautiful-boat-world-mega-yacht-comes-complete-hot-tubs-swimming-pool---golf-green.html ) the other day . 
  right down to the golf . 
  anyone else noticed this ? 
   if there is doubt about the meaning of a written term , the interpretation which is most favorable to the consumer shall prevail, 
  pretty sweet , eu . 
  i disagree . 
  us involvment in the balkans . 
  it 's a mystery to me how you amassed that much karma with acting like an asshole . 
  if you have a point to say , do it politely or leave . 
  `` dumb as fuck '' is n't an argument and such behaviour is ruining r/politics and the rest of reddit . 
  even if this is true , you can easily buy detailed maps off the market . 
  tamo sam !, 
   i 'm not sitting at home butthurt because of an angry , violent, 
  pffftchhchhfff, 
  ( sorry , i could n't help myself ), 
   i 'm just not a fan of comedy or art or anything that has the potential to damage people . 
  but you understand that other people are ? 
  every single person has some flaw that can be used for a joke . 
  blonds , fat people , the polish get this all of the time . 
  gays and black people have a huge political corectness film around them which makes jokes against them a taboo in public . 
   i 'm pissed off because there 's at least one closeted gay kid out there who struggles enough with everything as it is , then had to hear about how tracy morgan would stab his kids if they were anything like him or her . 
  fuck that . 
  i 'm equally sad about that , but if we follow that train of thought where would we end up ? 
  are there jokes that do n't have victims ? 
  where is the line ? 
  i would just like to mention that tv/cable is beating movies for thought provoking good storytelling for years no . 
  the sopranos were the biggest tv show in its time , when was the last time the biggest movie was that smart ?

   blacklists are common , but rarely public, 
  as someone who reviews stuff for a living , this is very much true . 
  i 've been blocked by two major tech companies ( or rather their local representatives ) for saying some not-so-pleasant things about their products . 
  the list was n't public , but everyone knew and it was pretty clear that if you cross some line you ( personally , not the company you write for ) will lose reviewing privileges . 
  i got downvoted for saying that he is unfunny , and i gladly took that downvotes , as i knew my day would come . 
  what pisses me off the most is that the internet is our goddamned territory . 
  we can escape the shackles of tv , of production studios and big business who finances shows , and what do we do with that freedom ? 
  ray william fucking johnson . 
  she 's way cuter with short hair . 
  seriously , do n't be children and click on the fucking article . 
  if it 's something you are interested in reading then give them pageviews and shut up . 
  yes it is awful , yes it is shit , but you can live for one minute to read that crap . 
  i 'm sick of people bawing over how gizmodo or kotaku are shit , with their childish requests to make a screenshot or copy/paste the text . 
  do n't be an asshole . 
  click the article if you are interested . 
  i hate gizmodo as any other redditor , but you are acting like children who are asking somebody to relay your message because you are pissed and do n't want to talk to them . 
  it 's all fun and games when it 's sony , but now it 's not funny anymore . 
  i wanted to reply with [ that scene from in bruges ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dgkf8rsv4s ) , but i do n't have the will to be funny right now . 
  this video is so depressing . 
  the kids hitting the car for no reason ... do n't know what to say .

  the lyrics do n't matter .

  also , nicole scherzinger may be art , but it is made primarily for entertainment . 
  nin may think about itself as art , but why should sex , sexuality and ... well ... fucking like an animal be excluded from that ? 
  because the us wants global reach and military presence in the most important areas of the world . 
  the explanation is simple , but the reasoning is not .

  you people forget that there are three secular muslim countries in europe , then turkey , lebanon and tunisia .
