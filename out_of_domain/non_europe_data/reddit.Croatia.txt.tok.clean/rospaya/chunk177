  also , there 's a great tribute album to the powerpuff girls , frank black 's on it . 
  as everything charlie made , it 's great , but i enjoyed his other stuff more . 
  used [ that line ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/iheu1/yup_im_a_racist/c23umuv?context=1 ) the other day and got downvoted . 
  there 's a line from bari to both split and dubrovnik . 
  avoid the train . 
  then you phrased it wrong , because terrorism can be actively fought without violating peoples rights . 
  just because the us did it that way does n't mean there is n't another way . 
  some parts of reddit were disgusting yesterday . 
  kneejerk reaction and dozens of self righteous `` religion of peace '' comments . 
  for a community that sees itself better than mainstream news ( and some coverages on reddit are outstanding ) it sure as hell can disappoint . 
  i do n't understand how you people imagine music discussions without stating personal opinions . 
  everyday someone says `` x is shit '' and someone jumps on and is pissed because `` music is subjective '' and `` that 's just like your opinion man '' . 
  i know what ard is but i googled it anyway and just wanted to share what the acronym means :, 
  i would too , although i 'm neither american or british . 
  the biggest reason is when i think about the sopranos , oz , seinfeld , arrested development ( ok , this one i can imagine being british ) , simpsons ... 
  the uk just does n't have some kind of programming that i like , although i enjoy a lot of british tv . 
  this is reddit , where we often joke about stuff , not sure if you 're sure about the site you visited . 
  first three seasons of weeds were awesome . 
  one of my favorite shows until it went downhill in s04 . 
  they go out in threes . 
  there 's a sticky on / mu / about her and most people do n't seem that sympathetic . 
  maybe you 'll finally get someone to govern you ? 
  with baseball analogies you 're at least an honorary american . 
  but it was n't some highbrow journalistic integrity . 
  it was just common sense about waiting for information before blindly calling for someones balls on a stick . 
  reddit holds itself in high regard and sometimes that really makes sense . 
  i just love clicking on `` comments '' and seeing a big , sourced and smart post debunking what 's in the article . 
  but yesterday i saw literary tens of `` religion of peace '' , even when reports were saying two died in the initial bombing . 
  it 's not integrity , it 's that sanity thing thousands of redditors rallied for about a year ago . 
  it bothers me a little , but western cultures are based on christianity and when we say `` god '' we think about the god most people in our countries believe in . 
  saying allah puts the distinction between cultures . 
  the west wing was full of smart writing , but the 9/11 episode was excellent . 
  your post reminded me about [ that one scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ybn65un7f0&amp;feature=related ) . 
  seriously ? 
  why do n't you read my comment again . 
   he uk just does n't have ** some kind ** of programming that i like, 
  so it is missing ** some ** things . 
   although i enjoy a lot of british tv . 
  so i do ** enjoy ** british tv . 
  world 's population ? 
  more like middle and upper class americans , canadians , western europeans and australians , mostly of college age . 
  most redditors see themselves as better than the general population , which is why i 'm disappointed with them demonstrating such behaviour . 
  i 've got solid reasons to think somebody is shit and am willing to discuss it . 
  that 's the problem with democrats and republicans today . 
  they are too far apart from each other , but it 's the republicans that shifted to the right and moved the center to another position . 
  there 's a good [ foreign policy article ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/07/19/worst_congress_ever ) on that :, 
   if you doubt that politics in congress has become more partisan , consider this : for the first time ever , in the 111th congress that convened during the first two years of the obama presidency , the national journal 's vote ratings showed that the most conservative democratic senator was to the left of the most liberal republican . 
  there is now no overlap ideologically at all between the parties . 
  so if you enjoy fiscal responsibility you are boxed in a party that does n't believe in social rights that the left sees as essential : gay rights , secularism etc. 
   obviously not pseudo intellectuals who were interested in culture , religion and politics but intellectuals interested in the sciences . 
  you do n't get to choose what an intellectual is . 
  brilliant as always . 
  high fidelity jack black or regular jack black ? 
  i 'm so glad that guy can get a gun so easily . 
  makes me feel the world is a safer place . 
  um , yes , that 's what reddit is also about . 
  original content . 
  [ foo fighters ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gavz6wla2g ) covered never talking to you again . 
  the island is pretty remote . 
  that 's the problem here krugman . 
  the world knows who 's wrong , but it looks like a lot of people in the us do n't . 
  there was an interesting thread about how each country is called in another language . 
  i think it was in r/europe but i ca n't find it right now . 
  the pronounciation is similar in croatian . 
  please respect the differences between countries and cultures . 
  abortion is a normal thing in one country and a crime in another . 
  gay marriage is standard in one country and is illegal in another . 
  laws depend on cultural and historical differences which are best decided by residents of that countries . 
  leave norwegian gun laws to the norwegians . 
  too much `` digital media '' . 
  i did n't downvote you since i can get where you come from , but you ca n't get where the downvoters are coming from . 
  an average european can spend a lifetime not seeing a gun , except maybe on a cop or in a museum . 
  there are tons of differences between countries and you ca n't just barge in and and say `` it 's like this where i live so it should be everywhere '' . 
  what i do n't get is what did he try to accomplish with this ? 
  show his hate for the labour party ? 
  get his agenda on the news ? 
  if anything , this will hurt his cause , not help it . 
  reddit might be the wrong place to ask that . 
  what i can contribute is a recent [ article ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/06/europes-left ) from the economist , stating that there are more right wing governments in europe for the last 10 years . 
  some people may laugh , but there 's an entire generation of kids who learned english over satellite and cable tv . 
  if it were n't for cartoon network and cnn international my english would be a lot worse ( not that it 's that great now ) . 
  orwell [ wrote ] ( http://orwell.ru/library/articles/as_i_please/english/efasc ) about that 70 years ago :, 
   it will be seen that , as used , the word ` fascism ' is almost entirely meaningless . 
  in conversation , of course , it is used even more wildly than in print . 
  i have heard it applied to farmers , shopkeepers , social credit , corporal punishment , fox-hunting , bull-fighting , the 1922 committee , the 1941 committee , kipling , gandhi , chiang kai-shek , homosexuality , priestley 's broadcasts , youth hostels , astrology , women , dogs and i do not know what else . 
  about the well presented part : i watched his video and did some investigating of my own after that . 
  a lot of his quotes , facts and pictures are misleading , wrong or plain fake . 
  i 'm the guy from that thread and i did n't say anything about the evils of guns . 
  op was downvoted before the r/guns brigade came in because he introduced a political discussion that 's very controversial not only in norway but on reddit as well , and we were discussing a first hand account about a massacre , where political correctness is the polite thing to do . 
  some sound plausible but are wrong . 
  i 'm talking about `` marseilles is predominantly muslim '' , not `` europe is going to get run down by muslims '' . 
  one is opinion , the other is presented as fact . 
  but yes , i agree with you . 
  there is n't a person on reddit that 's not aware about the controversies of gun rights ( whether you 're for or against them ) , that 's why i think introducing the never ending discussion about it to a thread where we 're talking about a massacre of ( mostly ) kids is distasteful . 
  before this was posted on r/guns op was heavily downvoted . 
  have n't noticed it before . 
  that 's why people originally downvoted him , we all know how gun rights discussions end up , and that may not be the best thing in a thread about a brutal massacre . 
  so xenufobia is fear of scientologists ? 
  what 's power hour ?
