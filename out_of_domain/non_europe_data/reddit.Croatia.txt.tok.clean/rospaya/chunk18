  if math did n't rape me in school i would end up as a engineer or architect because of lego . 
  i was in the process of being raised as a catholic ... that better ? 
  when i entered my teen years i became a / r/atheism kind of a person , shoving it down everyones throats , praising dawkins and being more irritating that the average priest . 
  today , i just do n't care enough to put it on my business card , like some people on / r/atheism do . 
  and it 's 87,7 % if you believe the cia factbook . 
  the things for sweeping trash onto . 
  sounds like high tech and something my parents would n't buy me . 
  i 'm obviously not the only one with the broken meter ... 
  thanks for the compliments , and fyi i did n't downvote you . 
  i thought he was but was n't sure ... grammar nazis and other nitpicks have their charm but i 'd appreciate if they would get the fuck away just because of a simple mistake . 
  it was n't a `` your '' or `` you 're '' case , it was something that i ( as a non native english speaker , writing on my phone without a spellchecker ) could n't have know better . 
  anyway , thanks . 
  i would rather pay the 8 bucks since i prefer fixed pricing and knowing exactly how much i need to pay for my meal and service . 
  not the other way around when i have a shitty day and do n't give the server a good tip since i do n't think he did a good job so he spits in my food the next time, 
  not really related , but things like these pissed me off the most when i was in tunisia . 
  as with many muslim nations price negotiations are normal , but when i was drunk like hell and all i wanted was some soda the guy did n't want to take my money . 
  he insisted on a lower price and waited for my counter offer . 
  i was too pissed to haggle so i left him more money than he wanted and just walked away ... 
  the same thing happened a couple more times when i was satisfied with the given price and did n't have the time or nerves to bargain with them . 
  i was very surprised by this on the first couple of days , but after that it pissed the hell out of me . 
  trading and bargaining is n't strange to me and i find it fun when i 'm at home , but having 90 percent of transactions taking triple the time they usually would made me angry . 
  after that i tried to use only fixed price shops . 
  i read it as wanking and wrote a whole fucking reply about it before noticing it was `` waking '' . 
   christchan, 
  why have i just heard about this ? 
  false or not , i do n't think it was yours to remove . 
  decide if you want to be reddit and make up our minds , or do you want to moderate reddit and make us all make up our own minds . 
  if you disagree then remove the up/down arrows and moderate content depending on your own opinions . 
  that 's the reason i do n't like the gay pride parade : by parading your own personal sexual preference you are undermining others ... sexuality is a private issue , and not something that is paraded on the streets . 
  on the other hand , with the amount of abuse they live thru all of the time , they deserve one day when they can walk the streets and show their appreciation . 
  i do n't like it , but i respect their right to do it . 
  the same with this cover : if gays had an equal standing then it would be over the top , but in the position they are currently in - such a cover is in order . 
  microsoft needs to put its shit together and give me a reason to buy more of their products . 
  my windows mobile phone , my vista laptop and my xbox have very limited uses for my zune ... make a single app platform for all mobile devices . 
  make a single connection protocol . 
  hell , just make a good reason to buy the hd . 
  the hardware is impressive , but we do n't know about the software . 
  take a look at the touch ... good software and a single app platform and mediocre hardware . 
  yet , it has a great market share . 
  will the hd end up as a pmp , glorified music player or semi pda ? 
  casual fridays ? 
  when the whole `` omg att is censoring 4chan wtf dude ! '', 
  began i wondered what could the internet do to at&t to hurt them and would it even matter . 
  the second thing was that at&t is a nationwide isp and had probably got out of dumber problems , so 4chan , popular as it may be , wo n't be a problem . 
  a day later , nobody is pissed at them , right ? 
   free speech motherf *** ers, 
  yes , f ** e indeed . 
  anybody planning to see them on their tour ? 
  i ca n't link it now but you can find a list of dates on their last.fm and facebook pages . 
  upon learning about it i 've been hearing about the phenomenon every fucking week . 
  or or or , the most used platform with the most users ? 
  ok , then just a decent mobile site which is simple and cheap to make . 
  depends where ... 
  i think you can rule out moscow as a party destination . 
  the gay pride in zagreb ( where i live ) has a solid amount of participants and there are a couple politicians , celebs and other public persons , but the forced obscenity is too much for most people . 
  that 's the reason i do n't like it : just because you have a right to dress like that in public it does n't mean it 's right or tasteful . 
  not to mention that there are more police and protesters than marchers ... after all , most of the population is roman catholic , and not the liberal spain kind . 
  i hate myself for this , but just to be sure nobody gets me wrong : i support gay rights , gay marriage , gay adopting and equilising rights of homosexuals with heterosexuals . 
  i 'm hoping for new european dates because the current nearest show to me still includes plane tickets ... 
  yea , there are asians too !, 
  i love creative ... after using one of their mp3 players years ago no other player has come close , and the vision : m was a class better than anything on the market at that time . 
  during this downtime in quality players i bought a zune which turned out nice , but the creative gui is still leagues better . 
  i was excited to hear about the zii but just waited for a product that used it . 
  i 'm on a phone and a very thin data plan so i do n't know much about this but i will buy it . 
  not neccesary because i like but , but because i 'm supporting creative to make another vision : m. 
  i hope my money will be well spent . 
  yes , and it was strikingly similar to the iphone . 
  it was announced something like 6 months or a year before . 
  ca n't remember the name , but i remember writing about it ... fic something ? 
  i would love to read that article if you can find it . 
   it is quite simple . 
  no , it 's not . 
  if you have a hint of knowledge about the subject you would know how many countries claim macedonia ( fyrom ) and how many times has that territory change its occupator . 
  fucking saved . 
  very good analogy . 
  thank you . 
  i expected more about 1988 . and less about disco but an upvote is still in order . 
  it 's hella good money if you practicly do n't work for it . 
  i 'm a skittles fan too , so having someone bring them from thousands of miles away is a big deal . 
  pulp fiction : the musical, 
  do an iama if you already did n't . 
  do n't do this to me man , just do n't ... 
  i bought a toshiba , played with it for half an hour and i have a clean os , cheap laptop with great hardware . 
  but , something no other maker has , as far as i know : a ** no matter what guarantee ** which essentially means i get a new laptop if any of the following things happen :, 
   satisfaction guarantee -- the customer can work and play with the product but in case the customer is not completely happy with the purchased laptop , the customer can return it within two weeks after purchase . 
  no matter what . 
   accidental damage coverage - toshiba will replace or repair the laptop if it has been damaged accidentally within one year . 
  no matter what . 
   theft coverage -- toshiba gives customers the same or equivalent laptop if the original has been stolen within one year . 
  no matter what . 
  and there 's a new coverage , if you lose your job you get your money back and ** keep the laptop ** . 
  no price hike , no tricks or small print . 
  are you from the us by any chance ? 
  no sarcasm , i 'm just wondering . 
   me : word word balls up . 
  i. . . just ... but ... nevermind . 
  i follow the portable music market so i know about cowon and used a couple of their players , but they did n't sit so good with me as creative did . 
  but i can agree with great hardware and software , it ' a shame people do n't know about it . 
  pda owners have been doing this for years , i remember sending sms ' over ir in 2001 or 2002 . 
  i do n't like classical music and probably could n't hear the difference between joshua bell on a 3,5 mil violin and a third class player on a cheap violin ( are there cheap violins ? ) .
