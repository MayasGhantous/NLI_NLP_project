  you realize ron paul is very right wing ? 
  rope,

  what happens when people only read headlines . 
   microsoft said on wednesday it has sold more than 10 million kinect motion-sensing game system units worldwide in just over four months , making it the fastest-selling consumer device on record . 
  [ link ] ( http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41992950/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/microsoft-sells-million-kinect-devices/ ), 
  which means it is the fastest selling in a certain period of time , but the last info still says 10 million units have been sold , which is about [ 210 million ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walkman ) less than the walkman , [ 108 million ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gameboy#reception ) less than gameboy and [ 18 million ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ipad ) less than the ipad . 
  next time click on an article , read it , twice if you have to , so you do n't have to fill in the gaps with your own imagination , like you just did . 
  stephen fry . 
  probably the only celebrity you could talk to for one year and not lose your mind .

  public nudity is n't an easy subject , but it 's fucking sad to see a guy spend more than a day in prison for being naked . 
  this falls somewhere between a prank and rude behaviour , but prison is an overkill . 
  it placed nicely into ( some ) of my views which were shaped earlier than i started to listen to punk .
