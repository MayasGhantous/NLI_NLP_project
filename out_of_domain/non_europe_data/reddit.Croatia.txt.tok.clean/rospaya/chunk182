  do n't act so shocked , a lot of countries use national id systems . 
  personally i 'm not for it ( and my country uses it ) , but with driving licences and various other databases you practically already have one . 
  i 'm not from the us . 
  i would , but the list is n't mine . 
  the source is on the top . 
  marry me anyway ? 
   you 're telling me reddit bashes this guy because of this ? 
  reddit loathes the c4c program . 
  it looks like the person who wrote the list likes that program . 
  who would have thought that the list was personal , and not made for every single redditor . 
  would you like to live in a country where dadt is constitutional ? 
  so the only thing that can save the us is ron paul ? 
  you * do * realise how that sounds ? 
  how civil of you . 
  i disagree with his decision as anyone , but using his picture as an ad hominem attack is n't cool . 
  i did n't downvote you , but you go ahead and do n't reply to me . 
  civil conversation , i 'm against all that things as well , but i can put my argument without insulting . 
  with a stance like that i really do n't care for your explanation . 
  one downvote and you do n't want to play anymore ? 
  is the ultimate douche still around ? 
  `` when i was a boy of fourteen , my father was so ignorant i could hardly stand to have the old man around . 
  but when i got to be twenty-one , i was astonished by how much he 'd learned in seven years . '', 
  mark twain, 
  yes , the left , meanwhile no hate is coming from paul 's side , right ? 
  i had [ this conversation ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ju3k6/ron_paul_trails_obama_by_2_points_in_the_latest/c2f6r70 ) yesterday . 
  well she did post it in wtf . 
  probably . 
  but i ca n't find the version i need which has a strong guitar and is more rock than pop . 
  those are the ugliest sunglasses i saw . 
  oh god it is . 
  thank you very much . 
  i know that song , but forgot how it starts . 
  solved, 
   the next jenna jamison, 
  two hours passed and nobody corrected you ? 
  this is not the reddit i know and love . 
  but default subreddits are also default for users that do n't subscribe or make an account . 
  if people like what they see , and then register , they probably want the same thing they had before . 
   realise she 's a bear, 
  chatroulette was a fad , not popular in the same sense other sites on the list were . 
  i 'm not subscribed , but it was funny as hell when it started . 
  says he 's a scumbag, 
  actually a good guy, 
  i love the reasoning that someone criticizing something that you like is automatically a shill . 
  i suspect john price from cod4 got his mustaches from him . 
  that was my first thought , since i do n't know anything else about the guy , but from what i hear , he was a big man . 
  npd is n't even in the parliament . 
  sienna west . 
  she 's no longer a redhead . 
  but who will lead us in the rebuilding process ? 
  best president the us never had . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_companies_by_revenue ) , hp still has a larger revenue than microsoft or apple , so hp is far from dead . 
  according to wikipedia , it should be out in q4 this year . 
  i 'd be happy to buy one and give one , like the olpc , since it is an educational device . 
  wes is great , but the title is a little misleading . 
  actually the guy that made the comic is behind the excellent [ viruscomix ] ( http://www.viruscomix.com ) . 
   and i think the last time was during the wars in the balkans, 
  do n't worry , we do that in peace time as well . 
  a couple of croatian journalists ( top level even ) already signed up . 
  i was just saying that it 's true and it 's going to happen , since people already quit their jobs over it . 
  analytics companies can be dumb , but statements like this often have strong evidence in their connections with oem manufacturers overseas and insider information . 
  they are paid to know this shit . 
  interesting choice of flags . 
  mongolia , cuba and vietnam were n't in the warsaw pact and there is no yugoslavia . 
   asher roth, 
  i 'm trying to save my outrage for a worthier cause , but i hate that guy . 
  that was kind of debunked . 
  the story originated from the pentagon . 
  [ wired ] ( http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/no-the-military-didnt-just-discover-an-afghan-mineral-motherlode/ ), 
  [ crooks and liars ] ( http://crooksandliars.com/susie-madrak/vast-stores-minerals-found-afghanista ), 
  [ politico ] ( http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/0610/afghanistans_mineral_find_and_the_washington_clock.html?showall ), 
  but they do claim that $ 1t is wild speculation and that extraction and transport is very expensive and far away . 
  is that foreign policy ? 
  yes it is ... 
  i guess it was [ this article ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/29/the_black_hole_of_911 ) . 
  if you look closely , there 's a link in the header that says [ single page ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vkfqh.png ) . 
  that 's a lesson from 1945 , not libya . 
  is there something wrong with me if i find them all solid ? 
  in a restaurant or in a fancy occasion - yes . 
  but any other - no . 
   countries which have neither diplomatic relations nor extradition treaties with the us are ; andorra , angola , bantu homelands , bhutan , bosnia , cambodia , ciskei , cuba , iran , korea ( north ) , libya , maldives , serbia , somalia , taiwan , transkei , vanuatu , and vietnam . '', 
  extremely wrong . 
  bantustans do n't exist anymore so bantu homelands , ciskei and transkei are off the list . 
  bosnia ( i presume bosnia and herzegovina , the name of that country ) has a us embassy , so does serbia , cuba , angola , vietnam and ( de facto ) taiwan . 
  these are the ones i know without checking , i 'm sure there are more . 
  was expecting pamela anderson . 
  was n't disappointed . 
  how do you eat pizzas then ? 
  uh , how about europe ? 
  what 's insecure about the first photo ? 
  just a regular self photo . 
  i 'm not sure i get it . 
  us instalations in korea , japan and germany are useful to both sides and mostly only locals have problems with them . 
  the analogy is dumb , because i do n't see what interest any us * ally * has by having a base in texas . 
  now , if we 're talking about iraq , afghanistan and others , that 's a different story . 
  crap . 
  hate to be the devil 's advocate here , but facebook requires people to be real , that 's why they require real names . 
  this pops up if they think you are n't who you say you are . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/k0jjo/iama_moderator_for_the_world_renowned_subreddit/c2gluhu ) comment is a tl ; dr on everything . 
  not just a person , but the person and not somebody else .
