  google also insists on real identities but i do n't know if they 've gone this far on google + . 
  sorry , i thought that having the title a click away would n't be such a hassle . 
  remaster ?!, 
  fuck sweden !, 
  sacha baron cohen has been oddly silent for a while now . 
  jesus christ superstar is awesome though . 
  if you draw a dick you get flash player . 
  that 's about right . 
  is n't r/jailbait back up ? 
  oh and do n't forget tommy , hair , the wall , days of future past ... a lot of excellent ones . 
  the infrastructure has mostly been saved , nato did n't bomb it because then the rebels would n't have anything to work with . 
  also the al qaeda ties are very very thin . 
  your post is mostly fud and i do n't see how it got upvoted so much . 
  not every aid and not to every country . 
  some places are addicted to aid and most of it goes to local warlords , but you ca n't make a general statement that all aid is bad . 
  if you get rich off of this stuff , take care of my family . 
  i do n't want my kids to have to go to college . 
  [ excuse my passive agressivness ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhetorical_question ) . 
  op was talking about the r/jailbait fiasco , which is n't such a big deal if the thing exists now . 
  i was just letting him know . 
  extremely cold and solid , especially coming from his son . 
  this is almost laughably wrong . 
  even the regime stops at 1500 killed by nato , but this guy takes it up a notch . 
  any notion of his objectivity is drowned by calling the rebels `` quislings '', 
  most sources max nato civilian casulties at about 100 , and all casulties are still unknown and go from 2000 to 50 000 . 
  i learned english from cartoon network and cnn international . 
  hate to disappoint you , but most armies do n't go to war . 
  that 's kinda the whole deal . 
  the author lists no sources . 
  if you think the telegraph , bbc , nyt , france presse , reuters , cnn and the vatican news agency are all western shills then i guess we do n't have much to talk about . 
  throw in a couple more wise words , maybe i 'll get it then . 
  in the meantime , r/conspiracy is that way -- , 
  here on r/punk ? 
  not really . 
   not at war ? 
  bosnia and weekly missle strikes in the middle east count ? 
  you are right , clinton did use his army , but i 'd like to be clear on bosnia . 
  if clinton did n't intervene this would end up very badly , and bosnia is probably the best foreign intervention the us did in a long time . 
  there were no boots on the ground except later peacekeeping , and us strikes forced the end of the war . 
  edit : not complaining , but just wondering why the downvotes ? 
  i was polite and i kinda live there so know a thing or two . 
  funny pun , but seriously , was n't kennedy more talk and charisma than actual decisions ? 
   mike mccurry , a former press secretary for the clinton administration , describes bartlet as the ideal president , possessing `` the compassion and integrity of jimmy carter ... that shrewd decision-making and hard-nosed realism of a richard nixon ... the warmth and amiability and the throw-the-arm-around-the-shoulder of a bill clinton ; and ... the liberal passion of a teddy kennedy . '', 
  bush . 
  just to realize how lucky you are with anybody else . 
  unfortunately the us does n't use exocet missiles . 
  is it just me , or does that one guy look a lot like [ rhys darby ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhys_darby ) ? 
  we do n't put two same letters next to each other , do n't even have '' \u00e4 '' in our alphabet and would n't know how to pronounce `` zs '' . 
  i feel the same about music . 
  but now feel the rush when trying to find rare or obscure artists , bootlegs and lost songs . 
  except tim is getting worse and has a pretentious image . 
  tarantino knows he 's a geek . 
   and i hope you feel at home . 
  this goes against most of your post . 
  what kind of cities do you guys live in ? 
  i live in a medium sized city , about a million people and have zero problems with walking at night , or sleeping drunk on a bench . 
  nope . 
  obama wanted to withdraw combat troops from iraq and expand on afghanistan . 
  he did both . 
  sam in the west wing was just killing off a ( good ) character , not really a subplot . 
  they did a good job with mrs landingham , just bam !, 
  and later the swearing in latin - genius tv . 
  i will never forgive you for not ending this post with the independence day speech . 
  we will not go silently into the night !, 
  yeah , i 'd rather have jon stewart , not john . 
  i would think the same for the us constitution . 
  well if i had to choose which megacompany is going to be dominating my life i 'd probably choose google . 
  ideally . 
  i was at a music festival a couple of weeks ago . 
  there was a big truck with showers , divided into male and female sections . 
  the line at the female section was always a couple of times longer . 
   a ) it 's out of the geographical area, 
  nato can operate anywhere north of tropic of cancer . 
  israel is north of it ( so is afghanistan , another nato mission ), 
  from wikipedia :, 
   the treaty ** does not require members to respond militarily action against aggressor ** . 
  although obliged to respond , they maintain the freedom to choose the method . 
  [ ... ] it is nonetheless assumed that nato members will aid the attacked member militarily . 
  further , the north atlantic treaty ** limits the organization 's scope to regions above the tropic of cancer ** , [ note 1 ] which explains why the falklands war did not result in nato involvement . 
  source on this map ? 
  fertile ground for future juggalos . 
  just because that person ca n't be reformed still does n't mean we can put him to death . 
  that 's what life sentence is made for . 
  it 's not paris or london . 
  it does n't have amsterdam 's gimmicks and berlin 's vibrance . 
  but it is a beautiful place to see , even if nobody at home will know what `` vasa '' is and how many hours you spent in their museum . 
  how great their public transport is , how cool the people are . 
  i spent five days there because i wanted to see what it was like . 
  about prices : i was rational about eating and drinking out so i did n't spend a shitload of money more than i usually would . 
  alcohol in the store , pasta from lidl , some limited nightlife . 
  and had an awesome time . 
  i read that it 's realistic .

  too bad i 'm not a computer and prefer to say it in the order of frequency they 're changed . 
  ca n't find the exact post , but karmanaut wrote some time ago a comment that i remembered . 
  even the most liberal and pacifist americans were bloodthirty after 9/11 and that there was no question that g.w. 
  bush was doing the right thing and protecting the country . 
  only months later they all woke up from a haze and realized what happened while they were asleep and blind . 
  i would n't bet that the lenght of their independence has anything to do with it . 
  people have been using the sea for thousands of years , and living with it is passed through generations so people that are interested in ships build up knowledge , get trained and lead ships .
