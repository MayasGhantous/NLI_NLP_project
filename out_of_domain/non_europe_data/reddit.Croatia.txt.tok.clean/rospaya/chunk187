  because not everyone agrees with the method of self-preservation . 
  your method may put you on the wrong side of the law , or in a worse case , a barrel of a gun . 
   some apple fans adhere to a cult of jobs . 
  whether this persists after his death , we 'll see . 
  it will only grow . 
  now he can formally be a saint . 
  i do n't understand this self posts to r/politics . 
  you 're preaching to the choir . 
  the government does n't throw away every other problem and solve them one by one you know . 
  also tunisia . 
  before the arab spring you could get there for nothing . 
  creative zen vision : m is the best mp3 player ever made , even 5 years after it was produced . 
  apple stole the ui from creative and later [ paid $ 100m ] ( http://www.tuaw.com/2006/08/23/apple-pays-100m-to-creative-in-patent-lawsuit-settlement/ ) for a settlement . 
  bill gates is a modern day `` rockefeller '' in the sense that his name is synonymous with wealth . 
  even without microsoft , everyone knows his name , at least for his money . 
  apple is n't huge in every country as it is in the us , and jobs was n't that big of a celebrity everywhere . 
  when [ tony snow ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tony_snow ) , gw bush press secretary died someone posted an image that marks the big differences between digg and reddit . 
  mind you , that was in 2008 . 
  on one side digg was all : `` rip , poor guy , respect the dead '' , while the top comment on reddit started with [ `` fuck him '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6rg09/tony_snow_is_dead/c04o3u1 ) . 
  that 's one of the reasons i like this place . 
  i agree and was n't comparing the two in that sense , but purely name recognition . 
  again , even without saying `` bill gates from microsoft '' . 
  he 's famous more because he 's rich . 
  when sergey brin of google found out he has a high possibility of having parkinsons later in life he threw himself into research about the disease and did more than just finance finding a cure . 
  [ good story from the wired on that ] ( http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/06/ff_sergeys_search/all/1 ), 
  because every country is the same and every rule would work well in every place ? 
  did n't take long for good ol' godwin to appear . 
   every single one , without exception . 
  someone call the cyprus akel who has won more than one election there , even after the country got into the eu . 
  i have n't heard them killing anyone , have you ? 
  hair . 
  the scene where they load into the airplane , at the end . 
  at -4 just for asking for a quote . 
  geraffes are dumb, 
  wrong . 
  a lot of countries have signed that treaty , but canada , along with every other major us ally is n't on that list .

  oh come on . 
  i was stuff against blacks , jews and gays , but never heard anything against quebec . 
  post some proof , then you get a right to be an ass . 
  i just mentioned i never saw anything in my three years of reediting . 
  incidental , maybe , but you have n't proved me wrong . 
  maybe the best post on gun culture in the us vs europe i saw on reddit . 
  will save this and post in the future . 
  i 'm 22 and live in a country where happy days never aired . 
  never even seen an episode . 
  and i know . 
  i 'm pissed as anyone , but that is far from a fitting punishment for the crime he did . 
  let him pay , get him to understand what he did and hope he goes on as a person who understood the gravity of what he did . 
  ruining his life is far from making it right . 
  anybody else noticed the shoes and pants ? 
  it looks like he 's off duty or something else , because i doubt they wear that when overseeing a protest . 
  nice balance between nostalgia , feelings and preserving old materials and the need to advance . 
  a bit too long , and just the combination of voice and text does n't exite me much . 
  the voiceover at the end was cool , if that is ron paul 's voice . 
  and every other country . 
  i thought google video was closed ? 
  iran is three times bigger than iraq , and twice more populous . 
  there is n't a 9/11 big enough to draw the us in a war that big . 
  why does rome suck ? 
   falklands war 14,095 , including prisoners, 
  very misleading , since there were less than a thousand casualties . 
  a prisoner is n't a victim . 
  a lot of people were pissed about long discussions of episodes , mostly the recent one . 
  i blame short attention spans and anti intelectualism . 
  a lot of reddits are enforcing stricter rules on images and memes , incidentally a lot of those moderators are on tor . 
  not on the subreddits i love to hang out in . 
  i 've spent some time in an air raid shelter as a kid and my town got bombed a couple of times . 
  whenever i hear a sound resembling the air raid signal something snaps in me and i ca n't help but feel uncomfortable as hell . 
  every year when they test those sirens i put my headphones and turn the music up . 
  what is this , italy ? 
  what attention ? 
  the guy was shooting an air rifle at his neighbours and so the police came . 
  the fact that he 's a veteran and has connections with 15 . o is just conspiracy crap . 
  i have no idea what any of these are . 
  who is twitter to decide that ? 
  or just have a lack of oxygen ? 
  i 'm not much of a hip hop fan , but the beastie boys and their hello nasty . 
  there 's one that spans the whole city of zagreb , croatia . 
  i suck at dancing and hate every song in this game , but dance central was fun and addictive . 
  i found myself sweating and ... gasp ... exercising with my xbox . 
  you are right , but i do n't get what the soviet union has got to do with this ? 
  actually our colleges were full of black africans coming to study whatever . 
  gadaffi learned to fly here . 
  too bad it 's not a link . 
  maybe an addition to res ? 
  i fucked the girl from hanson . 
  gaddafi sold oil to the west for years . 
  was n't r/science a default subreddit for a long time ? 
  what is your opinion on the big bang theory ? 
  i for one hate it . 
  well , did n't * everyone * ? 
  nokia is still the biggest cell phone manufacturer in the world , and symbian only recently lost its # 1 spot . 
  nonsense conspiracy theory that he was killed while on trial . 
  shocked . 
  shocked i say . 
  world peace . 
  i always drink for world peace . 
   and you know this for a fact ? 
  and do you know for a fact that it 's not ?
