  i do n't . 
  that 's why they take him in for questioning and do their job . 
  the only thug thing i see here is that they are unable to do their job , take a single guy in for questioning and use force if he 's resisting . 
  no mention of the french planes that bombed his convoy ? 
  makes it unproffesional , not thuggish . 
  unless they managed to steal a police car they came with as well . 
  ** every ** international football game starts with national anthems . 
  the first full qwerty keyboard on a smartphone was from handspring , the treo 180 got out in 2001. , after which rim , sony , nokia , samsung , motorola and others i do n't bother to remember used full keyboards on phones . 
   source please . 
  seriously ? 
  this is basic history . 
  i did n't state it , jeannaimard did . 
  i 'm just proving that jews are probably the most persecuted group in history . 
  * everyone * is a bit hyperbolic , i 'll give you that , but it 's not far from the truth . 
  did you really think ** everyone ** hates the jews ? 
  hard to account for every single ethnic group and country on the earth and ask them what they think about the jews , is it ? 
  you are clinging to a small point then . 
  sure , if that is your point then i agree with you , but this is n't r/history and i 'm not sure such pedantics are really necessary . 
  unlike the first part of your original comment , which i agree with wholeheartedly . 
  they 're not mutually exclusive . 
  um ... they played for 7 years before licensed to ill. 
  that 's one thing i did n't like about scrubs . 
  i can deal with sad and dark , but scrubs had to rub in a moral in every episode . 
  community does it much more discretely . 
  any speculation on the length of the singleplayer campaign ? 
  oz did a musical episode . 
  after them anyone can . 
  i hate football . 
  but god damnit if i wo n't defend it on reddit on my last breath . 
  everyone else seems to be from an english speaking country . 
  well , that makes sense . 
  i 'd like to participate , but already have doubts about any local political movement . 
  the last 20 years gave me good reasons for that . 
  fuck it , i 'll go on a meeting and see . 
  not that there 's anything wrong with your setup , but i would ... 
  - get a cheap unlocked wifi smartphone or tablet that can almost eliminate the laptop . 
  - swiss army knife or leatherman . 
  what 's wrong with lawyers ? 
  they are the ones most likely to understand the system and how it works . 
  well i agree , but i also understand that under the circumstances it was hard to expect that gaddafi would survive being captured by a group of untrained rebels which he abused for decades . 
  a lot of trained and disciplined soldiers from western countries would n't have the ability to refrain themselves at shooting a tyrant ( * their * tyrant ) , so why does anyone expect better from libyans ? 
  yugoslavia got allied support after the tehran conference in 1943 so i would wager it was then . 
  do people actually buy this stuff ? 
  some countries use a perfume . 
  i predict a wonderful future for you . 
  the picture is misleading , since the island is 38 square kilometers big . 
  it depends on the thread . 
  i noticed this when talking about gun control . 
  on a submission that would gather opponents i would get downvotes for expressing my opinion . 
  on a submission that would gather people who supported it the same post would get upvoted . 
  it all depends what crowd the submission brings in . 
  since i hate tbbt , i would n't even click on the thread . 
  in the us . 
  they were very popular in the rest of europe . 
  i 'm the only person on earth that thinks their first album is their best work . 
  without the dot . 
  for the 100th time : the first qwerty smartphone came out in 2001 . 
  blackberry was n't first , which just proves that something can exist for years , but be hijacked by others . 
  do we call blackberry a clone ? 
  we can stop calling android a clone then too . 
   and yet the country had the highest human development index out of all of africa . 
  gaddafi killed his own people in a popular uprising , the fact that he had oil to fund hospitals and schools does n't mean shit when you turn tyrant and terrorist . 
  you must be mad if you expect libya to accept western values overnight . 
  america was longer against gaddafi than * for * him . 
  not that it changes your point . 
  and killing civilians . 
  the international intervention was started because of the probable slaughter of civilians in benghazi . 
   gaddafi did n't kill anyone, 
  gaddafi was lord and ruler there and a blink would n't happen without his say . 
  not counting the earlier human rights issues , international terrorism and aggression , he ordered the massacre of a minimum of 500 people just in tripoli , according to icc and bbc . 
  that was * before * the rebels took up arms . 
  spoofs ? 
  damnit , i was thinking that the ads were awesome . 
  yeah , i misphrased that . 
  they are awesome , the facts are cool , but i 'm disappointed that they 're not by the museum itself . 
  it is ? 
  have n't seen that stereotype in europe . 
  oh , hello [ yuri ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:yuri_red_alert.jpg ) . 
  have n't heard about the beach on rab in croatia , but i expected [ zlatni rat ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:bol_na_bracu_-_zlatni_rat.jpg ) on bra\u010d . 
   conservatives believe in the ties that bind us ; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other . 
  so i do n't support gay marriage despite being a conservative . 
  i support gay marriage because i 'm a conservative . 
  british prime minister david cameron , on the conservative party conference the other day .

   conspiracy theory without even a string of evidence . 
  now you are claiming he was n't a dictator ? 
  seriously ?

   does that give me the right to bomb the united states to rubble , and send al qaeda to kill bush ? 
  the analogy does n't really stand , but let 's say bush did this to his own people in his own country ( like gaddafi did ) , then i would say that yes , the international community would have an obligation to react . 
  i have no idea why you think i am pro-iraq war or pro-bush just because i 'm not shedding tears over a dead dictator . 
  libya is a better place that it was a week ago , although i would rather see him on trial than dead . 
  no fucked up anywhere . 
  you guys not fans or do n't know about them ? 
  reminded me how genius only fools and horses were . 
  we did n't have that much vietnam games . 
  may i recommend thebox.bz , a torrent site which hosts only british tv and radio content , and lots of it . 
  it was zero when i wrote the comment . 
  glad to see them . 
  flash is the great equalizer .
