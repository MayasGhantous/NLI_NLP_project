  no snaps were made . 
  op is being condescending by thinking subduction has some irl problems and then letting it out on poor him . 
  he is completely right . 
  the point of stand up comedy is timing and delivery . 
  except twitter has shit to do with the arab spring , but the western media likes to think it has . 
  as every other sane person , i read this in groundskeeper willie 's voice . 
  like a lot of strategic weapons in a lot of military forces , it does n't have to be used to reach its goal . 
  it 's [ two tickets to paradise ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyegyvybdum ) and the jump jet cheat for me .

  charlie said he was ok with it , so i guess it was the bbc . 
  what if i do n't have an internet connection on my xbox ? 
  except we * do * know about it . 
  [ pink floyd ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkhx5w7jowi ) thought so too . 
  i think elite wins this one . 
  you have a shitty screen with lines for ships and planets , and have to imagine the whole universe . 
  this has zero to do with r/worldpolitics . 
   let 's tell this to the undercover police provocateurs . 
  yes , there 's a greater chance that a cop is undercover and provoking violence than an asshole with the same cause as you . 
  i 'm not sure 10 years is enough to giva fair historical verdict on some of those things . 
  sure , 9/11 and same sex marriage , but what if harry potter gets forgotten in 10 years ? 
  who will remember windows xp ? 
  both . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_of_muammar_gaddafi#events ), 
   nato aircraft then fired on 11 of the vehicles , destroying one . 
  a u.s. 
  predator drone operated from a base near las vegas [ 10 ] fired the first missiles at the convoy , hitting its target about 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) west of sirte . 
  moments later , french air force fighter jets continued the bombing . 
  [ 12 ] [ 9 ] the nato bombing immobilized much of the convoy and killed dozens of loyalist fighters . 
  following the first strike , some 20 vehicles broke away from the main group and continued moving south . 
  a second nato airstrike damaged or destroyed 10 of these vehicles . 
  [ 9 ] according to the financial times , free libya units on the ground also struck the convoy . 
  very mature of you . 
  am i a agent provocateur as well ? 
  also , [ about fascism ] ( http://orwell.ru/library/articles/as_i_please/english/efasc ) :, 
   it will be seen that , as used , the word ` fascism ' is almost entirely meaningless . 
  in conversation , of course , it is used even more wildly than in print . 
  i have heard it applied to farmers , shopkeepers , social credit , corporal punishment , fox-hunting , bull-fighting , the 1922 committee , the 1941 committee , kipling , gandhi , chiang kai-shek , homosexuality , priestley 's broadcasts , youth hostels , astrology , women , dogs and i do not know what else . 
  expect decriminalization when sdp and the rest form a government . 
  there was a broad coalition then that included some `` family friendly '' parties like hss . 
  with only sdp and hns it could pass easily . 
  harry potter had its last movie months ago . 
  daria finished its original run in 2002 . 
  at least it 's not a clown . 
  you made me listen to offspring now . 
  did anyone dispute that ? 
  although your metric is n't conclusive on that - daria is a show , harry potter is a book-movie franchise . 
  she 's cute . 
  to be fair it gets really annoying in the book . 
  the constant descriptions of brands and shirts and shoes makes me aware of what kind of person patrick is , but also annoys me as a reader too much . 
  the movie made it much more discreet . 
  holy hell every once in a while when i forget that story it comes up . 
  fun , but i did n't use it after the first few tries . 
  unlike the radio , it was expendable . 
  i get the point , but it made the book hard to read . 
  [ david firth ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/h3700/i_am_david_firth_creator_of_salad_fingers_ama/ ) , creator of salad fingers did an ama back in may . 
  please , for the love of god , tell me that it 's true . 
  no personal info rule ? 
   he would have been a better president today then any of the republican nominees, 
  that does n't make him good by a longshot . 
   mcmansions are a lot harder to come by in europe . 
  we do n't have us style suburbs and mcmansions are hard to come by because ... well ... we do n't want them . 
  people just do n't have the need for that kind of megalomania . 
  do you use opera maybe ? 
  of course , but a lot of our cities just are n't built like that . 
  sure there are people with big houses , but only a fraction of the us numbers . 
   beacons and luminaries of human-rights right here . 
  you can say this about any country in the world . 
  anyone has a list of countries and how they voted ? 
  good . 
  neither hss or hsls deserve votes for being a part of this coalition for so long . 
  and we never will . 
  what 's up with the bureau of land managment ? 
  mommy , can i go and trick-or-treat tonight ? 
  lighten up . 
  it may not be as deep as animals , but it features some of the best songs ever , not only out of their catalog , but in general . 
  cake or ... death ? 
  no jefferson ? 
  i like musicals .

  it 's not aid , it is a membership fee that every country has to pay , according to their gdp . 
   i saw a short french documentary on a german/french channel . 
  somebody watches arte ? 
  mostly foreign and not historic because i do n't have nearly enough money to get those . 
  hearts of iron is one of my favorite games of all time . 
  if you had anything to do with it , thank you . 
  every time i recount to americans what problems gypsy people get into in most of europe . 
  ( i wrote this sentence five times now and i 'm going with this version ), 
   scuba gear, 
  i was skeptical , but it ** is ** an acronym :, 
   `` scuba '' originally being an acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus , now widely considered a word in its own right, 
  edit : skeptical , not sceptical . 
  excuse me , english is not my mother tongue . 
  hope that 's not the reason i was downvoted . 
  i 'm happy to say that in my years of fast and loud concerts never once did somebody fall to the floor without getting help to get up after . 
  my carrer is not long , but it was quite polite . 
  it took me far too long to guess what k9 stands for .
