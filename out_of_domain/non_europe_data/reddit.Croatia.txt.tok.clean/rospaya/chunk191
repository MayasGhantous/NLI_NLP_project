  everyone in mfa looks the same . 
  you know your crowd . 
  he made france shoot higher than it can in the international community , but he was far from the most successful ruler . 
  i do n't even need the reaction pictures anymore . 
  [ it does n't always work like that ] ( http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110912/13500315912/hollywood-accounting-darth-vader-not-getting-paid-because-return-jedi-still-isnt-profitable.shtml ), 
  summer 2012 until prices and supply stabilise . 
  while we 're at it , read or watch [ the boys from brazil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boys_from_brazil ) . 
  excellent story , the first thing that came to mind when i saw the thread . 
  croatia has a higher percentage of catholics and we elected an agnostic and atheist presidents and an atheist prime minister . 
  why ? 
  the show lost sense after s03 . 
  you did n't say from where you 're coming in . 
  zadar airport ( as someone mentioned ) has a good connection to london . 
  last year i flew to london from zadar with people coming home from one of those festivals . 
  also if you 're into indie music you should check out terraneo festival in \u0160ibenik , last year was beyond excellent . 
  i flew ryanair . 
  easy jet flies to zagreb and you can get to anywhere from zagreb by bus . 
  i still sob like a little baby when i remember the 2008 game . 
  i booked rather late , about a week before the flight and it was ... checking my mail ... 185 euros total . 
  consider that i flew to stockholm with ryanair once , but i had additional luggage ( 20 euros ) and i booked months in advance and it was 110 euros . 
  we took initiative but the turks forced us into our half now , although they do n't have a single good shot yet . 
  `` zionist bloodlust '' come on , really ? 
  try pula , there 's a festival there too so a lot of brits come in ( i talked to the organizer , they hire two busses that always gets busted for drugs while going through italy but the police just gives up because it 's too much paperwork ) , also there are charter flights to split during the summer , i 'm sure . 
  well he is just like buddy holly . 
  i 'm croatian . 
  guess how gta iv sounded to me . 
  [ sonic youth - diamond sea ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beev2r70lya ), 
  and, 
  the dirtbombs - bugs in the bass bin ( a cover ), 
  swahili in turkey ? 
  that 's a douchy thing to do , but i love the slogan . 
  `` occupy all streets '' sounds about right . 
  the only game i play regularly is rise of nations which came out in 2003 . 
  i have black ops , had mw2 and bf : bc , but i just ca n't get addicted . 
  give us the dates !, 
  they make landmine maps and systems to find and defuse them all . 
  that minefield is n't a problem as much as random fields all around the world that were made during warfare , without any side knowing how much . 
  when the only thing you know is some area has mines , but how many or where or will it ever be safe to walk there again . 
  only one ? 
  does it go away or what ? 
  how do i get it ? 
  seriously , i 'm confused here . 
  i listen to the song every year while chilling at the seaside . 
  like a legal high . 
  how did i get them ? 
  do they go away if i do n't use them ? 
  both questions i asked in my previous post . 
  because everyone who disagrees with you is a cia agent ? 
  i 'm liberal as they go and i would support a humanitarian intervention in syria . 
  the fact that a lot of bloodshed is happening in syria is n't under doubt , even conservative estimates claim over 2500 dead civilians in the recent uprising , and pentagon was against libya , so i 'm sure they would be against fighting a tougher enemy in syria . 
  i know , i 'm not much of a beginner , but only just saw tokens . 
  do n't visit the site often . 
   they 've been wanting to invade syria for years . 
  who ? 
  the us and syria have shaky but stabile relations . 
  they tipped of about the uss cole bombing and the us lifted travel restrictions to syria . 
  cold but nowhere near invasion-prone . 
   they might use color revolutions or proxy terrorist groups instead . 
  sure `` they '' could , but that revolutions seem pretty home grown . 
  this is n't the first time syrians are uprising ( the first one left 20 000 dead ) and they sure as hell have a good reason to revolt against a dictatorship . 
  us ( and western ) hesitation shows that it is n't guided from the outside . 
   how is invading a country and killing many thousands of their people humanitarian ? 
  i never said invasion , but intervention , although i might stand behind an invasion if the conditions are right . 
  americans became so jaded after iraq and afghanistan , they think any engagement their military makes must be oil grabbing and evil . 
  that pretty armed forces you have their could be used for a ** humanitarian ** intervention , aimed at ** humanitarian goals ** , not dumb invasions like iraq . 
  you may be surprised but not every us military engagement is a vietnam , both on accounts of victims and goals . 
  walk in downtown sarajevo or pri\u0161tina and ask them what they think of humanitarian interventions - the us interventions there saved probably thousands of lives , both with zero combat deaths and no invasions . 
  if the international community shows its teeth maybe al-assad would lighten up and allow reforms . 
  the alternative is supressing dissent and protests every couple of years until the whole thing explodes in a bloody civil war . 
  learn the difference between `` invasion '' and `` humanitarian intervention '' . 
  vietnam , iraq , afghanistan on one side , kosovo , bosnia and herzegovina and libya on the other . 
  60 000 dead us soldiers and millions of civilians in the first category , zero us combat deaths and less than 500 civilians in the other . 
  assuming it is true , who is to blame for this ? 
  society , for making 11/11/11 a thing ? 
  family and friends , for having a dumbness echo chamber ? 
  teachers , for letting her roam the streets without basic knowledge ? 
  in heaven or hell ? 
  in that period it would be the pink floyd . 
  i 'm from croatia . 
  went to the store yestarday , just wanted to see what 's new and was surprised that mw3 is already here . 
  the prices are :, 
  ps3 and xbox 360 - $ 90, 
  yeah , i think i 'm gon na wait it out . 
  we have a much lower crime rate than a lot of other countries . 
  the thing i 'm least worried about is violent crime . 
   parliament - it 's not difficult to spot . 
  understatement of the year . 
  that thing is huge . 
  not to comment on your point , but can someone explain to me how will this affect the economy ? 
  which shows that most of the us public are an embarrasment , not just politicians debating it . 
  i was expecting an archer reference . 
  was n't disappointed anyway . 
  [ check out my last.fm ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/rospaya2 ) and find out . 
  no , not beer snobs . 
  just assholes . 
  i consider myself a snob in some fields , but i know when not to shit on people because of a fucking beverage . 
  i know there are a couple of us in the hood . 
  that does not make him smart . 
  it makes him rich .
