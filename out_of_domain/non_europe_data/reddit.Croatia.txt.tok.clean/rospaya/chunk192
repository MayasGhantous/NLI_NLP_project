  i hear the similarity , but far from a ripoff . 
  both songs are known to me and i heard it before , but did n't take it seriously . 
  anyone else ? 
  one legend says that ozzy and geezer got beat by skinheads and wrote this song in return . 
  fairies being skinheads . 
  iommi claims that it was about them seeing fairies wearing boots in a park while they were smoking . 
  so it 's anyone 's guess .

  a series of disturbing pictures from new york from 1965 to 1995 . 
  the author is a danish photographer that , after being mugged , decided to document the struggle of low income blacks .

  fuck science , man . 
   once again , this is n't how ratings work . 
  but by sharing the good word sponsors , network execs , journalists and nielsen families get more awareness and the show gets not only better ratings but a better reputation . 
  and i 'm the first to say that it 's pornhub.com , not . net ? 
  shame on reddit . 
  did n't expect such stereotyping from r/history . 
  here !, 
  [ tportal.hr ] ( http://www.tportal.hr/ ) imo the best news portal . 
  [ index.hr ] ( http://www.index.hr/ ) the fastest news portal with decent commentary from time to time .

  you 're right . 
  but what 's even more interesting is that schwarzenegger would be one of the sanest candidates . 
  that was an awesome ama . 
  the guy answered a lot of questions , he came to reddit for its other subreddits and not so much for promotion and the answers were long and detailed .

  not to diss on sebadoh , but lou barlow had a bigger contribution in dinosaur jr , you know . 
  let 's not confuse appropriate sentencing with the way china does it . 
  death penalty is n't cool . 
  i phrased that wrong . 
  dinosaur jr had a bigger contribution than sebadoh . 
  it 's like saying ringo starr of thomas the tank engine . 
  maybe on a certain shore in a certain eastern us state . 
  does everyone live in the same country and know people with the same habits ? 
  what 's the probability that this is fake ? 
  yeah . 
  maybe something on their arm , like a star or triangle . 
  after that we can easily concentrate people , so they can be in their own company . 
  hello . 
  i like that you asked that question here . 
  / r/history is mostly well mannered and careful , so themes like this can have get a better answer here than in / r/politics . 
  the eleanor roosevelt one , which i did n't see in this thread because i see it on reddit quite frequently :, 
   great minds discuss ideas ; average minds discuss events ; small minds discuss people . 
  it does n't mean shit . 
  i 've read many interesting discussions about a lot of people . 
  in the last week i learned a lot about wwii and history in general out of a discussion about hitler on / r/history and saw a lot of stupid discussions about capital punishment and ows , interesting ideas that can attract naive opinions . 
  so it does n't depend on what the subject is , but who the minds that discuss it are . 
  the intent may be , but in practice it does n't mean much . 
  your analysis of the quote is the most positive possible , mine would be the opposite . 
  i was just kidding , although i * do * disagree with your idea . 
  fucking canadians with their fucking bags . 
   i 'd like to live off the band , but if not , i 'll just retire to mexico or yugoslavia with a few hundred dollars , grow potatoes , and learn the history of rock through back issues of creem magazine . 
  the subject is stifling dissent and censorship . 
  except for slovenia , kosovo and montenegro , the balkans are pretty much what they are today . 
  does that mean we 're the most evolved ? 
  edit : a bad joke it seems . 
  if i am not mistaken , you pay a small fee with every gps enabled device you buy . 
  a fixed price for using gps . 
  i 'm not sure , but i think i read about that a long time ago . 
  open does n't have to be free . 
  only one person had the guts to show that on tv before . 
  he does n't work on hrt anymore . 
  something lik denis latin ... ? 
  that the punishment for playing an excellent first game . 
  they 're trying to peddle them to croatia as well . 
  we would get them free , but pay a ton of money for new engines , transport , training and other stuff . 
  in the same time we would get new saab gripens from sweden and a great offset program . 
  it 's just distrurbing to name stuff for living people . 
  the shawshank redemption did n't flop . 
  it made a little over budget . 
   a pregnant protester named jennifer fox has miscarried after being pepper sprayed and hit in the stomach by seattle police officers during a peaceful protest last week . 
  reminds me of the plot of battle in seattle . 
  oh good , i 'm glad you whipped out your note pad and checked all the things that make a true american so you can say that today . 
  shit , got ta go work on my true croat checklist , see you later shogun565 . 
  reminds me of the [ ny city homicide map ] ( http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map ) . 
  trademark does n't mean copyright . 
  it just means that another cell phone company ca n't use it for advertisement . 
  my mistake . 
  i was n't aware that a true american ( tm anheuser-busch corp ) exists . 
  nobody would be dumb enough to vote for bush twice , right ? 
  or a dumb adjective meaning exactly nothing ? 
   represents our ideals . 
  that 's what i 'm aiming at . 
  does a country have ideals ? 
  do people have ideals ? 
  if he is a true american , are all other americans false ones ? 
  what about pacifists , i bet there are quite a few in the us that would n't agree with any person fighting a war ? 
  do you now see how vapid and dumb that statement is ? 
  say he 's a good person , a patriot , a model of something you see as a `` true american '' , but do n't tell 300 million people you found a man that they would all love . 
  sounds like something out of a right-wing , bible thumping guide . 
  no , i 'm pointing out the stupidity of that statement . 
  and how i react when people say that about people in my country . 
  reddit fuzzes the upvote/downvote situation you see on your right side . 
  the current 74 % is a huge advantage . 
  edit : some [ proof ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/ifeho/what_is_the_point_of_showing_upvote_and_downvote/ ) for the [ downvoters ] ( http://www.reddit.com/help/faq ? 
  ? #howisasubmissionsscoredetermined ), 
   made you look like one of the stereotypical europeans that use every opportunity to criticize everything about america, 
  i criticized nothing about america , nor was it my intention , which is why i mentioned my own country , since i hear similar things about some of my own countrymen . 
  i criticized the people who think there is a `` real < insert nationality  '' . 
  there is n't , and using it as an idiom does n't change the fact that it 's a dumb thing to say .
