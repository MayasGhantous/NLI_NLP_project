  i 'll gladly take all the downvotes on this , because saying `` true x '' is just intellectual laziness of pulling out a patriotic argument instead of typing two more sentences of sane arguments . 
  instead of saying what he actually feels about him , he just got lazy and went for the low shot . 
  `` awesome man [ ... ] very honest '' - if this is an argument for a true american i guess the list just got bigger . 
  edit : you are right , i could have went the other way and explained myself , not be an asshole , but my reaction stands . 
  when reddit does patriotism ( which is rare ) , it 's the same mentality i see on fox news and free republic . 
   you made an obnoxious post typical of that minority of europeans . 
  needless stereotyping, 
   and again you demonstrate that you do n't understand idioms . 
  they do n't always make sense and convey a general idea . 
  i studied the whole wikipedia page on idioms , just in case i missed something ( english is not my first language ) , and your point does n't stand . 
  what i saw there was a lazy phrase with an empty meaning . 
  even if it used to stand for something , feel free to google `` true american '' and see for yourself for what spectrum of people it is used - except being from the us , they do n't share a single characteristic . 
  which brings us back to the start . 
  op said that shit just because he was lazy to write what he really felt . 
  you are just defending your country from snotty europeans , not the phrase or r. lee ermey . 
  it is not an idiom . 
  it is laziness . 
   studs not on top, 
  this is n't right . 
  buy another one you rich motherfucker !, 
  more women are in the workforce today than men , so the whole argument goes down . 
  of course . 
  / r/history might be of more service . 
  in short , some regimes were friendly to axis causes and got them shelter . 
  i 'm really interested what would happen if you took a gun to a protest . 
  the cop would n't dare hit you or would shoot you because he saw you as a threat ? 
  to a protest that turns violent ? 
  what if the veteran people in oakland had weapons ? 
  you never go ass to mouth . 
  unless it 's great peripherals . 
  you 're just being anal . 
  i 'm not so sure , we already have the token black guy . 
  that 's whack . 
  it 's almost as if people have a lot of dumb stereotypes about eastern europe . 
  not to be a shallow ass , but did n't one of the hosts have big boobs ? 
  maybe under some angles , but it looks like she has two of them . 
  let 's be fair , a stereotype exists about women with big fake boobs . 
  that 's why baaabydoll should resist making men lick her shoes and use her newfound powers for good . 
  and of course post more pics for us , but that goes without telling . 
  how does this work ? 
  someone said `` get ipads '' ? 
  do n't you have to put up requirements , get some advice on what the kids need , then run a public offering ? 
  you ca n't just say `` hey , let 's get a closed tablet pc platform made by a single company for educating our kids . '', 
  i dislike most movies with aliens , but d9 was excellent . 
  one of the better sf movies i saw . 
  nowadays we just call it the guardian . 
  today as well , even double that . 
  i 'm gon na buy a couple of them . 
  not because i do n't have a shitload of their bootlegs , and their whole discography . 
  but because this is an excellent step that will me the chance to give back to the band , especially since i have n't paid anything for their music . 
  very jelaous . 
  does ian always wear that hat ? 
  so ** that 's ** why it did n't work !, 
  here is the [ original article ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/8916947/apartheid-row-at-norwegian-school-after-it-segregates-ethnic-pupils.html ) from the telegraph . 
  sony was always a worldwide player , while xbox even today is n't supported in a big number of countries . 
  even in my small country ps3 was always accesible in my language , worked well with my cards and had extensive local support ( ps3 launch , gt launch were all private parties with local celebrities and free booze ) . 
  but even in 2011 i can get banned any day just for using xbox live outside of their supported countries . 
  and this is the company i bought two xboxes , two controllers , headphones , gold subscriptions and games from . 
  just compare the maps for [ sony ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:playstation_network_availability_map.svg ) and [ microsoft ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:xbl_map2.png ), 
  i did n't click any since the only one i would remotely want to vote for was n't even there . 
  thanks for the answer , but maybe un-linking those walls of text might be of service to people who like to click and mark the text while reading . 
  i read it as `` doomsday book '' and wondered why i did n't hear about this earlier . 
  jon huntsman . 
  that indeed looks nice , but i cringe at the thought of sleeping in a bed and not having my legs stretched all the way . 
  if it was somalia at least you would be sure she swallows . 
  i 'm not much older than her and i live on the other side of the planet , but muppets are pop culture , you ca n't * not * know who they are , even if you haven 's seen a single episode . 
  i do n't get it why she would n't know . 
  pic one is what we call bacon . 
  these look incredibly comfortable . 
  croatian actually , but i guess i speak for eastern europe . 
  hns , but since they are in kukuriku i guess them then . 
  as someone who lived through a cluster bombing - good . 
  i 'm talking about myself , not the picture . 
  we call `` salo '' the fat , white part . 
  op crossposted this to 8 other subreddits , from / r/libertarian to / r/trees and / r/ents . 
  ** not worldnews op **, 
  yup !, 
  they 're not that ultra cheap for what they do . 
  a top of the line drone is still just for reconnaissance and bombing targets , while a modern combat aircraft can be a fighter/bomber . 
  not many airforces can bear the cost of having seperate bombers and fighters in their inventory ( hence the f-35 ) . 
  you still have to train the crew and have an infrastructure that supports it . 
  in the end a drone * is * cheaper , but not in a way that a lot of countries can justify , since one can be shot down without as much trouble as a human pilot driving a fighter jet . 
  how shitty should a school be to * not * have a copy of the bible already ? 
  as well as about a couple of hundred other pieces of basic literature . 
  the torygraph is n't exemplary , but i could n't stand seeing a single source from presstv . 
  i 'm glad that both yours and opposite opinions have their place in this thread . 
  reddit may often be polarising , but rarely in the same thread . 
  downvoted not because i don ' agree with your point , but because you put out a thoughtful argument and then insulted everyone who does n't agree with you . 
  i feel like i 've wasted my youth . 
  men will jerk off to just about anything . 
  * unzips pants *, 
  golda meir put 13 tactical atomic bombs on alert during the yom kippur war , not strictly ready to use them , but as a pressure signal to the us that israel needed supplies . 
  so yes , israel had more than several weapons in 1973 . 
  why ? 
  croatia uses a standard proportional system ( d'hont method ) , not fptp . 
  the avereges tab shows that people are on average giving less every year . 
  sad . 
  edit : `` sad '' was my comment on the state of the economy , as in = the average person does n't have as much money to donate . 
  not really , the nearest one would involve either driving or public transport . 
  do n't own a car , not really in shape to travel that much .
