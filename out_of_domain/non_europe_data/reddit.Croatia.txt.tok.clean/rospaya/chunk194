  thanks . 
  dieting is my priority , but i 'm sure i ca n't manage on that alone , since i 'm not the most motivated person around , and activity attracts me more than restraint . 
   what have you done to your leg and can you not put any pressure at all on it ? 
  a friendly wrestle gone wrong . 
  now i 'm contemplating on what exercises i could manage that would n't hurt much . 
  i use the highly usable rule of `` do n't be a dick '' . 
  works well in * all * walks of life . 
  op , your picture looks depressing as hell . 
  i started singing say it ai n't so involuntarily . 
  shit over hollywood all you want , but nobody can deny that david fincher has an excellent track record , and despite the excellent swedish version i 'm sure he 'll do an awesome job . 
  i posted there , but if anyone is interested over here : www.cvijet.hr . 
  they 're fast , reliable although not really cheap . 
  like the neocons say `` the road to jerusalem goes through baghdad . '', 
  what did we do to deserve this ? 
  ** you ** , ugly woman !, 
  you are the boner murderer !, 
  and you are ignoring another important factor ( which often gets ignored even in professional analysis ) - fires . 
  attractive people of the opposite sex . 
  drunk moderator is n't afraid to use his powers for gloating . 
  i approve . 
  how do you sleep at night ? 
  is there a reason for this ? 
  the subreddit is n't that huge and you guys have been doing a good job . 
  we still do n't have the exact idea what te diagnosis is , but the article states that he was psychotic , which is n't just based on his ideology and the act he did . 
   the police officer who shot scott olsen in the face was trained in israel . 
  i found no reputable source about this . 
  do you have any ? 
  music labels are n't smart or innovative , just like the rest of the entertainment industry . 
  until we get a steam equivalent for music , movies and tv shows there will be piracy . 
  * but rospaya , we have netflix , hulu and itunes !, 
  if you live in the us , then you have a choice , yes . 
  but that choice is still limited . 
  while i , outsite the us , have shit . 
  why is n't the self post circlejerk banned ? 
   the department of education is a disaster ( think no child left behind ) . 
  that 's the reason to abolish it ? 
  a policy is n't working , let 's destroy the whole organization behind it ? 
  well i know who i 'm voting for . 
  iceland was the first independent country to recognize croatia . 
  lithuania was the first unrecognized , after slovenia . 
  major winters . 
  i call him that as well . 
  next elections , the local ones unfortunately . 
  close enough . 
  mine should be coming in a couple of days to croatia . 
  i 'll fill you in with if you do n't get a good answer by then . 
  nokia has been working on a similar technology for at least 6 years . 
  but like anything from that company , a competitor has to make it first so they can realise it works . 
  * not * worldpolitics people . 
  please leave the us politics to all the other us subreddits and let us have our little place on reddit . 
  * not * worldpolitics . 
  i just put [ jesus was a communist ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n905d497ynq ) by the reagan youth over and over . 
  yugoslavia had some pretty cool architecture . 
  the thing that scares me the most is that she actually said a few smart words on pakistan the other day . 
  she of all people . 
  ** not ** worldnews . 
  and yet opera is smaller than both chrome and firefox . 
  opera and microsoft have a belligerent history so i doubt that would happen . 
  opera just would n't give itself away . 
  no , it says that despite all of the features opera is still lighter than competition . 
  because everyday i see at least a couple of articles in / r/worldpolitics or / r/worldnews about the us and people saying things like `` oh but it has * something * to do with the world '' or `` us politics has a big impact on the world '' . 
  the fact that it is an article from . de does n't change that . 
  morocco looks like it wants a can of whoopass . 
  i heard that e.t. 
  shoots first this time . 
  fringe lunatic . 
  / r/atheism used to be a big deal for reddit , a long time ago when programming and not believing were the two qualifiers for redditors . 
  the upside is that today we have a more diverse community . 
  the downside is that september is becoming eternal . 
   why the hell would anyone get mad over that ? 
  because i 'm afraid one day they 'll like the smell of money more than the sound of music . 
  that 's why i agree with what they said , they took some money and turned down others that do n't fit in with their philosophy . 
  i like that . 
  this physically hurts me . 
  having good music , popularity and ethics is extremely difficult and not even under consideration by most bands . 
  that 's why i like the fugazi story . 
  they never charged shows over $ 5 , they charged minimal for their records ( which they distributed themselves ) , they did n't sell any other merchandise and are about to open a `` pay what you want '' archive of 800 live shows . 
  they refused interviews in magazines that had advertisements of products they did n't find ethical . 
   during the bands sold-out 3-night stint at new york city 's roseland ballroom in september 1993 , music mogul and atlantic records president ahmet erteg\u00fcn met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them . 
  erteg\u00fcn offered the band `` anything you want '' , their own subsidiary label and more than $ 10 million just to sign with atlantic . 
  fugazi declined the offer . 
  despite that they sold millions of albums and never sold out even for a second . 
  of course i do n't expect that from anyone , but just wanted to point out that it is possible . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catherine_wheel_ ( firework ), 
  do you know how many italians spoke italian when that country was established ? 
  do you know out of how many warring regions present day germany was made ? 
  have you any idea out of how many peoples did we end up the united kingdom ? 
  yes , yugoslavia was a myth as much as those countries are . 
  the thing is yugoslavia failed . 
  i get your point but i 'm not sure i would agree . 
  for one , fugazi was never huge , they were just big and their culture started in the early 80 's with minor threat , rites of spring and other bands . 
  they just did their thing . 
  on the other side you have a shitload of other 90s bands that `` sold out '' but regained their fanbase . 
   go to jupiter in a rocket ship to see the robots there . 
  lucas seems to be ahead of the rest of us . 
  do you work for nasa or the dod maybe ?!, 
  kidding . 
  good luck with everything . 
  it is pri\u0161tina . 
  \u0160 is more or less pronounced as `` sh '' in english .
