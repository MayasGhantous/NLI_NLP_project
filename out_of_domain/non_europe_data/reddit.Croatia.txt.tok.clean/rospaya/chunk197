  half of them were assigned reading in my highschool . 
  darwin , swift and machiavelli . 
  smith and paine in my first year of college . 
   he represents real change, 
  you are implying that any change is good change . 
  was n't there an ama from a guy that had an encyclopedic knowledge of all things batman ? 
  found it : http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/i4b52/iama_batman_fan_who_made_an_academic_career_out/, 
  why do you think those sites will be taken down ? 
  if used strictly and by definition sopa would destroy half of the internet in a week . 
  it 's obvious that they 'll use it only when they feel like it , taking down sites that either do it all the time or they just do n't like . 
  yeah , downvote this guy !, 
  fuck him for giving his opinion and asking a question !, 
   we are of southern extraction , but my folks believe in maintaining a strong cultural connection to the mother continent, 
  by celebrating a holiday made up probably after your parents were born ? 
  i 'm not american and i live in a country with maybe dozens of black people so race relations are n't my thing , but by everything i read , kwanzaa seems like a forced holiday for black people who after hundreds of years do n't want to confess they are asimilated to their country 's culture ( not implying christianity ) . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm neither offended or mad that anyone is celebrating it . 
  for the most part i do n't care . 
  the part that confuses me is when i make the same analogy for myself . 
  if i celebrated the culture of some place where my people came from hundreds of years ago , and at that based on race . 
  it was invented by a guy that wanted to make an alternative christmas for black people . 
  that 's about it . 
  when i say `` forced '' i do n't mean forcefully made to celebrate , but made out of thin air with hints of culture taken from a place where your ancestors came from hundreds of years ago . 
  feel free to correct me then . 
  the paranoia and hype over sopa is enormous on reddit . 
  homeland . 
   i ca n't imagine how anyone could vote for obama after what he 's done . 
  look at the alternative to obama , then frantically run to vote for him . 
  damian lewis ( band of brothers , homeland ) does a mean american accent . 
  he 's english . 
  oh and christian bale , i had no idea he was english until recently . 
   i have seen some things i will not mention . 
  i am extremely curious now . 
   an influx of new users who do n't even know how reddit works, 
  how in the name of all that is holy did that get more than 600 points ? 
   and may i remind all of you who do n't agree with his foreign policy . 
  he is the chosen commander and chief of the united states of america 's military . 
  the military wants him as president . 
  if you really want to honor them , then why do n't you listen to what they want . 
  has / r/politics gone that bad ? 
  do something radical . 
  shut down the subreddit for a few hours or a day with a big sign of what will be and what wo n't be tolerated . 
  remove downvotes for a day or two . 
  ban circlejerking self posts . 
  make a point by putting your boot down and moderating heavy offenders . 
  what 's with the green shit on top ? 
  which means many would leave which in turn would be better if you ask me .

  / r/music is n't a radio station . 
  josip jovi\u0107 ( the journalist ) made up a fake interview with norac . 
  he 's on hrt 's board today . 
  the irony is that / mu / is one of the better boards . 
  vertical limit ? 
  so-so movie . 
  and the whole pixies discography every week . 
  that does n't make him a good guy . 
  he still supressed opposition , ordered people killed and tortured . 
  one right does n't correct a dozen things he 's done wrong , extremely wrong . 
  tunisia also had a high degree of religious freedoms ( a saw a mosque and a church in the same street , rarely a hijab and one of the oldest synagogues is in tunisia ) yet they overthrew their dictator for lesser evils than assad . 
   syria is the only middle eastern country ( with the exception of israel ) where pluralism ( i.e. 
  different religious convictions ) are tolerated . 
  you forgot jordan . 
  at least green day is punk . 
  pop-punk but way more punk than anything in the op 's title . 
  this subject comes up every week , but moderators claim that everything is going great . 
  meanwhile you have a front page of 23 links to music , one news and one self post . 
  at the same time look at the smaller / r/movies , which is currently under siege by recent dark knight and hobbit trailers . 
  it still has reviews , questions , theories , explanations , debates and humor on the front page . 
  it 's a shame . 
  germany has hundreds of troops stationed in the us . 
   why the hell would n't you want us to get rid of our 900 bases around the world ? 
  we do n't need to police everyone else and waste our money in their countries . 
  since i 'm not american i really do n't care about this , but do you know how much of the us economy ( trade ) is based on bullying other countries into submission ? 
  the fact that the us has the broadest military network in the world means that it is the most influential . 
  why do you think so many troops are stationed around the world ? 
  economic interest . 
  that 's something i had in mind , thanks . 
  over 600 in holloman air force base and hundreds elsewhere .
