  i read this at least 20 times , love it . 
   htc sense is the crapiest thing htc could have done to android . 
  i love sense . 
  could n't stand two minutes with that samsung , lg or motorola crap . 
  it 's vanilla or sense for me . 
  my a500 weeps in the corner . 
  well it 's a great movie , with a feelgood ending , but really not `` imdb # 1 material . '', 
  i do n't know who this skrillex is , but she looks like a nice lady . 
  which explains the tension . 
  the canadians . 
  they walk among us . 
  william shatner . 
  michael j. 
  fox . 
  monty hall . 
  mike meyers . 
  alex trebek . 
  all of them canadians . 
  all of them here . 
  here 's a couple :, 
  - ban youtube links for a day or two, 
  - maybe even make one day self links only, 
  - experiment with removing downvotes in comments, 
  - make contests and promote discussions, 
  - remove every song that has been posted more than 5 times in the last year, 
  - music subreddit of the week is cool ( something i said to raerth some time ago so it * may * be my idea ) , but it needs to be taken up a notch, 
  i 'm a / mu/tant . 
  but that does n't mean i do n't want to make this place better . 
  complete pixies discography every week . 
  i downvote my favorite band at this point . 
  i do the passive agressive [ thing ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/nji0y/pixies_where_is_my_mind/c39npzu ) . 
  freddie was bisexual . 
  prettiest , not best . 
  a lot of countries have data retention policies , but this time it is made universal throught the eu . 
  comparing drd and the current law in my country makes the directive even better , since it specifies the need for a court warrant , and that the retained data does n't include the content of communication . 
  i would rather it does n't exist , but i understand the need for it . 
  only recent ? 
  i 'm a music journalist so i had to listen to a shitton of albums to contribute to our list . 
  it goes like this :, 
  best album, 
  pj harvey - `` let england shake '', 
  tom waits - `` bad as me '', 
  danger mouse & daniele luppi - `` rome '', 
  ... adele - `` 21 '' , bon iver - `` bon iver '' , fleet foxes - `` helplessness blues '' , radiohead - `` the king of limbs '' , foo fighters - `` wasting light '' , glasvegas - `` euphoric / / / heartbreak \\ \\ \\ '' , ry cooder - `` pull up some dust and sit down '' ... 
  i was in awe how great this is , and how genius you are . 
  until i googled it and saw that it 's a quote : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_language_is_a_dialect_with_an_army_and_navy, 
  can you answer a few questions ? 
  i 'm thinking of buying it . 
  did you play guitar before ? 
  what is your learning progress ? 
  could you play a song without the game ? 
  it 's not like / r/urbanplanning is going to grow much more . 
  a single meme is n't a sing of end times and it certainly wo n't kill the subreddit . 
  ... dead . 
  the us navy made security changes after uss cole . 
  carriers are stationed far from the coast , they have a ton of support and while iran may have a hundred speedboats , they would be sunk before getting to it . 
  they would have more luck with a rush of rockets or maybe some newer chinese technology . 
  i have wet dreams about that game . 
  until we get it i 'll have to play rise of nations and hearts of iron . 
  how ? 
  the latest us carrier ( uss john f kennedy , ford class ) will have just over 75 airplanes . 
  the 50 biggest air forces have 100 fighters or more . 
  the us imports more from canada than iraq and saudi arabia combined . 
  the thing is that oil prices are a global thing , and blocking one gulf makes the canadian and mexican oil more expensive . 
  so you can have all the independence you want , but when iran does their thing all the prices rise . 
  great , thanks . 
  i think he meant to say it but this way i 'm not sure . 
  as a european , i have no idea what you guys are talking about . 
  be honest with yourself and say what you wanted : blacks and latinos are to blame , right ? 
  savior of the universe !, 
  very original guys . 
  it 's not like sony does n't get hacked each week . 
  you may have heard about queen elizabeth ii , but probably for her role as queen of the united kingdom . 
   and it is n't the 80 's anymore, 
  i fucking knew it , rick astley !, 
  interesting . 
  how do they charge for customs then ? 
  22 here , i first heard of nirvana , and only later about foo fighters . 
  your perspective is n't wrong , but nirvana was more important and bigger than foo fighters will ever be . 
  i do n't think anyone is trying to translate the system nation to nation , but rather nation to state . 
  which is why the author mentions that there are 18 states with same or lower number of immigrants than finland . 
  which makes the numbers ( right or wrong ) irrelevant . 
  not to mention that lower classes have more children than high and middle .

   pets or children, 
  yeah , whatever 's cool with you . 
  not worldpolitics . 
  this is a quality question op , and thanks for making it . 
  did i see your battlestation on / g / maybe ? 
  not worldpolitics . 
  not worldpolitics . 
  what 's spirit week ? 
  is circlejerk the last destination a subreddit can get to ? 
  what is the purpose of this submission ? 
  good thing that worthiness is measured by number of submissions on / r/music . 
  * not sure if sarcastic *, 
  it looks like this time it 's pretty straightforward .
