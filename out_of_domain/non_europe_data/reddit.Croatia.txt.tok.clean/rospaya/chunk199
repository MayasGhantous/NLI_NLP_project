  no link ( thus no link karma ) , just the name and `` awesome , so awesome '' . 
  if only / r/music would be more similar to / mu / in other places . 
  bonus round , from / r/askreddit , just the last 6 months :, 
  anyone has a bigger resolution ? 
  i love these . 
  thanks . 
  i have the second one already . 
  this is my passive agressive way of dealing with excessive reposts . 
  i understand the downvotes i get , but i have no other idea how to communicate this issue to people . 
  my main point is n't the repost , but the fact that this is a very * very * well known songs that has been posted on reddit a lot of times . 
  out of 25 links on the front page of / r/music , 20 are youtube links to songs , most of them well known . 
  this is n't facebook where you post your current mood and favorite tunes and the main reason people do this is karma and circlejerking . 
  i mean , shit . 
  [ look at the crap i saw recently ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/nyyfe/what_song_plays_at_your_funeral_go/c3d27az ) and say that this is normal . 
   but the fact is with hundreds of thousand of people there are thousands that have n't seen this yet . 
  by that logic we have to repost things until everyone had seen it ? 
  although i think / r/music should n't be `` hey everyone let 's just link to songs '' i get pissed off when i see super famous songs posted a lot of times . 
   i get the feeling that you 're just being selfish . 
  i 'm sorry if you feel that way , but / r/music is going to the gutter and this is the only way i can think of to make a difference . 
  you could say the same thing for the bible . 
  and is n't it just prose , not music ? 
  are you suggesting / r/music should introduce you to every piece of music that 's worth anything ? 
  as i said , the issue is that this subreddit consists almost exclusively of youtube links of semi-popular songs by known bands . 
  this is karma whoring and circlejerking . 
  chang from community . 
  only to be replaced with himself from season one . 
  i 'm happy for you , but by your reasoning / r/music would go to shit . 
  oh look , it is . 
  reposts are n't the massive issue here , it 's the fact that almost all of the submissions on / r/music frontpage at any moment are youtube links . 
  i would post radiohead every goddamned day if it means that we 'll have a good thread with discussions and comments that are more than `` awesome , so awesome '' . 
  this is / r/music , but it is n't / r/postyourfavoritemusicallthefuckingtime . 
   question : do you not like the song maggot brain ? 
  sure i do . 
   for example , i only sort of like radiohead , so if i saw them on the frontpage more than once i would probably downvote . 
  but i could never downvote maggot brain . 
  they are my favorite band , and feel free to check my last.fm for that , but i regularly downvote pixies submissions . 
  one reason is that this subreddit is n't / r/postanyrandomsong , the second is that most pixies songs here are reposts . 
  most people do n't click on / r/music , but upvote any song they see on their frontpage and move on . 
  that makes the most famous stuff come on top , and that hurts discussion and quality . 
  mods are ignoring this and are letting the hivemind decide , which lowers the quality and makes this subreddit awful for anything meaningful . 
  i gave you ( and other mods ) my suggestions a couple of times now . 
  after i was [ dismissed and almost ridiculed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/npxu9/does_anyone_else_browse_this_subreddit_and_think/c3bidwd ) by one of the mods i gave up on communicating with you . 
  now i 'm doing the passive-agressive thing and [ do ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/npjpk/buffalo_springfield_for_what_its_worth/c3ayxnd ) [ the ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/nygu8/justice_dance/c3d17p5 ) [ ridiculing ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/nynvs/funkadelic_maggot_brain/c3d15bs ) [ myself ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/music/comments/nyyfe/what_song_plays_at_your_funeral_go/c3d27az ) . 
  this is / r/music , not / r/postanysongyoulike . 
  and since most people just upvote songs they like from their front page , we lose discussions , news and quality content for meaningless youtube links . 
  not since they started using html5 . 
  which does n't encourage quality . 
   the republic of croatia is a unitary and indivisible democratic and social state . 
  power in the republic of croatia is derived from the people and belongs to the people as a community of free and equal citizens . 
  the people shall exercise this power through the election of representatives and through direct decision-making . 
   1 , 2 and 3 would probably cause more fuss than it 's worth , which is why we prefer not to try them . 
  many other subreddits tried it and in a lot of places is worked , even as an experiment . 
  what 's the worst that could happen ? 
  you would have to lose several hundred thousand subscribers to be the second biggest music subreddit . 
   5 would definitely cause drama . 
  which would die down after some time . 
  i would volunteer to do this if you guys do n't have the time or will , i already do it by scouting / new and downvoting it there . 
  strong moderation leads to quality content , askscience is a great example . 
  as a music journalist :, 
   1 ) you ca n't complain about a dull year in music if all you do is report on the pile of cds that ended up on your desk as a result of public relations and major label marketing . 
  i agree . 
  but the fact is that popular music is the zeitgeist of the moment we live in . 
  sure you can say that mainstream music this year was boring , but i reviewed both well known and less know music and still most of it * was * uninspirational . 
   2 ) even if you are looking outside the pile , chances are you 're still looking in the wrong places . 
  again i can agree , but every journalist has to have standards and reviewing ( and listening ) to every crap out there is exhausting and counter productive . 
  that 's why i limit myself to things that have some buzz , proven quality or innovation . 
   3 ) if it 's boring , do not write about it . 
  unless you have an editor and do your job . 
  about the great pacific garbage patch :, 
   since plastics break down to ever smaller polymers , concentrations of submerged particles are not visible from space , nor do they appear as a continuous debris field . 
  instead , the patch is defined as an area in which the mass of plastic debris in the upper water column is significantly higher than average . 
  there are 6 posts on the front page by the same user , all of them completely unrelated to worldpolitics . 
  your inaction made that possible . 
  people who subscribe to / r/politics do n't care if they go here or there for their content and just upvote it anyway , which leaves the rest of us out to dry . 
   but we have never been / r/listentothis, 
  with 20 ot of 25 links being songs on youtube , / r/music has turned into the mainstream version of / r/listentothis . 
  how about a mix of both ? 
  and not 20 music links and 5 random ? 
  the moderator [ clearly said ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/nylat/glenn_greenwald_on_progressives_and_ron_paul_his/c3d4xr1 ) that she/he does n't have the intention to actually moderate . 
  do you have the original maybe ? 
  some have the courage to confront their mistakes . 
  i agree . 
  why was the subreddit given to the current moderators if they do n't plan to even moderate ? 
  annarchist [ wrote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/nylat/glenn_greenwald_on_progressives_and_ron_paul_his/c3dapj8?context=3 ) that he does n't have the intention of moderating , which is grounds enough for dismissal . 
  your genre definitions are off then . 
  there is one album that can put me to sleep anytime . 
  days of future passed by the moody blues . 
  have you listened to let england shake ? 
  the thing i noticed with some people is that they are against the eu just because it was forced . 
  no public debates , no education ... 
  but i understand . 
  if hdz said air was good for me i would n't breathe anymore . 
  the issue is n't genres and popular music , but the fact that it is just full of youtube links to ( mostly ) popular songs . 
   i expected a reddit where i would get a bunch of embedded youtube links with good songs to listen to . 
  but based on the top 20 posts the front page is currently 50 % discussion , 15 % songs , 25 % articles/interviews , and 10 % question/survey . 
  currently , because all of the dissent in the last few days . 
  usually ( and i counted it more than ten times ) it is 20 songs and 5 random submissions . 
  but this subreddit was given to them , they did n't create it . 
  they got control through a similar request like this one , but were proven to be bad moderators . 
  why you are ignoring this issue is baffling to me .
