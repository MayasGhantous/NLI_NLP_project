  i think the candidate has to be dead , but if his face ends up on front pages ( or the internet ) he 'll be close to that . 
  how about the power to move you ? 
  wikipedia has a couple of great articles about nations developing wmd 's , with a focus on atomic weapons . 
  if i remember correctly , the only country that developed such weapons on it 's own and gave it up is south africa . 
   t is easier to rob by setting up a bank than by holding up a bank clerk .

  some people believe that the event started the war . 
  fisty seems like a keeper . 
  fuck yes i hate papercuts !, 
  i do n't care about carrying thousands of books in a single device , or having access to a store of hundreds of thousands of books , but papercuts man , that 's what 's important !, 
  i know i 'm not the only one checking it out :, 
  the argument in the comments that he is rich and does n't need the money is really childish . 
  as much as i do n't like the current system , it does n't matter if he 's rich or poor - money is paid on a different basis . 
   this video is not available in your country . 
  i agree , he should be shot . 
  thanks , i edited that . 
  english is not my first language but something did look weird about `` payed '' . 
  people think that because the death rate in iraq is falling , the situation is getting better . 
  the chart says the truth better . 
  edit : what of the above is wrong ? 
  why the downvotes ?

   sweet movie . 
  you 're talking about the ending , right ? 
  i hate movies made for teenagers ... well , most of them anyway . 
  the breakfast club is ok , ferris bueller 's day off is n't bad , but the newer ones like the infinite clones of scary movie suck . 
  either i wrote something wrong or you did n't understand me correctly - i like breakfast club and ferris bueller 's day off , but comparing them to todays movies for the same demographics seems unfair . 
  teenager movies today suck . 
  it may not be trash like most of the movies named , but it is bad .

  many people view reddit from their cell phones , so some kind of a warning for a huge and bandwidth intese image would be nice . 
  i 'm not blaming op , but the reddit team , for not implementing any features in the mobile version of the site . 
  2,2 mb and 3.500 x 2.334 pixels ... that 's large even for pc standards . 
  actually , people can be active on more web sites in the same time , so many people use 4chan and reddit in the same time , like i am . 
  shocking , i know . 
  hey , check out this link !,

  one guardian author , erwin james was in prison and today writes a lot on prisons , prisoners and penal systems aroud the world .

  yes . 
  i know it 's childish and stupid , but i hated when borat and ali g became very famous ( talking about the movies and the show , i know it 's one person ) .
