  a year can do a lot for perspective . 
  with that kind of weath it 's ** if ** he dies . 
   only us nerds ever thought it was a giant terrible evil . 
  and those old nerds , the us government and the eu commision . 
   before this contribution , apple was actually the largest contributor to the global fund to fight aids . 
  source on this ? 
  what i found is that apple gave 170 million to the fund which has 21 billion in funding . 
  in fact , the wikipedia page of the fund states that the bill and melinda gates foundation gave the most , and that product red was criticised for unusually costly marketing campaigns . 
  maybe it would be better to use compile on on [ wikitravel ] ( http://wikitravel.org/en/main_page ) which is a go-to page for me . 
  this reminds me of [ richard stallmans ] ( https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/pipermail/developers-public/2011-october/007647.html ) travel requirements . 
  basically anything from nouvelle vague and richard cheese . 
  mellow and slow . 
  jcs is loosely based on the bible and the church does n't really approve of it . 
  it has christian themes but is n't about evangelism , like a shitload of song from cave , cohen or dylan . 
  just themes . 
  that 's nice and i wish i could do the same thing . 
  except record stores where i live do n't sell most of the music i listen to and online mp3 stores do n't service my country . 
  piracy sometimes is the * only * choice i have , not just for convenience . 
  actually it 's audioscrobbler , the component that sends your music data to last.fm . 
   actually she does write all of her own music . 
  there are 9 songwriters on `` born to die '' except lana . 
  every song has at least two names by it . 
  i heard the same one about bill gates , back when he was evil . 
  four hours and this post is still standing . 
  god i want those shoes . 
   croatia : hit plovdiv, 
  plovdiv is in bulgaria . 
  did you mean pula ? 
  new world order tower . 
  it looks like the only cities marked are capital cities , with exceptions :, 
  - bonn, 
  - andorra la vella is there but other other microstates are n't noted, 
  - vantaa is a part of helsinki, 
  in some countries you have to retake the basic medicine tests for a drivers licence every couple of years . 
  old people often lose their licence over that . 
  on predstavlja da je to wikipedia napravila na zalasku sopa-e , \u0161to je sranje , kao i \u010dinjenica da je to jimmy wales diktatorski naredio ili da je wikipedia bila prva . 
  yup . 
  i often fantasize about being born somewhere else and spending the time on nirvana , pixies and pearl jam , not air raid shelters and the worst tv you can imagine . 
  my worst experience was a serb [ cluster bombing ] ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/zagreb_rocket_attacks ) on my city . 
  my mom was on her way from work and not far from the tram that got hit . 
  since the bomblets were scattered across the city i was n't allowed to go out for days . 
  to this day i despise shelters , sirens and the smell of candles . 
  because we had bad experiences with mainstream pop of the britney spears and backstreet boys kind . 
  let 's be clear , some share more burden than others . 
  he ran out of porn . 
  guy ritchie does this right . 
  golden brown in [ snatch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag_htoyi_uc ) and rocky road to dublin in [ sherlock holmes ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgcmfprpjoa&amp;feature=related ) , both during fight scenes . 
   tl ; dr : for those of us whose mommies and daddies ca n't pay for college, 
  because `` mommy and daddy '' can pay for college , or the military can . 
  no other way there , right ? 
  i would rather be flipping burgers at home , not having to decide about life and death . 
  you do what you are ordered , and you can be put in a situation to kill , right ? 
  if i walk in the nearest recruiting station the guy can guarantee me that i will never have to kill anybody ? 
  i do n't have to sign my life away to have an education in my country . 
  or money and manpower invested . 
  reddit : two weeks behind my local tv station . 
  dae remember laughter ? 
  as always , adam curtis has a good [ article on the subject ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2011/03/goodies_and_baddies.html ) , this time about pr in the biafran conflict . 
  which parts of southern europe ? 
  the balkans are regarded as safer than most of western europe . 
   which would be lovely if you ever knew where the bloody things were in the first place . 
  their wikipedia page does n't mention any deployment in the falklands , if you were implying that . 
  it would be very dirty , since the us needs argentina ( and brazil ) and still supports the monroe doctrine . 
  they were hesitant in 1982 and i woulnd ' t be surprised if they would be again today . 
  gypsies mostly keep to themselves and the only trouble they cause is some pickpocketing and petty crime . 
  still , there 's not a part of my city i would n't walk at night . 
  fill that gap with homeland . 
  i liked rubicon but it was just too slow to love . 
  anyone remembers [ traveler ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/traveler_\\ ( tv_series \\ ) ) ? 
  this is a talented young man . 
  still better than limp bizkit . 
  see any neighbouring country on reddit , instant upvote . 
  around 10 centimeters of snow fell in split today . 
  schools are closed , most people did n't go to work and stocked up on food and supplies . 
  what rhomboid said , but also cinematography and photography make a difference . 
  notice the ultra bright csi miami and the dark csi las vegas . 
  i always saw crank as gta : the movie . 
  even wrote an essay on the subject . 
  edit : minus three ? 
  did i say something wrong ? 
  spawn . 
  awesome soundtrack . 
  i did n't recognise spielberg 's photo . 
  i went to one of the worst high schools in the worst part of town where you had three different schools in one big building . 
  no cops , and the worst crime was periodical weed smoking behind the school . 
  woody ? 
  just today i was pondering why they invested so much energy into destroying pirate bay since there are hundreds of torrent sites around . 
  i just felt lucky that my beloved btjunkie had a lower profile and that they wo n't shut it down that soon or easy . 
  a sad day . 
  shutting down kazaa was n't a loss if you ask me . 
  damned awful piece of software . 
  i almost did n't notice the zero . 
  i loved winmx . 
  did anyone even suggest that ? 
  was iran attacking the us ( in retaliation or whatever ) even an option ? 
  the only thing i heard about that was iranian ships off the east coast but they do n't have the capacity for that . 
  that 's a regular reddit pastime . 
  dissing the us foreign policy on / r/worldpolitics . 
  so brave . 
  also , you are going with the wrong assumption that throwing bombs or interfering except in germany and japan ca n't possibly be justified .
