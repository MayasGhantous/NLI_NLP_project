  edit : excuse my ignorance reddit , i had no idea about the gideons , never saw a bible in a hotel room here in europe .

  \u017divili , 
  anti-competition or something like that . 
  7 second-tier browsers and ie , safari , opera , chrome and firefox in random order . 
  crap , i did n't notice it was in croatian , sorry . 
  i volunteered for zagreb film festival a couple of years ago and had some time off so i randomly walked into a projection that was packed full , to see what was going on . 
  people sat on the floor and additional chairs needed to be brought in . 
  it was eagle vs shark and i loved it so much that i went to see the additional projection they had to put up because of such interest from the audience . 
  just ... thanks . 
  i was expecting [ this one ] ( http://madetm.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/nickcave-1.jpg ) . 
  it helps that the movie looks like a documentary at some times . 
  it 's missing ** the ** party movie . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_party_ ( film ), 
  there are dozens of them , dozens !, 
  on the beer sharts or classes ? 
  my city of around a million people is virtually empty in august . 
  i biked from one side to the other and saw nobody . 
  saw you on terraneo last year in croatia . 
  your show was voted as one of the best . 
  it is filling the void left by r/jailbait . 
  edit : do bronies have a downvoting brigade or am i just unfunny ? 
  i clearly touched the bee hive here . 
  my next step is cracking their pony code , which is clearly just demented slang for child pornography . 
  the rabbit hole goes deep my friends . 
  impressive is n't the same as technologically advanced . 
  such flamebait . 
  on point 5 . 
  europe is not a country . 
  germany = us , europe = north america and the nearest thing to the eu you guys have would be nafta . 
  some resources were peacefully divided . 
  gold reserves , debt , embassies were distributed by using pre-war populations and gdp , while we still have problems over company real estate and internal bank debt . 
  so this is the second band i know of to name themselves by a h\u00fcsker d\u00fc song , after pink turns blue . 
  any more ? 
  i use the `` incoming ! '', 
  sound for text messages on every phone i had . 
   they have a space programme whereby they can send communications satalites , yet ca n't remove their own waste !, 
  gil scott-heron made a song about a similar problem he saw in the us . 
  can somebody tell me if it will work on my xbox 360 ? 
  i use the normal media sharing , not tversity . 
  not sure if serious or just did n't hear about hollywood yet . 
  the last one is a combo breaker . 
  great questions , but this is an ama , not an interview . 
  you have better chances of getting one or two answered than any of them this way . 
  craig finn of the hold steady . 
  i wrote a whole fucking essay but then my browser crashed , so this is the tl ; dr version . 
  he just put out a solo album , but his best work would be boys and girls in america which goes halfway between him singing and talking and is also my favorite album * of all time * . 
  all of his works include the same characters although it is loose enough not to get lost and not to become too `` concepty . '', 
  the man loves christian imagery ( the non-evangelist kind ) , american literature , twin cities and ofter references other music . 
  since he grew up near the twin cities there are some h\u00fcsker d\u00fc and replacements references , but his main ( musical ) influence would surely be bruce springsteen . 
  it 's drunken night one song , depression the other . 
  as if his words really come from the minds of all the lost kids he sings about .

  just listen to boys and girls in america three times and thank me later . 
   oh , my mistake . 
  i thought this was a place where you could ask questions, 
  sure , but if you read almost any ama you would see what the protocol is and that most people wo n't answer such long winded questions . 
  this is sad , but understandable since tim probably does n't have the time to answer all of what pebefri asked . 
  if he did that would be awesome . 
   not just post meaningless bullshit and waste everyone 's time . 
  i applaud your communication skills . 
  it is sad , but i 'm sure tim does n't have that much time to answer every question the guy had , although they are excellent . 
  ama 's are usually informal and short , and i would n't bring this many question to a real interview , much less an ama . 
  he is hella prolific with 35 albums and about two dozen ep 's . 
  for anyone looking where to start , i would recommend the predictable bee thousand . 
   and there 's nothing wrong with using the word `` bullshit '', 
  not that , but calling a lot of other legitimate questions bullshit . 
   you are correct , but the tone suggested that it 's better to ask meaningless questions than real ones . 
  i did n't mean that , i was just commenting on the size . 
  i 'm a journalist and it would be rude to ask that much during an interview , not to mention an ama . 
  again , they are excellent questions and i hope tim answers them . 
   let 's be friends . 
  let 's . 
  even in this case it would take a lot of time . 
  again , i 'm all for answering it , but op should have sent an e-mail . 
   example : i am subscribed to / r/guns . 
  ot : i last visited / r/guns a long time ago , but now it looks like / r/gunporn . 
  mike skinner ( the streets ) has a similar style on a lot of his songs . 
  i 'm on a hold steady binge now , so two songs that heavily reference other songs . 
  they have a lot of these . 
  in [ joke about jamaica ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq2jnpqrdd4 ) i count 11 other songs . 
  [ we can get together ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trpfyw6uu7e ) has a whole verse about h\u00fcsker d\u00fc . 
  do n't link to the discussion , you are inviting a downvoting squad . 
  fuck you and your pretty women sweden !, 
  who who, 
  who who, 
  and you owe general washington 100 redcoat scalps !, 
  they 're real , not boltons . 
  netanyahu recently [ declined ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/03/02/america_s_israel_obsession ) to write an op-ed for the ny times because of their anti-israel positions . 
   in his rejection letter , netanyahu 's senior advisor , ron dermer , claimed to have counted up times ( and international herald tribune ) articles and concluded that of the 20 articles related to israel published between september and november 2011 , 19 portrayed israel in a negative light . 
  it would seem , he wrote , `` as if the surest way to get an op-ed published in the new york times these days , no matter how obscure the writer or the viewpoint , is to attack israel . '',
