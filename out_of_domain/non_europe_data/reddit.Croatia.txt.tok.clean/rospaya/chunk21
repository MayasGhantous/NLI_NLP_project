  is it my imagination or is james may the only person in top gear who knows something about cars ? 
  hammond and clarkson are tv personalities first and car people second , while may has less skill for the cameras and more for the cars . 
  the three of them are a perfect match for a show like this and although i do n't like clarkson as the arrogant know-it-all , all of them have their qualities . 
  [ not if you ask the firefox crowd ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/97vx9/this_is_why_i_love_reddit/c0brv4m?context=3 ), 
  i did n't watch them , only top gear . 
  but i suspect they 're ok , may seems like a good guy . 
  it would , flash requirements are higher every year . 
  he 's right , opera mini and the nokia browser are a good combination even if it is redundant . 
  opera mobile is not yet available for s60 . 
  the version you are linking to was released in [ 2005 ] ( http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1g1-133985369.html ) . 
  the [ latest ] ( http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2009/06/08/ ) release is 9.7 and the s60 version of it is [ in the works ] ( http://my.opera.com/haavard/blog/2009/04/04/opera-mobile-s60 ), 
  i made a massive review of mobile browsers a month ago so i know my homework . 
  there goes the macbook pro ... cue [ music ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rloidlfbi4w ), 
  do you feel more loyal to the commander in chief or your executive officer ? 
  how about state or country ? 
  in a strange sequence of events , if alaska were to seperate from the us , where would your allegence be ? 
  if the government turns tyranic ( state or federal , it does n't matter ) , how would you know that and would you execute your orders even if it is morally wrong ? 
  germany and japan are just countries like that . 
  they were industrial leaders before the war and they are today . 
  bomb the shit out of them and they will be on the top of the world in 40 years . 
  it 's just the mentality . 
  west germany got a money injection from the us and the east was just rebuilt , and after that just left back by the soviets . 
  one had great conditions to develop and the other very bad . 
  simple as that . 
  for a submission everybody is downvoting this is pretty high on my front page . 
  liar !, 
  ( note : i 'm one of the bad ), 
  i 'm an it journalist for 3-ish years ( i 'm 20 now ) and i got into college ( journalism ... who would have guessed ? ) . 
  i had a fake country since i was 9 . 
  i was sued by [ some company ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_telekom ) when i was 13 . 
  i was expelled from high school and in one point everyone gave up on me . 
  ama, 
  promoting totalitarian regimes and something that would today be copyright infringement . 
  i made a gif with the logo of ht ( hrvatski telekom , croatian telecom , a company dt bought ) turning into a swastika , and photoshoped hitler mustaches on the ceo . 
  ht was a monopolist with enormous prices and substandard service with very questionable ethics ... more evil than microsoft in the 90s . 
  well i made a constitution , money , laws and other stuff . 
  unfortuneatly i ca n't find most of the stuff today , except coins . 
  i got ta say , it was advanced for my age , in real standards it would be very liberal , libertarian even . 
  i 'd give everything to find it . 
  thanks , i sync opera and export bookmarks regularly . 
  do you know that everything will be fast after categorizing or are you just guessing ? 
  i 'll do it anyway . 
  oh it was a very exciting time , organizing a boycott , gathering sim cards and contracts for burning , we got some media attention and when i was gathering names and making t-shirts a policeman knocked on my door . 
  needless to say the petition was stopped ( about 5k names ) , and i quit the whole thing . 
  today , ht is still a monopolist but now we have more choices and the prices are low . 
  it was a weird experience when i met the ceo a couple of months ago at a press conference , he did n't recognize me since i was 13 at the time , but it was still uncomfortable . 
  i like your username btw . 
  are you out of the closet ? 
  what do you study ? 
  i 'm from zagreb btw . 
  without knowing anything about him advice like `` do n't buy a car '' does n't have to be true . 
  buyin a car for `` hurr look at me i have a car '' reasons is dumb , but what if he lives in the middle of nowhere ? 
  what if he really needs a car to drive a sick relative or something ? 
  what if it would be a good investment , like a pickup truck for driving stuff around ? 
  i agree with the general sentiment and i hate cars and driving , but such an advice seems lame without knowing more of op 's story . 
  if only there 's a site that would , i do n't know , aggregate things like that . 
  somewhere everyone could send their favourite sites so other people could enjoy them too . 
  naw , it wouldn ' work since there is no possible method such a community could filter the good from the bad ones , on a up and down scale . 
  here is your uppercase h. 
  no need to be snarky about a simple spelling error , specially because many people on reddit speak english as a second language , like me . 
  i said there 's no need to be snarky . 
   multilingual dexterity, 
  woah there , big words !, 
  as i wrote somewhere on reddit before , it 's hard not to learn english with the amout of western ( read : us ) culture we absorb every day . 
  from movies and tv shows to computers and literature , knowing english is essential for any line of work . 
  i have cartoon network to thanks for my knowledge of english , and from there the internet took over , and there 's more than porn up there as i 've heard . 
  oh , and i googled snarky . 
  turns out it 's not a word i 'll use [ again ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=snarky ) . 
  i was just being an asshole , there are many great links on the page , many of them i could 've submitted myself . 
  so , in essence , both have the same legislation side ( laws ) , but in common law judges have more space for interpretation ? 
  i understand the difference between criminal and civil law , i 'm talking about the * other * civil law , something you called statutory law . 
  wikipedia says :, 
   examples of statutory law comprehend traditional civil law and modern civil code systems in contrast to common law . 
  the thing i 'm more interested in is the elementary differences in the process : the role of judge , jury and the legislation . 
  as i see it , both have the same legislation side , but in common law the judge has more room to interpret the law and settle it in the best interest of truth . 
  is this right ? 
  i did it , everything works great now . 
  thanks . 
   and i am also part owner of the museum of communism if you can believe that . 
  wow !, 
  i did n't have time to visit it when i was there , but my sister tells me it 's great . 
  what ? 
  did i make another spelling mistake ? 
  are you sure you need a smartphone ? 
  from what you 're saying everything you need is a 3g phone with tethering , so any cheap nokia will do . 
  edit : sorry , i forgot about the voice thing . 
  no it 's not , i never went to the sex museum in prague , 
   earned all about baader-meinhof, 
  fffffffuuuuuuuu, 
  i need them local . 
  you mean he 's * heading * the * top * * straight * . 
  yes , but i have around 10 000 posts with different usernames and e-mail addresses . 
  it 's possible , but not easy . 
  oh , absinthe made high school more memorable for me . 
  the parts between the memory holes were awesome . 
  it 's spelled alle zusammen , and it means `` all at once '' as master_pandelume said . 
  i heard [ you fucked up ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m28wejoiyrq ) on weeds once and i loved them ever since . 
  oh i ca n't wait to get dumped to scream `` yoouuu fuuucked uuuup !, 
  yoouuu bitch ! '', 
  under my girlfriends windows with a couple of beers in me .
