   they gained their independence from the soviet union in 1968 . 
  since i was born in yugoslavia i can pretty much guarantee that yugoslavia did n't gain independence from the soviet union in 1968 . 
  or ever . 
  i 'd take a bullet for you . 
  mistake forgiven . 
  sorry guy , but i prefered [ icommentinsong ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/icommentinsong ) more . 
  both graham and ted ? 
  holy shit . 
  i had to take a minute to process this , since i did the same thing years ago . 
  came home from school after an incident similar to this one . 
  blind with anger , i went into the garage and took a hammer . 
  if my mom did n't stop me when she saw me leaving the house , a couple of lives would n't be the same today . 
  not military porn in any way . 
  i 'm sorry for being insensitive , but this subreddit is n't made for pictures like this . 
  i understand that there are a lot of military ( and wannabe military ) people here , but i 'm for sticking to the subject . 
  you are doing the exact opposite thing , blaming racism without any facts . 
  i 'm often called a pussy because of the lenght i would go to raise the gypsy standard of living in my country , but stories you call `` anecdotal '' to me are everyday reality , not just my built in european racism , as many here including you call it . 
   europe is just weird in that their racists freak the fuck out whenever they get any significant minority group . 
  one post you 're holier than thou , and the other you just spew out shit . 
  op is a famous karmawhore , and [ does ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/militaryporn/comments/u0alu/nothing_is_impossible_ed_salan_iraq_war_disabled/ ) this [ sometimes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/militaryporn/comments/tv1tw/war_is_hell_the_photo_of_the_marlboro_man_in/ ) . 
  is he out of jail ? 
  then why did you mention un membership ? 
   iirc , artists get only ~ 10 % of the revenue from cd 's . 
  even less . 
  love grooveshark , but being from a small country this does n't mean much to me . 
  i checked a local ( croatian ) band and croatia was n't even among the popular countries . 
  is that because the local userbase is n't big enough ? 
  or is the data not scaled by the size of the local population ? 
  that 's it !, 
  holy crap thank you very much !, 
  now only to find it in english or on amazon . 
  edit : holy crap # 2 , i found it in croatian , printed in 1981 and for about 10 euros with postage . 
  damn , i was just listening to galvanize . 
  all of europe . 
  the only people who bought it were governments who saw interest in such a war . 
  italy , uk and spain supported the war , but had massive protests against it . 
  the one in rome was the biggest anti-war rally in history . 
  a few years ago i started compiling sources and started to work on a project that would end up as a book on operation gladio . 
  being lazy and not a professional historian , i gave up . 
  that being said , you are right . 
  a cool trick that got them burned some time ago when someone exploited that screenshots to get hidden data . 
  or something similar . 
  i 'm hungover and ca n't find the link right now . 
  is there a single beer that will be mentioned on reddit and then not pissed on ? 
  did you use it in combat ? 
  because i did n't hear about nato using anything but planes to destroy enemy armor . 
  bozarking is back boys . 
  it was one of the best ama 's in recent memory . 
  plugging is irrelevant if the answers are funny , cool and honest . 
  tipping is probably the most annoying topic on reddit that comes out once a week . 
  just do as locals do and that 's it . 
  i 'm sure there 's a better chance to hear about war crimes an ocean away , with press and coverage of an entire war , and not as a soldier in one part of the country , with censored news . 
   serbia needs a hardliner who is very anti-nato/eu . 
  i 'm sorry , did you try to say `` exactly what serbia and everyone in europe except russia do n't need ? '', 
  any data on tumblr ? 
  nobody in their right mind thinks reddit is or should be neutral . 
  everyone is running to the right . 
  nice try , tory subliminal advertising dept. 
  yeah , fucking nato , forcing the serbs to start yet another ethnic cleansing . 
   invasion ? 
  kosovo was part of serbia . 
  moving the military into a province is close enough . 
   most countries today still do n't recognize kosovo as a country . 
  a shitload do . 
   are you american btw ? 
  he does n't have to be . 
  your reasoning is that the bombing was n't justified because of that , and presume that ethnic cleansing would n't happen in the other case . 
  crimes happened before the bombing as well . 
  milosevic had a solid track record on war crimes .

  being one of the `` weaker guys '' as you call us , and involuntarily shitting my pants everytime i hear a siren because it reminds me of the air raid shelter i spent some time in , i call your comment bullshit . 
   when you respond to a peaceful demonstation with violence because you disagree with the content of their speech , the fascist in the room is you . 
  if the content of their speech is advocating violence against the other side , i would save my sympathy for some other group . 
   you 're a fucking dumb fuck . 
  i remember when comments like these were buried in a matter of minutes , without even bothering to check the ideology or grammar . 
   you ca n't have it both ways . 
  you cant say `` freedom for the people i like , and fuck those assholes '' . 
  sure i can . 
  a lot of european countries do . 
  freedom of speech has degrees and works differently in different countries and cultures . 
  we 've had enough of american political exports , your style of `` freedom '' is n't welcome . 
  to make myself clear : i live in the region . 
  i know first hand what happened and i do n't need your wise political thoughts to explain the situation to me , since i am one of the `` weaker guys '' and if the us did n't intervene i probably would n't be talking to you right now . 
  this is my favorite subreddit and if stiff moderation is needed to remain that way , i approve . 
  he did n't see much combat in wwi and except some rumors it is n't confirmed that he killed anyone . 
  despite tensions , the balkans are peaceful and stable . 
  cute . 
  but not military porn . 
   look at the countries that received marshal plan aid , then look at those that did n't . 
  this is just dishonest as hell . 
  you are forgetting that marshall plan countries had market economies , were part of the west and had considerable success even before the war . 
  the same nonsense i keep hearing about the us being responsible for german and japanese post-war miracle , forgetting the fact that both were industrial powerhouses long time before the war and occupation . 
  also , note portugal , greece and turkey , further throwing your point into the ground . 
  wow . 
  3/5 of my favorite albums . 
  the cost far far outweights the benefits . 
  i can always hassle a friend or just take a bus . 
  the minimal cost of getting a car would be about 1500 dollars without even buying the damn thing , that 's how much it costs in my country . 
  besides , i 'm two hours drive away from sandy beaches , five hours from snow and skiing and 40 minutes walking from a nice mountaing and woods .
