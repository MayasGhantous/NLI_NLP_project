  in croatia we still remember when we were leading the us in the finals in 1992 in the first quarter . 
  it was our first olympic medal as an independent nation . 
  more touring because the business model changed ? 
  i 'm not into basketball enough to judge , but i doubt it . 
  yugoslavia was good , but the dream team is the dream team . 
  and yet it will be a good movie . 
  whole my life i thought they were a single event . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm very sad that reddit has become a place where calling anybody a retard is upvoted . 
  croatia is very religious , with almost 90 % ( 2001 census ) of the population declared christians . 
  yet we elected multiple atheist and agnostic pm 's and presidents . 
  no questions , just noticing that this is a pretty nice thread . 
  op has answered many questions , provided proof , the comments are polite and mostly topical and although `` israel '' is in the title , most comments about the conflict or nasty remarks have been civil or downvoted . 
  i like it . 
  front page post about croatia ? 
  quickly plug / r/croatia . 
  first time i saw it . 
   i guess because they strum on a guitar it makes them talented musicians ? 
  satire has nothing to do with this , quality does . 
   they make it so obvious they 're a comedy/satire group . 
  someone should inform their fans . 
  just because it is satire does n't make it good . 
  how about making it scientific ? 
  someone with some tech skills could make a bot that would scour the subreddit and make a list of most submitted songs or bands ? 
  rupe . 
  rupe everywhere . 
  you are counting on a mass of people to be responsible and well trained . 
  i would give my pet rock to an average citizen , not to mention a firearm . 
  can anyone confirm that hitler was rich ? 
  too bad the movie was n't in 3d . 
  then he 'd have to sell his guns just to come in . 
  are these the same questions for dave grohl 's ama ? 
  witchcraft, 
  and developed by two estonians . 
  so more laws ca n't do any good ? 
  how 's bank regulation working for you ? 
  because news work for profits and death sells . 
  you want unrestrained capitalism , you 've got it . 
  any attempt to change that would be called censorship .

  this is just by spending 5 minutes on wikipedia . 
  and i used only 12 and more dead . 
  keep your badge , but do n't call gay rights politics . 
  rights come by default and should n't be negotiable . 
  this is n't about politics , it is about justice . 
  you guys have the highest homicide rate in the western world . 
  i 'd call that an issue . 
  stalin . 
  lenin died before the war . 
   by a black tent you mean ones that are bedazzled and hand-embroidered , and sometimes made from gucci and versace fabric ? 
  i 'm sorry for you . 
  i really am . 
   non-sexual, 
  i smell you-know-who . 
  i tried . 
  i really did . 
  the massive boner reddit has for this show made me think i would love , but i really do n't see the appeal . 
  if there 's one thing reddit hates more than nickelback or republicans , it 's fat people . 
  `` the bastards , when will they learn '', 
  buy the device unlocked and use whatever plan you want . 
  the whole `` but russia won the war ! '', 
  is a boring trope used by people who would die before giving some credit to the west . 
  sure if hollywood movies are your history textbook you will get shitty information , if you had a decent education you knew that stalin ( of all people ) said it best :, 
  british brains , russian blood and american brawn . 
  yeah , fuck different opinions !, 
  your opinion is clearly better, 
  but you did . 
  assumed that we all did n't see a gun in our lives and assumed we 're ignorant , based on exatly zero fact . 
  i made that thread and i stand by every word i wrote there . 
   my biggest problem with them is that 98 % of them have never even picked up a damn gun , let alone fired one , let alone owned one , let alone carried one, 
  so what ? 
  i could say the same thing about you , because you held or own a gun , that you are biased and of course you wo n't say anything that 's not in your interest , right ? 
  on the other hand , i made that thread because i was confused by people vigorously defending guns and yet failing to recognize that they live in a country with a higher rate of homicides than any other civilized country . 
  maybe that 's where we get the `` advanced and civilized '' part . 
  i have zero interest in it . 
  my country has 1.1 homicides per 100k people , texas ( apologies for stalking ... ) has 5.4 . 
   and they will not listen to any contradicting opinions, 
  exatly what you are doing right now ? 
  i love them because there is n't a better place to hit rock bottom , but they 're getting more rare and are getting replaced by sterile lounge bars . 
  the ones that are still in business are mostly in working class neighbourhoods or near factories . 
  kapitalizam . 
  not really . 
  they have a high profile , but not a big population . 
  userem se u ga\u0107e kad god vidim da se snima neki film o balkanu . 
  you had me at `` nick cave '', 
  america did make the slc olympics a 11/9 fest . 
  a lot of countries got really screwed . 
  baltic countries , belarus , yugoslavia , china ...
