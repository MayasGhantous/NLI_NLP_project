  depending on what metric we use , we 'll get a depressing list of countries that still have n't fully recovered . 
  dude . 
  i wan na go swimming . 
  we 're fucked and that 's all there is . 
  it 's a huge hassle to get all the rights for all countries , and when you figure in our smartphone adoption rates , purchasing power and the fact that there are about 4,5 million of us around , most companies just do n't care . 
  it 's not just play , it 's every cool online service i can think of . 
  my kindle works great in croatia , i have zero regional problems with buying from the kindle store and amazon is happy to take my money . 
  when google , microsoft , netflix and others ( amazon included ) are ready , i 'll pay them . 
  until then it 's free apps and piracy for me . 
   a man is congratulated and cheered on by his buddies for hooking up with a lot of women . 
  the women are called sluts . 
  because it is expected that women are courted by men , not the other way around . 
  it goes both ways on this subject , and the person that gets high-fives is the person that showed initiative , guts , talent and good looks in wooing the opposite sex . 
  maybe it 's a culture thing , but in practice i rarely if ever see women coming up to men . 
  it 's men that have to do their best . 
  korea is currently a draw ( but i would n't call it yet ) and afghanistan depends on how you look at it . 
  wars are n't typical wars anymore . 
  oh and both featured a lot of non-us troops . 
  i would love an alternative . 
  people always recommend 10 subreddits , but is there a single one that would replace this one ? 
  just the thing i wanted to post . 
  can anyone expand on this with essays or books ? 
  [ in iraq , life expectancy is 67 . 
  minutes from glasgow city centre , it 's 54 ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2006/jan/21/health.politics ), 
  so what ? 
  [ 2/3 goes to northern america and europe ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/industry-se.htm ) and they do n't sell to countries that are in a conflict . 
  most of the exports are fighter jets ( gripen ) , radar systems and infantry fighting vehicles ( cv90 ) . 
  also sweden supports the un arms control treaty that us , china , russia , india and indonesia blocked today . 
  i really do n't see the problem with arms sales if they are mostly high-tech and to peaceful countries . 
  the tone you used with `` swedish utopia '' is condescending and out of place on this subreddit . 
  did you make that number up or is it a fact ? 
   there are nation states but that make up a very small minority of states . 
  [ are you sure about that ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_state#the_nation_state_in_practice ), 
  impressive . 
  facebook has more than 800 million users and rising . 
  if you do n't see the financial potential in that i 'm not sure who the assclown is here . 
  except this is the second biggest event ( website ) and the biggest house party in the world . 
  although not a lot of people gave money , a billion dollars is still a shitload . 
  while the ipo was disappointing , the company is still worth a lot of money and even though i think there 's a bubble coming and that the ipo showed that , facebook is massive and will remain that way for the near future . 
  the hate people here have for facebook is really interesting . 
   they have no standing army , just a very real militia . 
  um , yes they do . 
  like a lot of countries , switzerland uses conscription to train the population , but they let them keep their weapons . 
  [ under the country 's militia system , professional soldiers constitute about 5 percent of military personnel ; the rest are male citizen conscripts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_army ) . 
  the evil smile in the last frame reminds me of grinch . 
  indefinite hiatus people . 
  it 's the [ holy crown of hungary ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holy_crown_of_hungary ) or the crown of st. stephen . 
  such bullshit , the tracking and device had nothing to do with reddit comments and this guy is not only speculating but openly lying . 
  luxembourg is firmly a part of western europe , not central . 
  the whole rick james bit was extremely popular online when it happened . 
  huh . 
  i have the same air-rifle . 
  might have something to do with the [ odd status of confession in japan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminal_justice_system_of_japan#confession_in_japanese_criminal_investigation ) . 
  yeah , when you count the whole country . 
  you do n't make a subway line that crosses the whole country , you make local ones . 
  [ if you look at it on a local basis ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/world_population_density_1994.png/1024px-world_population_density_1994.png ) your argument becomes invalid . 
  oh god ... hdr everywhere . 
  i 'm happy for you guys , but you all are acting like it 's a big deal . 
  the uk is one of the richest and most advanced countries in the world , very active in sports * and * the host this year . 
  this is kind of normal , right ? 
  you were never lower than 10th place in the last 12 years . 
  frank turner is just dreamy . 
   jameson is n't the first in the business to praise romney : ron jeremy recently called romney `` a good man '' and `` such an amazing father . '', 
  in an interview with yahoo news earlier this year , gay porn titan michael lucas said he would `` of course '' support the former massachusetts governor . 
  are these people being ironic or what ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  just speculation on my part , but croatia wo n't meet the criteria to adopt the euro for quite some time so no need to worry about that . 
  croatian border guards do n't carry submachine guns . 
  i traveled far and wide across and i have n't even seen one except on parades . 
  that 's about right . 
  the main point is that pavelic was allied with local muslims and they were integrated in government affairs , their holidays became public and they got a mosque in the center of zagreb ( a museum that got minarets by pavelic ' order ) . 
  like always , this is a perpetual story of culture , nationalism and religion used to make people fight each other in the balkans . 
  i would n't register this as a religious motive to fight with hitler . 
  did it look something like [ this ] ( http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/strojnica_ero ) ? 
  or you know ... funny . 
  my favorite album overall , it would get first place in any deserted island list . 
  - fugazi - 13 songs . 
  a compilation , but still the part of fugazi i love the most . 
  - bad religion - how could hell be any worse ? 
  i would n't call this their best work , but it has the raw punk essence that their other albums do n't follow enough . 
  imho . 
  - nomeansno - wrong . 
  a tight race between wrong and dance of the headless bourgeoisie . 
  - the offspring - americana . 
  smash would be my first choice , but nostalgia got the better of me . 
  spotify is available in 15 countries . 
   one of the features of boomers was that they tended to think of themselves as a special generation , very different from those that had come before them . 
  nope , not biased at all . 
  is n't this pure speculation/wartime propaganda ? 
  for one thing , hitler did n't have enough boats to properly invade the uk , not to mention stage a huge attack over the atlantic . 
  that would be a good question for / r/askhistorians : did the nazis ever plan to invade the us ? 
  red leader standing by . 
  to be fair , a lot of people do n't realise that 's racist . 
  it sounds like a shorthand for `` japanese '' and without historical context could be mistanken for simple slang . 
  historical context . 
  i live in croatia and i have never been to plitvice . 
  the irony is n't that the terminator became the governer of california . 
  it 's that he was one of the better people for the job . 
  any idea about yugoslavia ?
