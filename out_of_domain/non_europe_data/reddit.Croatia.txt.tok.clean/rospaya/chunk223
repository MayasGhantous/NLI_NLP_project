  i 've read that the soviets were considering yugoslavia as a possible staging ground for an allied invasion and were planning on crushing it , but feared massive resistance and guerilla fighting in case of a conventional war . 
  [ obligatory hot girl explaining bagged milk ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtpgd4huk4w ) . 
  ah yes , afghanistan and the continental us , two completely comparable populations . 
  gil scott heron made a [ very related song ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptby_ppg4hy ) back in the day when the us was sending people on the moon . 
  but they will use more medical attention and drugs , not to mention the higher probability smokers have of causing accidents and working less .

   clearly , the xx have all gotten older . 
  they 're 22 , 24 now . 
  i interviewed jamie and romy the other day . 
  without knowing their age , i would n't give them a day over 20 . 
  they both look frightened and introverted , scared and constantly depressed . 
  my whole time with them was awkward and i ended the whole thing a couple of minutes before my limit , something i have never done in any interview , no matter how boring . 
  let 's just say i feel the same about their music . 
  does anybody remember [ this awesome game ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ugh !, 
  i had no idea she was disabled . 
   were you surprised when you saw that iran was n't all a big desert ? 
  are people this ignorant by default ? 
   but most iranians consider themselves persian - not arab !, 
  [ two percent ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran#demographics ) consider themselves arabs . 
  people have some dumb ideas about countries without know shit about them . 
  the supposedly intellectual and wordly population of reddit was shocked when they saw pictures of iran that showed more than a barren wasteland where they execute nonbelievers on every corner . 
  if that is the situation on reddit , i shudder to think what other people think they know . 
  edit : nothing against you , just wondering about people . 
  there was a period when sony was getting hacked every week . 
  it 's a matter of typing `` iran '' into google . 
  i 'm a geography/history geek , so maybe that 's why i 'm so shocked , but i come from a country that last saw world headlines when we had a war 20 years ago , and that dumb image follows me wherever i travel and say where i 'm from . 
  [ kandahar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kandahar ) is in afghanistan , not iran . 
   why does his valid question/statement make you attack him, 
  i have n't attacked him , just the prevailing sense that iran is a huge desert . 
  read it again . 
   are you iranian ? 
  not even close . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/counties_of_croatia.svg/500px-counties_of_croatia.svg.png ), 
  i have been fooled one time too many . 
  i like you op , you 're a cool guy . 
   fine , not attacked but `` condescended '', 
  i condescended all the people that hold such simplistic and dumb views . 
  op was n't one of them . 
   and if you are n't close to iranian what are you , easter islander ? 
  clever . 
  your first paragraph counts only on reddit , where the anti-israel crowd will suppress dissenting opinions . 
  in the real world , especially the us , the `` antisemitic '' card is being heavily used to counter opinions against israel in the name of political correctness . 
  hereza if you ask me . 
  vienna is awesome . 
  they got two years for a hate crime , is that a fair punishment for a dance in a church ? 
  what is it with this thread ? 
  does / r/music hate the black keys overnight ? 
  this must be a reddit rule of some sort : there is n't a single beer in the world you can mention or be photographed with without the beer being called `` piss '' or `` crap '' . 
  i see a hundred concerts a year , from tiny holes to stadiums . 
  i have seen this only once - a u2 concert , the only one in a two country radius when they sold out 30k people two days in a row . 
  people who do this do n't see concerts very often . 
  peter jackson too . 
  govoris kao da index.hr ima ikakve standarde . 
  ovo je business as usual za njih . 
  the safest move would be not to play ( or say ) anything . 
  i 'm all for cultural sanctions , that is the civil way of telling whole nations `` hey , something is rotten '' and i felt the same way when pixies boycotted israel . 
  that 's the whole point , is n't it ? 
  the whole western world is criticizing human rights in russia , the least a big band can do is say `` count us out until you quit that . '', 
  nope , i 'm serious . 
  people snap a couple of photos ( even i do , since it 's part of my job ) but only a single time i saw a lot of people recording whole songs . 
  when i was younger i recorded a few short clips myself , but nothing close to the rant op wrote . 
  i 'm a journalist so i go where i 'm needed , but usually i just take a list of announced bands and check them out on youtube . 
  far from that , but i would guess we have a stable concert audience that is more alternative , not jason mraz . 
  superstition .

  yup most of the problems people posted here are correct . 
  but you have to remember that xda-devs is an old forum , a place that has its roots in a different os and with a very wide base of people all over the world . 
  i registered over 6 years ago and was treated as a noob , in the meantime android came along and the forum grew 20 fold in members . 
  remember that they got a shitload of people in a small period of time , and that they come from geeky backgrounds of all ages and languages . 
  i paused for a second and read it again `` alan rickman , i know who that guy is , but who is this ? '', 
  and then i realised i have n't seen him in ages . 
  he 's old . 
  he did n't do what he wanted to , he did things to shock people , and that 's what drew him to his end . 
  the article says so as well , and it does n't look like any of the commenters corrected him . 
  even if the less effective government means a worse life for you ? 
  i have a radical idea : i 'm against any innocent deaths . 
  i gave enough blood protesting an unfair war , but i am equally against one man deciding what the world needs to see or not . 
  dude . 
  said was awesome . 
  indians waiting in line to be submerged in crap or because of a queue ? 
  exactly the three things with which i would explain charlie brooker . 
  redditors ofter defend their gun rights by saying that they are needed for overthrowing a tyrannical and opressive government , if and when that happens . 
  why do people think that if and when a tyrannical government appears the situation will be so one sided , a re-hash of the revolution in the 18th century ? 
  what makes you think that viginia republicans ( or michigan militias or anybody else ) has less of a right to overthrow an opressive government ? 
  who will be the judge of that ? 
  we were n't that much into communism the whole time so it was n't needed . 
  do n't get me wrong , yugoslavia was mostly communist , but not enough to have the hammer and sicle , although there were organizations in the country that used that imagery . 
  in our context the red star is more about [ yugoslav partisans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans ) than communism itself . 
  i 'm talking about a hypothetical situation . 
  at what point does treason end up as resistance ? 
  `` british brains , american brawn , and russian blood '' is what stalin said . 
  correct or not , i love this quote . 
  like the rest of balkans , we could write the book on this one . 
  so many inventions and myths . 
  the telegraph is ok for us foreigners , but the locals often call it the torygraph , so keep alert . 
  i feel affection towards jesus christ , yes i do . 
  it depends on the store , i haggled at cheap stands in both croatia ( which is in europe ) and the uk , but try this in normal stores that sell absolutely anything except souvenires and you 'll end up with the same price . 
  for me it 's military * porn * , seeing a memorial does n't exite me , it depresses me . 
  i 'm sorry for their loss , but most people are here to see some awesome hardware , and proper rules should be established .
