  it 's just indicative of the problem - they do n't hate blacks as much as they find a great way to piss of rose . 
   the ethnic shit from the balkan war , and everything else we see in russia regarding black players and of course there is chechnya ? 
  the balkan wars happened and most of the blame comes from nationalism , the same one responsible for booing on that stadium . 
  my country fought for independence and i ca n't and wo n't defend any wars . 
  chechnya is a mountainous area that has been subjugated for centuries and became a hotbed of islamic terrorism and heavy handed russian generals . 
  do n't see anything cultural about that . 
   as you mentioned , the nationalism is the main problem and not cultural . 
  i apologize . 
  exactly , and there is no need for an apology , i see you did n't mean it that way . 
  how about a gyroscope that would disable the other side when it is on the bottom ? 
  that would be a nice solution . 
  was there ever a disaster on the same scale ? 
  post this a bit earlier next time, 
   my friend 's father was a sniper in macedonia-greek conflict in the early 90s . 
  there was no macedonia-greek conflict for the last couple of thousand years . 
  [ so does the uk ] ( http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/ ) . 
   while that 's not entirely true ( balkan wars, 
  of course , slipped my mind . 
   but i do know for sure that he was a sniper in military from the early 80s until macedonia declared independence from yugoslavia in the early 90s, 
  macedonia was the only yugoslav state to get their independence in peace . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_macedonia#declaration_of_independence ) : `` macedonia remained at peace through the yugoslav wars of the early 1990s . 
  a few very minor changes to its border with yugoslavia were agreed upon to resolve problems with the demarcation line between the two countries . '', 
  the only period he could have been in a conflict is the brief albanian insurgency in 2001 where less than a 100 people were killed on both sides . 
  funny to see this logo so far away from home . 
  the chef is [ the logo ] ( http://www.logotip.com.hr/files/thumb_357x250/tmp_20080120122404_0.jpg ) of a croatia condiment called ( yep ) [ vegeta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vegeta_\\ ( food \\ ) ) . 
  i heard he had sex with millions of peaches , peaches for free . 
   no-one has ever defeated a terrorist opponent by military force . 
  it ca n't be done . 
  the tamil tigers say hi . 
   and because of that , its really really big for its population . 
  not only that but old industry that uses up space and a big part of zagreb is built on a hill . 
  [ do you have a drinking problem ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl4plpgrg8o ), 
  source please , because the royal air force has over 200 strike/fighter airplanes and that 's after retiring around 70 harriers . 
  the uk also ordered more than a hundred f-35s . 
  specially because france sent two warships to haiti in 2010 , one of them a helicopter carrier that performed a similar mission . 
  it 's not like they had a choice . 
   remember , the us needs to be able to theoretically fight both russia and china , and potentially north korea , simultaneously . 
  wrong . 
  the us [ moved ] ( http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/01/06/why_we_need_to_move_beyond_the_two_war_doctrine ) from a two war doctrine that did n't include china and russia at the same time , but two theatres , and you can see how that went down in iraq and afghanistan , even with allies . 
   if russia decided to go crazy cold war style on europe tomorrow , who among the eu could do a thing about it without the united states . 
  550 nuclear warheads , five million personnel and two thousand fighter aircraft should do the trick . 
  as a tech journalist , this stuff disgusts me . 
  we get access to a lot of places , nice hotel rooms and expensive conference admissions . 
  usb sticks and laptop bags . 
  small gadgets and dinners , always under the guise of `` business expenses '' and now some fuckers want more and more , tanking the profession even more . 
  what kind of argument is that ? 
  substituting words in a sentence is n't a valid argument . 
   this is the same fallacy as `` i have never seen a homosexual who does not dress flamboyantly and does not talk with a lisp . '', 
  it 's as if europeans are making this problem up . 
  there are thousands of articles , scientific works and programs dealing with the issues we are talking about here . 
  i have no tolerance for hating any race or people so i 'm not happy to be on the same side with borderline fascists , but there is a social problem that needs to be dealt with . 
  my government spends a lot of money for free education and even free housing for gypsies and a huge amount of it has gone to waste . 
  it 's not a few isolated cases , but a spread and systematic issue . 
   you have probably met many romani before , and you 've never known because a ) they did n't tell you ( because of obvious reasons ) and b ) you assume that someone is romani only if they 're begging/pickpocketing/etc . 
  gypsies mostly have darker skin , so i would notice if i met one . 
  extremely wrong . 
  giving an argument . 
  the parent commenter thinks jews , black people and gypsies are the same , that their problems , the issues they face and prejudice all come from the same place . 
  it 's too complicated to be substituted for such a simple argument . 
  so a purse for her boobs ? 
  finally , the cog connecting the onion and the economist . 
  i touched the eurofighter typhoon . 
  enough for me . 
   what does ` gaming journalism ' have ? 
  this, 
  his inglourious basterd poster is proudly hanging in my room . 
  anyone tried it yet ? 
  how do they plan to do the free contraception thing ? 
  give away condoms at schools ? 
  i got ta see it . 
  it 's still the fourth most visited website globally . 
  disco ball . 
  just a minor thing ... 
  it 's blocked for some countries like canada , not the whole world . 
   you are a plebeian, 
  rarely see this outside of / mu / . 
  do n't know if you 're being sarcastic , but in european cinemas i 've been to any noise except laughing at a comedy is considered impolite . 
  but i 've got to admit , i broke some unwritten rule when i clapped at [ this scene ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc-domfcee8 ) . 
  i regret nothing . 
  of course every magnitude joke is the same because we only know one thing about him : `` pop pop ! '', 
  every week i expect to see magnitude in the title and the joke that would be about his geekiness , maybe a racial stereotype ( although community subverts those all the time so maybe not this subreddit 's style ) or something else . 
  i remain waiting for someone wittier than me . 
  about that one part : if they were in a jewelry store they would turn to the woman . 
  it may be sexism ( i really do n't know ) , but it may be just statistics and chances . 
  i have n't bought a car so i do n't know , but imagining the same situation in a hardware store i would bet on the guy being the buyer 9 out of 10 times . 
  then again , sexism is made out of assumptions . 
  the whole thing is confusing because i 'm not sure how to avoid my subconscience . 
  it 's a shame he does n't address that , because the comment is worth reading for other reasons . 
  nokia still spends more on r&d than apple . 
  i 'm following the show , but i find it very unrealistic in the sense that it is corny and hardly believable . 
  the characters are cliched as hell . 
  it 's a shame they broke up . 
  loved their concerts , and had the chance to see guy and tamar twice . 
  when was the last time the us did it without the uk ? 
  we had a ton of these already . 
  do n't feed the trolls . 
  hah , anyone reminded about that scene in oz ? 
  `` you and me , we 're gon na spoon '', 
   let us not forget he still barely won a hard fought primary .
