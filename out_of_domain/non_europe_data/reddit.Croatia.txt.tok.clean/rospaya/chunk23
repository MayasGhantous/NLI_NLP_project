  you 're english ? 
  naw , the english are welcome tourists in zagreb ... 
  but when in doubt use an irish or scottish accent , football wise , we like them better . 
  no offence . 
  sounds cool . 
  i 'd like to do something like that . 
  when the british were overtaking the us again ? 
  me too . 
  jesus when i do the beard and hair thing . 
  because of the mother / daughter dilemma ? 
  right ?!, 
  edit this until it 's too late !, 
  you have nothing to be ashamed of . 
  i was expelled from two schools and was generally a very bad student . 
  two months ago i finished high school and got into the college i wanted . 
  in the meantime i 'm working for the biggest it magazine in my country and scored first among hundreds of people in a test for the job . 
  school does n't say anything about you . 
  i really do n't see anything wrong with anything on your list . 
  fraiser rocks , you ca n't do anything about the blood thing and the boyfriend thing ... maybe you 're shy ? 
  ok , except the cher thing , being a woman does n't exonerate you . 
  i think we can reach an agreement . 
  europe = continent , not a country . 
  and roaming is the rate you pay for calls outside the country , that 's the thing americans complain about when they travel overseas . 
  and long distance ? 
  have n't heard about it in years . 
  jerry lee lewis ? 
  they deliver ** and ** love you completely . 
  i live in a country which in `` communism '' had full employment , full free healthcare and almost free housing . 
  croatia now , yugoslavia then . 
  it was a socialist country with some elements of market economy , so it 's not really fair to call it communist . 
  what do you think about immigrants to sweden ? 
  i just read about the 1968 incident with the soviet army . 
  know anything about it ? 
  that 's the thing with welfare countries , there should be a limit on sucking on the taxpayers boob . 
  it 's not itunes grade awful , but it is slow and unintuitive . 
  i have a dual core cpu with 3 gigs of ram , and it sobs around like i 'm forcing him to play all of the songs in the same time, 
  it 's true that i have 5x the songs you do , and at least 20 locations , but i 'm sure i 'm not the only one . 
  nope , it 's just slow as crap . 
  the other problem is forcing me to import music into it , which is highly annoying when i want to transfer one song . 
  first i put it in a monitored folder , then close zune and open it again , then check if it 's indexed already ... then the sync . 
  i already opened photoshop to make this and then saw your post ... an upvote well deserved . 
  the scene from cabaret , when the kid starts to [ sing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnmvmnmrqje ) . 
  a perfect analogy of germany at that time . 
  deadlines ( always have some ) and accidents . 
  having it, 
   `` if you want peace , prepare for war . '', 
  -- metallica, 
  actually , this is an old latin saying : si vis pacem , para bellum . 
  i have two , both of them solely for the covers , since i do n't own a gramophone . 
  the wall and jcs . 
  clocks was a great song , i still remember it fondly . 
  but chris martin turned out to be such an asshole in the meantime , and the song are getting more and more ... * pussier * ? 
  snorted chalk years ago when i was in elementary school . 
  i did it for free until a guy offered me money for it , and i said why not . 
  even yellow . 
  but after that ... naw . 
  he 's obviously not a positive historical figure , but he is the most famous german , by far . 
  [ plitvice lakes ] ( http://images.google.com/images?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=plitvice&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;sa=n&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi ) , or [ zlatni rat beach ] ( http://images.google.com/images?client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;q=zlatni%20rat&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;sa=n&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi ), 
  crap , forgot about that one . 
  my bad . 
  he was just born there . 
  i can stop whenever i want , it 's just chalk man ... what harm can it do , right ? 
  i expected davor suker , but ok . 
  how is it not forcing me to add directories if i have to import a song to transfer it ? 
   yes . 
  or merely add the song directly ( why you wish to behave this way is odd , it is counterproductive , counter intuitive and wasteful , but you can do it if you wish . . ) . 
  please explain to me how . 
  and please tell why what is more intuitive : put the song in a monitored folder , wait * ages * for zune to import it , find it in a huge list , add to sync . 
  or : drag n drop the song on the device . 
  why would that be counterproductive or wasteful ? 
   add the file to a monitored directory and it gets added to the collection . 
  which takes a lot of time . 
  i added a song the other day to a monitored folder and it took literaly 10 minutes until it was in my song list . 
  i reviewed this laptop , in essence it 's just a poor mans macbook air . 
  the build quality is fine , but the keyboard and touchpad suck . 
  i agree with you , pulp fiction is my favourite movie and nothing comes close . 
  i was 5 when the movie got out , but i can imagine the impact , even if i did n't see it by myself . 
   suffice to say , i believe it is a good thing we have a two party system . 
  traditionally , multi-party democracies are the hallmark of young and unstable democracies, 
  by that , single party systems would be the most stable , right ? 
  i really ca n't agree with that , you may be the expert here , but you are insinuating that the uk , germany and france have civil wars every four years ? 
  that they are young democracies ? 
  it 's one thing if the us had two big parties and a couple of smaller ones , but the electorate is almost completely polarized and it 's not a surprise that voter turnout is only 50-something percent , unlike 77 in germany , 83 in france , uk has 61 % and they consider it small . 
  you must rage a lot . 
  put [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vf3vzvbrxu ) on your phone . 
  show it to the kids next time . 
  threaten them with torso biting . 
  piss off , i do n't need help from anyone bro !, 
  the similar thing happened to me , but i got my stuff back very fast . 
  i dropped my wallet near the department of defense , and not 5 minutes later my dad calls me and tells me just to go back to the dod . 
  only when the mp at the front gate gave me my wallet i realized i lost it . 
  the problem is that the atheist mom presumed that she was talking to a peer , somebody who is as smart as she and has came here to brainwash her kid . 
  wrong . 
  the lady thought she was doing a good thing , while a little pushy , it 's a normal course of action for christians . 
  throwing your beliefs on others when asked when a neighbour just wanted to do something ( she thought was ) nice was n't needed . 
   our kids are 6 - i feel like they need to figure out for themselves what they believe and right now , they 're still taking in all the possible explanations . 
  this was enough . 
  someone need to put `` faggots '' at the end of the thread . 
  or a pun . 
  or something people !,
