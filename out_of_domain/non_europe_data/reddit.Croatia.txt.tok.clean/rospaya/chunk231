  i loved [ the longest day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_longest_day_\\ ( book \\ ) ) . 
  it looks really well researched and reads like a novel . 
  falco and the whole band are fucking awesome . 
  i had the greatest interview i 've ever had with them and they all were funny , smart and just generally great people . 
  it 's daft to compare lyrics in electronic music ( which is based on melody and repetition ) and rap which is based on words . 
  because it 's not a route bu a popular tourist destination . 
  he used a 10 mile radius . 
  that it 's just macho militarist crap ? 
  national anthem once a year in classrooms and that 's it . 
  she looks like a horse sized duck kinda person . 
  is yahtzee getting a bit hot headed or is it really that racist and just bad ? 
  in croatia 's case : bosnian croats are very conservative and religious , over 80 % of them voter for right and far right parties . 
  not to mention that the region has little to offer and is dependent on heavy subsidies from croatia . 
  not necessarily . 
  a lot of journalists , activists and rebels have connections to the outside via satellite phones . 
  it 's not going to become a black hole over night , although it will damage the ordinary citizen . 
  i opened a couple of links and when i got to this one i was seriously confused what the hell i 'm doing on myspace . 
   the european countries that abstained are all ex-soviet eastern bloc countries, 
  andorra , monaco , netherlands and san marino are nowhere near the eastern bloc . 
  albania , bosnia & herzegovina , croatia , montenegro , slovenia and macedonia were n't part of the `` soviet bloc '' . 
   many of the ex-soviet countries abstaining are especially beholden to us international interests due to our intervention in the balkan conflict . 
  you are making things too simple . 
  there are 14 eastern european on that list and they have their own foreign policies , national interests and will that is n't all about a single event . 
  i 'm a fan of old rts games where you had a big map and lots of units . 
  red alert/c & c , age of empires and rise of nations are still the games i play the most , right with world in conflict and coh . 
  we need good rts 's that are n't afraid of slower gameplay , economy , big maps and small units . 
  where there 's more to winning that clicking fast . 
  we had good and bad relations with both the east and west . 
  not many countries had both us and soviet military equipment , shot down us planes and then feared a soviet invasion . 
  placing yugoslavia anywhere else but the middle would n't be fair . 
  subreddits are ownerships of their mods and unless they break some serious rules there 's not much anyone can do . 
  czechoslovakia used to sell arms to israel when not many would , and after 1993 they started to build on that basis . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/06/23/why_the_irish_support_palestine ) an interesting article on irish support for palestine . 
  oh god i love them . 
  the game balances between fine tactics and massive attacks , but it 's a bit too much rock-paper-scissors between units . 
  i 'm sad that games like these are hard to find today . 
  come to any balkan country and order any local meat dish , you will me satisfied . 
  \u010cevapi ( chevapi ) is barbecued minced meat that comes with onions and soft and juicy warm bread . 
  creamy cheese is a must . 
  [ pic ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8njw1yzgsoi/trktxqegaci/aaaaaaaaeqw/5ortwzjw3g4/s640/cevapi.jpg ), 
  this is not a fugazi jacket . 
  names are regulated in a lot of countries . 
  iceland even has a tight list of names you can use . 
  `` croats , serbs '' makes as much sense as `` czechs , slovaks '', 
  personally , i do n't know anyone who * does n't * go on a vacation . 
  the vacation situation really is much different in europe than the us . 
  if i remember correctly , when i ate at this mcdonalds a full menu ( mccountry , coke , fries ) was a little less than 20 dollars . 
  also a lot of countries owe the uk and they would refuse to pay their own bills . 
  yes , and it is mountainous as well . 
  i 'm surprised to see croatia this low as well . 
  agriculture is 5 % of our gdp , fishing is big and food processing is one of our largest industries . 
  my guess would be cheap imports coupled with poor agricultural reform and addiction to government subsidies . 
  food is easier to import than grow and sell . 
  balkans . 
  sure we had a couple of bloody wars years ago but the region has one of the highest personal safety records in europe . 
  most of our cities are safer than paris , london or berlin . 
  there are less homicides per capita in my hometown of zagreb than rome , vienna , brussels , london , paris , oslo , dublin ... 
  i 'm looking at the 2009 figures and only 4 european capitals have less homicides per capita . 
  fincher is filming for hbo . 
  when casually listening to music on my phone i mostly use shuffle and just forget about it , but in almost all other situations i prefer albums . 
  a couple of reasons for that , but mostly because of the style . 
  artist can change and flop around , but when i like one of their phases chances are that whole albums are in the same vein . 
  weezer 's pinkerton is connected by a common theme , but when looked at from a distance , their main connection is a style , a snaphot of weezer from that time . 
  that 's the situation i can shuffle within an album . 
  but this does n't go for situations when song placement is important and in some cases mean very much , although that mostly goes for concept albums . 
  listening to days of future passed , zen arcade or tommy out of order makes no sense - there 's a whole story to be said . 
  do n't be fooled . 
  no country , whether the us , uk , france or zimbabwe will ever do anything that is n't in their interest . 
  that 's the reason countries use force . 
   is anyone else tired with the us being saddled with the bill ( both in terms of $ and soldiers lives ) for these things ? 
   why is it always us intervention ? 
  if there is a moral issue , why is it that almost always the us ends up footing the bill and doing the dirtywork ? 
  look closer . 
  the us is the only superpower left and they are at the front of any such initiative . 
  libya was an exception and look how it went there : british spent the most money and the french dropped the most bombs . 
  the main reason however is that uk , france and germany do n't have the firepower you think . 
  all of them are very capable of defending themselves and projecting * some * force , but staging a whole campaing thousands of miles from home is very exhausting and they just do n't have the logistics . 
  turkey is close and uk has a base on cyprus , but that 's not nearly enough . 
  you need carriers , airplanes , refueling , intelligence , drones , satellites , special forces , munition and fuel stockpiles and of course the will and national support to do it . 
  that 's the reason countries never go into things like this alone . 
  yep . 
   there is some stuff that is exempted from customs ( electronics , foto equipment and such ... ), 
  i got taxed a lot of times for electronics . 
  i always reap sick karma when somebody mentions milk in bags . 
  [ cute girl explaining milk in bags ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtpgd4huk4w ), 
  ( it 's a joke ), 
  i live 5 minutes from the stadium . 
  it was snowing but really not that much as the camera shows . 
  amen . 
  just [ saw ] ( http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/12/04/how_to_build_an_army_in_your_basement?page=full ) that the syrian army ( not rebels ) are using an-2 's to drop barrel bombs , not far from a boiler bomb huh ? 
  never heard about it before . 
  crazy . 
  insightful comment chewb . 
  i noticed the author , farhad manjoo , after [ this article ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/iphone_5_review_marveling_at_the_existence_of_the_greatest_phone_ever_made_.html ) that had some very rational and coldblooded statements :, 
   that 's because , in all other ways , the iphone 5 is the best phone ever to grace the earth . 
  it beats every single rival on just about every metric you can think of , including speed , battery life , and especially beauty and workmanship . 
   i 'll go even further : when i pick up the iphone 5 and examine it closely , i find it difficult to believe that this device actually exists . 
  the iphone 5 does not feel like a product that was mass produced . 
  in a strange way , it does n't feel like it was built at all . 
  this is a gadget that seems as if it fell into the box fully formed .
