  if you run your hands around its face , you scarcely feel any seams or other points of connection ; there 's little evidence that this thing is a highly complex device made from lots of smaller things . 
  instead it just feels like a single , solid , exquisitely crafted piece of machinery , and once you pick it up you never want to put it down . 
  edit : spelling . 
  something we should somehow institute is awarding people who put up sources or names . 
  it 's the same thing ** everytime ** somebody posts a pic without a name . 
  we should make it a policy to give a name instead of `` look at this beauty '' or `` nice bolts '' . 
  interesting that there 's data for serbia and montenegro pre-1991 and no data for other ex-yugoslav republics . 
   you do n't need tens of thousands of men to invade a country, 
  yes you absolutely do . 
  you are talking complete nonsense here , it is standard for every ocean to have a meu ready and having a us carrier group and such a unit near a crisis area is n't anything out of the ordinary . 
  a single meu is a powerful unit , but in no way , not even close for an invasion of syria . 
  even if your spearhead theory is correct , they would have to hold out for weeks before us troops arrived , not days . 
  mobilizing invasion units and bringing them into a fight is n't something that 's done fast . 
  you are seriously overestimating a single carrier group and underestimating syrian forces . 
  there are hundreds of military sites to be hit , and there are three meu 's dedicated to the region with only one being near . 
  you are trying to fight 300k men with 1-3k . 
  no matter how advanced and smart they are there is no way they could defeat an entire army . 
  with most fighting in the cities air cover does n't mean much to us forces on the ground since the syrians have a lot of anti air equipment , and a lot of it dangerous for us troops . 
   i do n't think you understand how military power and air superiority works . 
  i 'm afraid you do n't know anything about military power if you think a couple of thousand troops and an aircraft carrier can destroy a whole army in a week . 
  libya had less forces and stronger rebels and it took months of attacks from multiple countries to even allow rebels to advance . 
  syria 's army might be shit but they still have enough equipment to resist any invasion force that is n't completely overwhelming , and ( following the powell doctrine ) the us would n't send in such a force . 
   the size of the ** afghan ** forces are irrelevant ; they simply do n't compare at all to the expertise of the u.s. . 
  they do n't have the training , the gear , or the experience . 
  massed troops are just fodder for cluster bombs and mlrs , and if they maneuver and attack in smaller units they 'll be outmatched by better u.s. infantry . 
  and that 's why the us has a hundred thousand troops there and thousands have been killed for the 11th year ? 
  afghanistan is mostly a wasteland and the presumed opposing force does n't exceed 30k men and you are implying that 3000 people can wipe out 300k in a week ? 
  the brookings institute gives a minimum of 200 to 300 thousand troops just for the invasion . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/dotmil/2012/03/19/syria-invasion-could-cost-300-billion-per-year ), 
  us diplomat sources say 60k soldiers would be needed just to secure chemical instalations . 
  [ 2 ] ( http://www.policymic.com/articles/13356/syria-civil-war-what-the-us-invasion-of-syria-would-look-like ), 
  without a massive pile up of us forces in the region ( which you will read about in the papers ) there is no invasion happening . 
   you really do n't know a fucking thing about afghanistan at all , do you ? 
  with you implying this out of so little i can see where you get your military knowledge . 
  well the tootsies are an insult to the 6 million jews who died 50 years earlier . 
  is that how the game is played ? 
  more than 25 thousand people were killed in the bosnian genocide , srebrenica is just one part . 
  the un and icty classify it as a genocide not because they were adding up the bodies but because of the intention . 
  do you realize that it 's not so simple as flying people somewhere ? 
  us armed forces have various readiness levels with only a minor part of units ready to be sent at 72 hours notice . 
  look at [ the navy ] ( http://www.stripes.com/news/navy-facing-alarming-deficiencies-in-combat-readiness-lawmaker-says-1.149178 ) for instance . 
   more than a fifth of navy ships fell short of combat readiness in the past two years , and fewer than half of the service 's deployed combat aircraft are ready for their mission at any given time . 
  [ reports say ] ( http://www.defencetalk.com/strategic-review-must-address-low-military-readiness-levels-24147/ ) that the problem in wider than just the navy . 
  i 'm well aware of what you are saying , but i still do n't see what arguments you have that the bosnian war was n't a genocide . 
  mostly everyone except the serbs agrees that it was . 
  weeks or months . 
  it took a year of buildup and two months of fighting just to topple saddam and his impotent army . 
  i love those beasts as much as any other man but fighting a war is more complicated than putting a thousand people somewhere and hoping for the best . 
  minimum estimates by experts say that at least 60 thousand troops are needed just to secure chemical installations . 
  200-300k for a full scale invasion . 
  you guys are terribly overestimating what 3 thousand marines can do .

  any chance of a full list somewhere ?

  i heard zagreb in there if we build a new stadium . 
  the shithole that is / r/worldpolitics . 
  edit : originally i wrote / r/worldnews , i hate that place as well . 
   we do not need chemical regulation, 
  it 's funny how libertarians are at times indistinguishable from rigid conservatives . 
   before taking a tram to dolje followed by a cable-car up mount slijeme for the best views of the capital, 
  * before * the jfk assassination . 
   i doubt the person would survive long enough to reach trial, 
  why ? 
  i really see no reason for that , unless the person is killed resisting . 
  the assassin would have unprecedented security to prove the us is a nation of laws and due process . 
   the president 's party would be in firm control of the white house for at least 2 more terms, 
  again , why ? 
  after jfk was murdered lbj won one mandate after which republicans got two elections . 
  after 9/11 bush got one term and mccain/romney lost . 
  `` not worth a pitcher of warm piss '', 
  i was watching live election coverage back in 2008 and one ( older ) journalist accidentally said `` kennedy '' instead of `` obama '' . 
  my mom remembers than in yugoslavia , half a world away , people stood shocked in the streets , wondering what the hell happened . 
  she talks about it the same way people talk `` where were you on 9/11 '' . 
  no country ever does anything that is n't their interest . 
  and to think black men used to be sold , and not used to sell stuff . 
  both are equally good if you ask me . 
  and you * should * because i 'm a huge fan .

  yes you are right , this * will * sound creepy . 
  i 'll use space this just to note that us perception of freedom of speech is quite unique and even in more liberal countries is n't so broad . 
  looks a bit like [ andy falkous ] ( http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4292940984_2e06593361.jpg ) of mclusky and future of the left . 
  iirc it is on the former us embassy there . 
  which includes floors . 
  i just checked . 
  both nokia maps and google maps have nagasaki in the same place so i have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  nokia own navteq which makes all the maps so it is often more reliable than google .
