  you would pay but only if the model fits you . 
  he was a croat and bosnia was later part of his own country . 
  it 's really a half case . 
  interviewer : is your name saul berenson ? 
  saul : yes . 
  interviewer : `` are you sometimes called the bear ? '', 
  saul : fucking hope not . 
  yeah .

  are ... you ... serious ? 
  srebrenica is a well documented massacre , with 5657 bodies buried in a massive graveyard and the only people who deny it are serbian nationalists . 
  serbia even officially apologised for it in 2010 . 
  denying srebrenica goes in the same category as denying the holocaust and only a person of extreme ignorance can claim it is a hoax . 
  [ educate yourself ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre ) before you start trusting obscure conspiracy webpages . 
  no , but one side fired the first shot , one side fought in four different countries and one side is responsible for most of the war crimes and civilian casualties . 
  bosnia , slovenia , croatia and kosovo did n't bomb belgrade , but sarajevo , ljubljana , zagreb and pristina were shelled by serbs . 
  the truth is n't somewhere in the middle . 
  excuse me , which part of that is propaganda ? 
  because i walked on those graves and still see torn houses . 
  my own family was endangered even though we lived hundreds of miles from the border . 
  feel free to go to sarajevo , pristina or zagreb and ask the people what they think of the us involvement in the balkans . 
  unlike iraq or afghanistan it stopped a lot of killings and saved lives . 
  `` islamist and fascist '' do you have any idea what you are talking about ? 
  what part of the kla is islamist ? 
  or fascist ? 
  do you know what any of those mean ? 
  kosovo is a secular country and while the kla did their share of crimes , they are overshadowed by serbian crimes . 
  count the ones in bosnia and croatia . 
  48 thousand dead civilians on one side and 10 thousand on the other . 
   so that makes war crimes done by bosnia , slovenia , croatia or kosovo perfectly acceptable ? 
  not in the least . 
  i got beat up and called a traitor for speaking up about crimes in my own country . 
  every single crime counts and has to pay . 
   and anyone trying to justify the crimes committed against any particular ethnic group should be ashamed of themselves . 
  you say this and then in the other post you write :, 
  `` this is true , try to check the facts completely before calling something a conspiracy theory op , you fag . '', 
  and deny the largest massacre europe has seen after wwii . 
  are you calling that whole wikipedia link a lie on the basis of some conspiracy site ? 
  and they won the war which would make kosovo an islamic-fascist state , right ? 
  why is n't it then ? 
  why did they need nato , wahabis sworn enemy , to win ? 
  excuse me then . 
  sorry , i did n't pay enough attention to the rules . 
  i 'll delete this submission . 
  ima\u0161 neki link ? 
  too bad the whole crew got killed in a freak vulcano accident after season three , which stopped the show from wrecking itself and turning into shit . 
  deep . 
  the whole list is interesting , but is there a good reason why every black congressman is on it ? 
  in the end clinton had to step in . 
  i agree , but not about 88 or 89 , yugoslavia was still standing then . 
  the war started in 1991 and the first nato operations started in 1993 , and that was just denying flight . 
  airstrikes that helped end the war were in 1995 , after the biggest atrocities were over . 
  us is capable of doing the right thing once in a blue moon . 
  i think they killed that feature recently . 
   still , serbia has 45 % irreligious people . 
  from where the hell did you get that percentage ? 
  serbian census was published a couple of days ago there were 80.053 +4.010 atheists and agnostics . 
  if you count in people who put in `` unknown '' or did n't want to say that 's 99.714 +220.735 which ca n't be 45 % on serbia 's 7.1 million people . 
  as everywhere , but once every 10 years everyone has a chance to officially proclaim their religion . 
  if you miss it , you are religious in the eyes of the state . 
  you mean like spain that has some of the highest gay rights in the world and is 73 % christian ? 
  or portugal ( 81 % ) ? 
  i forgot to bookmark them , but searching new yorker , gq and even wired could give you some good answers . 
  there were a couple of great longform articles about the industry there . 
  what part is confusing you ? 
  it depends what company you 're in . 
  they can vary from rock ( azra , hladno pivo ) to regional songs . 
  there are n't any typical ones . 
  practically every tourist place has extra jobs during the summer , but most of them are found beforehand via job websites and such . 
  also i 'm not sure if you 'll need some kind of permit to work here after we get in the eu . 
  so he got trolled and was n't in on it ? 
  i miss his apartment . 
  i do n't know if it 's officially a desert , but there 's a small remnant of a desert in croatia . 
  it 's 0,07 square miles big . 
  i 'm not sure if i calculated it correctly . 
  20 ha which is 100 x 100 meters . 
  yeah i got it , but 0,07 miles sounds really small . 
  we have moderators and downvoting for that . 
  i 'm sick of seeing `` dead kittens/mangled dicks/exploded anus below ! '', 
  in bold letters consuming half the conversation . 
  by the time i see it ( 31 minutes currently ) it 's gone , but two dozen posts about it are still here . 
  downvote . 
  report . 
  move on . 
  nice fact . 
  goes to show how latitude does n't have much to do with weather . 
  as [ these cool maps show ] ( http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2011/03/north-america-western-europe-equivalent-latitude-maps.html ) , most large european cities are on or north from the us-canada border . 
   edit : by the ammount of downvotes , you can see cro_reddit is made mostly of alternatives, 
  or just people who have a hard time imagining drunk people singing some gibonni over a couple of beers . 
  baby steps . 
  not really . 
  i took cities on approximately the same latitude and looked at weather stats . 
  all figures in celsius in milimeters , some stats are year averages and some months .
