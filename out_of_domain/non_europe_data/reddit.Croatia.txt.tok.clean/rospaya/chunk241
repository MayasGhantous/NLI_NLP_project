  nolan is an extremely talented guy and it 's a shame he 's wasting his talent on franchises and hollywood blockbusters when he could be doing original work . 
  that 's why i 'm sad about him doing shallow superhero movies instead of original work . 
  i went to google street view and bradford looks pretty normal . 
  what 's the problem exactly ? 
  relevant in what way exactly ? 
  getting rid of the b. . . 
  i expected something racist but it 's just a lame joke , and a very tame lame joke at that . 
  if you pull out every race , religion and ethnic group out of every joke it would be a very bland world . 
  if you get upset by dick jokes than i 'm not sure reddit is the site for you . 
  i 'm from the balkans . 
  there is literally no positive stereotype tied to this region and every joke i hear is about the war ( ended 20 years ago ) , crime ( lower crime rates than most western european cities ) or communism ( yugoslavia was non-aligned ) . 
  and what can i do about it ? 
  call every stereotype racism ? 
  you take it and go on . 
  it 's not as if somebody said `` all chinks smell '' or something really racist . 
  it sounds on purpose though . 
   put simply , they lack awareness and foresight . 
  and because of them , everyone has to pay for it . 
  look at it from another perspective . 
  some people have no idea who the publisher or developer are and just want to play that city building game they loved 10 or 20 years ago . 
  they do n't have high standards and just want to exchange their 60 bucks for a game once a year . 
  it is n't democracy when you cheat , suspend courts , harass enemies and gerrymander . 
  just being on the ground does n't mean shit . 
  the cia has people everywhere and most of the time they gather intelligence , not play bond . 
  welcome german soldiers !, 
  i keep a copy of barbie girl on my phone for such purposes . 
  geraffes are dumb . 
  it 's a shame nobody mentioned kleinbl00 . 
  where were you guys then ? 
  after 9/11 americans gave a blank check to bush , he had universal approval and now everybody is saying how they knew bush would screw up all along . 
  also the band [ hanson brothers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giflclr4ric ) , featuring members of nomeansno . 
  they mostly sing about hockey . 
  ah inmusic . 
  ignore any list where you see it . 
  it 's supported by large corporations and pays a lot of money to get press like this , thus ending on a lot of similar lists . 
  it is happening in my hometown but it lacks soul and does n't have any qualities other festivals have . 
  the location is nice , it 's in a city that has a lot of things happening and apparently there 's a lot of perks for campers , but most people just come to listen to the bands and then go home . 
  if i may , [ terraneo ] ( http://www.terraneofestival.com/ ) is on the seaside and started as a personal project . 
  corporate meddling is minimal , it is cheap and bands are n't chosen based on their commercial value . 
  the focus is on visitors , not making heaps of cash . 
  this year 's lineup is n't yet known , but [ last year ] ( http://2012.terraneofestival.com/hr/lineup/2344593046.htm ) was great . 
  `` a bat out of hell '' is a great band name too . 
  maybe just for an album or a song as well . 
  meni je google now bezna\u010dajan u hr . 
  is n't this just a joke , like a stereotype for the situation ? 
  i 've never heard anyone actually had to answer such a stupid question . 
  where do you live ? 
   or if it is flipped onto its roof . 
  so gta is more real than i thought . 
  god , i 'm an idiot . 
  i 'm gon na go and downvote myself . 
  [ further details ] ( http://web.archive.org/web/20111217082110/http://talesofridiculousness.blogspot.com/2010/05/serbiancroatian-swear-words-explained.html ) . 
  it 's interesting that various gods are such an often theme in a religious region . 
  zagreb and the northern regions that represented the heartland were n't under ottoman rule . 
  slavonia was , and so was dalmatia , but they were under strong venetian influence . 
  sure you can , in more than most . 
  yes , how dare people express their thoughts and criticise something you like . 
  so everybody everywhere deserve their success , and you do n't think people have the right to dislike anyone successful ? 
  uss cole and it was n't a carrier . 
  the thing is context matters and sk did n't want to fight a war over it . 
  on par with the west , but it would take decades for the people to find their intelectual spirit again . 
  hrvatice se pale na srbe , just fyi . 
  why do these thing have a longer flying time than regular jets ? 
  you guys feel that proud about having a massive force for fucking up other countries ? 
  i see too many yugos around . 
  was it ever used by presidents of other countries ? 
  people that dumb do n't use apostrophes . 
  what about sites that do n't rely on repeat visitors ? 
  they 're automatically fucked . 
  saying that advertising works is ironic in this thread . 
  modern wars have lower civilian casualties than older ones . 
  do n't make wars nostalgic damnit . 
  what does 4g have to do with anything ? 
  3g can get to 21 mbit/s without much problems . 
  two feet is n't really that big of a blizzard , and this coming from someone on the mediterranean . 
  [ pauline kael disagrees ] ( http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/movies-1/why-paulin-kael-never-saw-a-mo.html ), 
  i have 72 and i 'm afraid i 'll get too used to it . 
  i would argue that it still was much better than dprk . 
   wordpress is a cms . 
  it 's not meant to be modified , it 's meant to be plugged in and used . 
  if i want to master wordpress i need to know how to develop plugins . 
   look at both languages and decide which one you like the syntax of more . 
  and are you more interested in android apps or websites ? 
  php seems easier , but android is more appealing to me . 
  i 'm afraid i 'm losing the capacity to learn , that 's why i 'm going the practical route . 
  thank you for a great comment . 
   regardless of which road you choose , learn javascript .
