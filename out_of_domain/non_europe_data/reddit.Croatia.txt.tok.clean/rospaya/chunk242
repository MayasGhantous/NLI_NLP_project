  i 'm working on that . 
  i 'm not sure i 'm capable enough . 
  i understand the differences , that 's why i said it 's a sorta dumb question . 
  my main worry is - which is easier ? 
  sure i learn things every day , but i 'm afraid i 'm losing the concentration needed for learning how to code . 
  especially since there 's not a lot of great guides and documentation in my native tongue . 
  i want to make stuff , coding is just a tool which i have to use and money is one of the rewards for it . 
  a bunch of hyperbole . 
  - the dud rate of nk shells is a 1/4 . 
  - only the less populater northern parts of seoul are within reach of nk artillery . 
  - sk has good intelligence and the means to destroy the threat after the first shot is fired . 
  it would take a while , but it is doable . 
  - seoul has a lot of shelters . 
  - seoul has over 180 thousand chinese living there . 
   not sure the relevance of that , what does a small population of chinese matter ? 
  just a nugget , one of a hundred reasons why nk wo n't attack when 180 thousand of their allies are in a city . 
  the pc defending legions are always out in force , but did anyone write about how the whole simcity scenario could n't happen on a console ? 
  i 'm not on any side of the issue , but fanboys do n't have a problem stepping out on any thread that concerns pc vs. consoles or anything about valve , but are strangely silent here . 
  is that really the only issue here ? 
  they could ( but currently do n't ) and the issue with simcity is n't just the connection , it 's that the game just does n't work as it should . 
  console companies test games before blessing their release and this one would n't pass . 
  call me dumb , but do n't throw around crap at me . 
  i have more games on steam than hours logged on xbox live . 
  i 'm only noticing the differences between thinking - they always talk about all the advantages pc games have , but not the issues like this one which is pretty exclusive for the platform - sony , microsoft or nintendo would never publish a game that is still periodically unplayable , a week after it came out . 
   the cia did n't invent the fake argo movie idea - canadians did, 
  source ? 
  because i read the original wired story the movie is based on and it says this :, 
   then mendez hit upon an unusual but strangely credible plan : he 'd become kevin costa harkins , an irish film producer leading his preproduction crew through iran to do some location scouting for a big-budget hollywood epic . 
  mendez had contacts in hollywood from past collaborations . 
  wikipedia says this :, 
   the cia enlisted its disguise and exfiltration expert , tony mendez , to provide a cover story , documents , appropriate clothing , and materials to change their appearance . 
  ( ... ) there were alternate passports and identities for a variety of scenarios , but the cover story selected had the six being a hollywood crew scouting movie locations . 
  while argo screwed canadians and ambassador taylor over , people are flipping out over a movie , not a documentary . 
  calling it propaganda is just classic / r/worldpolitics , hating the us every step of the way . 
  i did . 
  he does n't say anything about who thought about argo and people are still upvoting op who is talking nonsense . 
  sure you 'll find buggy or screwed up games , but non that was fundamentally unplayable . 
  just a note : ireland is n't part of the schengen area . 
  on the other hand he should be shot for what he did to new day rising . 
   black is black, 
  you want your baby back ? 
  become ? 
  you must be new here . 
  did you hear that from anyone who knows anything about iran ? 
  it 's like those threads on reddit every few weeks `` beautiful pics of iran ! '', 
  and then people comment that they 're shocked that the country is n't a barren wasteland . 
  i do n't even blame the media , i blame people just making dumb images in their heads before knowing a single thing about a place . 
  when people ask me where i 'm from they usually do n't know about croatia , but they know it 's somewhere in the east and a that they 'll get shot on the first corner . 
  never mind that it 's one of the safest regions in europe and that my hometown is one of the safest capital cities on the continent . 
  you 're acting as if cod is exclusively made for casuals and the millions sold are just for people who would never touch any other game , just like sims or something . 
  can you deal with the fact that it 's a game like any other , just very popular ? 
   if cod never existed , the people playing cod types of game would just be playing either games with a similar skill requirement in another genre or no games at all . 
  i do n't see the point in generalizing the cod market that much . 
  of course i can only speak for myself , but i play cod because it 's simple , fun and cinematic , although i 'm enjoying every new version less and less . 
  what other games i play ? 
  hearts of iron , rise of nations , killing floor . 
  every one of them provides me with a certain kind of fun , and cod is being flogged here just because reddit does n't like it . 
  gta is popular and simple , but it does n't get any flack because it 's a game everyone likes . 
  sorry , the second sentence goes to the whole thread , not just you . 
  people act as if cod is a special skill killing machine only dumb people play . 
  i 'm a whore that would give money for some commercial project i would really like , even without the promise of a reward . 
  four out of my top five bands do n't exist anymore and i would gladly pay to contribute to them making new music . 
  northern exposure . 
  what politics and favor trading would there be today ? 
  i do n't see how cardinals from around the world can do much politics . 
  also , is there any secular interference with the conclave in modern times ? 
  it 's just a wild hunch , but john paul ii could easily be a favorite of western countries to influence polish people . 
  google cares a lot about its image , and killing reader made an uproar on the web . 
  the `` i 'm feeling lucky '' button [ costs google ] ( http://gawker.com/324927/im-feeling-lucky-button-costs-google-110-million-per-year ) more than $ 100 million a year and they still keep it because it 's a symbol . 
  i 'm guessing you 're thinking about the one that was n't a doctor . 
  well it is still there and still costs money . 
  that 's no hydroxyl ion ; that 's my wife !, 
  hate to break it to you guys , but although it looked cool , razr was behind its time . 
  in the same time i used a nokia 6630 which had a normal web browser , 3d games , videos , music and multitasking . 
  razr had 5.5 mb of memory , 6630 had 10 + memory card . 
  the camera was 0.3 versus 1.3 megapixels . 
  i have on my desk : htc one , xperia z , asus padfone 2 , samsung s3 and note 2 , lg 4x hd , lg nexus 4 , htc one x and one x + . 
  considering the hardware i would take one , but the software is suffocating an otherwise excellent phone . 
  which is why of the whole lot i prefer nexus or xperia . 
  somebody needs to post that website where people send pictures of their stillborn children dressed up like they 're alive . 
  ** the ** creepiest shit i 've seen online . 
  nazis sometimes seems as removed from people like napoleon or roman empire . 
  young dumb kids see it in movies and games and perceive it differently if you mix in economic problems , local nazis and bad education . 
  i think he 's a dumb misguided kid that should be forced to spend a few weeks with holocaust survivors , but considering the situation in greece i 'm not surprised with his punishment . 
  it is ** the ** movie to go watch with a lady friend . 
  it 's sad and touching and has a couple of fun moments , enough to get you through the movie . 
  cnn us is shit , cnn international is more credible and professional , altough they have their own problems . 
  oprosti , nisam znao da je ovo `` no foreigners allowed '' subreddit . 
   it costs every company about the same amount to manufacture a phone , he says -- the price of an nvidia processor and a sharp display is consistent whether htc , nokia , or motorola is signing the check . 
  if you plan to sell 50 million phones ( like samsung just did ) you 'll get a better deal than if you 're some blu-whatever that can hope for a million at best . 
  not to mention the logistics which make things cheaper for bigger boys . 
  reminds me of notch :, 
   sometimes when i play a game , the screen goes dark and i see my own reflection in the monitor , and wonder what i 'm doing with my life . 
  a bit later :, 
   then the next level starts . 
  kill the batman . 
  it was n't just to capture one person , it was to deny terrorist organizations a whole country to play with . 
  afghanistan was actively supporting terror groups . 
   afghanistan is rather obvious . 
  only 1 brave soul in congress , barbara lee , voted against bringing an unjust war to that country .
