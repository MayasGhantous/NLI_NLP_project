  it 's the only thing we do well . 
  their first album is all shoegaze . 
  where in split is this ? 
  looks like broadchurch . 
  no but [ this is ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxfoaojup5e ) . 
  good post , but honesty , i have n't seen the hivemind taking sides regarding egypt . 
  mb were very criticized when they came to power but currently i 'm not seeing that separation . 
  unlike syria where assad is seen like a saint on some subreddits . 
  you mean the pot smoking generation of free love ? 
  what makes you think this generation will be so tolerant when they grow up ? 
   polla and cattaro, 
  polla is a landlocked town in italy . 
  and just a side note that this thread is a rare chance to see croatia in the context of wwi and austro-hungary . 
  wwi is a very rare subject in my country and very rarely mentioned in history classes , probably because of the turbulent and rich wwii stories . 
  it seriously depends on the context . 
  one pc approach can say and mean more than another direct one . 
  i do n't have anything against either correctness or foul language , but i want the words to mean something , so my stance is just picking words wisely , no matter how much anyone is or is n't going to be upset . 
  great thread , op . 
  ex-yu countries are all drinking rakija together and periodically get into a massive fight . 
  they clean up and sing `` od vardara pa do triglava '' until serbia notices that kosovo is trying to get its own seat . 
  slovenia tries to distance itself but likes burek and rakija too much . 
  [ here 's the legend ] ( http://mapsontheweb.tumblr.com/post/58511007793/official-delegations-at-the-funeral-of-josip-broz ), 
   blue - nations that sent state delegations, 
  orange - nations that did n't send state delegations , but organizations from those nations did, 
  yellow - nations that did n't send state delegations, 
  from wikipedia :, 
   his funeral drew many world statesmen . 
  [ 2 ] based on the number of attending politicians and state delegations , at the time it was the largest state funeral in history . 
  [ 3 ] they included four kings , 31 presidents , six princes , 22 prime ministers and 47 ministers of foreign affairs . 
  they came from both sides of the cold war , from 128 different countries out of 154 uno members at the time . 
  at what point did canadians started being ... canadians ? 
  i saw them about two weeks ago on an open air festival . 
  front row , no earplugs . 
  almost wet myself on only shallow . 
  thanks , i have n't noticed . 
  i 'll bet none of them . 
  it did n't hurt . 
  it was loud as hell , but i was n't the only one and i do n't have any regrets . 
  aka you will disagree with it . 
  i 'm loving this journalist bashing thread , in the same time everybody forgets who published documents snowden and assange dug up . 
  they did n't do it themselves , a lot of newspapers did it for them . 
  there was a report some time ago that mcdonalds was the first to bring queuing to hong kong .

  i do n't have any concrete information for you and although i do n't like to be the bearer of bad news , starting a new business in this country is very hard and frustrating , even more so for foreigners . 
  it 's a pain in the ass , as any job creator on / r/croatia can tell you . 
  of course . 
  i 'm just warning him . 
  a lot of people i know started to open businesses less complex than a restaurant and lived to regret even thinking about it . 
  croatia is nowhere near a business friendly country . 
  not saying if it 's good or bad , just commenting on the fact that most redditors do n't have a clue how politics , diplomacy and intl relations work . 
   well , then why 's everybody telling him not to come ? 
  instead of simply stating - yankee go home - people are polite and pretend the situation is not business savy . 
  nobody is telling him to go home . 
  i want him to come and invest and open up jobs , but i 'm telling him as a person to person , opening a business here is a pain in the ass for locals , for foreigners even worse . 
  [ this list ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index ) tells you that we do n't need to `` pretend the situation is not busness savy '' because is * is n't * . 
   ( i 've never seen ramen in my life ), 
  we do have ramen-ish food , like microwave made pasta , but it is n't cheap . 
  i 'll just leave [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index#ranking ) here and wait for you to explain to me how the 80 places of difference between the us and croatia mean nothing . 
  i 'm not sure you have the right statistics . 
   split has been one of europe 's top tourist destinations year after year . 
  zagreb gets more tourists than split and it is not really a tourist town . 
  split has only recently become more than a tranist city , although there is potential for growth . 
   croatia 's annual gdp has been steadily raising around 2.4 % per year compared to the rest of the eu which is around .9 % . 
  croatia has n't had gdp growth in years . 
  a lot of often irrational rules and regulations , high taxes and other fiscal hurdles for businesses , high cost of work , slow and inefficient bureaucracy , similarly slow legal system . 
  and that 's without all the other minor problems he might face . 
  look , i basically agree with you and others , we lack the `` can do '' attitude and are generally a risk averse country that looks suspiciously on entrepreneurs and businessmen , but nobody can convince me that the local mentality is more to blame for that than awful regulations . 
  as a croat : please , go ahead and start a business , employ locals and bring another fine restaurant to split . 
  but as a person : dude , be ready for a fair amount of pain . 
   i 'm a huge basketball player so if you know of some good courts that get high traffic or that get virtually none then that would be awesome . 
  not sure about sisak , but you have a lot of courts in zagreb . 
  also , keep in mind that sisak is in a bit of a depression . 
  it is primarily an industrial city that is suffering because of the refinery and closing of the metal factory . 
  so you are saying that it 's actually not any harder to run a business in croatia than anywhere else , it 's just the economists , media , politicians , public and everybody else that are thinking wrong ? 
  starting and running , yes . 
  no numbers in that article . 
  split has a huge potential but not enough hotels and capacity at this moment . 
  i 'm saying this regarding op 's statement that split is one of europe 's top tourist destination , not about his restaurant - split is a great location for that . 
  op is n't selling a service , he 's buying or renting a place , getting employees and fulfilling a shitload of regulations concerning everything from health and safety to special rules of conduct in places of historical significance , which most of downtown split is . 
  then there 's taxes , vat and paying it in front , paying the chamber of commerce ... [ here 's ] ( http://liderpress.hr/galerije/foto/glasajte-za-najapsurdniji-zakon/ ) a nice list . 
  that all without mentioning all the lawyer fees , standing in line , arguing with clerks , paying huge interest fees to banks . 
  if he 's lucky he wo n't get a visit from the local men in black who love visiting restaurants , cafes and clubs , offering their * security * services . 
  thanks for your offer but i wo n't take it . 
  i had a business idea and potential funding but people who went that way gave me enough advice to know that it is a lot of pain for the potential gain . 
  one of them went to switzerland and the other to london to make their projects come true . 
  my whole point is that starting and running a business is hard practically anywhere , but it is harder in croatia , and various lists , people and media back me up on that . 
  i would love to see a similar map of europe . 
  we have [ one of the largest ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mamutica ) such buildings in croatia , but our versions are n't that bad to live in . 
  mamutica is quite cozy . 
   he 's a gifted songwriter for sure , and i have no idea what his next steps will be , he did let go the control of the band with bosnian rainbows , and the absence of cedric on this new project it 's too noticeable, 
  i saw bosnian rainbows a few weeks ago . 
  omar was either wasted or sick , because most of the time he did n't feel present on the stage . 
  one jennifer aniston poop article finances two about snowden , and the fact that it exists does n't mean that they do n't produce good journalism . 
  would you say you got a woody watching that ? 
  suprotnost se zove anarhija , libertarijanizam , objektivizam , whatever . 
  we live in the most prosperous time in human history , with poverty , hunger , wars and mostly everything else at its record low . 
  fa\u0161izam i nacizam su izrazi koji vi\u0161e nemaju smisla , [ kako je to orwell fino objasnio ] ( http://orwell.ru/library/articles/as_i_please/english/efasc ) . 
  glup argument . 
  a lot of them yes . 
  it 's not something i quite understand , but sometimes it feels like i 'm intruding someone 's day because i ask for info , order food or try to buy something , as if i 'm not leaving a hefty sum of money on their desk .
