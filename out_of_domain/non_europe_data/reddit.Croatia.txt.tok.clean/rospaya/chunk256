  it 's not you , it 's them . 
   the sheer volume of comments on reddit recently that seem to be either astroturfing or the work of useful idiots has really hit a peak in the last several days , and it 's frightening as hell . 
  everybody who does n't think like me is a shill . 
  depends what you 're interested in . 
  [ the west wing describes why the presidential system is the most dangerous us export ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js1ejz6h_ke ), 
  so begins the deification of a living man . 
  speaking of female characters on breaking bad ... 
  it 's one of the worst aspects of the show . 
  every female is shallow , one dimensional and serves as a dumb instrument that moves the story forward a bit . 
  except jesse 's girfriends , none of them are relatable , fun or smart . 
  some are made just to be hated . 
  serbs sure , croats no . 
  most , but i love these two . 
  so how did nate silver ( among others ) manage to correctly estimate what state is going to who ? 
  all of that data came from publicly available polls btw . 
  maybe in the us . 
  in the rest of the world there has always been war and the time we live in is the most peaceful in history . 
  governments are made from millions of regular people , and that 's the reason why wide scale conspiracies would never work . 
  9/11 was n't a false flag operation because it would involve hundreds of people who are n't efficient in day-to-day work , so how could they do something as complex as this without spilling the beans ? 
   anyone with a brain knows the navy is n't spending a bunch of money to study the sky, 
  the military spends loads of money for studying a lot of things , why would this be any different ? 
  why fake it ? 
  adoption is popular . 
  first time i heard loveless by my bloody valentine . 
  i was walking home from work and the sunset was very bright so it illuminated the whole street from behind me . 
  everything was yellow and red . 
  i increased the volume and pressed play . 
  after 30 seconds of [ only shallow ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf8j1bugwj8 ) i realized i was standing in the middle of the street with my eyes opened . 
  heard mbv live a few weeks ago . 
  fell on my knees on the same song , but i 'll attribute that to exhaustion and alcohol . 
  you are really exaggerating . 
  a television screen is as modern as ever , television networks are n't . 
   serbia was the strongest force in the balkans in the 90 's, 
  even if true , that statement means nothing or very little . 
  the balkans are and were a powder keg and an intersection of us , eu , russian and to an extent turkish interests . 
  serbia was in the economical gutter in the 90 's with rampant inflation , sanctions and huge crime issues . 
  scratch that , serbia was in every possible gutter and without mother russia 's sponsorship had no sway one inch outside its borders . 
  even inside , as kosovo has proven . 
  so your theory may have some sense , but not in this regard . 
  he left because it was in his contract after selling reddit . 
  because this is `` so what '' . 
  i know of at least five networks like that in my small country , most of them made in the early 2000 's . 
  the article is worded like this is a phenomenon and something unique , an answer to state and corporate internet censorship . 
  it 's not . 
  it has been here since forever and a lot of the old networks do n't even exist anymore because isp 's offer faster speeds - that 's what most of these networks are about . 
  piracy . 
  this independent state gdp 's are misguided because their economies would be very different if they seceded . 
  i banged the girl from hanson . 
  most reports from the ground say that the shells were fired from weapon systems the rebels do n't have . 
  it 's really interesting . 
  my ( smallish ) country has 18 % unemployment and 50 % among young people and it is considered one of the safest in europe . 
  \u0160ipan is really a magical place . 
  i was there years ago when it was even less known to people . 
  like almost every other piece about syria , this one is dealing with logic and supposed common sense , and not with evidence . 
  motive is important , but without hard evidence everything else is speculation , and speculation and different opinions mean jack shit . 
  there actually * is * one spot in north america that sells french cars . 
   there is no hard evidence , none whatsoever that assad used chemical weapons, 
  there are multiple pieces actually . 
  the missiles used to deploy cw can only be used on ramps and tubes that are part of weapons systems that the rebels do n't have , only assad 's military . 
   let 's bomb syria back into the 3rd world so that al qaeda can take over ? 
  there are hundreds of opposition factions , al qaeda allied ones are n't in the majority . 
   so why enter into a war with his regime ? 
  because realpolitik . 
  not that crazy . 
  a few months of 70 % average pay , then 50 % , after that minimum wage . 
  one year . 
   the ones used in syria have been fired by mortas, 
  [ this ] ( http://rogueadventurer.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/zydqvcg.jpg?w=690 ) is n't a mortar . 
  the reported dimensions are between 2,8 and 3,5 meters , which is launched from a weapons system , not a simple howitzer or mortar . 
  i 've said * one of the safest * since there are some really pacifist countries on the continent . 
  [ numbeo ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp ) rates us between sweden and finland when considering crime . 
  there 's even a [ un report ] ( http://www.gadling.com/2008/05/30/un-balkans-the-safest-region-in-europe/ ) rating the balkans as one of the safest regions on the continent . 
  brown moses , rogue adventurer and cj chivers are doing an excellent job on this . 
  open source intelligence . 
  or just open any photo of the attack and look at the shells yourself . 
  [ example ] ( http://rogueadventurer.com/2013/08/25/preliminary-analysis-of-alleged-cw-munitions-used-in-syria/ ), 
  israel certainly no . 
  not because they 're above it , but because they were mostly out of the whole thing , intervening only when they got intel about weapons that would hurt them . 
  a western intervention would certainly bring hezbollah retribution . 
  what are these ideals ? 
  i 'd say the constitution , but a lot it is debated all the time . 
  secularism , gun rights etc. 
  i really ** really ** hate to be the devil 's advocate here , but it 's a mutual relationship . 
  paparazzi photographers sell celebrity images to magazines which publish them and elevate their status - they make somebody a celebrity , or at least a bigger celebrity . 
  on count of that they can be sure their movies/albums/whatever will get more exposure and they 'll get more money out of it . 
  it 's an ugly business but the system works that way , at least for most celebs . 
  oh for fucks sake , one of these days i 'll get a seizure from these fucking gifs . 
  mostly the screen . 
  an e-ink screen is the closest you can get to paper . 
  it is incredibly sharp , has a great viewing angle and is really miles in quality from the best lcd . 
  they 're made for reading and that 's it . 
  [ the rise and fall of yugoslavia 's peace and porn hotel ] ( http://balkanist.net/haludovo-palace-peace-and-porn-hotel/ ), 
  [ how to write about the balkans ] ( http://balkanist.net/how-to-write-about-the-balkans/ ), 
  [ the dark side of croatia 's tourist boom ] ( http://balkanist.net/dark-side-of-croatia-tourism-boom/ ), 
  everyone kills hitler on their first time . 
  the rebels are made out of numerous groups and factions . 
  there are no single `` rebels '' , but there is a single government . 
  it 's not most , it is some . 
   the usaf/nato do not have air superiority, 
  source on that ?
