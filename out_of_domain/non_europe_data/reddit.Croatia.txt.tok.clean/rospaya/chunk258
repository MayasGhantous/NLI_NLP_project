  they mostly have good specs and are nice machines out of the box , but build quality and performance fail over time . 
  watch out for degradations on the edges , be careful with any bigger surface like the lid and palm rest and do n't think it can handle a lot of damage . 
  if you got a good configuration the laptop will eat through anything you throw at him , just do n't expect to do the same for a long time . 
  but if it misses by a few feet nothing happens ? 
  something explosive would still destroy it , right ?

  hong kong , not beijing . 
  mcdonalds practically instituted queuing in that place . 
  did you watch the movie or are you just speculating ? 
  would you think the same thing if it was wikileaks worship ? 
  his self-confident sherlock role helps a lot . 
  yes i did but nowhere does it show what the movie will be like , just a quote from benedict which can mean absolutely nothing . 
  the truth is - unless we see the movie we know shit , and shit inflammatory speculation is being upvoted as fact just because it 's likely . 
  the thing i hate most about reddit . 
  the croatian wikipedia is in the news these days , even the government issued a warning that it should n't be used for research . 
  exactly , but the point does n't change . 
  some comments here are fucking disgusting . 
  `` shoot the old hag '' or `` i pray she dies a slow death '' and all of them fairly upvoted ? 
  i understand the outrage , but we 're supposed to be better than petty and disgusting insults .

  the us is n't staying in europe because it is so noble , but because it has interests in doing so . 
  most european militaries are n't spending enough to meet nato standards , but that 's because most ( almost all ) of them do n't have the need to keep a presence outside their own countries , except for some limited peacekeeping . 
  also let 's not forget from where most military equipment comes from . 
  jerry always takes the fall .

   hey everyone ... 
  i noticed that it 's almost always `` hey guys '' . 
  i really dislike ann . 
  and in brazil it 's ueueueueueueueue, 
  i do n't get it . 
  europeans do n't have veterans or do n't run in their name or what ? 
  why is this making rounds now , since i 'm pretty sure i read about this years ago . 
  yes , because the muslims doing terrorist attacks are the ones worrying about pr , not the ones sitting at home and watching this unfold . 
  ehehehehe . 
  fuck my ass and call me cindy . 
  does it taste like almdudler ? 
  that thing was beautiful . 
  what 's the link ? 
  oh , i thought it was an e-book for kindle , not an app . 
  thanks anyway .

   also curious how much islamic extremism played a part in the war . 
  limited . 
  the most common quoted number says that about 2000 mujahideens fought for the bosnians and their actions did n't make much of a dent . 
  the result today is some extremism but most bosnians are moderate muslims and view the us favorably . 
  albanians even love them . 
  i say 8 o'clock or 8 in the evening but write 20 . 
  riots in fooball ( soccer ) are mostly cultural or political , the games are just just a backdrop . 
  in the us ( as i 've noticed ) they 're about losing or even winning . 
  realno oboje . 
   the conflict in the middle east has raged for thousands of years . 
  did any populated part of the planet endure peace for so long that it could be called peaceful ? 
  by that logic you could say that the conflict in europe has raged for thousands of years , since i 'm not sure there were 20 years of peace on the continent for centuries . 
  the sonderbund war in 1847 was a century and a half ago , which is just a blip in the thousands of years of wars scheme op mentions . 
  for anyone in zagreb : dubrava . 
  do n't exaggerate , such clubs are still in the minority and there 's only one club like that anywhere near the city center and it is high class and plays mixed music . 
  zagreb is still full of rock , alternative and electro clubs , not to mention the zillion bars that play mtv top 40 crap . 
  turbofolk is still marginalized and looked upon .
