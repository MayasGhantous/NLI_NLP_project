  killing is always immoral , taking another life is wrong , but it can be justified in some cases like self defense , saving other lives and similar reasons . 
  but in revenge or punishment , no . 
  why should a police officer 's life be more worthy ? 
  that 's the problem with the prison , not the system . 
  again , that 's the problem with the prison . 
  tell me with a straight face that we should kill people just because the prison does n't do it 's job ? 
  more people die because the prisons do n't rehabilitate inmates and prepare them for outside life . 
  that 's the thing we need to change . 
  it was a question , not an accusation , do n't worry , 
  well soooorry . 
  i just wanted to feel loved for once !, 
  long story ... 
  which i will share . 
  for state colleges you have to write an entrance exam , which is calculated with high school grades and the best half gets in free , and others pay some small money to get in . 
  i ended up 350 out of 1500 people , and only the first 210 get in . 
  the thing is this college ( political sciences with a politics and journalism courses , i went to journalism ) was second or third choice among people who got into law , economics or philosophy . 
  so in the week after publicising the exam results people who wanted to get in , among the first 210 , got in . 
  and one day they read peoples names in the auditorium and if somebody was n't there and his name was read , he obviously did n't want to get it so they would move to the next . 
  they got to around 370 . 
  now the rage part : i 'm a journalist for the last 3-4 years so i sent around 160 pages of my work . 
  i got 2 out of 21 points for that , this moved me 2 places forward , while 21 points would move me around 100 places . 
  but i got in , so fuck yea . 
  thanks bro , thanks . 
  `` the gold is hidden in ... '' * gasp *, 
  [ no ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/topnews/idusl2781433020070827 ), 
  i 've already said , the only reason i want two kids is so they could recreate pulp fiction for me . 
  ah , i dream about it for years : just muting the volume on tv and having my kids talk about fast food in europe , gurmet coffee and dead peoples motorcycles . 
  what the hell does this have to do with the [ prodigy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmin5wkoupw ) ? 
  i think [ prodigy ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbb_qfrx2iu ) would like to have a word with him . 
  `` i thought fat girls have big tits '', 
  that 's because you think most gun owners are rational and trained people . 
   i will probably carry, 
  a couple of years ago my friend told me he 's getting a cs spray because he 's afraid of getting attacked in the middle of the night . 
  the thing i told him i believe today , too : i would rather get beat up once than living constantly in fear . 
  with a gun the fear is even bigger - you never know what idiot will take you for a threat because you carry a weapon . 
   i have no reason to harm anyone, 
  what about the other 100 milion people ? 
  will they be as rational as you ? 
  only if [ prodigy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prodigy_ ( online_service ) \\ ) gets back . 
  yea . 
  we could ask [ prodigy ] ( http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/186367-39252-prodigy_super.jpg ) to come with us . 
  shit . 
  i got only 16,4 % . 
  modern warfare 2 , r.u.s.e and , most of all , brutal legend . 
  the moment i read this i heard a moog [ prodigy ] ( http://www.vintagesynth.com/moog/prodigy.php ) in the background . 
  it sounded so epic . 
  now you 've reminded me about les paul ... 
  someone should really make a documentary about him . 
  maybe we should ask the [ prodigy ] ( http://www.prodigyfilms.com/prodigyfilms_home.aspx ) films , i heard they 're good . 
  i see the guns thing is working great for the us , crime is low , the government is acting within its constitutional roles and is no way passing laws that could be mistaken as tyrannic ( what 's it 's called ... patriot act , or something ? ) . 
  if half of iran is armed what would happen ? 
  they would overthrow the government and impose a democratic regime , or would their faith be near to that of a neighbouring country which is now having its renaissance - iraq ? 
  oh , btw , iranians can have weapons . 
  edit : spelling, 
  oh i hope you 're ok . last time i got injured my doctor recommended that i relax more , so i bought this great [ prodigy ] ( http://www.hotspring.com/spa_showroom_hot_tub/spa_model_prodigy.html ) tub . 
  really relaxing . 
  if you have some trouble because of it , you can always use [ prodigy ] ( http://www.crestron.com/solutions/prodigy_affordable_home_automation/ ) home automation . 
  yea , it looked funny but i was on a phone and english is not my first language . 
  thanks . 
  i made an ass out of myself when i was in tunisia during ramadan . 
  dumb as i were , i did n't notice it until the end , but being in a hotel i still got alcohol , meat and everything . 
  it * is * a new idea ... 
  i have a 32 '' sony lcd tv , a 19 '' lg lcd monitor , a 13,3 '' laptop , a 2,6 '' smartphone and a 2 '' mp3 player . 
  i 've watched movies on all of them and everything depends on the movie , mood and situation . 
  watching american pie on a phone in the tram was ok , the same way watching fight club was ok on my tv . 
  nobody in their right mind will invite 10 people to watch a high action high detail movie on a small screen , but a stupid comedy , why not ? 
  the soundtrack rocks though . 
  like one of those who play [ prodigy ] ( http://www.prodigyinstruments.com/index.asp ) violins ? 
  oh i heard starbucks uses [ prodigy ] ( http://www.prodigypay.com/ ) payment systems . 
  [ hot shots ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hot_shots ) when i was a kid . 
  i remember some scenes made me literaly roll on the floor , and i 'm not a man you can easily amuse . 
  out of recent movies , probably the wrestling in borat . 
  i 'm sure there 's a funnier scene , but none of theme were that memorable . 
  i tried red hat years ago , then knoppix , then suse and now ubuntu . 
  maybe linux is n't for everybody , but i could n't force myself to like it . 
  today i only use ubuntu as a second os for experimenting . 
  linux is more exciting to me on mobile platforms , because is spreads the functionality of the device more than on the pc . 
  well i think they have ... ** more than a feeeliiiing !, 
  khm , excuse me . 
  best korea, 
  after all the nonsense and crap we heard about obama and healthcare reform , no to mention socialism and frequent comparisons to nazi germany ... 
  ya 'll do n't have a problem with such a person having a rifle on a meeting , near the potus ? 
  because we 're suuuure they 're rational people who have a down to earth opinion about the reform and obama ... 
  95 % is a little to harsh , but i agree . 
  i often facepalm when i read what my colleagues write . 
  again , i agree . 
  most people do the ol' copy paste and think their duty is done . 
  i ca n't say i 'm completely innocent of this , but you ca n't expect someone to investigate everything behind a simple dumb pr . 
  i wrote in english , too , including a semi famous site most geeks know about . 
  the `` to '' was a mistake , and i do n't watch my spelling when on reddit , but grammar nazis do n't seem to bite . 
  i 'm aware my english is not at a pro level so spellchecking comes as natural when writing articles . 
  well , the 98 % muslim country in africa . 
  but you 're right , it 's secular so it 's another thing . 
  that 's a horrible site . 
  they 'd be better off with joomla and some joomla [ prodigy ] ( http://www.joomlaprodigy.com/ ) modules for it .

  xbox 360 and wii can play pirated games . 
  people are not like me and / or perfect !, 
   ` mac book air , ' apple 's latest master-piece , is the world 's thinnest laptop ever .
