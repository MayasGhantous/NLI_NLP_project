  not that it changes your point , but black mirror was made by an independent company for channel 4 , a publicly owned channel that gets 91 % of its funding from commercial sources . 
  what a lot of americans do n't know - [ a lot of countries ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_broadcasting ) have a public broadcasting corporation that makes programs of public importance . 
  funding is varied but in most european countries it is from some sort of a tv levy or tax . 
  a lot of those station do n't have ads or only carry commercials of humanitarian importance . 
  this . 
  also the yugoslavia story is interesting because most yugoslav nations had german collaborator regimes as well as partisans ( basically a civil war ) and the resistance got full allied support ( switched from the \u010cetniks ) only after the tehran conference in 1943 . 
  a firme ? 
  they 're in this shit with the rest of us . 
  about half of my amazon orders were more expensive to ship than actually buy .

  this is probably the best post / r/music had in a looong time . 
  they deserved a punishment for theft and being dumb , and the last time i checked the price for that was n't death .

  there are thousands of pages that treat me like a visitor , not an enemy , and they deserve my views .

  i would love to see a map of the nice and less nice areas . 
  daily mail je za ove smib . 
  the moment we find out that brody is definitely a muslim ( and therefore think that he * may * be a terrorist ) is probably the best one in the series . 
  i loved the whole thing . 
  although i would n't call it racist , it certainly made you think . 
  a sikh got killed after 9/11 because a guy [ confused ] ( http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/05/10-years-after-sikh-murder-over-911-community-continues-to-blend-in-and-stand-out/ ) him with a muslim . 
  nop . 
  rs was never just a music mag . 
  i 've seen a yugoslav one as well . 
  actually ignore me , i think i 've mistaken it with another one . 
  but now that i think about it , i would love to see a yugo one , even fake . 
  croatia has a surprisingly strong stoner rock scene .

  excellent !, 
  wikipedia says yugoslavs so i 'm using that one . 
  i think you are . 
  god forbid somebody has an opinion in this subreddit , or maybe even hate an artist that is n't nickelback . 
  some music sucks . 
  a lot of it is made just to make money . 
  deal with it . 
  yeah , but having more armed men around you helps your odds . 
  also nikola tesla , not nicola . 
  in the butt ? 
  put do pakla , dobre namjere i sve to . 
  also the basic unconditional income combines other sources like welfare and pensions . 
   perhaps if other countries in europe had taken a page out of bulgaria 's book , maybe a few more lives could have been saved . 
  this is n't a fair thing to say , a lot of countries did n't have any choice . 
  was everyone evil except bulgaria and denmark ? 
  i wanted to squeeze that in since i see it all the time . 
  even if there was a point , we 've spent hours looking at her boring woes instead of having some goddamn action . 
  whoa , ringo starr from thomas the tank engine ? 
  watch the british version of state of play . 
  it made me want to be a better journalist . 
  so this is a thing ? 
  it was a rarely used old croatian saying , but it was only made massive during wwii when the fascist ( usta\u0161e ) regime used it as their salute . 
  the emigration ( extremely right wing ) continued to use it and even today a lot of croatian emigration organizations are openly fascist . 
  \u0160imuni\u0107 is from australia . 
  in the 90 's it was brought back , along with a few other usta\u0161e symbols and causes by the right wing to forcibly create a new croatian identity , as much different from the serbian/slavic one as they could , to rally the people against the serbs . 
  it is very clear what the saying means but fascism goes unpunished in our society so everybody is surprised that someone ( gasp ! ), 
  got punished for it . 
  \u0160imuni\u0107 may be a dumbass who just said something he saw as patriotic ( patriotism is something the right wing thinks they only have the right to use ) but the thousands that cheered with him usually chant `` kill kill kill the serb '' and similar pretty things . 
  yeah , tu\u0111man was a real peacemaker . 
  and that changes the fact that croats killed hundreds of thousands of serbs , gypsies , jews and croats who did n't agree being a nazi stooge . 
  i would n't agree with that , considering that he half-planned the conflict with serbs in bosnia . 
  [ relevant west wing clip ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js1ejz6h_ke ), 
   it is offensive, 
   but the fact is he did n't used it because he support the old facist regime . 
  the problem is because he is not educated , and he obviously do n't know some facts from the past . 
  i 'm an android fanboy and generally ca n't stand apple ( although i 'm fixing an mbp right now and it 's not bad ) but i have n't find an android tablet that can compete with ipads . 
  the things is that they have beautiful games and apps , really high end stuff that android lacks . 
  even windows , clunky as it is , has heavy duty apps that make it worth while . 
  ~ ~ i 'm doing this right now and i 'm stuck on converting the iso to img ... 
  i 've googled but i do n't see my error anywhere `` convert failed - error -4 '' . ~ ~,

  solved that .

  yup . 
  but it 's important for the distro to be user friendly after i install it . 
  thanks for the info but i 've run into dozens of problems trying to install ubuntu for the past four hours . 
  i 've tried around five different guides and every one failed at some point and i 'm running out of patience . 
  thanks for the links , i 'll see if i can use the guide you 've posted . 
  i 've had this for some time but it is n't working after latitude got closed . 
  how do i enable it ? 
  i did n't realize how lucky i am until i traveled a bit around europe .

  latin on reddit - one of the few times my high school education pays off . 
  where i live most high school students have four years of latin classes , it 's really frustrating for anyone who does n't have interests you have or a real determination to go into medicine or pharmacy . 
  huh . 
  i live about an hour away from that place .
