  thanks . 
   john stewart, 
  finland is n't in nato . 
  yup . 
  but do n't forget which side bears the largest part of blame . 
  one side started four conflicts , killed 3/4 of all civilians in the war and was the only one that did n't fought on its own territory . 
  nato would be alarmed anyway . 
  depends on the priest . 
  it 's tiny if you look at the map , but i 've walked through the whole thing and it 's more than a days work if you want to explore it like you would do with any other city . 
  i do n't get it . 
  there are a lot of rules with the tonnage and type of ships that you can send to the black sea . 
  thanks . 
  i know that skinheads have a reputation of being working class , but did n't get that punks and metalheads must be deadbeats . 
  the internet is full of armchair military buffs who can list tactics , policy , hardware , units and history all day . 
  this is all public information . 
  stereotypes are n't the same in every corner of the world ya know .

  ooh , can you find the episode ? 
  i 'd love to hear it . 
  oh i love comments like this from people who only click on shit pictures and memes . 
  click on a news article from buzzfeed and you 'll see that they have an excellent news and investigative journalism team . 
  the shitty lists is where they make their money . 
  the articles are where they get the glory . 
  can anyone confirm if they give a fuck ?

  that 's not an elected position . 
  u \u010demu je problem ? 
  here 's a snippet from a good article with a bad title . 
   the so-called resurgence russia has enjoyed since putin first assumed power has also been built on high energy prices . 
  and like the soviet leaders before him , putin has squandered the temporary respite provided by high energy prices instead of using it to reinvest in the country and its people . 
  as the european bank of reconstruction and development noted gloomily in december 2012 , ** `` not only are russian exports highly concentrated in natural resources , this concentration has increased over time : the shares of oil , gas and other minerals in russia 's exports are higher today than they were 15 years ago . '' **, 
   it went on to reflect : `` in 2012 russia remains highly dependent on its natural resources . 
  ** oil and gas now account for nearly 70 percent of total goods exports ... . 
  oil and gas revenues also contribute around half of the federal budget . 
  ** the non-oil fiscal deficit has averaged more than 11 per cent of gdp since 2009 , while the oil price consistent with a balanced budget is now in the region of us$ 115 per barrel and rising . '', 
   the problem with the russian federation 's economic model , much like that of the soviet union 's before it , is that it is only sustainable so long as energy prices remain artificially high . 
  but , of course , energy prices are almost certainly going to decline over the coming years as a result of greater energy efficiency in the west , slowing growth in the east , and greater supply as a result of the energy revolutions being enjoyed in the western hemisphere and elsewhere around the world . 
  and as goes the price of oil so goes the russian state . 
  eu wo n't stop all trade since that would cause too much problems on both sides , but russia is fucked either way . 
  they depend on oil so much that they need to do something to get global prices up in a time when they will certainly go down . 
  that depends on how europe goes on shale gas , but new fields in the east med and shale in north america will certainly do that . 
  they do n't care about locals . 
  they care about tourists , about drunk englishmen , italians and germans , where that price is the norm . 
  bio sam na dva , bilo je super . 
  in some countries it 's customary to bring an envelope with some money in it , something between `` i 'm paying for my food , drinks and slice of cake '' and `` buy yourself a microwave kids . '', 
  at first i was against that kind of stuff , but now i 'm liking the idea . 
  from my end , i can buy a small symbolic gift and just give the rest in cash without thinking about it . 
  the other side gets a nice boost when they need it the most . 
  srami se . 
  they 're nutty about that in sone places . 
  money gets thrown at you like rice , people brag about how much they gave . 
  envelopes are fine . 
  to nije projekt nego strategija . 
  jebo vas happy da vas jebo . 
  all beautiful cities . 
  i 'm a big fan of rijeka but c'mon , it 's nothing close to a tourist city like any of the others you mentioned and it 's obvious op is more of a `` pretty beaches and pretty houses '' kind of person . 
  there are solid rumors that google play music is going to be available in croatia soon so i 'm betting that it 's connected with this . 
  pa jasno je . 
  not news , eu officials announced this years ago . 
  the 12 con votes were from british ukip and bnp members and dutch pvv . 
  all of them rightwing parties . 
  they 're good arguments , but i feel that a better sense of humor might help them more than a punishment . 
  i say this as a neckbeard nerd myself . 
  they announced that dropping them would be the end goal . 
  because lgbt is n't just a sexual preference , it 's a group of people , almost a subculture that has a few common traits . 
  just as the difference between black pride and white pride . 
  my point is that the 12 con votes came from the members of two parties . 
  i expanded on that saying that both of the parties are right wing . 
   well-connected smaller ` malls ' with residential development above . 
  this has been common in places like hong kong for a long time but less common in the west . 
  but its coming . 
  i work right next to one in central europe . 
  it has three stories of stores and cafes , a food court and over that high end apartments and it 's well connected by trams and cars , but since it 's in the center of the city you can get there on foot . 
  it 's the only shopping mall i do n't dislike since it 's small and practical , and gravitates to its surroundings . 
  other malls are made for cars and act as substitutions for public squares .
