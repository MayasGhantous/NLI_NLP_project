  really ? 
  i 've heard only good things and when they came to town the concert was universally pronounced the best one in the season . 
  i fucking loved it . 
  i thought it was just a bad venue but yeah , they were n't that great . 
  this is tough to write down since they 're some of my favorite bands but here are the concerts that let me down at least a bit . 
  - red hot chili peppers put too much emphasis on the bass and the sound was a bit shallow . 
  it was too much just a regular stadium show , much like u2 , but i hate them so that 's that . 
  - tame impala were tough to hear or understand , the music did n't have the beauty it has on the records , but i blame the cramped venue for that . 
  - nofx were rowdy and funny but that 's it . 
  - airbourne , so generic . 
  - bloc party was boring and i really expected a lot more than `` let 's do this and go drink backstage '' . 
  - editors were so boring i forgot about them . 
  fucking evan dando sounded awful and was probably drunk . 
  left before i knew whether it was going to go anywhere . 
  - novelle vague sounded dull in an open field , i 'm not sure they would sound better anywhere except a small club . 
  that 's from the top of my head . 
  here you go, 
  finally , someone gives that fucking planet what it has going for it . 
  screw mars . 
  apple does it for a reason , to reduce the secondary market .

   i read that he was your favourite husker du songwriter ?

  grant had some really great songs in husker du and i think the sort of competitive nature and the dual [ songwriting ] of the band was a great thing in husker du . 
  i 've gotten to know bob [ mould ] a little bit and hung out with him so i have a hard time saying grant is my favourite , 'cause bob is pretty amazing .
