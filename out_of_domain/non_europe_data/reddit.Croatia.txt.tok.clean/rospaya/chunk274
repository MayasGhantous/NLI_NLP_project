  pavelic was technically the pm until 1943 , but his main title was poglavnik , something like duce or fuhrer . 
  a point of trivia is that the italians forced a king onto fascist croatia , tomislav ii who liked to gamble too much to ever actually assume power . 
  the business plot is still disputed to this day . 
  prescott bush or no bush . 
  from your house ? 
  there 's also this one, 
   being worried about the germans was pretty much specific to the first half of the 20th century . 
  well since german unification happened only in 1871 , that makes sense . 
  most people do n't know the difference between commentary , opinion , op-ed , letter to the editor , blog or whatever . 
  my best gig of 2013 that can be described by a single photo . 
  [ this one ] ( https://scontent-b-mxp.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1.0-9/p180x540/1378419_571458072914033_1587511366_n.jpg ) . 
  i fly ryanair and easyjet . 
  they hold raffles on flights , the air you breath in is n't free and i 'm treated like cattle . 
  for two hours . 
  after that i calculate that the ride to the airport cost as much as the flight and i go buy myself a beer as an award for the trouble while i 'm counting the hundreds i saved by not using a big carrier . 
  i 'm booking tickets right now to a few european capitals and all of them put together cost as much as a single airbnb rental . 
  su-25 's attacked the factory in georgia where they were made , possibly the only time that happened . 
  helloooo mr godwin . 
  you 're a good guy . 
  or a killer/rapist . 
  i 've reported from about a dozen medium to big festivals and numerous small ones . 
  one thing i consider is that a festival is n't just a series of live acts , there are loads of things to do and stuff 's happening all the time . 
  depending how large it is and where it 's hosted , a festival can be a major event for the locals and in some cases even a country - your coverage becomes more than just a concert report . 
  generally , it is n't easy and a lot of times it is n't fun which is why i pay for the festivals i really want to enjoy . 
  it sucks having to skip a favorite artist to interview someone , to get hyped for something and then missing it because the arguably more media interesting act is going to be on another stage . 
  i got to talk to very cool people ( questlove , dj shadow , david eugene edwards ) and missed the baseball project , stephen malkmus and the jicks and the swans because of it . 
  rejected some i prefer not to talk about out of shame . 
  anyway , be more of a journalist and less of a music journalist . 
  report about the technicalities , talk to a lot of folks , try to get more of a general vibe and less `` the headliner was great/meh . '', 
  note that this is just my personal experience from writing about shows in a few european countries , us tradition may be different . 
  in any case , good luck . 
  holy fuckballs , 1200 dollars for a kitchen appliance ? 
  how much is it in the us ? 
  if we use a democracy index and mix it with this map it would be pretty obvious that one comparison makes sense and the other is far fetched . 
  of the countries that used capital punishment in the last few years , only five are marked as democratic in some way . 
  of the countries that did n't use it ... about 70 . 
  so let 's guess how fracking and new energy sources will influence the russian economy . 
  i 'm wondering what putin 's long game is because russia does n't have a good long term outlook . 
  so good that my country 's government practically copied it . 
  a lot of hosting companies will migrate your site for free . 
  not just the eu , but the council of europe as well , which is why belarus is the only european country that is n't a member . 
  [ croatia ] ( https://gov.hr ), 
  cuba has been steadily loosening the grip for some time so if it were some other country the us would have relationships with them already . 
  in this case i believe that only the fall of communism and free elections would mean relations with the us . 
  listened to this song 126 times according to my last.fm . 
  love your version . 
  nobody got a handjob in cargo pants since vietnam . 
  i remember when knin was liberated , it will be the 19th anniversary in about a week . 
  my parents and i were driving to the seaside and when they heard on the radio that knin fell they started crying out of joy . 
  i just wanted to know does that mean that the war is over and i wo n't have to go to the air raid shelter anymore . 
  today i 'm sorry for the crimes that happened and the black mark that 's been placed on us , but after every peace plan failed croatia had a full right to secure our internationally recognized borders . 
  i for one am happy not to be in reach of serbian rocket artillery anymore . 
   efficient one carried in the yugoslav wars, 
  your calculator must be wrong as the un recognized less than 400 dead civilians in operation storm . 
  that 's compared to [ over 8000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre ) in srebrenica , [ 5000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_sarajevo ) in sarajevo , [ over 2000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fo%c4%8da_massacres ) in fo\u010da , and around [ 3000 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vi%c5%a1egrad_massacre ) in vi\u0161egrad . 
  so do n't start comparing numbers because one side loses on that count . 
  hell , after storm the un found over 3000 croatian bodies in mass graves in krajina . 
  i 'll stress again , a single dead civilian is a crime , but the blame can never be equal . 
  i understand the appeal but do n't believe it will be big enough in a few years . 
  the watches will get more specialized for sports or fashion but i believe they 'll go the way of the netbook - everyone will make one but it wo n't be a large market . 
  zagreb does n't have a lot of secrets or non-lonely planet stuff , but i 'd recommend just spending time in the center . 
  take a walk up tkal\u010di\u0107eva street , take a beer and beans and sausage stew at mali medo . 
  take a left turn and go to the upper town , visit the museum of broken relationships and just hang around the tiny streets and squares . 
  pass the kamenita vrata when going back down , a lot of history there . 
  everything else depends on your tastes and interests . 
  not a book , but bbc 's death of yugoslavia documentary is pretty good . 
  it 's mostly impartial and has interviews by most major players of that time . 
  i promised a redditor my review something like two years ago and still did n't write it . 
  sorry guy . 
  \u0160ok !, 
  obama has certainly shifted military operations to that direction , using special forces and drones to eliminate groups and individuals . 
  we 're not calling it america 's war in the horn of africa , or the pakistan invasion , but they 're happening and the only time you hear about it is when a drone operator mistakes wedding and training camp . 
  thanks perd . 
  agree za hrenovke , mlinarove su dobre dok su tople ali u dubravici je pecivo mekanije . 
  desktop opera will either be discontinued or just become a slightly fatter version of opera mini/mobile which is the cash cow at this point . 
  yes , but the difference is that our bacon rocks even when not cooked . 
  surprised nobody mentioned the awesome french cartoon about the body , made exactly like this comic . 
  it was popular in europe 20ish years ago . 
  oh and there was sex . 
  can someone comment on the peshmerga 's capabilities ? 
  i know they 're good fighters , motivated and well trained , but could they be the primary fighting force against isil ? 
  with sufficient support , of course . 
  but it was [ 13 years ago ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_uprising_in_herat ) . 
  never looked back . 
  as the other guy said , i rode the same bus a few times , just go to the main bus terminal and buy a cheap ticket , they travel fairly often . 
  when was the last nazi executed , cmon ? 
  a few of them are awaiting trial in my country as well , but i 'm asking about executions , which you mentioned . 
  yugoslavia was n't in the eastern bloc but i feel it 's related to your question . 
  homosexuality was criminalized after wwii and the main issue then was whether the * disorder * was bourgeois and decadent or just human . 
  it was decriminalized in the 70 's when slovenian and croatian medical professionals and intellectuals no longer considered it a mental disorder but remained banned in the rest of yugoslavia except montenegro , vojvodina and the aforementioned croatia and slovenia . 
  most us states , austria , norway and finland decriminalized it at about the same time so that was on par with international developments . 
  more liberal parts of the federation developed gay scenes , magazines , radio shows and associations that dealt with gay rights , although belgrade had a strong gay scene despite the ban in serbia . 
  there were underground night clubs and known meeting places ; gays were harassed as much as other * western imports * such as punk so there were a few moral panics by state controlled media but that was n't the official party stance . 
  rumor has it that some important yugoslav partisans and later politicians were gay , but they were n't prosecuted although an average punishment for homosexual activity in the 50 's was between one and five years in jail . 
  an interesting thing is that there are quite a few popular songs about homosexuality from that time and there was n't much fuss about it .
