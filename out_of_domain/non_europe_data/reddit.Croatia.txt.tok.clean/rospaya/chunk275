  your comment represents the cancer on reddit . 
  the idiocy of today . 
  a worthless bunch of cynical words written by a limited mind . 
  the khmer rouge were far worse than north korea today . 
  i wo n't enlighten you with shit if you do n't see that your comment was just a bunch of cynicism made to show how fucking smart you are , with zero evidence or will to make a good discussion . 
  exaggerated , facetious , know-it-all bunch of shit . 
  discourse worthy of a seven year old , with the exception that idiots upvoted your crap . 
  it 's not even whether you 're right or wrong , just the attitude and lack of intellect are enough evidence . 
  do they have schnitzel burgers there ? 
  yes , but only after a lot of blood has been shed , nato stopped the war after srebrenica and several massacres . 
  anyway , the uk was against independence for yugoslav countries and blocked it within the ec . 
  europe dropped the ball then . 
  i simply do n't buy expensive ebooks . 
  if it 's over 10 dollars , i 'll just read something cheaper . 
  nobody should support the notion that digital books should cost the same as physical . 
  i can tolerate all the guns , but this subreddit has silently edged over to / k / . 
  i shit you not . 
  par gripena na leasing , par kupit . 
  volkswagen , kia and peugeot have plants there . 
  my croatian hometown has a higher gdp per capita than sicily . 
  in a lot of eastern european countries the wealth differences are mostly between cities and rural areas or just the capital and other areas . 
  i ca n't talk for all of them but in croatia the resentments are political or historical , not necessarily financial . 
  why did n't microsoft install a 4g device inside ? 
  i know that the device is dense as it is but a device like that would make it profitable for mobile providers and give them infrastructure to sell it all over the world . 
  too bad . 
  switzerland is about as peaceful as most eu countries and has a large percentage of non native population so there 's that . 
  the eu got pissed because they also wanted to limit immigration from some eu members . 
  [ even got a hockey rink at one point ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/multimedia/archive/00520/arena_pula_520074s1.jpg ), 
  the whole status quo tour was canceled .

  did the same thing to a parked car once . 
  promise it 's not a national sport . 
  i request a mini series about the whole ordeal . 
  this is pretty standard for any `` unlimited '' hosting - it is unlimited unless you abuse it and screw it up for others . 
  which is fair . 
  here 's my vote for that .

  there 's a great story about the old sim city that got its own fix in something like windows 95 . 
  you know he did n't write it or had anything to do with the joke be he fucking sells it so well .

  that 's mostly a prison for small sentences and used during trials .

  much brave ovaj autor , wow journalism !, 
  try a third of that . 
   igrica, 
  * sigh *, 
  you are ignoring the fact that arguably all eastern european countries wanted to join nato to protect them from russia . 
   police in england and wales went two years without fatally shooting someone, 
  insughtful comment , thank you for your contribution . 
  google confirms it is , but still is n't a village .

  shit or get off the pot . 
  i 'm more of a federalist but the eu is currently stuck between being a powerful central government and an impotent international organization . 
  this is fine for consumer rights , but shitty for foreign policy and other big questions . 
  either do it good or go away . 
  that 's an extremely simplistic way of looking at it . 
  it 's widely considered propaganda . 
  watch bbc 's death of yugoslavia . 
  yugoslavia shot down us planes in the late 40 's and prepared for a soviet invasion in the 50 's . 
  thousands of yugoslavs worked in west germany , visited trieste and graz on weekends and freely traveled across the world . 
  it was one of the rare passports that gave entrance into both east and west . 
  the border presence you 're talking about is the justified fear of invasion and sabotage , yugoslavia had a large and strong army . 
  the cookie warning is implemented wrong but consumers have the right to know when files are placed on their devices . 
  i 'm not knowledgeable about the vacuum issue but welcome trimming down excessive energy use . 
  [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/depthhub/comments/2e9nkt/uauandi_discusses_the_demise_of_streetcars_in/cjxjj7u ) said it better than me . 
  i live in a town with one of the biggest tram networks in europe and feel that difference every day . 
  win win . 
  as a baby . 
  but my ( middle class , non-party-member ) family traveled through most of west and central europe as well as israel and the us using the [ red passport ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_passport ) . 
  of course it had , a lot of countries still have it today . 
  that 's not the definition of being free to leave - anyone could get a password and go wherever they wanted , that 's the definition . 
  a group of nationalist terrorists infiltrated the country from austria and caused mayhem . 
  yugoslavia was right to have armed borders towards every side . 
  eastern european countries are safer than most if not all us cities . 
  dude . 
  armed men on the border does not equal police state . 
  vienna is probably the best led city in the world .

  i thought so too until i met the man . 
  he was an ass in public and arrogant during an interview but when relaxed and off the record he 's somewhat smart , has a clever way of talking and understands exactly where he belongs in the world . 
  14 out of 200 + countries in the world recognize crimea as russian , it 's safe to say that this is n't bias but reality . 
  kreditna ? 
  any line * doctor * spaceman says . 
  the wiki page does n't say that it 's widely available in europe . 
  attacking ships on sea is serious business , the rebels do n't have that kind of hardware . 
  they want the black sea for themselves . 
  they did . 
  croatia donated a shit ton of old yugo ak variants . 
  this is actually true - tobacco advertising does n't work because people are too loyal to a brand and everyone is spending because their competitors are . 
  basically if you do n't start smoking by your mid 20 's , you probably never will .
