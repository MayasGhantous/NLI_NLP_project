  my grandma was born where her living room is right now and lived in four countries . 
  the address stayed the same . 
  kudos to your brother for the faith .

  millions of people are still playing the games and enjoying them but the system was flawed and there was no innovation .

  pi\u0161e `` you are now leaving the eu '' . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.theonion.com/articles/bush-our-long-national-nightmare-of-peace-and-pros,464/ ) is n't exactly analysis but it 's satire that hits home , especially since it was written in january of 2001 . 
   during the 40-minute speech , bush also promised to bring an end to the severe war drought that plagued the nation under clinton , assuring citizens that the u.s. will engage in ** at least one ** gulf war-level armed conflict in the next four years . 
  emphasis mine . 
  this summer is one of the shittiest in recent memory so i 'm not sure . 
  nobody knows . 
  if the referendum passes things like this would be sorted until scotland declares independence which could be in a year or so . 
  even then i would guess that scotland would piggybacking on the ruk for some time at least for defence . 
  they declared that nato is their goal so i would guess dedicating some units for light peacekeeping and the rest for maritime sar and surveillance of the north sea . 
  interesting indeed . 
  usrana zemljica od 4,5 milja ljudi na periferiji europe , u tradicionalno \u0161ugavoj regiji ?

  the us did n't bomb it , serbs mined it when retreating during the war . 
  it was n't that top secret since thousands of people served there , today it 's well know and you can visit . 
  : blush :, 
  sounds like the rat monologue from inglourious basterds . 
  yup , just read about that . 
  i was under the impression it would be around midnight . 
  thanks . 
  a few european countries said they had no idea they were part of any coalition . 
  the village of beli . 
  which means that it still fell and destroyed something . 
  [ this chart ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_bombing_during_world_war_ii#the_british_later_in_the_war ) shows the percentages . 
  you are very wrong . 
  about 1/4 of the population are immigrants , the city is wealthy and tops most rankings on quality of life . 
  it 's currently ran by social democrats and the greens . 
  it 's one of the best places to live in europe . 
  you said the vast majority of bombings did n't have drastic effects . 
  half of the city wiped out is drastic as hell . 
  even 30 % would mean that transportation , utilities , housing and healthcare become almost impossible .

  or subsidised by other activities . 
  in any case the map and title are very clear . 
  about croatia . 
  it 's free if you 're a good student , and around a thousand euros max if you 're on the lower end , depending on your ects 's . 
  disadvantaged social groups have discounts and waivers . 
  i 'm a huge fan of the movie/comic and waited for weeks to see it in the cinemas . 
  in the end the local distributor dropped it because they were sure it was n't going to make any money .

  a lot of music industry people can . 
  was it on rab ? 
  the first nudist beach was opened there for edward viii and his lady friend . 
  something like a million tourists that come to croatia every year are nudists . 
  biograd surely . 
  beograd would love that . 
  this is normal practice around the world , the state pays for your education and then you work for them for a few years or pay it all back .

  the trailer did n't show anything and eastwood , personal beliefs aside , managed war movies well in the past .

  are we expecting a new green revolution ? 
  i 'm very disappointed by the tour . 
  practically a tour of the uk with a few other dates thrown in . 
  i 'm totally for legalization or at least decriminalization for now , but the stance some people have is almost childish . 
  it 's like legalization is the silver bullet that would solve crime , housing , debt and loud people in the cinema .
