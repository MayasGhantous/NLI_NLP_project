  buzzfeed is a perfect sign of our times . 
  they produce excellent journalism but people trashing them for shitty lists did n't invest the time to know about it . 
  those lists make the money so they can write stuff like this :, 
  it 's exclusively your fault for ignoring the good parts and focusing on the bad . 
  it 's not comparable , buzzfeed finances one half with the other and it 's a website that relies on shares and clicks . 
  the new yorker relies on magazine circulation . 
  original joke ** and ** funny !, 
  in what way does this negate the great work they do ? 
  oh man flying in europe is so cheap that it 's beautiful . 
  there 's zero glamour about the low cost airlines but most flights are less than three hours and nobody cares about less legroom because the it costs less than a trip to the airport .

  with smaller bills you either do n't tip or just round up the number .

  opinion is divided in ex-yugoslav republics but emigration hates him almost universally . 
  many saw yugoslavia as an unnatural country made to subjugate south slavic peoples and there 's was a civil war during wwii so the losing side was n't too keen to stay .

  there 's a direct croatia airlines flight from athens to dubrovnik . 
   eliminacija automobila ima i pozitivne i negativne strane , definitivno nije win win . 
  npr . 
  croatia has less tourist arrivals than in 1989 . 
  beautiful yes , but if it has 50 thousand people and an international airport , it 's not a village . 
  * international airport * is hint towards its size and importance , not just the fact that it serves flights to other countries . 
  it has the largest runway in the region and is used by more than a million people every year . 
  my main point is that anyone who 's been to dubrovnik can testify that it 's not a village and the pictures you see of it are just the old town . 
  i would n't want to generalize anything about other croats . 
  the population has less and less in common . 
  i 'm pirating it right now . 
  first , it is n't available in my country but i used a vpn to rent it on youtube .

  take a look at lenovo ( ex ibm ) thinkpads . 
  they 're very durable and even refurbished models would serve you great as the whole series is made to be a workhorse , however ugly some might find them . 
  excellent live , very fun and energetic but listening to celebration rock today makes me cringe a bit . 
  the songs are just empty `` we 're young , let 's party '' quasi anthems that have n't grown a lot . 
  i 've got that but the songs really did n't age well . 
  the hold steady is a good example of a band who made youthful party songs that are still relevant and probably will be for a long time . 
  does it have to better or just different ?
