  i never started smoking and i feel like shit !, 
  with a fucked up femur ? 
  reddit is censoring atheists !, 
  conde nast is financing hitler !, 
  i was referring to the `` man '' part . 
  is op a pussy because he has a broken bone and tries to evade someone who fucked him in the first place ? 
  - i got hit in the head on a prodigy show by a guy that looks oddly like [ this ] ( http://www.fukhouse.ca/tflyer.jpg ) . 
  he was stoned out of his head and helped me get up , kissed me where he hit me and got back to jumping like an idiot . 
  i 'm a tall guy , but he was huge and looked like he eats kids . 
  the kiss was kinda unexpected . 
  - me and a friend were tipping the third friend 's portapotty on a sonic youth concert on a festival a couple of years back . 
  he 's a huge guy , shy and keeps to himself . 
  he stormed out of it and started chasing me in the rainstorm and tackled me after 20 seconds , in a puddle . 
  he left his pants in the wc . 
  - at a local rock concert a bald chick was constantly trying to crowdsurf , even though nobody in the audience cared about it . 
  she used the fact that security wo n't kick her ass and jumped into the crowd a couple of times , from a fence at the front . 
  at first people grabbed her because she would get seriously hurt , but after 4-5 tries , everybody just stepped away from her . 
  she hit the floor flat , just got up and danced . 
  i actually stopped for a second after i wrote wc . 
  is n't it an international word ? 
  holy shit , / r/atheism has gone bonkers . 
  this is not a conspiracy , this is just the will of hundreds of user who have said that this subreddit is a disgrace . 
  this is just an anti religion circlejerk with the same fucking thing over and over . 
  i 'm an atheist , and used to be a militant one like most people here , but these days i just do n't care about dumb people . 
  but still , i ca n't stand watching the same shit day after day . 
  and now , you and others are looking for a boycott , crying censorship , blaming christians even for this ? 
  i wrote the same thing yesterday and got downvoted into oblivion . 
  does anybody have some info on ups and downs on this comment ? 
  he had a great story about new york , how it 's totally different from the rest of us . 
  same thing with less words and more insulting . 
  i use opera which supports this scripts but uses too much cpu . 
  why ? 
  you have a problem with an atheist thinking different then you ? 
  if i did n't say i 'm an atheist you would use the `` butthurt christian '' argument , like you did a couple of times in this thread . 
  how ... ** how ** did you get to that dumb conclusion ? 
  i already wrote on reddit how i become one , although i did n't write how atheists started throwing it in other peoples faces like it 's a religion . 
  i have n't believed in a god for 15 years and no `` but '' can change that . 
  my conclusion is you are nuts , since i have n't talket about my atheism here , only that i 'm not a militant one - meaning - i 'm not an evangelist like everybody here is . 
  oh , now i get it , you 're just a troll . 
  sorry i tried . 
  i for one agree with you and think / r/atheism is too militant to be on the front page . 
  but , this could have been done better , right now half of reddit is crying `` censorship '' and the other one does n't like it but does n't like / r/atheism , too . 
  upvoted just for the quote . 
  same thing , but in zagreb . 
  show on the picture where he touched you ... kidding , you 're cute . 
  did you all have a problem talking about it ? 
  did you just sit and watched tv and someone said `` gee , i sure would like to get laid * wink wink * '', 
  or was the subject off limits ? 
  as a croat , and having met a few ssam developers , i almost wet my pants . 
  well , you 're hardly alone in this hobby . 
  i 've been sleeping on the floor for the last month or so , just put the mattress on the floor and slept there . 
  my bed is too small and this is a temporary thing , until i buy a new one . 
  in the end it just feels too good . 
  screw you and everybody else trying to make this into a religious/atheist thing . 
  spez wrote , very politely , that / r/atheism has become a raging circlejerk of posts that have nothing to do with rational thought , but more with dumb and empty bashing on religious people , ridden with insults . 
  reddit managment did n't get to this alone , plenty of people were against such a subreddit . 
  not atheism , but / r/atheism . 
  well for one , i am an atheist , and hundreds of others like me petitioned reddit to remove / r/atheism from the front page . 
  not by these downvotes ( i do n't know what that was ) , but with polite comments , unlike the ones i see here these days . 
  nobody normal has anything against atheism , but against the posts and comments that have nothing to do with rational thought , but with senseless bashing on all religions . 
  you all started acting like the people you are fighting against . 
  get it in your thick skulls , atheism is not being censored here . 
  ok , one question that * really * interests me . 
  none of my female friends ever confessed about masturbating , and i believe 90 % of them actually do n't do it . 
  why is that ? 
  please elaborate as long as you need , i 'm very interested in this . 
  oh i 'm sorry , i must have got this wrong . 
  reddit is deleting posts from / r/atheism ? 
  reddit is deleting comments from / r/atheism ? 
  reddit is denying people to subscribe to / r/atheism ? 
  no , reddit just moved it out of the default subreddits . 
  freedom of speech and human progress ? 
  you are talking out of your ass for something so banal and simple . 
  no one is losing any rights here . 
  as a heterosexual male iggy pop fan ... 
  i 'm kinda disappointed he does n't do that anymore . 
  speaking of sodas , [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/jt26y.gif ) is very interesting . 
  in europe , we just call them by their name , a cola ( coca cola ) , a pepsi or whatever . 
  but then again , drinks like this are not popular here as the us . 
  reddit , i am disappoint . 
  i was waiting for : for the union !, 
  please , for the love of everything that is sacred , say to me you are not kidding . 
   and they will mercillessly silence any dissent or questioning no matter how polite , valid or poignant it may be , regardless of your religious standing . 
  [ no ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9efxf/an_explanation_of_why_the_atheism_reddit_does_not/c0cgegs ) , you 're [ talking ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9efxf/an_explanation_of_why_the_atheism_reddit_does_not/c0cga7r ) nonsense . 
  this is plain wrong . 
  croatia does n't have more than 2 % of jews and muslims * combined * , and is put in the 20-80 % level . 
  i wrote almost a year ago that nokia will use maemo in its high level smartphones , and almost everyone and the so called experts said i 'm wrong . 
  well in your face mom !, 
  you, 
  dirty, 
  spammer . 
  this has `` epic '' written all over it . 
  i [ wrote ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/8w15h/male_redditors_what_would_you_do_if_a_woman_hit/ ) about a similar subject a while ago . 
  also , i remembered a situation in elementary when a girl hit me in the balls , football style . 
  it was just one of those `` i 'm a bitch , girrrl power ! '', 
  power trips . 
  i hit her back in the groins , the same way she did me , but not that hard , because i was just proving a point , not trying to hurt her . 
  needless to say , i was the resident satan a couple of weeks . 
  i got ta admit i have n't heard about a cut christian in the balkans . 
  but it was probably customary in muslim parts of bih .
