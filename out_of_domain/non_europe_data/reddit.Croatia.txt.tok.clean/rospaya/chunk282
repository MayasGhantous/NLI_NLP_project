  at this point i 'm not sure we can call china communist without a lot of disclaimers . 
  their gini coefficient is along the lines of the uk and japan , two very capitalist countries .

  there are specific ip 's to be used in shows like this . 
  also , quit yer bitching . 
  any show about hacking ever just had a massive button called `` hack the planet '' in it so this is an extremely small issue with a show that is ( so far ) intelligent about the way computers work . 
  three seasons out and i still remember the garage scene best . 
  i believe you got two issues mixed up , the old `` first field white or red '' debate on the croatian coat of arms and the general unease about using croatian symbols . 
  but let 's go from the top :, 
  nationalism was always the greatest issue in yugoslavia and when the situation in the country started firing up in the early 90s , the individual republics ( primarily slovenia and croatia ) first got wider autonomy from the central party and then had democratic elections and the declarations of independence were considered as part breakup/evolution from yugoslavia and part renewal of earlier independence . 
  the preamble for the croatian constitution of 1990 listed a dozen historical basis for independence and notably one of them was the socialist republic of croatia ( aka yugoslavia ) and the wwii era antifascist council 's decisions * opposite * the usta\u0161e , which still stands today . 
  in light of all the historical reasons , many features of the `` new '' country were derived from old symbols and the coat of arms was n't an exception . 
  here we come to what i believe is your confusion . 
  a ) there 's still a big debate about the coat of arms and to sum it up some people believe the first field should be white and others believe it should be red . 
  as you can see [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_croatia#gallery ) historically it 's been both since the 15th century and the difference is mainly political , with the right wing thinking it should be white and local serbs thinking it 's too close to the usta\u0161e you mentioned . 
  note that it was used in yugoslavia as well so as a symbol it was n't controversial until politics came in . 
  b ) franjo tu\u0111man believed that after nazism and communism the `` new '' croatia could finally be united and to appease the right wing of the ruling party he used dubious iconography and alluded to the old nazi puppet regime . 
  this naturally frightened the local serbs and milo\u0161evi\u0107 's propaganda machine used it to great effect to mobilize them and use for his own purpose . 
  it 's still a very heated subject in both croatia and serbia with tu\u0111man himself expressing regret for using such terms . 
  now that this is cleared up :, 
   why did tu\u0111man and his cohorts insist on this symbol ? 
  it was a legitimate symbol of the country , but tu\u0111man used radical nationalism as a tool to unite the country before what he saw as an inevitable war . 
  the jury is still out on his role in starting it , but he certainly did n't stop it . 
   did tu\u0111man et al knowingly provoke the serbs within their borders ? 
  yes , but more with speeches and laws than symbols like the coat of arms . 
   why is this symbol still used today on the croatian national flag ? 
  again , it 's a legitimate symbol of a country so the nazi comparison does n't stand . 
   furthermore , what did josip broz tito think of this symbol ? 
  i have n't found any information but since nationalism was suppressed in yugoslavia , all national symbols were sparsely used . 
  in the end , the red-white checkboard was the official coat of arms of socialist croatia and as such was used in formal occasions , much like the corresponding serbian national coat of arms . 
  tu\u0111man 's idea of a national reconciliation was unsuccessful later but managed to unite the country during the war . 
  he was really in a specific position to do that since he had both left and right wing credentials as a partisan in wwii and jugoslav army general and later croatian dissident . 
  the full coat of arms used today , with the crown , is considered by professionals to be kitsch and historically incorrect . 
  but tu\u0111man liked the grandiosity . 
  ignore other responses , this is true . 
  ljubljana is a nice city but i have to defend my hometown as zagreb is a beautiful place at that time . 
  you have numerous concerts , festival , street events and cultural happenings during that time . 
  there 's a stage on evey other square and the streets are bustling with activities . 
  zagreb 's three times more populous than ljubljana but still very manageble on foot or with trams . 
  if you 're into nature , zagreb has three major parks in the city itself , jarun is a big comples with beaches and lots of sport activities while bundek is more about walking , biking or barbecuing . 
  maksimir is a park with forests , lakes and a zoo . 
  here 's a good video about what 's zagreb about . 
  if you have any questions let me know or feel free to ask on / r/croatia . 
  i 'm sure most people here would object to / u/crnaruka being a mod as well , but some feel the need to stand by him for nationalist reasons . 
  no , he made very nasty statements . 
  it 's really bad . 
   these croatian/albanian/bosniak clowns act holier-than-thou when in reality they 're just as nationalistic as he is . 
  i do n't understand the need to force a false equivalency ? 
  i invite you to visit / r/croatia and find nationalistic comments made in the same way / u/crnaruka 's were made . 
  you wo n't , because most of us are liberal pussies , and most flat out say that they do n't care about croatia . 
   i really do n't want to get in an argument with you, 
  because you are wrong . 
  i dare you to find a an / r/croatia mod who praised tu\u0111man , paveli\u0107 or other war criminals . 
  / r/croatia fights nationalism and right-wing ideology every single day and your false equivalency is just a cheap way of saying that you 're wrong but ca n't admit it . 
  much like some other nationalist in that thread . 
  there are currently five posts on the front page of / r/croatia mocking croatian veterans . 
  kakav ti je limit ? 
  buzzfeed produces a lot of quality content but people never bother to read it . 
  which is telling more about the public than buzzfeed . 
  the balkans produce more history than they can consume . 
  churchill . 
  which part of this is n't true ? 
  nobody is denying the atrocities committed by the usta\u0161e , but 500k at jasenovac is a bloated figure , much like the zillions killed at bleiburg . 
  imo it does n't matter , a crime is a crime . 
   croatia mod u/badblueboy146 `` they [ gotovina and markac ] saved many lives with what they did in 1995 . 
  they banished aggressors from our country . 
  they are peacemakers , therefore they are heroes . '', 
  not that i agree with this one , but gotovina and marka\u010d were pronounced not guilty by an international court . 
  this is the moment where you say that it 's a us conspiracy . 
  cruel , but just an opinion . 
  first party is painfully true . 
  so , i 'm still waiting the part where paveli\u0107 , tu\u0111man or other war criminals are praised . 
  where nationalists posts fill / r/croatia up . 
  go , click the link and show me . 
  show me where something like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/13akz1/ne_veselim_se/ ) was the most upvoted post in / r/serbia . 
  i believe public showings are illegal . 
  most have it , at least in europe . 
  it 's the minority that does n't .

  there were a lot of british troops stationed in kosovo and bosnia , but most of them in peacekeeping and protecting .
