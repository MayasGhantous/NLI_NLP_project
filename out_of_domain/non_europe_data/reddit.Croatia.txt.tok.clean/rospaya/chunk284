  leaving for barcelona in a week . 
  as a city geek i ca n't wait . 
  is there anything specific you 're worried about ? 
  better known as zadar in today 's croatia . 
  coincidentally i 'm on a bus right now , half an hour to the same city . 
  which part of this is ironic ? 
  lenovo yoga 13 '' with an i5 cpu , dual booting windows 8.1 and ubuntu with a bunch of pentesting tools . 
  raspberry pi last gen with kodi and raspbian , old lenovo u410 waiting to become a home server and an hp mini first gen with lubuntu . 
  what are the other differences with 7.0 ?

  i just came back from barcelona -- it 's wonderful and i have n't felt unwelcomed for a second . 
  just do n't be the typical tourist that never leaves la rambla or the barceloneta .

  is there any solid proof smedley butler was right ? 
  that it was an actual coup and not a few rich guys after dinner ? 
  people do n't generally understand what the games are for . 
  barcelona was a postindustrial city before 1992 and the olympics boosted infrastructure , quality of life and made it one of the most visited places in europe . 
  a few billion over budget is nothing compared to all the advances the city made because of the games . 
  london got massive funds to redevelop massive parts of east london , which would n't happen without the olympics . 
  it did n't need to reinvent itself like some cities , but it was always about rebuilding and infrastructure . 
  i 'm skeptical .

  excellent essay about the subject, 
   i am not sure if you can buy a ticket online, 
  www.akz.hr you can buy a ticket without any problems . 
   things such as `` seat tickets '' just do not exist . 
  seats are not numbered, 
  depends on the bus and people in it .

  and how many from radio listens per person ? 
  if new technologies have to be compared to old ones , streaming would be nearest to a radio i believe . 
  what do the videos prove exactly ? 
  that a bunch of people who risked death during weeks of grueling travel do n't want to be detained anywhere or just your point of view that they 're merely criminals in standby ? 
  what 's the economic situation like ? 
  do people believe in renzi 's reforms ? 
  love the shop !, 
  it says that regular shipping is n't available for croatia but the shipping is calculated at 4 gbp , is that ups or normal ? 
  yes .

  the uk has always been the odd man out in the community/union , the most dissident member that is still considered a us agent on the continent by a lot of countries . 
  a potential brexit would ( on the long term ) make the eu stronger , with a cemented german led position , something that the uk never seriously tried to jeopardize within the organization .

  from your comments it sounds like you need an ssd vps with a good sysadmin who can optimize it for you . 
  a dedicated server sounds like an overkill for a small site . 
   policies which tax entrepreneurs and working people and give money to parasites are popular . 
  you 're being facetious , that trend has severely changed in the last few years .

  an ssd is worth the money in my opinion and is a nice way to speed things while only sacrificing money ( not a lot of it ) and space ( which you do n't need ) . 
  a vps can easily be more powerful than a dedicated server , depending on what you get . 
  if i got this correct - you have a small wordpress site with 4-5k unique visitors which can sometimes spike ? 
  i 've seen much much larger sites run on vps 's . 
  depending on some of the details i 'd recommend an ssd vps with 4 vcpu 's , minimum 4 gb ram . 
  litespeed + tmpfs + caching . 
  maybe nginx + varnish . 
  definitely a cdn like cloudflare for the peaks .
