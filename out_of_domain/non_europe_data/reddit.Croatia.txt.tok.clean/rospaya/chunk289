  as for questions ... not sure , what do dicks taste like ? 
  are there tastes like ice cream ? 
  with a survey rate of 900 dicks there must be some patterns . 
  some countries have laws against this , only a certain amount of ads can be aired in an hour , and ca n't disrupt programs of a certain lenght . 
  in my country that means shows under 30 minutes ca n't have ads . 
  dutch disease . 
  in ex-yugoslavia 's case it 's more religious than ideological . 
  yugoslavia decriminalized gay relations earlier than some western countries and was generally on a liberalization path and it simply was n't an issue . 
  then the wars came . 
  the balkans produce more history than they can consume .

  oh wait , to nisu bili studenti , to su bili odrasli ljudi , ne \u0161a\u010dica njih i ne pijani . 
  i have a cheapo homelab with my old laptops that have solid specs but got their screens broken or some other problem that rendered them unportable . 
  they 're quiet , take up little space and power and after some ram and ssd upgrades they 're usable for a lot of stuff . 
  cpu is the bottleneck but i can use them for testing stuff without any problems . 
  it 's a lab , not really a home server . 
   gas is pretty much non-existent in norway, 
  except , you know , the one you 're getting filthy rich on ? 
  rocket je koma . 
  to se vidi u prometu , businessu , na cesti . 
  in former yugoslavia the place where you served made a big difference . 
  in some places you 'd be surrounded by conscripts who were from very rural areas and were learning how to read and write . 
  in others it could be cushy and productive , but since yugoslavia made a big deal about the jna in most places it was fine , nowhere near what op is describing in the ussr . 
   he never ate a single bean since then, 
  i can confirm this , bean stew was so common everywhere that a lot of former conscripts avoided it for years . 
  they already saw stuff at google that they had to drop from the script because it would be over the top for the show . 
  great article about it here, 
  europeans , where did you buy your zero ? 
  shipping is too often expensive . 
  they had excellent political coverage forever and started making great longform stories a year or two back . 
  they make money on the lists to make stories like these . 
  most people do n't care enough to find them .

  featured on the poster , [ ban jelacic statue from zagreb ] ( http://www.zagrebplaces.com/galleries/places/040412-banjelacicstatue1m.vrdoljak.jpg ), 
  just to make it clear i 'm not the artist and unfortunately i 'm not sure who is . 
  this was posted to the event 's facebook page and it got to the band who greenlit a limited sale .

  edit :,

  as others have said , bonbon is a mobile operator so if you have a sim card that says bonbon , it 's a prepaid deal where you need to buy credit in a store or kiosk like tisak . 
  ** additionally and what everyone else forgot to mention **, 
  `` bon '' is also the generic name of the credit . 
  you buy a 50 , 100 or 200 kuna ** bon ** that you add to your account , be it t-mobile , vipnet or bonbon . 
  although i do recommend bonbon . 
   i have to take care of this before i even get an apartment since the only landlords on njuskalo.hr that respond are the ones you call apparently, 
  correct , do n't rely on messages there . 
  lgbt prava ? 
  ekonomija ? 
  looks like the la school of urban planning . 
   i agree about zagreb . 
  we only spent one evening there then left for plitvice lakes early the next morning , after hearing older trip reviews saying that there was n't much to see . 
  zagreb became a tourist destination only in the last few years so a lot of the old reviews and advice is n't very useful now . 
  it 's packed full of museums , cafes , festivals and other events so there 's definitely stuff to do now . 
   zagreb in the summer , especially august , is pretty empty though . 
  most croatians have gone to summer houses , to the coast , or home ( if they 're not locals ) so it 's a lot less crowded . 
  yup . 
  i 'm one of them . 
  in the middle of august it 's quite empty , but it 's certainly getting better every year , mostly because of tourism .

  funny you should say that . 
  she got cut on the left side of her face as a child and has a visible scar there .

  some of those are n't necessarily good . 
  direct democracy is a hit and miss , and switzerlands decentralization and referendums are a good example - voting rights for women in some cantons were established as late as the 1990 's . 
  it was n't quite serbia , was it ? 
  if you count web users i bet fb messenger wins almost everyehere . 
  yeah but that was n't serbia , at least after 1941 , when the south slav state no longer had a serbian monarch in charge . 
   haha kralju , to je to !, 
  we got a badass over here . 
  an ultimate badass !,

  no , the worst .

  as someone who lived during the * wars * ( plural ) milosevic started , i 'm amazed how easily some westerners think they can understand or discuss the atrocities that happened during the 90s in the balkans . 
  10 thousand albanian civilians dead in kosovo [ 1 ] ( http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-war-victims-list-published ), 
  almost 10 thousand dead civilians in croatia [ 2 ] ( http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/5511/1/hoare-m-5511.pdf ), 
  35 thousand non-serbian civilians dead in bosnia and herzegovina [ 3 ] ( https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=idmhdgcjce0c&amp;lpg=pa140&amp;ots=1hayxweq1v&amp;dq=86039%2b9901&amp;pg=pa140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ), 
  serbian civilians ( approx 8 thousand ) and hundreds of thousands of displaced people from all of the wars not mentioned here , but they are all the result of milosevic 's politics and warmongering . 
  these are all low ball figures . 
  keep in mind that the human rights watch put serbian deaths during the bombing of yugoslavia in 1999 at 500 . 
  here are your numbers . 
  i can make one for my system , but it 's fairly hard to make it for * any other * system . 
  yeah that was hulu , but it never realized its full potential .
