  mockumentary . 
  it 's not real . 
   nato should have immediately moved to the background and money should have poured into civilian institutions to fill the power vacuum and stabilize the former soviet republics . 
  unfortunately , the west took the easy way out , and just relied on the existing nato bureaucracy to do that, 
  ummm ... 
  massive amounts of investments and money were funneled into eastern european countries to build democratic institutions , mostly with good results . 
  for example : slovakia was n't admitted into nato in 1999 when poland , hungary and czech republic were exactly because of its undemocratic government and the first countries to actually border russia got accepted into nato in 2004 , 14 years after the soviet union fell . 
  they all * wanted * to join nato/eu , and denying them the chance would be seen as finlandization . 
   i mean , you had this begin back when clinton went full-retard in yugoslavia in the 90s, 
  feel free to ask the population of bosnia , croatia , kosovo , slovenia and albania what they think of the `` full retard '' move . 
  milosevic started several wars and instigated mass war crimes in every one of them except the 10 day war in slovenia . 
  as tragic as any bombing is , the 1999 bombing of yugoslavia was fairly limited and helped topple a genocidal dictator . 
  same here .

   p.s. 
   but also the fact that you lived through one of the last serious wars in europe . 
  eastern ukraine says hello . 
  you 're probably confusing several wars that happened in former yugoslavia during the 90 's , because more people died in ukraine and it lasted way longer than the 1999 bombing campaign . 
  other times nato intervened in former yugoslavia was in 1994/1995 in bosnia . 
  can someone explain the reasoning behind it and potential alternatives ?
