  you want to listen to socially conscious political punk , but you 're not that angry .

  the belgian post might be fulfilled by the swedish ambassador to the eu . 
   oh yes im german i love that shit !, 
  i 've seen a few weird 70s videos on some obscure websites that can confirm this . 
  it was n't run great , but * leave * was so easy to run it could 've won on autopilot . 
  you did n't have 40 years of mass market newspapers having front page titles about an eu trade deal , act , commission that made a good but not easily measurable difference for the uk . 
  that 's not sexy . 
  goose stomping eurocrats measuring bananas , chemicals spreading cancer , pumping 350 million a week from the nhs ( a precise number with a precise loved domestic institution ) , that 's gon na keep your blood flowing . 
  the eu always had an image as an elitist institution and even a fan of it like me could n't pull out huge sexy facts like the anti-eu people can - despite some of it being lies . 
  and most of the press printed the easily digested populist headlines for 40 years . 
  losing with 48 % - considering a dispirited campaign , lack of enthusiasm in the media , decades of bad propaganda , ugly political faces , and facing complete lies - is downright lucky . 
  tako i na balkanu .

   the norms of standard written english are maintained purely by the consensus of educated english-speakers around the world , without any oversight by any government or international organisation . 
  buzzfeed has a great news site and investigative team , but that 's the stuff you need to actually look for , while most people really want both stupid quizzes and bitching about stupid quizzes . 
  those tactics are here to bring in money so they can finance their great news and investigative teams . 
  but people do n't click on that . 
  no , but elb might . 
  any source on croatia ? 
  odrasti . 
  love the croatian flag . 
  we just let the dutch do their own and then add the coat of arms . 
  umm , croatia has a blue passport and we have no plans to change it . 
  tnx . 
  also , this would n't work everywhere . 
  where i live , talking to strangers while waiting for a train is weird . 
  any specific trick for downloading udemy videos ? 
  if it matters , paul greengrass is english . 
  in some places in europe that 's completely normal . 
  you go shopping somewhere that has better stores and cheaper prices .

  dubrovnik is n't croatia during the summer . 
  it 's a tourist enclave . 
  outside of super touristy places beer is around two euros in a bar . 
  that 's half liter . 
  * very * emotional , it 's downright depressive at times . 
  still one of the best museums i 've seen . 
   if you go to zagreb in late june or early july ( maybe other times , too , but this is what i know ) , it will be abandoned . 
  locals will be off on the coast or elsewhere for summer . 
  that used to be the case . 
  i rode my bike across town without seeing a single person during a very hot day in august . 
  these days there are more tourists and more stuff to do so it 's not that empty anymore . 
  great story about coachella , peppered with some behind the scenes stories ya 'll might find interesting . 
  nasa granica je na soci !, 
  any tips on getting there from amsterdam ? 
   kontinentalci nam zavide,

  because they are peace loving means being well armed , supplier independent and ready to defend your `` neutrality '' . 
  in eastern europe a lot of sports teams were associated with local companies or just had industrial roots so every town has either a dynamo or lokomotiv and it stayed that way . 
  sports are more serious than in the us if you ask me . 
  moving stadiums in the same city might be sacriligious , not to mention things like `` moving the franchise '' or changing names .
