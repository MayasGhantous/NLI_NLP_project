  i 'm a sucker for terrorist or political movies , and i 'm looking for something similar to the siege , sum of all fears , the kingdom , rendition ... also the pelican brief and enemy of the state . 
  i 've watched all tom clancy movies so that 's out . 
  have any recommendations for me ? 
  it seems that most of the movies aabove have a black actor lead . 
  did n't even notice that ), 
  edit : thank you all ** very ** much !, 
  i saw a lot of the movies listed , but the ones i did n't are `` pending '' . 
  i own a victorinox swiss army knife , made for one handed use ( well , at least the main blade ) . 
  here 's a [ link ] ( http://www.amazon.com/victorinox-one-hand-trekker-lockblade-pocket/dp/b000687b44/ref=sr_1_5?ie=utf8&s=home-garden&qid=1252787417&sr=8-5= ), 
  it 's really practical but a little large so i 'll probably get a smaller one . 
  the quality is excellent and really makes everyday life easier . 
  for screwing bolts , cutting things or just stabbing prostitutes , i really recommend it .

  it 's really practical but a little large so i 'll probably get a smaller one to put on my keychain . 
  the quality is excellent and really makes everyday life easier . 
  plus , the main blade is locked when open . 
  for screwing bolts , opening boxes or just stabbing prostitutes , i really recommend it . 
  they 're having a show in my town soon , and i 'm not so familiar with their music . 
  what do you think ?

  [ source ] ( http://aleceiffel.free.fr/misc_homages.html ), 
  for me , it was gorillaz , their first album , in 2001 . 
  i was 12 . 
  i got a shitload of backstreet boys from relatives ( thanks guys ) but this is the first one i bought with intent to keep it for myself . 
  it broke in a pii comp i was using at the time . 
  took the drive with it . 
  before and after that it 's all p2p . 
  since high school finished i was just getting drunk on some days and resting on others . 
  except on a few occassions i did n't do anything and i was extremely lazy , waking up in the afternoon and going to sleep in the morning . 
  do good people of reddit have an idea how could i get back in the loop fast and get my life in order so i can do this ? 
  so , i 'm a first year journalism student and i know english well so i went with that . 
  but the professor is a bitch and it could be a pain to finish it easily . 
  but the french professor is great and it could be a lot easier . 
  and since it 's been my great wish , and i plan to work in diplomacy * and * a certain girl offered to help me ... should i go for it ? 
  i 'm sure i 'd finish english easier than french , but should i do it ? 
  is it hard to learn french ? 
  i speak english , and my native tounge is croatian , while i studied italian and latin it was n't hard so i guess french would n't be , right ? 
  personally , i like both , since there are a lot of news that are not black and white and need some more background or opinions to get the full news . 
  journalism is meant to transfer information , but also get us new theories and insights ... 
  being objective sometimes means adding your own opinion . 
  on the other hand , sometimes i like to be given pure information and make my own opinions . 
  what do you prefer ? 
  hi reddit , i 'm 20 and love the standard reddit movies , music and pop art , yet the only decorations i have on my walls are : old south park poster i got 8 years ago , world map and a sword . 
  i need something new , the walls are too empty and seem cold . 
  any good suggestions ? 
  links are very welcome . 
  my first time was on some new years party with my parents and maybe two glasses of wine ... 
  but i 'm more interested in ` real ' first times , so here goes mine . 
  i was 12 or 13 and bought a couple of beers with my friends ... 3 of us and 9 beers iirc . 
  we got wasted when my parents were n't home and called friends , joked around . 
  nothing special , but the feeling was great . 
  we heard my parents coming home and got rid of the bottles in my school backpack . 
  on monday i stashed them into an old closet in my room . 
  years passed and only when i was 18 or 19 i cleaned my room and found them . 
  got a nostalgia tear and took the bottles to the bottle container in front of my house . 
  i was inspired by [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/a1byd/mtv_erects_wall_to_block_view_of_u2s_free_concert/c0fefxp ) awesome story , so i 'm interested ... did any of you witness a historic event unfolding ? 
  it 's interesting that most of us can answer where we were when 9/11 happened , even if from another country or continent , so i 'm wondering were any of you close to a similar significant event ? 
  i live too far away , but they 're my favourite band , so i 'm wondering , does someone have some experiences to share ? 
  not only from this tour , but the old ones ... 
  i missed their concert in my city some 6 years ago . 
  so , we 're going on a trip there from croatia to surprise his polish girlfriend . 
  the problem is this is the first time that we 're doing a trip like this and have limited experience about it ... also a very tight budget . 
  i 'd appreciate any tips , especially from polish people . 
  ( yes , born to be wild will be played ), 
  my university got blocked today ( croatia ) and it seems that most of them will get blocked these days . 
  i 've heard students in germany are blocking their schools as well . 
  any experiences ? 
  i 'm a huge fan of tenacious d which i would really like to see in my country . 
  there is interest and it is likely that the band will be touring next year . 
  what can i , as just a fan , do to bring them over ? 
  i 'm aware that there 's not much i can do . 
  i 'm thinking of using social networks and other guerilla methods ( flyers , graffiti ... 
  i do n't know ) to get some more attention on my little campaign . 
  any ideas ? 
  anything smart to contribute ? 
  i 'm planning on making one for my girlfriend , she 's a huge fan and would love to have one . 
  the problem is that i never saw one or have any idea how it should look . 
  was it something like [ this ] ( http://www.the-rudy.com/images/fugazi_thisisnot_f.jpg ) ? 
  does anyone have an idea what else to add ? 
  i 'm a guy ritchie fan and i 'm about to see it soon , but i trust reddit more than generic reviews online . 
  althought the country is officially 87 % catholic , we already had an atheist prime minister and an agnostic president . 
  just today we elected [ ivo josipovic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivo_josipovic ) as our third president , who declares himself as an agnostic . 
  does your country have any declared atheist/agnostic politicians on high places , despite the high percentage of religious people ? 
  i fell in love with the htc hero since i saw it , and had a chance to review it for a couple of days . 
  i loved almost everything about it ... 
  except writing stuff . 
  being a nokia e71 user ( and used at least 15 qwerty devices before it ) it 's essential that i can write on it fast and with both or just one hand . 
  the brief experience i had was n't great . 
  i 'm looking at buying the hero , but i 'm wondering , will i get used to the virtual keyboard ? 
  will i write fast and comfortable enough ? 
  any experiences from current owners ? 
  as far as i can see , their official stance is secular , but is the organization christian or based on christian motives ? 
  while reading the [ guy that lives in the hood ama ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/aw8f1/i_am_a_black_man_that_lives_in_the_hood/ ) i was wondering , are you afraid of crime ? 
  do you have an alarm system , multiple locks , a gun ? 
  are you afraid to walk at night ? 
  i live in a central european city of about a million people . 
  never once robbed , mugged , beaten up or had anything but my bike stolen . 
  while it is n't always wise , i can walk any neighbourhood at night , but there are just a couple of them to be worried about .
