  so i 'm interested what was christianity like before ? 
  when did it become this global organisation , what did it lose in the process , what did the councils add , what gospels and other texts are n't officially sanctioned ? 
  let 's hear it . 
  it 's a longshot since i last saw it in my elementary school library around 10 years ago , but here 's what i remember :, 
  - hardcover , probably a4 format, 
  - probably in colour, 
  - it was about the blitzkrieg , but focused on france, 
  - dunkerque ( dunkirk ) evacuation was a big theme , the central one even, 
  edit : i 'm from croatia , so if it was n't translated into croatian , it was probably in english . 
  unfortunately , i do n't remember much , but i would really like to find it again . 
  if anyone has any info , or a better place to ask this question , i would be very thankful . 
  i 'm from croatia and i 'll be there for a week , excluding a short cruise to riga on the last day . 
  i need some advice on what to see and what to do because i 'm thinking a week is plenty of time to see everything i 'd want . 
  - i like history , politics and military stuff ( swedish air force museum is out of hand i 'm afraid ) so is there anything i have to see ? 
  is there a jas-39 model somewhere in town ? 
  armed forces museum ? 
  - walking is prefered , but i 'll have company so i guess the subway is the way to go ? 
  is there something like an oyster card in london or should i buy tickets every time ? 
  - i also love music , pop culture , technology and the millenium trilogy so if there are any locations i should see , please do tell . 
  music of the rock and indie variety , not the abba kind . 
  - is there any food or snack i really have to try ? 
  i 'm used to central european food so go soft on me . 
  beer is also something i 'm fond of . 
  - is it an insult to say bad stuff about abba ? 
  if so , i 'm sorry . 
  - someone told me that most of money transactions are n't in cash , could that be an issue ? 
  because i 'm not sure my cards ( maestro , mastercard , visa electron ) are supported . 
  i 'm thinking putting half on my card and the other half in cash . 
  - as i 'm a journalist , i will be writing an article about it and it education in sweden . 
  something important i should take a look at , since i have a friend that 's studying there so i 'll get most of my info from him . 
  - any other advice you might have for an unsuspecting tourist like myself ? 
  - being an internet junkie , is there a prepaid sim card i can buy to surf the web over 3g ? 
  how much would it cost for ... let 's say 1 gb of traffic ? 
  thanks all .

  most polls ca n't say for sure what the outcome will be , what do you people think ? 
  i 'm in croatia , europe , so i 'd rather send to europe , although the us is n't out of the question , but it takes some time if we do it on the cheap . 
  as some of you may know , cairo , illinois is a town brought to its knees , today mostly abandoned , and recently evacuated because of a flood . 
  a couple of days ago trillian went free and all of the previous pro stuff was suddenly free , but in exchange my chats are now littered with ads to buy the new pro version ( no ads and chats saved in the cloud ) and the software i once loved is now probably going to be exchanged for some other free software that does the same but does n't bother me with ads . 
  i 'm even more pissed because the old pro features that are now regular really do n't mean much for me . 
  anyone else have the same feelings ? 
  i 'm looking to print out a couple of posters , dimensions : 30 x 40 and 40 x 50 cm ( 11,8 x 15,7 in and 15,7 x 19,6 in ) . 
  how big should the picture be so it would look good ? 
  the biggest resolution i 'm trying to print is 2338 x 3500 px , how will that look when it 's printed out ? 
  is there a dpi ratio so i can calculate it myself ? 
  i 'll start :, 
  how does an american change a light bulb ? 
  he holds it under the socket and expects the world to revolve around him . 
  ( technically , it 's the 4th in europe so i 'm a little early ), 
  is there a way to easily and quickly transfer my open pages to my ( android ) phone ? 
  something like what firefox does ? 
  yesterday i did n't realize that shrinking a volume using windows 7 partitioning tools would format both new partitions and now i 've got a 14 gb partition , never used and 95 gb of free space , not formatted . 
  those two used to be one . 
  is there any way to get the data back ? 
  at least get the list of lost files ? 
  anything ? 
  looking over wikipedia articles about the candidates ( and even skimming [ conservapedia ] ( http://conservapedia.com/presidential_election_2012 ) , funny as hell ) it looks like john huntsman is the most sane candidate gop is offering . 
  anyone else want to share some insight ? 
  who has the biggest chance ? 
  who is the most sane ? 
  i 've been searching for the lyrics , but a lot of songs have them . 
  it starts with `` you 'll never know how much i miss you '' and then a guitar strumms . 
  then it countinues but i have no idea how it goes later . 
  the genre is maybe old rock n roll , early garage . 
  i 'm planning on buying a few preowned games from game.co.uk , and i 'm wondering do you guys have a recommendation on something fun to play with a friend ? 
  we mostly play zombie mode in cod : bo so something like that would be fine . 
  edit : i forgot to explain . 
  on ** one ** xbox , so not over xbox live . 
  personally , i 'm a big fan of military history and the best museum of that kind i saw was the [ imperial war museum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_war_museum ) in london . 
  great building , a lot of interesting items and exhibitions . 
  what 's your favorite museum reddit ? 
  here 's the whole quote from dj shadow :, 
  so is it also a backlash and your own critique on how you personally view the music industry ? 
  dj shadow : i think that the argument has got a bit silly . 
  i think that there are a lot of archetypes , where people like to imagine record company people as mafia guys with pinky rings , smoking a cigar and sitting behind a mahogany desk . 
  and then they like to imagine artists as these steven tyler types where it does n't actually matter if you buy the music or not , because they do n't need it , they 're rich anyway , they have their bentley and their mansion . 
  [ link to the interview ] ( http://www.gigwise.com/features/64929/dj-shadow-interview ), 
  i would like to compare my profile with a friend to see which bands we have in common and how many plays does each one have .
