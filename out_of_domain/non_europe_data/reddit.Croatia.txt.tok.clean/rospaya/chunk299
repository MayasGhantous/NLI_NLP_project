  let 's say something like :, 
  profile a and b have the beatles and the who in common . 
  a has 200 plays of the beatles and b has 250 plays . 
  something like that ? 
  out of 25 links on the front page , 15 are images . 
  some make sense , but [ some submissions ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/ldv9m/clearly_you_dont_understand_anything_about/ ) are just nonsense . 
  did we have that discussion before ? 
  does anyone have any ideas how to deal with this issue ? 
  i 'm trying to get my hands on some older united nations / allied posters , like [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/propagandaposters/comments/l281a/boy_scouts_holding_a_propaganda_poster_for_the/ ) or [ this one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:marshall_plan_poster.jpg ) . 
  so not necessarily the modern un , but i wo n't complain . 
  just a regular $ 79 kindle . 
  will they allow me to buy books from europe , will it have any other problems or i 'm cool ? 
  i have n't been on the site for a couple of weeks and ( except hitting 1.14 ratio ) it says `` tokens : 5 '' . 
  what are tokens ? 
  how do i use them ? 
  long story short , my right foot is hurt and wo n't be of use for the next 6 months , so no running , cycling ... even squats hurt . 
  let 's just say i have no use of my right leg under my knee . 
  is there anything useful i could do to lose some weight and get in shape , or am i doomed to arm exercises and dieting ? 
  the myth goes that you should soak in a bathtub full of water wearing your new jeans so they would fit better after it . 
  is it true ? 
  did i misinterpret it ? 
  so , i bought the basic kindle before there was an option to ship to my country . 
  since amazon would n't send it , my cousin bought one , put it in a box and sent it . 
  just to let everyone know , it works great . 
  i 'm buying books and subscriptions and everything works fine . 
  the only odd thing is that i 'm getting ads from chicago stores , where my cousin bought it , even though i deregistered the device and made clear that i 'm in croatia . 
  this is n't that important now that amazon sends to other countries as well , but if anyone was wondering ... 
  i got the app , linked to my youtube account and it works , even though i 'm outside of the supported countries list . 
  then again xbox live works even though i 'm not on their list as well . 
  croatia , with an irish xbl gold account . 
  armenians consider it a genocide , but how do the turks handle it ? 
  what 's the official line , `` it never happened '' ? 
  i 'm travelling to monaco on business next month and i do n't have a lot of ideas what to check out . 
  my budget is limited and i 'm not impressed by luxury or gambling so the plan is to just walk around . 
  but is there anything else to do or see that i * really * have to ? 
  any other tips ? 
  i 'm interested in the differences between constitutions , and what makes some of them special or more interesting than others . 
  as someone with only a basic understanding of the law a lot of stuff in some constitutions does n't seem special , yet i am told that they are important for some reason . 
  any resource that could help me out ? 
  are n't directors ( who have their own award ) more deserving for the overall movie ? 
  there 's a bad selection of newer records where i live , so i 'm interested where can i buy vinyl online ? 
  i live in europe , croatia and looking for things like mbv , teenage fanclub , 80 's indie and other . 
  any good suggestion would be great . 
  there 's a lot of anglocentric music here so i wanted to showcase a couple of bands from yugoslavia . 
  this is all older music , pre-1991 when the country collapsed . 
  yugoslavia was socialist but was n't behind the iron curtain so punk started fairly early and had its chance to grow . 
  the bands were signed to major labels and got enough airtime to become famous . 
  the scene was later dwarfed by new wave , which was huge and very popular , among the major ones in europe at that time .

  sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this , but i 'm having some trouble finding a cheap way to get from billund to copenhagen . 
  rejseplanen and dsb are mostly in danish so i do n't know how much i missed . 
  i arrive on may 1st in billund and after three nights in copenhagen i 'm going back to billund and legoland . 
  the only way i managed is to take a local bus to vejle and the train to copenhagen , which seems to be 1500 dkk ( return and two tickets ) . 
  it looks very steep so am i missing something ? 
  is there a cheaper way ? 
  i know denmark is expensive , but this is kinda ... wow . 
  i 've never been too much into podcasts , but i 'm trying to get into podcasts . 
  can anyone recommend a good music related podcast ? 
  i loved filmspotting for movies , is there something similar for music ? 
  reviews , interviews , stories or analysis ? 
  throw something at me guys . 
  - i 'm arriving in billund on the 1st of may , do you guys celebrate may day and will i have problems with buying train and bus tickets to copenhagen ? 
  - i 'm a fan of history , military stuff , pop culture and music , is there anything i really should n't miss that 's not that popular ? 
  - how expensive would a sim card be ? 
  i only need internet access for a week . 
  - i planned to use a bike to get around copenhagen , how much would it cost to rent one ? 
  is there something i should pay attention to ? 
  - is drinking in public legal or socially acceptable ? 
  i was thinking of drinking a beer in a park or somewhere . 
  - i 'm planning to visit malmo for a few hours , any tips there or i just board the train and that 's it ? 
  - any other helpful tips for a tourist would be fine . 
  thanks . 
  edit : goddamn !, 
  thanks for all the replies and advice . 
  disclamer at the start , this is n't the whole interview , since i was doing it for my employer , but i picked a few good lines and stuff you mind find interesting . 
  it 's not that full of juicy content since i did n't have much time with him and could n't communicate freely because the voice lag between continents and cell phones did n't help much . 
  if anything , john was polite and friendly and did n't mine any questions . 
  luckily he raised the lawsuit topic so i did n't have to , and most of the interview was about that subject . 
  excuse my english and translating skills . 
   are you planning a new album with kyuss lives ? 
  is it going to be a live album , studio , new materials ? 
   i would like to , but it depends on this stupid foolish lawsuit that josh homme and scott reeder have filed against us . 
  we would like to , but we may lose or we may win so we believe that the name kyuss lives is worth fighting for . 
  it 's funny because scott reeder and nick oliveri were playing in the band so josh gave us his blessing , but now he says that we tried to steal the name which is 100 % ridiculous and now they 're trying to stop us . 
  to answer your question , it depends if we win . 
  i do n't try to think about it too much , i have other things to worry about besides those two trying to mess with me and brant . 
  i think about my family more than i do about my lawsuit , and it 's the type of fishing bait that i 'm gon na use this weekend that i 'm worried about , and not the lawsuit . 
  it 's part of what you have to go through to continue playing so we 'll see what happens . 
   you were n't expecting josh to join , but how do you feel about losing nick ? 
   i 'll be honest with you , it 's a bummer , but we wish him luck . 
  we parted on good terms and he did n't like the direction the band was going and we wish him luck . 
  his replacement is billy cordell . 
  he 's a desert resident , a local and a long time friend . 
  he 's not gon na disappoint , i assure you .
