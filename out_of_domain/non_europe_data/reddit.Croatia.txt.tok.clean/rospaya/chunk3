  i do n't know what a red button is . 
  but this is interesting to read in a political document :, 
   members emphasise that video games are a great stimulant which in addition to entertainment can also be used for medical and educational purposes , stimulating learning of facts and skills such as strategic thinking , creativity , cooperation and innovative thinking . 
  when many people think that games are `` killing simulators '' and `` violence trainers '' this feels refreshing . 
  why is it such a big deal ? 
  is this really a subject in the us , because i never heard such horror stories in my country , but then again i 'm still in high school . 
  small ? 
  the sum of all the schools i went to ( including elementary and three high schools ) does n't exceed a 1000 people . 
  slighty related story :, 
  i was in walking in prague with two of my friends on a school trip , and we notice an army / antique store , something we all liked . 
  i took some medals , it does n't matter , but one friend took a [ machine gun belt ] ( http://www.cairdpublications.com/scrap/armbitguns/images/browningbelt.jpg ) with empty casings , about the size rambo had . 
  i always carried a mini usb cable with me to charge my mp3 player when i have a chance , and gave it to the friend so he can connect the belt and walk around like rambo thru prague . 
  we 're lucky people mostly smiled and nobody called the cops on us or something . 
  is that you ? 
  it 's interesting that people on last.fm really like female vocalists so much . 
   music you have in common includes `` weird al '' yankovic , foo fighters , u2 , moby and garbage . 
  whores in my bed, 
  11 inches is a big thing ?

  pumps me up better than ratm . 
  and the whores like a choir, 
  uh , is this the sound, 
  it 's still free , but you have to pay for the radio if you live outside the us , germany and the uk . 
   hair metal is something that never happened . 
  it never existed .

  oh how i want this to be true :(, 
  have n't seen john travolta , have you ? 
   white people are snobs . 
  i 'm from a country with 99,999 % white population . 
  are we all snobs ? 
  the problem is that there is a fierce fight in peoples minds between the old socialist ways and the new capitalst . 
  people still ca n't understand why are factories shutting down , and how ruthless it is for someone to lose a job ... 
  yes , yes it is , but 18 years ago people made the decision to be in a capitalist society and have to live with it . 
  about the protest ... 
  the students are right . 
  we pay for that education with our taxes and it should be free , as should healthcare and i 'm happy to se the reform slowly crumbling down . 
  me and my parents are paying someone elses hospital bills since i was born , and i 'm proud about it . 
  i 'm proud that a society can be on such a level thet nobody sees a problem with paying for someone else with agreeing that he will pay for you one day . 
  the current government is what 's the problem now . 
  i envy the french ... the country is paralized every couple of weeks if someone tries to take away their social rights . 
  here you have a lying , cheating , corrupt government that can walk down the street without anybody throwing a rotten tomato at them . 
  that 's what 's wrong . 
  good job guys , not as epic as [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/85aun/intergalactic_what_pic/c08abdi ) , but cool non the less . 
  i noticed that too , many of them like the speed and reckless driving , but are anal about seat belts . 
  weird . 
  the first time i saw a hummer was when when i attended a conference in the same hotel snoop dogg stayed when he had a concert here . 
  it 's probably an american thing . 
  i was searching the thread for the same thing , and nothing ... 
  where does it end ? 
  will you ask the state for your money back ? 
  the county ? 
  it reminds me of the bash [ quote ] ( http://bash.org/?4780 ), 
  i do n't know who this bush fella is , but he seems smart . 
  everything needs more walken . 
  opera is still smaller in size than firefox , and i believe it is more flexible . 
  it 's probably opera mobile , or opera mini . 
  the portable version is for usb sticks and other distributions without installs . 
  i 'm a computer geek and love technology but i hate fantasy ( lotr , wow etc. ), 
  and have no problem getting friends . 
  how 's that for a stereotipe ? 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  ie and security in the same sentence ?

  the oval office looks nothing like the one in [ the west wing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_west_wing ) . 
  the song is popular here for some time , but it 's the first time i saw this performer and his version .

  i 'm reading this with a beer in my hand , so that probably counts for something . 
  there is this hospital in my city , that used to have it 's own food source - animals , vegetables and other stuff . 
  only spices and some other ingridients were bought . 
  my grandma told me how the food was ranging form good to very good , and although food was mass cooked in the kitchen , it was almost like eating at home . 
  i stayed there a couple of weeks in 1999 . and 2001 . and the food is now generic and awful .
