   what are your solo plans ? 
  garcia vs garcia and other bands and projects ? 
   garcia vs garcia is still in full effect and i 'm working on it fevereshly and i still want to continue with kyuss lives , that 's become my priority , until we win or lose the lawsuit . 
  we 're going to continue touring , we 're going to countinue writing and doing what we do . 
  one thing is for certain -- we 're not deviating from our plan of attack , from wanting to release a new record . 
  only time can tell . 
  we 're all family men , brant has two wonderful sons , i have a wonderful son and daughter , we both have great women in our lives and we 're very lucky so that 's what we do , spending time with them , not just rocking . . and let 's face it , that is one of the most important things there is . 
   i wanted to avoid mentioning personal relationships , but are you on good terms with nick and josh ? 
   when someone starts calling you names , and texting you threats , and sending you ridicilous e-mails , is that really necessary , is it that important in your life to threaten somebody like that ? 
  it 's asinine , ridicilous and i 'm above that so he can do all the name calling he wants , but i have more important things to do . 
  when you file a lawsuit against somebody , that ensures you are never playing with that person again . 
  in the words of josh , it 's a sad day for kyuss fans indeed . 
  i 'm trying hard to find an old comic book i read about 10-12 years ago . 
  the major theme was wwii , battle for france and dunkirk evacuation . 
  it was hardcover a4 format and probably in color . 
  origin may be british or french , i ca n't remember if i read it in english or translated into croatian . 
  insane amounts of googling did n't help and i would really love to find it again . 
  mini meetup ? 
  random piva ? 
  ~ ~ i 'm ron burgundy ? ~ ~, 
  there 's a thread over in / r/worldnews with the latest anti-japanese riots in china , and [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ijicx.jpg ) made me wonder . 
  the caption is :, 
   a banner on a store called pattad reads : `` pattad firmly defends china 's right to the diaoyu islands . 
  / we will give a 15 % discount to customers who yell the diaoyu islands belong to china !, 
  in the store / we will give a 20 % discount to customers who yell japan also belongs to china ! '', 
  so can china claim `` mainland '' japan or is this mislead nationalism ? 
  [ an article on wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapons_and_the_united_kingdom#nuclear_weapons_control ) states this :, 
   although the final orders of the prime minister are at his or her discretion , and no fixed options exist , four known options are often presented to prime ministers by military advisers when writing such notes of last resort : ( i ) captain ordered to respond to the nuclear attack on the uk by launching submarine 's nuclear weapons ; ( ii ) captain ordered not to respond with nuclear weapons ; ( iii ) captain ordered to use own judgement whether to return fire with nuclear weapons ; ( iv ) ** captain ordered to place himself and ship under the command of her majesty 's government in australia , or alternatively of the president of the united states . 
  the last sentence is what i 'm curious about . 
  was this official policy ? 
  why was n't france considered , or the first country i thought of , canada ? 
  we had a [ good discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/11g7gz/what_do_you_consider_to_be_the_most_important/ ) about the most important places in history , but i 'm wondering what places ( countries , regions ) are the least important and forgettable ? 
  obviously every region is important to their own population , but which ones did n't contribute much to the big picture ? 
  eztv has all the shows i want , but their rss feed does n't show them or does n't have new episodes . 
  is there an equally simple alternative or a fix ?

  enjoy guys . 
  hi , i 'm coming to vienna tomorrow for the tame impala concert in [ fluc wanne ] ( http://maps.google.com/maps?q=fluc+wanne,+praterstern+5,+wien,+1020,+at&ll=48.217267,16.394241&spn=0.009794,0.022724&om=1&hq=fluc+wanne,&hnear=praterstern,+leopoldstadt+1020+wien,+austria&t=h&z=16 ) club and it just hit me that i do n't know how to get back to my apartment that late at night . 
  so what is the situation with late-night trams , busses and subways ? 
  the club is near the prater , and my apartment is on johannagasse , near the margareteng\u00fcrtel station . 
  are taxis expensive ? 
  also i 'm staying for 4 days , what ticket would be the cheapest ? 
  does anybody know when the national day military parade is ? 
  it 's almost impossible to find anything about it , at least in english . 
  hofburg , but when ? 
  also , general tips for today would be appreciated . 
  i 've read some things about netherland 's east indies and later came across the differences between british and portuguese styles of ruling so it got me thinking . 
  what countries were the most humane and civil ? 
  colonialism is about subjugation and force , but were some worse than others ? 
  it says 1pm est which is 6pm gmt , 19h cet . 
  if anyone does n't know he 's the singer/guitarist of h\u00fcsker d\u00fc , sugar and others , do n't even bother . 
  i 'm at a crossroads where i should decide which way to go : continue with wordpress and learn php and jquery or learn java and make my dream app for android . 
  both are wanted in the local job market , but the thing is i do n't know if i 'll be able to learn to develop for android . 
  currently i 'm stuck on tutorials where i 'm making apps which i do n't understand . 
  basically , i 'm asking you folks if down the line php is easier to learn than java ? 
  i 'm not a complete noob but i 'm afraid i 'll go one way and regret it . 
  anyone have a word of advice for me ? 
  i need a rom for an old gsm htc desire . 
  the main issue is lack of space so i just need something stable and without too massive sacrifices . 
  is app2sd enough ? 
  how deep did it go ? 
  was it just an idea or a plan that was going to be operational ? 
  replace coca cola with any other product that has a massive market share and advertising budget . 
  i have an archive of around 200-300 original tech reviews from the last couple of years , mostly laptops and smartphones , and i 've also got a good domain and some skills to market it . 
  the thing is that it 's not in english , and my market is too small to get much ( profitable ) traffic on it . 
  is it worth to translate that stuff into english ? 
  i can do it myself so the only cost is my time . 
  should i start with reviews from the last 6 months and just put new ones up every couple of days ? 
  my plan was to put up some content with wordpress , optimize it , start link building/marketing and reap the benefits with adsense , but i do n't have that much seo experience . 
  a company i work for is interested in getting a videoconferencing system and i got the job . 
  unfortunately i do n't know much about it and the only guidelines i got were : something average and not too fancy so the four of us can conference with our field offices . 
  i know it 's a long shot , but can anyone give me some basic guidelines and ideas where to start ? 
  their formal policy is nuclear ambiguity , meaning that they neither confirm nor deny having such weapons , but it is taken as default that they have xy warheads , land/sea/air capabilities and a an established policy for nuclear weapons use ( samson option ) . 
  the proof about israeli nuclear weapons are based on various mostly ambiguous statements , some south african documents and mordechai vanunu 's whistle blowing . 
  what are the chances , or more precisely , are there any serious articles or academics that think it 's all a charade ? 
  even though people present the faults and advantages of both ( or more ) sides , most threads just derail into a black and white world where half of the posts are about what the us should or should n't do , what bullshit cnn is reporting and that the rebels are literally hitler ... but that assad is literally hitler as well . 
  i do n't believe the bullshit that the truth is in the middle and i have an idea what ending i would support , but the amount of shit all sides spew is disgusting and just shows that reddit is a really shitty place to follow international events . 
  specialized subreddits may be better but they are n't populated enough to foster a good discussion . 
  i 've been watching every terrorism movie i can get my hands on and one of the things i 've noticed is the bad security almost every place they attack has . 
  this is what i 've got from movies , but some of them are facts i found out . 
  carlos just walked into opec in 1975 and just a few cops made the police approach and failed . 
  when leaving the building ( according to the movie ) people were on police fences , close enough to see them . 
  earlier , his group managed to get submachine guns and rpg 's into orly airport . 
  i saw the same thing in munich , the police forces were n't ready and the crowds and tv cameras were close to the action . 
  my question is : terrorism was rampant in the 70 's and yet security seems lax in most of the places i mentioned . 
  why is that ? 
  i went to wikipedia to find out if prince was a dick , since i saw stuff like that on reddit . 
  almost nothing , just some copyright stuff and vague references to some dickish things . 
  when i want to know if some town is safe or touristy wikipedia always has some nice pr stuff or pure numbers . 
  i wish there was a truepedia where you could write that person x is a dick , neighborhood y is shitty or school z is full of hipsters . 
  although i should have known better , i 've got creative d80 bluetooth speakers and a cheap $ 1.50 usb bluetooth adapter from dealextreme . 
  i 've had some experience with windows a2dp problems but now i 'm stuck and do n't know what else to try since windows 7 does n't have compatible a2dp bt drivers for my adapter and speakers .
