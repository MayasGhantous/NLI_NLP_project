  i disagree . 
  but there 's something else i wanted to say ... 
  i 've got the macbook for a week and already hate it , can you help with some things ? 
  how do i use my local keyboard ? 
  i made it croatian but the y and z are not inverted . 
  is there something like a right click ? 
  do i need to go to edit  copy every time ? 
  can itunes play music from the local server ? 
  because it started copying it local when i tried . 
  why do n't apps close when i click the x ? 
  is this normal ? 
  the mouse use is odd . 
  i ca n't put my finger on it but it 's just different . 
  is it or am i dreaming ? 
  it 's been about a week and i ca n't stand mac os , but i do admire the stability ( well , except safari ) and fancy icons . 
  but easy ? 
  simple ? 
  only for things that are complicated on windows , the rest is the same or more complicated . 
  the prefered method to get rid of terrorist groups is swift covert action . 
  but since nato ( i 'm emphasizing this , since i 'm not from the us and 43 countries have troops there ) is in the country the worst thing is to get out and leave the country to radical islamist ... well i would n't neccesarilly call them terrorists , but it is a fact that they bred terrorists and will do it again . 
  al-qaeda is even a small character in the whole war . 
  getting out is not fixing , it 's washing hands and a cowards escape . 
  you ca n't just come in , make a shit storm and go out . 
  maybe that would be a solution for you , or any other demoralised nato taxpayer , but think how this would hit us ( us the most ) in the head in a couple of years . 
   that still begs several questions , the first of which is , `` better than what ? '', 
  well we both agree there is a problem , right ? 
  the problem being the general state of afghanistan and its people . 
   once that question is answered , the second question is , `` what makes you believe we can make it better than `` x '' ? 
  it is not morally justified to attempt to fix a problem because you `` should '' fix a problem , but only because you can and know you can fix a problem . 
  our moral justification comes from the fact we invaded it with the intention of ... bla bla , the intention is not important and could be very wrong . 
  it 's the fact that troops from 43 countries are there , working on restoring peace , prosperity and a better life for people . 
  the current course is wrong and obviously is n't the correct one . 
  the focus is on trying , because copping out without giving everything you can to fix the trouble you 've made is wrong in every moral way of looking at it . 
  `` fix the mess you 've done '', 
   perhaps , but again , given history , and i 'm not only referring to afghanistan 's historical relationship with imperialism , but the history of humanity , in general , and the history of the nations , specifically , currently attempting to `` fix '' the problem ; what makes you believe that this `` someone '' being identified , much less given the power to fix the problems , is probable , ... much less possible ? 
  interesting argument , but this kind of thinking does n't seem right . 
  just because we never made it means we should n't even try ? 
  and although the focus is on the international community failing , it has solved quite a few problems and made life better for many people . 
  a bad track record does n't have to mean we should say `` we came here , toppled the ` government ' , made your life worse and while in the process of making it better , we 're leaving '' . 
   even with absolute will and unlimited resources , i think we will only hurt them and delay their eventual progress . 
  again , without going into the reasoning for the initial invasion , why do you think they had any progress ? 
  afghanistan was going downhill with or without the invasion , but became a threat while doing so . 
  i 'm skeptical too , and seeing my comment on -5 and a selfish `` let 's gtfo '' on +8 does n't give me hope for my cause or giving me the impression i 'm right . 
  but i ca n't think we 've tried enough ... for the mess we 've done , we have n't tried enough . 
  yes , that 's the moral dilemma i have . 
  but once a country becomes a threat to others , like afghanistan was , it 's no longer an internal issue . 
  pozdrav . 
  that 's very interesting . 
  you had a personal motive or was just interested on an academic level ? 
  it 's different when they have the support of a whole government , and a playground to train terrorists . 
  they can plan and attack only if they 're great in playing hide and seek , or if a country hosts them , which multiplates their ability to plan and execute attacks . 
  by giving them safe refuge afghanistan made himself a target . 
  but again , i do n't want to go into moral reasons why the war started . 
  we 're there , let 's make the best of it . 
  well i 'm properly fucked in this regard . 
  i censor myself now , but if a future boss googled more than 5-6 pages of my nick or real name he would find some nasty stuff i 've written when i was younger . 
  fucking google groups with their archiving ... 
  her : `` under the asshole shell there 's got to be a good person somewhere in you '', 
  me : `` get some tits and then we can talk '', 
  after elementary i actually got to be a good person . 
  she still has small tits . 
  not anymore . 
  i 've got it in my nokia e71 , but i do n't drive and know my city well enough not to need it . 
  like : satellite and map view and poi, 
  dislike : a little sluggish, 
  i 'm just addressing the often heard `` fact '' that os x is easy or simple . 
  it is not . 
  i 'll report to you on the yz thing , i 'm not on the mac now , but i do remember choosing everything croatian . 
  i do n't want to go there . 
  i do n't think you 're right , but if we go this way we 'll be on 9/11 , truthers , pipelines and hitler in no time . 
  i respect your opinion and have upvoted you ( and everybody else developing a good argument ) but i do n't think we can judge the current situation just because of the reasoning used to get here ... 
  it 's never late to do the right thing ( corny , i know ) . 
  the reasons for being there can be good or right but we ** are ** there , right now , for good or bad reasons . 
  it does n't make me happy , do n't worry . 
  you went to school together , worked together and are related ? 
  or he 's just twelve . 
  i 'm looking forward to it . 
  thanks for your help , i 'm getting snow leopard in a couple of days so i 'll try your suggestions . 
  i 'm not a switcher so it 's still windows at home and linux on server for me , but i get to play with apple hardware from time to time and some things have been bothering me the whole time . 
  well i 'm born in 1989 . and remember this very well , i even have it on cassette somewhere . 
  the song is from 2001 , not 1999 as mom-bot said . 
  god i hate you for reminding me about him . 
  seven nation army , fell in love with a girl or catch hell blues whould be better imo . 
  i 've got a playlist for these situations .
