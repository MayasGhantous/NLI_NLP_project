  my fingers are bleeding for doing all of this on a shitty touchpad and small keyboard . 
  you better like this , you hear !, 
  smells like ... victory . 
  two weeks spent hoping they did n't forgot to make holes in the box . 
  hey , the guy from hanson dyed his hair . 
   12 ) 9/11 clearly did not happen as we were told . 
  bin laden was fingered as the culprit within about three hours , the footage was very clearly photoshopped, 
  let me guess . 
  the pixels . 
  you can tell by them . 
  i 'm fairly sure there was a grand conspiracy to kill jfk and even if lee harvey oswald did it , it was a part of a large plot . 
  even though it 's not that big of an issue anymore , that 's the only thing i would like to learn during my lifetime . 
  tv 's using led backlighting use a lot less power therefore are cheaper in the long run . 
   not a power user, 
   i do n't need apps ;, 
  um , windows mobile is the opposite of what you need , in this regards . 
  it 's made for power users that know what to do with a powerful os like that . 
  are you sure you want a smartphone ? 
  do you even know what one is ? 
  you can sync a feature phone ( dumb phone ) , too . 
  from everything you wrote , i 'd still recommend symbian . 
  it has great sycing options ( bluetooth or cable with a pc , over the air on ovi ) , it 's simple and offers great pim apps with it . 
  try some nokia from the e series . 
  [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/line_of_succession_to_the_british_throne ) beautiful list of 1615 people in line of succession to the british throne . 
  or 2girls1cup . 
  it 's a tie . 
   do n't watch pornography !, 
  really ? 
  he 's 18 !, 
  we should upvote it . 
  there was , a couple of years back , before iphone got out . 
  then people just forgot about it so it can be called a smartphone . 
  well , let 's take a feature phone , something like ... nokia 7610 supernova . 
  it can do e-mail , full html web ( opera mini is installed ) , you can sync it with nokia pc suite with not problems and putting music on is a matter of minutes . 
  connecting to work servers ? 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  vista on my laptop , happy about it . 
  xp on my htpc , mostly happy . 
  ubuntu on my server , it could be better . 
  symbian on my phone , happy . 
  i kissed a girl and i liked it . 
  well in that case you are limited to a symbian , blackberry , android or windows mobile device . 
  in my experience , wm does exchange the best , which is only natural because they 're both from microsoft . 
  i worked for a smartphone company , and for the last couple of years i 'm a journalist specialized in smartphones , so i 've used 'em all . 
  but getting stuck with a cheap sony ericsson a couple of years ago i realized that the differences are n't so wide anymore , and you do n't have to sacrifice much to have a good phone who is cheap and simple in the same time . 
  this subreddit sucks in the sense that up/down votes are based mostly on favoritism , eg . 
  the band or music you mention in the comment . 
  no , get more advice , by all means . 
  you 'll find something that fits you . 
  did you see the video for smack my bitch up from prodigy ? 
  i ca n't find it on youtube , but look it up somewhere . 
  related . 
  well at least he 'll have a full fridge . 
  [ bam ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x25uxm_prodigy-smack-my-bitch-up_music ) . 
  in europe both mtv2 and vh1 ( vh1 classic too ) have music all the time . 
  the backstory of tears in heaven is important here . 
  from wikipedia :, 
   `` tears in heaven '' is a ballad written by eric clapton and will jennings about the pain clapton felt following the death of his four-year-old son , conor , who fell out of a 53rd-story window in his mother 's friend 's new york city apartment , on march 20 , 1991 . 
  / mu / called . 
  they want their hipsters back . 
  well it 's an energetic song , and that 's what we 're looking for , right ? 
  i get off on both angry and , like this one , somewhat happy songs . 
  glenn beck is a douchbag - zack braff on glenn beck, 
  look at the top , notice the song from mulan , recognize that jerking off on a guitar is not a requirement for a song to be pumping . 
  so they can repeat only old music all the time , not both old and new . 
  indeed it was . 
  it was just to try it . 
  where i live all isps have dynamic ips and they still need to disclose the information if provided with a warrant . 
  [ oasis - wonderwall ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzrdeceekc ), 
  [ coldplay - clocks ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kkwgy7w3_o ), 
  they recorded an album ? 
  i thought they only beat up reporters and insult other bands in public . 
  that 's why i wrote that from a technical standpoint it does n't matter if it 's fixed or dynamic . 
  you 're not more anonymous . 
  if i have to die one day , i want him to kill me . 
  i kinda know the guy guilty for that . 
  i work at a big it magazine here and a lot of journalists were impressed with the hype , so my boss in the end decided to put it on the front page . 
  his boss intervened in that so the front page ended up as `` wolfram alpha : fuck yeah , google is dead ! '' . 
  which was hyped to hell and back . 
  so it became popular here . 
  well nirvana and pink floyd have nothing to do there , and ac/dc is n't really * metal * . 
  but i do n't agree , a lot of there albums are great . 
  no , that 's the hp people . 
  because linux laptops look different from others and their looks are really distinguishable ? 
  edit : gosh , does everything need to have an / s tag ? 
  most people buy laptops because of the mobility , not raw performance . 
  i use my 13 '' toshiba for surfing , writing , taking notes , the occasional photoshop and watching movies . 
  none of that uses its full potential . 
  i find that primitive , rude , and not worthy of an institution of high power .
