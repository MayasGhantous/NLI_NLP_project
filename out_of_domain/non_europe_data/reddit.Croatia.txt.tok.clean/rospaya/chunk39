  i know how you feel . 
  my top rated comment just says `` 4chan '' . 
  i remember my teachers . 
  the ones who insulted me , embarassed me and in the end expelled me . 
  although i 'm a good person i never forget to say that i will ruin their lives as they tried to ruin mine . 
  and one day , when they do n't expect it , i will . 
  saw them live , very creepy and funny in the same time . 
  is n't that the rough diamonds album ? 
   after we catered, 
  you work for activision ? 
  and it 's not catering , it 's obeying the law . 
  ridiculous or not , it 's a law . 
  can someone smarter than me explain why is this a big deal ? 
  i 'm aware that it might be a sign of life , but that sounds a little too pop sci . 
  i have a strong urge to kill everybody in that ad , including the people responsible for this crap . 
  i hope reddit delivers . 
   it screamed child pornography to me , or at least something shady but they never undressed or anything . 
  i told my manager but she did n't seem to care at all . 
  am i a bad person if i would n't do anything ? 
  good idea ... 
  brb, 
  thanks for the advice . 
   remember , you are paying for this . 
  education is free where i live . 
  i already have a job and a full cv . 
  i was dicking around in high school which gave me a chance to get good at what i like ( hence the job ) . 
  college is just a piece of paper for me , but i know that it can raise my chances of getting a job and there 's a slight chance that i learn something . 
  also , being a complete failure in high school , i want to do something that will make my parents happy . 
  you mean like wine and votka ? 
  i do n't like them , but i can give it a try . 
  [ you two ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/9oly3/college_starts_tomorrow_how_to_get_in_the_loop/c0dnzh5 ) should hang out . 
  realize that it 's not ? 
  in all the movies where characters can walk through walls , why do n't they fall through the floor ? 
   communism was responsible for about 100 million murders in the 20th century, 
  no it was not . 
  communism is a social and economical system , not a killing machine ... 
  i do n't remember marx writing about killing 100 million people , and i have doubts about the number but that 's another story . 
  those deaths were made by governments and systems that tried to implement communism in some way . 
  needless to say , not a single one of them made it . 
  so , evil . 
  are we talking about ideas , body counts , intents , percent of people killed in relation to the world population or people killed over a period of time ? 
  communism is in its basics a noble and humanic idea . 
  the problem is it 's been misinterpreted and used as a disguise by evil regimes to work out their agendas . 
  ideas do n't kill people , people kill people . 
  just because he 's almost universally liked . 
  well anarchy must be the best system there is , then . 
   society does not do well when run by central planners ; the entire history of communist nations proves that much , and more . 
  that 's the reason i emphasised `` in its basics a noble and humanic idea '' . 
  it did n't work out and no one normal wants it back . 
  please , prove your theory that communism killed those people , not evil regimes . 
  come drunk . 
  fight the bully , screw the cheerleader . 
  that 's what i did a couple of weeks ago . 
  except it 's been 4 months since i finished high school , i got drunk there and i did n't have any girls in my class . 
  otherwise the same thing . 
  shit over windows mobile all you want , but there you are free to distribute your app any way you like - through the store , on the web , ota ... 
  nothing blocking you to make your app for free and distribute it how you see fit . 
  i do n't get how we got from an open app market to this ? 
  it might be better for some developers ( primarily for money making ) but it makes our before open devices - closed . 
  well not all games are art and games are certainly not movies . 
  but hey , if you want to compair them , take a good movie , an excellent movie like elephant . 
  i really liked it . 
  but it is boring as hell , everything the director made is shot in the ground with the simple fact that it 's not entertaining . 
  gta iv on the other hand might have shoddy dialogues and dumb characters , but it 's fun . 
  i can respect tim schafer , but in the same time respect everything from worms to gta , because it is ** fun ** . 
  story or no story , most people play games to have fun and we should keep that in focus . 
  that 's what i said , monetary , it 's better . 
  the centralized model has its good sides , but look at the mixed side , the one s60 and wm have . 
  you can sell it in the official store , follow the rules and make money . 
  paralel with that you can sell it by yourself and make users more happy . 
  look at the ongoing app store rejection fiasco . 
  i 'm not talking about one , but thousands of apps being rejected under draconian terms . 
  sure , it 's their platform , they can do whatever they want , but it does n't make it ok . 
   plenty of iphone users are happy with their apps . 
  i sad * more happy * , as in happier , as in better than now . 
  i was pointing out the politics od it , not ease of development . 
  and i do n't think hardware fragmentation matters for tip calculators , while it could be a bitch for games . 
  what app was it if it 's not a secret ? 
  you idiots . 
  only someone who never saw war could talk about fighting their countrymen for this crap . 
  i 've met a few wm developers that were mostly satisfied with the way ms is handling all the screen sizes in the dev tools .

  there are a shitload of definitions what europe actually is , and turkey fits in most of them . 
  not really , i was in a couple of towns there , from the capital to villages and tourist areas . 
  most women do n't wear a hijab and are equally present as workers in the market and other stores . 
  except the cult of president ben ali , tunisia is a fairly modern and decent country . 
  do n't follow the hdi index like its set in stone . 
  i live in a 40-something country better than i would in higher ones . 
  normal people can live well outside of the top 20 , you know ... 
  i have one of those mine leaflets somewhere at home . 
  i know you 're kidding , but with associating a good society with the hdi index you said just that .
