  i do n't know anything and it is the language of diplomacy so i will have to learn it one day , right ? 
  i offered to teach her italian insults , so that 's ok . 
  i work , go to college , run a couple of web sites and breathe in the same time so i do n't think i have the time . 
  can someone explain to me what does the lisbon treaty say about enlargement of the eu ? 
  i 'd find it out myself , but there is a shitload of propaganda out there . 
  oh , you have n't been to eastern europe i see . 
  knowing people and having money gets you * anything * . 
  i get the sarcasm , and i agree . 
  give the power to corporations and you get society as we have it , give it to the government and get corruption . 
  the system needs a shitload more work with it . 
  i 'm from croatia so i 'm interested . 
  as i see it now , iceland and croatia are the only near-term candidates possible , but some countries have various rules about new countries joining so if iceland decides to join it could be a problem for us . 
  thanks . 
  btw , what is your opinion on expanding the eu on croatia ? 
  i could murder you right now and given the right people and amount of money i could be running for president in a week . 
  beat that !, 
   unfortuneatly we 'll never get another thing ** like ** a communist revolution that will change the way this crooked system works . 
  ** like ** a communist revolution , not ** the ** communist revolution . 
  just a massive event that could change the system we have now , like communism did in many countries . 
  i 'm not going into a conversation whether it was good or bad , but just the event . 
  a great change . 
  i could kill two kids and get no punishment after the trial because my rich dad is sending me to school in switzerland . 
  oh wait , one guy did that . 
  gosh their logo looks [ familiar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:coat_of_arms_of_serbia.svg ) . 
  it 's a tie . 
  there was a lobbyist iama a couple of months ago , he almost persuaded people that it does more good than evil . 
  with the chance of being buried ;, 
  the rights granted by the constitution refer to all , so i do n't see why a corporation should n't have the right to free speech ? 
  sure , the examples you wrote are all evil , but so is the guy disguising racism behind the first amendmant . 
  rights have a down side , too . 
  and people ( and corporations ) will use it for their own benefit . 
  so it 's not the corporate personhood that 's the problem , but its misuse . 
  we ca n't apply right just when we like the results , that 's why they 're universal and not selective . 
  how to fix it ? 
  `` do n't be evil '' , or make a better system , both utopian ideas . 
  my town hosted the 2009 [ handball championship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_world_men's_handball_championship ) . 
  we were second but the whole event was really exciting for a small country like mine but we made a couple of new stadiums that wo n't be payed off in decades to come . 
  i just shed a tear . 
  i 'd do it too , but there 's a certain stigma around that where i live . 
  most gypsies keep to themselves , but on `` large garbage day '' twice every year they come out in numbers , and guard their piles of worthy stuff , mostly metal . 
  whole families guard the worthy stuff day and sometimes night , for a couple of days , then the head of the family comes with an old , unregistered van and takes the stash and sells it . 
  even if i found something worthy i 'm not sure i 'd take it . 
  but i got ta say i 'd take good speakers without a problem or shame . 
  the subreddit is called * world * news , so ... 
  that 's a lousy argument for voting no . 
  if you have a thing against your government then vote against it on general elections , not a treaty . 
  i got screwed over by a hotel once in country on another continent . 
  so i made my money worth : i took everything from batteries in the remote to light bulbs and glasses . 
  the room did n't have a minibar and i made sure that they wo n't check the room before i left so i was free to wreak havoc . 
  no u !, 
  i got my first sets when my sister stopped playing with them , it was just generic blocks , so i just made things out of my imagination . 
  all the sets i 've bought were just for the parts , i made the models , but tore them down and made stuff i want to . 
  i agree on everything , but :, 
   turn off the damn tv , there are better things to do !, 
  there are better things to do , but a massive part of my generation grew up on tv , and while it 's popular to call it evil , i 'm sure i would n't be half the person i am today without dexter 's laboratory , johnny bravo and powerpuff girls . 
  do n't underestimate the value of that . 
  where were the olympics held in 1992 ? 
  it 's a matter of prestige and honor for a city to host the olympics . 
  it might be a financial loss for 30 years , but it puts the hosting cities into legends and makes them a part of the largest international event of todays media infested world . 
  what greater legacy can a city leave ? 
  i 'll share all 7 invites to redditors . 
   it 's as pimp my ride up is to top gear, 
  that 's actually a very good analogy . 
  brave soldier . 
  nobody mentioned [ ken park ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ken_park ) ? 
  also , kids . 
  one of the best albums i 've heard . 
  [ i love ] ( http://www.insults.net/html/swear/croatian.html ) the [ balkans ] ( http://www.insults.net/html/swear/serbian.html ) . 
   aside from the issue of . xxx the american controlled icann has been almost entirely benign . 
  for now , but the significance of internet is getting bigger as time goes by , and that 's not even mentioning how important it is during warfare . 
  just because we 're satisfied by the way the us governed it by know , what guarantee do we have that it will continue ? 
  i 'm for freedom as every guy , but we should find some alternative to a unilateral approach . 
  why do americans always think that a tyrant or a dictator will come over night , declare marshall law and rule with an iron fist ? 
  why is it that there 's never mention of a scenarion in which the tyrannical government gets to power legally , fragments the us popular opinion and presents itself as a saviour . 
  third of the population will love it , a third will hate it but wo n't think it 's necessary to pull their guns , and a third is , as always , stoned with day to day life and/or celebrity gossip . 
  the above is in no way related to the current situation , the scenario is here only to point out that evil people are not dumb and will certainly avoid conflict and all-out social unrest . 
  i recommend [ rebel yell ] ( http://m.youtube.com/watch?desktop_uri=%2fwatch%3fv%3d_p9b2zdnc6o&amp;v=_p9b2zdnc6o ) as a really fun song . 
  that just might be the solution . 
  decentralize it as much as possible so that a country can influence only their own part of the net . 
  that 's almost the case today , but there are a lot of other technical details that make my internet dependant on other governments . 
  in an ideal case there would be zero interference of any governmental body with the internet , but that would end up as anarchy . 
  croatian and serbian , too . 
  because not all people are good and without proper regulation bad turns over good ? 
  if you want a rational discussion go to a subreddit not called * comics * . 
  this one is made to be funny , not serious . 
  how would social regulation solve spam and hacker attacks ? 
  even a regulated internet has that problems , think what would happen once people can do what they want . 
  i got hooked on the thick of it and when i found out a movie is out ( and malcolm is in ! ), 
  i had to watch it . 
  a brilliant movie . 
  does not compute . 
  unfortunately . 
   oh and many of the south european countries are to religious . 
  i 'm an atheist , but this argument does n't make any sense . 
  poland , italy and portugal are more religious than countries not in the eu , if we can believe [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/religion_in_the_world.png ) map , and the amount of religious people in a country does n't mean anything about its possibility to contribute to the eu . 
  i 'm from a country with 87 % catholics and we had an atheist pm and now have a atheist president . 
  i 'm pro eu , but not exactly the way it 's been going . 
  the main problem is poor unity on issues like foreign policy and military , which could prove to be a problem in the future , as it was in the past . 
  because of eu 's hesitation to act the balkans exploded into a mess and us had to step in to do the dirty work . 
  this is a great problem - how can countries trust the eu to do the right thing if it is so fragmented by politics ?
