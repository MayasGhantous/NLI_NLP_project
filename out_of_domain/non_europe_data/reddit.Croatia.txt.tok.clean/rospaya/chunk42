  anyway , i 'm absolutely pro eu , but with more focus on economy than central control . 
  almost everything you wrote is wrong . 
  sorry , english is not my first language . 
  if you use firefox , which i do n't . 
  you got a strong point there . 
  well . . nazi punks fuck off . 
  they have machines that do this for them , no need to waste personnel . 
  i 'm 12 and what is this ? 
  ** tarantino ** , ** guy ritchie ** and ** david fincher ** . 
  epa once calculated it on aroud 13 million , but i ca n't find a link now . 
  yes , you could bribe them to ... take more garbage ? 
  carry something from the back yard ? 
  what ? 
  masons ... 
  everywhere !, 
  it 's even better than the movie . 
   sam peckinpah, 
  loved the wild bunch and cross of iron . 
   mike hodges, 
  watched only flash and get carter . 
   michael mann, 
  the kingdom and heat were excellent . 
  never heard of him . 
  i 'm going to get downvoted for this , but the hurt locker was overrated . 
   remember it 's never too early to become a movie snob !, 
  i 'm doing my best . 
  well i read the economist since i was 16 and drank in the same time . 
  having fun and being interested in stuff is n't exclusive . 
   she may have been drunk too, 
  i 'm fairly certain she was . 
  mine must be broken . 
  oh well , i can handle the downvotes . 
  we 're used to it , do n't worry . 
  transformers 2 with a friend , paid money to see it . 
  why ? 
  most browsers have a simple method of blocking ads , or even automatic ways like adblock . 
  personally , if a site is full of ads and it bothers with my experience i can just right click `` block content '' , and have a nice layout in a matter of seconds . 
  i just do n't see the need to completely block out every ad there is . 
   italy 's prime minister reminiscent of fascist past, 
  ftfy, 
  what ? 
  cell phones started as an open platform , the only people closing it are us carriers ( never saw this in europe ) and apple . 
  i can install anything i want on my wm and symbian phones . 
  ** anything ** . 
  and it 's completely ok with microsoft , htc and nokia . 
  since i do n't watch star trek and only know of wil as a reddit superstar , this is the only thing that comes to mind . 
  that and p-dub 's faux pas a couple of weeks ago . 
   carriers ruled the industry with an iron fist, 
  they did and continue to , but mostly in the us , europe has a far more relaxed market . 
   to access carriers ' networks handset makers capitulated everything, 
   carriers dictated phone designs , features , apps , prices , marketing , advertising and branding, 
   phones were reduced to cheap , disposable lures for carriers ' service contracts, 
  there were smartphones before the iphone ( personally i would n't call it that , but i digress ) , it 's only the carriers problem that they did n't carry them . 
   there was no revenue sharing between carriers and manufacturers, 
  yes there was , but only with specific models . 
   there was no notion of phone networks becoming dumb pipes anytime soon, 
  again , us . 
  also , this is a thing of legislation more than carriers . 
   affordable , unlimited data plans as standard were unheard of, 
   a phone that would entice people to switch networks by the millions was a pipe dream, 
   mobile devices were phones first and last , not usable handheld computers, 
  i fucking ran a server on my phone two years before the iphone got out . 
  surfed the web , used irc , e-mail and played games . 
   even the smartest phones did n't have seamless wifi integration, 
  they did . 
  most phones had a simple `` options  turn wifi on  type wep '' deal and that 's it , but some platforms did it complicated , like wm. 
   without visual voice mail , messages could n't be managed non-linearly, 
  i used voice mail maybe a couple of times in my life so i do n't know anything about that . 
   there were no manufacturer owned and operated on-the-phone application stores as the sole source, 
  why is a ** sole ** source a good thing ? 
  nokia had a rudimentary store where you could find some apps , but most people got it directly , or over app directories ( which were n't on the phone ) . 
  developers did n't want to give their freedom away and apple did a good thing here by closing the gap , but it seems too tight . 
   an on-the-phone store having 65,000 apps downloaded nearly 2 billion times was not on anyone 's radar screen, 
  palm , wm and symbian all had tens of thousands of apps in the time iphone got out . 
  missing a store , yes , but the quantity is here . 
   low-cost , high-volume app pricing strategy with a 70/30 split did n't exist, 
  true . 
   robust one-click in-app transactions were unknown, 
  not in the west , but japan had those years ago . 
   there was no efficient , large scale , consistent and lucrative mobile app market for developers large and small, 
  true . 
   buttons , keys , joysticks , sliders ... anything but the screen was the focus of phones, 
  touch screen phones existed for years and i remember a [ specific ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/qtek_s100-1172.php ) one where people complained about the lack of buttons . 
   phones did n't come with huge 3.5 \u2033 touch screens, 
  i do n't know about size , but i had phones with big touch screens years before iphone got out . 
  example : [ sony ericsson p900 - 2,9 ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_p900-544.php ) and [ qtek 9000 - 3,6 ] ( http://www.gsmarena.com/qtek_9000-1264.php ) . 
   pervasive multitouch , gesture-based ui was science fiction, 
  because * someone * had a patent on them . 
   actually usable , multi-language , multitouch virtual keyboards on phones did n't exist, 
  because * someone * had a patent on them . 
   integrated sensors like accelerometers and proximity detectors had no place in phones, 
  false . 
  all before iphone . 
   phones could never compete in 3d/gaming with dedicated portable consoles, 
  every n-gage owner that has the balls will say that it was a great gaming platform . 
  i spent days and days playing 3d games that went from rpg to fps and strategy . 
   ipod-class audio/video players on mobiles did n't exist, 
  again bs . 
  ipod class means what ? 
  that everything from an ecosystem will play on a device , right ?
