  every progressive system is free until a more progressive one comes along . 
  it started from greece , france , us ... we can find the `` most free '' system today and label it like that , but not until a new one comes . 
  uncanny valley , ahead !, 
  except creed , they just suck . 
  i knew 90 % of the worlds capital cities by the age of 10 . 
  pretty proud about that one . 
  i could n't think of a better song for that moment . 
  like it or not , that scene is one of the best audio / visual experience in modern movies . 
  are you kind of a big deal ? 
  i used to collect cell id 's a couple years ago , and mark them on the map . 
  primitive gps , and it worked only on places i 've been , but nice idea for 2002 . 
  i like [ die toten hosen - hier kommt alex ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x-yqphitr8 ) and [ zehn kleine j\u00e4germeister ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqp8whiev0o ) from the same band . 
  i 'm not german . 
  [ someones experience with that ] ( http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/11/cohen200711 ), 
  i 'm not from the us so i did n't know about potusa until a couple of months ago , after which i became obsessed with your music - my last.fm says it 's been 447 songs . 
  i just wanted you to know that i really love the stuff you guys made and that it 's a great thing to communicate like this online with someone who 's music i listen to every day , and consider a fucking superstar . 
  it 's very interesting to read all of this `` lol vista sux '' comments , not only here , but ... everywhere . 
  and after that a wall of praise for w7 . 
  can anyone say to me , with a straight face , that w7 is so fucking radically different from vista ? 
  using vista as my main os for about a year i never had any more problems than with xp . 
  the whole `` vista sucks '' sentiment looks like anti ms propaganda , and `` w7 rules '' pro ms propaganda . 
  where does it say that nokia is suing for gps ? 
  it 's technologies related to it . 
  no it does fucking not . 
  it has patents to related technologies , which apple forgot to pay . 
  i used every smartphone sold in europe since the beginning , and think the iphone is substandard . 
  horrible is a subjective term . 
  for everyone dissin ' nokia for low sales : nokia sells more phones in 5 months than apple sold iphones since it was announced . 
  i 'm a tech journalist and worked in the industry a couple of years ago . 
  i can agree only on the level of polish . 
  i never had problems with crashes , interfaces , speeds or support . 
  of course , some phones were better or worse than others , but nothing so shitty that the iphone could be percieved as a revolutionary smartphone . 
  people who say this are : from the us or never used more than 10 smartphones , do n't know anything about the market , dumb or extremely smart and know something the rest of us do n't . 
  also , iphone is not a smartphone . 
  i do n't fucking care about over 9000 apps that people are blinded by , but before it came out we had a definition of a smartphone , and a crucial part of it was multitasking . 
  now everyone just forgot . 
  it 's vista with a few changes and a new skin . 
  i do n't agree on grunge , it used to describe something , but then it was broadened to bands that changed their style , so today we have people putting mudhoney and pearl jam in the same basket . 
  pj had grunge songs back then , but today it 's just alt rock . 
  please answer this . 
  well , i once heard somewhere that fugazi and husker du set the stage for emo , and the genre name got hijacked by the `` i cry a lot and might be bisexual '' crowd . 
  i think of it the same way . 
   you are probably not a very good journalist then , i bet you worked in some crappy add-filled magazine like t3 or something, 
  i bet you 're a rapist and a pedophile . 
  if you could get that i 'm bad at what i do and work for t3 of all magazines from that , i can gather enough to call you a rapist . 
   crashes : most recent nokias hang when you are attempting something not-so ordinary , for example when you receive a call just after you have finished with one , before the summary screen goes off . 
  yes , i 've noticed that and it annoys me , but i just click the menu button twice . 
  1/3 of a second , but i still remember it as a bug ... probably the only one i remember . 
   interfaces : i 've used 3 nokia `` smartphones '' and none was even close to be as customisable as the iphone is . 
  i disagree . 
  you can make folders , change themes ( make your own if you want ) , on some models use widgets ... 
  but why take nokia and s60 ? 
  windows mobile can go from [ this ] ( http://smartphonenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/windows-mobile-65.jpg ) to [ this ] ( http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/uploads/images/mobileshell/screenshots/3.5/100.png ) in a second . 
   support : buy a phone in the uk , go for a holiday ... 
  i got my e61 repaired in hungary a couple of years ago , even though it was bought in another country . 
  got the same phone repaired twice after that and got a new one . 
   but tell me if you ever felt the urge to throw the device on a brick wall and savour the sight as it would explode to thousands of pieces . 
  yes i did , mostly early wm smartphones and some sony ericsson uiq 's . 
  iphone does n't have anything in it that would give me that urge , it 's just too dumbed down . 
   do n't tell me that you have to be a power user to do that, 
  you lose your warranty , that 's a good enough reason , even for power users . 
  again , why are you using nokia for something they were never even famous for ? 
  you can mod wm to hell and back , something that 's impossible with the iphone , even with jailbreaking . 
   and yes the iphone is a smart phone . 
  prove it . 
  i 've got a phone that can have apps installed , i can listen to music and surf the net on it , it has a simple interface ... 
  it 's an old sony ericsson i bought as a backup phone years ago . 
  it was n't a smartphone now and it was n't then . 
   the smart phone market was tiny before the iphone, 
  there were 100 million symbian devices before the iphone was sold . 
  that 's just symbian , if we get wm , linux and others in there we get around 200 million , before iphone . 
  there are 33 million iphones out there , and you 're still claming that it was tiny then ? 
  if it was , it 's tiny today , even if you count it as a smartphone . 
   i would define anything as internet enabled and having a non-wap browser . 
  this . 
  this is what the apple propaganda machine made you think . 
  if we count like that we have literary half a billion smartphones , and if you consider opera mini ... whew . 
  the standard smartphone definition , before everyone became an expert for it was :, 
  - a mobile phone with advanced pim posibilities , including sync, 
  - multitasking, 
  - running native applications, 
  - connecting to the internet, 
   look at how many `` next gen '' smart phones have sold in such a small period of time, 
  want to split hairs ? 
  symbian did the 100 million in [ 6 years ] ( http://www.thesmartpda.com/50226711/six_years_of_symbian_produces_100_models_and_100_million_shipments.php ) , windows mobile got to 50 million in [ 4 years ] ( http://moconews.net/article/419-mwc-we-learned-just-how-great-of-a-partner-htc-is-to-microsoft/ ) . 
  33 million iphones are nothing to write home about . 
  only ? 
  * only * ? 
  that 's one out of four . 
   a smartphone does n't have to have exactly what you want it to have . 
  there is a definition , a internationally accepted one that was used for years . 
  then the `` internet machine '' came out and while masturbating over safari everyone just said it is a smartphone . 
  it is not . 
  by the fucking definition , it is not . 
  just because you consider it smart means nothing . 
  usenet is good for obscure stuff and getting my troll fix , but torrents really cover all of my angles . 
  if you know where to look and do n't have a problem with sharing , most people can find everything they need . 
  super troopers . 
  i just watched the cartoon a couple of times but this comic makes me bawww . 
  i 'm writing this down .
