  maybe they 've been using agps or cellphone tower location or something else , because i used more than 50 smartphones with gps in them and never had any problems with precision ... maybe lack of poi 's , bad map managment or search , but never precision . 
  check out ovi maps ( it was nokia maps before ) which gives you free maps , poi 's , 3d buildings , satellite and street view , along with everything you 'd expect from any gps software , but in a couple of megabytes . 
  the only thing you have to pay for are premium stuff like voice guidance , traffic and city guides , and that 's available for a very small fee , or for free on some phones . 
  tell us more . 
  this shows that , as always , economy and people 's well-being will form peace , the same way it is now forming hostility ( the riots part ) . 
  sooo ... is she in grade school ? 
  i agree , i 'm a bad person and have no tact ... 
  but it was an opportunity hard to miss . 
  i apologise to the father and welcome any downvotes , but i wo n't delete it , i stand by my words even at -20 . 
  the universe is still here ... how ? 
  the only opinion i have on this is ... 
  it just sounds too insane to chop off some skin from a baby 's penis . 
  are there any benefits on this , except religious ? 
  wwii is hardly an argument here , the situation was radically different and ca n't be compaired with today 's . 
  poland is now a part of nato and eu , has a strong and efficient army , and wo n't be bullied like it was 60 years ago . 
  if we let russia do it , when will it end ? 
  whole eastern europe ? 
  germany ? 
  you know absolutely nothing about history , modern politics , geopolitics and the way modern societies work with each other . 
  who said that ? 
  i 'm just commenting on your lack of knowledge about the way the world works these days . 
  your argument is that poland is n't worth much and nobody will help it , which is absolute nonsense . 
  the whole `` nato and eu do n't mean anything and poland is n't worth enough to save '' ca n't be a real argument in today 's world , even more so when we 're talking about the 34th most populous country in the world , with the 18th largest gdp . 
  that 's not even mentioning that it has powerful friends and shares a border with germany , which in itself gives it great importance . 
  russia 's attack on poland would start wwiii and that is the precise reason why it wo n't happen . 
  `` hope i ** do n't ** die before i get old '', 
  * vomit *, 
  my friend and i often fight about that one , i prefer the unplugged version , it does n't have the riff and soul of the original , but it is a nicer song , at least to me . 
  frank zappa did a good `` i am the walrus '' . 
  i do n't know , but the fucker is ruining my chances . 
  ok , your two examples are not really that special where i live , and i 'm sure many people will agree with me . 
  your previous experiences are messed up , so japan seemed so great for you . 
  i 've helped tourists not only find their way , but show them where to eat , what to see and where to shop ... two confused asians staring at a map is enough for any person to see a red light . 
  do an iama . 
  i do n't like fantasy or sf ( okay , maybe a few movies , but that 's it ) , believe in gun control , support the effort in afghanistan and come from a small european country , with at most 10 of my countrymen on reddit . 
  other than that , liberal , atheist , know my way around it , 4channer and raised on cartoon network . 
  dude . 
  only because your country has two parties in the parliament does n't mean there is nothing to choose from . 
  you have tens of thousands of political parties and i 'm sure that if you look good enough you 'll find one that aligns with your ideals better than a fake news comedy show . 
  if people voted ** for ** a party , not ** against ** another one maybe you 'd have a healthier democracy . 
  as i said ... and you failed to register , you ca n't compare 1939 and 2009 , the situation is totally different . 
  intel is using dirty politics to control the netbook market , so it 's another loss for via , despite better tech . 
  the gun thing depends on the country , in most of them you can carry it with sufficient permits and enough proof you 're sane . 
  do you know what mad is ? 
  it is between blocks , poland is a part of one and can , via nato , get nuclear sharing and have nuclear weapons on its own soil . 
  even without that , it 's nato vs russia , not poland vs russia . 
  tell me , why is poland in nato and georgia is n't ? 
  why did anyone agree to let them in when such a shitstorm would happen ? 
  because nato itself is enough of a deterrent , and russia would n't even touch them . 
  read the article again , it 's a provocating war game where russia shows its teeth , like it does every once in a while . 
  today germany and finland escorted a russian fighter out of their airspace , it that an act of war ? 
  i do n't see any breaking news . 
  and if you want your answer , ok , here goes . 
  attack on poland is an attack on nato, 
   the parties of nato agreed that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all . 
  it is the front line against russia and an act of war against poland means that shit has hit the fan . 
  why would they let them in if they would n't do it ? 
  let 's widen the theory , would nato respond if turkey is attacked ? 
  germany ? 
  where would it end ? 
  russia knows this , and that 's why they wo n't touch poland , or any other nato country . 
  there are no precedents of nato leaving their members to bleed out , so why would that happen now ? 
  nato is a powerful force , not to fuck around with , so why the hell would russia risk this ? 
  half of nato member states are in eastern europe and their threat comes from russia , and i 'm still looking for a good , a solid reason why they would abandon one of their largest and most important members . 
  also , you 're using mad as an absolute must , a conventional war is possible too , but then again , i ca n't find a single reason why russia would attack them now . 
   to think that the world will risk a near apocalypse to save some government 's authority on some land division is beyond insane . 
  ok , poland is n't worth it . 
  what country is ? 
   and if poland strikes russia , 6,000 nukes are automatically launched on europe . 
  nobody even presses a button . 
  first , bullshit . 
  prove it . 
  second , that 's why we have mad , nobody does anything because every side is aware that the other could destroy it ( and itself ) . 
  you do n't make any sense . 
  270 is bad ? 
  it 's a state university and ca n't really be on the same list with the ones that get their funds from private sources . 
  why yes , thank you for asking . 
  i ca n't enter the us and ca n't get a visa because of something i said online years ago , and even if i could , it is an embarrasing and humiliating process which deters people from visiting . 
  fuck that , if they do n't want my money , i 'll spend it elsewhere .

  it 's not a good translation , but i think everyone can get the picture . 
  - dating, 
  - relationship, 
  what 's the difference ? 
  none of them use symbian , and you were thinking of s60 . 
  also , s60 phones are very popular in everywhere except the us and japan . 
  having 50 % of the market is somehow loosing ? 
  nokia has a wide range of phones since its early days , from cheap ones like this to smartphones , luxury phones , rugged phones ... 
  they make hundreds of phones , so this story is nothing special . 
  from a european point of view , the dating/relationship phases are the same thing . 
  if you 're dating it means you 're exclusive , and you 're in a relationship , but it can later become a long term thing where the toothbrush thing comes along . 
  i was n't thinking about emigrating , more like a tourist visit , seeing my relatives , so no representatives or lawyers , just a clerk in the embassy . 
  but your story is interesting . 
  i do n't think it sucks ( long time smartphone user , hundreds of phones under my belt ) but it needs some work done to follow the trends . 
  but it does n't matter , nokia has other plans for it . 
  i 'm fairly certain he was talking about pre 9/11 and post 9/11 , but ok , the plague is always a good argument . 
  you have to list your profession ? 
  how does that make any sense ? 
  it 's the us embassy , not my country . 
  `` hey rospaya , i just noticed you wrote `` losing '' wrong , so without acting like a jackass , i 'm suggesting you should edit that .
