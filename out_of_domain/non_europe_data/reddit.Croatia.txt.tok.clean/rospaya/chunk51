  that being said , where i live xbox 360 is n't available , i could get banned just because i 'm using it , modded or not . 
  the arcade costs more than $ 450 , the average game is about $ 120 and i get to use half of online services normal users can . 
  and then this douchebag complains about getting banned and expensive games ? 
  the average income where i live is $ 10k in a year , the uk is about $ 36k . 
  consider yourself luck you can own one , dumbass . 
   look how chummy we are with the germans and the japanse . 
  not really the same thing , the us had almost unlimited control over japan after the war and us civilian casulties were minimal , while nazi germany raped most of europe , killed millions , destroyed everything from culture to whole cities . 
  the same with japan and the far east . 
  i do n't eat out , have n't been to mcdonalds in ages and generally avoid fast food . 
  that 's a shallow and overly simplistic way to explain a very * very * complicated situation . 
  tdk is a great movie ( and tape ) , but i never felt like it was a batman movie . 
  maybe based on the comic , but with less batman and less dark atmosphere of gotham city than it should be . 
  then buy some open moko device ... 
  wait , this just in , they stopped making hardware devices because nobody is interested in this amount of freedom . 
  i let them use firefox which deletes everything after closing , and use opera sa my everyday browser ( which conveniently syncs 5000 + porn bookmarks to three places , just in case ) . 
   wore a pair of threadbare homer simpson-print boxers with stretched , ripply elastic in the waist . 
  mine are family guy , does that count ? 
  it sound awful . 
  yeah i use reddit , too . 
  probably the playstation generation . 
  89er myself . 
  let me be clear that , as a gadget lover , i was very excited about it , but full open source devices have a problem with getting enough support to get it rolling . 
  might be something about the fact that it 's harder for businesses to rape their customers . 
  there 's a sports subreddit ? 
  i 'm sorry , the correct question is : what is what what ? 
  beavis ? 
  absolutely not , never and in no circumstances . 
  you do have the best universities in the world ... because you have to pay for most of them . 
  i got into journalism a couple of months ago and paid a thousand dollars ( around one months pay ) , the largest fee for the year . 
  if i ranked better in the entrance exam i would n't have to pay anything or just a small amount . 
  when i read about student loans or how people in the states are in debt for years after college it makes me happy that i can get an education for virtually nothing . 
  their first album was the first cd i bought , it still has a special place in my collection . 
  no it will not . 
  as someone who used smartphones since the beginning ( and still claims that iphone = / = smartphone ) i can tell you now that this is not true . 
  most people still want calls + sms + battery life and do n't care about multitasking , syncing , apps and other stuff . 
  the market for them will get bigger , but it will never pass 50 % . 
  and hardware does n't have much to do with it , it 's the software . 
   i 'm not sure i can take you seriously . 
  please , argument yourself . 
   when the bottom barrel phones start having 600mhz processors we 'll no longer have this distinction between ` dumb phones ' and ` devices that can browse the internet , check email and play video games ' . 
  i see zero reason why a bottom barrel phone would have a 600 mhz cpu . 
  as i said , most people do n't give a flying fuck about e-mail on a phone and only care about calls + sms + battery life . 
  your perception ( north america i presume ? ), 
  is a bit distorted if you think otherwise , because the rest of the world is ahead of you in terms of smartphones , but understands the appeal of feature ( dumb ) phones , too . 
  and now : i own three phones . 
  all of them can have installed apps , i can surf the web like on the pc , listen to music , watch videos , check e-mail , sync , they all have some form of multitasking ... are they all smartphones ? 
  i 'll cheer for new zealand on the world cup , since [ croatia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia_football_team ) did n't qualify , despite being ** fucking 8th in the world ** . 
  but yea , we went from 125th to 3rd , so i guess we could do it again . 
  enjoy the band with the best name ever : [ the bambi molesters ] ( http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bambi+molesters&amp;search=search ), 
   25 % in europe, 
  currently 9 countries from europe are going . 
  there are 50 countries in europe . 
   45 % of teams of south america qualifying, 
  he 's a good driver and was there a couple of months ago so that part should n't be a problem . 
  the budget is a problem . 
  any tips on cheap accommodation , food , gas , alcohol ? 
  no , i 'm still pissed about the 2:2 in 2006 that we should have won . 
  i 'm not sure we have that in europe . 
  charlie brooker once said it tastes like crap , and i trust him . 
  we 're going to warsaw and we 'll probably couchsurf , there 's a solid selection . 
   they should be called pmp ( portable media players ), 
  they are . 
  thanks . 
  this is the tough part , we have a hard time controlling our jokes about his grandfather being there `` on holiday '' 60 or so years ago . 
  just kidding , i want to marry her . 
  i for one ca n't wait for natal , i 'll still play cod and world in conflict the way i did , but when i have friends over , when my parents ( who do n't know how to even hold a controller ) want to play i will bust out natal and have fun with it . 
  in the end , `` hardcore '' gamers bitch and whine over everything and get back to the same controls they used 20 years ago . 
  change happens , live with it . 
  if you do n't like natal do n't buy it , and by your comment it seems you do n't even own an xbox ... 
  god forbid i use a peripheral that is n't focused on the hardcore crowd . 
  i 'm so sorry , lordsovot , i 'll make my girlfriend love gears of war . 
  and we knocked you out of euro 2008 , so we 're even . 
  but seriously , the last game was a big loss for us , the only international game we lost on that stadium since croatia got independence . 
  i would n't say mindgames , he was just full of himself because the media saw him as the second coming of christ . 
  you ca n't really blame him , since he did n't get any criticism from home . 
  thanks , hope you had a good time . 
  that 's why i wo n't buy the wii and never even thought about it . 
  i do n't know if it will change gaming forever or if it will be the next big thing , but looking at the demo and reading people 's experiences it really looks nice . 
  and microsoft is smarter than turning the xbox into wii . 
  just look at it , it erases almost every filter that non-gamers have between the console and the person . 
  if it turns out as a gimmick , i 'll sell it , but i heard the same thing about guitar hero/rock band and i still have that old wired guitar . 
  but in case it ends up fun and practical ( even as a over-glorified eyetoy ) i 'll keep it and have fun . 
  i 'm confused as to why are you so negative ? 
  please , tell me with a straight face that it looks like a bad party game/device ? 
   and unless this thing is advanced enough to be able to differentiate between different people flailing their limbs about, 
  [ project natal can support multiple players , see fingers ] ( http://kotaku.com/5279531/microsoft-project-natal-can-support-multiple-players-see-fingers ) . 
  go read a few experiences about natal , you 'll change your mind . 
  some will use both , that 's the thing i 'm hoping for most . 
  i 've read his [ excellent ] ( http://books.google.com/books?id=pk3be8cvq4yc&amp;dq=galbraith+book+iraq&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s5gas9awgnmisaazv_yyda&amp;sa=x&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0cbeq6aewaw ) book about the war in iraq , about kurdistan , about saddam 's methods of dealing with them . 
  i recommend it . 
  galbright has a long humanitarian and diplomatic record which makes me uncomfortable to trust allegations like this at face value . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://greenmountaindaily.com/diary/5508/will-the-real-peter-galbraith-please-stand-up ) a fine analysis of this situation . 
  so , she gets off by reading ? 
  tony 's son in the sopranos . 
  the character is made so well ( like every other in the show ) that you just have to hate or despise him . 
  i 'm studying journalism , but i 'm planning to transfer to political science . 
  is this a good decision for somebody who wants to work in diplomacy , or some ngo like you are ? 
  god damn . 
  they really are . 
  what the hell man ?
