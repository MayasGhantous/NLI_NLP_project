  yes , the law i 'm criticizing here and which i believe is racist and discriminating . 
   no , in democratic countries when the majority of the population wants something , it is done . 
  there was a 55 % turnout , out of that 57 % of people voted for a ban , so please show me where do you see the majority of the population here . 
  so , out of 7,8 million swiss , 4,2 million voted , out of that 2,4 million voted for that , about 30 % of the total population . 
  they said that 40 000 practicing muslims ca n't have minarets , even though the four ones that exist now do n't call for prayer from them . 
  well , it 's a miracle i 'm alive now , i sometimes eat at a muslim restaurant in the local muslim community center ... 
  here 's a [ pic ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/zagreba\u010dka_d\u017eamija.jpg/450px-zagreba\u010dka_d\u017eamija.jpg ) of this demon institution . 
  the only problem i had now was to untie my shoes when entering the praying hall . 
  who says i do n't criticize it ? 
  i 'll criticize every country not recognizing basic human rights , the same way i 'll criticize people of every religion and color of skin that do n't act civilized . 
  swiss , or muslim i do n't care . 
  about 30 % of the swiss population voted for this , so tell me , is that democracy ? 
  how about [ 19 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/muslim_world#secular_states ) , not one ? 
  there ? 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't live in a muslim country , or in switzerland , i live somewhere where i ( white and nerdy ) can freely go into a mosque and look around without the fear of getting into trouble . 
  why the hell should i compare myself with someone intolerant ? 
  so what ? 
  again , why should i take rights from muslims in my country ? 
  because they take mine when i 'm there ? 
  that 's just revenge and a result of an eye for an eye mentality . 
  i do n't want to compare myself with the worst , but rather with the best . 
  the only bad experience i had in a muslim country is the food and roads . 
   no , because they would take your rights if there were enough of them . 
  so fucking what ? 
  do i have to spell it out for you ? 
  why should i take their rights just because they 'd take mine ? 
  there are less than 5 % of muslims in switzerland and around 10 % of them practise their religion . 
  how in the hell are they a threat ? 
  heh , i was thinking more about tunisia , i do n't look at bosnia as a muslim country , and about the food ... we can all agree that it 's awesome on both sides of the border , 
  well in that case we should kill those muslims . 
  by your words , those guys are pretty dangerous , and it seems that they can turn from less than one percent of the population to 100 % in no time . 
  radical , by that . 
  i 'm talking about practicing muslims in switzerland . 
   i dislike every immigrant that despises the country and culture he volunatrily moved to , but that does n't give us the right to discriminate against a whole religion just because we have a problem with a part of the people who worship it . 
   i 'll criticize every country not recognizing basic human rights , the same way i 'll criticize people of every religion and color of skin that do n't act civilized . 
  swiss , or muslim i do n't care . 
  read the rest too , it says minarets . 
  it precisely targets them , not all religious buildings , tall buildings or fake rockets . 
  stereotype , but smells like teen spirit by nirvana . 
  adam sandler and ( thin ) jack black ? 
  i 'd rather hear both sides of this story and then call someone a greedy fucktard . 
  hungarian ? 
  is n't kucinich part croatian ? 
  ah , i 'd rather not say since it could draw comments that `` band x sucks '' or similar . 
  i 'm not blaming it on a politician . 
  i 'm saying that sometimes you need to do the right thing , even though 30 % of the population ( which ends up as being the majority ) thinks something else . 
  it 's tenacious d. 
  the same stuff . 
  i started with rhcp , metallica , prodigy aad cheesy eurodisco ( it was popular damnit ! ) . 
  it progressed through classic rock and nirvana , and today it 's pixies , kyuss , the white stripes , r.e.m and pink floyd . 
  the thing that changed the most is broadening genres and stepping away from guitar riffs , also dumping some sucky bands like limp bizkit . 
  fuck everything about that !, 
  it 's interesting that with pixies , weezer and musicals i picked up iron maiden , motorhead and some slayer . 
  tablet pc , umpc , touchscreen pmp or internet pads ? 
  which of these do n't exist ? 
  i always liked the example that people gave , what about the civil rights movement ? 
  slavery ? 
  people did n't vote on that , and most would have voted against . 
  proposition 8 ? 
  what would it take to change the us constitution via referendum ? 
  what would you consider to be a fair referendum ? 
  this is what pisses me off , about 30 % of the voting population limited rights of a religious group . 
  that 's hardly fair . 
  sadako wants to live . 
  anyone read it ? 
  so ... bj clinton ? 
  being croatian , i shat my pants when i opened this page . 
  then again , i never thought about the symbolism behind this , krampus was a normal thing since i was a kid . 
  my parents always said that krampus will crap in my boot , outside of the regular \u0161iba i got every year . 
  journalist . 
  started with my own site , now it 's a magazine , and in between it was blogs . 
  give up . 
  no , really . 
  it has its advantages , but it 's not an easy job and you do n't get paid enough in most cases . 
  but , you know , * follow your dream and stuff *, 
  i like your wallpaper . 
  slovenia has a different situation , primarily concerning yugoslavia ( yugoslavs ) and the thing that you 're hardly alone in this situation , as i understand it there are a lot of mixed marriages there . 
  also , let 's not forget the erased ( izbrisani ) problem . 
  it depends on many things , but i can speak for croatia ... infrastructure is getting better every year and now there 's no problem with using airports , roads or ports , but i would n't recommend the train , most lines are still old , although they tend to be cheap . 
  violent crime ... 
  i ca n't say there 's none , but if you avoid strip clubs ( notorious ) and shady places with turbofolk music you should n't have any problems . 
  pickpocketing is the same , avoid shady places and people and you wo n't have any problems . 
  i spend hours in public transport every day and never had any problems . 
  tips ? 
  hm , check out zagreb . 
  that 's about all i can think of now . 
  no , it 's not bullshit . 
  europe did n't get the first wave of immigrants last year , we got it over 50 years ago , and some of them are still not integrating . 
  honestly , i do n't care that much about them integrating , only ** respecting ** our culture and obeying the law . 
  respecting , not necessarily adopting it . 
  no offense , but american culture ** is ** an immigration one , while we have not hundreds , but thousands of years of history we 're surrounded with every day . 
  it 's frustrating when someone ( muslim , black , swiss ... whatever ) comes and not only ignores that , but openly spits on it . 
  banning minarets is the wrong way to go . 
  yugoslavs , as in people that did n't have a nationality to identify with when yugoslavia did exist . 
  when i said slovenia has a different situation i was thinking about the discrimination against serbian and bosnian people ... 
  primarily because they were a part of the same country and were n't strangers in slovenia , but as your example shows , were n't really integrated 100 % . 
  and i think that erased citizens are relevant here , it shows how much the state helped to make the situation worse , by not recognizing people who lived there for years as citizens , thus deepening the discrimination . 
  and probably dug out , raped and shown on ogrish/rotten . 
  this is the internet , after all . 
  [ this ] ( http://football.guardian.co.uk/news_story/0,,2133614,00.html ) is a very interesting article on the subject of former yugoslav republics and football .
