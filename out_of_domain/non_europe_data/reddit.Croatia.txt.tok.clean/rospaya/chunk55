  but do n't have the same mindset . 
  you could say that he 's ... no stranger to love ? 
  that 's the thing , americans see the weapons as their right and wish to own them just because they can , not because there 's a good reason . 
  the tyranny argument has been done to death and it does n't make any sense . 
  yea , shit happens and in 90 % of cases they blame it on the judge and move on ... 
  but when eduardo may have simulated the fucking uefa is involved and everything in their power is made to punish him . 
  this game is ruined by fucking politics and big organizations . 
  screw you all with your precious groups and predictions . 
  / [ bitter croatia fan ] ( http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=m/fullranking.html ), 
  you 're right . 
  they are special movies in their own right , but it 's hard to recommend them . 
  yes , the song from mean girls . 
  we all thought of it , but someone 's got ta have the balls to say it . 
  the hold steady - boys and girls in america, 
  pink floyd - dark side of the moon, 
  the who - tommy, 
  jesus christ superstar and hair , too . 
  heh , they 're not really the same genre as the rest of them , it 's just an album that 's very easy for my generation to identify with . 
  the songs are structured in a way that it 's important to listen to all of them to get the whole story . 
  pixies -- broken face - 90,

  from [ my last.fm ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/rospaya2 ) . 
  friend me people , i 'm lonely . 
  i love holland , 1945 . 
  discovered nmh only weeks ago and i played that song too much . 
  the ... well i 'm born in 1989 so i guess that one . 
  is there a list of newspapers that will print it somewhere ? 
  thank you . 
  actually , we are . 
  opera . 
  regarding the meme . 
  i 'm a little sad it got out of our thick internet walls onto the general population ( civilians if you will ) . 
  it kinda lost its charm and humor . 
  yes , i know this is a hipster 's view on the situation , but when i see pelosi , macy 's and katy perry rickrolling me it looks really lame . 
  and the weird thing is i actually like the song . 
  one advice : put some holes in the package . 
  you ** do not ** want to have a corpse instead a bride . 
  you look really irish . 
  oh , question ... what is your argument against people who say that politicians are all the same ? 
  bolek i lolek were and still are very popular in croatia . 
  context ? 
  it looks great . 
   one more thing : we did not have twitters , facebooks or that kind of stuff . 
  to talk to someone , you had to call him , send him mail or visit him . 
  the way communication has evolved always impresses me . 
  i 'm 20 and i remember that times . 
  i love kotaku , despite what people say . 
  but that story was fucking idiotic . 
  the mtv thing , katy perry was the host . 
  i 'd give you a link , but it 's not available in my country . 
  thanks . 
  i 've got a cheap tablet that works fine , but i 'm having problems finding some tutorials on drawing tips . 
  great . 
  now my flying car please . 
  i guess i 'm the only one who thought that the movie was boring and predictable . 
  and i had very high hopes . 
  really ? 
  i always kinda laughed at that scene . 
  not that i 'm desensitized , but the movie is n't exacty serious . 
  i live in a 90 % catholic country so i never heard the `` happy holidays '' thing , but i do n't see where the problem is . 
  as an atheist i do n't get offended on `` merry christmas '' , i too celebrate it , but as a family holiday , not religious . 
   he also has an honorary doctorate from uea . 
   you know , the climategate university . 
  the what ? 
   ** my ** university . 
  ooooh , that one !, 
  i ca n't believe some people still think that the un is a supernational government trying to overthrow the us one and take a piss on the constitution . 
  at this stage it 's mostly an impotent institution full of bureaucrats who ca n't do shit because * someone * is blocking them . 
  so in a nutshell , learn a language , how to play a guitar and read a book and then i can get laid ? 
  going to the library as i type this ... 
  thanks . 
  i usually get to -5 when saying that i do n't like the hurt locker . 
  the un is n't meant to be so powerful as to have a `` world president '' or any other class of world commisioner . 
  it 's an organization , not the supreme ruler of the planet . 
  also , i take offence at being called a wingnut . 
  i think the un is a very noble idea and is an organization that has brought and will continue to bring a lot of good to people . 
  but it 's a fact that imperialist nations ( * cough * chinafrancerussiaukusa * cough * ) choose to ignore the decision they do n't like . 
  well we should fire the world president dude because he 's doing a shitty job . 
  really people , let 's hear some fact , not just `` you 're wrong '' . 
  quote me the part of the un charter , link to events , show me some evidence that i 'm wrong . 
  on the other hand , there are four people who think that the un is trying to overthrow the us government , so maybe i 'm asking for a too high degree of conversation here . 
  come to the balkans man , we have rivalries between every house , city , region and country . 
  that 's why you get drunk with beer before going on vodka . 
  so i should show proof that there is n't a world president ? 
  i should show you citations that the un is n't an international government that feeds on innocent americans blood ? 
  unless you 're willing to move to zagreb , croatia ... no . 
  although it 's free or very near free , and living here is cheap . 
  [ sadako wants to live ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sadako_wants_to_live ), 
  got downmodded for this the other day . 
  do n't know why . 
  if you do n't care or do n't have strong feeling about it ... why not ? 
  i 'm an atheist , but got all catholic formalities done , baptism included . 
  all i got out of it was another member of my family ( my godfather ) who acts as a second father of sorts . 
  like i said about christmas ... 
  it 's more of a family tradition than a religious holiday . 
  actually i knew , but the joke was worth it . 
  yeah , i know , but i was talking from an atheist point of view ...
