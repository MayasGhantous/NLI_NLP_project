  although rarely anyone cares about insulting us . 
  first , the hype . 
  i saw reviews , i saw people on reddit getting very hyped over it . 
  my expectations were pretty high . 
  then when i saw it ( there 's a story behind that , my whole family waited an hour for me to download it because a guy on reddit said that it 's worth it . 
  they were all in the car , ready to go on holiday ) i was dissapointed with the ramboesque main character , his arrogance and bad boy style . 
  the whole movie was predictable and just a series of edgy scenes . 
  the bomb defusing scenes were intense , but that did n't make it for me . 
  i just saw on wikipedia that the movie is almost universally acclaimed ... 
  i guess i 'm just missing something . 
  should i watch it again ? 
  yes :(, 
  my girlfriend does n't like google and has yahoo as her homepage . 
  not only as a search engine , but for news , too . 
  except when you 're a pussy , like me . 
  vodka tastes like crap , that 's why i get tipsy with something light before getting shitfaced . 
  on the other hand , i do n't drink vodka unless it 's the only thing around . 
  i love the last rage face . 
  european . 
  nationality : croatian, 
  pretty people like human stuff , like us !, 
   we 're not talking about mordor or the galactic empire here buddy, 
  um , i thought we were talking about music companies ? 
  they 're probably the next thing to hell on earth . 
  you mean switzerland ? 
  i actually envy the us for their bars . 
  the only bars we have here are :, 
  a ) old smelly bars where old people go to drink and eventually die, 
  b ) a regular bar where people drink coffee or a beer and talk to friends, 
  c ) clubs , or `` discos '' as you call them, 
  d ) the best one : beer taverns, 
  we do n't have the american version of a bar as a place to go with friends and get drunk . 
  i know the eastern european stereotype : we 're not a part of europe . 
  actually , it 's not the most popular tourist destination in croatia ... 
  i think dubrovnik is . 
  but then again i read it in the newspaper , so i could be wrong . 
  ( also , i 'm croatian and have never been to plitvice , although i passed the lakes hundreds of times and traveled across the rest of the country ), 
  what did you think of zagreb ? 
  the coastline is constantly praised , but i 'm in love with zagreb ... not just because i live here . 
   he busted through the dutch doors, 
  til what a [ dutch door ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dutch_door ) is . 
  you should record this text with a microphone , really fast and angry and embed it in a flash video with bad ms paint art in the background . 
  i was just bitching the other day how i destroy two pairs of headphones every 6 months and i 'm sick of it . 
  since only in ear headphones fit in my ears , i 'm forced to buy expensive ones time and again . 
  i do n't abuse them , i try not to stress them and bam !, 
  the left one does n't work . 
  my friend makes fun of me because he uses the same ones for about two years , with no problems . 
  i mostly use sony , koss and sennheiser , but i 'm gon na buy philips this time . 
  any suggestions ? 
  all the fucking time . 
  nigga ( substituted by ` man ' ) , you just went full retard . 
  i just do n't dig on < topic of conversation  , that 's all . 
  that 's 30 minutes away . 
  i 'll be there in 10 . 
  also , i 'm gon na test if my girlfriend is cool enough . 
  i 'm gon na say `` i love you pumpkin '' , if she does n't reply `` i love you honey bunny '' it 's fucking over . 
  edit : english is not my first language , but i say it in english anyway . 
  i 'll report back on this . 
  austro-hungarian empire for you !, 
  they sell oreos outside the us ? 
  only in the us . 
  edit : joke people , i 'm joking . 
  i hate this ... look better for a good politician , then you would n't have to nominate your actors , comedians and writers . 
  i own several chomsky ' books , and i 'm currently studying on a political science university so i know what you 're trying to say . 
  and i know what you 're missing . 
  people constatntly say they want colbert to run , and in the last couple of months that calls have become less humorous and more serious . 
  that pisses me off , because the only thing people know about him are his stances on some issues , and virtually nothing else ( politics wise ) . 
  now , i do n't have anything against him , but calls like that reek of cheap populism by people who make them . 
  hey , i like chomsky . 
  but i have more benchmarks for a future president , not only the ideological one . 
  i 'm still waiting for the joke from the title ... 
  whoa . 
  i opened a couple of tabs from reddit , and thought i was on the story [ where the guy writes that he became a dad ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/adctd/just_wanted_to_let_you_know_that_i_became_a_dad/ ) , and i saw this :, 
   i just found out this morning and i 've had a few drinks to ease the pain , so please pardon any typos . 
  and yes there are kids involved . 
  ** not ** what i expect of a new dad . 
  upvoted for making people think they 're pedophiles just for reading about tiny prepubescent vaginas . 
  i did this . 
  and numerous other stuff . 
  my school had a strict no cellphone policy , but i always had mine because i went to work after school and the lockers were n't safe for keeping them . 
  it was on silent or completely off , but there were checks a couple of times every week . 
  they busted me and i shoved the whole phone down my pants ( it was in my sock when they found it ) and offered to the professor to take it . 
  i got sent home and my parents had to come to school . 
  all the other kids did it after that and the dumb policy was overturned to `` cellphones allowed , but if we see them we take them '' . 
  note : there 's not much about adobe here . 
  well you can use macr ... ooohhh . 
  macs have four key shortcuts ? 
  not trolling , i do n't use a mac so it just odd to see this . 
  it 's not really permission , they 'll get married one way or the other . 
  it 's just a heads up for the family , and a chance to get their blessing ... 
  if they say no , fuck 'em , if they say yes - great . 
  tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of * thisisover 's * life . 
  his breakfast will taste better than any meal you and i have ever tasted . 
  crap . 
  i 've seen more `` worst movies of the decade '' than `` best movies of the decade '' . 
  also , pluto nash and freddy got fingered were great . 
  source please ? 
  as jello would say ... 
  kill kill kill the poor . 
  yeah , i heard they ** love ** baby pictures .
