  it was dirt cheap a couple of years ago when i was there . 
  rather up-down-up-down-up-down-up ... 
  i 'm from croatia , we had the ban a couple of months ago and it was repealed . 
  although i support it , it was implemented very poorly , and everyone knew it would n't last because the government is very unpopular and decisions like this only make it worse . 
  they do n't have the balls to stick through unpopular legislation if it 's the right thing ... 
  it was a smoking ban in interior service areas , as bars , restaurants and similar . 
  disgusted ? 
  why ? 
  cp and gore are rare these days , even on / b / , and i frequent / k / , / tv / , / g / and / mu / , where you could only get offended by lousy trolling and not unwanted material . 
  words offend only when they have meaning behind them . 
  being called a fag by my friend or girlfriend would be a joke , being called a fag by a stranger on the street would be an offense . 
  let 's not be shallow and superficial . 
  let 's look at things in context and perspective . 
  [ where is my mind ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zp1ijgso_e ) by the pixies . 
  girlfriend in my lap , watching our favourite movie for the 20th time . 
  i actually had an equilibrium during the last scene of fight club , when where is my mind started playing . 
  um , your copy of the movie leathal weapon , right ? 
  not a euphemism for something ? 
  1 out of 23 ... not sure if that 's good . 
  thanks for the info . 
  i was in prague 2-3 years ago and outside of the beautiful city , the memory that stuck to me most was searching for a place to buy beer in the middle of the night . 
  i have a weird sense of navigation and my friends were pissed as hell that even after a couple of hours of searching for a store on the outskirts of prague - we could n't find some beer . 
  after encounters with some skinheads , hobos and other nightly creatures we found the tesco . 
  it was a huge store , with at least 5 employees on every one of us . 
  i remember taking a shitload of beer on the counter and worrying if we had enough money . 
  when the cashier converted it to euros - i paid for everything . 
  kinda sad that the thing i remember the most is cheap beer ... 
  anyway , a budweiser in croatia is almost 60 kc ( around 18 kn ) . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jh4er.jpg ) the morning after . 
   from japan . 
  redundant . 
  you are welcome . 
  it is a great game , best in the series . 
  it 's over . 
  we can close this down . 
  i actually came out of the theatre disappointed . 
  i was n't the only one , but most people have a problem saying that because the universal sentiment is , well ... 
   that was goddamn awesome, 
  will we talk about the `` terrorist '' threat to the us in the same way ? 
  red dawn ? 
  but yes , i love alternate history movies . 
  this would be a great political thriller , something like the [ world in conflict ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_in_conflict ) story . 
  - russia wo n't , at any point , join nato . 
  they do n't have it as a goal , nato does n't consider it in the long run , and the basic truth is that nato is still the same thing it was during the cold war - primarily an organization made for scaring or stopping the russians from entering europe . 
  - israel and morocco wo n't be a part of the eu in the next 10 years , but maybe later . 
  they are n't suitable on geographic , but other grounds too . 
  that 's why france started the mediteranian union that would be a light and less strict expansion of the eu that would include countries that want to get in but lack the consensus or reforms . 
  - turkey has a slim chance of getting before 2020 . 
  some reforms are too strong to carry , and cyprus , human rights and too much resistance from some countries is a problem . 
  - ukraine may join the eu at one point , but not soon . 
  after bulgaria and romania the standards are becoming higher and the last countries to enter before serious eu reforms will be croatia and iceland ( unless switzerland wants to get in , and they do n't ) , with macedonia , serbia and montenegro on a strong maybe . 
  it wo n't enter nato . 
  russia would never let them and it 's too much of a risk . 
  - nato will become looser as eu gains unity and a single foreign policy . 
  it will just remain an instrument to remain on european soil . 
  the superpowers will get more devided , with the us and eu ( with japan , australia , south korea ... ) on one side and china and russia on the other . 
  i 'm not predicting a new cold war , but sides will be chosen again , but this time it will be more about economy and less about military . 
  - china and eu will remain stronger in the economic sense , while russia and the us will remain the sole military superpowers . 
  india and brazil will rise , but remain strong only in their regions . 
  your not here a long time , are you ? 
  yes , it 's a great show . 
  i still do n't think it can happen . 
  the war with georgia solidified russia 's stance against nato and the whole superpower/bloc setting , and has made itself clear after that that it wo n't let nato near its borders . 
  well , nearer . 
   the dollar is worthless . 
  are these 2008 predictions ? 
  i read you comment first :(, 
  stalker , not lurker . 
  your using an awful lot of energy to distance yourself , mister stalky mcstalk !, 
  let 's just say i watched it two times in the cinema , because i want to give them more money . 
  since you 're the guy in the know , answer me this : i hate votka , do n't like to drink it and if by any chance i do i get a splitting headache , which i do n't get from other booze . 
  i hate it mostly because it smells like gasoline and tastes like shit . 
  am i buying the wrong brand ? 
  drinking it in the wrong temperature ? 
  what am i doing wrong ? 
  not to say he could have been killed in the process . 
  using cuba as an example here pisses me off . 
  actually , you hinting at the use of force to install a favorable regime angers me more . 
  cuba is a represive and non free country , we can all agree on that , but people there are living fine considering the sanctions and their lenght . 
  children are not dying on the street , there is food and there are schools . 
  and you ( if you did n't advocate that , i 'm sorry ) would send an army , fight a war that ** will ** kill people to bring freedom of speech ? 
  to free political prisoners ? 
  i 'm not sure you understand the value of a human life and how much this freedom of speech if worth when you do n't have anything to eat . 
  in a system where the only metric a society has is monetary value people can die of hunger , cold and diseases much easier than in cuba today . 
  unlike some , i would trade my `` liberty '' to talk shit about the government for a society in which people do n't die because they do n't have enough money in a blink of an eye . 
  the fact that a government with limited power and reach invited the soviets does n't change the fact that a shitstorm ensued . 
  the only thing it changes is the legality of such an action , and semantics of calling it an invasion . 
  considering the region it is in , international interventions in the last couple of centuries and the fact that it has little to offer economically ( in comparison with china ) , i think iran is doing well . 
  i 'm not a fan of ahmadinejad ( although he has great facial hair ) , but the media perception of iran is skewed ever since he got into power . 
  not denying the problems you mentioned , but iran has n't really showed that it 's hard to trust any more than china . 
  paramilitary units kill people on the streets there too , but some backward region in china is n't exactly important in the grand media scheme of things . 
  so ... why is it the greatest ever ? 
  did he get to see the code ? 
  what was so special about it ? 
   turbo-folk, 
  i 'm very , very sorry . 
  black rebel motorcycle club, 
  context ? 
  what does it have to do with ** world ** politics ? 
  disco ball,
