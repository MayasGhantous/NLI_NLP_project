  90 % of games where i live are $ 80 or more . 
  for the lazy : [arstechnica.com ] ( http://arstechnica.com/ ), 
  both engadget and gizmodo hate nokia . 
  as do most us centric blogs . 
  uh ... no man . 
  techcrunch is full of shit . 
  that 's actually genius . 
  getting implants with explosives , you can have them for years and then when the moment comes activate them with some close range device or a chemical reaction . 
  not really . 
  arstechnica is good , wired is n't bad . 
  but you 'll always have to sift through apple bias . 
  you do n't know the half of it . 
  after utter humiliation at the embassy , let 's say you get the visa , then you 're picked `` at random '' in the airport , lose half of your stuff and get the other half wrecked ... 
  welcome to the us . 
  my dad went in the early 90s and again two years ago . 
  he said that it 's a beautiful country with great people , but that when he 's being treated like non human cattle it 's not worth it . 
  oh he 's not just * any * wanker , this wanker got a quote on cnn !, 
  ( come on , let him be happy for a day ), 
  how about from a european country ? 
  a person who traveled half of the world on business and has the visa sponsored by a us company ? 
  does a person then have to piss in a cup in an embassy ? 
  get expensive gear broken by the tsa ? 
  half a million us tourists enter my country every year without a blink , and i have to be treated like shit and then get my visa refused ? 
  screw it . 
  oh yes , too late to compete with 45 % of the market . 
  [ this ] ( http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_koqp09zlgz1qa0s4oo1_400.png ) one is great . 
  yes and no . 
  i interviewed a guy from nokia who said , about a year ago , that there will be two platforms , but both will be compatible and have the same framework . 
  i 'm guessing maemo for n900 style communicators and s60 for regular smartphones . 
  the market expanded and two big players entered an arena that was with little competition before . 
  45 % is great . 
  you spelled the url wrong . 
  iama request : jesus christ, 
  never saw anyone selling their cd 's in the streets in zagreb . 
  where did you get it ? 
  oh this is just bullshit . 
  i dislike china 's policies as the next guy , but fucking decide what system you want to live in . 
  in capitalism companies have one goal only : money , and to get there they pick the easiest possible way that does n't break the law of the country they do business in . 
  then why do i have to do this , in a european country ? 
  yup . 
  i 've been at the tunnel , but just at an ungodly hour so it 's not unusual that nobody was there . 
  you 're a tourist or local ? 
  local as well . 
  you 're the 11th guy from zagreb on reddit . 
  not that i 'm counting , 
   i 'll take bono over madonna any day . 
  i 'd take hell over both of them . 
  i actually love [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3dwblou--e ) song . 
  three stories :, 
  1 ) with my girlfriend on my lap for new years , watching fight club and cuddling . 
  my ex as of a week ago :(, 
  2 ) lying behind high school in the grass at three in the morning , when i heard nirvana for the first time . 
  3 ) while volunteering on an island in the middle of nowhere we got drunk on my birthday on a beach , watching the sun go down and then up . 
   people like that sicken me . 
  harsh words . 
  where i live people live at home practically until they get married or get a very cushy job , because renting is expensive and most people own a place ( which is easier to get when living with someone ) . 
  most people move out in their late 20 's . 
  people who have their own place at 22 are extremely rare . 
  fucking pbs always doing shit . 
  except paying for most of my school , subsidising my food and transport , and paying for my healthcare i do n't see the direct influence of the government in day to day life any more than americans . 
  on some grounds we 're less orwellian . 
  i can drink in the street at age 18 and have sex when 15 ( or 14 , i 'm not sure they changed the law ) . 
  i was there about two years ago . 
  the thing that pissed me off the most were street hagglers trying to sell me stuff , sometimes too violently . 
  sorry , it 's just hard to relate to a situation where stuff like that is n't normal . 
  i saw the qualifiers , but i wanted to point out that the situation is n't the same in every country or culture . 
  renting a place costs too much and most people buy a single house or apartment in their life where they live until they die , and unless you 've got a well paying steady job , that 's not possible until you marry someone which happens in the late twenties . 
  trust me , there is n't a single thing i would want more right now than to have my own place , but it 's simply not possible . 
  mrasshole is right , there are other countries and other conditions other than the one you live in . 
  except when watching british movies , that accents can be unbearable . 
  edit : i 'm not from the us and i do n't know why anyone thinks that . 
  but i challenge people to watch snatch or trainspotting without subtitles . 
   the balkan nations remain something of a special ( and rather deranged ) case, 
  which does n't mean the government has a different level of involvment . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/aypek/dear_european_redditors_what_is_the_governments/c0k30gy ) is the croatian perspective . 
  be free to tell that to any american fellow who claims otherwise , my language is croatian . 
  we already have that , it 's called the lottery . 
  * alternate punchline *, 
  we already have that , it 's called the stock market . 
  i see everything like that . 
  is there a list somewhere ? 
  i 'd like to know how much my 10k is really worth when the karma for cash program starts . 
  let me guess ... you went there from the article about that unclaimed land on antartica ? 
  because the iphone comes with an internet plan , most phones do n't . 
  every mobile os has its bright spots , but wm gets a lot of hate because it needs a fair amount of work to get it working well . 
  depending on what phone you have , you could hack the crap out of it , install a good browser , bend it the way you like and then you 'll enjoy it more . 
  but yes , i 'm doing the android switch soon , i think my needs changed and i need something internet centric but open enough to play with . 
  i 'd take a wm phone but i think android is worth learning about . 
  well ... 
  i did . 
  from [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/aywo9/marie_byrd_land_approximately_three_times_the/ ) story . 
  oh yes , [ the fucking divers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grkxz7_kfhg ) . 
  then call it the american series . 
  world series really sounds dickish . 
   now comes the trick : if you make 400 things making $ 1 a day , you will be making $ 12.000 a month . 
  this is the mental repositioning that needs to be made to follow this strategy . 
  it 's not about how to make a lot of money with a project , it becomes a matter of how to optimise your time and selected projects so that you can make 400 of them within the shortest possible period . 
  wise .
