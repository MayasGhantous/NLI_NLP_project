  this is where my phone comes in handy , i go to reddit and rub the qwerty keyboard away . 
  but when i have an assigment ( i 'm a journalist ) it 's always in the last minute , streching deadlines and procrastinating on reddit . 
  in the end , you just have to sit down and do shit . 
  i 've got a question . 
  let 's say i get sick and need to go to the hospital . 
  i call 911 ( which is a government or local service if i 'm right ) and where do they take me ? 
  the nearest hospital ? 
  are hospitals private or what ? 
  are they owned by insurance companies or are they just funded by them ? 
  do you have a lower tier service , or does it start with hospitals ? 
  by comparison , where i live ( croatia ) , hospitals are owned by the state and everyone is insured although you still have to pay for a fraction of the cost ( full blood test , ct , ecg , eeg was around $ 20 ) , unless you 're a student , senior citizen or poor in which case you get it for free ( there 's a flat fee of $ 10 monthly if you do n't fall into those categories , if you want ) . 
  [ these ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5neci.jpg ) are my insurance cards . 
  in case of an emergency you go to a hospital , but every neighbourhood has a , in lack of better translation , a `` health house '' , where you have your family doctor , dentist , x-ray and other basic stuff . 
  i have two of those withing 5 minutes of walking distance . 
  then again , you 're free to use a private service , like some people do . 
  i use a private dentist ( the state pays for it , i pay for special stuff , but only small change ) but i could use a private clinic if i wanted , where the state pays for some costs . 
  that 's my favourite way of doing it , make the notes and just connect them into coherent sentenses later . 
  good luck . 
  right ? 
  ** right ?!, 
  i guess she ... 
  * puts on sunglasses *, 
  ... got on my horse . 
  [ this ] ( http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map ) frightens me . 
  whoa . 
  talk about good responce . 
  thanks . 
  nope , she really hated me . 
  expelled me from the class a year or two later , never had good grades at her subjects ( and geography is what i 'm best at ) and just generally did n't like me . 
  my eventual success was n't because of her , or in spite of her , the words did n't really had much effect on me then . 
  nope , but i 'll upload it somewhere and pm you . 
  copy/paste from an [ old ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/aej8z/gaming_reddit_whats_the_most_dastardly_thing/c0h6yke ) thread . 
  ** not ** me . 
   in sims 3 , i created a character and put her in a really nice house . 
  open floor plan , kitchen overlooking the dining room , tastefully gardened , all very nice . 
  i would have her go out and find someone to invite over , and when they would return i would take out all the doors . 
   my sim would then begin the process of wooing them , which in the sims does n't take long at all . 
  that night , they 'd woohoo ( yes , woohoo ) in her palatial bed . 
  this was crucial to the betrayal . 
   the next morning , the erstwhile lover would awaken and prepare breakfast , and take it to the only chair in the house to eat it . 
  unfortunately , this chair was located in a small , glass-walled , metal-floored room in the middle of the house . 
   they 'd soon discover i 'd removed the door behind them . 
  my sim would awaken to find their lover caught in the trap , but instead of helping them , she would instead begin to paint their anguished cries for help on a nearby easel . 
   i managed to create a few actually very haunting paintings of the lover sims in their death throes . 
  they decorate the walls of the black widow 's bedroom , as a grisly warning to all who 'd enter . 
  i saw the trailer , hate horror movies , but i guess it 's enough of a thriller to like it . 
  for the life of me i ca n't fucking see him . 
  i 'm just frustrated because we did n't see any proof . 
  plenty of people get paid to post stuff on reddit , and plenty of people do it for their sites , which is not wrong in any way . 
  she , as a moderator , has the power to block submissions that could be spam , and she could use that power for evil , blocking the competition . 
  but we have yet to see an instance where she did something like that , and the community jumped on the hate bandwagon even though she publicly stated that she 's in the business many moons ago ( the one i remember was during the jetblue thing ) . 
  the beauty of reddit is that we have the power to upvote stuff we like and downvote the stuff we do n't like , and that 's the most important thing of all . 
  people can try to game us , but front page submissions usually have hundreds of comments in which anyone can warn us about it . 
  you ( and everyone else stating * every single person * ) are thinking too narrow . 
  as many other redditors , i live in a country where owning a firearm is n't considered normal and not many people do it ( my country had a recent war so that makes an exception for a certain demographic ) , especially in cities . 
  with a homicide rate of 1,6 per 100k ( the city i live in has the population of austin , columbus or jacksonville , which have 3.1 , 14.5 , and 14.3 homicides per 100 000 people . 
  we had 1.2 ) and a low crime rate , i do n't need it and do n't want it . 
  reading comments on reddit tells me that many americans need and want firearms , and i guess that 's ok , you have your cultural and historic reasons , we have ours , so respect the difference , because i will . 
  that being said , i know how to use a gun just because of the armchair general in me , but 90 % of people i know that are my age have n't seen a gun except on a policeman or a soldier . 
  i liked body of lies and catch me if you can , but i ca n't stand his acting and do n't like his looks . 
  just checked some statistics ... ny has 6,3 murders per capita . 
  very near pakistan and sri lanka . 
  the only reaction i have is wow . 
  i could n't stand living in a city with so much crime . 
  as i mentioned before , except getting a car radio stolen more than 10 years ago ( and a bike ) , my extended family have n't seen any crime since i was born , despite living in a city with a million people . 
  in yugoslavia too . 
  my mom claims that she could still take apart an [ m70 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zastava_m70 ) and put it back together , any time of the day . 
  yugoslavia had threats from both sides in the cold war ( shot down us planes ** and ** had soviet troops on the border ) so any attack would deadly and the army could n't protect the border , so a militia-like doctrine was made up in which the general population was trained for defense , guerilla style . 
  the weapons were contained in local caches . 
  yugoslavia had one of the strongest armies in europe , and with this had a good chance to defend itself from outside threats . 
  inside - well ... we saw what happened . 
  not really . 
  most europeans view firearms as something they would rather not deal with , even in situations where it would be useful . 
  as i said before , a ** lot ** of europeans wo n't ever use a gun or will want to . 
  the automatic/manual analogy does n't really fit here , but i guess i 'm wasting time trying to explain something you 're born and live with , and do n't learn . 
  it 's a cultural thing . 
  i do n't expect you to get it . 
  the transmission thing is just trolling as far as i 'm concerned . 
   or does it just not fit into your narrow world view ? 
  i 'm narrow ? 
  let me quote myself :, 
   reading comments on reddit tells me that many americans need and want firearms , and i guess that 's ok , you have your cultural and historic reasons , we have ours , so respect the difference , because i will . 
  the reasons i posted the statistics is to prove that i have no reason to keep a gun except maybe for recreation , but that 's pretty rare except in rural parts of the country . 
  i was n't trying to make the correlation , just mentioned it for illustrating the low need for a weapon . 
  the main reasons for crime are socioeconomic , imo . 
   either you have no guns or you allow the populace to have easy access to them . 
  except for a few tests and a policeman coming home to talk to me and my neighbours , i can get a gun pretty easy . 
  it just that i do n't want to . 
  i 'd always rather get mugged than carry a gun . 
  my friends think that 's normal , but i 've see americans having their jaws on the floor after this statement . 
  if jealousy were my standard for movies , i 'd just watch the hunchback of notre-dame over and over . 
   would you rather get stabbed than carry a gun ? 
  would you rather be kidnapped and raped than carry a gun ? 
  do n't ridicule me , we both know there 's a limit . 
  with 10 people getting killed in my city the last year , and most of them being gangsters shooting at each other and neighbours having drunken fights , i 'm not scared for my life . 
  i could get beaten up , but then again there 's a plethora of non-lethal weapon i could carry , if i were afraid of that . 
  but i 'm not . 
  walking at night , even in nasty neighbourhoods is n't that big of a deal , and if you 're not asking for trouble , you wo n't find it , at least in 99 % of the cases . 
  please , convince me why should i get a gun . 
   so , is it close-minded or not ?
