  when downloading it from torrents , i would prefer at least 160 or 192 kbps . 
  i can notice the difference between 128 kbps and let 's say 256 , but with the equipment and situations i listen to music , it does n't matter much . 
  rites of spring , maybe fugazi and husker du ? 
   the chili peppers ripped majorly off funk . 
  they mixes rock and punk with funk , they did n't rip off anything . 
  they 're popular ? 
  what ? 
  edit : i like their music , but outside the two music videos i never heard about them irl . 
  no one will ever believe you, 
  i had my whole savings in dollars , pre-9 / 11 . 
  today i 've got crap . 
  1 ) walking home from a night of drinking . 
  the streets are empty , i 'm buzzed and listening to music and singing . 
  it 's great , cathartic . 
  2 ) beer , jazz and sim city 3000 . 
  i use this one daily . 
  um , the insult . 
  very good article , although i listened to most of that i know what i 'll be downloading later . 
  also very glad they included husker du . 
  there could have been more modern albums , maybe boys and girls in america from the hold steady , or american idiot from green day . 
  red hot chili peppers were against itunes on this one , but eventually lost . 
  i do n't know to who or how . 
  i have a couple of albums that ** need ** to be listened to in one piece , but i do n't put them on my player because they end up in shuffle or something . 
  i 'd wish players had an `` exclude from library '' function , or at least something that i do n't need to make new playlists for every time i transfer music . 
  or upvotes ? 
  not really a fetish , but ... freckles , but not too many . 
  nerdy glasses . 
  lisp ( when they ca n't say r ) . 
  but the biggest turn on , smart girls . 
  that 's not a mac . 
  well they 're all awesome movies . 
  i do n't really :(, 
  it smells like pure alcohol and i get a fucking headache the next morning ( which i do n't get with beer or wine ) . 
   i think 80 % of modern music sucks balls, 
  that 's just common sense . 
  - i was the only person in my class whose first computer was n't a pc or mac . 
  or any computer . 
  - i found my old walkman the other day . 
  looked online and saw it 's about 15 years old . 
  - yesterday i was checking out some girls in front of a school in the neighbourhood and realized that it 's illegal . 
  and i 'm only 20 :(, 
  he mad, 
  do n't worry , europeans do n't know about galaxy too . 
  i 'm torn between a lol and rage . 
  man , two months ... 
  anyway , i made a lot of mixtapes in my life , and i made one to impress a lady . 
  she was impressed but did n't have anything to play it on . 
  then it struck me that the cassette is dead . 
  fabricated panic . 
  a conflict between two modern states like the uk and argentina is far fetched and implausible although i 'm sure there will be some more tensions . 
  what do you consider victory ? 
  installing a friendly governemnt ? 
  allowing free elections ? 
  killing every last taliban ? 
  end of military operations ? 
   that 's what they said last time around . 
  but you 've got to admit that the circumstances are really different . 
  i do n't know who the woman is , but this interview is complete bullshit and historic revisionism obviously biased towards one side . 
  watched the movie for the fifth time yesterday and came to the same conclusion , every line seems great for quoting . 
  it ended as a great night , i put the torrent on download and played gta iv and drank beer until it finished . 
  guy ritchie made it . 
  upvotes for all . 
  submit this to a couple of other subreddits , it 's a great article . 
  feelsgoodman, 
  i guess that we use the crowd of reddit users , someone maybe knows someone or his friend or his agent , or the celebrity in question * is * a redditor ... 
  but i guess that in most cases the reddit crew or someone else just calls some publicists , managers or something . 
  reminds me of [ murder most horrid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murder_most_horrid ) and the annoying intro song . 
  are you * sure * you 're a woman ? 
  i 've got some friends that find some of the movies you listed as too `` macho '' . 
  it was the movie we watched on the night we started dating :(, 
  how i just * loooove * sarcastic politics articles . 
  ( hint : i do n't ), 
  because it 's not a typical beatles song . 
  about fucking time . 
  the sheepfuckers will get what they deserve . 
  i 'm from the balkans , probably the most hated region on the earth . 
  give ** me ** the chance to hate somebody else . 
  i 'm sure there 's a difference between buying hundreds of thousands of uniforms , weapons and other equipment and buying hundreds . 
  not to mention specialization , foreign suppliers and so on . 
  why would you link that ? 
  wait until sasha baron cohen puts his wig down and reveals himself as sarah palin . 
   yours sincerely ,, 
  [ in case you do n't know what aipac is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aipac ) . 
   because it 's our country . 
  ok , if you live there i get that . 
  but what about american jews ? 
  european jews ? 
  any other jews that do n't live in israel and still defend it ? 
  when i do military service for my country i have to pledge alliegence to it and promise to defend it from any attacks . 
  what do jews out of israel do ? 
  pledge alliegence to two countries ? 
  sit on two different seats ? 
  love a country they were n't born or live in ? 
  i 'm the least nationalistic person you 'll find here , but i do n't find this behaviour normal or logical . 
  man . 
  people from my country did nasty shit , and we apologized for the sins of our grandfathers . 
  but israel has been doing this for 50-60 years . 
  this is n't `` oh shit we fucked up '' , but a constant barrage of international criticism for the last half century . 
  not everyone in israel is like that , everyone with half a brain knows that , but i could n't stand to share the same air with people who keep enabling this aggression for years and years . 
  yes , palestinians are not saints here , and i 'm not implying that .
