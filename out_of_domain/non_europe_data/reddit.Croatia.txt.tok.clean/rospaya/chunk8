  i used it since and i 'm kinda proud of it . 
  [ for people who do n't get it ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_soap_radio ), 
  me too , but i really do n't know why . 
   robert held up an armored car to finance a revolution for war against those who are murdering the innocent pre-born children . 
  many do not agree with his methods , they do n't believe it was a well thought out plan but none the less he sent thousands of dollars to prolife organizations to help save the lives of the babies and he never injured anyone . 
  oh , so not hurting anyone is a good thing now ? 
  every job i ever had i got because of the internet . 
  and everything i did on that jobs i learned off the internet . 
  oh my god that head is huge !, 
  doom rpg ? 
  the project chanology section makes you kinda proud . 
  that 's only because you 're dumb as the average consumer . 
  1 pixies ( three times more songs than # 2 ), 
  4 sonic youth, 
  5 the white stripes, 
  6 tenacious d, 
  8 metallica, 
   j : has he the semblance of a harlot ? 
  i lost it right here ... tears of joy !, 
  pop idols ? 
  never heard of them . 
  edit : the point is i live here . 
  i should have heard of them . 
  if most people are dumb , why should he/you/me be ? 
  he made mars attacks ?? 
  * ctrl + t w mars attacks !, 
   mars attacks !, 
  is a 1996 comic science fiction film directed by tim burton, 
  and to think i liked him ... 
  i liked it then . 
  today i think it 's crap . 
  i 'll get back to you in another 12 years . 
  yep . 
  i made custom searches for everything from the pirate bay to google maps . 
  i remember that , it 's the first time i saw him on tv . 
  i do n't really know how this stuff goes , but if you 're illegal , where did you get the documents to get into school ? 
  fake ? 
  thanks . 
  i always thought it was buttloads of birocracy to get into school . 
  no one made a clown on a wing joke ? 
  ok , i wo n't either . 
  billboards should be more expensive . 
  you mean [ k-pax ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k-pax_ ( film ) ? 
  i think we have just uncovered a conspiracy of epic proportions . 
  he was funny once . 
  the european parliament does n't have very much influence over state affairs , and even less over day to day life of an average european . 
  the next version will be great , with everything from aim , yim and msn to skype , jabber and icq integrated . 
  no , they 're not . 
  the wii is sold in big numbers , but the average wii gamer buys the least amount of games and accessories , as well as online content . 
  that will blow up in their faces too soon . 
  the government ( police/army ) should have the monopoly on the legal use of physical force . 
  the argument with firearms is mostly self defense , but if nobody has firearms than they are not needed . 
  i do n't have a problem with people having historical weapons , hunting rifles and similar , but nobody needs a mac-10 for home defense , or an ak-47 to prevent getting mugged . 
  the same stands for smaller guns . 
  well , you pay taxes , do n't you ? 
  so you pay the police to do that . 
  or , just maybe , he could be a fanboy , or a person that really likes xbox and / or microsoft . 
  no , actually they are not .

  with 50 million wiis and 30 million xbox 360s , that graphs are awfully close . 
  thanks for the upvote . 
  it 's actually a [ theory ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monopoly_on_the_legitimate_use_of_physical_force ), 
  if by `` balance of power '' you mean the proverbial `` armed militia '' that the us constitution mentions , that would not work in todays world . 
  even if a quarter of the population is armed ( statistics say they are , with 200 million weapons ) , they ca n't make any difference against a trained armed force which has assault weapons and vehicles . 
  even if the situation came , the rebels would probably be arrested and tried for treason and rebeling against the government . 
  a new pr director got to my former company , and before i met her my boss told me she 'll come by my house to leave a device i needed . 
  i partied the night before and expected a friend to come by in the morning for something . 
  long story short , i opened the door in my boxers and asked `` who the hell are you ? 
  actually it went pretty well . 
  i apologised and we got laughs out of it later , she left on maternity leave later after that and i got fired before she came back . 
  since my new job is on the * other * side of pr , our paths will cross again . 
  ok , then follow the swiss thing and teach every military-able male ( female too , if it were up to me ) to use an assault rifle . 
  the former yugoslavia had a thing called territorial defense . 
  it was a defense doctrine used because the borders could not be defended by the army by itself in case of an attack by an enemy . 
  at that time the enemies could be nato or the warsaw pact - the strongest forces around . 
  the doctrine was being teached since elementary school when students learned to use weapons - assemble them , fire and similar . 
  the whole thing was decentralised and somewhere from 1 to 3 million people could be armed and ready to fight in a matter of hours - in most cases a day . 
  is n't this a more viable way of defense / fighting repressive governmets than having a couple of million civilians with no training have weapons at their homes ? 
  are you the bofh ? 
  i 'm not sure what is the difference . 
  the local leadership was mostly ex military , and since every male went through at least a year of training there were n't problems with untrained personnel . 
  about training in schools , i remember stories that even girls learned to disasseble and assemble the standard machine gun and fire it , as well as the standard issue rifle . 
  somewhere under a million people were involved in yearly exercises in their units which varied from a factory , town , or a neighbourhood . 
  the to even had a few old ships , anti-air batteries and other equipment , but everyhing stayed very local and well organized . 
  do you think twitter and facebook will justify all the money pumped into them ? 
  what is your problem ? 
  why the attitude ? 
  the first graph ( worldwide ) shows my point , the second one is there because i could n't find the worldwide one , but the us info still proves my point . 
  i 'm still working on finding the article that says clearly that wii owners have bought the least games . 
  my guilty pleasure are musicals and rock operas . 
  i really like hair but i do n't talk about it much and mostly keep it to myself because of all the gay jokes . 
  a girl i had a crush on found about it and bought me an original hair movie poster from 1979 . for my birthday . 
  i did n't understand a word said or written in the video , but it still hit me like a brick . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/project_cybersyn ), 
  from a foreign perspective , clinton is considered the best us president since kennedy . 
  he had his fair share of scandals and mistakes , but the 90 's turned out great for the us because of him . 
  capacatitive touchscreens use fingers to conduct electricity , that 's why . 
  i thought i 'm the only person that prefers resistive touchscreens . 
  since the iphone came out nobody has the balls to say that it 's not enough precise .
