  the whole sum of music created since the boom after wwii will forever be popular and relevant , although i 'm sure there will be some exceptions for that . 
  hell yes . 
  but ... 
  i 'm puzzled by the technical side here . 
  how can this cost so little money ? 
  how is the campaign so precisely targeted ? 
  are people using some kind of special stb 's or something ? 
  that is an advantage only in marketing , because half of the apps are tetris clones , tip calculators and soundboards . 
  the number of apps ( i believe it 's over 100 000 ) just makes is harder to find the good stuff . 
  the real advantage of the app store are quality and high budget apps that are n't available on other platforms . 
  before the iphone came out the situation was like this ( figures not exactly correct , but in the ballpark ) :, 
  - symbian s60 had around 30 000 apps . 
  they were regarded as simplistic and were mostly interesting tools , none of the soundboard crap . 
  - palm had around 80-100 thousand apps . 
  they ranged from databases to tip calculators and had a reputation for being simple , maybe sometimes dumb and geared towards the general population . 
  - windows mobile had around 30 000 apps . 
  although many were crap , wm was unique in that it had professional applications that were worth thousands of dollars . 
  a lot of them were for professionals and businessmen .

  magnum dressed like a girl . 
  the guy on the left kills them all five minutes after this picture . 
   dressed in striped black track pants and a dirty windbreaker , niko looked like the kind of guy one might see staring longingly at the entrance of a strip club in zagreb , too poor to get in and too self-conscious to try to . 
  unfortunately , we do n't have strip clubs in zagreb , at least not the us kind . 
  here we have a couple of them , but they are reserved for very rich people and tourists that do n't know that they 'll get billed a couple of thousand dollars for a bottle of water . 
  i know it was just a figure of speech , but zagreb is n't that balkanic of a city , maybe just a couple of clubs on the outskirts . 
  but , they got the trackpants and windbreaker right , shady characters like niko do n't get out of them until they get thousand dollar suits . 
  are we talking just polite phrases or all of them ? 
  because in croatian i can make a huge list . 
  i think the 90-9-1 rule applies here as well . 
  i went to the emergency room with my grandad yesterday . 
  half an hour and without a euro/dollar paid . 
  good luck from europe .

  kidding , i 'm glad that people like you differ yourselves from the `` culture '' the rest of your demographic forces on you . 
   weirdo hipster, 
  hipsters dress like that ironically , i do n't think this guy is . 
  charlie brooker ? 
  if you threw in more insults i 'd say malcolm tucker . 
  the best quote from a very quote worthy show . 
  did the kid then proceed to follow them on their tour , trying to get an interview and later selling it to a famous music magazine ( today gone nuts ) ? 
  lady gaga is the same shit like every mainstream pop star out there . 
  the part of her marketing is making her seem smart , intelligent and relevant while she 's the same corporate design by committee crap like the rest . 
  fade from the public eye , get fat and die on the toilet ? 
  actually he did n't . 
  he 's a pensioner so he did n't , but i did , so did my parents , my friends and everyone i know that pays their taxes . 
  nobody implied it was free , just that the solidarity ( or socialst , call it whatever you like ) principle is by far better for an individual than the pure capitalist system . 
  it means both . 
  i 'm not sure if this is tacky or extremely awesome . 
  nope , pensioners get a tax return on health care . 
  as i said , so did i , my parents and every other tax paying citizen . 
  nobody has the illusion that it 's free , but you insist on the fact that there was money paid . 
  of course there was , doctors do n't live on air and equipment is n't bought with monopoly money .

  the economist rules . 
  it 's expensive but worth every dollar as i hear . 
  i do n't think brooker smokes , he 's not the kind of person to hide something . 
  also , i drink but do n't smoke . 
  just do n't like smoking whatever and alcohol is simple to get , cheap , sociable and the most important , legal . 
  not saying that pot is n't something like this ( except legal ) , but if taken in moderation and in proper situations , alcohol is a cool way to relax and have fun without much health issues ( again , in moderation ) . 
  do n't go blaming alcohol just because it 's legal and pot is n't . 
  i support smart usage of both . 
  interesting that you should ask . 
  ( i 'm posting this hoping not to get downvoted since this is a poll ), 
  i just noticed the other day that most famous actors are n't really that good or anything , just pretty and with good or famous movies . 
  most of them are just femme fatales or mary janes in the hollywood that is still obviously patriarchal as it always was . 
  with male actors , on the other hand , you can mention at least 20-30 of them that are really good and not necessarily just in mega famous movies . 
  some , like philip seymour hoffman are n't that attractive or famous but are still regarded as great talents . 
  does the female world of hollywood have an actress like that ? 
  i think helena bonham carter would fit here . 
  ok , since i 'm from croatia i 'll try with some details about the balkans . 
  - croatia hates serbia ( do i have to explain ? ), 
  - croatia does n't like the muslim part in bosnia and herzegovina ( love hate thing ), 
  - croatia does n't like slovenia , but loves the ones that bring tourist money, 
  - croatia does n't like montenegro because of the war , but also because they are doing the cheap tourism thing better than us . 
  - serbia hates albania, 
  - serbia does n't like montenegro ( some problems since their independence , love hate probably ), 
  - serbia does n't really like any country that recognized kosovo , slovenia maybe more than others . 
  - slovenia does n't like bosnia and herzegovina ( the muslim part i think , because of the immigrants ), 
  - albania hates serbia, 
  - macedonia hates greece, 
  - macedonia does n't like serbia ( possible hate here ), 
  - macedonia hates bulgaria, 
  if i missed something , please correct me . 
  also to put a disclamer here , i do n't hate anyone . 
  my friends from slovenia come here for the summer , my friends from serbia know more about croatian music than i do and i prefer serbian movies over domestic . 
  normal people do n't hate anyone . 
  does anyone know the hungary situation ?
