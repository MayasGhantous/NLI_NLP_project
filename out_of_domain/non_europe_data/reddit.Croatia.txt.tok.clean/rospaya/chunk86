  this is so depressing . 
  reminds me of me :(, 
  flash sucks on every platform . 
  fuck my dual core processor in my expensive windows laptop if it fucking sucks . 
  but then again , i 'm not sure i want apple to force the change , or anyone actually , without some compromise and standardization . 
  let 's do it right , not by force . 
  it almost looks like ... 
  i really hope you get to do me , i 'm terribly un-photogenic and need a new facebook picture . 
  [ this is me ] ( ), 
  yes !, 
  how dare they make money on their site !, 
  i 'm not from an english speaking country and i do n't know any black people ( i think there might be around a dozen of them in my city of nearly one million ) , but the only time i would use a slur like nigger or equivalent ... well , [ chris rock says it better than me ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niggas_vs._black_people ) . 
  i managed to smuggle a bottle of vodka into a fairly liberal muslim country . 
  the airport guards were less liberal . 
  wandered into another country when i was on a trip near the border . 
  i ran when i saw the guards ( not smart ) . 
  a noble cause . 
  i shall join . 
  is masturbation one of them ? 
  then sloth . 
  no chris rock ? 
  people , what the hell !, 
  mayhem and destruction , but that depends on the scope of the war . 
  primary reason for that would be the huge amount of weapons americans have in their homes and the fact that there is no iq test to get one . 
  depends on how you look at it . 
  not in a classical sense ( country vs. country ) , but maybe something like the current `` war '' on terror , a conflict that does n't care about borders . 
  globalisation and economy prevents most countries on going head to head on each other . 
  here are some good links about the subject :, 
  [ golden arches theory of conflict prevention ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_with_mcdonald's_franchises#golden_arches_theory_of_conflict_prevention ), 
  [ dell theory of conflict prevention ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dell_theory_of_conflict_prevention ), 
  [ clash of civilizations ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_clash_of_civilizations ), 
  terrorism in my view is non discriminating combat , killing civilians on purpose , but not by standard troops or military methods with the goal of bringing fear to the broad society . 
  that said your argument is bullshit . 
  every modern war convention prohibits targeting civilians , and that 's the line that seperates war from terrorism . 
  you ca n't fault or target someone just because he was born in some country that gets to be the victim . 
  living in a country does n't mean that the person approves of what the government is doing . 
  i echo joezuntz opinion - you are either a troll or a dangerous and evil person . 
  talk in your name if you want , i did n't kill anyone . 
  hehe ... prom . 
  i went to a loser private school with 18 people in my class ( about 70 in the whole school ) , and most of us were rejects and bums that do n't care about our education . 
  lack of girls in school made latent homosexuality a normal thing . 
  needless to say we did n't have a prom . 
  we just went to a tavern and got severely drunk with our professors and after that tried to stone the school building . 
  yugoslavia really had great music back then . 
  the new wave and punk was at par with the western scene . 
  from paket aranzman to azra , pankrti and others , that was a great time to listen to music . 
  also , the only burek i recognize is made of meat . 
  so , how much is a liter of diesel in the us ? 
  in croatia regular diesel is $ 1,42 per liter . 
  behold , all of them international forces and diplomatic giants . 
   yes , i am gay . 
  i like the cock . 
  i do n't know why i found this funnier than the rest of your post . 
  he who controls the karma controls reddit !, 
  wikipedia needs a big change , on the outside it 's the free encyclopedia we all love and enjoy , but on the inside it 's a mess with bloody battles and edit wars . 
  editing about a dozen of pages in both my local and the english wikipedia turned out to be a disaster . 
  not simple , not easy , not practical . 
  here 's my old video of how multitasking should work on a mobile device . 
  [ nokia n81 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrcmfnd9uac ) from 2007 . 
  i opened 15 apps and then surfed the web . 
  you could move between apps as free as you can on a pc , but with a smaller screen . 
  my fifa 09 disc broke so i downloaded the fifa 10 demo from live . 
  since everything i do is play with friends i do n't even need the full game , the demo has everything i need . 
  if i were in the uk i could n't vote for the conservatives , and labour lost it since iraq . 
  maybe lib dems or greens ? 
  i think third party is the way to go . 
  he looks like a shady character . 
  a good movie . 
  unfortunately it was n't well connected and did n't make any sense , but it had its good moments and a * great * acting crew . 
  ewan mcgregor 's accent was ... ugh . 
  at least they got +50 population . 
  i like your speakers . 
  i 'm no boy genius , but i was about 13-14 when i saw fight club . 
  did n't get it in the first sitting , so i watched it again the day after that and more or less got it . 
  the same with the rest of the movies you mentioned . 
  i understood them , but got the real feeling as i got older ... for fight club you have to be of a certain age and demographic to get the true feeling for it . 
  i suggest watching more movies and more classics . 
  even the boring ones . 
  after that read some in depth reviews and discussions . 
  if done properly you 'll get into the beautiful world of movies and become a geek like a lot of the r/movies crowd . 
  i 'm not a programmer , but the technical argument seems stupid . 
  this is clearly a political decision on apple 's part , not a technical constraint . 
  i put [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrcmfnd9uac ) on youtube a couple of years ago when a guy on a forum ( who did n't know what symbian or s60 is ) was determined that there is no way you could multitask on a phone . 
  that 's a 2007 nokia n81 with less than 50 mb of ram . 
  it has 8 gb of mass storage and 128 mb of flash memory , so the 8 gb is used exclusively for storage . 
  i opened 15 apps , some of them were doing something in the background and then surfed the web . 
  i love me some upboats . 
  i last watched it a couple of years ago , but you ca n't deny that it had a constant quality . 
  `` funniest '' is a little too much maybe , but it 's very funny with simple humour . 
  i 've heard great things about this guy , but the voice ( that is his trademark ) is so annoying that i ca n't watch it . 
  your dick likes cliffs ? 
  bullying happens all of the time in every school , the only difference is that the girl killed herself in this case . 
  it 's very sad that young humans are not capable of recognizing their mistakes even when it brings such tragic consequences . 
  i would n't blame anyone here ( as in : blame society , blame tv etc ) . 
  bullies are being bullies and that 's about it . 
  we need to change the social climate that allowed the kids to do the harrasment in the first place , make the other kids , parents and mostly the schooling system to react on the first sight of violence . 
  be it physical or psychological . 
  i say this as someone who has been on all three sides of this in the past . 
  i will [ never ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332047/ ) forgive him . 
  i do n't have a problem with christian holidays and some rituals that are being performed .
