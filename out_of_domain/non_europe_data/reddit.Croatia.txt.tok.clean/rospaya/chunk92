  i 'm gon na sound like a hippy , but if more people cared about other people , there would n't be a `` picture of mohammed '' controversy . 
  i 'm talking about all of the sides here . 
   it seems like a thin veneer for islamophobes to congregate and post all their hatred against muslims and get upvotes for it . 
  i think it 's all religions , not just islam . 
  the thing is christians are ( in comparison with extreme muslims , * because all of them are like that * ) mostly moderate , while muslims are foreign , dark skinned and far away . 
  also , it makes people look ballsy , because they posted a [ picture of mohammed ] ( http://images.google.com/images?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=opera&amp;rls=en&amp;tbs=&amp;q=prophet+mohammed&amp;revid=985480711&amp;ei=m6dps9-sn4e5_qad_ovr&amp;sa=x&amp;oi=revisions_inline&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=broad-revision&amp;cd=1&amp;start=0 ) and are n't afraid to get killed defending free speech . 
  i 'm guessing you ca n't keep the blood forever and that in a decentralized system you ca n't be sure what the national situation is in every moment . 
  in the end , you ca n't reject people , right ? 
  do n't have a citation , but only a vague memory that i heard that a couple of years ago on tv . 
   the best part about the first amendment is that you have the choice not to listen . 
  the best part about being a person is not insulting people just for your own pleasure , and feeling self righteous after that . 
  i 'm just putting myself into the boots of a moderate muslim : you insult me by publishing the cartoon , some people go nuts over it . 
  then you publish it again , people go nuts over it * again * . 
  after months of mindless provocation just to prove a point , a moderate muslim might get more pissed at the people provoking him , not the people burning embassys . 
   and yes , if it was n't a public health concern and legal , you bet i would . 
  good for you . 
  i like to think that i have some decency to do it in private . 
  that 's the two of us then , i know another guy in person so we 'll figure something out . 
  i presume you got offended , is that why you cursed ? 
  do you see how other people feel ? 
  why do you have the need to intervene in other people 's lives ? 
   they basically took the science fiction from minority report and made it a consumer product / reality, 
  what ? 
  are you serious ? 
  that 's not the solution . 
  i still want to read about the ipad , apple and other products , but i want a fair and balanced ( where did i hear this before ... ) reporting . 
   serious question : why the apple hate ? 
  on gizmodo , right now : 31 posts , 11 with apple content . 
  the way they handle apple related content is disgusting and beyond any journalist standard . 
  you are * so * awkward it makes me cringe . 
  this is fenomenal . 
  although you certainly have more knowledge in the area than i do ( and i have none ) , what about giving blood in small towns or countries that do n't have the research capacity and use the blood only for transfusions ? 
  is n't that a possiblity ? 
  that 's just a patent , nothing more and nothing less . 
  companies have thousands of patents for banal shit like the ones you can read about [ here ] ( http://gizmodo.com/5483689/the-apple-patents-cockpunching-all-smart-phones-an-illustrated-guide/gallery/ ) . 
  and yes , i see the irony of posting a gizmodo link . 
  thank you , come again . 
  that was cool of him . 
  the allies won the war , let 's leave all the other shit out of the discussion . 
  it was a long effort by a lot of countries . 
  russia ( you meant to write ussr ) did n't win it , usa did n't win it and britain did n't win . 
  the allies did . 
  what ? 
  no minorities except one woman on the cameron pic ? 
  racist !!, 
  oh please , showing ads depending on location is something from an sf movie ? 
  you can do this with a simple geo script for years , that 's nothing new , and definitely not connected to the first article you posted , except in mentioning minority report . 
  also , quoting from the original source :, 
   the latest patent filing from apple inc. hints, 
  hints . 
  * hints * . 
  ** hints ** . 
  whenever someone files for a patent , the media ( apple centric media even more ) thinks that it 's solid evidence that there will be a product featuring that in the next 9 months . 
  until that minorty report thingy comes out , i 'll stand with my first statement . 
  i see you 're in it . 
  are you at windays ? 
  meh , it does n't matter anyway , they 're over today . 
  you 're usually mature like this ? 
  well it does n't make it right . 
  i work in it media so i know how this things go , but you never go full retard like gizmodo has . 
  we pander to our advertisers and readership , but only to get the money and attention to do what needs to be done . 
  it 's sad that there is n't enough money in doing that stuff so you get paid by doing other stuff . 
  i feel like a pile of shit , ama . 
  whoa , talk about a reaction ... is mothers day such a big deal in the us ? 
  where i live we just give a flower , and it 's on may 10th . 
  woman 's day is a little bigger , and labour day is a full blown non working holiday . 
  well , this was the oddest masturbation i had this week ... 
  your pelosi analogy is n't spot on . 
  she would still be the head of parliament , and obama would be president , but the leading party ( in the parliament ) would propose a prime minister that would be the head of government . 
  usually you need a majority or in rare countries a 2/3 majority . 
  also , most parliamentary countries have a mechanism to replace the current government with a no confidence vote , which usually requires a 2/3 majority . 
  nokia e71 is the device , symbian os s60 is the os , opera mini 4.2 is the browser but there is a new version out . 
  that does n't make it right . 
  as i mentione elswhere , i work in it media and i know how these things go down - you have to move with the interests of your audience , but 1/3 of the main page content is apple related , while all of the top links are apple . 
  but the worst part is that giz is n't having a real coverage , they are blinded fanboys that do n't have a sense of reality . 
  if you think i 'm wrong , check out the rest of this thread . 
  i just want real and balanced news . 
  i do n't like apple but want to see a fair coverage of all relevant news , not just the crowd pleaser crap . 
  that is the essence of every media - balance the stuff that makes you money and the stuff is your essential subject - apple is n't 1/3 of the gadget world . 
  i do n't agree . 
  your rebuttal is almost entirely saying that there is a justification for posting mohammed pictures just because religion is bad . 
  while i agree that you have a right to that , i do n't see how posting an insulting pic on reddit is helping anyone 's cause . 
  my muslim friend is n't insulted by that , he 's just sad that a bunch of young people , mostly from the us , find that posting something that is insulting to some and completely irrelevant to others is presumed good activism and a good job . 
  as an atheist and a believer in free speech , i do n't give a fuck about the picture , what bugs me is that people on reddit , for who i have general respect , are posting something that insults a lot of people , but does ** absolutely ** nothing else to everybody else . 
  most people here have n't even seen a muslim , even less gotten shit from one . 
  i invite anyone to go to saudi arabia or any other sharia country and try to pull this there , because doing this on reddit has absolutely no benefits for the cause you are having . 
  all that said , you invested a lot in your reply so i upvoted you . 
  i wished there were more comments like yours , even if i do n't agree with them . 
  awww , whose a cute kit ... is that a nokia e71 ? 
  sweet .

  check out the lyrics . 
  you are on a horse . 
  rand shopping mall ? 
  really ? 
  a lot of countries do n't have them . 
  croatia had subway but it collapsed about 6 months ago , hooters a couple of years ago and mcdonalds is going relatively strong . 
  we also had a starbucks-like costa coffee that retreated a couple of months ago . 
  i guess the fast food/coffee culture is n't so strong here . 
   the military took over in viet nam , and now in iraq/afghanistan .
