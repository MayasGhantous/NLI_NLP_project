  i can accept that you like it , but i would like you to tell me how the spikes or hair serve any purpose except flounting yourself like an exhibit . 
  the same applies to any other fashion subculture that sacrifices comfort over style . 
  emulate or imitate their ideas , not a stupid hairstyle . 
  what ? 
  the onion published it on their facebook page 5 hours ago . 
  i saw the link and posted it to one subreddit i thought that it was worth for . 
  did n't get an error that there is another one already posted . 
   the theory is that if jesus had come later , no one would have listened due to message overload . 
  if i remember correctly , the same images were used in both of the movies to show that today the news about jesus would be buried in yellow journalism and news overload . 
   this is the same kind of question as , `` why did n't jesus come now , in the 21st century , when he could have gone on tv and really gotten his message out there ? '', 
  are you saying ... whaat if goood was ooonee of uuus !, 
  wow , a brit talking shit about the eu . 
  how unusual and rare . 
  i plan to root it 20 minutes after buying it . 
  defensive mechanism against western culture that they see threatening to their ways . 
  sort of like cuba , the west ravaged what they could and fundamentalism developed out of that . 
  not really related , but when i was on a school trip through central europe , a friend and me got drunk and we were goofing around in the center of town , holding hands . 
  we did it in every city to see if there would be any reaction . 
  the only one i remember is in budapest when some people cursed at us . 
  for the record , we 're both straight . 
  it 's one of my favourite albums so i listen to it every once in a while , but have n't seen the films recently as well . 
  of course , i 'm just talking about the `` frozen '' parts . 
  i was in tunisia where they have a church , synagogue and mosque in the same street , but then again it is one of the liberal muslim countries . 
  spare me the stories about the downfall of eu or the euro , in case you did n't notice , there is a worldwide economic crisis going on , something that 's not the euro 's fault . 
  16 countries are using it , even if by some chance greece or portugal bail out , that will just make it stronger in the long term . 
  god damnit , dave is a fucking animal . 
  they have a little british bias , only two americans on the list . 
  ah open source zealots , the best kind there are . 
  thanks . 
   he though it was 52 for some reason, 
  maybe he 's a firm believer in statehood for washington dc and puerto rico . 
  or just dumb . 
  the us is n't even in the top ten shipbuilding countries as far as i remember . 
  i actually rewatched the movie just the be sure . 
  also , the guy looks great . 
  not defending anyone , but not everyone is in the us . 
  sometimes i would give my left nut to have netflix over here , but such is the faith of europeans ... 
  the thing that i do n't get ... hurt locker got most of its early promotion with people who downloaded shitty cam versions or in other ways got a copy over the internet . 
  without p2p , they would n't get that much promotion , money or awards . 
  they are sawing the branch they 're sitting on . 
  but , do ya like dags ? 
  spooks has 8 seasons ? 
  whoa . 
  a local tv station bought a couple of seasons , but i never thought i would go past 3-4 . 
  good show . 
  i love it how every year croatia does n't pass it 's all like :, 
   oh it does n't matter , who even cares about that trashfest . 
  and when we pass :, 
   oh my god croatia is on the top of the polls and it 's gon na win [ again ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurovision_song_contest_1989 ) oh god oh god oh god !, 
  also , i had an idea about a rock eurosong , a big open air concert from big rock names from every country . 
  that would probably suck , too . 
  collection sounds dirty when all i have to do is set up a queue in utorrent and have a `` collection '' in a week . 
  but yea , about 300 gb . 
  i hate you . 
  why ? 
  i just fucking hate his face . 
  good pop music does . 
  i 'm on the brink of deciding whether to go to college or work . 
  option a ) leaves me with a slight chance of having my dreams come true , option b ) almost completely eliminates it . 
  the next couple of weeks will probably decide what will happen with my life from now on . 
  celebration ? 
  heh , the eurosong is just politics and tackyness for decades now . 
  hello !, 
  it 's me ... the * devil * !, 
  johnny bravo . 
  who was responsible for killing kennedy ? 
  sorry folks , that 's the one that interest me the most . 
  what country are you in ( i noticed the euros ) ? 
   alex smith -- a ** 20-year-old ** undergraduate, 
  i 'll kill myself . 
   i 'm going to stab, 
  dude , he 's only getting married , he did n't rape your dog or anything . 
  thanks . 
  good luck . 
  you ** do ** have a point there . 
  i actually know people who will masturbate to this . 
  well , the uk is infamous for losing year after year so it 's not surprising . 
  most other countries look at it with irony and laughter , unless they have a chance of winning . 
  then it 's nationalism and pride like it 's 1939 germany . 
  i 'm lance , the laid back slacker . 
  tracy jordan is next . 
  michael arrington can go and fuck himself , and this statement is not even related to this story . 
  just my general impression of the guy . 
  well he ** is ** human . 
  freak and geeks were the most real stuff he 's done . 
  good read indeed . 
  slovenia , austria , hungary , italy , slovakia , czech republic , germany , bosnia and herzegovina , tunisia . 
  i 'm from croatia . 
  i actually liked it . 
  it was n't anything special , just a regular cover . 
  sounds like jenna from 30 rock . 
   also , the us was on the muslim side in bosnia . 
  yes . 
  but , i 've got ta stress , that religion was just the far background in that conflict , the fact that there were catholic , orthodox christians and muslims in it was n't actually that important . 
  those fact were mostly used in propaganda and nationalism purposes , to build up a fire . 
  they all lived peacefully 50 years before that . 
  just now i made a grooveshark playlist with some nostalgia music . 
  goes great with beer . 
  prodigy kick fucking ass for a band that has a dancer . 
   however , the moab bomb 's yield is comparable to the smallest of nuclear devices , such as the m-388 davy crockett .
