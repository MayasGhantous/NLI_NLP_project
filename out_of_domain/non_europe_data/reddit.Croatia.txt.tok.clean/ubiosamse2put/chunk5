  the stupidest question of a day ... only on r/movies, 
  big shit, 
  club will win shit if club dont buy players , this transfer window is dissapointing, 
  olympiakos to win with handicap , odds 2.60, 
  rijeka is in big trouble , there has been some trouble in the club lately , lost last two games against osijek and dinamo zagreb with really shit playing , rumor is that players are not satisfied with the way club behaves towards them , i think very easy win for olympiakos especially at home with their crazy atmosphere, 
  yeah thats a good bet , good luck , 
  my bookie is 2.60 where did you get 3.10 ? 
  edit : oh they raised the odds wtf ... i dont know i am speaking about rijeka here maybe olympiakos is even in bigger shit lol but i am still going to play it , fuck it , 
  very nice, 
  stupid stat, 
  i saw wenger out on croatian basketball league final game, 
  same happened in croatia couple a months ago , uber even replied with official thank you note lol, 
  is this paid to be on top r/videos ? 
  yeah man , finland sucks really bad they draw against kosovo at home , and iceland beat us ( croatia ) last game and we are preety strong team , iceland guys are really fighters and they will fight to secure that second spot in group , good luck , 
  americans, 
  iceland win ,, 
  spain italy draw ,, 
  ireland win ,, 
  serbia win +2 ,, 
  wales austria both to score , ukraine win,
