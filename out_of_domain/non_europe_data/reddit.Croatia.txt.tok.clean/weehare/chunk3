  a ne `` news are bad '' . 
  she 's just living up to the bus driver stereotype . 
  translation : what has to be done is n't hard to do . 
  naime , automobil je izgorio do temelja . 
  now that it 's black it ought to be ready for plenty of injustice, 
  here 's one fly white girl https://38.media.tumblr.com/9fd29bb524329667c4f62561ff40691f/tumblr_n6frw2lcil1rflte8o1_r1_250.gif,

  broad city , 
  mesmerizing shit, 
  i used to hitchhike before i got a car , now i return the favor , especially during tourist season . 
  i have met a ton of very interesting people from all over the place , people hitchhiking the globe or just heading to a nearby beach . 
  some we 're quirky ( like this hare krishna guy that sung o sole mio when he realized it was my birthday ) , but most we 're just genuinely nice , young couples or groups of friends wanting to have a good time and meet new people . 
  now that i think on it , i got spooked once when we picked up a pilgrim , he gave away these christian booklets and afterward seemed like he minded doing so . 
  just really not a `` people person '' . 
  he also reeked cause it was the middle of summer and showers were hard to come by . 
  should have known better . 
  heard of it here first :, 
  . . and that 's why he drinks !, 
  analogy - nazis did n't `` hate '' jews , they just treated them as objects . 
  they were brought up that way , they could n't have known better . 
  haha winning people over . 
  sure . 
  if this is n't an atrocity as big as the one i was earlier referring to , i do n't know what is . 
  claiming someone does n't hate women but is taught that they 're property is prettying up the fact that they do ( hate them ) . 
  the subject my dear friend is dehumanization . 
  the point i 'm trying to make is - dehumanizing might work for whomever but it 's still a form of hate . 
  so let 's cut the crap and call stuff for what it is , no `` they come from a different background '' excuse can do it when it comes to isis . 
  that way of thinking might be a tad too progressive for my taste . 
  i know they did , what i 'm saying is this might be called something else but is really the same thing . 
  too much sadism goes into the whole slavey business in isis for me to believe it 's simple indoctrination . 
  apparently mitchell and webb find it hilarious :, 
  spray it on from a distance and then massage your scalp . 
  brush thoroughly afterward . 
  i used to have the same problem with dry shampoo , i guess i was using it wrong : s, 
  tnx , 
  i 'm super excited about the next episode , i 'm an extra in it !, 
  i just love land seals !, 
  this should totally be under r/hybridanimals . 
  i dunno if it 's a deer , a dog or a cow , 
  did wittle baby put captions on ? 
  the pruitt-igoe myth - on how shifting the urban landscape and welfare policies reflects on society , race/class relations and crime . 
  this was taken in dalmatia so it 's probably from a time when levels of the adriatic were way up . 
  on second thought , [ you 're right ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zjk7a5u.gif ) . 
  paul beatty 's the sellout and anything sedaris , of course, 
  also , don dellilo 's white noise for some reason ... 
  according to my neurologist , you seem to be suffering from migraines , too . 
  apparently the best way to differentiate it from a regular headache is light - if it triggers it and darkening your room soothes it , it 's a migraine : /, 
  i could be that girl , easily . 
  sometimes i look like crap when i 'm at work , other times you could swear i feel 100 % but i 'm still under the migraine haze . 
  that 's why i asked people if they have trouble believing migraine sufferers , they do n't always look sick on the outside . 
  i agree a better lifestyle will surely make a difference , but i 'm kind of wierded out by my changing body shape - i never used to gain weight on my upper body . 
  i was actually quite the opposite . 
  now it feels like my leg/butt deposits are full and i 'm filling up in new places lol, 
  thanks for your reply !, 
  i 'm not a big expert but i seem to come across this guy everywhere - is it because so much of his work is available for free or are his compositions really great work ? 
  not trolling , i 'm seriously asking , 
  i 'm just copy-pasting my reply from an earlier thread :, 
  `` this is what i 've stumbled upon so far :, 
  also , compleat klezmer mentioned earlier and several other ones i acquired in print ( de haske publications ) . '', 
  i did n't aquire it because i do n't know the first thing about oboes , i 've only just recently taken up the clarinet . 
  i was worried if i purchased it i might later on realise it had a serious defect or something ... 
  i could still get someone to buy it for me and re-sell it . 
  feel free to make an offer , i 'd be glad to help a musician get a good instrument !, 
  also - it 's gold plated and it 's price is listed under the pic : 150 euro ( not kidding ), 
  the guy selling it did n't know what instrument it was , i had to tell him !, 
  keep an eye on otherwise [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg5mod8ubsk ) might happen , 
  sad to see how hard life makes them unaware of the art they 're making, 
  ... or a sea lion , perhaps . 
  then what about [ this ? ], 
  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh7os5ujgky ), 
  deadwood jokes , anyone ? 
  the kitten had found the mitten, 
  and it shall have some pie, 
  you 're exactly right . 
  when it came to small plastic figurines i 'd always check if the eyes were painted so they do n't look cock-eyed . 
  there 's always a `` best '' toy . 
  ... has a pennsatucky look about her face though, 
  considering the post is on the front page very few people have gotten the same idea , i find this a near-win !, 
  he can stay .

  i 'm no expert but it seems like [ snowpiercer ] ( http://christandpopculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/snowpiercer-53622270c9e26.jpg ) was based off of this design . 
  they were right to do so , it 's as futuristic as it gets !, 
  mauve jellies are the best !, 
  one of my favorites of his but i prefer the big time version cause the clarinet has a fabulous klezmer-like solo on it !, 
  according to parents - `` tramvaj '' ( streetcar ) . 
  not true !, 
  this is the ultimate combo - after i taste this i can die happy . 
  do n't wan na be a buzzkill , but did n't the dog 's owner die recently ? 
  i think i 've read something about the dog being lucky cause he usually accompanied him on most jumps, 
  felt like i witnessed history when he said it on maher 's show . 
  hear hear !,

  you 're absolutely right . 
  good luck !, 
  upvote for title . 
  and kitty . 
  reminds me of [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gffdhj15ihi ) , after the movie boxing helena .
