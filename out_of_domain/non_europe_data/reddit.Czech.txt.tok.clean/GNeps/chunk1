i 'm from czech republic ( next to germany ) , and have travelled a lot of europe . 
  no european would indicate 3 _ without _ the thumb , it 's absolutely true , really . 
  i loved it so much , that was like the only car chase scene when they could n't get the car started and had to push it :-d, 
  i believe in those pirates , they 'll always find a way to deliver me fun stuff :-), 
  that 's the reason i fear living in the us . 
  you guys are crazy about this !, 
  i just ca n't believe it ... 
  here in europe , he would have got a high-five from the judge . 
  but selling sperm sounds kinda awful , does n't it ? 
  hey , that comment made me laugh out loud , leave it be !, 
  ( wan na be in this thread ), 
  nlp was created by modelling behaviour of the greatest comunicators . 
  naturals that is . 
  i think obama is natural . 
  those who learned it seem always little creepy , and he does n't . 
  on the account of thought provoking films , i 'd suggest, 
  it really blew my mind , and got me thinking . 
  is this really reddit worthy ? 
  ca n't you ask some friend that knows addition and subtraction ? 
  you made me laugh out loud on a lousy monday . 
  thank you sir !, 
  where do you live ? 
  i love reading on my android smartphone . 
  the screen is big and smooth and resolution awesome . 
  i love it even more becouse i take it everywhere with me , so i do n't have to take big paperback books , that do n't fit into my jacket pockets . 
  awesome . 
  i agree with ecliptic ,, 
  it 's not government telling people what they can do with their bodies . 
  it 's about solidarity - if you are generous enough to donate your organs after death , than you should recieve transplants if something happens to you . 
  if you 're selfish and wo n't donate , why would they give you transplants ? 
  people need to be motivated to do the good thing . 
  the more donors , the more people get saved . 
  government is n't dictating what you should do , it 's just motivationg so there 's no shortage - that 's when good people die for no reason . 
  come on , i 'm dying to know !, 
  totally awesome !, 
  i have one `` bug '' though : why is the ** text so dim ** ? 
  i ca n't see it properly in this sunny weather here in europe . 
  make it more white please , now i have to ** hover over the links to ** make them brighter so i can ** read them ** . 
  also , while you 're at it ... why is n't there the ** fullscreen button ** ? 
  no , it 's mohammed in the suit !, 
  hey guys , i want to buy the ** orange pack ** ( i played almost all the games illegaly , so i owe it to them :-) , ** should i buy today ** ? 
  i have n't seen it in the today only section , but it 's 33 % off ( and yesterday was n't ) . 
  what do you think ? 
  i mean : will it possibly get even cheaper tomorrow or some day after that ? 
  gr8 , thanks :-), 
  they just made ** gta : episodes from liberty city $ / $ 4 cheaper ** !, 
  it 's now $ 10,49 !, 
  it happened while i had it in the shopping cart :d, 
  ** not necessarily !, 
  today , the gta episodes from lib . 
  city started at $ 14,49 in the today only section , but ** after few hours ** they went to ** $ 10,49 ** !, 
  jobs are for bores , take your backpack and hitchhike to the other coast and back , that 's what i do here in europe :-), 
   ... am going to see continents . 
  assuming there 's water ... 
  agreed , i would n't use it for work . 
  however , imagine that your tv + gaming console has that ability . 
  you can read reddit just with your hands off a couch . 
  when it enhances your abbility to conduce things from your couch , be sure it 'll catch on :-), 
  also - google earth !, 
  i think you 'll find that the universe pretty much covers anything, 
  shut up woman get on my hores, 
  on the account of portal , i 'd like to ask : i wan na buy the orange pack , which should include portal , but at the orange pack info page ( http://store.steampowered.com/sub/469/ ) the price of portal is listed as n/a . 
  i hope it does n't mean i wo n't get the portal , does it ? 
  no , the n/a price has been there during the entire week , and i dunno why : - x, 
  and googling envoy ads did n't reveal anything : - /, 
  i think it deserves at least 3,5 , cause i can not unsee : - x, 
  sfw :-(, 
  since you first saw it on a work computer without repros :d, 
  seconded, 
  or offered to scratch hers ... 
  find out what are they putting on fries instead of ketchup ... 
  a couple of nights ago i went to sleep at about 10am ;, 
  you see , i bought civ iv a couple of nights ago ... 
  i love it :d, 
  good going !, 
  i rly like this idea , i 'm gon na try it !, 
  that must be a joke :d, 
  exactly !, 
  i ca n't believe the stupidity of the cop , and unbelievable how people can be cruel when given power . 
  i 'm from europe and wanted to live in ny sometime , but you people scare me !, 
  the tasars are so evil !, 
  i do n't know why , but i know you 're joking , that 's what i love about reddit :d, 
  i diasgree , for me the book is well thought out , and has very interesting view of humanity 's future , which i find very plausible , written in the 30 's , the world has shifted a whole lot in the book 's direction since then . 
  i read only davinci code , and i rly enjoyed it . 
  i usually do n't read this kind of literature , so one book in this style was fun . 
  any * george carlin * , the * class clown * would be excellent example . 
  * they 're all gon na laugh at you !, 
  then why use internet ? 
  no it did n't . 
  i want see . 
  any alt . 
  links ? 
  the tone of the article was wrong , but i liked the machines - they failed becouse they were expensive , not becouse they were n't awesome . 
  i always wanted to live in america , i loved new york city , watching it in movies , tv series , reading books about it here in europe . 
  but after i started paying attention what 's happening in the states , i get more and more frightened . 
  now i turned around , i do n't want to live in the us anymore , europe is fucking brilliant in comparison !, 
  i do actually , it 's on couchsurfing.com , 
  exactly same with htc desire :-), 
  rly ? 
  fair use should be covered in the warranty , should n't it ?
