  european here , also not an option . 
  are we entirely sure they 're not the same person ? 
  the lower case i is a bit distracting . . 
  well , in europe i 'd say it 's at least widely used to pretend we are from the us , 
  honestly , who can live without pandora.com ? 
   fwb is not a friend , in fact your true friends outrank your fwb every time !, 
  what if you fuck with a true friend ? 
  it 's a line from the movie , people , 
  that 's pretty weird  upvote !, 
  i think his response was entirely valid , and i was even expecting it . 
  yours comment on the other hand is out of place and brings nothing to the discussion . 
  my sense of rediquette forces me to downvote you . 
  i 'm european - no carpool lanes here . 
  are the carpool lanes really worth the multiplied complexity of every crossing / exit ? 
  it looks like hell . 
  yes , the former . 
  everybody knows that [ eliminating pirates is what causes the global warming ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flying_spaghetti_monster#pirates_and_global_warming ) .

  - michael scott, 
  exactly , why do you think al gore invented the internet ? 
  just pure science . 
  pretty fucking lame , without rediquette , we 're basically 4chan , 
  well , i was in the us for a month this holiday and i saw only one highway with carpool lanes , but it was separate and had its own exits . 
  it looked like overcomplicated monstrosity that should be leveled , 
  who ? 
  yes , people stopped buying newspapers and started going to blogs for grammar . 
  absolutely . 
  world war 3 is n't coming , you 're just gon na get older and that 's it . 
  do something . 
  why not ? 
  the economy is one of the most interesting phenomenons in today 's world , and the pursuit to find its laws is a very important one , even harder than most other fields since it is very hard to test . 
  why do you propose it 's not science ? 
  i do n't think that 's completely true , although there might be a little truth to that . 
  however , for the most part , people do behave like a rational agents securing their own well being . 
  we just do n't have sufficient methods to simulate and predict their behaviour en masse . 
  thanks, 
  why do you make such broad statements as `` studying on pdf is impossible '' ? 
  are you sure your study method is the only one ? 
  or is it the best one ? 
  i for one study something like 75 % of my curriculum from pdfs . 
  brilliant , thank you . 
  funny you say that , i 'm studying applied mathematics . 
  i believe you might not be able to study from pdfs , but do n't make assumptions about general populace from your behaviour . 
  one of his best works , 
  regional manager goes down with the ship , everybody knows that . 
  he has his own raft . 
  are you gon na ... blue yourself ? 
  me too , i think because it could be some weird mandatory communist experiment in china ... 
  especially the women gave the impression . 
  not even into 500 of them ? 
  dasher is crazy, 
  oh , i never knew that distinction , interesting , thank you . 
  - european, 
  that 's seriously awesome !, 
  those were the days ... 
  the handling of the country by the government during the wwii was really a quite remarkable feat . 
  they knew what they were doing . 
  well , as i said , they knew what they were doing . 
  it was n't nice , but i believe it was useful . 
  let 's not forget how the japanese culture was ** percieved ** back in those days . 
  edit : added percieved , for details see reply to reply to this comment . 
   let 's not forget how the japanese culture was ** percieved ** back in those days . 
  ftfm ( fixed that for me ) - that 's what i wanted to say , sorry, 
  i 'm not saying the decision was good when i 'm looking at it in retrospect . 
  what i 'm saying is that the decision was the most logical one at that time , with information they had , with that mindset of that generation . 
  the 442nd regiment might have kicked balls , but they did n't know that at that time . 
  the only thing they knew was that a great nation attacked them , and that the culture of that nation was very strong so the members of that nation might be capable of many things . 
  they did n't know , they just covered their bases . 
  for what it 's worth , the japanese americans might have sabotaged , might have spied and might have turned the balance of power . 
  then in retrospect it would have been a good decision . 
  btw : maybe too much usage of bold font for my taste ... 
  i believe there is n't any optimal solution . 
  however , tit for tat was demonstrated to be the best solution in comparison to all other solutions proposed . 
  it is n't optimal because it depends on the opponent . 
  wonderful ted . 
  i wish more doctors were like him . 
  i thought it was missing , great to find it here !, 
  boobs, 
  i read it as panties . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  that got my ... who knows why :d, 
  true , but censoring the name of their show ? 
  that 's not an idea beneficial to those two . 
  here i was thinking the offensive title brought them exactly the audience they 'd like for the show . 
  nice trivia , 
  if you read the date on the bottom - it 's 1777 , it was one of the first proposed formation documents of the future us . 
  it did n't stick . 
  it was sort of a test for the future constitution . 
  / not from us, 
  bitch please, 
  is n't the whole premise of this subreddit a circlejerk ? 
  that 's the spirit !,

  what is wtf where they mentioned it ? 
  i think the most obvious and best solution is this : put your taskbar on the side of your screen .
