  it 's , however , the quality of scientists that they are able to distance themselves from their bias , and be influenced only by the data . 
  this guy seems like a good scientist to me . 
  fuck yeah , so excited !, 
  please do n't call people dumb shits if they did n't properly deserve it . 
  no worries , i was n't offended or anything . 
  i just do n't like it , so i asked you if you could not do that . 
  it 's entirely up to you . 
  i just like to keep reddit within the realm of intelligent discussion , it 's why i come here . 
  and the memes of course . 
  it 's so cute , a little baby troll :-), 
  hey , i liked it . 
  i do n't really care if it 's real or not . 
  hence the whole tv and movie industries . 
  the [ original post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/fitness/comments/oaz6s/as_promised_my_1_year_of_blood_sweat_and_tears/ ) on r/fitness - more info about the training . 
  hmm , i 'm thinking the same thing - mom wants you to fail as she is failing . 
  she might not give in . 
  how about getting your own mini fridge and not going to places she stuffs with food like the main fridge ? 
  nope , i count more than 20 current reigning monarchs :, 
  [ nope ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/oetob/til_the_current_head_of_the_korean_imperial/c3gresm ), 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/oetob/til_the_current_head_of_the_korean_imperial/c3gqgg8?context=2 ), 
  as discussed ( i think ) above , we are ... 
  only in a residential neighbourhoods ... 
  well , they did . 
  but hey , why not , they 're frugal , 
  obligatory `` shut up , meg . '', 
  when all other americans vote for their senators , stickers saying `` washington voting box '' are put on the city 's trash cans . 
  anyhow , washingtonians do not vote for senators nor representatives because they are supposed to be represented by all the senators and representatives from all the states . 
  however , all of them means effectively none of them care for dc . 
  what do you mean , they are able to ... 
  well , you missed one of the best episodes - [ cartoon wars ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cartoon_wars_part_i ) , 
  me too !, 
  [ somewhere in the background welcome to the jungle ! ], 
  well , they do n't want you to know that , that 's why they did n't blackout completely , 
  yes there are , but one is clearly winning . 
  good that you yourself used the word `` technically '' . 
  yes , they called themselves roman , and they occupied part of the former roman territory . 
  however , it was not the roman empire . 
  whoa , cake day , thanks !, 
  when i think about it , it 's actually hard to describe why i do n't think the eastern roman empire is legitimate continuation of the roman empire . 
  however , i 'll try : the shift of the centre of government is important , the inhabitants of italy were the ruling glass of the empire for the whole duration , formerly they were even the only citizens of the empire , so when you shift from italy to greece/turkey it almost constitutes a different empire . 
  from what i remember , they did not even use latin as the main language . 
  however , i think the main reason is the european-centric view of history . 
  ps : i just looked up for a bit and i realized that we 're having this discussion in the visual studio achievements post  ), 
  - civilization iv, 
  it does n't work like that . 
  we wo n't run out of gas . 
  the price will just go gradually so high that it wo n't be economical to use it in large amounts . 
  you 'll be always capable of getting gas , but it might be so high priced that people use it to just show off vintage cars one day in a year . 
  no , it means he can get the gas however far into the future he goes . 
  he just has to steal it , 
  why the fuck from there ? 
  just from the few vintage gas stations that still sell gas for old cars and are part museums themselves . 
  always . 
  but how do you persuade the look-alike to jump ? 
  surely threatening death is n't an option , he does n't care if he 's shot to death or jumps to death . 
  and given those two options , the logical thing is not to cooperate with the man who 's going to kill you . 
  and i do n't really think sherlock had the time and resources to imprison his family to give this person `` motivation '' . 
  this theory has already been posted on the interwebs for some time now . 
  i think it 's the most probable one , but i still do n't think landing in that rather small truck from that height is very plausible . 
  just does n't seem at all safe . 
  i like op 's theory because it deals with this , but it has a fatal flaw of itself , so ... 
  half through the reading i thought - yes this is brilliant , he could save himself by jumping , that would be the needed incentive . 
  however , i think he could easily jump that far to be killed inside the truck and not on the street , which is the drawback here . 
  or by chance , he could have survived it even . 
  so there had to be someone down there who would still prepare this or another body on the pavement . 
  because if you die inside the truck , you ca n't move the pool of blood with the body to the pavement . 
  i guess we 'll have to wait to see what actually happened . 
  this new technology is taking our jobs !, 
  wait for the sex scene in that one . 
  it 's gon na blow your mind . 
  i do n't see any reason to discuss the medicine in a tv show . 
  it 's not meant to educate . 
  i do n't really think sherlock would force that man to jump for him if he was just moriarty 's victim . 
  it does n't fit with the character at all . 
  i think this whole theory adds more complexity than it solves . 
  i do n't like it . 
  yes , that 's what i expect precisely . 
  it 's like if you watch a movie about hackers , like my favourite [ swordfish ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swordfish_ ( film ) ) . 
  i fully expect people to make fun of the fact that hacking is portrayed as assembling a 3d cube on 7 weirdly positioned monitors . 
  i do n't expect anybody taking this portrayal seriously , it 's a movie , not a documentary . 
  what a big blu-ray disk !, 
  no , it 's expensively imported blue water . 
  he just blue himself . 
  minecraft ruined * gold for me : - /, 
  nope , with the turn of the 20th century the field of political economy became economics and it distanced itself from any moral views . 
  and proved to be very useful . 
  for ethics , there 's the study of ethics . 
  ** no , he would not spin in his grave . 
  ** he would be ( and was ) the first to point out the principle of the ** invisible hand ** . 
  that even though each participant in the process of making an iphone is acting in their own ** selfish interest ** ( apple , foxconn who manufactures idevices , even its employees want to maximize profit/their wages ) , the ** resulting system benefits everybody ** . 
  remember , during the industrial revolution in europe and usa the conditions for workers were about the same as they are now in china , actually they were even worse . 
  but through growth through market capitalism and slowing down of population boom we are now in a blessed state of wealth . 
  china will be there soon too . 
  he was a moral philosopher and economist , but his wealth of nations is not about morality , it 's about economy . 
  and no , invisible hand was not hijacked , that 's how he envisioned the system to work . 
  actually , i think market capitalism is the best system that the humanity has got , and it proved to work very well . 
  although the rise of quality of life in american and british labour landscapes coincides with labour unions , i honestly think you 're overstating their importance greatly . 
  what really helped was the accelerated growth and the most important fact that the population boom stopped . 
  when you have growth and pop . 
  boom , new population eats the growth .
