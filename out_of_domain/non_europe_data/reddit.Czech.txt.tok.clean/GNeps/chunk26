  the problem is that although previous art destroys patent , sci-fi is not considered for this , because , well , it 's sci-fi . 
  i personally do n't agree , but , the courts do . 
  well , i guess you are right , that it can be sometimes allowed , and in this instance i can see why . 
  they could make a water bed with the current technology at that time , therefore it was not part of the science fiction . 
  while padds in star trek were basically ipads , but they needed 50 years of technological innovation to be functional . 
  these are way shorter than i expected ... 
  yep , they say they take the pictures using extra long exposure . 
  they just set up the cameras to detect absence of people and wait for a hurricane panic . 
  real soon, 
  whoa , fuck those idiots , i 'm not going there at all . 
  this is ridiculous . 
  can you elaborate , please ? 
  can you compare to european cities ? 
  because i believe we have strong emphasis on exactly these qualities over here .

  amazing technology we have !, 
  very british . 
  splendid . 
  i 'll take one to go . 
  asimov 's psychohistory is actually the thing that brought me to study economics , because it 's basically psychohistory , a study of people , and incentives . 
  however , what i learned from economics , any interesting predictions are nearly impossible , 
  oh , that 's why i see no predictive comments here !, 
  no , that was just awkward . 
  oh , cool fact , thanks !,

  it could n't have been ma ... !, 
  sometimes when the interaction gets too boring to me , i 'm wishing so much there existed a way i could read a book , while pretending to listen/stay in the interaction , without them noticing . 
  just happened to me about an hour ago today again , 
  this man is absolutely right . 
  i had a huge crush on her since 500 days of summer , but then i started watching her series ** new girl ** , and it completely went away . 
  she 's so ** unsexy ** there . 
  does anyone feel the same , or am i alone ? 
  i need to rewatch 500 days of summer . 
  right now , i ca n't even imagine how she could be as sexy as i remember feeling she was : - /, 
  exactly my thoughts , anybody , please ? 
  edit : found [ it ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ac9udludss ) . 
  thank you !, 
  i do get that , but i hate it . 
  i had this wonderful , beautiful manic pixie dream girl in my memory , and now i lost her . 
  * you should really check out the original british [ the office ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_office_ ( uk \\ ) ) . 
  i find it even more hilarious than the remake , however , it | s unfortunately short . 
  * and when we 're in britain , try red dwarf . 
  * also take a look at scrubs, 
  people , please do n't downvote this man for his opinion !, 
  if you disagree , comment , try to educate !, 
  at least here , in truereddit . 
  i hope neal did n't write the ending :-), 
  the complete and utter opposite is true for me , and i 'd say many or even most of people in this subreddit . 
  meh , there are way better photos to be had . 
   there is never no time for ** e ** hug . 
  ftfy, 
  and right leg .

  speed is the most important thing i need . 
  see [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/sq61k/google_drive_now_live/c4g79vg ) . 
  very interesting story , thank you . 
  it really was unusual , thus interesting . 
  and i thanked for sharing , because i believe it could n't have been easy . 
  i take it as you being the ego , and your brain being the id . 
  i agree . 
  i loved dropbox so much i had to get it , but those $ 10/month have been a drain . 
  25gb for $ 2.49 ? 
  you 're naive . 
  america is no hegemony any more , but it is still one single most powerful country on the face of the earth . 
  think for yourself , not for the hivemind . 
  / european, 
  it 's not god , it 's distinctly jesus !, 
  i do n't really think so , no . 
  i actually like the linked outfit . 
  it 's very bold . 
  and yes , op 's stripes are clashing , but not horrendously , it 's wearable . 
  who cares ? 
  i remember it being something like both of these . 
  it 's nice , very geeky , but fun . 
  no , sorry . 
  i 'd lose the pocket square , and i 'm not a fan of the material of the tie , other than that , unusual and very interesting look . 
  7/10 , would wear again . 
  i 've never been one subscribed to the classic r/mfs uniform . 
  i like being different . 
  i like star trek . 
  watched entire tos , tng , voy and all the movies . 
  i do n't care at all . 
  you might have some mild case of ocd . 
  most people just do n't give a shit . 
  appreciating star trek for what a beautiful work of art it is has nothing to do with bitching if someone quotes it slightly differently . 
  that 's just ocd , obsessively compulsively having to have everything absolutely correct . 
  op looks very ordinary . 
  maybe not ordinary among people who can not dress , but put him in a room with a few people in suits , and he looks almost the same as everybody else . 
  to each his own . 
  oh , why the insult ?
