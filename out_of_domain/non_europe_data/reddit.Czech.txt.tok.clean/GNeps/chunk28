  i must say i utterly hate the pattern . 
  it does n't fit you at all . 
  maybe try some plain coloured one ? 
  or at least way wider stripes . 
  also , i 'm not a fan of that collar , cutaway collar would suit you better . 
  at least if you 're gon na wear it with a tie ( i.e. 
  edit : you were probably just doing it to show off the shirt , but to cover bases :, 
  * always tuck it in , wear a belt . 
  * never button the topmost ( or better yet , 2 topmost ) buttons , unless you 're wearing a tie . 
  * and one more : your ear rings do n't go well with a shirt . 
  but that 's just my opinion , nothing more . 
  i just would n't buy those , i do n't like them . 
  however , the shoe-belt colour coordination is a must only for brown/black leather shoes . 
  with these , you do n't have to do it . 
  do n't get those pink ones . 
  never , ever ,

  never , ever , 
  shirt buttoned to the top without a tie is not a brit look , but a socially awkward professor look . 
  only very few men can really pull it off . 
  yup . 
  you ca n't save that . 
  it 's a piece of ugly ass crap . 
  you 're absolutely right , but to be more precise :, 
   ** dark ** blue . 
  looks best and goes with everything . 
  i think they 're rather ok , but the shoes make them look bloated like that . 
  ditch those shoes . 
  black bow tie would be rather ok with a black suit , but with a blue one , i would n't wear it . 
  different suit , or different bow tie . 
  he 's doing penny . 
  just sayin ' . 
  i know it sounds funny , but i meant it exactly like that , 
  ear rings and a more formal look just do n't jive for me . 
  with a metallica t-shirt sure , but when i 'm in a shirt i 'm in it because it gives more sophisticated look . 
  if you ask me , as long as it 's dark blue , go with any shade of that you like . 
  the differences are n't that great , so it does n't matter . 
  absolutely . 
  this light shade is just not very fashionable . 
  whatever floats your boat . 
  that just means our jeans will stand out as fashionable in the sea of ghastliness . 
  for the collar , it 's not clear from that picture if it 's button-down ( which i really dislike , however i 'm european , button-downs are n't fashionable here at all ) , or just the tips of the collar are really low hanging ( which i do n't like either ) . 
  you could go with a more regular collar , such as on [ this shirt ] ( http://www.ctshirts.co.uk/men's-shirts/men's-shirts-multi-buy-offer/white-twill-non--iron-classic-fit-shirt?q=gbpdefault | | sn061wht | | | | | 406,4352,381 , | | 16.5,17 , | | | | | | & ppp = 130 ) , or the cutaway , which is even more `` open '' , like [ this one ] ( http://www.ctshirts.co.uk/white--poplin--cutaway--slim--fit--shirt?q=gbpdefault | fu006wht | fu006wht | | | | | | | | | | | | | ), 
  congrats on the transition !, 
  i agree with the sentiment . 
  put one on , and you can pull only two looks . 
  the grandpa , and the hipster . 
  both suck . 
  that 's a matter of opinion . 
  i 've never seen a man pull it off , and i 've seen plenty fail miserably ( or achieve success in their hipsterity ) . 
  what you call looking normal looks too much pretentious for me to like it . 
  we 'll have to agree to disagree . 
  if i 'd have to , i 'd go with the sweater vest , that one can be pulled off if you try . 
  that 's obviously unfair comparison . 
  the idiot in the first one is wearing a bow tie , 
  the inherent level of pretentiousness is very high in the cardigan , considerably higher than in the sweater vest . 
  that does not mean you ca n't one up it with a bow tie for instance , 
  how can you fit in there ? 
  he did tell that 80 year old lady she was pregnant . 
  it stopped her hiccups . 
  this was both very funny , and very , very sad . 
  thank you . 
  mitchell and webb are brilliant . 
  whoa , you obviously have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  please exit this subreddit . 
  ftfy, 
  it 's only a bit more south than southern tip of florida , so it does n't outweigh the cost of transportation to the spaceport from mainland usa . 
  ok , pay me when you can . 
  i like the idea of the czech republic being a half of europe  ahoj !, 
  if other 1000 people volunteer , i might put my name into the hat . 
  whoa , that would be the perfect spin-off movie ever . 
  and do n't forget he 's on parole - he could n't leave the state , probably not even vocation outside of princeton . 
  with this he gained freedom . 
  that motorcycle trip could not have happened . 
  fuck caprica , it was no good imho . 
  but i mourn for the fetus of blood & chrome every day . 
  actually , a. c. doyle hated sherlock holmes , he wanted people to to know him for , and was proud of his other works - adventurous novels . 
  i wanted to see more of bsg , the best sci-fi drama i 've ever seen , battles in space , alien spies , cylon cyborgs and all that . 
  not a drama about some girl in the matrix and her dad . 
  i just do n't get why a spin-off from bsg was something like caprica . 
  blood & chrome on the other hand was basically bsg in a different war . 
  i bet it would be brilliant stuff like bsg itself . 
  i absolutely adored californication for many seasons , and was quite fond of it for the rest . 
  i love the character , and i 'd like more of these if possible . 
  so i get why hugh is upset , but we benefit . 
  interestingly enough , californication 's 2nd season ended with the same song as house : [ warren zevon - keep me in your heart ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmtkb-pgxgi ) . 
  note that here , californication did it first , 
  but the question is , would you fake your own death to avoid the prison sentence ? 
  your belt is way too long . 
  cut it from the buckle * side if possible . 
  would be awesome !, 
  i meant buckle side , sorry . 
  with this type of belts you can usually take the buckle off the belt , cut the belt shorter and reattach it . 
  come on , try a little . 
  if anyone 's interested , here 's the hilarious [ independent piece on the treaty of maastricht ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/maastricht--a-runaway-bestseller-1557301.html ) . 
  i love you !, 
  very nice .
