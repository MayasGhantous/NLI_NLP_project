  9/11 was an incest ? 
  you never tip an african american . 
  wow , that 's jay pritchett !, 
  i never realised that !, 
  i knew al bundy as well . 
  i just never put the two faces together !, 
  likely because i saw married with children with czech dubbing on tv , and modern family in english on the internet , so the voice never gave it away until now , 
  ad modern family : it is n't top of the line , but it 's a good show . 
  try a few episodes . 
  who is leela ?? 
  you got me totally confused here . 
  he  it 's all connected !, 
  [ micromorts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micromort ), 
  which episode is that ? 
   `` i 'm gon na do what i 'm gon na do when i want to do it , i do n't care what you think . '', 
  i think that 's a wonderful attitude to life , and i applaud him for it . 
  not seeking approval is the man 's way . 
  actually it 's themself for singular . 
  them can be used in singular . 
  and that 's why there 's the variant `` themself '' for this purpose ,

  * using this method i learned 4500 new words in 8 months , and no , it 's no scam , i jumped from no knowledge to a level b1/b2 . 
  brilliant :d, 
  a guy raising his hand i 'd say . 
  les revenants have great subtitles . 
  and there 's about 15 subtitled episodes of bref , other then that i found nothing : - /, 
  cool !, 
  unfortunately , that 's a tad too high a price tag for me . 
  i do n't think so . 
  orbits are pretty well established , we can compute the exact location of earth millenia into the past . 
  it 's really just not really hard algebra . 
  even coordinates of your room would n't be a problem . 
  that 's a very good point . 
  question is , how much time is needed for the resulting error being more then half a size of a room . 
  i 'd be interested to know that ... 
  wow , i saw it too !, 
  it 's a really weird ... 
  that being said , i donated about $ 20 to the creator , because the app taught me over 4000 french vocabulary in a span of 8 months . 
  and i plan on donating more . 
  edit : just donated another $ 25 , 
  why yes , yes i have !, 
  the youtube channel * [ frenchsounds ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/frenchsounds?feature=watch ) * is a godsend right from french heaven . 
  the woman excellently teaches you to pronounce anything you could possibly need . 
  some of her vidos are in french , but if you 're not comfortable with it , she remade practically all of them into english as well , just scroll and search , 
  i find it quite surprising to see him speak so well , 
  because people doing the names are usually quite retarded . 
  here in czech republic , for instance , the tarantino 's film death proof was translated into something similar to `` killer car '' . 
  i 'm czech and `` killer car '' , or `` auto zabij\u00e1k '' in czech , sounds really ridiculous . 
  100 % sure yes . 
  it would be `` smrti-vzdorn\u00fd '' , which sounds quite natural . 
  do n't look for logic here , they are really just pandering to the masses . 
  yeah , but it is condescending and idiotic nonetheless . 
  i really do n't get why so many people post here asking about grammar . 
  there 's so much info on the internet , there 's textbooks . 
  learn grammar by yourself . 
  after that , join the r/french skype group . 
  start here : http://french.about.com/, 
  also get anki and learn enough vocabulary . 
  wow , very trippy !, 
  the `` endings '' you speak of are conjugations of verbs , and that is grammar . 
  apart from that , get a conversation course at your local alliance fran\u00e7ais , find local people to talk french with , or try the skype group . 
  same here in the czech republic . 
  quite interesting . 
  west , texas ? 
  anyhow , cudos on cool grandfather !, 
  please . craft !, 
  they pay off the fumigation crew to let them cook in the tented houses before they are fumigated . 
  brilliant scheme . 
  sounds like a good plan . 
  downloading now , thanks !, 
  gps satellites are actually in a low earth orbit . 
  i actually did n't mean leo , that 's why i used lower case l and the indefinite article . 
  i just knew that i was quite surprised , exactly as you , that they were n't geosynchronous , 
  by the power of fiction . 
  do n't compare yourself to space gods .
