  and why do you call probable outcome fearmongering ? 
  if you do n't believe me , look at skype . 
  after it was bought by ms , it ceased to be upgraded . 
  i tried it several times , it could n't even make calls oftentimes . 
  after years of nagging on microsoft to do something about it , they released a few bug fixes for the old version . 
  i gave up on using skype altogether thanks to microsoft . 
  i switched to linux a year ago , best thing ever , 
  i actually started using a rolling-release distribution because updates/reinstalls were a bit annoying , it 's pretty awesome , 
  yeah , every time i reboot into windows for some odd game , i 'm staggered how slow and cumbersome it is , 
  it 's complete speculation , i do n't even believe boeing will get it . 
  well , it 's the same principle as dragon but a bit shittier . 
  if i was nasa i would take dream chaser and dragon because then you have two different modes of transport at once . 
  trick question , there was n't any uk before 1801 . 
  and since i 'm back on desktop , the [ kingdom of great britain ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_great_britain ) ( 1707-1800 ) had this [ flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/union_flag_1606_%28kings_colors%29.svg ) . 
  red cross represents england , white cross on blue background represents scotland ( added in 1707 ) . 
  and in 1801 came ireland with red diagonal cross . 
  londonderry !, 
  my mother visited and told me the situation , i wanted to see the reaction . 
  -13 karma is some serious hate indeed , 
  i just wrote the official name of the city :-), 
  of course !, 
  that was the point . 
  how much hate will there be if i mention the * official * name of the city ? 
  if there 's so much hate , why not change it ? 
  probably nothing since both countries will be , again probably , in eu . 
  they 'll lose the right to vote in scottish elections most likely , that 's all . 
  i did n't want to , but just opened a bottle . 
  this is killing me . 
  i thought it was pretty mediocre . 
  definitively a letdown after forever war . 
  but even forever peace is a huge letdown after the brilliance of forever war . 
  it 's mediocre . 
  so why ca n't cygnus meet the crs2 requirements ? 
  and can cst-100 potentially ? 
  ah , reentry , got it . 
  well , since dragon is the only one having a heat shield and offering re-entry , it makes sense it has smaller pressurized volume . 
  another big reason i found is that cygnus does not provide reentry capability . 
  ad the price , well , they might have to scale up the budget , that 's true . 
  let 's hope falcon 9-reusable saves the day though . 
  i agree with the second part . 
  but i would think it * is * a big deal since if you need reentry capability it restricts you from building `` volume-optimized '' spacecraft as you put it . 
  maybe you 're suggesting 2 vehicles , one for big entry and one for smaller entry + renetry ? 
  why ca n't dragon take up propellant if i may ask ? 
  but they can take up propellant in some container to the iss , ca n't they ? 
  well , you started talking about propellant , so i obviously inferred the iss had some sort of engine  why did n't you just say instead that the dragon ca n't boost the iss to a new orbit ? 
  and why ca n't it ? 
  do you need some different berthing equipment to berth where progress does ? 
  yes , i think so too . 
  let 's hope and watch spacex !, 
  dragon certainly does have it 's own engines . 
  it does deorbit after all . 
  the question is i guess one of propellant , of which they surely can figure out how to bring more .

  merci beaucoup !, 
  i 've been counting the days ever since netflix announced it some months ago :-d, 
  french subtitles and often even french dubbing !, 
  any vpn with a server in france will do , but you have to pay for it . 
  canadian netflix has qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois tv show les parent with french subtitles too :-), 
  yes , please step out to make room . 
  well , that is just weird . 
  i have a normal us account , i pay $ 7.99 ( + $ 0.60 tax ) , and when i vpn to france , i just have working french netflix . 
  currently watching a movie . 
  everything works . 
  plus plenty of european netflix users are reporting being able to watch us netflix over vpn , so it works both ways . 
  dunno why it does n't allow you , that is bizarre . 
  heh , that 's really contraproductive on netflix 's part , 
  answered here :, 
  unfortunately , subtitles almost always shorten , because spoken language is faster than reading . 
  but important words are always there , so you can look them up , and that helps . 
  wow , i 'm getting chills , this is scary and spot on . 
  or , you know , you can press the `` save '' button . 
  or ukip getting a majority ... 
  yep , it 's awesome !, 
  how good is the show ? 
  have n't tried it myself . 
  can you give me an example of such a word ? 
  i ca n't find anything on change of aspirated h in the 1990 reform , any source on that ? 
  let 's just take the first word , all dictionaries i tried say `` haricot '' is h aspir\u00e9 , and i believe it is pronounced that way as well , so where is the ambiguity ? 
  that is interesting as i 've never heard of this before . 
  would it be possible to find any source corroborating this ? 
  that `` haricot '' or `` hollandais '' is * not * pronounced with h aspir\u00e9 ? 
  as a foreigner i 'm a bit shocked how many paywalls there are in british journalism . 
  that 's the thing . 
  i watch a lot of french movies and tv series , i 've been to france , to geneva , to bruxelles , and i have n't noticed that at all , hence my skepticism . 
  i just searched if maybe these are changes based on dialect , but the only one i found was acadian , which frankly , is n't really french any more . 
  go on ... 
  i was far from suggesting it was controversial , just that i was being skeptic towards it having not encountered it ever myself . 
  thank you for those great sources and bearing with me . 
  you definitively opened my eyes !, 
  well , here 's an upvote at least for the trouble :-), 
  i know it 's an old discussion , but for the posterity , i disagree . 
  there are tools available today , such as tails , tor , bitcoin and modern cryptography to name just few , that allow a person to remain literally untraceable . 
  it 's just that it 's really , * really * hard not to screw any one small thing up . 
  and that 's how they get you .
