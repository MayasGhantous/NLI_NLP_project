  i 'm not sure what do you mean by `` surface drag '' ( no wiki article ) , but the head-on drag will be smaller in a thinner rocket ( i.e. 
  rocket with a smaller cross-section ) . 
  not the hardest , just extremely hard . 
  i respectfully disagree !, 
  i started learning a month ago , and my opinion is that you do n't really need a book . 
  all the necessary info is available online . 
  my native language is czech . 
  some might argue that my first ( mostly ) self-taught language would be english , since what school gave me was mostly just rudimentary basics , and the rest is attributable to computers and the internet . 
  in high school i was tought german for 3 years , but that did n't stick , i did n't like it . 
  after that i tried spanish courses , did n't stick , did n't like it . 
  some 2 years later , one day i was listening to a radio , and a really beautiful french song came on , and i said to myself , heck , i should try french . 
  being the internet power user that i am , i went there and found plenty of resources , so i said to myself - fuck courses . 
  started with memrise for vocabulary , later switched to anki ( best language tool hands down ! ) . 
  bought a self-teach textbook and went from there . 
  1.5 years later i was at b2 . 
  blazingly fast , since i completely fell in love with the language . 
  the only courses i attended were conversation practice courses . 
  i was recently wondering if my french was deteriorating so i found this test . 
  it 's pretty thorough , reserve at least 30 minutes for it . 
  though of course it does n't test oral skills and such . 
  and french subtitles are available for us learners !, 
  i ca n't say anything about the quality of hk film industry , but the argument based on size just does n't fly . 
  more is n't better , oftentimes it 's the opposite . 
  that being said , any recommendation for mandarin language movies ? 
  though i have to say i 'm not too much of an action movie fan . 
  thanks either way !, 
  the future is now . 
  the future was then . 
  i spent a lot of time reading this blog , very useful info on how to learn : http://www.hackingchinese.com/ . 
  besides that , too many things . 
  here are all my [ chinese bookmarks ] ( http://d.metaverse.cz/f/chinese.html ) . 
  thanks !, 
  sure it can if need be , but is it really efficient and does n't it run down the engines too much unnecessarily ? 
  it 's a hilariously stupid idea , like if they had a substitute teacher that does n't know the first thing about chinese ,

  it would n't be really hard converting simplified ebooks to traditional with a quick computer script . 
  try searching some conversion tool , i bet there is one . 
  ( i 'm on mobile . ), 
  in the meantime , can you share your simplified sources ? 
  just leave the eu already , this constant whining just makes you look like pussies . 
  and leave us scotland , they 're actually cool guys . 
  or you could paint a black square on your arm ... just saying , 
  i disagree with this a lot . 
   the book must be an `` authentic novel . '', 
  this means written by and for adult native speakers . 
  that rules out translations , children 's books , and materials for students . 
  the reason is that these things all dumb-down the vocabulary . 
  why ? 
  i agree it 's a better feeling to read a book in it 's original , and it 's certainly best for classics , but i have no problem reading translated works of more ordinary literature , say whodunits , sci-fi , romance novels , etc. 
  it 's about you liking what you 're reading , get what pleases you . 
  there 's also nothing wrong with children 's books at all if that is something that interests you and you 're about the right level in the language for it . 
   the book must be new to you . 
  if you already read an english translation of the book , do n't try reading it again . 
  it 's not just that this makes it too easy -- it also makes it too boring . 
  has the author never encountered a book he would like to reread ? 
  i reread a book i liked in a foreign language i was learning , and it was great . 
  i was n't really 100 % with my comprehension skills by that point , and reading something you read already is * great * for this . 
   the book should not be too hard . 
  literary writing uses a bigger vocabulary and often uses unusual grammar . 
  science fiction often makes words up . 
  not really a problem with science fiction , do n't worry about it . 
  i find most sci-fi novels use actually simpler language than your average novel , which is great for learners . 
   the author should be one you have n't read before . 
  authors have favorite words and phrases that they reuse a lot . 
  that 's part of why the first chapter or two of a new novel is always the hardest to get through . 
  but if you keep reading books by the same author , you 're not growing . 
  eh , thinking that if you read one book by an author you 've learned all you can from him and are `` not growing '' is delusional . 
  you 'll be looking up words and you definitively wo n't remember them all after your first , second , or even 5th book by the same author . 
  it might actually be better to read more from the same author , because you 'll commit that vocabulary better into your memory and then you can move onto someone else . 
   i have in fact reread all or part of two of the books on my list . 
  they were , respectively , the first books i read in spanish and italian , and i felt i 'd been a bit confused during the first few chapters and i wanted to reread them after i 'd improved . 
  it was fun to clarify a few mysteries that way . 
  however , i 've spoken to a number of people who picked a book because they had already read it in english , but then abandoned it because they already knew the story and got bored . 
  you ca n't reread any book , but a book you would reread even in english . 
  a book that you would reread because you really liked it . 
  and it 's great to appreciate a book the second time in a different language . 
   i suppose the bigger problem for me with sf is that there does n't seem to be much of it in the languages i 'm reading . 
  i asked a mexican friend for suggestions , and he told me he only reads it in english . 
  all sf books you could possibly imagine are translated to spanish as well . 
  translation is n't some horrific disfiguring of a work of literature . 
  especially in the sci-fi genre it does n't really take anything away from the experience . 
   to your third point , if the author has a series that you 're really into , there 's nothing wrong with continuing to read it . 
  motivation is very important , especially for the first few books . 
  but the difference when you start a book by a new author is surprising , and if you 're not expecting it , you can easily get discouraged when you encounter a storm of unknown words . 
  short-story anthologies by various authors are really tough for that reason . 
  you will absolutely encounter a bit more new words when reading a different author . 
  but you will still learn a lot reading books by one author . 
  the difference is n't really considerable in terms of `` growing '' . 
   in short , it 's a balance between finding material that 's interesting enough to motivate you but not so hard that you give up . 
  much of this is going to be a personal decision . 
  all i can do is describe the rules that work for me . 
   so what do you do to choose novels in foreign languages ? 
  the primary criteria is level of language - classics/older only for advanced learners , for intermediate preferring young adult novels . 
  that gives you a category of books . 
  in that i select primarily by enjoyability of reading with slight preference towards books in original language . 
  and i 'd recommend rereading a lot . 
  there are a lot of books i 'd like to get back to , and reading them in a new language is the perfect opportunity for that .
