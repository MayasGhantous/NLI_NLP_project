  i ca n't comment on korean , maybe there are such large differences in thinking between the cultures . 
  but when considering european languages , that does n't apply . 
   i also agree that you want to read a book that is new to you . 
  here , the problem is that if you already know the story , it is easy for there to be an illusion of comprehension when in fact you are not comprehending . 
  that 's exactly why rereading is for . 
  when you 're not fully ready to tackle a full novel in the language , rereading gives you a lot of opportunities to improve . 
  you know what the book says and now you see it in the target language . 
  you learn a lot . 
   i do n't mind reading the same author again , but it is true that in order to master a language , you need exposure to the many different ` voices ' in which that language can be spoken . 
  hence the need to read a wide variety of authors ( and genres . ), 
  nobody is saying you will master a language by reading one author . 
  but you 're certainly learning a lot even when reading 3rd novel by the same author . 
  but by all means , reading just books by one author only is not ideal . 
  reading one novel from each author though is even less so . 
  finding good authors is hard , thus you should enjoy a good source of books you find enjoyable . 
  i just blame it on my bad handwriting skills . 
  i do n't reread a lot . 
  but will you honestly never reread such an astonishing piece of literature as nineteen-eighty-four for instance ? 
  the thrill of reading it , and the ideas contained therein are something you ca n't fully absorb by just one reading . 
  the first part of the show is my favorite sorkin show , bar none . 
  and the second half of the ( only season ) of the show is my least favorite . 
  there 's nothing that can touch the characters and story in the first half , but the second was weirdly resembling the west wing with actors instead of politicians . 
  weird . 
  who said you should reread books in the same year , you 're the one who came with this idea . 
  i reread usually years apart . 
  there are still plenty of books i read years ago i want to return to . 
  and reading them in a different language is a great opportunity for this . 
  reading self-published fiction in english absolutely is n't a big mistake . 
  i spend a lot of my youth while learning english reading self-published fiction and it was great . 
  humans are n't machines , we do n't explode when we find a wrong instruction . 
  learning to spot typos is certainly something that helps a lot in a language . 
  which will totally extinguish the adblocking industry . 
  the same way it ended piracy . 
  it 's ... * not * happening ? 
  if you are presuming a self published literature to be of lower taste than the plentiful garbage is pumped yearly by the book publishers you are mistaken . 
  there are good and bad in both . 
  and it certainly does n't have absolutely anything to do with choosing books to read in a foreign language , so it has no place here . 
  can i ask why your dad did n't teach you any french ? 
  i have ma\u014dri keyboard installed so i can write this \u0101\u0113\u012b\u014d\u016b diacritics for chinese pinyin . 
  so thanks !,

  since there are no taxes on teslas in norway , the price ends up being roughly the same as in the us . 
  and since the prices and salaries in norway are way higher than in the us , it is much more affordable .

  tarzan thank for good laugh !, 
  to add to that , be advised that chinese use the year-month-day format for dates . 
  what last episode ?!, 
  the show must go on !, 
  how is it different than someone else posting a viral ad from say sweden ? 
  it is an ad , but enough people upvoted it ( me included ) , because it is worth watching on its own . 
  well it seems i will be disagreeing with everybody . 
  i highly recommend ** native language -  target language ** . 
  ** english front -  russian back ** . 
  remembering the russian word will always be harder , so if you remember and internalize english -  russian , the ** reverse will come naturally ** . 
  ** doing both wastes too much time ** . 
  i recently speed studied french from 0 to b2 in under a year , and this is the way i did it . 
  among the 5000 anki notes i learned in french , i added maybe 10 in reverse too ( i.e. 
  russian -  english for you ) because they had too many meanings . 
  wow , that 's really interesting !, 
  is cryptologist the same as cryptographer , i.e.

  what do you expect to do at your job if i can ask ? 
  and what did you study at school ? 
  of course not , because then it would make no sense and who wants to watch nonsensical videos . 
  but this video is great to watch even for me who has no intention of buying the product , simply because i am amazed how much you can squeeze into a mobile game . 
  that 's why i upvoted and why i want other people to see it too . 
  for me it was , since i have zero intention of buying a mobile game , yet i appreciated the video . 
  i was amazed what you can do with mobile games nowadays . 
  i use the first two often . 
  sometimes when i do n't want to make it easy for myself by providing the first letter , i just put [ not * synonym * ] as a hint on the front of the card . 
  that has the benefit of me stretching my mind to recall the given word while also being reminded of its synonym at the same time . 
  cool , thanks !, 
  to add to it , there 's similar trivia game called [ triviador ] ( http://triviador.com/ ) in even more languages !, 
  i 'm mildly addicted to it already , 
  arguably , when the child is over 500 months or so , it just might be too late . 
  is the school being taught in arabic ? 
  since dropping a kid at age 6 to a school taught in a language it does n't speak seems like a pretty bad idea . 
  and were you taught by native speakers of all those 3 languages ? 
  i wonder if it 's a good idea to teach a kid a language which you are fluent in , but which is n't your native tongue . 
  true , but at age 41 it probably is n't optimal to learn it by your parents speaking it to you at random , 
  never is a really long time . 
  also , russia did the same thing , and some pretty cool things came from there . 
  like rockets and the ak-47 to name just two . 
  also , why are you spending so much time with your parents at 41 ?
