  i started french with anki from the very start , so 289 hours to learn a language from 0 to b2/c1 vocabulary is a pretty good deal . 
  my french cards are mostly czech ( + english on most cards ) -  french , and tailored to me , so i do n't think they would be of much help to you ( i.e. 
  you 'd be learning a1-c1 words in no particular order ) . 
  i 'd recommend at looking for anki shared decks instead . 
  for georgraphy , i have czech , french , chinese and countries of the world . 
  i presume you 'd be most interested in french , which i already put up on shared decks here :, 
  it contains all 22 french r\u00e9gions with their main and most populous cities ** with pronunciation ** , maps and population numbers . 
  after you learn these , you 'll orient yourself quite nicely in france . 
  well , mars gravity is about 3 times weaker , but the atmosphere is 158 times less dense - parachutes wo n't work . 
  i will be so sad when he inevitably turns evil , hopefully a longtime in the future . 
  the first caesar of mars . 
  impossible !, 
  it is foretold !, 
  it might be the least-bad idea . 
  yeah , it was part of the plot . 
  in selfie there 's no difference there .

  what is ccj ? 
  where do i find it ? 
  i 'm on mobile . 
  amazingly interesting piece of hk history : http://cityofdarkness.co.uk/, 
  dunno if you can get it offline though . 
  thanks !, 
  can i ask why was the first ccj ( presumably r/chinacirclejerk ) banned ? 
  why do n't you just rename it already ? 
  not really . 
  there is a procedure available to change the name , and it was followed and ended here ( per [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/derry#name ) ) :, 
   then the eqia held two consultative forums , and solicited comments from the general public on whether or not the city should have its name changed to derry . 
  [ 21 ] a total of 12,136 comments were received , of which 3,108 were broadly in favour of the proposal , and 9,028 opposed to it . 
  so the british government is not the reason why the name has n't been changed . 
  do n't worry , we 'll meet at the next sorkin . 
  let 's just hope the most unique screenwriter in america lives long and productive life , 
  the donocast never happened !, 
  honestly from my west wing experience , i do n't know why you 'd want to be covering the white house . 
  it looks like pretty cushy but very boring end-of-career posting . 
  wow , that 's really sad . 
  i * love * his shows , i 've seen them all . 
  can you point me to that quote ? 
  what is he gon na do now ? 
  i 'm not sure if the voice was hers , but i 'm certain her mouth movements did not match with the singing . 
  question is whether she lip-synced to herself or someone else singing . 
  how do you know he does n't know ? 
  can i ask what have capital letters ever done to you ? 
  it 's really painful to read . 
  here 's your first mission by popular demand : area 51 !, 
  exactly , i do n't think there 's any reason not to use dragon v2 , since it will also make it cheaper thanks to economies of scale . 
  but is n't one of the requirements for crs-2 to take cargo from iss to earth ? 
  cygnus ca n't do that . 
  he could have moved away a bit . 
  from the [ crs-2 wiki page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commercial_resupply_services ) :, 
   the anticipated contract will include `` delivery of pressurized and unpressurized cargo , return and disposal of pressurized cargo , disposal of unpressurized cargo , and ground support services for the end-to-end resupply mission '' and will include : ... 
  it depends on what `` return '' means , but i 'd say it has to be return to earth , because where else ? 
  i think you can dispose of cargo with the dragon , since it has the module for unpressurized cargo for the way up that burns up on the reentry . 
  it 's just not necessary to use it , since cygnus burns it all . 
  but i remember reading somewhere that nasa needs to send some stuff safely to the earth , like experiments and such . 
  always bugs me that it 's not possible . 
  why ? 
  there 's no bloody reason not to allow it !, 
  not true , santa claus lives in [ rovaniemi , finland ] ( http://www.santaclausvillage.info/ ) !, 
  more like a sweatshop . 
  all those exploited elfs !, 
  it 's better to manufacture dragon v2 with 2 different sized hatches than to manufacture 2 completely different dragons , from economic standpoint . 
  i dunno if a larger hatch is needed though . 
  of course they gut the life support . 
  that 's not hard to do . 
  but they 'll keep the capsule as close to manned version as possible . 
  since more volume = less cost . 
  why ? 
  you can make dragon v2 with berthing mechanism instead of docking mechanism . 
  and nobody is suggesting it should be used as a lifeboat , especially when we agreed they 'll surely gut the lifesupport . 
  a manned dragon v2 will be there for that . 
  saturn v had 118 tons to leo , clocking at 262 horses . 
  so bfr at 220 tons can lift about 488 really dead horses to low earth orbit . 
  488 really deeeeeeeeaaaaaaad horses floating in low earth orbit . 
  that he got somewhere else and did n't need to be there at all if i remember . 
  that writing tablet looks ok , should work . 
  i can also recommend getting an android tablet ( as in large smartphone as opposed to a writing tablet ) . 
  you can easily write chinese characters on that if you download the right keyboard , and it 's really cool way to browse the web . 
  can i ask how come you guys do n't know pinyin ? 
  perhaps because you are not mandarin speakers ? 
  interesting !, 
  by the way , i 'm sure you know that you can also enter characters on the computer by way of zhuyin . 
  did your parents not use any form of pronunciation notation when learning chinese ? 
  that 's interesting , because i know i would n't be able to learn the language that way at all . 
  why ca n't it dock between those days ? 
  i thought that since iss has an orbital period of about 90 minutes , you can launch and rendez-vous with it anytime you want . 
  for * posterity , if anyone is interested a little more about the beta angles , here is a great explanation : http://www.quora.com/what-are-beta-angles-especially-as-they-refer-to-the-iss, 
  i knew it sounded weird somehow , thanks !, 
  and the possibility of using 3 bfr/mct cores with 9 of those beasts each . 
  bravo !, 
  hi , take a look at the [ anki online manual ] ( http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.htm ) , it 's great !, 
  [ this part especially ] ( http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#notes-&amp;-fields ) relates to your issue .
