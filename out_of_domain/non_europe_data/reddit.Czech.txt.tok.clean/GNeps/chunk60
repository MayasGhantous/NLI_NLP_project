  well , '' * that part of reddit * '' is generally understood to be something akin to / r/gonewidl ( sic ) . 
  so op is retarded , as is tradition . 
  attaboy !, 
  i did too , and i am from brno !, 
  it 's ok , they all masturbate to japanese porn in the end . 
  love prevails . 
  do young people speak it ? 
  i heard it 's in grave decline in that regard . 
  they have a big reason not to use it - immigration . 
  when way over half the population are immigrants who do n't speak the language , you just have to use mandarin to communicate . 
  cantonese is dying in the same manner . 
  their culture is dying due to their economic success , it 's rather ironic . 
  to my understanding there 's a mandarin-only policy on teaching in schools across mainland china , so that 's not specific to shanghai . 
  what i read though is that shanghai authorities were trying to make recordings of shanghainese for preservation , and were not able to find even 4 speakers of proper shanghainese . 
  on reddit , but i ca n't for the life of me find the source i read . 
  i found article talking about the same thing here :, 
   earlier projects to record shanghai 's local language ran into major problems when the city could n't find enough what it deemed `` true '' shanghainese speakers . 
   during the last recruitment process , two of 13 recruitment sites were able to find `` pure '' shanghainese speakers -- that 's out of an estimated 14 million people who speak the language ( shanghai has an official population of 23 million ) . 
  but they are talking about `` pure '' shanghainese . 
  so you 're saying the language evolved , but is doing well ? 
  well , to support my `` grave decline '' claim , here 's [ demographics of shanghai ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_shanghai ) :, 
   about 9 million out of the 23 million residents of shanghai , or more than 39 % , are long-term migrants , triple the 3 million in 2000 . 
  they account for the entire population increase as shanghai 's natural growth rate has been negative since 1993 due to its extremely low fertility rate [ 9 ] -- just 0.6 in 2010 , probably the lowest level anywhere in the world . 
  reading further on [ shanghai and languages ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shanghai#language ) stresses that the immigrant population does not speak shanghainese and thus results to using mandarin as lingua franca . 
  so , we have a population of shanghai that went from 17 % of immigrants to 39 % in not even 15 years , most of which do not speak the language . 
  that trend is practically impossible to stop . 
  and since the shanghainese speakers speak mandarin without trouble , i read several accounts that mandarin is the established lingua franca throughout shanghai . 
  ( though they say if you order in a restaurant in shanghainese you get better prices  ), 
  couple that with the fact that due to mandarin being lingua franca , and the pushed language from on high , i do n't think immigrants will learn much shanghainese if any at all , and that means their kids wo n't either . 
  what all this constitutes is to the reader to decide for himself , but my opinion is we 're seeing a dying language . 
  and i hear [ cantonese is facing the same fate ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cantonese/comments/2o8hvr/help_the_decline_of_cantonese_in_china_or_chinese/ ) . 
  also not a book . 
  do you know of any good resources on the southern accent ? 
  from my experience over the last 2 years , arch updates are pretty safe , unlike what you might have read . 
  i usually update once a month , usually when i think of it ( like right now  ) , and i do n't think i 've had any real problem with it . 
  i also do n't read archlinux.org before updating , when there 's some error message , i search for it and every time find a fix afterwards . 
  my advice is , do n't fret about it . 
  that 's a big plus for updating infrequently - less chance of encountering an unfixed bug . 
  i already wrote a rebuttal to this in [ another branch of this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/2sjwrt/those_who_learn_obscure_languages_what_are_some/cnr3wsb ) , if you would n't mind reading it . 
  i welcome any reactions . 
  and [ here is a discussion ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cantonese/comments/2o8hvr/help_the_decline_of_cantonese_in_china_or_chinese/ ) of people actually living in guangdong agreeing the language is very much dying there in every sense of the word . 
  though thanks to hong kong , cantonese maybe can survive there . 
  however , from reading / r/hongkong recently , the people there do n't seem to feel much optimism for keeping their separate identity ( and language ) in the future . 
  you might like [ persian radio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id-50a8fv8u ) :-d, 
  man , they are prepared for precision powered landing , that requires extreme precision . 
  your worry is completely misplaced . 
  yes . 
  i would direct you again to the [ discussion on current state of cantonese in guangdong ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/cantonese/comments/2o8hvr/help_the_decline_of_cantonese_in_china_or_chinese/ ) . 
  to offer just one quote :, 
   in the old days , apparently , you could totally get by on spoken cantonese [ in guangdong ] . 
  absolutely not the case anymore . 
  we tried life in shunde , we tried guangzhou city , and recently ended up simply moving to hk so that we can survive on cantonese . 
  remember that cantonese was a language of over 60 million speakers , and in the last 20 years it has suffered this quick fate in mainland china . 
  and sadly , reading r/hongkong lately , the people there do n't feel optimistic at all about being able to keep their separate identity ( and language ) in the long run , so the last bastion of cantonese will probably die out too . 
  also , i 've been watching a lot of hk cinema , and the main language has definitely shifted to mandarin in the last decade in my opinion . 
  also the government has shifted its language position from bilingual cantonese/english to cantonese/mandarin/english due to growing pressure both from the central government , and immigration . 
  those 14 million people wo n't disappear , they will die . 
  and since it is n't the primary spoken language any more , the rate with which it is passed onto further generations will be extremely low . 
  couple that with one of the lowest fertility rates in the world , and ever increasing proportion of mandarin speakers , rendering the language less useful each year . 
  if current state of cantonese in china is to be taken as example , the fate of the language is already sealed . 
  i played like 100 hours of 0.90 ksp x64 on linux in the last few weeks and had 0 crashes . 
  i used a lot of mods too . 
  you have a really wonky math there . 
  i 'm sorry , i 'm not gon na read that . 
  i was referring to the actual math - this among other things :, 
   amount of people willing to go to florida = ~ ( number of people comfortable traveling in cars ) * ( number of people comfortable traveling in planes ) / ( ( cost of traveling to florida by car ) * ( cost of traveling to florida by plane ), 
  this is not correct at all . 
  and to make things worse , it 's missing a closing bracket . 
  spoken like a true fat chicken . 
  but they 'll only work on mars . 
  like everything , mars needs the `` killer-app '' , and hoverboards will be it !, 
  charlie is likeable still !, 
  just a little bit . 
   anyhow , no matter what he does he 'll be likeable because he does n't really understand what he did , consequences and all that . 
  a lovable idiot for ever !, 
  but he only did it after being told they were doing that to him . 
  he considered it normal . 
  why is it depressing ? 
  way more people use instagram/whatsapp/snapchat than spacex . 
  they provide a useful service too . 
  spacex is incredibly small at this stage , look at the valuation when they 'll be hauling people to mars . 
  yet it 's fucking dead here . 
  what gives ? 
  any sources on the havana or caracas ? 
  i do n't think there are plenty of rich people in cuba at all . 
  it has n't been their millennium ( or two ) so far . 
  americans of all nations , unite !, 
  well congratulations , you finally made it !, 
  sure , they were n't that poor in those few decades . 
  but it 's still a far cry from the days of ancient greece and the hellenized eastern roman empire ( a.k.a. 
  byzantine ) . 
  i would say their best year was 555 ad , the greatest extent of the hellenized eastern roman ( a.k.a. 
  byzantine ) empire ruled by the ethnically greek roman emperor justinian the great from the famously wealthy and influential greek city of constantinople . 
  they even stopped trying to remove kebab from constantinople !, 
  actually , the orbit they plan to use is quite close to the iss ( in space terms ) , so it would n't be a problem at all . 
  electric cars rely heavily on the `` regenerative brakes '' to slow down , basically the engine recaptures some of the kinetic energy through induction . 
  brakes will still be needed , but i suspect only a light tap on them will be enough . 
  you 're not using your imagination . 
  a 5 ton vehicle will not have a tesla model s engine . 
  it will have properly scaled up engine , that will slow down perhaps equally as fast .
