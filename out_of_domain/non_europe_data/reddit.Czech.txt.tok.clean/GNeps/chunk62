  the best answer you can get is : yes . 
  i do n't remember any apocalypse in snow crash . 
  and calling anathem `` post apocalypse story '' is a little misguided . 
  productivity . 
  well , it works to a point . 
  it certainly would n't rise the level of mountain lakes and such . 
  only if you work with your nose . 
  well , sugar sugar still gets some playtime even today . 
  it 's a fun albeit unsophisticated song , 
  same thing . 
  well , 4 days before that picture there were 6 living presidents i believe . 
  therefore both those interludes you provided are tied * for a second place * . 
  oh right , pardon me . 
  evropa in czech . 
  that 's how nostradamus did it . 
  what 's the reference there ? 
  let 's hope not on the last position . 
  you do know that the `` top '' on a map is called north and the `` bottom '' is called south right ? 
  it sounds like pre-schoolers talking . 
  yes it did , what the fudge ? 
  building an ice town for the whole of america !, 
  define well . 
  we know that in free fall your bone density wastes away and exercise does not make it better , so a prolonged stay in free fall can render you disabled after return . 
  that completely depends on the radius and rpm . 
  say on a niven ring , you just would n't notice it * at all * . 
  it really does n't work here in the czech republic , neither does it work in france nor poland . 
  us vpn worked though , so [ here ] ( http://uloz.to/xxwjw3pk/11-newspace-global-thruster-june-2014-leaders-of-newspace-pdf ) . 
  oh my god , it never occurred to me the us was so far behind at that point . 
  big thanks !, 
  it 's been nagging me for some time now . 
  edit : well this is interesting : walker flew in 1963 , full 2 years later than alan shepard in the mercury program !, 
  why the hell were they still testing how high can the x-15 go by that point ? 
  edit2 : i know why i was confused about the order of things : when i was young i saw a movie about the x-15s that i believe had it reversed . 
  my 10yo self believed in the dramatization , 
  any idea why they still tested the x-15 by that point ? 
  my understanding was that the x-15 program was conducted * before * gemini . 
  but now i see most of the flights took place after shepard went to space !, 
  see above , i was completely confused about the sequence of things . 
  arrrrrtificial gravity !, 
  top gear 's [ reliant robin shuttle ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjdrlwr-yfm ) might be safer than the shuttle too , 
  i 'm not sure , but i suspect it reached space only [ after the war , launched by the us ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v-2_sounding_rocket ) . 
  edit : wrong . 
  1942 , nazi germany . 
  well , it 'll always be `` technically different '' , since it 's artificial gravity . 
  i 'm saying at those sizes you ca n't notice it at all . 
  the longest ever continuous stay in space seems to be 438 days . 
  you just ca n't extrapolate that into 20 years . 
  plenty of problems that are manageable after 438 days will be debilitation after 20 years . 
  we already know that bone density loss gets progressively worse after prolonged stay in free fall . 
  that 's a big problem . 
  how is it being `` replaced '' ? 
  comcast is not being bought by google . 
  google is bringing its own services . 
  that is what is called a `` competition '' , which is undeniably good for consumers in every way . 
  it means we * should * expect the same in 1/3g . 
  not that it 's there , but we should expect it . 
  that 's not the point . 
  if you have 24 hour turnaround , that means you only have to work 24 hours on refurbishing that rocket . 
  it 's about costs , not about time necessarily . 
  if it takes a month to refurbish it , on the other hand , you have to have it in a factory for a month , taking up space , you have to pay workers to work on it for a month , etc. 
  you 're not using your brain . 
  of course some gravity is better than none . 
  but the issue is , some gravity is worse than full gravity . 
  potentially debilitatingly worse . 
  nope . 
  that 's exactly the same as with gravity . 
  your head will have less gravity ( and thus acceleration ) than your feet . 
  you 've got some balls !, 
  eh , let 's not force it . 
  much more likely he 's checking if the driver 's all right and since he is , truck drives away . 
  buuuuut was it * truly * ? 
  i always find it funny that `` taxation without representation '' the americans fought a revolutionary war over is now practiced in the us capital . 
  whoever thought of that was wicked , 
  lol . 
  that kinda depends on your religious beliefs , does n't it ? 
  not really . 
  depends on the definition of `` jihadist '' . 
  it is part of the religion of over 1.5 billion people . 
  and it says you wo n't go to hell for it . 
  and since the only laws governing who goes and does n't go to hell are in religion , it strongly depends on your religion . 
  when i visited i loved the * dc voting box * stickers on trash cans , 
  i would say that 's a pretty misguided guess i believe . 
  but then again , we would have to ask them . 
  well , since the shuttle could land like a glider without engines , it did n't need fuel to land . 
  so you can say the same about propulsive landing - it just adds more weight ( in fuel ) to land that way . 
  the real question is what is heavier , wings or fuel for propulsive landing ? 
  my guestimate would be that in earth atmosphere for heavy payloads , wings are better . 
  for example i do n't think it would be economical to land the space shuttle ( sans wings ) using propulsive landing . 
  that 's the thing , what is a `` jihadist '' exactly ? 
  you 're viewing this from a completely christian/western mindset . 
  you view `` hell '' as being a bad place for bad people . 
  but morality is subjective , remember that . 
  the fact of the matter is , who goes to hell is directed by the koran . 
  and koran plainly and in no vague way states that killing kaffirs ( nonbelievers ) is acceptable , and oftentimes necessary . 
  then they do n't follow the teaching of mohamed , and are n't really muslim . 
  plenty of things are open to interpretation , this one though , is not . 
  however , to be fair , people of most religions are hypocrites , not just muslims . 
  if you 'd like to know more , i suggest [ christopher hitchens ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cgfmwtjtye&amp;list=wl&amp;index=18 ) . 
  if you believe propulsive landing is always better , why do you suppose the space shuttle landed on wings ? 
  anyway , ignorance of religious people notwithstanding , the point stands :,
