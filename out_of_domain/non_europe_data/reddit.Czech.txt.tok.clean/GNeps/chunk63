  admission to hell is governed by religion . 
  islam * absolutely plainly * states killing kaffirs is ok . 
  isis is not going to hell according to islam . 
  it * most certainly * depends on your religion whether you think isis will go to hell . 
  well , that 's a highly biased way to interpret the safety , since it carried disproportionately more crew then other space vehicles . 
  the actual critical failure rate was 2/135 , which is pretty good as general space vehicles go . 
  though other * manned space vehicles * are a bit safer , that 's true . 
  anyway , i do n't like the shuttle either , but i just do n't think it would be viable to land it propulsively . 
  the technology was n't there at the time at least . 
  well , moon landing is one thing , but remember that engines at that time did n't even have an engine-out capability , especially the larger ones that you 'd need to land something as heavy in 1g . 
  it would be pretty unsafe to land on that . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , i think falcon 1st stage separates still in atmo , does n't it ? 
  are you aware of where you are ? 
  i hitch-hiked through germany several times and can confirm : you will not get far with english , it 's far from universal . 
  can you give examples ? 
  absolutely holds up . 
  it was n't intended for children anyhow . 
  maybe that 's why ... 
  i never got why anyone would want to see that . 
  or it 's like they took the colours most associated with each browser and used them . 
  i wish they 'd opensource it . 
  if they did that , they 'd actually have a chance instead of fading into history . 
  they like setting things on fire . 
  you are in south sudan , or what do you mean ? 
  and people wonder about the high suicide rate ... 
  afaik they backed from the forced g + account thing . 
  try cancelling them now . 
  oh man , new shameless today , i 'd almost forget !, 
  that 's just a note saying the image is outdated , since since then the country of south sudan separated from sudan , i got the note too . 
  try clicking around , the image itself should still be visible . 
  what 's the 17 years about ? 
  wow , that 's fucked up . 
  it 's not an error message though . 
  wow , that 's a brilliant observation !, 
  well , no ebooks , no local libraries , and no bookshops/used book stores carry it on this continent as far as i can find . 
  and shipping from the us is kinda expensive . 
  thanks a bunch for the link !, 
  thanks !, 
  god bless america !, 
  or would embrace the new form of transportation for themselves !, 
  no more being stuck in traffic !, 
  i think that 's too optimistic . 
  bureaucrats do n't like to take risks . 
  i suspect they 'll have to do 10 + flawless landings in a row before they will be allowed . 
  most likely 15 years ago there was n't the technology necessary to make reusability economically viable . 
  technically , rockets * are * an improvement on rocket-powered planes such as the x-15 . 
  both get us into space , rockets just allow us to stay longer ( achieve orbit ) . 
  confirmed , works in chrome but not in firefox on my linux system . 
  lady expects it by now . 
  as a fellow european , what do you mean ? 
  tesla sells cars in the eu and has almost as many charging stations here as in the us . 
  and i have no doubt these batteries will sell here in europe too . 
  [ tesla supercharger network ] ( http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger ) , scroll and click on europe , you 'll see western and parts of central europe littered with superchargers . 
  spain and eastern europe coming soon ( click on 2015/2016 ) . 
  plus , you can order tesla anywhere in europe i believe , they just ship it to you , same as in the us . 
  well , the 2016 map has a really good coverage of italy , though be warned , tesla is known to drag the schedule a bit , they like to get it right instead of fast , 
  can anyone tell me what am i looking at please ? 
  i 'm buying one to shorten my daily commute asap !, 
  oh , thanks !, 
  why then for the love of all that is holy are there `` l-times '' instead of `` t-times '' ? 
  just so the plebs like me ca n't understand it ? 
  looks more like a plane to me ... 
  it works for me ... 
  we need to offset the shitposting of oldfags . 
  balance must be struck !, 
  to me it shows :, 
   ** ca n't but **, 
   also , * can not but * . 
  see [ ca n't help ] ( http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/can%27t+help ) . 
  damn , got ta give baroque cycle a try . 
  almost 3000 pages scare me , but then again , anathem * was * bloody awesome . 
  different readers . 
  remember , evaluation is subjective . 
  i 'm a european and i loved to kill a mockingbird . 
  and it 's not devoid of its significance in europe or everywhere else - racism is everywhere , even here . 
  especially now . 
  you might want to take a look at the [ baroque cycle ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/series/49317-the-baroque-cycle ) , it might tickle your fancy . 
  absolutely . 
  this one though , is great . 
  the story is very humane and touching , and i really loved it . 
  the [ commonwealth saga ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/series/40740-commonwealth-saga ) by peter f. hamilton . 
  have you tried [ cryptonomicon ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816.cryptonomicon?from_search=true ) or maybe [ anathem ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024-anathem?from_search=true ) ? 
  have you tried [ the perks of being a wallflower ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22628.the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower?from_search=true ) ? 
  exactly , 4 * = 80 % , so if you think the book was 90 % great , you have to round up to 5 whole stars . 
  i personally much prefer 10 point scales . 
  absolutely do , cryptonomicon is one of the most insightful and eye-opening books i 've read . 
  and anathem was an awesome ride with spectacular world-building . 
  that looks very cool , thanks !, 
  right , like churchill did n't have a ~ ~ butler ~ ~ valet to put on his shoes . 
  to the downvoters : here he is , [ norman mcgowan ] ( http://qi.com/infocloud/winston-churchill ) , valet ( personal servant ) to mr. churchill . 
  well for most of them it sure was , if you 're referring to the behaviour of the red army . 
  both of which were prosperous and peaceful by world standards . 
  to the downvoters : east germany was the richest country of the soviet bloc , richer than latin america and all of africa and continental asia . 
  and that 's exactly why they say that . 
  the speedier launches is because the infrastructure and procedures of spacex are improving , not because 1.1 is faster to prepare for launch . 
  if you 're asking why hitler started the world war ii , it was because he believed germany and germans to be superior to all other races and cultures , and wanted to extend his empire over the face of the earth . 
  he viewed the russians , similarly to jews , as subhuman . 
  as to why he went especially after russia - well because he conquered practically every other continental european country , and he knew he did n't have a chance at conquering the uk , so he went for the rest - russia . 
  another big reason was that he wanted russian oil fields .
