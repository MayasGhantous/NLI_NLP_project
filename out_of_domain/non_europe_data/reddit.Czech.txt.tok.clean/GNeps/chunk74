  i do n't think there 's any other * real * and feasible solution to greece 's troubles . 
  i 'd say 10 years of major adjustment pain . 
  but that 's all speculation . 
  do you know of any better solution for greece ? 
  trying to solve insolvency of the greek state as illiquidity , as has been done up to now , is clearly not working one bit . 
  and gdp per capita is surely going to adjust , but if you have n't noticed , it 's been adjusting already . 
  i do n't think you can stop it one way or the other . 
  that 's actually not possible . 
  there are two options :, 
  putting the ** asteroid directly in the orbit of the sun : ** if you put it directly into sun 's orbit ( like all planets are , but moons are n't ) somewhere between sun and venus , it would be closer to the sun , and therefore it would * have to * orbit faster . 
  thus providing shade only for a few minutes every orbit ( `` year '' ) . 
  you * could * put it in what 's called a ** [ lagrangian point ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lagrangian_point ) 1 : ** that way it would always hover directly between the sun and venus . 
  however , lagrangian point 1 is relatively very close to venus , thus you 'd have to put an object similar in size to venus itself to provide any significant shade . 
  and if we could move planets , it 'd be better to move venus farther out than try this crazy machination . 
  you 'd have to have thousands upon hundreds of thousands of asteroids to create shade for any significant portion of the year . 
  the space is unimaginably vast , and the elliptical orbits would match up for only a brief moment . 
  i started salivating . 
  annexation is exactly as peaceful as the opinion of the people getting annexed . 
  if they want to get annexed , it 's absolutely peaceful . 
  examples would be : anschluss - annexation of austria by germany in '38 - vast majority of the country just welcomed hitler . 
  another one i think would be very peaceful would be italian annexation of albania , iirc they always wanted to be part of italy . 
  ad austria - [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anschluss#german_troops_march_into_austria ) describes it thus :, 
   on the morning of 12 march , the 8th army of the german wehrmacht crossed the border to austria . 
  the troops were greeted by cheering german-austrians with nazi salutes , nazi flags , and flowers . 
  [ 25 ] because of this , ** the nazi annexing is also called the blumenkrieg ( war of flowers ) ** , but its official name was unternehmen otto . 
  [ 26 ] for the wehrmacht , the invasion was the first big test of its machinery . 
  although the invading forces were badly organized and coordination among the units was poor , it mattered little because ** no fighting took place ** . 
  i ca n't find any source on any soldiers who died in battle during the anschluss , but i 'd welcome it if you could find it . 
  ad albania : yeah , i was n't very sure about what time period i remembered that from , that 's why i used the `` iirc '' . 
  sorry , probably not 20th century . 
  i really like the first and last one . 
  what about snp ? 
  which is kind of accurate ... 
  you discovered reddit . 
  it is . 
  but water usage is n't in * any way * related to economic output . 
  why would it be ? 
  yup . 
  i 'm not worried about solar . 
  it 's now price competitive with its alternatives . 
  it 's going places , and that 's just the start . 
  that 's because it is . 
  lobbying is ugly and corrupt way of doing `` democracy '' . 
  hey , tall buildings are probably the most beautiful things our current civilization makes !, 
  leave them be !, 
  `` ladies and gentlemen and combinations thereof . '', 
  maybe . 
  but that same thing happened with the start of the industrial revolution . 
  and i have to say , i 'm quite glad they did it . 
  short term . 
  long term every single human being is reaping the benefits . 
  and people forget how miserable it was even before all that . 
  basic income . 
  makes you think how lightly and without much oversight is this punishment used in prisons on non-murderous offenders . 
  but why do you think there was bigger budget then ?? 
  that 's just another aspect of competition !, 
  the soviets had amazing rocket scientists , russia inherited them , but i 'm a bit worried they 're not making that many new ones . 
  i 'm sorry , there was n't any direct war . 
  cold war is just another name for competition . 
  what i am saying is that 's never going to happen . 
  ~ / dev, 
  live a little , 
  i personally never liked those . 
  by being afraid of bodies of water . 
  it 's not an isolated issue but a systemic problem i believe . 
  soviets really pushed that space program in competition with the americans , but now that drive has ended , and it 's all going downhill . 
  nobody 's saying that . 
  but these things can snowball on you , you know . 
  you start off with a minor fuck-up , and in the end this happens . 
  working for the german government in the us ... are you a spy ? 
  so ... you * are * a spy . 
  good to know , kudos , 
  you start off in the traffic , and you end up asking for mcdonalds breakfast at 11:33 . 
  how about a * data miner * ? 
  you 're unstoppable !, 
  pepes tomorrow ? 
  have n't you heard ? 
  pepe is of kill !, 
  we need to establish bitcoin superiority in trading new rare wofls !, 
  we ca n't let this market go to that wretched * dogecoin * !, 
  cars do n't come with license plates , you request a license plate for your new car from the state . 
  at least in europe . 
  the problem is , china wants to limit the number of polluting cars on the roads , so they charge up to 3200 usd for a license plate -- without which you ca n't drive the car of course . 
  i disagree . 
  if you have to limit the number of cars on the road , it should be based on who is willing to pay the most , because they derive the most utility out of it . 
  that does n't solve the issue at all . 
  look at paris , one of the wealthiest cities on the planet with very strict environmental regulation . 
  yet they had a smog alert again this year and had to disallow half of all cars from the road . 
  even the least polluting combustion engine cars are just too polluting in a city as big as paris . 
  and chinese cities are much much bigger , and the people are poorer so they ca n't afford cars as expensive . 
  they declared that on monday , wednesday and friday only cars with license plates ending with an even number can drive . 
  and vice versa . 
  no no no , this was a week long measure because of a smog alert . 
  they enacted it so far 3 times over the last 20 years . 
  everybody knows it 's not a permanent solution because of the reasons you outlined . 
  that 's why auctioning off the license plates is a much better idea . 
  yeah , i think it was enacted in beijing for a few months before the olympics . 
  well , osx is closer to gnu+l inux , whereas android * is * linux , but it 's not gnu . 
  i 'll do you one better - sshfs . 
  i absolutely love it .
