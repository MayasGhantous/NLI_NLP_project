  if you want to know more , look at oil shocks in the 80s , the world is a * lot * less dependent on oil ( per $ of gdp ) now than before the oil shocks because of them . 
  remember the fad of the development of electric cars that started in the 80s ? 
  oil shocks . 
  electric cars starting to get big now ? 
  oil prices have never been higher . 
  next time jerk off more quietly so you can hear the dialogue . 
  probably too poor to get a calculator . 
  that 's complete nonsense . 
  and that 's just from the start of this year !, 
  because they want to live in the rich countries , not the poor ones . 
  even if they are n't economic migrants outright , and they really are refugees from a war torn country , the moment when they travel through several safe countries to get to the eu , they become just another group of economic migrants . 
  honestly , i do n't think anyone can blame them for it , but we really ca n't take them all . 
  by now , probably france . 
  i noticed that right away . 
  an almost all male muslim population , frustrated , mostly without jobs and grouping in large numbers at a time when fundamentalist islam is at its all time high . 
  that 's a recipe for good times . 
  i think the interesting question is , when these immigrants are running from poor islamic countries to rich christian countries , why are they then trying to establish islamic law in them ? 
  that 's not only ungrateful , but also incredibly stupid . 
  where ? 
  in lebanon ? 
  i agree . 
  it could have easily been staged by one of merkel 's opponents , either inside her own party , or from other parties . 
  that 's probably true , but i think even a dumber than average person can see that making the new country like the old shitty country is a bad move . 
  i concur with all that , but i do n't see where 's the `` actual genocide '' they are facing ? 
  i mean , in the future if all goes to shit , there could be a potential genocide , but it 's nowhere close to being an actual genocide right now . 
  that 's pretty cool !, 
  what happens if the `` eorpa '' was n't capitalized ? 
  would it just be `` heorpa '' ? 
  i would have thought that 'd be pretty confusing . 
  interesting !, 
  do you always capitalize the word that 's being eclipsed so it 's more readable , or is this a coincidence ? 
  that 's how it started with tv too , the ads were n't that intrusive so people swallowed it . 
  and then they increased them and increased them year over year and we got to where we are now . 
  i believe it 's my responsibility to not let this thing happen again in this new medium , and thus they will never get my money unless they offer ad-free experience . 
  as they should . 
  but i do n't feel like fleeing their country and leaving the rest of the people there to fight or die is the right thing to do . 
  wow , 
  same here . 
  ads for free content are perfectly all right , got ta fund thing somehow . 
  but if i 'm paying , i will not tolerate any ads , i 'd rather pay more . 
  for vocabulary i swear by [ anki ] ( http://ankisrs.net/ ) , learned over 5000 french vocabulary with it in one year . 
  as collectibles for the future !, 
  lol , yes we did !, 
  hey !, 
  i 'm totally down for that , but i got ta install it again , it stopped working for some reason . 
  shit , try wiping it out completely and reinstalling ? 
  anyway , i 'm leaving for a vacation for 3 days , so see you afterwards !, 
  yeah , they devaluated . 
  deal with it . 
  in a thread that is only about those spoilers ? 
  are you serious ? 
  every top comment has the name of the show it 's discussing as the very first word or at the very least in the first sentence . 
  stop reading there . 
  also , get over yourself , spoiler is n't a death sentence . 
  [ you irl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f68vxkmzt1q ), 
  not necessarily . 
  this is a guide for people like me with a visual memory . 
  and it 's pretty awesome . 
  i actually learned morse code a while back by making something similar to this in my mind for each letter . 
  so i can assure you it works great !, 
  no it 's not . 
  t is the second most frequently used letter in the english alphabet , so it got the dash . 
  this guide is made after the fact , not the reason the letters got these translations . 
  that changes nothing about what i said . 
  huh ? 
  c is - . - . 
  it 's read counter-clockwise in this instance , as if you were actually writing the letter . 
  yeah , they could have put a little arrow in there to indicate the direction . 
  no , they are not . 
  t has a frequency of 9.056 % , i of only 6.966 % . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/letter_frequency#relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_the_english_language ) . 
  the text you posted and clearly misunderstood says that in the current morse code the letters `` t '' and `` i '' require the same time to transmit . 
  that it takes the same time to transmit '' - '' as it takes to transmit '' . . '' . 
  but '' - '' is still easier to write , so it belongs to the more frequent letter : t. 
  of course . 
  how does that change anything ? 
  the rope is probably very long and they shorten it as necessary in the final stages of setting up . 
  do n't be a console peasant , pcs are way better . 
  by far the best way to acquire vocabulary is doing anki flashcards on your phone . 
  that 's great when walking , but i do n't think it 's really possible when running . 
  so you might have to slow down a bit . 
  now chinese peasants can realise their dreams and become console peasants as well . 
  peasants ^ 2, 
  czech people divide into ** 3 main `` nationalities '' ** : ** bohemian ** / czech ( the word for these is the same in the czech language ) , ** moravian ** and ** silesian ** . 
  but it 's only for historic reasons because of historical divisions of the lands of the bohemian crown . 
  all these 3 `` nationalities '' should be counted as czech . 
  but that would be a shitty union/country with lots of squabbling in my opinion , and i 'm not having any part of it . 
  do you mean that if say i was a native english speaker and i was learning french , i should have the french word as the front of the card , and the english as the back ? 
  because for me , i can tell you this would 100 % not work . 
  i have to work really hard to commit the french word into memory , so it has to be on the back of the card . 
  well , in japan it is n't as surprising , really . 
  i think mandarin is best for the notes that ca n't be decoded . 
  nobody knows basque , but you can google that shit . 
  with mandarin , they wo n't even know how to input the symbols into the computer !, 
  it 's just a recurring joke calling console people peasants . 
  but if you 're really asking : i like fps games , which are * utter shit * without a mouse and thus on consoles . 
  also more people owning consoles means less people on pc online gaming servers . 
  well , that 's a reason to fight consoles . 
  if they are n't lucrative , games will be made straight for pc . 
  what good are consoles anyway when young people like me do n't even have a tv to connect it to ?
