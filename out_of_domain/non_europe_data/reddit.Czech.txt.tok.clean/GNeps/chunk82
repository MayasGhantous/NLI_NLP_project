  consumer confidence is a fickle mistress . 
  you have to consider incentives . 
  they are a financial institution with large sums of money invested in various projects . 
  they are not a prediction institution , and they do n't get any revenue from that . 
  so knowing that announcing a recession might precipitate it , and knowing they have large financial stakes in the economy ( one way or the other , they have to put the money somewhere ) , i think it 's much more likely they 're trying to manipulate , than that they are being selfless . 
  definitely scary . 
  it 's not that . 
  we just do n't want to watch it . 
  i think it might have been dipped in ink . 
  it has been done in some countries to mark you as having voted in a particular elections so as to avoid double voting , since the ink wo n't come off for several days . 
  absolutely . 
  i have no idea what / u/c3534l was smoking when he read it . 
  can i ask why is there a tension between the residents ? 
  i assume it 's similar to [ dvda ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dvda ) . 
  uh , why the fuck would you do that ? 
  and if you were in the yellow field energy wise , there could be blackouts during the night when batteries run out . 
  that would be awesome , 
  that 's pretty cool !, 
  though , you might want to avoid starting posts with `` learning time '' , it 's really off-putting . 
  sometimes murder is justified . 
  also , your `` argument '' is on par with 9-year-olds . 
  we have a saying in the czech language , `` murder of a tyrant is not a crime . '', 
  referencing the justifiability of [ tyrannicide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyrannicide ) . 
  for example the czechoslovaks have successfully assassinated [ heinrich himmler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinrich_himmler#the_holocaust ) , `` one of the most powerful men in nazi germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the holocaust '' . 
  there are n't many people that would not consider it justified . 
  there 's also [ justifiable homicide ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justifiable_homicide ) and many other cases where murder might be justified . 
  why did n't it fly if it was already on the pad ? 
  i find using traffic + + one of the best stuff about the game !, 
  can i ask how does the central metro station look like ? 
  is it really one station that 6 lines stop at ? 
  or are there several stations close together and people transfer on foot ? 
  hungry !, 
  it 's really weird . 
  a ) i do n't think there are border checks on antarctica , and b ) eea countries cumulatively claim almost half of the continent , so why only the small stripe claimed by france ? 
  so not all eea members , therefore it should not be highlighted . 
  well , allowing eea citizens to enter there without a passport is n't a benefit * to * the overseas territory , but rather to the eea citizens . 
  it 's written sky you \u00fcberfaggot . 
  islam a fastest growing religion ? 
  [ relevant xkcd . 
  if you actually read all the 10 fucking lines of text the article consists of before commenting for fuck 's sake . 
   two parishes in the vatican will take in a family of refugees each in the coming days , he said . 
  in the local cemetery . 
  two . 
  yes . 
  totes . 
  what are `` organized tours '' ? 
  why would n't you need a passport for those ? 
  never heard of that logic . 
  and they are only very slightly off though !, 
  by an infinitesimally small amount e \u2192 0 to be precise . 
  how do you figure 21 tonnes to leo ? 
  afaik v1 .1 was 60 % performance gain over v1 .0 and wiki lists them as 13,150 kg and 10,450 kg to leo respectively , a 26 % jump . 
  so why would a 33 % performance gain over v1 .1 cause 60 % gain in mass to leo ? 
  well , would n't the spacex released data ( which i 'm assuming are on wiki ) be better than generic nasa calculator ? 
  they are up to date exactly . 
   payload to leo, 
  can i ask how are the fh numbers incorrect ? 
  they are the same ones i keep seeing everywhere . 
  53 tonnes to leo . 
  so do we know why spacex claims it 's just 13.150 tonnes ? 
  so given that v1 .1 was 60 % gain and v1 .2 33 % gain , and the original was 53 tonnes , will the fh be able to almost rival saturn v with its 140 tonnes to leo ? 
  well we * are * discussing v1 .1 mass to leo actually . 
  ok , thanks . 
  that 's bloody amazing . 
  if you 're referring to the entire length of the empire , call them romans . 
  the word `` byzantine '' is only used to refer to the eastern roman empire after the fall of the western half . 
  or fucked by a dildo-wielding close friend . 
  it could go either way . 
  is that really a roundabout in the united states of murrica , or does my vision fail me ? 
  always a possibility !, 
  cool !, 
  but please , please , tell me you do n't call them `` traffic circles '' !, 
  it 's such a silly , child name . 
  home battery . 
  wow , i did n't know you had the eu-form license plates as well , they look cool !, 
  why not ? 
  tesla is selling home batteries for a reasonable price now already . 
  pretty soon it can be viable option for small nations . 
  yeah , given the saving you 'll make over the lifetime of the devices using solar energy , either you can already break even , or you 'll be able to very soon . 
  i 'm not saying the usa can start relying on home batteries * right now * , but for example luxembourgh could switch this year . 
  and given the speed of adoption of electric cars , the prices will keep falling and falling . 
  can you provide source on that quote from musk ? 
  also i said `` lifetime of the devices '' , not that they last a lifetime . 
  yeah , i remember that . 
  i believe what he meant was that it made little sense for utility customers , as in , customers that are utility companies . 
  which it does n't , a utility company that has their own power plants would have to buy a metric shitton of those to make a dent , they 'd be much better off assembling them themselves . 
  sadly i ca n't find a single thing mentioning batteries in that pdf . 
  also , how much upfront costs does a hydroelectric dam cost , and how many can we built ? 
  also , what are the maintenance costs of a tesla battery pack ? 
  and i believe there 's no trouble with cooling , the little that is needed is provided in the box . 
  ftfy, 
  afaik the historian edward gibbon invented the word `` byzantine '' almost as an insult , to distinguish the mighty western roman empire from the decadent eastern one . 
  also , robert moses cities look cool as fuck !, 
  i love your view of history , you should write a blog . 
  nobody is disputing that . 
  the point is , it looks incredibly cool !, 
  if you had n't noticed , it 's a game . 
  also , i 'd like to think robert moses of the 21st century would use tunnels instead of elevated highways and bridges , which are much more conductive to a better city life . 
  hail tunnels !, 
  what city ?
