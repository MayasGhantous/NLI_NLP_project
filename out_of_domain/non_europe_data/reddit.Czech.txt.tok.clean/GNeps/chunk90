  nothing to worry about . 
  we 're not going to replace all cars tomorrow but over the next decades . 
  in that time there 'll be huge economic incentives to find and extract more cobalt anywhere it may be on earth , as well as incentives to find alternatives for cobalt . 
  when a capitalist system really wants to produce something , it 'll happen no matter the obstacles . 
  not really though . 
  they always depict objects flying and rotating around phil on the station , even when he is sleeping . 
  that 's not realistic at all , since the objects would stop moving pretty fast . 
  i bet that 's it . 
  and the new medical equipment will help them solve it . 
  you 're very me_irl . 
  with how much money the program was costing , enlarging the embarkation room a bit would really not be a problem . 
  and sure , once in a while a jeep would n't be very useful , but on the vast majority of planets it would work handily . 
  air resistance . 
  the station is filled with air , and everything that moves through air eventually stops . 
  plus each time it bounces off a wall it loses some kinetic energy as well . 
  the budgets of norad and sgc were also completely incomparable . 
  ease is relative to budget . 
  well then , you obviously have n't yet tried * the knick * and * mr. 
  i 'm very sure he was just joking due to carrie fisher 's recent popularity upswing . 
  ** peep show ** , a british comedy , is currently nearing the end of series 9 , and it 's absolutely awesome as ever !, 
  which one ? 
  i definitively would have binged it by now as well , because who has self-control nowadays , but i like the weekly format better . 
  i enjoy it more , i remember more , i have time to properly think about and discuss what has happened in a given episode . 
  it 's a whole year experience instead of one forgettable week/end . 
  episodic writing has been the standard for the past century , and it 's been completely exhausted . 
  only a tiny few new episodic shows will be hits , because it 's all been done before . 
  season/series arcs on the other hand are basically a whole new visual medium that 's almost completely unexplored and opens up a vast new space for storytelling that could not have been done before . 
  we live in a golden days of television , because a brand new medium has just been created . 
  thanks . 
  and yes , the episode aired in 2007 whereas twd premiered in 2010 . 
  you had me confused there for a bit . 
  daryl is 100 % kenny , there 's no debate about that !, 
  carrol = cartman 's mom !, 
  otherwise great pics !, 
  [ hello darkness , my old friend ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyrwtvsckmi ), 
  because nothing ever goes right . 
  i might have chosen the wrong sub , i 'm not really a beginner , i 'm familiar with magical functions . 
  i just for the life of me ca n't grasp how this one behaves on a function . 
  so functions are objects of a class named ` function ' , and that class implements the non-data descriptor protocol ? 
  thanks !, 
  thanks , that 's very illuminating !, 
  so the ` __ get __ ` method is only ever natively invoked when i 'm calling a method as ` object.method _ name ` ? 
  or is it used in some other cases as well ? 
  so , if i get it correctly , ` __ call __ ` is only invoked on methods , but gets ignored on functions ? 
  so , the definition of a callable ( since functions are callables ) is that it 's an instance of a class that has the ` __ call __ ` method . 
  but it 's not guaranteed that the method get called ? 
  that 's pretty weird , is n't it ?

  ~ ~ wait , i think ` a = a ( ) ` * does * run ` a. __ call __ ` !, 
  are you sure it does n't ? ~ ~, 
  ` a = a ( ) ` indeed does not run ` a. __ call __ ` , only ` a ( ) ` does . 
  i thought it run both ` __ call __ ` and ` __ init __ ` in sequence . 
  so , now i 'm trying if i can put a new ` __ call __ ` method into ` a ` like so :, 
  a. __ call __ = other_method, 
  but the other_method never gets called . 
  would you know why ? 
  i thought instance attributes took precedence over class attributes . 
  thanks , that was a very exhaustive answer !, 
  ad 8am : still awake or already awake ? 
  with programmers i 'd guess the former . 
  ah , therein lies the secret !, 
  thanks !, 
  i just realized that there is a ` __ call __ ` that is being invoked before ` __ init __ ` , but it 's on the metaclass ( with which i was playing recently ) . 
  thanks for the demonstration of how the ` __ call __ ` behaves on the instances !, 
  i guess magic methods do n't get searched on instances at all , which is not very intuitive . 
  how the hell is that safe ?? 
  engineering does n't help you if the person inside suddenly steps on the gas for some reason . 
  i highly doubt that 's it . 
  during the first earth quake you 'd see hundreds of cars tumbling through the air on their way down . 
  it would have to be a massive tilt . 
  that 's expensive for every car spot in the building . 
  well , it 's aiming to be on par with windows 95 , so that 's not very surprising , is it ? 
  i read it somewhere , but it might be old info . 
  here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reactos#early_development:_freewin95_to_reactos, 
  so i think it 's basically windows 95 clone with maybe memo bolted on in the future . 
  asking the important questions !, 
  if you ask me , that 's the stuff they should be focusing on !, 
  well , i understand they 're going for xp program compatibility , but i think the os itself will still be more like windows 95 . 
  they really do n't have the manpower to do much with it . 
  it did n't , and i do n't think they are . 
  they literally started as a win 95 clone . 
  so perhaps only if they completely threw out the kernel development at some point . 
  do you have a source ? 
  well a spin-off is more like a fork , not necessarily a restart . 
  i think they just tacked things onto the kernel to make it work with nt applications . 
  it 's quite possible . 
  though they might have thrown out large chunks if there was an architectonic change . 
  after all , win95 kernel was quite early in modern os development . 
  that 's a great question , i 'm also looking for a gaming mouse -- ideally under $ 50 - $ 60 . 
  anyone have any tips ? 
  why will there be no barge landing attempt if they do n't get the rlts go-ahead ? 
  let 's hope so , otherwise they 're wasting a landing attempt !, 
  but why did they retire jrti ??? 
  would n't it be useful to have one barge for each ocean ? 
  why would n't spacex sign a longer contract ? 
  that 's not normal , maybe you should get yourself checked out . 
  people like that do n't quit their jobs and retire . 
  she might have the money to be set for life , but she 'll want more anyway .
