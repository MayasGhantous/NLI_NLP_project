  but to your second point -- you still assume everybody loves some form of physical exercise . 
  that is patently false . 
  there are numerous people that just do n't enjoy physical exercise at all . 
   condescending ? 
  no , calling a spade a spade , in this case . 
  negatively judging someone 's life based on a few short paragraphs of text is * incredibly * condescending . 
   that 's not a negative judgement . 
  it is what it is . 
  i believe you need to actually sit back , and figure out why you hate everything , and do n't want to own your own life choices . 
  up unto this line you managed to be just misinformed and misguided , but you just * had to * slip in the final condescension again . 
  goodbye . 
  has it occured to you that it 's dismissive and very discouraging if someone tells you how easy it is to lose weight with exercise and that it 's not draining at all and you should stop being a nancy ( his words ) ? 
  he is very lucky he genuinely loves running and i 'm happy for him , but he should n't belittle people that genuinely dislike exercise , but still force themselves every day into action to lose weight . 
  it does n't come easy to everyone . 
  as a vim user , how does vim help with carpal tunnel syndrome ? 
  really ? 
  i was just thinking about whether to use jk or capslock as esc , but i 've decided for jk , since it 's on the home row . 
  you do n't have to stretch your fingers at all , whereas capslock is still a bit of a reach for the pinkie . 
  why did you switch from jk to capslock ? 
   `` 0 is the yank register only and is n't affected by deletions , 1 through 9 are affected by everything that is large enough . 
  correction , ** `` 1 through `` 9 are not affected by yanking at all ** ( unless you yank specifically to that register ) . 
  when you yank a line , it goes into '' '' and `` 0 , but does n't change `` 1 through `` 9 , those are only affected by cuts ( d , c , s , . . ) . 
  it 's a really funky system and neovim should absolutely change it * , but so far here we are . 
  \\* i think neovim should introduce a `` novimcompatible '' mode setting akin to vim 's `` nocompatible '' with vi mode . 
  there , registers would be made sane , y would work as y $ instead of yy , and so on . 
  i 'm not making excuses , i 've lost the regained weight again . 
  i 'm simply stating that it 's ** not all roses like the poster seems to think ** , many if not most people have to consciously manage their weight for the rest of their lives like alcoholics have to avoid alcohol till death do them part . 
   i doubt you 've run marathons like that because even if you do n't enjoy it you feel so damn amazing afterwards . 
  i think you might have misread , i said i ran 5k , that 's some 37km short of a marathon . 
  and i did n't say i did n't feel good * afterwards * , i indeed did . 
  but it was never enough on its own to get me out on the run again the next time . 
  i 'd always chose the book if i did n't have to do it for weight loss . 
   i 've never really thought there were real people like you that think this way . 
  people that exercise always think everybody just has to find some exercise to feel passionate about , but it just is n't so . 
  i feel passionate about completely different things . 
  it does !, 
  though cleaning and organizing my flat is a rather humongous task right now , i 'll need to work up to that . 
  yes , because he can magically pick a politician to support that has the exact same views as him . 
  we all can !, 
  i love bernie , do n't get me wrong -- i would love to see him as president . 
  but buffett is intelligent enough to realize that if bernie gets elected on the democratic ticket , a republican will win the next election . 
  buffett is chosing the least evil , like everyone in every election . 
  i 'm sorry , i should have been more precise : `` endorse a politician with an actual chance of winning the national election '' . 
  bernie has absolutely no chance of that exactly * because * of how awesome he is . 
  no , even with all the endorsements in the world , remember , half the country voted for bush jr. !, 
  twice !, 
  nominating a hard socialist for the president of such nation is complete folly . 
  the us first needs to actually start funding schools again so that one day that may be possible . 
  yes , roughly half the country will . 
  it 's the swing voters that will decide the election . 
  in case one of us did n't know that . 
  no matter what endorsements you veil bernie in , he 's a hard socialist and it will be painfully obvious . 
  swing voters of the united states of the freaking freedom just wo n't vote for a hard socialist . 
  please let 's stop lying to ourselves , living in reality is a bit sadder , but more useful . 
  trump on the other hand ? 
  a very solid chance of winning . 
  beneton can try , but there 's a good chance they wo n't be able to stop him . 
  or maybe you 're just not being realistic as i am . 
  yes , realism can seem like cynicism if the reality is bleak enough , but that does n't make it so . 
  hard socialist in us terms , not in r/fullcommunism terms . 
  i love it !, 
  then who 's motorcycle is this ? 
  was he overly malicious do you think ? 
  he had malicious thoughts and i think we all do , but he fought them most of the time . 
  season 9 mark , well , mostly yeah . 
  but early seasons mark was really trying to be a decent human being . 
  that 's not malice though . 
  and consoling another guy is just un-english . 
  we all agree that marc is n't a 100 % honest person , but none of what you have pointed out is malice . 
  [ malice ] ( https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/malice ) , n : the desire to harm someone ; ill will . 
  his only desire was to help himself , not to hurt others . 
  except maybe jeff , and jeff had it coming . 
  maybe a clearer definition from merriam-webster will help :, 
  [ malice ] ( http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/malice ) : desire to cause pain , injury , or distress to another, 
  yes , he did all that , but he did all that for selfish purposes . 
  if he could have accomplished his goals without harm to others , he would have likely done so . 
  the way i read the definition , these actions are not malice . 
   he willingly caused pain , injury and distress to numerous people throughout the show . 
  yes , but that is not in question . 
  did he have a desire to do so ? 
  because nothing suggests that he did . 
  that 's the difference between selfishness and malice . 
  he might have some malicious thoughts throughout the 9 years , after all , everybody has those thoughts once in a while . 
  but he always fought them to my recollection . 
  you 're still confusing willingness and desire . 
  one is a means to an end , the other * is * the desired end . 
  mark had some malicious thoughts , but he did not act on them , otherwise the series would have been quite different . 
  he only acted out of self-interest . 
  yes you are going to memorize some , you probably already know ` fd00 : : ` for instance . 
  it 's even easier to remember than the ipv4 version . 
  the local network address has the ` fd00 : : ` prefix , so your local router ( and local dns provider ) will most likely sit on ` fd00 : :1 ` . 
  that 's even easier to remember than the current ` 192.168.0.1 ` . 
  so yeah , it wo n't even be an issue for 99.9 % of people . 
  iirc it 's a local network prefix , like ` 192.168.0.0 ` for ipv4 . 
  * fortheunion *, 
  you 're worried that no-one is worried ? 
  closets can be deep . 
  it 's a comedy , i enjoyed it immensely . 
  as a czech i have to say the author probably has some cognitive deficit . 
  we are the richest post soviet country , the economy is doing absolutely spectacularly great , salaries are rising fast .
