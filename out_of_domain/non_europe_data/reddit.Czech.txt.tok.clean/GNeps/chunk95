  would you know if the usage of english in business followed the same pattern as in diplomacy ? 
  it seems to me it 's usage in business and trade would become dominant a lot sooner due to the vastness of the empire . 
  after all , at one time it contained about 50 % of the gdp of the entire planet . 
  [ the newsroom global warming interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm0uz9mfoui ), 
  oh calm down , humanity was organized into societies for thousands of years before the internet was around . 
  we would lose gdp and would spend time to rebuild a lot of tech , but ... have you heard about books , man ? 
  for christ 's sake , man , of course we can rebuild factories . 
  right , our technology is passed on in an oral tradition like homer 's iliad and odyssey . 
  thanks , that 's a very interesting answer !, 
  i 'll go read those links !, 
  you have an extremely naive and simplistic view of the functioning of the world . 
  your view is so naive we would spend days just discussing the very basics and , by the looks of it , agree on nothing anyway . 
  sometimes one has to realise there 's no point . 
  you do n't need to , but you 're going to anyway . 
  respectively ? 
  could you tell me the name and/or location of that lodge ? 
  i * have * to visit it !, 
  the simpsons did 9/11 !, 
  that 's exactly why i support ubi . 
  we as a society are fast approaching the point where human labour is not necessary for our survival and well-being . 
  and at that point we have to restructure our society around something else , because compulsory work will be an obsolete concept . 
  i want you to put the opening brace on the line above the statement . 
  yes , do that !, 
  you think there 's space for that ? 
  i might be missing some joke , but the first image -- the 4th gen -- does n't look sporty at all . 
  to me it looks like some grandma 's car . 
  you 're absolutely right that it 's far sportier than the 3rd gen , but overall it does n't come even close to qualifying as sporty to me . 
  those two gens are so horrible they kind of soil the whole mustang brand for me , both on sportiness and class . 
  best forget these two models as fast as possible . 
  human stupidity multiplied by a dire lack of education . 
  / r/muskworldproblems, 
  they can make their own choice , all right , but that does n't mean their choice to die is n't stupid . 
   nature has its own way of working and there is nothing wrong in believing in that . 
  yes , it 's called evolutionary selective pressure , and that means these people will die and hopefully smarter people will live to reproduce . 
  i 'm all for that . 
  right . 
  everything in life is dangerous . 
  the odds for car crash are at least 3 or 4 orders of magnitude lower than you dying of malaria without a net . 
  please argue with reason , not feelings . 
  you have a serious case of sjw . 
  of course . 
  but any `` education '' they have gets passed down mostly by parents over there . 
  i was just thinking about that . 
  it 's mostly true , but i think there are few exceptions , like the [ tulip mania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tulip_mania ) . 
  i agree that most people did n't . 
  but i think smart observers pretty much knew it was going to crash . 
  well , if you have proof the bubble is based on something of inherently far lower value , you can actually cause the bubble to pop by going forward with this information . 
  i recommend watching ( or reading ) [ the big short ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_big_short_\\ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  the lecturer appears to be an idiot . 
  is he really comparing the time it took the us to develop the nuke with the time it took n. korea ? 
  is he really comparing the richest and extremely populous nation with the highest concentration of nobel laureates to an agrarian nation of 20 starving millions with basically no technological base ? 
  because he definitely is . 
  cool !, 
  in that case , if i were you , i 'd look out for chupa chups !, 
  not really , look at the graph he presented . 
  nations that have nuclear secrets are not willing to share them with n. korea . 
  and most importantly , it is mostly an engineering challenge , so you really ca n't compare those two countries at all . 
  i could n't disagree more . 
  the basic principle of the atomic bomb is pretty much widely known , yes . 
  but a ) the devil is in the details , and b ) the hardest thing is to actually manufacture it and get the fissile material . 
  that is relatively easy in such industrialised countries like the us , uk , even russia . 
  but in an agrarian country like n.k. 
  with so few people and absolutely no industry ? 
  extremely hard bordering on impossible . 
  wait , so showing the video of porn is legally fine , but the audio is not ? 
   manufacturing [ the atomic bomb ] is not hard, 
  i think we ca n't really continue this discussion any further . 
  i 'm from the czech republic and got one pretty cheap from the amazon uk . 
  though i had to buy a charger adapter . 
  well , i think you maybe can apply the warranty at your local asus store in italy . 
  if not , just send it to the uk for a few bucks like a man . 
  the uk has to first activate article 50 ( wo n't happen this year ) and then wait 2 years to exit the eu . 
  uk 's eu membership will outlast your warranty . 
  and yes , like a man . 
  the flip is not that much money , and not buying something because you worry you might have to spend a few bucks to send it back is being a chicken . 
  ah , turning to insults when you run out of arguments . 
  oh , and if you think the price of shipping in the unlikely case of a warranty issue -- roughly 8 bucks , the price of a cheap meal -- is `` wasting money '' , you really should n't be buying electronics . 
  calling someone a chicken vs. a `` huge prick '' and `` colossal idiot '' is not comparable . 
  if anyone in this conversation lacks good manners it 's the one calling people `` pricks '' and `` colossal idiots '' . 
  piss off . 
  they actually replaced the spandex uniforms from season 1 with something looser for season 2 and onwards because there were health concerns !, 
  of course , people that are being called chicken always agree that they indeed are being chicken . 
  that 's why they need to be told that , because they already know it !, 
  `` do n't be a chicken '' is not an insult , it 's an encouragement like `` there 's really no danger , why are you hesitating ? '' . 
  `` you 're a huge prick '' on the other hand ... 
  but i guess we ca n't expect etiquette from everybody . 
   ** just stop harassing me ** . 
  i was here looking for help , not being insulted by a ** failure of a man ** . 
  you added a third insult while i have n't uttered a single one . 
  well , you sure look like a world success . 
  i think you 're just getting progressively more and more pissed off that you keep stooping to lower and lower levels while i have kept my cool and dignity . 
  well , this is n't the way to dig yourself up , man . 
  try a new approach !, 
  we should put up the iron curtain again , except this time europeans would be sneaking over it the other way ... 
  depends on where . 
  in belgium , france and germany ? 
  significantly more . 
  that 's because it suited the government . 
  this goes against the firmest position that angela merkel ever held . 
  she was a leader of compromise , but here she took a firm stand .
