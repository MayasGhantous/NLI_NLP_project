human trash like you do n't deserve a dog . 
  tell that to the children burned by your napalm in the vietnam war :p, 
  some mentally ill people ( e.g. 
  members of the body modification community ) would pay for that !, 
  but but but multiple configurations !, 
  sorry , but dice ca n't debug all systems , too many configurations !, 
  that 's the power of frostbite 3 . 
  it may have a few tiny issues with basic concurrency control etc. , but i say who needs synchronization when it looks awesome !, 
  knifes bruv, 
  symthic.com `` xyz has 50 % lower ads base spread ( not moving ) '', 
  in battlefield 4 , squad play is encouraged for the perks . 
  - except that it 's better to not stick together , because it 's less likely you 'll get team wiped and so you 'll keep the perks . 
  post link, 
  bullet sponge enemies = almost exclusively a terrible idea . 
  this , even planetside 2 feels better for christ sake, 
  yep , my guess is that whoever is in charge of those server farms is not working during the holidays and therefore there 's no one to reset them ? 
  you 're just mad that you 're getting your sniper ass getting handed to you by a support . 
  pkp : max 34dmg @ 10m , min 25dmg @ 75m , so given a 2.0 x headshot multiplier , you 'd need two headshots at full health or four shots into the torso ( five with defensive spec ) . 
  ace 23 is not the best in any single stat in the game . 
  it 's the most used weapon because it 's the most versatile one . 
   i 've been killed from 200m by a single lmg bullet off the pkp, 
  this is what i replied to . 
  it does n't make any sense for the reasons i demonstrated by quoting symthic numbers . 
  and if you 're just saying that some support managed to finish you from a great distance , then i 'll say that this is correct and nobody should be `` fixing '' that . 
  sniping is not just about accuracy , but also about positioning and knowing where the enemy fire can come from ( pld and t-ugs help you with this ) ... if some support guy has enough time to deploy a bipod and take you down , your position was n't that great to begin with . 
  not to mention that using a bipod is not possible at certain engagement angles . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : support class with a pkp or m240b * should * be able to suppress a sniper at medium distances . 
  yes , since it 's the same engine and the ps4 's architecture is very similar to a pc i 'd say only the rendering path will be significantly different , so i 'd imagine the benefits of a ssd ( or hybrid drive ) will be pretty much the same . 
  have the 250gb one myself ( http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=n82e16820147248 ) ... 
  i 'm almost always first to load and if you manage to get to a heli then it 's half the job done !, 
  this happens to me all the time !, 
  now you 're just making too much sense !, 
  stop it , this is reddit after all !, 
  lol, 
  btw the huge problem with all these bannings , nerf requests etc. 
  is that too many people want to `` ban '' everything that does n't suit their play style or simply disrupts it ( instead of modifying their own tactics ) . 
  it has gone so far that esl is now an ace 23 assault medic fest on tiny domination maps . 
  it 's more of a renderer thing than any other engine subsystem , but yes , i 'm sure messing with the code in such a way ( basically replacing an api ) can introduce all sorts of visual bugs ( and crashes especially ) . 
  the problem is that ** nobody will be using an area of denial weapon unless he has a reasonable chance of killing somebody with it ** . 
  besides , both the igla and the stinger are useless against anything else than enemy air that is within certain distance ( moreover , usability of stingers against jets is debatable and iglas are completely worthless against them ) . 
  all this * correct way of playing battlefield * and * k/d does n't matter * is cute , but ultimately just that - a wishful thinking . 
  ** most players ** prefer to have higher k/d and spm than `` guarding the sky '' lol . 
  simple as that . 
  therefore , if you over-nerf some weapons ( especially if they have such a limited usability ) , nobody will use them and then you might as well not have them at all ( everyone and their mother is now running either rpg/smaw or sraw , nothing else ) . 
   vehicles are limited assets, 
  yes , that 's why there is one mobile aa per team . 
   this promotes teamwork, 
  mobile aa with active radar missiles is pretty much defenseless against tanks . 
  your team can deal with mobile aa quite easily . 
  if you have problems with active radar missiles , use a map where their effectiveness is lowered ( e.g. 
  now i do n't disagree that active radar missiles are op right now , but all they need to balance them is lower their reload speed considerably . 
  it 's crap , plus it 's loaded with bugs . 
  latest cod is a much better sp cod experience than bf4 ( awkwardly ) tries to be . 
  exactly , i 'm sorry but that 's borderline retarded . . 
  thanks , but no thanks . 
  judging by the few videos i saw from him , i do not consider his critiques to be high quality . 
  solid state dick, 
  i blame rps clickbite controversy makers . 
   he 's not saying he 's going to stop making jokes that will offend , but that he 'll stop lashing out when someone is offended . 
  fair enough . 
  mods , make some great bf4 maps !, 
  [ outside ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/outside ), 
  someone needs to be slapped on their wrist . 
  seriously . 
  dice la just copy-pasted the damn thing ( including all the bugs etc. ), 
  and just made a few alterations . 
   webstorm, 
  many intellij ides share the same base intellij platform . 
  there is only one dart plugin ( as far as i know ) . 
  nice !, 
  kind of ot : i 've always felt slightly repulsed by scala ( i did some work with play and messed around a bit in akka ) because of the `` be different '' drive the scala development team seems to have . 
  to me , it felt alien ( coming from c # / java ) even though there was no real need for it to be different . 
  this is one of the reasons why i like dart , it 's similar to java/c # in many ways ( so there is no need to reinvent the wheel and you can start very quickly ) and only builds on the basic similarities when it needs to . 
  i do n't want to be a dick , but this level of stupidity is asking for what happened . 
  after playing 140 hours of bf4 , i feel the same . 
  similar experiences . 
  i try to avoid paracel when playing rush and clusterfuck when playing obliteration . 
  they have what , 5 map packs ? 
  and they 're so stupid that they 're trying to jam all the modes into all maps even though they evidently lack the genius to make it happen ... ** jack of all trades , master of none . 
  ** sigh, 
  calling it now : the guy is going to get fired . 
  i hope you 're not expecting an answer lol, 
  he 's very vary of what he 's replying to and how he 's replying . 
  besides , publicly talking about a coworker or your boss is not really a good way to keep your job . 
  yep , that 's why i added '' :p '', 
   tribler , which is developed at delft university of technology with eu taxpayer money , is filtered as well . 
  i lol 'd . 
  perfect !, 
  the video is now almost two years old , but it still applies :d, 
  the netcode ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzyqefwtrtk ) also helps you with mini kills . 
  imagine you turn a corner the last split second before explosion and should be fine because there is a fucking wall . . but still get killed . 
  this happened to me dozens of times . 
  in general , when running from a grenade , it seems like the grenade has a huge blast radius ... but most of that feeling imo comes from the `` netcode '' . 
  dropping the series does n't solve anything . 
  who 's to say that battlefront 3 or bad company 3 wo n't be as fucked up as bf4 was ( is ) ? 
  especially with the same engine and the same mindset ( ea+dice ) . 
  the next big battlefield needs new blood ( new studio ) , proper development time and no fixed release dates ( that would probably happen only if ea was n't ea ) . 
  haha , that 's a little dicey :p, 
  btw am i the only one who finds it ironic that ms paid a lot of money for a timed exclusive ( second assault ) and then the thing is n't even working properly and they have to issue refunds ?
