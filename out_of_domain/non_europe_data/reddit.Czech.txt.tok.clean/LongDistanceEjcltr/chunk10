  search engines do not host information and trying to get them to censor legal content from their results is the wrong approach . 
  information should be tackled at source , which in this case is a spanish newspaper , otherwise we start getting into very dangerous territory . 
   `` the regulators should be doing more to ensure that people have an informed choice over what data is collected about them by companies like google , but if we start to make intermediaries responsible for the actions of the content of other people , you 're establishing a model that leads to greater surveillance and a risk of censorship . '', 
   data protection lawyers said the ruling could give the go-ahead to deletion requests of material including photographs of embarrassing teenage episodes and even insults on social media websites and could lead to a rethink in the way they handle links to content on the web . 
  you bunch of whiny children talking about ramming/glitching need to realize that the whole gunship bullcrap is the real `` glitch '' here . 
  almost intant respawn + altitude glitch means that even using the gunship is as much `` cheating '' as is doing what he does in the video . 
  oh and btw abusing the game 's mechanics is perfectly fine ( even though you may not like it ) . 
  if the developer is that lazy or incompetent to leave them in the game , then that 's their problem . 
  as long as you 're not actively overcoming some protection or manipulate game 's state outside of the game ( using third party programs etc. 
  ) , everything is fine with me . 
  blame ea dice , not the players . 
  yeah , also the same guy that thought it made sense to not put jets in carrier assault, 
  i played crysis , a game clearly from the future , in 2007 . 
  now explain that !, 
  * `` that 3x m320 thing '' is literally that . 
  `` that thing '' . 
  have you ever been killed by it outside of a few days around ns launch ? 
  i did n't . 
  i 've unlocked it though and it sucks some major balls . 
  * minis have been brutally nerfed . 
  they 're a non-issue now . 
  * ucav ( without airburst upgrade ! ), 
  is a non-issue . 
  you have just one shot every 90 seconds ( i think ) . 
  it auto-reloads , so it 's an excellent anti-sniper tool where you can fire it once when you need to and then continue to ptfo ( i.e. 
  camping wo n't help you in any way ) . 
  this is much more bearable than constant m224 spam . 
  2 rgos are too much though , i agree on that one . 
  suav can be abused because it sometimes does not explode and can continue its roadkilling spree ( i.e. 
  it would be okay too if it were n't for glitches ) . 
  it did reload from ammo boxes initially , but they changed that ( and it 's for the better ) . 
  they 'd have to identify him first . . speaking of which , brb , got ta upload some cte bugs , ea can suck a fat one :p, 
  the whole thing was a fucking retarded waste of money . 
  they rebuilt the set , bought new , ** incredibly expensive ** furniture and now they cancel it . 
   we had to deal with some hate on the forums , but we also sold 1,000 more subscriptions after that segment , 
  ea practices in cig disguise . 
  this attitude makes me sick . 
  i 'm seriously starting to regret my $ 250 early backing . 
  what i find hilarious is people defending the ability ** to buy in-game currency with real money ** . 
  if ea did this , people would cry for boycotts , cancelling pre-orders and god knows what ... but since it 's a game made by * legendary * chris roberts ( !!, 
  ! 111oneone ) , it 's all okay . 
  that 's not solving anything . 
  now the other team gets raped . 
  mr. dickbutt disapproves of this post . 
  i 'm considering using a muhammad emblem ( the one with the bomb instead of turban ) just to troll the fuck out of these people . 
  now kiss . 
  i 'm pretty sure you ca n't `` own '' ideas per se . 
  you 'd have to patent them first , then you 'd have case , no ? 
  you can always reinvent the wheel . 
   what did she see in him ? 
  money and/or power ? 
  beautiful . 
  well , there you go . 
  i 'll just leave this here, 
   and people say that sraw is as easy to use as stinger, 
  who the hell says that ? 
   i have a 6970 and a 430w psu i can donate to you . 
  what . 
  are you ... the prophet ? 
  the prophet of gaben ? 
  but if you kill someone ( or few people ) inside a building ( i.e. 
  you kill last witness , you are using a silenced pistol and no one outside the building has direct line of sight ) , people outside will begin to call the police , which was kinda disappointing . 
  there seems to be some threshold where you 'll just get police on your ass no matter what because the game decides that it will punish you for killing the innocent . 
  that 's more like horizontal bungee jumping :d, 
   edit7 : possible in-game store where you can buy weapons and accessories ( hopefully ala counterstrike ) . 
  i 'm scared . 
  could this be the first battlefield to feature full-on microstransactions ? 
  well ... knowing ea , they 'll try . 
   visceralskull, 
  visceral games ? 
  battlefield : hardline ? 
   battlefield hardline ~ ~ r ~ ~ . 
  ftfy . 
  it 's common knowledge that the core dice bf team is working on battlefront 3 , scheduled to be released next year . 
  bugfield : hardglitch, 
  still months off ? 
  will there be ( early ) beta ? 
  it 's too big for imgur . 
  so , i guess this is the official subreddit by the r/battlefield _ 4 mods ? 
  nice , double nice, 
  it 's a placeholder . 
  this is a full $ 60 ( and microtransactions ) game with premium . 
  this game will compete with advanced warfare . 
  it is a full game . 
  it 's ea 's big shooter for this year 's holiday season . 
  well , that escalated quickly . . 
  another one : http://vimeo.com/96688347, 
  download : https://mega.co.nz/#!pi8csraj!ovhvvdykzksaw-ak39qcbsyspqcqq-dm7d623ykzpqc, 
  it looks like battlefield-y to me . 
  i do n't need tanks 24/7 . 
  if it has better hit-detection and far less bugs than bf4 , i will buy it . 
  no preorder for me though , not this time , that 's for sure . 
  and only in battlefield ^ tm moments :p, 
  i do n't see a problem with getting excited about a new battlefield game as long as it does n't include some monetary commitement before the release ( paid beta , pre-order etc. ) . 
  i liked bf3 . 
  i like bf4 . 
  hell , i 've played it for over 400 hours according to battlelog . 
  was the state that bf4 released in acceptable ? 
  hell no . 
  do i like modern battlefield games ?
