  i love how the likes of this gal and #blm see racism everywhere in a country with a black president , in a country where the most popular entertainer and the highest paid actor is black ( the rock ) , in a country where the most successful comedian is black ( kevin hart ) ... yet the blacks only make about 13.2 % of the population . 
  where is all this support coming from ? 
  gee , it 's almost as if the vast majority of people are not racist ... 
   it seems strange to me that otters of all creatures should ever need a bath . 
  yeah they 're supposed to have constant access to water and they do smell . 
  the fact that they 're `` washing '' them like this does n't speak well about the conditions they 're kept in . 
  note : i 'm not a an otterologist , i 'm just regurgitating what people posted last time there were otters ( and me ) here . 
  that 's what they 're doing , they continue to pet it and troll it without actually taking the food away . 
  a couple more times and there will be no aggression .

   mess about with normal train tracks and derail trains, 
  derailing a train is [ trivial ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/us_derail_detail.jpg ) , but it 's not guaranteed to kill or even injure too many people . 
  fixing the affected part of the track would be easy and fairly cheap . 
  for terrorists , it 's just not worth it to target trains . 
  as explained in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnfesa01llk ) , someone shooting the tube with an anti-materiel rifle could basically bring the whole thing down ( and kill most people in it ) .

  any post containing gore or porn even if animated even if primarily in a `` wtf '' context is shot down . 
  the whole subreddit turned into a snorefest of boring posts and the vast majority of nsfw posts are about car crashes or hoarders . 
  awesome . 
  ^ not, 
   she realized how unfunny it was, 
  if only she realized that also about her whole act , which is basically just this kind of humor ... and stolen jokes . 
  wow , i have n't read a post this ... garbage ... in a long time . 
   there are other subs for gore . 
  amazing . 
  tell me more . 
  oh what about the one talking about r/gore or r/spacedicks ( both of which are basically empty , devoid of activity and with no community of active users ... not to mention that r/gore has literally nothing in common with what wtf was supposed to be about ) ... like r/wtf rules do . 
  if there 's a post with a wtf situation containing gore , the point of of the post is not gore , it 's the wtf situation . 
  have you ever seen a gory war movie ? 
  saving private ryan ? 
  is that a movie about gore just because it contains gore ? 
  12 year old level of thinking . 
   other subs for specifically gore ( like this very sub ) were created, 
  saying that r/wince was created specifically for gore is not only false , it 's borderline idiotic . 
  i 've been here for at least a year and it 's always been for content that will make you `` wince '' , hence the name . 
  it does n't have to be gory at all - as can be seen by just browsing the sub or looking at the top list . 
   also , this gif has been posted on / r/wtf a bunch already . 
  hell , it was posted last month . 
  it got deleted because it 's a repost . 
  who the fuck cares why it got deleted the last time . 
  it would get deleted if it was new . 
  [ this post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/wince/comments/4wnbs8/guy_pulls_something_from_his_eye_warning_very/ ) , one of the most upvoted r/wtf posts in a long time ( and judging by that [ original thread ] ( https://reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/4wnbmx/guy_pulls_something_from_his_eye/ ) also one of the most `` what the fuck '' comment producing videos of all time ) , was initially posted to r/wtf until some nutcase mod removed it `` cuz gore '' so keep your `` deleted because it was a repost '' fairy tales for yourself . 
  what ? 
  totally agree on the kurfurst , had absolute beast games over 200k , ended one of them with 248k dmg , half hp left and 4 kills ... the damn thing is so op it 's not even funny . 
  12 420mm guns , beast armor , huge health pool , the only real weakness being a competent t10 cv player ( i say t10 since even its aa is decent and t9 cvs may have some issues ) ... but that was already the case , now in the new patch with the yamato nerf , this thing is not just really good , it 's pure insanity . 
  got detonated yesterday in my montana ( air dropped torp ) for like the first time ever ( in 100 games ) ... something 's fucky . 
  not gon na happen , nice to see cvs getting it though ... it 's gon na be a bb bloodbath hehe, 
  if a competent cv player wants to , he will sink you or significantly damage you and you ca n't do anything about it , you 're just not a cruiser . 
  well , maybe a t8 cv could have issues with maxed out aa north carolina , but an attack group of t10 planes will wreck you even if you 're in a maxed out aa montana . 
  i do n't know , man ... 
  i 'd say that most t10 cv players are quite good , at least from my experience . 
  competent does n't mean excellent , just knowing what you 're doing and not sucking . 
  i 'm actually curious what people thought , since i do n't go to wg forums . 
  personally , i did n't get to play nearly as much pt battles as i 'd wanted , but from the few matches i played it felt like not that much has changed with yamato and kurfurst , while montana got even more squishy . 
   star citizen has now been in development for five years, 
  yeah , no . 
  the initial kickstarter campaign ended at the very end of 2012 . 
  there was nothing done yet at that point , except for the ks promo material ( put together by chris and a couple of guys from crytek ) . 
  you ca n't really speak of any kind of actual development until mid january 2013 . 
  ** the game is in development for 3.5 to 4 years , not 5 . 
  ** claiming otherwise is simply a lie . 
  you see , a simple , factual , easily verifiable fact like this is why the validity of the information in the rest of the article is now in question . 
  not that i expect better from kotaku . 
  ( btw you can downvote this post all you want , but everything i 've said is verifiable online . ), 
  well researched ? 
  [ explain this to me , please . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/544db7/inside_the_troubled_development_of_star_citizen/d7yuaue ), 
   there was nothing done yet at that point , except for the ks promo material ( put together by chris and a couple of guys from crytek ) . 
  is literally what i wrote . 
  people reiterated that to me , amazing . 
  claiming that the game is in development for 5 years is insidious , people did n't know sc even was a thing 5 years ago . 
  are we now going to count all the preliminary work and prototype testing done on games ? 
  you realize that this happens in every studio way ahead of the actual development ( when it picks up in decent numbers ) ... it 's stupid and mostly playing with words . 
  next we 're gon na cry about cyberpunk 's 10 year development ? 
  yep , people are posting links about chris doing the ks pitch :d ( which i even mention in my post ), 
  since there 's no need to repeat what i said elsewhere already , [ i 'll just link the comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/544db7/inside_the_troubled_development_of_star_citizen/d7yvhuy ) . 
   not a stretch at all, 
  the fact that you want something to be true does n't make it true . 
  according to hillary supporters ? 
  yes . 
  hence the `` basket of deplorables '' statement , labelling a quarter of america racist/homophobic/sexist / transphobic/islamophobic ( [ her words ] ( https://youtu.be/sjvxhbityea?t=113 ) ) .

  the funny part is that the vast majority of hiv positive people in the developed world got it from uprotected anal sex ( thanks to simple physics , i.e. 
  greater friction & tearing ) - and it 's mostly a larger issue just within the gay men community . 
  but no one talks about that . 
  probably because facts are offensive :p . ( btw hiv is far from fatal today , it 's mostly `` just '' a [ chronic disease ] ( https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/17/charlie-sheen-hiv-aids/ ) . ), 
   `` at the end of 2006 , more than half ( 53 % ) of all people living with hiv in the united states were msm ( men who have sex with men ) or msm-idu ( msm with a history of injection drug use ) . '',
