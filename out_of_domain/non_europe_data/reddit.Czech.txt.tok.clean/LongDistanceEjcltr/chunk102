  the ghouta attack happened on 21 august 2013 , the earliest reports of russian presence in syria come from september 2015 . 
  if you 're talking about chemical weapon use in general , the whole country is a victim of that from [ multiple sides ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/use_of_chemical_weapons_in_the_syrian_civil_war ) ... which could hardly be described by `` assad used chemical weapons '' . 
  yes , almost certainly ... 
   russian lawmakers are consulting with their counterparts in belarus , were a similar system has already been implemented , ria novosti reported . 
  ... what about reading the article next time ? 
  gneisenau is super fun ( brawling with torps ) . 
  bismarck is also a lot of fun ( with secondary spec and manual secondary fire captain ) ... 
  i 'd probably stick to km . 
  nc is a very good ship but if you intend to go all the way , montana is crap . 
  km has a nice progression and you end up with a beast second only to yamato ( and second to no one when brawling ) . 
   they 're going to take on youtube , which is probably for the best . 
  while it 's great that there will be competition ( at least as gaming related videos go ) , i 'm not so sure about the ultimate benefits this can possibly bring . 
  i mean , twitch policy as far as offensive content goes ( especially nudity ) is very harsh , they basically consider themselves a `` family friendly '' platform , which disqualifies a ton of content ( including `` overly '' gory or edgy games like manhunt or hatred ) . 
   woodley is the worst champion ever, 
  not for long , not for long :p, 
   i would like to see if nk is really as bad as everyone says it is . 
  i see this being said by most of the nk tourists ... but it 's absolute nonsense . 
  how can you know when you ca n't go anywhere without supervision ? 
  they are showing you what they 're comfortable with you telling people back home . 
  it 's propaganda , nothing more . 
  by going there you 're not helping anyone but yourself ( which is fine , tourism is a great source of entertainment ) , we 've seen the planned tours a million times already , youtube is full of those ( many very popular , e.g. 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmcptza6skc ) . 
  what they do n't show you is regular lives of the average people and how they 're affected by the government . 
  meh , unless the u.s. goverment is willing to start seizing saudi private capital in the u.s. , the suing 9/11 victims either ai n't gon na get shit or the u.s. taxpayers are gon na pay for it . 
  as for the u.s. being sued by `` one armed , shrapnel laden civilians '' , that ai n't gon na happen beucause it would require the same as above ( e.g. 
  the government of iraq would have to pass a bill like the u.s. 
  etc. ) . 
  international law ( at this point at least ) does n't really allow for a nation to be sued . 
  enjoy it while it lasts , their six month circulation averages dropped from 1,254,552 as of the second half of 2013 ( [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_magazines_by_circulation#united_states ) ) to 673,473 as of the first half of 2016 ( [ source ] ( http://abcas3.auditedmedia.com/ecirc/magtitlesearch.asp ) ) . 
   believe me there is 10x the amount of blood on our hands . 
  not by a long shot . 
   `` i am concerned that this will do very little for the victims , '' said paul stephan , an international law professor at the university of virginia in charlottesville . 
  testifying before a congressional panel on july 14 , he opposed the measure , explaining , `` were it adopted as law , would likely harm the u.s. by increasing its exposure to litigation abroad . '', 
  he said then , and reiterated in an interview this week , that nations sued as sponsors of terrorism typically object to the suits as a violation of international law and refuse to participate . 
  victims ' families win judgments by default , but find it all but impossible to collect on them . 
  `` in a few cases , the u.s. has disbursed funds to help satisfy those judgments , but then the money comes from the u.s. taxpayer , '' stephan said in an e-mail . 
  `` i do n't have any reason to believe that a suit against the saudis will follow a different path . '', 
  anecdotal evidence ? 
  if previous cases are `` anecdotal evidence '' to you then be me guest ... btw regardless of previous cases i do n't get your line of thinking - if you sue and win you either get nothing or the u.s. government pays for it ... you ca n't magically take money from some imaginary house of saud victim terror fund that does n't exist and never will exist . 
  where is the money going to come from ? 
  woodley : hey , i gave you a chance to boo , now let me speak , you got ta respect me . 
  lady gaga : booooooo, 
  at this point in the season , t6 does n't matter if you 're an ok + player . 
  a lot ( majority ? ), 
  of good players are already beyond that point . 
  i only needed to play two t6 games thanks to the stars for the last season ( which i began like a week before it ended ) , i picked my warspite ( cuz `` gim me dem creditz '' ) ... first game top player , second game 4 kills . 
  yeah . 
  i think that i 've been quite lazy and showed my broadside quite a bit , but it did n't really matter . 
  rank 16 and up is just a low ( ish ) skill bracket at this point . 
  and this is why rockstar has no incentive to make more than one or two gta ( - like ) games over the next 10 years . 
  in the past , the new games and dlc/expansion packs would generate all the revenue , this has now shifted to selling virtual goods . 
  ** to make $ 700m from game sales , you 'd need to sell 20 million of full priced $ 60 game copies ** . 
  ( the publishers get from 50 to 60 percent of $ 60 . ), 
  now consider the huge costs of making and marketing a game like gta and you 'll quickly get from seemingly gigantic revenue to a lot lower net profit . 
  virtual goods ? 
  they cost almost nothing to make ( comparatively ) . 
  it would be against rockstar 's financial interests to release new gta games as quickly as they would be comfortable with . 
  which is truly a sad state of things . 
  it has nothing to do with shell arcs . 
  he got rammed because he was zoomed in and could n't aim low enough ( which you can do when zoomed out ) ... wows mechanics 101 . 
  this and damage saturation are probably the most essential game mechanics not known by a majority of people playing the game . 
  weird . 
   i 'm 99 % sure that 's actually a bug . 
  i 've had it as well , when shooting targets that are very close sometimes your shells just randomly fly right up into the sky . 
   you ca n't depress the guns to their maximum when in first person , but can when in third person, 
  it 's probably both , zoomed out you have no problems ... zoomed in & knife fight distances = shit gets weird . 
  [ like so ] ( https://youtu.be/jahftblstok?t=487 ) . 
  65 million copies is still `` just '' ~ $ 2.3 billion ( absolute best case scenario , ignoring discounts - which got all the way to $ 35 at times - and differences in pricing around the world ) , which is kinda the point i 'm making . 
  they made close to third of that in one year by selling virtual goods . 
  i 'm not saying they do n't need to release new games , they absolutely do ( if only to renew the gaming public interest in the brand ) . 
  but ... my point is that as long as the game makes this kind of cash ( which could last a few years ) , there 's no reason to release a new gta game or even a sp dlc . 
  spoiler alert : his bike got stolen :p, 
   he was just laughing from the situation and made a joke, 
  in that case i probably did n't catch the sarcasm . . \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   everyone knows that, 
  maybe everyone in this subreddit ... but even that i doubt tbh . 
  i see t8 + people in the game chat all the time getting surprised and writing shit like `` wut , you torped him , why is he not dead '' ? 
  ( after a guy in benson torped a saturated stern of a beached tirpitz and did no damage . ), 
  i 'm pretty sure less than a half ( honestly though ? 
  i think it 's a lot less than that ) of wows players know how damage saturation works . 
  as for the clamped gun depression in first person , i ( a person active on this sub and a person having 1000 + games at the time and a person with 58 % wr and 1330 all-time wtr , i.e. 
  between great and unicum ) learned about this just a few months ago - it 's just not something the game will tell you ( hence my `` weird . '', 
  comment ) and the fact that firing from the third person ( zoomed out ) is \\* generally \\* less accurate than firing from the first person ( zoomed in ) because your fov is much higher , you 'll discover this naturally only by accident . 
  from what i understand , male hormones in a female body cause permanent changes in a much more dramatic way than when a male just increases his levels . 
  she may have a new `` baseline '' thanks to the steroids even though she 's not using them anymore . 
  if you look up steroid effects on female body most of the side effects are long lasting or permanent . 
  yep , 3am ... idiotic , but then again the ufc primarily cares about u.s.-based ppv buys , so 10 pm est makes sense in that light . 
   all for fun and promote the game . 
  [ nice promotion of the game you got there . 
  ] ( https://www.twitch.tv/wargaming/v/93743309?t=2h29m30s ) `` i do n't like the style of gameplay , it 's slow , and boring , people wan na just pop in and have instant action , you know like tanks ! '', 
  and ranting about hiding behind islands . 
  wait . 
  what ?? 
  did that just happen ? 
  that dude is a disrespectful idiot who has no bussiness being there , plus the wg employee enabling him ? 
  * yeah guys this game sucks , but we 're gon na make it better , make people aggressive , fix carriers , ookayy . 
  * he gets roflstomped by a dude telling him to `` make aa less stupid , make smoke less stupid , come on guys '' ... wow , if this was my game , the employee in charge of the stream would be fired on the spot , he got shit on , his game got shit on and he did nothing . 
  it 's one thing to make an attempt to try to improve the game by giving constructive criticism ( even though if a charity stream `` for fun '' is a place to do it is debatable ) , but this stupid rant ( from multiple people ! ), 
  was shocking to see ( and no , it was not in jest , except for that one dude saying `` it 's cancer , this is cancer ! '', 
  in response ) .
