  i have never ever seen such disrespect being tolerated . 
  if you took ( for example ) `` famous '' youtubers to an official battlefield stream and they behaved like this , ea would stop it on the spot and would make sure they 're never associated with that person again . 
  anyone recognizes their voices ? 
  i think the `` stupid '' guy is / u/ichasegaming , not sure though . 
   wonder why they did n't have this ready for day one, 
  probably because they have a [ laundry list ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzokdmzvdga ) of known issues they just did n't get to in time . 
   oh , so people are not allowed to state their opinion on the game now ? 
  nice straw man ( classic `` so you 're telling me ... '' followed by an intentional misrepresentation ) , but i 've specifically addressed this `` argument '' by stating the following :, 
   it 's one thing to make an attempt to try to improve the game by giving constructive criticism ( even though if a charity stream `` for fun '' is a place to do it is debatable ) , but this stupid rant, 
  but let 's move on :, 
   you obviously have no idea how much effort he put into, 
  no idea and i do n't really care , 2 . ), 
  what does it have to do with anything stated in my post ? 
   it is obvious to anyone who went through just 2-3 videos on his channel or watched 1-2 of his streams, 
  see above . 
  i do n't follow any wows youtubers ( except jingles and atsf ) , nor should i. 
  the fact that i do n't does n't make my points any less valid . 
  if ichase ( provided it was him ) wants to behave like a disrespectful spoiled child , then i 'll treat him like a disrespectful spoiled child ... regardless of his following . 
   it is in no ways `` stupid '', 
  he claims `` make aa less stupid , make smoke less stupid , come on guys '' , hence i refer to him as the `` stupid '' guy ( in quotes ) at the end of my post . 
  you can argue all you want and make up stories about his intentions , but the simple fact is that the words i quoted are nothing but a stupid rant . 
  useless , disrespectful comments that would probably get you banned in any other publisher 's program . 
   unless your definition of stupid is `` saying what is on your honest opinion about a thing you care a lot about '', 
  another straw man . 
  where did i say that `` saying what is on your honest opinion about a thing you care a lot about '' is stupid ? 
  i did n't call `` make aa less stupid , make smoke less stupid , come on guys '' a stupid rant because it 's a honest opinion , i called it a stupid rant because it 's a stupid rant with zero constructive value . 
   he have repeatedly stated his opinion on those two mechanics and have made those clear to wg devs who he had contact with . 
  and this is somehow making it justifiable to cry when the developer does n't listen to you or simply did n't get to your feedback yet ? 
  * hey you guys i told you about this a year ago , this is stupid and this is also stupid , come on !, 
   wg would do a lot of harm and no good if they copyright striked ichase out of the game like gaijin did to wt contributors . 
  which is exactly what you are suggesting, 
  that 's not even a straw man anymore , that 's just making up random bullshit and putting it in my mouth . 
  what i 'm suggesting is that wargaming does n't do bussiness ( streams , promotions , support ) with people who behave like this ( as other publisher would do and as i would do ) . 
  i do n't get where you even came up with copyright strikes , lay off the drugs ... 
  then , after all that happens , a new trump-like figure will appear , but nothing will change and the cycle will repeat ( only with hillary replaced by another career ~ ~ criminal ~ ~ politician with `` experience '' ) because way too many people are way too simple to influence and we ca n't elect a meanie , can we . 
  720p60 fixes the stream, 
  eeeeeh , the us team was [ super salty ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofwarships/comments/56i01r/eu_vs_na_starting_right_about_now/d8jqmu0 ) . 
  it was painful to listen to at times . 
  edit : someone posted this in your comments :, 
   i watched this battle yesterday from the na side . 
  completely different atmosphere on the eu side , as compared to what na was doing - eu team seems to be relaxed and having fun and trying to win - na side they were complaining about eu hiding behind islands , queman complaining `` this is n't fun , it 's boring '' and ichase telling him `` we 've been trying to tell you that for the past year '' and queman shutting him up telling him `` this is n't a whine session '' - and today on the na forums they 're carping about eu being a bunch of `` try hards '' , saying `` it was supposed to just be for fun , it was n't supposed to be competitive '' , and complaining about what some of the eu crowd had to say in chat . 
  notser was even complaining in his stream today that eu took the whole thing way too seriously as far as competition and playing to win . 
   for the past year on the na forums , it 's been a neverending stream of whine threads about potato players , players never using teamwork , people not taking the game seriously enough and playing `` just for fun '' , not trying to win or play the objectives , yaddda , yadda , yadda - and now that they 've seen a team that knows how to use teamwork , knows how to play competitively and play to win and still have fun - now they 're crying `` but it 's just supposed to be for fun '' . 
  iow , yeah , there seems to be a lot of butthurt going around the na side of the house today . 
  totally agree . 
  cue in rogan 's commentary about women juicing through swallowing too many loads, 
   root of the issue in places like the united states, 
  a couple of things . 
  education is a sure way to improve this , but it 's hard to implement quickly enough . 
  scientific research into nutrition over the last decade or so basically destroyed the classic food pyramid taught in schools ( and which has been `` common sense '' for decades ) . 
  we now know that not fat , but sugar is the primary culprit of obesity ( excluding other factors like activity level and genetics ) and diseases related to obesity ( e.g. 
  heart disease , diabetes ) . 
  we also know that eating a lot of carbs has a similar effect to eating a lot of sugar ( both simple and complex carbs turn into glucose ) . 
  these claims used to be thought of as fringe science , but were validated over time and now are actually a part of the mainstream consesus ( and , to a degree , even official recommendations like health.gov 's dietary guidelines ) . 
  it will take time until all this trickles down and becomes the new common sense . 
  why did n't we know about this sooner ? 
  special interest groups ( lobbying on behalf of corporations or unions ) , i.e. 
  money in politics . 
  the war on fat is/was a real thing . 
  ( it 's not as bad now , but i 'm sure many people over 20 will remember the low-fat or zero-fat craze resulting in products loaded to the gills with sugar which was used to boost their bland flavor . ), 
  and no , [ that 's not a conspiracy theory ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/12/sugar-industry-paid-research-heart-disease-jama-report ) . 
  [ his reaction ] ( https://twitter.com/coachedmund/status/786256118406320129 ) :, 
   when i coach i enter into a trance . 
  i smell colors , i see sounds . 
  to read my words is beautiful . 
  it illuminates my brilliance . 
   fuck the hate . 
  are you telling me i should like edmund now ? 
   parody account . 
  goddamit , why did you have to tell them ? 
  how will get a fix for my karma addiction now ? 
  toxicity +1 !, 
  seriously though , toxicity is a made up word pushed by pussies and fatties who ca n't handle the [ harmlessness ] ( https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/285670822264307712 ) of online trolling . 
  fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck that . 
  what the fuck even toxicity means . 
  ( i could n't care less actually , but it would be nice to know what it means * in the eyes of the mods * ... `` abusive in nature '' is a nebulous term subject to an individual mod 's interpretation ) . 
  ps : anime sucks . 
  rule 6 in 3 , 2 , 1 ... 
  i mean ... 
  i do n't really care ( and i did n't report this post as mods could confirm i 'm sure ) , but afaik the last eu vs us stream was a charity stream too and people could n't post links to that cause . 
  i mean how stupid would you now look if you bought an atlanta instead of this thing ? 
  wg balancing sometimes works in mysterious ways . 
  btw it 's one thing when a tiny subset of the community gets an access to flint , entirely different thing when a lot of people can just buy it . 
  imagine if belfast becomes anywhere near as popular as tirpitz ( say 1/2 or even 1/3 ) ... there will be a lot of crying going on . 
  cowboy gained a lot of respect in my eyes in that episode ... honesty , no bullshitting , no sugar-coating and generally not giving a fuck . 
  the fact that he put joe in his place ( and anyone listening to these podcasts regularly knows there needs to be more of that going on ) was a pleasant surprise . 
  not because i hate ronda ( i actually like her ) , but because some of the rudiculous shit joe says needs to be challenged from time to time . 
  she was n't born this way , she changed due to steroid abuse . 
  it was her own actions that resulted in this , now she has to live with the consequences ... good and bad . 
  [ i bet women see her as a role model too .

  i realized r/politics has been lost a couple of months ago , so i do n't go there , but now that i checked back to see what they 're up to these days ... wow , it 's like parody subreddit pointing out the biased media coverage ... except it 's real . 
  / r/politics is very hard to describe like anything other than an extension of hillary 's campaign . 
  it 's the / r/the _ donald of the left ( masquerading itself as some unbiased hub for political news ... how fitting ) . 
  i mean just look at this shit : http://i.imgur.com/mmzntfv.png that is the front page of the sub on a 1080p monitor . 
  negatively obsessed with trump ... that would be an understatement . 
  what do you mean ? 
  if all the insults and digging up of the dirt then yes . 
  buuut this election is unique in the ( now , thanks to the podesta emails , indisputable ) collusion between the mainstream media and the clinton campaign . 
  btw this also applies to twitter \\* and , to a degree , reddit ( just look at how r/the _ donald has been treated by the admins - they literally changed the site 's algorithms to make sure r/the _ donald 's posts do n't end up on r/all - and how nothing is done about / r/politics ) .
