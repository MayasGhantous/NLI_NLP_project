  the fact that it happens is just that , a fact . 
  we know this at this point . 
  some media outlets went so far that they do n't even bother to * appear * to be impartial anymore and stated their affiliation publicly . 
  we have maybe a half a dozen to a dozen of media outlets where this collusion has been proven to be true , the rest of them are of course in question , but any reasonable , impartial readers can guess which way the wind is blowing . 
  now , the motivation ... is disputable . 
  from simply being democrats ( and [ 96 % ] ( https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/10/17/20330/journalists-shower-hillary-clinton-campaign-cash ) of media campaign contributions go to clinton , so we know this is true ) to being [ regressive leftists ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=regressive%20left ) , [ virtue signalling ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=virtue%20signalling ) or just cashing in on the clickbait and outrage ( at this point the `` trump said x today , let 's discuss why it 's horrible and the parallels to hitler 's campaign '' type of article could be a template in the huffpo and co. editorial systems ) ... or a combination of all of them . 
  \\* twitter and their predominant bannings of conservative figures are well known at this point . 
  this would be perfectly ok if they also banned the subsection of blm activists or feminists who openly promote violence or harassment ( against white people/cops or men , respectively ) . 
  there are tens of larger and maybe hundreds of smaller cases of this behavior ( all documented , mainly by conservatives or men 's rights activists as no one else will cover these things since they 're not a pc thing to talk about ) , but nothing is being done about them since twitter is openly aligned with blm and 3rd wave feminism ( just google around and i 'm sure you 're gon na find plenty of evidence , it 's not a secret , not to mention twitter 's `` trust and safety council '' ) . 
  oh an by the way , this is not limited to bannings of uncomfortable people , the hashtags and their autocomplete are censored all the time . 
  you can take the developer [ out of russia ] ( http://gotocyprus.wargaming.com/en/ ) , but you ca n't take russia out of the developer . 
   once you know about it you start to see how very particular the ec is about its narrative . 
  the same applies to the likes of buzzfeed , gawker , salon ... initially the articles and videos may just seem like `` stupid clickbait '' , and to a degree they are , but once you look into it ( and learn about all the bullshit ideas forming the backbone of today 's `` progressive '' left ) , you 'll see it everywhere . 
  buzzfeed will manage to cram in `` white privilege '' into a fucking burger taste test video . 
  you can say that about any subreddit . 
  nsfw ones doubly so . 
   before someone chimes in with `` the first amendment does n't apply to private websites '', 
  too late, 
   world news seriously needs a change . 
  yeah , it needs to be more like / r/politics , right ? 
  i 'd rather have 90 % of trolling , racist , xenophobic , nazi comments than a censored `` safe space '' with none of that but also with only one `` correct '' opinion allowed . 
  2k czech ? 
  hangar 13 developed the game . 
  2k czech is not a publisher , it 's a developer , just like hangar 13 is . 
  what you 're probably looking for is just `` 2k games '' , which is the publisher of the game . 
  it 's probably one of the most team heavy games ever made ( excluding things like milsims ofc ) . 
  even in something like cs go you can have fun playing alone ( i mean in a team of randoms with minimal or zero voice chat ) ... not so much in evolve , the game just does n't work that well ( and is quite boring ) if the hunters do n't play as a team . 
  turtle rock went balls deep in that direction , made it a selling point and - as it now appears - there was no one to ask the `` should we '' question in addition to the `` can we '' question . 
  all the `` team based '' games from battlefield and csgo to dota are best played in a group , but you can still have a lot of fun with randoms ( i 'd even go as far as to say this one feature is single handedly responsible for the financial success of these franchises ) . 
  evolve is n't just best played in a group , it * requires * a group . 
  if you do n't cooperate well enough , you 'll be running around the map like headless chicken and simply not having fun . 
  i played quite a bit of l4d and it was nowhere as bad as evolve . 
  [ as far as playing with pubbies goes . ], 
  no one cares . 
  how about that .

   i may not have much experience , about 20 minutes on google and 4 last week tonight videos , but i have to say , trump is a better choice than hillary / s, 
  no one sane and well educated about the subject can support hillary . 
  does n't matter if you 're a democrat or even support hillary 's program , hillary * will not * do what she 's saying she will do . 
  you talk about `` 20 minutes on google and 4 last week tonight videos '' , but that 's what most hillary voters do . 
  they do n't * really * care about politics ( or policy ) , they see 125th rape allegation or 2598th out of context quote on cnn or msnbc , decide trump is a dick and virtue signal like mad . 
  instead of being outraged * about the content * of wikileaks emails , they 're outraged * about * wikileaks . 
  i mean , how dare they make my candidate look like a two faced pathological liar [ with a history full of incompetence and malicious intent ] !, 
  i 've seen multiple speeches from both , i 've seen all 3 debates + the vp debate , i follow this entire thing for months . 
  hillary winning is not the lesser of two evils . 
  not by a long shot . 
  ( unless the only thing you care about is having a female potus ... in which case you probably should n't vote ... or procreate . ), 
   yeah they 're done kissing her ass . 
  meanwhile , joe rogan 's ass kissing mode got a second wind . 
  british bbs will fix the meta for sure ... wait .

   display of power , it 's like half of the russian navy is in the mediterranean, 
  [ umm . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_russian_navy_ships ), 
   the northern fleet headed by the admiral kuznetsov carrier monitored at a size of least 8 ships in the english channel en route to syria to participate in the attack of aleppo . 
  8 ships seems like a poor display of power if that was their intention . 
  i very much doubt it . 
  this is most likely what it appears to be - a support force for their air raids . 
  and people cry all the time about him `` holding up '' multiple divisions etc. . . bitch please . 
   russian navy 's fallen far since the ussr days . 
  russian navy is not a priority and , arguably , never has been . 
  if the us navy and the russian navy met in a conventional conflict , the russian navy would be reduced to dust fairly quickly . 
  but that conflict will never happen and both sides know this ... and build their forces accordingly . 
  the us navy is not intended to attack russia or china , it 's intended to project power on a global scale and be able to move a lot of firepower quickly . 
  it 's built to be able to implement us foreign interests with a very high degree of efficiency ( if that 's by design or just a natural consequence of the us foreign policy over the last 30 years is not really important ) . 
  it 's great for its intended purpose . 
  the russian navy , unlike the us navy has no such ambitions . 
  of course they need to keep the strategic part ( nuclear subs ) up to date ( which they do ) , but other than that ... trying to compete with the us in the number of aircraft carriers ( for example ) would make no sense , they simply do n't need them for what they do . 
  russia is only interested in its own defense and maybe some degree of localized expansion here and there ( and even then they 're limited to unofficial support and proxy wars ) . 
  as for syria , let 's not forget that russia is an ally of the elected syrian government . 
  until such time that the us has developed and deployed a robust missile defense shield of such potency that it is able to intercept modern marved icbms at mach 20 , the us-russian conflict is limited to proxy wars and economic sanctions . 
  that technology does n't exist yet and probably will not exist for some time . 
  what use is a carrier strike group to you when the enemy can just nuke the group and you have no way of preventing that from happenening ? 
  in such a situation it does n't really matter if you have 1 or 10 groups . 
  the russian navy and the us navy will most likely never meet in battle . 
  ehh . . 
  i think it 's much simpler than that . 
  she most likely realized in the holm fight that the striking skill gap between her and holly is so vast , she would need years of training to catch up . 
  i mean , what 's in the cards for ronda now ? 
  if she loses , that will probably be the last time we see her in the octagon . 
  if she manages to sneak an armbar in , the next contenders are probably chevchenko ( world class striker ) or holm rematch ( world class striker ) . 
  i do n't see this saga going past two fights , she 's just being realistic . 
  no one cares about baseball outside of the u.s. no one . 
  fucking golf is more popular than baseball . 
  for real though , there are a few exceptions , but the general popularity of baseball outside of the u.s. is very low . 
  as in native brazilian experimented on by native brazilian scientists ? 
   it 's a pc and real time . 
  umm , not really . 
  well , kinda . 
  i mean , this may have been realtime , i 'm not gon na argue about something i ca n't prove , but it 's good to know that cryengine has a `` movie '' output mode ( capture_frames ) where it will take as much time as necessary to render a full frame while having all the settings pushed as far as they can go . 
  the scene is rendered in some ridiculous resolution like 8k and then downsampled . 
  also , a side effect of this capture mode is that you do n't have to worry about lods and you can cram in as much triangles and texels as the hardware can support ( e.g. 
  8gb vram/8k textures/100m polys etc. 
  ) , because the framerate or freezes/hitching caused by the streaming system are irrelevant . 
  the same applies to physics . 
  look at the framerate [ in this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryt5yehgj6y&amp;t=20s ) when the barrels start to fall ( 0.5 fps ) or after the explosions start ( < 0.1 fps ) . 
  this , in essence , is no different than rendering a scene in 3ds max or blender . 
  this is also how starcitizen creates their crazy looking trailers and ship commercials .
