  we should all hang out . 
  so ... does the game have a decent pvp yet ? 
  anything for a click/exposure , that 's the name of the game as far as today 's journalism goes . 
  comment there :, 
   so , basically you are smearing feces all around your backside with just water . 
  that does not sound very clean . 
  water by itself does not clean , soap is necessary , or else you are smearing feces all around your bum . 
   i know you wash your hands at the sink , but what about when you run into bathrooms that are out of soap . 
  now you have feces on your hand . 
   last thing , you are bound to get feces under your fingernails . 
  we all know hand washing does not get all the dirt out from under ones nails . 
  now you have feces there . 
   i think i would rather go with toilet paper . 
  you are going to leave something behind , but it is in one small area and underwear can be washed at the end of the day . 
  the idea of having feces smeared everywhere and having it on my hands and under my nails seems quite unsanitary . 
  i 'm not a scatology expert , but i 'd say his point was that he 'd rather have shit particles on his ass than on his hands ( or , specifically , under his nails ) . 
  the problem with games these days is that there so many of them , at least on the pc . 
  which , do n't get me wrong , is a nice problem to have ... but if you have so many to choose from , you 'll start asking yourself `` is this worth my time '' more frequently than `` is this worth the price '' . 
  thanks to the `` freebie '' programs ( on the house , ubi 30 etc ) , steam sales , franchise deals and all kinds of bundles , i now have 383 games on steam , 36 on origin and 10 on uplay ( plus throw in a couple on gog and batle.net ) . 
  i played maybe 10 % of them . 
  so , what i 'm trying to say ? 
  for some people , even zero dollars may * not * be worth it . 
  therefore , while the op 's post is a joke , it 's valid to ask if the game is even worth messing with . 
   do n't bother . 
  it tried to be a dark souls imitation without knowing why dark souls is great in the first place . 
  it 's slow and weighty in a way that feels chunky and boring instead of tight and polished . 
  i liked the character design and armor art style , i wanted to give the game a chance , but you 're right . 
  the game just is n't as engaging and fun to play as ds is . 
  i stopped playing after a couple hours and never got back to it . 
   not to mention that pc is a clusterfuck of hardware/software configurations that no developer could possibly test in totality . 
   even if two machines have the exact same hardware , they 'll have different firmware versions , different driver versions , different third-party programs running in the background , etc. 
  most of these headaches are * greatly * reduced by using one of the great three middleware engines ( ue4/ce5/unity5 ) . 
  gamers tend to think about game engines as if they were just renderers ( in the sense of the fidelity of the graphics , i.e. 
  `` this looks like that , i can see it uses engine x '' and `` this is using engine x , obviously it looks great '' , not in the sense of compatibility ) , but as the developers know , they 're so much more . 
  for multiplatform titles or pc titles , i 'd argue 1/3 or more of the value of a middleware engine is in the thousands upon thousands of man-hours put into platform support , compatibility and optimization of the core systems . 
  the other 2/3 is split between the quality of the tools and the actual engine features ( networking , ai , scripting , renderer ... ) . 
  it 's going to get removed sooner or later , just like in wot . 
  wg sadly seems to listen to sheltered idiots complaining about muh feels and using buzzwords like `` toxic '' . 
  banter not allowed . 
  ptsd from a game chat and [ cyber bullying ] ( https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/285670822264307712 ) are real . 
  you must be new here ( and by here i mean the planet ) . 
  india has a huge ( and to a degree unique ) problem with people defecating in the streets . 
  it 's a combination of the massive population , poverty and culture . . and other factors . 
  tl ; dr : there 's a lack of public and home toilets .

  for me personally , the ww1 theme is just not interesting . 
  i understand that people like the change from a modern setting to ww1 , but it 's not for me ( especially since it 's filled with fringe ww1 hardware , e.g. 
  all the automatic weapons ) . 
  i 'm sure there are many people like me and that alone pretty much ensures bf4 will live on for a long time . 
  it does n't make bf4 better than bf1 or vice versa , it just makes them different . 
  bf4 will live on until a wothy modern replacement ( bf5 ? ), 
  will be released . 
   while everyone seems to feel like it loses authenticity because of that i keep thinking , all the guns you get in bf4 are n't exactly standard for the different armies . 
  the issue is that mechanically , bf1 could have been a lot more unique if it featured predominantly bolt action and semi-auto weapons . 
  while bf1 is very different in terms of the theme ( and , to a degree , vehicles ) , it 's very close in terms of core gameplay mechanics of the gunplay . 
  when you 're in a typical infantry firefight , this makes it feel a lot like bf4 . 
  this may be a * good * thing for many people ( if you like the bf3/bf4 gunplay and just want a new theme ) , but not for me , because i enjoy the modern setting and to stick with bf1 i 'd need different mechanics . 
   it has a lot of exotic crap that you wo n't likely see on the battlfield today either . 
  what do you mean exactly ? 
  i 'm not aware of any weapons outside of dlc `` novelty '' items ( crap like ~ ~ bfg ~ ~ sorry , railgun , lol ) that are not used in all kinds military units around the world . 
  i mean , there may be a few , but most of the guns are being used ( `` the military '' does n't end with the u.s. and the marine corps ) . 
  the motherfucker cheats both inside and outside of the octagon . 
  designer drugs and the `` tainted supplement '' fallback mean you can be juiced to the gills and work around the system ... if you know what you 're doing . 
  the history and the `` smell test '' are there , there 's no question , not even an iota of doubt , that he 's using peds . 
   honesty does n't pay and cheaters usually prosper . 
  `` fake it 'til you make it '' . 
  as for the honesty when talking to the authorities etc. . . just do n't . 
  there 's a reason you [ should never talk to the cops ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zggklgvnfao ) . 
  the same applies here . 
  the linked site says `` december update '' ...

  he forgot to disengage drs ( the big ass rear wing was down ) and he had little rear grip . 
   runnin from battle in ww1 ? 
  the french army mutinies of 1917 ? 
   ww2 we got crushed by the blitzkrieg, 
  when the germans invaded france it was super easy for them . 
  you say blitzkrieg , but what i 'm seeing is that the french were not aggressive and instead of attacking german supply lines , they built fortifications and formed defensive lines ( and they did know what the germans intended to do due to spying and captured documents ) . 
  i 'm sure the fact that between ww1 and ww2 you had a shit ton of goverments and the great depression did n't help morale much . 
   nato withdrawal was also done to take back our country since nato was ( still is ? ), 
  an american dominated entity . 
  more like you left when the soviets were scary enough ... and returned only after they were long gone ( and just to be sure after 9/11 , afghanistan and iraq ) . 
  aaaand nato is still an `` american dominated entity '' , maybe more than ever . 
  you need coal ( coke ) to make steel . 
  you need coal ( fly ash ) to make concrete . 
  if trump is anywhere near serious about rebuilding the infrastructure and you do n't want to buy everything from china , you 're gon na need coal mines . 
   this shit has to stop . 
  yes , but the answer are n't wind turbines or solar panels , they 're unreliable . 
  [ building more nuclear power plants ] ( https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_shellenberger_how_fear_of_nuclear_power_is_hurting_the_environment ) and investing more into nuclear fusion r&d ( ala iter ) is the way to go . 
  pretty much the only bad thing about the game was the unskippable nature of the cutscenes . 
  i do n't know what the deal is or if you were all born yesterday , but the unskippable cutscenes were ( and still are ) pretty much the number one issue people have with the game . 
  just read the negative steam reviews .
