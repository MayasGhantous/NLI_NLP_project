  now that we 've estabilished they 're watching , i just want to say ** fuck you ea people ** !, 
  ea guys pls tell bach he 's a fucking wizard . 
  what sucks ? 
  afaik the dude did n't leak anything of value , he just said that the mp is being handled by dice ( la ? 
  let me know when you get fired , so i can be glad . 
  he did . 
  op needs a ban for posting bs . 
  fuck him with your peter , ea . 
  nice try , ea . 
  does n't mean i ca n't tell ea to suck a fat one when they 're allegedly watching . 
   they fucked up countless games and even whole studios with their policies , i have nothing good to say about them . 
  the fact that they own the battlefield franchise and dice ( and bioware : / ) is just a sad reality of life . 
  dammit , now i do n't know if to use http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefieldhardline or this . 
  word of advice : do n't . 
  nice , so / r/bf _ hardline it is !, 
  ue4 begs to differ . 
  i 'm not talking about the games released . 
  i 'm reacting to a statement about the engine as an engineering toolset . 
  ce is a poorly documented , closed source and does n't even have proper fbx import ... etc. 
  lua scripting is also nothing to be proud of . 
  with ue4 getting lpvs , there 's exactly zero reason for you to choose ce over ue4 * unless * you 're a big studio ( with source access ) that can shape the engine to their liking ( or go around its issues by throwing more manpower at it ) . 
  but even then it 's arguable ... and that use case is irrelevant for this steam release . 
  btw if i 'd want to be controversial , i 'd say that while we can argue about `` best looking '' ( speaking of which , what the hell is a best looking engine ? 
  engine is just a set of tools . 
  is he talking about shading/lighting ? 
  lpvs and pbr etc. ? 
  all those are in ue4 and in the case of pbr , arguably better than in ce . 
  ) , the `` most full-featured engine '' part is just a lie . 
  i want bach . 
  where 's bach ? 
  the wizard is my hero . 
  god damn it bundle stars !, 
  i have almost all your bundles and the new ones wo n't stop coming :(, 
  indeed , condoms are very important . 
  protect yourselves . 
  mexican origin to the rescue ? 
  no , but it 's not as good as two dicks in the ass . 
  so you defend [ at least 6 delays ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/26rdy1/star_citizens_dogfighting_module_gets_delayed_for/chtrj7x ) in total ... the last of which we 've been told about pretty much at the release day . 
  i wonder how did you manage to keep your supposed `` software qa lead in the it industry '' position . 
  6 delays is just pure incompetence at setting and meeting deadlines . 
  your `` society '' spin is cute . 
  6 delays = incompetence . 
  plain and simple . 
  `` building software '' has nothing to do with it . 
  on the other hand , the fact that they ca n't plan for shit has * everything * to do with it . 
  do not pre-order !, 
  nice , ca n't wait for the next 10 bugs that will pop up in `` arena commander v. 8 daily bug update - may 30 , 2014 '' ... 
  we want visceral flair . 
  dice had their chance !, 
  or is this dice la ? 
  so , whith these daily bug dump articles , cig has at least two weeks worth of site content . 
  clever . 
  i will . 
  stop me . 
  i searched for a bit and it seems the fellow gamers over at neogaf may have an answer :, 
  so it does seem like visceral may be at least contributing to the mp ( `` highly skilled multiplayer designer '' ) . 
  [ 6 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/26rdy1/star_citizens_dogfighting_module_gets_delayed_for/chtrj7x ) . 
  who is/was the ea employee ? 
  yes and righfully so ( 6 delays ), 
  ok , so * was * . 
  is 400 enough to be considered an idiot ? 
  good !, 
  also confirmed by ian milham [ directly on this sub ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bf_hardline/comments/26vig3/so_who_is_working_on_the_multiplayer/chvacba ) . 
  fun but frustrating . 
  script kiddies at it again ... meh . 
  a few network admins will have a bad day , but that 's about it . 
  this ** actually ** makes you grasp how big of a problem the average delay bf4 engine has to work with is . 
  i mean , i 'm not some mlg uber-pro , but with 400 hours of gameplay to base my opinion on , it really seems like the `` grenade thrown , i can die now '' interval can sometimes take a ** fucking eternity ** . 
  there were times when i could swear it took like a second since the point of me throwing the grenade and me dying , but the explosion was nowhere to be seen . 
  never mind the beta state , but am i the only one having a feeling that this looks just a bit * too * much like battlefield 4 ? 
  the first few minutes are literally like from a bf4 map with motorcycles ... 
  i was hoping for a more significant departure . 
  battlefield : hardskin, 
  it 's a damn same game . 
  same in-game ui , same sound assets , shared visual assets ( i.e. 
  elevator buttons , but that 's just me being lazy listing them , there are tons ) , police chopper is the same as little bird and by that i mean they seem identical ( just a different 3d model ) , the same goes for the apc . 
  it 's literally bf4 with different models and modes . 
  people calling it a `` mod '' are not that far off . 
  of course this is all just based on this beta footage , but you do n't need a polished game on a full server to get the feeling of what the engine is about and how the game is built . 
  you should seriously consider changing your soon to some day . 
  i 'm sorry but complaining about community is retarded . 
  it 's a popular , mainstream multiplayer shooter . 
  what do you expect ? 
  fucking butterflies and unicorns ? 
  or what ? 
  go play arma if you want perfect coordination and dedication . 
  this whole `` humanity sucks therefore the game sucks '' attitude is just stupid . 
  edit : fuck , i missed / s in my rage . 
  i hated aws , now i kinda like it ? 
  and mg4 now feels worse to me . . somehow : /, 
  the `` netcode '' feels way better imo . 
  it 's not placebo . 
  it 's definitely tighter . 
  so he can constantly spam uavs ? 
  thanks but no thanks . 
  nice try , drug cartel !, 
  fuck narrative . 
  who needs a b-movie quality story in their games ? 
  i mean most games are terrible at telling a story and have a screenplay that usually feels like it was written by a 12 year old .
