  welcome to the modern open-world gaming . 
  everyone hates broccoli . 
   scientifically proven testing, 
  you realize that anti-doping is always playing catch up , right ? 
  the pages long list of stripped olympic medals is just one example of that ( and it grows as drug testing gets better and old samples get tested with these new methods ) . 
   just give 'em a good look over, 
  that 's literally one of the criteria when looking at which fighters to focus on , they call it a [ smell test ] ( http://mmajunkie.com/2015/08/ufcs-jeff-novitzky-smell-test-among-usadas-tools-in-rooting-out-ped-offenders ) . 
  the `` always been like this '' and `` grew up on a farm '' in the face of looking like a 24/7 powerlifter are ... very reminiscent of brock 's `` i 'm a white boy and i 'm jacked -- deal with it '' . 
   in a fairly quick fashion, 
  it was n't quick by any means and we should also keep in mind that cpy is the one and only group able to crack denuvo . 
  there were early exceptions to this rule which managed to use exploits in older implementations of denuvo ( these `` cracks '' were crap though , did n't work on half the systems etc. 
  ) , but pretty much since mad max and ( broken ) mgs5 cracks no one except cpy has been able to touch denuvo . 
  it 's a valid question if the scene would be able to continue to crack denuvo if the police got to cpy ... probably not . 
  the scene is a competitive place and the rival groups had a lot of time to try to crack denuvo - pretty much years at this point - none of them released anything protected by it so far . 
  the great firewall for idiots . 
  as other people mentioned the only ballsy military shooter was spec ops . 
  even no russian was more edgy than anything . 
  as for the topic in general : i 'm still waiting for that aaa game which lets me play as an actual villain ( as opposed to `` a dick '' ) without boatloads of moralizing and automatic punishment ( bad player , bad !, 
  i think most of us expected this . 
  the next step has to be the popularization of the investor model ( in the spirit of fig.co ) which can ten pick up the slack or even exceed the 2015 or 2014 crowdfunding numbers . 
  i invested some money into project cars and even though i did n't like the physics model , the delays and ultimately the game , i ca n't complain since i got like 300 % roi on that investment to date . 
  and people say soccer is boring ... 
  is it just me or does she look like female tim kennedy in this picture ? 
  sf native ? 
   jesus christ , stop having crippling medically verifiable anxiety disorders and march on to the fucking plane like a boss singing i am the greatest . 
  my god , the lack of empathy here is ... 
  it 's not a lack of empathy , it 's disgust over the ridiculousness of the first world problems people have in the u.s. and especially in cities like sf . 
  if you need a therapy pig because you are scared of flying ... your life is too easy . 
  way too easy . 
  you could have been born in nigeria or north korea . 
  or any other truly poor country . 
  you won the lottery just by being born in the right place . 
  this kind of life filled with shit like therapy pigs , venti iced skinny hazelnut macchiatos and instagram whores is most likely why these cities are full of sheltered , out of touch lefties who never experienced true hardship in their entire lives . 
  talk about `` privilege '' ... 
  carry on then . 
   the most internet masculine, 
  what normal people say : keyboard warrior . 
  what libtards say : internet masculine . 
  better save that money for the eventual lawsuit . 
  strength - comes from trt/hgh/steroids . 
  conditioning - the habit you develop by injecting regularly . 
   the next gen of americans, 
  just may have a chance to not be brainwashed by the regressive left propaganda . 
   it 's the standard mistake made when someone tries to implement censorship without having any real clue what they 're doing, 
  also known as `` naive implementation '' . 
  usually used for quick prototyping and proof of concept work . 
  sadly the game is full of half assed solutions as far as programming goes ( this includes the engine itself ) . 
   4 different options that are n't specifically good or evil, 
  it 's bioware so they 're all guaranteed to be politically correct either way , i.e. 
  `` evil '' will be `` dickish '' at worst . 
  the difficulty of these body weight excercises is directly proportional to your weight . 
  `` here 's a girl going twice as high '' means absolutely nothing . 
   do the russians still have the bombs . 
  i 'm all for conspiracy theories but this is * actually * retarded . 
  you fucking nazi . 
  somebody punch him . 
  ok , i think i 'm done ,, 
   buzzfeed estimated, 
  was too much . 
  they 're [ very fake news ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_s1ynxfce8 ), 
   whiteboard, 
  that 's racist . 
   100 % love . 
  [ tough love ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohd29smbu7i ) . 
   the difference is woodley is an exciting fighter . 
  people do n't tune in to watch maia, 
  people do n't tune in to watch woodley either . 
  look at the ppv numbers , he 's not a draw . 
  not only that , it 's highly debatable that we should promote this `` looking at aggressive striking is the only way to have fun '' mentality some new or more casual fans seems to have . 
  this is not kickboxing , it 's mma and bjj is an integral part of it . 
  ** the way maia strangles his opponents is awesome to look at . 
  half a second , lmfao . 
  cloud incompetent games . 
   i do n't wan na know how much work it takes to write a netcode for such a huge game pretty much from scratch . 
  good thing then that they had over 4 years to do it so far . 
   please close the door on the way out, 
  i did , i sold my $ 250 constellation package on the grey market like 18 months ago after seeing 0 progress and i do n't post here at all ... 
  i 'm just subbed to battle ( non ) sense and visited this sub to see what the fanboys have to say about this pathetic result . 
  as expected , it 's all fine and `` netcode rewrite is coming '' ... lmao, 
  np , man ... happy to help , if it makes you happy then that 's all that matters :p, 
  khabib will never have kids , he pulls out every time !, 
   yes some facial animations look weird, 
  some ? 
   but honestly that 's always been the case in me, 
  oh , all is well then , no need to improve over a 10 year old game, 
  i hope you mean the 2018 one ... 
  i mean , were n't there like 9 significant strikes in the first 6 minutes ? 
  that kinda set up the whole boo thing ... 
   multiple scientific studies support this . 
  and multiple scientific studies support intermittent fasting . 
   just do n't think that it has some special biological effects . 
  your opinion . 
  anyways , way too many people get the whole `` calorie intake '' thing wrong . 
  there 's the basic scientific truth based on thermodynamics which means that if you eat 1500 calories and your body needs 2000 , you will lose weight . 
  but everything else is a question of metabolism . 
  metabolism which can be affected by a millon factors , from the types of food you eat and the way you eat to your level of physical activity . 
  saying that fasting has no biological effects is stupid . 
  more like in 2020 . 
  no i 'm not trolling . 
  remind me bot just sent me [ this year old thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/49hy5z/why_does_the_stigma_remain_so_strong_for_sc/d0rx2pb/ ) .
