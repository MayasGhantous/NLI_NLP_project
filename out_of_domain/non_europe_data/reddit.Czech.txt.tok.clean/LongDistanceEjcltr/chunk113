   when a man is attracted to much younger women , i think it implies a lack of maturity on his part . 
  what a ridiculous thing to say . 
  i do n't see any problems with a 40 year old man being with a 20 year old woman . 
  why ? 
  biology and evolution . 
  simple things , really . 
  up to a point , men increase in value as they age ( especially if succesful ) while women decrease in value as they age ( especially if attractive ) . 
  that has nothing to do with society or culture and everything to do with the simple fact that most men are fertile for most of their life while women experience a sharp drop in fertility after 35 with up to 9 out of 10 women being infertile after 45 . 
  it 's a trade-off , while women can ( and should ) cash in on their attractiveness while they 're young , men have to deal with the fact that there 's nothing less valuable than a strapping young lad ... strapped for cash . 
  that is the reason the ( very common ) older man - younger woman dynamic exists . 
  what you 're trying to imply is that older men who are into younger women must be immature because why else would they want to spend their time with young women ? 
  attractivity . 
  children . 
  basic stuff . 
  no protomolecules needed !, 
  if you 're not interested in the entire thing at least watch the bartlett clip which begins at [ 55:30 ] ( https://youtu.be/fmxrddgpo-i?t=3330 ) . 
  guys like you seem to be ungrateful bastards . 
  what a bitch . 
  muslim , christian , all trash . 
  how are religions a thing in 2017 is beyond me ... 
   lol uh oh they are on trump and joe is bashing him . 
  how fun . 
  i mean let 's talk about weed and bash trump for 10248th time . 
  we have n't heard that before . 
  so original . 
  it 's a circlejerk of opinions that is only ever discussed with people who agree with joe ( which is like 9 out of 10 guests given the type of people he mostly talks to - prototypal la liberals preferably from the entertainment bussiness , i.e. 
  virue signalling sheltered people ) ... and if it somehow happens that a guest does n't agree and it 's discussed and the guest is not a comedian ( the discussion is n't all jokes and ridicule ) you end up with someone like alex jones . 
  wonderful , lol ... 
  i 'm still waiting for the day when joe grows a pair and gets ben shapiro . 
  that shit i would pay for to see . 
   there 's a huge difference between being a conservative and being a trump supporter, 
  if there is then you 're in for a rude awakening since close to a half of all voters are trump supporters as they obviously voted him into the office . 
  if what you 're saying is true , that would mean there 's a ton of conservatives on top of trump supporters , i.e. 
  the democrat voters would be a minority . 
  but do n't worry , it 's not like that , it 's just your feeble mind writing down feeble minded garbage . 
  the rumor has it that 2dark got preferential treatment from cpy because of the developer 's [ crowd funding claims ] ( https://torrentfreak.com/game-pirates-celebrate-fall-of-denuvos-brand-new-protection-170414/ ) . 
  yeeeeeeey , we did n't have a round of talking about `` old white guys '' , `` bigotry '' and a whole lot of trump bashing for a long time !, 
  and by long time i mean a day . 
  the entire show went full retard since trump 's election . 
  `` non-binary '' , `` another sexuality '' ... 
  i see this sub is firmly in line with bioware 's politics, 
   it 's cgi . 
  if you want to see how a person with long , weightless/low gravity cgi hair looks like , watch arrival . 
  spoiler alert : [ it looks like garbage ] ( https://youtu.be/-o0mwxqs0q4?t=519 ) . 
  i 'm sure a movie with $ 50m budget and 60 seconds of that render has nothing on nasa 's / esa 's hundreds ( more like thousands ) of hours of photorealistic space station footage renders ... 
  eddie smoked a hole in his brain . 
  it 's not * just * that , those are `` details '' compared to basically denying huge swaths of science , e.g. 
  astronomy and astrophysics . 
  in the age of lhc or ligo we 're discussing people who think the earth is flat . 
  fuck those people . 
  fuck them . 
  this is not about having an opinion , this is not about politics . 
  i do n't want to hear even just one more word that comes out of eddie 's mouth . 
  or lupus . 
  an iowa class battleship - the sexiest there is . 
  i refuse to touch the game again until the netcode has been completely separated from the client code / performance . 
  i do n't care in what state of development is your game , the performance of the server has no god damn business affecting the performance of the client . 
  star citizen may be one of the very few multiplayer games ( and maybe the only modern one ) that do this . 
  imagine if battlefield 4 or 1 ( which is probably the closest in terms of netcode complexity ) * slowed down * when the server had issues instead of you just getting rubber banding and dusting . 
  everyone would laugh it out of the door , but for star citizen , it 's tolerated ( at least by a significant portion of the community ) . 
  if 3.0 releases without this , it 's no 3.0 , but just another compromised release `` because they could n't make it in time otherwise '' . 
  any compromises in terms of technology or game mechanics have to go at this point . 
  no more half assed solutions and underdeveloped mechanics . 
  no more engine rewrites , no more `` item 3.0 '' kind of cop outs . 
  we 're 5 years into the development . 
  if a system is n't up to your standards , do n't put it into the game as a temporary solution to be reworked some time in the future . 
  edit : well then , [ i guess i have my answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/672q7z/everyone_seems_to_be_obsessing_over_network_bind/dgnirsw/ ) . 
  * penis *, 
  japan : where porn has to be censored , but children can fight to death . 
  bad japan , bad !, 
  not if you 're a feminist . 
   unforutnately this is not going into 3.0 as it is a huge epic legendary task that will introduce many complexities into various other systems in the game, 
  how is this * not * already part of the core technology after 5 years of development ? 
  seems to me like you 're just pushing out dumbed down systems to show something to the backers and pretty much all these systems then have to go through `` huge epic legendary '' reworks . 
  and here i thought the object container streaming was a feature already in the game and woking as intended ... silly me . 
  would be kind of pointless otherwise . 
  unless it 's a system meant for another rework in the future . 
  of course you 're not moved by this , eddie ... you 're for elbows to the back of the head after all :p, 
  fertile grounds for new players lol, 
  yes . 
  the last 5 guests ... 11/10 . 
  quantum break was problematic because it sucked , not because of some `` weird exclusivity '' . 
  a short , sp only , story driven , $ 60 dollar game where the story part is basically a c grade tv series is not going to do well . 
  i think that demos/trials which are based on the shipping exe 's protection actually give cpy the much needed time to get to a working crack relatively close to the release . 
  i think that both resident evil 7 ( dec 19 demo ) and me : andromeda ( mar 16 trial ) were victims of that and this is the actual reason that denuvo protected titles will not have demos in the future . 
  impossible . 
  every social justice ~ ~ warrior ~ ~ activist knows that black people ca n't be racist . 
   dan seems like a good thoughtful dude . 
  what a shame that the discussion regressed straight into discussing white people and slavery . 
  ( seriously , what is it with americans and the pathological white guilt ? 
  it 's not like you choose to be born white or be responsible for what your ancestors did ... ), 
  i have [ 100 + ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kugtaif.png ) hrs in the game . 
  cherry picked cases ? 
  the animations are garbage and i 'm not talking about the facial animations . 
  poor npc animations outside of combat , npc pathfinding issues and general lack of polish are omnipresent . 
  if you compare the animation work and detail to tw3 it feels like the game had 20 % of the budget of tw3 . 
  the animations are an obvious critique because you can make fun of them just based on the videos . 
  does n't make the criticism any less valid . 
   you 're acting awfully hurt about a game character, 
  yeah i liked the first game , not hard to grasp ...
