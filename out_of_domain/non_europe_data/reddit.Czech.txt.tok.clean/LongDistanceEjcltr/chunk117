  this is what happens when you spend most of your limited budget on performance capture and cinematics . 
  your mom 's in the fucking stands !, 
  i already know that . 
  i mean , i know you 're trying to help and appreciate that , but i 'm looking more for a `` i recommend clan x '' type of thing . 
  avg winrate etc. 
  tells me nothing about the activity , for example . 
  in the words of a famous italian pornographer : it ' z only smellz . 
  it 's then up to us to ask the question : but ... what if it was n't only smellz ? 
  smellz in / r/starcitizen 's terminology = software development . 
  also do n't ever underestimate the time it will take a new programmer to get familiar with the codebase . 
  if the project is large and you have responsibilities in multiple areas ( or even just many tickets which are not being processed out of the entire interdisciplinary workflow quick enough ) , constantantly switching between implementing this , researching that and fixing that 2 months old thing that came back from testing and has already left your memory space can be an absolute killer . 
  this is obviously even harder for a newbie . 
  a new programmer hire at cig probably is n't a net gain for like 6 months ( 3 months to get up to speed and 3 months to make up the time the rest of the team spent on assisting them ) . 
   because no one wants to hear you complain about something you poorly understand . 
  he just reacted to a post * specifically * pointing out misinformation , wtf are you talking about ? 
   do you think its helping the game get done any faster ? 
  yes . 
  oh god yes it does . 
  what this game needs is more skepticism in the community . 
  a lot more . 
  if all the donation money stopped flowing today , it would be the greatest thing that has happened since the original crowdfunding drive . 
  if there 's not a ** strong ** critical voice , there 's nothing pushing cr to finishing the game in any reasonable time frame . 
  it 's been 5 years , that is enough , it is time to start pushing things out of the door * rapidly * . 
  and yes , it is enough regardless of the game 's complexity , regardless of all the sugarcoating . 
  you can not be serious if you think that working on the most core aspects of the technology behind the game at this point is fine ( hell , some of them are still even in a r&d phase ! ) . 
  it 's not . 
  it 's insanity that will lead to another 5 year cycle . 
  we * know * that cr is a perfectionist . 
  we * know * that cr is a micromanager . 
  and we know that he was kicked out of the freelancer project because it was running late and over budget . 
  so to get back to your question : yes . 
  hell yes . 
  what is the alternative ? 
  blind belief ? 
  we have religions for that . 
  star citizen does n't need more fangirls . 
  it needs criticism . 
   stopping funding would be helpful, 
  of course it would be helpful . 
  cig can take a loan if it really needs to , but either way , it puts a deadline on the project . 
  at this point , that would be a net positive . 
   it would lead to am incomplete game , so does rushing deadlines . 
  yeah , yeah , evil publishers yadda , yadda - 5 years down the line , what is there to show for these 5 years of work ? 
  not much . 
  and sq42 is not even on the map . 
  is your solution another 5 years of work ? 
  then another 5 years ? 
  when does it stop ? 
  this is stupid . 
   we backed him specifically so he wouldnt ha e that stupid irrelevant constraint on the project, 
  speak for yourself , i backed the project because the pitch seemed reasonable and interesting enough . 
  then the bloat and feature creep happened and happens to this very day . 
  ( btw all the people who critize anyone using `` feature creep '' as something that does n't happen with sc is a joke - i probably have n't seen a project of any kind where it was more appropriate to use that term than with star citizen . 
  it 's feature creep , the game . ), 
   impatient fools, 
  5 years of waiting for nothing of substance is not being impatient - your argument has no basis in reality . 
   development is iterative, 
  they do n't iterate . 
  they redo . 
   you cant put a timeline on quality, 
  show me the quality that has been delivered to the backers in these 5 years . 
  it is n't there ( which is clear to anyone who has ever experienced the depth and performance of crusader or the sheer mediocrity of star marine ) . 
  not only the content we do have can barely be described with a word `` demo '' ( since none of it is representative of the final product in any way we 're talking about some form of an early prototype ) , it 's also a poor `` tech demo '' . 
  all these claims of quality are so far just that - claims . 
  promises . 
  there is no guarantee whatsoever that the game would be better with 5 more years of development than it would be with 2 if the current track record is anything to go by . 
   but what does this mean ? 
  military action ? 
  to what scale ? 
  hopefully the absolute scale . 
  level the whole place if you have to . 
  the united states invaded afghanistan and iraq on flimsy grounds , now when they have the moral high ground , they wo n't do it ? 
  i hope not . 
  the harshest of strikes is the only way to be sure nk wo n't retaliate in force . 
  maybe there 's a reason that ** no one ** has ever built it before . 
  maybe you 're not as good as you think you are . 
  coming from a long line of sniper ships starting with the bayern . 
  i 'd agree with that if we had something in our hands that is better than mediocre . 
  so far , the content that we have is ranging from unplayable to mediocre ... and that 's just the quality , the quantity is even worse . 
  if star citizen was `` an amazing piece of work '' that failed `` half-way through completion '' we 'd be still talking about 4.0 + in a 2019 + timeframe . 
   probably is suffering from intense feature creep, 
  not probably , this is factually accurate . 
  people will try to sugarcoat this by saying that the scope changed with the amount of backing , but that 's no excuse . 
  the whole nms part of the project never should have happened , it has literally erased years of work since a massive amount of code and assets were no longer viable and had to be redone from scratch . 
  it has delayed the project for years . 
  to this very day cig is hard at work on essential engine r&d to even be able to do the game they 're now trying to make . 
  the fact that it 's taking so long also has the unfortunate side effect of other studios and technology in general evolving with time which of course forces cig to consistently upgrade their renderer , from pbr to gpu particles to new lighting models and post process effects . 
  of course many of these systems do n't exist in a vacuum and have a tendency to cause a cascade of reworks ( case in point : pbr ... every single asset in the game using materials had to be tweaked or redone to work and look good with pbr ) . 
  the ships themselves also go through multiple reworks over the years ( and i mean complete overhauls , not iterative changes ) . 
  what you will usually hear at this point is an admission of all of this and a subsequent refutation of the argument `` cuz the publishers are bad mkay '' . 
  while a publisher may limit the ultimate creative freedom , it also provides much needed sanity checks and god knows star citizen needs those so much . 
  i 'm a backer , but i would n't consider myself a fan because the time for fangirling over the project and chris roberts has been over for a long time ( if you 're a reasonable person that is ) . 
  what do you mean ? 
  what is the `` nms part '' of the project ? 
  procedural planets . 
  this was never a part of the original crowdfunding drive nor was it in any of the stretch goals ( except the one involving procedural planet tech investigation and r&d to * maybe * add these into the game some time * after * the release ) . 
  the generator implementation was coming along nicely , but we soon discovered that our text rendering system needed to be refactored due to some unexpected incompatibilities with this new generator . 
  more on this in the coming weeks . 
  stay tuned !, 
  because they 're not a naive idiot ?
