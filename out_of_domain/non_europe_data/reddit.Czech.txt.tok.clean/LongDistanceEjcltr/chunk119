  meanwhile you have a line of battleships coming in that tops out at spotting ranges comparable to those of cruisers . 
   took a break 2 years ago, 
  i bet you 're enjoying the sea of content available now that was not available then , lol ... probably should have been 5 years , not 2 . 
   when will all the pre-release bugs be fixed ? 
  no one knows . 
  no one knows , might as well make a guess ... lem me model dat - / u/jdlshore, 
  since * no * content has been released since then , i think it 's pretty fucking obvious to even a * not a fucking idiot * that i 'm not talking about having access to n amount of content instead of n +100 amount of content ... 
  what do you enjoy about nms ? 
  the current 1.3 version . 
  be specific . 
  what makes you want to * play it * . 
  i 'd like to see someone specifying this because even 1.3 is an exceptionally weak game as far as gameplay mechanics go . 
  do people just look around , shoot some different colored rocks and then go to another planet , then repeat ? 
  if only people were so up in arms about a handful of de facto monopolies ( google - search , facebook - social networking , twitter - microblogging ) thought policing the mainstream internet as they are about net neutrality . 
  you have a buch of black box algorithms and moderating teams deciding not only what they 're going to censor and if they tell you about it , but also * if you should see something * that is within the tos . 
  [ f2004 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_0k_f06agg ) . 
   i 'm worried about cheats that give the player information about the location of all enemy ships and movements, 
  i do n't think you need to worry about that because afaik the client does n't get this information ( and so there is no data the cheating program can abuse ) . 
  this is different than in most fps games where the client needs to know about other player 's movement due to the nature of fps games ( pace , consistent visibility ) , making wallhack cheats possible . 
  edit : well , i said it 's `` afaik '' , but as i read this thread it appears the cheating program has something akin to a wallhack ( `` 3d radar '' ) ? 
  do n't know how/if it works , but yeah , it would probably take a response of a dev or someone who messed with the game 's network data to clarify the possiblity of this . 
  outskilled, 
  look at the yearly projection on social blade , -173.2 k. 
  video views do n't tell you that much since youtube itself is gaining reach ( more views overall ) . 
  the point here is that not only is his channel stagnating , it 's on a downward trend . 
  to be honest , i do n't think the `` trap gate '' has had a significant effect on those numbers , tb 's channel content is simply not interesting anymore to a lot of people . 
  compared to say two years ago , it 's in a different galaxy - both in terms of quality and quantity . 
   56 % is godlike among the general population . 
  smoke/radar combo is almost impossible to balance around . 
  yesterday i happened to `` win '' ( getting into , not winning ) a game of epicenter against double belfast platoon with staggered radars and smokes ... needless to say , we lost :d, 
   impressive ships, 
  thicc and sexy . 
   all you can do is either not play the game at all or block it out as much as possible . 
  or you just do not have to be a bitch about it . 
  some people do n't mind and some people even enjoy it . 
  the fact that you do n't want any contact with the people does n't give you any right to take that option away from others . 
  i understand that people should have an option to opt out of these `` community interactions '' as much as possible and i 'm fully on board with that , but this crying has gone long enough that some developers are starting to listen to it and it 's making games worse , not better ... e.g. 
  afaik world of tanks ( this is just an example , i 'm sure there are more ) has removed chat completely because a subset of players cried about toxicity . 
   the gaming community is filled with terrible people, 
  and judging by the tone of your post , you 're one of them . 
  do n't kid yourself , you 're not better and ridiculously pointing fingers without any proof only reinforces that assumption . 
   you do n't have to communicate to be toxic . 
  team killing , glitching , griefing , or just playing selfishly are all common occurrences . 
  oh boy , after reading your other post about `` terrible people in gaming '' , this one explains a lot . 
  word of advice : do n't ever try to play eve . 
  that one may actually trigger ptsd in you . 
  but you already have the option of blocking and muting . 
  yet you still complain . 
  what is your end goal here , then ? 
  and we trust them to finish the game because ... ? 
  they ca n't even deliver * a presentation * on time * multiple * times in a row . 
  hahahaha i 'm enjoying this trainwreck, 
  no , no , it 's amazing so far . 
  progress is progress . 
  - sc backer guy . 
  oh my god , are they doing the cringe script thing again ? 
  the thing this game needs the most at this point is ** definitely ** face tracking . 
  maybe because the last time they showed ground combat mission it was pretty much just a simplistic scripted pawn pew pew fest ( read : it looked bad ) and they have n't showed anything like that since . 
  their ai system is about as finished as the rest of the game is . 
  why they did n't show a mp firefight ? 
  beats me ... but as usual with sc , the more players on a server the more the framerate faceplants , so ... yeah . 
  and dat 5 fps in some angles ... lel, 
  above all the cringe and bugs , nothing in this presentation looked like fun . 
  gameplay just is n't there . 
  your move . 
  seems like he 's having some valid points though , lol :, 
  - `` btw , no combat yet . 
  not a single shot fired . 
  +100 mins in '', 
  - `` so basically they 're adding facial tracking which has nothing to do with the game and just more scope increase . 
  unbelievable '', 
  sargon has successfully shitposted himself into a lawsuit . 
  this is what you get when you 're `` too lazy to edit '' shit . 
  tbh i 've seen quite a bit of these on his shitposting channel , did n't know he was also doing it on his main ? 
  either way , here 's a [ recent example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo8broyrqpa ) - that is just a blatant copy of a portion of pewdiepie 's video , no editing , no commentary . 
  now maybe he would n't protest a strike in the case of this video , but you should not be needed to be told to not do shit like this . 
  the same as playing candy crush . 
   they have no more reason to make games anymore, 
  what happened to the good old joy of making games ? 
  which game sold more than 8 million copies in 2017 ? 
  ( btw pubg 's ea started on mar 23 , 2017 , so `` 2017 '' is being generous to other titles . ), 
  with maybe a few k of hp left and due to time running out . 
  damage dealt to me was 180k . 
  the ship is gk btw ( manual secondaries build ) . 
  good bot . 
   that dispersion on the mogami was absolutely filthy . 
  i think the technical term is [ really spicy ] ( https://youtu.be/lsryjsbm2hy?t=88 ) . 
  that was a different match ( also gk ) . 
  optimistic ... but probable . 
  i 'm one of the [ original backers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ge1zses.png ) turned sc pessimist , so i 'm a skeptic , but even as a hardcore fan you have to be a realist at this point . 
  with the amount of work needed to be done * before * closed testing begins increasing , not decreasing + closed testing ( evocati ) + open testing ( ptu ) , it is only logical to expect late december launch ( which also makes sense economically , you do n't want to compete with the october/november rush of aaa titles ) . 
  you realize that they released 2.0 in december ... 
  well at least she seems to be one of the leftists honest enough to voice their ( shitty ) opinions on record and , instead of yelling `` no cameras '' or hiding behind a mask ... well , who knows , `` revolutionary left '' seems like something directly ou of antifa . 
   am i missing something ? 
  yes , you are . 
   i see over 200k damage bb games posted all the time from good players, 
  wg looked at how the average potato plays bbs and decided that not only good players deserve 200k + games , but potatos too . 
  to get a 200k game you have to have a decent amount of skill , know the maps , have high level of awareness , positioning , know your targets , pick your shots . 
  in conq , you spam he ... at any range , at any angle .
