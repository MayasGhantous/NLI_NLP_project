  there are a few exceptions ( and i like them very much , me trilogy for example ) , but most stories in games just suck . 
  whatching a shitty , overdone , unskippable story cinematic in a game i otherwise enjoy is one of the most frustrating experiences in gaming . 
  holy jesus !, 
  ** what is that ? 
  ** indeed !, 
  why does it look far worse than the first presentation ? 
  never mind ... * sigh *, 
  yep and it 's apparently ps4 . 
  what ? 
  the amout of memory new systems have is going to do precisely that !, 
  `` your friend '', 
  dude , you ask for a source and 15 hours later , there 's still no link ... reddit these days , man . 
   also was n't he part of that bf4 video payment from ea to some youtubers to hide the bugs of bf4 ? 
  yes , it was . 
  they were free to discuss/critique the game , but they could n't show any bugs . 
  most of them ( and we 're talking at least levelcap , jackfrags and russian badger ) just glossed over the issues with naughty words like `` alpha '' and `` beta '' . 
  you have to admit that the guy is a bit too much comfortable with taking compensation , promo items ( and codes ) and other stuff ( i 'm not saying he 's alone ) also those co-promoted streams with bf community managers etc. 
  do n't really improve that view ... he 's definitely no totalbiscuit, 
  i 'm quite sure there is a very positive `` relationship '' between jackfrags and ea . 
  big battlefield youtubers are mostly just promo-proxies of big companies . 
  do you even remember the last time any of them was like `` meh '' i do n't like this , this and that ? 
  they 're ** always ** positive . 
  at least initially ( when it matters the most ) . 
  you can see it again with bf : hardline . 
  jackfrags , levelcap , xfactor , they 're all promoting the thing like it 's just rainbows and happiness . 
  `` they listen to us so much , they 're taking notes , we had a blast '' yada yada yada . ^ * sponsored ^ by ^ ea ^ ronku, 
  i knew it !, 
  i 'm never going outside again , i do n't want to lose my soul . 
  i 've got shit :d bf4 premium 450 hours . . 
  i guess it 's random . 
  lol but but destiny is the game changer !!, 
  mexican origin through vpn to the rescue . . 
   terrorism, 
  k. * sigh *, 
  hmm , i thought they already did that with bf4 . 
   it comes not from a business perspective, 
  i stopped there . 
  then again , bf4 got significant fixes ( i.e. 
  cte netcode update ) after like 8 months . 
   every single thread which is either sceptical on constructively negative gets downvoted . 
  the sad part is that it works like this in every single game subreddit , at least until release . 
  this one is just one of them ( the amount of blind optimism is suprising , given how bf4 has turned out ) . 
  but it could be worse ... i backed star citizen by $ 250 , i 'm very much optimistic about it , however the amount of unhealthy fanboyism found on r/starcitizen is staggering to me . 
  it 's like very few people even know what `` trust , but verify '' means and any , even partially negative , post gets downvoted into oblivion . 
  there a few things the reddit upvote system is n't great at and product-based subreddits are one of them . 
  choice-supportive bias is a bitch . 
  this promo fucking bullshit gets on my nerves . 
  just add the fucking thing into the accounts of people you deem worthy and do n't mess around . 
  you 're acting like hardline is some second coming of jesus when it 's a rehash on the same engine , a rehash you 'll be trying to sell for $ 70 . 
  sorry but that whole wall of text was for nothing , because you undermine your arguments by using the typical `` people do n't know how complex . . '' bs , and by ending with `` config file '' when it was stated by the cte devs the 30 tick-rate is very much hardcoded into the frostbite engine . 
  ( go look it up . ) . 
  nobody is saying it wo n't be hard and pricey to redesign the online networking around 60 tickrate ( that 's why i wrote that it 's too late now ) , but stating that hit detection is ok is just taking the piss . 
  i do n't know if you ca n't use youtube or what , but it 's full with netcode bs . 
  even from hardline . 
   it 's a themed re-skin of battlefield 4 without tanks and it 's basically being used to replace medal of honor until battlefront comes out . 
  and it costs $ 70 . 
  no , the whole point of these events is to get their game promoted by battlefield-related channels . 
  hence the ea ronku program . 
  i do n't do consoles . 
  but thanks for asking . 
  omfg, 
  no way i 'm gon na beg . 
  ea can keep it :p, 
  i will try it . 
  when the time comes . 
  being present on this sub does n't mean i have to be in the beta . 
  2477 citizens fighting with molested controls ... gg, 
  well , it 's from xbox , of course it 's potato quality . 
  lol !, 
  the most expensive mod ever . 
  anyone that buys it , unless he happens to genuinely enjoy the beta ( for what it is right now ) , is a fucking dummie and deserves ea wiping their ass with him . 
  even though i 've never played wow , i did play lineage 2 back in the day ( c4 to interlude ) and it may seem contra-productive at first , but the `` boredom '' of mindless grinding was actually quite good for the community . 
  all the drama of open pvp ( with reasonable consequences for pk ) also added to the experience as groups of people would stick together much more than in other games . 
  it was very much helpful to have friends in the game . 
  there was also quite a bit of downtime - waiting in towns , for a raid , trading and such , and all this while making for a bit dull game made an excellent basis for making new friends . 
  the whole thing was almost like a canvas for a social experience rather than a proper , fun gameplay experience . 
  at the time , i loved it without even knowing why ... looking back , it was 99 % about the community . 
  yep , that is my general feeling too and it seems weird to me , because mmos should be as much about a social experience as they should be about gameplay ( [ previous post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/287dc9/its_been_so_long_since_ive_made_some_genuine/ci89kix ) ) . 
  there is zero reason for you to play mmorpgs unless you want to engage in some form of deeper community interaction , simply because there are dozens of ( traditional sp/mp ) games on the market right now that contain infinitely more refined gameplay elements and minute-to-minute enjoyment . 
  i do n't really recommend witcher 1 in this day and age . 
  witcher 2 , on the other hand , is awesome and looks great ... so go for it . 
  fuck no . 
  the current controls are retarded and , more to the point , not as advertised ( 6dof ) ... the fact that you like the controls does n't mean they 're ok , it just means that you do n't know what the hell you are talking about . 
  apparently , it also runs better ... 
  also posted [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/28a5jg/battlefield_hardline_may_worsen_eas_problems_with/ ) ( much bigger thread ) . 
  as for the article , :, 
   but comparing the yearly releases of each series , battlefield is now the one that increasingly feels like a rushed , tweaked clone of the last version while cod is making a bit more of an effort to branch out . 
  this seems very much true at the moment . 
  it saddens me to say , but i may buy the next call of duty game instead of the next battlefield game . 
  lol, 
   it can be a yellow card, 
  he headbutted the guy . . yellow card ? 
  u mad ? 
  comedy gold . 
  hot dog, 
  the missions and storytelling is not what this game is about , if you 're seeking great storytelling and interesting main missions , look elsewhere . 
  this game is all about mindless fun in open spaces ( you can navigate very quickly thanks to the grappling hook ) , causing mayhem and all sorts of destruction . 
  indeed !, 
  that was amazing second half . 
  but but but dice were testing it irl and it fired at 650rpm !!,
