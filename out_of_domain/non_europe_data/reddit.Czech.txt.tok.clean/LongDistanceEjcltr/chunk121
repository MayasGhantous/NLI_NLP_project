  not saying i agree with it , but it is a legally grey area , theoretically companies can do whatever the fuck they like with let 's plays . 
  this is why licenses exist . 
  this really needs to go to court and be handled . 
  it would help everyone . 
  i really doubt that let 's play 's are * not * fair use , as one of the hallmarks of fair use is that it does not compete with the original 's market postion and proving that a commentary or a let 's play with commentary somehow competes with a video game is shaky to say the least . 
  they 're different forms of entertainment , one player 's `` let 's play '' is an instance of someone playing a game , that is transformative ** by definition ** . 
  but i 'm not a lawyer . 
  the case may lose and a `` let 's play '' may not be considered within the limits of fair use . 
  ** good ** . 
  this would force companies to issue special licenses intended to allow streaming and capturing of their games or they 'd face dying in obscurity . 
  honestly , it would be a great success for gaming entertainment as a whole . 
  this should be totally possible to do . 
  with fucking torpedoes where the other side has a chance to do something . 
  i have a feeling that wg is again lowering the skill floor so even noobs can get high damage numbers , just like with the rn battleships . 
   i 'm not sure what they 'll do, 
  whatever you do , do n't let the gremlin near water ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnwb4eqqbi ( and yes , this is a shameless repost from / r/joerogan ), 
  and he has never accepted responsibility for it . 
  even these days he 's still claiming that [ people 's expectations were too high ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d4tohhsxy-8 ) . 
  you know those moments when joe mentions some random factoid he mentioned 20 times before and you start rolling your eyes ... 
  this is what you get on a leftist infested sub . 
  everything is trump 's fault and if it 's not directly then indirectly `` in the age of trump '' , `` under the current administration '' etc. 
  capitalism is the worst of all evils . 
  cop hate is exceptionally popular and literal terrorists get more sympathy here than cops who did something wrong or dumb . 
  oh boy , a topic upvoted by all the bb potatoes ... of course . 
   instead of fixing their shit to become profitable, 
  the `` adpocalypse '' and the popularization of things like adnauseam made sure that there 's less ad money in the system as a whole . 
  the rumors i keep hearing is that all the apolitical channels who get demonetized/limited are a result of advertisers being a lot more picky - the age of broad , general ads being server on the entire platform may be over . 
  as youtube is not a profitable company , subscription based models are something we can definitely expect being pushed a lot . 
   when the game starts and you are the only battleship on the team, 
  which game are you talking about ? 
  true , but i 'm enjoying what i 'm seeing !, 
  that was a tank doing what tanks do . 
  a tank with unlimited gas tank . 
  bring on the peds !, 
  take whatever andrade 's juicing on and make it a mandatory `` supplement '' to all ufc fighters . 
  it says a lot about wargaming as a developer . 
  to quote flamu :, 
   game starting to have some spicy meme potential . 
  t10 , where the best dd is a cruiser , the best cruiser is a bb and cvs are n't allowed . 
  i 've always found this argument to be a weak one . 
  yes , you watch ads in the cinema , but you watch them * before * the movie . 
  and you have trailers mixed in . 
  and you can come late and skip the ads entirely . 
  that is so soo sooo not comparable to any ads * during * the movie . 
  i pay for amazon prime , go to the cinema regularly and pirate the rest ( mainly because czech republic has laggy distribution and i have no patience ) . 
  at this point of my life i ca n't imagine watching anything that has ads in the middle . 
  i accidentally joined defuse instead of domination . 
  said `` whatever , not my cup of tea , but i 'll try this again '' to myself , waited a bit , 6th out of 6 rounds starts and i get killed in the first firefight . 
  match then ends . 
  now , this is not the fun part , the fun part is that my previous three matches were 18-5 , 11-4 , 22-8 and the net skill gain from these was ... +28 . 
  soo , yeah , the change from bf3 was totally worth it !, 
  ( not to mention that if you ptfo , your skill stat is probably going to suffer , especially on high-risk , low-reward modes like rush . ), 
  tl ; dr : skill stat sucks, 
  how come ? 
  so either dao-12 is a flat out upgrade of dbv-12 or [ the symthic stats ] ( http://symthic.com/bf4-shotgun-stats?p=stats ) are incorrect ? 
  dao-12 :, 
  * 220 rpm, 
  * 12 round mag, 
  * 1.35 x first shot recoil, 
  * 0.48 spread increase per shot, 
  dvb-12 :, 
  * 200 rpm, 
  * 11 round mag, 
  * 1.8 x first shot recoil, 
  * 0.6 spread increase per shot, 
  the mode is a smash hit !, 
  afaik this did not happen . 
  second assault is a carbon copy of the ( now several months old ) xbox one version , including all the bugs and issues , naval assault is just around the corner and seems to be [ on track ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1z8zko/possible_release_date_of_other_dlcs_shitty/ ) . 
  soo , was that public announcement just another ea lie ? 
  e3 is coming . 
  they 'll make pretty trailers . 
  they 'll tell us that the netcode has been rewritten from scratch . 
  they 'll speak of learning their lesson . 
  they 'll present engine upgrades and lots of shiny things . 
  do not believe anything but hard evidence and post-release community reactions . 
  help the franchise , do not pre-order !, 
  mice vs controllers . 
   parsons also said creating and releasing a pc version of bungie 's shared world shooter would not be as easy as many believe , because all versions of the game connect to the same persistent video game world , which itself extends to multiple platforms . 
  `` it is not nearly as simple as you think , '' he said . 
  `` it is one central world no matter what the platform , and so that requires lots of intensive thought .

  or just not that much fun ? 
  not the second coming of jesus everyone here seems to be awaiting ? 
  buyer 's remorse bricks would be shat . 
  thousands of choice-supportive bias posts about software development made . 
  seeing the current state of the community , my early $ 250 backing would be almost worth it . 
  let 's be honest here , nobody cares about the singleplayer . 
  or - to rephrase that - nobody will judge the success of the next battlefield game based on its singleplayer strengths . 
  so , there 's conflicting informations out there - who is really in charge of the multiplayer ? 
  visceral ? 
  dice la ?

  of course it 's too late to do that now , but why did n't they do it when they had the chance ? 
  it 's not like we 're talking about some `` controversial '' feature in battlefield that some people may and some may not like ... battlefield 's hit registration is objectively bad , or at least sub-par . 
  why bring that baggage with you ? 
  i know they may not want to shit on frostbite engineers and scrap the whole thing , but we 're talking about the future of the battlefield franchise here . 
  i would think even ea would like their games to be as good as possible , given the time and resources . 
  and it 's not just hit registration , it 's about the continuous problems with frostbite 's server-side , 8 months after the release of bf4 and the server application still has terrible issues with running for prolonged periods , needing frequent restarts and making the whole thing incredibly inconsistent ( which is the worst part ) .
