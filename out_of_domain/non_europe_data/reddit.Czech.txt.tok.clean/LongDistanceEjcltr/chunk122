  i. . just do n't understand . 
  every reaction to bf hardline beta and every video has that `` pre-cte netcode '' stench attached to it . 
  i ca n't imagine this is what ea considers good promotion of the game . 
  i would expect better , especially for $ 70 . 
  edit : since there seems to be some confusion about who is making the multiplayer - it 's visceral , with dice la helping out , but visceral is having the control ( creative direction and game design ) . 
  it has been stated ( oficially ) numerous times , even [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/bf_hardline/comments/26vig3/so_who_is_working_on_the_multiplayer/chvacba ) . 
  seriously . 
  how do you feel about this ? 
  my reaction : :(, 
   saying ` gamers are dead ' is more click bait bullshit . 
  goodness can we please reexamine my idea of kickstarting a game journo site now ?!? 
   reward writers who write/report the way you demand/respect with your time and clicks ( without an ad blocker ) . 
  fuck the rest . 
  my 2 cents  . 
   agree w/many of the gamergate ` demands ' but best thing gamers who hate certain sites can do is stop going to them.enuff agree & they go under .

  btw i 'm not pushing it into more popular subs , it 's not guaranteed to get traction and i do n't really seek to get banned . 
  not yet anyway . 
  edit # 3 : http://np.reddit.com/r/games/comments/2fqixc/gamergate_reddit_admins_outed_as_corrupt/ thread has been soft banned , u/forestl denies allegations and * says * that he 's happy to answer questions . 
  be honest . 
  i 'm guilty of saying things like `` diced '' , `` it 's magic '' , `` netcode sucks '' etc. , yet , i still have 650 hours of play time , i play cte and give feedback regularly and i generally care about the battlefield brand . 
  bf4 is one of my most favorite games all year ( or overall ever since i left bf3 ) . 
  i love it for its variety and all the ways you can play . 
  i complain because i care . 
  what 's your excuse ? 
  ps : david sirland & co , i love you :p, 
  a playground for a few people to skew the game design so the air is untouchable . 
  if you enjoy mixed combat i suggest you enjoy the fun while it lasts . 
  once the heli physics patch hits , the fun ends . 
  you just went to google and searched for `` disabled charity '' and picked the first thing or what ? 
  one look at their twitter account is all it took to realize what 's going on and that it may not be exactly the brightest idea to pick that charity . 
  this is exactly the kind of amateurism that gets in the way and it starts to get annoying to be honest . 
  now half the new posts here are about them , about their refusal , about their twitter history , about their ddos ( does n't matter if it 's fake or not or if it 's done by misguided gg supporters or anti-gg people - it 's a good material for anti-gg , since now they can claim that gg is harassing a charity for disabled people ) . 
  fucking hell , people . 
  do your research first . 
  i was all for that xxx stream , but now i agree with the naysayers , it was a bad idea because you apparently ca n't expect that people wo n't fuck it up somehow . 
  maybe it 's time to get real and stop with the gaben worship . 
  edit : http://nichegamer.net/2014/12/what-will-valve-do-with-hatred-now-its-on-steam-greenlight/ that is fucked up . 
  fuck you valve , fuck you . 
  so , where are all those game `` journalists '' and bloggers who screamed `` artistic integrity '' at the top of their lungs when mass effect fans wanted a satisfying end to the trilogy ? 
  given steam 's monopoly , the ban of the hatred game for nothing else than daring to be politically incorrect is nothing short of censorship . 
  i see that the same bloggers who were on the bioware apologist train are now taking the moral high ground and most of them seem to be very much ok with the valve 's cop out . 
  ** so , are the video games art or not ? 
  like i 've been saying for a while now , the the game is being balanced on the basis of whines of a few bad pilots . 
  further proof just hit . 
  cte is dead as is the game . 
  am i the only one who finds this ironic ? 
  they first give us the railgun ( granted , only on the final stand maps ) and then nerf the sraw ? 
  i need some heli pros input here , how they see the railgun , but the last time i played the game i camped the railgun spawn location and since they massively decreased the battle pickup respawn time ( what is it now , 60 seconds instead of 5mins ? ), 
  i was having a field day with it . 
  on hammerhead , i managed to snipe out three jet pilots and took down several helis . 
  now this was easy . 
  i was able to severely limit enemy air presence in a huge radius around the railgun spawn just by myself . 
  their air was basically erased from d and f flags . 
  the same guys who brought us this puppy then nerf the sraw ? 
  i do n't know , but the railgun , at least from my experience , seems to be an order of magnitude more powerful because of its instant travel time . 
  this post is a reaction to [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/2su3uy/kotaku_writes_the_same_article_about_project_cars/ ) . 
  https://archive.today/ibyis :, 
   pretend race cars is an arrogant , self-centered , pessimistic view of virtual auto racing . 
  part satire , part tabloid journalism , and lacking any respect for the individuals who pour years into creating these games for others to enjoy , prc blurs the line between angry forum posts and hastily-written blog entries . 
  it this what the sub is now about ? 
  we snicker at `` gaem jurnalizm '' , we demand disclosures and journalism ethics , less yellow journalism in general and then promote that kind of blog ? 
  can you see how hypocritical that is ? 
  not to mention that the op is also the author of the blog post and has a history of animosity against project cars . 
  most of the posts in that thread are about how project cars was/is/will be a terrible game and how bad it was/is/will be looking instead of talking about kotaku or kotaku 's possible undisclosed ties to the game 's publisher/pr , namco ( e.g. 
  undisclosed paid promotion ) . 
  [ how every company in america can save 23 % on wages ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdj_bn0l8xm ) . 
  due to the rules of this sub , i can not link to the thread , but it had 200 + upvotes ( 85 % ) and 95 comments , before it got removed . 
  the stated reason for removing it is that it 's `` political '' . 
  that sounds like serious bs to me , the video itself only states facts with occasional comedic elements mixed in . 
  to the people not familiar with battlefield , the guy is responsible for bf4 ( executive producer ) and its dreadful release , made a lot of promises and said a lot of lies and then * completely * disappeared for a year and half ( his entire online presence vanished ) after making bank on selling ea stock just before the bf4 release . 
  dice la had to come in and fix the mess of a game dice stockholm made , and actually they 're fixing it to this very day !, 
  i see quite a bit of `` circlejerk '' and `` do n't hate '' posts popping up , complaining about the general negativity of the community ... while not everything is valid criticism , ** there is a very valid reason for the negativity ** . 
  learn from history , people . 
  you read that right , his negative feedback causes ** offence ** and ** upset ** . 
  keep in mind this guy spent thousands of dollars believing in the project and has a lot to lose , since if sms decided to ban him , they would just do a refund and he will get none of the profits ( i.e. 
  this is not a random hater with nothing better to do than piss on the game ) . 
  there were quite a few `` interesting '' bannings already , but this is the first time i see them targeting a member who 's just posting bugs and feedback ( even though negative , it 's all in a semi-professional , respectful fashion ) . 
  again we have [ these ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/381367/serious_anyone_else_noticing_more_kill_trading/ ) [ threads ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/382578/spring_patch_has_made_dusting_atrociously_common/ ) popping up ... 
  it 's obvious that doing step 2 ( 60 + tick ) without having the step 1 in place ( server performance profiling ) is not something that will end well , as you state yourself :, 
   for high tickrate servers to be viable in the near future -- we need to have a really solid reporting/status layer on the client , so this is very important to get right , and as quickly as possible . 
  absolutely . 
  but even if we do n't have high tickrate servers , we still need that status layer . 
  and we need it bad . 
  to be honest , it looks like many , if not most , retail pc servers run on a crappy server hardware ( or one with a dozen of vms ) , and i bet the console servers are n't much better , if at all . 
  that , or your server app has * serious * performance issues when under load for a longer period time . 
  time and time again , i see near perfect hitreg on a 64p cte server only to get back to retail with the next big patch and see the mess of dying behind corners , seeing damage bundles , dusting etc. 
  those latest cte server perf icons are nice , a good start , but we need a bit more information about the server ( and by `` we '' , i mean the typical users ; not us testers here , messing with the network perf overlay ) and it should be delivered as soon as possible . 
  next retail patch must contain this , it should be priority number one ( after showstopper bugs ) as it affects everything else and should have been done a long time ago . 
  without it , we 're just playing a game of whac-a-mole that has very little actual benefit for the retail game .
