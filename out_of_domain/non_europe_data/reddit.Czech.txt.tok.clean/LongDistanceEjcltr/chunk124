  the missile feels like it gets to the target faster , but offers less control overall , this is especially noticeable when you try to hit distant targets and need to make a small adjustment to the trajectory just before you hit or when you try to curve the missile to hit the tank at a medium distance in the ass ( which is no longer possible at higher angles , at least not in my testing ) . 
  analysis :, 
  maximum turn angle was decreased from 35 to 30 . 
  so the missile can now turn less when at the limit . 
  interestingly , minimum turn angle was changed from 0 to 2 . 
  what i 'm reading this like is that dice made the missile not react to input unless the the change in turn angle would result in a number higher than 2 . 
  meaning it 's not harder , but flat out impossible to make minute adjustments . 
  they also increased turn angle multiplier from 2 to 3 , which i interpret as a 50 % more sensitive reaction to your input ( when it 's calculated to be more than 2 degrees , otherwise it 's zero ) . 
  so , we have a missile that :, 
  * has twice as fast initial speed, 
  * has 20 % faster acceleration ( at least that 's what i interpret `` engine strength '' as ), 
  * has 14 % lower maximum turn angle, 
  * does n't react to inputs that would result in a turn angle lower than 2 degrees, 
  * reacts to inputs that would result in a turn angle higher than 2 degrees 50 % more sensitively, 
  i welcome comments , corrections and your opinions about the feeling of the new sraw ( based on your own testing ) . 
  i do n't know how long this has been going on since i did n't notice this on my home gaming desktop with a ssd ( for obvious reasons ) , but installing and uninstalling the game is ** an experience ** on any mechanical drive , especially on slower notebook drives . 
  i 'm 100 % sure this also affects load times very negatively . 
  why . 
  99 % of game engines out there use some form of paks for their game files . 
  this 150000 file nonsense is crazy . 
  how fucked am i ? 
  can i exchange the boss souls for weapons anywhere else ? 
  edit : all is good . 
  he dropped skull ring but respawned after i went away ( and died ) and got back . 
  i get it , this is a game 's subreddit and as usual on reddit , fandom 's off the charts , but i think it 's about damn time we had a discussion about console ports of mp games with trusted-client networking that are released completely unprepared for the wild west that is the pc platform . 
  750k of full priced copies sold on steam is a significant portion of ds3 's audience and the pc version should not be a second class citizen . 
  yes , it saves money and time because you do n't need anything more fancy [ than a trusted client network system ] on a console due to it being a closed platform , but the pc multiplayer becomes a nightmare as soon as a few weeks after the release . 
  what 's crazy is that you do n't even need some fancy , hard to use , purpose-made apps like you need for most server-authoritative games ( csgo , battlefield etc. 
  ) , a simple cheat tool will suffice . 
  cheat engine is a general purpose cheating tool that just scans the process memory and allows you to find and change values ( and use scripts - either your own or downloaded ones ) . 
  this is no complex software and exists for like a decade , so it reflects on you very poorly if your client side protection of a multiplayer game is so weak that cheat engine works . 
  but , ** the fact that you can ruin someone else 's entire game merely by connecting to them is , metaphorically speaking , a criminal oversight ** on the side of the developer . 
  [ this bastard script kiddie ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/4h4z6q/psa_if_you_get_invaded_by_malcolm_reynolds/ ) streaming the results and feeding off the attention is just a natural conclusion of this whole fiasco . 
  all these triggered bans are 100 % from software 's fault and anyone who gets banned because of this should be able to ask for a refund and more .

  well , we have n't heard that one before . 
  i love how all these `` battlefield fans '' ( most of which do n't like the last 3 or 4 battlefield games ) suddenly came out of the woodwork and are jizzing over the mere whiff of ww1 . 
  ** who the fuck cares about a ww1 battlefield game ?!? ** . 
  is this some weird mix of `` i 'm bored of futuristic shooters '' crowd that just blindly jumps on a new bandwagon ... or what ? 
  do n't tell me ww1 setting makes for a good ( main line ) battlefield game . 
  the combined warfare of ww1 either sucked balls or did n't exist at all ( depending on which year you choose to set the game in ) . 
  ** crappy weapons . 
  crappy , slow planes . 
  no helicopters . 
  crappy , slow transport vehicles . 
  ** whoever wants this in the next battlefield game is fucking nuts . 
  that is all . 
  right ?? 
  ( please , say yes . ), 
  the stupid thing basically occurs in half the matches ... maybe more . 
  4m30s into the last game the cyclone started and lasted for 7 + minutes ... effectively half the game being spent in cyclone . 
  other games were n't much better . 
  i mean , it 's nice to see this once in a while ( e.g. 
  once per 10 matches or so ) , but it gets old real fast .

  it was fine until the `` jihadist leanings '' fbi statement ... gee , i wonder what happened ? 
  probably just me seeing things that are not there . 
  yeah .

  admins manipulating upvotes ? 
  an attempt to prevent / the_donald posts from reaching / all ? 
  edit 1 : this may be some form of caching issue due to increased traffic , but it 's unlikely . 
  27,963 people are currently browsing the_donald , but 38,814 / news and / news has no issues with voting . 
  edit 2 : admins have put / askreddit to / all as the thread for the shooting now . 
  it just popped out of nowhere . 
  the_donald upvote situation persists , no new posts can be upvoted . 
  i genuinely do not understand . 
  you have a shooter in a gun-free zone . 
  people could not defend themselves because they had no guns . 
  the only thing that stopped this from being a slaughter of 300 people instead of `` just '' 50 were other people with guns . 
  is n't the issue with gun-free zones and ( the lack of ) security in such places instead of the guns themselves ? 
  how the unavailability of guns helped with what happened in france ? 
  gun-free zones are clearly the best mass shooter 's shooting ranges , how about solving that problem ? 
  and more on the guns , because the suspect had been cleared after being interviewed by the fbi , it allowed him to legally obtain a glock handgun and an ar-15 rifle . 
  he had been employed as an armed security officer by the g4s security services firm ( since september 10th , 2007 ) . 
   `` mateen underwent company screening and background checks when he was recruited in 2007 and the check revealed nothing of concern . 
  his screening was repeated in 2013 with no findings . 
   `` we are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities , including the fbi , as they conduct their investigations . 
  in 2013 , we learned that mateen had been questioned by the fbi but that the enquiries were subsequently closed . 
  we were not made aware of any alleged connections between mateen and terrorist activities , and were unaware of any further fbi investigations . 
  no amount of gun laws could have prevented what happened .

  how do you manage to make `` outrage porn '' about all ( even broadly ) anti-regressive things ? 
  is this the new tactic of the regressives ? 
  call any opposition to their idiotic regressive crap and sjw behavior `` outrage porn '' ? 
  `` nothing to see here guys , the academia is fine , campuses do n't have any problems , all these suspiciously regressive neo marxist ideas are fine , do n't be racist and shut up about it , mmmkay ? '', 
  dave rubin , milo yiannopoulos , christina hoff sommers , carl benjamin , gad saad , thunderfoot , sam harris , bill maher etc. 
  etc. , all of them are shills feeding on outrage porn . 
  not to mention that ** anti ** - outrage culture is at the core of a lot of these people 's work . 
  the gall of the people who create shit out of thin air with a clear goal to get their targets fired from work/banned on social media/ostracized by their peers ... calling something `` outrage porn '' ... amazing . 
  i have no words , but i think i 'm going to vomit . 
  and how in the fuck do you manage to make shitty journalism about / kotakuinaction , which has been originally created as a gamergate hub , gamergate which itself began because of the collusion of multiple gaming news sites and to this day is primarily about exposing and discussing crappy journalism and cronyism ? 
  there are days when i think the west is so far up its own ass that the only thing left for rational people is another world war that will hopefully reset all this idiocy . 
  this is one of those days . 
  that 's retarded .
