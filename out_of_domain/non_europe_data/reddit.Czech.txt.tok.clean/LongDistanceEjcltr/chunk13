  ! 111 demize said so !, 
  demize is my hero !, 
   650 rpm is consistent with our recordings . 
  nah , who am i kidding , i hate the guy . 
  word, 
  [ maybe they were ultra-high when making those claims ] ( https://twitter.com/shaunpeoples/status/479254149930840064 ) . 
  yeah :d john carmack was a tech director ( chief tech officer ) on id tech 5 , for example . 
  game engines these days are these massive , lumbering beasts so making engine design decisions usually is a full time job . 
  engine tech directors are usually the most experienced programmers that still may code a bit , but mostly they 're responsible for steering the ship , so to speak . 
  so . . `` captain '' is n't that far off , actually . 
  ubersampling is a cop out though . 
  it 's just native down-sampling , nothing more . 
  frostbite 3 and many other engines can also do that . 
  are those physx effects though ? 
  i thought the fur effects were supposed to be platform agnostic , implemented in directcompute ? 
  yup , found some [ evidence ] ( http://www.dsogaming.com/news/the-witcher-3-developer-its-up-to-nvidia-to-let-amd-users-enjoy-physx-hair-and-fur-effects/ ) . 
  [ nvidia says their hairworks does run on any directcompute-capable gpu ] ( http://physxinfo.com/news/12197/introducing-nvidia-hairworks-fur-and-hair-simulation-solution/ ) , so i 'd say that settles it then . 
  what you fail to realize is that people do n't watch because the game being played interests them , but because of the person playing the game . 
  this may be disputed in case of let 's plays ( continuous gameplay with sporadic or off topic commentary ) , but there is no question that heavily commented and/or edited reviews/first impressions/productions are being watched primarily because of the content creator and secondarily because of the game . 
  99 % of the success of pretty much all bigger youtube video game personalities is based on this fact . 
  pewdiepie or robbaz can play fucking tetris and no one will care as long as their commentary is entertaining enough for the target audience . 
  wanting to get a cut of their paycheck is merely not grasping this simple concept . 
  by far the worst battlefield game i 've ever played . 
  hardline is by far the worst battlefield game i 've ever played . 
  no amount of sp gameplay can fix that . 
  then you are a challenged individual . 
  how can you `` pass judgement on games that are the full experience '' unless you buy the game , at which point the passing of judgement is without any benefit ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  the beta is perfectly suitable for passing judgement on the most important factor - the core gameplay mechanics ... you know , the shooting . 
  and if that was n't enough , bf4 beta felt exactly the same as the final game - making the bf : hardline beta especially suitable as a demo . 
  by all accounts , something similar will happen with hardline . 
  netcode still going strong i see ... 
  no chance , i `` tested '' the game for half a year . 
  i want to pick the game mode i want , the map i want and the weapon i want ( and i 've already unlocked ) . 
  i have no time for trolling aound on a handful of half-empty bf test servers . 
  dice does n't deserve it . 
  ea sure as hell does n't deserve it . 
  why would i do it ? 
  the time for fixing has long past . 
  it 's all just too little too late . 
  i mean , they intend to start balancing rush now ? 
  while it 's better than nothing at all , i 'm not going to praise them for it . 
  have some consumer dignity for fuck sake . 
  and if you think that all the cte hoopla is to get bf4 fixed , you 're pretty naive . 
  it 's part pr move and part development for hardline . 
  yesss , england sucks :p, 
  gerrard is the second best uruguay player . 
  these cte update spams are getting annoying . 
  you smell that ? 
  yeah , that 's the smell of bullshit in the morning . 
  the only thing it needs to be truly magnificent is for bach to make an appearance and say something about magic . 
  go back to fishing and excercising shustybang , you have no time to be on the internet !, 
  good for you . 
  ( not sarcastic ), 
  i 'm with you on the rubbish part :p, 
  btw the ui graphics design is hideous . 
  are the icons and badges made by some 8 year old ? 
  the game will flop . 
  op is apparently new to battlefield . 
  they have issues with the server app to this very day !, 
  are n't they trying to fix server performance degradation ( the longer it runs without restart the worse the netcode and related systems get ) in the cte now ? 
  were n't there multiple bugs in the sound system that affected the whole server ( everyone losing audio etc. ) ? 
  him saying the issues were/are just client side is a lie . 
   german videogames magazine `` gamestar '' has reported, 
  i do n't speak german , but there seems to be some article like that !, 
  google translated the summary :, 
   after gamestar information the best-known german development studio crytek was in april of this year , shortly before the bankruptcy . 
  co-founder avni yerli says , further funding was secured - but for how long ? 
  some of the interesting content ( no spoilers ) :, 
  * ladder/wall/jump / swim animations ( including jump_landing_hard,

  * the engine uses [ apex destruction ] ( https://developer.nvidia.com/apex-destruction ), 
  * looks like there will be ~ 35 main story quests , ~ 30 large side story quests and a ton of small/community quests, 
  note : this is all subject to change , some of the docs are marked as deprecated and some look more like personal notes than some serious documentation . 
  incorrect . 
  hairworks is implemented by using directcompute api . 
  how well will it run on amd hardware , that 's a different question . 
  people do n't like anything that kills them . 
  if you happen to use anything else than a mid-range ar , you 're likely a shotgun noob , noobtuber , camping bitch or lmg spammer . 
  and yea , i said mid-range ar , since i see `` ace23 noob '' quite often . 
  you play with whatever the fuck you enjoy and is allowed . 
  they 're just mad you have killed them . 
   investitgate, 
  3 years . 
  yeah . 
  sure . 
  ea should make up their minds because their lies are getting a little bit too evident .
