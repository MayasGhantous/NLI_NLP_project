  the are only a handful of infantry players in the world with 6 + k/d . 
  heli whores on the other hand ... 
  i do that all the time . 
  spawn options . 
  i do n't give a shit about squad k/d . 
   kill the floor 2, 
  really ? 
  ign ca n't even get the name right . 
   malicious, 
  does n't matter . 
  `` studs-up '' sole-to-shin contact is an automatic red . 
  yep , sole-to-shin is often red card . 
  yey , nice to see some reasoning being used here ... 
  i agree . 
  it 's lupus . 
  lol . 
  so homefront is pretty much guaranteed to suck . 
  i ca n't imagine it being too great with these development conditions . 
  it is n't . 
  period . 
  i agree . 
  ( and i , for one , will be totally doing that - helping out smaller channels i like . ), 
  fucking sensationalist headlines again . . did anyone actually read that article ? 
   * the club has cracked down on coloured clothing , only allowing 1cm of coloured trim, 
   * tournament referee andrew jarrett sent a letter to players ** prior ** to the tournament , which read : `` undergarments that either are or can be visible during play ( including due to perspiration ) must also be completely white and contain no more than 1cm of coloured trim . '', 
   * some of the girls have been told to go back and change their bras and tops because they had slight colour on them, 
   * `` i believe some of the girls did n't have suitable sports bras and had to go without them '', 
  nobody forced them to do anything . 
  they were given the instructions prior to the tournament . 
  supports are playing the game just like you do . 
  expecting that someone will be running around with ammo boxes with the sole purpose of feeding their team with ammo is stupid . 
  when i play support , i drop ammo quite frequently but the primary reason i 'm playing is to a ) get kills , b ) do n't get killed . 
  like everyone else . 
  i can easily imagine that new players are too busy with not dying to care about some random dude that needs something . 
  and honestly `` chased some asshole around the map waiting for him to drop some ammo '' just shows that you do n't know what you 're doing . 
  next stop : modern gaming pc , 
  ... that does n't really hold 60fps :d, 
  i do n't have autoaim as you consolleros do , so i ca n't imagine i 'm too bad ... with 1.9 k/d that is :p, 
   simulator type war game, 
  lol, 
  you know me so well !, 
  do you want a cookie ? 
  positive discrimination . 
  i guess the reason they did that is to discourage the attackers from camping . 
  not that it 's going to work . 
  :d ( if someone knows the real reason , then let me know . ), 
  scrap the whole thing , start from scratch . 
  what ? 
  too much ? 
  * first : `` bf4 was much more similar to bf3 than hardline is to bf4 '' - what . 
  i suggest you revisit bf3 . 
  engine is different . 
  weapon handling is different ( you know , the most prominent feature of first person shooters - the gunplay ) . 
  the game feels different . 
  * second : hardline is like a $ 60 bad company 2 vietnam . 
  that is the vibe people are getting from it . 
  there you have your `` lol $ 60 dlc '', 
  * third : first few months of bf4 were an absolute fiasco . 
  people are tired of it . 
  hence the skepticism . 
   similar appearance, 
  i agree , but it is largely just about appearance ( even though you could make an argument about bf4 looking significantly better and less washed out than bf3 ) . 
  the core infantry gameplay is significantly different from bf3 . 
  some people like bf3 's infantry combat more , some do n't . 
  `` looks like fun . 
  will buy '' - retarded internet user, 
  no but seriously , i hope you played the beta and you liked it . 
  because if you 'll buy the game just because you saw some `` cool '' video , then you are a retard . 
  lol no . 
  i played it for [ ~ 6 hours ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1ljrxet.png ) ( 1.55 k/d ) and i totally agree with schimmi . 
  i do n't play ( competitive ) multiplayer games without dedicated servers . 
  no exceptions . 
  then there are the [ port issues ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/29bae4/so_plants_vs_zombies_garden_warfare_came_out_on/cij8ovk ) . 
  so , all in all , thanks , but no thanks . 
  welcome to the world of console crap without dedicated servers . 
  how do you know it 's fun ? 
  did you try it ? 
  if you did then by all means go for it ... 
  that is a fucking bad ass cat . 
  breed pls ? 
  it this a joke ? 
  i ca n't tell . 
  i hope it is . 
  ftfy . 
  this is what can happen when you put everything into the defense even though you lead by just one goal . 
  let 's be honest here , the second half was all about the netherlands . 
  afaik most of the `` improvements in quality of life '' with lobotomies were related to the level of external care required . 
  the people around the patient/victim . 
  lobotomy indeed makes you a vegetable ( whether this state is only temporary or permanent is not the point ) in the sense that you 're less of a bother to your surroundings . 
  i have no problems calling lobotomy a destruction of a human mind and , in some cases , essentially a murder . 
  we are walking brains , nothing more . 
  what more can you take from a man than himself ? 
  no , qa was ok , dice being lazy fucks just did n't care about those guys because [ fucking perfect netcode magic ] ( http://youtu.be/itehjxbphp8?t=2m22s ) was perfectly balanced and they did n't want to ruin the equilibrium of a perfect storm of their great ideas and flawless implementation . 
   makes it an better choice for long range combat than the mg4 . 
  sorry , but that is just not the case . 
  look , i 'm not a mlg pro so to speak ( :d ) , but i 'd say with 5000 mg4 kills and 500 aws kills ( 1.9 k/d overall ) , my opinion is quite educated . 
  and my opinion is , that when comparing the mg4 and aws , it largely comes down to preference anywhere but at range ( with one exception - at mid range , you 're going to able to continuously suppress people with the mg4 for far longer thanks to its 200 round belt ) . 
  at range , the mg4 beats the aws , hands down . 
  significant mg4 advantages are these :, 
  * mg4 's damage drop-off ends 18 % further,
