  jack 's bf4 content : ea ronku videos and overdone megalodon hunts ( and similar crap ) . 
  but i guess the channel has to keep pumping some bf4 content , even though the game is crap . 
  that 's bullshit comparison . 
  eve 's ships are points in 3d space , nothing more . 
  you move by using nav points etc. 
  you ca n't compare that with any game that uses any form of more advanced collisions ( or any collisions for that matter ) and/or direct control . 
  comparing eve multiplayer counts to something like battlefield is just ignorant ( or uneducated ) . 
  and i would expect better from r/pcmasterrace . 
  [ geomagnetic positioning ] ( http://www.dvice.com/archives/2012/07/geomagnetic_pos.php ) would most likely work even from the inside of the container . 
  ( the nuke would detonate as soon as the container arrived to the desired location . ), 
  [ ok ] ( http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dont_believe_you_anchorman.gif ) . 
  that 's because nobody wants to test a load of shit . 
  which is what fth servers are . 
  i guess you feed them to the birds ? 
  i heard these guys taste pretty bad though . 
  i did n't post a whole video , there 's a starting time included in the link . 
  plants `` eat '' carbon dioxide and water . 
  photons are just needed for photosynthesis to work . 
  i do n't . 
  steam support is ~ ~ horrible ~ ~ non-existent . 
  origin is better than steam in many ways . 
  including download speeds . 
  not to mention that you can try ea games before you buy them . 
  cte is making the game crap by listening to the biggest fanboys and employing people that evidently do n't know what the fuck are they doing . 
  rush is not better at all , weapons are now completely fucked - zero balance , enemies are fucking bullet sponges ( try to flank and kill more than two enemies with anything but a silenced lmg - you ca n't do it anymore , you either do n't have enough ammo or firepower ) , movement is fucked ( wohoo that dadada dancing is so much fun !!, 
  ) , 15165465465446th `` netcode upgrade '' and the game feels just as shit as it did two months ago ... etc. 
  go home dice la , you 're drunk . 
  the battlefield franchise if now fucked even more than it was . 
  that tiger is more valuable to earth than 1000 brazilians . 
  11 is enough to know what a fucking tiger is . 
  that child is most likely intellectually disabled . 
  what do 9 out of 10 people enjoy ? 
  10000 then ? 
  you 're fuck as fake !, 
  but you fuck ~ ~ your ~ ~ her fakes !, 
  quakefield 4 . 
  btw for any pump shotgun fans out there - say goodbye , because if the enemy knows what he 's doing , he 'll just tap left-right keys like mad and you wo n't hit shit ( and i 'm actually pretty sure that given the netcode you 'll be basing the aim of your shots purely on instinct and hope for the best ... ) . 
  close encounters are now based on mashing strafe keys and the person that does n't do that will lose . 
  90 % of the community will not like adadada dancing and i 'm pretty sure many wo n't like the amount of bullets needed at range too . 
  ucav = mortar shell with tiny wings . 
  you ca n't roadkill with it , it explodes on contact with the first object it hits . 
  source : 500 ucav kills . 
  edit : as others pointed out , you can technically roadkill with it , but it 's not something you 'd use given how it flies ( except for launching one directly behind someone 's butt , [ ra1der ] ( http://youtu.be/fhnqe2smyb0?t=3m10s ) style :d ) . 
  totally attack boats !, 
  they 're usually stacked and big/slow enough you can take them down . 
  also if you have n't already , edit your jet controls so pitch is at w/s and roll at a/d . 
  then also set up the mouse x axis to yaw and y axis to pitch for fine tuning your aim . 
  set up accelerate/decelerate to 4th and 5th mouse buttons ( or some other keyboard keys ) . 
  do n't forget the magic speed of ~ 320 when your turning circle is the smallest . 
  look around when preparing for a strafing run with right mouse button . 
  when you 're ready to start diving on a target , decelerate or you may not have enough time to dump the whole burst . 
  also , when/if you unlock hydra rockets , i recommend trying them out , i find them more versatile than laser guided . 
  i found it quite effective to start with the 30mm , they then pop active protection which will probably end right on time when you arrive with hydra rocket payload which will finish them off . 
  never had much success with laser guided : /, 
  yep . 
  they - for some reason - changed the strafing speed and , in a typical dice fashion , completely overdone it . 
  afaik the first patch had ** instant ** movement acceleration ( the maximum speed was the same as before ) and you can probably imagine what that did to strafing ( plus you could instantly change direction in full sprint ) . 
  they 're apparently lowering the acceleration in every patch , but yesterday 's patch was still a bit too much since you can still defend yourself very effectively by just mashing ad keys . 
  i agree and i 'm also not a huge fan of full rebalance of weapons and armor for the last dlc ... they should have kept it for the next title . 
  fixes yes , working on the map design , rush etc. 
  yes , but changing core gameplay stuff including movement speeds , time to kill and suppression etc. , why ? 
  ** nobody asked for this . 
  correct . 
  your `` friend '' is a dumb ass . 
  just fucking call the cops and be done with it . 
  trying to talk to such people instead of the cops , that 's the real wtf here . 
  dem boob physics . 
  why are you down-voted ? 
  it 's clear he tried to jump on top of that ramp and frostbite was not up to the task . 
  mind you this happens all the time , you just try again with a little different angle and it works ( `` parkour '' animation starts ) . 
  if that happened to me and i 'd know i jumped on that before , i 'd fucking rage quit . 
  that was perfect . 
  i bet you 'll love the new strafing speeds because it 's even harder to snipe now :p ( cte ), 
  you still need views for the ronku program , i think . 
  afaik they just give you a bit of money on top of the regular ad money ( up to a certain point ) , so it 's based on views . 
  it 's a [ network ] ( https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2737059?hl=en ) thing i.e. 
  i do n't think you can be part of it if you 're outside of something like polaris . 
  the problem is that you have one resource - the gpu . 
  you can either use it all for rendering or use part of it for physics at the cost of visual fidelity , framerate or both . 
  physics do n't really help to sell more copies , better looking graphics certainly do . 
  my point is , even though i 'm a huge fan of the red faction series ( blowing up walls in battlefield is fun too :p ) the last game pretty much tanked financially and the series is on ice . 
  i had tons of physics-based fun in armageddon , but it did n't help it sell more copies . 
  most games use physics for visual effects ( capes , cloth , particle effects ) and i guess gamers expect that these days and do n't pay too much attention to it . 
  there are very few games that use physics for enhancing the core gameplay , the only ones i can think of now is bf series , red faction series and maybe the new rainbow six .

  [ also may be relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4jojcdftbe ), 
  what 's the point of lan support if you still have the game server operating at 30hz ? 
  it totally does . 
  what * the hell * are you talking about ? 
  havok . 
   yeah , that does n't make it not covered by copyright . 
  screenshots of ( released ) games are generally considered fair use as copyright goes , especially when used in this context ( critique and reporting ) . 
  and context is very important here . 
  several factors are used when the court determines whether a reproduction is fair use , but these are the most relevant here :, 
  * ** the purpose and character of the use ** : reproduction for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , scholarship or research is not copyright infringement . 
  * ** the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ** : if the original is 10,000 pages , and the culprit reproduces one page , that is probably not infringement . 
  but , if the original is one page , and the culprit still reproduces one page , he has probably infringed on the copyright .
