  i 'm so glad those hacks over at rps got finally called out . 
  where are the results ? 
  i 'm not filling shit until you post a link to the results . 
  as far as rendering goes ? 
  yeah , one of the best . 
  animation systems also seem really nice ( do n't know how much of that is just ea 's deep pockets or if the engine [ helps a lot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhw5stcxbd4&amp;t=1m25s ) ) . 
  physics ... not so much . 
  just your generic havok implementation . 
  you get stuck on a lot of geometry edges , destruction is n't as dynamic as in bfbc2 etc. 
  the so called `` netcode '' part ( handling connections , synchronization of clients over network , frequency of server updates , server app stability ) is a total clusterfuck that is being `` fixed '' for almost a year and even current cte builds still have a lot of bugs in this regard ( there is an issue with headshots not registering , damage building up and being sent in one packet meaning instadeath etc. 
   weird stuff, 
  yeah , no kidding, 
  `` ln my experience , nick , lessons not learned in blood are soon forgotten . '', 
  great movie ( except the ending ) . 
  i have 60 + hours in cte and there is never more than 200 active players . 
  usually it 's around 100 during peak hours - one full cq server ( 64 ) , one almost empty cq server ( ~ 20 ) and one one full dom server ( 20 ) . 
  ( all terrirories . ), 
  i pretty much know a fair portion of them by name now . 
  play cte or wait for patch to reach vanilla . 
  i have a lot of performance issues with vanilla , most of them are gone now in current cte build . 
  do n't be a dumb ass . 
  one look at the forums and you would know that people are having performance issues they did n't have before . 
  i have similar issues after playing vanilla for almost 500 hours , the performance just went to shit after the last patch . 
  the funny thing is that the performance in cte is fine , so i guess my `` virus '' decided to only target one bf4 verson . 
  huh . 
  removed ??? 
  wtf . 
  in that case , that seems fair . 
  ( some of ) the admins are/were in on it and try/tried to silently suppress the spread of these exposing videos and articles by shadowbanning people ( by tens to hundreds ) , deleting comments or deleting whole threads . 
  there were also some valid moderation actions ( some people were spamming the same links on many different subreddits ) , but what i 'm talking about is en-masse bannings of comments containing nothing but an opinion ( no links , no names ) , deleting 20 + thousand comments in one thread and filtering new posts about the issue . 
  there is evidence that proves all of this , just use google . 
  btw even now r/games and r/gaming are being actively monitored for any activity relating to this whole ordeal and posts on the topic are being deleted . 
  #gamergate was ( / is ) trending on twitter big time ... yet not a single article or video about the issue was ( / is ) listed in the mentioned subs ( just for comparison , when one of the videos got posted to r/videos , it had 2510 upvotes ) . 
  ps : let 's hope i do n't get banned for this post , i try to support reddit by gilding regularly . . so fingers crossed, 
  bagel pls . 
  yeah , totally use flour !, 
  you do n't say . 
  and he [ got called out ] ( https://twitter.com/danielvavra/status/507856362756243456 ) by daniel vavra . 
  ( creative director of kingdom come : deliverance and both mafias . ), 
  yep , cp as in child pornography . 
  to paraphrase someone from twitter : `` burch , you have a fucking screw loose if you think anyone condones cp . '', 
  i 'm sorry , but you 're acting like this is something new . 
  they always had a very trigger-happy mods/admins/owners and they 're no reddit ( i.e. 
  site where the admins - for the most part - try to distance themselves from the content ) , they 're and they always were a private forum that does not even try to play by the the so-called `` freedom of speech '' book ... if * they do n't like you * for whatever reason , you * will be banned * . 
  they have some general rules , but they 're open to interpretation and/or extension ( i.e. 
  you can abide by the rules and still get banned ) and good luck with getting your account back . 
  escapist forums seem reasonable so maybe discuss it there . 
  could be . 
  i 've never used the site much , let alone visit forums . . but judging by this : http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.858347-zoe-quinn-and-the-surrounding-controversy they `` seem reasonable '' at least for now , and as far as this topic is concerned . 
  i do n't give a shit about 4chan . 
  that place does more harm that good . 
  hopefully not , lol . 
  this sub is small enough . 
  fingers crossed xd, 
  yep , just watched the stream and posted to r / games . 
  it did n't show up in `` new '' so it seems to be soft banned . 
  fitting user name :p, 
  do n't be a dick . 
  does n't have to be :p, 
  watch out scout pilots !, 
  ca n't wait to splatter some annoying flies with that x1 baby :p ; snowmobiles look like fun ; hover tanks seem very interesting ; not a fan of mkv, 
  oh it 's totally true . 
  well , of course it 's locked . 
  there is proof the admin does n't give a shit about the users . 
  there is proof the admin is an extremist and a hypocrite . 
  the mods either support him or do n't want to oppose him ( -  ban ) . 
  the only reason that topic was open in the first place was that it was meant to be an echo chamber of the admin/mods/sjw shitty opinions ( anyone who disagreed got banned ) . 
  the moment it stopped being beneficial to them ( i.e. 
  when a significant amount of people saw neogaf 's shenanigans for what they were ) , they closed it . 
  this is the reason why i 'm not active on any traditional forum . 
  too much power in the hands of too few people . 
  even reddit has a tendency to `` filter '' stuff , but compared to something like neogaf ... it 's a product of saints . 
   the definition of `` child pornography '' is codified in the law . 
  i suggest you get educated then . 
   if the ` big levolution ' is blowing up that c rooftop on that map then i 'm speechless . 
  it is . 
  nobody likes destiny . 
   you feel like you have enough space with 64 players and that is the point, 
  indeed !, 
  the only thing these big maps need is more transport vehicles ( snowmobile , atv ) . 
  so far , i really like it . 
   it does n't visually look like it has explosive rounds, 
  the explosions are invisible . 
  not kidding . 
  it will be fixed in the next patch . 
  then again , an apple will cost you [ two dollars ] ( http://thejapans.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p1190419-expensive-japanese-fruit.jpg ) or more ... 
  topkek, 
  1.7 k/d cheater ? 
  that 's sad , lol . 
  haha, 
  and japs kill them so they can make a big dick soup . 
  i 'll stay with that energy drink + vodka , thank you . 
  i recognize your effort !, 
  yes , that 's always the target, 
  server name ? 
  for ... science . 
  because people are done with 4chan 's anonymous bullshit . 
  random set of words on a shitty forum . 
  post some proof or fuck off . 
  this kind of stuff is what kills the whole thing ( gamergate ) .
