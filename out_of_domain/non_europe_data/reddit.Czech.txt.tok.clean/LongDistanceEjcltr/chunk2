  it can . 
  it wont . 
  dice is useless . 
  yeah , you 're welcome , lol . 
  most of that stems from the crappy `` netcode '' . . some obvious bugs are hilarious though ( tv missile health linked to gunner health ? 
  lmao ), 
  this acceptance of tens ( maybe hundreds ? ), 
  of serious bugs , lack of polish and general flakiness is sickening . 
  and you see this apologism everywhere , even here . 
  `` bruv i have no problems , do n't whine !, 
  '' , `` i 's a complex game ! '', 
  not `` only '' full price , but many people here paid upwards of $ 100 overall ( premium ) . . not to mention the xbone guys who paid $ 500 for the console and [ ca n't even play ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1ufb6y/this_has_been_my_bf4_experience_the_past_week_and/ ) :d, 
  perfect . 
  if somebody 's wondering , widgitybear : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ninlbrbtpsm, 
  are you kidding me ? 
  this game is out for ages and moreover - it 's free - but reddit just now randomly decides to go crazy about it ? 
  ( btw it 's quite good ), 
  iirc xboners have second assault since the end of october and the levels will be the same on pc/ps4 ... as in the dlc is basically a day one dlc - it has been `` finished '' for quite a while . 
  lol that 's just horrible :d no wonder ms started to refund ... ( btw i meant end of november , not october . ), 
  you ca n't have a great gaming experience if you get killed and lose matches constantly . 
  this is n't a co-op pve game . 
  i also like domination spawns in general . 
  like when you spawn < 10 meters in front of four enemy players or when you spawn , run < 10 meters , begin to engage the enemy , just to be shot in the back < 10 seconds later by a newly spawned enemy player that materialized pretty much on the same spot you did seconds ago ... 
  quite sad indeed . 
  instead of thinking how to incorporate realistic effects of these weapons into the game , we get a `` balanced '' version that has lower ttk than pretty much any assault rifle , even though the minigun fires 5 times as fast and the projectile has several times higher kinetic energy . 
  dicey i say . 
  happened to me twice already lol ... always installed it back after a few days :(, 
  more like 12.5 :p, 
  the simple fact of how ea handles the interaction with the bf community shows you how much they really care about the brand . 
  ace 23 domination borefest ... oh , my bad , since 120 tickets apparently equals gg , it 's over before it even begins :p, 
  yes , i agree . 
  especially given the vastly different level of competition in almost every other match . 
  i 'm just disappointed to see the stats getting worse than they were ( well , assist counts as kill is good , but other than that ... 
  i do n't know man ), 
  i do n't obsess over them , i 'm just trying to make a point . 
  if i did care about stats a lot , i 'd start playing with vehicles only . 
  besides good aim , you have to know the maps really , really well if you want to do ok in domination . 
  also , unlike in conquest , it 's not that easy to approach an area `` tactically '' or just choose a different area of the map to cap flags in , because there 's not that much room to maneuver and you have to be constantly ready to fire in any direction , nowhere is safe for long , especially thanks to the goofy respawn system . 
  i like fps , but i 've never played any game 's multiplayer too much ( maybe a bit of quake 3 back in the day ) , so i was pretty bad in bf4 at the beginning - 0.88 kdr after 300 kills , but now i have 1.5 kdr after 6000 kills . 
  if you like the game , you 'll keep coming back to it and you 'll get progressively better and better . 
  everyone starts as noob , there are just some bf/mp game veterans that own everyone from the start , because they have hundreds or thousands of hours under the belt from previous titles . 
  greaat shot recker !, 
  [ meanwhile at sony ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/1unl8k/after_quite_a_few_people_complained_about_soes/ ) . 
  mine/slam practical usage is ruined by mavs, 
  depends on the map . 
  on something like altai , i love zunis . 
  you can absolutely wreck groups of enemies hidden in those small wooden buildings , main tower etc. 
  that would otherwise tear you a new one with all the rpgs and sraws . 
  note : i use apfsds-t shells against armor plus i tend to generally stay the fuck out of mbts sight :d, 
  btw if you get close enough ( 100m ) , flares usually wo n't help and both heat seekers will hit . 
  hoooraaaaayy , community manager managed to show himself to the community !, 
  the problem is that it 's not only just a number no one cares about , but a number that is used by the matchmaking system ( iirc ) . 
  damn , i want to be as good as you . . 
  what ? 
  :d most pc game sales are digital , for years now . 
  get a grip dude ... 
  this is actually not that much ( for ea anyway ) . 
  it 's similar or lower than bf3 ( wiki : `` after one month , ea chief financial officer eric brown announced battlefield 3 had sold 8 million copies '' ) and you have to wonder how many copies needs a behemoth like bf4 to sell , if a comparatively much smaller game , dead space 3 , [ needed to sell 5 million copies ] ( http://www.cinemablend.com/games/ea-says-dead-space-3-has-sell-5-million-survive-43629.html ) just to be viable . 
  ea has huge marketing budgets and management overheads . 
  call of duty : modern warfare 3 - 29m, 
  call of duty : black ops ii - 25m, 
  call of duty : ghosts - 18m so far, 
  the level of interest is definitely waning . 
  really ? 
  you 're playing an extremely simplified , arcade military shooter game where almost every weapon , ammunition , health representation or physics in general do not match the real thing ... and a guy yelling `` congrats on the promotion man ! '', 
  is the thing that ruins the immersion ? 
  plus i do n't play on servers without spectator ( no way of catching cheaters ), 
  no one gives a shit . 
  most likely okay because of premium . 
  `` is n't allowed to use dlc weapons '' lol , those guys are hilarious, 
  advantages of ace 23 + none + none :, 
  ace 23 reloads 24 % faster when there is a bullet in the chamber, 
  ace 23 reloads 17 % faster when there 's no bullet in the chamber, 
  ace 23 has 16 % less upwards kick, 
  ace 23 has 40 % less kick to left, 
  ** ace 23 recovers 350 % faster from recoil ** ( wut ? ), 
  ace 23 has 20 % lower ads base spread, 
  spread increases 4 % less on ace 23 when shooting, 
  bagel wins the snorkeling contest :p, 
  this happens all the time with l96a1 . 
  the setup just wo n't permanently save ... 
  ... so i 've put stealth in your stealth so you can stealth while you stealth . 
  yes , if you want to run and gun `` extreme style '' , maybe . 
  it has 1000 rpm , true , but its pdw damage model makes it far worse than say aek in pretty much any case other than point blank range , because :, 
  * its lowest damage ( at 55m or more ) is 12dmg ( 9 shot kill ) , while aek 's is 18dmg ( 6 shot kill ), 
  * its bullet velocity ( 370m/s ) is way lower than aek 's bullet velocity ( 580m/s ), 
  * its left recoil is 50 % higher , and right recoil 27 % higher, 
  meaning you should n't even try to take down someone 40 , 50 meters away . 
  as many people pointed out before , the average engagement ranges seem to have been increased compared to bf3 , which means that on average , you 'll most likely get less kills with pdws than ars . 
  i have 600 + kills with cz-3a1 and it 's a fun weapon to use , do n't get me wrong , but i find myself playing more and more with aek ( and its peers ) since it 's still okay if you want to run and gun , but you also do n't feel defenseless against pretty much anyone that 's not directly in front of your face . 
  these are the same `` moral '' decisions that get you internet censorship [ etc. 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1uz7sb/uk_schools_fingerprinted_over_800k_children_third/ ) , all in the name of `` protecting the children '' ... in the end it 's just about control . 
  the sad part is that many people will believe the rhethoric and so the imaginary frog indeed gets boiled alive without even noticing . 
  any man that ca n't think for himself or says that some higher power gave him the right to do something ( and therefore it 's a `` right '' thing to do ) is a lesser being . 
  look at africa , they 're burining their neigbors because they think they 're witches , etc. 
  there are millions of examples in the world today . 
  anyone who describes the clusterfuck bf4 was/is as `` unrealistic expectations '' deserves a punch for being a dick . 
  this is not a free to play title , but a $ 60 + game ( $ 100 + for some ) . 
  you should definitely expect it to work as advertised . 
  just my two cents . .
