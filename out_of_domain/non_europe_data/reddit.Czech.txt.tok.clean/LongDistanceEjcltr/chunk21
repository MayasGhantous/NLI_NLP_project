  or server , which i said :p, 
  that 's exactly what many people were complaining about in the cte forums . 
  this kind of feedback was generally dismissed with `` learn to aim ''  ... make of that what you will . 
  three things from someone with some serious time in cte :, 
  * this promotes the use of high-rpm weapons . 
  that is especially true since weapons like famas and aek are more usable than ever because of the removed visual recoil and slightly reduced side-to-side recoil . 
  * three shot headshot is too much . 
  pretty much everyone wants 2 shot headshots back . 
  * while you can argue that higher ttk rewards skillful aim more , the game , thanks to the netcode , does not have significantly higher ttd , which , i 'd say , was the primary reasoning for nerfing the damage model in the first place . 
  op , you 're a dumbass . 
  well , i consider myself a fanboy of battlefield 4 , it would be hypocritical of me if i did n't say so after playing close to 700 hours . 
  but i also know the netcode is not perfect and it never will be perfect with 30 ticks and aggressive latency compensation policy ( so high-pingers can play ) ... and that average accuracy is like 10 % ... meaning it literally takes average people a mag to down an opponent at range . 
  sounds like shit . 
  if i was the cop , the fucker would either get tased immediatelly just for holding the knife or shot twice as soon as he moved a muscle . 
  you either do n't play cte much or you lie . 
  of course it exists in cte , many people reported it , including myself . 
  pre-patch : 3 slams killed a tank . 
  post-patch : 3 slams and a rpg kills a tank . 
  you ca n't place more than 3 ( * ) . 
  when you place the 4th one , the first one disappears . 
  * : see graphic-j 's post . 
  far fart fart, 
  sorry , i should have mentioned that ( kinda thought it was obvious ) , it 's cte . 
  did n't show his hands , appeared to be reaching for something , got shot . 
  seems pretty justified to me . 
  i suggest you watch the video again . 
  completely irrelevant . 
  does n't matter what we was actually doing , but what the cop could see him doing . 
  making a potentially dangerous move ( reaching for a gun or a knife ) . 
  the dude sticks his arms into his pants or under his shirt ( ca n't really see because the video is crappy ) , turns around and keeps walking backwards . 
  that 's not normal . 
  after four seconds of this , he starts to move his hands and the officer shoots . 
  also , they 're looking into the sun which did n't help things i 'm sure . 
  ** if the guy had a gun in his pants and the office did not shoot , he would get shot himself . 
  this retarded collective `` cop hate '' on reddit is annoying . 
  you can see the discussion is fucked when people start spewing nonsense like `` whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty '' in a shooting video . 
  yeah . 
  look at my post history , totally a `` defensive officer of the law '' . 
  more like a person with half a brain . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw1dsij5hec you can hide your cop-hating pitchforks for a while . 
   the police are not given the ability to kill someone based completely on something they perceive as potentially dangerous . 
  sure they are . 
  btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw1dsij5hec, 
  is this thread . 
  yeah , rough ... but better than a person with no brain . 
  i hope you 're kidding . 
  most likely cancer . 
  for the time . 
  it will come to the vanilla with next patches . 
  battle ( non ) sense did a video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3appc28c7m, 
  sigh ... * unzips *, 
   i havent had any action in about 6 months, 
  dammit , if i could just forget about sex for 6 months , my life would be so much easier . 
  slaves . 
  yeah , no . 
   he 's taking an approach of taking money away from the site by not going to the site , which is a fair approach . 
  except it does n't work . 
  these sites have hundreds of thousands if not millions of unique visitors each month , the fact that you stop visiting wo n't change anything and they 'll just keep doing what they 're doing . 
  by doing this , you 're essentially sticking your hand into the sand ... which would be ok , if the whole thing did n't start to leak everywhere else . 
  look at the fucking situation we 're in now , the `` ignore them and they 'll die '' attitude led us to this point . 
  half of the na gaming journalism is a sjw hivemind ( that not only writes bullshit articles , but also starts to incorporate their agenda into the reviews ) , it leaks into things like reddit , 4chan , github . 
  they have their own echo chamber conventions and festivals and they try to make such an echo chamber on the web by closing comments , discussions and banning anyone who disagrees with their pov . 
  no , the only thing you can do now is to call them out on their bullshit , use social media like fb and twitter to do it , discuss on streams and radios , make youtube videos , blogs . 
  write to the advertisers . 
  that is working . 
  * keep it random for semi-auto shotguns . 
  ( because you can spam them rather effectively and this keeps them in check . ), 
  * pumps however ** need ** to be a guaranteed kill if you hit dead center from a close distance . 
  there is no way around this , the weapon is useless if you have to deliver a second shot . 
  unlike with the semi-auto shotguns , you pretty much never have an opportunity to make follow up shots , so there has to be some reliability/consistency . 
  sure , it will never be perfect with the fb3 netcode , but as it is now , it unsuable . 
  i 'm honestly astonished dice thought it would be a good idea to put a random factor into the core mechanics of a competitive shooter . 
  this is usually a no-go for any game mechanic , because it makes it impossible to learn given mechanic , so the use of a random spread in a shotgun is wtf territory . 
  most expendable by far . 
  imagine you have a really bad cold with filled sinuses ... you ca n't smell anything but it 's merely an annoyance . 
  yep . 
   to us it actually feels normal . 
  yeah , mental illnesses often feel `` normal '' . 
  post video source !, 
  nobody fucking pulls the knife out before you get to the hospital . 
  you get on the operating table with it and the surgeon will try to pull it out and fix the damage without you bleeding to death . 
  op delivers !, 
  splendid . 
  i 'll wait for what they show at pax aus and if they keep disappointing me , at least i 'll have someone to sell my rear admiral lti to . 
  * slow progress , especially for a studio with 200 + employees . 
  you can say whatever the hell you want , but the ac as it is now is a ** tiny ** amount of progress for what has been almost 2 years . 
  * spending time on things like producing ship ads to get even more money instead of working the game . 
  * most importantly : i do n't like how ac feels . 
  when it was released , it felt terrible . 
  no 6dof ? 
  laggy controls ? 
  really ? 
  instantly getting to speed x while the speed x is very low overall . 
  incredibly powerful maneuvering thrusters that can stop you on a dime etc. 
  plus the awful missile locking animation over the whole screen , huge console-like ui elements etc. 
  pure disgust . 
  did n't check it out in few months and stopped posting on the forum . 
  i went from `` this sounds awesome '' to `` this will suck balls '' in a matter of an hour because the gameplay is trash . 
  edit : i totally plan to keep an eye on sc in the long run and i 'll probably buy it when it launches one day ( depending on the reactions ) . 
  it 's just that my current level of interest approaches zero .
