  well , we 're talking about unity here . 
  it 's easy to get into and kinda easy to work with , but that 's about it . 
  i call it the php of the game engine world :p ... 
  in the age when epic works on parallelizing even their render loop , unity has pretty much everything the engine does on one thread . 
  plus since the unity api is nts ( non-thread safe ) , you ca n't really do much with it in your multi-threaded scripts . 
  plus afaik the unity editor does n't even support 64-bit , meaning that if your game during development needs more than 32-bit can address ( which is about 3gigs of memory ) , you 're out of luck . 
  most of the stuff you mentioned i agree with , but that 's the asset optimization i was talking about . 
  not engine optimization . 
   just not giving a damn about performance during development, 
  yeah . 
  i love it . 
  the sheer determination of that team to fuck up the pc agenda is so refreshing to see . 
  plus , the music is awesome :p, 
   this seems like a 12 year old who knows how to slap a game together made it, 
  i see a ton of art assets , cinematics , great animations ( for what it is ) , destruction physics etc. 
  i think it 's actually you who is n't far from a 12 year old . 
  i 'd get bored to death after 10 ... 
   i remember reading a comment on here when this sub just started that was a long the lines of `` who cares if they control the media ? 
  we 'll still win !, 
  '' , and i just laughed and shook my head . 
  i do n't think it 's impossible to ` win ' , but when the other side has a stranglehold on the narrative it 's an uphill battle . 
  this is why i [ disagreed ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/2ib0o4/david_jaffe_go_to_therapy_to_figure_out_why_it/cl0o1kg ) with d. jaffe 's position that the best thing to do is to `` ignore , do n't visit , if enough people do the same , they 'll die '' and that it should not matter to you that some site writes stuff like `` gamers are dead '' . 
  this whole situation is as far from being able to fix itself as you can possibly get . 
  look at all that porn :p, 
  yeah , and with [ 1.6 million gg tweets and 160k nys tweets ] ( http://topsy.com/analytics?q1=%23gamergate&amp;q2=%23stopgamergate2014&amp;q3=%23notyourshield&amp;via=topsy ) , that is one hell of a conspiracy !, 
  lol, 
  yes , visual reaction time ... ~ 250ms is average for a young person ( e.g. 
  look the top of the bell curve [ here ] ( http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/leaderboard ) ) . 
  you can get better at it with practice , but not much ( professional players of twitch-based games will close in on 200ms or less ) . 
  of course your reaction time will also get lower with faster equipment . 
  as for the framerates ,, 
   the threshold of human visual perception varies depending on what is being measured . 
  when looking at a lighted display , people begin to notice a brief interruption of darkness if it is about 16 milliseconds or longer . 
  [ [ 1 ] ] observers can recall one specific image in an unbroken series of different images , each of which lasts as little as 13 milliseconds . 
  [ [ 2 ] ] when given very short single-millisecond visual stimulus people report a duration of between 100 ms and 400 ms due to persistence of vision in the visual cortex . 
  this may cause images perceived in this duration to appear as one stimulus , such as a 10 ms green flash of light immediately followed by a 10 ms red flash of light perceived as a single yellow flash of light . 
  [ [ 3 ] ] persistence of vision may also create an illusion of continuity , allowing a sequence of still images to give the impression of motion .

  whoa , that podcast is probably one of the best/most interesting podcasts i 've ever seen in my life ... 
  i mean , yeah , it 's almost 3 hours long and it delves into some mehtastic ( thankfully , quite short ) segments at times ( like brazilian jiu-jitsu ) , but man , that was amazing and quite enlightening . 
   mag boots ? 
  maybe battles on the hull of a ship ? 
  this is already present in the the arena commander ( mag boots / walking on hulls ) and afaik , battles on the hulls of the bigger ships is supposed to be a significant portion of the boarding mechanic ( do n't quote me on this though , i do n't remember everything c.r. 
  says :p ) . 
  yep , agreed . 
  that tweet is sexist and she shows her true colors , the colors of an extremist . 
  anyone who 's impartial in this will see that . 
  i say this awesome for us . 
  anita needs our support ? 
  are you fucking nuts boogie ? 
  why on earth would i support an extremist like that ? 
  i truly believe she is not a feminist , but a misandrist . 
  and i expect better from you . 
  far better . 
  if you know about this , then i 'm afraid we have to part ways because i can not support this . 
  harassed or not . 
  this is a feminist you should be supporting :, 
   i support her right to be safe from threats ; not safe from criticism . 
  her message is clear , she jumps on this moments after the tragedy happens . 
  what is that about ? 
  she has either a deep rooted hatred for men or she wants to bait people into harassing her so she can play the victim card again . 
  the `` hours of hate '' on twitter come from the timing , come from her lack of empathy . 
  this is the person boogie wants to support ? 
  she is free to say whatever she wants to say , we live in a free society . 
  but freedom of speech works both ways . 
  going into the threat territory is only making things worse , but you ca n't blame the majority for the actions of individuals . 
  does the preaching about harassment have any effect whatsoever on the actions of the people doing the harassment ? 
  i really do n't think it does . 
  it only makes us , the majority of people who do not do such things , more angry that we 're constantly being preached to and looked down on and it gets tiring real fast . 
   considering the amount of harassment people who associate themselves with that party deal to their opposers, 
  prove it . 
  prove that what you 're saying is true . 
  you have zero proof . 
  anyone can use the hashtag , hell , even anti-gamergate people use it . 
  prove that a significant percentage ( since that 's what you imply by saying `` the amount of '' ) of people who associate themselves with the gamergate `` movement '' or discussion around it in any meaningful way are harassing someone . 
  ( btw if you consider disagreeing with someone or calling out someone on their bullshit a `` harassment '' , then i guess you 're right , but you 're also nuts , so i 'm not sure your opinion matters . ), 
  the vast majority of harassment i see ** every day ** is coming from the anti-gg crowd . 
  holy shit dude , what morality are you talking about here ??? 
  my mind is honestly blown away by what kind of nonsense i 'm reading . 
  are you seriously comparing ridiculous statements and demands of a borderline [ psychotic ] ( https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/525781140943011841 ) , [ misandristic ] ( https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/525793436025118721 ) [ person ] ( https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/525834975942164482 ) ( and a [ professional ] ( https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/525781483915448320 ) [ victim ] ( https://twitter.com/femfreq/status/525850299487883264 ) ) to a consumer response to a factually and provably low quality ending of a long running series that , as part of its marketing , has been painted as something that it ultimately was n't ? 
  even when i forget that you 're talking about people like sarkeesian , it 's still mind boggling someone can say - with a straight face - that some moralist 's opinion is just as valuable as scientific proof . 
  the ending of mass effect 3 was deconstructed piece by piece from numerous angles and by dozens of people ( including some big names in the gaming space ) . 
  it boiled down to a-b-c/r-g-b illusion of choice that disregarded all the things you did in previous games . 
  despite the claims of ea and bioware that your decisions will absolutely matter in an epic finale . 
  people realized they were being lied to ( and let 's be absolutely clear here : the players were lied to , plain and simple ... regardless of whether you liked or hated the ending , the fact is that your decisions from the previous games did not matter at all and the decisions from me3 were reduced to a mere number in the end ) and that 's why they complained . 
   i generally trust the devs not to butcher their games to the point where they 're unprofitable, 
  ot : da3 will bomb ( at least as far as ea 's `` millions or bust '' product strategy is concerned ) and the series will get put to ice by ea . 
  it looks way too much like an mmo and it is n't innovative in any shape or form . 
  / i 'll get back to this post after the release and gloat about being right :p /, 
  no no , that was just an ot jab :p ; i 'm not commenting on `` taking on feedback '' at all here . 
  not necessary , you just need a social bubble and being highly impressionable . 
  she 'd better start to think , and fast . 
  your information is incomplete , the person sent ( or at least wanted to send ) cops to his home . 
  yep , it 's all in the open on twitter . 
  i 'm slowly starting to think that nintendo is preparing for their next console which may not be targeted to be so `` family friendly '' like it is now . 
  i mean , nintendo is not doing that good financially ( they lost $ 97m in the last quarter even with mario kart 8 ) , the novelty of wii control method is completely gone and very few people really care about wiiu ( 7 million consoles sold in two years , compare that to more than 10 million of ps4s in a year or 7 million of xbones in a year ) . 
  the thing that keeps nintendo within reasonable loss levels is the handheld market , but that market is also slowly but surely bleeding out as tablets and smartphones get better and more people get access to cheap devices with considerable power . 
  tl ; dr : it would appear that the family friendly image is not selling good enough anymore,
