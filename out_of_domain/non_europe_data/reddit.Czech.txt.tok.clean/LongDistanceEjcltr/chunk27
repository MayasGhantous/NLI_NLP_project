  so like battle pickups ? 
  this man is correct . 
  what people have to realize is that , regardless of your opinion about the difficulty of doing the required steps , this is the ** only ** achievement/easter egg that affects the game in a rather significant way . 
  i mean the reward is a brand new weapon that - as far as we know - ca n't be unlocked any other way !, 
  it 's not like we 're talking about some gold-plated aek that has the same stats as the regular one ... no , no , you get a ** new weapon ** that is completely ** different ** than any other weapon in the game . 
  i 'm totally fine with stuff like dinos and sharks and other easter eggs being hard to discover and/or solve , also i do n't mind some visual customization being gated this way , but putting the bow behind this ridiculous requirement that has ** nothing to do with any kind of regular gameplay ** is silly . 
  you might as well put it behind a paywall now . 
  there is one box . 
  when picked up , it respawns after 5 minutes in a random location ( picked from a number of possible locations ) . 
  4 people found them in a round the last time i played . 
  holy shit that is a * next level * troll from dice . 
  they fucking diced half of the core community . 
  cool , was just reading it :d btw what about linking to the video ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exrdllkfuog unconfirmed 8 should be confirmed now . 
  video is a pretty good proof . 
  edit : done . 
  what did you have equipped ? 
  i mean tags . 
  hmmm ... maybe you need to have the phantom program tags equipped to see the box ? 
  edit : never mind . 
  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/2mzagy/finding_dogtags_lets_figure_out_how_they_spawn/ disproved 3 ), 
  and your graphics settings ? 
  amazing !, 
  i unlocked it recently ... after a year of not giving a shit , because i knew i 'd hate to do it . 
  and i was right , it was one of my worst bf experiences . 
  ** fuck the guy who put that into the game . 
  somebody has to do it . 
  his channel is one of the handful larger ones that calls her out on her bullshit . 
  ( which is basically everything she produces , including her masters thesis , so there 's a lot of work . ), 
  or use https & google dns servers . 
  dutch sounds quite similar to english o_o ( at least to a czech person ), 
  germ-any . 
  nazism is outlawed in many democratic european countries . 
  radical islam is pretty much the same thing as nazism ( as far as its danger to society goes ) and should be treated as such . 
   according to the report , the main barrier to a wider adoption of insects as a food source , is cultural, 
  no , the the main barrier to a wider adoption of insects as a food source is that bugs [ taste like crap ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx7dn8diyxw ) . 
  that 's the point . 
  you do n't eat the cow whole , guts and all . 
  but you * do * eat the insects whole . 
  sure , most people fry them first , but that does n't change the fact that you 're eating the thing whole ( and i 'm willing to bet that if there was a way to remove the guts , brain , eyes etc. 
  the `` meat '' itself woud taste okay ) . 
  i see this being thrown around quite a lot but i never got on the multi-gpu train . 
  to be honest , sli/crossfire brings more issues than it is worth . 
  pretty much any brand new game does n't support sli at all or has some rendering issues because of it ( flickering shadows etc. ), 
  or worse still , some games have negative sli scaling and stuttering or crashing problems . 
  you usually have to wait for new drivers to come out or hope that the game gets patched . 
  and even if everything is working as intended , you 're still not guaranteed to have x amount of performance gain from the second card as every renderer is different . 
  tl ; dr : it 's a wildcard . 
  i 've been buying my hardware for 10 + years and i always picked a single-gpu solution , even if it was more expensive and/or less performant . 
  i 'm pretty confident that only oculus can change my mind , since it 's a natural fit for two gpus . 
  you spend time playing the game and get the unlocks naturally , not hunting for fucking boxes like a loon ... this is how it should be all along . 
  or if you consider that `` forced '' , then just choosing to run over people in general ... in a tank , ifv or - even better - a hover tank . 
  it 's so easy in a hover tank , not to mention it 's pretty much the most efficient way to kill nearby infantry in this damn thing . 
   not if you 've played cte since it came out . 
  huh ? 
  maybe i just do n't understand what you mean / how it relates to this . 
  btw i have 126h of playtime on cte . 
  ah , so he means `` not if you 've ** exclusively ** played cte since it came out '' . 
  still , that 's the choice you actively decided to make , it 's not like somebody forced you to do it to get something significant . 
  haha , that sand storm ... a perfect crime !, 
  :d you sneaky bastard !, 
  ( btw use the classic preset for further hilarity ), 
  becuase it felt amazing ? 
  btw i think i remeber your name now , pronato . 
   tourette, 
  i see this the first time . 
  i mean no disrespect , but that 's the most hilarious illness ever !, 
  :d wanking lucifer biscuits !, 
  i do n't know where a typical pleb gets this nonsense . 
  yes , fusion was always the holy grail , but the scientific community just recently ( think 10 years ) moved `` out of the lab '' and started actually thinking about the real world applications and the issues that come with it . 
  [ this thing is the way forward ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iter ) . 
  fusion is the greenest and the most efficient way to make electric energy we , as humanity , currently have ( excluding matter-antimatter annihilation , but that 's not something we 'll see exploited within our lifetimes ) . 
  solar panels and wind turbines are fine and dandy , but they have their own issues ( huge ones ) and are completely useless as the basis of a stable , nation-wide energy grid . 
  these things can keep us going and reduce some environmental stress , but they 're not a solution . 
  [ demo ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demo ) success could make fusion energy widely available by 2040 . 
  i do n't know how old are you , but i can see myself living for another 25 years . 
  and even if i do n't , let 's be honest here - we do n't mess around with green energy for our benefit , we do it for the benefit of out children , grandchildren or the planet in general . 
  and in that sense , $ 50 billion and 25 years seems like fucking peanuts . 
  post-patch cbj-ms is not bad at all . 
  i swear some of you guys have too much free time , lol . 
  ^ do n't ^ mind ^ me , ^ i 'm ^ just ^ jelly . 
  much better than bang a hag for sure . 
  damn , it 's always corn . 
  and pigs . 
  i blame david sirland . 
  it was a joke ... even though ... you 're jjju 's boss , no ? 
  because animals taste fucking delicious . 
  and cute little animals doubly so . 
   your body and the animals you 're saving will thank you, 
  neither of that is true . 
  first of all , animals ca n't speak and even if they could , they 'd still get murdered for other people to eat . 
  there are just too many of us . 
  second of all , meat ( fat and protein ) is not bad for you , it never was , carbohydrates/sugars are ( which is a message that finally , after decades of fear mongering , gets approved by many new studies into cardiovascular health - fat is good ) . 
  how is it that in these montages there 's always a ton of absolutely clueless aa campers or tanks ... 
  i mean , why do n't i have the privilege to play against such cannon fodder . 
  suck it out !, 
  would be proud . 
  if that was bannable , half the community would be banned . 
  99 % of people found the boxes on `` phantom dog tag hunt '' servers . 
  now prepare to buy story dlc worth a lot more than the games themselves .
