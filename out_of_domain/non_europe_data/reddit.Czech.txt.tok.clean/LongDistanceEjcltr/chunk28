  edit : still worth he money if you ask me . 
  even with the trilogy 's shitty ending , it 's still one of the best gaming experiences i 've ever had . 
   tripfags who resides in reddit wo n't understand, 
  you realize you write this on reddit . 
  use mexican origin for even cheaper deal :p, 
  to the people who make the prices on origin : fuck you . 
  if your games did n't cost 70 euros , i would not be inclined to buy them through mexican vpn . 
   probably, 
  totally , not probably :p, 
  i like cumpilations . 
  more like handeggs, 
   this is a massive blow, 
  yeah it was , the guy died, 
  . . the one that is not ` the stink ', 
  do n't forget to click on the obsidiots link in the description ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcmw3ahwbka ), 
  just so you have more people with `` racist tag '' and to show you how much shit i give about your browser preferences : nigger . 
  only in battlefield . 
  if by hindu you mean retard , they yes . 
  i was grinning the whole time . 
  way too cute for my jaded soul . 
  ia got ** massively ** butthurt about that last , drunk stream ( the one with moaning , `` ayy lmao '' and kop 's bs ) . 
  ever since that video ( which got generally disliked and critized ) his twitter messages got pretty weird , defensive and generally `` oh i do n't care '' , and it culminated with his `` burn everything '' meltdown . 
  i mean , how often do you see people closing youtube and all associated social media accounts ( unless it 's a breach of privacy issue ) ? 
  how often do you see people with 100k subs closing their accounts ? 
  and we 're talking about * closing * an account , not * abandoning * it . 
  also , was n't gg-themed video only a recent ( and relatively small ) portion of his channel 's content ? 
  what about all those tumblrisms etc. ? 
  the dude posted twitter messages unrelated to gg fairly often ( traveling/gaming/socializing kind of posts ) ... and suddenly he closes the thing . 
  that was ** phil fish ** level of weird . 
  oh the irony . 
   i 'm kind of curious to know what it feels like as the brain is releasing those final chemicals as it shuts down . 
  in that last euphoric bliss before nothingness . 
  no need to die . 
  start using [ dmt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/n,n-dimethyltryptamine ) . 
  yep , pretty much this . 
  i love battlefield and i play it ( by far ) the most of any game i own , but i can see that the game simply is n't a strong competitive/e-sport title because it lacks a lot of required features . 
  * at the very least , 60hz server update rate, 
  * local network matches, 
  * far less forgiving client latency compensation, 
  * tailor-made maps for competitive play ( no , a portion of the conquest version is not enough ) with higher resolution of all in-game object physical collisions and additional polish so they match perfectly with the geometry ( zero invisible walls or holes you ca n't shoot through ), 
  to have all these features while retaining the ability to support huge 64 player cql maps would require quite a bit of technological overhaul ( most likely a new engine ) , possibly dropping the older consoles and also different design choices ( this is probably the most problematic , since ea wants everyone to be able to play , regardless of their connection and i highly doubt ea is even remotely interested in turning its bf cash cow into something that * may * one day vaguely resemble counter-strike as far as competitive scene goes ) . 
  currently online players :, 
  * pc : 19,491 ; peak 24h : 43,424, 
  * ps3 : 24,565 ; peak 24h : 29,233, 
  * xbox360 : 19,881 ; peak 24h : 21,249, 
  * xboxone : 16,754 ; peak 24h : 17,494, 
  * ps4 : 20,030 ; peak 24h : 24,426, 
  those are very good numbers for a year old game . 
   this would be labeled as brigading on reddit, 
  who gives a shit about crappy reddit rules . 
  seriously , fuck that shit already . 
  my eyes start to bleed every fucking time i read the word `` brigading '' . 
   i would never do this, 
  well good for you , but nobody cares . 
  get your 200k subs , then you can do whatever you want with them . 
  still better than basement-dwelling reddit mods ... 
  i feel that you apparently like to spam a lot . 
  you want a medal , mr. internet protector ? 
  of badger ? 
  lmao . 
  badger is a very douchy guy and based on a few streams i saw , the dude is pretty much the most disrespectful `` twitch.tv person '' i 've seen , taking jabs at his audience/players on his server/people in general . 
  i do n't like him at all . 
  on top of that , the other guy in his streams is straight up wall street ultra-douchebag . 
  however , people crying about a fucking random call to action ( which is n't even offensive or anything like that ) and trying to be white knights for dice employees piss me off much , much more . 
   unless you have a severe allergy to it , eating it is not going to end your life , shorten your lifespan , or breed super diseases in you . 
  this is false . 
  and it 's dangerous to think that way . 
  read up on [ mycotoxins ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mycotoxin ) , particularly [ aflatoxins ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aflatoxin ) . 
   high-level aflatoxin exposure produces an acute hepatic necrosis , resulting later in cirrhosis , or carcinoma of the liver, 
   chronic , subclinical exposure does not lead to symptoms as dramatic as acute aflatoxicosis . 
  children , however , are particularly affected by aflatoxin exposure , which leads to stunted growth and delayed development, 
   chronic exposure also leads to a high risk of developing liver cancer, 
  unless it 's a known genus with known properties . 
  you should not be scared of it , but giving 0 fucks is pretty dangerous . 
   is it just that some molds are okay to eat and others are not, 
  of course . 
   how can one tell the difference ? 
  you generally ca n't . 
  that 's why you have take the same approach as you do when you go mushroom hunting . 
  do n't pick up shit unless you 're absolutely sure about what it is . 
  introduction of molds into food ( cheese , salami , fermented sausage , soybeans etc. ), 
  is a very delicate process that requires controlled temperature , humidity and a hand picked culture with required properties ... which is exactly what you do n't have in the case of that moldy bread in your bread cupboard . 
   definition of `` chronic exposure '' needs to consider dosage, 
  sure . 
   if you eat any grain products , you are eating mycotoxins . 
  it ca n't be prevented ... only minimized, 
  sure , that 's why you have government agencies like the fda to establish action levels . 
  what i 'm talking about here is this guy waving hand at eating moldy food . 
  if you eat a moldy slice of bread , that 's a truckload of toxins . 
   the mold that grows on bread that 's been sitting around for a long time is generally rhizopus stolonifer . 
  not one of the aflatoxin producing species . 
  i did n't say that bread mold produces aflatoxins . 
  if it did , we 'd be in deep shit :d what i 'm saying is that you generally do n't want to eat any mycotoxins ( unless you 're on antibiotics and that penicillin mycotoxin helps you out :p ) . 
   your generalization is the safer one , i 'll admit, 
  all i know is that most of this shit is pretty damn potent and the levels of mycotoxins required to see some negative effects is very low , plus it appears that different mycotoxins may have synergistic properties . 
  most of these things are poorly studied , but it 's apparent that - based on what we know - it 's better to avoid than to wave hands . 
  why risk it . 
  btw you latched on that bread example , but if we move to moldy apples ( and other moldy fruits and vegetables ) , for example , you deal with [ patulin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patulin ) ( and you can go from there ) . 
  unrelated , but interesting side note : lsd was synthesized from ergotamine mycotoxin , an [ ergot ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ergot ) alkaloid . 
  r9 390x & oculus ... the next year is the year when i 'll give an arm and a leg for a new beast rig :d,
