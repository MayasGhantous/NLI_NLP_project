  the funny thing about 20k concurrent players is that it 's still miles above any other pc multiplayer fps ( well , except valve shooters that is ) . 
  edit : i also see dayz in the ~ 20k range , but i do n't really consider that to be a typical mp fps . 
  hbm is pretty much confirmed . 
  there have been several leaks mentioning it and most importantly , hynix is ready . 
  at this point , i 'm pretty much scared to watch anything from san francisco ... 
  edit : watched it , it 's amazing !, 
  i did . 
  delicious . 
  mmmm . 
  i love it . 
  i wish i could bathe in those delicious tears . 
  in united states of prudence and sjwism . 
  the legal systems in normal countries would consider this indecent exposure . 
  it 's not recommended to mess with it by using 3rd party tools . 
  there is an [ option ] ( http://i.imgur.com/knelw0x.png ) to completely uninstall all amd software and that is the [ official recommended way ] ( http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/pages/gpu57removeoldgraphicsdrivers.aspx ) to uninstall/reinstall drivers . 
  also try disabling mantle if you have it enabled . 
  the whole [ rso ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_offender_registration ) issue in the us makes it a moot point . 
  there is no circlejerk . 
  the act in the video ( which is clearly just an offensive prank ) would make you a tier i sex offender - that requires registration for 15 years and annual verification . 
   some aspects of the current sex offender legislation in united states have been widely criticized by civil right organizations human rights watch [ 2 ] [ 3 ] and american civil liberties union ( aclu ) , [ 4 ] professional organizations national association of criminal defense lawyers [ 5 ] and association for the treatment of sexual abusers , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] reformist groups rsol , [ 8 ] usa fair , [ 9 ] and w.a.r , [ 10 ] and by child safety advocate and chair of national center for missing & exploited children , patty wetterling . 
  so , what you 're saying is that this guy should have his life ruined because of `` an obnoxious prank '' ? 
  you can kill people while driving drunk in your beautiful country and get away with far less than this guy would be subjected to . 
  yep . 
  this is no different than flagrun . 
  blatant boosting . 
   with high level execs things tend to get swept away pretty conveniently, 
  this is absolutely true . 
  watch the recent interviews with t1gge ( posted here a few days ago ) - he mentions how this stuff ( the whole `` player first '' and relative openness ) only began to change as a combination of the new ceo coming in ( sep 2013 ) and bf4 's disastrous launch ( which was a `` wake up call '' , as he called it iirc ) . 
  with ea stock at 6-year high ( and about 3.5 x as high as it was around the bf4 release ) , it 's easy to say `` yeah , this is the way forward , this is good '' , but as soon as the tide changes ( which it inevitably will , it 's just a matter of time ) , this whole new ( more open ) approach can crumble in weeks . 
  let 's hope we get cte at least for battlefront , if not bf5 . 
  2015 is full bro . 
  bf : hardline - march 2015 . 
  battlefront 3 - holiday 2015 . 
  more like animation bug . 
  179-0 : this is exactly why the ah needs new physics . 
  because , you know , somebody could sneak in a lucky sraw shot and that 179-1 would look bad on the record . 
   ca n't wait to see you guys with new heli cte physics, 
  this community is seriously fucked in the head . 
  i swear to god . 
  you see two guys go 179-0 and your reaction is `` ca n't wait to see you guys with new heli cte physics '' ? 
  so this is somehow under-powered to you ? 
  so you want to tell me that the mere ability to go 179-0 and essentially erase the other team is balanced in any way , shape or form ? 
  a 64 player game and two guys destroy the other 32 . 
  and this is not only fine , but you also `` ca n't wait to see you guys with new heli cte physics '' . 
  i have no words . 
  no wonder people gravitate towards other games or infantry-only matches . 
  some of you people disgust me . 
  how is this fun to anyone but the two guys in the ah ? 
  you make the game for 2 , but ruin it for the other 62 ... . and this is precisely the reason dice la sometimes looks like they do n't know what the fuck are they doing . 
  a few vocal whiners on the cte forums is all it takes to start messing with the core concepts that were n't even a problem for 95 % of the community . 
  after the ah physics patch , it wo n't be just very good people who can dominate , it will be fucking everyone who gets into the thing and is half-decent . 
  and once again , we 'll see classic dice balancing at play : on maps with jets , the ah will still be generally useless , because it will get owned , but on maps without jets , it will become the god weapon everyone will be camping . 
  i 'm all for godly ahs , but in things like arma . 
  games where the ah matters as an asset , it 's not easy to take down , but if you take it down , it 's a hit for the opposing team and it does n't respawn in fucking 2 minutes . 
  what do you get in bf4 if you somehow manage to take it down ? 
  a kill , or two . 
  it 's back soon and will continue to decimate . 
  stating that `` new physics wont stop anyone of stingering and srawing them down '' is absolute nonsense . 
  * heatseekers are now avoidable . 
  * sraw 's usability is directly proportional to the ability of the vehicle to change direction quickly . 
  it was already ** very ** difficult to hit scouts ( i would go as far as to say that if you try to hit a skilled scout pilot , you either have to be an absolute sraw ace or simply lucky ) . 
   after they used flares/ecm and your missile did not hit , you have around 20 seconds to fire a missile again, 
  sometimes i feel like i 'm talking to people that do n't play the same game . 
  every half-decent pilot will bail as soon as he pops the ecm ( or try to take you out and if he fails to do so , then get away ) , waits for it to recharge before going into the hot zone again . 
  and i 'm not even taking into account repair drones . 
  one stinger vs a scout with a repair drone is 100 % useless even as an area-of-denial weapon . 
  your beef agains sraw is well known , but sadly for you , it has no basis in reality . 
  sure , it can be used as a cheap anti-infantry `` snipe '' weapon , but that 's where the cheapness ends . 
  mentioning stinger in the same sentence is flat out retarded . 
  i also like how a person with 68 sraw kills after 514 hours of gameplay tells people how cheap it is . 
  more like you ca n't hit shit with it . 
  yeah , you hit two hovering noobs . 
  the first one you did n't even aim till the end and the rocket still hit , that 's how much predictable the dude was . 
  the second one might as well be a stationary target . 
  that is a sraw montage right there . 
  yeah , i guess jim ( ia ) was right after all . 
  the whole `` movement '' has been overrun by ~ ~ dumbasses ~ ~ useful idiots and profiteers . 
  time to bail . 
  you mean wu ? 
  wu is a persona completely created by gg - out of nothing . 
  call out the bullshit and move on , is it that hard ? 
  no , we have to repost and deconstruct every nonsense she/he puts on the internet and do the ridiculous back and forth for weeks . 
  gg is giving attention to attention whores . 
  this will never stop because there is always a new attention whore that will play the oppressed card . 
   disingenuous charity drives to somehow make the media like gg, 
  this is what i do n't get . 
  the `` movement '' tried it several times already , it does n't work . 
  and like you say , it 's totally a disingenuous charity drive , because people do n't donate for the sake of donating , but to inflate their political credit . 
  ( even though i still subscribe to the idea that all money for a good cause are a fair game , regardless of their origin ... so i definitely do n't consider the donated money wasted . ), 
  anyways , with the amount of money raised , the movement could have easily funded a professional investigation into the dealings of fem freq non-profit ( if you want to push that angle ) or an independent audit of the hashtag and the behavior displayed by both sides ( so you have hard facts and numbers to back up your claims that gg is not a harassment movement ) or fund an independent documentary or whatever . 
  there are many constructive things you can do . 
  anyone with half a brain can see that [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/2ojjyq/siege_of_shanghai_1790_ah/ ) buffed into the stratosphere will not be fun to anyone except 0.001 % of the bf community . 
   they will try , and then get shit on by effortless lock-on chain mobility disables until death . 
  yeah , so you pop ecm and get `` effortless lock-on chain mobility disables until death '' . 
  holy crap , that is some next level stinger you have there since it can lock on through ecm . 
   leave the battle for half a minute, 
  you mean hide behind the nearest object to break potential locks ? 
   fairly balanced game, 
  all i see in the game are scouts getting double digit to triple digit ( in high ticket games ) number of kills and whining when somebody dares to postpone their kill streak .
