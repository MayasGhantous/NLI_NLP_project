  `` i think they will fix the game just enough to get most of the loud complaints to stop . '', 
  - to be fair , this is what happens to almost all full priced games from big publishers . 
  by the time the sweeping change would be implemented , there would already be a sequel well under development . 
  but some f2p and subscription-based games do make big improvements ( i.e. 
  this is what happens when you do n't playtest you game at all . 
  weird , ace 23 seems quite accurate to me . . have you tried sar-21 ? 
  many people use it because you can pretty much laser-beam with it ( and even out-snipe dmrs at medium distances ) . 
  also , if you can handle scar-h 's recoil properly ( i ca n't myself ) , it 's pretty much the best weapon in the whole game . 
  it feels like any other modern mmo with `` action '' combat ( tera etc. ), 
  and quests are laughably bad ( classic fetch quests , `` storyline progressing '' quests that look really cheap etc. ), 
  and most importantly , even though skyrim is not a pinnacle of combat mechanics by any means , it is a ** masterpiece ** compared to eso . 
  and this is a dealbreaker for me - that feeling of a classic 15484532th mmo game with wonky animations and weird hit detection . 
  the combat is just bad and offers very little challenge . 
  believe it or not , this happened to me today for the first time ( after 170 hours of playing ) . 
  that is probably like 1/5 of known bugs ... ( not even talking about balance ), 
  xp boosts + double xp events , bro ( yes , they do stack ) . 
  most lvl110 players have around 200-250 hours played . 
  keep law ( ap should catch it though ) , staff and arm need proper nerfing, 
  8.1 definitely does help . 
  you have both better threading and dx 11.1 optimizations . 
  rush mode on ... . . a map designed for rush . 
  that 's what i 'd love to see . 
  how the fuck did you get it to look that bad lol :p, 
  make that more like 20 . . 
  m320 too . 
  sure, 
  ... but , but i like just cause 2 :(, 
  damn noobs :d, 
  it 's the new balancing system !, 
  flanking is the new camping :p, 
  [ the reckening ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky5ukn8mxtk ), 
  it 's not about `` some people are okay '' , it 's about content discoverability and some kind of responsibility for the content offered . 
  anyways this is already a moot point , because of this : http://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/1vb9ho/valve_looking_to_drop_greenlight/, 
  welcome to the new era of shitty marketplace mostly filled with tons of crap , just like google play . 
  as evidenced by ... what exactly ? 
  look at google play . 
  steam does n't have a tool powerful enough to make your life easier when discovering content . . look at the reviews . 
  it 's not an innovative system in any way , it 's just a bland copy-paste of classic thumbs up rating system . 
  what 's more , most of the stuff on the damn thing is being recommended , because the people who play the game are mostly fans and they do n't even attempt to rate it objectively ( this is especially true if we 're talking about early access ) !, 
  so the bad rating does not really apply to bad game mechanics as much as the state of the game 's content and programming ( bugs and missing features ) . 
  these reviews are piss-poor source of content discoverability . 
  you know , there is a reason why professional media often give the reviews to the members of the editorial team that are not big fans of the reviewed product lines . 
  lmao , that seems surprisingly accurate, 
  this was introduced in the latest patch and it 's fairly annoying . 
  i play domination of dawnbreaker fairly regularly and this definitely wa n't there before the patch . 
  this is n't even some obscure glitch that shows up only once in a while - it 's just fucked up geometry and it 's in every damn match . 
  you could catch this if you 'd play the map just once or twice , but i guess that is too much to ask from the frostbite geniuses . 
   to me , it feels like the one-hit-kill bug has returned in some form . 
  whatever is going on , it looks like my client gets information in little chunks ( probably related to tick rate again ) , not showing incoming fire ... and then i 'm suddenly dead . 
  i have to say that i 'm seeing a lot of what seems like one-hit kills ( from the receiving end ) . 
  so you 're probably right . 
  it probably will not get fixed , ever . 
  it is fairly obvious at this point that dice does not know how to fix it without redesigning the whole damn thing . 
  given the ea 's release schedules and their attitude in general , it 's highly unlikely that something as radical as overhauling the engine networking sub-system will happen before the next frostbite mp game . 
  ** serious question time ** : what the fuck is going on over at dice ? 
  half of the modes in bf4 were an afterthought ... 
  hotfix ... from dice ... * giggles *, 
  it 's like they 're building their first serious app back at university , lol ... all the redists , libs etc. 
  on a programmer 's pc are very much different than what an average joe has - that 's why you should always try what will break on a fresh windows installation and on multiple windows versions you support . 
  that is one of the reasons why companies like ea even have qa & testing teams . 
  but since consoles ( you know , those closed systems with forced firmware updates ) also suffer from numerous problems , my guess is that the engine is just one giant clusterfuck designed to pump out maximum pretty regardless of how hard is it to actually make games in . 
  that or the dice development team is just incompetent :p, 
  i did n't know about the [ bf3 ps3 lag ] ( http://doesbf3stillhaveinputlag.nojacko.com ) - that is simply hilarious . 
  that average bf4 input lag of [ 70ms + ] ( http://www.mordorhq.com/showthread.php?13777-bf4-input-lag-on-pc-compared-to-other-games ) without v-sync is also new to me . 
  unbelievable . 
  [ helicopter teleport glitch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaumtwstbu4 ) ( [ reddit thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1v4u6w/new_helicopter_teleport_glitch_has_anyone_else/ ) , [ sliced lime 's response ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1v4u6w/new_helicopter_teleport_glitch_has_anyone_else/cep6pg5 ) ), 
  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh , thanks !, 
  for the lazy ;, 
  battlefield ** physical ** sales , global first ten weeks ( units ) :, 
  * bf4 : 2,512,808 ( + 925,907 xbone , first 7 weeks ), 
  * bf4 : 2,215,295 ( + 1,311,046 ps4 , first 8 weeks ), 
  source : [ vgchartz ] ( http://www.vgchartz.com/ ) ( btw according to pachter , vgchartz does interpolate from samples , but it * is * generally in the ballpark ) . 
  pc sales are predominantly digital ( for a couple of years now ) . 
  as for the overall drop of battlefield sales , it seems to be around 30 % . 
  definitely not something a sequel to popular series should be doing . 
  however , call of duty also is n't breaking any records ( it looks like ghosts first 9 weeks are down 10 % compared to black ops ii ) ... but then again , these numbers may be off , because of the ability to buy full games digitally on the new consoles . 
  it 's also in the `` details '' tab on the `` stats '' page, 
  i 'm sure it will get fixed [ soon ] ( http://doesbf3stillhaveinputlag.nojacko.com ) . 
  in before americunt rednecks ... . . oh damn it , too late :(, 
  premium refund will become available ? 
  * well , one can dream ... *, 
  [ yes , we do ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1vc9lg/jan_13_patch_what_happened_to_infantry_combat/ ) . 
  that would probably make for a full-length movie , and i 'm not even joking . 
  aaah , good old network smoothing ... sometimes i think that dice put it into the options just so we could bullshit ourselves with `` adjust your network smoothing slider , bro '' responses . 
  i 'm alternating between 0 and 10 % regularly , but i 'm not seeing much difference ( if any at all ) ... and the problem in op 's video happens anyways , especially with roof ladders and such . 
  this is a [ known ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1ve6ek/only_in_star_trekfield_4/ ) [ issue ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1v4u6w/new_helicopter_teleport_glitch_has_anyone_else/ ) with bugged gunner seats ( well , at least to the community - dice will probably take 3 months to fix it ) . 
  and before someone says so - this is n't even an exclusive issue with highly detailed geometry ... the floor edges on the top of those two zavod towers are prime examples . 
  dude , you could use a reality check ... the time for reasonable discussion is long past , it 's not like we 're two weeks after the release ... everything that needed to be said has been said ( several times in fact , in this very sub-reddit , in long youtube videos , analysis have been made , paralels drawn , suggestions and improvements proposed ) . 
  the lack of full duplex communication between the community and dice ( that is : first , acknowledgment of the problems and second , an estimated time schedule of fixing these problems ) means there is not much we can discuss anymore . 
   we have a lot more access to a lot more dice staff than most games ' subreddits have access to their developers . 
  instead of treating this like the benefit it is ... 
  that is bullshit , dear sir . 
  it 's not the community 's fault that the community management at dice/ea sucks and/or is being actively prohibited from discussing anything important . 
  while it is nice to see an occasional post from / u/sliced _ lime et al. , they 're ** extremely ** picky on which posts they reply to and most of the time , it 's just static noise . 
  besides , i do n't really feel the need to read developer comments from tehir personal twitter/reddit accounts , i want official communication channels to work and ea to stop pooping on our heads . 
  ... but , but , but `` multiple configurations '' :d, 
  [ k ] ( http://www.fatherlyadviceandrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/frost-bite-3.jpg ), 
  i was so stupid . 
  now i see the genius planning that went into flashbangs !, 
  it 's fun to use , essentially an extremely slow reloading , one hit kill slug shotgun .
