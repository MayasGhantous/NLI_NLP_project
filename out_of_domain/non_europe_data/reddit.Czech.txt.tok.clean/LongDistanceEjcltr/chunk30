   people like you whined so hard about trivial non issues and got repair tool speed nerfed into the ground . 
  of course . 
  that 's why you saw invincible scouts with two repair drones everywhere , before they nerfed it several times since it was so blatantly broken . 
   it 's nuts, 
  yes . 
  that person needs professional ( psychiatric ) help asap . 
  ( i do n't mean that in a derogatory way , it 's the same thing as hard drug addiction or morbid obesity - most people ca n't get out of it on their own . ), 
   surprised by how frequently this has been on sale for such a new , hyped-up game . 
  that 's because it under-performed ( at least as far as ea 's `` we need to sell 5mil or we 're gutting this franchise '' goes ) . 
  what i found amazing in relation to this is that there is a [ pulsar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psr_j1748-2446ad ) ( rotating neutron star ) we know of that rotates as fast as 716 times per second while having a radius of 16 km , which means that at its equator it is spinning at ~ 24 % of the speed of light , or over 70,000 km per second . 
  i 'm not that well-versed in the newest literally xys :p, 
   i 'm morbidly obese and i do n't need any help thank you very much . 
  so you 're saying you could have average weight if you wanted to ? 
  or what ? 
  * you know , i could be a successful ceo if i wanted to ...  * but hey , if you 're truly comfortable in your body then continue doing what you 're doing , i do n't judge , i just never met an obese person that wants to remain obese ( but i do know exceptions exist ) . 
   what the hell is `` hard '' drug, 
  pulsars would apparently break apart if they spun at a rate of ~ 1500 rotations per second ; at a rate of ~ 1000 rotations per second or more , they lose energy by gravitational radiation faster than the accretion process would speed them up . 
  afaik the fastest rotating object we know of is a black hole powering this quasar : [ rx j1131-1231 ] ( http://www.space.com/24936-supermassive-black-hole-spin-quasar.html ) . 
  1.4 - [ 3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tolman%e2%80%93oppenheimer%e2%80%93volkoff_limit ) solar masses in a ball with a radius of 16km or less . 
  pretty intense . 
  ( example : the density is equivalent to the mass of a boeing 747 compressed to the size of a small grain of sand . ), 
  even the zebra itself wanted to try some zebra !, 
  lol, 
  may a take a peek at the results ? 
  do you have some screens/vids ? 
  what 's up with ea and tuesday patches . 
  and more importantly , what 's up with ea and limiting the number and frequency of patches on the pc where patching does n't cost anything ?

   deferred revenues, 
  [ http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredrevenue.asp] ( http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredrevenue.asp ) :, 
   advance payments or unearned revenue , recorded on the recipient 's balance sheet as a liability , until the services have been rendered or products have been delivered . 
  deferred revenue is a liability because it refers to revenue that has not yet been earned , but represents products or services that are owed to the customer . 
  as the product or service is delivered over time , it is recognized as revenue on the income statement . 
  early access kind of thing for another bf4 expansion or hardline ? 
  btw it 's already tuesday in most of the world ... just sayin ' :p, 
  ahhh , i see the dude is still around and being listened to . 
  sad . 
  tl ; dr : your post is bullshit . 
  i bet you 're one of the liberal arts losers . 
  from you . 
  some people may not give a shit about searching for these things for hours on end ( me ) , but they 'd like to try out the bow eventually ( me ) or buy it for a reasonable price because they have jobs ( me ) . 
  whoever put this together deserves a bad case of explosive diarrhea . 
  at work . 
  in an elevator . 
  that is stuck . 
  bf4 is better :p,

   she 's pretty fucking, 
  my male gaze is off the charts ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  edit : just saw it and ... 
  i 'll be honest , i did n't expect she 'd be so smart . 
  sexy . 
   the experiment suggests that short term exposure to the images used results in increased likelihood to tolerate an instance of sexual harassment . 
  yeah ? 
   increased likelihood to tolerate an instance of sexual harassment, 
  for how long is this effect present ? 
  a minute ? 
  an hour ? 
  10 years ? 
   the experiment suggests that, 
  the only thing this experiment suggests is that a small , hand picked selection of young men within a very narrow demographic has a tendency to lean towards x after presented by y. 
  in other words , it means shit . 
  locker party :p, 
  i hate it !!, 
  ! 11 ( cuz i do n't have it ; _ , 
  said the the defecatingnun, 
  pencil dick . 
  and no game . 
  because games are fun . 
  and we apparently need `` games '' that are not fun . 
  berta and the whole reddit armie troll group is the best thing that could have happened to the youtube comments . 
  it 's always hilarious to read the reactions of people getting mad . 
  / u/friedcook - you are the best of the lot . 
  thanks for the laughs . 
  this , ladies and gentlemen , is how talent looks like . 
  i bet the same real men also play 90 % assault .

  the game is oppressing civilians !, 
   the only time someone will pass up tb is when he retires, 
  if the cancer gets him , i will be pissed !, 
  do n't you fucking dare to die on me tb !, 
  or make some toasts , take a butter knife and scrape off that deliciousness on the toast , add some mayo , maybe some chives ... delicious dinner . 
   individual who is a community adviser to the dice team . 
  he is also behind the cte changes, 
  there you have it folks , dice totally does n't listen to a few youtubers ... lmao, 
  it 's because the cte is a shitshow for a few chosen ones and half of the time , it focuses on bullshit nobody really cares about . 
  dice la is drinking way too much of the kool-aid . 
  i wont be sad because i 'm not a hypocrite . 
  i 'm honest enough to say that tb is a good entertainer and i like his videos , but regarding his persona , i do n't feel any personal connection or something like that . 
  he 's not my friend . 
  he 's not my family . 
  he 's not my colleague . 
  i do n't even know him . 
  sad is a very strong word and i 'll keep it for my real family , friends and pets , thank you very much . 
  yea right , 30 tick testing was how many percent of cte testing ? 
  do n't make me laugh . 
  half the community stopped giving a shit about bf4 and moved on to other games . 
  many simply do not care anymore this long after the release .
