   the objective is just to mass murder, 
  just like in the postal series . 
  and postal 1 ca n't even be considered to be satire . 
  well ... strictly speaking , it kinda is . 
  fastest muzzle velocity  smallest bullet drop . 
  that 's reddit for you . 
  it 's a full steam site ( steampowered.com ) in an iframe . 
  does n't work for me, 
  i think the 7x scope is the first one you get with jng-90 and i actually kind of got used to it and now i like it more than 8x . 
  gaben stepped in . 
  after he got emails . 
  including one from me . 
  which makes you think how would valve look like without him . 
  scary stuff . 
  same issue here . 
  i have da : i installed on my 232gb system ssd along with bf4 ( which has ballooned to 56gb ) and a few other things ( visual studio etc. ) ... 
  and there 's just not enough space anymore ( and i refuse to play frostbite 3 games on a hdd , the loading times are absolutely crazy ) . 
  so , until i 'm done with the inquisition , no cte for me . 
  and wait 4 minutes instead of 40 seconds ? 
  no , thanks . 
  you are a disgrace . 
  learn to play , because maybe in the next game , they wont listen to whiners so you may actually need to learn to fly with the helis . 
  remove laser , remove lockon . 
  keep the manual guidance and rocket speed as is . 
  is it that hard to do ? 
  apparently it is . 
   being able to one shot a tank was dumb , by firing up , then firing the second shot at the tank, 
  i 'm not sure what you mean . 
  sraw double shot is not in the game for a few months and even when it was in the game , you did n't `` one shot '' a tank . 
  funny thing is that the vast majority of people in this thread ( and probably in general ) will see this and go `` op !!!, 
  nerf !!!, 
  '' , but what they do n't know is that, 
  * it 's not that easy to fly with, 
  * ** what you see in the gif is its air burst unlock **, 
  the difference between air burst and standard ucav is ** massive ** ( its air burst variant should n't even be in the game ... you can literally clear out a portion of a roof in one hit ) , but many people do n't give a shit about ucav and the rest just does n't know the difference between the ucav and it 's airburst unlock . 
  ucav is now overpowered and that 's it . 
  look forward to * yet another * useless gadget in the game once dice gets to it . 
  it 's been annihilated . 
  made shitty . 
  ruined . 
  fucked up . 
  crapped on . 
  take your pick . 
  the change does n't `` just '' reduce its power ( it does that too , though xd ) , it fundamentally changes its mechanics , meaning that you can no longer use it to take campers out on the roofs , make quick changes in trajectory to get ( now much , much more agile ) attack choppers etc. 
  the funniest thing is that its infantry sniping capabilities stay pretty much intact . 
  reasonably distant enemies are a fair game :p ... gg dice . 
  there are a few community members who can change things , but your typical joe 's ( granted , sometimes angry ) messages in the cte forums are generally ignored . 
  many people are saying they do n't understand the reasoning behind the nerf ( i 'm one of them ) . 
  especially since all choppers ( including transport ) got a massive agility buff ( which is an indirect nerf to the sraw ) . 
  you know what will happen now ? 
  instead of sraws , people will take more iglas and more stingers and there will be more lockon bullshit than ever before . 
  i hope the people responsible for this nerf will enjoy that . 
  i know i will . 
  it 's only fair to make your game less fun when you make my game less fun . 
  the guy is trying too hard , his comments can be seen on a lot of youtube videos , especially bf related , reddit , battlelogs etc. 
  mix that with a bunch of opinions ranging from unpopular to dickish , and there you have it . 
  he 's battlefield 's very own pressfarttocontinue . 
  nah , the dog tag is fine . 
  i just could n't care less about a random dog tag and i would n't click on the thread if it was n't for the title . 
  for millionth time , the background animation on battlelog is turned off automatically when the game loads . 
  it has been even stated by a battlelog dev directly in this sub . 
  * sigh *, 
  modern browsers use the ** gpu ** for pretty much all rendering needs . 
  turn off hardware acceleration in chrome and see how it goes . 
  ( settings -  show advanced settings ... -  untick `` use hardware acceleration when available '' ), 
  of course you still ca n't expect to have a dozen of tabs or videos opened on the background . 
  havok is not a deterministic physics engine . 
  the ragdoll i see on my client * may * end up in a different place than the one you see on your client , so you 're kinda correct , but afaik no game engine runs ragdoll simulations on the server side . 
  because ragdoll physics & networking do not really like each other :p, 
  cool :d, 
  ps : jesus , matimi0 , get a reddit account already !, 
  i predict a bright future for this gif . 
  no kidding , 5h 30min o_o, 
   oh man why did i go in the youtube comments . 
  i need some brain bleach . 
  i do n't know , i 'm 50 hours in and this youtube comment ( from user bradtheamerican ) sums my feelings quite well ( i do n't agree with everything , but the majority of his post is very much on point ) :, 
  ** quote pt1 : ** ( 2nd part is [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/2q3m09/my_review_of_dragon_age_inquisition_based_off_190/cn2xuyx ) ), 
  my biggest gripes are the lack of tactic slots , few talent/spell trees , and that the map regions are nearly empty and just there for the sake of filler ( scattered shards , rifts , and fetch quests with no real content ) . 
  i will be updating this comment . 
  without them , the ai is outright dreadful . 
  they use abilities at the most inopportune times , such as a mage casting barrier on an ally who is not even being attacked , or casts it as the fight finishes thus it being useless , or allies in general casting aoe abilities on single targets . 
  without specific conditions , allies just spam abilities thus rogues or mages will gain more threat than they should , and they will have no mana/stamina when other abilities will be needed , so it 's better just to disable all ally ai for aoe , short cooldown , or hard hitting abilities . 
  i could play through dao and da2 on the hardest difficulties using tactic slots with no problem , and little to no need for micromanaging . 
  in dai , the hardest part of the gameplay is the bad ai , so micromanaging feels forced . 
  if the tactic slots were there , i 'd say the game would be much easier than the previous games just because there are fewer enemies on screen , in general , but everything is an annoying dmg sponge . 
  i 'd rather have more enemies , but with less health like in the previous games tbh . 
  - skill trees :, 
  to me , the trees feel so uninspired . 
  mages are extremely basic , and non-mages may as well only have 3 trees because 2 of them are weapon based . 
  there are too few trees/abilities . 
  in the previous games there were far more things to play with , thus more builds and more replayability . 
  i also feel that the only weapon based tree that should exist in the game is archery , and all the others should be weapon agnostic , meaning it does n't matter what weapon you prefer to use ( shield , two-handed , daggers , swords , maces , etc ) . 
  this was an issue with dao as well . 
  you had quite a few weapon restricted talents that were basically re-skins of other abilities . 
  for example : pommel strike , shield bash , shield pummel , and overpower in dao , and the same for pommel strike and shield bash dai . 
  mighty blow and critical strike in dao . 
  same abilities , with minor alterations , and restricted to weapon types . 
  a simple warrior ability that was n't weapon restricted could have been simply called bash , and use it no matter your weapon preference is . 
  another is shield wall and block & slash . 
  they could have easily been part of a weapon agnostic tree and combined into an ability called block .
