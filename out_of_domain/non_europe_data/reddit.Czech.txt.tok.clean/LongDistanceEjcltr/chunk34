  either way , i still expected more . 
  - party banter :, 
  i 've heard about the bug , and honestly have no idea how much of an effect that had with my game . 
  that 's not what i 'm going to discuss though . 
  i do n't really know how to explain it , but a lot of conversations seemed too small , and that they ended without an actual conclusion . 
  character a would say something to character b , and they 'd retort a couple of words , and then when you think a character will address what they 've heard , they just leave it with no response . 
  it 's like the last sentence or two of the paragraph were scrapped . 
  then there 's the `` one line of random and irrelevant dialogue that consists of 3 words while i 'm exploring a random sand dune in the hissing wastes or other nearly empty map locations . '', 
  it 's too bad , because i always felt invested in conversations from the previous games , and it helped me appreciate characters that maybe i did n't necessarily care for at the time . 
  - cameos/returns :, 
  another complaint that i have is about the few number of cameos . 
  king alistair does n't even show up if you side with templars . 
  and what about samson ? 
  why is him showing back up based on you siding with the mages rather than you getting him back into the templar order in da2 ? 
  i also would have loved to see slave fenris show up . 
  bioware could have definitely upped their `` fan service '' for this game , instead of just bringing back varric and being like `` yea , that 's enough for the masses . '', 
  i 'm probably one of the few who actually does n't care for varric , so do n't hurt meh pls . 
  - war table :, 
  this part of the game was a waste of time , imo . 
  i 've heard the comparison to a mobile game . 
  but anyway , most of these , if not all , could have made fine side quests or even main quests out in those big empty map locations . 
  if you side with the mages , you can do an operation for therinfall redoubt , and if you side with the templars , you can do an operation for redcliffe ( ? 
  ) , if i remember correctly . 
  why could n't we just go to both locations regardless ? 
  having an element of `` order of completion '' for certain quests/locations causing different outcomes could have been neat . 
  instead , we get lines of text after waiting a few hours . 
  it would be great if you could use `` power '' to instantly complete war operations . 
  it 's a shame i have to compare to dao , because it should stand on its own , but i compare because rather than getting dao + more , we get less than dao but with big maps . 
  yay ? 
  the only expansive thing about dai is the size of the maps ( which i feel hurts the game anyway , especially considering there 's almost nothing of value in them ) , and everything else has shrunk , except for maybe character interaction . 
  the character interactions back at base are my favorite parts of the game . 
  i also really loved the astrariums . 
  most of them were too easy and only 3 made me think . 
  now i 've memorized the astrariums , and they are n't an issue . 
  regardless , they were more fun than those dumb shards . 
  i would buy an astrarium dlc pack , just sayin ' . 
  overall , dai is a big disappointment for me , mostly due to filler , but i still like it . 
  i originally hated dao when i first played it , but it became an acquired taste and now it 's one of my favorite games out there , so i 'm hoping dai will be the same . 
  i may bitch a lot about dragon age , but i do it because i care , because i 'm passionate about the series , and things like this just puncture my achy breaky heart . 
  this wall of text was sponsored by blahblahblaharrowintheface incorporated . 
  i also noticed that i put over 2 hours into creating/editing this comment , and i 'm probably going to add more because i 'm a stupid nerd . 
  i see you 've come back from a 3 months long reddit sleep , good :p, 
  no , but seriously ... this sub is filled with random gifs and while most of them tend to be interesting or somewhat funny , there are not that many gifs where you go `` whoa , i did n't see that before !, 
  where people get this from ? 
  shanghai 64 players is extremely demanding even with great intel cpus . 
  there is no way you 're going to get 120fps on ultra unless you 're rocking latest hardware . 
  not to mention that if you want the highest possible fidelity ( and by that i mean gameplay affecting stuff like being able to recognize uniforms/silhouettes at higher distances etc. 
  ) , you will move that super-sampling slider ( `` resolution scale '' ) to at least 150 % . 
  are you using super sampling ? 
  i play on low ( except filtering ) with super sampling at 150 % and the game 's image clarity is very good !, 
  well , if we 're talking 60fps then yes , i totally agree . 
  but we 're not , you mentioned 120 , 
  why are you playing at 90 if you have 144hz monitor ? 
  i get some people will prefer graphics over framerate ( i 'm not one of them ) , but it does seem like a waste to me to buy a 144hz monitor ( which has one huge downside - it 's a tn panel - and so its value for money outside gaming is quite poor ) and then not to use it ( while having the option to do so ) . 
  especially in a mp fps . 
  that variable fps around 90 will probably not be that much better than locked and consistent 60 ... anyways , i 'd mess with the settings to see if i could reach 144 and be a happy camper ( no pun intended ) even on low :p, 
  `` too easy '' - dannyonpc, 
  yet when you look around cte forums half the heli-whiners talk about nerfing or removing lockons from the game . 
  * maa - too op , nerf pls, 
  * stigla - remove this lockon noob crap, 
  * sraw - too easy , nerf pls, 
  ^ cte helicopter feedback forums in a nutshell . 
  dices reaction is to massively ** buff ** the helis ( all of them ) - agility stats and limits - and ** nerf ** sraw * at the same time * . 
  because pushing the heli patch out and seeing how it goes with the ** real community ** ( not that 100 people on cte , 10 of which are being listened to ) and then deciding to nerf sraw or not , that ... now that would just make too much sense . 
  we ca n't have sense here , we 're dice after all . 
  while i agree with the bitching part , show me a single instance of the game being skewed towards more powerful infantry as far as air vs infantry goes . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but i do n't remember any change that would make the infantry more powerful against air vehicles . 
  the rapist here . 
  i can confirm that networking feels abnormally difficult to accomplish . 
  i really like the ** explanation group 2 , possibility 3 . 
  we are already closing in on the ability to scan human brain , mind upload is the next logical step ( if we do n't create a technological singularity first and it deems our brains crappy , but that would also be just a next step in the evolution of life , so it does n't matter ) . 
  once you 're at that point , nothing stops you from continuing to `` upgrade '' your brain capacity far beyond the rate at which the human brain would develop by the process of evolution ( in fact , it is possible we 're actually [ losing intelligence ] ( http://www.livescience.com/24713-humans-losing-intelligence.html ) because of the lack of evolutionary pressure ) ... not to mention that any biological brain is ultimately limited by the speed of electrochemical processes ( ~ 150 meters per second ) , but the electronic one is not ( speed of light , or 2 million times faster ) . 
  once intelligent life gets to the point of not being limited by biological evolution , things will change real fast . 
  this is directly tied to the possibility 6 , possibility 8 and possibility 9 . 
  you violated my mother . 
  yes , in the reference frame of the ship , that 's correct . 
  the ultimate limit will always be the amount of fuel you have . 
  afaik even with matter-antimatter annihilation efficiency , you ca n't get far beyond 50 % of the speed of light . 
  however in the reference frame of the observer ( e.g. 
  you on earth ) , when the ship uses an unit of fuel it gets a lower speed boost in the earth frame than it does in the ship frame . 
  this is due to relativistic changes affecting any moving object . 
  to accelerate a ship to c would require infinite time with finite acceleration or infinite acceleration for a finite amount of time . 
  here 's a handy calculator : http://www.1728.org/reltivty.htm ( input the speed , e.g. 
  0.9 and click ` c ' = 1 ), 
  if you want to know more , start here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/special_relativity :p, 
  yeah i 'll need a source for that ... 
   why make them do useless things to `` earn '' a living ? 
  this was the end goal of technology all along , to free us from the bullshit !, 
  this can never work in an ( unregulated ) capitalism . 
  especially if the government is just another company ( that is easily influenced by private capital ) . 
  in such a society , the benefits of new technologies will always trickle down to the `` peasants '' last , while the negatives will hit them first ( loss of manual labor jobs ) . 
   besides , it would be much easier to just shove us into `` shelters '' and let us die off . 
  that could happen . 
  if things go belly up , how many detroits do you think could we see ? 
   everyone just running mines instead, 
  if even that . 
  most people use the repair tool now . 
  mines are pretty much removed from the game ( compared to the pre-nerf usage ) . 
  `` while i do n't deny that there is ** some practice ** required to attain a ** perfect shot ** with ** every ** rocket '' - the guy in the video . 
  but i knew that already from 0:35 ... hvm ?
