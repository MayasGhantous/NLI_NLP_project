  the whole company 's bussiness model is ** based on ** clickbait . 
  vox/verge/polygon . 
  outside of gawker , there are not that many comparable cesspools of yellow journalism . 
  i 'll admit that i 've said a few `` faggots '' myself during the first few months of year + spent with the game ( oddly enough , i do n't use homophobic slurs irl since i have nothing against gay people , so i guess i learned that from the community :p ) , but even though a few instances of this childish behavior occurred ... 
  i would never wish cancer upon somebody . 
  what a terrible thing to say . 
  you do n't even know if they have cancer history in the family or if they have it themselves !, 
  i mean i get that people tend to vent if they 're mad ( and there are usually no repercussions for doing so in the game 's chat ) and some offensive language gets used , but this is fucking heartless . 
  important notes for someone learning the game :, 
  * do not mash the button . 
  just take your time and when the qte icon shows up , press f once . 
  it could still fail ( thanks to the netcode/lag ) , but if you mash the button like mad , it will fail every time . 
  * you can only counter-knife while being attacked from the front . 
  therefore , do n't knife from the front yourself :p, 
  i envy your patience lol, 
   does anybody know what 's the motivation with the ace23 change ? 
  all your questions will be answered by this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6l10qi2sia,

  the link is a lie !, 
  enjoy it while you can . 
  if it keeps growing , it 's only a matter of time before the admins ban it for some bullshit reason . 
  they even talk about the ucav without knowing they actually talk about its airburst unlock ( which most people do n't have ) . 
  i 'm all for removing the ucav from the game but the idea that these people who just * barely * know what they 're talking about can influence the game scares me . 
  `` yeah i got killed by that once '' ... 
   good . 
  helicopters are skilled vehicles that require awareness and teamwork . 
  they should n't be something an average player can just jump into and dominate with . 
  totally agree . 
  also , these guys are the last people you 'd want to listen to as far as anything air-related goes . 
  the 3 accounts you listed have around whopping 400 kills with air vehicles , * combined * . 
  i can only get so erect ... 
  it was meant to be a realistic * dream * sequence . 
  the dream is a nightmare fuelled by the guy 's past and the dog 's licking is interrupting the terror in a way that would probably be pretty normal * in a dream * . 
  comic relief .

  one of the best video game experiences ever . 
  i almost puked a little ... 
  change it to dannyonpcin1080p for that extra bit of originality ... 
  i was expecting a nice sraw , but i 'll take this too . 
  well at least they did . 
  the japanese never apologized for anything and as far as their history teachers are concerned , there were no japanese war crimes in the wwii . 
  `` those who fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors are destined to repeat them . '', 
  i do e-sports too !, 
  i masturbate to online porn so often and so vigorously , i could throw discus with my right hand . 
   you do n't have to hoop jump through the phantom program, 
  yeah ok so we agree the process is retarded . 
  awesome . 
  now tell your boss ( who i 'm sure is responsible for this ) that we agreed he 's a pain in the ass . 
  i will really need to see some more details about the campaign and its length before i jump in . 
  $ 50 is aaa production level of money for a game ( at least on the pc ) . 
  if the game 's mp is pretty much doa due to the lack of marketing ( which seems to be the case , sadly ) , then you ca n't really rely on the mp to carry the game . 
  lol , that 's hilarious & pathetic at the same time if true, 
  it appears so . 
  1700 hours and battle reports set private . 
  brace yourself , mid-rank crisis is coming . 
  i thought consoles have aim assist no ? 
   you could say he deserved everything until . . lets say 0:58, 
  i disagree . 
  he started the fight and even though the defense may seem inappropriate , it 's not . 
  the guy defending himself had no weapon . 
  in such a situation , he could either run away or fight until he incapacitated the enemy . 
  the reality of these things is that you ca n't allow the enemy to retaliate . 
  the situation may be different if the enemy started to yell `` i give up '' , but even at that point you ca n't be sure that he means it . 
  there is a point where appropriate defense turns into inappropriate defense or vengeance and i 'd say that is at 1:08 in the video ( the guy is unconscious or at least does not appear to intelligently defend himself ) . 
  * but * you have to remember that this is not ufc ( where a referee would step in now ) , but a irl fight between two parties that do not exactly appear to be seasoned fighters and just the adrenaline rush will keep you going for longer that you otherwise would . 
  but but but u were in the lelvolution area !, 
  therefore you must die xd,

  and ? 
  it 's a game in development , two months from release ... do n't drag your pathetic hate boner for sms/pcars to this sub . 
  jesus , your hate must be going deep ... digging in a public topic from 2011 to prove your `` point '' . 
  all this bs is hearsay and what is n't can easily be explained by ea suits demanding what ea suits demand ( e.g. 
  dumbing stuff down ) . 
  if this sub is going to shit on developers ( because a random person is mad ... what 's next ? 
  banned cs cheaters complaining about valve ? ), 
  instead of the media ( especially with these ridiculous claims ) , then maybe it will be better if the reddit admins shut this place down . 
  is this sub about hating video games and pathetic sim racing squabbles now ? 
  op wrote the blog and has a history of pcars hate . 
  do n't touch this shit . 
  i do n't say this often , but get a life ( check out my post history , if you want ... 
  i do n't think i 've ever used it before ) . 
  were you banned on wmd or something ? 
  so much hate , you must be a sad , lonely fucker . 
   driveclub does look better . 
  it does . 
  and your point is ? 
   they should push the gameplay in project cars instead of the graphics . 
  they do . 
  it 's designed to run at 60fps , even on consoles ( unlike driveclub ) . 
   anyone else find it suspicious that someone who never posted on kia before does this in two different threads ? 
  maybe there 's a misunderstanding going on , but are you talking to me ? 
  because if you do , i suggest you start using your glasses and look through my post history or shut your mouth . 
  i not only post here regularly , i also made some threads and i subbed x months ago . 
   i have spent more than a few hours of frustration to unlock certain weapons while playing the game . 
  and ? 
  complain about that to dice and maybe they 'll stop making a mess of the unlocking process in the next game . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , all weapons of a given class should be unlocked from the start . 
  if someone boosts or asks friends to help with an assignment , i do n't mind . 
  btw you 're all up in arms about this but the fact that you can ** buy ** a weapons shortcut for money does n't bother you ? 
   too lazy , too cheap , or too bad at the game to do things normally,
