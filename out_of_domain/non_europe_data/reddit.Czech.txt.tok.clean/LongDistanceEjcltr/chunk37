  or maybe the have lives outside of the game . 
  many people disagree with the grinding requirements for certain weapons and gadgets or requirements that have nothing to do with the regular playing of the game . 
  some of the assignments are borderline idiotic . 
   cte is getting a little bit out of hand, 
  i 'm saying this for months . 
  nah , it 's the `` do n't mess with the core shooting gameplay too much a year and half after the release '' approach . 
  this kind of ace pilots then complains about the sraw . 
   makes project cars look like a ps2 game, 
  yeah ... no . 
  it makes it look better than any other racing game except driveclub . 
  driveclub 's graphics are hands down the best i 've ever seen anywhere , and i 'm a pc gamer . 
  i 've been drooling over the rain in that game from the start and it is pretty much the only game i regret i 'll never play because i do n't do consoles ( well ... maybe except bloodborne ) . 
  but then again , project cars is running at 60fps even on consoles and unlike driveclub , it is hands down one of the best racing simulations on the market . 
  nice,

  chris , there is no way to do this without performance loss . 
  you mention unreal engine and a camera rendering to a texture , but that still requires [ extra processing ] ( https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/int/resources/contentexamples/reflections/1_7/index.html ) . 
  not much , but it does . 
  of course , the higher the resolution of the render target texture , the lower the performance . 
  i 'm not an artist nor i tried to make an actual scope , but 256x256 looks pretty bad , 512x512 appears to be fine for a screen coverage of a small-ish scope , 1024x1024 inflicts a significant performance drop . 
  i would imagine that 512x512 would not be enough for a large sniper scope ( large as in taking a lot of screen space ) that does n't limit your peripheral vision . 
  but it 's true that this could easily be configurable in the graphics options menu . 
  welcome to 2008 !, 
  ( which , funnily enough , is about as may times as i 've seen this reposted over the years . ), 
  meanwhile / u/tiggr and co. spend most of their time with the balancing of * infantry * combat ( where nobody even asked for most of the changes ) and making night maps ( which is nice , but about as useful as a blanket to a dead man if the vanilla 3d spotting stays in those maps ) . 
  inb4 polonium poisoning ... ayy, 
  yeeeeeey , more of assaultfield 4 ... 
  btw i swear that bf4 has the highest number of useless gadgets in any multiplayer game ever . 
  here 's an extensive list of useful gadgets of a support player :, 
  * ammo bag, 
  slow clap . 
   it 's not a game of skill , but who sees who first . 
  so it 's like in real life infantry combat then ? 
  but on a more serious note , low time to kill forces you to think before you act & rewards map knowledge . 
  i never liked the bf4 's patched in reduced damage model where the mid-rpm guns just feel like paintball toys . 
  insurgency , arma . 
  i 'd like to see more of that . 
  ( hell , even counter-strike time to kill is just a few bullets . ), 
  balance that out with more recoil . 
  if you 've been put off by mediocre reviews or videos from the beginning of the game , give the game a second chance . 
  i think it has one of the most unfortunate ability unlock trees out there as it really limits your gameplay options for a big portion of the game . 
  once you get to the second town ( which is beautiful by the way ) and get the grappling hook , faster parkour animations and infinite stamina , the game * really * opens up and the parkour transforms from a chore to a seamless , fun activity . 
  not my video . 
  i wanted to show how the game feels like in the 2nd town to a friend ( coworker ) and after a lot of searching i found this vid . 
  almost all review and trailer videos exclusively show the first town and extremely limited parkour . 
  this video is by far the most mobile and `` flowing '' representation of the game i found at that point of time . 
  the feminist angle gives it that edge when if the comment is good , most people tend to not get it and many of them even start to argue with you and try to explain why you 're wrong ( which is - i think - the biggest point ; the typical reddit neckbeard tipfedora angle is simply not as effective in this regard ) . 
  i find it hilarious !, 
  your posts often manage to balance * just * on the the edge of `` you ca n't be serious '' line , but not beyond it . 
  it 's ridiculous , but not * that * far from something an ignorant , feminist extremist * could * say . 
  first time i see these ( did n't know symthic had bfh stats already ) . 
  k10 @ 1200rpm @ 34dmg ... o_o and you know what ? 
  it feels that way . 
  i mean , up close ... that thing just absolutely annihilates anything and everything in its path . 
  make the rpg not ohk . 
  let 's make it 75 % damage , * at least * against `` reinforced chassis '' unlock . 
  like it is against the transport chopper . 
  and then you can have the battle pickup smaw ( which has only one rocket and there are only one or two on the map ) do 100 % damage . 
  on the other hand , i 'd be careful to not make the vehicles too tanky , because that would make the mode less exciting imo . 
  two rpg shots should still kill any vehicle ( except for a tank , which are not present in hardline ) . 
  that 's a great graphics card !, 
  i 'd give it a 3.5 / 4 . 
   hardline just does n't offer me the battlefield experience . 
  that 's exactly the reason why i like it . 
  it offers a little bit different experience , while still having familiar basics and shooting mechanics in general . 
  there * is * room for a less vehicle-heavy battlefield game . 
  as evidenced by the 6 million people who tried the hardline beta . 
  cs : go offers a completely different experience than any battlefield . 
  battlefield 's gameplay is based on instant gratification ( most of the time ) and very fast respawns , compare that to cs which is very tactical and the downtime between lives is a whole round . 
  skill cap is somewhere else . 
  map size is somewhere else etc. 
  etc. , yeah i know , i 'm being captain obvious here , but when i see people saying `` if i want an infantry focused game i play cs : go '' in a bf4 subreddit , i just have to shake my head . 
  i mean , these games do * not * compete . 
  you can play both , one or neither , but that does n't change the fact that they offer different experiences . 
  you spin me right round , baby, 
  right round like a record , baby, 
  right round round round, 
  ( could n't resist opening dogespin.info :d ), 
  does it have to be so far ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwzwkvtgpsq&amp;t=35s ? 
  i did like it . 
  but do n't tell anyone , we low skilled scrubs should just gtfo . 
  but if fires with 1200rpm and 100dmg max ( w/o body armor ) in real life so what the hell ... :d ... ok , imma let myself out now, 
   in bf4 i would somtimes look at an enemy and be like : `` nah hes too far away '', 
  wow , you put that so nicely , i could n't say it better myself ; of course there will always be people talking about `` skill '' and all that bullshit but the fact is that the current retail bf4 has the highest ttk of all the battlefield games ever made ( especially if you are taking into account dodgy netcode , retarded shotgun hip spread , defensive perk , under-powered minigun and piss poor hmgs o tanks ) and there are situations in the game where you see an enemy in a not so far distance running across the street outside of any cover and you just do n't engage , because you know you either ca n't kill him or it will take you a whole mag to do so . 
  it just fucks with the basic fps gameplay , all the `` but muh skill '' retards can just go fuck themselves . 
  go play cs : go and let the battlefield games be battlefield games . 
  bf2 had like 50dmg for tank hmgs ( edit : apparently it was up to [ 100 damage ] ( http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/m2_browning#battlefield_2 ) for the browning and 50 for the [ coaxials ] ( http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/coaxial_machine_gun#battlefield_2 ) ... which is funny because mounted lmgs use ar damage model in bf4 lol ) and [ 3 ( body ) shot kill ] ( http://www.oligny.com/games.bf2_weapons.php ) for some battle rifles . 
  give us a fucking rest already . 
  the obsession with all the random bullshit around the game , all the easter egg hunts and dog tag hunts and valentine camo and jeep stuff ( boo fucking hoo ) are fucking pathetic . 
  instead of demanding proper fixes of long lasting issues and serious improvements , you get distracted by a stupid carrot on a stick . 
  every time i see a jackfrags `` easter egg hunt '' video ( and similar crap ) posted here , i cringe . 
  yes , you can . 
  it will run fine ( but of course , we 're talking about low details here , 1080p w/o aa ) , maybe even 60fps ( depending on the map and the number of players ) . 
  it generally runs better than bf4 and the loading times are just night and day difference ( as in 5 times faster in hardline compared to bf4 ... and i play from a ssd ) . 
  watch [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjh01zyp078 ) , set up the game according to that and see how many fps you get . 
  well , i would suggest to pirate it and try it in the sp campaign , but i do n't know which versions are available and the engine had like a million patches since the release ( many of which are in hardline ) , so i 'm not sure how much will that help you ... but it should be generally running much better now than it did at release ( new gpu drivers also help ) . 
  on the other hand , the cpu gets much less work to do in sp than in mp , so there 's also that ( you could get bottlenecked by the cpu in 64 player games ) . 
  as for bf3 , that is quite a bit less demanding than bf4 , at least in my experience . 
  so i would n't rely on it in this case .
