  edit : it 's weird that game time does n't work for you . 
  it should https://www.origin.com/en-ie/store/free-games/game-time ... did you try to create a new , throwaway origin account ? 
  i mean , anything is possible ( bf games are highly configurable , did you try to drop your config user.cfg from bf4 into bfh ? 
  ) , so you you may be right ... to confirm i 'm not talking crap , i looked and found this :, 
   performance-wise , we ca n't really compare the two as we have n't bechmarked bf4 's multiplayer . 
  for whatever it 's worth , our single player bf4 benchmark pushes frame rates considerably lower than what we saw in hardline . 
   for now , hardline does n't seem any more demanding than 2013 's battlefield 4 , so most fans wo n't have a reason to upgrade . 
   i got around 24 for hardline and 34 on high , i get about 70fps in bf4 high 1080p aa off, 
  then there 's definitely something wrong with your setup/drivers/config etc. , that 's * not * normal . 
  http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/958/bench/1920.png , which gpu do you have ? 
  jesus christ , that is one hell of a necro post / u/angrycommie !, 
  no , you 're not , there are just way too many a song of ice and fire book series fans too blind to see that most of game of thrones television series is not that great on its own ( and your enjoyment of it is heavily influenced by the / lack of / knowledge of the books ) . 
  it 's almost like a fucking religion . 
   the story does n't really hold anywhere close to quality of got . 
  what do you mean ? 
  the books or the tv series ? 
  because if you did n't read the books , the tv series is `` good '' at best and some could easily say it 's one of the worse hbo productions as far as narrative goes . 
  it simply does n't hold up that well on its own . 
  and ? 
  your point is ? 
  it 's clearly not fit for life and will only be a burden to its parents . 
  ( and this is / r/wtf , not / r/aww ), 
  napalm would work better imo . 
  the child will have to suffer its whole life because the parents are selfish fucks . 
  humans are the only species on this planet that do this , keep offspring around even though it has no chance of living a normal human life . 
  actually , my mother is a selfish swine . 
  it ' z only smellz . 
  hitman absolution key : rtbbk-bl983-0l86w ( already had it ), 
  np , thanks , 
  it 's fine . 
  but do tell your ea overlords that [ day-one dlc ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urqy-x4uqsu ) is not fine . 
  before you buy it , watch this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkhdrngaqz0, 
   90 % of the stuff in this video is silly ocd stuff that people wo n't notice, 
  so changing the entire visual feel of the game is `` silly ocd stuff '' ? 
  i played the original game while i was a kid and one of the main features of the game that i distinctly remember is that griminess , the game 's backgrounds and the dark atmosphere they helped to deliver . 
  this is completely gone in the new game . 
  it 's funny how that guy is still very much around at ea ( at least according to one / u/tiggr tweet ) , but the botched launch ( and all the jokes that came with it ) pretty much ended the pr part of his career . 
  ( not that he gives a crap , especially with all those ea shares sold at a high price just before the launch :p . ), 
  their koksan 170mm self-propelled guns have an estimated range of 40-60 km . 
  also , they have short range rocket artillery ( e.g. 
  70 km frogs w / 500kg payload ) , short range ballistic missiles with potential chemical/biological warheads ( e.g. 
  70 km scarabs w / 500kg payload or 500 km scud variants w / 800 kg payload ) and are also capable of delivering a 10-40 kiloton nuclear warhead via one of their short or mid-range missiles . 
  their military is a one trick pony , but in this case , you ca n't beat geography . 
  btw the current state of their long-range rocket technology is unknown , but they [ did reach the orbit ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unha ) , so keep that in mind . 
  they may be incredibly poor as a nation , but they 're definitely no joke ( at least as far as south korea is concerned ) . 
  one year ago , i 'd probably take what she 's saying with a grain of salt , but the whole drama around gamergate or feminism topics on wikipedia only exposed how easy it really is to do this kind of thing and how hard it is to fix it . 
  their system is flawed and the people in charge are ridiculously hard to get rid of , even if they 're clearly doing a bad job . 
  it 's like a small , online politic ecosystem ( including the corruption and all the other bullshit that comes with it ) . 
  `` is this worth getting ? '', 
  do you like multiplayer fps games ? 
  * yes : how the hell do n't you have it already ??? 
  * no : no , it 's not worth it . 
  seriously though , i think paying $ 6.5 for potentially hundreds of hours of fun is a pretty good deal ... 
   how can an adult act like that ? 
  age does n't mean shit . 
  some people just suck . 
  am i the only one not exactly looking forward to * yet another * wave of weapon re-balance ? 
   and you really ca n't just let that slide , you know ? 
  sure you can . 
  i like this new community focus of ea ( bf4 cte and bfh betas ) and now ubisoft . 
   there are other more profitable methods of making isk, 
  go on ... :p, 
  hardline will suffer the same fate , but even sooner than bf4 thanks to battlefront 3 ... * unless * ea decides to make premium free for all owners of the base game some time in the near future . 
  and * even then * , it 's not guaranteed since battlefront is the next big game from dice ( i.e. 
  not a bf4 expansion - and you can say hardline is not an expansion all you want , but the fact is that the engine is the same , the ui is the same , many of the sounds are the same , physics quirks are the same , a lot of gameplay mechanics are the same ... ) and if they do n't fuck it up , hardline will be dead in 6 months no matter what . 
  anyways ... paying for maps = splitting up the player base = faster death of the game . 
  not that ea cares since their product model ( new mp shooter every year ) does n't really fit with the extended product longevity model . 
   battlefront is still some year or more off, 
  yeah , sure . 
  the game releases holiday 2015 : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/star_wars:_battlefront_ ( 2015_video_game ) . 
  its entire point of existence is that ea hopes the movie 's hype will help with the sales . 
  that alone shatters the rest of your argument . 
   dustbowl during a sandstorm is chaotic beauty man . 
  this is a full feature game, 
  you do n't have to sell the game to me . 
  [ i already have it , including premium ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ftvg7ky.png ) . 
  i 'm just stating the obvious ( well , obvious to any unbiased 3rd party ) . 
  * dice stockholm includes the core frostbite team . 
  major upgrades to the engine will be made in dice stockholm games . 
  * battlefront 3 only comes out on the new consoles and pc . 
  that * alone * makes it able to be an order of magnitude better looking than previous frostbite titles . 
  and it 's not just graphics , the animation quality and quantity and the level of destruction suffers tremendously in all frostbite games that are available on the old-gen consoles ( the devs ca n't do stuff that does n't fit into last gen console tiny ram - current gen and pc suffer as a result because unless it 's related * just * to the rendering , you ca n't really scale it up ) . 
  * the engine moved to pbr [ recently ] ( http://www.frostbite.com/2014/11/moving-frostbite-to-pbr/ ) and battlefront 3 is transitioning to that right now ( it is not feasible to use pbr - and similar modern rendering techniques - if the game has last-gen versions as you 'd basically have to make two separate games ) . 
  you can call it frostbite 3.1 , 3.5 or 4 , but it sure as hell is not the same engine as bf4/bfh/dai use . 
  i do n't get it ... somebody enlighten me ? 
  i use chrome beta . 
  this stupid thing is annoying as fuck . 
  nope . 
  using firefox for battlelog for now : /, 
  [ uprise ] ( http://uprise.se/ ) , get your shit together !, 
  colossal dumbass x, 
  my origin language is czech . 
  i bought the game by using the russian origin store ( used a vpn ) . 
  now the only available languages for me to install are either russian and polish . 
  not czech . 
  not nice . 
  thankfully , i know polish a bit , but it 's still annoying . 
  but fuck you ea , i downloaded the pirated version and copied en pack from there !, 
  this kills the linux . 
  easiest rpg kill ever .
