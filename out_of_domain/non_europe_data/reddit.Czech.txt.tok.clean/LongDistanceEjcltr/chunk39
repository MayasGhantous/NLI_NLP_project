  edit , to the guy who deleted his post : the transport heli flies so close , slow and * predictably * that any decent player would hit it if the opportunity like this presented itself . 
  which it almost never does , at least not on the pc . 
  have you tried hitting a decent pilot in post-patch bf4 ( latest retail ) ? 
  that shit is hard . 
  is this the first competitive game with progression mechanic ( and rentable servers ) you 've ever played ? 
  because it seems that way . 
  btw does this actually bother you ? 
  i played ~ 800 hours of bf4 , but it never occured to me to think `` gosh , i wish that guy was n't 140 yet '' ... 
  i mean , most of the basic weapons are pretty good ( if not one of the one of best ) guns in the game . 
   it 's fine if you want to unlock all the guns easily . 
  ( buy premium ) . 
  huh . 
  did they include something i do n't know about ? 
  800 hours of bf4 here . 
  i agree with him . 
  people who care about stat padding are themselves looking at the stats way too much . 
  the only important metric is your point count at the end of the round in combination with the actual benefit to the team . 
  is sound . 
  stat padding ! = cheating . 
  this is not a mmorpg . 
  irrc the fastest guy to 150 in beta was doing just that .

  whatever , one of two unguided launchers . 
  and if we 're going to mess with the details , then i say it 's even easier , since smaw flies faster than rpg and has less of an arc . 
   still not easy to take out helis . 
  especially if you have to aim with [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yhw4lxe.png ) instead of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aot6bf0.png ) . 
  hello !, 
  fucking mantis shrimp , man !, 
   i 'm just glad creatures like this are n't bigger . 
  yeah . 
  thankfully we have [ the laws of physics ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/square-cube_law ) taking care of that :p, 
   what is up with that pessimism ? 
  oh i do n't know , maybe the launch and a half of bf4 's existence has something to do with that . 
  not you , god dammit . 
  i really wish reddit had a block user button :(, 
  dem reused assets :p, 
  i do n't hate you . 
  i just do n't like you and i do n't want to read your stuff . 
  that 's all . 
  i 'm pretty sure he was talking about the small one in the background . 
  my expert opinion : fuck no . 
  now that 's some determination !, 
  i see what you did there , ed [ :p ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/151/tumblr_inline_n327sfudu01r3x7o0.jpg ), 
  ed comes to the rescue !, 
  ed is a great place . 
  even if it 's great just because there are no other no holds barred satyrical wikis out there . 
  i find it offensive , disgusting but occasionally funny with some flashes of brilliance . 
  anything that 's not illegal is fine with me . 
  some content certainly crosses the line into pure bad taste , but that 's just what you get when you let people edit pages and have no rules ( well , except no ~ ~ pc ~ ~ cp , no bestiality and no revenge porn ) . 
  yeah , lol, 
  bf4 is more popular ( on the pc ) than hardline . 
  http://bf4stats.com peak 24h 33,005, 
  while your comment is somewhat funny , i ca n't really see how anyone can not orient themselves in `` female anatomy '' after seeing even a few pornos ... 
  i mean ... it 's not rocket science . 
  well , that was awesome . 
   risk destabilising the bbc, 
  ha haha hahaha , i hate to burst your bubble , but that ship has sailed already, 
  what a stellar video . 
  great analysis , thanks !, 
  by `` dying '' you mean more played than hardline ? 
  on the pc , bfh is * less * popular than bf4 , 20k vs 35k ( ! ) . 
  even the console versions of bfh are shedding players like crazy . 
  the current estimate is ~ 215k players of bfh and ~ 140k players of bf4 across all platforms . 
  hardly a dying community . 
  if it started just recently then i 'd install older drivers ( one version or two ) and see the results . 
  btw it 's not that `` battlefield down clocks your gpu '' , your drivers down clock your gpu for some reason . 
  try running furmark + prime95 ( and by + i mean at the same time ) and i bet the gpu will down clock the same . 
  what the fuck am i reading . 
  let 's gtfo out of here before more braindead people show up . 
  many idiots in this thread . 
  what does clarkson have to do with any of this ? 
  when i read stuff like `` he created an army of goons '' or that he should make statements , i cringe so hard , it 's physically painful . 
  let 's say this is real and credible . 
  top gear was being watched by hunderds of millions of people , of course there will be all kinds of hooligans , crazy people , murderers , child rapists , terrorists etc. 
  in such a large group . 
  for fuck sake , it 's like 1/25th of the * entire human population * !, 
  not to mention that a considerable amount of people actually worked on tg in all the different regions and tvs and these people may have been laid off . 
  not to mention that , as we learned in the drama surrounding gamergate , many of the actual threats are made by 3rd party trolls . 
  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/technology/ellen-pao-kleiner-perkins-case-decision.html - the whole article is written in such a spirit . 
   episodes of men behaving badly make the news frequently here , whether it is sexism or harassment in the workplace or just derogatory attitudes toward women . 
  critics are increasingly drawing a straight line between such behavior and the small percentage of women who are engineers and executives , and the even smaller percentage of women who are venture capitalists . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** she lost , but `` defendants who win in court sometimes lose in the world outside it '' and men are bad and because men are bad there are no women in tech, 
  fun fact : there is a us$ 16 billion * fusion * research reactor under construction in france , with the first plasma expected in 2020 and full deuterium-tritium fusion experiments starting in 2027 . 
   context, 
  context is everything , at least in this case . 
  i would do the same as the cop . 
  that fuck in the wheel chair was in the wheel chair purely because he was drunk/drugged out of his mind and he attacked the cop first !, 
  sure the cop could have stopped sooner , but that 's arguable and largely a matter of opinion . 
  look at the video / u/zoniako posted ... this gif is clearly an infamatory clickbait to make people mad while the reality is completely different, 
   four punches did n't seem within reason, 
  on the other hand , some may argue the dude could have been tased or shot ( because at the end of the day , he did not listen to the cop and began to assault the cop ) , so a bit of ass whoppin ' is probably one of the happier endings this situation could have been resolved by . 
  ah the good ole reddit cop hate boner !, 
  sure we did . 
   pummel the ever-living shit out of him, 
  lesson learned : do n't attack cops . 
  besides , i can assure you that `` pummel the ever-living shit out of him '' would look very different . 
   threaten to arrest the completely innocent girl ( who was the person being harrassed in the first place ) for simply saying `` whoa !, 
  dude , '', 
  first : irrelevant . 
  second : interfering with arrest can get you arrested .
