  the increased damage model on ace 52 is very noticeable at anything but cq distances ( where you 'll get out-damaged by all high-rof weapons ) . 
  i think it 's definitely one of the best carbines . 
  yup , and compared to similar damage producing scar-h , you have more rounds per mag . 
  ** yes ** !!, 
  m240b + compensator ( or muzzle brake if you feel the vertical recoil is too much ) + potato + tap fire = heaven, 
  320 smoke has a tiny smoke poof , it 's almost like a fart ... 
  as for the smoke grenades , you have 3 and if you 're close to your ammo box , you can spam them , completely smoking out an area ( there 's still the spot bug , but most noobs do n't know about it/don ' t use it ... ) - very essential on rush, 
  who gives a shit about legal gray areas ? 
  if a law tells you to kill off your parents at 60 , because the economy requires it , will you do it ? 
  what 's up with this stupid sheep-like behavior ... 
  it 's exactly as / u/stormkorp says , `` does n't matter . 
  it 's not a moral gray area . '', 
  one step forward , twenty back . 
  remake the game ? 
  [ relevant ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1vnv2i/the_long_awaited_r20_patchnotes_are_here_it_only/ ), 
  i 'll admit , yours is better , lol . . 
  lelvolution, 
  yeah , with his golden parachute ... 
  you know , this is one of the biggest problems with the game right now , but i have yet to see any acknowledgement from dice that it exists and that it 's going to be fixed . 
  great , another battlenoob complaining about complaining ... 
  the main problem with dmrs is their weirdly balanced recoil , or to be precise , their high ~ 2.0 first shot recoil combined with slow 6 \u00b0 / s recoil decrease . 
  the sar-21 , for example , recovers from recoil 200 % faster ( 18 \u00b0 / s vs 6 \u00b0 / s ) and scar-h 100 % faster ( 12 \u00b0 / s vs 6 \u00b0 / s ) than mk11 mod0 . 
  this makes dmrs underpowered because the time between accurate shots is huge given the fact that you have to hit the ( usually mobile ) target 4 times . 
  i 'm quite sure that tap-firing scar-h w / hb and acog makes for a better dmr than most dmrs in the game . 
  aaand you can also defend yourself far better at closer ranges with scar-h than with any dmr . 
  i really do n't know what made dice , or / u/demize99 specifically , think that making dmrs 4 shot-to-kill weapons ( at their usable ranges anyway ) is a good idea . 
  you either need to make dmrs more `` spammable '' ( and by that i mean faster recoil recovery , the rpm stat means nothing since you wont hit a fucking titanic at max rpm ) or more powerful ( 3 shot instead of 4 shot kill ) . 
  they definitely do not need to be more accurate , as they already have the highest accuracy of all weapons ( except for bolt action snipers ) . 
  my vote goes to 3 shot kill at any range , which means at least 34dmg per shot ( 36dmg including defensive spec ) . 
  knifes :p, 
  such physics , much real , wow, 
  i do n't think you understood , of course i mean minimum damage . 
  * mvp ribbons, 
  * ace squad ribbons, 
  * m-com attacker ribbons, 
  * bomb delivery ribbons, 
  is a stellar basis you can build on ... but it wo n't make your game suddenly look terrific by itself . 
  just look at state of decay - a cryengine 3 title that looks awful . 
  * to soon, 
  * dice, 
  i wanted to write exactly this , but i guess now i do n't have to . 
  i will say though , that all this early access stuff is going to end really bad in the long run . 
  do n't do it . 
  well , you 'd better accept it , because it 's here to stay ... 
  poor autobalance scripts and weapon ban lists is what 's killing the servers . 
  btw a random team-switching guy is what gets you mad ? 
  what about all the cheaters ? 
  dude ... 
  i expect some fireworks !, 
  yay . . :d, 
  whoa , that 's * dice * y, 
  soldier radar ... sweet, 
  this is the most infuriating thing about the whole ordeal ... clueless people telling me , a person ( which happens to program web apps for a living ) on a 100/100 link to check my internet connection . 
  i see this again and again and again . 
  the real reson is that the server software is fubar , which is especially apparent on 64 player servers on poor hardware or rarely rebooted servers . 
  sounds kind of obvious , does n't it ? 
  the problem was that you could fire before the game actually recognized that the ads animation has finished playing ... and this shot had terrible ( lowest possible ) accuracy . 
   there is still a delay to achieve full accuracy , so quick scoping is still not possible . 
  it 's just what it says . 
  and it makes sense ( ads is not instant ) . 
  noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, 
  bug ? 
  ace23 's problem is that a `` well balanced jack of all trades , master of none '' weapon will always be favored by good players thanks to its versatility and so this will skew the percentage of kills in favor of such weapon ( and therefore it will seem overpowered to the less skilled 3/4 of the player base ) .

  yes , same guy . 
  yep, 
  if there is going to be another bf release ~ 8 months from now , bf4 is my last battlefield game . 
  it means the '' '' '' `` netcode '' '' '' '' sucks . 
  smb is difficult , but mostly fair . 
  i like that difficulty . 
  it 's how difficulty is supposed to be handled - to push you into improving your skills . 
  not so much . 
  the skill improving part is padded with hours of boring stuff . 
  it 's difficult and unfair . 
  its unfairness and frustrating elements are stemming from some weird design decisions ( unavoidable death traps , no story goals in the game and no clear rules , lots of meaningless backtracking ) , messy physics and animation engine etc. 
  the fact that you 've got so many upvotes only proves how clueless this subreddit is . 
  sraw is a skill-based weapon and double-sraw even more so . 
  you have no lock-ons and limited ammo . 
  what 's unfair ? 
  and more importantly , what 's next ? 
  make it so you ca n't counter-snipe snipers with it ? 
  i bet mostly noobs complain about this - since you have a pretty small chance of hitting a moving target with two rockets at once , you have to be stationary to be a good target . 
  besides , the double-sraw method was n't even used that often , since it requires a clear view and makes you vulnerable for quite some time because the first rocket is like a giant arrow pointing to your exact location . 
  it was a cool thing to do once in a while and they removed it . 
  ruining yet another fun little thing in the game . 
  i still hope this is a bug . 
  thanks dice,

  the real reason is that none of the higher-ups at ea/dice give a flying fuck about the game , probably assigning two and a half men to `` fix it '' . 
  it 's time to focus on titanfall and battlepolice , you know . 
  it 's not . 
  try it yourself , anything but a direct hit wo n't ohk . 
  they were either not at full health or there were explosives . 
   this is ea,
