   your ea support is still done by outsourced workers . 
  all ea did was give them better policies . 
  who gives a shit ? 
  i want decent customer support , i do n't care who is contracted to do it . 
  recommended tracks work very well too . 
  yes it is .

  the problem with bitcoin is that it 's useless as a ~ ~ micro-payment ~ ~ small payment tool and pretty bad as a currency . 
  it will never reach `` mainstream '' in its current form . 
  * ~ ~ micro-payment ~ ~ small payment tool : as soon as contactless credit cards started being widely accepted , bitcoin became completely obsolete as a ~ ~ micro-payment ~ ~ small payment tool . 
  and some may say that it was obsolete even before then . 
  what takes minutes ( at best ! ), 
  with bitcoin , takes seconds with a contactless credit card . 
  imagine waiting for 8 minutes ( average transaction confirmation time ) before your payment is accepted ... and the problem is that this is an issue rooted in the bitcoin protocol design itself , it wont change any time soon , not dramatically anyways . 
  * currency : while bitcoin does seem to be more stable recently , its market cap is actually pretty low , which means it 's still * very much * susceptible to manipulation . 
  big fishes in the bitcoin world do n't have to pour in billions to significantly affect the price . 
  so you have volatility . 
  now the second problem : it 's not easy to buy/sell bitcoins for fiat currency ( there is only a limited amount of exchanges , these exchanges require you to go trough many hoops , limit your ability to withdraw fiat and many of them are simply not trustworthy as the history showed us ) , it 's not easy to securely store your bitcoins ( compared to using a bank ) and it 's not easy to pay with bitcoins ( as the amount of vendors accepting bitcoins is extremely small ) . 
  so you have limited usability . 
  volatility + limited usability = bad currency . 
  that 's exactly how it works . 
  `` instant '' payment is only possible by just broadcasting the payment to the network and not waiting for any confirmations . 
  this means you can double spend . 
  so in effect , as far as the merchant is concerned , this is the same philosophy as going to the mall , take groceries for $ 35 and tell the cashier that you will pay once you get home . 
  `` i swear . 
  trust me . '', 
  maybe that 's fine for tiny amounts of money , but i 'd be really suprised if a grocery store would let you walk out with a full bag of items while your confirmation status is at 0/unconfirmed , especially if you 're not a regular customer . 
   why would anyone bother to wait 8 minutes for confirmation with a micro transaction ? 
  * 0 confirmations -  susceptible to double spending race attack . 
  * microtransactions can be tens or even hundreds of dollars . 
  ask parents of children with ipads . 
   micropayments, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micropayment - they can easily be tens or even hundreds of dollars . 
  it was originally meant as a small sum , but typical usage is way over $ 1 these days . 
  and in app purchases can be huge . 
  that 's true . 
  and maybe it was my fault even mentioning `` micro transation '' when in fact i meant `` a small transaction '' ( ~ 20usd e.g. 
  visa 's `` micro '' transaction ) . 
  a sum that 's much more frequent in day to day life ( buying groceries , fast food , paying in restaurants , buying small household goods , paying for movie tickets etc ), 
  you dirty conspiracy theorist !!, 
  what do you mean ? 
  crowfunding is a great thing . 
  i thought we had issues only with people abusing it by being a professional victim or not holding up their end of the bargain ( e.g. 
  25 % of the cut goes to the modder , 25 % goes to valve and 50 % goes to bethesda . 
  what a load of shit . 
  thankfully that mod has been shot down by a modder who made some of the mods this mod has been built on . 
  i honestly do n't think they care . 
  one of the good posts in the comments of that video :, 
   the people who say that this practice is legitimate are the same who wo n't mind loads of dlc , cut-content , on-disc dlc , season passes , micro-transactions , early access and the like . 
  please , do notice that all the previous examples have one thing in common : to detach you further away from your hard-earned money in exchange for an ever lesser service . 
   paid mods will result in legal conundrums of epic proportions since most dlc infringes on various ip copyrights at the same time , and with publishers meddling in a world previously untouched by corporate lawyers and legalese experts , we the gamers , in due time , will see our mods reduce in quality , variety and spectrum . 
   in due time , modders will also be substituted : from being enthusiastic fans who want to introduce new content to the games , to being money hungry prostitutes from poor countries who want a quick buck selling tasteless re-skins . 
  these new modders will whore themselves out to corporate interests in exchange for a meager 25 % . 
  yet again publishers win and we lose . 
   this new practice is completely outrageous , no matter how one looks at it . 
  the idea of paid mods is also against the spirit of entrepreneurship , voluntarism , and capitalism . 
  it symbolizes the ascension of monetarism , and the commoditization of every single aspect of content creation . 
  what a cunt . 
  fuck him . 
  keep calm and use nexus , then visit r/modpiracy for the rest !, 
  fuck the system , i welcome my 1 week ban . 
  games/comments/33qtxy / my_mod_for_cities_skylines_called_citycopter_is /, 
   for my part , this mod is free , and my posts explaining this fact were among the comments that were deleted . 
  so the modder 's own posts are spam , according to you . 
  ok . whatever floats your boat ... 
  the ama actually did n't change anything . 
  he just went `` so , yeah , we did that '' and said that he 'll look into the censoring ... so my stance is exactly the same as before . 
  because making games from scratch is fucking hard ( even if you use an existing engine ) , not to mention expensive and time consuming . 
  can you imagine how many horse genitalia could you remodel in the time it takes to make a simple indie game from scratch ? 
  lots . 
  and the amount of re-skins of armor and weapons you could make ? 
  even more ... 
  then there 's the question of * gameplay * . 
  mods rarely , if ever , add whole new * ways of play * , most of them are asset replacements and improvements and select few add functionality like better ui , new quests etc. 
  designing and balancing the core gameplay loop is half the battle in making a video game and it takes ages ( and luck , which usually stems from a lot of iteration so you get back to time ... and money ) . 
  that was amazing !, 
  ... and now i 'm sad : /, 
  no problem , i just saw an opportunity to post one of oatmeal 's comics :d nice design btw,

  let 's bring this realistic speed into the game and then we can all enjoy the delicious pilot tears xd, 
  the smim guy sounds biased to me . 
  look at how much the skyrim user review score dropped as a direct result of this clusterfuck . 
  you can only review titles on steam if you own them ** and ** play them . 
  which community is he talking about ? 
  the mod * making * community or the mod * consuming * community ? 
  because if we 're talking about the mod * consuming * community , then there is no question that an overwhelming majority of people did not support it and did not want it . 
  btw can you even `` harass '' a billion dollar company ? 
  that word is so overused . 
  but i guess it 's easy to blame those entitled gamers . 
  one other thing i do n't see being mentioned much is the issue of modders ( not ) being responsible for the product they sell . 
  `` ask politely and maybe they 'll fix it '' in an absolutely unacceptable official policy that is anti-consumer to the n-th degree . 
  edit : after listening to the whole thing ... 
  the `` harassment and terrorism '' part ( 1:06:10 ) is unbelievable .
