  so , consumer revolt is `` harassment and terrorism '' . 
  ah , so this is where the tartar sauce comes from !, 
  `` harassment and terrorism '' ( 1:06:10 ) ... damn you entitled gamers !, 
  the smim guy talked about `` harassment '' several times during the video , most of which ( all of them ? ), 
  had `` sending people death threats , bomb threats '' nowhere near them . 
  even the time i linked to does n't contain anything of the sort . 
  he literally says `` angry internet mob '' and right after that `` when you give in to harassment and terrorism '' , correlating the two . 
  * the angry internet mob terrorized valve into dropping it . 
  * that 's exactly what he said and i fucking double dare you to prove me wrong . 
  his whole rhetoric revolves around `` review bombing '' ( because you know , as a legitimate owner of the game and also a player of the game , how dare you edit your existing review or post a new review ) , `` entitlement '' and people `` harassing '' valve so they do x. 
   but we all know there are those that actually do harassment and threats . 
  that has absolutely zero to do with anything . 
  same argument as saying gamergate is bad because someone somewhere sent a death threat and identified himself/herself as a gamergate supporter ... it does n't make it true ( never underestimate what some trolls are capable of ) and , far more importantly , does n't make it relevant . 
  gabe got thousands of emails , how many of them were death threats ? 
  unless you can answer that ( and it 's a significant number ) , it 's absolutely pointless to even mention , let alone base your stance on such a thing . 
   i see nothing wrong with acknowledging the simple fact that this happened . 
  that 's not at all what 's happening in the interview/podcast . 
  read my other post in this thread . 
  soundcloud for life . 
  [ just cause ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8pphtmgizk&amp;t=8m14s ), 
  kill the pig , lock up the dog . 
  dice goofed up the balance enough with pushing the sraw nerf at the same time as the air vehicle maneuverability buff . 
  manpads need to be buffed , not nerfed . 
  either that or buff the maa 's cannon damage vs air by like 100 % ( it 's completely ridiculous now how much of a pea shooter it is , you shoot your autocannon at a fucking scout heli 100m away for a couple of seconds and the bastard just keeps on rollin ' , gets behind some building for a bit , repairs , and goes on his merry way ) . 
  there needs to be a reliable way of killing air targets by other means than your own air vehicles . 
  this is currently not present in the game . 
  well , their gm [ got fired ] ( http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/visceral-boss-leaves-ea ) after 15 years and i would not be surprised if the internal structure is being messed with ( as it usually happens when you get a new boss in the company ) ... soo , i guess now you can imagine what 's going on behind the scenes . 
   i kid, 
  step 1 : be mma . 
  seriously , boxing is boring as fuck . 
  cancer transplant ? 
  will you continue using idtech engine in future projects ? 
  do you think virtual texture engines have a future and do you feel they added anything to the game or made the game development easier ( seeing that you and tango are the only studios using them at the moment ) ? 
  that would be a big ass list . 
  time warner owns the rights . 
  ( i 'm serious , look it up . ), 
   #growupharriet, 
  depends on several factors , e.g. 
  if you live in san francisco . 
   we want to take some turboloader improvements from hardline, 
  blood diamonds are awesome !, 
  delicious pain and suffering !, 
  could be worse . 
  like , for example , if two of them were flat out better than the others . 
  pretendracecars.net is a blog made by a fanatic , long-time sms hater , posting anything from that domain , especially to a sub about `` ethics in game journalism '' is crazy . 
   and this journo, 
  so anyone writing a shitty blog is now a journalist ? 
  you should have also removed its teeth and then just feed it soft food ... would be even better , no ? 
  you inbred twats . 
  1000 + upvotes and gold . 
  i can ** guarantee ** half or more of that are muh muricuns who think they wont be told what to do `` in their house '' and `` to their things '' and ca n't be bothered with dealing with any problems owning a cat may bring . 
  same people that use electric collars on dogs . 
  twats . 
  petition ea to make dice la & visceral the lead developers of battlefield 5 multiplayer . 
  ideal push is to post this again 48 hours before the deadline . 
  again with this troll blog ??? 
  seriously , what the fuck . 
   while you are bathing, 
  . . or brushing your teeth ( with a finger ) ... and then swallowing the water ... * shudders *, 
  / u/thehat2 step down . 
   loose, 
  8v8 domination ? 
  i 'd much rather have 60hz 32 player conquest . 
  sraw was fun . 
  it 's not now . 
  to make it easier to understand : ** fun ** -  ** not fun ** . 
  i thought video games were supposed to be fun . 
  ... anyways , i can still snipe infantry ( so the nerf * completely * failed on that front ) , but it 's far less effective against armor and practically useless against air . 
  i have a lot of respect for dice la , but nerfing the sraw at the same time as buffing air maneuverability was borderline idiotic , sorry . 
  psa : hardline is trash . 
  nobody plays it . 
  people do n't like it . 
  deal with it . 
  fake , tumblr has neon hair . 
  season pass & shitty graphics with terrible lods and crushed detail across the board . 
  dat console parity doe . 
  dat dlc shilling doe . 
  the `` console shill '' downvote button was never so attractive like it is now ...

  not a shill ? 
  having standards ? 
  yeah ... keep shitting on the likes of ubisoft while sucking cdpr dicks . 
   i wish i could see if this post took place in a forum set up to report issues/bugs with the game . 
  `` thread : press articles on project cars/wmd '' , in response to this post by a member :, 
   empty box has his review out ( link ) . 
  it sounds pretty well balanced , without bashing . 
  his biggest gripe is the ai ( agression/speed ) which kinda reflects how i feel about them . 
  the well known mantra of ` physics are not at the level of classic pc sims ' is present of course , i guess that 's as far as his peer group allows him to go . 
  and as for, 
   a community manager, 
  not so . 
  development director . 
  second highest position in the studio . 
  are you sure ? 
  once you get banned on wmd , you receive a refund and you 're gone and there 's no coming back . 
  i see `` that particular user '' 's posts from time and i 'm unaware of the stuff you mention ... but it 's true i do n't visit wmd that much . 
   i 'm filling up the gas for the vive hype bus , tickets are free and all are welcome !, 
  i 'll take one ticket , please !, 
  weapons of mass destruction .
