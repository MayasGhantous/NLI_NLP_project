  just kidding , world of mass development ( wmdportal.com ) , the domain that contains the main development forum . 
  stop reading shitty kotaku articles . 
  the keylogger was in some gta vice city mod ( for like 10 years ) , not gta 5 . 
  apparently `` gta vc '' and `` gta v '' is the same thing for some video game `` journalists '' . 
  ah , you 're correct o_o . 
  i was wrong !, 
  well , you do n't pick to be born as a predator , so ... \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  besides , [ penguins are assholes ] ( http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayabstract?frompage=online&amp;aid=8693309 ) . 
   the account , based upon levick 's detailed field observations at cape adare ( 71 \u00b0 18 \u2032 s , 170 \u00b0 09 \u2032 e ) during the course of the british antarctic ( terra nova ) expedition 1910 , commented on frequency of sexual activity , autoerotic behaviour , and seemingly aberrant behaviour of young unpaired males and females including necrophilia , sexual coercion , sexual and physical abuse of chicks , non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviour . 
  and, 
   later researchers rediscovered what levick had seen . 
  rather than being deviant , the behaviors were a regular part of penguin life , triggered by males associating a rather flexible interpretation of a female 's mating posture with receptiveness . 
  as natural history museum , london ornithologist douglas russell and colleagues reported in a preface to levick 's belatedly-released report , this behavior is so ingrained that when a researcher set out a dead penguin that had been frozen in such a position , many males found the corpse `` irresistible . '' in a bit of weird field work , the same researcher found that `` just the frozen head of the penguin , with self-adhesive white o 's for eye rings , propped upright on wire with a large rock for a body , was sufficient stimulus for males to copulate and deposit sperm on the rock . '', 
  also , it has been documented that some penguins toss other penguins into the water to test if it 's safe . 
  out of region . 
   my true 5.1 headset, 
  you do n't need that though . 
  set the mix in game to stereo and the game will do what is needed for best audio experience . 
  you have two ears , after all . 
  decent headphones provide the best and most realistic way of reproducing sound the vast majority of players has access to . 
  looks like you 're talking about the game 's forums , not wmd forums . 
  wmd forum is a private forum for the backers of the game and the membership is directly tied to your status as a backer . 
  you do n't get banned and then unbanned . 
  ban on the wmd forums initiates a refund and you 're no longer a backer . 
  you 're seem to be confused . 
   tlc which was originally founded by nasa as the learning channel, 
  holy shit , it that the tv station we know in europe as the `` honey boo boo '' channel ? 
  fresh charcoal . 
  do n't breathe this !, 
  it is the same game ... just different faction ( gla ), 
  i have the same issue even with a gamepad , it just seems the momentum is poorly designed . 
  iirc witcher 3 has no drm , so it should n't matter where you get the data from . 
  did you try a torrent ? 
  it means somebody was smoking some good shit ... or has two pairs of arms, 
  now imagine how that works with any other topic , something like a presidential election where billions are flying around or some topic that is unpleasant to the cia/nsa ... we 've seen first hand how easy it is for an ideological group to completely control wikipedia and half of the high-ranking ( in terms of search engine position ) press . 
  i once believed that if an issue was important enough , the logical reasoning would prevail and we would , as the consumers of the media , see the truth coming out in the end . 
  i 'm not so sure anymore , and i have no trouble believing that if the government , for example , truly wanted something buried , they could do so with relative ease . 
  it just requires a handful of influential people in the right places . 
  especially on the internet . 
  quatar has money , influence and fucked up morals ... it 's not just about coke . 
  main guy behind frostbite , not mantle . 
   instrumental in the development of mantle, 
  sure , as technical director on frostbite and having a good relationship with amd , i can imagine . 
  however , what you wrote, 
   one of the main guys behind mantle, 
  suggested he was mantle 's architect or implemented parts of it . 
  he did not . 
  it 's not about semantics , it 's like saying, 
  * john carmack co-developed opengl, 
  compared to, 
  * john carmack influenced opengl 's development, 
  big difference . 
  a man thanks a girl, 
  this site is fucked , everyone move to https://voat.co, 
  tagged as peasant, 
   so , the short , eli5 answer is that we do n't really know . 
  there are a lot of theories . 
  psychology in a nutshell . 
   makes clothing textures look really bad, 
  it does n't . 
  apex clothing = [ nvidia 's cloth physics tech ] ( https://developer.nvidia.com/apex-clothing ) . 
  stuff like skirts and capes and flags having physics . 
  if you 're bothered by tea bagging this much , maybe it 's time to take a break and consider that you may just be taking the game way too seriously . 
  such are the joys of simulated projectile travel . 
  this can never be fixed , only reduced ( with tightened up netcode and 60 + tick servers ) . 
  that 's why we 're testing 60hz and 120hz tickrate on the cte . 
  that 's nice of you ... except you 're a dirty liar . 
  i distinctly remember you campaigning for the sraw nerf by linking to your videos where you shoot at slowly moving air targets while stating how `` easy '' and `` noob '' it is to kill air with the sraw . 
  gwent is super boring . 
  in all honesty , if i wanted to play a board game instead of an open world action rpg with heavy emphasis on story telling , i would not be buying witcher 3 . 
  and that 's not even mentioning the fact that `` digital '' board games lack the real-life social interaction which makes for half of the fun of even playing board games . 
  look , you find your own fun in the game ... if you enjoy gwent , then good for you . 
  but let 's not act as if it 's the second coming of jesus ... if they did n't put it in the game , no one would miss it . 
  my controversial opinion is that if you spend a significant percentage of your play time in the game by playing gwent ( and we 're talking about a game with 100h + of content here ) , you either have * way * too much free time on your hands or you just do n't like tw3 's combat/story that much . 
   put 3 m15 mines on a quad , bike or jeep, 
  i 'm pretty sure the at mines are ground-only and you cant put them on any vehicle . 
  m2 slams are the `` sticky '' ones . 
  the game looks like complete ass . 
  2008 level shit for peasants . 
  the mod scene on the pc will basically have to redo the whole game . 
  the most `` sensitive '' country is the us , as it is the current world leader of the outrage culture ( san francisco being the capital ) ... 
   in my opinion the lighting and textures easily rivals those of games like gta v and to a degree the witcher 3, 
  your opinion is fucking shit , that much is obvious . 
  the game is about as beautiful as a [ botchling ] ( http://i.ytimg.com/vi/tmzzds5joim/maxresdefault.jpg ) . 
  console peasants and their standards these days ... 
  yep ... 
  i 'm pretty sure the only reason visceral is n't dissolved yet is that they work on some other project ( rumored star wars title ) and the old management got the boot . 
  why ? 
  pretty much all new games wo n't even come out for these ancient boxes , it 's time to end that support, 
  polygon ? 
  more like polygoon . 
  or that . . :p, 
  tighter cone and higher drop off start and end, 
   1090t for an fx8350, 
  i did n't know it was this bad . 
  i still have a backup 1090t ocd to 3.4 ghz ( meaning it 's now more like 1100t be ) and seeing the results [ here ] ( http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/203?vs=697 ) , the `` latest '' amd processors are pretty much comparable to it as far as game performance goes . 
   personal speculation , opinion, 
  it 's not that . 
  it 's based on the engine they 're using and it has been ** officially ** stated ** multiple ** times that there will be no modding support in frostbite games due to the complexity ( not just workflow , but also licensing ) of the frostbite tools used to make frostbite engine games . 
  also , there 's the fact that not a single frostbite game to date has supported modding .
