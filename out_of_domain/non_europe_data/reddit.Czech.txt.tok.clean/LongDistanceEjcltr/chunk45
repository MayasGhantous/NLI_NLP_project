  change unknown to unlikely and then it will be unbiased . 
   dragon age inquisition use frosbite and has mods tho there 's no modding tool , technically it 's still possible to mod, 
  technically , you can mod anything ... but the quantity and ( more importantly ) the quality of the mods available will reflect that . 
  what you need to do to * support * modding as a developer is one or both of these :, 
  * provide modding tools ( like [ creation kit ] ( http://www.creationkit.com ) , [ redkit ] ( http://redkit.cdprojektred.com ) ), 
  * provide the game assets in an easily exportable/importable format and provide access to the game logic at the game script level, 
  skyrim * supports * modding . 
  dragon age inquisition does not . 
  there are not any tools . 
  its modding scene is pretty much dead and 99 % of all the mods that exist consist of texture and 3d model replacements . 
  there is no way of actually changing the game in any meaningful way , let alone adding new functionality . 
  you ca n't change the ui , you ca n't add items , you ca n't edit the world ( map ) , you ca n't add story and more dialog , you ca n't add quests ... the list goes on and on . 
   for fuck sake educate yourself, 
  yeah , you really should . 
  saying that inquisition `` has mods '' only shows how little you know what you 're talking about . 
   everyone that does n't like the spring patch, 
  i fail to see why should a person disliking the spring patch watch this video . 
  there is so much you can dislike about the changes that streamlining all the concerns to a few stat changes done to the assault rifles is borderline insulting . 
   russia or something, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y48/virumor/map_of_american_isolationist_thinki.gif ) . 
  you bring her back you got that voodoo dick ? 
  i 'm from alaska dowg , i 'm out here trapped with the eskimos . 
  thank you , i have n't laughed like this in a long time !, 
  i 'll suck yo dick , no homo ... see what i 'm sayin ' , it ai n't gay my nigga , fo ` real . 
  it seems that for every eloquent sargon there 's an idiotic king of pol ... which is to be expected , the sad part is that the hashtag got populated by idiots coming from dumps like 4chan , who then follow and parrot crazy shit people like king of pol / internet aristocrat / etc. 
  say . 
  every time i see `` red pill '' , `` green pill '' , `` pol '' or any other crap from all the shitty anon boards , i just facepalm , sigh and try to move past given discussion because you know you have idiots and trolls on `` your side '' and in such a situation it 's just better to not even engage . 
   do you really want to throw stones ? 
  really ? 
  at 4channers ? 
  sure . 
  * nothing of value ever came out of the chans ( unless you count memes as something valuable ) . 
  * no meaningful discussion ever happened on the chans ( due to the excessive amout of shitposting and trolls who just poison the well ) . 
  we can shit on reddit all we want , but the fact is that it 's a million times better place for having a discussion ( or even just to learn about the news ) than 4chan . 
  oh , i 'm sorry , i forgot about that aspect of the chans . 
  calling someone something-fag 20 times in a thread was funny 10 years ago , if even that . 
  you have to have a mind of a 12 year old to do that now and every time you use it outside of the chan boards , you make yourself look like an idiot . 
   no it 's not . 
  of course it is . 
  you ca n't even discuss stuff properly due to user friendliness issues of a typical chan board ( as far as being able to reply multiple times to each other while maintaining readability ) . 
   reddit is a fucking echo chamber, 
  you can say the same about any sub-forum . 
  yes , unpopular opinions can get down-voted and regularly do , but that does n't stop you from discussing any points , it 's not like your post gets deleted . 
   on 4chan everyone speaks their mind freely, 
  like on pretty much every internet board ever ... 
   4chan is the freest board on the internet, 
  i hope you 're joking . 
  yeah , go right back into your hugbox . 
  this site is so dead . 
  everyone , let 's move to [ voat.co ] ( http://voat.co ) . 
  `` vice '' , `` sexism '' - are you for real , that is your source, 
   amazing news, 
  how short sighted some people can be , astonishing ... 
   we 're banning behavior , not ideas, 
  that quote was so much obvious bullshit in so little space , it was hilarious . 
  and some people even parroted it ( even here ) !, 
  now here we are , one day later , when every possible variation of `` fat people hate '' is instantly banned for `` ban evasion '' . 
  banning ideas instead of behavior . 
  they 're just bombing everything even remotely related to the banned topics and i 'm pretty sure that they do n't have the time to check every single sub when they have to ban ( potentially ) hundreds of them ... sooo they nuke it from the orbit and reinstate the unrelated ones if someone complains loud enough . 
  a standard procedure in the coming months and ( hopefully not ) years at reddit hq . 
  edit : [ aaron swartz , co-founder of reddit , expresses his concerns and warns about private companies censoring the internet , months before his death ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/39gssf/aaron_swartz_cofounder_of_reddit_expresses_his/ ) - worth checking out , thanks / u / ___ ataraxia ___, 
   apparently ca n't quickly visit a sub to see, 
  at this point , i doubt that they do it at all . 
  there 's most likely a semi-automated process in place where the staff just feeds keywords to a ban script ( which then maybe looks at the presence of some complaints against the given sub and/or the people in the sub ) . 
  easy . 
  it goes completely against their `` we 're banning behavior , not ideas '' claims , but whatever ... who cares , only misogynists , am i right ? 
   the mods, 
  minor correction : the mods have no power outside of their respective sub-reddits . 
  only admins ( reddit staff ) can ban topics and people site-wide . 
  ah , not much ... [ lol ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/all ), 
  pfffffft , just buy a [ koenigsegg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wtlmpokmg4&amp;t=3m ) . 
  this is about an advertisement guys !, 
  chill ( this time ) :p this is normal, 
  it 's about an ad . 
  ( as in youtube ads in the videos . ), 
  are you sure it 's voat**.com ** ? 
  because voat.com is random domain unrelated to voat.co, 
   kia of all places, 
  what is this sub , a sjw hub or something ? 
  kia was always reasonable and to the point . 
   gamergaters are expressing reasonable nuanced opinions, 
  like they always did ( well , most of them ) . 
  ah , sooo ... what are you sjws up to lately ? 
  any new `` projects '' ? 
   when was it announced and explained before ? 
  lol, 
  i disagree . 
  sjw is a perfect term for what it tries to describe . 
  or do you have any other , more fitting , term ? 
  thanks for being honest with your audience , u/matimi0, 
  yes , let 's bring back turok ( and give it to some competent fps studio ) . 
  the game has always had serious issues with the server performance , but the spring patch seems to be disastrous in this aspect . 
  dice needs to drop all the nonsense and start overhauling the server application and create new monitoring tools for both the players and the server owners . 
  i ca n't believe we 're still having these conversations a year after the cte has started . 
  `` the netcode '' is a never ending story , all thanks to the greedy server providers and ea not having the drive to finally fix `` the root of all evil '' which is the server app . 
  yeah , tried to use tarnish , used furnish ( for some reason ) , fixed it immediately . 
  happens to the best of us . 
  now grow the fuck up . 
  a console dude using `` scrub '' unironically . 
  you make me laugh .
