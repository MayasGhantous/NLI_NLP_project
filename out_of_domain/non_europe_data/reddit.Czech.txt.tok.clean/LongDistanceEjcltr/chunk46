  your op is literally crying that other people do n't like the game , like a spoiled child complaining to his mommy that the meanies at school do n't like his new toy . 
  btw what was even the point of it all ? 
  as if this sub is only for the people who fanatically love the game . 
   do you even own bfh ?? 
  more than likely you dont, 
  http://i.imgur.com/ol8yk7h.png - 16 hours of retail , also bought premium, 
  i do n't have time to write about games i do n't give a flying fuck about . 
  wow , that 's ... weird !, 
  :d it seems that you 're on top of the problem , so keep doing what you 're doing . 
  well , maybe have a longer `` retail '' branch test period before the next patch ? 
  looks fine , i 'm surprised . 
  consider me hyped !, 
  look ma , no hands !, 
   prison architect, 
  prison architect makes progress , you can clearly see the game is being developed and it more or less feels like an actual game , not some gameplay prototype . 
  overgrowth is a vaporware joke , some could even call it a scam . 
  you can `` pre-order '' the thing for like 7 years ( that is not a typo , `` seven '' ) and the development moves at a glacial pace ( and by that i mean the game , or more like the engine , since there 's no `` game '' to speak of , gets an update once in a blue moon ) . 
  chrome browser downloaded and installed a voice listening plugin without the user 's knowledge or approval . 
  nope , this just means uncle google `` updates '' ( parts of ) his software as he wants to and does n't necessarily ask you , the user . 
  this is an issue in a situation when you care about the security of the system a lot ( as in the breach of which could result either in professional or legal issues for you ) , but for a regular user , this is about the same as an auto-update feature . 
  do you have windows update set-up in a way that it downloads and installs the updates automatically ? 
  same thing . 
  ( well , except you agreed to that and in this case chrome does n't ask , but the result is the same . ), 
  it 's a question whether or not you trust google with your data and privacy . 
  most people do . 
  the `` problem '' in this case is that if a hacker ( or the government ) got access to google servers , they could upload and install whatever they wanted to your computer , and it is only a `` problem '' because of the way the debian community and open source in general works ( see / u/madspline 's post ) . 
   well , the difference here is you never controlled what your windows computers does . 
  you might have paid it , but it is not ` your ' computer . 
  it is owned by the company which makes windows ( or whomever happens to hack them in turn ) . 
  sure , then again i 'm responding to an eli5 - typical os user demographic . 
  you do n't need eli5 to explain this stuff if you 're a linux os user , let alone a sysadmin . 
  yep xd, 
  `` no downgrade happening , i swear !, 
  we just optimize . '', 
  - every game developer after crushing the game 's visuals to run at 30 fps on the consoles . 
   reddit is heavily left-leaning, 
  funny you say that ( `` boo hoo , another tin foil hat guy '' ) , but as far as reddit actually works , it 's pretty damn accurate . 
  you have this very small group of people who have * absolute power * over the subreddit ( many of these people have their filthy paws in many subreddits ) , they 're * judge , jury and executioner * . 
  they can create any rules they want to , they can remove content if they wish so , they do n't have to explain their actions to anybody ( and if someone asks , just say you did n't do it - must have been one of the other mods - or say some random shit , there 's no way to check if it 's true so who cares ) . 
  there is no public record of their `` work '' and there is no way of democratically voting in a new leadership . 
  that 's communism territory . 
  and it 's not even like the mods are the admins or the owners of reddit , the company . 
  it 's just the way the site is set up . 
  oh well ... the thing that scares me the most though , is that wikipedia somehow managed to get to a pretty similar situation where a few people ( often with extremist , one-sided views ) are perfectly capable of controlling the content of whole ranges of topics on wikipedia . 
  ** that ** is fucked up . 
  [ but mah baaaahdeee 's tellin me ye-he-hes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saewenqz0w4 ), 
  just watching that caused me brain damage . 
  the most fake ass of the century . 
  too much ark. . . 
  does anyone older than 10 and younger than 40 still play minecraft ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raidyt4mvyq&amp;t=6m how did they sell 4k copies of that ? 
  i 'm assuming that he owns all steam games ? 
  yeah , he actually went there . 
  wow ... 
  my question is this : how can anyone trust his research after this bs ? 
  i know i ca n't . 
  it 's a dice stockholm game . 
  remember , their last game was battlefield 4 . 
  if there ever was a time to be prepared to be disappointed , it 's now . 
   easy to pick up but hard to master, 
  there is nothing `` hard to master '' about using one stick to control a flying vehicle . 
  it 's just terrible design . 
  and dice stockholm is very much at home making terrible design decisions . 
  if you type `` 2 pm pdt '' into google , it will tell you when that is in your local time zone . 
  nvidia kindaworks . 
  it 's ** absolutely ** like that . 
  uwe is one example , but this happens in art all the time all over the world . 
  a ton of the stuff made for public money ( government art support programs ) is * terrible * , it 's all about who can lobby more effectively and who has more connections . 
  this is especially true in the movie industry , especially in europe ( and i know for a fact that it happens en masse in the czech republic ) . 
  i can guarantee that if there was a program for indie game developers making `` artsy '' games ( i.e. 
  games that do not need to make money ) , it would be dominated by the 3rd wave feminist and sjw aligned groups . 
  getting back to uwe - at least he `` just '' made shitty movies ( and hey , after he made so many , rampage was actually watchable , so he was getting better ) and did n't push some political agenda . 
  wow , are you serious ? 
  is there some image or video comparison to know for sure ? 
  ( ca n't really tell from the op 's image , it may just use different bokeh type or lower than maximum settings . ), 
  that would be hilarious ... bokeh dof is quite a bit more demanding than the classic cheap one based on some gaussian blur, 
  gtfo, 
  [ no joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak7rzjac-qe ) . 
   you know those thoughts that you get, 
  yeah , go on ... 
   what if i pushed that guy into traffic right now, 
   how quickly could i make it to the ocean if everything caught fire at once, 
  what kind of excuse is that ?!, 
  i 'm all for it . 
  the chances of this damaged individual procreating are extremely slim and he gets to practice his fetish in peace . 
  a win win situation !, 
  i 'd say that most people who are morbidly curious ( and juding by the popularity of / r/wtf or sites like liveleak , there are many ) are desensitized to this kind of violence ( to a varying degree ) . 
  i 'll say that `` dead inside '' is kinda weird way of saying it :d, 
   or that all arabs are crazy terrorists bent on genocide ? 
  all ? 
  but a lot of them supoort it . 
   tech companies will capitulate and decrease cryptographic strength, 
  anyone who thinks this will happen either does n't know anything about the broad usage and necessity of cryptography or severely overestimates the strength of the british economy ( in the global market scale ) . 
  horse penises do n't look like human penises ... so , yeah , `` someone spend a lot of time on certain details '' . 
  some of you people scare me , lol ... 
  i 've just unlocked new mexico ( tier 6 us battleship ) and i play fairly regularly , with a premium account , while using confederate flags ( + 50 % xp ) whenever i can and most of the time , i do n't suck ( 1099 avg xp , 2.09 k/d ) . 
  how can some people already be on izumos and yamatos is a mystery to me . 
  hey , / u/piemonkey !, 
  i just wanted to say that / r/games is a garbage subreddit led by one of the worst people in all of reddit . 
  have a nice day .
