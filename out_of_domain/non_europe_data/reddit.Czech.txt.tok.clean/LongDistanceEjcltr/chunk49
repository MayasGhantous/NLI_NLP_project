  call a woman a bitch = misogyny . 
  call a man a dick = ok . 
  `` misogyny '' represents '' ** hatred ** of women '' . 
  if you think that reddit as a big slice of the human ( internet ) population ** hates ** women , you 're either a moron , or a sjw . 
  btw there is no `` accusation '' because thanks to your silly opinion , you 're either one or the other . 
  simple logic . 
   prevailing theory, 
  `` i used to think '' is a prevailing theory ? 
  no , it 's a theory you pulled out of your ass to support your argument on the next line . 
  `` these past few weeks have proved me wrong . '', 
  how they proved you wrong ? 
  which instances of behavior that could be considered prevalent enough to warrant a term `` reddit 's sexism '' proved you wrong ? 
  i 'm 90 % sure that you 've read some shitty blogpost on one of the clickbait sites that `` reddit is sexist '' and that is your evidence . 
  ps : if you think that individual sexist posts make reddit sexist , you 're out of your mind . 
  this happens in all internet communities that are big enough . 
  you might as well write that the internet is sexist . 
  how do you propose to solve that `` problem '' ? 
  internet passports ? 
  banning of offensive language ? 
  internet police ? 
  anyone who thinks like this deserves to be stripped of voting rights . 
   reddit has a misogynist demographic, 
  also , it evidently attracts sjws , so you could say it evens out \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   anyone who types `` misogyny does n't real '', 
  what ? 
  - hey guys i 'm going to say stupid shit and watch them call me a retard !, 
  - you retard . 
  - you see guys , i called it !, 
  this is one of the reasons why communities like / r/kotakuinaction exist . 
  sure , very few cases go this far ( when the law gets involved ) , but we see people * losing * jobs over harassment * accusations * ( while in reality merely daring to disagree ) pretty much every day . 
  this is nothing else than getting your life ruined because you have a different opinion about politics . 
  extrajudicial punishment as a tool for political repression . 
  thankfully the mainstream population is * slowly * starting to realize what 's up with all these [ 3rd wave feminists ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=3rd+wave+feminism ) and [ social justice warriors ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=social+justice+warrior ) . 
  it 's sad to see reasonable social justice activists and [ real ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ewu33ednnm ) [ feminists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o47bxiznf-e ) being replaced with vile , shitty human beings . 
   what do they think will happen if greece defaults and goes bankrupt ? 
  greece should default , suffer the short-term pain and follow argentina 's example . 
  how do you play alone against picked bots like that ? 
  hi julian , congratulate david on our behalf !, 
  julian for vice president !, 
  [ :p ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/tiggr/comments/3c1g6o/utiggr_for_president/ ), 
  also it 's no secret that the sjw clickbait blogosphere sticks together and i 'm sure there is place for these guys on some of the sites like ars technica , buzzfeed , destructoid , [ etc ] ( http://www.deepfreeze.it/outlet.php ) . 
  my personal bet ? 
  vox . 
  a perfect fit . 
   kia is one of the subreddits that will likely get shut down for harassment . 
  you wish . 
   read it as `` do n't be a dick to newbies '' . 
  i can guarantee that is not the primary reason why it 's in there . 
  it 's a vehicle for opening up the oss projects to more `` politically active '' people who do n't have the skill to ( or do n't want to ) contribute code and ideas consistently , but want to police/shame the community members if they say something that does not adhere to the progressive extremist views . 
  make an insignificant pull request one day , but police the community for the next few years ... if anyone complains , beat them with coc 's `` technical ability '' . 
  yeah , that makes total sense ... who the hell upvotes this . 
  let 's not have any server population but at least we 'll have classic . 
  whtrex logic . 
  keep that line of thinking for the next game and before it 's released . 
  r/upvotedbecausegirl ... and do n't fucking lie, 
  amazing post !, 
  i 'll have to look this stuff up ( to confirm that you 're not pulling numbers out of your ass :p ) , but what i 'm reading is pure insanity . 
  vice gaming is a gift that will keep on giving for months to come . 
  it will be like polygon at its `` best '' , except all the time . 
  given the a-list of sjws they seem to be picking from , this whole thing has the potential to reach the stratosphere of lulz . 
  maybe it 's a good thing ... if it 's centralized , it 's easier to point out editorial bias . 
  i guess we 'll have a lot to talk about here :d, 
  nice to see you in the game , crawlerz !, 
  it seems a lot of fps/battlefield players dig the game :p, 
   not `` gamer entitlement '' , but gamers being assholes . 
  i do n't know , the whole me3 ending fiasco ( on which half of the video builds on ) represents the embodiment of the `` gamer entitlement '' narrative . 
  that term was pretty much popularized by all the articles that popped up and called gamers unhappy with the me3 's poor ending `` entitled '' . 
  also , * artistic integrity * . 
  lol . 
  me3 ending was * objectively * and * factually * not as complex as advertised ( rgb ending , your choices in the trilogy did not matter at all as far as the ending was concerned ) and subjectively also very bad , as it left the game 's universe in a poor state and nullified most of your efforts ( making not a prequel and also not a sequel - i.e. 
  placing it in an entirely different galaxy - was basically the only thing they could do to salvage their universe for the 4th game ) . 
  most of the online-active players of the trilogy complained about it ... not only complained , but created critique , both written and in video format , created whole new alternative endings and theories , art , made petitions . 
  bioware forums were abuzz with disappointed posts . 
  it was not a small minority of people who just decided to shit on the ending , call the developers cunts and wish them cancer - that was just the picture the sjw game media tried to create . 
   he even specifically says that it 's just a few . 
  yes , just as they say `` no , no , not you the viewers '' and then talk about , and i quote , `` crazed gamers '' . 
  as if these things do not happen in other industries ( those crazed movie goers ! ) . 
  as if you can talk about a few 0.01 % of a group of people like it represents the majority of that group of people . 
  smells like `` gamers do n't have to be your audience '' kind of bs to me . 
  it 's not like they 're calling out some isolated behavior of a few kids ( or older , mentally unstable weirdos :d ) or trolls , they 're basing their entire argument about valve not releasing hl3 on this ridiculous notion that a company of valve 's size and pedigree will cancel a multi million dollar production based on `` muh feels '' . 
  not everyone is phil fish . 
  what you 're saying in your post is that they say valve dissolved hl3 production because of a few potential future attacks by some randoms on twitter ( or whatever ) . 
  i just do n't see it ( not that it would make any sense ) . 
  they can say `` no not you , the viewers '' all they want , all it represents is an obvious attempt at not pissing off your audience . 
  i think the point here is that they 're counter-terrorist units , not military units and not typical police units and i also think that firing live ammo is on a whole different level in terms of confidence required . 
  they even say it , these are * confidence * drills . 
  the point of this whole thing is to perform in conditions that are not ideal and still achieve precision . 
  i can imagine these units going into shoot on sight and shoot to kill situations , while having potentially dozens of civilians around ( bystanders/hostages ) . 
  instructor of what ? 
  shooting ? 
  they 're not learning to shoot , they already know how to shoot . 
  they 're building up their confidence so they do n't fuck it up in the field . 
  yeah , colorado ... not a fan . 
   both lines have good tier 8 ships , by all accounts . 
  from my closed beta test experience , the japanese line peaks with the nagato . 
  north carolina is arguably better than amagi and iowa is much , much better than izumo . 
  yamato is better than montana though . 
  this seems to be supported by the avg xp rates from [ the asian server stats ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofwarships/comments/3euz09/ship_statistics_from_the_asia_server/ ) . 
  very good video , probably one of his best . 
  great editing and narration .
