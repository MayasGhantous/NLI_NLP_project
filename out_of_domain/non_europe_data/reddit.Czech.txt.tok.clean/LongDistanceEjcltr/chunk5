  yeah . 
  and judging by [ vince 's surprise ] ( https://twitter.com/vincezampella/status/395325209521029120 ) , i can only imagine how ea treats dice . 
  very good , because the only thing that can persuade me to buy another game from ea is the fact that i can try it first for free ( beta/demo ) . 
  and i have to say , it 'll be all about stability and netcode issues/feeling this time . 
  `` buuuut i 's only beta , they can fixit !! '', 
  you dun got demized, 
  yep , a repair/stinger slave . 
  thanks for this !, 
  it happened to me several times already and it 's good to know that i 'm not just going crazy ... 
  dunno , but by the sound of it , i 'm guessing he means that you snipe from a place that is generally out of the 1x ads render distance . 
  aaah , thanks !, 
  even though i still do n't know why it 's called `` rende-sniping '' . . 
  the russian badger, 
  this . 
  ( i know this is a low-effort post , but there is n't that much more to be said , sadly ... if the only result of being caught cheating is a stat wipe , not a ban , all this hoopla is meaningless . ), 
  i hope that does n't happen when you 're not spotted , lol . . 
  now the only thing we need is someone skilled enough to make emblems out of them :p, 
  plus we have the defensive spec now !, 
  ok , if that 's the case - good to know . 
  ( i do n't play hc and if this indeed works every time , then it reduces the effectiveness of a suppressor quite a bit , especially if you 're not playing alone . ), 
  yeah , i know ( about the screams of team mates or when you throw a grenade ) - i just did not know if it telegraphs your position even if you 're not spotted . 
  laser sight is always a viable option if you 're run n ' gunning in cqb ( i.e. 
  famas + suppressor + laser sight + ergo ) . 
  i blame call of duty . 
  tried even to log out but still no cigar . 
  well , thanks for the battlepack anyway !, 
  especially useful with mortars and spawn beacons . 
  the guy pushes more news and content to the magazines than to his own backers . 
  #because 40milisnotenoughweneedmoar, 
  it 's pretty sad that dice refuses to acknowledge that it 's their fault and instead they try to blame the user connection ( or whatever , networks in general etc. ) ... 
  where almost every god damn online game in the known universe does n't have these problems or at least they 're not so prevalent . 
  i mean , bf is now almost like a benchmark for `` bad netcode '' and everyone is making fun of it ... it 's almost like with every new game there 's a comparison to bf 's netcode and how good the given game feels compared to bf ( well , at least among bf youtubers ), 
  then tell me something about the fps module ( zero information about the development of that has been released ) . 
  planetside module ( only one very early video exists ) . 
  star systems shown in engine ? 
  zero . 
  some ships concetualized a year ago ? 
  not released yet . 
  last hangar update ? 
  almost two months ago . 
  what you 're talking about is fluff . 
  lore , fan videos , qas , tngs etc. , nothing concrete . 
  there are some tidbits in the ask a dev forum , but the problem is that these updates should be push not pull . 
  how to do it properly ? 
  look at limit theory video dev blog . 
  this whole subreddit consists of fanboyism based on very little reason . 
  cr is not a god you should blindly believe in . 
  ** trust , but verify ** . 
  ^ btw i pledged $ 500 . 
   walk me through why/how cig is not following through in their opinion, 
  i would . 
  but i ca n't . 
  i have no opinion on the matter . 
  and it 's not because i 'm indecisive , it 's because i lack the facts . 
  that 's the problem , a communication problem . 
  i 'm being kept in the dark . 
  like i said , there is so little actual information about the development , i ca n't even say if they 're `` not following through '' because i do n't know the basic outlines of the intended design . 
  remember that `` death of a spaceman '' post ? 
  i ca n't remember any post or video of similar depth about any other aspect of the game . 
   i think cig is doing a good job . 
  does that make me a fanboy ? 
  i do n't know , are you blindly `` following the leader '' and actively try to undermine the opposition 's credibility by name calling , personal attacks etc. ? 
  look at the top voted post : `` self entitled people '' . 
  so anyone who dares to question something is `` self entitled '' ? 
  for the love of god reddit , upvote this !, 
  i 'll be completely honest :, 
  i have exactly ** zero ** faith in ea and their studios after all the latest fiascos ( simcity launch , bf4 launch , nba live 2014 , all the exploitative f2p bullshit with pvz2 , dungeon keeper etc. ) . 
  i do not believe that ea can bring a product to the market that is n't somehow , someway tinted with their corporate greed fueled by blind marching towards the next few financial quarters . 
  ea , as a company , has no vision . 
  no grand plan . 
  no future for long running series . 
  they do n't cherish their valuable properties , they destroy them by being reckless and greedy . 
  all they see is now and very soon . 
  frostbite = shit . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41hmr4-d9fo ), 
  the real reason is that the bf4 server app in combination with the bf4 client app is a just a hopeless , completely fubar mess . 
  ( and of course the limited tick rate does n't help , but that 's a different issue . ), 
  all these problems and issues with the connection are nothing but a software issue * most of the time * . 
  an ** application layer ** , not a ** transport layer ** issue . 
  udp packet loss this big and this frequent ? 
  yeah , you dice guys keep the fairy tales about how this is how udp works to yourselves . 
  i could point out how i can play other games from the same frankfurt datacenter without a hitch yet some bf4 servers are almost unplayable . 
  the problem is that that i 'm sure many people believe them because they do n't know better and dice has no reason to tell the truth because they made the game , duh ( they would make the network engineering group look like incompetent bunch of lazies that managed to make the netcode worse than it is in bf3 ) , and ea has no reason to tell the truth because they 're ea and they wont shit in their own nest . 
  i 'm honestly astonished the game delegates so much to the client that this is even possible . 
  it 's just ... weird . 
  they apparently handle ** a lot ** of stuff clientside and the transfer rates are in the tens of kilobytes per second ballpark with 64 players ( tiny ) , yet they still have enormous `` netcode '' issues . 
  i do n't know , it all screams `` bad software engineering '' at me . 
  usually , if it looks like a duck , walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it 's a duck . 
  one glance at the latest nfs title ( and its issues ) and i think it 's safe to say frostbite 3 was apparently more than dice could handle . 
  i 'm sure the huge focus on the renderer instead of the rest of the systems ( tools , not having to bake million things in 10 editors , threading , better animation/physics ) etc. 
  did n't help . 
  drama queen . 
  for fucks sake , there are people who have to work hard just to be able to survive and not die of hunger . 
  you have a great paying job you seem to like , you have a family , western style of life ... it 's not rational that the negative community feedback gets to you this bad . 
  what about joining a no explosive server ? 
  there are tons of them . 
  `` boosting '' ( if by `` boosting '' you mean capping flags for high spm and quick unlocks ) is not forbidden . 
  just search for `` flag '' in battlelog server browser . 
  there were official posts on the forums that this is allowed and you 'll not be banned for it . 
  there was even a small period of time wen fairfight was apparently kicking people out of boosting/flagrun servers and afaik it was considered a mistake/bug and allowed again .
