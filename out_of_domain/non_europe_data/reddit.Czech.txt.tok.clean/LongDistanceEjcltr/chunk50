   i do n't know it it 's dx12 that causes this, 
  bf4 does n't have a dx12 renderer ( yet ? 
  ) , so it 's either placebo ( new system . . ) or something else . 
  ** fuck that ** . 
  the people who stole those images are scumbags . 
  calling people scumbags because they look at publicly available images on the internet ( we 're talking about attractive , adult women here , not nude kiddies or crushed puppies ) is fucking disgraceful and disgustingly pc . 
  stop this sex-negative nonsense peddled by 3rd wave feminists and publications aligned with that view . 
  did you look at the pictures ? 
  and do you feel bad about it ? 
  fine , but do n't extend `` shame '' that to others , because you know nothing about them . 
  i did see her nudes because i was curious . 
  i saw them for the same reason i go to / r/wtf etc ... because my natural human curiosity is stronger than some arbitrary `` moral '' values ( yes , moral in quotation marks ) . 
  you can think that i lie or whatever , but i can honestly tell you that i do n't know what those nudes did to 12 year olds , but at my age ( 28 ) , i 'm way too old to be aroused by such mellow stuff ( boo fucking hoo ... a naked woman ... wow ) . 
  if i wanted to quickly blow off some steam , porn is definitely the way to go and there 's so much of it . 
   subs like atheism , ** kotakuinaction ** , truewomensliberation , are n't explicit hatesubs and have ** some ** users who use them for good purposes , but ** for the most part , user activity within them would indicate a prejudice against certain groups ** , be it muslims , christians , women , men , ect . 
  show me the prejudice against a certain group ( and which group ) that can be found on / r/kotakuinaction . 
  * crickets *, 
  you , sir , are a liar . 
  i guess the proof is in the pudding and we 'll see if dice stockholm can get back to designing great games with the battlefront game . 
  but the team around alan kertz does n't exactly have a great track record , visceral did n't go nearly as deep as they should with hardline ( plus their balancing is ... uh , how to say it while staying respectful ... , um , not exactly known for its quality ) and i ca n't really imagine that ea would offload their next big battlefield game to some new/unknown studio . 
  well , if alan kertz and co. do indeed work on the new game at least we 'll hopefully get a new cte sooner after the release so dice la can begin fixing it asap :d, 
  i guess you 're right , however what they can definitely tell us is if the technical stuff we test here can/will be merged into the bf5 codebase at some point . 
  so let 's recap the rebalancing of the air vehicles :, 
  * sraw completely removed out of the equation . 
  * added impenetrable glass on air vehicles . 
  * completely overhauled helicopter handling , made them much more maneuverable and agile . 
  am i missing something ? 
  can someone remind me again why they went completely crazy with this ? 
  / u/tiggr must like his helis :d, 
   removed ? 
  is it somehow not a ohk anymore ? 
  implying `` ohk '' has any meaning in this discussion . 
  the rpg is also ohk . 
  does that somehow make it great at taking down air targets ? 
   remarkably broken stuff like this anymore : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nupboika7by&amp;feature=youtu.be, 
  aaaah the good old montage argument . 
  great . 
  the difference between you and me though , is that i can provide you with tens , maybe hundreds of ** whole matches ** , in which the scout heli ** consistently ** scores 50-0 , 60-1 and similar numbers of `` remarkably broken '' kills . 
  the fun part ? 
  this often does n't even end in a win for the team !, 
  that 's the gotcha bit here , i see talk about teamplay left and right ( and center ) , but the scout heli is one of the least team oriented vehicles in the game . 
  it does n't need teamwork to succeed , it only needs a competent pilot . 
   so now rifle and pistol rounds do n't go through the glass , a thing you probably never even utilized in the first place, 
  the numbers of pilor kills i got during my active playing of bf4 retail ( 600h ? ), 
  on my non-engineer classes will easily get into tens , which is not a low number - given how often you ( do n't ) do this . 
  so there 's that , but now after the agility overhaul , the scout pilots got even more nosey than ever before and just by playing cte i 've had numerous opportunities to shoot at the pilot . 
  not to mention that this whole impenetrable front thing completely changes the dynamic of how the scout can approach its targets as you can now just visually check the class and if it 's not an engineer , you have a free kill in whatever way you 'd like to take it . 
  fancy a head on roadkill ? 
  no problem . 
  no one is saying shooting the pilot was effective , however it gave you that `` last hope '' option and so the scouts did n't feel just untouchable . 
  they do now . 
  if you do n't see the problem here , you 're just biased as it is clear as a day . 
   the sides and back are still completely exposed, 
  ... because anyone cares about the sides of a vehicle with a head on attack pattern ... 
   / u/tiggr must like his helis, 
   or you just dislike them , which is more probable ? 
  * i never said i do n't dislike them . 
  i do dislike them to a certain degree ( the way the 're balanced now at least ) . 
  i think they represent a sizeable portion of the game 's frustration factors and have the capability to very effectively decrease the enjoyment of the game for the majority of people just so a minority ( one ) can have 60 kills instead of 30 . 
  and that 's on maps they have opposition , there are map/mode combos where it often ends in a small disaster . 
  * i pretty much completely replaced bf4 with world of warships as my `` daily driver '' . 
  i only test cte to be informed about how the game 's developing and to know what 's up in the community as bf is my favorite series and i very much look forward to bf5 . 
  i have no dog in this fight , i 'm just stating what i 'm seeing ( unlike you , as is apparent from your other post in this thread '' [ must be an infantry only player ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem ) '' ) . 
  tl ; dr : i use every vehicle available , including scouts . 
  i 'm no scout hater or lover . 
  * i like how you left out the smiley ( which implied a joke ) . 
  nice touch . 
  modern feminism : everything is sexist because i hate men and myself . 
  never . 
  and salt , lots of salt . 
  yeah , or not stone people to death for minor stuff like adultery . 
  i 'm sorry , i know `` we '' want to like voat ... and i want to like it too , but it has to be said that it has been consistently shitting the bed with all the technical issues ever since all this ceo bullshit and sub banning started . 
  it 's perfectly ok to get `` hugged to death '' , but that site has been down for just too many of the crucial days when it has been talked about the most . 
  if you have to close your site during the 3rd or 4th or even 5th wave of new visitors , you are just not doing enough . 
  they received 10k just on bitcoin donations , that alone can get you several dual xeon beast servers and a gigabit line to boot for like 6 months ... 
  i 'm glad they seem to have recovered ( well , to a degree ) , but i ca n't shake the feeling that as a result of the downtimes , they missed a huge opportunity to have a lot bigger audience than they have now . 
   all i see from your comment is `` wah wah , they 're not as good as reddit '' . 
  what ? 
  that does n't even make sense . 
  by your logic , half the content that makes it to the front page would n't work at all . 
  why should i compare it to reddit ( `` not as good '' ) ? 
  i 'm comparing it to any other project that received exposure on reddit and did n't shit its pants for a few weeks . 
   it would be incredibly stupid for them to spend 10k on servers and infrastructure only to have it not be needed in a week . 
  first of all , that was for a fucking half a year . 
  and second , yes that 's abso-fucking-lutely the thing they should have done . 
  in fact , that was the sole purpose of the donations !, 
  i do n't know what 's your background , but i work in the industry and i can tell you for a fact that a majority of project owners would take fucking loans if they needed to just to be able to capitalize on such an opportunity and estabilish a decent user base . 
  pretty much anyone with average programming skills can make a decent web project these days , so voat , the software , would be valued pretty much just as a sum of all hours the authors spent on making it ( = peanuts ) . 
  the only thing that matters these days and what represents true value is reachable audience . 
  that is what makes facebook buy your company for billions . 
  cig fucks up again , what a surprise . 
  ~ ~ 10 ~ ~ 15mins in and no stream ... they really like to waste people 's time . 
  the first hour is a complete disaster . 
  one of the worst presentations i 've seen . 
  useless constant switching of player cameras ( many of which looked at a ground texture from 10cm because the player died ) , completely unprepared players ... jesus , just wow , is this your presentation of a team based tactical gameplay ? 
  what a joke . 
  `` can you press g ? 
  who has heavy marine ? 
  can you press g for hologram . '', 
  edit : i get that this is super work in progress alpha , but could n't they add very basic hit animations ?
