  from the tiny amount of footage they showed , i could n't even see who got shot ( did that electro shotgun hit or miss ? ), 
  and it made it even harder to follow . 
  `` so thank god tb survived his cancer '' - anon, 
  that stupid zoom-in bug almost cost you the game ... when are they going to fix that ? 
  come on , it has [ this scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd5mqjvhw9c ) !, 
  the whole thing is packed with great action scenes and solid cgi ( except the aliens themselves ) , so screw the writing ... who cares , it 's a stupid summer blockbuster ( the kind michael bay used to make before transformers 2/3/4 ) . 
  also , you get an [ awesome soundtrack ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9v86pt7x1g ) from steve jablonsky . 
   and evaporated once they hit the workforce, 
  let 's hope for that . 
  i 'm not so optimistic however . 
  what i 'm seeing is that there is a considerable percentage of people ( enough to influence company policies over time ) that `` hit the workforce '' as a part of making the given organization more `` welcoming '' to women and minorities or at least making the organization * look * like it is . 
  a certain level of this activity or social progressivism ( or whatever they decide to call it ) is becoming more visible in many tech companies , ranging from ea ( especially at bioware , also at dice stockholm ) to reddit and now even github . 
  it 's not that they hire people just because they have a particular view on the social justice problem and other than that ca n't do shit ... no , it 's like the reddit hiring process , where it has been publicly stated that the views of the interviewed people on social justice matter . 
  ( to use gaming companies , since this is a gamergate hub : borderlands `` friendzone '' talks or da : i `` all of our women are ugly and not sexy since we do n't want to objectify them , also : cleavage and big breasts are evil '' characters do n't happen over night - and those are aaa games ! ), 
  all this nonsense may very well be an attempt of the given company to make itself look good in the eyes of the ~ ~ public ~ ~ media ( majority of which are heavily * influenced by the social justice activists , which makes them overly sensitive to any social justice issue ; resisting the sjws requires time , effort and going against the flow and that is why you do n't see that very often ) , but that 's just the beginning . 
  once you start to introduce more and more such people , you can end up like github . 
  those are the tech companies , i.e. 
  companies that actually have to produce something valuable . 
  i think that we do n't even have to talk about the online media / bloggers ... the likes of gawker , vox , etc. . . we know what the situation looks like there ( `` nuke it from the orbit , it 's the only way to be sure '' ) . 
  so , while the general public seems to be more aware of sjw menace than it was a few years ago , i do n't think it 's widespread enough just yet . 
  what 's worse , i think that we 're just starting to see the generation of students coming from universities that are heavily influenced by completely crazy levels of neo-progressivism ( sargon talks about the student bs in many videos ) , which may pump a reasonable amount of new social justice activists into the system . 
  \\* well , more than any other idology or groupthink . 
  `` jesus god damn christ , stop . 
  we 're gon na develop a nation of permanent children . '', 
  joe dropping the bombs !, 
  well , yeah , there 's not much logic in this movie . 
  about the close range : watch the movie , this scene in not as stupid in context as it seems by itself . 
  ( also , even if it was , i 'd have no problems with it , as i can see an iowa making a drift and then blasting the aliens to pieces :d ), 
  now that 's the spirit !, 
  i 'm glad you enjoyed it . 
  i love nicely written , smart stuff , especially drama ( ray donovan , house of cards , true detective ... love those ) , but i can also enjoy a stupid , but competent ( solid direction , good action scenes and choreography , visuals on point ) blockbusters like battleship or jurassic world . 
  it would seem that there are actually not that many people who can enjoy ( and critique ) both writing based movies and visuals based movies . 
  ( btw i 'm not saying a set of clips is a good movie , even `` crappy '' blockbusters still have to work as a story on the most basic level - and battleship does . ), 
   longer term sentence will be more effective in ** reforming ** these people, 
  i ** do n't ** want these people in the society , period . 
  45 years is the second best thing after a life sentence . 
  there is no `` reforming '' to be done in case of someone who is capable of stabbing a person 20 times . 
  such a person is either mentally ill ( as it seems in this case ) or a psychopath with no sense of empathy , either way , they need to be separated from the rest of the society ( by locking them up in a mental hospital or a prison ) . 
  since we ca n't * cure * schizophrenia or * fix * psychopathy , the sentence has to be for life or close to it . 
  i do n't want these people to live in inhumane conditions , but they have to be separated from the rest of the population in an effective way . 
  and even if you were right , which you 're [ absolutely not ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empathy#development ) , it would n't apply in this case , as she has schizophrenia and refuses to take meds . 
  this broken human being needs to be separated from the rest of the population , ideally for life . 
  i hope you 're a troll . 
  i really , really do . 
  what makes me `` overly fearful '' is that people like you can be found in positions of power . 
  that scares me . 
  what the fuck are you keep blabbering about ? 
  what ? 
  are you saying that you have to be a shining beacon of morality to not to kill someone in a planned , vicious way ? 
  half my brain died from the stupidity of your `` arguments '' . 
  moral consciousness has nothing to do with any of this and is more or less a social construct . 
  empathy , compassion is what keeps people from killing or harming other people ( or torturing animals , ... ), 
  reason , untempered by empathy , is just as likely to lead to terrible decisions , even tyranny and genocide as it is to lead to good judgment . 
  the reasoning leading to stuff like genocide , `` ethnic cleansing '' etc. 
  seems perfectly logical and moral to the people doing it . 
  suicide bombers are also a good example of people with a `` strong moral compass '' . 
  burning humans at the stake has been considered a `` moral '' thing to do not that long ago . 
  empathy is what prevents me from wanting these 13 year old killers to be killed . 
  the problem is that i feel more empathy towards their next potential victim . 
  so what to do ? 
  i do n't see a better solution than separation . 
  i do n't believe you can cure schizophrenia or that you can rely on these people to take their meds without constant supervision ( \\* ) . 
  and , like i stated already , i also do n't believe that you need to be 18 to be responsible for your actions as far as murder or torture goes as these are the things that require a significant lack of empathy to do . 
  you ca n't `` teach '' empathy to a 13 year old . 
  reduced empathy is a manifestation of a different brain structure that is a result of a presence of a certain set of genes and/or * early * physical abuse that [ physically changes the brain ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31714853 ) . 
  psychopaths [ can not be cured ] ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201408/psychopathic-criminals-cannot-be-cured ) . 
  \\* : close to where i live , there lived a schizophrenic woman , who attempted to murder a teacher in a school , she did not succeed ( only stabbed her ) , but took a 7 year old as hostage . 
  thankfully , the swat manged to save the hostage . 
  so , they locked her up , diagnosed her as a schizophrenic and puth her into a mental hospital for a bit . 
  after two years , the doctors cleared and released her with meds . 
  well , a few months after she was released , she stopped taking the meds . 
  she planned to go to a certain school and kill children there . 
  so she took a knife , got on a bus , got to the school and stabbed a 16 year old high school student to death as he tried to defend two girls she stabbed just before . 
  then she managed to stab two cops . 
  one of the dozens of articles about it : http://www.novinky.cz/krimi/350461-zena-na-stredni-skole-ve-zdaru-ubodala-studenta.html - these are the people you try to keep in the society . 
   you had a bad time in your life, 
  what the actual fuck am i reading here . 
  you do n't get locked away because you `` had a bad time in your life '' , you get locked up because you tried to end life of a human being . 
   reflexively vengeful savages, 
  so , people who want to live without fear for the lives of their children are `` reflexively vengeful savages '' . 
  that makes a ton of sense . 
  it really does . 
   keeping them removed after whatever the hell is wrong with them ** gets fixed **, 
  ah , so you actually might be an idiot . 
  for a moment , i thought you were just misguided . 
  how do you `` fix '' a murderer ? 
  please tell me . 
  you may change my mind . 
  oh the nipples must be free ... you 're just not welcome looking at them . 
  that 's ... interesting , since i 've been playing the test only yesterday evening and today a few hours . 
  weird , i 've never seen that ban once in 438 open beta battles and ~ 500 closed beta battles . 
  maybe i just never `` insulted '' the whole team before xd, 
  i 've seen it too . 
  thx , listening to youtube celebrities for half an hour ... not exactly my thing, 
  edit : hmm , seems like david joins in @ 20min , so . . not 30 :p, 
   ... cracked under pressure ... 
   ... under pressure ... 
   ... ** pressure ** ... 
  heheh ... 
  i 'm 99.9 % sure that they had zero problems of blocking it because it 's one of the `` uncomfortable '' subreddits ( uncomfortable for the reddit 's extremist progressive leadership ) that does n't exactly violate any of the reddit rules ... and so any `` outside '' factor that will bring it closer to being banned is welcome ( and of course , they will be blocking more in the future , you can be sure of that ) .
