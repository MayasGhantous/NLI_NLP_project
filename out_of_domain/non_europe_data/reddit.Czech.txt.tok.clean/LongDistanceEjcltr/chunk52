  you will ** never ** see any of subreddits progressives ( and/or social justice activists ) like banned anywhere in the world , even if it means that reddit will be blocked in the given country as a whole . 
  for example , homosexuality is a crime in many muslim countries ( and worthy of a capital punishment in 7 of them ) ... now watch reddit comply with the requests of the likes of saudi arabia to block these reddit sub-communities if the visitor comes from that country , lol . 
  is teabagging really `` being a dick '' ? 
  does it bother people that much ? 
  i 've always seen it as something playful , a `` ha ha !, 
  got you ! '', 
  moment . 
  i never raged about it and i 've been bagged like a million times , it 's just funny to me . 
  am i alone ? 
  well , not alone , as i see plenty of funny reactions to constant `` teabagging '' from youtubers like matimi0 , but a minority ? 
   a journalist present asked someone if they think #gamergate called in the bomb threat, 
  how does that make any sense ? 
  a journalist present asked someone if they think #gamergate called in the bomb threat ... on itself ? 
  why would #gamergate supporters do that ? 
  #gamergate called in . 
  hmm , i wonder if that person would ask the same thing only with #blacklivesmatter instead of #gamergate . 
  how can a movement that is open to anyone `` call in '' ? 
  that journalist needs to be on our radar . 
  some more slow motion shooting for the interested :,

  uhhh , ookay , but where is a , there needs to be b , otherwise there 's bias . 
  besides , how is that an `` unpleasant '' question ? 
  it 's just a bad question , nothing unpleasant about it . 
  it 's like asking the president of the usa if 9/11 was an inside job . 
  even if it was , they would not tell the journalist . 
  ever . 
  even if one of the bomb threats was from #gamergate supporters ( who knows , maybe some misguided attempt at making the spj meeting more visible ? 
  and/or having some beef with #gamergate `` celebrities '' ? 
  ) , they would never identify themselves as #gamergate supporters to the authorities . 
  that would be just incredibly dumb , why would anyone do that ? 
  the ** only ** groups that would benefit from calling in a bomb threat and identifying themselves as #gamergate supporters are :, 
  * trolls ( for obvious reasons ), 
  * false flag operators, 
  as [ occam 's razor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/occam%27s_razor ) states , the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should be selected ... so , given how previous #gamergate events ended up and given the number of people in the sjw circles being fine with bomb threats ( aimed at misogynerds of gamergate ) in the past , it 's pretty easy to put two and two together . 
   either a very leading question or the result of a massive lack of understanding of the situation, 
  +1 , that is exactly what i meant . 
  the reduced rudder shift times are a massive destroyer nerf . 
  the last thing destroyers need is more torpedo nerfs , i do n't understand . 
  do they balance the whole game `` shotgun style '' and just by tiers 1-5 ? 
  btw amagi rudder shift time from 20.4 to 12.1 ... that 's just crazy . 
  it almost seems like a typo as nc went from 20.4 to 19.6 . 
  weird . 
   as a nation we seem to be willing to live with it . 
  it 's amazing , really . 
  it 's not just you ( the usa ) , it 's the entire population living in countries with democratic regimes . 
  the vast majority of people just do not believe that this kind of thing could negatively impact their lives or the lives of their loved ones . 
  people know it 's bad , but they will not do anything about it because right now , it does n't affect them or anyone near them ( and those who it does affect are in per mille numbers ... or less ) and there is no easy way to solve it without significant effort and side effects . 
  there are so many political issues people care about ( and some can argue * should * care about ) far more than this that regular folk just do not find the will to fight this in any significant way . 
  that 's just human behavior , nothing distinctively `` murrican '' about it . 
  he does n't give a shit . 
  this whole `` tag em all ! '', 
  thing has been brought to admin attention numerous times and they will not do anything about it unless it becomes a big problem . 
  naturally , the definition of a `` big problem '' is nowhere to be seen and essentially means that the admins will do anything about it when and if they feel like it . 
  yeah ... 
  lol . 
  apparently i 'm banned there too , even though i 've never posted there or even visited that subreddit . 
  this is hilarious . 
  given what kind of a monumental shithole srs is , i ca n't say i 'm mad though ... so thanks srs mods !, 
  you really showed us this time xd, 
  refresh page . 
  you wo n't be subscribed . 
  as for voting , you ca n't be prevented from voting afaik . 
  unless you 're banned ( banned on the whole site , by the admins ) . 
  subreddits that hide downvotes ( for example ) , do it by using a css trick which you can easily bypass . 
  i 'm czech and i can assure you , there is no `` ranch ''  pretty much all sauces and dressings you can buy in tescos here describe it as `` american '' . 
  what 's the mouseup for ? 
  also , what 's the 50ms timeout for ? 
  ( for the people who do n't do js , that function downvotes everything on a page you run it at . ), 
  copy into browser address bar , press enter . . 
  yep ... thankfully , i did that in closed beta , i.e. 
  before the wipe :d, 
  that thing does n't exist for 22 years . 
  ( also , we do n't have a communist goverment for 26 years . ), 
  just sayin ' :p ( we 're a small country in central europe , i 'm not saying the americans should know about our history , we 're insignificant ), 
  yeah , i should have not say american , i meant any big english speaking country , e.g. 
  not canadians , because they know they are n't a real country and we also beat them regularly ( well ... until recently ) in hockey :p, 
  also , happy cake day, 
  now feel free to mercilessly downvote my ass , but is n't / u/throwaway _ 6787 also talking about their relationship ? 
  i do n't know much about their feud ( never got into it deep enough , i do n't really care ... outside of grayson and cryonism that is ) , but i 'm guessing their relationships lasted for some time before the zoe post and the beginning of gamergate . 
  \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ( downvoted myself :p ), 
  jesus people still complain about the mortar ? 
  there are so many things that need attention far more than the damned mortar , complaining about it is almost useless white noise . 
  btw i ca n't really sympathize with people who consider anything about the mortar as it is now `` a huge balance issue '' . 
  ehh , i do n't know , probably not much . 
  i mean it would certainly be nice to have some `` live ammo '' for discussions for once , but that 's about it . 
  look at the pao trial ... she lost , but the aligned media ( read : most of the media ) pretty much painted her as a martyr who sacrificed herself for woman rights . 
  she got handed a ceo position in a billion dollar company ( [ a position she had no resume for ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdycmgen_as ) , only connections and the fact that she is a woman ) . 
  then , after that went so well , she resigned and the media of course spinned that as a work of misogynist racist sexist redditor harassers and again , painted her as a martyr ( an actual quote from wong posted around : `` she is literally silicon valley 's number one feminist hero . '' ) . 
  soooooo , i would n't overestimate the facs too much , as the media is very good at filtering them and painting a picture they want . 
   op seems to have posted more real reasons, 
  no op didi n't post real reasons . 
  op posted a factoid known for almost two years . 
  why is it a problem ? 
  even that he does n't say !, 
  ( mortar has a limited range making it pretty much impossible to use effectively if you just stay in the base ... even on locker , if your team is n't pushed in , you have to move out with it . ), 
  also op does n't say how he thinks this should be addressed ( take it away in spawn ? 
  again , i say why ?
