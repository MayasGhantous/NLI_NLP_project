  btw i do n't believe for a single second that a majority of germans believe the current wave of mass immigration is good for their country . 
  not a god damn second . 
  that 's a `` franchise number '' , i.e. 
  with all the innumerable discounts and bundles . 
  i 'm talking about 400k copies at $ 20 before you see a single dollar of profit . 
  when i look at [ steamspy ] ( http://steamspy.com/app/319910 ) , it appears they 're yet to crack 50k copies ... and that 's including like 4 or 5 months of early access . 
  given the reception , they 'll be glad for 100k . 
  so , consoles to the rescue , i guess . 
   just keep living your life and allow others to do the same . 
  sure . 
  they can live a happy life in their country . 
  if they 're unhappy in their country , they should work on fixing what 's wrong with their country and not `` going to live with a neighbor because he has a nice house '' . 
  i di n't fuck up their country . 
  my country did n't fuck up their country either . 
  it 's ** not ** our moral obligation to help them by taking them all in . 
  we can help to alleviate their problems by either providing materialistic support or military support , but that has to happen in the country they 're coming from . 
  yeah , agreed !, 
  it has worked so well so far !, 
  [ / s ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlie_hebdo_shooting ), 
   it does n't matter if it 's good for our country . 
  stopped reading there . 
  enjoy whatever 's coming to you . 
  i do n't know about decades , but yes , this right here is the core of the issue . 
  people on reddit are somehow comparing taking in ** hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants ** with legitimate immigration processes . 
  serious wtf territory . 
  of course there should be ( and there must be ) a way to immigrate , but the process must be strict and controlled . 
  you know what the u.s. and australia do to illegal immigrants ? 
  they turn them back . 
  no exceptions . 
  what does the fucked up eu do ? 
  nothing . 
  open season . 
  let them stay , because the other option is somehow racist/bigoted/whatever . 
  how the hell did we get to this point ? 
  people are so easy to manipulate , it 's disgusting . 
  [ show a picture of an immigrant family with babies . 
  ] ( http://media.novinky.cz/264/502647-gallery1-cvnhx.jpg ) ( this is an actual picture of afghan immigrant family btw , used in many news stories about immigrants . ) . 
  let 's play the emotion card . 
  of course , we must provide for them !, 
  what kind of people are we if we 'll turn them back ? 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand suddenly anyone against mass immigration is a bigot . 
  what a beautiful way to do propaganda . 
   fucked up 3rd world country, 
  reddit 's solution to `` fucked up 3rd world countries '' ? 
  make europe a set of fucked up 3rd world countries too . 
   european interests, 
  european interests ? 
  u.s. interests , if anything . 
  the current instability in syria is a ** direct ** and ** factual ** result of u.s. politics ( and some people could say the rise of isis and most definitely al-qaeda can be traced to u.s. politics in the middle east ) . 
  if we 're going to play the guilt card , then the u.s. should take in by far the most refugees . 
   the u.s. turns them back if illegals are caught at the border . 
  this is what i meant . 
  caught at the border . 
  the eu and individual states have very benevolent approach to this and that is the main problem . 
  is the u.s. doing [ this ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-105630/refugees-allowed-italy-threat-drown-babies.html ) , for example ? 
  that is threat of genocide only if your intellect is on the level of a 12 year old . 
  the nazis ( or similar extremist parties ) and extreme nationalists get proportionally more support the bigger the immigration issue becomes . 
  that is a simple reality of life . 
  you can suppress these tendencies in society only to a certain point ( which - granted - is pretty far into `` we 're fucked now '' territory ) , after which a minority becomes a majority and then all is lost . 
  if these levels of immigrant influx stay the same ( let alone increase ) for the next decade , we could very well see extremists / white supremacists rise to power . 
  that would be only logical as neo-progressivism can keep you distracted from the reality of the world around you only for so long . 
  there is a balance , if you disrupt it , you 'll get a pushback of equal strength from the other side , that 's how these things work . 
  and if you think that the europe can take in millions of uneducated refugees and keep the quality of life the same as before , you dead wrong . 
  so dead wrong . 
  i 'm going to copypasta that well know , but great quote :, 
   those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . 
  i suggest you learn how hitler got to power , then speak to me about `` threat of genocide to get your ways '' . 
  you 're so naive it 's sad . 
  you may have `` explained this only a dozen or so times '' , but you did n't aswer the original question of this part of the thread you 're posting in . 
  and that is :, 
   did the admins ever shared the reasoning behind banning it ? 
  shitty gifs . 
  who . 
  point me to significant examples . 
  most of the neogaf `` exclusivity '' is a manufactured image . 
   banned from / r/offmychest , yay, 
  our badge of honor :p, 
  this is why i do n't get women that support them . 
  ( women that are for true equality , not for them to have it easier than men . ), 
  all this nonsense may be giving you credit in some ( small ) neo-progressive and 3rd wave feminist circles , but it actively undermines your legitimacy in the world at large . 
  the only thing that keeps these groups from being a laughing stock of the majority of the population is the tight grip of the media on the narrative , but even that is starting to change . 
  i mean , imagine having a rational feminist movement that would base all their arguments on peer reviewed studies and not random bullshit or circumstantial evidence , go after truly sexist behaviors and especially sexism built into the system , as opposed to going after individual people . 
  who would be opposed to that , if it was fair ? 
  but they do n't want that . 
  [ gee , i wonder why . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us1ipnlsgyy ), 
  the amount of sex negative stuff there is coming from the current feminism and aligned ideologies is so ridiculous , it has become a great example of the horseshoe theory . 
  concepts like male gaze . 
  just ... stop . 
  and think about yourself , what you 're doing and if that really helps society . 
  i do n't even know what those two things are . 
  are you talking about individual indie developers ? 
  btw links do n't work , login required . 
  jim sterling [ would say ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3hzhky/jim_sterlings_reponse_to_allegation_that_he_was/ ) `` it does not matter . 
  none of this matters . '', 
  partially ejected , i.e. 
  a part of him ejected , gnarly :p, 
  why would valve open the flood gates the way they did ? 
  the only reason i can think of is that they hoped it would increase the total sales . 
  well , seeing these graphs , that plan failed horribly as the total sales seem to be the same .
