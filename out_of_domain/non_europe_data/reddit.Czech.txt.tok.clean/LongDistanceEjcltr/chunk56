  a few years back , getting on steam meant something . 
  not so much anymore . 
  plus the customers ca n't really trust steam not to sell absolute crap anymore . 
  soooooo , steam not curating the store gives valve no advantage in terms of sales , but decreases the prestige and viability of their platform . 
  well , i think that we can consider the `` zero curation '' experiment to be a failure . 
   offloaded the curation work to the community, 
  they did n't offload it . 
  they ended it . 
  the community can not curate as the community gets into the process only after a game gets on steam and is already polluting the waters ( i.e. 
  the community can advise , but not curate ) . 
  greenlight is not enough to stop the trash since any publisher , regardless of size , can publish games on steam automatically ( and many of them abuse this ) . 
  not to mention that even a few shitty games got past greenlight through shady deals and buying votes . 
  even after all this , the community has proved time and time again that it can not be reasonably relied on to not buy shitty games ( great example : http://steamspy.com/app/348020 - it 's a carbon copy of hotline miami , only it 's made by just one or two people and [ everything about it is shit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dztlodsakvy ) - 15k copies sold ... 
  really ?!? ) . 
   but customers are n't going to leave en masse because of it, 
  but this is where you miss the point entirely . 
  the clear message from the graphs ( and the op after all ) is that even though `` customers may not to leave '' , the developers may leave ... because of simple economics . 
  the median is getting pretty damn low . 
  i 'm talking primarily about small-ish developer teams here ... teams that make middle of the road games ( in terms of budget ) , these smaller teams ( but still teams ) are most of the times the ones producing games that can both aspire to be something greater , but also not make yours eyes bleed as a result of shitty visuals , animations etc. 
  ( which is otherwise so widespread in all the one/two man indie games on steam ) . 
  these teams - unlike the crap producers - need some decent level of sales for their bussiness to remain viable . 
  if there 's not enough sales , these teams will either close shop or prioritize consoles ( which would mean even less quality pc games in the future as anything of value will be just ports ) . 
   mozilla is the one who still does put their money where their mouth is in terms of giving users freedom and control over their own experience . 
  [ sure ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3iim97/firefox_labels_gamergate_a_hate_campaign_in_an/ ) . 
  because it 's so fucking hard to tell people ... instead you play this `` i do n't want to mention him here because that will just give him more attention '' game , like you know better than any of us . 
  it 's patronizing bullshit . 
  also , it shows how much you believe in this community that half of us wo n't go support him . 
   to not give vultures the attention they crave, 
  that 's a great idea . 
  this community should n't expose , screenshot and archive bullshit , we should just silently watch , because otherwise we give the vultures the attention they crave . 
  that would work so well !, 
  now i do n't know who this `` vulture '' and a `` regular here '' is , so next time i ca n't take his material with a grain of salt , because you decided that it is the `` common bloody sense '' to keep that information from me . 
  why even mention it in the first place ? 
   kotaku in action is a community that condemns ** willful censorship ** , exclusion , harassment , or abuse . 
   it is a community that ** allows the exchange of information ** , supports the ongoing discussion of media ethics , and protects the right of the individual to embrace their personal interests in entertainment and fandom . 
  ^ you do n't have to do any of that , but do n't act as if you are doing some greater good . 
  you are n't . 
  [ skid row , los angeles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skid_row,_los_angeles ) . 
   free speech is a right , not a duty . 
  which part of `` you do n't have to do any of that , but do n't act as if you are doing some greater good . '', 
  did n't you understand ? 
   you ca n't force people to talk when they do n't want to - it 's an attack on their personal space . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  i 'm not forcing anyone do to anything . 
  and i do n't have a problem with people deciding not to talk about something . 
  what i do have a problem with is if people talk about something , but willfully keep the details for themselves and/or do n't present any evidence . 
  that 's what 's grinding my gears . 
  in this case the op willfully witholds crucial part of the information * because he thinks it 's for a greater good * . 
  it may be . 
  it may be not . 
  but the decision is mine , you do n't get to decide that for me * because reasons * , and if you do , do n't paint it as some kind of moral high ground . 
  it 's not , never was and never will be . 
  you want to keep it from me ? 
  ok , then shut the fuck up and do n't even talk about it if you do n't want to include the details , because at that point it 's nothing more than gossip that does n't even present anything to discuss . 
  somebody wrote something on twitter . 
  great . 
  super useful . 
   surprisingly , kia users usually instinctively downvote vulture shit like that . 
  yeah , ** surprisingly ** . 
  like [ i said ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/3iirpt/happenings_drama_trolls_are_using_images_of_the/cugvu4v ) :, 
   it shows how much you believe in this community, 
  savages . 
  nope . 
  carl gustav , for that extra spice . 
  male gaze intensifies ... ( \u0361o \u035c\u0296 \u0361o ), 
   bypassing the missile shield, 
  there is no missile shield ( as people tend to think about it ) . 
  that program [ failed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_defense_initiative ) a long time ago . 
  the us can [ maybe , with luck ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ground-based_midcourse_defense ) defend itself from a few icbms , but it has never been tested against a modern icbm and is more of a north korea precaution . 
  russia currently has 360 + deployed modern icbms able to deliver 1,250 + nuclear warheads . 
  good article : http://io9.com/heres-why-the-u-s-missile-defense-system-is-utterly-br-1573758902, 
  there are some really nice global changes it seems !, 
  weapon updates :, 
  - reduced damage of buckshot and flechette to lower performance at range, 
  - reduced number of pellets of uts , saiga , dao , dbv , m1014 to improve balance, 
  squad teamplay initiative updates :, 
  - the marksman bonus now gives a flat scoring bonus ( 25 points ) , but still displays the distance in parenthesis, 
  edit : why is uts on the list ? 
  it 's a pump action shotgun , the rest are semi-auto . 
  a typo ( uts instead of qbs ) ? 
  it is . 
  and that 's a good thing . 
  it is a direct response to people camping on a hill a mile away and going for those 1000 point headshots . 
  the amount of training rooms on the server [ is limited ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yzkqzpi.png ) ( do n't know how many ) and you pay for ammo ( but not repairs ) . 
  edit : you do n't pay for ammo , even though [ this says so ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jmnga4p.png ) . 
  i guess they mean future premium ammo ? 
  update 0.4.1 ( test # 3 ), 
  inb4 ~ ~ sjw ~ ~ admins ban that sub because ~ ~ `` muh feels '' ~ ~ `` it 's not moderated '' . 
  `` gulper catfish have evolved to be able to eat prey more than twice their size . '', 
  - owner of the video, 
  pretty crazy ... 
  it was at zero last time i tried the training mode ( 6 hours ago ? ) ... 
  and i fired a ton ( ~ 50 hits w / yamato ), 
  oh you can dislike whatever you want . 
  it 's only natural to dislike sexism and most people do . 
  but once you start banning subs left and right and talk about `` safe spaces '' , shit gets `` social justice warrior '' - y real fast . 
  besides , sexism works both ways and if you only go after sexism aimed at women , but not men , then i have to question your motives . 
  not to mention that half of the recent subreddit bans were shady as fuck , going as far as banning a bdsm subreddit and giving `` inactive mods '' as the reason for the ban . 
  ( or banning a subreddit dedicated to the critique of the neogaf online gaming forum just because is was called r/neofag . ), 
  same in czech : medv\u00eddek m\u00fdval ( washing bear ),
