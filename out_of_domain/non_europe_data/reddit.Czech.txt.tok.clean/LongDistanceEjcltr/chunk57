  / r/rarepepes, 
  like i 'm saying for a long time now , scouts teams are way too powerful and it appears much more people start to be annoyed by them as well . 
  something indeed needs to be done . 
  maybe further limit the maximum repair speed ? 
  i 'm at nc so far , anyone care to enlighten me , what is this issue about ? 
  people need to stop applying the `` i would never hit a woman '' on all situations . 
  that 's just a fucking retarded approach pushed by 3rd wave feminists and progressive extremists . 
  [ i would never * hit a woman * , but i would * hit her back * . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2ntfq3u2mo ), 
  ps : if you are a girlfriend/wife beater , you deserve to get your arms broken to shit , just sayin ' . 
  well , this is what happens when :, 
  * vehicles , let alone jets , do n't really get focus tested that much, 
  * ** you pretty much test the final patch branch for like a week on one map ** ( which was zavod night this time ) , then you go straight to cert and then it 's obviously full of bugs, 
  the fact is though , that even if dice did have a ton of servers up for testing all kinds of things , it would be close to useless , because even now we have serious issues with filling one or two servers . 
  nevertheless , if i remember correctly , the game sound was not working properly even in the release branch and it got fixed as one of the last things ( correct me if i 'm wrong , sometimes i miss the branch switch announcement ) . 
  i would expect the retail branch testing to be much , much more `` final '' and the testing period longer . 
  cte is ** really ** good for pushing bf4 as a game to whole new levels of awesome , but from my experience , it did n't really decrease the amount of critical bugs that appear in the patches that much . 
  which is not ideal , given the ea 's glacial patch interval pace . 
  the release branch should not be tested for just a week when your patch releases occur every 3 months . 
  also , as usual , fuck konami . 
  sse 4.1 problem [ fixed ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/287700/discussions/0/527274088382530730/ ) . 
   probably server performance more than anything, 
  well i 'm glad we have the `` issue '' icons now and one of them is supposed to give an indication the server performance is not acceptable ... 
  no , but seriously , i thought the cte has dealt with this ( it was specifically discussed many times and everyone agreed - including you - that before we can even think about 60 + hz tick rates , the server performance issues and diagnostics have to be nailed down ) and we could move on past all the server performance induced nonsense by showing the relevant icons on screen . 
  i see no icons in any of these hitreg/dusting videos . 
   it 's probably a server issue, 
  it would n't be the first time . 
  or second . 
  or third . 
  or fourth . 
  or fifth . 
   when you are old you stop giving shit . 
  hell , i 'm 28 and i 'm already beginning to notice that ... 
   an enterprising , albeit sociopathic , 15 year old could do the following : seduce a rich 30 year old by pretending to be 18 . 
  have him film them having sex . 
  release the tape on the internet secretly . 
  wait until it is all over the internet . 
  go to the fbi . 
  collect millions over the rest of her life . 
  given the exposure these threads tend to get ... 
  i would n't be that suprised if there was a person somewhere out there reading this and thinking about doing it . 
  man , tnl rocks !, 
  :d it 's a shame their compilations get deleted from yt often : /, 
  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2xv8yy_fail-compilation-spring-2015-tnl_fun :p, 
  that 's why there will be [ iter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iter ) ( under construction ) and [ demo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demo ) ( planned ) . 
   while there is no clear international consensus on exact parameters or scope , the following parameters are often used as a baseline for design studies : demo should produce at least 2 gigawatts of fusion power on a continuous basis , and it should produce 25 times as much power required for breakeven . 
   as a prototype commercial fusion reactor , demo could make fusion energy available by 2033 . 
  so we 're talking ~ 20 years ( ** !, 
  ** ) until a prototype commercial fusion reactor . 
  and ~ 30 for the first commercial nuclear fusion power plant . 
  i 'm not saying there are n't big hurdles in the way , but it saddens me when the general population and `` green '' activists alike tends to dismiss fusion as a pipe dream of a distant future . 
  it 's not . 
  you do n't have to be 20 to see it happen in your life time . 
   iter and demo could be looked at as some kind of scientific/political pyramid scheme . 
  like lhc is , right ? 
  ... who exactly is the one benefiting from this `` pyramid scheme '' ? 
  even if the project fails completely , the amount of money is peanuts compared to any other ventures whole nations engage in . 
  especially military-related ventures . 
  compare the * total * $ 13 billion cost of iter to the * annual * budget of the u.s. dod , which is over $ 600 billion . 
  the b-2 spirit program alone , for example , cost $ 45 billion and built just 21 bombers . 
  i say let 's waste even more money on `` scientific pyramid schemes '' , it 's better than wasting it on war . 
  and it 's important that nations invest into these projects because private companies will not ( no company on earth has 20 billion sitting around to invest into some potential technology that may or may not pan out in 30 years ) and i 'd even say they should n't ( = avoiding the issues with patents and greed ) . 
  taxpayer money should be spent on well being of the citizens , both current and future . 
  the programs like iter and lhc are exactly the kind of programs that should receive our money . 
  education , science , research & development are among the most important investment opportunities any goverment can take ( in the long run ) . 
  the only thing that compares is infrastructure ( in the short to medium time scales ) . 
  any economist will tell you this . 
   $ 13 billion, 
  that is close to $ 20 billion or more than that ( the dollar is strong now compared to the euro , it was n't a few years back ) . 
  [ iter is not just another university lab experiment ] ( https://www.iter.org/img/crop-900-90/all/content/com/img_galleries/site_round_up_small_tok.jpg ) . 
  wait wait waaaaait , you 're now attacking [ muh feels ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w9sii5r.png ) with logic , man ... not cool . 
  that story and pictures are literally all over the internet now , pretty much every single media out there published it within 24 hours of each other and created a perfect media storm . 
  if that is n't propaganda , i do n't know what is . 
   david cameron will bow to pressure from the public and his own mps and announce plans to let ` thousands ' more syrian refugees come to the uk . 
   the prime minister faced a wave of outrage yesterday , after he took more than 24 hours to respond to shocking pictures of three-year old syrian boy aylan kurdi 's body lying on a turkish beach after he , his brother and their mother drowned in an attempt to reach europe by boat . 
  so they 're defending the lesser evil , good enough for me . 
  pussy murricans did n't want boots on the ground even though they caused this shit in the first place . 
  stfu and gtfo , that 's the message murricans need to receive , regardless of its origin . 
   `` lesser evil '' my ass . 
  so what you 're saying is that assad is worse than isis . 
  as evidenced by the hundreds of thousands of refugees escaping syria before the u.s. created the isis menace . 
  there were no hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees during his rule . 
  ooops , your ass indeed . 
   a shitty argument to use, 
  because ... you said so ? 
  wow , some next level logic !, 
  you can do one of the folowing :, 
  * bomb the place to hell ( which is 100 % ineffective and creates more recruits than it kills , and that 's a fact ) - this is what the pussy murrica does now, 
  * support assad, 
  * support isis - this is what the pussy murrica did in the past, 
  yep . 
  assad it is . 
  that 's your fsa . 
  a joke for the weak minded . 
  also , if you think isis exists because of any other reason than as a direct result of the u.s. politics in the middle east , especially iraq , you 're naive . 
  probably many . 
  we have no way of telling what is the truth though , except by extrapolating from the numbers of syrian refugees ... and those numbers paint a pretty obvious picture . 
   while there are some similarities with poland its not quite the right thing . 
  hehe , not quite , but we have good relationships with our polish neighbors ... for the most part that is :p . [ west slavic peoples ] ( https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_peoples#/media/file:slavic_europe.svg ) were always pretty close . 
  ( for example , i 'm czech , but my father is slovak and my grand mother on the mother 's side was polish .
