  am i the only one who is fucking scared of any new patches at this point ? 
  after the initial batch of stabilizing ones there have been very few that did n't mess up something really bad . 
  spaghetti code much ? 
  i know very well what does it mean , i have to deal with it at work regularly :d, 
  but i do n't need to explain myself , because we have wikipedia these days ... so you 're free to look up what spaghetti code means . 
   spaghetti code is a pejorative term for source code that has a ** complex and tangled control structure ** , especially one using many gotos , exceptions , ** threads ** , or other `` unstructured '' branching constructs . 
  it is named such because program flow is conceptually like a bowl of spaghetti , i.e. 
  twisted and tangled . 
  spaghetti code can be caused by several factors , including inexperienced programmers and a ** complex program which has been continuously modified over a long life cycle ** . 
  emphasis mine . 
  sounds exacty like fb3 . 
  you 're also free to look up public statements related to fb 's modding support ( several tools and long baking process is needed to do basic stuff , therefore there is no modding support planned ) and anecdotal evidence ( here on reddit ) of how complex/messy fb3 's threading is ( one of the early reasons given as to why there are so many bugs and synchronization issues was that the threading is complex and there are many configurations . . as if fb3 is the only engine that has to deal with treads and as if there were no ps4 versions crashing all the time ) or serious technical issues in the latest nfs . 
  just look at the nature of some of the ( re ) introduced bugs ... one for all : if you put a silencer on weapon x the whole server loses sound . 
  i mean , really ? 
  how do you manage to do that ? 
  well , i guess , in bach 's own words : `` i 's magic !, 
  much smart , wow, 
  wow [ .

  yeah , like you `` resolved '' vietnam , afghanistan etc. 
  btw this happens way more often than you might think . 
  it 's not that often you manage to hit a heli and when 1/3 of these do not connect , it 's pretty fucking frustrating . 
  very few people are capable of reasonable ui critique . 
  usability , typography , aesthetics . 
  look at web design , everyone is a critic of `` redesigns '' , but if you 'd ask them what and more importantly * why * and * how * would they change it , they usually do n't know . 
  which is ok , but hardly a constructive criticism . 
  so that 's probably why we do n't see more of ui critiques . 
  no packet drop icon , no fps drops ... dear dice , you need a new excuse !, 
   i 'm not sure i accept your premise . 
  battlefield 4 has been an exceedingly successful product on both consoles and pc . 
   updated the handling of the 1x scopes for type95b1 , a91 , steyraug , sar21 , qbz951 , famas , utas , mtar , l85a2 , and f2000, 
  anybody knows what 's this all about ? 
   fix for an exploit that would allow players to shoot two tank shells with not enough delay between shots, 
  is that the staff shell delay ? 
  nice !, 
  lots of gameplay fixes and tweaks : http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/forum/threadview/2955065226050471362/, 
  thank you , ps4 betatesters :p, 
   the aug is the better choice by far ;, 
  not at all . 
  * aug a3 pulls to the to left ( 0.35-0 .25 ) . 
  l85a2 's horizontal recoil is symmetric ( 0.25-0 .25 ) . 
  * while the aug a3 has 40 % less upwards recoil , it also has 38 % higher first shot recoil multiplier . 
  l85a2 has the lowest first shot recoil multiplier of all the ars ( 1.5 x ) . 
  if you decide to play to l85a2 's strenghts and put an angled foregrip on it , the first shot recoil multiplier drops to just 1.005 x !, 
  pop a muzzle brake on it , making the upwards kick 0.3225 per shot , and it becomes a fucking laser beam ... with 800rpm and quite good hipfire accuracy . 
  in other words , it 's a beast . 
  that 's how american propaganda works . 
  nothing new really . 
  lol !, 
  not when crouched :p, 
  we will see how `` not damaged '' it really is within a year . 
  my prediction : the next bf game will sell the least of all battlefield games since bfbc2 and visceral will get disbanded . 
  not at all . 
  their initial numbers are interpolated , but historical data is very accurate . 
  well , at least according to pachter , they tend to stay withing 0.1 m of the `` real '' numbers ( keep in mind that they do not track any digital sales ) . 
  and i 'm sorry , but i tend to believe pachter more than some internet random . 
  no offense . 
  you can list first 10 weeks ( in the global tab ) . 
  btw afaik the first 10 weeks of a boxed copy are absolutely critical , especially because the profit margins are the highest . 
  the further you get from the release the less important the sales become . 
  to the point when ea does n't give a single fuck and gives out dead space for a dollar . 
  they 're fine tuning origin 's akamai servers for the fastest download speeds !, 
  sitting tank = dead driver . 
  that 's why we may drive away even if we know you 're repairing . 
  pffffffft ... [ august ames ] ( http://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=augustames/gender=f/august-ames.htm ) is the one you should be linking to . 
  well , i 'm using `` full speed '' forward/reverse to outmanoeuvre the opponent in 1 v 1 or 1 v 2 situation , it makes me harder to hit , it 's not rocket science . 
  and it became soooo much easier after people stopped abusing the staff shell . 
  you generally position yourself at an 45-90 degree angle ( ideally going in and out of cover ) and fire at your opponents from the furthest distance you can ( effectively ) kill them . 
  many people , surprisingly , do not run sabot shell , so you can literally drive away from their incoming shell 's path while delivering yours quite easily . 
  so let me get this straight , the sraw double whammy was removed from the game because it has been deemed too powerful / unfair , potentially doing 50 damage . 
  but now you can do ** 68 damage ** with a lock-on weapon !, 
  it is and it always was . 
  but stinger is fire and forget , igla needs you to hold the lock . 
  btw the situation with the igla is not that bad because of the movement speed of aerial vehicles in the game ( compared to ground vehicles ) and its short range . 
  shotgun blast to the face without a scratch is far more immersion breaking to me ... :d, 
  btw bunny hopping was an issue when you could shoot mid air . 
  banning for it now is beyond retarded . 
  wtf, 
  while nice , keep in mind that this has nothing to do with releasing any `` game engine '' . 
  these are just the tools you * may * use to shorten the development of your own tools . 
  tl ; dr : this is not unity/udk/freesdk / ogre , it 's a framework for people planning to make their own game engine and their own tool chain . 
  these are ** game ** authoring/development tools . 
  nobody ( except a few indies ) develops on linux . 
   what does it mean though ? 
  planning to make your own game engine ? 
  you may wish to check their framework out before investing time into your own solutions . 
   what does it affect and who does it affect ? 
  indie developers get an easier access to quality middleware , apparently free of charge . 
  i 'm not sure many aaa studios would be interested in this . 
  because visual studio . 
  because ** game ** development . 
  because 3ds max and maya are industry standards . 
  because photoshop . 
  all you 're talking about is * the possibility * . 
  sure , it 's possible . 
  blender is even popular among hobbyist developers . 
  but what is the real question is if it 's viable in serious development and how much is it used in the real word . 
  of course , the elephant in the room is unity , but that is a full toolchain/engine capable of deploying to anything from android to windows . 
  what we 're discussing here is making your own engine from scratch . 
   if the same authorship tools were available on linux,
