  lol . 
  you 'd better look up who manages offmychest and shitredditsays . 
  that 's the real stormfront . 
  srs cancer and its mod team are nothing more than fascists hidind behind social justice masks . 
  their influence is real and spreading . 
  most importantly , their actions are documented and archived . 
  plus they 're directly supported by the site admins . 
  on the other hand , i highly doubt that any neo-nazi forum will be able to considerably and consistenly influence reddit defaults . 
  nonsense . 
  there 's just not enough voting power to do that . 
  you just do n't like what the majority of people in the news subs seem to think and so you try to dehumanize those people by calling them nazis . 
   some people do happen to prefer 30 to 60, 
  are there people who happen to prefer [ compressed jpeg image quality ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qezhxp-pdos ) instead of crisp loseless png image quality ? 
  maybe . 
  but that just means there are individuals with broken eyes on this planet and not that it 's okay to start using compressed jpegs for images that are supposed to be clear . 
  let 's look at some of the objective advantages of a higher framerate ( no subjectivity here so `` preference '' is a moot point ) :, 
  * framerate is usually directly tied to the latency of game logic as in most games that runs at the framerate frequency ( tick events ) . 
  * physics engines usually sample at a rate much higher than the framerate ( e.g. 
  300hz ) , so the game 's framerate does n't affect that , but your interaction with physical actors is still much more precise at higher framerates ( e.g. 
  you can push a crate for a minimum of just 16.66 ms instead of 33.33 ms ), 
  * the quality of some effects ( like motion blur or temporal supersampling , generally stuff that works with motion vectors ) is tied to the framerate . 
  those effects simply produce better results at higher framerates . 
  * when the brains of the humans playing the game have more frames to work with , they can react to a change on the screen faster . 
  the average human reaction time may be around 250ms , but that 's for the whole loop , i.e. 
  display device - eye - brain - hand - input device . 
  the actual time it takes from the activation of the photoreceptors in your eyes to the beginning of the processing of that infromation by the brain is much , much lower . 
  nerve impulse travel speed is around 100 m/s . 
  if we say the distance between your eyes and the back of your head is 1/5m , your brain can begin to process the visual information in 2ms ( 500 fps ) . 
  and [ this comment ] ( https://archive.is/9zif4 ) and the research behind it seems to confirm that ballpark number . 
  weird as in ... 
  i do n't know , smooth ? 
  battlefield 4 has dynamic waves that affect gameplay . 
  and pretty much runs even on a potato . 
   feels foreign to me, 
  but ... why ? 
  how ? 
  a coworker has a few years old netbook with an amd apu . 
  it 's something i would consider `` russian levels of potato computer '' ( it 's fine for office work , but not much else ) . 
  the game runs horribly , like 5-15fps and the sound is all fucked up ( most likely due to a weak cpu ) . 
  wows runs fine on any somewhat decent gaming pc , but it 's far from something i 'd call `` can run on russian level of potato computer '' ... just sayin ' :d, 
  removed extra seats, 
  yeah ^ i ^ wish ^ ... 
   conscious reactions are closer to a 500ms delay for the average human . 
  thanks for the idea . 
  my range was off , but the average is nowhere near 500ms . 
  i changed the range in my post from 100-150ms to 250ms . 
   it was , overall , a buff, 
  so , losing the ability to ohk scouts/ahs is a buff to you . 
  tagged you as `` it was , overall , a buff '' for future reference . 
  the rocket is faster ( i do n't know which patch did that , may not have been this last one ) , turn angle min higher , turn angle max lower , turn angle multiplier higher , you do the math . 
  if i had to say how it * feels * to * me * , then i 'd say it 's now much easier to hit aircraft . 
  as for the actual numbers related to the turn radius ( well , at least as far as the last patch notes go ) :, 
  * increased minimum turn angle from 0 to 2, 
  * increased turn angle multiplier from 2 to 3, 
  * decreased max turn angle from 35 to 30, 
   my guess is that they want it to be a more anti-ground armor orientated, 
  damage vs tanks ( at 90 degrees ) :, 
  * 19 front, 
  * 29 side, 
  * 44 back + critical ( immobilize ), 
  compare that to the rpg :, 
  * 23 front, 
  * 35 side + critical ( low power ), 
  * 55 back + critical ( immobilize ), 
  ** tl ; dr : not really **, 
  hehe , you could also say triple tap ( transport heli ) or quadruple tap ( tank side armor hit ) :p, 
   can the mods please delete this ? 
  you want this deleted because you do n't like what it says ? 
  so mature ... lol . 
   it 's incredibly misleading . 
  no , it 's not . 
  everything in the title is 100 % true . 
  all the numbers mentioned in the op are factual . 
   but it got a huge buff in every other aspect , turning radius , turn speed , time to live etc etc. 
  who cares ? 
  frist of all , i mention some of that in the op :, 
  `` the missile is much faster though . 
  it appears to me that the sraw is now a more newbie friendly launcher at the cost of its ultimate potential . '', 
  and [ another post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/3knwol/cte_sraw_is_no_longer_a_ohk_launcher_against/cuyzed9 ) in the thread . 
  second , which `` huge '' buffs are we talking about here ? 
  this is the complete list of sraw changes in this patch ( copied from patch notes ) :, 
   reduced damage from 215 to 186, 
   increased initial speed from 15 to 30, 
   increased engine strength from 25 to 30, 
   increased tracking range from 450 to 500, 
   changed the physics property from missile to tankshell, 
   increased minimum turn angle from 0 to 2, 
   increased turn angle multiplier from 2 to 3, 
   decreased max turn angle from 35 to 30, 
  third , the only opinionated sentence in the op is `` it appears to me that the sraw is now a more newbie friendly launcher at the cost of its ultimate potential . 
  '' , which - if anything - is supported by your argument about the sraw being buffed in other aspects . 
   it is misleading, 
  all the numbers i listed are facts . 
  and play directly into my only opinion in the op : `` it appears to me that the sraw is now a more newbie friendly launcher at the cost of its ultimate potential . '', 
   and you want to tell me i 'm immature . 
  `` who cares ? '', 
  followed by 3 arguments . 
  and yes , you are immature . 
   i quoted you in that case with `` who cares '' . 
  got it now ?
