  who cares about the sraw not being ohk anymore ? 
  an order of magnitude more people than care about its minor buffs . 
  how is that relevant in any way now ? 
  obviously people complained about things that were nerfed and not about things that were not changed at all . 
  as for the current situation , if i had to use rpg terminology , the sraw got -10 points in strength , +1 in agility and +1 in speed . 
  it 's now more attractive to noobs because they 'll `` hit some stuff '' with it . 
  no skilled sraw user will consider the minor buffs significant in any way , shape or form in the face of the brutal damage nerf . 
  not true . 
  i tried it multiple times a few hours ago . 
   what 's your fucking problem ? 
  what is my problem ? 
  i 'm not the one who is apparently unable to comprehend the fact that agility changes are minor compared to the damage nerf . 
  completely minor and insignificant to anyone who used the sraw before . 
  it 's now a different launcher . 
  100 % of people who used the sraw used it for those rare one shot kills . 
  that is no longer possible . 
  what 's so hard to understand here ? 
   the war was considered part of the cold war . 
  due to its length it has sometimes been referred to as the `` soviet union 's vietnam war '' or the `` bear trap '' by the western media , [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] and thought to be a contributing factor to the fall of the soviet union . 
   another result of the war was the training and indoctrination of thousands of so-called afghan arabs , foreign islamists who came to wage jihad against the atheist communists . 
  while their military impact in afghanistan was negligible , notable among them was a young saudi named osama bin laden , whose arab group eventually evolved into al-qaeda . 
  what became of al-qaeda is well known . 
  then we have invasion of afghanistan . 
  then iraq ( wmds bro , wmds . 
  also , hussein is hitler ! ) . 
  destabilization of regimes in other countries , e.g. 
  lybia ( gaddafi is hitler ! ), 
  and syria ( assad is hitler ! ) . 
  even now , your government openly admits that cia has trained ( and still trains ) and logistically supports `` anti-assad '' rebels who then go to war in syria ( and many of which ultimately end up with isis ) . 
   u.s. officials said the cia has trained and equipped nearly 10,000 fighters sent into syria over the past several years -- meaning that the agency is spending roughly $ 100,000 per year for every anti-assad rebel who has gone through the program . 
   the cia declined to comment on the program or its budget . 
  but u.s. officials defended the scale of the expenditures , saying the money goes toward much more than salaries and weapons and is part of a broader , multibillion-dollar effort involving saudi arabia , qatar and turkey to bolster a coalition of militias known as the southern front of the free syrian army . 
  ( [ source ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/lawmakers-move-to-curb-1-billion-cia-program-to-train-syrian-rebels/2015/06/12/b0f45a9e-1114-11e5-adec-e82f8395c032_story.html ) ), 
   so the first half of your paragraph you admit that the soviet union 's invasion of afghanistan permanently destabilized the country and kicked off the jihadist movements there . 
  are you really so naive or are you playing dumb ? 
  what about reading up on who made those jihadists . 
  who the fuck do you think trained and indoctrinated those foreign islamists during the cold war ? 
  aliens ? 
  your lack of knowledge about your own country 's history is shocking . 
   the moment you mention that you are even slightly worried about the situation , they call you a filthy nazi . 
  this dude is not kidding . 
  just last week i saw multiple people ( and even one mod ) on other subreddits claim that the news subs on reddit are terrible , racist and are brigaded by stormfront . 
  i wish i was making this up . 
  cdu is a catch all `` center '' party . 
  merkel ( and by extension germany ) had a very lax approach to immigration lately ( or at least she wanted to appear so ) and was very vocal about her support of what is essentially a `` social justice '' issue , not a war refugee issue . 
  hardly an agenda `` right-wing government '' will push . 
  in the u.s. they 'd probably call cdu leftist ( as they are often calling their democrats ) . 
  merkel , especially lately , would be center left . 
  i disagree . 
  there is an essential difference between a user and a mod . 
  all opinions are welcome at the user level , but extremes ( of any kind ) must not be allowed to get to power . 
  that 's how srs control spreads to other subs . 
  mods should be held to a far higher standard than any regular user and should be as neutral as possible . 
  reddit 's control structure of the subs leadership is not democratic , so once you make someone a mod , it 's very hard to get rid of them . 
   also many will destroy their original documents . 
  border policy in europe is almost unenforceable . 
  that 's exactly how it works in some ( most ? ), 
  european countries now . 
  once the refugees get where they want to be , they destroy any documents that could prove they 're from country x. 
  the authorities ca n't deport them , since they simply do n't know where to send them . 
  they 're usually relocated into some refugee camp , but obviously they ca n't be held there indefinitely , and so after a few weeks ( at least i think it 's a few weeks , and i 'm pretty sure it 's some eu law ) , the authorities will just let you out . 
  welcome , citizen !, 
   i am he . 
  i 'm not a native speaker of english , so pardon my lack of knowledge , but why it 's not `` i am him . '' ? 
  how 's the situation in iraq now ? 
  is it better ( overall ) than before the u.s. invasion or worse ? 
   maybe if they had an actual gun bench, 
  was n't hardline supposed to have something like that ? 
  unsurprisingly , it never happened ... 
  more like viscerald :p, 
  at this point , i really need that `` no north korea '' filter button . 
  i 'd love to read more , it 's really hard to judge the situation just from the media and even documentaries can have some biased tendencies . 
  everyone in the west says hussein was a terrible tyrant who was a threat to the stability of the region . 
  i wonder how the iraqis actually viewed his rule . 
  and how they view it now , in restrospect . 
   absolute hate, 
  lmao . 
  you forgot to mention stormfront . 
  some of those changes are terrifying . 
  i have a ** very ** bad feeling about this . 
  they 'll mess the game up and before they manage to fix all that nonsense , the bf4 support will end ( code lockdown and stability testing for the christmas patch will most likely occur at the end of october or something like that ... not much time left ) . 
  and merkel now looks like an irresponsible cunt . 
  in the video , you say : `` i 'm just gon na take my money somewhere else '' . 
  and i ask : where ? 
  where are you going to take your money ? 
  ** wows has no competition whatsoever ** . 
  it 's not that wargaming are the best , they 're the only one . 
  until gaijin entertainment gets their version of wows out , we can either play wows or nothing . 
  there are no other games with warships . 
  the talk about this game not being up to your consumer standard is well and good , but as you say , it 's very much just your opinion . 
  for example , most people do n't even care about replays , let alone their quality . 
  granted , even though i can say that statement is based on conventional wisdom , i ca n't actually prove it . 
  what i can prove , however , is that the vast majority of games on the market today do not have * any * demo recording built in . 
  it 's just not a standard or expected feature of a video game these days . 
  also , that loading/ssd complaint sounds so , so naggy to me . 
  wows is n't even that big , it 's just 14 gigs . 
  you should try to play battlefield 4 , which has 58 gigs and loads a map for like 2-3 minutes when played from a standard hdd . 
   self-declared ** right-winger **, 
   this is starting to get ** problematic ** .
