  that 's just priceless . 
  and hilarious . 
  if there were textbooks on `` sjw speak '' , this would be in them . 
   no thanks i wo n't try battlefield 4 because i do n't want to spend my money on that shitty game, 
  a `` shitty game '' played by about the same number of people as wows right now ( [ 100k + of concurrent players ] ( http://bf4stats.com ) is a pretty regular number ; 106k at the moment of this writing ) ... 2 years after the release . 
  and wows is f2p . 
  i guess it 's not that shitty . 
  not that it matters , since i obviously mentioned it just for the ssd size taken / loading time comparison . 
   then again i have the witcher 3 and mgs v sitting here , both of which are far more advanced, 
  advanced in what ? 
  rendering ? 
  more than wows ? 
  maybe . 
  probably . 
  everything else is debatable . 
  loading times are usually a trade-off and highly variable across engines and even games built on top of those engines . 
  frostbite has ( by far ) the most advanced renderer out of the games you listed ( and together with ue4 , the most advanced one in the world ... that is once the latest iteration with pbr hits after nfs 2015 gets released ) , yet it can load maps for minutes . 
  it 's not always about being the most `` advanced '' . 
  loading times are heavily influenced by the design of the game . 
  if the game requires huge maps loaded all at once ( as wows and bf4 do because you need to see/simulate the whole thing , but witcher or tpp does not because there is no need - witcher can stream in stuff in close proximity to you as it 's not requred for you to see the whole map at any given point and tpp has pretty small `` open level '' type of maps ) , the loading times will be longer . 
  yes , loading times are annoying , but i 'll take long loading times over lower fps and/or visual quality any day of the week and , as i said , you ca n't avoid them in certain types of games . 
  `` x looks better and loads faster than y , therefore y is shit '' is a position of someone who does n't know what they 're talking about . 
   i do n't have to play a ship game, 
  yes , you do n't . 
  but that 's not an argument . 
  the witcher 3 and/or mgs v may compete with wows in your personal and * current * free time dedicated for gaming , but they do not compete in the video games market . 
  not by a longshot . 
  i could kinda see your argument if you used some other competitive multiplayer game that is focused on keeping your attention for months or even years at a time ( as you can only have so many `` daily drivers '' in your competitive gaming life ) , but comparing it to a story driven single player rpg or a stealth single player tps ? 
  that just does n't add anything of value to the discussion . 
  and speaking of adding value to the discussion , if found your graphs to be lacking . 
  to say the least . 
  your video probably got upvoted a lot because a big portion of the community mostly agrees with your comments about the balance ( as do i ) , not for its inherent value . 
  i do n't know what kind of research you 're used to , but coming from battlefield ( especially its cte program ) and other competitive shooters , i 'm used to seeing real numbers pulled out of the config files or computed on top of the actual player base metrics . 
  what you plotted in your graphs are some random numbers based on your own opinion ( this is 6.7 because ... reasons ) and then you based your other arguments on that . 
  no it 's not fair by any means . 
  the eu does n't make money out of thin air . 
  all the money comes from the economies of the individual countries ( mostly as a small percentage `` tax '' paid from the state 's income ) and eu import duties . 
  not really . 
  it 's pretty much just a trade and citizen migration agreement . 
  it 's nowhere near the u.s. model , for example . 
  the eu just produces directives and guidelines , they 're not laws and individual countries implement them as they see fit . 
  plus , they can ( and they do ) ask for exceptions . 
  another angle of looking at this is to take the history of central and eastern european countries into account . 
  many of these countries have a painful history of being told what to do by the big boys , especially ussr . 
  and even before that , they were considered to be second class states that are [ not worth fighting for ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/munich_agreement ) . 
  it 's all fine and well as long as you keep the eu within the limits of what it was inteded to provide ... once the eu starts to push for more , let alone to allow the big players to disregard the wishes of the smaller ones ( refugee quotas are a ridiculous idea that goes against the agreed upon dublin regulation ) , shit is going to hit the fan . 
  his girlfriend is ugly and rich . 
  let 's try that again , now with the [ rpg-29 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30wpb_cykck ) :p, 
  interesting bits from the notes :, 
  * conquest capture is now 400 points from 150 . 
  * obliteration bomb pickup is now 150 from 100 . 
  * obliteration bomb possesion ( tick ) is now 25 instead of 10, 
  * rush crate disarm is now 500 instead of 400 . 
  * rush crate destroy ( team wide ) is now 500 instead of 400 . 
  * conquest win ribbon value is now 3000 instead of 1500, 
  * rush win ribbon is now 3000 instead of 1500, 
  * obliteration win ribbon is now 3000 instead of 1500, 
  tea bag is love, 
  high mouse dpi is not good , especially for training muscle memory . 
  all mice have actual cpi resolution of the sensor and then the marketed dpi resolution , which is interpolated ( and less precise ) . 
  most professional players use values like 400 or 800 dpi . 
  american leadership has proven with iraq ( ... and afghanistan before that and iran before that ) that they are lying pieces of shit that only care about their own bottom line , so regardless how `` evil '' assad really is ( [ seems like a reasonable guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=welcdcpsw6m ) to me ) , i would n't do or trust anything the us does . 
   routinely bombs civilians , and was probably responsible for a chemical weapon attack, 
  says who ? 
  the cia ? 
  i remember how they handled [ milosevic and kosovo war ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czjytbfqfak ) . 
  fuck them . 
  and who is even a civilian in syria ? 
  it seems to me that you can call half the rebels `` civilians '' , depending on which side of the conflict you are and what you want to see . 
  and bombed with what ? 
  both the israel and the us routinely kill more civilians than terrorists during air strikes . 
  saying `` routinely bombs civilians '' means shit without context . 
  as for the `` probably responsible for a chemical weapon attack '' ... at this point , i have to laugh . 
  probably ? 
  is he ? 
  or is he not ? 
  where 's the proof ? 
  forgive me when i do n't trust the same people who screamed `` wmds bro ! '', 
  before invading iraq and then found none . 
   stephen rapp , the united states ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues , has argued that assad 's crimes are the worst seen since those of nazi germany . 
  ^ if that is n't propaganda , i do n't know what is . 
   routinely, 
  does n't mean all the time , so your average is nice and all , but a ) not what i was talking about and b ) a number you pulled out of your ass . 
  the only numbers i could find for the latest us raids are [ these ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/us-led-air-strikes-on-isis-targets-killed-more-than-450-civilians-report ) [ two ] ( http://www.syriahr.com/en/2015/06/about-3000-people-including-162-civilians-killed-in-us-coalition-airstrikes-on-areas-in-syria/ ) . 
   among the deaths , there are a family of a man , his wife and their 5 children killed due in us - led coalition airstrikes on the village of dali hasan in east of the town of serrin in northeast of aleppo and 64 civilians killed by a massacre committed by the u.s led coalition warplanes on friday 's night in 04/30/2015 when they targeted bir mahli village near the town of serrin in aleppo with several air strikes , and the death toll of this massacre includes :, 
   * 31 children under the age of 16 including ( 16 females and 15 males ) . 
   * 19 women above the age of 18 . 
   * 13 men above the age of 18 . 
   * a 18 years old boy . 
  routinely killing more civilians than terrorists just means that they do n't give a shit ( and there 's nobody who can bring them to justice ) , not that they do it on purpose ... which was the argument i used for comparison with the claim that assad `` routinely bombs civilians '' . 
  as for the israel ... well , there 's plenty of evidence of bombed palestinian hospitals and schools . 
  ( and people burned by white phosporus . ), 
   kinda fucked up imo, 
  yep . 
  the pc people would like to shame you for saying this , but some cultures are just not as good as others ( at least as far as being humane goes ) . 
  clearly, 
  it was very much awesome , thank you !, 
  ( even though i was a bit disappointed that f.e.a.r. 
  's ai did n't get a honorable mention . ), 
  ps : the editing is world class , you do n't see that often with youtube producers .
