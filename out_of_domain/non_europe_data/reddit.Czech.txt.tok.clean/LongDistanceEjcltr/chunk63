   racists, 
  islam has nothing to do with race . 
  it 's like saying that being against christianity is racist . 
  complete nonsense . 
  as for bigots ... there are valid criticisms of islam based on its very core of values and approach to non believers . 
   a note has been added to your profile, 
  i do n't understand why are you telling this to me . 
   please remain civil . 
  campaigning again islam is the most civil thing you can do . 
   disallowed comments : hate speech directed towards an entire group of people like an ethnicity , religion or nationality . 
  i 'll wait until next time people freely shit on the likes of scientology here and we 'll see how swiftly your power tripping mod ban hammer comes . 
  yeah , right . 
  like that will ever happen . 
  ps : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj0xfpu6hgw you ca n't stop the truth . 
  you can only slow it down . 
   some people do think that brown = muslim, 
  yeah , i bet `` some people '' do . 
  like 1 % of the `` people '' . 
  you would n't believe it , but `` some people '' believe in xenu . 
  crazy , right . 
  sigh . 
   1 % of the people is 700 million . 
  more like 73 million . 
  it 's not dozens , it 's in thousands now . 
  and i 'm not even talking about the fact that half ( or more ) of isis equipment comes from the us ( in the form of assets you gave them in iraq ) . 
   moderate, 
  oh look there 's that word again . 
  keep telling yourself that . 
  a blind parroting of your country 's officials pr . 
  we only arm `` moderate rebels '' . 
  lol indeed . 
  the lengths some of you will go to justify your government 's dirty bussiness is shocking . 
  and disgusting . 
   * un troops, 
   * keep peace, 
  pick one . 
   feminist-leaning , left-wing social justice movement, 
  and the article was apparently written by a woman . 
  ... . yep . 
  these are the times we live in . 
  i 'm just waiting for her to start crying `` harassment ! '', 
  after she gets a few mean messages over this . 
  and who knows , maybe with that credit , she can join the likes of quinn and speak to the un at the next meeting . 
   not part of the un , staff hired and paid for, 
  excuse my bluntness , but who the hell cares ? 
  these things are internal details that do not matter in the slightest . 
  if it did n't use the un name , then it would matter . 
  every single news article about this uses the un name . 
  and they 're correct . 
  so what are we discussing here ? 
  damn , that was pretty damn good !, 
   because we are not spain, 
  most ( all ? ), 
  developed countries have publicly funded health care systems . 
  except murrica . 
   a 2009 harvard study published in the american journal of public health found more than ** 44,800 excess deaths annually ** in the united states because of americans ' lacking health insurance , equivalent to one excess death every 12 min . 
  more broadly , the total number of people in the united states , whether insured or uninsured , who die because of lack of medical care was estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year . 
  those 45 thousand deaths are on you , the people who vote for politicians that support this shit . 
   saudi has an eadge with its fighter jets ( plane to plane ), 
  syria will take them a few years , and by then , they 'll have t-50s . 
  fuck anyone who 's defending this hearsay shit . 
  journalistic ehics , journalistic ehics , journalistic ehics ... and when somebody on `` our '' side fucks up , it 's suddenly a malleable concept . 
  hypocrites . 
  i know the people want to like derek and lizzy , because they 're aligned the `` right '' way , but let me say this :, 
  * derek smart is an idiot who wants to make good games , but ca n't due to his own lack of talent . 
  all his games sucked big time and he 's a jealous son of a bitch . 
  * lizzy is the same wannabe `` journalist '' like half of the people this sub regularly shits on . 
  there you go , i said it . 
  that 's absolutely hilarious . 
  this is pretty much the quality of what starting out mod creators are able to do ( as a couple of people and with zero budget ) . 
  and that 's being disrespectful to the modders . 
  does derek smart have no shame ? 
  well , to be fair , su-27s are quite old now . 
  but afaik israel only has f-16s , so they 'd ( most likely ) be evenly matched . 
  what 's funny is that both countries are supposed to get first batches of the latest 5th generation jets around 2017 ( t-50s for the russians and f-35s for the israelis ) ... so they 'll likely be evenly matched again . 
  well , of course i was not talking about a real conflict here ... the israelis are a tiny country , they 'd get owned if the us did n't back them ( which they would ... so this entire dick measuring contest is just us being silly in an internet discussion :p ) . 
   literally nothing to do with derek smart, 
   ** literally nothing **, 
  literally nothing . 
  you can still use your eye movement to communicate ( even write these days ) . 
  as for taking it yourself , it would n't be too hard to hook up a pump or an actuator of a valve to the computer ... you would be able to press the big red button and off you go . 
   take ieds , rpgs , etc, 
  depends on the kind of ieds or rpgs . 
  most of the militants the abrams tanks go against have poor anti-tank weapons . 
  but . 
  any powerful ied will kill ( or at least incapacitate ) the tank 's crew easily ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft5y9spdhvk , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-8yymmggpm ) . 
  [ rpg-29 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rpg-29 ) s and up are capable of penetrating modern western tank armor ( unless they have hardkill aps like [ trophy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trophy_ ( countermeasure \\ ) ) ) from pretty much any side other than the front . 
  people tend to forget that the russians do n't give a shit . 
  they just do n't . 
   grozny was once again the epicenter of fighting after the outbreak of the second chechen war , which further caused thousands of fatalities . 
  during the early phase of the russian siege on grozny on october 25 , 1999 , russian forces launched five ss-21 ballistic missiles at the crowded central bazaar and a maternity ward , killing more than 140 people and injuring hundreds . 
  during the massive shelling of the city that followed , most of the russian artillery were directed toward the upper floors of the buildings ; although this caused massive destruction of infrastructure , civilian casualties were much less than in the first battles . 
   the final seizure of the city was set in early february 2000 , when the russian military lured the besieged militants to a promised safe passage . 
  seeing no build-up of forces outside , the militants agreed . 
  one day prior to the planned evacuation , the russian army mined the path between the city and the village of alkhan-kala and concentrated most firepower on that point . 
  as a result , both the city mayor and military commander were killed ; a number of other prominent separatist leaders were also killed or wounded , including shamil basayev and several hundred rank-and-file militants . 
  afterwards , the russians slowly entered the empty city and on february 6 raised the russian flag in the centre . 
  many buildings and even whole areas of the city were systematically dynamited . 
  a month later , it was declared safe to allow the residents to return to their homes , although demolishing continued for some time .
