  ** in 2003 the united nations called grozny the most destroyed city on earth ** . 
  you could say the men doing the converting are ... therapists . 
  yes . 
  worked for me , thanks !, 
  still better than `` unnamed official '' ... 
  not bad . 
  but the user name does n't check out , so i have reservations . 
  the second one is also the one that broadened the alien universe to what it is known for today . 
  alien is a great movie , but all in all , it 's just a really good monster/haunted house horror film . 
  aliens brought all the pulse rifles , and smart guns and military angle , space marines , the queen etc. 
  so even if you prefer the style of alien over aliens , you have to admit that aliens should get a lot of credit for fleshing out the alien universe as a whole . 
   lets pretend it 's new, 
  what ? 
  it 's not new by any metric , and did n't say it 's new . 
   it has been going on since journalism has existed, 
  yeah , but that does n't make it ok in any way . 
  and it 's definitely not good journalism ... what happened to having two independent/vetted sources ? 
  all i can see with this `` unnamed official said '' bullshit is that one ( or a select few who have the same `` source '' ) publication writes it first and then everyone just copypastes that shit from there . 
  as it happened in this instance . 
   why not ? 
  because the us wants to keep existing ? 
   it 's probably one of their most important allies in the region . 
  that means nothing when your homeland is at stake . 
  unlike turkey ( for example ) , saudi arabia is not a member of nato . 
  the u.s. is not obliged to help them . 
  i mean , sure , the u.s. would make a fuss about it , supported and armed saudi arabia in all the ways it could and it would most likely mean the second cold war ... but if you think the u.s. would defend ( as in use its own military ) saudi arabia , you 're crazy . 
  ha ha !, 
  sa-24s can eat f-15s for breakfast , not sure about the eurofighters though ( or at least i think the saudis only have f-15s and eurofighters ) ... in any case , i say let 's do this , russia :p, 
  f1-f3 keys currently, 
  yeah , i can imagine there will be a few dick pics xd, 
   rubberbanding vehicles on retail on 120hz servers , it probably happens in the current cte build as well . 
  and then, 
   it 's a few months ago now, 
  i can feel your pain dice ... having to waste time replying to something that you then learn ** may ** have happened ** months ago ** . 
  if i was in charge of this sub , you 'd be banned for this straight away . 
  you go into a thread that specifically asks for fall patch cte test feedback and you start blabbering about retail and when the devs tell you again , you have the audacity to reply with the `` i do n't get paid to betatest your software '' bullshit . 
  amazing , simply amazing . 
   fapulous, 
  why so quiet ? 
  ### derek smart is a fucking idiot . 
   yes , the us made assad shoot at protestors in 2011 . 
  i love how these rumors always come up in any assad-related debate as if that grants the us government a mandate to go and try to overthrow a democratically elected leadership of a sovereign state . 
  ** the us government needs to go fuck itself . 
  ** as is painfully obvious by now , the only thing the us government understands is power , otherwise they 'll have no issue with `` helping '' you to `` align '' yourself the right way . 
  i 'm czech and i never liked the russians . 
  most of us do n't like the russians , as they invaded us in 68 , which stopped the liberalisation and strengthened the communist party that ruled for the next 20 years ( and that fucked us royally ) . 
  but during the last 5 or so years , i see myself rooting for the russians more and more since they appear to be the only country which has the balls and the capability to do its own thing and tell the us to fuck off . 
   the us can do what it wants because we have something called capability, 
  yes , that is exactly the thing i 'm talking about . 
  thanks for supporting my point . 
  your government does n't do what is * right * , it does what it * wants * . 
   lol is kim jung un, 
  ... / thread, 
  like north korea gets bombed , right ... 
  any half decent iranian ballistic missile can easily reach both turkey and israel . 
  so there 's the `` could not touch '' the allies . 
  as for `` no one would back them '' ... they were actively trying to develop nuclear weapons for like a decade or more and the us tried to bankrupt them , sabotage their efforts etc. , but not bomb them . 
  i do n't see how it would be any different now . 
  i do n't know , the missile they tested ( [ emad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emad_ ( missile \\ ) ) ) seems to be perfectly capable of delivering a nuke . 
  1,750 kg payload is more than enough . 
   obama actually does have a death panel, 
  well , that 's why he won the nobel prize ... he went the extra distance and has a panel of experts instead of deciding it himself !, 
  i now nothing about this , but maybe treatment outside of the us can be cheaper ? 
  there are some world class proton centers in europe , for example the one in the czech republic ( [ proton therapy center , prague ] ( http://www.proton-cancer-treatment.com ) ) . 
  t1gge 's battlelog avatar is pretty dank !, 
  i 'll just leave this here . 
  i guess that you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks . 
  but to be honest , i was suprised that tb 's post even appeared on * r / games * ( which was apparently a brief `` misunderstanding '' of their mod team , i.e. 
  mods being overruled by senior mods ) . 
  * r / games * is a lost cause . 
  edit : apparently it was not / u/piemonkey ( or at least he says so ) , everything said above still stands though :p, 
  exactly . 
  while most people ( including me ) would obviously jump on such an offer , robbaz has a huge channel ( 1 173 850 subs ) , reputation of which * could * be impacted by some random sponsored unboxing video , especially since he 's never done them before . 
  just record audio . 
  it 's super easy and much harder to be discovered by the parties being recorded . 
  plus you can easily record hours at a time . 
  it will be a part of the holiday patch . 
  a wild demize has appeared !, 
  ( are you still mad because of the people 's reaction to some of the bf4 design choices ? 
  ps : i 'm expecting to receive a response about `` how female soldiers really look like '' . 
  do n't let me down , man !, 
  the only problem i have with this is that they ( effectively ) pushed it further in their new game , since your typical match in wows is much longer than in wot . 
  your grinding for xp or money is more severe in wows than in wot . 
  which is understandable , they 're a for-profit company , but kind of jarring in the light of new f2p games going a much more `` gentle '' way in terms of ( unpaid for ) progression . 
  armored warfare and wildstar come to mind . 
  we 'll see if it hurts wargaming in the long run . 
  well , i 'm just quoting :p, 
  of course . 
  it 's about gas expansion , the only way to avoid it would be to not have any of it inside you . 
  edit : i was wrong , thanks for correcting me !, 
  you learn something every day :p, 
  does it happen only in wows ? 
  if not , it may be caused by the temps ( of the cpu or the gpu - google the reviews of your hw , they usually contain some temperature measurements ) . 
  thermal throttling is by far the most common cause of a sudden drop of performance of computer systems . 
  but ... it can also be software related . 
  i had a huge problem with visual studio 2015 installation that ran hyper-v on the background constantly ( just by itself ) and as a result the performance in most games was terrible . 
  a similar situation can happen if your system is infected by a virus containing a bitcoin miner . 
  * check temps, 
  * check recently installed software that may have affected performance ( developer tools , drivers etc. ), 
  * run a system-wide virus check,
