  ps : you will ** never ** get to 10fps in wows with your kind of hardware . 
  it does n't matter if you have two titans enabled or `` just '' one . 
  also , your internet connection has ** nothing ** to do with the framerate of the game . 
   you fap you lose, 
  and i thought dark souls was hard ... 
  i do n't care , the fuckers [ kill dolphins ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbk32v4qdte ) too . 
  fuck them . 
  [ non-existing japan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aging_of_japan ) will be a wonderful thing for this planet . 
  i also like how you speak about `` the ignorant '' while japan is one of the most ass backwards countries in terms of old traditions and conservative culture ( or change-resistant culture or whatever you want to call it ) . 
  fuck that . 
  i like [ hollywood movies ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd5mqjvhw9c ) . 
  it would , if it was ilovejapankawaii . 
   do n't work like that, 
  work like what ? 
  on average , a family needs to have at least 2 children for the population to stay the same . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
   the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime has been fewer than two since the late 1970s ( the average number was estimated at 1.5 in 1993 ), 
   the japanese health ministry estimates the nation 's total population will fall by 25 % from 127.8 million in 2005 , to 95.2 million by 2050 . 
   it 's all about will power here . 
  you 're not climbing the k2 or trying to drop a heroin addiction ... jesus , this sub is pathetic . 
  - so what did you achieve in your life , timmy ? 
  + i did n't masturbate for two weeks . 
  please . 
  nah , i do n't like obese women . 
  anti-oxidants are good for preventing cancer , but once you have it , there 's some evidence that they have contra productive effects . 
  just sayin ' . 
  btw the latest study on this topic was published in nature , not some random journal . 
  youtube does n't use flash ( anymore ) ... 
   i think the bigger problem is that people genuinely expect the government , and all its subordinates , to continually make sound moral judgements . 
  which is really weird . 
  i mean ... 
  * individual humans are often selfish and some have very little sense of morality, 
  * positions of power are reachable more easily if you * do n't * have a strong sense of morality and empathy ; being ruthless and manipulative ( and a sycophant when the situation asks for it ) is an effective approach, 
  * at the higher levels of the government , `` morality '' of individual people is rarely changing much as everything becomes a matter of national security , a given policy or simply the state 's interests ( i.e. 
  `` greater good '' ), 
  i would think these points are well known and kind of a conventional wisdom . 
  it suprises me that there are so many people willing to submit to the their goverment or just look away . 
  the goverment 's number one interest is usually the sustainability of the country . 
  however , it 's naive to think that the goverment `` serves the common folk '' . 
  it usually does n't . 
  and the more money you pour into politics and elections and lobbying , the less it is about the common folk and the more it is about corporate interests . 
   that said , the mobile game market is a complete mess , and it 's nobody 's fault but the lazy , shitty devs who turned it into a race to the bottom . 
  steam is pretty much the same now . 
  valve opened the floodgates , but most of the new stuff that now gets on steam is shovelware ( or just pure garbage thrown together with malicious intent ) . 
  let 's face it : the number of truly great games that did n't get on steam back when it was curated by valve could be counted on the fingers of two hands . 
  a small price to pay to have a functioning , browsable store . 
   depleted uranium ... we are filling the ground with radioactive waste, 
  you realize that the earth itself is full of `` radioactive waste '' ? 
  health hazards associated with uranium are pretty much the same as those for lead . 
  not to mention depleted uranium . 
  btw depleted uranium has nothing to do with `` the '' nuclear waste the nuclear power plants are producing ( spent nuclear fuel , i.e. 
  fuel rods ) . 
   natural uranium metal contains about 0.71 % u-235 , 99.28 % u-238 , and about 0.0054 % u-234 . 
  in order to produce enriched uranium , the process of isotope separation removes a substantial portion of the u-235 for use in nuclear power , weapons , or other uses . 
  the remainder , depleted uranium , contains only 0.2 % to 0.4 % u-235 . 
  because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of u-235 , enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium . 
  for example , producing 1 kg of 5 % enriched uranium requires 11.8 kg of natural uranium , and leaves about 10.8 kg of depleted uranium having only 0.3 % u-235 . 
  i 'd be much more concerned about the naturally occurring radon if i were you . 
   radon exposure ( mostly radon progeny ) has been linked to lung cancer in numerous case-control studies performed in the united states , europe and china . 
  there are approximately 21,000 deaths per year in the us due to radon-induced lung cancers . 
  radon has been considered the second leading cause of lung cancer and leading environmental cause of cancer mortality by the united states environmental protection agency . 
  screw you :p , stop oppressing me , this is ** rape ** !, 
  ( somebody repost this pls ) . 
   not something that anyone wants to undergo or promote, 
  you would think so ... look up abortion activists / feminists, 
  can i join too ? 
  carbon nano lube is still ok though , right ? 
   why would this exist, 
  ask god . 
  you can choose to ignore reality and do not watch uncensored footage of it , but that does n't make it go away . 
  i , for one , i 'm grateful for subs like r/watchpeopledie ... it puts your life into perspective . 
  also , it often shows you things you would never know otherwise - how murderers behave , what is the real effect of knives and small arms fire on our bodies etc. 
  it shows how fragile and frail human life is . 
  so that 's why it exists . 
  also , morbid curiosity . 
  u/piemonkey ( since some people seem to be confused :p ), 
  pfffffft , you japs have nothing on our battleship technology . 
  north carolina is the shit . 
  i went down the jap bb line in closed beta and i do n't know if it was only me , but amagi felt underwhelming coming from the nagato . 
  i swear the amagi was more squishy than the nagato ( and stats say that amagi 's citadel armor is 76-254 mm , but nagato 's citadel armor is 76-305 mm ) . 
  the fact that you get into tier 9/10 matches easily with amagi does n't help . 
  also , the amagi is a more clunky ship than nagato ( 870m vs 770m turning circle , 15.6 s vs 12.1 s rudder shift ) . 
  especially since nagato is ideal for ranked matches . 
   i have dominated the sheep . 
  should we also not link to / u/piemonkey ... ? 
  yeah , i get it . 
  i 'm just trying to link to him ( / u/piemonkey ) once more :d, 
   this thread is a cesspool, 
  you forgot the usual spiel about stormfront brigading / r/worldnews yadda yadda yadda . . 
  mad skills . 
  it 's nice to see someone who knows what they 're doing after all the levelcaps and matimios :p . the fact that you can do all that with a controller blows my mind . 
  if the last few years have taught us anything , it 's that we should not underestimate the influence [ illiberal progressives ] ( http://youtube.com/watch?v=zh0mpfr-k2u ) have on the politics of western and nordic countries . 
  they abuse the goodwill of people who do n't know any better and often get away with it . 
   tunguska was a less powerful explosion than krakatoa , which hit an estimated 180db . 
  yeah , ** 100 miles from the source ** !, 
  it was ~ 310db close to it . 
   heck , for all intents and purposes 190db is impossible, 
  yeah , no . 
  190db is not impossible by any means . 
  we 're not talking about undistorted sound here , which has a limit that happens to be ~ 194 db for a sound in earth 's atmosphere ( [ examples ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sound_pressure#examples_of_sound_pressure ) ) .
