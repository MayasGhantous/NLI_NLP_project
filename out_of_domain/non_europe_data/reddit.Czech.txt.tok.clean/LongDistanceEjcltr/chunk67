  the free speech laws become extremely fragile as soon as you begin to introduce exceptions . 
  there may be a few examples where they managed to keep it within reason to just holocaust denial ( some eu countries ) , but even then we can see tendencies to include communism crime denial introduced in some countries etc. 
  it 's totally a slippery slope and while i can understand the need for the suppression of the nazi ideology in a country that was behind the holocaust , that 's where it should end . 
  ** no ideology or religion should be untouchable or bannable . 
  ** ( while we can debate the true extent of the holocaust , there is no question that it actually happened and that nazism was the primary driver behind it ... so the need for suppression of nazism is based on factual historical evidence of acts , not just ideas . ), 
   the physics is the terms of our license . 
   you do kinda need the indirect bake . 
  if you do n't have it , stuff in shadow is more or less completely black . 
  i understand that , but what i meant was that you ca n't use the pre-bake for any dynamic scene elements anyway and you can keep the original lighting data for the map . 
  so while this would be an issue for any kind of map manipulation , it would be possible to mod all the other things . 
  game logic , new items , vehicles , weapons , modes ... 
  i mean , it 's not ideal , but it 's infinitely better than nothing at all . 
  not any more than anywhere else in the eu , especially the east part . 
  you can say the same thing about slovakia ... or hungary ... or romania ... or whatever .

   there is a ** good chance ** that the girl you are having sex with is actually the victim of sexual and human trafficking . 
  nonsense . 
  yes , there is a chance ... but it 's not good by any metric . 
  and it 's fucking delicious ( and expensive ) . 
  average whines per hour :d, 
  if you 're autistic , maybe . 
  short answer : yes . 
  long answer :, 
   do citadels get easier as you go up in tier for higher muzzle velocity and flatter trajectory ? 
  it 's highly dependent on the type of gun you 're using , your distance to the target , target 's hull angle and where exactly on the target are your shots landing . 
  citadel hits are ** not ** random . 
  if you know where a given ship 's citadel is and you have more penetration than the citadel armor thickness ( which is relative based on the angle btw , so effective armor thickness is much , much higher at a 45 degree angle than at 90 degree angle ) , you can get a citadel hit . 
  btw you can get citadel hits even with he ( on poorly armored aircraft carriers , for example ) and ap can over-penetrate weak targets ( mostly destroyers ) while causing little damage . 
   i 'm having trouble hitting anything , much less citadels , down at t3 . 
  most of tier 3 ships have shitty guns ( mostly peashooters good for spamming he ) while some of the ships have very good armor ( e.g. 
  st. louis has an armor belt that is very hard to penetrate for a tier 3 ship ) . 
  edit : previous sentence does n't apply to battleships , if that was n't clear . 
  i disagree . 
  the feeling you get in a south carolina is that of weakness and disability . 
  the feeling you get in say new mexico or north carolina is of power and ability . 
  nc guns are lasers compared to early bbs . 
   low tier dispersion ( ugh , south carolina ) plus still learning how to really lead is killing me . 
  early bbs ( and south carolina especially ) , are not really capable of pushing like the higher tier ones are . 
  always stay behind at least one of your teammates and only fire at targets that are ~ 9km away and present a broadside to you . 
  if you aim center mass , citadel hits are usually easy to get ( also , try to avoid direct confrontations with st. louis type of cruisers if you can , they 're hard to penetrate and easily can fuck you up with he rain ) . 
  i recommend to fire all guns at once , since in lower tier bbs you 're not that far ( judging the lead becomes easy rather quickly ) and you will want to squeeze in all your bets into the available citadel window ( which is usually quite short ) . 
   should i still stick to he while in t3 ? 
  * in destroyers : yes . 
  * in cruisers : depends on the target . 
  shoot he at destroyers and battleships . 
  ap at other cruisers ( but , again , it depends on the type of cruiser and if you can not penetrate its armor , use he instead ) . 
  * in battleships : never use he unless you 're shooting at a destroyer or an aircraft carrier ( and even then , it 's good to switch to ap after you set his flight deck on fire ) . 
   but from your comment it sounds like that only applies after the guns improve a little, 
  nah , you always want to fire ap in battleships as the vast majority of your damage is designed to come from ap projectile penetration ( and , less frequent , but much juicier citadel penetration ) . 
  a combination of both . 
  eeeh ... it was just a joke , lighten up . 
   does n't feel like a joke now, 
  yes , it does . 
  i have no reason to shit myself because someone called me autistic . 
  the only people who take offence to this are autists and social justice warriors ( which does n't mean that you ca n't have a perfectly rational reaction like `` man , that joke sucked '' , but such rational people will just downvote and wo n't write crap like `` that was uncalled for '' ) . 
  i 'd kill for a `` no neogaf '' filter button at this point ... 
  who the fuck came up with the concept of a '' ** gameplay spoiler ** '' ? 
  you , dear sir , are an idiot . 
   do n't like it ? 
  yes , i do n't like it . 
   do n't read it . 
  sadly i have to , because it 's all over this damn sub . 
   also , do n't be a cunt . 
  i do n't care . 
  frankly , i 'm suprised no one has banned me yet , because the genius that came up with it is most likely a mod . 
  last year , when i looked for a proper gaming mouse & gaming mouse pad , i specifically set out to buy the best , and since with mice it 's about 3 things : sensor quality , firmware quality and ergonomics and not about marketing bullshit numbers like dpi ( meaning it 's not easy to buy one on the basic specs alone ) , i looked at what the professional counter-strike and dota players use . 
  i saw several [ rivals ] ( https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-300 ) across teams and games , so i decided to buy that . 
  plus a huge steel series [ mouse pad ] ( https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-heavy ) . 
  one year later and i still could n't be happier with my purchase . 
  the video you posted ... is it only me or is that super easy to tell ? 
  you 'd practically have to be an idiot to confuse these two kinds of sounds . 
  you might be confusing communism and atheism , bro . 
  also , atheism has nothing to with any violence whatsoever , since it simply describes an absence of belief . 
  true atheists are not and should be not againsts any religion . 
  if they are , they 're not atheists but anti-theists . 
  veganism is a good comparison . 
  the vast majority of vegans and vegetarians do not actively try to shame and persecute the rest of the population , they just choose not to eat meat themselves . 
  anyways , the main problem with all these `` but other religions are also saying this and that '' arguments is that when we look at the hard numbers and statistics and especially in the last 20 -30 years , islam is * by far * the most frequently used justification for killing people ( as far as religion-based crimes go ) . 
   we would have a democratic and functioning country in syria right now, 
  you are fucking insane . 
  all your posts sound like gibberish spewed by an ideologue . 
  i 'm not . 
  you can always get the fuck out , if you 're so ashamed . 
  schengen makes it easy for you . 
   czech republic is notoriously homophobic too, 
  `` notorious '' among people , such as ... / u/visforv and ... \\* crickets \\*, 
   unreadable, 
   every other sentence is also hitchens is the greatest thinker ever and he said this, 
  i do n't understand what 's the deal with you . 
  are you unable to grasp the trivial concept of illegal vs lawful immigration ? 
   your president would be proud !, 
  * first of all , what does it have to do with anything he said ? 
  `` i 'm ashamed of my country '' - if you truly mean that , the natural course of action is `` move to a different country '' . 
  we have estabilished legal ways of migration and especially within the eu , the free movement of workforce is one of the essential benefits the eu provides . 
  btw , in my experience , `` i 'm ashamed of my country '' is something an edgy teen student would say . 
  you are ashamed of your country because one guy said something or some group of people met somewhere and were protesting ? 
  please ... grow the fuck up . 
  * second , i did n't vote for him , could n't care less about what he would or would not be ( although i 'm sure it would be under [ becherovka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/becherovka ) [ influence ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uehkohzg50m ) :p ) . 
  joe 's reaction to `` jazz hands '' was hilarious . 
  i see the `` movie '' non real time export setting in cryengine is alive and well ...
