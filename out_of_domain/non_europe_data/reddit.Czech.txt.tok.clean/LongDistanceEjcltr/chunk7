  they are n't . 
  even something as basic ( i mean basic as in `` essential '' ) as photoshop is not available on linux . 
  and do n't even bring up gimp , because i 'll laugh . 
   established workflows and popular software and wo n't change anytime soon, 
  thanks , you said it better . 
  3gl is useless , which is fairly obvious to anyone who unlocked it, 
  * lvg is 20 times as effective, 
  swedish people !, 
  i find it ... interesting ... that there was just some very mild critique of the netcode on his channel for like 2 + months after the release ( second half of [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvngthqldtq ) was probably the first full on critique ) , but now it 's apparently plain old `` crappy '' and `` in shit state '' and , on top of that , the game was `` in a horrible state at launch '' . 
  i 'm pretty sure ea does n't give a shit ( anymore ) . 
  most of dice employees are either working on other projects or are just finishing up their last work on bf4 . 
  i can see one or two bigger patches coming out , but bf4 's eol is coming in fast . 
  get with the program , bf4 is not designed with hc mode in mind . 
  i do n't need tons of examples , i 'm sure you can indentify most of them yourself , but one for all - silencers ... nuff said .

  thanks for this !, 
  attack chopper staying steady is a perfect material for my sraw ... :p, 
  show me this level of detail in titanfall ... 
  hi there !, 
  just a minor note : upcoming rank battlepacks progress bars are all full ( yellow ones under the `` xxx , xxx points left '' ) . 
  that progress bar 's div ( . progress-bar-inner ) width is set to something way over 100 % :p, 
   the gentle lovers started as a fifa club on the xbox 360, 
  lol, 
   i love how someone who has n't ever touched the code of the game tries to contradict the developer about what their engine can or ca n't do . 
  what a stupid comment . 
  what you 're saying is that all critique is invalid if it does n't come from within the community of other game/movie/music creators . 
  i do n't know what 's the deal with you , but you do n't need to be a game developer to critique games . 
  get a grip with reality . 
   fucking idiot youtuber . 
  you told him . 
  lol . . 
  dear sir , you do n't know much ( or you do n't know much * in this case * ) . 
  it has nothing to do with the lack of bandwidth and everything to do with console manufacturer 's rules and lower server requirements ( meaning more server instances can run on a single physical server ) .

  the most sad thing is that he 'll just get his stats reset . 
  this is the number one problem . 
  because , you know , cheaters are paying customers too ... 
  ... but you ca n't get that guaranteed get out of jail free card !, 
  that 's how unregulated capitalism works . 
  there is one big problem with this game . 
  it 's $ 60 . 
  i 'm sorry , but i 'm not buying a sp-only , 15 hour game for that amount . 
  the only fps games i 'm willing to buy for full price are either open world games ( far cry 3 ) or games with strong mp component ( i paid $ 120 for bf4 + premium , but i also clocked in almost 300 hours ) . 
  length is a very valid argument , whatever fanboys of a given game decide to say about it . 
  some games ( level-based platformers , figting games etc. ), 
  can have great `` length '' even with limited content because they have incredible replay value . 
  call of duty clones ( themepark fps rides may be a more appropriate description ) are over as soon as you 're done with the campaign . 
  i would never pay $ 60 for two cod campains glued together into one 15 hour interactive movie . 
  dota 2 , for example , has one fucking map , but it 's a game you can have fun with for hundreds of hours ( some would even say that the most fun you 'll have is after several hundred hours ) ... it 's about longevity . 
  if i like game x , and i paid y dollars for it , i wa n't to enjoy it for z hours . 
  y and z are , to me and most people who actually buy games regularly , closely tied together . 
  btw : spewing random bullshit like `` game development costs money '' is no arument at all . 
  but that 's just like ... your gameplay type preference , bro . 
  i 'm not complaining there 's no multiplayer . 
  that 's not what this is about . 
  what i 'm saying is that if you sell your game for $ 60 you either :, 
  * have to offer me at least 20 hours of sp gameplay ( not counting cutscenes ) or, 
  * have a strong mp component ( that will provide me with entertaining ways of spending the rest of those 20 hours ), 
  95 % metacritic confirmed . 
  udk would probably be best for that . 
  also it 's free until you hit $ 50k in revenue ( after which you pay epic a 20 % fee , i think ) , unity costs $ 1500 ( or $ 75/mo ) . 
  what 's new/interesting - the tl ; dr version :, 
  * physically-based shading, 
  * physically-based global illumination solution that builds on geomerics enlighten, 
  * first-ever in-editor real-time lightmap previews based on imagination 's powervr ray tracing technology, 
  * completely overhauled sound system , new audio mixing system, 
  * new gui system, 
  * one-click webgl deployment ( take your content to any browser that supports webgl without requiring a plugin ), 
  * speedtree support, 
  * level streaming, 
  * physx 3.3 integrated, 
  i 'm willing to bet that the lack of splash damage is another bug . 
  btw 34 % to 30 % dmg ... 
  exactly this . 
  i mean , they buff it to 3-shot kill ( and fuck up in the process , making it able to do double shots ) and then , a few weeks later , they nerf it to shit again . 
  3-shot to 4-shot is a huge nerf , think about it , you now need the same amount of rockets as you do with the sraw ( which is an infinitely more versatile launcher ) !, 
  3-shot kill makes a lot of sense for this kind lock-on weapon ( that ca n't lock on to aerial vehicles ) . 
  you have to be exposed for the whole flight time of the rocket and keep the lock !, 
  the driver has all the lock-on warnings , he can pop ap , he can try to break the lock or shoot you in the face ( which is not that hard since you need to be in the line of sight ) . 
  compare this to sraw , which you can fire and guide in whatever way you please for the next 10 seconds ( as long as it does n't hit anything ) . 
  these are so basic balance things , it 's quite puzzling to me how dice does n't ( want to ) see them . 
  but then again , many of them operate only in the us , but the consumerist poll is available to anyone in the world . 
  the free version of unity is not full featured !, 
  udk has everying ue3 has ( including all the middleware stuff like scaleform 4 , bink video , speedtree etc. ), 
  - the only thing you do n't get is the engine source code access ( which you do n't get in unity pro either ) . 
   if your game does take off , 50k is n't very much and you might find yourself cursing those royalties to epic, 
  sure , that 's the dilemma . 
  there 's no question , however , that udk is a much more powerful engine for artists than unity is . 
  ue4 even [ more so ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfzcp4xspmo ) . 
  and let 's be honest , most people coming into the game development have 3d artist background and/or want to be `` making the game '' ( i.e. 
  thinking about mechanics , implementing them in engine = scripting , testing them etc. 
  ) , which is not really that programming heavy . 
  and afaik you can buy a full source code access license from epic if your game does get big . 
  premature optimization has nothing to do with bad design . 
  ds fanboys need to realize that stripping out detail from art assets and scaling down lighting at the end of the development is not normal . 
  you mgs fanboys need to fuck off . 
  communism is a popular political view though , even today . 
  you ca n't just `` ban it '' , if you want to call your society a democratic one .
