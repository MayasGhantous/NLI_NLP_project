  um ... somebody tell me that it 's not what i think it is . 
  well , i 'm open to suggestions ... 
  i do n't know if what i think it means is really what it means . 
  does the +50 % to the range of assured acquisition mean that you can spot destroyers from 11.5 km instead of 7km ( for example ) ? 
  edit : ah , ok . 
  thanks for the responses , it now makes sense . 
   neckbeards scramble, 
   this not being * real * art, 
  student of an art school spotted !, 
  ps : tf2 sucks :p, 
   i had to have some ulterior motive , he decided it 'd be a good idea to go through my post history and attack me for something unrelated . 
  not at all ... your wording strongly implied you may be a sjw . 
  before accusing you , i opened your user page , scrolled a bit and saw all tf2 subs ... got bored in like 10 seconds and closed the page . 
  popped a nice tf2 jab at the end . 
  no , but seriously , who the fuck plays an 8 year old game and talks about it all the time ? 
  you have to be a weirdo at that point . 
  just kidding . . xd btw you might want to get into the new unreal tournament early , if twitch-based arena shooters are your thing . 
  *** almost died ***, 
  do n't forget that there are a few games that wont let you select the maximum texture resolution with a 4gb card . 
  ( i think shadow of mordor , for example , needs 6gb . ), 
  also , the consoles operate with a ~ 7gb shared memory pool and games that can pack in the game logic into a gig or two can easily eat ~ 5gigs of vram . 
  i can only imagine that this is going to get more common as the `` new '' consoles start to get more games pushing them to the limit . 
  sjw confirmed , case closed . 
  / next, 
  huh , i thought they increased it ? 
  i 'm searching now and ca n't find it ( just the info about unlocked 7th core on both consoles ) , so i guess you 're right . 
  still , even 4gigs of vram are pushing it - even of you do n't run higher res than 1080p , you still have things like higher af and better aa or maybe even higher quality effects in general ( commonly seen with hq bokeh dof for example ) . 
  and now i hate myself for not liking games without action gameplay . 
  if only soma had guns ... ( yeah , i know , it would be ruined ... but i grew up on silent hill and first few resident evils and miss those ) . 
   asm ? 
  ideally with that 500 kt warhead . 
  for balance . 
  everyone wants to take over the moderator positions . 
  corporations , political groups , you name it ... 
  afaik the admins had to nuke the entire / r/starwarsbattlefront mod team , since they were abusing their power to benefit the ea in exchange for ( small ? ), 
  gifts . 
  and that 's just a small example i happened to notice . 
  how many subs had to be nuked like this ? 
  and how many are doing it , but there 's no proof ? 
  even worse , how many subreddits are going through an ideological shift ( that is not corresponding with the wishes of the majority of the subscribers ) ? 
  mod power hijacking is a real thing and reddit 's biggest problem . 
  there should be an annual voting period ( e.g. 
  every january ) on reddit where the long time subscribers would have the power to vote out mods . 
  at least in the bigger subreddits . 
   keep bf4 up to date, 
  it 's not just `` keep up to date '' , they completely rebalanced it and basically had to dismantle the whole thing and rewrite or upgrade some engine subsystems , especially the netcode . 
  and they were doing that for well over a year . 
  a huge job that has paid off . 
  not to mention that their work has been incorporated into the frostbite mainline . 
  battlefront 's netcode ( and probably of all future frostbite titles ) is based their work . 
  most of these whipped creams in a can are oil-based . 
  you have to specifically look for a dairy-based one if you want the real ( ish ) thing . 
  edit : i see the brand used in the picture is this http://www.reddiwip.com/products , so yeah , dairy-based . 
  not good for a cat . 
   taking over camera movement for animations is absolutely out of the question for vr, 
  that 's 100 % true . 
  you can have exactly zero camera animation in vr . 
  i 'm sure it 's not a problem to code in a few hooks that will disable camera animations in vr mode , but what is the actual problem with that is that everyone will now want to use that mode because it has a competitive advantage ( and not a small one ) . 
  not really , isis & co are just as ruthless and cruel , but unlike the drug cartels , their primary motivation is not money . 
  legalize most drugs and drug cartels will stop being an issue in a decade . 
  religious extremists ? 
  not so easy . 
  ( i say `` easy '' because even though the political situation right now wo n't allow for legalized drugs , it 's only a matter of time before the nixon cancer dies out and then we can have a reasonable discussion without all the fearmongering and prejudice . ), 
  two hard problems . 
  * if you increase consistency , you have to decrease damage - this would require a total rebalance of the battleship gameplay, 
  * if you make aiming more important than it is now , aim assist mods ( which are being used already ) will become an issue ( rather than a mere nuisance they 're now ), 
   pyramid scheme, 
  you need to learn what that means , bro . 
  for it to be a pyramid scheme , one of the basic requirements would be that this is an investment opportunity . 
  it 's not and it was never advertised as such . 
  it 's effectively the same as someone spending a lot of money on candy crush gold . 
  not to mention that having ( very ) high tiers of backers for kickstarter-like projects is very common . 
  people , please , do n't upvote nonsense like this just because you do n't like what cig is doing ( which is fine ) . 
   scam , yes, 
  proof please . 
  all i see is your word on one side and alpha 2.1 release on the other . 
   believe, 
   they think, 
   ** grey market **, 
  that does n't matter at all . 
  at all . 
  is cs : go a pyramid scheme because you can buy keys and crates and open them in hopes that you 'll get a rare knife you can then sell for hundreds of dollars ? 
  what you 're trying to say makes zero sense . 
   monthly subscription plans, 
  from their site :, 
   subscription revenues contribute to the star citizen project 's development by funding around the verse ( thursdays at 9am pst ! ), 
  and jump point , the monthly digital magazine of star citizen . 
  the revenues also fund the development and release of subscriber-exclusive perks and merchandise !, 
  \\ ^ that is what has been clearly stated from day one , as can be confirmed by anyone who watched wingman hangar shows . 
  old shit . 
   there 's schemes to get them to `` enlist their friends '', 
  are you 12 ? 
  affiliate marketing is a widely used online tool . 
  many ( most ? ), 
  mmos have referral links which offer ingame bonuses ( or even free memberships ) to the owner of the referral link . 
  well , that 's the second nuke going off today ... 
  ocululz fanboys need to stop playing dumb ... `` define successful '' . . really ? 
  oculus is supposed to be a game platform , not a mere peripheral . 
  you need content developers to support it , but they will not support it unless it has a decent install base ( decent install base is counted in millions , at the very least , at the very start ) and this is a chicken/egg problem console manufacturers usually get around by pumping out sponsored/first party titles and selling the console with a loss . 
  $ 600 means that the whole talk about reaching mainstream goes out of the window .
