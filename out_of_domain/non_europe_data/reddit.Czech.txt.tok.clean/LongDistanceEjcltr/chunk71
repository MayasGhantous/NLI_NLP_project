  if you think that content creators ( i 'm talking mainly about game developers here , but this also applies to other experiences that need to be tailor made for the platform ) will mess with a tiny install base , you are crazy . 
  report it to the admins . 
  this is why the old mod team was nuked at r / starwarsbattlefront ( they were taking gifts from ea ) . 
   nail her already . 
  she is abusing the system and overall a shitty person . 
  i know nothing about the u.s. law , but what i heard on [ this podcast ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocvjelzbba0 ) makes me think that if you have enough money ( = really good lawyers ) , the u.s. law is quite malleable ... 
  i can only imagine how much bullshit can you do in a civil case . 
  sometimes you can be a shitty person , abuse the system and still get away with it . 
   the fact that this can actually happen is why lawyers make so much money and why it is so hard to fight legal battles without a massive cash pool to hire teams of lawyers . 
  [ i knew that something like this is going to happen . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/406vir/happenings_update_on_erons_case_notice_sent/cysb25f ) there are always loopholes you can abuse if you have enough money ... and it 's all perfectly legal , no dirty deals or bribes required . 
   this has got to be getting close to the point the court can have her for deliberately trying to waste time . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  [ quite literally ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixjgy2vsct0 ) . 
  no it does n't . 
  gpu physx is not an open standard , if you think that one company will use another company 's proprietary technology without some form of a deal , you 're retarded , plain and simple . 
  thank god for ue4 . 
  pc gamers do n't realize it just yet , but that engine will move the platform towards more open development tools and generally be an awesome thing . 
  there are currently hundreds , maybe thousands of video games being developed on ue4 , so once the floodgates open , ue4 titles will be omnipresent . 
  and that 's a good thing ... 
  ue4 contains no bullshit , pretty much all lighting and effects are either in-house solutions or free & open source . 
  ue4 has a custom gpu particle system that produces amazing results , is deeply integrated into the engine and runs on anything . 
  unless the developer goes in with an intention of integrating gameworks himself ( maybe for marketing or because of a contract ) , there 's no reason to do it as pretty much everything is already in ue4 and often in a far higher quality . 
   cross-licensing agreements in place, 
  jesus , are you for real right now ? 
  physx has nothing to do with x86 or x86-64 , those are agreed upon * standards * and they * do not change * just because intel/amd wants to . 
  i 'll quote something from the article you posted :, 
   nvidia `` owns '' and controls the future of cuda , so it 's not open in the `` open source '' definition , but it 's certainly free . 
  now tell me dear friend , who 's the naive one here ? 
  nvidia can do whatever it wants and you think that a competitive company will go ahead and use nvidia 's proprietary work `` because it 's free '' ? 
  lol . 
  your argument boils down to : `` amd did n't buy into cuda when they had a chance . 
  idiots . '', 
  yeah , ok , whatever you say . 
  let 's build an nvidia shrine together , cover ourselves with green slime and have furious sex under that shrine ... because that makes about the same amount of sense . 
  28,916 battles ? 
   they would jump ship, 
  i 'm okay with that . 
  they should get their shit together already !, 
  i mean , how hard can it be ? 
  it 's not rocket sci ... oh . 
  i think that what he means is that you can only improve so much by `` fixing '' failures on the `` final product '' . 
  how many of these `` tests '' can spacex do ( i write `` tests '' in quotes because they 're not really tests since the rockets have actual missions & valuable cargo like satellites and scientific equipment ) ? 
  i do n't know rocket science , but i do know computer science , and nobody calls beta testing or rc testing `` qa '' . 
  qa is so much more than a `` few '' fixes before the release . 
  qa is ( or at least should be ) a long process stretched over the most of the life of the project , it can produce hundreds or even thousands of reports ( bug/required improvement / ... ) and the bigger the product team , the more this is true . 
  often times , people will critize a software company for `` not having qa '' or `` how qa missed this '' , while the reality is that the qa teams pointed out the issue and the development team just did n't get to it ( usually because of the lack of time or other priorities ) . 
  tl ; dr : i do n't think you can `` qa '' shit on the basis of a few instances of broken components . 
  ah , the good old `` cultural differences '' excuse . 
  it 's okay to say that some cultures are objectively inferior to other cultures , at least as far as human rights and animal rights go . 
  pc thinking is the cancer of the left . 
  i do n't need to look up shit . 
  you need to look up what human rights entail . 
  if you 're throwing men from roofs for being gay or stoning women for being raped , you are a twat from an ass backwards culture . 
  objectively . 
  if you massacre dolphins by cutting them up alive and sticking hooks into their blow holes , you are a twat from an ass backwards culture . 
  objectively . 
   your point of view, 
  read up , kid, 
   did n't know you were elected the bastion of morality in the planet we all should follow, 
  ad hominem bruv , you can do better, 
  this is one of the reasons to love america for ( invading my private property ? 
  no problem ), 
  i was n't being sarcastic : x, 
  / all is not front page !, 
  who cares if you look on your front page ? 
  * the image in the op is about the front page , not r\\/all . 
  * the front page is what visitors without accounts or with accounts and default subreddit list see when opening reddit , not r\\/all . 
  the whole point here is that the front page is moderated . 
  it has absolutely nothing to do with r\\/all and quite frankly i do n't understand who gave the first post in this sub thread so many upvotes , are you fucking new to reddit ? 
   it takes you to your front page of only things you are subbed to . 
  yes , but that works only for people with accounts . 
  not to mention that if you have an account , but do n't mess with your subs , you have a list of defaults and that is the same as the anonymous visitors have . 
  most of the visitors of this site are like this !, 
  either no account or just being registered so you can upvote/downvote . 
  yes , i edited my post from a low effort `` read my post again '' to the one you currently see . 
  does n't change the fact that my points are just as valid as they were . 
  btw you 're also free to edit your posts , you do n't have to `` edit : '' ... 
  i was skeptic ... darn , you are right o_o, 
  the upvote argument is nonsense . 
  it 's not censorship , it 's democracy . 
  if you try to sell ( post ) a crappy product ( a message ) , is it censorship that no one buys it ( upvotes ) ? 
  now we can debate the issue of unpopular opinions , and that 's certainly a valid problem with any democratic system , but that 's the price of being free . 
  what would ( and does ) make it censorship is if there was an entity that can prevent you from selling your product ( a message ) on the market ( a subreddit ) even though you did not violate any of the official rules . 
  that is the real problem ( and the only problem ) - people who think that social media or discussion platforms have to be curated ( on top of following the rules ) and that 's it 's their political or moral duty to do so . 
  i 've said it before and i 'll say it again : the next big step for free speech on the internet will be open platforms ( open in the sense of a public mod log ) that allow for the control & ruling structures to be elected and have a formal process for arbitrating the disputes . 
  mods can be elected and represent ( a part of ) a community , they can also be demoted if the community agrees . 
  disputes between the users and the platform must be openly accessible and the community must have a say in them . 
   the entire point of doing so is to give context to people who read the post and replies after the fact . 
  which has like zero relevancy if i edit my post a minute or two ( or less ) after i wrote it . 
  i edited my post before i 've seen your post , your argument is invalid . 
  i do n't understand how you get to tier 8 and you still do this stupid shit . 
  i mean , if it was tirpitz , then ok , you bought a tier 8 ship for money and you have no experience , that is pretty common ... but if i did this in my nc , i 'd rage quit and not login for a week out of the sheer amount of shame i 'd feel . 
  even if there was no smoke , it would be incredibly stupid to stop there , since you * know * there is a dd somewhere and possibly quite close , since there 's nothing left in your team that could spot him . 
  edit : the guy 's name ends with mvp . 
  lmao , this is too good to be true . 
  this whole concept of a `` grind '' in a game like warframe is ridiculous . 
  is call of duty a grind ? 
  is battlefield 4 a grind ? 
  is world of tanks or world of warships a grind ?
