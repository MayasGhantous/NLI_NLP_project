  i do n't know , rebuilding car engines ... or cats . 
  a mod can even remove a post simply because he has a bad mood . 
  what i was talking about was stricly compensation/bribery of mods . 
   as for kosovo , i found some estimates of the costs here which say that the bombing campaign cost # 2.63 bn , of which # 1.6 bn was borne by america : 61 % rather than 99 % . 
  of course that 's pretty significant that one country bore the majority of the military cost , although if you compare usa to eu spending , which may be a better comparison , it 's less striking . 
  you know what , i find it really weird when people talk about `` bombing campaign cost '' as if it 's some kind of sacrifice . 
  it 's not like the us buys the bombs from other countries , most of their weapons are produced on their soil by us based companies . 
  the cost may have been # 2.63 bn , but how much of that went back to the economy of the us ? 
  all modern conflicts instigated by the us were profitable for the us in the end ( generously so , if we 'll count rebuilding and increased geopolical influence ) , that 's something we always need to remember . 
  as for the legitimacy of the kosovo war ... 
  i 'll just leave this here :, 
  i 'd rather know than not know . 
  too many people pre-order too many games for too long . 
  the price of mystery is ... being uninformed , buying games based on their name or tv ads and by extension perpetuating the publishing culture of incomplete games and rushed releases . 
  it sucks . 
  my view :, 
  * valve ( the same happens with csgo ), 
  * prize pool size ( higher stakes = more interest ), 
  * dota 2 is accepted more by non-players ( but still gamers , e.g. 
  r/games audience ) than lol is . 
  everyone has watched the international at some point . 
  while lol is immensely popular , it has little reach outside of its space ( and korea ) . 
  yes , thanks , you explained it better . 
  ue4 [ uses physx ] ( https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/int/engine/physics/index.html ) as its physics library used for some core engine functions ( e.g. 
  collisions ) , because it 's a damn good ( cpu ) physics library . 
  they have their own renderer , effects library , particle system , so no need to integrate gimpworks ... the best way to do things . 
   hey made a custom ue4 renderer for it so it does n't suck on pcs like epic 's own, 
  complete nonsense . 
  ue4 renderer is miles above anything else available on pc . 
  both in terms of performance and features . 
  the fact that ue4 's ease of development makes it possible for amateurs to make games and some of those amateurs make terrible performance considerations ( or rather inconsiderations ) does n't mean the renderer `` sucks '' . 
  besides , saying `` they made their own renderer '' in the first place is also nonsense , they certainly did n't , they 've added some functionality and improved some parts of ue4 . 
  [ lpvs and csm improvements ] ( http://www.lionhead.com/blog/2014/april/17/dynamic-global-illumination-in-fable-legends/ ) . 
  it 's just their take on lpvs and it has many problems and limitations , the community 's consensus seems to be that it 's underdeveloped . 
  look at `` other notes '' [ here ] ( https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/int/engine/rendering/lightingandshadows/lightpropagationvolumes/index.html ) . 
  except large is n't as descriptive as fat or obese . 
  fat , people . 
  the word you 're looking for is ** fat ** . 
   in the last 70 years american influence has been largest , but it pales in comparison, 
  nonsense . 
  and just your opinion . 
   through all types of ** printed and electronic media ** , as well as ** the emergence of the united states as a global superpower ** , english ** has become ** the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and in professional contexts such as science , navigation , and law . 
  jabbas downvoted us :p, 
  the problem is not that you answer to the shareholders ... 
  the problem is not that your shareholders need to see profits ... 
  the problem is that publicly traded companies experience very high pressure to keep producing higher and higher profits each year . 
  it does n't matter that you made $ 24m profit this year because you made $ 29m profit last year . 
  sure , you made over $ 50m in to two years ... but in the eyes of the market , your yoy performance dropped by more than 17 % . 
  everyone sees this , shareholders are susceptible to panic ( and being influenced by the media etc. ), 
  and you can imagine the kind of outlook you have to try to keep to appease the market . 
  a profitable private company that makes changes to their products based purely on the goal of addressing a bigger audience is driven by greed . 
  a profitable publicly traded company that makes changes to their products based purely on the goal of addressing a bigger audience is driven by the need of surviving in the market . 
  it 's why i believe the number one reason why we get so many copypasted ubisoft titles each year ( with close to zero innovation , as innovation = risk ) and why so many ea titles seem to be more and more `` dumbed down '' ( battlefront is just the latest example ) is that they are publicly traded companies . 
  it has nothing to do with elitism , inclusivity or any of that political nonsense , it 's purely because of the need to seek bigger audiences . 
  also , it goes hand in hand that if you invest into an original ip as a publicly traded company , you will always want the sequels to reach bigger audiences ( this is not neccessarily true about private companies , not to the same degree of tailoring the game just to reach a bigger audience ) . 
  there are a few exceptions , but those are possible primarily because of other factors . 
  cdpr for example ( which is publicly traded , but relatively small and traded on a small makret in poland ) , but even that company may `` fall '' to the standard practices of a publicly traded company as the witcher 3 still had space to expand to [ other than making the game more approachable ] , e.g. 
  being released on the consoles and having a decent marketing ( none of which were the case when the witcher 2 came out ) . 
   in a year, 
   it 's still in somewhat early stages, 
  after 3 years and 4 months . 
  early stages after 3 years and 4 months . 
  `` there 's nothing worthwhile to show yet '' after 3 years and 4 months . 
  \\ ^ if the op ca n't see where the skeptics are coming from , i do n't know how to explain it more clearly . 
  / u/pitchforkemporium will buy it from you . 
  what a misogynist . 
  you know that quote about there never being a reason big enough to hit a woman . 
  i respectfully disagree . 
  lol , tough guy zoo staffer ... like other people pointed out , the incident was `` not serious at all '' only because there was no death roll, 
  yeah , `` it had to '' ... lol ; i 'm willing to bet it 's something as mundane as his nick name . 
  buuut , what can you expect when half of the reddid admins are either sjws or feminists . 
  got ta silence those uncomfortable opinions ... oh sorry , i mean `` harassment '' . 
  my bad . 
  modern feminism a.k.a. 
  3rd wave feminism . 
  the one not about equality , but the likes of the patriarchy and a ton of marxist ideas . 
  do n't play dumb . 
  there we go . 
  the patriarchy . 
  did n't take long ... 
   nuanced views on content policy, 
  then tell me why quarantining exists . 
  i guess we 'll never know ... since an open admin mod log is not a feature here . 
  not that i expect such feature ... it kinda goes against all the shadow banning . 
  what is the name of that minimap mod ? 
  those ea bastards !, 
  ... just kidding , it was a [ great ride ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lvxcw6s.png ) for me , especially since a small , but great group of players formed around it . 
  dice la 's work on bf4 was exemplary . 
  hopefully they 'll score big time and get their own ip now . 
  edit : since people are calling me out what a scrublord i am ... that 's just the cte . 
  origin says that i have [ 801 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aqdgoba.png ) hours in the game overall . 
  is that enough ? 
   rat out, 
  that seems absurd to me . 
  why would anyone protect someone like this ? 
  it 's not a fucking gang protecting its members ... it 's a poorly paid job and the people you work with are most likely just temporary co-workers , nothing more . 
  if i worked in that company i 'd `` rat out '' everyone who even looked at me weirdly once , complained once or did something weird once . 
  lol , report all the things !, 
   partially working crack, 
  so you call sharing a steam account `` cracking '' .
