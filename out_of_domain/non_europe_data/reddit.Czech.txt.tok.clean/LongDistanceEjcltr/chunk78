  lol . 
  longer than that , still nothing for fifa 16 . 
  that rumor is still going around ? 
  it 's nonsense . 
  the scene had plenty of time ( 6 months since the first v3 denuvo game - fifa16 ) to develop whatever debuggers and tools they need . 
  denuvo v3 ( and patched v2 ) has not been cracked because it 's fucking hard to crack , not because people are missing dev tools . 
  it does n't exist and judging by denuvo 's record , it will probably not exist for months . 
  which is funny , because the publisher spends all the cash on this protection and then still fucks up the game in a way that it needs to be always online . 
  people have zero problems with denuvo . 
  always online ? 
  not so much . 
  and it 's not and mmo , it does n't need to be always online at all ... yet , they still do it . 
  super weird . 
  well , i guess square enix bought denuvo after the game 's design and server logistics were set in stone . 
   the leeches really shot themselves in the foot when all this went down . 
  if you check some of their community and torrent comments , people are being downright brutal . 
  just walls of text basically saying the same shit `` omgz hurry the fuck up , get up off your asses and crack it alrradddddy '', 
  the scene does n't give a shit about torrents . 
  it never did . 
  for them , all torrent users are leeches , regardless of their seeding/leeching torrent habits . 
   i would n't blame em one bit for giving everyone the finger and retiring from it all . 
  some crackers crack software protection for the challenge . 
  some for political reasons . 
  some for being respected by their peers . 
  nobody does it for some random pirate bay downloader 's internet points . 
  most of the scene has either a negative or indifferent view on the pirating public . 
  the thing is ... technically , it does n't even matter , as any protesting is a crime when happening on places currently under secret service protection . 
   as journalist dahlia lithwick and first amendment lawyer raymond vasvari observed in 2012 , when the federal law on trespass was quietly amended by h.r. 
  347 -- it is a crime , punishable by up to a year in prison , to `` knowingly ... impede or disrupt the orderly conduct of government business or official functions '' in locations guarded by the secret service , including places where individuals under secret service protection are temporarily located -- the revised statute made it `` easier for the government to criminalize protest . '', 
  that 's the price you pay for having `` a photoshop for games '' . 
  the flip side is that much more people ( ideas ) get access to state of the art technology and some of those people ( who would otherwise not engage in game development because of the high barrier to entry ) may create gems that will innovate . 
  a lot of people do n't seem to realize that the most added value of ue4 does n't lie in its rendering engine , but it 's tools . 
  anyone who used the cascade particle editor ( for example ) will know what i 'm talking about . 
  and at the end of the day , it 's up to the customers to demand better performing games , even from indie studios . 
  ue4 itself is awesome . 
  he does not jest . 
  if the culture popular with women is anything to go by ( talking mainly about 50 shades and similar novels ) , women want a romantic stalker who can be an abuser bordering on rapist as long as he 's great looking and financially secure ( the rape is not rape cuz she enjoyed the sex forced on her . . yeah , that 's in 50 shades ) . 
  obviously these are fantasies , but given the popularity of these novels ... you ca n't just dismiss everything . 
  the tendency is there . 
   i think a lot of people do n't understand how cancer actually works and that there is n't a single cure for it . 
  from what i understand , cancerous cells are incredibly easy to kill when outside of the body ... the problem is killing them inside the body while not harming the healthy cells . 
  to me , as a layman , it always seemed like we ( the humanity ) are pretty good at killing cancer cells themselves , we just do n't have a delivery method effective enough . 
  maybe i 'm looking at this from a way too much engineering-based view ( as engineering is my background ) , but i see nano-medicine as quite different than the traditional one . 
  the nano scale medicine must be based on robust models of how a cell looks like and behaves ( pretty much by definition ) , at which point the activities in this field must look more like a nano-engineering r&d projects than medicine r&d projects . 
  i 'm sure most people are aware of the chemistry/physics split , i.e. 
  once you get to a scale small enough , you stop dealing with what would most people call chemistry and start dealing with particle physics and quantum mechanics - that is what i mean here . 
  this approach of dealing with robust models makes it much more widely usable than when we treat a complex system of cells as a whole ( `` a disease '' ) . 
  i get why professionals insist on using the terminology ( that cancer is a group of diseases , not one disease ) , but at the end of the day , it 's all about unregulated cell growth . 
  from what i 've seen in the article ( and many other sources over the last few years ) , it 's still the same issue of a generally applicable and efficient delivery . 
  not an issue of coming up with a novel way of delivery for every single type of cancer . 
  so , to get back to the `` no single cure '' argument - i think nano medicine changes the game a bit . 
  it also helps if you have a for-profit prison system ... ya know , market demand an all that . 
  15 in czech republic , slovakia , poland , slovenia , sweden , denmark , france , greece ... 14 in germany , austria , portugal , italy , hungary ( some have a few exceptions and some increase the age of consent if one of the participants has some kind of influence on the other , e.g. 
  teacher , adoptive parent ) . 
  yeah , the simplest being heat ... 
  i get it hehe , my bad , what i meant was more akin to `` without regard to the surrounding healthy tissue '' than literally `` outside of the body '' . 
   i think 14 is definitely too low , and i think 15 is questionable , 16 seems like the perfect cutoff to me . 
  the thing is , this should n't be a matter of opinion , but biology . 
  the opinion of many people in some countries ( \\* cough \\* middle east \\* cough \\* africa ) would be that it should be ( much ) lower . 
  you can see where this can lead ; 14 may be pushing it , but 15 ( at least for women ) is perfectly reasonable if you 're looking at the issue objectively . 
   on average , girls begin puberty around ages 10 -- 11 ; boys around ages 11 -- 12 . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] girls usually complete puberty around ages 15 -- 17 , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] while boys usually complete puberty around ages 16 -- 17 . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 5 ] the major landmark of puberty for females is menarche , the onset of menstruation , which occurs on average between ages 12 -- 13 ; [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] for males , it is the first ejaculation , which occurs on average at age 13 . 
  [ 10 ] in the 21st century , the average age at which children , especially girls , reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century , when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys . 
  [ 11 ] this can be due to any number of factors , including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth , increased weight and fat deposition , [ 12 ] or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens , which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors .

  `` average maturity '' does n't mean anything . 
  i 'm 30 and i tend to play video games in my free time instead of , i do n't know , golfing . 
  am i mature ? 
  who decides who is and who is n't mature ? 
  intelligence and `` social intelligence '' , your upbringing , etc. . . all this makes you mature sooner ... or later . 
  you can hopefully see how an `` average maturity '' is not a reasonable concept . 
  one more thing of note : we must realize that we 're talking about criminalization here . 
  not that if having sex with a 15 year old is moral or not , but if we 're gon na lock someone up in a cage and ( in some countries ) potentially put them on a public list of sex offenders and ruin their lives pretty much forever . 
  * queef snaps, 
  just wait for radar ... which will help to lower the numbers of gunboat dds and buff the numbers of long range torp wall dds . 
  it 's going to get worse before it gets better . 
  does anyone know why i still see a rather low number of carriers in top tier games ? 
  is it just momentum or am i missing something ? 
  i mean , in the games i see them in , they tend to dominate ... the torpedo speed changes were pretty drastic and if they play smart and manage to largely avoid cruiser aa , torp attack runs can be more devastating than ever ( with the new torp speed bonus a bb will basically eat something every time , even if they did everything right ) . 
  i play the game since closed beta so i 've seen plenty of 2v2 carrier matches - that flat out does not happen any more . 
  i ca n't even remember the last time i 've seen a 2v2 carrier match ... but it used to be normal . 
  also , when the game launched , a game without a carrier was a rarity . 
  but hese days ? 
  probably 1/3 to 1/2 of my battles are without any cvs . 
   someone should record, 
  source : http://warships.today/vehicles/eu . 
  seriously , what kind of loser uses linux . 
  man , tom hardy has really let himself go . 
  [ the installed game has over 150k individual files ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofwarships/comments/44a3nw/wg_youre_insane_do_the_game_assets_really_need_to/ ) ( yes , i mean 150,000 ) . 
  its loader loads individual files instead of cooked blobs of packed data ( like any other reasonable game does ) . 
  that 's why it 's so slow for people without ssds . 
   it does n't need to load all of them though, 
  [ ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b0fehny.png ) , damn i always thought it 's loading 20gigs of data every time !, 
  yeah , sorry , been a lil harsh . 
  anyways , the problem is not the overall size of the file set that needs to be loaded , but the amount of individual files in the set . 
  even reading just 1500 files ( just 1 % of the game 's overall amount of files ) is a solid workout for a mechanical drive . 
  typical modern ssd is capable of 10000 iops ( at the very least ) . 
  typical modern hdd is capable of 100 iops ( at the most ) . 
  the problem with sf is that it 's huge in the tech and internet sectors .
