  for example , in czech republic ( where i live ) , the communist party ( [ ks\u010cm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_bohemia_and_moravia ) ) has ~ 15 % of the votes , which is fucking sad if you ask me , but that 's how democracy works . 
  fgsdf g hggh fhghfhg try yrty try rgh fh, 
  or you can play [ a far better game ] ( https://www.pathofexile.com ) for free . 
  as much as i dislike their politics , this is why i still consider rps trustworthy . 
  you do n't see many video game journalists just say `` i did n't like it because ... '' before the release . 
  it 's all rainbows and butterflies until the release and then , when shit hits the fan , you 're another step closer to being looked at like a paid off douchebag while dragging down the whole `` game journalist '' thing with you . 
  sooooo , let 's guess the new or reintroduced bugs !, 
   they had it from a puppy , never trained it , never neutered it etc. 
  the proper redneck way , lol . 
   vagine, 
  they still do , just not the nvidia ones :p, 
  well , let 's say somebody wants a top-notch oculus rift experience :, 
  * modern engines need a lot of horsepower ( think ue4/cryengine with all the bells and whistles ), 
  * low persistence ideally needs 80fps + ( this is a direct quote from oculus guys ), 
  * two eyes ( two cameras . . ), 
  * 2k + display ( consumer product will be 1080p + ), 
  it adds up . 
  i can see people with lots of money buying this card . 
  not with mantle :p, 
  one of mantle features includes direct gpu memory access , so it is capable of using memory from both cards ( combining the memory pool , as you stated , is currently not possible in sli/xfire ) . 
  as for links , i do n't have any ( too lazy , maybe i 'll update this post later ) , but it 's one of the topics @repi ( johan andersson ) from dice talked about at apu13 ( or at least i think it was apu13 ) . 
  dirt . 
  yeah . 
  i think we all know what he means by `` dirt '' . 
  hint : shit . 
   i think there 's a difference between photoshopping a screenshot than a screenshot of an earlier build that had to reduce the lighting effects for performance . 
  there is zero difference . 
  none . 
  they could have fucking painted the `` screenshots '' with a paintbrush and it would be the same . 
   there are 32 players in-game , i 'm sure a few can use a rocket and guide it into the ac-130, 
  problem is :, 
  ac-130 's attack got buffed but its health is the same ( man , i hope that they fixed its invulnerability against jet cannons ) . 
  it takes 3 sraws to take it down and if you decide to do it you 'll be a sitting duck for an eternity ( my estimate is that , all going well , it takes one engineer about a minute to take it down ) . 
  now all this is ok as long as the ac-130 has a reasonable respawn delay ... which it does not . 
  take one down and there 's a new one up in no time . 
  hooligans need to be dealt with swiftly . 
  i 'm for using tanks . 
  yeah : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypube90fsfe i 'd run those fuckers over twice . 
  '' [ big assumption ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/21u9rv/people_being_run_over_in_magaluf_i_was_there_when/cggpqfi ) '', 
  i feel your pain :(, 
  their fps game example ( you can download as a ue project ) if fairly close to ut . 
  there are two maps , bots , kill scores , menus . 
  it 's still just an example and it 's nowhere near production-quality , but the bare bones that are there are actually fun to play for a while . 
  i can totally see some quake or unreal fans making a free/open source project that could actually be great looking and great feeling . 
  rhibs tend to be faster moving and less visible than attack boats , so i prefer to target those . 
  also , if you have unlocked the hydra rockets , you can kill an attack boat in one strafing run ( 30mm until it overheats and finish with rockets ) . 
  flying . 
  that 's not staff shell , but [ ergm ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extended_range_guided_munition ) . 
  damn , it 's 2 years already ? 
  they sure are taking their sweet time with the thing :d, 
  you never liked their shitty versions . 
  high quality object-based motion blur and bokeh depth of field are integral parts of any modern engine , especially now when the new consoles are out . 
  by turning those effects off you 're robbing yourself of a significant part of graphics fidelity . 
  just look at the [ infiltrator demo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr2ohpsj0m8 ) , it uses both effects very effectively and looks - by far - the closest to a pathtraced offline render ( you 'd see in your favorite pixar movie ) of all the real-time renders i 've ever seen . 
  high quality dof and blur together with pbr make it look a lot less `` gamey '' than any other tech demo does . 
  you can still take out modern mbt with modern tandem charge weapon ( like [ rpg-27 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rpg-27 ) ) . 
  what about fixing the live score boards first ? 
  so true . 
  this is why you should n't let mathematicians and theoreticians write complex code ( if they also do n't happen to be a good programmer that understands code clarity is as valuable as its effectiveness ) . 
  i mean that code is a * fucking mess * !, 
  and more here : https://www.peereboom.us/assl/assl/html/openssl.html, 
  cool tech demo . 
  but if you think microsoft will just donate so much cpu power to you in any shape or form ( especially when looking at their [ azure rates ] ( http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cloud-services/ ) ) , you 're in for a nasty surprise . 
  this will remain just a technology concept and pr tool . 
  it was n't already ? 
  ok . * adds another torrent *, 
  great work !, 
  before bf : police is released :p, 
  meh , way too much american veteran charities on the internet these days . 
  what happened to american government taking care of its soldiers ? 
  that looks almost as good as crysis did , 6 years ago . 
  ( well , maybe except dof . ), 
  too soon , gungriever is still grieving, 
  lol, 
  thera1der is a genius :d, 
  holy crap , you 're right xd ( i did n't even know there was r/bestiality on reddit ... ewww ), 
  i mean 6 months after the release ? 
  you 'll most likely not get any , it 's too late for that now . 
  ea and by extension dice do not give a damn any more ( as it makes bussiness sense to them ) ... it 's time to start promoting battlefield police . 
  and that push will most likely kick off at e3 ( june ) , where we will hear all the fairy tales about perfect netcode rewritten from scratch , engine upgrades etc. 
  those little fuckers can be nasty indeed lol, 
  not sure if it can get me laid though, 
   electronic arts earlier this week let go of their contractors at the office and told full-time staffers they could either take compensation and leave or continue working in the office to support work on visceral 's rumored police-themed battlefield title , code-named havana . 
  sources say havana is due out later this year . 
  - [ source ] ( http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/1/5360976/layoffs-hit-ghost-games-uk-office-unannounced-nfs-title-mothballed ), 
   `` we spoke with management on thursday afternoon , and although they have not yet announced a version of battlefield for fy15 , they confirmed that our understanding is spot on and that if a version of battlefield were to be released in fy15 , it would be developed by a studio other than dice , '' wedbush morgan analyst pachter said . 
  according to polygon 's sources , that spin off could be a police-themed battlefield game in development at visceral games , due out this year . 
  - [ source ] ( http://mp1st.com/2014/02/01/report-laid-ea-contractors-unannounced-police-themed-battlefield-game/ ), 
  yeah , silly me , i 'm being overly optimistic again . . 
  it 's fiscal year 2015 ( fy 2014 will end on 30 september 2014 ) . 
  3 ; edit : dammit , ilurk_4ever !, 
  of course there is a limit . 
  your collision detection / physics etc. 
  will start to get more and more inaccurate the further you go from the coord system origin ( global space ) , you then have to compensate for floating-point imprecision by doing all sorts of stuff like moving all the actors instead of the camera etc. 
  edit : this is also why you ca n't make a realistic sized earth and fly around it in a realistic sized space shuttle without using some kind of trick ( e.g. 
  dynamic model scaling based on distance etc. ), 
  - you 'd need double precision for that ( afaik both unreal and cryengine work with single precision coordinate system ) . 
  btw `` level streaming '' does not increase total playable area . 
  i know that cig had to write their own support for double precision for star citizen ( you need that just to be able to have a hornet and bengal in the same gameplay area ) , so even the latest ce definitely does n't support it out of the box . 
  udk and ue4 use sp floats too .
