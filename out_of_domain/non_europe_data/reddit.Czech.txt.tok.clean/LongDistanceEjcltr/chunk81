  being stuck in a place i described above for pretty much any amount of time is a great way to get annihilated by a torp wall ... the possibility of which only increases with the amount of enemy dds . 
  with 4-5 enemy dds and you at the tip of your forces , you can be sure there 's at least one bonus side attack brewing at any given time ... which makes it stupid for you to even be the tip - hence the `` bbs stay back and snipe '' stereotype . 
  i 'd love to get in and brawl , those are my most favorite matches ( it 's the # 1 reason i play battleships the most ... to duke it out with other battleships , even though it happens rarely ) , but i simply ca n't do that with the current high tier torp meta . 
  ** i do n't want to stay back and snipe ** , but sometimes you just have to . 
   honestly it 's no better on xbox one . 
  arguably ... it actually is better on xbox because of the frame pacing . 
  i wonder if the owner 's gon na post a video when that dog drowns under that cover one day ... 
  redneck whale in her native environment . 
  they 're giving away ( effectively ) free captain xp multipliers to yamatos . 
  nothing for montanas . 
  they 're `` adding insult to injury '' because yamato is already an [ objectively better ship ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ldih0tl.png ) . 
  it 's almost a shame wows is a relatively niche title ( i.e. 
  limited exposure for his channel ) ... atsf your editing is amusing , so do n't hesitate to branch out into other games in the future ... if you feel like it :p, 
  no , it 's not . 
  that 's why i wrote * objectively * and not * subjectively * . 
  as for why it 's * objectively * better - see the stats i linked . 
  you may - * subjectively * - like montana more , but that does n't change the stats ( facts ) . 
   this entire debate has already concluded on the forums with people agreeing that a simple fix to montana 's bow armor to negate yamato 's ability citadel through the bow is what would fix things . 
  i do n't really care what debate concluded where and why . 
  what i care about in this particular case are a ) the stats and b ) the official statements . 
  these two things are about the only ones where we can talk about objectivity . 
  as for a ) , we can argue all day about why is the yamato better than montana and how we can balance things out a bit , but the simple cold facts are available . 
  we can see that based on ** hundreds of thousands of battles ** , the yamato is clearly a more successful ship in both wr % and avg . 
  damage . 
  as for b ) , during the recent dev q&a [ it has been stated ] ( http://www.himmelsdorf.com/qa-from-ru-forums-06-04-2016/ ) that any major changes to yamato v. montana are unlikely . 
  so , given a ) and b ) , we arrive at the conclusion that we could , in fact , call the op 's problem `` adding insult to injury '' . 
   it will hide my shame . 
  shame !, 
  shame !, 
   it has 12 guns to 9, 
  by that logic the atlanta is better than both of them because it has 14 guns ... \\* rolls eyes \\*, 
   heavier broadside, 
  what does that even mean ? 
  it certainly does n't have a better torpedo belt , which at tier 10 matters the most ... so ... what else is there ? 
  the way you think about this is super naive . 
  developers create models of what they think may be fair all the time ( and that model is what you seem to call `` objective '' ) , then they balance that model based on * actual feeedback * from the real world testing ... the most valuable of which is the captured metadata like heat maps , win rates , damage done , kills etc. 
  - precisely because the data has no feelings or opinions . 
  this applies to pretty much any product development , not just games or even software . 
   the average battle performance result is just as dependent on the player as it is on the ship . 
  while that 's well and good , it starts to competely lose relevancy the bigger the sample gets . 
  what i presented are the statistics based on hundreds of thousands of battles across 4 different servers . 
  there 's no better ( publicly available ) data . 
  not to mention that even if we 're talking about the absolute best of the best players , the montana caps out at around [ 100-110k ] ( http://warships.today/vehicle/4277090288/eu/montana ) avg . 
  damage ( min . 
  100 battles ) , but yamato caps out at around [ 120-130k ] ( http://warships.today/vehicle/4276041424/eu/yamato ) avg . 
  damage ( min . 
  100 battles ) . 
  in other words , to get to the top 20 of the players with most damage done , you have to average ~ 100k damage with the montana , but ~ 117k damage with the yamato . 
  this was exactly my reaction . 
  gender outreach ... like ... wtf is he even talking about . 
  are ring/octagon girls supposed to be gender outreach ? 
  or cheerleaders ? 
  what he 's saying makes no sense . 
  i 'm not gon na pretend that having ten models on stage `` for the lulz '' is some pinnacle of entertainment and that they 're not there just to be eye candy ... but i 'm also not gon na cry about it as i do n't cry about modeling in general , which is not much more than this . 
  gender outreach my ass . 
  placid and easygoing as a child and teenager , the maturing rosemary kennedy became increasingly assertive and rebellious . 
  she was also reportedly subject to violent mood swings . 
  some observers have since attributed this behavior to her inability to keep up with siblings who were expected to perform to high standards , as well as the hormonal surges associated with puberty . 
  in any case , the family had difficulty dealing with her stormy moods and reckless behavior . 
  rosemary had begun to sneak out at night from the convent school in washington , d.c. where she was cared for and educated . 
  her occasional erratic behavior frustrated her parents who expected all of their children to behave appropriately , be highly goal-oriented , and act competitively . 
  joseph p. kennedy , sr. was especially worried that his daughter 's behavior would bring shame and embarrassment upon the family and possibly damage his political career . 
  in november 1941 , when rosemary kennedy was 23 , doctors told joseph p. kennedy , sr. that a new neurosurgical procedure , lobotomy , would help calm her mood swings and stop her occasional violent outbursts . 
  he decided that his daughter should have the lobotomy performed ; however , he did not inform his wife rose of this until after the procedure was completed . 
  rosemary was strapped to the operating table . 
  after the lobotomy , it quickly became apparent that the procedure was not successful . 
  kennedy 's mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child . 
  she could not walk or speak intelligibly and was considered incontinent . 
  i 'm reminded way too often that the medicine is still in its infancy compared to most other applied sciences . 
  we , the humans , were building our first nuclear weapons and experimenting with first transistors while thinking that sticking a cutting tool into the brain and wiggling it back and forth ( randomly cutting the brain tissue ) is somehow helpful . 
  to this day we use sewing to seal our wounds and [ crude hand tools ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnbvpsu1fcc ) on our bones , like fucking cave men . 
  if the human body did n't have such an amazing ability of healing itself , we would be so fucked . 
  we have all these delicate motors , cnc machines and robots with vastly higher precision than any human , yet we let random 50 year old dudes with shaky hands cut our bodies . 
  `` jjjjus lllet me take my surgical markerr and i 'll eyballl it ! '' ... 
  jeeez , it 's not fucking modern art . 
  in the age of the computers , the internet and things like emergent ai , the surgery is not that far from butchery ... which is god damn mind boggling . 
  we may see an artificial life form being created before we get rid of surgeons . 
  how depressing is that . 
  the x-files ( season 10 , episode 3 ), 
   first of all we know where to look , fertile river deltas are where all ancient cities were . 
  fertile river deltas which are now probably under sea . 
  afaik the sea levels were about 120 meters lower 15k years ago than today . 
   second we would have records of disasters such as comets or major volcanic events from geo records . 
   seriously wtf is this ? 
  serial killer in the making ? 
  that last tirpitz managed to shoot down like one dive bomber out of 3 dive bomber squadrons and 3 torpedo bomber squadrons ( unless i missed something ) . 
  duuude ... 
  i know we 're talking about t10 squadrons here , but still ... talk about inadequate aa :d, 
  welcome to our world ( gamergaters/anti-regressives/anti-sjws ) ... btw the gender pay gap is nothing but [ feminist propaganda ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t09bx6xohsq ) peddled by the regressives ( and the likes of barack `` 77 cents for every dollar '' obama , who uses it to pander to useful idiots ) . 
   even lets you see how ships are doing compared to others on the server using warshipstats.com data . 
  warships.today is a ton better ... just sayin ' :p, 
  a wild wg employee appears ... let 's ask the hard questions : when will you bring the old aa effects back ? 
  ewwwww ... how can people play with something so fugly . 
  might as well use a fullscreen spider web overlay , dress in spandex and pretend you 're spider-man . 
  haha !, 
  good one :p ( could n't be arsed with editing the images , i presume that any user of windows can deduce that it means files and folders . ), 
  yeah , does n't matter much though , i 'm posting it because they managed to reduce all the unpacked files ( ~ 200k ) by more than an order of magnitude ... 200k to 5k ... this should be pretty damn great for users without ssds . 
  in pt the ships are now sinking for like a minute ... it 's pretty glorious :p, 
   just a reminder that the original came out 8 years ago . 
  that 's probably why very few people seem to care about it ( judging by the [ lack of ] response to these `` first xy minutes '' gameplay videos i 'm seeing online ) .
