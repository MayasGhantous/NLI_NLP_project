  illuminati confirmed . 
  edit : the deleted post linked [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qpwvzp8.jpg ) . 
  haha , i turned the music off and listened to podcasts and my own music during my playthrough . 
  [ suck it , nerds !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzilnor6zwq ), 
  yeah . 
  aside from being an absurd theme for the battlefield brand and what people expect from it ? 
  maybe the fact that primal is the worst selling ubisoft far cry game . 
  compared to the previous games in the series , it was a flop , both financially and critically . 
   mods ai n't happy with them appearing all the time on / r/all . 
  admins , not mods . 
  the mods of the_donald were forced to ban `` send this to the front page '' type of posts ( and maybe a couple of other things , ca n't remeber now ) . 
  of course when asked about the heavy brigading coming from srs and its affiliates , the admins came up with the classic `` we 'll look into it '' non-answer . 
  the reality is that the admins of reddit can and are using their political leaning ( which is , as we 've seen during the pao rule , deeply embedded into the company itself ) to skew and manipulate the politically loaded discussion on the site and there 's no reason to believe that they 'll be going after subs like srs . 
  btw has anyone noticed how a ton of big subs started implementing `` no politics '' rules in the last year or so ? 
  it 's almost as if the narrative has started to break up and the political lealings of the majority of the voting users has moved too much away from blindly eating the regressive narrative , that the discussion had to be shut down . 
  it was all nice and great when r/videos was filled with oliver 's hbo show , but as more and more posts along the lines of showing blm or sjw way of `` protesting '' got traction , it was time to hit the brakes . 
  is it only me or is it really fucking sad that the two biggest social media platforms on earth - twitter and facebook - actively engage in content & reach filtering and political censorship ? 
  at least facebook appears to do it [ for money ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya1q4vjbaeq ) and [ for the governments ] ( http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/05/facebook-censorship-and-the-war-on-free-speech/ ) ... twitter just '' [ does it for free ] ( http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/09/twitter-unveils-new-trust-and-safety-council-featuring-feminist-frequency/ ) '' ( tm ), 
  in my opinion it 's game that is a decent mix of two themes/genres , but it 's not particularly strong in neither of them . 
  while it may be pleasing to the eye , it 's not without compromise . 
  for a competitive shooter : first , it 's too flashy , with overdone ui , maps are visually too noisy/cluttered , it has huge gun models and crazy effects ( the [ visual clarity suffers ] ( https://gfycat.com/redthirstyheterodontosaurus ) , which is a big no no in competitive shooters ) . 
  second , in a typical game there are just way too many ultimate moves being used ( not to mention that killstreak-based , overpowered abilities have no bussiness in a competitive shooter ) . 
  third , some of the heroes take it so far that they do n't require any aiming skills whatsoever even though they 're not supports ( the animu girl in a mech comes to mind ) . 
  for a squad based action game : it 's way too simplistic and `` bite sized '' to last more than a few weeks after the release . 
  it reminds me of dirty bomb , but with shorter and less interesting matches . 
  that is not great news at all .

  you 're posting this a bit late , bruh ... 
  fuck ww1 . 
   so basically its going to be wwi boys, 
  if they call it battlefield 5 and it 's a ww1 game , ea has completely lost all its marbles . 
  combined warfare my ass . 
  oh look , a sensible post among all the hurr durr ww1 idiocy . 
  i love how all these `` battlefield fans '' ( most of which do n't like the last 3 or 4 battlefield games ) suddenly came out of the woodwork and are jizzing over the mere whiff of ww1 . 
  ** who the fuck cares about a ww1 battlefield game ?!? ** . 
  is this some weird mix of `` i 'm bored of futuristic shooters '' crowd that just blindly jumps on a new bandwagon ... or what ? 
  do n't tell me ww1 setting makes for a good ( main line ) battlefield game . 
  the combined warfare of ww1 either sucked balls or did n't exist at all ( depending on which year you choose to set the game in ) . 
  ** crappy weapons . 
  crappy , slow planes . 
  no helicopters . 
  crappy , slow transport vehicles . 
  ** whoever wants this in the next battlefield game is fucking nuts . 
  alternative history lol ... the most authentic battlefield title yet !, 
  hopefully i 'll be able to ride an unicorn and beat people with a huge pink dildo . 
  the thought of battlefield becoming something along the lines of a codified verdun makes me shudder in horror . 
  none of the battlefield games played with the history to such a level as is suggested in the link . 
  ww1 and ww2 and the way they happened were instrumental in creating the state of technology we have today . 
  ww1 not happening throws a monkey wrench into things like authenticity . 
  and btw i never said realistic . 
  none of the battlefields were realistic . 
  i said authentic . 
  which was always a big part of the battlefields occuring in both the past and present times . 
  i like the bf brand , i liked the last 4 games ( unlike what seems like half of the people demanding ww1 ) and i want it to be great and succeed . 
  i do n't think the ww1 themed battlefield game will sell nearly as much as a modern , futuristic , ww2 or even a vietnam themed battlefield game . 
   crappy weapons . 
  crappy , slow planes . 
  no helicopters . 
  crappy , super slow `` tanks '' . 
  crappy , slow transport vehicles . 
  how is any of that salt . 
  it 's the truth . 
  ww1 is a terrible idea . 
  this will backfire spectacularly . 
  well , at least one can hope that it wo n't affect the viability of the battlefield brand too negatively . 
  idiots . 
   dice 's mastery, 
  lol, 
  dice stockholm is a joke . 
  helium mix optimal . 
  `` liara gives tracer a blowjob '' ... alriiiight ... wait , what ? 
  please ... the cold war ended 25 years ago , the russians are hardly the bogeyman they once were . 
  you act as if any major player , especially the u.s. , does n't use anything they can as propaganda . 
  and even if you believe that the u.s. has good intentions , i 'd like to remind you that the u.s. is the biggest warmonger with the biggest military spending in the last 50 + years ( korean war , vietnam war , gulf war , kosovo war , afghanistan war , iraq war ) ... with that kind of involvement , to * not * engage in propaganda would be both miraculous and stupid . 
   never underestimate human stupidity . 
  statistically , [ 2 % ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nhmeihy.png ) of people ( 148 million globally or 6.5 million in the u.s. ) are mildy mentally retarded ( iq 50-55 to approximately 70 ) . 
  just take a minute to grasp that number . 
  these are not the 0.2 % of the population who are so retarded that they 're not able or barely able to care for themselves , these are the people that are just smart enough to be `` normal '' members of society while displaying the incredible signs of stupidity you described . 
  2 out of 100 people you meet are * actual * dummies . 
  it 's scary . 
  this is why working in retail or services will always be fucked up , you not only have to deal with people being dicks , but also actual idiots . 
  is it too late to join isis ? 
  yes . 
  and ? 
  i 'm a karma whore . 
  wildlands before march 2017 ? 
  so that pretty much confirms a gameplay demo will be on e3 . 
  it 's going to be interesting to watch how much of the game showed in the [ amazing first reveal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdjub3kz2wi ) remained ... my bet is on not much ( as is usual for ubisoft ) . 
  if you have to watch something from syfy , the expanse is so , so much better than this cheap , b-class cringe fest . 
  [ pfffft ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hheoguxiusy ), 
   well tb 's chat is always in subscription only mode, 
  that is exactly what this is about . 
  you have tb with his 10k viewers and he 's completely insulated from that mob by having a sub only chat , a sub only chat that routinely gets rid of anyone who posts even remotely questionable things , not to mention that the tb 's way of communicating with his chat is very negative , to the point that me , a 29 year old occasional viewer who is n't even subbed to his twitch ( i go to his streams when it 's a game i 'm interested in and i catch the youtube announcement post ) , has to listen to his constant remarks like `` do n't back seat game '' and often being vocally annoyed by the shit his chat says . 
  twitch audience is a bag of craziness for sure , but the way tb handles it is asking for problems ( instead of quietly banning people and ignoring them , he 's taking these chat squabbles into the stream and sometimes even gets mad ) . 
  over time , you create a minority of people who a ) begin to hate you or b ) do n't hate you , but feel suppressed ... and these people ( many of which are kids who do n't know any better ) just wait for an opportunity like this / host . 
  an opportunity when you can talk shit to tbs friends ( since you ca n't talk shit to him ) and have tb lashing out as a result ... which is obviously pretty contra productive , because that is exactly the reason people do it . 
  to be recognized , to get a reaction . 
  i can only imagine that the people fishing for attention were bursting with excitement by the point they got to `` go fuck yourself '' .
