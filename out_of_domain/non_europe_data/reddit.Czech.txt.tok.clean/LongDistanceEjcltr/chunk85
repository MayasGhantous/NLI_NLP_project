  to me , this is just another example that tb ca n't handle public relations at all and should probably find a way to actually ignore the chat ( by either not reading it or by having an employee filtering the chat for him ) . 
  complains about nobody watching pax stuff ... 
  ... continues to post pax stuff instead of , i do n't know , doom . 
  never change tb , never change :d, 
  umm , what ? 
  why does everything have to be absolute ? 
  what i suggest ( actually , my op did n't suggest anything , but w/e ) is that it may be a good idea to do what 's hot right now ( especially since he seems to like it a lot ) and keep these pax nuggets for later . 
  it 's not like a solid aaa pc shooter releases often and it 's not like he did not complain about pax content views . 
  i did n't pull that comment out of my ass . 
  please tell me this is just you doing great and not another overpowered premium ship ... 
   imagine taking the phoenix or kuma 's hull, 
  huh , it 's that bad ? 
  btw happy cake day !, 
  found one !, 
  you realize that this is a comedy video ... 
  sure , with 95.53 % like/dislike ratio ... all those meat eating meanies !!, 
  please ... 9 out of 10 clips the video is made of are absolutely absurd , regardless of whether you 're vegan or not . 
  that 's why it 's funny . 
  i 'm not saying that evryone should like this kind of comedy , but saying `` it 's only funny to people who are condescending towards vegans '' only shows how much has the video struck a nerve with you and how uptight the vegan community is when it ca n't even make fun of itself . 
  i liked most of it . 
  disclaimer : i fucking hate any steak tartare . 
  ( am i doing this right ? ), 
  nonsense . 
  you do n't `` need '' railguns until you need them . 
  but when you 'll need them , you wo n't have them and will get caught with your pants down . 
  this is such a backward way of thinking . 
  a railgun is a gamechanger because a ) it uses extremely cheap ammunition ( compared to a cruise missile ) , so you can achieve a lot of bang for your buck when supporting your troops in areas like middle east ( very little to no resistance ) and b ) it makes most aa systems obsolete , so it would give you an edge when in conflict with a major power ( who could otherwise easily defend its airspace by using lots of its advanced aa ) . 
  a railgun-based battleship ( or floating artillery platform or whatever you 'd like to call it ) would be very useful in an army that is based around air superiority ( and therefore could defend such platform ) . 
  of course it would n't fight other `` battleships '' ( so i guess the whole battleship thing is indeed dead and it would n't be called a battleship ) , it would just be used instead of cruise missiles , short range missiles and bombers . 
  pffft ... this is brutal ? 
  crush one of those [ ballistic dummies ] ( http://ballisticsdummy.com/ballistics_dummies___as_seen_on_deadliest_warrior__.html ) . 
  that would be brutal .

  mad is the only reason why there was n't a third world war yet . 
  anything that helps with keeping this status quo a bit longer is a good thing in my book . 
  overwatch and dota have nothing in common . 
  overwatch is team fortress with a twist , not a moba . 
  any overlap is just people playing more genres ... i.e. 
  they do n't compete in any way . 
  unlikely , there 's no point in having any of that if you ca n't use it effectively . 
  it all comes down to the souls combat system ( and enemy move sets , but that 's a part of the combat system ) , which is very unique and as far as i know only one other game studio tried to imitate it ( and failed ) - ci games with lords of the fallen . 
  plus india has a modern military , 1.325 million of military personnel on active duty and a lot of nukes . 
  also , even though the last indo-pakistani war in 1971 lasted just 13 days and was one of the shortest wars ever , it stripped pakistan of more than half of its population and one-third of its army ended in captivity . 
  pakistan got owned . 
  tl ; dr : india does n't give a crap about pakistan . 
   there is n't anyone demanding for halo on pc . 
  on the other hand , there are many console kiddies ( this is just a return of the `` pcmr edgelords '' ball ) [ demanding console ports of pc mods ] ( http://i.imgur.com/slmmifn.jpg ) . 
  mods .

  talk about `` entitlement and delusions '' ... 
  it 's just the camera zoom in play , for the most part ... if you look at the bird 's view , it was much less dramatic , when the plane was anywhere near ground , it flew [ over the river ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9why4do.jpg ) ( danube ) ... pretty safe, 
  republicans bad , trump hitler . 
   edit : after a lot of death threats and other comments , i apologise, 
  ** those ** . 
  ** cunts ** . 
  somebody sent you death threats because you said `` suicidal idiot '' ? 
  fuck them and fuck that suicidal idiot . 
  yes , none of that is edited for the lulz , so to speak . 
  and there 's a lot more . 
  [ this one ] ( https://i.sli.mg/gep2ek.jpg ) is ( obviously ) edited , making fun of those headlines :p, 
  state funded school . 
  small children . 
  it 's not about options ( or money , which options translate to ) , the government should n't have to support stupid ideas . 
   when a berlin district court ruled on a case involving a 9-year-old berlin girl whose father wanted the school to offer a vegan option . 
  his daughter was vegan for `` ethical reasons , '' he said . 
  that father should be locked up in jail for forcing their child to be malnourished . 
  vegan diet is ** not ** healthy for a developing child . 
  and do n't fucking tell me that a 9 year old has chosen to be a vegan ( not that it would absolve the parent of their responsibilities ) . 
  if the state can say that they wo n't make burgers with fries as an option ( bacause it 's unhealthy and promotes obesity ) , they can say the same about veganism . 
  taxpayer money and all that jazz you know ... 
  the whole argument is little more than 3rd wave feminist propaganda . 
  i do n't see her complaining about her bigger than average breasts ( and those are the main reason why she even has a successful career in porn ) , even though they can be categorized as the same `` issue '' . 
  ** the market ** is what pressures girls to get implants , same as it pressures them to not be overweight and/or to work out and/or to focus on certain body parts/shapes ( read : big ass , small waist ) . 
  there are niches for small breasts , small asses , obese women , but as with every kind of entertainment , niche content has a small audience . 
  we can observe the same `` issue '' when older hollywood actresses complain about them not getting those `` attractive young girl '' roles they used to get in their prime ... now the evil , oppressive patriarchy wants them to play `` mothers and older women '' . 
  yeah , no shit ... except it 's not the evil , oppressive patriarchy , but a simple reality of the market . 
  and it works for both men and women . 
  people do n't want to see average people in their movies , and so we have the likes of lawrences and hemsworths . 
   weeks or months prior, 
  most likely one of the bigger crime syndicates with presence in japan got an offer regarding a batch of stolen credit card data and decided to act on it . 
  if you have the manpower , i do n't see why you would n't get this planned and done within a week ( i mean , the longer you sit on it , the higher the chance of people noticing the theft or someone not keeping their mouth shut ) . 
  it appears they specifically picked japan as it apparently has a lot of 24/7 atms ( over 10,000 7-eleven convenience stores w/atms across the country ) packed into relatively small areas . 
  germany 's reaction : https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ck-lknyusaainfb.jpg, 
  the problem is that once you cross a certain threshold , simple labels stop working . 
  the political climate of the last 10 to 15 years , both in the u.s. and in europe , is directly responsible for the popularity of guys like this one or trump . 
  the scale was tipped to the left for way too long and some of the negative aspects began to affect daily lives of regular citizens . 
  once that happens , no amout of naming and shaming will help , only time . 
  let 's hope the mess that the leftist goverments created , especially in europe , results just in a political correction and not a full blown resurgence of actual far right ideologies . 
  yes , because the copious amounts of news every day about the massive waves of illegal immigrants is not what are we reading about , it 's all about the gay marriage . 
  it 's totally not about any of these , no issues with islam , pissing on any kind of nationalism , no , it 's all about gay marriage . 
  lol . 
  the day the nuclear war stops being an option is the day we 're going to be fucked . 
  mad has served us well for 70 years . 
  lets hope for another 70 . 
  double nice . 
  but that has nothing to do with mad . 
  there will always be a slight possibility that some `` religious nutbags '' will manage to steal a warhead ( or , less hollywood-ey : assemble one from different stolen parts ) ... but that is a small price to pay .
