  a highly unlikely one . 
  besides , what could they do with it ( for it to challenge mad ) ? 
  it 's not like they 're going to `` steal '' an icbm too and launch a false flag attack or something ... 
  still blows my mind that spaceballs was considered to be a crappy movie when it came out ( at the very least by the critics ) . 
  to this day , it has just 54 % on rt and lukewarm 7.1 on imdb ... 
  who cares about wot ... 
   i did n't realize science had an `` official stance '' . 
  science does n't . 
  reddit mods do . 
  social justice and gender studies professors , students and activists do . 
  they have a huge influence over academia lately ( and by extension , science ) . 
  you 're either with them and virtue signalling wherever and whenever you can or you 're a bigot who deserves to be deplatformed and called a racist ( bigot/nazi/whatever ) . 
  there 's no discussion allowed in universities ( where else it should be allowed more ? ), 
  and you expect that reddit will be any better ? 
  `` our official stance is that transgender is not a mental illness '' - and if you do n't agree , we 're not interested in your contributions . 
  go away you bigot . 
  since you mod cowards keep deleting your posts , let me quote you :, 
   often , when transgender people are pre-transition ( before they transition into their identified gender ) , they meet criteria for gender dysphoria . 
  and often , once they 've transitioned , they do not . 
  often . 
  how much is `` often '' ? 
  nice choice of words . 
  i can also do that . 
   the review of more than 100 international medical studies of post-operative transsexuals by the university of birmingham 's aggressive research intelligence facility ( arif ) found no robust scientific evidence that gender reassignment surgery is clinically effective . 
   dr hyde said : `` the bottom line is that although it 's clear that some people do well with gender reassignment surgery , the available research does little to reassure about how many patients do badly and , if so , how badly . '', 
   a 1998 review by the research and development directorate of the nhs executive found attempted suicide rates of up to 18 % noted in some medical studies of gender reassignment . 
  there you go , mental health issues . 
  up to 18 % suicide rates * after * gender reassignment . 
  wtf ? 
  this is not wtf , this is awesome . 
  this is why my company does n't give a shit about your synced bookmarks .

   yes , yes , sjws would like that . 
  just remember , this kind of reasoning is why you 'll be complaining about trump the next 4 + years instead of a couple of months . 
   `` in english the word `` bigot '' refers to a prejudiced , closed-minded person who is intolerant or hateful toward people of a different group . '', 
  sums up anti-trump activists perfectly :d ( listen , this whole thread is getting deleted like crazy , a little shit post wo n't hurt things . . ), 
  ca n't say i did n't expect it . . at least i 've preemptively taken r/scienceplus :p, 
  hmm . 
  it seems he 's unhappy . 
  they own 40 % of epic ( which gives them right to nominate directors to the board of epic ) . 
  epic has done nothing but great things lately . 
  opened up ue4 to pretty much everyone , made unreal tournament a long term , epic developed but community driven project ( which is shaping up nicely and has a real shot at being a decent competitive shooter ) . 
  last time i checked , paragon was making great leaps forward and reacting to the community feedback , so ... tencent can be the devil himself for all i care . 
  okay , just for a minute and for the sake of the argument , let 's forget about the fact that cosby is a serial rapist and people want ( and should want ) justice to be done ... 
   did admit to drugging younger girls , some underage, 
  that is very fucking different than preying on children . 
  ( note : i did n't look into this yet , but the way you put it makes me think of young women , not kids . ), 
  the whole concept of `` jailbait '' is based on the fact that some `` younger girls '' may look like physically adult women while being `` underage '' . 
  `` underage '' is defined by the law , but it changes from country to country and in some of them it 's as low as 14 ( austria , germany , italy , portugal ... ) . 
  the most common age of consent in the eu is 15 . 
  some of the u.s. states take it to a ridiculous degree and have it set to be 18 ( and none of the u.s. states have it lower than 16 ) . 
  if some of these governments based the number on science instead of politics , it would be 15 or 16 . 
  some of these laws seem to be rooted in the 20th and 19th century , but the age at which children reach puberty went down since then :, 
   on average , girls begin puberty around ages 10 -- 11 ; boys around ages 11 -- 12 . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] girls usually complete puberty around ages 15 -- 17 , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] while boys usually complete puberty around ages 16 -- 17 . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 5 ] the major landmark of puberty for females is menarche , the onset of menstruation , which occurs on average between ages 12 -- 13 ; [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] for males , it is the first ejaculation , which occurs on average at age 13 . 
  [ 10 ] in the 21st century , the average age at which children , especially girls , reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century , when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/puberty, 
  people should stop mixing pedos with dudes who had sex with a young woman that happened to not have a fuck licence yet . 
  it certainly does n't help anyone and i would argue it actually hurts the child victims by muddying the waters . 
   i 've heard the same argument from islamists that want to marry/bang underage girls . 
  you 've heard the same argument from islamists ? 
  that 's pretty unlikely , what they want to do is to * marry * * 12 * ( and * under * ) year olds ... if you think that ( often forcibly ) marrying a 12 year old is anywhere near anything i wrote then i do n't know what to add . 
  simple minds and all that ... 
   there needs to be a line drawn somewhere . 
  and it 's not puberty . 
  that 's exactly where it is . 
  when you 've finished puberty , you 're ready to mate . 
  that 's why puberty exists . 
  the process starts when you are 11 -- 12 and you 're sexually mature at 15 -- 17 ( distributed on a bell curve , as with most population statistics ) . 
  stating otherwise has no grounds in science and is little more than stating your own world view and political leaning of what * feels * right to you . 
  it certainly should n't be grounds for someone to be locked in a cage . 
   they 're not mentally maturing earlier, 
  but who claims that ? 
  you ? 
  that 's your opinion which you 're free to have , but hardly grounds for locking other people up . 
   what age we consider a person to be mature enough to consent to sex, 
  `` mentally mature '' is a nebulous concept with zero science behind it . 
  you ca n't really put `` mental maturity '' into law . 
  some people may be never considered `` mentally mature '' , while others are incredibly responsible at 15 . 
  oh and by the way , neuroscientists largely agree that the human brain has n't fully developed until the mid-20s ( at least ! ) ... 
  are we going to move up the age of consent to 25 ? 
   according to recent findings , the human brain does not reach full maturity until at least the mid-20s . 
  the specific changes that follow young adulthood are not yet well studied , but it is known that they involve increased myelination and continued adding and pruning of neurons . 
  as a number of researchers have put it , `` the rental car companies have it right . '', 
  the brain is n't fully mature at 16 , when we are allowed to drive , or at 18 , when we are allowed to vote , or at 21 , when we are allowed to drink , but closer to 25 , when we are allowed to rent a car . 
  damn , i have to have that !, 
  it is . 
  at least that 's the reasoning behind it . 
  you 're a bigot ( according to my definition , who cares if it has any basis in reality ) , therefore you 're fair game . 
  this has begun to bleed into mainstream leftist circles and being a dick to people is now okay as long as it 's for the `` right '' cause ( blm , regressive left , sjws , 3rd wave feminists , marxists - all are guilty of this ) ... not only that , it 's encouraged ( a form of virtue signalling ) . 
  as for reddit , we can see this clearly on / r/shitredditsays , which is the only subreddit allowed to actively brigade other subreddits , orgazine witch hunts and dox people ... all because it 's aligned with the ideologies reddit admins seem to align with ( by the way , some of the reddit admins are/were mods there and post there ) . 
   i 'm just gon na follow you around to every thread for weeks . 
  this is a bannable offense ( as in banned by the admins , maybe even ip banned ) . 
  contact them , present your evidence and wait for the response . 
  if they do nothing or refuse to help you , post about it on r/kotakuinaction . 
  being banned on [ both ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction/comments/4l47tv/censorship_rscience_mods_decide_that_transgender/d3kxp4g ) is like a badge of honor for me , lol ...
