  i knew somebody was going to post that gif and for once , i find it slightly annoying . 
  other than the gif having words `` hitman , the videogame '' prominently displayed somewhere , i ca n't imagine a single more obvious gif of a video game . 
  i mean , it starts with a bald dude who has a bar code tattooed on the back of his head . 
  iconic is an understatement . 
  this is like not knowing how master chief , snake or duke nukem look like . 
  this is one of the reasons why reddit 's userbase worth is much lower than the facebook one . 
  usually , people on facebook use their real names , link with their real friends , talk about their real interests , real needs and desires etc. 
  if you have all that information as a platform , targeting an advertisement becomes a dream . 
  reddit , on the other hand , is a shit post gallery filled with throwaways , alt accounts and general reluctancy to share any personal information ( and by share i mean even with the platform itself - while you may have a locked/private account on facebook so that strangers do n't know what you 're up to , facebook knows ... and uses it ) . 
  in that sense , reddit 's userbase is closer to 4chan than facebook . 
   throwaways, 
  throwaways are most commonly used to evade friends ( who know your primary account name on reddit ) or as a clean slate account to share something more personal , embarrassing or against the law ( iama thief , ama ) ... obviously it 's useless against reddit itself , but that was not my point . 
  my point was that you can have multiple throwaways and aliases and people tend to use them because they treat reddit as an anonymous platform ( as far as other redditors go ) and behave as such . 
  this whole culture makes any attempt to target ads a mess since the discussions themselves are usually a mess . 
   vpn, 
  if you use a vpn ( even though tor with a clean browser , like tor browser , is the best ) and a clean e-mail to register with ( ideally made just for this purpose and during the same vpn/tor session ) , there 's no reason to think you 're not anonymous . 
  i mean , if the government ( and by government i mean the nsa and maybe a couple of bigger powers with significant mass surveillance programs , like the u.k. seems to have ) wanted to , they would have the means to get to you , but a company like reddit has none . 
  zero . 
   real identity, 
  well obviously if someone 's a dummy and links his real google or facebook account ... then you have only yourself to blame . 
  and what do you mean by `` partner with '' ? 
  pretty much the only thing reddit can provide a potential partner i also have an account with are the ip addresses i log in from . 
  in the age of shared ips and widespread mobile data plans ... enjoy . 
   magic pixels, 
  i hear what for the first time and quick google did n't find anything ... are you fucking with me ? 
   reddit tracks your outbound clicks . 
  half the internet tracks outbound clicks ... what does it have to do with my identity ?

  ^ and ? 
  overkill for 90 % of the games ??? 
  dude , you have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  if you want to play on maximum settings with stable 60fps , those cards ( and fury x ) are your only options . 
  and i 'm not even talking about people with 144hz monitors ( like me ) or 4k monitors . 
  i disagree , r/rule34 pleases me greatly !, 
  $ 200 is a crazy good deal for 980 level of performance . 
  people looking for an affordable , yet powerful graphics card with all the bells and whistles are finally going to be served ... something that did n't happen for several years now . 
  the baseline of fps per $ in modern games just got bumped a lot . 
  anyway , i still do n't really ( want to ) understand why do we have to wait for vega until the next year ... the entire mid to high end segment - where all the margins are - is going to go to nvidia for at least 6 months ... obviously the vega architecture is not ready yet , making gpus is not baking bread and especially with zen a few months away , r&d budget of a company with a bottom line like amd must be stretched thin ... but it still feels like a big strategic planning error to me . 
  node shrinks , especially over the last decade , are few and far between , you ca n't just sleep for half a year when a node transition occurs in the market !, 
  the 1070 will be another crushing victory for nvidia , most likely even bigger one than with the 970 . 
  well ... let 's hope zen is going to deliver what they 've been promising ( a cpu that can compete with latest intel cpus ) and it 's going to be worth it . 
  because if it is n't ... that may be it for amd . 
   970 was the biggest single selling card because it stood out in price/performance - i think it 's actual share of sales was only 4 % . 
  it has a ~ ~ 4 % ~ ~ 5 % share of all graphics cards on steam !, 
  it is the most popular discrete graphics card [ [ hwsurvey ] ( http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/ ) ] . 
  its share of the last generation gpu market was ** massive ** . 
  1070 has no competition ( yet ... if amd also releases 480x , we 'll see ... but it 's going to be really hard , the 1070 is a [ beast card ] ( http://www.pcgamer.com/geforce-gtx-1070-performance-preview/ ) ) , unless nvidia goes crazy with the price , it will be the new 970 . 
  nvidia is so much more successful than amd because they own the biggest portion of the high margin markets . 
  their high end graphics cards ( 80s and 80s titaniums ) , enthusiast graphics cards ( titans ) and computing/server cards ( tesla ) dominate their respective markets . 
  at one point , nvidia bragged in its reports that its gpu profit margins were in the 54 % range ... pretty crazy . 
  the low end and mid range cards have to compete on price per performance , lowering the price and crushing the margins in the process . 
  if nvidia makes $ 300 on a $ 600 980ti , but $ 50 on a $ 200 960 , then they have to sell 6 times as much 960s than 980s just to have the same profit . 
  and the lower you go , the lower are the margins . 
  last time i 've read something about the gpus in ps4 and xbox one , it was in the 15-20 % range . 
  20 % of a $ 100 apu is $ 20 per console ... not much . 
  if only there were more reactions like this ( a healthy `` fuck off '' to the regressives in the media ) ... a lot of people would n't have to vote for trump ( i 'm talking about the tweet , not kimmel himself or his political leaning ) . 
  pc culture is cancer and it 's one of the biggest factors in letting the regressive left get away with as much as they do . 
  that 's a new solution to the old problem ... kind of comparable to teleporting instead of flying . 
  you mean r/wincest ? 
  a one-armed man with a man-purse ( bag ? ), 
  eats a live frog in a supermarket ... a frog which he kills by holding its head with his teeth while tearing the rest of its body off ... 
  well , for once , / r/wtf being actually wtf . 
  have an upvote , dear sir . 
   `` downgrades '' are generally inevitable . 
  because stuff gets cut from the game all of the time . 
  and a lot of it is just optimizations . 
  okay , let 's hit the brakes a bit . 
  we 're not talking about optimizations here , we 're talking about massive changes and malicious intent . 
  all big games from ubisoft have the first public showing made by using purpose built vertical slices which are based on the game 's assets and engine , but are * not * ( and not inteded to be ) close to the retail version . 
  until both the gamers and the media stop giving vertical slices the benefit of the doubt ( words and phrases like `` aplha '' or `` early build '' are being thrown around way too much , especially when the only available media consists of a few supersampled screenshots and an official video of a vertical slice ) , ubisoft will keep making these `` gameplay trailers '' and not labelling them as a vertical slice . 
  which is all this is about , trying to deceive the consumer . 
  [ this is how far can a vertical slice go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bliojirqfu ) ( ghost recon : future soldier ) . 
  * step 1 : release a video of the game 's `` gameplay '' which looks awesome , but it 's mostly made of scripted sequences , purpose made animations , in some cases hand scripted enemy behavior instead of ai and an engine beefed up to 11 ( as it 's not a problem to run these demos on super beefy pcs or render them ahead of time if no one 's going to be pretending to play them on stage ) . 
  * step 1 consequences : said video makes the game look awesome and fresh , hype is being built , the media obviously jumps on new `` aaa '' games and the video is beginning to go viral ... a few days to weeks later , a subset of people liking the video are beginning to change into fanboys defending the game everywhere they go . 
  * step 2 : several months to a year later , release another gameplay video , this time from an actual game ( of course still made in a controlled environment ) . 
  now start to spend at least as much money on marketing as you did on the game 's development . 
  * step 2 consequences : 90 % of people do n't really remember how the initial gameplay video looked like , they remeber it was great . 
  the new video looks significantly worse , but not to the point where most people buying videogames would notice . 
  if the actual gameplay looks anywhere close to something that may be fun , the game is set and at this point there 's nothing that could prevent it from being a hit . 
  the initial impression is incredibly important . 
  if a publisher can make a big splash from the beginning , the marketing will take care of the rest . 
  this is why you have to demand that publishers ( and ubisoft especially ) clearly label their vertical slices as a `` vertical slice '' . 
  do you have an anti-police boner ? 
  because you sound like one of those individuals . 
   officers attacking people over playful hits, 
  is complete bs you manufactured . 
  she was a ) close to a police officer and b ) touching him with the balloon dildo ( or whatever the fuck it is ) . 
  he ** popped her balloon ** . 
  that 's was it . 
  only an idiot or a person with an agenda can call that `` an attack '' . 
   maybe a piece of balloon in there ? 
  at the very least she was startled and scared . 
  who the fuck cares ? 
  is this thread being brigaded or are the opinions of r/kotakuinaction suddenly different than they usually are ? 
  the guy who said `` boohoo . 
  she was waving something in a riot police officer 's face and it was popped . 
  she 's lucky she was n't pepper sprayed . '', 
  is now -7 even though that 's exactly what could have happened . 
  would you try that on a regular police officer ? 
  people with this attitude ( getting close to officers/try to mess with them ) ** get shot ** and you think it 's somehow ok to do this just because you 're in a crowd/an activist ?
