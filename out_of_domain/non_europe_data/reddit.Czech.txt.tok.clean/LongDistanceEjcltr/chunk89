  you realize that facebook is actually a terrible tool for this , it 's only somewhat good because of its popularity . 
  facebook does * not * show you all posts from people and organizations you follow . 
  they want people to pay for that ( you 'd like this post to reach all your followers ? 
  well ... it ai n't gon na be cheap ) . 
   the american corporate media . 
  most of the big media is heavily liberal , pro-establishment and interested in keeping the status quo ( practical effect of which is keeping corporate shills like hillary and obama in power ) . 
  there 's nothing surprising or contradictory about that . 
  it 's like that for years and it 's showing in full colors during this presidential election . 
  those are the big media corps , kochs and the like . 
  ( btw fox is pretty much the same , just on the other end of the political horseshoe . ), 
   so eager to promote a moderate leftist like sanders, 
  sanders has been promoted by pretty much any online media without significant financial backing from a big media conglomerate . 
  a large portion of these would go for hillary , they just had a problem with her history ( which is understandable , as she 's a corrupt sociopath with flare-ups of incompetency [ [ 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybdqxmuqbyu ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uth7iv4ip1u ) , [ 3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hmeelkc5f8 ) ... ] ) ... you know , the likes of tyt , salon etc. 
  anyway , both hillary and sanders are ( well , appear to be ) leftist . 
  they differ only in their willingness to go against the system ( bernie : very much , hillary : not at all ) and the level of genuinity of their claims ( bernie : seems to believe in what 's he 's saying , hillary : does n't give a shit , reads/screams all the right things , but in the end she 'll stick with whoever pays the most or lobbies the best ) . 
  btw :, 
   moderate leftist, 
   sanders, 
  lol , since when is socialism mixed with a whiff of marxism `` moderate '' ? 
  imagine the ball being a cube . 
  what is this ranked you speak of ? 
  duuude . 
  how can you not use dickbutt ? 
  just a funny anecdote to go with that : 50 shades of grey contains situations that are clearly rape fantasies . 
  the main heroine finds herself in least one ( actually i think it 's a lot , but i ca n't be arsed to find out ) situation described by `` i said no , i resisted , he took me anyway ... but ... in the end ... 
  i liked the sex . '', 
  that shit is one of the most popular novels women read . 
  make the subreddit as strict as you want ... you stated so beforehand , i do n't see a problem . 
  make it a hugbox . 
  ** but ** ... it would be nice to finally have a place to post constructive and fact based criticism ( or just notes ) that people happen to have in mind in response to your videos . 
  the things that are n't ranting about your personality or preferences , but talking about the content you create ( obviously i 'd imagine there would n't be many - if any - relevant things to critize about your podcast , but wtf is / impressions are a different beast ) . 
  as far as i know , there 's no way to do that currently ... except maybe shouting on twitter ( eww ) and hoping to get noticed . 
  something like a [ feedback ] flair would be nice , for posts meant to be a critique or just notes that can make your videos better . 
  filter out the bs by modding and then let the ( up ) voting process do its thing , to see if other members of the community see it in a similar way .

  cops not releasing name ... call me whatever you want , but that would not happen if it was a case of `` christian crazies '' . 
  oh , would you look at this ? 
   local fbi assistant special agent-in-charge ron hopper said at the press conference that there are `` some suggestions '' the gunman `` may have leanings '' toward jihadist ideology, 
  i give this thread 3 minutes . 
  good point . 
  not such a dilemma after all !, 
  of course , what happened in paris was also clearly caused by readily available assault weapons . 
  i do n't know if i should celebrate or cry . 
  and if anything ... is n't this a failure of the system ? 
  the authorities were aware of him ... but that did n't stop him from doing what he did . 
  is n't that an argument * for * the guns ? 
  if the government ca n't protect you , you have to protect yourself ? 
  you get used to regressive shills spewing nonsense in the media , but when it comes from within the industry itself , it 's always a bit sad to see .

   he 's a little crazy, 
  a ) that and b ) he shouts over his reporters ... not a huge fan,

   adam saleh , perhaps the biggest dickhead and dunce on youtube , has called amos yee racist for mocking islam , and sent his 1.1 million subscribers to report amos 's video in an attempt to silence him . 
  the video has now been swarmed with muslims issuing threats , calls for the video to be taken down , and claims to have reported it . 
  you may recall that amos yee will probably serve between 18 months and 3 years in prison for mocking islam and christianity on youtube and other social media . 
  adam saleh 's new affront to free speech will not stand . 
  this is the uncensored version of amos 's video which does not currently exist on his channel . 
  mirror it everywhere . 
  thumb up amos yee 's video . 
  thumb down adam saleh 's video . 
  adam saleh and his followers can suck the free world 's balls . 
  that was top notch , dear sir ...

  no way linkedin 's value is anywhere close to $ 26.2 billion . 
  2 years `` microsoft to acquire linkedin for $ 26.2 billion '', 
  i do n't think you know what that insult means . 
  if you 're riding trump 's cock , as you say ... you 're fucking a dude . 
  what does it have to do with `` cuck '' ? 
  cuck comes from cuckold . 
  people who enjoy watching their partners being fucked by strangers are cuckolds . 
  this is why it 's used : on people who enjoy watching their country/liberties being fucked by strangers . 
  it fits perfectly on sjws/regressive left/bleeding heart liberals . 
  yes , you continue to make no sense at all . 
  frankly , i 'm amazed you have 55 upvotes . 
  there are 54 other idiots who do n't know what cuckold means . 
  ( more likely they just have a trump hate boner and all the blood is in their e-peen instead of their brain . ), 
  this is why this sub is a joke . 
  demonise christians for cake , defend muslims for 50 dead in a gay bar . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  if we leave out the obvious bias ( hey , let 's compare the most liberal portion of islam with the most conservative portion of christianity ) , the entire argument boils down to `` yeah , but christianity does n't approve of homosexuality too . '' ... 
  how is that relevant to the terrorist act . 
  what 's important - that islam , unlike christianity , teaches it is fine to * kill * gays - is mentioned nowhere , even though it 's at the core of the issue ( and no , that 's not an issue with just radical islam , but mainstream islam as well ) . 
  i also love how the reason.com article basically puts conservatives , libertarians and christians into one bag of people who might consider blaming guns and conservatives `` mystifying '' . 
  lol . 
  as if people like atheist trump supporters ( for example ) do n't exist . 
  i consider myself a secular humanist , do i also fit into that bag ? 
  i guess anyone who is n't a blind regressive fits . 
  no mention of logical arguments anywhere , nothing about bomb vests , france having strict gun control policies , just muh feelz and nonsense . 
  what i take away from the reaction of the left-leaning press is that wedding cake is a systemic problem , but 50 dead gays is a misunderstanding . 
  astonishing . 
  `` 19 gildings given out '' ...

  doom looked terrible on paper ( and even in trailers ) , but in the end , it 's an amazing game .
