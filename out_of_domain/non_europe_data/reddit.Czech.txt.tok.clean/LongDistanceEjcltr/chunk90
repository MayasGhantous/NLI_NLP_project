   we 're not setup for that, 
  well ... dang . 
  the most important thing is that he also hates battlefront :p, 
  battleship is a game . 
  and the movie was awesome ( as a summer action flick that is ) . 
  okay , okay , it 's not a video game ... but close enough , we have to take even the little things . 
  call me old school , but back in my day people were upset about soldier of fortune being ultra-violent and looking back , they kinda had a point ( i loved it ... but i 'm fucked up , heh ) ... now we 're getting butthurt by the mere act of shooting other people ( with very little graphic violence ) . 
  cool , a couple more years and we 'll get a proper sof game !, 
  says a guy with a dedicated `` worldnews_is_shit '' account ... let me guess , r/worldnews is a bastion of stormfront , is n't it . 
  please ... your kind belongs to two years ago . 
  go back there and do n't come back . 
  just one click on your account and i can see that all you care about is being a hardcore social justice warrior . 
  her, 
   in a useful . jpeg or . gif format ? 
  [ even better ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcp-ph3jtwa ) . 
  i thought we 've moved past this shit , why not call them what they want ? 
  2 genders , pick one of them and i 'll call you him or her ( especially if you make it obvious , e.g. 
  by changing your name ) . 
  doing that does n't hurt anyone in any way . 
  btw i 'm the last one who 'd language police ... 
  i have no issue with calling something `` gay '' ( in the sense of it being `` lame '' ) or use a word `` faggot '' in the sense milo uses . 
  i got banned from / science for not liking that they banned saying `` being transgender is a mental illness '' . 
  i just feel that insisting on calling someone him/her even though they do n't wish to be called that is a dick move . 
  that 's all . 
   if someone wants to misgender every trans person , they can do so freely, 
  yeah , but people can also have a problem with that , freely . 
  then let the voting system do its thing . 
  ( free speech does n't mean you 're immune to criticism . ), 
   they 'll also permaban you if you mention that being trans is a disorder, 
  `` mental illness '' . 
  and i did get banned for not being ok with that kind of censorship . 
  created / r/scienceplus as a result . 
  no need to argue with social justice warriors in a situation where they have all the power . 
  are you a muslim ? 
  or othodox christian ? 
  then shut your god damn mouth . 
  we have enough political correctness as it is . 
  -- h energy ? 
   uneasy, 
   unnecessary, 
   distracting, 
  she 's not topless . 
  said every mp game player ever . 
  99 % of the players do n't leave feedback . 
  if you really despise the game 's playerbase then there 's a simple solution : do n't play it . 
  i play multiplayer games since the first quake and the people who complain about the community/playerbase the most are usually the most toxic . 
  damn , young steph was fine :d, 
   this one, 
  heh , this has happened like a million times already . 
  the willingness of the admins to do something about these things is a ) limited by the sitewide rules and b ) limited by their political leanings . 
  if you 're a mod , you can do whatever the fuck you please as long as you adhere to the sitewide rules ( well , unless you 're a mod of srs ... in that case , the admins will try to look away even if you break those rules ) . 
  afaik the only consequence from this / news drama was that one mod got banned ( or deleted his account ) , but it had nothing to do with / news censorship , he just fucked up and said to one of the annoyed redditors to `` kill himself '' . 
  the only thing that could fix this mess is if the site decided to implement some kind of democratic mod election . 
  ( btw i can imagine all kinds of rules to prevent this from being abused - that would n't be an issue . ), 
  ** but that is the last thing reddit wants ** , what they want is a total control of the front pages ( they already controlled the front page , now they 're going for / all ) and judging by their actions against the_donald , they 're very much ready and willing to change the algorithms with that goal in mind . 
  first of all , how you people managed to make `` outrage porn '' about kotakuinaction sub , when it 's a gamergate hub which began due to collusion of game websites and consistently talks about shitty journalism and cronyism is beyond me . 
  `` hurr durr jurnalizm outrage porn kotakuinaction '' ... regressive left does n't exist . 
  please . 
  second , look at that dude 's profile . 
  `` trumptards '' , `` berntards '' ... the shining beacon of neutrality , lol . 
   out of the top ten posts ... original gg, 
  it 's been over two years , what the fuck do you expect ? 
  there have been many recurrent waves about gg , but it 's largely a thing of the past . 
  all the youtube videos have been made , wikis created , things discussed to infinity and beyond . 
  all these things are in the sidebar of that subreddit . 
  here 's the description of the subreddit :, 
   kotakuinaction is a platform for open discussion of the issues where gaming , nerd culture , the internet , and media collide . 
   has gone down the shitter here lately, 
  maybe the sub has been managed by crappy mods then . 
  i 've been here ( on/off ) since the gg began , do n't be a coward and dissolve the entire mod team if you stand by your words . 
  if the sub is in the shitter , as you say , then there 's no reason to continue . 
  yeah , i do n't know if talking about `` trust but verify has gone down the shitter '' in one post and `` not going to break trust '' in another is what i want to argue about . 
  i 'm done here . 
  ( you pretty much just said that people post crap and positioned yourself as a glorified word filter who ca n't do anything about it . ), 
   g2a , who 's main source of income is people buying codes with stolen credit cards , then selling them on g2a, 
  i 'll take `` i 'm gon na need a source '' for 500 , alex. 
   these cheap games, 
  i see no cheap games on g2a . 
  all new or aaa games are within 10 % of the steam price or ( if that 's cheaper ) the eu distribution ( not all publishers and not all games have different pricing schemes for different platforms and markets , but pretty much all eu cd keys are global - unlike the cheaper , russian ones ) . 
  and overwatch , for example , is more expensive than on blizzard 's own store ( 46.49 eur on g2a vs 39.99 eur on battle.net ) . 
  i never bought anything from g2a not because i disagree with their practices , but because it 's not worth it . 
  if you live in the eu , the site is close to useless these days . 
  look at doom , it 's currently 59.99 eur on steam , ** but ** it 's # 25.99 on amazon.co.uk !, 
  # 25.99 = 33.71 eur ... and g2a price ? 
  all these prices are well within `` buy low , sell high '' trading mantra . 
  the fact that people think g2a 's bussiness ** based ** on ** stolen ** keys is ridiculous . 
  nobody would buy anything from them ever again , deactivating licences coming from stolen keys is the easiest thing ever and has happened many times before . 
  the much more likely scenario is that g2a does n't care where the keys come from , as long as they work , and sometimes they happen to be stolen ( their bussiness would explode rather quickly if it was anywhere close to even 1 % of the keys ) ... for them , it 's a risk of doing bussiness , not the bussiness itself . 
  i hate to be `` that guy '' , but : reddit once again proves it 's clueless . 
  except they ca n't ban shit , because the keys are not tagged with a `` bought on g2a , please ban me '' sticker . 
  valve and blizzard titles are apparently one of the most popular ones on g2a right now ... ( even though i ca n't see why , as the prices seem to be [ quite high ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/4p0nzd/g2a_sold_450k_worth_of_our_game_keys/d4hphc7 ) ), 
  but that has nothing to do with g2a itself ... these people just had bad luck and bought one of the stolen keys . 
  look , g2a is pretty much ebay , they even have seller ratings . 
  the fact is that if i decide to buy a bunch of guild wars 2 expansion boxes from my local store ( which happens to have a sale right now , 29.5 eur for physical guild wars 2 : heart of thorns box with an eu key ) and sell the keys on g2a/kinguin/whatever , arena.net ca n't do anything about it as the keys are 100 % legit . 
  i can buy the expansion for $ 49.99 on their guildwars2.com store or i can buy a physical box for $ 29.5 in my local store . 
  that 's not criminal , that 's being smart . 
  and the kyes are from the same eu distribution !, 
  btw the cheapest heart of thorns on g2a is $ 30 ... that 's oddly specific , do n't you think ? 
  edit :, 
  it 's also just [ # 25 ] ( https://www.amazon.co.uk/guild-wars-heart-thorns-purchase/dp/b010023xaq/ ) ( $ 32.5 ) on amazon.co.uk ... full $ 17.5 cheaper than on the official site .
