  i 'm seriously starting to think that us-based people see prices like $ 32.5 and instantly think `` that has to be stolen '' simply because a ) it looks too low and b ) every once in a while some indie devs selling their keys for pennies on bundle sites get mad ( and write articles ) when a bunch of them get bought/stolen/chargebacked by criminals and happen to end on key reselling sites . 
  then you have a ) and b ) and the g2a scam is obvious . 
  lol . 
  full disclosure : i 've never bought anything on g2a ever . 
   i ca n't specifically recommend any grey-market seller for a variety of reasons, 
  hmm , can we post some ? 
  i bought a [ few keys ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8acbmt9.png ) over the years from cdkeys.com and never had a problem ... 
  yes , a website that exists for at least 3 years ( most likely much more , ca n't be arsed to find out though ) and nobody complains about it ( look at their [ fb ] ( https://www.facebook.com/cdkeyscom/ ) ) . 
  you 'd get nowhere with stolen keys if you 'd sell them yourself . 
  the only reason sites like g2a can get away with occasional issues like that is because they 're just a middle man , ebay of keys . 
  cdkeys.com sells the keys to you , there 's no middle man . 
  btw the prices are well within the eu discount prices ( and some of these can be found on amazon.co.uk for a similar price ) . 
  if we start with jackfrags , i 'm okay with this ... 
   if a streamer like flamu was using cheats, 
  let 's not put a random autistic streamer ( who 's dick is being regularly sucked by children on this subreddit ) on a level of someone who 's actually done something good for the community ( and yes , i know that aslain 's mod is predominantly `` just '' a * pack * of mods from many authors ) . 
  ** if it were n't for aslain 's mod pack ( and its popularity ) , half of the ui improvements would n't be in the game . 
  ** think about that next time you open your filthy mouth . 
   probably cared about the game, 
  wow , what an amazing argument . 
  i care about the game because i play it ... therefore i 'm contributing something . 
  lmao . 
   someone will take his place, 
  i 'm willing to bet you 're one of those people who does n't give a shit about anything or anyone but himself . 
  it 's always this kind of people saying `` someone will take his place '' , meanwhile they 've never done a single altruistic thing their entire life . 
  black hole from a surface of an orbiting planet ? 
   i 've nothing to do with this, 
  wg stole half the ui ideas from the mod pack ... 
  i wonder if the respective modders were ever credited . 
  now you ban one modder for testing mods - and on patch day no less . 
  a modder who apparently does n't even play the game that much and has nothing to gain by cheating . 
  awesome ... 
   not all of them, 
  as if that ever happens . 
  the referendum turnout was 71.8 % , that 's extremely high . 
  do n't forget the whole [ leicester winning the premier league ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/44w18p/if_you_are_not_watching_the_premier_league_here/ ) thing . 
  i feel like this is the error in the matrix we 've been waiting for . 
  it 's all just a simulation !, 
   that 's a decent request, 
  if you think that 's a `` decent '' request you 're fucking insane and do n't deserve the right to vote . 
  72 % turnout was already ridiculously high . 
  `` 60 % majority '' is a number who someone just pulled out of their ass because it seemed high enough . 
  the people should n't be allowed to vote on some things ( e.g. 
  making murder legal , abolishing basic human rights etc. ), 
  but this kind of malicious goalpost moving is intellectual cancer . 
  then filter out the votes not made from uk based ips . 
   does n't require 2/3 of votes is not democracy, 
  you read it here first , folks . 
  51 % is not a majority , 2/3 is . 
  pathetic . 
  i have no other words . 
  65 out of 100 people want out . 
  not enough , we need 2/3 . 
  now you have 35 people deciding for the other 65 . 
  that 's is ** not ** fair in any way , that is ** not ** democratic in any way . 
  the 2/3 thing has nothing to do with democracy , it 's only there in some countries to make it harder for the respective bodies of government to change the core elements of the state - like the constitution - based on political trends or temporary issues . 
  it 's a buffer ( often just one of the buffers ) that make this intentionally hard to do . 
  great , now his videos will be neutered to avoid possibly ever offending anyone . 
  pc is cancer . 
  was it hitler ? 
  i see ... the german self-torture over ww2 continues to this day . 
  importing millions of undocumented low skill muslims will help out with that . 
   it has forever been tainted by the nazis and outside historical contexts, 
  the game is about ww1-ww2 warships ... if that 's not historical context , i do n't know what else is . 
  the problem is that germany is so pussified it bans any depiction of anything nazi related in any media . 
  you know you got issues when a game like wolfenstein , a game about alternate history ww2 ( where the nazis are all depicted as 100 % bad guys btw ) , gets censored in germany . 
  god bless america . 
  [ i beg to differ . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd5mqjvhw9c ), 
  is rx 490 going to be a thing before vega comes out ? 
  20 minutes of his quasi bored voice ? 
  i 'd rather listen to daniel ( uk ) for 20 hours . 
  which is about as useful as a chocolate teapot ... when i have thousands of wows gold on my account . 
  were n't the wargaming games supposed to have merged premium economies already like a year ago ? 
  ( the fact that this is even needed is ridiculous , i want to change my name in game x , but i need credits in game y i never even installed . ), 
   mileage seems to vary . 
  it 's all about the motherboard and the quality of its power delivery . 
  old and/or cheap motherboards can have issues going over the 75w spec . 
   funny thing is if they had just gone with an 8 pin wire, 
  for anyone interested in this card : wait for the customized board partner designs . 
  better cooling , better power delivery , similar price . 
  the same applies for nvidia 's cards . 
  yes , they take the gpu and use it with heir own pcb and cooling designs . 
  all do this . 
  the rx480 cards available right now are just the reference design with a sticker slapped on top ( [ like in this image ] ( https://asset.msi.com/global/picture/news/2016/vga/20160628_1.png ) ) . 
  custom designs should be available soon , most of them will look completely different than the reference design ( [ like in this image ] ( https://asset.msi.com/global/picture/news/2016/vga/20160628_3.png ) ) . 
  msi , sappire , people also like xfx and asus . 
  most of them will have multiple versions of their rx480 designs available , from the cheapest ones to the most beefy ones . 
  the latest set of rumors has it that some of the custom rx480 designs can reach [ 1480mhz to 1600mhz overclocks ] ( https://hardforum.com/threads/first-gaming-benchmarks-up.1903628/#post-1042385515 ) ( 17 % to 26 % , which would put it somewhere between 980 and 980ti ) . 
  since amd released an official tool for hassle-free overclocking of their gpus ( [ wattman ] ( http://www.amd.com/en-us/innovations/software-technologies/technologies-gaming/radeon-wattman ) ) , it should n't be a problem for people with ( almost ) any level of `` computer knowledge '' to oc their card . 
  pretty much all of them will have that . 
  the rest is about reviews and your budget . 
  msi 's gaming x series , for example , has a price premium , but probably the best air cooling in the biz ( twin frozr , [ pretty damn good ] ( https://tpucdn.com/reviews/msi/gtx_1070_gaming_x/images/fannoise_load.png ) ) . 
  asus strix series and gigabyte 's g1 gaming series are similar . 
   i could cancel it but i 'm not sure how much longer i 'm willing to wait . 
  i 'm not aware of any issues with the supply ( like 1070 and 1080 have thanks to tsmc ) ... so , at the very least the rx480 will not get more expensive or unavailable . 
  as for the availability of the partner boards , the rumors seems to indicate just `` soon '' ( a few weeks tops ) . 
  should be worth the wait , though :, 
   kyle bennet , editor at hardocp.com revealed earlier today that amd 's add-in-board partners -- aibs -- report that rx 480 graphics cards with `` extremely good air coolers '' are hitting anywhere from 1480mhz to 1600mhz depending on the silicon lottery . 
  which is 17 % to 26 % higher than the stock clock speed of 1266mhz on the reference rx 480 design . 
  depends on the partner and how much they spend on the given design ( some partners like msi , xfx , etc.
