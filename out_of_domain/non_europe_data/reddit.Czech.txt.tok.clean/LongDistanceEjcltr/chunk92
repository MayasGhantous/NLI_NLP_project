  have multiple designs coming ) ... some of them will cost $ 240 , some of them more . 
  so that 's why human life means shit and everyone is corrupt in brazil ... they 're getting fucked up from young age :p, 
   sjw is kind of a blanket extreme term that seems to only exist on the internet . 
  sure . 
  that 's what a sjw would say . 
  `` nothing to see here , move along . '', 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yccp36n2cdg < - the behavior of some of the members of the crowd displayed in the video is not an exception , it is a rule . 
  i can point you toward literally hundreds of videos with that kind of people . 
  the regressive left ( as are the sjws called by some very reasonable people like dave rubin , bill maher , sam harris , gad saad etc. ), 
  is very real and affects people 's real lives much more than you might think . 
  the fact that someone tries to sell this is not sad , some people will do anything for profit ( plus when your kids do n't have anything to eat , your morals may go out of the window real quick ) ... what is sad is the fact that there 's market for this , which suggests some deep issues in the chinese culture . 
  people who buy this enjoy watching living creatures suffer . 
  whatever your culture has taught you , enjoying other living creature 's suffering is fucked up . 
  man ... on one hand we have all these crazy vegans who will not eat even things like honey or milk ( you know , because the animals are our slaves , lol ) and on the other hand we have these fucked up sadistic people who enjoy their food and now even their toys when they 're alive and suffering . 
  humans are fucked up ... there 's still way too much monkey in us . 
  the whole notion of `` regulating '' encryption is absurd . 
  you ca n't regulate math , silly politicians . 
  what the fuck , another abuse of the dmca . 
  the fair use here is as clear as it can get . 
   a key consideration in recent fair use cases is the extent to which the use is * transformative * . 
  unless uefa made that edit ( all penalties merged into one video ) , it 's absolutely a transformative work . 
  they will ... probably ... most likely when it 's too late . 
  eye opening video on this topic : [ part 1 ] ( https://youtu.be/txk-czrfeoq ) , [ part 2 ] ( https://youtu.be/t3gifdxe5fy ) . 
  looks like changing your facebook profile picture to a french flag does n't really stop the terrorist attacks . 
  surprising !, 
  maybe , perhaps ... dare i say it ... what about some form of immigration control ? 
  just a thought . 
  look , u/flossdaily is famous again, 
  been playing ranked for about a week or 10 days ... now i regret that i did n't start sooner , it 's been a lot of fun and the competition is n't nearly as hardcore as i expected . 
  all these grand-dads getting mad at you xd, 
  good thing it was n't cloyster , that would be awkward ... 
  something close to this happened to me maybe twice in over 1000 games ( this kind of deletion of several ships back to back ) . 
  best feeling in the game ... when your aim is true and your dispersion dice roll comes out great and half of your team is seeing what just happened ... this is why i 've always liked battleships the most . 
  no amount of torp krakens comes close to annihilating people like that . 
  ( also , i have an iowa/montana fetish . 
  yep , [ montana is alright ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fba3by1.png ) :d ... on the other hand , i never liked yamato , it 's too much of a sniper ( which is not really what i look for in wows bbs and why i prefer playing ranked at t6/7 ) . 
   verifiable, 
  not that anyone 's going to go the extra mile and verify it . 
  yes , i 've read the article too ... what i 'm making fun of is that no one ( as in 1 % of people or less ) is going to `` verify '' shit , no one ever does . 
  do you ? 
  i bet you do n't . 
  ( that 's why `` reputable '' publications even exist . 
  a subset of the population who cares about the quality of the news is willing to pay more and/or be entertained less to get this double checking done for them . ), 
  `` if it 's verifiable and legitimate info '' in this context sounds like a joke . 
  obviously in this concrete example where the source is a nyt first-party interview ( that even has a [ transcript ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/us/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy-interview.html ) ) , the legitimacy of the information is trivial to check , but that is an exception . 
   who the fuck are you, 
   in the future, 
  not if you live in flint ... 
   he 's making unannounced edits, 
  i lol 'd . 
  you must be new here . 
  people care about your posts way less than you might think . 
  ( read : the do n't give a shit . ), 
  btw i added the sentence in parentheses within like a minute or two of my initial posting . 
  nothing in relation with `` who the fuck are you to imply this at this juncture ? '', 
  has changed . 
   to defend against further edits : screenshot, 
  i lol 'd even more . 
  and since we 're playing stupid games , your `` to defend against further edits : screenshot '' was an `` unannouced '' edit . 
  i should probably make a screenshot next time to `` defend '' against it . 
  lmao . 
   there is no reason to ~ ~ click ~ ~ read that , but i accept your inability to contribute anything else relevant . 
  please do n't pick a train , innocent people have shit to get to on time . 
  a high building seems like a good compromise ( look for large , empty spaces to land on ) - you 'll get a quick & painless way to go out and the other people wo n't get annoyed too much . 
  the emergency services workers will just pick up your neatly packed meat bag and thank you that you did n't putrefy for a week and made a terrible mess , everyone knows you 're dead and your relatives wo n't have to find you . 
  yes , but he could have fired them anyways , there 's a short period of time when the tubes were lined up and he was still far enough . 
   that still inconveniences people, 
  how ? 
  that they have to look at you ? 
  not for long , one of the first people on the scene will cover you you up . 
  unpleasant sight is the lowest of inconveniences . 
   just use car exhaust and make sure no one finds you before you 're done or you 'll end up with brain damage, 
  `` just '' ? 
  it 's not even close to jumping from height in terms of assured death ( pick a 10 + story building and impact on concrete/asphalt at any angle ... you will die ) . 
  you may very well end up just with a fucked up heart and fried brain . 
  not to mention that pretty much all modern cars do n't really produce that much carbon monoxide and your tolerance level may be higher than usual due to many factors . 
  the claim that it 's painless is also kinda weak . 
  maybe in the best case scenario if you manage to get a large enough concetration in a couple of breaths and quickly pass out . 
  the motherfuckers need to implement at least the fucking smaa . 
  it 's on fucking [ github ] ( https://github.com/iryoku/smaa ) and it 's fucking free for fuck sake . 
  it 's a fucking postprocess aa technique like fxaa , but with a much higher quality . 
  there is no reason not to have it . 
   grind out the kills needed to get her in game, 
  huh ? 
  within the limits of what a post process aa can do , it does a much , much better job than fxaa3 . 
  you do n't even have to go for t2x , even 1x looks better than fxaa3 . 
  fxaa3 : http://forum.unity3d.com/attachments/fxaa3-png.137732/, 
  smaa 1x : http://forum.unity3d.com/attachments/smaa1x-png.137733/, 
  not to mention that fxaa3 is blur city , no aa may be better than fxaa3 . 
  look at this crap : http://forum.unity3d.com/attachments/fxaa3-png.137433/, 
  yeeey , i can now see some details : http://forum.unity3d.com/attachments/smaa_ultra-png.137434/, 
  pretty good , it 's quite hefty temporal aa after all . 
  still , perfect cables and lines will always be a struggle unless you use supersampling or at least some clever aa that combines super sample and temporal aa elements ( like epic 's ue4 primary aa , the [ temporal supersampling ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynq47my-eo0 ) ), 
  i do n't know if i should try to joke or not ... 
  i mean , there 's a real possibility of something like that happening . 
  make no mistake , this is a big deal and the russians have the means . 
  a sound advice , mr. / u/anal _ mcdick_rape, 
   they 're real things but the entire game is based towards damage . 
  not if :, 
  * you do n't care and play for fun .
