  [ joanne deborah byron ] ( https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/joanne-deborah-chesimard ) ( also known as assata shakur , a member of black liberation army , a former terrorist organization targeting police with assasinations and bombings ) , who is an [ inspiration ] ( http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/ ) to alicia garza , one of the feminists who founded blm ( alicia garza , patrisse cullors , opel tometi ) . 
  blm protesters and supporters are regularly [ seen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cre3ctr.png ) idolizing assata ( or just look at twitter ) and shouting things [ like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj4arsxrzh8 ) . 
   was anticipated, 
  yeah . 
  anticipated for 150 years :p, 
   who * you think * assata shakur is, 
  lfmao ... no other reaction is needed . 
   defense, 
  he does n't need any defense . 
  she engaged him , not the other way around . 
  you 're not obliged to tell any random person your name and if they ask for it , especially in a way she did , i 'd be wary of their intentions . 
  btw why would you want some stranger to tell you his name unless you wanted to know it for future reference ? 
  to shame him and bully him ? 
  this is a valid concern , especially recently with all the sjw craziness and virtue signalling ( i.e. 
  sj brownie points ) ... and we 've seen that she posted the video on facebook and the people in her bubble `` supported '' her and dogpiled him . 
  if the broader internet did n't notice and the guy was working a desk job in some random company that would rather give you the boot after a few angry sjw emails calling you a rapist than to `` have problems '' , he may have been fired , easily . 
  this stuff has happened before . 
  well sjws are the number one group supporting blm ( and blm 's relations with the police are ... um , complicated ) * and * there is a lot of overlap , soo ... 
  i could see that happening . 
  edit : well she 's apparently a blm activist mad that the media is talking to a `` pro-cop '' dude . 
  seems like an older guy , working class , maybe he does n't have a computer or just its n't well versed in all the skyping ( is that even a word ? ), 
  and a member of the family has brought in a notebook to chat with ethan . 
  you 're talking about side armor but not mentioning citadel position , which is completely under water in nc , while a big chunk of it is above the waterline in iowa and montana . 
  it effectively makes both ships worse at brawling than nc . 
  14 upboats and no comments ? 
  not on my watch !, 
  on topic : survived worse situations :p , all you need is the rngesus to be with you that match . 
  how many subs are stationed there at a time ? 
  asking for a russian friend ... 
  one sub carries 20 tridents . 
  each trident has 8 warheads . 
  9962 is not that much . 
  down from 30k . 
  a beautiful thing . 
  for example , their `` trolling wannabe pornstars '' series is a dramatization of what militant feminists imagine all men behave like . 
  a great way to calibrate your `` misogyny '' meter . 
  it 's also the site that popularized the infamous `` itz nothing , itz only the smellz '' quote . 
  good stuff . 
  also , the most edgy people on the planet earth wear efukt t-shirts ... so , now you know . 
  comedy site with original content , very much nsfw , sometimes disgusting , sometimes hilarious ( and everything in between ) . 
  i 'd like to state for the record that i do n't like animu . 
  there are more sane people like that in this sub . 
  we 'd like to create an union against animu and have our representative in the ~ ~ government ~ ~ mod team . 
   i image searched ars nova and one of the first things to come up related to it and not music , was an image of totally nude bathing scene with one girl washing the other wearing nothing more than bath bubbles . 
  / u/narkai got rekt . 
  i 'm about 99.9 % sure he has one of those pillows with underage female animu characters on them and considers it totally not perverted :d ... 
  edit : come on people , i 'm just trollin ' a bit . 
  it 's not like i was talking about some serious perversion ... like i do n't know ... bronies have : x ok , ok , i 'm going away now, 
   your presence is not needed . 
  this is what the pedobear says to the parents of his underage friends ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  same here . 
   i think the only argument that tx repair costs are justified is if tx play is supposed to be discouraged . 
  it ... actually is . 
  kinda . 
  to keep their bussiness model working , wg needs :, 
  * a steady stream of new players to replace the player loss . 
  * a steady stream of paying players . 
  there are premium ships , which represent an obvious source of one time payments , but they 're not really a money sink . 
  the money sink is in the grind ( premium ) and in the consumables . 
  they balance the economy and progression in such a way that the mid tiers ( where the real grind begins ) are constantly being played and the new players have opponents . 
  t4-t7 is the meat of the game . 
  the high tiers are set up in a way that basically requires you to pay to play ( pay for premium at the very least ) . 
  you just barely make some credits when you have premium and a decent game . 
  it 's their way of saying `` okay , you 've been playing the game for weeks or months , it 's now time to pay . '', 
  without actually blocking access to people who did not pay . 
  wg * does not * want you to be playing t9 and t10 unless you 're paying them , but they 're fine with you not paying them if you 're playing the low to mid tiers since you play the with the newbies who may become paying players in the future . 
  good amount of depth ? 
  you can call it many things , deep is not really one of them . 
  the movement system is super simplistic compared to arena shooters and the gameplay mechanics with maps are super simplistics compared to mobas . 
  it 's a mix of different genres , but it 's not a deep game . 
  the whole new genre of `` hero shooters '' has been incredibly shallow so far ( compared to games they 're inspired by ) . 
  it almost seems like some designer higher up at wg threw a hissy fit and said :, 
   oh you do n't like being burned from the smooke , riiight ??? 
  okaaay , okaay , no smoke , we will remove the smoke . 
  we will !, 
  and while we 're at it we 'll also remove the he shells !, 
  now you 're happy !?!, 
  ( read it with russian accent ), 
  for real though , what i said 2 days ago in the bb bow armor thread about [ desperately trying out random design changes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofwarships/comments/52lfrk/sub_octavian_comments_on_the_battleship_bow_armor/d7l8b0n ) ... yeah . 
   i think that recent fiasco with rn cl line and smoke kinda proves that . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldofwarships/comments/52ybb4/royal_navy_cl_latest_balancing_changes_ap_shell/ ), 
   battleship ap can get full penetrations if the dd is longways to them, 
  nice anecdote , but hitting a dds longways is a ) extremely rare and b ) 100 % down to a lucky dice roll as a longways dd is a tiny target at all but the point blank ranges . 
  being so insignificant , it should n't play any role in thinking about the balance of the game . 
  source article with the comment : http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-poll.html . 
  reader 's pick . 
  well , i guess this is the new kind of `` objective '' used when talking about `` objective '' reporting the likes of nyt do ... lol . 
   started noticing it happening more often it seems, 
  because lemming trains actually work in wows . 
  once you 're spotted in wows you ca n't really run and hide from an overwhelming force ( unless you 're in a destroyer ) , the game is much more about the [ cold hard math ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0goqrvf-tu ) than wot for example . 
  the lemming trains can be a bad thing if they overextend or pick a wrong flank and only meet a few ships ( which , at the start of the game , is mostly about luck ) , but the tactic is generally supported by the game mechanics . 
  i 've been in so many games with three flags where the enemy ( or us ) hold 2 of the flags for 3/4 of the game ... yet they ( we ) lose anyways because the point rewards for destroying a ship are so high . 
  the dragon flags alone make up for any random bs rewards . 
  i mean it 's not amazing for everyone ( and it should n't be , this celebration should be more about the veterans ) , but if you have at least 500 games , you get 50 dragon flags ... that is huge ( i have ~ 1.5 k games and one t10 ship , i 'll get 150 dragon flags ) . 
  the grind for the tier 5 captain skills is crazy and by the time you 'll get to that manual fire control ( or concealment expert ) , you 'll be in a t9 ship and well into the t10 grind , completely missing the fun of the nagato or bismarck with the boosted secondaries ( for example ) . 
  yep , last time there was a stat posted here about the player spending , na has been leading , followed by eu ( but it was not 2x as much i think ) . 
  russia is far down , ca n't imagine china is much better in that regard . 
  i wonder which territory brings in the most cash overall .
