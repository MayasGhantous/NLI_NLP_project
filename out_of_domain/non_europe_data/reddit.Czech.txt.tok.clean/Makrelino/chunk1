i 'm just about to finish my da marathon ( o-a-2 ) . 
  i think bioware wanted to develop some new concept ( see http://i.imgur.com/9rybs.jpg ), 
  also i do n't know how about you , but i am kinda tired from all this epicness , ( maybe too much epicness in me3 ) ... but i guess it s normal for new franchise to develop itself in some form of epic saga ( grey warden vs the blight in dao ) - introduce the world , fractions , important people - and then after it is mature introduce some personal stories like leliana song dlc in da :o , or hawke 's escape from lothering . 
  in the first two acts story is personal and then in third act it gets epic - collision between two mighty fractions - in order to move da franchise one step further in some direction . 
  but i just hate the same reused enviroments . 
  it is feels so sterile . 
  they could just make kirkwall in winter or whatever . 
  thedas is so large and its pity and waste of resources that we have to spend one game in one city . 
  cgp grey !!, 
  morinth !!, 
  i think it is the best death ... and also i wan na know how does it feel to touch their hair-things , and their body ... and * azure *, 
  dunno ... maybe aria ... and then i 'd broke one and only rule ... muhaha, 
  well it is for * one * day so let 's get something extraordinary such as grunt rite of passage , or headbutt krogan ... should it be longer term then consorts are hot favourites certainly, 
  she even got her own mini statue on biostore !!, 
  point taken, 
  but thane is dying : '' ' (, 
  well my guess is that after politicians will return from their holidays things will get nasty again ... then ecb will come and save the day ... and ... 
  im afraid we will be getting these manic-depressive situations till german election in autumn 2013, 
  really ? 
  respect bro ... 
  i have difficulties to read during my activity peaks like 3pm or 8pm, 
  oh how i envy you to have such calming places to read ... doesnt window interrupt you or stealing your attention while reading ? 
  you know broodmothers right ? 
  these are transformed females of various races . 
  different race produces different darkspawn ... 
  simple . . kinda similiar to reaper transformation of various species in mass effect, 
  okay maybe little late but still some effort to defend kai leng . 
  you know i was reading deception novel recently . 
  lets just put aside the fact that it has some errors ... [ tons of them actually ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xbpmf3onli308d9igg8kicbhfwku0sxh0ntukv-_cmo/preview?pli=1&amp;sle=true ) . 
  kai leng plays a major part there and therefore i accept kai leng as lore person , loyal agent and right hand of illusive man , and i quite enjoyed details that were developed during flashbacks in the book . 
  like [ slavic origins ] ( / spoiler ) , his joining to cerberus ... fancy stuff like that . 
  however his appearance in game is confusing e.g. 
  his augumented face ... 
  well to adress this ninja soldier style ... that was exactly the reason why i was fearing multiplayer `` omfg there will super hyper cool things like scifi ninja , weapons that will blow your apart , god biotic powers just to attract people its must have '', 
  and to adress cutscene powers ... you remember jack right from me2 ... and you recall the scenes , where she charged at two ymir mechs just with his biotic fists !, 
  that plus some nasty vulgarism and we ` got great villain , except she is on your side ... cutscenes doesnt represent reality - game designers will always want you to see the perspective e.g. 
  jack is a badass , must have , while i was never using her in combat , miranda will tear up mech from 150 m - i doubt that and i could continue . . 
  mass effect 2 was a great game and despite some weaker scenes we are going to remember great feelings like entering afterlife . 
  me 3 was rather disappointment so despite epic scenes like entering mars archives , we 're gon na remember things that let us down or get us angry ... like kai leng for some . 
  i mean its much easier to see weak points in `` weak '' game . 
  i wish i would find these in my bookstore ... 
  they only sell books, 
  well i go to [ ft alphaville ] ( http://ftalphaville.ft.com/ ) for regular 6 am london cut , early lunch wrap and closer for summary of markets . 
  then i visit [ http://counterparties.com/] ( http://counterparties.com/ ) which picks important stories instead of me ... 
  well i dont know about you , but map from nwn2 or bg was good aspect which enchanced game ... and also during the awakening you had to take care of the keep - upgrading walls , helping merchants , sending troops ... 
  i expect something similiar but rather more sophisticated ... and btw it seems to me that move to rts is better that move to the action click-fest type . 
  go to orzammar before circle of magi !!!, 
  you can earn a lot of money !!!, 
  you dont need to finish orzammar just find smuggler . . go on and check dragon age wiki for another tips, 
  but it can also protect your saves from bugs etc, 
  so correct answer was d ) , but thank a lot for feedback, 
  perhaps you 'll finds some tips here [ mergersandinqusitions ] ( http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/ ), 
  explain yourself !, 
  guess your username came true then ... 
  that 's cool !, 
  i would love to have some kind of vase of something like that ... 
  dude i came across for you for a second time . . do you even enjoy doing that while getting no karma at all ? 
  are you sure about working part ? 
  because you 're replying to almost every post here ... 
  i always buy ring `` lifegiver '' in orzammar for my tank for 80 sovs ... 
  but i would recommend saving a lot for awakening ... paragon runes are n't cheap, 
  if i recall correctly , you 'll get anvil savior achievement , right after you [ won battle siding with branka . 
  after you return to orzammar you should be able to choose who is going to be king ] ( / spoiler ), 
  do n't you already have those achievments ? 
  because i do 'n remember any problems with acquiring achievments in da :o, 
  out of ideas , sorry, 
  here is what i found http://www.hrejsi.cz/karty/sibrinky.htm ... 
  correct pronouciation is here http://translate.google.cz/#cs/en/%c5%a1%c3%adb%c5%99inky , this is the first time i saw this word in czech and does n't have any meaning ... just a name of a game, 
  i do n't know about the `` costabi '' ... 
  i 'm trying saying in many way with diacritic , but still it does n't sound like any czech swear-word, 
  why not buy it ? 
  you will support authors and franchise . . 
  well sorry to hear that . 
  you see these books are available on internet for free - you just need to google them using right terms ... 
  but still i encourage you to buy them or borrow them from library if possible ... 
  how about rebooting - holding home + unlock ? 
  hmm ... 
  so i get that you can access your ipad after reboot ... 
  try turning off picture frame in settings-general-passcode lock . . note i 'm using ipad `` 3 '' so do n't know whether it works same ... if nothing helps i 'm sure that folks at istore will help you out, 
  i would recommend keeping an eye on this subreddit and also r/prague there was redditor hangout recently and more are definitely coming i hope , 
  glad i could help, 
  thank you , that will help a lot !, 
  when i be dad , i will be doing exactly that !, 
  seeing snow for the first time when you are kinda older must be cool . . 
  if you would want to see more of it , well that depends where you live ... chmi.cz says that there is some possibility for little snow this week ... 
  wasting time ... 
  even though he has still tone of important work ... look at the wrist ... porn addict ... low self esteem ... wo n't achieve anything but that 's as irrelevant as his life ... like to think of himself as a grammar expert ... 
  it is obvious !, 
  he is reddit user !, 
  joshua brown aka reformed broker created map of [ financial blogs ] ( http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2012/12/24/enter-the-financial-blogosphere/ ) , and divided it into some categories ... 
  enjoy !, 
  just what exactly confused you ? 
  and why should be any recommendations involved ? 
  i know that op was looking for some decent blogs , and that i provided link to map of them , but still somebody appreciated my post . 
  never mind , my question was aiming somewhat differently . 
  from the looseleafer comment , i understand that all or most posts of josh brown involve only classifications and lack recommendations ... 
  so therefore question `` why recommendations ? '', 
  thank you !, 
  just one detail czechoslovakia was part of soviet bloc not soviet union, 
  because i played da :o on weak computer i have something to add to 1 ) ...
