  did it really work ? 
  because when i do that , they reappear after some time again . 
  i never made it past a week . 
  motivated to beat that . 
  why was the dog lovely ? 
  try one week with `` leak '' . 
  google did find some thread in cdpr forums but i am unable to reach it . 
  from what i found , somebody from 4chan got his hands on the google account of one cdpr employee . 
  lots of story stuff leaked , so beware of spoilers . 
  dude , garrus is dying . 
   ~ ~ i believe its kalovy most in slovak ~ ~, 
  well apart from comics point i ca n't think of anything . 
  well there are some online stores like http://www.fategate.com/ but i guess that would be problematic ? 
  i would say comicspoint rather focuses on merchandise , less on comics and i fear they might not have any comic books in english . 
  it really depends on what you need . 
  i remember i wanted mass effect and dragon age stuff and all they have were some deck of cards and normady models , no comics or clothing etc. 
  for me personally it is the atmosphere . 
  almost all fantasy rpgs have do not have believable medieval spirit . 
  take dragon age for example . 
  putting game mechanics aside which are great btw characters and npcs do not swear or fuck which if i remember correctly from high school are characteristics of medieval . 
  with other rpgs i am missing the `` piss and shit on streets '' part of medieval . 
  the witcher goes further and deeper where other rpg remain shallow and kinda heroically sugary, 
  he looks like fat lady sat on his face, 
  i think he is reffering to book series, 
  this is some wallpaper material , too bad he uses a watermark :(, 
  what other way than mordin 's voice ? 
  kurwa certainly does not mean hype in nor czech nor polish , you know ... 
  where did you buy it ? 
  thanks !, 
  deus ex human revolution , i believe . 
  great game . 
  chrome + hola extension buddy, 
  you should include a banana for a scale . 
  being european i have problems with inches and pints and such . 
  cuties . 
  also nice sheets, 
  does she look like a zoidberg without the shell ? 
  any tips on how to overcome this problem would be greatly appreciated !, 
  ok so just to check if i get it , the lower ni margin here is signalling higher future growth rather than poor performance , right ? 
  thanks !, 
  is there somebody actually paying you for that ? 
  thanks !, 
  to add i choose ni margin just because the regression had greatest fit to be honest . 
  with ebitda margin it is basically the same story [ http://imgur.com/zgbk5ac] ( http://imgur.com/zgbk5ac ) . 
  and in b ) you mean historical margins are not drivers of value , right ? 
  because i was always assuming that future margins actually are drivers - roic = noplat margin x ic turnover . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  i am definitely going to opt now for the expected returns or margins . 
  i was just confused by how could there could such a strong trend and maybe i overstressed historical performance here . 
  i guess this kinda highlight the fact how much is this industry growth-oriented . 
  i came across this kind of chart when i was looking at central european banks . 
  if your sample is comparable , this trendline can then be used as a quick valuation tool [ http://imgur.com/ulggulu] ( http://imgur.com/ulggulu ) . 
  all the banks here are operating in rather same geography , they face rather same growth prospects etc. 
  on the x-axis you would put some sort of operations metric . 
  here it is roe . 
  on the y-axis you put some valuation multiple , here it is price to tangible book value . 
  what you are assuming here is that there is some relationship between profitability and valuation . 
  so you ask a excel to run a regression and it will put the trendline in . 
  look at for the example bzw bank . 
  regression line suggests that with its roe around 14 % it `` should have ptb '' around 2x . 
  however its ptb is actually 2.5 x which implies that the bank is overpriced . 
  but of course it is not a thorough dcf , it only gives a quick idea about relative valuation . 
  but i actually saw valuations where this trendline serves as a way to assign proper multiple rather than just using multiple 's median or mean . 
  so i tried the same thing with an enterprise software here and i ended with negative slope . 
  i was sort of confused because i was expect positive relationship between margins and valuation . 
  but as you can see i underestimated strong growth aspect of the industry and used bad metric and multiple ending up with negative relationship .

  why are you so hard on your dog ? 
  i threw it on the gggroouuundddd !, 
  i have similar approach - putting on my imaginary set of blinders . 
  my problem is that i fear i am too young for that ( twenties ) . 
  people around me are living and partying and i am sitting in my imaginary bubble . 
  trying to step out of it is sometimes so hard i just ca n't make it . 
  do n't you feel sometimes that this `` getting to be more interesting '' is kinda being forced ? 
  i think that you really need to like doing that , or does this fake it till you make it applies here as well ? 
  is there any difference between ios and pc versions apart from 3 $ ?

  what standpoint are you thinking ? 
  they say that regret hurts more than rejection . 
  when you will see her again , do n't wait . 
  waiting makes you think , it makes you looking for excuses like that . 
  sometimes a simple google search may help you find a report . 
  i guess banks publish them as part of promoting themselves . 
  for search i typically include a name of the company , `` initiation of coverage '' or `` equity research '' as a keywords and `` filetype : pdf '' to look only for pdf files .

  i feel these are questionable to some extent since you can either treat them as pronunciation errors or as `` czech accent '' . 
  using english as basically the second language in my job i think it 's not really about speaking . 
  you meet lots of non-native speakers ( more frequently than natives , at least in for me ) and they bring their own set of pronunciation errors , accents whatever . 
  if i can have suggestion for a next video you should look into articles . 
  i ca n't figure these stupid things after 15 years of english . 
  it 's like i can hear him humming some tune ...

  go ahead and get drunk .
