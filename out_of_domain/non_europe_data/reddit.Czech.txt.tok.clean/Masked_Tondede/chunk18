  is their effectivness calculated somehow based on the prevalent spoken language ? 
  if someone speaks several languages , is the communication barrier bridged , or is an interpreter necessary for that ? 
  what about troublemakers and diplomats ? 
  does one diplomat negate all troublemakers of all types in an unit ? 
  and does the troublemaker have to share a language with the harasser/violent/unsanitary person ? 
  i 'm just really frustrated with the effectiveness of my medical and r&d unit . 
  i have been trying to get tranq rifle forever since i am unable to use tranq gun effectively enough , especially since some enemies now wear helmets . 
  people i have asked have been talking about how they got it early on , but i just somehow suck . 
  should i kick my d  personell and go on a headhunt or something ? 
  i am kinda partial to not kicking anyone unless they cause a mess and i have no diplomats to counter . 
  i feel like i am sinking ton of time into the game and getting nowhere . 
  it 's frustrating ... 
  maybe it has been brought before , but lion 's mane and pink diamond hair is both drawn in a very distinct , five tip star fashion , and they share the same color . 
  there had been theories lion could be corrupted pink diamond or her pearl , but lion was always too small to be pink diamond . 
  now that we know rose had several lions , is it a plausible theory that each of them are in fact a shard of pink diamond ?

  i just bought a refurbished toshiba r930 , since i am going to be working abroad in dresden . 
  it 's the i7 variant , which is definitely a pro for mmos , but the graphics are still hd 4000 , a huge downgrade from my gaming rig . 
  i would still however like to return to mmos sometimes , as mmos have helped me with languages more than anything . 
  so , without further ado , what good and still popular mmos can be played on it above 30 fps ? 
  out of the mmos i have played recently there are archeage , eso , gw2 , defiance , perpetuum , path of exile , the secret world and star trek online , but i 'm certainly not opposed to other suggestions  i would like to download one title , since the ssd is only 128gb in capacity and i be moving tomorrow morning . 
  unfortunately i can not download any there , due to prepaid sim internet , so this is a bit urgent . 
  i have been toying with the idea of building an external gpu , more as an enthusiast than actually expecting it to do much . 
  i have a porteg\u00e9 930-14x that i bought refurbished for approximately 481 eur ( i needed a computer for my stay in germany and did n't have enough space in my shared room to bring my desktop ) , and have so far been fairly satisfied with it . 
  of course , intel graphics 4000 are rather antiquated by modern standards , so any way to expand the repertoire of games i can play here is welcome , especially since i can not stream games from my home desktop , since my data is fup limited . 
  anyways , for the purpose of connection , i have originally considered the expresscard slot that , despite bottlenecking pci-e graphics cards , have bought decent enough egpu results to other people . 
  however , today i became interested in alternative uses of the docking port connection , and i have been thinking that since it can handle two usb 3.0 devices at the same time , i assume the bandwidth is impressive . 
  so assuming i can get an old docking port from ebay ( has the connector remained unchanged between i and ii models ? ), 
  tl ; dr : would it even be possible to make this into a bit of an electronics project and use the docking slot as a pci alternative for my external graphics card ? 
  i bought a refurbished toshiba r930-14x recently before my move to germany and i have been fairly satisfied with it . 
  however , i have been toying with the idea of an external gpu through its expresscard ( more as an enthusiast project , but the result i have seen from similar project have looked promising enough ) and have been wondering if there was a point of dimnishing returns there was no purpose to go above . 
  for example , i think the limit for transfer through expresscard is 1gb or something in the version my laptop has , so would it make no sense to buy a card with above 1gb vram ? 
  and wanting to buy a low to mid end card for this project , is there a point in performance which is not worth going above due to the expresscard bottlenecking ? 
  i am wondering if the port replicator connector would be usable for this . 
  i mean , if it can connect two usb 3.0 devices the same time , the bandwidth must be decent , and it has a considerable number of pins , too .

  i had been using an old 550ti i bought to test out egpus , using an expresscard interface with my likewise old refurbished ivy bridge i7 intel hd4000 laptop ( i moved to dresden and needed a laptop to work at and my pc would n't fit in my tiny shared room . 
  also i 'm poor ) . 
  i 'm fairly satisfied with the setup , most of the games i play are discounted steam games anyways and i can play most of the stuff on at least low and 30fps ( i can hear you cringing ) . 
  however since i have a 50 eur video card now , i had been thinking of overclocking the thing , which i have never done before and i suppose now would be a decent time to experiment . 
  i wanted to make a case for the egpu looking like a stasis pod , since i 'm good with my hands and fill it with mineral oil , maybe add some leds or dye it very slight blue . 
  however there are a couple things i am unsure about, 
  1 . gpu fans - since it 's submersion cooling , will i need them anymore ? 
  it would be kinda cool to look at an exposed card . 
  or should i keep the passive aluminium part on at least ? 
  pumps , how many litres per hour ? 
  i assume i pump from the top into the bottom through the radiator ? 
  radiator , do i make one myself ? 
  what should it be like ? 
  should the fans suck the air out of it or blow it into it ? 
  how would i power the fans and the pump ? 
  can i use the psu somehow ? 
  i 'm using one of these beast adapters they sell at gearbest and dealextreme . 
  5 . what exact oil do i use , liquid paraffin ? 
  does it have to be pure ? 
  thanks for any answers , cheers !,

  i 'm sorry the inquiry is more about mechanics , but it seems the appropriate vw minibus board is kinda dead , so i thought you guys might know . 
  i recently fell in love with the volkswagen t3 's rear engine goodness while visiting croatia . 
  apparently their army had these syncro ones and i really love them , but they refuse to sell them to civilians due to their laws , so they 're going to scrapyards ( i know ) . 
  i looked around a bit and found that they were very expensive for what they are now , and i could n't find any vans with rear engines . 
  so i decided i would make it into my own project , getting inspiration from those pickups with engines in the back people have made for drag racing . 
  thing is while those are pretty much always seem to be cooled by the surrounding air , i am not sure how the t3 system works - is the radiator at the front and the radiator tubes just extended ? 
  how would the fan work then - or is the radiator fanless ? 
  so , what i 'm asking it , can someone please give me a quick rundown of how the whole system works ? 
  i feel like i should know , but i never fiddled much with cooling system , and never with a rear mounted engine . 
  thanks !, 
  i hope my post made at least some sense . 
  so i 'm not that tall , compared to the other men on this subreddit , though i do think there are times i felt shorter . 
  the `` not enough leg room in planes and buses '' is something that 's pretty well known , but have you have something one might not expect or you think is worth pinpointing that makes you wish you were shorter ?
