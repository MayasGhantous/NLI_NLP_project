  but thanks !, 
  for those of you wondering what that ugly-ass building beside it is ( cuz ' i was ) , it 's the beijing television cultural centre , destroyed by a [ fire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beijing_television_cultural_center_fire ) in 2009 . 
  how about ... hey johnny marr , do you get tired of people asking you about morrissey ? 
  cuz you know ... it was * over 20 years ago * !, 
  i find wetwebmedia.com to be a great source . 
  it 's mostly fish & aquarium stuff , but there are a lot of entries aimed at turtle issues , environments , etc. 
  they also answer questions in a prompt and friendly manner ( at least in my case they did ) . 
  happened in at least 3 instances . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europa_%28mythology%29#abduction ) , [ 2 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leda_and_the_swan ) , and [ 3 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dana%c3%ab ) . 
  ( not sure if that last one was actually a `` rape '' ... but alas . ), 
  i see . 
  you 're commenting on the initial post , whereas i was commenting on the zeus chart . 
  confusion . 
  my bad . 
  i think that 's what he wants the internet to believe anyway . 
  indeed i am !, 
  ignore what ? 
  oh yeah , i totally forgot about that mikes !, 
  maybe i 'll check it out . 
  if not , miss villeray it is . 
  thanks !, 
  and i 'd feel bad bringing my own booze to il motore of all places . 
  i 've seen a few good shows there , and i 'd like to support them as much as possible . 
  cheers !, 
  and see you tonight ? 
  ( in that way that i wo n't see you or know who you are at all . 
  but i 'll know . 
  i 'll know . ), 
  the show or the game ? 
  hehe ... both were pretty intense . 
  foxygen did not disappoint , despite the lead singer 's very apparent wastedness . 
  man . 
  heheh ... 
  i think she was checking him the whole time . 
  they were all like `` is he good ? 
  is he gon na fuck this up ? 
  how ` bout now ? '', 
  heh ... good times indeed . 
  your english is great , first of all . 
  i have a mild form of scoliosis myself , and i 've been practicing yoga for the last 5 years . 
  i 've been to various physiotherapists ( for various reasons , but including for my back ) , and never once have they told me not to do yoga . 
  what they did say , however , was to be careful of what postures i do and how intensely/deeply i get into them . 
  first off , do n't do anything that you are n't ready to do . 
  this includes moving on to more advanced variations of a pose . 
  just because a good portion of the class is doing it , does n't mean you have to strain yourself to follow along . 
  listen to your body . 
  always . 
  furthermore , if you 're really concerned about whether or not you 're doing it right , talk to one of your teachers . 
  they should be able to help you before/after/during class . 
  my studio even gives private lessons . 
  it 's a bit more pricey , of course , but it might be worth your while to invest in a lesson if you 're serious about getting it right in the long term . 
  good luck !, 
  i just want to add that i love the idea of using her daily rations for training . 
  she is a puppy and , i 'm assuming , there are a lot of other things that you are trying to teach her right now , so go nuts !, 
  it 's true . 
  it 's like the instant you roll it out , they 're like `` aww hell yeah ! '', 
  she is pretty damn cute . 
  makes it all that much harder to shoo the little bugger off . 
  does your pot allow for proper drainage ? 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w995bbp.jpg ) is what they grow up to be . 
  enjoy your little bucket of floof !, 
  they just wear those for the pics ? 
  ( i really have no idea . ), 
  how is that that you 're letting it go ? 
  you came here asking for advice , and it seems like almost every post is telling you to not let it go . 
  dude , do not release it out into the wild . 
  contact your local department of flora and fauna ( or whatever it is you guys have in california ) . 
  they 'll be able to point you to a local rescue or something that will be able to relocate it . 
  thanks for your reply !, 
  i did n't even know `` all regions '' was an option . 
  and just for kicks , so you have any experience buying from the 2nd website you provided ? 
  i 'm a little uneasy about buying a 6-cd box set for $ 9.99 in ... what is that , japanese ? 
  i just want to add to the leash biting thing . 
  i volunteer at a shelter , and we get a lot of dogs doing this ( for various reasons ) . 
  what i find works well is stepping on a part of the leash ( if the leash length permits this ) , then dropping it and turning completely around , crossing your arms as you turn your back to the dog . 
  often the dog will play `` tug '' for a bit on his own , but since he 's not getting any reaction from you , he 'll eventually get bored and drop it ( i 've had dogs do this almost immediately , and i 've had dogs chew on the leash for a good couple of minutes before getting bored ) . 
  as soon as the dog drops the leash , you can click/praise and then reward him . 
  note that as soon as you pick the leash back up , he might want to start all over . 
  in this case , you start all over as well . 
  he 'll eventually learn that getting your attention and praise / a treat / continuing with the walk is much more rewarding than tugging at the leash . 
  you can also try giving him a toy to put in his mouth while he walks . 
  some dogs dig that . 
  for 6-dvd box set ? 
  low . 
  as a girlfriend , i would totally be into this . 
  if you check the rds website regularly , you can find clips from the show way before they are edited and put into the broadcast . 
  i saw the ryder thing a few days after he was traded ; it was a lot longer too . 
  i agree that it would be nice to have it on a weekly basis though . 
  i 'm not sure why you 're getting downvoted ; you make some valid points . 
  i 'd just like to add that instead of ignoring them , she should 've told them to shut the fuck up . 
  ( it 's kinda like when you 're at the movies and some jerks behind you just ca n't shut up or stop kicking your seat ... they 're never gon na stop if you do n't speak up ... tweeting about it just seems like a passive aggressive way to handle the situation . ), 
  do you mean rooney ? 
  cuz ' otherwise i totally do n't get the reference . 
  nevermind . 
  i am neverminding myself . 
  ... although , those short legs ... 
  i nonchalantly want to go to there . 
  i just wan na say ... `` portable heater technician '' ? 
  gold . 
  not to be a downer here , but do you think he actually enjoys that ?
