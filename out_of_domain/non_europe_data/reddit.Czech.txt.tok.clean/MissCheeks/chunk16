  i make mine in a similar way . 
  use a whisk to stir ; it 's more effective and makes the milk ( very slightly ) frothier . 
  scrofuloid : any reason why you specify `` non-dutch '' ? 
  i 've never really heard that . 
  how do i know whether or not my cocoa is dutch ? 
  nice . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  i 'll try the natural stuff next time . 
  i 've always bought fry 's ( which i think is cadbury ) just because i did n't think there to be a. . . well , anything else really . 
  cheers !, 
  have you trained him using a clicker or some similar conditioning ? 
  this is a bit more complicated , but you could maybe try the [ manners minder ] ( http://www.petexpertise.com/dog-training-aids/treat-n-train-remote-dog-training.html?sef_rewrite=1 ) in a similar situation while you are at home . 
  put him in the same room upstairs ( with a webcam set up , i guess ) , and reward him for good behaviour whenever something or someone passes by . 
  if he learns to be calm in that room by himself , chances are he 'll stay calm while you 're away as well . 
  hehe ... like homer 's five o'clock shadow . 
  `` check '' is the u.s. spelling , whereas canadians and brits prefer `` cheque . '', 
  i 'd also like to add that you should reward the crap out of her the first few times she does n't herd the yorkie ( allowing her to go up the stairs first , etc. ) . 
  herding is probably much more rewarding for her than getting a simple treat , so you got ta make sure to let her know that you 're `` really happy '' that she suppresses her instinces ( so to speak ) and listens to you . 
  i , for one , welcome our new * fair and balanced * overlord . 
  hi , if you want some basic info on dog body language , check out the sidebar . 
  turid rugaas ' and dr. chin 's sketches and info are very straightforward and give you a good overview of what to look out for in your dog 's body language . 
  if you 're wondering whether or not to alter your dog 's behaviour , well ... yes and no . 
  yes , you should allow your dog to express her discomfort , but there are ways of making her more at ease in given situations . 
  your dog appears to be showing signs of stress when a new situation/person appears . 
  you can work on calming her down in such situations in a number of ways ( again , see resources in sidebar , namely regarding clicker training and bat ) . 
  while you read up on these , you can try to put your dog in another room whenever visitors arrive ( before they arrive ) , tell your visitors not to engage the dog directly ( look at her directly , try to reach out and pet her , etc. ), 
  until she has had time to come out and greet them on her own terms . 
  in the park , it 's a different story , of course , as you have less control over your environment . 
  but while you are working on your dog 's behaviour , you can try to walk your dog when there are less people around . 
  and if someone comes up to her wanting to pet her , etc. , you can even tell them that she has fleas , and that way they 'll stay away and give your dog the space she needs . 
  i 'd love to give you more advice , but it might end up in a long-winded and possibly imprecise explanation ( not being able to view the situation myself ) . 
  you 're doing the right thing by asking and by reading up on the matter . 
  and your `` calling her '' when you see her tense up is not a bad thing either ( depending on your tone ... just do n't try to be forceful or scolding when you do ) . 
  good luck !, 
  to add to this , know that your dog sniffing something = your dog using his brain = your dog doing mental exercise , which is just as important as physical exercise . 
  see the following link , under [ busy walks ] ( http://www.k9station.com/mentalstim.htm ) . 
  no kidding . 
  their [ website ] ( http://www.loukasjeans.com/ ) sucks . 
  what are you people doing that your jeans only last 6 months ? 
  thanks . 
  finally a coherent article about this ( rather than the do not feed your dog this or he will die stuff you see on facebook ) . 
  seriously , who the fuck cares . 
  this is such a non-story . 
  can i ask what you use for a basking platform ? 
  looks like some kids ' toy ... hehe . 
  i like !, 
  cute !, 
  it 's a technique that pierre herm\u00e9 uses , briefly described [ here ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/10302607/pierre-hermes-classic-ispahan-macaron-recipe.html ) . 
  apparently it causes the albumin to break down , which makes for fluffier , less grainy meringue . 
  sweet !, 
  by `` a few days old '' you mean from the date stamped on the box/eggs ? 
  also , are the whites at room temperature when you work with them ? 
  i 've never heard of making meringue without egg whites . 
  that 's a great idea ( for the curd ) ... 
  i was actually thinking of making lemon-meringue-pie type macarons for next time . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  there are tons online . 
  i used pierre herm\u00e9 's recipe for my first try ( [ this ] ( http://pia-sweet.blogspot.ca/2012/01/pierre-hermes-dark-chocolate-macarons.html ) is the most accurate translation i 've been able to find of it so far -- my book is in french ) , and they turned out amazing !, 
  do try to find [ chocolate liquor ] ( http://www.britannica.com/ebchecked/topic/113892/chocolate-liquor ) as well a high-quality chocolate for your ... well , chocolate needs . 
  makes a huge difference !, 
  also , herm\u00e9 uses a finer version of regular caster sugar ( i think it 's because it melts faster when cooked ... but perhaps it 's not that big a deal ) . 
  oh , also , put them in the middle rack of the oven . 
  you 'll likely have more macarons than cookie trays , and it 's not that big a deal if you leave some on the counter while the others are baking . 
  i tried to put mine on two different racks to optimize cooking time , but the ones further down were cracked . 
  middle of oven . 
  trust me . 
  thanks !, 
  awesome . 
  thanks so much !, 
  makes all the difference . 
   thanks anyway !, 
  this is all excellent advice . 
  i 'd also add that you could even think about replacing the rug ( if it 's not some persian woven or family heirloom or something ) . 
   as good as the enzyme cleaners may be , it could be that the smell is already ingrained in the rug and may be hard to remove entirely . 
  a good idea would be to visit the breeder 's facilities . 
  if they do n't allow that , or if they insist to meet you elsewhere , be wary . 
  craigslist and kijiji are unfortunately fertile grounds for puppy mills , backyard breeders , what have you . 
  do you know if there are any turtle rescue organizations in your area ? 
  i think he means [ proto-dog ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9tbh94fyc0 ) . 
  so this is ok while last week 's `` reminiscent '' hit on pacioretty was n't ? 
  hmm ... 
  i think it was in one of last week 's games ... or in last week 's 24ch , so the week before . 
  i 'm afraid i ca n't remember which specifically , but he was rammed up against the boards recently ... much like the chara incident but obviously not as bad . 
  read this : http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6991/125/, 
  do they actually go up that high in the winter ? 
  the only cat i 've ever seen on our balcony was the neighbour 's ( we 're on the 3rd floor as well ) . 
  it 's a lovely idea . 
  i 'd love to make one , but i 'm not sure that it would get much use . 
  i figured this out a few months ago when i bought some curry at a local spice store ( the kind of place whose owners travel far and wide to find awesome stuff ... they wrote a book about it and everything ) . 
  such a huuuuuuuuuuuge difference !, 
  i 'm never buying grocery-store spices again . 
  in fact , i 'm actually getting some `` basic '' spices ( cumin , curry , nutmeg ... ) from this place for my family for christmas . 
  definitely go for small quantity / better quality . 
  trust me . 
  the shop is called \u00c9pices de cru , in montreal . 
  i thought their books might be french-only , but apparently not !, 
  i 'd paste this all purdy if i could , but i 'm on mobile ... http://spicetrekkers.com/products-page/books/, 
  i think you can even order their spices online , but i 'm not sure ( again , mobile ) . 
  yes !, 
  heh ... had to look it up , but yeah .
