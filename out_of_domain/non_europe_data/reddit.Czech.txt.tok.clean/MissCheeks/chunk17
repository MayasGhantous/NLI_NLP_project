  i know it under \u00c9pices de cru . 
  are you ... standing behind me right now ? 
  nice !, 
  hope she makes you something awesome !, 
  yeah it 's great . 
  i agree with yousirareamouthful and llieaay ( though i do n't think you need a vet behaviourist per se ... a reliable non-punishment-based trainer should do the trick ) . 
  ideally you 'd get someone to come observe the dog in his own environment . 
  karen pryor 's website has a directory of trainers as well , so you can check that . 
  i just wanted to say to keep your dog away from kids for the time being , if you 're not already doing that . 
  good luck . 
  perhaps , but you got ta give 'em props for the title . 
  you could try posting this in r/dogcare . 
  as sirenita12 says , i 'd think about changing his diet for sure . 
  and have you tried nature 's miracle enzyme cleaner ? 
  it 's very effective ( though it might not work as well on old stains ) . 
  also , what are you doing in terms of `` disciplining '' him ? 
  scolding him for peeing might just stress him out and make the situation worse . 
  it could be that he 's old , it could be an incontinence thing too , though i assume your vet would have informed you about that if such were the case .

  if you have a link to that song , that would be awesome . 
  thanks !, 
  is your uncle a recurring character on snl 's weekend update , perchance ? 
  with my dad , it 's all about the muslims destroying the west . 
  sigh ... 
  i agree . 
  i love people who just put themselves out there like that . 
  you can tell she really loves her job . 
  i would try melting it as you suggested . 
  when i make meringue , i make a syrup with water and sugar ... cooked to 118 ( celsius ) and poured over the whipped egg whites . 
  not sure if it 'll be too warm for your cream cheese , but i 'm thinking since you do n't appear to have butter in your recipe , it might be safe ? 
  let us know how it goes !, 
  people do n't * want * dogs that `` yip all the time . '', 
  it 's a behavioural problem that certain dogs develop , mostly due to nervousness or fear . 
  humans develop similar problems as well . 
  ticks , nervous laughter , yelling , dumb comments on the internet , what have you . 
  it 's quite possible that the cat got out on its own . 
  whether she was joking or not , i personally found it kind of ridiculous that she was even asked that question . 
  i sincerely doubt that they 'd ask djokovic or murray ( them having girlfriends aside ) , after they just won a major game in their tennis career , who they 'd want to date . 
  i 'd have gone nathalie portman on their asses if it were me . 
  it 's from [ this ] ( http://vimeo.com/77383280 ) video . 
  around 2:12 ( though i recommend the entire thing , if you have n't seen it ) . 
  many `` yogis '' brag about their accomplishments in the practice ... 
  not to be rude , but is n't that what this subreddit is all about ? 
  i know it 's not meant to be , but i find that a good 60 % of the posts on r/yoga are `` look what i can do '' posts . 
  it 's very off-putting . 
  and i totally agree with your commercialisation comment . 
  that 's cool that you can find inspiration in those . 
  i do n't , however . 
  i just roll my eyes and go `` ugh , this is n't facebook '' . 
  it 's kinda the same reason i unsubscribed from r/twoxchromosomes . 
  it was more of a `` look at my new hair/clothes/weight / make-up '' subreddit than a `` let 's talk about girl things '' one . 
  i came to r/yoga thinking i 'd find interesting articles , new ways to look at your practice , etc. 
  ... but instead i get `` here 's me on a beach doing crow pose on a rock '' . 
  you guys all need to chill the fuck out . 
  have you tried yoga ? 
  what exactly do you mean by `` unpredictable '' ? 
  often when dogs react aggressively , they gave off many [ distress clues ] ( http://www.maplewooddog.com/mdt/resources/articles/communication-handling-articles/mdt-canine-stress-signals.jpg ) that the average joe simply does n't know about . 
  this is kinda like the dog saying `` ok dude , i 'm not comfortable with this ... ok dude , please back off ... dude , seriously ... 
  dude ! '', 
  it 's quite rare that this `` comes out of nowhere , '' as you say . 
  a lot of people are ignorant about canine body language , and this is often what leads to bites , regardless of the breed of dog . 
  i just wan na say that it 's nice to come here and read reasonable comments , rather than the `` baby-eating pit '' vs `` yappy lap dog '' bs that 's going on on the front page right now . 
  ( re : [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1wa5sq/til_according_to_a_2008_study_published_in_the/ ) ), 
  yup . 
  and the number of upvotes to things like `` you should kick that fuckin ' yappy dog '' were just appalling . 
  thanks so much . 
  i was n't aware of either of those brands , so i 'll for sure check them out . 
  let 's hope rich delivers to canada . 
  that 's the thing though . 
  it would be very rare that a dog a ) has a `` well-documented '' history of aggression ( often , especially in the case of shelter dogs , the animal 's history , and definitely the genetic history , is unknown ) , and b ) that parents would keep said dog around their children . 
  that being said , i absolutely agree that you should not keep an aggressive dog around kids . 
  furthermore , there are lots of great pits who grow up in families with children , and there are lots of children who get bitten by non-pits ( i myself got bitten by our family dog when i was little - a collie ) . 
  i will . 
  thanks again . 
  thanks !, 
  i think it might be a bit too much for my needs , but i 'll keep it in mind for sure . 
  i fully agree . 
  not all dogs were properly socialized with others so as to pick up such behaviour . 
  but this is not a majority of cases . 
  and it 's unfair to define an entire breed based on a few of those . 
  good on you for keeping an eye on your mutt . 
  nice . 
  good to know that it 's been solid so far . 
  thanks . 
  well this is awkward :, 
  this . 
  jack russells are very high energy , and if you do n't give them stuff to do , they 'll find it themselves . 
  same goes for a lot of working dog breeds , for that matter . 
  also , please do n't think that your having another dog ( i.e. 
  your ridgeback ) will provide for your new dog 's exercise needs . 
  sure , they may play together . 
  but they may not . 
  ( i 'm not saying you assume this or anything , as you seem well-informed and considerate in general ... 
  i just wanted to put it out there ) . 
  if you are going the adoption route , i 'd go visit a shelter and talk to the adoption folk . 
  they evaluate dogs based on their personalities ( this includes how comfortable they are with other dogs and cats ) , so you can add that to the knowledge you already have of their breed ( breeders , btw , will * generally * give you overall breed and lineage info , rather than this-specific-dog info ) . 
  yeah , it 's hard to say . 
  i have a friend who 's had two jacks , and they never had any problems with her cats . 
  then again , i do n't wan na give you advice based on anecdotal evidence . 
   the trainer in me says `` be careful ... put all the odds on your side . '',
