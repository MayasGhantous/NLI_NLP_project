  quintessential czechness : `` not that we 'd take the initiative ... but you know ... if they asked us , we are technically able to do so . '', 
  there 's always the option of making a smaller cake ( use 1/2 the recipe and a smaller mould ) . 
  love it !, 
  thank you so much !, 
  nice ... 
  i remember some of those , but i do n't think i ever heard hej , taste . 
  great though !, 
  thanks for the wiki link . 
  i was n't aware of it . 
  rottrova has a ton of covers , i just realized . 
  this album alone ... 
  totally dishonest !, 
  that 's the beauty of it !, 
  sweet , thanks !, 
  i 'm gon na be that girl . 
  umm ... should n't you guys be wearing hairnets ? 
  or have your hair at least tied back ? 
  we 're no longer with duproprio . 
  if you 're interested , i could send you our agent 's listing . 
  let me know . 
  i discovered that a couple of years ago , and it 's about the only `` buttercream '' frosting i make ( except when i make [ this cake ] ( http://www.marthastewart.com/282535/caramelized-apple-spice-cake ) ) . 
  it 's so fluffy i 'm gon na die . 
  do n't put your fingers in front of your turtle 's face . 
  serious . 
  i know i sound overly bitchy , but it 's as simple as that . 
  do not dangle your fingers in front of your turtle 's face . 
  i 've had mine for over 20 years , and she 'd still snap at my finger if i gave her a chance . 
  so just be careful . 
  and tell others to do the same . 
  wtf !, 
  hahaha ... thanks , man !, 
  cheers and happy good times unto you !, 
  sounds to me like the error is on the writer 's side . 
  ( from what i can tell , the `` we only mail out ... '' contradicts the `` sorry '' and the `` we can not ship '' ) . 
  are you familiar with ... montreal ? 
  l'\u00c9curie is a horrible bar . 
  i asked this question a few months ago . 
  [ the post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/volleyball/comments/1kqxhc/volleyball_shoe_recommendations/ ) , if you 're interested . 
  as for myself , i ended up buying the [ asics volleycross ] ( http://www.asicsamerica.com/shop/footwear/volleyball/womens/gel-volleycross%c2%ae-revolution/p/0010171582.9097 ) . 
  really happy with it , though i find that sometimes it makes my foot hurt ( i think it was n't / is n't used to all that support , frankly ) . 
  i think it 's funny that he 'd point out their ugliness . 
  i mean ... my friends and i point it out all the time , but i figured that was just because we 're girls . 
  anyway , they 're fuckin ' ugly . 
  as kingrattus said , i doubt it 's eggs you 're seeing . 
  even vets have trouble determining how many eggs a turtle is carrying without an x-ray . 
  mine sometimes goes days between eggs . 
  and there have been times when we thought she was all done , only to find an egg or two popped out a week or so later . 
  i 'm not sure what too-long-between eggs is , however . 
  monitor her behaviour closely , and if you see her getting overly vegetative , take her to a vet . 
  this . 
  so much . 
  i 'm all about supporting the original designer ... except when he says '' i for one am looking forward to seeing weise get destroyed by the freight train that is , milan lucic . '', 
  have you seen any morels yet ? 
  i 'm in the montreal area , and wondering when would be a good time to go out and about . 
  sweet !, 
  i 'll carpe diem that shit up !, 
  yeah !, 
  and the rang ... oh ... 
  hi there . 
  would you mind clarifying your question ( s ) , please ? 
  i 'm not sure i get what the problem is . 
  your dog `` started being less ready to go '' with the walker . 
  what does this mean exactly ? 
  how is the behaviour different now in comparison to before ? 
  does the dog show signs of fear when the walker approaches him ? 
  you say that the dog seems to trust and like the walker , so what exactly is the problem ? 
  and what exactly do you mean by `` being more strict about him spending time alone '' ? 
  yup . 
  like u/yousirareamouthful said , i 'd be curious to know whether something may have gone awry on one of your dog 's walks , or whether the walker might be using some form of punishment for the dogs ( yanking leashes , yelling , cesar-milan-type `` tssts '' , etc. ) . 
  if you can , try to be there next time the walker comes to greet the dog and take a close look at your dog 's body language ( the signals that u/yousirareamouthful listed , or have a look at the sidebar for more references on `` calming signals '' if you are unfamiliar with them ) . 
  most dogs would be ecstatic to see the walker come in , as that means they get to go outside !, 
  do n't hesitate to ask your walker any questions about previous walks or about her methods ... 
  i mean , frig , that 's what you pay her for , right ? 
  plus , if there have been reactivity issues in the past , it could be that something came up in recent times that may have reminded your dog of his past fears . 
  also , in regard to your other questions , i do n't think it 's a bad thing to let your dog loose in the house when you 're around . 
  that being said , it 's not wrong to give him some alone time either . 
  if he 's fine in his closed-off space and does n't whine to see you , then great . 
  give him some treats , toys , a stuffed kong , whatever , and let him chill out while you work . 
  if he does whine to be let out , then you might want to work on that a bit ( but i suppose that would be for another post ) . 
  mine 's been going all sorts of crazy lately to get out of her tank as well . 
  is she fertile ? 
  might be she 's looking for a place to lay eggs . 
  do you have a setup for her where she can bury them ? 
  yes . 
  source : i used to volunteer there . 
  to add to that , i think a lot of people err in thinking that dominance is a behavioural trait . 
  like ... `` that dog is a dominant dog '' type thing . 
  dominance and submission are entirely dependant upon the situation the dog finds himself in at a particular time . 
  my in-laws had their dog assessed as a puppy . 
  the `` specialist '' identified him as a submissive dog . 
  i silently cringe every time they mention that to someone . 
  get a new lamp and [ this ] ( http://zoomed.com/db/products/entrydetail.php?entryid=109&amp;databaseid=2&amp;searchid=5 ) . 
  ( and bill your friend for it ) , 
  the adoptions dept. 
  in general can get rather busy . 
  there 's no specific lineup for cats or dogs . 
  that being said , they 'll probably anticipate more people coming in and thus have more on staff to help . 
  easy there , tiger . 
  this looks like it should be in a silent film from the 20 's . 
  get a book on ( edible ) mushrooms in your area , and learn to identify a few ... you do n't need to know all there is to know , just make sure to be able to distinguish edible from non-edible or poisonous ones .
