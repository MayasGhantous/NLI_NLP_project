  do n't think it 's military secrets or anything . 
  the ship it was recovered from was a civilian ship after all . 
  even if the owner of that ship was in the military , he 'd have to be really dumb to carry that kind of thing with him everywhere . 
  it 's actually a recording of some alien guy talking . 
  we did n't know what to think of it at first . 
  the guy always talks for a bit and then these peculiar sounds interrupt him . 
  we eventually figured out what those sounds are , though . 
  it 's the audience laughing . 
  these guys really do laugh weird , i got ta say . 
  so yeah . 
  it 's a stand-up comedy special . 
  did n't even know they had them . 
  well , i think i like the guys a bit more now . 
  i just remembered a joke the audience loved . 
  wait 'till you hear this . 
  it goes something like : `` i heard that a human shuttle landed on planet rihg yesterday . '', 
  the audience absolutely lost it . 
  i wonder if it 's still gon na be funny once they figure out why that ship crashed . 
  as much as i want leo to win , it 's gon na be eddie redmayne . 
  first `` song '' i heard was 5d off of exmilitary . 
  that made me want to know the context in which the song appears , so i listened to the album . 
  by the time the lyrics on beware started , i was hooked . 
  what 's the best way to learn the names of moves/learn what specific moves are called ? 
  for example , i keep hearing names like `` ddt '' and `` hurricanrana '' but i am unable to pair those names with moves . 
  that seems like it would be super helpful . 
  i thought of a way to translate it . 
  \u0164hodoni\u0159 !, 
  hodoni\u0159 !, 
  hodo\u0159 !, 
  hodor !, 
  firefly train ? 
  that could work . 
  oh my god , you guys , i just experienced an me !, 
  so like , look at the map op posted and tell me you remember those states between minnesota and new york from your childhood . 
  when i was a kid , there were some lakes in their place , but now there are states ?? 
  2 days donation for / r/millionairemakers, 
  great job , as always . 
  kinda sad to see what state wcw was in during this time . 
  at least they got better , though . 
  `` here 's my phone number , so if you could just put that on my arm ... '', 
  come on , seth !, 
  okay , that 's got ta be the pin . 
  i caught this ppv by complete accident . 
  now i 'm glad i did . 
  `` charlotte is thirteen ... '', 
  woah , she definitely looks way older than that . 
  `` not meant to bend that way ! '', 
  there it is again . 
  i predict at least **** for rollins/owens . 
  my great great grandmother franti\u0161ka gave birth to a son on april 21st , 1899 . 
  unfortunately , franti\u0161ka was not yet married . 
  when her son josef was three years old , she married a 59-year old man farmer and had a son by him not even a full year later . 
  josef officially had no father but the old farmer is actually stated as the boy 's father in his birth record . 
  it even states that the farmer came forward as the father and married franti\u0161ka . 
  however , someone blotted out the entire thing . 
  the boy officially had no father and he was officially not the farmer 's son . 
  about 24 years later and 36 kilometers away from josef 's birthtown , josef married a woman named and\u011bla . 
  they had a son soon after and they named him old\u0159ich . 
  meanwhile , franti\u0161ka and the farmer 's son had also grown up and married . 
  from his marriage came a girl named marie . 
  old\u0159ich and marie eventually met , married , and had children . 
  these were my grandparents from my mother 's side . 
  who knows whether they ever found out they 're cousins ? 
  definitely buy now . 
  once robbie rotten 's gofundme reaches its goal , be prepared to sell . 
  that 's the one !, 
  thanks . 
  continue translating, 
  spend more time with my friends, 
  okay . 
  so this used to be my favorite dg album . 
  honestly , i did n't even like it on my first listen-through . 
  i listened to my dg albums chronologically , so i was still fresh off an exmilitary-induced high and i just was n't feeling money store . 
  every track sounded the same to me . 
  it was on my second listen-through that i started liking the album . 
  i think it became my favorite album on my third listen-through . 
  the sheer intensity of just about every beat on the album just clicked with me . 
  that 's what i still like about tms . 
  it 's intense but it 's also accessible . 
  however , the whole accessibility business is a bit of a double-edged sword , really . 
  i do n't really like to recommend tms as the first dg to listen to because i 'm afraid people would n't be able to go back to exmilitary after that . 
  tms has since been replaced by nldw as my favorite dg album but i still like it a lot . 
  i think i 'm starting to grow a bit tired of it , though . 
  longitudinal data . 
  also , sudden cardiac arrest . 
  sadly , no . 
  not this one , either . 
  nevermind , i just found it . 
  it was time table .

  : - ) all-around amazing episode . 
  really glad cooper 's back . 
  also happy that `` diane was manufactured '' theory was true . 
  curious to see how they wrap this all up/what happens with audrey . 
  so i recently rewatched jon 's nightshade video and i was almost hypnotized by the ending . 
  could anybody tell me where the music ( you know , the music ) is from ? 
  here 's a link in case you do n't know what i 'm talking about : http://youtu.be/aq7rhn3h1m0?t=10m20s,
