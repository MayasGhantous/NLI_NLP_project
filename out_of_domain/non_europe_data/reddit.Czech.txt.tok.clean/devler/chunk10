  that one person with 21k + ap might be a troll . 
  or might not , who knows . 
  let 's see ... 
  march 25 , 2014 : introducing the wardrobe system, 
  march 25 , 2014 : big increase in / r/guildwarsdyejob activity , biggest since last year, 
  we 'll see how much more popular it 'll get after tomorrow , 
  yeah that was my mistake sorry for that , fixed that now , 
  have an upvote for this discovery sir !, 
  [ it 's the same every time ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1a3ug8/and_yet_i_still_do_it_in_every_rpg/ ) :d, 
  have you played mafia i or ii ? 
  you must give it a chance , those are amazing games !, 
  so . . will the new pvp map be included in this patch ? 
  i suppose that since there 's the new wardrobe and acc bound dyes system , this subreddit will be much more active from now on so you might get better/faster help there then , 
  but they are n't . 
  where are my devil horns ? 
  got it , thanks !, 
  only the personality indicator in hero panel got removed , the personality dialogues in some chats with npc are still there though , 
  i do n't see why they removed it . 
  i think it was a great thing for players who have trouble speaking english . 
  even if it does n't matter in characters progression , the player could have feeling that he 's a bad guy or a good guy . 
  and those with bad english who could n't understand the lines could at least have an idea if the answer is nice or not , 
  go and ask in map chat/whisper people there is the only way i think , 
  do n't post this to gw2 forums though  petitions are not allowed there , you would get an infraction point , 
  i actually love that new players are playing spvp now . 
  free kills for me . 
  where did you get so many charges ? 
  88 chinese yuan = 14.152424 u.s. dollars, 
  i barely see a difference in some extremely low population zones like timberline falls . 
  right before the patch hit ? 
  why you just did n't wait for it ? 
  necromancers are overpowered . 
  if you 're going to do daily gatherer ( which is now not even daily , but it 's on rotation ) , it will take several years to make it worth  people buy it only because it 's unlimited use ( more comfort yay ) and nice animation . 
  i guess that they planned zhaitan to be much bigger , i do n't know why they made him so small . 
  i hope mordremoth wo n't disappoint us .

  `` both teams are victorious ! '', 
  not really , what does the annoucer says when it 's a tie ? 
  this is a pretty common bug so i guess that developers are aware of this . 
  you ca n't do anything about it though , just wait for it to be fixed . 
  i 've played since release and my size of gw2.dat is 18,1 gb so i do n't really mind those 200 mb , not worth downloading it again imo , 
  but i 've seen some people claiming their gw2.dat is 21 gb + , in that case it 's reasonable . 
  they could have just scale down amount of skins you 're given and keep it that way . 
  i understand that skins are basically more worth now than before because they can be used in pve/wvw/pvp , but removing them is not a wise choice . 
  now the achievement chests do n't feel rewarding anymore . 
  ewwww, 
  put it in forge , post result !, 
  image is removed , but . . [ it still shows ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4xedxed.png ) how barney and robin 's relationship felt . 
  like a cucumber . 
  if i use white color , do this produce enough light ? 
  and doom, 
  healing signet still meta , perfect !, 
  damn it !, 
  for europe it 's $ 19,99 without expansion , $ 24,99 with . 
  still not a bad price though . 
  when i use american vpn , it really shows the prices you 're telling us about . 
  not sure if you can buy it this way , 
  is n't that more of a problem from bethesda than zenimax ? 
  like ncsoft do n't really talk about gw2 , they 're just a publisher . 
  correct me if i am wrong . 
  oh ok thanks for clarifying , 
  since wvw is half pve according to anet , i do n't think there will be any chages to map completion in wvw . 
  it has already been suggested many times and anet still does n't want to do anything with it . 
  so now , i think that anet does n't have any intensions of changing this system . 
  but i do believe that at some point ( e.g. 
  feature patch 2 - wvw map completion changes , party leader instance kicking fixed , save builds ? ), 
  this will change . 
  however , anet has some other things to do right now , 
  you have few options to do : wait for tournament to end , ask nicely in map chat if you could cap some objective if it 's possible or command by yourself when there 's no other commander ( possibly on late night/early morning ) . 
  oh man , this must be some kind of next gen super duperhd . 
   40.001g-80 .000 g - 4 votes ( 1 % ), 
  teach me !, 
  fiy , your hourly wages start to decuple the amount of money you can make farming very easily . 
  someone already did the math and you would be surprised that basically any job is more worth than farming . 
  this construction reminds me of mirror 's edge . 
  we 're assuming that you already have a job that covers your costs . 
  you do n't farm gold in your working hours ( but if you do , i envy ) . 
  you do it in your free time , so you would get instead of free time another job from which you would pay for the gems . 
  well , now , 74 people claim that they have more than 80.00 g. 
  that is mathematically very unlikely . 
  plains of ashford , caledon forrest , queensdale , wayfarer foothills left . 
  so these starting maps will be the last who gets megaserver , 
  metrica province already in system . 
  kate welch was/is in charge of the new ui , 
  therefore all servers are now megaservers ? 
  that 's cool !, 
  oh i 'm sorry , edited kind of , 
  then it 's not pentagram but pentacle , 
  please no more soon \u2122 , i would rather hear `` in next few months , in second half of the year , in less than month '' . 
  i hate `` soon '' . 
  agree with you , but i also liked the combat mechanics of knights/hologram fight . 
  i always thought they had been harder and they made them a lot easier , but that might be only because i was n't well geared and experienced by then , 
  yeah that seems logic . 
  i 've always thought that dragons are , well , stupid , not very mentally developed , like other animals . 
  but since i 've watched the hobbit , i admit that they can actually be pretty smart . 
  how smart are gw2 dragons , can they communicate between themselves etc ? 
  do they have a language or do they just use telepathy to communicate ( basically what mordremoth did to ceara ) ? 
  if i would live in a location where hurricanes or tornados are , i would fear them rather than respect , but i get your point .
