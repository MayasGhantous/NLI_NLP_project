  might makes me right !, 
  am i the only one who have read that wrong ? 
  a buff icon where boons are is basically non visible during most of the fight , at least for me . 
  if there was a combo field indicator , i would do it much bigger . 
  [ my vision made in photoshop , fire field ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dxvr4jq.jpg ), 
  i use # 14 every time i make a strawberry milkshake , it 's a really good tip , 
  how 's that a lifehack may i ask you ? 
   thanks , and we 'll see you all ( literally ) in game !, 
  all ? 
  literally ? 
  what happened to cows ? 
  it 's just like a cape sea . 
  dorgeshuun already have some sort of electricity . 
  yea , teleporter as some super-rare/expensive device , the only logic way how it would fit into lore . 
  ^ my ^ crotch ... 
  but seriously , build saving and party leader leaving instance fix i need the most . 
  not really a map area , but more like area of game which needs to get some love . 
  and when it comes to map area , timberline falls is such a beautiful map , with basically nothing in it :(, 
  since the gear is unificated i do n't believe this will be fixed . 
  here be penguins, 
  [ suddenly pineapples ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcj6kbk25ng ), 
  my favourite one will always be the one where they sing [ aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiioooooooooooooooon !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atuwjorryfm ), 
  pc ( steam ) . 
  perspective ( http://www.seewithperspective.com ) is pretty good . 
  gear is now unificated in both pve and pvp . 
  only way to get skins now from pve is through reward tracks , otherwise you need to get them from pve , 
  i have more than enough money to buy every trait i want , but this is really bad system , especially for new players . 
  some classes are very underpowered without some traits and now they need to wait much longer to get them and even after that they need to for example finish frostgorge map . 
  this is just ridiculous . 
  i do n't want to wait another year to get this . 
  ( assuming feature pack will be after next living story which i assume will take a year ), 
  they really said that ? 
  i will fuc * ing love anet if they 'll do it this way !, 
  i just hope this is an example and you 're not going to buy this simply because one reason , if anyone here answers you yes buy it , you will not be the single one person who will see it . 
  asura power, 
  they gave you free gems so you could try gem store on your own  no credit cards needed, 
  will be fixed soon i guess . 
  it 's the [ spoiler ] ( #s `` mistlock observatory '' ) !, 
  introduce new inventory option for qol items like you 've said . 
  very own inventory slot ( ofc separated from rest of inventory ) for those items which is account wide . 
  buy it at gemstore for 2000 gems , 
  and if you have a snapback hat these days , you are officialy 60 % more swaggish . 
  expect next update after end of spring tournament/release in china . 
  you 'll probably see a preview page in may or maybe even in june . 
  we 'll either get sab , dragon bash or start of ls year 2 . 
  i 'd like to see this from doom perspective too  also would be actually cool and interesting if we could hear what you 're saying , 
  i enjoyed the first a lot , but the second one was too hardcore for me as i 'm not that hardcore player . 
  well i thought that at first too , but they spam the chat too much . 
  i do n't need to know which boss is up every 5 seconds ... 
  oh my god this looks so much like my main warrior girl . 
  it 's fun for you , embarrassment for enemies you 've just killed . 
  fashion collector !, 
  i was just talking about this yesterday in vigil keep . . 
  i wonder the same thing ... 
  you 've just read the thread about / finishers did n't you ? 
  man i 'm not sure if i should downvote this . . 
  i do n't want ag players to take the wvw part seriously :d, 
  but for making me laugh , have an upvote sir !, 
  happened like 10 seconds ago to my party mate . 
  it has . 
  pvp and wvw nowadays in a nutshell : llamas . . llamas everywhere, 
  this needs to be added to the [ agony wiki page ] ( http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/agony ) sir !, 
   good job !, 
  they have a finisher ? 
  disassemble your graphics card and clean it from dust . 
  also clean your fans and whole inside of the case . 
  do it at least once in 6 months and your computer will sound like a mouse - quiet . 
  no one is named runescape :(, 
  uhm could someone explain the first one to me ? 
  i do n't really get what 's happening . 
  he just respawned at grim reaper 's office . 
  [ this is the fastest way to acquire skillpoints ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zujm1ipy-ka ), 
  i 've played runescape for 7 years . . the same month i started playing gw , i quit playing runescape . 
  there was a conflict between autobots and decepticons . 
  those western countries . . 
  if i have an income of $ 18,000 / year i 'm happy , also because it would be 3x bigger than the average income in my country . 
  this is because of a beta event where shatterer flew to plains of ashford and basically all waypoints were contested . 
  looks very leauge of legends-ish  especially the elementalist, 
  however it 's amazing !, 
  personally i 'm from czech republic but i can assume that every state which is south and/or east from germany does have an average income like this . 
  for comparsion , average apartment rent here is about $ 350-600 per month , i know that for example usa have bigger living expenses , but they are still doing better . 
  personally i usually ca n't multitask that much when commanding , but i like this idea , finally some innovative app , 
  it would be much better if you would have written this in html so it could be compataible with both pc and phones , because i 'd like this app much better on second lcd screen than on that little phone display ,

  well yeah you 're right , 
  i love those !, 
  does anyone have more reddit runescape references ? 
  what i have :, 
  mounts confirmed . 
  definitely eotm . 
  i have one bonus question , i think that wvw is very color-unbalanced . 
  which color has the best structure ( is more viable ) in eb/eotm ? 
  my opinion ( best to worst ) :, 
  eotm : red/blue  green, 
  eb : green  blue  red, 
  might be a coincidence but like 95 % of women i 've played with used scissors as their first move . 
  especially on meth . 
  yes yes please , i wan na hear chinese commander yelling \u6808 \uff0c \u6808 \uff0c \u6808 so bad !,
