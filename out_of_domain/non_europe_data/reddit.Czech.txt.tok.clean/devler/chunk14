  is there a subreddit for things like this ? 
  pen is, 
  what 's wrong with spirit watch ? 
  any idea if a program like this exists ? 
  my personal thanks for every aurora glade commander and also to every single person who participated in wvw . 
  thanks !, 
  the worst thing is that if you build a pedestrian path there , they will ignore it . 
  i just wanted to thanks ring of fail for being amazing lootbags when you tried to take hills on your bl like dozen times from us this matchup . 
  300 tickets ? 
  i am gon na get 300 tickets ? 
  yay , mistforged hero greatsword here i come !, 
  like we needed a help from fort panic ... 
  what is a pusy ? 
  i get them on my phone too . 
  will most likely last until 3rd of june . 
  just like in season 1 . 
  try bigger resolution , turn anti aliasing on ... 
  i use [ asilk 's mod manager ( amm ) ] ( http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/29542-asilks-mod-manager-amm/ ), 
  european cities in a nutshell . 
  [ when you see it ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/whi1tld.png ), 
  the most important thing be more open with your community . 
  this is by far the most important thing you can do . 
  i am sick of seeing devs post , `` this is a cool idea , we will look into it '' to never hear anything about it again . 
  you do n't have to tell us what you 're working on but the least you can do is say hey we have something coming up we think you guys might like . 
  we feel left out when compared to the rest of the game . 
  this is one of the reasons why runescape is still alive ( sorta ) . 
  they created something they call ninja team , these guys look at simple and not very complicated suggestions and they introduce them in game in matter of month ( usually it 's about one to two weeks ) . 
  this is how listening to players is done . 
  when i look at the sunrise texture , i wish the could be the other way round . 
  i like the blue part of the sky more than the orange one . 
  too bad that ingame you see only the orange like 98 % of time . 
  this thread could be titled `` what i learned from any other mmo ... '', 
  but . . 
  unfortunately , i have a facebook . 
  then who is as fast as a hare , as brave as a bear ? 
  looks great ; it 's still unique ( no one rally has one ) ; underwater weapons might be usable above water someday ; sharks are amazing ; too much gold in da bank ; only legendary yet to collect ... those are only reasons i can come up with ... 
  i guess it will be an achievement , title or a de-soulbinding merchant . 
  so i 've found this http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/tube-dlr-lo-adult-fares-jan-2014.pdf, 
  so if my hotel would be near london city airport , that would mean that i 'd have to pay # 11.40 every single day to use all the transport i want to the centre right ? 
  alright , and dlr is part of this system so there are no extra fees right ? 
  [ this ] ( http://www.wikihow.com/main-page ) is not really lifehacks site , but there are so many guides for everything that 's why i use it , could be helpful for you . 
  then what does the day anytime/day off-peak means ? 
  so what 's the difference ? 
  soo ... did you get it ? 
  ac p1 is easiest one i guess . 
  but full group of people will pay you only like 8g . 
  i buy ac p1 every day , i level up my alts this way for free . 
  99,9 % times filling up the group is done in 0-2 minutes . 
  i do it basically when i start the computer + gw2 , i read reddit , emails and in the meantime i got my ac done . 
  little offtopic : we should really consider what is spoiler and what is not . 
  i like that you 've put your tag here because many people do n't consider talking about end of story being spoily anymore , because it 's almost 2 years old content . 
  this is good for new players though !, 
  can mirroring be achieved with galaxy trend plus ? 
  fights last longer , but taking objectives is easier and faster . 
  the guy looks like drew carey . 
  how much is it in mini mai trins ? 
  [ i think it 's pretty much like this . 
  depends if it 's fist time doing world completion or second time . 
  first time i did it disliked skill points because they were usually hard to get ( i was upleveled most of the times ) . 
  now when it 's not that much about exploring ( i already know the places and pretty much remember most of stuff i completed ) i dislike hearts . 
  simply because they take a lot of time compared to other things like pois and vistas ... 
  it was n't working though . 
  to be honest , if you , for example , play fractals just a little bit , you will easily have all 20 slot bags . 
  first udon and then this ... modders , you are just amazing !, 
  yeah for example warriors are pretty neat in skyhammer, 
  for example :, 
  fear + stomp + rifle butt + staggering blow + juggernaut kick/kick, 
  dolyak signet/balanced stance + rampage, 
  that 's 5 skills which can push you off the map and 28 seconds of stability . 
  / #rekt, 
  soulbinding legendary . 
  those are some unfair taxes !, 
  yeah it 's because $ $ $ is taxed lower than $ $ . 
  i can not blame you , but if i was living in your city , i would n't like it ( though your sims do because the game is set up to be like this ) :d, 
  i have it very similar , about 1600 hours on main and 1640 on account . 
  til, 
  actually i would definitely invite this chick to my house to play charades . 
  how much is it in crab meat ? 
  wish i could make cities like this !, 
  12/10 would build, 
  man thats a lot of crab meat . 
  you and / u/dr _ imposterv made some amazing cities !, 
  finally simcity 2013 is getting somwehere , thanks to your creativity ( and mods  ), 
  i got dawn from first 4 greatswords i 've ever placed in forge . 
  looks like [ pyre dye ] ( http://www.gw2spidy.com/item/41754 ) to me . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apb3jgq4fog ) is the only speed song for me . 
  i have 10 fine salvage kits sitting in my inventory all the time , every time i visit a merchant or something ( which happens way before i run out of them ) i refill them . 
  i know it takes 10x more inventory slots than salvage-o-matic , but hey look at the price of it . 
  i also have huge load of inventory slots so i never ran out of space . 
  i fell in love with my guild leader . 
  there 's this thing called [ `` slow tv '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz7lorizfzg ) . 
  it will put you in sleep very quickly . 
  new race pandarens confirmed, 
  might be because i 'm full geared in ascended with a legendary , but they still do n't feel challenging . 
  my hp did n't go below 90 % when i fought them , only the fights were longer because of their movement . 
  i like this ai change but they need to work on it a little bit more . 
  edit : am i really being downvoted because mobs do n't do any significant damage to my character ? 
  knights with berserker jewelry , berserker sunrise , scholar runes on everything . 
  i have a warrior . 
  chaoss of lyssa looks the best in my opinion .
