  how many asuras does it take to change a waypoint bulb ? 
  will probably take place from the 22th of october to the 9th of december 2014 . 
  china release scheduled on 4th of july, 
  it 's for the jumping puzzle achievement . 
  yikes , new place to do daily reviver . 
  simple idea , but not that simple to implement it . 
  otherwise we 'd have this in feature pack 1 . 
  you 've actually made me google why do gangsters aim this way, 
  the difference between knowing your shit and knowing you 're shit . 
  [ central train station ] ( http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28985-central-train-station/ ) is amazing too !, 
  2 blues 1 green and some empyreal fragments just for you !, 
  as well, 
  the very end ( edit ) should belong [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayiwon ), 
  6 to 0 is extremely impractival , especially in pvp so i got them on my special keys ( which are between 1 2 3 4 . . and f1 f2 f3 f4 ) . 
  that 's not really many people for server vs server . 
  so tequatl is still a mystery . 
  you can access it from pve , i 'm just wondering why can you only go there via wvw tab , not wp there . 
  that does n't answer my question though , i know why it 's not part of eb anymore , i just do n't know why we ca n't wp there . 
  other borderlands are separated as well and we can wp to them . 
  well you can always try it with the [ mystic fountains ] ( http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/obsidian_sanctum#mystic_fountains ) , 
  are you from ag/fsp btw ? 
  physically , it 's not , on the map it is . 
  but hey it 's like in pve , the actual maps are n't physically next to each other either but you can wp between them . 
  it could work how [ gw2nodes ] ( http://gw2nodes.com/ ) works . 
  by selecting server ip . 
  you can also use other items to get those rooms light up . 
  so where 's the tifu ? 
  depends on a version of simcity ( 2000 , simcity 4 , simcity 2013 ... ) you wan na play . 
  you 're right , but as you might see on the frontpage of this subreddit , it 's used for other simcity games than the 2013 one . 
  so , here , i 'd suggest you reading this thread , you will find best mods there, 
  which server are you from if i might ask you ? 
  high aps = better player is n't accurate , but there 's higher probability of high ap player being better at knowing mechanics and stuff than low ap player . 
  if you are two in a guild and you have all permissions , the other person has none , if you leave the guild , does it promote him ? 
  they could secretly do that you could receive it from some related npc when talking to them . 
  still , it 's an easter egg , it does n't need to be for everybody . 
  anet : proudly introducing a new map : [ the grove ` street ` ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hcnmxrp.png ), 
  well the tips then should be maximaly 160 characters long . 
  at this moment , you can load a map in 8-9 seconds with a good ssd and i can imagine that in one or two years this duration will be shorter again . 
  when i play games from my childhood , i recall reading all those loading screen tips . 
  now the game loads immediately and i do n't know what to do . 
  my opinion ( what will happen during ls2/after season ) :, 
  tiers and their rewards will be cancelled , rewards will be bought with karma or something like that instead . 
  sandstorm and events stay . 
  rest of the map will be in tomorrow 's patch or in a few more patches . 
  hearts wo n't probably be added there . 
  map might be added to world completion at some point , but not in nearest time . 
  they 've been there since may 20th , but yeah , i hope they will grow up soon !, 
  so if i get it right , it is the way i meant , if i choose 12:00 -12:30 then i 'll have to visit for example mt on monday at 12:10 and london eye the next day at 12:00 ? 
  is that correct ? 
  international calls are pretty expensive so i rather just asked here , 
  love your t-shirt . 
  6 months of passive farming . 
  played probably 1-2 hrs/day, 
  we are two , but you need some train tickets ( we 'll buy an oyster card ) and we got the transfer from airport already solved ( bus tickets bought ) . 
  so i guess that 's not an option :(, 
  exactly . 
  please let me kill him . 
  i think that some sort of mounts might appear in gemstore sooner or later . 
  they would n't provide faster travelling , they might be only for looks . 
  like , how cool would it be to ride a quaggan ? 
  yeah please , take my gems !, 
  i do n't play necro but i do n't want this to be patched simply because it 's hilarious and cool !, 
  maybe some lord beric dondarrion stuff ? 
  / r/keming, 
  it 's a good idea to verify all those potions , i like it . 
  the problem is that functionality of any of those potions can change with some patch ( we 've already experienced this few times ) so this verifying table is n't really stable . 
  i love the minimalism !, 
  this is gold . 
  that would make a reddit post too though !, 
  i care about being immersed in blood !, 
  things i want in feature pack 2 :, 
  * build saver, 
  * being kicked out of dungeon party does n't wipe chat, 
  * dungeon opener leaving does n't end the whole dungeon, 
  * new wvw sieges, 
  * living story season 1 , playable in journal, 
  * ability to select and replay each individual quest in living story ( not whole episode ), 
  * do something with orr ( have 2 instances for orr - clean or for who completed story and corrupted for those who have n't ? ), 
  * account-wide inventory bag, 
  * festival tokens in wallet, 
  * more legendaries, 
  * precursor scavenger hunt, 
  * old login screen, 
  * like we had it saying `` overflow '' at minimap while being in overflow , now it should show you which megaserver shard are you in , like i 'm in `` bloodtide coast 2 '' , while my friends are now in `` bloodtide coast 3 '' . 
  this way we woud n't have to use / ip, 
  * slot for minis, 
  * tonics could work as finishers , you would have a tab with them where you can unlock each tonic with a number of charges or unlimited with endless tonic , i love tonics but i do n't want to carry them around, 
  * on screen inventory line on for example the right side of the screen with like 5 slots where you could put items like fire elemental powder , food or potions , weapons for quicker switching etc. 
  [ how i imagine this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/poktv1i.jpg ), 
  ladders , shelters , barricades . 
  or maybe a new trap : spike strip ( which causes cripple ), 
  golem mastery would be cool as well . 
  risen belinda incoming, 
  but it is coming nonetheless as anet already confirmed . 
  but when they made those tools accountbound instead of soulbound , they actually offered everyone to have their gems refunded and i think that most of the people took it . 
  this might have been a problem before , but not now with the megaserver . 
  [ potions ] ( http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/potion ), 
  good job !, 
  social protocol states that when friend is upset you offer them a hot beverage , such as chocolate . 
  you monster !,
