  this guy has so many assists, 
  so many anet staff members posting here :o, 
  tengu expansion confirmed . 
  oh man i wish we could get a normal-sized free-for-all pvp zone . 
  the price for 1 transmutation charge is currently at + - 5g , so either spend your time or golds . 
  yep, 
  nope . 
  you can always take a look [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers ) , maybe it will help you . 
  and at loreclaw expanse and the osenfold shear . 
  yeah , maybe there was a jew who was much worse than hitler so they let hitler do the killing to save millions of lives . 
  i summon the mathwizards from / r/theydidthemath, 
  yeah , same trend as with `` drinking '' . 
  most of the young people you know as dumb probably would n't go vote anyway . 
  i wonder what he got back . 
  what program you used ? 
  i just tried using content-aware tool in photoshop for the denny wallpaper and i got same result as you in matter of 5 seconds . 
  well when he speaks in dothraki language it sounds literally like khalessi so i do n't see that as a problem . 
  we end teen numbers with - n\u00e1ct , so the teenager is called `` n\u00e1ctilet\u00fd '' here , where - let\u00fd means `` aged '' . 
  so no , i guess that many countries have teenagers .

  hello there again !, 
  you might remember me when i did exactly the same thing before feature pack 1 release . 
  yes , [ i did a poll ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/230e5g/yesterdays_poll_results_what_new_feature_are_you/ ) where i asked you to tell me your most favourite feature of the first pack . 
  it was quite successful as i received 211 comments collected 5569 responses over just 24 hours . 
  the wardrobe basically crushed every other feature with over 50 % players answering that it is their most favourite . 
  but back then , it was quite easy , wardrobe was really the biggest feature of the pack . 
  now , it 's kinda different , we have many features and i think that the fight will be more fair !, 
  i also took in mind thesuggestions you gave me in the last thread so the questions can suit your answer better . 
  ** this pack 's poll has 5 questions total and i need you to answer all of them please to make them count ** , it only takes like a minute . 
  in exchange , tomorrow i 'll post very detailed results of the poll like i did in april !, 
  fixed , thanks !, 
  i am  hey fluffy !, 
  i 'm only trying to find players ' most favourite part of the pack , i was hoping for different features as you do . 
  i 'm just working with what i have . 
  tomorrow , 
  i signed up with an isic card , downloaded windows 8.1 embedded . 
  you can not even tell a difference between this and standard version . 
  i mainly needed it for school programming ( homeworks and stuff ) but it can play any game as well . 
  poll closed . 
  stay focused for the results !, 
  [ results are up !, 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/2fq925/yesterdays_poll_results_what_new_feature_are_you/ ), 
  and they put `` guild wars 2 world tournament series '' at the beginning , 
  sorry , it 's hard to coordinate in so much data . 
  fixed now . 
  fixed , sorry for that . 
  it was amazing to watch the survey evolving . 
  i posted the survey at eu afternoon , then when i was about to go to sleep , it was 78 % to 22 % for eu . . and then eu went to sleep . 
  it is what china already has , you have a compass with arrow near minimap which points you to nearest hearts , events and other interesting stuff . 
  before applied strength and applied fortitude ( when this post was made ) it was pretty much useless . 
  changed that for you , 
  removed the commander buff . 
  this is completely unnecessary . 
  i will now have a really hard time finding a commander in stack of people . 
  you can see the dorito ( on map , minimap and on screen ) , not the buff . 
  i believe this has already been changed few months ago . 
  hi barbie !, 
  but i want it in pve and do n't want to switch it all the time . 
  there 's no reason why at least a little experienced players would need it in pvp . 
  i 'd rather not talk about girls and cups . 
  i could use the amd memory one , please , 
  this is not a problem solver since new players would probably choose the new player option . 
  and as you can see , new player ( chicken1337 ) does n't like the new system . 
  would it be wrong to put a brazzers logo over it ? 
  i have over 2000 played hours and i 'm still not sure how combos work . 
  / r/prague, 
  i 'd go for aukro.cz , votocvohoz.cz or ebay.cz , later this year , amazon should start in czech republic . 
  one word . 
  communism . 
  it 's a little disappointing that you just need to spend about 40 minutes over whole tournament to get all the achievements . 
  i do n't find doing regular wvw for 40 minutes as an achievement . 
  no one at our server used the pink dorito :(, 
  a few minutes is kinda misleading though because last time i got this window i could list another item 20sec after that . 
  it should be `` a few moments '' at least , 
  may the odds be ever in your favor .

  i 'd lose on purpose to see those naked ladies in my country . 
  * da-da-da dun-diddle un-diddle un-diddle uh da-da *, 
  hello !, 
  i could n't agree more . 
  these `` achievements '' should n't be even called achievements , because being 5 minutes in wvw is n't such a big deal . 
  i would n't say no to that . 
  1 million karma to be clear , 
  3 sieges seems reasonable for me . 
  altough , if someone has a commander tag , he should be immune to this exhausted state . 
  these people most probably troll on their alt account and for 300g it 's kinda expensive fun . 
  i 'm not saying this will eliminate the problem , but we could see the trolls much less if it will need such an investment . 
  probably not since you can only put us states in registration .
