  or ` dial number ', 
  metropcs only ships to us though :(, 
  this is how it should be made with the patch . 
  i like that you can select pack of gems , but the inability of choosing your own number is really stupid . 
  do they ship outside us ? 
  many muslim women wear lingerie/stockings underneath their burkas .

  came here just to see this comment . 
  can it be neutral as well ? 
  i used yours as well , 
  here 's my link :, 
  feel free to register , 
  the installation of windows 8 took like 5 mins , updating the build takes over 30 mins . 
  why 's that ? 
  yeah , we had a guild raid yesterday in labyrinth , we managed to get lich down in about a minute . 
  it 's definitely worse with more players . 
  we have public pianos here in czech republic , whoever can sit at it and play some music , it 's extremely popular here , i 've never seen the piano empty . 
  i guess we can , let 's spread the world . 
  yeah , happened to me twice yesterday , also on warrior . 
  well i definitely know fiverr.com , you can try `` their '' subreddits, 
  you can try this , usually it can do most , if not the whole job . 
  same , pm me / u/massivevivid , 
  how much is the loss/profit ? 
  well he 's not lindsey stirling ... 
  try guesting in another language based server . 
  it solved the problem for me . 
  i can very easily prove you wrong . 
  under a barcode you see a number , put that in google and the item on which is the barcode on will magicaly appear . 
  sorry , we could n't connect to google/facebook . 
  you have too many devices associated with your google/facebook account . 
  try again in a few days . 
  have n't worked for me :(, 
  if you want to have this picture photoshopped , you will probably have to provide a way more better quality picture . 
  if you want your goku-friend to be drawn ( like a caricature ) , the resolution is just fine .

  or maybe it means that belinda was rank 70-79 in pvp . 
  would n't it be just easier to clean the windows ? 
  show us some of your previous work , 
  i salvage whites with basic salvage kit , blues and greens with fine salvage kit , sell rares and exotics . 
  if those rares/exotics are n't sellable , i salvage them with black lion salvage kit/mystic kit . 
  it 's so much cheaper than buying boosters , i 'd definitely suggest it . 
  you can stack the boost which is actually really amazing ( i have 6 hours wxp buff right now ), 
  i already bought thousands of candy corn in case we will run out of them . 
  with the gobbler 's cooldown , the line `` you can not use this item right now '' should be filtered in chat as many people will tend to clickspam it to gain buffs . 
  i believe it does n't make such a difference , you 'll definitely spend those 100 gems later at some point .

  how much wood would a wood chop chop if a wood chop would chop wood ? 
  is n't it us only ? 
  us only . 
  because you pronounce it as `` es '', 
  yeah , both are heterological words . 
  hypothetically , could you do an extension which is watching rss from a certain website , and when the site releases a post , the extension will grab the link of the new post from rss and open up [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/submit ) with the link pasted into the link row ? 
  of course with settings that would allow me add those rss links and connect the rss with certain subreddit . 
  correct me if i am wrong , but is n't this against the rules ?

  how exactly you review things ? 
  it does n't really offer me any spots i could review . 
  how many can you review in 2 hours ? 
  after few , it stopped saying something like i will get payment next work day and started saying that if i want further payment i should visit the venue in 2 hours ( eventhought it 's my first time reviewing it ... ), 
  it 's global , not only us . 
  if you do n't have nexus 5 , you 'll apparently get shaun the sheep . 
  can we have both shaun and gravity ?

  same here . 
  i 'm slowly losing my hopes since it 's almost tuesday here and i have n't received my friday ( or any ) money . 
  maybe $ 1/review was just too good to be true . 
  or united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland, 
  me too !, 
  i 'm really pleasantly surprised i got paid , 
  i just believe i received far less money than i should get by reviewing . 
  i mean , it 's still amazing amount of money for a job like this and i love it , but i feel like i reviewed much more things . 
  maybe it 's just payment not for all 3 day ( fri , sat and sun ) and i 'll get some money later . 
  anyway , i will definitely keep reviewing !, 
  thanks s1ic3 for showing us , 
  i know the square knot,
