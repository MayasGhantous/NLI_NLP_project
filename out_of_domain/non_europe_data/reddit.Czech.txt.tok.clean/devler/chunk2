  i vote for the heavy version , 
  good job with those !, 
  ogre pet whistles and fire elemental powder works great as well , 
  i really like your work . 
  i hope people will get more creative like you than just full arah . 
  definitely this one :,

  because bitcoin is extremely unstable currency . 
  many are worried that the price will go so high that everyone will exchange them for real money to make a profit , therefore the price will actually go down . 
  you ca n't know when this will happen or if bitcoins will still exist in a year or two . 
  i do n't plan doing it second time , but i actually really enjoyed doing 100 % for the first time , 
  logan used run !, 
  it 's super effective !, 
  in my opinion , this tool does n't give any advantages to players using it so the chance of getting banned for this is very , very low . 
  though i ca n't unfortunately say that it is 100 % not banable . 
  i got my sunrise like 3 hours ago . 
  i started with 0 t6 mats and it took me almost 3 months to get all 250 stacks . 
  i farmed and farmed , sold things i did n't need and bought the rest . 
  i played like 3 hours a day approx . 
  the thing is that people who got dawn from mf will recommend you to do mf and people who were n't lucky at mf and/or bought it will recommend you to farm golds to buy it . 
  i got my dawn from daily mystic forge ( forging the cheapest rare swords ) . 
  i would say that those ways take on average the same time getting it . 
  you can either be lucky at mf or not , tp is surely safest , but forge might be much cheaper , it only depends on luck . 
  personally i hope it will be 2-4 times a year so it wo n't become too routine . 
  season 1 ends on december 6th . 
  anet you 'd better do better updates so shaman can come back !, 
  hmm . . 
  i tried to connect them more but it just seems like waste of time :d, 
  also there was really really long and big commanders ' guide , in word or pdf , does anyone have link ? 
  actually i 'm pretty sure i saw this change in the patch notes in the fractals section !, 
  it 's not there anymore though . 
  it was in beta but it was n't working good/at all . 
  not quite sure . 
  anet said that if the program gives an advantage over other players , you can be banned for using it . 
  but that 's questionable since e.g. 
  gw2stuff overlay gives advantage of not having to look at the website too and i 've never seen anyone banned for it . 
  i have i3 , hd 4000 and also 4gb ram , playing on lowest , laggs only in la/wvw , pvp is most of the times unplayable too , but i really good pc too so i can enjoy everything smooth on max graphics , i use laptop only when i 'm out of home . 
  i 've always used this : http://www.gw2dungeons.net/, 
  new fractals will be there soon . 
  i think you have to buy 100g one first and then you can buy those 10g color skins for it . 
  it 's really interesting , i 've been playing for over a year ( 1000 + hours ) and i did n't get any message about gold selling . 
  not really , i play on gmt +1 from like 16:00 -22:00 , basically on european primetime . 
  why belgian ? 
   in addition , everyone who completes the premier season veteran meta achievement will receive :, 
  the title of veteran of the mists , a wvw season 1 reward chest key , which will unlock a special chest at the end of the season which contains rewards based on your world 's ultimate performance , and a mini dolyak . 
  on top of that , participating players on the top world in every league will be receiving a special finisher that represents their success . 
  remind your enemies of your battlefield prowess with a gold , silver , or bronze finisher !, 
  we do n't know what will be in the chest , anet is keeping it pretty secret and if dataminers mined it , they do n't want to ruin the surprise . 
  my thought : 3 blues , 2 greens , 1s35c , drop of liquid karma , 10 badges of honor , essence of luck , 2 trebuchets and a flame ram . 
  definitely ebonhawke !, 
  come on guys , it even has an asura gate !,

  here you can see it by yourself ingame , but according to the post below , they might be outdated or different version .

  i completed it by being downed under his tail , it wo n't hit you when you are on the ground . 
  i 'm unfortunately pretty used to get many new holiday stuff every year from runescape , it had amazing holiday content back in these days ... 
  `` thank you ... that was surprisingly helpful . '', 
  i know about whispers and priory story quests which take place in la , you get to kill mobs and yes , they do drop loot . 
  not really sure what those quests are ( priory is around 50 + level , whispers about 30 level ) . 
  880:1099 blue team wins !, 
  gather orichalcum/ancient wood logs ( you can sell both or make ingots from orichalcum/planks from logs . 
  check out tp for prices of mats . 
  do dailies and buy heavy crafting bags from laurel vendor , each one cost 1 laurel and contains 3 t6 mats . 
  dailies also provides mystic coin , which you will need too . 
  do cof , ac , hotw and/or more dungeons which u like . 
  you will get golds/drops for buying more mats and also tokens . 
  use tokens to buy cof and higher rare dungeon armor ( 30 tokens each ) and salvage them with mystic/black lion salvage kits . 
  you can buy exotics with lower than cof dungeon tokens too . 
  you will get mithril ores , globs of ectoplasm and as a bonus when salvaging exotics - globs of dark matter which u might need later when doing ascended armour/weapons . 
  if you have some obsidian shards , mystic coins , globs of ecto and skillpoints , make mystic clovers . 
  with this `` recipe '' you will get either mystic clovers ( needed for legendary ) or some t6 mats ( needed for legendary too ) . 
  do living story , champion trains , invasions , world bosses . 
  you will get rares and mats . 
  i do n't know anyone who made his legendary all from his supplies . 
  count with the fact that you will have to buy a lot of materials instead of farming them all , thus you need a lot of gold . 
  never buy/sell anything on tp instantly . 
  make wise and good offers . 
  you will save/earn money . 
  if you still want to get mats by yourself , i highly recommend this guide : http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/1p2dgc/guidet6_material_acquisition_guide_updated/ by nightsfrost . 
  also , use this guide to make more money out of all currencies : http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/1ocogi/guide_converting_your_currencies_to_gold/ by eirh , 
  ( beware of glory which is not up to date , use the new merchant in hotm to convert glory to golds at amazing rate ), 
  the thing is that people who got it from mf will recommend you to do mf and people who were n't lucky at mf and/or bought it will recommend you to farm golds to buy it . 
  i got my dawn from daily mystic forge ( forging the cheapest rare swords ) . 
  i would say that those ways take on average the same money getting it . 
  you can either be lucky at mf or not , tp is surely safest , but forge might be much cheaper , it only depends on luck . 
  i totally need this game too !, 
  enjoy your present and the rest of the christmas !, 
  not separating would be much worse . 
  china has huge market and it would cause huge inflation in game . 
  only in online ? 
  i would love to experience it in singleplayer too but i do n't have live gold :(, 
  awww , why the snow can not be in singleplayer too ?
