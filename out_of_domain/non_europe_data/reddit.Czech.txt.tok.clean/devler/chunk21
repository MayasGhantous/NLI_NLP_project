  i was checking the site every day and at some point it stopped showing and i could sign up . 
  kinda reminds me this video of [ czech president stealing a protocolar pen when on a press conference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpe4t0lxzce ), 
  and the parody [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stygulgyakg ) . 
  [ best i could do ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wadx5se.jpg ), 
  if you have photoshop , it 's really easy . 
  just select the whole area of the grill and paint it red . 
  then select that layer , go to blending options and set the blend mode to overlay/soft light , 
  bought 10 + items , all were just fine . 
  [ i came up with this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/niz1v3u.jpg ), 
  here it is my friend , sorry for your lost, 
  ^ if ^ you ^ are ^ satisfied ^ with ^ result , ^ you ^ can ^ donate ^ to ^ my ^ paypal ^ ( adam.safranek@gmail.com ) ^ so ^ i ^ can ^ afford ^ to ^ pay ^ tuition ^ on ^ a ^ graphic ^ design ^ university , ^ thank ^ you . 
  can you be more specific with your request , please ? 
  here , best i could do, 
  [ like this ?

  yeah the video is real , czechs are still making puns and jokes on him because of this . 
  however , the pen is probably a gift he was about to receive after signing up some contracts . 
  eventhough these pens may cost thousands of dollars , it is a favor from the country he 's making deal with . 
  it just does n't feel like it because he acts like he is really stealing the pen . 
  i can do it . 
  does the soon \u2122 mean it 's coming in late 2016 ? 
  how much you need for payout there ? 
  wow this is amazing !, 
  open this in photoshop , press ctrl+u and slide the top slider to yellow , done . 
  i tried to make it less obvious, 
  here, 
  ^ if ^ you ^ are ^ satisfied ^ with ^ result , ^ you ^ can ^ donate ^ to ^ my ^ paypal ^ ( adam.safranek@gmail.com ) ^ so ^ i ^ can ^ afford ^ to ^ pay ^ tuition ^ on ^ a ^ graphic ^ design ^ university , ^ thank ^ you . 
  there 's no way you can just enhance stuff like in csi , you either are satisfied with slightly better sharpness or you have to recreate it basically from scratch . 
  i tried the second option , so it 's not 100 % same as the original , but i did the best i can to reproduce it . 
  ^ if ^ you ^ are ^ satisfied ^ with ^ result , ^ you ^ can ^ donate ^ to ^ my ^ paypal ^ ( adam.safranek@gmail.com ) ^ so ^ i ^ can ^ afford ^ to ^ pay ^ tuition ^ on ^ a ^ graphic ^ design ^ university , ^ thank ^ you .

  used your referral link op , my here, 
  let 's go referral train !, 
  actually , it 's petr kotas ' work . 
  he specializes in public transportation architecture . 
  this should belong here, 
  those are some really good looking logos . 
  the price is definitely reasonable , 
  here you go , sir, 
  what exactly is that couple doing ? 
  how much do they pay ? 
  whoops , looks like you have 2 same links here !, 
  definitely agree !, 
  exactly the result i was hoping for !, 
  thank you !, 
  thanks to warbanner warriors will always be important part of wvw . 
  i believe they said the reason why face to face trading did n't make it to the game was that they were afraid of scamming ( like switching dawn for khrysaor at the last second of trade ) . 
  but i think it caused more scamming . 
  you can see many people trading in lfg and probably at least 80 % of them are scammers . 
  also , you share the same device id ( unique id which every android device has , do n't know if ipads has one ) . 
  it can be changed very easily though . 
  you only need root and pro version of titanium backup . 
  us only i guess . 
  same with vizunnah square , used to be 1st server for quite a long time , now it 's rank 9 . 
  so . . what is the request ? 
  [ looks like our friend here . . would use some enhance !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhf_56sxrgk ), 
  it 's the other way , person who signs up under you gets the $ 10 immediately . 
  you get those $ 10 if that person under you makes another $ 10 . 
  [ sure , here you go !, 
  i thought i could make it , but shaping his chest to look normal was beyond my skills . 
  so i just made the batman logo more christmas-like, 
  kinda reminds me jagex 's bot nuke day on runescape . 
  together with a former creator of most famous botting client they invented an algorithm to discover bots and they banned 1,5 mil botting accounts in one day . 
  and when there was no luck system i believe ? 
  i found something similar , but it 's probably not the one you meant since i think i know which one you mean, 
  you wo n't find any ( horizontal for wallpaper ) , as this picture was actually taken in vertical . 
  i 'll try to make you one . 
  alright , here it is, 
  ^ if ^ you ^ are ^ satisfied ^ with ^ result , ^ you ^ can ^ donate ^ to ^ my ^ paypal ^ ( adam.safranek@gmail.com ) ^ so ^ i ^ can ^ afford ^ to ^ pay ^ tuition ^ on ^ a ^ graphic ^ design ^ university , ^ thank ^ you . 
  very well done !, 
  it 's photorealistic , 
  since the task is completed i 'll just leave this here for the lulz, 
  here, 
  it 's because the background is n't white and is transparent . 
  here 's version with white background, 
  and here 's with the inverted colours, 
  no problem !, 
  glad i could help , 
  i highly recommend this site, 
  few days ago i received an email from my 5 years ago self , it really made my day since you can forget about the fact that you did something like this very easily . 
  i did the best i could, 
  it basically showed the whole collection tab you normally have in gw2 bank . 
  on this website , you 'd put a number ( amount ) of each material you have in bank and it showed you how much is your bank worth . 
  it really reminds me of [ hotel international in prague ] ( http://www.pragueconvention.cz/userfiles/hip_2011_1404390151.jpg ), 
  which salvage kit is recommended ? 
  or you can just use [ your own forge ] ( http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/mystic_forge_conduit ) right in the bloodtide coast . . you know , if you got the money . 
  where exactly in the background is that strange ? 
  could you circle that up for me ? 
  that 's what i thought , but being him not really in the background kinda confused me . 
  masterpiece !, 
  no problem !, 
  glad i could help . 
  here, 
  the best i can do , the distortions are stilll visible though,
