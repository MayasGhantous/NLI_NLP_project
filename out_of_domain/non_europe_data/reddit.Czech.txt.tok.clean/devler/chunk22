  hunger games spoiler !, 
  hundreds of children and men just died in that hospital . . 
  * from the new movie hunger games : mockingjay-z and kanye west *, 
  sure, 
  jobs like this will be sooo easier when this will came out, 
  here, 
  the background is already completely gone . 
  the squares you see in photoshop just indicates that there is no background . 
  if it would be just white , you would n't tell if there is a white background or no background , so they made it this way . 
  that is actually a really great idea . 
  i will probably do this if the shipping is too expensive ( it lacka the personality of the gif bit i believe it will make someone happy either way ) . 
  til my farts are n't normal . 
  kids born in 2001 wo n't be 14 this year . 
  i 'm not quite sure of that , either from spidy or from tp api . 
  photoshopped mountains, 
  original mountains :, 
  first picture not working . 
  here, 
  still not ok ?

  no problem  glad i could help,

  i actually took more photos of this roof than of the platform 9 ^ 3 ^ / ^ 4, 
  thanks !, 
  oh i 'm sorry , i meant / r/picrequests, 
  i think this picture already looks awesome , 
  my idea, 
  the quality of the photo is very bad ( due to lack of light ) , i ca n't really do much about it . 
  maybe just lock the launcher ? 
  would that work ? 
  like , if he 'd press home , it would show lockscreen would n't it ? 
  or the new google 's messenger app . 
  it 's my deviantart , 
  i use right mouse button for this . 
  * turn the camera shake off . 
  i know that the game might feel more immersive with it activated , but your head will feel much better without it . 
  also it 's great for some jps where the terrain is shaking . 
  * always have some buff on . 
  some of the cheapest ones cost about 20 copper . 
  even if the buff is n't anything extremely great ( you will get something like +80 healing ) , it 's better than not to have anything up . 
  * you can wp out of dungeon to everywhere , just switch the map layer . 
  * when playing spirit watch pvp map , do n't bring the orb to neutral capture points , it wo n't decap anything and it will give you only 15 points . 
  * if you are guarding point a or c in skyhammer , use the `` jumper '' to jump to that platform above point . 
  you can very easily surprise your enemy . 
  * when playing temple of silent storm , learn the timers !, 
  the most important time is 8:30 when both stilness and tranquility appears , be there in time !, 
  * when attacking a keep in wvw at double doors , rams who were destroying the first door might be able to hit the inner one as weel if placed correctly . 
  * turn on aoe loot on interact and autoloot . 
  even if it might be a little more confusing for you , you will get used to it very quickly and wo n't be able to live without it after then . 
  this one pretty much sums it up :, 
  may melandru grow with you . 
  us only !, 
  you are able join the private beta launch group and you can get a sample shupped to your adress to test it out . 
  hello vikki , i do n't want to ruin this for you , but . . 
   turning black hair into blonde hair is nearly impossible . 
  the reason is that you have more information to start with in lighter colors . 
  with black you will see very little detail , making it difficult to make lighter colors realistic . 
  it can be done , but either it wo n't look real or you would need someone who 's is really skilled at using graphic programs ( i 'm not good enough to do this job ) . 
  either way , i can imagine that you will look amazing even with the blond hair , 
  ** in lab colors **, 
  using the preserve details technique, 
  using the bicubic smoother technique, 
  ** in rgb colors : **, 
  using the preserve details technique, 
  using the bicubic smoother technique, 
  personally , i believe the preserve details version in rgb looks the best . 
  i marked down all the reflections i could see for easier removal, 
  i do n't want to be rude or anything but do you expect that someone will clear and make look professional 162 photos ? 
  working on all 162 could take up to 8 hours of editing ( giving 3 minutes per photo ) . 
  that usually costs $ 50 +, 
  i mean , sure , i could edit some of the picture , if you 'll give me exact informations of what you want to fix , but 162 photos is a lot . 
  however , as i basically said , if you 'll go back to blond hair and at some point and you will want to see how would you look with brown hair , red hair or even some crazy blue hair , you can pm me or post here again and i 'm 100 % sure your request will be completed , as it 's a really easy job . 
  i personally have n't ever seen the mail carrier fly to me . 
  adobe photoshop . 
  i actually started to like playing thieves much more after this experience . 
  it lasts way too long . 
  no problem , glad i could help ,

  no problem , glad i could help , 
  i tried to but then the photo did n't look real . 
  however , i use photoshop , which is amazing for these type of things thanks to content aware filling and clone stamp tool . 
  make this post sticky at least for some time . 
  . . one amazing jumping puzzle i 'd say ? 
  i do n't like the big fonts used at b ( match stats ) during a match . 
  erlibird.com sometimes offers game testing . 
  but usually you only test websites/apps for money ( atm , divine souls test is on , however all places for cash reward are taken already as it 's on for like a week ) . 
  i smell dragon bash festival !, 
  how does this look ? 
  the picture quality you provided is not the best , but i came up with this, 
  hope you like it , 
  np  glad you like it,
