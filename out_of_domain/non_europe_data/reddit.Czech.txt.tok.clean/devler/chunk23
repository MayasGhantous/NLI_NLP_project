  i 'd flair this as us only then . 
  if there was an adblock , you would probably just see 5 ten minute silences/black screens in each film . 
  tvs are streaming , you ca n't just skip to something which has n't been aired yet . 
  i 've been using erli bird for few months now and i learnt one thing :, 
  never trust the * estimated reward date * , some of the payments can take up like a week longer than it says . 
  some are pretty quick though . 
  eventually , you will get paid do n't worry . 
  try to wait , i 've received a payment for basically everything i reviewed . 
  i would n't even mind if this was a gemstore thing ... 
  probably only as an account unlock though . 
  for anyone who 'd want to try it with ` fake ' . edu email - californiacolleges.edu , it does n't work . 
  no problem  glad i could help !, 
  ^ if ^ you ^ are ^ satisfied ^ with ^ result , ^ you ^ can ^ donate ^ to ^ my ^ paypal ^ ( adam.safranek@gmail.com ) ^ so ^ i ^ can ^ afford ^ to ^ pay ^ tuition ^ on ^ a ^ graphic ^ design ^ university , ^ thank ^ you . 
   ** nsfw requests are not allowed anymore !,

  and . . could you post that picture please ? 
   ** nsfw requests are not allowed anymore !, 
  ** well , except for pictures of babies in hospitals with life supporting devices . 
  please tag those nsfw and report all other violations to the mods . 
  on top of that , i think that some people are making the tragic stories up to encourage more people to get their request done . 
  i 've seen a couple of examples where someone put an image here , for example , one guy posted a photo of his friend and wanted it to look silly to troll him . 
  no one fulfilled the request , so like 2 days later he said he just died and wanted the picture to look silly so his parents would smile looking at that photo ... 
  best i could do , if someone can enhance it more , feel free to do so, 
  here you go , sir, 
  i like that request , though !, 
  it 's clearly a girl , you can tell by the stucture of her face . 
  my try, 
  beware that if you want to transfer money to paypal , there is a $ 1 fee if that amount is under $ 15 . 
  so if you do n't mind waiting few days for getting paid for other focus groups , it will save you some money . 
  ding ding ding we have a winner . 
  including opening photoshop on a slow computer and uploading to imgur with 10kb/s upload, 
  so , 30kb/s ? 
  i asked them about this and they said that they give golds in bunch every few months .

  [ ah , push it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcadcbr95ou ),

  while e-bola should really just be some internet virus while bola should be a real disease . 
  sure , note that this job gets easier the newer version of photoshop you have ( you need cs5 or higher i believe to follow my tutorial ) . 
  gimp is not really good in my opinion , i used it for a while and i switched to photoshop , as it 's more intuitive and powerful . 
  also , zoner photo studio is worth mentioning if you 're looking for some better image editing software . 
  however , photoshop is the best no matter what . 
  no problem , glad i could help ,
