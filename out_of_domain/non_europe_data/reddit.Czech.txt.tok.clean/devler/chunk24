  you 've won my giveaway !, 
  please , check your inbox for a steam key . 
  i do n't have words for this , i love it !, 
  thanks , 
  i will probably get a lot of downvotes for this , but i think that there is sooo many swagbucks posts here on / r/beermoney . 
  each time i visit this subreddit i see someone posting how to get 20 swagbucks , how to get 15 swagbucks etc. 
  i mean , come on , 35 swagbucks is worth like $ 0.35 ? 
  do we have to have a thread for every single offer like this , here , on / r/beermoney ? 
  why posts like this could n't be only on / r/swagbucks ? 
  we have a subreddit exactly for posts like this ... 
  no , unfortunately . 
  made by czech artist m\u00edla f\u00fcrstov\u00e1 . 
  on our server , we agreed on using purple commander tag for scouting . 
  yes , they do ship internationally, 
  i bought a smartphone from russia once , worked for me , it was unblocked ( in europe ) . 
  fot the electronics , beware that russia uses european power plugs , so you 'll have to use adapter . 
  aeroflot.ru and flightscanner.net, 
  they seem to be increasing the prices due to the exchange rate so they do n't loose so much money . 
  there might be a lot of items still cheap though . 
  i 'd love to see profit/loss . 
  you 're wrong , it 's two way powered . 
  both with solar panel and battery . 
  original thread here :, 
  / r/perfectfit, 
  they 're adorable !, 
  is this what you 're looking for ? 
  here you go, 
  yeah , fifa 15 is starting at $ 25 , depends on which platform you want it on . 
  no unfortunately , all i could find was some books and a khl cap . 
  also 50 % of mafia 2 . 
  in czech republic , beer can be as cheap as $ 0,4 / 0,5 l so it 's cheaper than most of the bottled water brands . 
  i think we found the santa who sent [ the $ 5,000.00 gift !, 
  ] ( http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/#/stats/secret-santa-2014/ ), 
  set the blending options of the text to overlay and copy that text layet a few times , i 'd love to see how it would look !, 
  [ kaleidoscopes are fun in every age ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rwwxigd.jpg ), 
  [ coming this winter to ios ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ezlkse1.jpg ), 
  i also already suggested it on the forums and reddit the day wardrobe came out :(, 
  til new krytan does n't have punctuation marks . 
  probably by your bank . 
  maybe soon, 
  [ how 's this ? 
  they still can be seen all over prague . 
  i think it 's euroawk 's default billboard ` background ' . 
  they have it on when no one has a commercial advertisement there . 
  2 same pictures dude, 
  so jealous of you , my secret santa only retrieved my info on december 1st and i 've never heard of him since then :(, 
  if i understand your question , you want to know if you can use your debit card to pay for something with paypal cash ? 
  if yes , then no . 
  if you want to pay with debit card , you need to send your paypal cash to your bank account . 
  it works other way round though , you can pay with paypal using your debit card . 
  if you want to have the money on your bank account , you just need to withdraw on paypal , very easy thing to do , you just need to set things like iban etc. 
  the card is basically the access point to your bank account balance . 
  this means that if you 've linked your paypal to your card , paypal has access to your bank balance so you can pay with paypal even if you do n't have any money on paypal . 
  paypal will just grab the money from your bank account . 
  that is partly correct . 
  you 'll have $ 1000 avaible for paying with paypal , but your paypal balance will be $ 0 . 
  paypal does n't know how much money you have on your bank account though . 
  if someone will give you $ 5 via paypal , your paypal will show $ 5 balance . 
  you will have $ 1005 avaible for paying via paypal . 
  once you move the $ 5 to your bank account , you will still have $ 1005 avaible for paying with paypal , but also for paying only with your card . 
  i hope i wrote that clear , it might look confusing but esentially it 's very easy . 
  no problem . 
  glad i could help !, 
  i 've made a compilation of all euroawk ads you can see around :, 
  if you have issues , you should visit the urinal which has amazed girl above it , like the middle one here :, 
  us only/global ? 
  there are more ` positive urinals ' than this one . 
  however , when those positive ones are taken , i usually resist going to a negative one and just wait for some positive one . 
  good luck to everyone here !, 
  check out / r/erlibird , they pay for reviewing websites/apps/games . 
  the mentioned last year thread :, 
  i 'd suggest you to do the wintersday one , and do it on unrankeds . 
  it might be avaible for upgrade with w7 for free too , no one really knows at this moment . 
  i 'm now very tempted between getting a finisher/aquabreather . 
  brilliant game , i love the idea of snake combined with wvw !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  saving this , i 'll use this at some point . 
  before you could exchange karma for entering a focus group even with all spots taken . 
  now , everyone can get a cash reward , as long as you provide top quality feedback . 
  still counts . 
  / r/contest, 
  / r/erlibird , but you wo n't get the money earlier than 14 days or so, 
  i wish i got matched with your kid , those are some amazing gifts , really !, 
  it sucks that a lot of good people ( like most redditors are i believe ) have n't received their gifts , but this asshole did . 
  i did that and my ss have n't shipped the gift yet either . 
  on top of that , according to tracking number my giftee already received the gift a week ago and i have n't really heard of him . 
  i 'm just trying to say that with 3 credits matching you are n't guaranteed to be matched with better people . 
  i remember that feel from my first exchange i participated in ( last year 's ss ) . 
  you probably will be matched with more trusted users , but as i said , nothing is guaranteed . 
  kofola  dr. pepper  coke  pepsi, 
  this is the thread, 
  still you can pay with $ in most european states , even if it 's not their main currency .
