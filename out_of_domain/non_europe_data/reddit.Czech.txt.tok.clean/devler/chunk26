  10 of them were shipping to a different country , they all shipped the gift before 20th december and not a single gift arrived to giftee yet . 
  do n't lose hope . 
  do n't confuse signing up for a rematch with signing up with entering in the rematching pool as a giftee . 
  i feel like many people this year signed up as a rematcher in hope they will receive a gift . 
  you 're unfortunately not one of my friend 's giftees . 
  however , to answer your main question , you still have a chance for being rematched , however , since your santa marked gift as shipped , your chances are pretty low . 
  but i 'll just suggest you not to worry , i believe that you will get your present , 
  if it was going to last over 10 seasons , he would n't be the president in the second already . 
  a year . 
  i decided right after i got dawn from mf . 
  scarlet really liked the dyes . 
   what keeps you playing so long after release ? 
  i just do n't have any better game to play . 
   most of the time, 
  not always, 
  i feel like after watching house of cards i understand usa 's politics far better than my country 's . 
  1 hour , about 2-3 times per week . 
  $ 20-60 reward, 
  also we eat it from the inside , that 's pretty unique . 
  they also ca n't hear other people honk at them . 
  [ runescape has pretty nice bank system ] ( http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g289/nickster1412/banktabs.png ), 
  [ in our shopping centre ] ( https://www.google.cz/search?q=palladium+wc&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=pu2qviwkh4v0uontgjah&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ), 
  you 're right , if we do n't count the deviousmud , it took them 7 years to introduce bank tabs ( 2008 ) . 
  guutra 's homestead blowed my mind . 
  well , this site is a little spurious since they pay out only ~ 5-10 % of their users . 
  i 've literally seen a hundreds complain posts about them not paying and much less posts about them actually paying out . . 
  however , since it only takes like 10 seconds/day to get the daily job done i 'm giving it a try and we 'll see if i get paid out . 
  ** for anyone who wants to try it : **, 
  it 's a website where you get paid for comparing pictures . 
  you will get $ 2 to your account every day ( for about 10 seconds work ) . 
  after 90 days of comparing , you can get paid ( they pay out twice a month ) .

  if you have any questions regarding this , feel free to ask me . 
  do n't want to mock anyone , but the drawn one is much prettier , 
  agreed . 
  this pretty much sums up what i do in gw2 these days : log in , get reward , finish dailies , log off . 
  made my way there as well to see if there 's anything interesting , but i did n't even notice them when i was there . 
  same , unfortunately :(, 
  edit : yay , my ss just picked my info !, 
   so happy now !, 
  if you 're reading this , hello !, 
  likely , there are 21,849 people signed as rematchers but only 18,151 people were given a rematch santa yet . 
  yes , they email the people about it . 
  however , it might go unnoticed because of the number of emails redditgifts is sending . 
  reminds me of playing runescape . 
  how about testing apps , websites and stuff for money ? 
  head over to / r/erlibird . 
  the first pic talks about positive effects on your body when you use the bath salt . 
  second picture talks about rosemary itself . 
  on the first pic , there are also the instructions you talked about :, 
  using : you can use minimum of 5 spoons of the bath salt , preferably full package for one bath . 
  more you have in your bath , the better result you will get . 
  after spilling the salt in the hot bath , jump in and stay there for approximately 20 minutes . 
  then you have to take a shower and apply a lotion or body cream to your skin . 
  after draining the water out of the bath , use a strainer to catch the insoluble components . 
  there is a possibilty that they 've actually sent it . 
  shipping can take even 4 or more weeks . 
  just make sure you have clicked '' i have not yet received a gift from my original santa . '', 
  it 's not a church , it 's actually old town city hall in the old town square . 
  i also dance sequence , never been to blackpool though , it 's one of my biggest dreams probably . 
  paypal or / r/changetip are the most suitable options . 
  it 's just an experiment , it will be there only till january 13 . 
  happy cake day by the way . 
  * divinity 's reach : wintersday dailies , royal terrace, 
  * lion 's arch : afk hub , waiting for reset, 
  * eb/borderlands : lootbags, 
  * hotm : daily pvp, 
  * i 'm sending money to family or friends - you will pay the fees, 
  * i 'm paying for goods or services - the person who receives the money pay the fees, 
  so if you promised $ 1 reward for something , the person should get $ 1 right ? 
  not $ 0.67 . 
  you have to be the one who pay the fees , so you should select the first option . 
  or you can just send them $ 1.34 and let them pay the fees , not really a difference . 
  ^ ( ^ 2.9 % ^ + ^ $ .30 ^ paypal ^ domestic ^ fee ), 
  peter was basically the only top candidate for a governor . 
  frank set the `` hitting on peter '' with doug . 
  rachel got peter drunk so he could n't do the morning interview properly . 
  after the failed interview , peter 's life was falling apart , so his death looked like a suicide . 
  so the governor 's spot is without a candidate , like 2 weeks before election . 
  since no one has a good candidate , frank has a talk with vp , former governor . 
  vp says that he does n't like being vp and he would much rather be a governor again . 
  so frank talks him into the election . 
  now the vice president seat is free , free for frank . 
  it was frank 's plan the whole time , he knew that the vp would n't compete with any good candidate , so he just made a top one and then destroyed him . 
  how could they vote on the parliamentary procedure if they did n't have a quorum ? 
  i 'm not familiar with us senate practics so this is kinda beyond me . 
  i understand now , thanks for clearing this up for me !, 
  [ and for the fun of it , even more ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgg6sdt.jpg ), 
  what about maternity benefits ? 
  in our country , if you had for example $ 1400/month before maternity , you will get about $ 900/month for from the state . 
  so it is a paid job . 
  what if you could select audio only option only after you 've watched the ad ? 
  i hope you are just talking about the normal internet and not the mobile one , because in our country we have 200 mb/2 gb/5 gb tariffs for mobile data . 
  or you can buy extremely expensive unlimited one . 
  do you still have the file ? 
  i believe that adding monochromatic noise would give better result than the coloured noise .
