  but still , very good job !, 
  i did n't know this was n't a global thing !, 
  # 62/month here - unlimited internet , sms and minutes if you sign up 24 months contract , which is indeed kinda expensive for me . 
  ahmed angel 's dad ? 
  in what year we wo n't be able to say that ? 
  yeah , this is amazing , but you do n't get a notification when map choice pops up . 
  i usually just click that i want to join match and then alt tab , so another notification would be nice . 
  do you have any tips on how to earn up so much money easily ? 
  i see tons of fiverr people offering the same or better service than i would . 
  what would make them want to choose me , with no reviews at all ? 
  just reached 15k achievement points a few days ago . 
  going for 20k now ( unexpected i know ) . 
  it is certainly not a scam , i made couple hundred dollars in past 6 months with erli bird . 
  definitely check out / r/erlibird, 
  i disagree with you, 
  you will be able to use karma for paid ios/android apps , movies , music , books on audible / kindle , games on steam etc. 
  amazing !, 
  thanks !, 
  i thought about this so many times . 
  i just want to show the world how beautiful my voice actually is , instead of that ugly one others hear when i 'm speaking . 
  too bad it 's pronounced eh-fell . 
  why you do n't want a photoshop ? 
  so much to do , so much to see, 
  i 'm a racing car passing by like lady godiva, 
  it 's the eye of the tiger , it 's the thrill of the fight, 
  i was wondering if drawing the scene in photoshop would be ok , so i guess it is . 
  i use [ darker ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mlhg.screenfilter ), 
  wish my fitbit could do that . 
  how much do you earn per week ? 
  well there is a thank you note card and some stickers you can use yourself . 
  the rest is pretty much unusable , if you do n't plan on using their services , however it 's very nicely packed . 
  you can always [ go here ] ( http://us.moo.com/partner/sample/#2013 ) as well and they will send you 10 free sample business cards with your own design . 
  it 's not really some crazy old script . 
  writing in cursive is still taught at czech primary schools . 
  however , since 2010 , we have an alternative called the [ comenia script ] ( http://www.lencova.eu/cs/gal_ukazky_cs ) taught at our schools . 
  they put the kangaroo in the pouch . 
  i hate m\u016fstek , it always smells gross . 
  x-posted to / r/adporn, 
  only for ios users though !, 
  1 ticket to hype train please, 
  personally , i 've chosen 1 month of reddit gold . 
  i 'm really glad we got those rewards now and they are n't even much expensive . 
  i ca n't say that without caps . 
  that was fucking awesome !, 
  let 's get the referral train going !, 
  used yours , here 's mine : http://www.comfortableboxers.com?kid=55ay2, 
  also , they seem to be shipping only us & canada . 
  more importantly why is ` w ' pronounced ` double u ' rather than ` double v ' ? 
  that 's an amazing photo !, 
  best i could do my friend : http://i.imgur.com/mc5bzpi.jpg, 
  [ her ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/2saelo/psbattle_ferret_in_a_tube/ ) grandfather fought in vietnam, 
  note that it 's photoshopped , made for [ battle # 143 `` president swag '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/2s2e98/battle_143_president_swag_via_previous_winner/ ), 
  if you wan na try erli bird , make sure to czech out / r/erlibird . 
  you just made me check that number . 
  vodka vodka eh eh, 
  i shall disagree with you , look at how many forms of `` be '' we have in czech :, 
  some of those have a different meanings in different tenses , i just wanted to write all the forms . 
  [ couple 's reaction to a surprise maroon 5 & ac/dc concert at their wedding . 
  it is . 
  you can even do this in ms paint . 
  open up the picture , right click it and select invert colors . 
  when does this offer expire ? 
  when i order something from some na site which ships only to na , i use a service which will ship that item to me from na . 
  the shop ships the package to the service and they send it to me . 
  maybe you have something similar for sweden as well . 
  but it might be late already to make a deal with them as they might already have contacted the other winner . 
  the most famous one is probably borderlinx, 
  10am january 19, 
  this was my 2nd ss i 've participated in . 
  last year i got an amazing gift ( from original santa ) . 
  i really loved the ss so i told many friends about it and 15 of them joined in this year . 
  13 of them had to be rematched and only 1 received a gift , other 's santas just pulled their info on around january 1st and never showed up again . 
  only 3 told me that they will join next year 's santa . 
  i have n't received a gift from my original santa so i got rematched . 
  my santa retrieved my info only once ( last was 11 days ago though ) so i 'm just trying to not lose my hope but i do n't really expect anything anymore . 
  the problem is that the person answering is friend 's giftee . 
  she should n't be even sending the gift to my friend , but to her giftee instead . 
  she just thinks that matches a and b give gifts to each other . 
  and she probably thinks that joining the exchange is tentative . 
  secret santa definitely needs tougher registration policy . 
  maybe something like only the ones who completed at least in 1 exhange in the past can participate . 
  those who have n't participated and still want to join , they 'd have to pay e. g. $ 10 fee . 
  redditgifts would give those $ 10 back if they successfully completed the exchange . 
  if they would n't send the gift , redditgifts could give the $ 10 to the person who got stiffed , for example in form of redditgifts marketplace credit . 
  us only . 
  how much will that 1000 coins get you ? 
  a bullet , [ still have it . 
  `` do you want to ... '', 
  and then she stopped , was like nevermind and we never spoken to each other ever again . 
  i still wonder what she wanted to say . 
  i believe earth is called terra in italian and maybe in few other languages , so you can basically call it terra . 
  gielinor . 
  i think that wingardium leviosa would work just fine . 
  how many traffic signal technicians does it take to change traffic light lightbulb ? 
  none . 
  most traffic signals are now equipped with led light sources , so there are n't many incandescent lamps left out there in some locations . 
  common sight in the u.s. is red and green led modules and incandescent lamps in the yellow indication in older installs . 
  new traffic signals have yellow led units . 
  led modules use just a fraction of the energy needed for incandescent lamps and will last for around 10 years .
