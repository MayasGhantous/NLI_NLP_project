  i like trees, 
  i ca n't help myself , but whenever i see a girl spreading her legs like this , i just ca n't stop thinking of frogs .

  i think this is worth sharing, 
  got some screens from aurora glade , everyone was on the top of lion statue and then we decided to move on top of the bank . 
  it was awesome . 
  well , the age difference might be a lot bigger ( even few years ) if the kid failed the classes . 
  since frank is not a congressman anymore i do n't really care about the congress .

  well done , the guide looks very comprehensive and clear . 
  i 'm amazed , this must have taken a long time to write all the stuff down .

  i disagree once again , do n't lose hope , look at this statement from erli bird founder :, 
  and when exactly did you see 30 focus groups in a month ? 
  i get around 12 focus groups/month , so it 's not that big of a loss for me . 
  now we have karma rewards , remember that , you can get some gift cards from that which are worth some money or you can exchange them at / r/giftcardexchange, 
  to be honest , i 've never seen any company which would pay more and more money over time . 
  sure , the average month income from erli bird might be reduced , but i believe it 's still a really good money and for me , it 's a fun way to make money ( this might not apply to all users though ) . 
  i 'd like doing it even if the rewards were halved . 
  also i still believe that the 3 days limit will go away with the revision of the focus groups system .

  if you 're signed up in insider program and have w7 , you now have update to win10 technical preview in your windows update .

  anyway , does anyone know how they knew i 'm in insider ? 
  i would understand it with windows 8 , but in windows 7 i do n't believe i have my microsoft account linked anywhere . 
  relevant revenant might had been taken even before pax . 
  i joined this year ss with few of my friends , out of 10 , only 2 received their gifts . 
  every friend left including me was rematched , but after that . . nothing . 
  few of us got their info pulled on ~ january 3rd but that 's it . 
  because it sounds really cool and revenant is n't anything unique to gw .

  i know you were , i 'm just saying that eventhough our numbers are pretty big , it 's still a smaller amount compared to other mmos .
