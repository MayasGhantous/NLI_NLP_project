  do you have cards linked ? 
  i earn only about $ 1/week . 
  amazing man , thanks a lot !!, 
  first time 69 , just yesterday , did n't go as well as expected though , she was ultra wet and my face ended up covered in lady juice . 
  sounds exactly like my dad . 
  also a book titled `` how to use the word ` their ' properly . '', 
  is a good read . 
  ** zkundyksicht ** is a good one , meaning `` face from a pussy '' . 
  i am much less favourite than i thought . 
  i prefer it to be less messy . 
  and to be clear , she was already ultra wet before the 69 . 
  `` the road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties . '', 
  `` welcome back . '', 
  i hate kirsten and love kristen . 
  do n't study for the tomorrow 's test , it will be rescheduled .

  thought i will post here , but then i saw your post . 
  how long does it take to earn that $ 1 ? 
   ... despite what happened during the first donation cycle . 
  what happened during the first donation cycle ? 
  the skipping stones . 
  bad thing about these cool things i could say is that once it hits the frontpage , that particular day is usually over .

  i 'd rather not tell as it 's not marked as nsfw here . 
  is n't there a global ( europe ) alternative ? 
  i own fitbit . 
  we made you . 
  i got maxim year subscription as a gift from my girlfriend and i could n't like it more . 
  this really depends on which maxim we are talking about , i 've never seen the us version , but czech is very interesting with almost no ads . 
  how 's this ? 
  sure, 
  i 've done some professional photos in the past so i thought why not put them up there ( 47 photos ) two months later , not a single sale . 
  photos have average rating of 4.8 so i do n't really think they 're bad . 
  i also have few followers , but . . not a single sale . 
  not sure if it 's because of bad tagging or just because there are millions of other photos . 
  still , i do n't really recommend it , the time i spent selecting , uploading and reviewing was definitely not worth it . 
  average wage ( not minimum ) in europe is about $ 39/day . 
  i know that the expenses are much lower , but still . 
  as i said , it 's european average ( west + east countries ) , e. g. czech republic ( middle europe ) has a hdi which is quite good ( high ) = 0,873 , yet the minimum wage here is $ 1.98 / hour ( approx $ 20 a day ) . 
  average here is about $ 5/hour . 
  netherlands has 4rd highest wage in europe out of 50 countries , no wonder the minimum wage is so high .

  can you do haiku ? 
  in our country , we say this joke with firefighters ,

  i 'm taking my girlfriend to hooters , so i 'm basically doing exactly what i want to do on the valentine 's day . 
  the best thing is that it was her idea , she likes boobies . 
  is this instagramed enough ?

  us only, 
  i know about whitepins but they only pay out like 20 % people and do n't care about the rest . 
  flag it as us only , i believe that only united states-affiliated institutions can register . edu, 
  you can get one on californiacolleges.edu , but most of the sites offering things for . edu owners already banned it . 
  how much can you earn per week ? 
  no downtime update is n't just anet 's thing , i 've seen that happen in more games , even before gw2 . 
  you can take for example runescape , no downtime at all during updates and you can get back to playing in like 5 minutes ( reloading the client ) . 
  i know it 's not really the same thing as runescape downloads the game continuously while playing , but the servers are just like any other online game . 
  that 's really nice and stuff , but i have this app for like 10 days now and i 'm only at 1600 points ( $ 1,60 ) after downloading and trying about 20 apps . 
  definitely not worth it , at least not in my country . 
  this ^, 
  the moment i see a mesmer dodge , move back or sideways , i ctrl+t him immediately . 
  just stay at the same spot facing the opponent or run forward him , just like the clones do and i 'll probably not recognize you maybe even for a few seconds .

  you ca n't simply stop playing warrior as a main if it was your first character . 
  `` recently '', 
  any program that will allow you to do more than 1 action per 1 key/mouse press is n't allowed . 
  i usually just google `` sout\u011b\u017e o '' ( meaning `` contest for '' in czech ) and set it to only show results from this week . 
  i do that every other day , i 've started in september and i won many prizes already : fitbit flex , genius hs-g250 , 4 movie tickets , gift cards ( t. m. lewin , van graaf , h&m ) , pc games ( far cry 4 , gta v ) and so on . 
  it 's really worth the time . 
  i regret that i soulbound my 1st legendary instead of selling it and making a new one with profit . 
  those are absolutely incredible !, 
  i think they 're perfectly normal .
