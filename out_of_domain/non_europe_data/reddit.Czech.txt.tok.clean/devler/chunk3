  for tequatl join one of these guilds / r/ttscommunity [ na ] / r/txs / [ eu ] . 
  they do it regulary and they kill it basically every time . 
  there still might be gta v for ps4 , 
  how come no one mentioned a legendary weapon ( cost of one of these is 1000g + ) . 
  i do n't think that starting trading on tp at lvl 18 is a good idea . 
  yeah probably a good idea , 
  does the warrior 30 tactics xii trait ( vigorous shouts ) works-heal you when someone other uses shout ? 
  i like the wallpaper , it 's truly amazing , 
  but try this with the logo :, 
  delete that logo and use this white one instead : http://i.imgur.com/jcgim0u.png, 
  place logo and delete the black background of it ( if there is ) , resize it if needed, 
  open blending options and set blend mode to overlay, 
  duplicate the logo layer 2 times so you have 3, 
  in my opinion , the result will be much better , 
  are you sure ? 
  it 's a picture of white logo above white background , so you ca n't really see anything until u place it somewhere . 
  oh , try that overlay trick with blending options i told you , 
  my favourites :, 
  [ straits of devastation ] ( http://rewalls.com/pic/201104/2560x1440/rewalls.com-29016.jpg ), 
  [ a trap foiled ] ( http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/938129520147301215/5261ea368ed82a1dcb21da066f7c01a7eaaecf61/ ), 
  [ frostgorge sound ] ( http://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/3/36/frostgorge_sound_loading_screen.jpg ), 
  people tend to play only with heavy classes , that 's it . 
  back in time anet confirmed that zephyr sanctum is the highest spot in tyria that can be jumped off . 
  i hope they will expand the area of labyrinthine cliffs and make it permanent . 
  oh come on this ca n't be ingame shot , i 'm sure you just went outside and took it !, 
  this looks amazing !, 
  how to join a public test ? 
  does it mean that at 2pm a option to enter eotm will appear in wvw panel ? 
  there should be a trade option for trading between players, 
  [ runescape ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=runescape+trade&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=fc3huvkdbklv4gss6icadg&amp;ved=0cakq_auoaq&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=808#imgdii=_ ) had it pretty covered, 
  they will be completely the removing glory system , so spend your glory now , 
  check this out - [ player vs. 
  player rewards roadmap ] ( https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/player-vs-player-rewards-roadmap/ ), 
  how exactly will eotm work ? 
  i mean it 's a big map and if it would be only 3 servers against themselves , the map would n't fill up when it 's basically only a queue for a lot of players . 
  i 'd like the idea better if blue would be some 3 servers , green other 3 servers and blue other 3 servers . 
  or is it gon na work this way ? 
   due to the size and scope of the final four story releases in season one , the next round of major features will be bundled together into a large `` feature only '' release that will come after the first season of the living world 2014 has finished . 
  so eotm will probably come after that . 
  yeah they 've said before that eotm scores will not count in normal matches . 
  gather orichalcum/ancient wood logs or some t4 and lower materials . 
  do n't gather t5 , it 's really cheap now . 
  check out tp for prices of mats . 
  do dailies , monthly and buy heavy crafting bags from laurel vendor , each one cost 1 laurel and contains 3 t6 mats . 
  dailies also provides mystic coin , which you will need too . 
  do cof , ac , hotw and/or more dungeons which u like . 
  you will get golds/drops for buying more mats and also tokens . 
  use tokens to buy cof and higher rare dungeon armor ( 30 tokens each ) and salvage them with mystic/black lion salvage kits . 
  you can buy exotics with lower than cof dungeon tokens too . 
  you will get mithril ores and globs of ectoplasm and with exo, 
  if you have some obsidian shards , mystic coins , globs of ecto and skillpoints , make mystic clovers . 
  with this `` recipe '' you will get either mystic clovers ( needed for legendary ) or some t6 mats ( needed for legendary too ) . 
  do living story , champion trains , invasions , world bosses . 
  you will get rares and mats . 
  i do n't know anyone who made his legendary all from his supplies . 
  count with the fact that you will have to buy a lot of materials instead of farming them all , thus you need a lot of gold . 
  never buy/sell anything on tp instantly . 
  make wise and good offers . 
  you will save/earn money . 
  if you still want to get mats by yourself , i highly recommend this guide : http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/1p2dgc/guidet6_material_acquisition_guide_updated/ by nightsfrost . 
  also , use this guide to make more money out of all currencies : http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/1ocogi/guide_converting_your_currencies_to_gold/ by eirh , 
  the thing is that people who got it from mf will recommend you to do mf and people who were n't lucky at mf and/or bought it will recommend you to farm golds to buy it . 
  i got my dawn from daily mystic forge ( forging the cheapest rare swords ) . 
  i would say that those ways take on average the same money getting it . 
  you can either be lucky at mf or not , tp is surely safest , but forge might be much cheaper , it only depends on luck . 
  how long can one poi hold you from getting a legendary ? 
  like 2 minutes and cost of like 3s for a wp ? 
  that 's the least , i think that lack of karma for obsidian shards or golds is much worse . 
  alright , now i get your irritation . 
  still this is a nice reason why to capture it and gain some points for your server , try hard for it !, 
  i see it this way :, 
  gold for this guy !, 
  enjoy the game until somehow you get a precursor from daily forge . 
  that is the least painful solution to start with . 
  why there 's not already an item in gemstore for moving soulbound items/making soulbound items account bound directly ? 
  with every update which had a bigger effect to the area around , they changed skybox too . 
  i dislike only two things :, 
  thread author is not highlighted enough, 
  related subreddits should be opened as default, 
  yay yay !, 
  do n't use tp and use private mail . 
  let them pay you first , then it 's 100 % secure for you and you have 0 % tax . 
  beware of scamming though . 
  what if the key for stopping scarlet is downvoting her ... 
  but expansions have usually more than than just 2 new zones and 1 playable race . . 
  i 'd be definitely okay with your idea because i love it and i need a big update already to the game , but i still do n't think that this is better than an expansion . 
  as warrior , i usually go to cereboth waypoint ( kessex hills ) , go to ettins , equip rifle ( rifle butt skill ) , set all utility skills to interrupt skills ( bull 's charge , kick , stomp ) , aggro a lot of ettins and everytime i see they do the skill with long cast ( the one when mace glows yellow ) i interrupt them . 
  easy done in less than minute . 
  edit : ettins , thank you , 
  i do n't want these fools interrupting the final ritual . 
  get your tails in gear . 
  it 's up ahead . 
  my attemp :, 
  how it would probably look ( 1440x900 ), 
  there 's definitely gon na be an attack in la. 
  another confirmation :, 
  great work , 
  how it would look on subreddit ( 1440x900 ) :,
