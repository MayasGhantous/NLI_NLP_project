  i see $ 9,5 , so i guess us only offer . 
  thanks !, 
  here 's mine :, 
  how come you make so much ? 
  i have a dollar after 10 days . 
  almost every man *, 
  women usually start with scissors , 8/10, 
  february 23rd, 
  i had to sign this . 
  mass debate . 
  i wear 3 pairs of jeans on which i 've spent about $ 450 and i do n't regret it . 
  3 pairs of jeans will last me about 2 years and then i just apply warranty and exchange them for 3 new pairs . 
  that is why i do n't buy $ 30 jeans , because most of the shops just wo n't give you a refund ( at least in my country ) . 
  they will just say it 's my fault that they have a hole in crotch - that just happens to me with every single piece of jeans . 
  after many failure attemps on returning the jeans , i just said screw it and bought $ 150 levi 's 511 jeans . 
  they are much more comfortable and they look better than all jeans i 've ever owned . 
  and whenever they have a hole in them or something , i just exchange them for a new pair . 
  maybe you 'll find it here at some point :, 
  does californiacolleges.edu work ? 
  source on that ? 
  have you met ted ? 
  i played with zack 's penis , and touched it a little .

  [ look at my guide of do n'ts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/2ft0oa/for_the_upcoming_wvw_tournament_how_not_to_wvw/ ), 
  ted mosby could talk about few pretty bad weddings . 
  but that 's the task . 
  i 'm not sure if `` reasoning '' is the correct english equivalent . 
  too bad you ca n't have it minimised on the main device . 
  it is pretty cool but only for one person . 
  you ca n't do your own stuff on main device while someone is playing on the other one . 
  go on ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you get me wrong . 
  i 'm just sad that it ca n't stream minimised gw2 . 
  i ca n't play e. g. battlefield while my friend plays gw2 . 
  it can only stream what 's happening on the screen . 
  i know it is . 
  but i mean , the game is still rendered even if it 's minimised , so why it ca n't be streamed to other device ? 
  i know about remote desktop connection , teamviewer and splashtop and have n't seen this feature . 
  could you please show me how ? 
  and it rhymes !, 
  your breath stinks like a mammoth 's rectum . 
  mr. bean and charlie chaplin . 
  good luck guys  let the most random one win . 
  wow thanks , 
  every single czech attemp was/is rather cringeworthy ( voyo , topfun , ... ) . 
   they have to find a cd drive to access it, 
  man i feel so old . 
  he 's in the trailer , not in the ending cutscene . 
  your boyfriend should post this up to / r/tifu, 
  ow , too bad . 
  it 'd definitely hit the front page . 
  one day ... 
  [ globaltestmarket ] ( https://www.globaltestmarket.com/join.php?contact_email=&amp;utm_source=gtm&amp;utm_medium=refer_a_friend&amp;utm_campaign=friendreferral&amp;utm_content=text ) is definitely your best choice . 
  it takes a few minutes to set up , but i am currently receiving at least 2 surveys per week and i 'm not really from some marketers interesting country . 
  i redeem ~ $ 50 every 2-3 months, 
  you definitely should . 
  i started with this site about a year ago and did n't bother filling in the profile and i did n't receive any surveys . 
  few months later , i created a new account , but this time i completed the profile surveys . 
  and bam , day later i received my first survey for reward . 
  i honestly do n't know , sorry , mine was listed there . 
  is cae english sufficient for them ? 
  i 'm from czech republic , where most of the beermoneymaking sites do n't work ( swagbucks , perktv , bing rewards , screenwise trends panel , mindsumo , etc etc ) . 
  but this works for me , just wait a few days , i get a survey like every 3 days so just be patient . 
  $ 150 , now i have 145 points on my account = $ 7.25, 
  7 months, 
  this year we only had snow for like 7 days ( czech republic ) : /, 
  this is most certainly a bug as my account history [ works alright ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n7bcktx.png ) . 
  i have n't done tap2know though . 
  contact the support . 
   ** how can i contact the erli bird ? 
   team@erlibird.com, 
  you have to request , and as the wiki says `` there is a $ 1 fee from erli bird for payment requests < $ 15 . '', 
  if you request payout for more than $ 15 , then there 's no fee ( only from paypal ) . 
  is this international ? 
  you can earn anywhere from $ 0-10 . 
  i get about $ 7/focus group on average . 
  never received a reward smaller than $ 4 . 
  honestly , they usually are n't . 
  cash rewards come about 1-5 days later . 
  requesting payout to paypal is immediate . 
  why not skrill or payza ? 
  i think they 're much more popular . 
  work on yourself . 
  you can study new languages , read interesting history articles , read literature or watch the current news ( politics , economics mostly ) so you know what 's up . 
  or try some / r/beermoney making . 
  it 's at [ this page ] ( https://erlibird.com/focus-groups ) under balance & payment information - save payment info button . 
  - good night with a kobra . 
  for $ 40 , i 'd say that best investment would be in cryptocurrencies , you are n't guaranteed any profit though . 
  good thing i do n't have any ... oh shit, 
  if mike wazowski opens up an ice hockey arena it would be called monsters rink . 
  since i suffer from peripheral neuropathy at this moment , i ca n't control left half of my face ( i ca n't blink with one eye ) . 
  so i can see entirety of any film . 
  take that !, 
  who 's in charge of voting the best psychics ? 
  i 'm in . 
  hey , i have a problem with boot animations . 
  i replaced the old one with my new one ( with right dimensions ) in / system/media and gave it the right permissions ( rw-r -- r -- ) . 
  still , when i reboot , it shows the old animation ? 
  any chance you know where the problem is ?
