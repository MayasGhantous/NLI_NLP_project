  pmed, 
  i bought 10 referrals few days ago . 
  only 4 of them actually logged in woc after i bought them , and that 's it . 
  they 're inactive since then and they earned me exactly $ 0.00 . 
  could n't reproduce the 404 error , but i fixed the link anyway . 
  thanks !, 
  100 thumbs up / u/changetip, 
  i 've looked through some of your posts and you totally deserve it !,

  they need some time ( about an hour ) to get working after you bought them . 
  they call it colonization . 
  are you sure it 's not it ?

  sorry but did you say that the conversation made your hole weak ? 
  congratz to orange logo !, 
  only paypal , sorry . 
  also , 44 % does n't really affect the drops that much . 
  for example , if an exotic has a 1 % chance of dropping , having 100 % mf would increase that chance to 2 % . 
   update v1 .6, 
  - the bot does not get stuck at `` login successful '' anymore ( only for people who had activated the `` gaming theme '' of the website ), 
  you can either download the 1.6 version ( http://www.mediafire.com/download/hl6ukh19h26rthx/warofclicks_bot_v1_6_by_chillivanilli.zip ) or stop using the gaming theme on woc .

  4k interface is big compared to 16k . 
  take a look at this 15360x8640px screenshot :, 
  i 'd just recommend you not to do it on purpose . 
  play the game and you 'll eventually get higher mf ( by salvaing blues and greens etc ) . 
  investing in luck ( buying rares/exo and salvaging them for luck ) is n't really profitable . 
  according to the patch notes , 1.5 should work only on white theme , not on the dark one . 
  i 'm really interested in this . 
  can i ask for more general info ? 
  any tips on getting and maintaining such mustache ? 
  i 'd love to get a mustache like that , but i simply can not overcome the pencil mustache phase , where the mustache is short and ugly and i just have to shave it .

  out of my all 19 mines , 11 are completely inactive . 
  you do n't recycle those either ? 
  but recycled ones can make you money , no ? 
  i thought that recycling means that i will get a new one instead of the one i want to recycle .

  yeah , it 's after the fight between frank and claire on the plane . 
  my girl friend did a similar thing to me . 
  instead of baking brownies , she said she will send me pictures of her standing naked . 
  to fully understand this , naked is `` nah\u00e1 '' in czech , which sounds the same as `` on h '' when pronounced . 
  so i just received a couple of pictures of her standing on letter h. 
  i am currently shopping with my girlfriend . 
  * goes to youporn *, 
  i actually really enjoyed this movie . 
  us only ? 
  thanks !, 
  i seem to understand it way more now , 
  thanks a lot for the explaining , makes sense !,
