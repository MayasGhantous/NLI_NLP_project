  i love this !, 
  it 's like 300 % better than the first take , however the sb on the right looks kinda squashed . 
  i 'd decrease the width of it a little - something like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/equfk0h.png ) , but that might be only my personal opinion . 
  how do you do those ? 
  do you use any special software ?

  where is that scene ? 
  and frank is crying . 
  there is one more evidence :, 
  there is one episode when frank and tom yates are drinking and frank says `` the last time i was this drunk i broke into a library . '',

  chapter 8 of house of cards is that chapter about breaking into that library . 
  she was n't even supposed to play such a big role in the series . 
  they liked the way she plays so they just wanted to show more of her . 
  i never really liked her so [ spoiler ] ( / s `` i do n't really care she 's dead now . '' ), 
  the subreddit theme looks a little different too !, 
  sasha is not only male name . 
  i have 2 girl friends named alexandra and oleksandra and we both call them sashas .
