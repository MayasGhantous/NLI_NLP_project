  i guess i can take spending beermoney on my girlfriend as an investment . 
  please take my upvote of cuteness . 
  i always visit pret a manger when i 'm in the uk . 
  would be nice to have it here as well . 
  it 's even easier with chrome . 
  you just right click the image and select search . 
  i did n't get any popup at the end of the first video . 
  i know that hitleap is legit for sure . 
  maybe it 's because english is n't my native language but it took me only like 0,5 sec to realize how to say them . 
  ohh harrey , do n't staaahp . 
  had a first date with my girlfriend as a couple , we went on a walk too some woods , had a picnic and stayed there for couple of hours , watching the sun going down and later stars at the sky . 
  later on , it was kinda late ( about 1 am ) , so we decided to pack things up and i decided to walk her up to her apartment . 
  on the way , my best girl friend texted me `` i 'm watching you . '', 
  she was kinda silly so i did n't really paid any attention to it . 
  i replied something like `` oh yeah right . '', 
  then she send me another text saying `` i 'm not joking , i 'm seriously watching you . '', 
  i walked my girlfriend home and i decided to go home as well . 
  at like 2:30 am , i was waiting at the bus stop for my bus to go home . 
  more than 1 hour long ride home . 
  this will be really boring , i thought to myself . 
  i was n't really tired and did n't feel like sleeping in the night bus ( lots of drunk and rude people ) . 
  bus arrived , and out of fucking nowhere , there she was , sitting in the bus , the girl who just texted me that she is watching me like 10 minutes ago . 
  i was extremely frightened because this looked way to creepy . 
  she then explained she was going home from a party nearby . 
  then we spent all ride talking , because she lives like 1 minute away from me . 
  do you happen to drink a lot of mineral water ? 
  how often and how much do you invest ? 
  pm 'd, 
  i 'm not any professional or something , but i can give you my opinion/advice : use less bevel and emboss , it does n't really look that good . 
  i really like your works though !, 
  yeah , but it 's a conic section , specifically parabola . 
  you need to solve 2 xs for that, 
  and it was designed by czech architecture company called atelier sad . 
  although i have to agree with you , i found a reaction picture quite appropriate to post here, 
  can i see the book ? 
  it only offers me download , no steam key . 
  it 's now much less feminine than the original and more unique and good looking , great job !, 
  i still do have one suggestion though . 
  try how would the logo loog if you removed the negative space between h and d. something like http://i.imgur.com/t4fka4o.png, 
  on the first sight , it looks more like lool to me . 
  i visit it pretty often . 
  we have a vacation house nearby and also there is the kviff ( karlovy vary international film festival ) every year which i can not miss . 
  me neither . 
  it 's a special new type of focus group they have been working on for some time . 
  they 've sent out these invitations via email . 
  i love your mineral water !, 
  i 'm from prague by the way . 
  you have to enter the captcha pretty frequently though , like every 10 minutes or so . 
  definitely [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uee_mcxvrw ) . 
  it 's freeky . 
  i had a lucid dream only once . 
  as i was a pubescent little jay , it of course ended up with having sex , no questions asked or given . 
  i got question for all of you who are experienced with lucid dreaming , can you study in your dreams ? 
  like memorising the study materials , practicing speech etc ? 
  i wish i had that much money so i could buy flowers every week to keep my home smelling fresh . 
  yeah , they would love to have a word with you , / u/genida . 
  [ also worth looking at . 
  ] ( https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/our-products ), 
  i 'd suggest you to just play the game . 
  you wo n't burn out from the grind , thus it 's the most effective way . 
  and you will be surprised how quickly the mats/golds come . 
  the colored one is better . 
  but i think there just way too many dots . 
  how would it look like if you kept only the top 120 \u00b0 of the dots around the t ? 
  bottom right looks definitely the best . 
  for anyone wondering,
