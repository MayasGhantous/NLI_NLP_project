  you 're quite correct , sir . 
  why do n't they just have a couple of stairs next to each other ?

  could you please make a bot which posts [ this gif ] ( http://i.imgur.com/b1nipz5.gif ) when someone says `` bottom '' ? 
  could be called the bottombot . 
  nipples are n't sexual ? 
  then why girls get aroused when you touch them ? 
  it 's because your feet are erogenous zone . 
  i think you could be able to use image trace so you could enhance the quality and enlarge it . 
  edit : well , since the quality is crap , it might be a little harder than that , but this is the untouched result when i used the image trace on one of the icons ( 10 seconds work ) : http://i.imgur.com/zicuneh.png, 
  i used to get 2 per week , 0 for the last 2 weeks . 
  us only . 
  make a website and put ads there . 
  do you still need it ? 
  would you rather wait 30 minutes for 1 unranked match ? 
  i already sometimes wait about 5 minutes for a match . 
  how long would i wait if there were more filters on who should i be against/with ... ? 
  i could n't get the arc welder to work . 
  whenever i try to run an app , it shows loading circle and then nothing .

  reinstall somehow worked , i `` can '' start the apks , but they are n't working , i get the puzzle with :( icon . 
  unfortunately, 
  they bring you the customers and you pay them for it , what 's the problem ? 
  if you do n't want them to do it , start your own website , advertise your services on craigslist etc. 
  are the new maps ( dry top , silverwastes , verdant brink ) made by a different artist ? 
  compared to the old maps , the new ones are much more confusing and not really that helpful .

  you can get about $ 6/h from it with the search terms jobs ( you basically search for some stuff on google and the fill out the info ) . 
  it 's really boring , but it 's easy and anyone can do it . 
  you can watch some series or listen to something while you are at it . 
  you also might find some more interesting jobs listed on there , depends on your luck and location ( i guess ) . 
  it 's been more than 2 months since my data got purchased . 
  i guess they do n't want my data :(,

  tonight , we 're not eating at mcdonald 's !, 
  well , it ` works ' in other countries as well ( czech republic ) , but when you want to redeem , they block your account . 
  note that if you 're android user , bestreviewapp kinda sucks now , i 'm getting like $ 0.5 / week . 
  it 's great for ios though . 
  the logo looks really good to me though !, 
  why is it for native english speakers only ?

  unfortunately , they do n't have a similar offer for my country :(,

  hobos who actually live there .

  kinda like the louis vuitton logo . 
  this is now called mid range graphic card ? 
  better upgrade my pc ... 
  kinda reminds me of assassin 's creed . 
  brags about material design , has holo app icons . 
  `` push harder '' i shouted at my wife while she was in labor . 
  `` screw you '' she screamed back at me . 
  bit harsh i thought ... . it was n't my fault the car broke down on the way to the hospital . 
  steam id : loritori, 
  i played gta since i was really young , could n't play the new ones because of outdated hardware . 
  i finally upgraded my pc but i do n't have the money for this game , so thanks for the chance !, 
  do n't take this offensive but you just placed a not really good looking logo ( and it 's not even any similar to the original ) on [ this wallpaper ] ( http://funmozar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/house-of-cards-quotes-wallpaper-24.jpg ) . 
  is the stronghold avaible to play now ? 
  the second female human style looks perfect . 
  $ 15 + / hour seems really exaggerated to me . 
  on average , you get about $ 6/hour . 
  i 'm not saying it 's impossible , but if you will do it at this speed , you will burn out pretty fast . 
  if there is any other job than searching for the search results , take it . 
  they usually pay much more too , but they do n't appear really frequently . 
  no idea why it was removed . 
  a guide for clickworkers . 
  is it international ? 
  `` go away anna ! '', 
  put the stuff you buy in your bag/purse while you 're still shopping and have n't paid for it yet . 
  eat any burger bigger than bicmac .
