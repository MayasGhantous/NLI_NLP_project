  tell that to my girlfriend . 
  all i want is to smell like spring and she keeps buying me perfumes that smell like gasoline/petrol because she loves the smell of it . 
  you feel discouraged to do so because of your gender ? 
  men actually work at hooters , just not in the waiting section . 
  morning wood !, 
  i love it !, 
  the logo itself is just perfect , however the mockup looks kinda boring to me . 
  it looks like it could be transfered easiy to vector via image trace . 
  they are , but you can sell it to the vendor . 
  i 've heard that they unlock the beta the time you got it , so once you 've got it , you can sell it . 
  my grandpa lost his finger . 
  when i was a child , he told me that he lost it when he was picking his nose and the finger got stuck in it so they had to amputate it . 
  i never picked my nose ever since . 
  hey nancy , it 's jenny !, 
  the logo is good . 
  the text as well . 
  but they do n't go well together . 
  you need to unify the design . 
  it does , but only if the background color stays . 
  it would n't really work with white . 
  however , the globe is still very dominant . 
  how about using some darker colors ? 
  this looks really interesting and i 'd love to participate , however i 'm unfortunately not from the usa/canada . 
  i think i 've read somewhere that it 's because you 've already watched the video a lot of times so the advertiser is not interested in you anymore . 
  or not accidentally, 
  we sat a hacky sack on fire and played with it . 
  ended up with a second-degree burn . 
  here you go, 
  everything is about sex . 
  except sex , sex is about power . 
  us only ? 
  either 17 or 42 . 
  we call it `` paris cake '' , not sure why , it 's chocolate , creamy and fucking delicious . 
  it 's like tasting the happiness . 
  bonobo has sex 60 + times a day .

  i have just one thing, 
  i do n't have the tablet mode on . 
  or what do you mean ? 
  yes it 's a desktop . 
  it looks normal when chrome is n't maximised , only when i maximise it then it goes weird . 
  can i get a key , please ? 
  * ^ i ^ had ^ to ^ try ^ it . 
  how do i change that ? 
  this is how tablet mode looks like : http://i.imgur.com/kqhvw9b.png, 
  there is none unfortunately . 
  i 've already looked for it . 
  nope , does n't work . 
  just cause collection, 
  thanks for the chance !, 
  til rockstar has an instagram . 
  where do i buy this ? 
  roses are red, 
  violets are blue, 
  yarrow is yellow, 
  snapdragon is orange, 
  petunias are pink, 
  sedium is purple, 
  dead nettle is green, 
  clematis is white, 
  found one !, 
  it 's $ 5 . 
  i do n't think $ 7/month is a good price . 
  take it this way , new office comes approximately every 3 years and they cost about $ 160 . 
  that 's $ 5/month . 
  i know the $ 2 difference is n't big , but it would make me consider subscribing to it . 
  now i am just using 2013 . 
  well not anymore thanks to you . 
  i think it works actually good here but let me give you an advice for your start : be careful with gradients . 
  i 'm glad you wrote good amout of claps . 
  does the logo have a depper meaning or is it just random ? 
  the font & color choice are perfect though . 
  only for :, 
  san francisco bay area, 
  seattle, 
  new york city, 
  los angeles, 
  here 's mine : http://bitgold.com/r/jswovn , 
  runescape has something like that, 
  fucking content aware fill tool, 
  bilzerian 's daily routine . 
  these are the best countries to invest in :, 
  this is n't true all the time . 
  i 've actually never seen a store where women section is more expensive . 
  i frequently go shopping with my girlfriend and i 'm amazed how normal underwear can be cheap . 
  whereas men boxers cost $ 6 + , she buys her usually for $ 1 . 
  f u, 
  white definitely . 
   very smooth skin, 
  since when do men say this for describing a hot girl ? 
  people did not get the butt joke ? 
  definitely looks more like dsn now . 
  in stores i always check to make sure the mannequins are fake . 
  i 've seen enough prank videos to be paranoid around them for the rest of my life . 
  do n't put the tl ; dr on the beggining !, 
  interesting story though !, 
  have you found your so already ? 
  a or b ? 
  those are expensive !,
