  is it this thing ? 
  i never knew i wanted this , but now i want it so fucking bad . 
  i 'm sorry , i do n't love you . 
  why did n't you keep me , mom ? 
  i really loved the aero glass look , but now when i 'm used to w8/10 , it looks really outdated . 
  always go with roxanne . 
  that 's the strategy . 
  sounds expensive , but i 'll definitely buy it in the future . 
  put it in mouth, 
  yeah it is . 
  ... hurt me . 
  do hurt me . 
  please more . 
  floor . 
  everybody walk the dinosaur . 
  honestly , it 's the worst feeling i 've ever had . 
  it 's annoying and painful and i ca n't sleep . 
  guaranted : earn 3,000 + satoshi ( $ 0.01 ) in just few minutes . 
  that seems really low . 
  most websites pay at least the $ 0.01 per 1 ad .

   if vatican city were your home instead of czech republic you would ... 
   * be more catholic, 
  seems about right . 
  how can you make money of it ? 
  that shadow looks kinda ugly . 
  could you make it more material design like ? 
  it 's slower than it used to be , but i think you can make $ 5 in 5 days . 
  not the chargerpay , it 's 100 % passive .

  $ 7 for reading an article is ridiculous . 
  it 's a scam . 
  i 'm hungary for more !, 
  how long does it take to get $ 10 ? 
  also , i found myself running out of ideas on what to type in the reviews , how long are your reviews and how do you prevent this ? 
  too bad there 's nothing to review for me at the moment :(,

  you should be the one who sends the money first ( choose someone with good slrep profile ) since you need the favor .

  / r/slrep is a subreddit where redditors using / r/slavelabour have their profiles . 
  they post the transactions they 've done on the sub and the people they 've done them with confirm them . 
  for example my profile : http://www.reddit.com/r/slrep/comments/2y2p30/udevler_sl_network_rep_profile/, 
  i know about http://www.androidopinion.com/ for android and http://www.myappaware.com/ for ios . 
  when you use 2 devices with same account/paypal , you get points on both , but only one will count ( the other will reset ) . 
  so definitely not more than 1 device per account . 
  however , i talked to baul about having more devices doing chargerpay and this was his response :, 
   `` it 's certainly something i 'd like to see happen in the future , but we 've got some other enhancements on the table right now . '', 
  you can review both android and ios apps from your account . 
  referral train ? 
  i 'm not a waiter , but i worked as a store assistant in levi 's . 
  people always thought they do me favor when they are folding the jeans back in the pile . 
  unless they did it correctly ( which happened in maybe 1 out of 100 cases ) , it was my duty to find where they put it and fold it correctly . 
  it could be so much easier if they would just hand it to me . 
  it is for [ tiny prints ] ( http://www.tinyprints.com/email-choice.htm?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=tpemail&amp;utm_campaign=manual&amp;utm_content=0514mdaygiftremv4hero&amp;cid=em-mktg-tp-051415mdaygiftremv4-73753 ) , you have to pay the shipping though . 
  agreed , jan-mar i earned $ 116 . 
  that 's the highest amount i 've ever managed to get . 
  europe :(, 
  not really sure if any of these would help because of so little time given . 
  all pay out to paypal though .
