  pick me pick me pick me !, 
  my deadly , but still cute loritori :3, 
  no , there 's no risk . 
  overlay does n't do anything with game files , it only shows you what 's currently on the website . 
  wednesday is bug fix day , not update/patch day , 
  dude this is amazing !, 
  i really appreciate your work , 
  about 6g . 
  for the first time i 've decided to do daily forge with rare gs and it got me dawn on the first forge , 
  it 's not better than an expansion yet . 
  void juuuuuuuuuuump !, 
  i actually had pretty good time doing dungeons even with 3 + guildies . 
  they 're usually skilled , more synchronised and just know what to do because they 're probably on their own teamspeak or something , 
  i just say it 's sometimes better to take the risk instead of doing a simple path for an hour . 
  i 've posted basically the same petrified a few days ago on guildwars2funny , 
  alright , let me get this clear . 
  so you are saying thay you 've missed the original deal , but the original deal is every year , from december to end of february . 
  you say you got in touch with their support team . 
  actually , here http://www.artscow.com/unique-code you can get your own code without any need of support , you can name it anyth\u00edng you want - for example gw2mousepads . 
  you could have said that this order is for everyone , not just some elite gw2 reddit stuff , anyone can use it with a code you get when you register ( like z099player7hv or something ) , and you can create a mousepad with any photo you want . 
  do n't take this as a hate post , i 've advertised these a lot too and got a lot of money from people making orders with my code . 
  just wanted to clarify some things , 
  you need to get yourself one mousepad before you can buy anything with credit dollars , 
  [ original post ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/grandtheftautov/comments/1uuidn/rgrandtheftautov_banner_contest/cenchnb ) with how it would look like here , 
   healing signet passive reduced by about 8 % ( ~ 30hps ) , active may be improved / altered, 
   crit damage as a percentage stat will go away . 
   balanced to be about 10 % less damage overall . 
  nooooooooooooooooo !, 
  your work is just amazing , 
  how many lines of dialogue you have already ? 
  i wonder how many could anet fit in this game . 
  queensdale first !, 
  how come everything seems so real in black and white/sepia . 
  and how it would look ( 1440x900 ) :, 
  what happened today to the gem price ? 
  commercial for levi 's jeans !, 
  split the party , everyone takes one corner and fifth guy ( preferably mesmer/thief ) can stealth , teleport etc between . 
  plus the things others have said already , 
  what is currently the cheapest way to do agent of entropy ? 
  open gw2 shortcut properties , add - maploadinfo add the end ( `` c : \\ program files ( x86 ) \\ guild wars 2 \\ gw2.exe '' - maploadinfo ) and save . 
  next time you load something you will see at the bottom left how far is your loading , eventually where it got stuck . 
  sure but that 's not really effective when i want to get about 100 ap . 
  i know right, 
  ninja dodge and levitation moving please !, 
  * signet of restoration is restored to full power ( no more pve/pvp split ), 
  * armor of earth cooldown goes from 90s to 75s ( pre-cantrip mastery ), 
  * 3 seconds of regen added to water trident ( for up to 5 allies ) - support + condi removal for scepter, 
  * burning speed now evades during cast !, 
  ( more melee survival for d/d ), 
  * frozen burst is now a blast finisher !, 
  ( can combo with burning speed ), 
  * ~ this is a non-exhaustive list , full set will be in patch notes . ~ *,

  i 'd like to take this time to point out the worst change in this update !, 
   to mitigate performance issues , items that summon pets now have a 30-minute cooldown . 
  exactly , bye bye my beloved ember :(, 
  i do n't think so . 
  the teaster image will probably be on the spot where is a trailer now . 
  do we know how long the timer is ? 
  should be working ok , 
  is there a reason why it 's just in the middle of underwater nowhere ? 
  or is it just because it 's `` well '' hidden ? 
  it would be faster to wp and go back than using an orb . 
  she managed to hide a whole damn tower in the middle of kessex hills . 
  yeah but he is not inside , 
  nasty . 
  thank god we 're doing this . 
  on ag we got pretty same results as in a tequatl fight ( 95 % left when timer ended ) . 
  you 've made my day , sir . 
  inquest golem mark ii no longer lands , it is now deployed . 
  join one of these guilds :, 
  * [ txs ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/txs ) ( europe ), 
  * [ tts ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ttscommunity ) ( north america ), 
  these guilds do tequatl runs several times a day at a success rate of pretty much 100 % . 
  i find this legendary calculator the best you can use , you might try it yourself , 
  4 times here on aurora glade , 
  updated ? 
  is there something new i am missing or is it the same week old release page ? 
  gather orichalcum/ancient wood logs or some t4 and lower materials . 
  do n't gather t5 , it 's really cheap now . 
  check out tp for prices of mats . 
  do dailies , monthly and buy heavy crafting bags from laurel vendor , each one cost 1 laurel and contains 3 t6 mats . 
  dailies also provides mystic coin , which you will need too . 
  do cof , ac , hotw and/or more dungeons which u like . 
  you will get golds/drops for buying more mats and also tokens . 
  use tokens to buy cof and higher rare dungeon armor ( 30 tokens each ) and salvage them with mystic/black lion salvage kits . 
  you can buy exotics with lower than cof dungeon tokens too . 
  you will get mithril ores and globs of ectoplasm and with exo globs of dark matter which u might find useful later , 
  if you have some obsidian shards , mystic coins , globs of ecto and skillpoints , make mystic clovers . 
  with this `` recipe '' you will get either mystic clovers ( needed for legendary ) or some t6 mats ( needed for legendary too ) .
