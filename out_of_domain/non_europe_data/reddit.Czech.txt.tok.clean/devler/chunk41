  slightly lighter colors would make it perfect . 
  yeah , the windows should be viewable , but i do n't know if they can figure out if you really have them viewable . 
  i run it practically all day long , about 12 hours , when i 'm awake . 
  you can make about $ 1 a day . 
  thanks !, 
  feel free to message me if you have any questions . 
  confirmed !,

  that 's awesome !, 
  thanks !, 
  glad you like it !, 
  i mean , it 's not perfect , but it 's definitely not as bad as you say . 
  top comment on that page accurately expresses my thoughts :, 
   those stripe applications are super cool . 
  though , my eyes are still recovering from some of those type/colour/pattern combos . 
  i know i do .

  for some weird reason , pollbuzzer.com does n't show me any balance too . 
  but via e-mail they 've sent me a different link ( https://panel.cint.com/ ... ) and bam i already have $ 12 sitting there . 
  this is a thousands dollars worth logo !, 
  really good job , i love it !, 
  the man in a suit with a hat looks like a racketeer to me . 
  do you watch john oliver by any chance ? 
  i leave all the rights to the client after the payment . 
  many surveys have this thing called `` attention check '' , where they ask you in one question to mark a certain answer . 
  if you do n't mark it , they will disqualify you . 
  pay attention to the questions and answer moreless truthfully . 
  even though it might seem that it is slower , you will actually get more surveys successfully completed and you will also get more surveys in the future . 
  sure !, 
  hit me up via pm . 
  just out of curiosity , if you do n't mind me asking , what do you need that for ? 
  as long as your current system is fine , you 'll be able to simply upgrade . 
  my system files were somehow damaged after all those years of using the win7 so the upgrade failed every time and i had to do a fresh install .

  the / r/logodesign is a multipurpose subreddit , designers share their logo design tips , they share good logos and study them , they criticise each other 's works and they discuss good and bad logos . 
  the ad should hopefully bring more designers , business owners etc to the subreddit , so they can learn and teach . 
  i love it . 
  it 's definitely my favorite one in this battle . 
  the only thing that is n't really working here is the monkey face in the white version .

  looks much more like dc to me . 
  i would n't say it 's less worth , i just ca n't transfer the money on my own . 
  i have several problems with this logo . 
  the idea is good , the execution is not that good . 
  1 ) the circle is n't round . 
  2 ) i 'd definitely loose that black stroke around the ellipse . 
  3 ) the colors look dated and retro . 
  if that 's intention then it 's fine . 
  4 ) do n't save in jpeg . 
  those artifacts do n't make a good impression on anyone viewing the logo . 
  5 ) top left corner of the p is sharp , whereas the bottom corners are ( at least they look like , ca n't really tell ) round . 
  for a letter in a circle , you should stay with round corners . 
  here 's what i meant in my suggestions : http://i.imgur.com/lgofd6g.png, 
  introducing jagex 's and anet 's most favorite player : / u/gw2moneypit, 
  we have a winner, 
  put this on / r/gamedeals, 
  absolutely love it . 
  to be honest , this logo would look good 10 years ago . 
  like / u/tsupaero said , start fresh . 
  do you have a portfolio you could show ? 
  i 'm rolling on sunshine . 
  * woooooh *, 
  they pay in . com cards . 
  they 've paid me over $ 50 , i have n't had any problems with redeeming . 
  when you 're collecting supplies and someone casts invisibility , collecting gets interrupted . 
  did n't they change the reward to only 0.025 g ? 
  1:1 actually, 
  8 at the moment, 
  bitgold is not a cryptocurrency . 
  it 's a market where you can invest in real gold . 
  that 's awful . 
  the logotype is n't centered .
