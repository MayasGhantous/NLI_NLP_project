  there is an expansion coming in the upcoming months , but i do n't see a reason why you should wait . 
  gw2 is definitely worth buying right now . 
  it 's on 50 % sale on amazon at the moment . 
  excuse my french , but i would play the shit out of this . 
  ** easy : ** warrior , ranger , guardian, 
  ** medium ** : necro , mesmer, 
  ** harder : ** thief , elementalist , engineer, 
  myself , i play warrior since launch and i absolutely love it . 
  fill the white space in `` e '' . 
  i have 2 problems with this logo . 
  first , in what program is the logo made ? 
  the quality ( no smooth edges ) are hurting my eyes even in the small version . 
  this needs to be improved . 
  second , decide if you want to go with round or sharp edges . 
  both does n't look good . 
  the idea is very good though , i like that . 
  i ca n't see what the brand name is from this logo . 
  if i had to choose , i 'd pick number 5 . 
  with a bigger text . 
  what font is that ? 
  what hardware you need for windows hello to work by the way ? 
  that 's gross . 
  how much ? 
  we have a deal . 
  i do n't think that out of my 76 referrals , only 4 have earned something . 
  where are you from ? 
  that might be the problem . 
  that map looks really sophisticated , too bad it did n't make it into the game . 
  i do , but i can see a better way to invest this amount of money at the moment . 
  you can achieve that very easily in illustrator . 
  just play with the brush settins for a a while . 
  set the roundness to about 40 % . 
  space rangers . 
  not that old game ( only 13 years old ) but i fucking love it .
