  it gives you about $ 2-4 per day , minimum payout is $ 5, 
  * [ prolific academic ] ( https://prolificacademic.co.uk/ ) - does n't disqualify you once you got the survey , payout is # 5 and you can manage it pretty quickly , best for the uk , but works worldwide, 
  * pollbuzzer [ ref ] ( http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=y3a3mhzdewhteu5wtzfdduphmfn3zz090 #sthash . uroxr6ok.dpuf ) l [ no ref ] ( http://pollbuzzer.com ) - pays very well , $ 1 for each question answered, 
  * clixsense [ ref ] ( http://www.clixsense.com/?3980171 ) l [ no ref ] ( http://www.clixsense.com/ ) - probably your best choice , a lot of surveys , many offers , minimal payout is $ 6, 
  * bestreviewapp [ ref ] ( http://www.bestreviewapp.com/welcome.php?n=8o423 ) l [ no ref ] ( http://www.bestreviewapp.com/ ) - you review ios/android apps for money , $ 0.5 - $ 10 per app review, 
  also , offering your services at / r/slavelabour and / r/forhire could get you really quick money . 
  we are actually talking about more than $ 40 in a week if you can offer some good services people want . 
  reserving ties to the machine , not to your account . 
  probably only on / r/slavelabour and / r/forhire . 
  the sites i mentioned usually have some pending time before they send the money . 
  for example 48 hours with earnhoney so you would actually have to make all the money today , bestreviewapp pays only on fridays ... 
  i know for sure that instagc and prolific academic have basically instant payout . 
  you can try those . 
  these days more about $ 3 , i run it whenever i have my laptop/pc on , which is about 12 hours a day . 
  my only involvement is to check it once an hour , two hours if everything is running . 
  if it 's not , i just refresh the page . 
  i 'm getting a $ 5 amazon gc every other day . 
  seems like you got really lucky at / r/slavelabour . 
  wish your sister happy birthday for me !, 
  i usually just keep 4 tabs ( which i found optimal ) of videos open and check it from time to time . 
  that might be kinda dated . 
  i 've seen reports from few european countries that the ads started to appear for them . 
  i would n't recommend this without virtualbox . 
  * sorry our campaigns are filled at this time . 
  we will notify you when a new one is available . 
  how long before and how much of pineapples you need to eat anyway ?

  in the time you are waiting for the requests , you can create a fake company logo , book cover or something so you can show it to your next potential customers . 
  people will want to see what you can do before they give you a job , eventhough the portfolio wo n't be for real customers , it can show how good you are . 
  they 're working for me .

  why not just put your arm around the girl ? 
  i 've heard that if you tilt your head back and pretend you 're shaking a salt shaker into your mouth , you will actually taste salt . 
  that is truly beautiful . 
  i really like that !, 
  are you serious ? 
  that 's amazing , thank you !,

  design-wise , widows 10 still needs to be improved a lot . 
  i am already offering $ 8 for the trade , $ 18 reward seems like a bit too much . 
  will do . 
  thank you . 
  since we started the treatment very early , everything should be alright soon . 
  i see . 
  and would you mind going first ? 
  looks really good !, 
  is there a difference when i write a long , quality review vs. 2 sentences review ? 
  cashout is to paypal ? 
  why not turn it off then ? 
  you are looking at 2005 's best boy scout in the czech republic . 
  i feel like it 's the opposite of movies . 
  every time the main character is in danger , there is one big silence .

  i think that anet deserves that that this post outnumbers the `` do n't pre-purchase heart of thorns '' with upvotes . 
  they normally have sales ( t-shirts and stuff ) for just the $ 25 . 
  unfortunately , they are sold out at the moment . 
  were n't when i posted the link though . 
  still see one left !, 
  ref train ? 
  how much can you make out of homepage.exchange ? 
  that does n't really seems to be worth it . 
  i 'm czech and i totally agree with you . 
  qwerty is really annoying .
