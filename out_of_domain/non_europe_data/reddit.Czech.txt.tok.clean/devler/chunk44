   to show our excitement we are offering 0.25 g ( approx . 
  $ 9 ) of free gold in our bitgold golden heart \u2122 referral program .

   hi - we recently became aware that some users were unable to join the clipcard mac focus group . 
   for many , it was reported upon completing the beta application that the beta was not available in your location . 
  this was a bug , and we 're sorry about that . 
  we would not send you the invite if it was not applicable to your location . 
  however , unfortunately this specific focus group is now closed for new users . 
   please know that in the coming weeks and months , you will see much increased activity and many more invites in your region . 
  over the past few months , we 've been working on our new platform . 
  during that time we 've focused on larger betas in the us as we 've had limited resources to take on many projects . 
  we are almost complete with our new platform and again expanding back internationally . 
  trades must involve gift cards . 
  no posts or trades that only involve cash/cryptocurrency/prepaid credit cards . 
  well , you can sign up , but you ca n't send or receive any money . 
  limitless made that awesome though .

  i guess so . 
  looks like things will get started again soon . 
  us only , am i correct ? 
  i got about 30 of them on the first day ( about 3 hrs of farming ) . 
  it was very worth it back then because they cost about 90s each .
