  cake me cake me cake me, 
  exactly , the fact that i like playing with your nipples does n't mean i enjoy you playing with mine . 
  it 's good , but the sides are too dark . 
  i like the original much better , but the changes you 've made look very real to me , so good job . 
  how did you make those said `` goosebumps '' ? 
  i actually like it with them , a lot . 
  did you just sharpen the whole thing up ? 
  third of the offers on / r/slavelabour are graphic design related . 
  it should n't be this way , difficulty of graphic design is really understimated , but it is that way . 
  adobe photoshop , if client wants vector file , then illustrator . 
  i 'm glad i could help !, 
  you might want to work on the contrast a little . 
  i 've tried it . 
  it 's a really good program , but i 've never got used to it . 
  it 's very powerful , but i believe that photoshop has more to offer , especially when it comes to photo manipulation and it 's also much more well-arranged ( at least to me ) . 
  i can do it as well , feel free to hit me up if no one fulfills it . 
  you might want to check some lithuanian sites . 
  product testing sites usually are n't international . 
  i seem to be the only person who actually likes the london 2012 logo .

  same with us nuclear weapons system, 
  but that blue definitely needs a lighter shade . 
  it 's barely visible . 
  once you play gw2 , you 'll probably dislike all the current mmos for their old fashion gameplay . 
  that 's why i love and hate gw2 . 
  sure !, 
  here it is :, 
  then of course i get paid the price of the app + $ 5 . 
  agreed , i 'd also keep the original aspect ratio .

  excellent communication , fast payment . 
  great to work with !, 
  if you are not sure , try search . 
  let 's hang out with don draper . 
  i do n't have ssd , the boot took about 1 minute on windows 7 , now it takes about 25 seconds . 
  that is correct . 
  but upgrade from 7 to 8 cost money . 
  now i really want to see your shoes . 
  can i ? 
  it looks like a logo for a press related business . 
  it looks old fashioned and boring . 
  it 's a really big step back from the [ tokyo 2020 candidate city logo ] ( http://i.imgur.com/57wrkaa.png ), 
  it was truly an amazing site . 
  there is now a similar site called gokano , where you can get stuff pretty easily ( for now , same with lockerz , it will become harder with more people join ) . 
  for just answering a daily question and daily login you get points and those points you can turn in things like electronics , gadgets or accessories . 
  i 've already gotten a t-shirt from them ( remember lockerz 's z-list ? ), 
  because i became a gold member ( invite 30 friends ) . 
  the prized are n't really expensive either , for example , you could get 2 16 gb 3.0 flash drives per month for just logging in and doing daily questions . 
  next restock will be on 5th august . 
  you can try it here : [ ref ] ( http://gokano.com/ref/iusdqj4l ) l [ no ref ] ( http://gokano.com/l ), 
  happened to me as well when i wanted to install the insider build . 
  i had to do a clean install . 
  confirmed !,

  it took me a few seconds to read it . 
  first i saw rea dea , then red deal . 
  i like the idea though . 
  the branches are too big compared to the square and text in the middle . 
  also , connect create innovate does n't sound like a name ( is it even ? ), 
  but i guess you ca n't do anything with that . 
  their said it will take 4-6 weeks . 
  i 'm at 6 now . 
  should i wait or contact them ? 
  if i had to choose , i 'd go with the first one . 
  i 'd simplify it .

  / r/beermoneyglobal, 
  the text just does n't work . 
  it looks forced . 
  start with changing the font . 
  a - there are two tips ( on each flame ) , they should n't really be there . 
  this part should be smooth . 
  b - the bottom edge of the m is so small . 
  you should cut it when it 's still big . 
  we should really more triangular shape than just two sides merging into one line . 
  c - same with b , but this just needs to be adjusted only a little . 
  for those who ca n't view it on youtube :,
