  i did n't know i was attractive . 
  first week on my high school , one girl told me that half of her class had crush on me . 
  i 'm now much more confident around girls and such . 
  i guess the confidence is the key , because even though i probably was attractive even before this event , i could n't get much girls since i was kind of shy .

  2 ) take them to starbucks, 
  this is my favorite one,
