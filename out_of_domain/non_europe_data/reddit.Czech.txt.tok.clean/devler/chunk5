  do living story , champion trains , invasions , world bosses . 
  you will get rares and mats . 
  i do n't know anyone who made his legendary all from his supplies . 
  count with the fact that you will have to buy a lot of materials instead of farming them all , thus you need a lot of gold . 
  do n't focus only on your legendary or you will get bored really quickly . 
  if you have a mood for some wvw , activity or fractal , just do it . 
  still you get rewards for basically everything you do so you wo n't waste your time completely . 
  never buy/sell anything on tp instantly . 
  make wise and good offers . 
  you will save/earn money . 
  if you still want to get mats by yourself , i highly recommend this guide : http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/1p2dgc/guidet6_material_acquisition_guide_updated/ by nightsfrost . 
  also , use this guide to make more money out of all currencies : http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/1ocogi/guide_converting_your_currencies_to_gold/ by eirh , 
  [ rytlock 's critter rampage is what you 're looking for !, 
  ] ( https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/rampage/index.html ), 
  my biggest question is , will there be soft and hard cap so i could join my friends via party chat ? 
  or you can join [ txs ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/txs ) . 
  this guild does tequatl few times a day , 100 % guaranteed kill , 
  too bad you were n't wearing [ sclerite karka shell ] ( http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/sclerite_karka_shell ), 
  psa : you do n't have to grind the achievement , you 'll eventually get it in a few days just by playing the game . 
  i do n't think that the release page is shorter than some of the previous release pages . . for example , compare this, 
  * https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/january-21-2014/, 
  with these, 
  * https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/may-14-2013/, 
  * https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/february-2013/, 
  * https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/march-2013/, 
  i do n't think he was dying all the time , he just jumped back in the sea every time . 
  they might have some shipping delays due to huge amount of orders . 
  mine mousepad did actually arrive last week, 
  try to send them a ticket with your paypal printscreen attached that you 've already paid , no confirmation emails etc. 
  what is a throwaway account good for ? 
  the commander tag above your head is quite useful , but since you ca n't see your own name and title , there 's just a f * king huge gap between your character and the tag , ugly . . 
  100 on ag eb , i actually thought there 's a 100 cap because i could n't believe that queue is exactly 100 . 
  [ this ] ( http://cdn.windows7themes.net/pics/the-game-client-is-unable-to-gain-access-to-the-login-server.jpg ) is my first impression . 
  oh my god i want this ingame !, 
  10 fractals , 2 skins since fractured, 
  i do n't think so , but i 'm actually pretty surprised you still can get them from store since from what i 've read you wo n't get them by doing daily/monthly . 
  the same . 
  happened to me once too , 
  and yesterday in eotm it was the same for our blue team . 
  great for achievements !, 
  i used to do it with salvage items , but now they are extremely expensive . 
  gather orichalcum/ancient wood logs or some t4 and lower materials . 
  do n't gather t5 , it 's really cheap now . 
  check out tp for prices of mats . 
  do dailies , monthly and buy heavy crafting bags from laurel vendor , each one cost 1 laurel and contains 3 t6 mats . 
  do cof , ac , hotw and/or more dungeons which u like . 
  you will get golds/drops for buying more mats and also tokens . 
  use tokens to buy cof and higher rare dungeon armor ( 30 tokens each ) and salvage them with mystic/black lion salvage kits . 
  you can buy exotics with lower than cof dungeon tokens too . 
  you will get mithril ores and globs of ectoplasm and with exo globs of dark matter which u might find useful later , 
  do living story , champion trains , invasions , world bosses . 
  you will get rares and mats . 
  never buy/sell anything on tp instantly . 
  make wise and good offers . 
  you will save/earn money .

  [ how to wvw ] ( http://guildwars2.ro/ghid-wvw.pdf ) by theongreyjoy . 
  the empress sounds , well , damn good !, 
  what 's with the diacritics ? 
  i would do it this way : karka queen would have respawn timer of like 3-4 hours so all settlements would be 3-4 hours karka-free . 
  after the time passed , pre events would start , karkas would try to capture settlements ( they might or might not succeed ) , and players would have to secure the settlements the way it is now for karka queen to be spawned . 
  oh yes please !, 
  they 're really annoying and repetitive now . 
  they said they 've learned from the last attack on la lag ( the lost shores ) so we can hope for the best . 
  i hear the voice of a banker even in my sleep : what do you want ? 
  those poor moas !, 
  what will happen to them ? 
  yeah they actually confirmed it would be pretty much just like this . 
  i go outside . 
  cut off zezima 's internet, 
  wait a year or two, 
  try to get this name for your new character, 
  get on a top by using a experimental rifle : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1kkc-l75yu, 
  or do a void jump ( much harder though ) : http://imgur.com/a/4vq8z, 
  make it for android then i 'll be interested . 
  why would na population be smaller ? 
  in case one new map was added : 1 borderlands would not be enough , 2 borderlands would be perfect but it would n't be fair , 3 borderlands are more than needed imo . 
  i would be okay with the idea of deleting 2 borderlands and replacing them with new maps . 
  gmt late afternoon . 
  guys !, 
  i think the lion knows what is going to happen to la !, 
  i can tell by his horrified face . 
  when the orr is cleansed , we should be able to get by ship to the crystal desert . 
  or queen jennah can open the gate since tyria is not safe anymore . 
  http://imgur.com/a/4vq8z get to the `` water '' found here , jump in it , swim under the bank , log out , log in and you will be ported on top of the bank , 
  edit : or , you can go all the way up to the first experimental rifle jump , but you choose a way leading to the bank and then you can use the rifle to jump on top of the bank , 
  this, 
  seems like anet got us very well excited . 
  big style on top of la bank :, 
  parties everywhere . . 
  im all out of faith , this is how i feel, 
  you 're a little late , im already torn, 
  this is the most annoying image upload site i 've seen in the past few years . 
  oh this is great !, 
  this way you can tell which events have you completed already ( for the achievement ) !, 
  and when you enter daily activity and you exit after/during a game , you get teleported on the ground , not back on the airship . 
  ticket wasted . 
  i want to be like scarlet !,
