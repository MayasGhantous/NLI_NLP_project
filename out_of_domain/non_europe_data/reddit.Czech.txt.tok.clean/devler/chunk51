  i am sure . 
  it takes about 1-2 minutes . 
  you install the app , you post a review to google play and then you uninstall it . 
  i 've done several $ 10s . 
  most of the reviews are paid much lower though . 
  well , as you can see in the payment proof , i managed to get $ 122 just in 2 months ( for like maybe half an hour of work ) . 
  if i had ios , the earnings would be doubled . 
  it 's not a bad moneymaking , but as i said , you do n't get the $ 10 reviews all the time . 
  most of the times it 's just $ 0.5 . 
  i usually get to review about 2 apps a day . 
  / u/changetip , send $ 6.5 !, 
  confirmed !, 
  it 's more like adobe lightroom . 
  it 's very good software though , you can do almost anything as you can in lightroom . 
  this is how i imagine orwell 's london to look like . 
  not here !, 
  the school !, 
  you will break it !, 
  - said no kid ever, 
  how much did these teeth cost ? 
  not available for me .
