  same for me . 
  apparently also [ no pornhub in russia ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9287849/russia-blocks-pornhub-porn-sites-censorship ) . 
  i thought vkontakte is a social network like facebook . 
  have you tried bestreviewapp [ ref ] ( http://www.bestreviewapp.com/welcome.php?n=8o423 ) l [ no ref ] ( http://www.bestreviewapp.com/ ) or gokano [ ref ] ( http://gokano.com/ref/iusdqj4l ) l [ no ref ] ( http://gokano.com/ ) ? 
  bestreviewapp - [ more info here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyglobal/comments/3eov42/reviews_bestreviewapp/ ), 
  gokano - that 's exactly what they do , you do n't make money , but the prized are very good , i got sony headphones from them and now i 'm getting moto 360, 
  globaltestmarket or prolific academic do n't . 
  i do n't think these things are big enough to be seen . 
  it 's night in the us/asia while it 's day in europe/africa . 
  it 's just nightlight . 
  ** prolific academic ** [ ref ] ( https://prolificacademic.co.uk/rp?ref=l48gkjxn ) l [ no ref ] ( https://prolificacademic.co.uk/ ) - works global , they does n't disqualify you once you got the survey , payout is # 5 and they post surveys very frequently , you just have to check for them yourself , they do n't notify you via email, 
  i 've seen this on their website before . 
  it 'll get fixed . 
  i have 62 referrals on clixsense at the moment , equals to about $ 16/month passive income . 
  you 're actually one of my best referrals , so you have my thanks . 
  that 's some really quality stuff . 
  good luck !, 
  til, 
  this wo n't be a critique of your work , but rather of the mockup template you 've used . 
  if you are showing this paper mockup to your clients , you might consider a better one . 
  on many occassions it just looks like a picture placed on top of the paper , not like a picture actually being on a paper . 
  i can send a different one i 'm using if you are interested . 
  make it in your local language if it 's not english . 
  igritte in the streets , wildling in the sheets . 
  i 'm at 576 at the moment so i 'll try getting a moto 360 . 
  the amount of prizes is low , but that does n't mean it 's impossible to get stuff . 
  my friends and i actually got a few things from them already ( including gold member t-shirts ) . 
  i missed the prize i wanted which was steelseries riv , so i got sony headphones on the second try . 
  my friends got hp z4000 mouse , 16 gb pendrive and one more sony headphones . 
  problem with this is that the company who owns the game also technically owns your account and every single stuff on it . 
  including currency . 
  they just `` lend '' you the account for you to play . 
  99 % of the times this is illegal and getting banned is the smallest thing you can get . 
  still they can be legally enforceable . 
  that is correct . 
  everyone should at least get the gold member rank , you can then accumulate 120 points each month without any more referrals . 
  that will help you get better prizes by a lot . 
  the terms of service can be held as a binding contract in a court of law . 
  if you violate that contract it is prosecutable in civil court . 
  especially jagex has been known to take gold farmers to court for thousands of dollars in fines, 
  what, 
  i believe that out of all top entries , only the third one fulfilled the requirements . 
  the other ones are beautil , some of them are even prettier than the third one , but they could n't really be used in real life . 
  edna ?

  today is laundry day  . <, 
  honestly , i 'd not trust a moneymaking website with this design . 
  this is just like anders de la motte 's book called geim . 
  [ spoiler ] ( / s `` there were `` dares '' like commit an assassination '' ), 
  i know it is . 
  but if you want it to look serious , it will need a redesign . 
  you ( and your ref links ) could be hundred times more successful , trust me . 
  it 's for google 's screenwise trends . 
  i just got moto 360 watch . 
  too bad the shipping time takes so long , wish it could take less time . 
  they send out the prizes at the beginning of the next month . 
  monthly . 
  it 's this site called ** gokano ** [ ref ] ( http://gokano.com/ref/iusdqj4l ) l [ no ref ] ( http://gokano.com/ ) - you log in every day and answer one simple question . 
  for that you are getting points . 
  you can exchange these points for cool stuff from t-shirts and headphones to ps4 or moto 360 . 
  restock happens every month , they say a date few days before , but not the hour . 
  you have to check for yourself , but every single time yet it happened around 19:00 cest . 
  rewards are unfortunately gone pretty quickly too , everything is gone in like 7 or so minutes . 
  thanks a lot , ca n't wait to get it . 
  thanks . 
  better luck next time !, 
  the best rewards are out in less than minute , but the other ones like pendrives usually last a few minutes before they are gone . 
  i 've redeemed sony headphones last month . 
  i think this is all about good timing and patience . 
  you have only a little window to get a desired prize , but it 's definitely not impossible . 
  i also recommend using browser 's form autocomplete feature so you do n't have to type the shipping details . 
  and to your question , no , i do n't work for gokano . 
  a month . 
  i have about 220 . 
  somewhere about 220 . 
  mostly from referrals . 
  reddit actually . 
  there are threads on / r/beermoney asking for moneymaking methods . 
  i just post some sites ( including gokano ) they might be interested in . 
  moo is amazing . 
  i order all my bussiness cards from them . 
  ( or a thousandaire ) **, 
  love it , but you might want to play with the mockup a little bit . 
  this is not what page header looks like on facebook . 
  you do n't have a name , description and the frame around the profile photo is bigger . 
  i know this is not so much about the logo , but it would give it a more real feeling . 
  looks like something i 'd buy . 
  good job !, 
  i 'm saving my kidney for my girlfriend , who was born with just one . 
  and that one does n't really function properly after all those bar crawls . 
  i 'm not sure what all is needed to be compataible , but i have blood type o so at least that 's one thing .
