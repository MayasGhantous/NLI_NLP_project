   let 's add some glamor, 
   let 's add some volume, 
  i really laughed at these, 
  logotype definitely . 
  how you like me now by the heavy, 
  i do n't like the combination of normal g in square with wide gant text . 
  it just does n't go well together .

  is this international ? 
  is there a font like that ? 
  and how much you need to get paid out ? 
  the icon fits the text very well . 
  well done !, 
  and how long does it take to get paid ? 
  what bothers me the most is that the width of b counter and o bowl are different . 
  normally , they should n't be . 
  but when you put them so close to each other , it looks a little off . 
  i believe it will give you a pop up that you have unactivated product . 
  hooters will bring the economy down . 
  i just discovered this sub thanks to it . 
  kerning needs to be fixed and so does the color choice , but otherwise it 's pretty cool . 
  i enhanced the wallpaper by / u/venirto, 
  sure thing !, 
  they still owe me $ 30 in gift cards from july . 
  bestreviewapp is missing proof : http://i.imgur.com/fwr7ieo.png, 
  do you have the owner 's rights to upload the video or do you make your own content ? 
  and where do you get the free content from , if i might ask ?

  that 's awesome !, 
  what typeface is that ? 
  same . 
  it looks more religious than medical related to me . 
  i 'm actually your customer , i go to chicago grill every once in a while . 
  new logo is looking good ( the one on the 2nd picture ) , but the flame could be a little bigger . 
  confirmed , looking forward to work with you again . 
  swimming pool and week sounds a little dirty in french too . 
  i still remember this number so many years after i 've heard it last time . 
  really depends on where you live . 
  i spend about $ 50/semester . 
  20 bottles of beer .

   ** trade completed with : ** / u/torley _, 
   ** items traded : ** $ 25 amazon gift card vs. $ 21.25 on paypal, 
  confirmed !, 
  thanks for quick exchange . 
  this is how full branding is done . 
  well done montreal . 
  are they smiling ? 
  now that you said it 's a dragon , i can see it . 
  but at the first glance it 's definitely a pig mask . 
  definitely looks more dragon like than before . 
  you posted three same links . 
  it 's called a swash . 
  i like the third one the most . 
  the voleball fits very nicely . 
  much better than in the other two cases . 
  it 's the same reason why people pay for the online webcam shows . 
  it gives them the feeling that they 're in charge . . and actually get an innocent girl to send them their used panties . 
  it looks really 2000-ish . 
  here 's my quick take on it : http://i.imgur.com/ojsqahr.png, 
  future is now . 
  do n't switch to blue . 
  just use a different shade of green . 
  green is associated ( thanks to excel ) to forms , sheets and tables . 
  you should go with it . 
  where can i find the affiliate program ? 
  i got it . 
  are you sure you want to go with a round font ?

  ok , let me know what ( if ) they respond . 
  i thought it was supposed to be $ 1 a day . 
  it 's still pending . 
  takes a lot of time , huh ? 
  good work !, 
  are they all for real clients ? 
  why not brown + gold ? 
  i did n't know you had to fill in the w9 until i tried to cash out .
