  they did n't mention it earlier . 
  levi 's jeans . 
  i mean , their refund policy is great ( i buy new jeans every year for free ) but they should last much longer than a year . 
  someone please recreate it as an adult . 
  [ relevant google doodle ] ( http://www.google.com/doodles/605th-anniversary-of-prague-astronomical-clock ), 
  you sure about 15 ? 
  i 've heard it was around 3 minutes . 
  part of the new prague 's borough called waltrovka , which is being built in the place of former aircraft engine factory . 
  [ video and more information here ] ( http://www.pentainvestments.com/en/real-estate-project/waltrovka-aviatica-64zfjj.aspx ), 
  how big the meal plan is ? 
  for a week ? 
  a month ? 
  also , based on / u/mrfish31 's comment , do you have any references ? 
  any progress photos ? 
  i worked with this guy , he 's trustworthy . 
  his work is awesome and definitely worth more than a fiver . 
  this is really great offer for you guys . 
  will do !, 
  thank you for your spare key , 
  what does it stand for ? 
  looks more like `` no '' to me , which is n't really what you 'd want i guess . 
  love the overall design though , very clean and sleek . 
  they pay out on fridays though . 
  dishes apparently do n't do themselves . 
  how about making the middle z part ( the one which connects top to bottom ) vertically straight ? 
  i 'd say blogging . 
  i have a blog , which does n't get many views ( like 7000/month ) , but it 's unique , which gives me almost priority status . 
  i get expensive things to review ( some of them i can keep ) , i get free samples for various products , i got invitations to vip events , discounts etc. 
  on top of that , i get money from adsense and also directly from advertisers . 
  it 's mainly because there are not many other websites with similar theme and also because it 's in my local language . 
  you wo n't get these kinds of stuff right away . 
  you must first get a fanbase . 
  if you 'd like to start a blog reviewing subscription boxes , you 'd have to buy a few of them first actually . 
  you can get a starter fanbase just by inviting your friends , social media is your big friend . 
  make a few contests ( like this page , share this post and win !, 
  ) , that will get you ton of people . 
  i started getting free stuff about 4 months and 50 articles after i started the blog . 
  it needed a little money investment ( hosting , domain , few prizes ) . 
  the biggest investment was my time . 
  this is why you need it to be something you like and enjoy doing . 
  if you will do it only for the benefits like money and stuff , there 's a high chance that you will give it up before you can enjoy the perks . 
  it 's a gentleman lifestyle/male grooming/fashion blog :, 
  scientifically speaking , do they do it just for the fun or is there any reason to it ? 
  this one looks very good . 
  i 'd buy the shit out of your logo . 
  it looks awesome . 
  oh i can see it now . 
  thought it was a weird shaped face rather than a skull . 
  perfect . 
  i love the changes in the background ( not the color , the others ) . 
  it 's way less disturbing now . 
   get 10 usd in credits for each depositing referral . 
  does that mean that you wo n't get money from us unless we deposit some amount of cash to ntrust ? 
  minion yellow ? 
  no you do n't have to be in stem . 
  it does n't have to be . edu , it just need to be the registered school 's domain . 
  if at least the right lightsaber was lined up ... 
  i 'm not in stem ( i 'm studying business and management ) and i still have access to dreamspark premium . 
  my university has stem programs available , so all our students have access to the premium . 
  but you do n't actually have to study a stem program . 
  i 'm not saying this is how it works for everyone , but all i 'm saying that you should check if you have dreamspark premium even if you are n't studying a stem program . 
  is it inernational ? 
  there are other countries in the world than the us you know . 
  2 % is way too low ( i have 3.5 % risk-free interest in my bank ) , i 'd say 4 % + is scam . 
  confirmed !, 
  great to work with you again !,

  and what if it 's not working in the new account ? 
  what advantages does it have over word ? 
  just make the horizontal line in `` t '' bolder , that 'll do . 
  runescape taught me so much . 
  had to learn where every single country and it 's capital are located ( amongst loads of other things ) to get my high school diploma . 
  i thought i wo n't forget it . 
  now i 'm back to where i was before , i can name like 50 countries and that 's it . 
  i wish i could remember it , but there 's not really a point for me to learn it all over again at the moment . 
  exactly , actio libera in causa does n't have to do anything with signing contracts . 
  yeah , oceania was the hardest part . 
  good luck everybody !, 
  still bugged .

  thanks once again !, 
  i 'm fed up with getting blues and greens . 
  could n't i get some money instead ? 
  i mean , this is n't a newbie part of the map . 
  this is for rather experienced players . 
  we do n't need any more blues and greens . 
  if we wanted them , we 'd go to starter map . 
  but i spend almost the same time playing the game as cleaning up the inventory . 
  get a vpn and you 'll be able to get honey again . 
  as a former spider , i know that spiders have shitload of time to do things , so this is completely doable .
