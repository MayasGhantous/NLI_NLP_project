  ` people yawning ' as well, 
  just let it go . 
  a serbian film, 
  it 's definitely one of the most fucked up movies of all time . 
  i feel like there 's only a little reward from finishing hot comparing to finishing gw2 story . 
  this suggestion would solve things . 
  really . 
  the army of chaks near the big nuhoch `` portal '' . 
  i 've seen it in one mission , ca n't find it since . 
  any idea where it is ? 
  just one more confirmation of how great i am !, 
  have you tried this ? 
  worked for me , however , i believe i have 365 . 
  looks good to me !, 
  agreed . 
  it should n't be hard to implement too . 
  i do n't see why this is n't a thing already .

  i really liked the charm bar 's design though . 
  i do n't really like the overall look of the action center . 
  when did it start ? 
  perfectly fine , as long as they match .

  [ hot story related question ] ( #s `` where is the huge nuhoch `` portal '' located ? 
  we 've seen it in one story quest , surrounded by army of chaks . '' ), 
  that 's my fetish, 
  [ relevant ] ( http://abbottsimulator.com/john/ ), 
  i disagree with that , everybody keep saying it 's a myth but i do n't believe them . 
  i once lost a bet , got one leg shaved . 
  now the hair on that leg is much thicker and densier . 
  how do you explain that ? 
  the space between stairs should be the same size as the space between the pillars and the roof . 
  you 're trying way too hard to express your point . 
  keep it simpler , look at / u/myrpou 's suggestion .

  i 've been to a refugee camp as part of my study program ( diplomatic services ) . 
  i do n't object against the war refugees , that 's completely understandable , but the people at the camps are not impoverished unfortunates from conflict zones but young men in fancy clothes with smartphones and ipads . 
  i 'm not saying all refugees are like that , but sadly most of them are . 
  there also seems to be a big sale tomorrow , loads of times for just 5 cents , i think it 's definitely worth checking out ,

  why bother with having a block list full with banned people ?

  confirmed !,
