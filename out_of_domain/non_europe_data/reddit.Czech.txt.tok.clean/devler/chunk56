  partly , how do i do that ? 
  i was expecting ... john cena !, 
  thanks , i now got rid of the promo boxes and slider as well , but i 'm not able to disable the siderbar widgets . 
  any idea why ? 
  this is what my css entry looks like :, 
  / * not show on phone * /, 
  @media only screen and ( max-device-width : 480px ) { . promo-area { display : none!important ; } }, 
  @media only screen and ( max-device-width : 480px ) { . featured-area { display : none!important ; } }, 
  @media only screen and ( max-device-width : 480px ) { . widget null-instagram-feed { display : none!important ; } }, 
  @media only screen and ( max-device-width : 480px ) { . widget solopine_facebook_widget { display : none!important ; } }, 
  @media only screen and ( max-device-width : 480px ) { . widget solopine_latest_news_widget { display : none!important ; } }, 
  i 've tried putting both div id and class in there , neither did work . 
  the only parent element is the whole sidebar , and i do n't want whole sidebar to disappear , only certain widgets . 
  hope you understand what i mean , i 'm not really experienced in css . 
  looks a lot nicer , thanks . 
  that worked , disabled all the widgets though . 
  i want only facebook , instagram and latest posts disabled . 
  i want ads and archive to be seen . 
  then this should work , right ? 
  but it does n't ,, 
  @media only screen and ( max-device-width : 480px ) {, 
  . promo-area { display : none ! important ; }, 
  . featured-area { display : none ! important ; }, 
  . null-instagram-feed-2 { display : none ! important ; }, 
  . solopine_facebook_widget-2 { display : none ! important ; }, 
  . solopine_latest_news_widget-2 { display : none ! important ; }, 
  so how do i make a `` compact '' version of, 
  \\ #solopine _ facebook_widget-2 {, 
  display : none ;, 
  for all the widgets altogether ? 
  worked like a charm . 
  thanks a lot for your advice , and also for your patience , 
  i had windows 7 home premium , i joined the insider program and it installed and activated windows 10 pro . 
  if i leave the insider program year from now , will the pro license remain ? 
  or will i be able to activate w10 with w7 license to get the home at least ? 
  are freckles really imperfections ? 
  i 'm definitely not saying the edited version is better , but i do believe that freckles often act as some sort of focal point , so they should be in fact brought up . 
  us only ? 
  that 's pretty close ( you 've met a lot of requirements ) , but it 's not it . 
  thanks anyway , it 's a great song !, 
  is there any cheaper alternative to the steelconnects ? 
  found it !, 
  kevin spacey, 
  is there a way to do it without plugins ?

  and it 's also surprisingly easy to break out of the map of dragon 's stand , the first time i got out was by mistake actually ( i was on a noxious pod run ) . 
  * twas the night before new year 's *, 
  * and the weather grew mean *, 
  * twas three in the morning *, 
  * and i was stranded in queens !, 
  * the tavern grew empty *, 
  * the gas lights grew dim *, 
  * the horse-drawn carriages *, 
  * were all but snowed in *, 
  * last call was approaching *, 
  * and my fortunes looked bleak *, 
  * then i turned to my left *, 
  * and stifled a shriek !, 
  * she had a peach-fuzz beard *, 
  * and weighed sixteen stone *, 
  * she gobbled up hot wings *, 
  * and swallowed the bones *, 
  * i muffled a scream *, 
  * and threw up in my mouth *, 
  * i asked , `` where do you live ? 
  * and she said , `` one block south . 
  * and six shots of whiskey *, 
  * and prayed to the gods *, 
  * that she was n't too frisky *, 
  * back in her cave *, 
  * she prepared us a snack *, 
  * neath her mighty hooves *, 
  * the floorboards did crack *, 
  * but when she returned *, 
  * she found a sound sleeper *, 
  * and thus she became *, 
  * the sexless innkeeper *, 
  may the odds be ever in your favor .
