  how about some leds behind it ? 
  how about a bit more negative space in the middle ? 
  edit : oh , you 've already done it in the other comment , it 's better !, 
  you 'd rather some call of booty , huh ? 
  i like the exact opposite of what you like . 
  i ca n't stand the `` floating '' panels . 
  i like the current much more . 
  the new one is way too simplified and the off switch looks more like a tie on a thick man . 
  us only . 
  it 's not just you . 
  love it !, 
  thanks a lot !, 
  [ house of cards is back for season four .

  so how exactly you improve your ability to improve yourself further ? 
  i mean , you can improve a certain skill , but how do you improve your ability to improve ? 
  but what do you do to improve your ability to improve yourself specifically ? 
  i do get the numbers , what i do n't get is how you improve your ability to improve yourself ? 
  by snap of a finger ? 
  by training ? 
  we know it 's 20 % more effective , but what exactly do you do with 120 % effectivity now ? 
  let 's say the first improvement is immediate , like a wish from a golden fish . 
  so now , how do you improve it further ? 
  you want to improve your ability to improve yourself , you want it to be 24 % . 
  how do you get that extra 4 % now ? 
  that 's kind of sweet and sad at the same time . 
  the question is , why do you hang out with them ? 
  when did this happen ? 
  how 's life now ? 
  glad you like it now , 
  procrastination is a bitch . 
  do you think you 'll ever tell her ? 
  what came in the mail ? 
  that 's really nice of you though . 
  guild wars 2 already has more actively playing gamers than world of warcraft does . 
  i 'd love to hear the full story . 
  both . 
  i 'd say that wow is slowly killing itself and the popularity of other mmos is not really helping . 
  country restrictions, 
  i 'd love to see that included in the list , i 'm not saying you should specifically look for in which countries it works , but if you bump in that information , i 'd love to see it . 
  at least 70 % websites i sign up to tell me later on that i ca n't use their site because my country is not supported . 
  that 's smooth as fuck . 
  are you still together ? 
  i redeemed $ 10 amazon giftcard yesterday . 
  i also redeemed sony headphones and moto 360 . 
  it 's hard to get the prizes , but i was able to get the prizes 3 out of 4 times . 
  i already got those , not the giftcard obviously . 
  thank you !, 
  you should shake hands with / u/blackmarketkebab, 
  i 've already posted proof once to beermoney , let me find it . 
  edit : here it is http://i.imgur.com/xksikkb.jpg, 
  i can think of one explanation why my post gets downvoted to hell while angry comments get upvoted :, 
  people actually want others to leave the site , so they can have higher chance for getting the prizes . 
  more upvotes for this post means more people leaving gokano . 
   always show my name, 
  am i the only one excited by this ? 
  chances are you are his english teacher . 
  swagways . 
  it 's awesome how lighting and colors can make the person look so different . 
  i prefer your edit ( without masks ) , as she looks more natural . 
  i like the vertical one , it 's more balanced . 
  love this work !, 
  i get the new start screen on my desktop , but not on my laptop . 
  both are updated to the november update . 
  any ideas why ? 
  this is not going to scale well . 
  balance the ratio between the icon size and text size along with boldness of the lettering . 
  i 'm not really sure why , but it looks kinda dated . 
  it 's awesome , but as / u/fair _ at_best said , you have to simplify . 
  i 've styled it in house of cards theme :, 
  i remember i tried skipping stones just when i reached lvl 80 and have n't done almost any jumping puzzles . 
  as you might guessed , i 've failed hardly . 
  i then done all the other puzzles and kept this one to be the last one . 
  and it was . . well , easy . 
  it 's all about practise . 
  i have a friend who recently joined gw2 . 
  he does n't have 80 yet , the leveling is pretty slow . 
  so what do i do to make him mad ? 
  create a new character and level up from lvl 1-80 in one minute . 
  he 's really angry at me every time :(, 
  that 's one of the manliest things i 've ever seen .
