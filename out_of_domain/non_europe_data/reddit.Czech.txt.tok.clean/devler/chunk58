  how come this is a thing , game development wise ? 
  1 looks like it 's actually the 1967 logo . 
  2 looks like it 's a modern company trying to look vintage . 
  there 's still a possibility to get the money from your account , depending on after how many tries will your bank block the card . 
  it 's just chrome being alpha as fuck . 
  i know about both , but i want images itself rather than tutorials . 
  do they provide them as well , for free ? 
  will check that out , thanks !, 
  from the colors you 've put on the girl , she 's about 100 metres big , located about 400 metres from the camera . 
  is that what you wanted ? 
  how much ? 
  so how much can you make , let 's say , per week ? 
  yes , i think so . 
  what bugs me more is how the adress bar gets extremely highlighted when you hover over it . 
  could n't we get a slightly lighter gray instead ? 
  i joined , but it 's rather hard to navigate through their site . 
  where do i find this said section ? 
  that 's awesome , thanks !, 
  two or three . 
  i believe that the gw2 community much more fair than the redditgifts one , so most of the people should be getting their gifts . 
  also , if there 's a rematch this year , sign me up as a rematch santa . 
  however , i still feel like there should be some restriction . 
  just a little one , to filter out the grinches . 
  i do n't know how much can you get from api , but account age or number of achievement points should be in there . 
  then i guess there 's no way we could track it , without anet 's help anyway . 
  what if the drink was named `` a drink '' . 
  how cool would it be to make a movie completely filled with movie cliches , that would never fulfill ? 
  like sneezing and not dying , falling while running from a killer and not getting killed , car crash that does n't explode , turbulence in airplane not going wrong , cop ignoring being suspended from his case , ugly girl not actually becoming pretty after getting a haircut and taking down her glasses , car actually starting at the first time when being chased , people saying `` goodbye '' at the end of the phone call , seeing someone in plain sight then a car drives past them and they do n't disappear , attractive people being creepy , bad guys having a good aim , bombs not having an accurate timer , villain being captured not actually being part of the plan , prophecies not becoming true , enhancing the photo via high tech software not doing anything , crawling through air ducts not actually leading to the wished destination , villain not killing the protagonist and leaving because they do n't have the time for killing and they need to do other evil stuff . 
  i could go on for ages . 
  is there a picture with correct size and distances between the planets in oir solar system ? 
  probably all the pictures i 've seen are really disorted , so they can fit in a book or simply because it looks better . 
  but i 'd love to see the actual scale . 
  i think a little more of dehaze would make it better . 
  / r/beermoneyglobal if you are n't from the us, 
  graphic design . 
  well , everywhere . 
  kinda unrelated , but happy cakeday !, 
  i 'm from europe so i do n't know anything about postmates , but the concept seems to be extremely interesting . 
  do you know how big are the rates for using their service and/or making money through their service ? 
  i still have n't received the cards from august promo . 
  yeah , these trebuchet-like fonts are getting quite popular . 
  but the novelty will go off pretty soon . 
  / r/freedesign, 
  that font has some uses , just like comic sans does , but i agree , it should n't be in logos where it does n't make any sense and the designer just put it in there because it 's a good looking font . 
  i 'd advise you to use mockups with a lighter texture . 
  these strong looking ones ( ice cream and movers one ) are just destroying the overall feel . 
  it 's definitely an improvement , color choice is much better . 
  however, 
  1 ) font is still very tinder-y . 
  make some more changes , i believe you could add some spurs to d and r. 
  2 ) you 've cut the right edges of letter f very poorly , make them straight . 
  i have n't caught a survey i 'd be eligible for from prolific for more than 6 months . 
  before that , i used to get like one or two per day . 
  am i doing something wrong ? 
  i literally gave a presentation to this problem yesterday . 
  i should 've added this scenario . 
  i love it , but to be honest , this would fit a hiphop band much better . 
  it 's not necessarily a serif , it 's just the part of the letter which is missing in your font because you have it all round . 
  and i believe that letting some of the roundness go would make it look less like tinder logo . 
  they 're in my portfolio , 
  they 're in my portfolio , 
  i can also take amazon gcs or changetip , but the price would go 20 % up .

  every designer can replicate any logo in matter of minutes . 
  png , jpg , ai , psd , eps , svg , pdf . 
  it 's a decent logo , but it 's boring . 
  it does stand out from all the other logos , but it could use some changes .

  terrible webdesign . 
  i 'd be honestly afraid to shop at your website . 
  probably don draper . 
  i agree with / u/w0ndermutt , those websites are completely different . 
  i prefer the sleek look of the main site much more .

  you should be able to turn on the mentor tag only if you 've fully completed the map . 
  that could at least filter off some people abusing the tag . 
  their mobile site is alright though . 
  looks a little like . . well . . london boy logo ? 
  talking about caves , have you read this the enigma of amigara fault ? 
  it still gives me shivers . 
  ( read from right to left ), 
  i think it 's legible enough , the white logo on black background looks extremely nice . 
  excuse my french , but that 's fucking awesome . 
  i 've stated a few things year and half ago . 
  it 's actually great to see that some of them are already implemented in the game . 
  take a look :, 
  dashcam , especially if you are russian . 
  really depends on the brand , i change them every 2-5 shaves . 
  whenever i feel like the blade is becoming dull , i do n't use it next time . 
  sorry , only 85 %,
