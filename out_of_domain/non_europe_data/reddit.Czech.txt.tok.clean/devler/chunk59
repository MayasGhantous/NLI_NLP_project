  i can read it clearly .

  i got the mini firestorm from 2d flame and frost dungeon run , i 've sold him for 70g :(, 
  this particular example is more about the overall composition of the photo rather than the postprocessing itself . 
  apart from others have recommended , have you tried using a ring flash ? 
  8:45 pm on itv i believe .

  [ this ] ( https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/gw2-heart-of-thorns-maguuma-overture ) is mine . 
  i love the jungle feeling of it . 
  same goes with public transportation . 
  a regular modern tram costs about 2 500 000 $ . 
  mind if i asked how much did you pay for it ? 
  i immediately assumed that the one on the right is the new one . 
  the old logo looks much better , i love the use of the negative space .

  i 'd say you have two options :, 
  1 ) get the company 's approval to use their logo, 
  2 ) make a derivate of the logo . 
  make your own version which is different enough to not get you in trouble but still recognizable . 
  i can have a good relationship with a friend and still think he 's arrogant . 
  is his name joffrey by any chance ? 
  * i have all my fingers , the knife goes stab stab stab ... *, 
  do girls have to be crazy to accept proposal ? 
  it kind of reminds me of some cute dragon head . 
  the only thing it reminds me of is monument valley ( the game ) . 
  i absolutely love your portfolio . 
  there 's just one thing about it that 's bugging me : i ca n't middle click to open a page in new tab . 
  if it could show you the total price of the vault , that 'd be awesome .

  i really hoped you 'll go this way , not really because i have a pending payment , but rather because i know how important is to keep the users happy .
