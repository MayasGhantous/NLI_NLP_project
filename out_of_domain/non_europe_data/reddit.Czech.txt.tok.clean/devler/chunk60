  i mean , the logos are mediocre and i can imagine hiring a $ 30 graphic designer would get similar results . 
  i 'll leave the guides and training advice to other users , because i do n't know anything about it . 
  but in your free time , you should definitely watch some mad men if you have n't already .

  fuji, 
  photoshop and illustrator is your best choice . 
  good idea , poor execution . 
  so , this still is n't a no-no ? 
   oftentimes , i think people look at a `` simple '' design and assume it was easy to make . 
  to the contrary , a lot of thought , testing and revision went into the development of this design . 
  this is so true . 
  it 's more like ds than ts .

  what else would a graphic drawing tablet be good for ? 
  not a fan of the final b/w edit , but i love the second picture . 
  good job !, 
  also , they have a great refund policy . 
  at least in the czech republic . 
  i 've paid for them once and i 've been replacing them for new ones every year , for free . 
  which is n't really a fox, 
  how is refunding defective jeans abusing the system ? 
  is n't that how warranty works ? 
  levi 's offers a lifetime warranty for their jeans because they stand behind their quality . 
  they advertise they will last . 
  if they do n't last , i do n't see a reason why i should n't get a refund .

  i 'd love to know how long was the longest fight . 
  hello there my new wallpaper . 
  if they are asking a question like this, 
   do you or your someone from your family work in these following industries ? 
  advertising , media , public research , ... 
  they do n't actually want people from these industries 99 % of the time . 
  yes . 
  they pay out on every friday . 
  it 's a great site actually , i 've been using it for quite a few months . 
  ** for those who do n't know : **,

  i will probably get shit for this here , but i do n't design in illustrator . 
  i design 99 % of the stuff in photoshop and then use vector tracing software to make it vector and fix the small anomalies manually . 
  i 'm not saying it 's better way , but it 's definitely easier way for me . 
  illustrator is cool though and definitely your go-to when it comes to logo design . 
  i 've just never really figured it out . 
  yeah, 
  any chance it 's this one ? 
  pmed, 
  [ they did , they have a few more on their facebook page .

  or , you know , they can throw them in the trash like you throw all the other stuff ? 
  into the big hole . 
  it 's in the ref link . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but are n't they fireproof these days ? 
  it is . 
  or any permanent contract . 
   cease-fire \u00a9 waste receptacles are specially contoured to direct smoke and gas from any fire inside the container , back into the combustion area , cutting off the air supply and extinguishing flames in seconds . 
  thought that something like this is already standardized .

  thanks again . 
  dell xps computers are totally amazing both design-wise and spec-wise , but for the price , you could get better hardware if you build it yourself as others have suggested . 
  those are some amazing shots . 
  but the incostinency is your main issue . 
  these photos look like they were taken by 20 different photographers . 
  yoo should develop some your own signature postprocessing and stick with it . 
  you can keep enhancing it as the time goes and hell , even change it completely . 
  but do n't make 20 different styles . 
  stand out with one . 
  also , do n't forget to straighten the horizon , especially when you are taking geometry shots :, 
  pepsi bottle has a different shape and also the bottle cap is blue . 
  i 'm surprised no one mentioned this , but adding a layer filled with white color is actually working very well . 
  see my take on this : http://i.imgur.com/f8kqe8k.jpg, 
  1 ) increase the brightness and lift the blacks, 
  2 ) slightly desaturate, 
  3 ) add blur, 
  4 ) add layer filled with white and decrease the opacity, 
  5 ) add some cool particles and shadows, 
  6 ) add text, 
  7 ) add noise, 
  done , in just about two minutes including the upload . 
  if you played with it for a little while , the results would be much better . 
  just a quick question . 
  i love windows hello , but i do n't have the hardware for it . 
  is there any chance you will introduce windows hello ( or is there any way to do it ) to classic webcams , for home use ? 
  you see , i 'd like to have a certain form of privacy , but no one from my family would print my picture to bluff the login screen or something . 
  and windows hello is actually really awesome and fast way to get logged in . 
  i like that you do n't have to do anything but sit in front of it and it logs you in . 
  thank don draper .
