  go away anna, 
  that not-centered pink business card tingles my ocd senses . 
  fox agent text will probably be overlapped by facebook 's page name . 
  make the edges of the initials sharp , not rounded . 
  i have the same problem :(, 
  i love the color choice . 
  what 's the font ? 
  amazon can refund you money when price of the item you 've bought drops in 7 days . 
  you could try the luck with prime purchase as well . 
  this is exactly why it would be amazing to have player moderators , just like [ runescape does ] ( http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/player_moderator ) . 
  it would give players motivation to report all abuses and be more helpful in general to become a pmod . 
  this would result in more reports = more suspensions = less toxicity . 
  also , pmods had the ability to mute players for a certain period of time , so it would definitely decrease the amount of work so you could focus on other things . 
  content-aware fill, 
  done that !, 
  not a problem !, 
  visitor flair added . 
  what do you think now ? 
  seems reasonable , added !, 
  thank you very much !, 
  thanks !, 
  i appreciate it . 
  glad you like it !, 
  thanks a bunch !, 
  probably too late to get it seen but here 's the life hack anyway :, 
  if you are going to the movies to a multiplex , search the website for screening times and auditorium numbers . 
  then you can easily switch from one movie to another one , paying only for one ticket . 
  works pretty well for cinemas where they check your tickets only at the entrance to the cinema . 
  i actuallly use photoshop 95 % of the time . 
  i never really got used to illustrator . 
  i simply create everything in photoshop as it 's way quicker and easier for me , then convert it to vector ( which is almost flawless since i 'm designing in 20 mpx + sizes ) and then just fix the minor problems if they appear . 
  i 'm not saying it 's better way , just saying that it is a way . 
  do n't hate me . 
  i think it 's way too dark . 
  i know right ? 
  one would thought that a women her age knows the difference between your and you 're . 
  it 's illustrator stuff . 
  are you using default browser ? 
  confirmed , thank you !,

  there was a czech con artist [ victor lustig ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/victor_lustig ) who sold the eiffel tower , twice . 
  eps/svg/ai / pdf are the most used ones . 
  very modern and clean design , i love it . 
  there 's just one little thing that 's bothering me . 
  the `` corner '' space right in the middle . 
  it 's either way too big ( compared to other blank lines ) or too small . 
  i think it ends at 300 metres where the score gets counted and whoever has the most score wins . 
  i 've never make it past 240 metres though . 
  am i right ? 
  looks much better imo .

  this preset might go very well with skyscrapers or snow . 
  i actually would n't mind just giving it the new font . 
  this new x feels weird . 
  the illustration is on point , i 'm not so sure about the type . 
  they do n't really work together . 
  [ maybe something like this ? 
  better than tasting alum i guess ? 
  the developers said they will eventually make windows version as well , but no eta . 
  i like 1 and 4 the most , but it 's not ideal . 
  the problem i see with it ( besides the font choice ) is the fact that the picture behind the letters is tilted differently than the letters . 
  worth watching as well, 
  1 ) i do n't know how to read it ( third creative lab vs third lab creative ? ), 
  2 ) gradients make it look outdated, 
  3 ) logo does n't scale well ( look at thumbnail ), 
  you design for other businesses ? 
  here you go, 
  haha yes . 
  how is the rebranding going ? 
  glad to hear that , will definitely pay a visit there , 
  if you are amazed by this , go watch some lindsey stirling . 
  i do n't do manly things the manly way just because i want to look manly . 
  simplify , a lot . 
  i do n't get why you are getting downvoted . 
  are you being a little harsh ? 
  yes . 
  but your criticism is on point . 
  looks great , what 's the font ? 
  do you speak english only ? 
  i like the second one more . 
  make sure you got spanish listed there as well . 
  at least 30 % of the tests i 'm getting on usabilityhub are not in english . 
  probably about 8 a day , checking few times a day . 
  i more or less speak 7 languages so that might add some tests , but i think it 's more of a luck than anything else . 
  i personally despise spec work , but for one particular reason i have no problems with this one . 
  unlike 99.9999 % of the spec work tasks , this one actually will get the winner a lot of spotlight . 
  logo does n't say online shopping in any way and neither does the name . 
  hot 'n' spicy strips mixed in mashed potatoes . 
  confirmed . 
  thanks a lot !,

  so , is this a new form of adverisement or will i be able to post these on my page for free ? 
  so if i 'm a business owner and i want to create one , i have to pay for the advertising ? 
  i ca n't just share to the people liking my page for free ? 
  this one looks like it could be the logo from 1942 when the company was founded .
