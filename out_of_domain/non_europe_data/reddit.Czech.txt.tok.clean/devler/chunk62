  i have to agree , those are some really amazing concepts !, 
  this is called the illusion of choice . 
  and how about dove being under unilever and mars ? 
  so , where to go bowling with cousin roman ?

  $ 20 international shipping for me unfortunately , so i need someone under me to make a purchase .

  e and a are touching as well, 
  neflix started blocking vpns a few days ago , so it might be a little tougher . 
  same case in the czech republic where netflix sold their rights to hoc to the czech television . 
  any idea where i could post this ? 
  i was actually told to post it here on / r/beermoney . 
  account trading is n't allowed on / r/giftcardexchange, 
  i 'm not selling gift cards though . 
  so where am i supposed to go ? 
  the 1 % are n't feminists , they are misandrists . 
  i really love surveys by realeyes . 
  they usually play you a couple of videos and record you on webcam . 
  they get the data from your facial reactions . 
  for about 2 minutes of watching , you get $ 2 . 
  they are not a panel though , so you ca n't really sign up for them . 
  i got them via pollbuzzer . 
  make the text sharp , not rounded and it will be perfect . 
  i do n't have any idea either but i love it . 
  you do n't need to have clients to build a portfolio . 
  i suggest you creating a few logos for fake companies so the people will know what they can expect from your work . 
  it will get you more customers than you 'd think . 
  i know right ? 
  learning how to use combos is a piece of cake as opposed to dodging . 
  beware that ips monitors have terrible blacks.i suggest va monitor instead . 
  exactly . 
  i believe the font is a good choice , i did n't mean to change the font , just make some adjustments to it :, 
  i believe something like this would look better because it 's more uniform . 
  4 has the best contrast . 
  i 'd go with that . 
  reminds me a lot of the coca cola - coke rebranding . 
  not good in my opinion . 
  every other comment is hate on ps3 . 
  i never owned that , could you explain why is it so bad ? 
  how young are we talking about ? 
  agreed , just because the louis is easy to recreare , does n't mean it 's bad . 
  i only redeem $ 10/month from what my referrals earn . 
  but i 'm not using it myself .

  1 ) diplomatico, 
  the idea is not bad , the execution is worse . 
  some suggestions to make it better :, 
  1 ) switch the font . 
  it looks terrible and outdated . 
  find some modern fonts like tex gyre adventor bold - http://www.1001fonts.com/tex-gyre-adventor-font.html, 
  your main goal is to find font with perfect round `` o `` s. have you ever seen an ellipse pie chart ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  2 ) color pallette is not a good choice either , some of them are fine , but overally they make the logo outdated . 
  find some good matching colors here : http://colorhunt.co/, 
  3 ) make the dividers between chart parts larger, 
  4 ) you do n't need so many chart parts . 
  make 2 instead of 4 in the first picture . 
  it will still look like a pie chart . 
  you do n't have to over complicate . 
  great improvement !, 
  i really like the 5th one .

  thanks !, 
  i love it , but there 's one thing that could be improved . 
  the sound . 
  it 's building up for 3/4 of the video and then it fades away in less than two seconds . 
  i 'd like it better if the sound ended all of the sudden with the right tone . 
  something like this :, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhuh3fzqjgw - not really fading away , but rather ending up quickly . 
  i know it 's not a perfect comparsion since these are just sound effects but i could n't really find any example . 
  i hope you understand , i 'm no sound expert . 
  i really love bali script , thank you !, 
  step 1 : make tens of thousands new axcounts, 
  sounds like immortan joe . 
  it 's because google actually favors the longer videos/longer articles on the youtube/web . 
  if `` that depends . '', 
  is a whole sentence , you 'd translate it as `` to z\u00e1le\u017e\u00ed . '', 
  if it 's `` that depends ... '' and some words follow up , you 'd translate is as `` z\u00e1le\u017e\u00ed na tom , ... '',

  edit : you can hate me but you never catch me alive . 
  the score points are kinda weird with just two players playing . 
  one ends up with -7 and the other one with 7 . 
  the score itself ( how well you do in game ) does n't matter , it all comes down to who crashes the tower . 
  so you do n't even have to try getting as much points as you can . 
  this is working perfectly , great feature !, 
  this man spent 18 years in prison for a wrongful sexual assault conviction . 
  you 'd never believe what happened to him after he got out . 
  i do n't think the old was bad or outdated , so i 'm not really a fan of this new one . 
  do n't get me wrong , it looks great , but i liked the old more . 
  specifically the typeface , which now feels a little weird . 
  confirmed !, 
  thanks again !,
