  photoshop is worth a try as well , eventhough you can only do bitmap logos , which is not ideal for logodesign ( you 'd prefer vectors ) , it 's very easy to get the hands on . 
  i 'd love to make prague version . 
  any tips how to make the moving camera timelapse ? 
  [ this thing ] ( http://www.dynamicperception.com/ ) is really expensive .

  i 've read this exact thing a while ago on / r/tifu . 
  seems like you 're not the only one !, 
  get a part-time job .

  my basic canvas is 7000x5000 px . 
  i 've lived in prague my whole life and i 've never been there . 
  from artistic point of view , i do n't understand how did you make the bees male and female ? 
  i mean , they 're almost identical , but i definitely see the first bee as a man and the second on as a female . 
  that 's really cool man . 
  i 'd rather know what can ** you ** get out of it . 
  i mean , those satoshis are worth close to nothing , right ? 
  runescape memories coming back to me . 
  i chose to go with a simple , colorful , typography based logo . 
  or windows , i 'd like that . 
  this is what i imagine the sellers on fiverr use . 
  so is there some kind of trick how to make money on these sites or are they completely useless ? 
  reminds me of vans a bit , 
  thank god we have prague, 
  sure thing , you have a pm . 
  you have a pm as well . 
  the closest ski resort to prague is [ mon\u00ednec ] ( http://zima.moninec.cz/en ) , it 's not much , but it 's less than an hour from prague . 
  if you want some real skiing , i recommend \u0160pindler\u016fv ml\u00fdn , pec pod sn\u011b\u017ekou or personally my favorite [ herl\u00edkovice ] ( http://www.snowhill.cz/herlikovice/language/en ) . 
  why is it my favorite ? 
  they have a skibus leaving each day from prague , you get the skipass in the bus , so you do n't have to wait anywhere and you are straight to go as it will get you right under the hill . 
  they will of course get you back to prague in the afternoon . 
  this whole experience ( bus + tickets ) costs 690 czk . 
  i had this idea a while back :, 
  on screen 5 slots `` quick inventory '' where you could put items like fire elemental powder , food or potions , weapons for quicker switching etc. 
  [ how i imagine this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/poktv1i.jpg ), 
  thank you very much !, 
  [ i really liked this concept . 
  good luck folks !, 
  confirmed , thanks again !,

  how does it work ? 
  i mean , how does it grab the icons from the noun project ? 
  it 's really awesome and it reminds me a bit of the official mac app for tnp , which is paid . 
  that 's why i wonder if your tool is actually completely legal . 
  did n't know that , that 's pretty cool actually ,

  kind of relevant , really interesting to watch : https://vimeo.com/103554797, 
  the chain feels weird , otherwise good job . 
  confirmed , thanks !,

  the cord is way too small . 
  i expected it to look , well , different . 
  if it was n't for the arabic , i 'd thought this is a regular european supermarket . 
  i have n't got any prolific surveys in a year , so ... 
  i used to get 40 gbp per month . 
  it 's fake , altough i must admit it 's a great design . 
  you got pm , 
  14 days after i 've set up my website , i received a mail that they 'd be interested in hiring me , resulting in $ 10000 account . 
  without advertising it . 
  so , yes , i think it 's worth it . 
  no backlink building or something like that , but i tried to optimize the site itself as good as i could . 
  i got 3 accounts in a month , the other two were minor comparing to the big one though . 
  it 's a solid logo , good job . 
  they 're really expensive though . 
  we are talking $ 650 for the big one . 
  that 's exactly what i need , what is the name ? 
  i 've already got my adsense account blocked , so hopefully they will accept my appeal and i will implement this on my site . 
  thanks !, 
  i always used this 3d lut :, 
  play with the opacity and you could get a similar effect . 
  consider posting your request in the following helpful subreddits instead :, 
  you can watch it with vpn . 
  i 'm not sure if i could tell what i 'm looking at without knowing first .

  i use mockups instead of trademark , they are awesome , as they usually do n't disrupt the logo itself .

  you are also free to join / r/erlibird , 
  just got it in czech republic as well !, 
  i 'm really curious actually , how are walls washed ? 
  thank you very much !, 
  i do n't get any invites anymore since most of the projects are for us residents which i 'm not . 
  but i 'd like it to be active again . 
  i feel like the original logo looks more vr game like . 
  this edit looks like a logo for an apparel brand . 
  honestly it does n't look like you are inexperienced with logo design at all . 
  please someone make a gif out of it . 
  that only works for minor updates , not for build updates . 
  there must be a sub for this kind of thing , right ? 
  girls paying for rent with sex is probably much more common than you think it is . 
  yeah , about a day or two later .
