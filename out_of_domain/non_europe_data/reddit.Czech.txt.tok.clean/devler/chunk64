  no response from google . 
  it 's actually quite sad because just yesterday i received my authorization letter from google . 
  well , i 've made over $ 100 in the first week of adsense running . 
  the website is fastest growing in the country . 
  if i was owner of one of the competitors website , i 'd be really jealous . 
  however , i do n't think the community was toxic or something , i 'm actually starting to think that maybe some of our fans were the ones actually clicking the ads so we could make more money and deliver more quality content , not knowing it might result in a ban . 
  i 've seen these all over london when i last visited , my favorite was spinderman one . 
  edit : spiderman , of course haha, 
  you can actually get what it 's about from the video . 
  that 's kind of unique these days . 
  i 'd like to access it as well . 
  you can make the link with key . 
  just pay attention to the get link pop up on mega . 
  https://dribbble.com/ is amazing as well , i do prefer behance though . 
  i 'd love one as well !, 
  this watchface looks amazing !, 
  it 's designed to work with gliders . 
  i 've never won a single match out of 25 + this season , then i just stopped trying . 
  / r/houseofcards, 
  it 's tilted , duh . 
  it 's illegible . 
  merge layers and delete the text part using magic wand . 
  well , i think it 's an honest mistake . 
  who would think that the government will scam you for a work like this ? 
  i do now , but only because i looked at the previous drafts . 
  they have more, 
  my suggestions are :, 
  1 ) make the box around text one pixel bigger, 
  2 ) make the lightning bolts a little bigger and tilt them, 
  also , as / u/aztekke said , fix the kerning . 
  the gap between p and a is fine , the other gaps are way too small , so make them bigger . 
  i wish there was a way to turn off the night mode . 
  i keep turning it on accidentaly .

  i 'm sure there will be a windows port at some point . 
  i worked with adam bartas for a while , he 's a post processing wizard . 
  take a look [ here ] ( http://www.adambartas.com ) . 
  you need to get a really good photo first . 
  then he worked with around 50 layers to get the desired effect . 
  your photo is not so post-processed , so it would be easier . 
  but you need to start with a good photo . 
  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes !, 
  i appreciate that you like my design ( # 1 ) , thank you !, 
  if you have forgotten the work with pen tool , check this, 
  i 'd say # 3 with mouth from # 1 would be the best choice . 
  good luck folks !, 
  thanks !, 
  what 's hypermx ? 
  that looks so much like simcity cities of tomorrow . 
  they are used in material design a lot . 
  it all comes down to ambient light sensor vs full round screen . 
  would you read it that way if you had n't seen the animation ? 
  that e at the beginning is not a smart choice . 
  now back at your wrist, 
  second life on steroids . 
  behance allows you to filter designers by country . 
  they look absolutely terrific : https://youtu.be/dcbxqngeg6e?t=51, 
  i 'd prefer full round version for my huawei watch . 
  vps/vpns are not allowed on earnhoney , so i 'd assume you ca n't use vms either .

  i do n't know , i 'm actually getting pretty good results when using image size with automatic resampling in photoshop . 
  if the flag design interest you , i highly recommend watching [ this ted talk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5ikb2hl4 ) . 
  i think it 'd look better if it was n't so wide . 
  this is the kind of logo i 'd expect from a fiverr seller . 
  there 's `` force display burn-in protection '' in developer options . 
  should n't it be there especially for apps like watchmaker ? 
  when you are using gmail and the files are too big for the attachment , you can attach them anyway and it will automatically upload it to google drive . 
  i 'm also using onedrive and mega .

  / r/mildlypenis, 
  i was thinking about imperial as well . 
  i feel like the # 2 could use a little less yellow . 
  i love the third one , so good job . 
  agreed . 
  everyone is talking about how sv\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 or knedlo vep\u0159o zelo is the national dish , but i do n't think that it 's the most popular dish in the present times . 
  i mean , i 've actually seen only a handful people ordering it at a restaurant . 
  i 'd say fried cheese is much more popular nowadays , kids love it and adults as well . 
  looks good to me !, 
  great job !, 
  it rhymes by the way . 
  i like that every single concept is better than the former one . 
  this is how the progress should look like . 
  however , i still think the last concept could be improved . 
  it looks way too photoshopey . 
  i mean , the bevel and texture feels way too default . 
  play with it a little so it looks more natural and less forced . 
  offer your skills at / r/slavelabour, 
  i 'm just a regular no tech user . 
  will i benefit from this integration as well somehow ? 
  it does look really good . 
  i 'm just worried that its functionality will be limited since cortana is not available in my country . 
  make it optional . 
  everyone 's happy . 
  we need a little more customization . 
  april fools, 
  its april fools, 
  i do n't think it deserves the hate it is getting . 
  i think it needs more gradients , pattern overlay and bevel .
