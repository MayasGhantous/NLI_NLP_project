  some drop shadow would n't hurt as well . 
  or you can , you know , buy it from aliexpress for $ 1.52 including shipping . 
  i dig it , but it all comes down to where would the logo be used . 
  album art ? 
  excellent . 
  t-shirt design ? 
  perfect !, 
  billboards ? 
  awesome !, 
  mugs ? 
  alright !, 
  on smaller sizes - web , pencils etc it becomes illegible - both text wise and art wise . 
  you wo n't tell what does it say nor will you recognize that it 's an elephant . 
  ree sending a kiss was amazingly cute . 
  huawei has p9 reveal on 6/4/2016 , maybe 2nd gen of huawei watch will be announced as well . 
  relevant and definitely worth watching, 
  it might not be a homework . 
  so . . what would be on the end of the dragon 's stand if it was n't mordremoth ? 
  i strongly dislike the play music one . 
  well , even though i do n't really miss any feature , there 's always room for improvement :, 
  1 ) force touch, 
  2 ) front facing camera, 
  4 ) better battery life, 
  5 ) light sensor, 
  6 ) bezels made out of something scratch proof ( i do n't have any scratches on the metal brushed sides , but i got some on the front ), 
  7 ) actual flashlight, 
  i believe we could get all these features in a watch while still having full round display . 
  but i think we wo n't really see any big changes in the next version . 
  i think it 's because of the stand vs bottle perspective . 
  take a logo , poster or basically any design and slowly make it disappear with eraser tool . 
  just received a beta driver update to my hd5770 . 
  guess i should n't update , right ? 
  well , they said that the beta crimson will be the last one . 
  i 'm not sure if this one wo n't cause me any troubles . 
  yeah , but a few people here encountered bsod after updating . 
  i 'd rather avoid that . 
  looks like the redstone build to me ( or we are very close to it ) . 
  what are the `` test taker '' and `` connect '' apps for ? 
  they 're basically 21st century lookouts . 
  what 's 21st century about them you ask ? 
  there 's a tobogan slide which will get you from top to ground in seconds !, 
  this maybe ? 
  does anyone still use the middle ( restore ) button ? 
  i 've grown to the snap gestures so much that i 'm only using minimize and close . 
  this is basically / r/narcos, 
  basically this ( actually me ) :, 
  yeah , puffy all the way . 
  i will probably visit a barbershop beforehand , thanks !, 
  could you tell us some more about how this was organized ? 
  the first one has definitely the most potential . 
  / r/progresspics, 
  i scaled it down to a typical logo size and now you tell me if you can read it , 
  from 07/03 to 08/04 2015 i 've earned about # 38 . 
  since then , i 've gotten exactly 0 surveys . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  raise clarity, 
  exactly , and even if he would n't last long , it would look great on the cv . 
  looks like increased sharpness/clarity as well . 
  fix the perspective . 
  you just grab one from the disposable box for free at the slide entrance and you are good to ride . 
  i 'm not sure to what point it is fake though . 
  it 's being shot with live audience . 
  there must be a subreddit for this kind of things , right ? 
  not a fan of the icons , but otherwise i like it . 
  definitely a huge improvement !, 
  i 'm a little torn guessing if the next attack will happen in berlin or london . 
  i 'm from the czech republic and i was just listening to an interview the other day . 
  the reporter asked some security expert if we can also expect a terrorist attack in our country . 
  the expert responded `` you should n't be asking if , you should be asking when '' . 
  i wish he was n't but he 's right . 
  do you have a picture ? 
  is the - ia really weird though ? 
  lithuania , slovakia , estonia , austria , australia , albania , algeria , bulgaria , bolivia , armenia , , bosnia , gambia , georgia , india , mongolia , namibia , nigeria , romania , saudia arabia , serbia , somalia , macedonia , tunisia , zambia , tanzania ... 
  it 's probably because it does n't really fit with the rest of the design - flat vs beveled . 
  choose one and stick with it . 
  maybe use some more cheerful colors as well . 
  after all , do you dip black stuff in fondue ? 
  czech duolingo course might come out in beta really soon . 
  you can also take your scythe and `` swing through '' your cat . 
  might sound terrifying but the cat will be ok . 
  that 's the eta for stable version , beta ( which is 96 % completed ) might have a few errors , but i would find it stable to use . 
  i think that the final results are very similar . 
  where one phone has a white haze on a photo , other phone has it on a different one . 
  where huawei excels ( and not only with p9 ) are night photos , they know very well how to work with street light . 
  i tend towards the p9 being slightly better , but when they anncouned the dual camera , i expected the results to be better than this . 
  i shall win this one . 
  take a wide sharpie , write it on paper , scan it , trace and enhance in illustrator . 
  i 'm on 14316 yet i still do n't see this option . 
  only when i switch language to any english .

  edit : oh , it 's already [ there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/4fodld/psbattle_two_chicks_doing_yoga_and_smoking_weed/ ) . 
  learn how to make [ polygon stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msaguhza-90 ) , from there it 's just a simple small to do more complex shapes than triangles . 
  i have no legibility problems with my huawei watch , but i have n't tried any other . 
  some watchfaces have this ability ( skymaster for example ) , but there 's no native option i 'm afraid . 
  they should have done the free weekend after hoops is released .
