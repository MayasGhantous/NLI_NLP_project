   ** items traded : ** $ 11.66 amazon gift card vs. $ 9.32 on paypal, 
  confirmed !, 
  thanks once again !, 
  i 'm not sure how reliable are today 's hr sensors on smartwatches , but i 'd assume it would be at least somehow similar to actual values . 
  so do you think the problem is in the sensor ? 
  alright , thank you very much . 
  is there a reason why windows ink does not work on a touchscreen ( finger painting etc ) ? 
  i need to use my mouse , but ca n't use my fingertips to sketch stuff . 
  ohh , thanks !, 
  i would definitely miss that . 
  there could be a tooltip or something when you open the app for the first time . 
  also , it would n't hurt if it could remember that i left the option active , so i would n't have to activate it every time . 
  for that price , post this offer to / r/slavelabour, 
  worry no more my friend , here i come to relieve your ocd . 
  the logo is indeed not mirrored , but it consists of 3 ** same ** parts . 
  i think it 's just a render , however , newer dell laptops have bezels just like this ( not the bottom one though ) . 
  it 's almost the same mechanism that huawei watch has , only slightly quicker . 
  i do n't see what all of the fuss is about . 
  hey jenny , any acknowledgement of this bug - all apps list in start not appearing ? 
  persists from previous build , still present in this one . 
  do you know any solutions ? 
  i ( and several other people ) have posted in feedback hub but i 've received no answer . 
  good to know , thank you very much !, 
  i definitely know how czechs are feeling about their president and i also know my own opinion on him . 
  labxnow offers 3 free vps as well . 
  i wear it very tight for running , it 's not moving at all . 
  clone stamp tool with soft brush . 
  start a small business . 
  how can you tell ? 
  good to know , thanks . 
  what i find interesting is that ** none ** of the other designs played with the turqoise color present in the winner logo .

  i was kind of a lazy person when i was younger and i did n't feel like finding jobs on websites or asking in person . 
  what i did was find email adresses for all stores in a certain mall and send them all an email with attached cv . 
  within a week , i received 5 responses saying they want me in . 
  retail is fine , i had 120 czk/hour + benefits as my first job without any past experience, 
  how about this one ? 
  it 's awesome and you 're on a good way . 
  imgur albums are a must have though , especially for reddit users . 
  going through images via scroll wheel and also it could show image titles/descriptions . 
  not really . 
  worth noting that it 's a low key shot though . 
  eizo monitors are almost bezel-less . 
  for example eizo ev2455-wt . 
  i found a pretty good deal on asus gtx950-oc-2gd5 . 
  still compataible , right ? 
  thanks !, 
  i found new 950 for $ 120 , so i 'll probably go for it . 
  it has six pins . 
  do you know if the psu power will be enough ? 
  and what about gigabyte gtx 950 2gb ddr5 ? 
  same i guess ? 
  thank a lot !, 
  also , if you had to choose between gigabyte gtx950 2gb and asus gtx950-m-2gd5 , which one would you pick ? 
  i can get them for the same price .

  if you want to rock the concerts with your watch , i highly recommend this app : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.quet.android.visualizer.wear.free, 
  it uses you watch 's microphone to visualize music on it , it 's really awesome for parties and stuff . 
  looks like animus from next assassin 's creed .

  where 's this afk farm ? 
  surely there are places where the loot gain is better than elsewhere ... ? 
  i 'd much rather see a combination of [ touchone keyboard ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.infiniti.touchone.touchone ) with a possibility to input via [ alphanumeric keyboard ] ( http://i.stack.imgur.com/2qto0.png ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure it would be the fastest `` no-prediction '' typing method on wear devices . 
  glad they did n't use the other part of the word liverpool .

  long live the one and only czech budweiser !, 
   we are investigating an issue where if you 're running insider preview builds in certain languages , the all apps list on start appears empty . 
  a workaround for this is to use search to launch apps . 
  aw , still not fixed :(, 
  i 'm on czech , so that 's one . 
  however , it does n't happen on all devices . 
  i have two running the insider builds , one has this bug , the other one does n't . 
  exactly what until dawn does . 
  * `` good design is the one you do n't notice '' * perfectly applies here . 
  it all just works very well together . 
  awesome work !, 
  we 're not really looking forward to meet you either haha . 
  reminds me of movember logo . 
  this is basically the plot of game by anders de la motte . 
  that 's way low too even for europe . 
  i 've been quite happy using usabilityhub , clixsense , prolific academic , pollbuzzer , globaltestmarket and bestreviewapp . 
  cashed out from each one of them , earned about $ 300 last year . 
  thanks to banner blindness , no one really care except you how it looks like . 
  just put it at the bottom and no one will notice it anyway . 
  and if the logo looks bad on your photo , it 's the other company 's problem that they have a bad logo . 
  trams in the opposite direction move on the other track .
