  why they do n't go one by one ? 
  i dig the second one . 
  stepping away from skeumorphism was definitely a good thing , i 'm not so sure about the execution though . 
  the biggest files i 've ever worked with were 20 000 x 20 000 px psds with dozens of layers and adjustments and even they were n't over 1 gb . 
  i 've always loved how / r/lounge looks . 
  both css and logo is beautiful . 
  this is not really like the coca cola 's coke rebranding . 
  they wo n't change it back , people will get used to it over time . 
  there 's been so much happening in dr and so little happening in other cities . 
  i understand that human race is meta , and by most players , dr is the most beautiful city , but i believe that other cities deserve some events as well . 
  it looks like dell logo , but worse . 
  i 'd make the fungi bottoms white rather than transparent . 
  yes , i acknowledge that some cities got love as well , but dr got much more :, 
  queen 's jubilee ( crown pavilion , queen gauntlet ) , dragon bash , wintersday , royal terrace . 
  not to mention parts of ls1 story taking place in dr. and maybe some other stuff i do n't recall . 
  compared to exactly 0 events taking place in hoelbrak ( probably just a little part of ls story ) . 
  dragon bash ** was ** in la , same as wintersday . 
  now it 's in dr though . 
  i have every single class maxed out and i 'm not into crafting . 
  i 'm certain there are more people who feel this way . 
  what would be your solution to those people ? 
  awesome !, 
  how long do you think it will take to get it ota ? 
  that 's some art gallery level shit . 
  good job photoshop !, 
  i could hang the last one in the kitchen or somewhere , really liking it !, 
  yeah and she 's happy about it . 
  fixed : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=prod.lemondev.gralpy, 
  i 'd be ripped if i had done this last season . 
  mmr hell is a thing . 
  good luck folks !, 
  it 's not passive , requires input . 
  not yet , but i 've redeemed many times from gokano , who made this app . 
  theoretically speaking , wild camping is not allowed . 
  statistically speaking , you should be totally fine . 
  stay away from making big bonfires though . 
  you should be able to pay with euros in budweis and prague and maybe some restaurants in bigger cities , but that 's probably it . 
  i 'd exchange some money in budweis so you can pay in smaller cities as well . 
  young people are more likely to speak english , while older people are more likely to speak german . 
  i 'd try my luck with the young folks though . 
  people in cities should be able to speak fluently , but i 'm not so sure about rural areas . 
  you do n't need to wear helmets if you are over 18 . 
  no need for safety vests either . 
  also , keep in mind drinking and driving bike is illegal . 
  what did a french blind man said he wanted for christmas ? 
  all i want for chrismas is yeux . 
  no , this is a typical czech highway . 
  especially in the warmer months . 
  i always assume it 's genuine . 
  we must come from different game communities !, 
  well , it 's an architecture school to be fair , but it 's still ugly . 
  [ runescape ] ( http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/runescape2/images/4/41/celtic_knot_solution_8_intersections.png ), 
  like . . jeff winger kind of type ? 
  they do n't need to be real people , i just need active accounts who will like stuff from time to time . 
  that 's what i used to buy here , 
  red decor . 
  goes very well with checked pattern like this one . 
  damn that 's a lot . 
  but is sure does look really good . 
  what plants are considered manly ? 
  photoshop . 
  you nailed the mouth part , but the eyes do n't look terrifying at all . 
  adsense is indeed allowed on free sites and yes , you can have multiple blogs on one adsense account . 
  i do n't see a reason why they would n't be . 
  love it !, 
  [ la telepath\u00e9 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05htbaondqe ) is my favorite one . 
  first one definitely has more of a star wars vibe . 
  i 've tried fontbase and none of it 's buttons do anything for me . 
  i love your decadent style !, 
   fixed an issue resulting in the all apps list in start being blank for certain languages, 
  not fixed for me ( czech ) , problem still persists . 
  start menu also closes immediately when it opens , i ca n't click even anything . 
  are you aware of this issue ? 
  do i have to perform clean install ? 
  if you have to ask this question , you know the answer . 
  it keeps switching from czech to english randomly for me . 
  they are paid to clap . 
  they do n't really express their opinions . 
  yeah they do n't want that unfortunately , they want to stick with the long name . 
  i do n't think that would be possible as i need to include the hyphens as well . 
  i think that 's based on the fact that 90 % of silesia is in poland . 
  it 's a [ watchception ] ( http://i.imgur.com/teqd25b.jpg ) !, 
  they most likely are n't . 
  i use [ freepik ] ( http://www.freepik.com/ ) . 
  just google `` psd mockup '' and you fill find lots of both free and premium templates . 
  i 'm actually much more amazed by the post-processing of the photo . 
  it 's not really the same thing , but there are websites which analyze your reddit comments and show you how big is your dictionary and how many different words you 've used . 
  i 've sent two , no gold :(, 
  extra kudos to / u/w311why who made the logo for the game and for the studio :-), 
  i really love watching [ dvtv interviews ] ( http://video.aktualne.cz/dvtv/ ) . 
  you use a deck when sliding down . 
  fix the perspective , it 's still odd . 
  i think this design fits their target customer group very well . 
  i mean , rimmel london is n't known for it 's subtlety . 
  you 're fine . 
  use font awesome . 
  you should tip no matter what . 
  no offense , todd . 
  i prefer cherlene .
