  teal and orange game is strong in this game . 
  there was a bug i had for the last few builds , which was supposed to be fixed in the last one :, 
   fixed an issue resulting in the all apps list in start being blank for certain languages . 
  however , last build did not solve the problem . 
  will this one ? 
  czech, 
  also , affinity designer for windows should come by the end of june . 
  tl ; dr raids are not living story, 
  one might think it 's a subsidiary of subaru though . 
  this is n't evolution , this is regression . 
  you should really watch this video to give you a little perspective : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=essnmnorqto, 
  i was receiving a lot of invalid clicks from my competitors , so they banned my account . 
  i appealed and they did not accept it . 
  i wish they could just not pay me for the invalid clicks instead of banning the whole account for life . 
  most of my monetization depended on adsense . 
  seo was very well built , i was receivig a lot of organic search traffica and it was the fastest growing site in the industry in my country . 
  i switched to cj affiliate but it 's not as efficient . 
  they would block the new account as well . 
  they have my credentials and vat . 
  they ca n't pay me . 
  it would have to be someone else 's account , google would have to pay someone else , that person would have to do the taxes and i 'd get the rest of the money . 
  high school ? 
  this stuff is taught at elementary schools , at least in most countries of europe . 
  [ i 've been a bigger fan of this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/u4qlxfw.jpg ) or [ this one ] ( https://i.imgur.com/kkqullp.jpg ) . 
  here 's what i think you should do :, 
  booty , booty , booty , booty , rockin ' everywhere, 
  make sure to install this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.quet.android.visualizer.wear.free and be the most interesting person on a party . 
  it 's not microsoft , it 's ea . 
  it 's an awesome watch with confirmed 2.0 update . 
  i 'd go for it . 
  no need for new snapdragons , the ui is very fluid . 
  there is more than a 2 years gap between 1.0 and 2.0 , so i think we can expect 3.0 to roll out in late 2017 - early 2018 . 
  this is what i loved about runescape . 
  there were quests that were related to each other and some of them progressed the main story , and then there were hundreds of different quests with unique stories . 
  would be really nice to have something like that as well . 
  they 've said that watches will work without phones nearby . 
  does that mean that you are connected to your phone via wifi ? 
  let 's say you are in a pub , you left your phone at home . 
  phone is connected to home wifi , watch is connected to pub wifi . 
  you receive a call to your phone . 
  can you answer it via watch in pub ? 
  that 'd be fucking awesome and i do n't think it 's something impossible to make . 
  i know you can already get notifications and stuff , but how about the calls ? 
  so i can make skype calls on my wear , but i ca n't do regular calls ? 
  technically speaking , would it be so hard for google to implement this ? 
  this would be a huge dealbreaker for those questioning smartwatch benefits .

  good luck , comrades !, 
  foursquare , facebook and google maps . 
  look at r3zzonate , now back to me , now back at r3zzonate , now back to me . 
  this subreddit is for english language content . 
  post this to / r/cesky instead . 
  alright , i need you to answer a few questions before we start :, 
  first , please introduce the brand you want logo for . 
  1 ) do you have any idea what you want on the logo ? 
  icon + name ? 
  just a typography logo ? 
  2 ) if you like some particular logos ( might be competitors or completely unrelated , please send them to me . 
  3 ) are there any colors you prefer ? 
  4 ) do you want vector files ( i provide ai , eps , pdf and svg ) to it ? 
  if so , it will cost $ 5 extra . 
  5 ) what is the prefered style ( modern , friendly , luxurious , sleek ) ?

  half of the cast is czech . 
  i suppose they made the foreign actors speak with accent so everyone speaks the same . 
  is there a reason why the 300 px and 200 px images look worse than the others ? 
  stuck in a boot loop after this . 
  feel free to message me when you can :-), 
  that first picture looks like from runescape . 
  guys , i think we have an answer to `` make it more luxurious '' . 
  prague is amazing , glad you made a stop there , 
  i would n't trust a designer who needs only 4 hours to design a logo . 
  also , the website is confusing as fuck . 
  a big no for me . 
  check dhgate instead . 
  hello there , i 'd love to try it if you still have some promo codes , 
  looks like 1/3 in this story . 
  i do n't see a reason why this is n't a thing . 
  this must be the easiest-to-implement feature players are asking for . 
  given the fact that the slayer achievements already exist , it 's only matter of copy pasting the previous ones and defining new monsters .
