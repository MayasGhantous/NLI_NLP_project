  1 ) type / age in chat ingame, 
  2 ) you have played ... over the past * 500 days * ( for example ), 
  3 ) type * 500 days * in [ wolframalpha ] ( http://www.wolframalpha.com/ ) and it will show you the exact date you 've started playing . 
  nope , but someoe else posted a link with all bwe dates , 
  [ useful information for new players ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers ), 
  i was able to get to home server ( aurora glade ) for the first time since update . 
  people said to me that they kill prime holograms basically almost every time . 
  kinda surprised since i had done it like 10 times ( none successful ) on overflow . 
  try to get on high population server without overflow and kill is pretty much guaranteed . 
  i actually work at the official levi 's outlet in czech republic . 
  from time to time , we have some last pairs of jeans that costs $ 30 without discounts . 
  if you combine our discounts ( buy 2 - get 20 % off , second item is 50 % etc ) , you can practically buy par of new levi 's jeans for $ 15 . 
  [ spoiler ] ( #s `` we kill mordremoth '' ), 
  can you stack aura on sunrise ? 
  is there a connection between scarlet playing with dragon magic and tequatl going insane ? 
  i think it seems very likely altough it has n't been explained yet . 
  hurr durr warriur, 
  1 ) very stability, 
  3 ) such dps, 
  i do n't give a skritt . 
  best time you can do it is on friday or saturday afternoon ( around 5 pm gmt ) on a high population server . 
  if you can get past the overflow , you are very likely to get into next stage . 
  but basically any afternoon works on high population servers . 
  ** darts **, 
  short-range , vulnerability, 
  ** claws **, 
  warrior , ranger , necromancer, 
  i do n't want a polearm or spear , i wan na have a hasta !, 
  items with market price over 50g should have a confirmation window when throwing into forge . 
  i 'm jealous . 
  will bazaar be the new la ? 
  differences i 've spotted already :, 
  ( if anyone could translate , would be great ), 
  * dozens of people everywhere, 
  since ellen estabilished the relationships between zephyrites and rest of the tyrians , we could get bigger labyrinthine cliffs as a permanent zone . 
  when i see your videos , i 'm proud to be czech . 
  assuming that you are playing since release it 's about 11,5 h/day . 
  man that 's a lot afking !, 
  i like how it shows you that arrow which points to nearest event/heart . 
  i believe this ( and maybe more things from china gw2 ) will be implemented in the feature patch , just because they are cool and useful and they even have them already coded so why they would n't put it in na/eu right , 
  1 ) decide to craft sunrise, 
  2 ) never lose your dusk again, 
  did you have many partyhats ? 
  my condolences, 
  had about the same gp in stuff and got hacked too , but it 's like two years back now and i do n't play it anymore so it 's not a big deal for me . 
  2 ways :, 
  upgrade to digital deluxe, 
  buy a heroic edition, 
  if you did n't do any of these , the hacker just spent about 164 golds to get it . 
  none . 
  i won the game in a giveaway and i 've never bought any gems . 
  i want to see the last laser killing 30 guys so much now !, 
  \u266a why are there so many white people everywhere ? 
  hands in the air like we do n't care . 
  saving this . 
  do n't mind my comment , 
  make a gw2 shortcut ( if you already do n't have one ) and add '' - maploadinfo '' at the end of location so it looks like this :, 
  * `` c : \\ program files ( x86 ) \\ guild wars 2 \\ gw2.exe '' - maploadinfo, 
  this way you will see loading with percentage etc when trying to join a map so you can tell where it got stuck/which areas are loading slow . 
  then it will be easier to detect where the problem is . 
  ok so from what we 've seen , it 's not that expensive if you already have the kits . 
  could you calculate somehow how much it would cost with mystic salvage kits ? 
  sue me , i use my laurels for daily wvw rank/daily badge spender . 
  allowed :, 
  1 click = 1 action, 
  forbiden :, 
  1 click = 2 + actions, 
  so that 's a no , it 's not allowed . 
  hovewer you can use mouse keys which will bind your left click to a number 5 . 
  clicking on 5 on a num pad is easier and better for your wrist than clicking . 
  or as said before , bind it to your scroll wheel . 
  less than months away . 
  easy answer , we 're not . 
  how do i get more empyreal fragments ? 
  game-breaking !, 
  if lions arch will look after repairing exactly the same as before , i will be hugely disappointed . 
  saving marjory 's sister , coming soon in ls season 2 . 
  might be an account of someone from anet , 
  psa : if you want another quick 80 ( not done via map exploration ) for pve , create it before this patch . 
  after it , you 'll have to get traits by yourself across the whole world . 
  did n't noticed this , 
  altough , unlocking from trainer will cost some money . 
  now it 's free so there 's another reason . 
  hovewer i do n't think that it will cost that much , 
  ascended backpiece will cost a lot . 
  man if you have that much money from first 4 weeks of playing , please , teach me , 
  it fascinates me how different the game was in development stages . 
  does anyone know how old is this map or does anyone have a gameplay ? 
  also http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/fortunes_vale, 
  psa : you can put the time and date in wolframalpha.com and it shows you what time/day is it in your country , 
  stack stack stack ? 
  i actually do n't think that colorful outlook will be only dyes . 
  these should be in the account bound section , which could include dozens of other items which are now soulbound for no reason . 
  but then i have no idea what would be in colorful outlook . 
  i thought that they were proud of their system of being able to pvp all the way from the beggining without unlocking anything first . 
  black citadel is not even the fastest race city for using bank  tp , try divinity 's reach for example - bank and trading post are few steps away and crafting stations right under them ( quick wp without loading ) , 
  is tl ; dr version possible ? 
  slight offtopic, 
  did the players who bought instant trait reset already get their gems refunded ? 
  i run gw2 on lenovo s400u , hd4000 i3 , works lag-free at min details ( not in wvw , world bosses though ),
