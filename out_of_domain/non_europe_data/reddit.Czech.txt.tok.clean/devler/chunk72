  revise the area under eyes . 
  the edit is very visible and the skin looks very flat . 
  also her hair looks kinda green to me . 
  otherwise , it 's a pretty solid edit . 
  this could be an interesting fight mechanic . 
  why is the h there ? 
  thanks for chosing me as a winner keenan , it 's been a really interesting challenge !,

  sneezing and not dying , falling while running from a killer and not getting killed , car crash that does n't explode , turbulence in airplane not going wrong , cop ignoring being suspended from his case , ugly girl not actually becoming pretty after getting a haircut and taking down her glasses , car actually starting at the first time when being chased , people saying `` goodbye '' at the end of the phone call , seeing someone in plain sight then a car drives past them and they do n't disappear , attractive people being creepy , bad guys having a good aim , bombs not having an accurate timer or timer at all , villain being captured not actually being part of the plan , prophecies not becoming true , enhancing the photo via high tech software not doing anything , crawling through air ducts not actually leading to the wished destination ... 
  suzanne from mad men or blah blah from himym . 
  you 'd have better chances in slovakia , but i believe you can get it in most bigger czech cities and even some smaller ones . 
  just find the nearest place where they sell liquor . 
  myself , i live in prague and you can get it pretty much anywhere . 
  postprocessing is n't always just about moving sliders , it 's about photomanipulation as well . 
  you can always put some clouds in there if you do n't like the bland sky . 
  giving people who need a blowjob . 
  / r/randomactsofblowjob, 
  here you go, 
  yeah , it is, 
  vectormagic , it does really good job when the image is big enough , which was the case . 
  i choose it over illustrator 's live trace anytime . 
  first off , reddit closed the marketplace about a year ago . 
  secondly , you can always sign up with more credits ( assuming you 've already participated in some exchanges ) and you will only get matched with people who 've already successfully completed a few exchanges , almost eliminating the chance that you wo n't get anything . 
  it 's an original czech herbal bitter . 
  smells like christmas , taste is strong and cinnamon like . 
  costs about $ 13 , so a lower mid price range . 
  this piece appears to be pre-2003 , when they introduced the current bottle design . 
  but what 's the tie with khatun 's words ? 
  dodge and burn, 
  you tell me . 
  literally 1 minute job , so i guess if i spend more time , i 'd get much more similar results . 
  * 1 ) make the image black and white via black and white gradient overlay, 
  * 2 ) dodge & burn via [ this simple technique ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gpbuv0iwm ), 
  * 3 ) lower down the highlights and whites , while increasing contrast and using dehaze, 
  * 4 ) sharpen, 
  you 'd get much more similar results if you used frequency separation at the beginning to smoothen out the skin . 
  it 's what people use for retouching images besides frequency separation . 
  it 's mainly used for portraits and body shots , but you can use it everywhere . 
  it makes the image less flat and more appealing . 
  dodging lightens and burning darkens specified area . 
  so it 's basically something like manual contrast editing . 
  there are 2 specific tools named like that in photoshop and many other photo editing softwares . 
  you can achieve similar results with other tools too though . 
  check out this tutorial , which will give you a better idea what is dodging and burning all about : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsuwit8hiaq, 
  i believe you can achieve same results with both methods . 
  it only depends on which approach you prefer . 
  sure there is . 
  just play around with the sliders and then use the brush to selected areas . 
  the only problem is that lightroom does n't have layers , which is why i prefer photoshop for this . 
  check out [ this tutorial ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h33xjibmplo ) . 
  dodge and burn tools are definitely there , not sure about other tools though . 
  not a full time ( i 'm a business uni student ) , but i make more money than most of my friends working full time ( other professions ) . 
  i started when i was around 13 y/o , i have n't made much till i was 18 or something , but then i got my business licence and started freelancing in my free time . 
  so yeah , if i ditched school , i could easily live off it . 
  i guess that could answer your question as well . 
  i believe the price would be about 5x the amount , but otherwise it 's perfect , i love it !, 
  which was really long . 
  i do n't think they will do that again . 
  6 months tops . 
  i believe they will reveal the next expansion at pax east in march with expansion release in q4 2017 . 
  how to dress .
