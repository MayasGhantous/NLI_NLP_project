  i once tried pepsi gold . 
  looks like piss , tastes like pepsi . 
  it really varies school from school . 
  i studied at a public high school ( very well funded though ) and i remember that my math/french teacher had a salary of 35 000 czk net . 
  why the fork is n't this higher up ? 
  what if when you typed your password , ***** would appear instead . 
  and party members . 
  i often send party members food if they forgot it and it takes very long time because of the block . 
  it was n't actually . 
  i went to the secondary school for administration of the european union . 
  yeah , windows already has this feature in insider builds , so it will come to consumers soon . 
  f.lux is the past , unfortunately for them . 
  so just about the same as last year . 
  i wish gw2 had [ player moderators ] ( http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/player_moderator ) . 
  it probably would n't be a solution for this particular problem , but it would definitely create more time for anet to focus on other stuff . 
  1 ) please learn how to use paragraphs . 
  2 ) why you thought that / r/czech would be the right place to post this rant ? 
  i do n't think your problem has anything to do with our country . 
  you should rather post this over to / r/facebook . 
  3 ) facebook 's way of reaching audience is pretty ingenious . 
  first , the post you create will reach the wall of your most active audience ( people who comment , share , like or even view your posts the most ) . 
  if they take an action ( comment , share , like , view ) , facebook will show the post to more people . 
  if they take action , facebook will show the post to another bunch of people . 
  this way , the bad content will not appear on peoples ' feeds and the content people like will . 
  the fact that you have 100-300 user actions per post is n't actually that great on a 80k page . 
  i know creating quality content is hard , i have a few pages up myself . 
  but 100 user actions are the norm for a 3-5k fanpage . 
  your fans are inactive , it 's not really facebook 's fault it 's not delivering the content to your whole audience . 
  exactly . 
  i do n't think this is a double standard , but rather a matter of preference . 
  most men do n't find hairy women attractive , while most women find ( reasonably ) hairy men attractive . 
  the map is definitely one of the most beautiful ones though . 
  we 'll get next ls episode on 31st january , expansion will be announced at pax east ( 10th-12th march ) . 
  anyone wan na bet ? 
  http://www.titulky.com/ is the best source for czech subtitles . 
  most of the subtitles will be for movies/series in english , but i 'm sure you can find some of the more popular polish stuff there as well . 
  5 days, 
  aw man , then you are probably right :-), 
  but i really do n't wan na, 
  titulky.com is your best to-go source . 
  there are usually multiple subtitles for each version of the movie . 
  you might also want to try opensubtitles.org and podnapisi.net . 
  judging from google results ( searching for buurman en buurman ) , it looks like it really is a thing over there . 
  they even have a voiceover . 
  i do n't think you could use it even if this particular video was n't monetized . 
  try to message the company if they are ok with it . 
  edit : check this out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nominative_use, 
  i do n't really have an advice regarding the logo creation itself . 
  i think you have a talent and you are on a good way to make truly spectacular logos in the future . 
  what you might want to focus on now is how you present your work . 
  first of all , there 's not really a point of having a border . 
  they are kinda obsolete and in your case also redundant , as they do n't add any extra value . 
  next , focus on your colors . 
  the logo itself is alright , the background is what does n't fit . 
  look up complimentary colors to make your work stand out . 
  less is usually more , and in your work , a simple white would fit the logo much better than the current bland blue . 
  also , if you make a colorful logo with a black text , in most cases it wo n't work . 
  you either need to incorporate the black in the logo image itselfe , or try another color . 
  in your case , your logo could be fully in shades of blue . 
  take a look here https://www.behance.net/search?search=logo to see how professional designers present their logo marks . 
  most of the time , the designers throw in a lot of mockups , so the client can see how the logo works in different situations . 
  you do n't need to do that ( especially for logo battle , one mockup is usually more than enough ) , but if you want to step up your game , learn how it 's done . 
  love it !, 
  a subtle change can make a huge difference . 
  one more thing , remember that space is your friend . 
  your logo does n't have to fill up the whole image , make it twice smaller and it will look much more professional . 
  see what i mean : https://www.behance.net/gallery/46617871/logo-collection - ( part-4 ) /, 
  https://www.behance.net/gallery/47132871/logo-selection-2016 / https://www.behance.net/gallery/47395459/logoset-4, 
  you are welcome !, 
  agreed , it does look significantly better , 
  it 's olomouc , czech republic . 
  and a follow up for the girls : `` have you ever been in a turkish person ? '', 
  i rarely encounter bugs even with the insider fast ring builds , so yes , it is safe . 
  simplify and balance . 
  your mark could easily be read as jp , so you need to make the u stand out a little more . 
  this subreddit allows only posts in english . 
  please post this to / r/cesky instead . 
  we do n't have to guess . 
  the artists has a step by step for each one of them . 
  that 's not crown pavilion , it 's [ the upper city ] ( https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/file:the_upper_city.jpg ) roof . 
  i think it is misspelled on purpose . 
  oh man that was quite a while ago . 
  was her the cheating wife ? 
  120 000 czk for 2 months ? 
  that will be a hell of a party . 
  prague is cheaper than sweden . 
  especially the accommodation will be about twice as cheap . 
  look here for 2017 university courses : http://www.cuni.cz/uken-585.html, 
  most of the courses offer cheap accommodation , but you can also rent an apartment in the outer city centre for about 18 000 czk/month . 
  charles university is definitely your best choice , if you do n't want to attend a language school . 
  coincidentally it 's the most reputable university in our country . 
  the color choice looks kinda outdated . 
  i 'd go with a more pastel red and dark blue instead of black . 
   therefore , i speculate that episode 5 ( made by the team that made rising flames ) will be back in the ring of fire, 
  so this is why we only got half of ember bay and nothing since !, 
  so , what fractal do you think we can expect next ? 
  * la / scarlet hologram battle fractal ? 
  * fall of abaddon fractal ? 
  * twisted marionette fractal ? 
  * zephyrite / labyrinthine cliffs fractal ?
