  here you go !, 
   we fixed an issue where settings would crash on launch for insiders using certain display languages , including russian , french , polish and korean . 
  if you were impacted by this on build 16188 , that means you wo n't be able to open windows update to check for updates . 
  however , your pc will download the new build in the background . 
  once the build is downloaded and staged , your device should automatically restart to install it when idle and outside of your configured active hours . 
  or you could go to start and power and choose to update and restart to install the build . 
  that was really annoying , thanks for the fix !, 
  if it 's going to happen , it will probably come with the next expansion . 
  check out [ adam bartas ' works ] ( http://www.adambartas.com/ ) , because that 's probably the style you 're going for . 
  the sad news is , this is not easy . 
  i watched adam bartas work live and a simple photo is a composite of hundreds layers , even combining 3d rendering into the photography . 
  start with mastering dodge and blur , that 's 90 % of the desired effect . 
  highly visible aura around the edges is usually an indication that you went too far with the editing . 
  settle down for something less saturated . 
  aaaand it 's still inconsistent . 
  take a look at the pictures . 
  every single app has a different layout . 
  story remix does n't work with videos for me , all i see is a black screen . 
  generally , you pay 100 czk ( about $ 4 ) per year and you can loan as many books as you want and you do n't pay anything else ( as long as you do n't return it late ) . 
  if you want to score some points , do it . 
  but it 's not like you ca n't propose to her without her father 's permission . 
  i 've always used https://www.bellesfleurs.cz/, 
  also relevant snl skit, 
  [ a-holes : pitch meeting - saturday night live ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm6hme_xfgc ), 
  til you can salvage dyes, 
  you might want to remove the photographer from the reflection and make the `` halo '' less obvious . 
  the sides are unnaturally dark compared to the middle , make the transition less harsh . 
  it 's a year old though , not really new . 
   he could 've just left it uncovered without caring . 
  this is what i do n't get about american delivery services . 
  how the hell is this a thing ? 
  where i live they have to deliver it to your hands , not just leave it on the front porch . 
  here in europe , the delivery guy calls you/you select on the website when you want to get your package and they will deliver it to your hands . 
  it 's awesome how fast human reactions are . 
  everyone is looking at the camera . 
  to be fair , there should n't be such thing as a delivery window . 
  they should deliver your packages when you want them to , that 's what you 're paying them for . 
  at least that 's how it works in my country ( at least in bigger cities it does ) . 
  to be completely fair , there are definitely good submissions, 
  ( not trying to defend logo contests though ), 
  it 's never too late bro !, 
  start here to get a basic understanding of the ecostystem : https://docs.microsoft.com/cs-cz/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide and then you can start browsing / r/wpdev /, 
  start locally , ask around , put up some posters or craigslist ads , give out some business cards . 
  you can also try [ mevyo ] ( https://mevyo.com/, 
  ) to find people to do stuff together . 
  and it still could be worse . 
  the printscreen could have been taken by a phone camera . 
  i once found a perfect runescape clone , but have no idea what was the name . 
  anyone ? 
  it had some late rs graphics ( think hd and newer ) , skills and quest just like rs and overally it really looked like a clone , not just a game based on good aspects of rs . 
  skrill all the way . 
  desaturate everything but yellows and reds , light up the shadows and bring down the highlights . 
  decrease contrast . 
  use split toning to put some blues in the shadows and magentas in the highlights . 
  if not , you can also bring down the exposure a little bit as well . 
  but i think it 's not as dark as you might think , it 's the loss of details in the shadows what makes it look so dark . 
  great job !, 
  get rid of [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydvvocf.jpg ) though . 
  i also think that the nose area could be touched a little better . 
  if you take a look at it from a good agle , you will see a yellowish spot o the neck , which i highlighted . 
  looks like a remnant of the retouching . 
  as for the nose are , i feel like the sides are a little rough compared to the rest of the face and they could use some smoothening and lightening up . 
  oh , i thought that was the joke . 
  people do n't `` ex '' in english speaking countries ? 
  yeah, 
  with this amount of compression , not really . 
  exif datas are cleared , so we ca n't get anything from them either . 
  the only way would be to find the face via reverse image search , assuming that the face is taken from the internet and not from private archives . 
  is there a way how to jump through a glass window with minimum harm ? 
  how about the opposite . 
  when you cough in real life , it 's usually nothing . 
  there 's several services that could and should be connected to the people app as well :, 
  * facebook, 
  * vkontakte, 
  * telegram, 
  and a top one . 
  by the end of the war , about 10 million copies of mein kampf had been sold or distributed in germany only . 
   i started 3 months ago , now i have 3 fully ascended characters , fractal lvl 100 , and have full cleared all raids . 
  started 5 years ago , have 1 ascended character , fractal lvl 80 , cleared only escort raid for masteries . 
  have you tried story remix on windows 10 ? 
  you just make a few videos/photos and it will automatically cut it , sync with music and make a videoclip . 
  astronomical clock and old town hall are under reconstruction so if you 've seen them before , you can skip them this time , 
  i remember you from back then on / r/logodesign, 
  what you are doing guys is amazing !, 
  take a good shot , desaturate , decrease contrast . 
  she looks a little bit `` undead '' to me . 
  add some color to her skin . 
  definitely an improvement !, 
  in all fairness , how would you react if you told your mom you 're gay and this was the reply ? 
  why it suddenly has outline around the eyes ? 
  might be czech from someone who does n't speak it well . 
  definitely not disobeying the law , they got the permit from the city .

  it 's part of the city most . 
  no need to hide it , just be yourself . 
  meet other just like you would in sf . 
  maybe tinder ? 
  pubs and clubs ? 
  i 've lived my whole life in prague and never seen a pickpocket nor i 've been pickpocketed , and i frequent in the centre pretty much every single day . 
  that seems really excessive , i get that there need to be no-fly zones , but the amount of stuff you 'd need to get through to get a simple footage seems ridiculous .
