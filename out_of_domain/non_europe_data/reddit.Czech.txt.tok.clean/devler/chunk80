  i mean , why are you punishing legit users ? 
  those without the licence will crack the software so it does n't check the connection and will be able to use the software nonetheless . 
   we fixed an issue from the previous flight where accented characters could n't be input properly into win32 apps using the hardware keyboard . 
  oh my god thanks . 
  it was so painful to write , i had to copy all the nonfunctional characters . 
  to be honest , i 'd buy the shit out of [ dragon emblem shirt ] ( https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/dragon_emblem_shirt ) if i could . 
  not all mlm companies are pyramid schemes . 
  they still have the pyramid structure ( well , most companies do ) but they do not require you to buy things from them . 
  it just works the way that if you make a sale , all the people above you are profiting from it . 
  god i hope so . 
  the project neon is like an e3 trailer while what we have now is the released game . 
  good luck everyone !, 
  what he meant is that the same team who worked on a crack in the ice are the same people who are making the next episode . 
  and one would think that 7 months is quite enough time for a development of one episode . 
  if you like it , you should check out [ game maker 's toolkit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plc38fcmfcv_s7lf6xberfwyrt7-vmi_x9 ) as well , it 's a series on videogame design . 
  [ the digital garage by google ] ( https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/ ) . 
  it shows that you have knowledge of how online marketing ( analytics , adwords , e-mail marketing etc ) works . 
  it 's a good introductory certificate and you can put it up on linkedin . 
  when your legs do n't work like they used to before ... 
  there was a movie where aliens disguised as hot women came to earth and used some guys for sex . 
  i think they were close to extinction and wanted to reproduce ? 
  but honestly i do n't remember much . 
  i think the current color is so iconic they would just paint it with the same color . 
  dragon bash is not necessary , we celebrate the lunar new year which is almost the same content . 
  4k interface is big compared to 16k . 
  take a look at this 15360x8640px screenshot :, 
  make something shocking . 
  i had windows 7 home premium , and somehow i ended up with windows 10 pro after the upgrade .

  well , not really . 
  kazma ( in the party video ) is the one who is behind the show , the guy with tourettes is just an actor . 
  and there are a few episodes in english : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plm9_kznjw8qe9ne_coqogf79tibcwgrvn, 
  in some countries like czech republic , you can actually legally download music , movies and other content if you are not able to get it any other way . 
  that 's the great thing . 
  the law does not specify this . 
  is n't ? 
  they only had 1 store 5 years ago and now they have 12 . 
  you can do the same with alt + tab . 
  just press it and then hold alt . 
  leave them your business card . 
  judging from the original signs , they wo n't be able to create their own new signs . 
  as easy it might seem to you as a designer , their designing peak is probably starting up ms paint . 
  then again , this is reddit , so it 's 50/50 it will be a dick shaped vegetable . 
  in czech republic you can . 
  i do not expect `` proper '' expansion announcement at least till the 8th of august , maybe even later . 
  they need to give players time to play the ep6 , i do expect a teaser/trailer at the end of ep6 though . 
  miscellania anyone ? 
  so you do n't have to visit the instance every day ? 
  you just select what you want once and then you get the items in the mail every day ? 
  in that case , i think it 's actually a nice investment . 
  best of luck to all !, 
  from the wiki, 
  although many tyrians call the risen minions of zhaitan `` undead '' due to their rotten appearance , they are not undead in a standard , tyrian sense as even the living , plants , and very environment can be twisted by the same dragon corruption that creates risen without the need of dying first . 
  instead , they are simply beings that have been influenced by a death-based dragon corruption ; though most risen are made by corrupting corpses , such is not a requirement . 
  as such , the only undead seen in modern continental tyria are the minions summoned by necromancers . 
  however , elona has become a nation full of both the living and undead ever since palawa joko had conquered the land . 
  i 'm from prague so i can not help you much , but have you already seen the brno episode of honest guide ? 
  really ? 
  to me it looks like it could be from some early tony hawk game . 
  guess i will have to take another look at it , thanks !, 
  there seem to be literally 0 qol upgrades in the expansion . 
  which makes me think that the first big patch after the exp release would be a qol feature pack . 
  there 's also this hero panel for mounts , which is not present in the videos . 
  the base game is free , with no montly costs whatsoever , so you are free to try it . 
  if you like it , you can buy the expansion/expansions bundle . 
  that will unlock not only the expansions , but also the full potential of the base game ( there are some restrictions for free players ) . 
  other stuff ( like living story ) you can buy with ingame currency . 
  arenanet nor ncsoft are not present in the exhibitors list . 
  it seems weird that they would travel all the way to the gamescom if they did not have a booth there though . 
  i think that the hate towards the eu is mostly caused by the fact that eu is terrible at communicating its pros . 
  you do n't see a news article that says how eu funded some highway or whatever , you see that eu banned `` pomaz\u00e1nkov\u00e9 m\u00e1slo '' . 
  medias are responsible for the hatred . 
  try to call instead . 
  which is why there absolutely should not be a czexit referendum . 
  video is actually exactly what would make me download the broswer . 
  i need to see it in action first . 
  they actually built in this thing called `` action camera '' right into the game , you just have to enable it in the game .
