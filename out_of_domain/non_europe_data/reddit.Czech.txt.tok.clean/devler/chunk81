  * increase mailbox size, 
  * increase the number of sent mails in short time at least to 4 ( sending potions for rest of the party ), 
  * add `` unlocked/locked '' option to trading post, 
  many o2 users are now using datomat ( you can catch data like pokemons and use them to renew the plan for free if you run out ) . 
  beware that these extra data do not work abroad . 
  found out myself last week . 
  after i had run out of 1,5 gb , i had to buy more data . 
  think gliders . 
  sure , you can get one or two skins ingame , but rest will probably be gemstore items . 
  indeed , a new forum . 
  exactly . 
  i mean , half of the answers in this thread presume that people will not respond . 
  reminds me of victor lustig . 
  this man sold the eiffel tower . 
  twice . 
   adjusted the no-gameplay area around the alpine borderlands jumping puzzle . 
  more catmander tags incoming !, 
  raptor is not able to use ( some ) stairs and you have to use the leap to go up the stairs . 
  czech republic has a very high density of shopping centres per capita . 
  so for general shopping ( electronics , clothes , cosmetics ) , that would be the go-to destination for most of us . 
  just take a look at the shopping centres in prague : https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/seznam_n%c3%a1kupn%c3%adch_center_v_praze - biggest being chodov , \u010cern\u00fd most , zli\u010d\u00edn , palladium , ark\u00e1dy , fl\u00f3ra , nov\u00fd sm\u00edchov , harfa and let\u0148any . 
  if you need groceries , just pick what 's near . 
  whether it will be albert , tesco , kaufland , billa , lidl , penny market , globus or coop . 
  for electronics , alza and czc should be where you go first . 
  as far as i know , it 's also illegal to die in the houses of parliament in the uk . 
  one thing that i really dislike about the expansion so far is the [ current oasis loading screen ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/loadinginfo/uploads/pof/2017/07/26/1501109142-concept17.jpg ) . 
  it looks so semi-finished . 
  why did they not use [ this one instead ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/loadinginfo/uploads/pof/2017/07/26/1501109195-concept20.jpg ) ? 
  it 's one of the most beautiful concept arts for gw2 i 've ever seen . 
  would hype me much more to play !, 
  and based on your screenshots , it 's a location from this map . 
  except for your hairline . 
  sure , maintaing a healthy diet makes your hair grow , but working out actually has the opposite effect . 
  testosterone turns into dht , which accelerates pattern hair loss . 
  technically , the level cap goes up . 
  you got the mastery levels and you can level up to 193 now . 
  the new cap will probably be at least 252 . 
  it 's not like you are multiple times more powerful than a level 80 though , you just unlock mostly qol stuff . 
  it 's called chalice of tears for a reason . 
  which is 7 years old . 
  that 's pretty obsolete in terms of technology advancement . 
  the way you get on and off the mount might suggest that mounts are you though . 
  * cough * griffon * cough *, 
  i know that , it 's a really well done . 
  they are kinda like pokemons when i think about it . 
  no , i do n't think its suited for children . 
  there will already be meta builds by the time the xpac drops because of the beta weekend . 
  ~ ~ we just tried and it does n't seem to be fixed . 
  no one seen any anomaly fragment get in . ~ ~, 
  edit : tried it again and got the achievement, 
  might be the case . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but was n't that a gta v mission ? 
  the [ european license plates ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vehicle_registration_plates_of_europe ) are exactly like that . 
  as a warrior who 's always faster than the rest of the zerg , i like this !, 
  if it 's high resolution and it 's solid color , you can easily live trace it . 
  otherwise , you will have to do it manually . 
  i 'm pleasantly surprised that many of said features are in the game now . 
  try switching between fullscreen and windowed mode . 
  it 's certainly much better than at release , but not what i was expecting . 
  they kinda overhyped the whole `` windows as a service , big update twice a year ! '', 
  thing . 
  sure they did , but they advertised the updates being as big as a new windows edition . 
  the updates we are getting are good , but small . 
  and promised features get cut off all the time . 
  my name . 
  i made a brand out of it . 
  laptop manufacturers usually have their own software for that if you can not find it in windows . 
  i know it 's not 100 % what you are looking for , but if wo n't be able to find chocobis , you can try buying milka choco minis or diskito . 
  they are basically the same . 
  you are at the end of 100 cm and the leader decides to troll the group by afking . 
  what do you do then ? 
  i still do n't see why that would be a problem . 
  taxes vary from country to country in europe as well , and yet , all the stores include the tax in the price , even the multinational stores . 
  europe is not just britain . 
  i can see why that would be a problem now . 
  why is n't the tax state-wide ? 
  at least it 's not a ripoff . 
  those are very cheap souvenirs . 
  $ 1 for a glass of beer . 
  i 'm czech , so pretty much every other country i go to , i have to buy expensive and often shitty beer . 
  [ here you go ! ] ( http://shopeasy.by/redirect/cpa/o/ovm717p0h3dfvpei7kpzdzbg62ons8cb/ ) . 
  only available for this weekend . 
  fixed !, 
  link changed to better one !, 
  and dollar, 
  it says, 
  `` never delay kissing a pretty girl or opening a bottle of whiskey . '', 
  there 's not much to be fair , and if there is , it 's pretty badly executed . 
  this and couple following scenes would be closest to what you would call flat design https://youtu.be/yf3ycvphp7g?t=33, 
  can anyone build me a house which looks like a hollywood mansion ? 
  czechia and chechnya, 
  [ american gods have the best execution imo ] ( http://www.lawrence.lib.ks.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/american-gods-posters.jpg ), 
  i do n't know where you live but these prices are about 50 % off when comparing to my local levi 's stores . 
  up to 15 000 czk fine when you steal things with a value of 4999 czk or lower . 
  6 months to 12 years jailtime if the value is higher . 
  bought 2 pieces from this seller . 
  it 's a good quality and even the assistants at the store could n't tell the difference when my friend went there to clean it , 
  yeah , buying anything cosmetic related ( from makeup to teeth whiteners ) are quite risky and you never know . 
  just wanted to share it , i think some people might still appreciate it .
