  where are you getting your brushes from ? 
  there are two ( [ 1 ] ( http://shopeasy.by/redirect/cpa/o/ovyx1jumptkjthycru50vr1v3uko3qcj/ ) and [ 2 ] ( http://shopeasy.by/redirect/cpa/o/ovyx1xcohxhls5o1s2aywkmw5ayppyh1/ ) but i 'm not quite sure about the quality . 
  this might sound a little harsh , but i do n't know how else should i put it . 
  you should actually learn how to design before you make tutorials . 
  i 'd probably make the d same weight as o , but otherwise it looks really good !, 
  how is that a problem to the first world people ? 
  there 's a himym episode about thst , it 's called ` hooked ', 
  i 'm not looking for a cheaper alternative . 
  what i was actually saying is that the coffee my father is drinking is dirt cheap , which got me thinking , if using the nespresso cups would taste better . 
  i was just wondering if there 's a way to reuse the cups . 
  yeah , runescape kinda does this and it 's still running their old engine , constantly getting updated . 
  it 's not perfect , but you can basically play without the loading screens . 
  could be a new mastery . 
  can confirm , i do it with every single bag since . 
  if i 'd use lube ( not butt stuff ) it would be like swimming in the ocean . 
  / r/imgoingtohellforthis approves !, 
  and maria salazar looks like pablo 's wife and chris feistl looks like murphy . 
  stop spoiling season 5 of narcos . 
  i 'd say that we would be getting expac4 in the approximately same time of the year as this one . 
  but next time , they might squeeze a little more content . 
  as long as you purchased os x , you are free to use it . 
  for ux or photography part of design , sure . 
  otherwise , not really . 
  look at the reddit thumbnail and you will see what 's wrong with it . 
  it 's basically illegible at this size . 
  looks a lot like zefani stencil , but it 's not it . 
  if he was asking for a gold instead , he might have a better success rate . 
  or count olaf . 
  czech public transport too !, 
  this might be a problem with electric cars as well . 
  it will take time for people to get used to the silence . 
  same thing with non-dslr cameras making shutter noise i guess . 
  then there should n't be an option to turn the sound off , no ? 
  i think we 're hyping this expansion more than anet . 
  comparing to hot announcement , path of fire is being pretty underhyped by their side . 
  might be a good thing though , as we could be pleasantly surprised . 
  it 's basically the eu version for the price of us version . 
  no losses . 
  nope , gw2 is at stable 2 gb ram and about 30 % cpu . 
  other programs are insignificant . 
  yes , no visible problems in the task manager . 
  actually , started to read about 10 % losses on 213.46.180.90 . 
  so how do i solve that ? 
  same problem with gtx 950 . 
  yeah , reinstalled geforce experience and all is well now . 
  thank you !, 
  which is why you buy a nespresso . 
  the nvidia night light bugs still persist . 
  that 's a fairly expensive approach , is n't it ?

  and once you start engaging with a certain niche , it will give you suggestions based on what you like . 
  i think the color tells you the guaranteed rarity of the item . 
  we decided to choose infantile mode , we 're here , i guess one checkpoint before world 2 zone 1 boss . 
  what to do now ? 
  how do we cross those trees to get to another cloud ? 
  does anyone know why it does n't work ? 
  do we have any alternatives to this ? 
  i could really use one right now . 
  i know about http://www.gw2legendary.com/ but i think that i 'm either dumb because i do n't know how to use it or it requires a fb login ( which does n't work for me ), 
  ever since i upgraded my win 8 to win 8.1 my gw2 is more laggy , has a significant drop in frames - from 40 to 25 etc. 
  i do n't know if it came with the halloween update or windows 8.1 , but now for me it is almost unplayable . 
  anyone having the same issues , can i solve them somehow ? 
  the thing is i am about 200g from getting my sunrise done . 
  i run cof , hotw and ac everyday ( and salvage token armor for globs ) i do full gathering ( ori + ancient logs ) on 1 char , i do dailies and exchange laurels for mats . 
  i 'm really bored of these , because it 's just not fun , but i want my legendary before christmas ... 
  i 'm just getting bored of constant activities , does anyone know any moneymaking which is fun just a little ? 
  guess what ? 
  we are now right next to tts . 
  it 's in the welcome !, 
  section with useful links on the right side of / r/guildwars2 / subreddit !, 
  will season 2 starts immediately after season 1 or we will get a few weeks break ? 
  i do n't feel like doing 20 more achievements again right now . 
  also wvw season 2 speculations thread .

  at the acolytes , you now ca n't run down to the safe spot , it 's blocked now . 
  any other hidden nerfs ? 
  pretty much it . 
  thank you anet !, 
  edit : from few responses i can read that party chat always stayed after leaving a group , but clearly not when changing map , sorry for the confusion . 
  you can let the thread die now , 
  there was a [ banner contest ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/grandtheftautov/comments/1vet4w/rgrandtheftautov_banner_contest/ ) closed 2 weeks back . 
  still no results and no winners . 
  how it 's going , can we get any statement ?
