  do n't upvote , just a quick question . 
  is there a lore-wise explanation why was n't eotm avaible to us before this patch ? 
  it does n't look like it 's just a day old sice everything is built in there etc. 
  and skillpoints and vistas . 
  it deserves players !, 
  new players can easily miss it because it 's not needed for 100 % world completion ( same as labyrinthine cliffs , pvp maps ) . 
  but still , it 's a regular , not temporary map , so i do n't see a point why there should n't be at least 6 hearts ( for example waypoint places + steampipe steading ) , few vistas and skillpoints ) . 
  you did a great job with the meta event , this brings players to the map at least few times a day , but still that 's not enough . 
  also , those pre-events would need bigger timer/should occur one by one , since every settlement is recaptured by karka in matter of 10 minutes which would make doing hearts pretty rough . 
  and southsun cove should be accessible from morgan 's spiral too . 
  why is there a dominion of winds ' wall blocking the entrance to southsun cove ? 
  i was on a 14 day vacation so i did n't log in the game for this time . 
  sadly now i have found that i 've been kicked out of tks . 
  i was an attacker and i 've participated in about 30 tequatl kills so it was n't really happy that i ca n't join those fights anymore . 
  is there a reason behind kicking people out ? 
  this might be common to a lot of people but since i 've just started dancing ( standard ) this is new to me . 
  you can dance slow jive to most slowfox songs , it becomes pretty useful at training when you 're tired or when you want to just rest but do n't want to sit around . 
  it even does n't look any bad , instead it looks pretty comfortable when you are out of energy . 
  i 'm not really sure if this is the right subreddit but i will give it a try . 
  can anyone identify name of those songs ? 
  i want to use them for training , 
   aftermath, 
  a small release will be available on march 18 , which will provide an epilogue to recent events . 
  that release will show the aftermath of what players experience in the battle for lion 's arch and will conclude the current story arc . 
  i had my hopes high until i 've noticed the word `` small '' . 
  i hoped that we will actually continue the story with the ` new ' evil villain at least a little or start of rebuilding la. 
  what do you think will happen ? 
  i hope that it wo n't be only the same cutscene we can see when we use a finisher in the last instance . 
  ( do n't want to spoil anything to players who never finished this story arc . ), 
  ~ ~ alright , check this tweet by mordremoth . 
  ~ ~ i 'm not sure if this twitter account is real ( can someone confirm ? ), 
  but the dragon is talking about the tengu region in between of kessex hills and lion 's arch . 
  if this is real , i 'm 99 % sure we will see more things going on with this zone soon . ~ ~, 
  edit : [ apparently , the account is fake ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/1zpmno/new_zone_spoiler/cfw4uar ), 
  so i found this map of eb . 
  it still amazes me how different the game was in the development stage . 
  does anyone have a gameplay of it or more stuff ? 
  alright , as a leader of one guild , i 'm very happy that there 's the last login function on it 's way , which will be extremely useful when cleaning up the guild . 
  but my main concern is that it will be just the last login ... today , every single player is in multiple guilds . 
  i personally am member of 5 and the last time i represented different guild was like a month ago . 
  and this is the problem here , a player can be active in game , but not representing the guild for like 6 months , which wo n't be kicked . 
  but a member , who was active for 5 months and now he 's inactive , will be kicked . 
  the guy who was more inactive stays - that just does n't make any sense . 
  guilds will then still have people who are basically inactive . 
  please anet , do n't make just last login date function , make last representing date function too !, 
  roses are red, 
  violets are blue, 
  tracy is dead, 
  robin i love you .
