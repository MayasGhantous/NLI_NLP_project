  * metrica province, 
  the public one , recipe is still there . 
  which is too bad , everyone from my wvw guild or basically whole server used it as a buff everytime they went to wvw :(, 
  ** solved **, 
  thanks guys for your responses, 
  do n't upvote , i have just this one quick question :, 
  i 've wanted to get a wvw overlay but i ca n't really get them to work or they 're not avaible for download . 
  then i came across this, 
  it looks really cool and might be as good as other overlays . 
  but since it works with your screen position etc , i 'm not really sure if it 's not against rules . 
  can anyone answer me ? 
  also i know that anet said that they ca n't approve any stuff , but it 's like we can clearly say that gw2stuff overlay is ok and wo n't get you banned . 
  but i 'm not really sure about this app . 
  i thought that you might be interested in [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4lzinmu.jpg ) . 
  sometimes i wish we had so many people interested in wvw . 
  on the other hand , i do n't think i could wait in position 828 for eb . 
  it 's been on sgamer.com for a while , so if anyone has already posted it , i want to apologize , 
  what do you think guys ? 
  i 'd love to have android like this , 
  this is really something what i 'd like to know . 
  why were those old crt tvs curved ( convex ) ? 
  also , why are the new expensive tvs curved too ( concave ) ? 
  if curvy is better , why do we even have flat screen tvs ? 
  the gold sellers are getting really out of hand . 
  today i was online only for 3 hours ( wvw after reset ) and in these 3 hours , i got 12 whispers from 12 different gold sellers . 
  not to mention that after i went back to vigil keep , 3 gold spammers welcomed me in map chat . 
  and not only these people are the problem , there are so many players being offensive and they 're punished loooong after they are being rude ... 
  and . . 
  i got this idea , it worked very well in runescape , so why it would n't work here . 
  so , how does it work ? 
  i 'll quote from rs wiki :, 
  `` player moderators are chosen specifically by jagex staff based on their truthfulness , maturity , involvement in the runescape in-game and forum communities , and by the accuracy of abuse reports ( therefore , not reporting someone for extremely minor reasons , or just because you can ) . 
  they must also have a secure account . 
  though they do not have to play a certain amount of time , most moderators have played 1 year or more before being asked to join the team . 
  it is mentioned that being on the forums helps being noticed . '', 
  some of those people thereafter get an invite to become player moderators . 
  if they accept , they got a silver crown next to their name . 
  ** but the amazing thing they can do : immediately mute anyone for 48 hours . 
  ** player moderators in runescape also had some cool privileges ( like joining sessions with game staff and discussing things ) but they are not as necessary or important as the ability to mute . 
  so i 'd love to have this addition to the game . 
  i think it would improve the quality of life by 100 % . 
  i do n't think there 's any better solution to the gold sellers . 
  in rs , it has been a very big honor to become a player moderator so they did n't abuse their powers very much . 
  if they did , they were punished ( it 's like now when you report a player who did n't do anything , there 's a chance that you might be getting a ban for abusing report system . 
  if you were a player moderator , you would immediately lose your status and could get banned for abusing this system more easily than regular player . 
  this made pmods very responsible for their actions . ),

  i 'd like to ask specificaly big wvw servers/tequatl & wurm guild , how do you manage teamspeak with 100 or more people ? 
  tonight at aurora glade we have to kick out people from ts because when there are 100 ( or more ) people , whole ts gets quiet and no one ca n't hear a thing . 
  how can we solve it ? 
  edit : also i 'd like to clarify we have a server for 500 people ( currently at 220/500 ) , the channel is the problem where ca n't be more than 100 people . 
  i 'll be visiting london in summer . 
  it will be 4 days trip so i wanted to ask you , is there any 3 days transport ticket ( for buses , underground etc ) ? 
  it seems like there 's only london pass but since my budget is not that big , i want to know if it 's worth it , because i do n't know most of the attractions which are for london pass . 
  so i guess my choices are many single use transport tickets / london pass . 
  how much does the transport ticket cost and how long is the duration of it ? 
  title says it all . 
  why can we wp to different borderlands but we ca n't wp to obsidian sanctum . 
  why 's that ? 
  do n't upvote , i 'm vising london in 2 weeks and i want to visit those 2 attractions above . 
  i want to save some money so i 'm buying the tickets online in a pack, 
  it says `` your tickets are valid for 30 days from your date selected to visit madame tussauds and london eye . '', 
  so i selected the day i 'll arrive ( 3rd august ) hoping that i could visit it whenever i like during the week in london . 
  but then they want me to choose time ? 
  why do i have to choose time ? 
  will i be able to visit those 2 attractions only in time i 've selected ? 
  using the air aspect i managed to get over the hill to the now locked part of dry top . 
  i also managed to get some screens , which might contain spoilers , take a look [ here ! ] ( http://imgur.com/a/3ezpx#0 ) !,

  thank you arenanet !, 
  this is way better than it was before , 
  global blue is a great thing for shopping . 
  you go to a shop , you buy some stuff , request a global blue form , send the form to global blue and they will send you money which equals to the country 's taxed . 
  i go to gap , buy jeans for 50 $ ( jeans are 40 $ + tax ) , fill out the form , send it to global blue , they will send me 10 $ . 
  where does this money come from ?
