  survey is now closed and i bring the results !, 
  first i 'd like to thank every single person who has participated in this survey . 
  i 've collected amazing ** 3500 ** responses before i closed the survey !, 
  original thread can be found [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/2fmlje/poll_what_new_feature_are_you_most_excited_about/ ) . 
  i 've noticed many people complaining that my survey does n't have a `` none '' option . 
  i 'd like to clarify that none ca n't be a favourite feature , so that 's kinda why i did n't include this answer in my poll . 
  i also got 432 incomplete responses ( people who have n't fully finished the survey ) , mostly i guess because they did n't find the `` none '' option , so we can probably say that this number represents people completely uninterested in september 's feature pack . 
  the results are actually kinda surprising ( at least to me ) .

  i guess that 's all . 
  hope you enjoyed that , i 'd like to thank again everyone who have participated and also i 'd like to apologize to all people who were complaining about something my poll is missing or stuff like that , will try better next time !, 
  ^ please ^ keep ^ in ^ mind ^ that ^ all ^ percentage ^ numbers ^ are ^ rounded . 
  we have this on a guild forum for a while but since we are going to have a wvw tournament soon , a guildie asked me to put it here , for everyone , 
  1 ) do n't join teamspeak , i mean , who wants to listen to drunk dudes trying to pronounce tongue twisters etc. 
  and you are not blind , you can follow commander even without ts . 
  2 ) do n't let commander waste his rams at gates , be sure to drop down at least 5 yours so everyone can choose their favourite ram to be built . 
  3 ) if you do n't like color red , then definitely do n't ctrl+t on commander . 
  4 ) if enemies are trebbing the wall from safe place , be sure to use all of supplies the objective has to repair it . 
  5 ) take supplies only from objectives which are upgrading . 
  6 ) screw the dolyaks , do n't even mind giving them swiftness . 
  7 ) if you join ts after all , adjust the musicbot volume to max so you ca n't really hear anything but the rocking music . 
  8 ) if you need to attack gate , walls or defeat enemy zerg , correct siege to be built is ballista . 
  9 ) do n't stick with commander , you 're not his slave , move freely where you want to go . 
  10 ) chase every enemy you see , you never know what they 're up to , better kill them . 
  11 ) do n't look at the chat , it 's waste of your time , better check your facebook . 
  12 ) when supervisor/lord has righteous indignation , melee attack it . 
  we need to finish daily reviver somewhere . 
  13 ) do n't kill enemy dolyaks , they 're cute animals . 
  14 ) chase players all the way to legendary defenders , yolo right ? 
  15 ) do n't finish your enemies even when you have bloodlust , it 's time consuming and we 're tired of llamas already . 
  16 ) so you really want to use map/team chat ? 
  ok , but make sure you use different language than english so we can practice our knowledge of languages . 
  17 ) if you buy yourself a commander tag , use it only for pve . 
  18 ) if you see big swords somewhere , be quiet about it . 
  19 ) if you can guild claim objectives , do it only if your guild does n't have any wvw bonuses . 
  20 ) do n't use veils , veils are for noobs . 
  21 ) if you need to do some irl stuff , do n't log out , you can afk in wvw so you wo n't wait in the queue when you get back . 
  22 ) if there 's already a musicbot on ts , make sure to bring your own because one is never enough . 
  23 ) when your tower/keep or whatever is going to get flipped , do n't take any supplies from it . 
  do n't be greedy , enemies need the supplies too !,
