  24 ) when you need to do map completion ( skillpoints , pois , vistas ) , do it on friday right after the reset !, 
  25 ) talk dirty all the time . 
  we need some tough guys . 
  26 ) if you have an access to guild bank , withdraw everything from it, 
  27 ) do n't use any nourishments like food and maintenance oils , they 're expensive and wo n't help you much . 
  28 ) make sure you get every sentry when commander needs the zerg to move somewhere quickly . 
  ## do not take any of these seriously , just do the opposite . 
  it makes sense in pve . 
  i actually really like it and find it useful , but in pvp it 's completely pointless . 
  it should be disabled after few games ( when player learns what to do ) or it should n't be there at all . 
  when a certain point is captured , the event icon is above captured point icon so i ca n't tell by minimap if the point is taken by us or the other team . 
  and it 's kinda annoying turning it off and on every time i switch pve/pvp . 
  i just wanted to say thanks anet for this addition . 
  i 've been waiting for this for months and now when we have the colored tags , the wvw feels much more alive . 
  i know it 's day 1 of fall tournament so the wvw is just supposed to be crowded but i 've been actively participating in each tournament and it 's kinda different this time . 
  guilds cooperate much more with pug commanders and it 's soo easier to cooardinate all forces on particular map . 
  this change might look small , but it has huge impact on the way we play wvw . 
  so , thanks anet !, 
  now , this feature which you can turn on and off in general settings - camera settings can really put the immersive feeling into the game . 
  but i found out that lately i have headaches playing guild wars 2 , especially when farming labyrinth . 
  so a guildie told me about this option . 
  it even says `` enabling can cause dizziness and motion sickness '' . 
  eventhough i do n't feel dizzy all the time , this option really improves my gaming experience as the game feels more smooth and enjoyable , especially during boss battles ( like in labyrinth ) or certain jumping puzzles . 
  i 'm not sure if this is a common knowledge as i found out about this after 2 years of playing . 
  try it on your own , the difference is especially big if you try to turn it off/on during some boss battle ( with viscount etc ) .

  [ solved ] , thanks / u/nhbt321, 
  now , this could be really hard to find out but i firmly believe that someone can do it . 
  [ this ] ( https://what-if.xkcd.com/11/ ) could help a bit . 
  so , here 's te deal . 
  i need a logo for this website , which could be later applied to merchandise as well . 
  i need it to be themed in these black and yellow-green colors . 
  i need a simple plain logo ** without any text ** , something which will represent the woodworking . 
  if you will want to show some final product , let it only be a table , because tables are our focus . 
  examples of what looks amazing to me :, 
  thanks very much !, 
  could you please make our eyes normal ? 
  thanks a lot !, 
  so , this is my second year doing the secret santa exchange , for the first time , i 'd like to ship into another country . 
  the only problem here is that the prices extremely vary . 
  lowest price is to poland ( $ 10 ) , second one is the united states ( $ 15 ) . 
  the problem comes when i get matched to someone from e.g. 
  montenegro or finland ( $ 40 ) . 
  you see , i 'm willing to pay the shipping up to + - $ 15 . 
  i really want to participate in the global santa , but the shipping to some countries is just extremely expensive . 
  is there any way i could select to which countries i want ship to ?
