  congratz to the winner , / u/staticthreat, 
  this will not make you any money ( or it will if you 're into / r/flipping ) , but could save a lot . 
  shop on russian websites !, 
  thanks to the amazingly low exchange rate between rubles and other currencies ( like euros or dollars ) , you can get some really low prices on various things right now, 
  i just ordered flight tickets from prague ( where i live ) to bangkok ( from aeroflot ) , simply because they are ~ $ 450 cheaper than they were 2 months ago . 
  you can get some really cheap electronics and other stuff too , i bumped into this website http://www.ozon.ru/ which can offer black-friday like prices . 
  today , with the [ mv - mobile video reimagined ] ( http://www.erlibird.com/go/mv-mobile-video-reimagined ) , erli bird showed us a new type of focus group :, 
  * 40 cash rewards available *, 
  the top 40 users that provide the highest quality , most helpful feedback for this iteration earn a cash reward ( max $ 10 , average $ 5 ) . 
  ** all quality feedback earns karma : **, 
  * trade karma for paid apps, 
  * itunes movies or music, 
  * audible or kindle books, 
  * games on steam, 
  ** feedback is rated by : **, 
  * the product owners, 
  * trusted erlibird members . 
  this will basically mean that there will be much bigger competition in providing quality feedback , as only the best reviews will get paid . 
  this should filter out the ninja takers , who used to claim cash reward spots and then provided bad quality feedback ( a feedback of let 's say 50 words ) and should reward the people who give good quality feedbacks . 
  i do n't know if the number of users who could claim the cash reward was bigger earlier , but if it 's not , this might also discourage the people who have given good feedback before , but just were n't in the top 40 . 
  here 's / r/erlibird / payment proof , as you can see the site pays very well too :, 
  click request code , enter it in the redeem box and select the software you want . 
  you can get :, 
  * ashampoo \u00ae burning studio 2015, 
  * ashampoo \u00ae music studio 4, 
  * ashampoo \u00ae photo commander 11, 
  these normally cost altogether $ 109.95 , so grab them while you can . 
  we will rock you, 
  hello , i need to combine these 2 pictures, 
  i need to move the bottom guy from the second picture to the bottom first picture so those all people would be in one image . 
  i tried but i could n't make it look real . 
  no color changes if not necessary please , thanks !, 
  [ head over here and select your reward ] ( http://erlibird.com/karma-rewards ), 
  you can choose your own reward from this list :, 
  * ios app ( $ 3 or less ) - 70 points, 
  * reddit gold ( 1 month ) - 92 points,

  * you should get your selected reward in matter of 24 hours .

  you might have experienced some troubles with logging in via facebook/google . 
  here 's erli bird 's comment on that :, 
   * note : our social logins are currently offline , due to an outage at our third party login provider , janrain . 
  we 'll extend any focus groups that end during this time . 
  it seems like the old focus groups are back . 
  you can now again choose if you 'd like to get a cash reward , karma or make a donation . 
  ** you can only join one cash-reward focus group every 3 days . 
  what i liked about the new focus groups was that you could get cash reward no matter what if you provided supreme feedback , now you might not even be able to join a focus group in time because all spots might be claimed already . 
  somehow i managed to get / r / in top left , but of course i 'd like to have it next to erlibird - subreddits name .
