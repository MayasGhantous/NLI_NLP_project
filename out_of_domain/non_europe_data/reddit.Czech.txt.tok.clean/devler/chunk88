  at least half of the s3 was about some voting in iowa , about 1 year before the actual choosing of the president . 
  since i 'm from europe , the election works different way here . 
  could anyone explain me how do the elections work in house of cards ( in the usa ) ? 
  if the president has to win in so many states , how it all will fit in s4 , since only the iowa voting took at least 7 episodes ?

  normally , the longest-serving ambassador to a country is given the doyen title . 
  in countries that have roman catholicism as the official or dominant religion , the apostolic nuncio is chosen to be the doyen . 
  czech republic is the most atheistic country in the world and still , their doyen is a nuncio .

  yesterday i thought that i could cheer up my girlfriend a little so i decided i could buy her some flowers . 
  it was my first time buying flowers online . 
  of course i selected that i want them to be delivered to her , i mean , if i wanted to deliver it by myself , i could just go to a store and buy them much cheaper . 
  so i ordered them and did n't really pay attention to the payment and delivery details . 
  my girlfriend just called me a few moments ago and i realised that i left cash-on-delivery option selected . 
  it 's not amazon balance , it 's a $ 24,64 gift card from the affiliate program .

  i 'm making a logo for my client which is a company that makes and sells watches made from wood . 
  they love this concept , but they 'd prefer a different font . 
  any ideas which fonts would suit it the best ?

  my little sister ( 13 years old ) wake up earlier this week and she could n't smile with half of her face or even blink . 
  later that day , she has been diagnosed with peripheral paresis , which results in partial loss of movement in her facial muscles - she ca n't control her left half of the face . 
  she now has an eye patch so her eye does n't dry out , she has to take a lot of pills , needs to attend exercise sessions every day and she ca n't even smile anymore , which is very sad to look at , because she had been a really joyful kid . 
  we do n't know how long she will be going through this ( it can take from few weeks to few months ) . 
  anything will cheer her up . 
  and even though she ca n't smile , i know she will appreciate it . 
  edit : i 'm truly amazed how kind people here are !, 
  i 've received tons of responses and pms , i 'm still replying to them . 
  i ca n't express how happy and thankful i am . 
  thank you so much !, 
  my sis will definitely feel much better and happier now !, 
   you guys are the best !,

  i stumbled upon this great designer clothing shop , where you get ** $ 25 off your first order ** ( you can find a few things below this price there ! ), 
  you sign up here [ ref ] ( https://www.stockmfg.co/?___store=default&ref=ymsyctrhtdbmn1e9 ) l [ no ref ] ( https://stockmfg.co ) , you get $ 25 store credit you can use on your ** first ** order . 
  if you refer someone , he gets the $ 25 sign up bonus and you earn $ 25 the first time a friend you referred buys !, 
  the clothing looks really good and i 've already shopped with them before ( i believe it was secret santa exchange ) , everything came really nice packed and my giftee was very happy about the gift . 
  you only pay the shipping ( it 's quite expensive outside the us , but otherwise it 's fine ) . 
  i 'm making a logo for an interior design company . 
  i 'm pretty happy about what i have now , but i kinda struggle with the name .
