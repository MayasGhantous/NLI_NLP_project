  i upgraded my pc to win10 few months ago and i 'm pretty happy with it so i installed it on my laptop as well . 
  the upgrade commenced and after the first restart , everything turned black . 
  the screen was on , i could turn it off , but nothing was showing , not even the mouse cursor . 
  after a while , i figured that once i change the boot mode to legacy support instead of uefi , everything goes back to normal and works fine . 
  why does n't the uefi work ?

  i have huawei p8 lite with android 5.0 ( emui 3.1 ) . 
  i always loved the colored status bars which i believed were introduced in android 4.4 kitkat . 
  i 'm talking about the status bar color , which changes to the same color scheme the opened app has . 
  the problem is , i do n't have this on all apps . 
  it 's functional on snapchat or vienna travel guide app . 
  but that 's it . 
  does every phone have the colored status bar while using these apps ( even 4.3 and lower ) or is this just some sort of emui bug ? 
  pm me for more details, 
  edit : i got really lucky !,
