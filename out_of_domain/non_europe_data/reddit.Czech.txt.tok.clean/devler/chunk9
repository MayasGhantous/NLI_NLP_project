  sure you can buy some boosters or golds with gems , but mostly you use gems for skins . 
  i 've never bought anything for real money . 
  you can buy everything in game with in game currency ( and it 's not that expensive ), 
  4 ) gw2 community is actually one of the best you can find in mmo universe , on this reddit are several posts per month by new users who are surprised how nice we are :d, 
  i know it 's really not gw2 related , but since it 's from ncsoft , everybody in my guild talk about this and want to try this . 
  so i thought i might share it here for you guys , 
  open them now !, 
  eu is just better packed , that 's the only difference , 
  ac p1 buy for less than 2g . 
  try underwater combat . 
  also diving , 
  or try to get activites achievements ? 
   a player 's world is considered the world on which they were most active during the tournament . 
   transferring worlds during a tournament prevents players from entering the mist war for the duration of their current matchup and the following wvw matchup . 
  - players are still able to play in the edge of the mists during this period . 
  i think it actually behaves like there is an other city in the region . 
  i get tourists even though i 'm the only one city . 
  or build another city , it 's that simple , 
  i have not tried it myself , but i assumed it 's correct because they 've said it [ here ] ( https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/get-ready-for-wvw-spring-tournament-2014/ ) . 
  ascended is still not standard equipment , no one has a problem with person wearing exotics , 
  in wvw they 're basically the better average , but in pve warriors are op . 
  as far as i know , thieves are pretty good in pve for their dps , in wvw they 're amazing in small scale battles . 
  1 ) is wvw queue shared across 3 servers fighting each other or each server has it 's own ? 
  2 ) `` victory in the edge of the mists provides a supply drop to the citadel in your borderlands map . '', 
  might be a stupid question but where does it drop exactly ? 
  3 ) can anyone send me the best mesmer wvw build ? 
  also swiftness and feedback , 
  no , only enemies can see it , 
  warriors are also good for this purpose :, 
  gs skill 3 and 5 , sword leap , bull 's charge for escaping, 
  dolyak signet for stability, 
  signet of rage , horn charge for unlimited swiftness, 
  and no one will ever catch you . 
  and in wvw, 
  i wonder how come that mesmer are last . 
  it 's my second most favourite profession after warrior , 
  you can try to send a ticket , 
  probably running with zerg , veils , portals , support , 
  it 's pretty clear that the image is photoshopped . 
  jaime you lost your hand one season ago , everybody knows that . 
  does ninjas look at the ninja list ? 
  my favourite :, 
  [ the foreskins - murder train ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnj3f7-dcqy ), 
  i do n't mind spies watching what other server do on map , mesmer spies porting up somewhere etc , but i hate people who go on enemy server 's ts and scout there . 
  not fair play . 
  oh i 'm so desperate for more gw2 strip comics like [ bitt & bott ] ( http://www.madsciencecomic.com/bitt-bott-the-guild-wars-2-comic ) . 
  if some of your comics would basically make fun of the game like these do it would be amazing :3, 
   gatherable node locations are still randomized in every map instance . 
  oh i just realised this is basically the end for all node websites =  no more orichalcum/ancient wood runs :(, 
  also does anyone know how will my character look on pvp ? 
  will the appearance transfer when i log in the game or when i go into hotm ? 
  i played mainly warrior in both aion and gw2 . 
  but i actually liked more aion professions than gw2 professions , i assume because in aion you just sit and use up all my skills as you said and warrior in gw2 needs least moving of all classes . 
  so i would choose from these : warrior for least moving , ranger for having fun with animals , mesmer if she wants to look sexy . 
  interesting that lol is at the very end of the list . 
  i did n't really expect it to be that worse than gw2 . 
  personally i 've never spent a single penny on this game .

  3 ) tequatl is now the second hardest boss in the game , so it needs a bit more coordination than a mindless semi-afk zerg . 
  guilds only for killing tequatl were created and for the people who do n't want to join a guild are those reddit organized kills the best way to kill the tequatl . 
  people who are doubting if it 's legit or not . . 
  what you think game does when you open tp ? 
  it access this very same site ( this is the reason why sometimes you can get browser-like errors in game ) . 
  tp window is just a little internet browser which access this site . 
  does n't the gamebooster itself turn off the aero ? 
  well it 's mostly fort panic what did you expect :d, 
  im proud of aurora glade players like you, 
  there 's no such thing as login at the tp website , you login at guildwars2.com which grants you access to tp website . . 
  when you login via gw2 launcher , you login info goes to account-live . ncplatform.net, 
  just try to log the connection and you 'll see that launcher access this very same webpage . 
  gw2spidy uses raw data like samuirai posted, 
  i do n't think it 's more comfortable than actual tp . . 
  how do you even remember your name ? 
  has science gone too far ? 
  please take a few seconds to answer this little survey , would really appreciate it , it 's only 3 questions , 
  of course , results will be up on this subreddit tomorrow , 
   results will be up on this subreddit tomorrow , 
  do you know by any chance how much did it approximately cost ? 
  all , 
  man that 's a lot !, 
  is your main focus rp ? 
  i would consider it being pve . 
  poll is closed , see results [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/230e5g/yesterdays_poll_results_what_new_feature_are_you/ ) . 
  `` wardrobe system and dyes '' and `` account-bound wxp , legendaries , and ascended gear '' were very close at wvw category though . 
  i guess the reason why wardrobe won is that many people do wvw with less ( or even 1 ) character so they do n't benefit that much from it . 
  also for example knights or soldiers gear which you can buy in wvw has a very ugly female skin ( i play with it ) so i ca n't wait for wardrobe to come so i can play with some better skins . 
  yeah you 're right , i recalculated it and now it should be right . 
  thanks for remind , 
  also we ca n't be really sure that everyone answered by truth .
