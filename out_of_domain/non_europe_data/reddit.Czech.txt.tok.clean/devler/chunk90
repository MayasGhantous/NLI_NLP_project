  i have a website http://twogentlemen.cz with responsive redwood theme installed . 
  i do n't want the promo boxes ( facebook , instagram , radio - right below the slider ) and some widgets ( instagram , facebook , last articles ) to be seen on small devices ( smartphones ) . 
  how do i manage this ? 
  there is n't an option which would solve this in the theme settings unfortunately . 
  what 's your best roses are red poem ? 
  it 's a pop song . 
  i think the guy had short blond hair and in the one part in the video i think he had a fedora . 
  the song is new , i guess 2015 or 2014 . 
  edit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llklh8cwui4, 
  when i want to post a link to my article on facebook , it always picks a wrong image ( random image from bottom instagram widget i guess ) . 
  how do i set it up so it picks the featured image ? 
  also , the description picks post categories , title , date and the beginning of the article . 
  i 'd much prefer if it only showed the preview of the article .

  now that the secret santa matching is done , some of you ( and maybe majority of you ) are starting to stalk your match , just to get them the best ( and maybe unexpected ) gift . 
  to ease your stalking , i 've came across two online tools which will help you do this job by analysing your match 's reddit activity :,

  try them yourself !, 
  i want to identify this font . 
  it 's based on arial black , but not 100 % it and i ca n't identify what is this font . 
  since i 'm not a photographer , i do n't have the equipment to make my own quality photos , but i 'm eager to improve myself at photo editing . 
  is there a source where i could find zip folders or at least single * unedited * photos of various kinds ( people , skylines , nudes , urban ... ) ? 
  ideally with a license that i could put the edit in my portfolio ? 
  here i am with my most popular offer up to date !, 
  more than 40 redditors already used my services to get a new logo and with some of them i continue working outside of reddit since then !, 
  for ** only $ 10 ** i can design a modern , creative logo for your business , website , project or basically anything !, 
  that 's ** more than 5x times lower than my normal customer prices !, 
  ** get the same quality for less money !, 
  ** from idea to final logo : ** http://i.imgur.com/7hanta9.png, 
  you can check out some of my other previous works i 've done for other fellow redditors here : http://devler.deviantart.com/gallery/53375562/logos, 
  i can also profesionally redesign your old looking logo and make it look more modern !, 
  you can tell me how to redesign the logo ( what you want to enhance , remove , etc. ), 
  so it can suit your needs or i can do it all on my own . 
  i can also design banners , ads , business cards , icons or help you with some smaller photoshop or lightroom tasks ( post processing , cropping , enhancing , vectorising , photo manipulation ... ) , let me know what you need and i 'll tell you the price . 
  i 'm talking about that shiny pastel color design ( usually combined with metals ) from last century which tried to look futuristic, 
  some examples : http://api.ning.com/files/66cxe09ut74*avea4fo5zsshsrzcpipuqwerjb3tzj4by-vugvbuff1zl-9ehnchnb5d*ui9it5nbmm8llffk2zb0gkeus82/amercury010810.jpg, 
  it 's hard to find examples without knowing the name :d,

  hello there !, 
  i felt like this subreddit needs a little more design love than just the default subreddit , so because i should be studying for my finals right now , i decided to make the subreddit 's design a little more 2016 ( procrastination , right ? ) . 
  i 'm taking all the feedback from you guys , i 'd like to make this subreddit theme as pleasing as possible , so any of your rants or suggestions are very welcome . 
  thank you very much . 
  # new features :, 
  along with the new theme , i 'll be adding new features . 
  here is the list of new features that are already live :, 
  ** link flairs ** - i 've added three new link flairs - news , question and translate you can now use them to distinguish your post from the others, 
  ** user flairs ** - you can now get one of three user flairs - one is for czechs , one is for people visiting czech republic and one is for foreigners living here . 
  ** upvote texts ** - this is more like an sweet addition for foreigners rather than a real feature . 
  when you upvote something , there 's a chance it will show some of the phrases or words used by czechs . 
  ** message alert ** - now it 's even easier to notice you have unread messages . 
  a pop up will appear at the bottom left of the page . 
  * if you 'd like any feature to be implemented here on this subreddit , feel free to say so . 
  now , if you really dislike new design , there 's nothing easier than to [ untick `` show this subreddit 's theme '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xczdlyl.jpg ) and the theme will go back to the default one for you .

  hello there ,, 
  guy from / r/czech here . 
  we 'd like one change in the subreddit title :, 
  we 'd like the hover to look like [ this ] ( http://www.czexpo.com/assets/images/partners/czech-republic-land-of-stories.png ) ( just without the `` land of stories '' ) to reflect the czech destination logo , when you hover over the subreddit 's title .

  without colorizing the black photos itself of course . 
  http://imgur.com/a/5akr4 ( especially 7 , 10 and 11 ) , more here https://www.facebook.com/sannadullaway/photos_stream, 
  i love how these have some kind of surreal look . 
  would something like this be easily reproduced with present photos , preferably with 3d lut ? 
  without colorizing the black photos itself of course .
