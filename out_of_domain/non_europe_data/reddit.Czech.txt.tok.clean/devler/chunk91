  hello there !, 
  i accumulated $ 60 worth of credits on gilt , which can be used to cover both goods and $ 7.95 us shipping . 
  however , it does not apply to duties and taxes which i 'd have to pay if i wanted to ship something to czech republic . 
  so i 'd like to make you an offer . 
  you will send me $ 20 to my paypal and i 'll give you access to my gilt account , where you will have $ 60 to spend . 
  you will actually profit $ 40 from this . 
  with promo code extra15 you can get extra 15 % discount .

  here i am with my most popular offer up to date !, 
  more than 50 redditors already used my services to get a new logo and with some of them i continue working outside of reddit since then !, 
  for ** only $ 15 ** i can design a modern , creative logo for your business , website , project or basically anything !, 
  that 's ** more than 5x times lower than my normal customer prices !, 
  ** get the same quality for less money !, 
  ** from idea to final logo : ** http://imgur.com/a/rwpgx, 
  ** my portfolio : ** you can check out some of my other previous works i 've done for other fellow redditors here : https://www.behance.net/adamsafranek, 
  i can also profesionally redesign your old looking logo and make it look more modern !, 
  you can tell me how to redesign the logo ( what you want to enhance , remove , etc. ), 
  so it can suit your needs or i can do it all on my own . 
  i can also design banners , ads , business cards , icons or help you with some smaller photoshop or lightroom tasks ( post processing , cropping , enhancing , vectorising , photo manipulation ... ) , let me know what you need and i 'll tell you the price . 
  i 'm sure many of you have seen this amazing logo `` kiski '', 
  i know that it 's not a font , but i 'm looking for something similar , something as bold as this font with no luck . 
  any help ? 
  hello there ,, 
  i 've recently put 3 adsense ads on my blog and it started to make couple of bucks every day . 
  the thing is , i have a tough competition and i 'm worried , that people from the competition will go to my blog and start intentionally clicking my ads - resulting my adsense account getting banned for invalid clicks - which would be their goal . 
  how would i deal with a situation like this ? 
  how come your flight tickets are so cheap ? 
  or are czech tickets extremely overpriced ?

  hi there ,, 
  this community was really nice to me when i asked for a favor , so i 'd love to give something back . 
  i 'm offering to buy you anything from gilt.com in total worth of $ 50 . 
  you can choose whatever you want and it can be multiple things . 
  i 'll cover it for you , including the shipping . 
  i can give this to anyone , even though i 'd prefer to give it to someone in need , of course , 
  hi there , i have a slight problem with optimizing my website ( http://twogentlemen.cz ) for pagespeed insights . 
  since i 'm using analytics and possibly adsense , i need to have cookie consent on my website . 
  and it 's supposed to be on top of the page and it should scroll up and down with you until you close it . 
  the thing is , google is showing me `` remove render-blocking javascript '' for the cookie consent , resulting in getting less points in insight . 
  is there a solution to this problem ? 
  hello there , i 'd love to right allign read time on the same line as post date . 
  but it keeps showing up one line below . 
  why is that ? 
  i 'm not really any good at coding . 
  i do n't have the time to install the insider updates when i 'm at home because i need to use the computer . 
  is there a way to make the computer shutdown after the upgrade has been installed ? 
  `` update and shutdown '' does n't do the trick . 
  so , i 've been using duolingo for a couple weeks now and i just found that duolingo supports android wear . 
  however , the app does n't show up in the drawer on my huawei watch . 
  anyone experiencing the same issue ? 
  i have an extremely important meeting next week and i want to give the best possible impression appearance-wise . 
  i know the basics of dress code and stuff , i 'll wear semiformal clothes . 
  i 'd like to know if you got any tips on how i could improve my visage . 
  the little things that can improve your appearance but most of the people forget them ( like trimming your nose hair , unibrow , cutting nails and stuff ) . 
  do you know anything ? 
  there 's no direct support from nike + running to android wear , but since nike + has a google fit support , i 've figured out i will record my run to fit and then somehow import it to nike + . 
  but from what i 've seen , i can only add the run manually by imputing the numbers . 
  that of course does n't involve any gps data or calories count . 
  is there any way i can get my recorded run on google fit to my nike + account ? 
  here is the test : http://imgur.com/a/qycgq, 
  compare these 2 runs , 10 days difference , same route , same time of the day . 
  i 've not used heart sensor for the first run , but i 've used it for the second one ( 83 bmp average , 143 bmp maximum ) . 
  is that why the calories burn calculation is so different ? 
  i 've heard that average calories burn is about 100/mile . 
  i 'm getting about 40 calories burn in a mile , which seems very low . 
  the route is n't straight either , there 's about 70 metres ( 224 feet ) altitude difference . 
  i know the first run is a few minutes longer and i 'm running slower , but is this the main factor for 3 times bigger calories burnt ? 
  i 'd like to hear some thoughts and opinions . 
  not individual ones , but some nation-wide opinions . 
  i noticed my calories count being very low last run . 
  so i went to / r/running and asked them for advice . 
  they said that my average hr is way off standards and there 's no way i could have 83 average hr when running ( that 's basically normal resting rate ) . 
  i 'm using endomondo to track my runs .

  anyone has a similar isssue ? 
  any solutions ? 
  i own huawei watch for a couple of months and i 'm very happy with it . 
  today i 've also tried moto 360 ( 1st gen ) . 
  even though the moto 360 is much cheaper and older watch , it has some pros over the huawei watch . 
  the biggest issue i have with huawei watch now is that the screen feels very yellow compared to moto 360 . 
  the blacks are rather gray and overally the colors are much warmer . 
  is there any calibration app which would allow me to make the colors on huawei watch colder ?

  i have an old ati radeon hd 5770 ( 1 gb gddr5 ) in my dell studio xps 7100 . 
  i 'm on a budget , but i 'd like to replace it with something better . 
  i was thinking about zotac geforce gtx750 ti 2gb ddr5 but i have no idea if it will my system well or at all . 
  if not , is there anything similar in price that performs good enough ?
