  they want their domain to be their logo . 
  how do you deal with generic and long names like this ? 
  there 's little to no space to be creative with the text itself ( more like fit it in the smallest space possible ) , so i guess it leaves me to create a really fitting icon right ?

  it 's some jazz/blues song , sang by a man . 
  sinatra , there 's a phrase something like `` like a million ( billion ) dollar * girl ... '' ? 
  when i open the app without a wifi connection ( with mobile data on and working ) , it gets stuck on around 20 % on the loading screen and does n't budge . 
  the app works when i open it with a wi-fi connection and then leave wi-fi range after it has passed the loading screen . 
  however , the app will not pass the loading screen without wifi . 
  i 'm on 4g lte and i have n't reached the data limit . 
  i can load whatever i can in matter of seconds , but not pgo . 
  any ideas how to solve this problem ? 
  i 'm thinking of something like this : http://imgur.com/a/1d1vi, 
  i need to have a certain background/foreground color combos saved , swatches do n't really do the job for me . 
  is there a plugin of some sort or a way to have it like this ?

  huawei sent me a brand new p9 so i could make a few shots , here 's how it turned out :, 
  [ removed ], 
  kids will look at the problem and see the solution right away , an educated person thinks the problem is much more complex than it really is and ca n't solve it because of that . 
  look at the top menu , the spaces between each category are way too big and i 'd like to reduce each by about 25 % . 
  how would i go about that ? 
  thank you in advance !, 
  afaik , france is in the state of emergency .
