  so it can suit your needs or i can do it all on my own . 
  i can also design banners , ads , business cards , icons or help you with some smaller photoshop or lightroom tasks ( post processing , cropping , enhancing , vectorizing , photo manipulation ... ) , let me know what you need and i 'll tell you the price . 
  i need some pandora charms , preferable silver . 
  the ones with `` pandora '' text would be the best . 
  anyone know about some good reps ? 
  do you think they are safe ? 
  i know that there are thousands of positive reviews , but i 'm kinda hesitant because , well , it 's aliexpress . 
  they 're half the price for how much i could get them where i live . 
  should i get them ? 
  staying in paris from saturday , i want to get most of the trip . 
  are there any pfw events free of charge ? 
  hello there , i 'd like to put a new cpu in my old desktop . 
  my current build is :, 
  * dell studio xps 7100 ( dell ff3fn motherboard ), 
  * amd phenom ii x6 1035t, 
  * 6gb ddr3 sdram, 
  * gigabyte gtx 950 windforce oc 2gb, 
  i 'm on a budget , so the new cpu i 've chosen is ** amd fx-8320e ** which is for $ 150 . 
  as i understand , this cpu is am3 + based , while i 'm on a am3 motherboard . 
  which means i should get a new motherboard too . 
  i was thinking to get ** msi 970 gaming **, 
  for $ 100 . 
  are those compataible with my current build ? 
  are those good choices ? 
  thank you very much in advance . 
  or how about ** intel core i3-4130t ** ? 
  what compataible motherboard would you recommend ? 
  today , some of the images on web are loading incorrectly . 
  thanks to the fact that this happens on multiple browsers and very irregulary ( sometimes the image is fine , sometimes it is n't ) does not help me identify where the problem is . 
  i 've tried restarting , checking for gpu updates but nothing worked . 
  i have no idea what might be causing this , i have n't installed anything lately . 
  this is how it looks like . 
  the distortion tends to change and usually does n't affect whole image , only the lower parts . 
  note that the image on the right is still not how the image should look like . 
  it has artifacts which should n't be there and sometimes they are not present .

  ** subreddit name : ** / r/czech, 
  ** number of subscribers : ** 3,222, 
  ** moderator : ** yes, 
  i thought it would be a good idea to stylize the ad as a postcard , since the czech republic is such a famous tourist place . 
  added a little pun to put a smile on yo face !, 
  ** why we should be chosen : **, 
  to my surprise , i just found out that / r/czech is one of the smallest subreddits in the region . 
  our neighbour countries have much higher subscription count , even though the population is the same . 
  for a long time , / r/czech was n't much appealing subreddit . 
  it had the default theme , lacked any sort of post categories and overally , to some readers , it might looked a little bland . 
  ( props to the mods for creating it and moderating it though , in this respect , they were doing a really good job ) . 
  even i was n't really interested in / r/czech when i started redditting a few years ago . 
  but since i was chosen to be the mod of / r/czech , i 'm trying to improve our subreddit in whichever way i can . 
  i 'm sure there are many people around reddit who either are czech or are just interested in our country , travelling here or even living and working here . 
  but they do n't know our subreddit even exists , which is why we 'd love to get some love . 
  in our subreddit , we help people translate what they ca n't , we help people make their travel plans and suggest the sights they should visit , we help our own citizen with their problems and we guide people who want to work in our country . 
  for our counts , we are a pretty active subreddit and be sure that no question/thread stays unanswered !, 
  is there a software to create patterns easily ? 
  i 'm talking about patterns like this : http://www.elizabetholwen.com/, 
  i really like http://envisualizer.formica.com or https://patterninja.com/ or http://bgpatterns.com/ , but i think i need a more complex tool . 
  i see how illustrator could be used for this task , but i 'd rather prefer a software more oriented towards patterns .
