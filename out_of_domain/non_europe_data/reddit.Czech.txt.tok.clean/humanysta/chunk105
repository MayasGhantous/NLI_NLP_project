  what do you mean ` filling up the bottle with correct pills ' ? 
  they do n't give you the original bottle with the pills in the us ? 
  it 's his choice . 
  nobody can force him to live . 
  that is cruel . 
  they only fake being happy because they do n't want to be locked up . 
  they were forced to live . 
  it does n't matter in what state their mind is . 
  forcing them to live is insanity . 
  they do n't have the right to force me to live . 
  i * am * compassionate by letting anyone choose whether they live or die . 
  that is a choice anyone should be free to make without any intervention by others . 
  nothing wrong with it . 
  only selfish people think like you . 
  you can not claim someone 's life . 
  spoken like an ignorant person who thinks they can see in my head . 
  i should have made it clear . 
  without any repercussions * from other people * . 
  no , anybody should have a right to die . 
  there is * nothing * wrong with killing yourself . 
  it is as natural as an act can be . 
  it 's the definition of freedom . 
  just repeating phrases like everyone else . 
  because something bad just had to happen to me right ? 
  it ca n't be the simple fact that life is worthless , oh no . 
  there * must be something more * . 
  must.analyze.and.force.to.live . 
  go away you miserable prick . 
  another triggered baby . 
  they * do * want to die , it 's just that the survivors are brainwashed and threatened to say that . 
  but . . but . . they said nobody judges you , it 's all in your mind !!!, 
  no , i am right . 
  and people like you are a threat to humanity . 
  i will tell you what spotify told me when i asked them about a feature they were missing : `` you are in a minority and we do n't care about you . '', 
  i do n't have a source but there have been articles here and on / r/apple confirming this . 
  you can always google `` apple music library limit '' and it will surely find something . 
  yep , that 's why i left them for google music . 
  but it turned out google does n't even bother to respond !, 
  so i 'm here . 
  it really does n't . 
  i never said that you psycho . 
  but we ca n't force everyone . 
  it should be their choice . 
  not ours . 
  only theirs . 
  well it 's thanks to all those accepting brits . 
  lol, 
  you are one of the most delusional weirdos i have ever known . 
  your morality is corrupt . 
  letting suicidal people have their free will is the lesser evil . 
  you seem to know a lot of people who killed themselves . 
  maybe the problem is you ? 
  have you ever thought about that ? 
  do these cars come with a bucket ? 
  life is not precious . 
  it 's something everyone should have complete control over . 
  period . 
  spoken like a true heartless bitch . 
  because it is the truth . 
  it 's the core of basic of human rights . 
  having complete control over your own life . 
  oh , so your aunt is you neighbour ? 
  fucking ridiculous . 
  you do n't even know what you 're saying . 
  ** leave suicidal people alone ** . 
  they are n't hurting you but ** you are hurting them ** . 
   if he would have been in a better state of mind he would have thought beyond that moment of hurt, 
  this is a lie and you know that . 
  he made a decision and you 're making a psycho out of him ? 
  that is fucking pathetic . 
  he made a decision like a rational and free human being . 
  he has a right to control his life as he pleases . 
  `` druggies '' ? 
  i see , * i * am the asshole . 
  and no , suicidal people are not hurting themselves , they are liberating themselves from pain . 
  no , i 'm the sane person here . 
  basic human rights are a priority to me . 
  yeah ? 
  you did n't see in his head . 
  if you did you would probably have him locked up in some institution by now , making him even more miserable . 
  we can only dream . 
  you do n't have to accept anything , this is purely based on opinion . 
  he was human and he had a right to do it . 
  i do n't need to know more . 
  he 's at peace now . 
  probably been miserable for years and now he 's finally alright . 
  he got better . 
  that 's a good thing . 
  of course they do n't matter when you 're dead , but ** you 're making that decision when you 're alive ** . 
  that 's why it matters to have a freedom to choose or refuse life . 
   nobody is stopping anybody, 
  that is not true . 
  there is a whole industry of people determined to force you to live . 
  i can guarantee you that if you try to kill yourself and somebody accidentally sees you you 're fucked because they 're going to treat you like a mentally ill person , no matter if you truly are or not . 
   if you want to kill yourself , you have to be mentally ill to some degree, 
  no , this is not true . 
  you are just proving yourself to be ignorant and pretending to know something when in reality you know nothing . 
  a decision one makes to kill themselves is perfectly rational and the only reason why today 's society views it negatively is because ** you are useless to the government when you 're dead ** . 
  that 's why they unleash the psychologists on you - so they are able to profit from your suffering . 
  i just addressed a major point from your comment .
