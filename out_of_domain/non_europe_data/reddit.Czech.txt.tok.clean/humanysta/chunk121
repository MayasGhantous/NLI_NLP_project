   do you feel this way because you find yourself unattractive ? 
  yep . 
  and i know that i should n't , as you say it , put attractive people on a pedestal , but unfortunately reason does n't control emotions . 
  and this is all about emotions overriding reason . 
  that sounds pretty intimidating . 
  i never had a job so i do n't even know what it 's like to deal with people like that but it sounds difficult . 
  a psychologist told me something similar but it 's hard to fight emotions with reason . 
  this picture does n't have his face or body ... wtf ? 
  computer . 
  that just does n't look like his face at all . 
  maybe just a weird angle . 
  yep , i just found a website of other photos of the guy . 
  yep , definitely one of the reasons . 
  i 'd say that extra cost might be reliability , do n't you think ? 
  the brands often mentioned on reddit are n't sold in my country . 
  i have z1c so quick charge is n't necessary . 
  it 's a ddl website . 
  i do n't even understand why the law tolerates drug use in public . 
  damn , that must suck . 
  you would hate going to my school . 
  i literally ca n't avoid some second hand smoke every day because the school entrance is surrounded by smokers . 
  i live in a small town in czech republic . 
  the only gay guy here i know of is a pedophile . 
  which size would you recommend ? 
  i have a z1c with some 2300mah for full charge . 
  ugh , this post sounds like a [ post-purchase rationalization ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post-purchase_rationalization ) . 
  see , this is where my laziness comes into play . 
  i do n't want to search manually for music and it 's guaranteed i wo n't find 20 % of my music there . 
  that sucks . 
  i do n't even know what your point is . 
  apple music has 10mil more songs . 
  you 're not lazy if you manually download music . 
  lol, 
  this simplification is wrong . 
  you did n't even read my post . 
  this `` purchase '' quality you speak of is what ? 
  320kbps mp3s/256kbps m4as ? 
  flac ? 
  what are you babbling about ? 
  none of that implies that my options are limited to `` purchase '' vs youtube quality . 
  i just said that i ca n't tell the difference between high quality and the rerecorded audio . 
  i mentioned youtube as it 's often mentioned as having inferior quality . 
  i could have just said 192kbps or less . 
  but i did n't and rustled your jimmies . 
  you think mods care about a fucking piracy sub ? 
  are you kidding me ? 
  they 're probably looking for a reason to ban this place . 
  * triggered *, 
  well leak them or shut the fuck up . 
  oh yes , i need something to replace the straight cancer of / r/all . 
  during the week in the dorm , weekend at home where i share a room with my brother . 
  i wish i sounded like that . 
  i actually had to start using res for filtering because the reddit filter has a limit . 
  filtering all the political subs i disagree with , sport subs and others filled it quickly when combined with straight porn . 
  yep , it 's really convenient . 
  too bad i have to filter all those subreddits again in my phone client . 
  oh god he 's just so perfect . 
  i write `` i see two idiots endangering others '' but all you can see is '' * *** *** ****** *********** ****** '' . 
  oh my god , this subreddit has a moderator ??? 
  funny how the passing lane is cleaner . 
  well you should n't drive that fast anyway , i think i read somewhere that crossing a certain speed you 're taking responsibility on yourself on the autobahn . 
  you ca n't drive as fast as you want on the autobahn without consequences . 
  everybody here in the czech republic dreads polish drivers . 
  i see nobody else mention it yet so i 'll go ahead and say it - the original is * so much better * . 
  the racists in the comments . 
  you probably do n't come from / r/the _ trumpets because that was the first thing they thought of . 
  immigrant issues ? 
  lol, 
  yeah , let 's shit on people trying to make a change . 
  i really like this . 
  there is nothing more pretentious than throwing around a suicide hotline number . 
  you did n't but that 's ok . 
  we should make a megathread for people like op to complain about the sub . 
  what i ca n't stand is when people listen to anything but one or two genres . 
  that 's as close minded as you can get . 
  i 've been driving a manual car for almost 4 years now and i still ca n't drive it properly . 
  for me it 's an unnecessary complication . 
  i grew up listening to it , being the only person i knew of who did n't hate the genre . 
  still surrounded by similar people , still loving it . 
  ah , i see you did this instead of another `` stop posting stuff i do n't like '' post but with the same intentions . 
  very . 
  i also hate political debates on tv , i always have to leave the room . 
  i do n't understand why you have the need to shit on her like that ? 
  what is your problem ? 
  why is everyone on reddit laughing at her like it 's the right thing to do ? 
  their android team could wake up from the coma they 've been in since 20.10 . 
  czech news sites actually report this as `` trump knows more about the hacking '' ... 
   listen to anything but one or two genres, 
  yes , that 's exactly what i 'm saying . 
  i 'll see , i 'm halfway through the first episode and so far he just talks about how everyone but him is sickening . 
  i 'm surrounded by people who react almost aggressively towards certain genres of music and i 'm sick of it . 
  they may be different things but they go hand in hand . 
  not always true , but often enough to see the correlation . 
  people will make incorrect conclusions from this event . 
  i finished the first episode and honestly even though this seems to be a great series the main character would be ruining it for me . 
  he 's like a perfect example of a self-righteous neckbeard redditor who thinks he knows what 's best for everyone . 
  i honestly do n't understand how this show is not hated by being so stereotypically neckbeard-ish . 
  she definitely is n't . 
   as far as i know, 
  exactly .
