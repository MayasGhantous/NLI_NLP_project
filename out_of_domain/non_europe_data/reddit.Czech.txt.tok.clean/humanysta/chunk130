  i like it . 
  i do n't . 
  none . 
  i hate working . 
  so he 's a rapist . 
  i guess that should n't be news but still ... 
  you 're being dismissive of other people 's feelings because you do n't understand them . 
  you belittle them and make light of their issues . 
  goddammit , people like you are the worst . 
  `` why do n't you just change so you 're normal according to my standards ? '', 
  for some of us it is n't possible . 
  we struggle with this every day and it makes our lives living hell . 
  the nazis running ~ ~ ukraine ~ ~ russia are at it again . 
  i 'm surprised but i like it . 
   if a country says watching cartoons makes you a pedophile , then you must be one . 
  * a lot of these are taken from this subreddit or wallhaven but i also sometimes google randomly to find new images . 
  * some images may appear twice with different resolution . 
  that is because i edit them in photoshop to properly fit on a 1920x1080 screen if they do n't fit automatically . 
  choose the version you want . 
  * i have them sorted by category but they are kinda arbitrary so it would n't make sense to all , plus it 's always more fun to go through random wallpapers . 
  * some of these were n't meant as wallpapers but as screensavers or lockscreens but feel free to use them however you see fit . 
  * if you have windows 10 and a visible taskbar , some wallpapers are better edited with a strip at the bottom so that the image actually appears above it and not under it . 
  i chose not to upload them but i can if someone wants them . 
  thanks !, 
  apple music . 
  ravioli ravioli give me the formuoli . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  it 's always great to have some original content .

  an actual person with social anxiety .

  you only do this if you want to damage the book . 
  exactly , no need to damage the book . 
  or crj . 
  honestly , i do n't care at all if any musician writes their own lyrics or not . 
  well , considering the fact that making and posting this video on the internet is already very disrespectful towards the parents of the girl ... 
  what game is it ? 
  i have a framed picture of pregnant kim kardashian on my table . 
  fight me . 
  i wish she added more . 
  i love her and her stances . 
  oh god , another one who uses sjw unironically . 
  hey , do n't worry , you 're not alone . 
  i absolutely agree !, 
  i actually made the same post few days before you on a different sub and got the same response . 
  pray for her babies to be as fabulous as her and her husband . 
  the true unpopular opinion is usually the one with most downvotes . 
  do you ever browse `` unpopular '' threads in askreddit ? 
  the real answers are always at the top when you sort by controversial . 
  school canteens . 
  i always dread it will happen to me . 
  or they grew up in a different country where nobody fucking eats that shit . 
  i could n't get over the camera work . 
  i had trouble focusing on the movie because the camera was shaking so violently . 
  but it often does make the movie unenjoyable . 
  that 's the reason why i could n't even finish falling down . 
  i went through their list of artists and there were quite a lot of really good ones . 
  i wish i could play that on pc .

  ftfy, 
  how did you manage to disable it ? 
  i have an acer aspire v nitro and ca n't get rid of it for good . 
  usually changing some registry settings helps but windows always downloads some update that fucks it up . 
  still have that problem ? 
  i had a similar problem with my acer laptop and [ this ] ( http://solverbase.com/w/windows_10:_adaptive_brightness_-_turn_on_or_off ) solved it . 
  restart after that and it should be fine . 
  had the same problem , [ this ] ( http://solverbase.com/w/windows_10:_adaptive_brightness_-_turn_on_or_off ) was the solution .

  paint it pink . 
  not in politics, 
  i wish my high school teachers did n't share their political beliefs . 
  they still do . 
  the only people not using common sense are the ones spreading the myth of political correctness . 
  does it matter though ? 
  you 're just damaging your skin either way . 
  good username btw, 
  it looks like they just braked with no regard to the cammer , not intentionally brake checked him, 
  yeah , some of us just feel entitled to free stuff because that 's what we kept getting from the internet our whole lives . 
   especially for the digital copy where all what you get is a code to play the game ( at least in old time you had a cd/manual and cover, 
  i think this is completely irrelevant . 
  to many people there was no added value here , it was just clutter taking up space . 
  i remember installing steam because of half life 2 .
