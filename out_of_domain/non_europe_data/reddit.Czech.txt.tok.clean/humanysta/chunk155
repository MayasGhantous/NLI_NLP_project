  i discovered this album recently , it 's so soothing . 
  i love how there are so many full albums like this on youtube . 
  otherwise , i would 've never heard them . 
  [ how about this ? 
  thanks , that 's so much better . 
  why would you not want to see gay porn ? 
  quality s u c c, 
  while you 're babbling nonsense the cock is getting cold, 
  / r/trashy, 
  i can safely say this is the second best song named what about us . 
  they never said that . 
  you never even considered the comment was about the chance of making music with them and not popularity ? 
  yeah , they never said she ca n't . 
  well she was in his way, 
  looks like mark harmon from ncis . 
  by ` her loss ' they meant she had a chance to make music with them but refused . 
  that 's the context . 
  / u/blasifeelsswift likes major lazer so when rihanna passed on the chance to collab with them he sees it as her loss . 
  he never implied that it would 've helped her career . 
  they made the important features free last year . 
  this is literally the only situation when a comment like this has been upvoted on this sub . 
  i 'm actually running rooted stock lollipop on my z1c . 
  i do have twrp and xposed . 
  i do n't really flash new roms anymore but sometimes some xposed module fucks up or something like that and i have to reflash the stock firmware . 
  the reason why i 'm a bit scared to use 2fa is because i turned it on for my bank account some time ago and then reflashed . 
  had to call to the bank to disable it . 
  i heard authy has some backup options but i 'm not sure how that works . 
  i do n't know if i could trust a nandroid backup though , never tried it . 
  glasses ? 
  people with a sense of humor . 
  he 's not wrong . 
  in my part it would be 1 000, 
  that 's just you . 
  he is yet to slay the mad king . 
  it gets better ^ ^ ^ ^ sometimes ^ ^ maybe, 
  lol people do n't illegally download games because the devs deserve it , they download it because it 's cheaper and more convenient, 
  if you buy this game you 're adding to the circlejerk and you 're an idiot . 
  i do n't understand how can so many people use the terrible official app . 
  if it was a vote about the cutest character i would 've voted for him . 
  / r/gatekeeping, 
  / r/unhelpfulcomments, 
  this sub sucks so bad . 
  it 's impossible to find new exciting music here . 
  this sub is like a gas chamber . 
  except it does n't gas you with cyclone b but overplayed music . 
  that wolf is baked . 
  and the conclusion will be there is no proof . 
  i want games with men in suggestive poses god damn it . 
  just do n't use your phone while driving . 
  or use desktop like a normal person . 
  well if my gtx 860m also still receives updates ... 
  was it firefox only ? 
  i had something similar happening in all browsers . 
  most people do n't care . 
  there are so many inappropriate pics posted here every day ... 
  thank god, 
  yeah , i do n't have a problem with that . 
  everyone should do whatever makes them happy . 
  the only good thing about the portal games is the story . 
  i hate being exposed to drunk people but being drunk feels good . 
  * getting * drunk is fucking awful . 
  i absolutely agree !, 
  relapse is by far my most listened to album by eminem and i 'm a huge fan . 
  it 's so casual you can literally listen to it anytime . 
  it makes me so disappointed that he has such a terrible flow now . 
  quality of music is determined by the listener , not anyone else . 
  if you like something there is no need to ` defend it ' . 
  recovery was a disappointment the first time i heard it . 
  it took me years to warm up to it . 
  mmlp2 still sounds mostly bad . 
  anyone using sjw as an actual slur is an idiot so do n't mind them . 
  your attitude makes it impossible to disagree with actual racist , sexist , xenophobic , homophobic , transphobic beliefs because you basically say that if you disagree with someone and mention one of these reasons you are automatically wrong . 
  itt : angry introverts . 
  some of you are just assholes who get mad at people with questions . 
  how do * you * survive with such an attitude ? 
  i would never ask question on this subreddit because i know i 'd only get asshole answers like this . 
  have unprotected sex . 
  get hiv and a kid . 
  but at least he tried !!, 
  literally no one asks that . 
  stop overreacting to people asking questions . 
  xxx [ insertajoke ] ion, 
  none lol, 
  i listen to hip hop because it 's a genre of confidence , which i lack, 
  i got back to relapse again . 
  it 's such a good , casual listen . 
  yeah , i know people reveal their real personalities online, 
  ah , my favorite ` if i mark my opinion as sarcasm you ca n't tell my i 'm wrong ' strikes again . 
  no kid , sarcasm is n't a shortcut to ' i did n't mean it ' . 
  i found that faking it does n't work for me because people are so used to me being shy they immediately point out that i 'm acting different than normal which makes me even more shy . 
  working out itself requires confidence so no i do n't . 
  i think about it everyday but it 's really hard to overcome . 
  you absolutely need confidence and if you think you do n't you already have it .
