  yep . 
  my teacher used to say ` nobody is rich enough to buy cheap things . ', 
  [ countries in which english is the first language of the majority of the population . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english-speaking_world#/media/file:anglospeak.svg ), 
  man you have a really distorted view of what anxious people go through . 
  you have to talk to the staff to pay so they let you inside . 
  you have to communicate with people already occupying machines . 
  also it 's not just about communication , it 's about how people around you make you feel . 
  anxiety gets worse the more people there are in the room and based on their behavior . 
  laughing people make me anxious - are they laughing at me ? 
  angry people make me anxious - what if they get angry at me ? 
  people staring at make me anxious . 
  i shake and sweat just walking down the street . 
  you do not have anxiety . 
   honestly if its that bad that you ca n't talk to anybody , i have no clue how you function in daily life, 
  because going to the municipal office , making an appointment or doing any official business takes part in a professional environment with people i expect to be professional . 
  i do n't have any bad experiences with people in these situations but i have plenty with those in casual environments . 
  i easily ` function ' in a society without going to the gym , music festivals , shopping centers , etc. 
  but that does n't mean i 'm happy . 
  yeah i do this . 
  not proud of it but it happens . 
  it 's weird how ` talking about a friend ' easily changes to ` talking shit about them ' . 
  has it always been like this ? 
  that sounds like a great service . 
  how do you guys feel about the ending of ali bomaye ? 
  i had to edit the song and remove it because it 's so obnoxious and ruins a good playlist . 
  i might do that when i live on my own . 
  there 's nothing wrong with draft dodging . 
  brosnan was the best bond . 
  haha [ description of a situation from the video ], 
  this reeks of / r/lewronggeneration and / r/im14andthisisdeep, 
  damn already taken down, 
  i 'm just like op and it makes me happy someone actually feels the same way i do . 
  this implies op does n't love himself :(, 
  if it 's the leaked version i 'm happy . 
  why not hoe, 
  i have a question - when you match with someone , how often is it you who writes first ? 
  it 's on f-droid and it 's system-wide . 
  requires root . 
  who 's that ? 
  it 's a google earth screenshot . 
  yep , except it does n't recognize the name when i type it . 
  i already tried that . 
  in my own experience , i had more problems with adblocking in firefox . 
  mostly obscure local websites . 
  his real name is god himself . 
  eminem : rap like a robot, 
  my hope for a good album is really fading . 
  the idea was to slap the sticker on a cropped picture . 
  there 's nothing more to be done . 
  really nice !, 
  that 's why it would be an option in the settings . 
  it does n't seem to confuse reddit is fun users , it 's on by default . 
  i hate living with people like you . 
  people on / r/shoplifting say otherwise, 
  i had to do it in / r/popheads . 
  the image flairs are so huge and obnoxious it completely ruins the whole page . 
  i used to think this was illegal when i was a kid so i would always buy something . 
  i think it all depends on the zoo . 
  the one i visit seems to treat animals well , they have enough space , etc. 
  mentally still in mongolia though . 
  aaaaand the kids now have nowhere to jack off in peace . 
  so i can use the free 50k tier on both accounts simultaneously ? 
  just switch the account like i do with gmail and stream away ? 
  i kinda wish i could get back to firefox from chrome but being on the google 's leash is so damn convenient . 
  have you seen the picture of a group of people being run over by a nazi ? 
  are you richard spencer ? 
  well , now that i think about it , i guess there is n't much anymore . 
  firefox does have syncing and an android app . 
  i would probably miss some extensions , remote desktop , being able to sign in to my chrome account at school computers ( most of them do n't have firefox ) ... plus i already use so many google services ( photos , music , play , gmail , drive ) so why not one more ? 
  i have one google account that i use to sign into all those services , chrome itself , my phone ... 
  build 15063 , education edition . 
  i do n't use edge that often because of this . 
  at first start there always seems to be a short period when it is unresponsive but i thought that was something that just happens with uwp apps . 
  might be just my laptop though . 
  it 's still good for gaming but maybe it 's not powerful enough to handle a modern system . 
  i do n't get what they want from me . 
  since i know i 'm playing a game that wants to teach me about trust i 'm always going to click cooperate . 
  i do n't get it . 
  i guess it 's because i 'm czech , when you let google translate pronounce it [ with the czech voice ] ( https://translate.google.cz/#cs/en/azor%20ahai ) that 's how i pronounce it . 
  then switch to english and it 's like they say it on the show . 
  thanks . 
  for such a huge collection i truly have no idea . 
  maybe try [ pornganizer ] ( https://pornganizer.org/ ) ? 
  but it 's paid now . 
  i recently cleaned up my collection to stuff i actually do jerk off to and that reduced it to 130gb ( used to be 500gb ) . 
  now i just manually tag everything perfectly in a locked plex server and could n't be happier . 
  ethnicity is my guess . 
  i love sucking cock , bring it on . 
  * shattered *, 
  if you do n't use the upload option go ahead . 
  i use it .
