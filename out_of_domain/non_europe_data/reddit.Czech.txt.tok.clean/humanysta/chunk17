  people do n't like devil ? 
  i really liked that film . 
  some people just do n't feel the vibrations . 
  if the phone is in my pocket , i usually do n't feel it vibrating and when i 'm in public , somewhere loud and while moving there 's no way i 'm feeling it . 
  good . 
  spotify needs better competition asap . 
  if you have a mac , try [ this ] ( http://spotify-notifications.citruspi.io/ ) . 
  if you 're on windows , try [ this one ] ( https://code.google.com/p/spotifynotifier/ ) . 
  i do n't know if it can help but i would try messing with the settings , specifically gapless playback , crossfade tracks and hardware acceleration . 
  maybe some combination of these three might solve the problem . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.egmolio.net/spotify/spotifynew.php ) , [ this ] ( http://www.spotifynewmusic.com/ ) and [ this ] ( http://app.swarm.fm/#/releases/latest ) . 
  especially the first one seems to be the most accurate . 
  have you tried recovering the playlist [ here ] ( https://www.spotify.com/account/recover-playlists/ ) ? 
  right now it shows me some error , but who knows why . 
  did n't you make the playlist collaborative on accident ? 
  then anyone would be able to delete the songs . 
  works for me with firefox and chrome on windows . 
  it 's nice and works good . 
  i would still appreciate if it only put new songs into the playlist . 
  i used to have a similar problem , but it just kinda disappeared by itself . 
  you can always reinstall the client and of that does n't help , i do n't know . 
  i changed laptops and systems since i last encountered this bug so unfortunately i do n't know how to help . 
  hm , it seems that it 's happening to me too , but i usually just let the music play so it 's not that recognizable . 
  i do n't notice it at all usually . 
  dude you 're hoooot !, 
  sorry i forgot :d i 'd say 8/10 . 
  well i do n't know about others who were raised in households indiferent towards religion , but for me these holidays were never about religion . 
  christmas meant ( and still means to me ) snow , decorations , tree in the living room , cookies on the table , carols and presents . 
  easter is all about [ our czech traditions ] ( http://www.myczechrepublic.com/czech_culture/czech_holidays/easter/ ) . 
  it took me a long time to notice that these holidays had something to do with religion for some people . 
  they just do n't for me . 
  if it is i wish him ( her ) luck , i ca n't imagine going through this with kardashians and a tv crew constantly around me . 
  well , the downvotes just prove your point . 
  i do n't recommend going to / r/tumblrinaction , it 's just full of extreme response to extremes . 
  it 's not a real representation of people opposing exaggerated political correctness nor tumblr itself . 
  huh , i 'm still confused if it 's supposed to be mocking nascar or not . 
  yeah , fuck him for having a favourite band . 
  people who like other music than me suck !, 
  this sounds more like a videogame than real life . 
  it has happened to me before that i followed a playlist in the web player and it has n't appeared on desktop until i restarted it . 
  they probably hear the same level of noise you hear . 
  so basically anything that produces sound of the same volume as fucking and above can be heard . 
  that 's actually better then i expected . 
  you 're very good looking . 
  you kinda look like white kanye , 
  this looks awesome !, 
  that does n't mean it is n't an oxymoron . 
  and daft punk . 
  is it ok to post sites with download links here ? 
  because that 's pretty much my only source for porn . 
  maybe it reminds her of you ? 
  you sound mature . 
  if it 's comfy , then it looks good enough . 
  that would make it the only rule of reddiquette people follow . 
   because he thought i looked like `` them damn polish . '', 
  what does that even mean ? 
  as far as i can tell , polish people look just like any other white people . 
  this thread is really interesting . 
  i have been using handkerchiefs almost exclusively all my life because that 's what my parents and most people i know do . 
  i guess it must be typical for my country then . 
  handkerchiefs are perfectly normal and widely used here . 
  i 'm a student and i go there every day , because it 's easier than storing stuff in a tiny fridge i share with 4 other people . 
  czech republic - [ fried cheese ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/sma%c5%be%c3%a1k,_hranolky_a_tatarka.jpg ) with potatoes or fries . 
  it 's the most delicious thing ever . 
  chris rock . 
  it 's not really about the jokes , but the delivery . 
  i must have done that before because i do n't remember ever having sex . 
  anything war related . 
  every time actually . 
  i do n't get haircuts though , i just have my hair cut shorter . 
  girl talk - feed the animals . 
  crank 2 is way more fun . 
  yes , that might be a better representative , i just really love cheese . 
  how big are weddings usually ? 
  80 people seems like a huge wedding to me . 
  wow . 
  my parents had only two of their closest friends attending and it was just a short , civil wedding . 
  seems so weird in comparison . 
  it does n't . 
  save yourself your precious time and avoid it with great passion . 
  spotify stopped accepting new apps some time ago if i remember correctly . 
  what happened to you now will probably happen to every one of us eventually . 
  sadly , spotify shifts from what made it more interesting than it 's competition . 
  that kinda makes sense , does n't it ? 
  google play all access radios work well but it would cost you extra money . 
  worth it , if you ask me . 
  i subscribe to both and it 's the perfect combo . 
  on spotify i follow tons of playlists and just browse through them to find new music . 
  yes i think you 're right . 
  lets hope for brighter future , shall we ? 
  maybe spotify is n't doomed after all . 
  you should probably mark that as us only since some of these brands are n't international . 
  you 're probably in a country that does n't have it yet . 
  even in my shitty 13th world country it 's available so it 's most definitely just temporary problem for you . 
  he 's not asking for unchallenged respect . 
  which is a shame , because as a person who does n't like manual and lives in europe , this limits my options a lot . 
  exactly . 
  why should i complicate my life just to feel superior ? 
   i know gay people do n't choose to be gay and are born that way . 
  same with straight people .
