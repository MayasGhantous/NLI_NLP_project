  because i do n't socialize outside of school there really is n't any opportunity for me to meet women . 
  well i 'm gay so it does n't bother me that much but i still feel like i 'm missing out on something and that this situation might make me a bit socially retarded . 
  do any of you guys have similar experiences ? 
  i do n't even know what i 'm trying to say here , i guess this realization just made me a bit weirded out by how i take male company for granted and women are like a strange undiscovered element that is not present in my life . 
  preferably some available in europe . 
  i live in the czech republic and tasted some of the beers sold here and mostly could n't stomach them but corona is fine but a bit expensive . 
  for example - i 'm waiting for the movie `` arrival '' which is to be released on bluray on february 14th but because it will most certainly be available sooner a notification on that day would be too late . 
  i usually wait for at least the web-dl quality . 
  so i 've finally reached a point where i 'm pretty sure i 've seen 99 % of all the good horror movies that sound interesting to me so i want to start with books . 
  so far i have n't read many horror books . 
  i really liked ** the terror ** by dan simmons . 
  i remember reading a very scary book about the mothman when i was younger . 
  i would probably enjoy stephen king 's ** the mist ** if i had n't seen the movie yet ( which i love ) . 
  there are also mystery books i really like , like ** metro 2033 ** or ** sphere ** . 
  but since i have n't read many books of the genre i will list some of my favourite movies and hopefully that will give you a hint of what i 'm looking for : blair witch , cloverfield , alien , the thing , the mist , the ruins , the fourth kind ... 
  so , to sum it up , i most enjoy anything that involves aliens , monsters or any other mysterious beings , basically mystery in general . 
  stories about discovering and exploring mysterious places are also fun . 
  i am not a fan of ghosts as i find them too vanilla but books might be different . 
  i absolutely hate comedy horrors . 
  and please , no psychological thrillers . 
  i 've read some stephen king books and although i did enjoy some of them they are not my favourite type of book . 
  i have trouble getting any routine done - washing myself , brushing my teeth , shaving ... unless i know i will have to be around people . 
  so usually it 's fine because i go to school and i only stop over the weekends but when there are extended periods of time i do n't have to leave the house ( like now until february ) i do n't do any of those things . 
  just the thought of doing any of the routines makes me feel frustrated . 
  i loathe these activities but being an oily , smelly blob of human body tissue does n't feel good either . 
  how do i deal with this ? 
  finding a good recommendation site can be a chore . 
  i know because i spent a lot of time trying to find them . 
  and i must say that i probably found all i need . 
  ** [ movielens ] ( https://movielens.org ) ** is in my opinion by far the most complex and useful . 
  it lets you rate movies and then based on your ratings predicts them for other movies . 
  i have rated here almost 500 movies and the predicted ratings are very close to my actual ratings . 
  you can also change the recommendation engines within the site , each will offer a little bit different types of movies . 
  * you can import imdb ratings * . 
  basically , after i wach a movie i go to a local movie database website , imdb and movielens to rate the movie . 
  [ ** tastemonster ** ] ( https://www.tastemonster.com ) is also great but very different . 
  you do n't really rate movies here ( you can but that 's not why i like this site ) but * you are shown individual movies which you can mark as seen , put them on your wishlist or skip them . 
  * that is something i have always been looking for . 
  see , the problem with a lot of recommendation sites is that they will keep offering you certain movies and have no easy way to hide them . 
  this website lets me quickly dismiss those movies so they do n't clutter my recommendations . 
  [ ** cinesift ** ] ( https://www.cinesift.com ) is simple , but some might find it more useful . 
  similar to tastemonster . 
  [ ** taste.io ** ] ( http://www.taste.io/ ) is probably the simplest of them all but i do n't like how it offers certain movies over and over . 
  but still give it a try , it might work for you . 
  i know there are other sites like this but most of them are useless . 
  tastekid gets thrown around pretty often but in my opinion has nothing to offer . 
  it 's unintuitive and their recommendations suck . 
  if you know some other ** good ** recommendation sites ** you use regularly ** please share them with us . 
  i find it nearly impossible to press that combo in time . 
  those i found were very brief or show oriented . 
  i hate this feeling so much it makes me want to cry . 
  how can i make this neverending cycle stop ? 
  i clean my ears using the water force of a detachable shower head . 
  seems it does n't work . 
  ear sprays make it even worse . 
  q-tips make it the worst . 
  i hate this so much . 
  do i really have to go to a doctor every couple of months or is there another way ? 
  i 'm a 21 year old man , the only medication i 'm currently taking are anti-seborrhea shampoo and cream .

  i do n't mind if it still takes the money but i hate how especially now in france you have to stop so often . 
  the only downside for me is the 4:3 resolution . 
  but there are many things the hd versions does wrong like - at hd resolutions everything is too tiny and alt+tab ing does n't work very well . 
  i have an acer aspire v17 nitro ( intel core i7 4710hq , nvidia geforce gtx 860m , 12gb ram , windows 10 ) . 
  i installed [ equalizer apo ] ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/ ) which is an equalizer for windows . 
  i was not happy with it so i uninstalled it . 
  since then my computer always freezes after several minutes of use . 
  no problem in safe mode . 
  i tried reinstalling the audio drivers but it did n't help . 
  interesting thing happened - just before the computer froze i opened the task manager and saw that the hdd was getting hogged by ` windows problem reporting ' . 
  do n't know if that 's relevant . 
  unfortunately i do n't have any restore points . 
  the only thing i have n't tried yet is resetting the system but i want that to be the last option since i would lose all the installed apps . 
  is there anything else i can try ? 
  if yes , is it mandatory ? 
  or is it just a custom ? 
  i live in the czech republic and have the same name as my dad . 
  as far as i know most people in my country who are named after their parents have it the same too . 
  the junior part is just something you mention when you need to differentiate yourself from the parent but you never put it anywhere in writing . 
  the website is www.myepisodes.com . 
  when i try to open it i only see a blank page . 
  opening it through a vpn works . 
  i can access the forum www.myepisodes.com/forum though . 
  i can even log into it but ca n't access the main page , etc. 
  the website is n't down so there seems to be a problem on my side . 
  do you know what i 'm talking about ? 
  i spent the last 7 years learning electrical engineering and it stuff is a big part of it . 
  it always amazes me when people my age ca n't handle their computer . 
  and the thing is , it is n't even about my education . 
  most of my knowledge could be summed up by the ability to google . 
  seriously , if you asked me any computer related questing i probably would n't be able to answer immediately but i know i would be able to find the solution . 
  i can only find 0.5 m and longer . 
  it needs to be male/female because i want to use it as an extension cord for my earbuds . 
  or am i missing something ? 
  is d-fens supposed to be a bad guy who the audience should despise ? 
  the official movie description certainly does n't give me that impression . 
  it seems like people who like d-fens are the same people who misunderstood fight club and think tyler durden is the good guy and a good role model even though he 's the bad guy . 
  [ removed ], 
  either this is a bug on my end or i 'm canceling my subscription . 
  this is the reason why i moved from google music .
