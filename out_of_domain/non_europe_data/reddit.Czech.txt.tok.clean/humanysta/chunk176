  i have to know what music is disappearing from my library . 
  [ this is what it looks like now .

  the last romanceable character i really liked was [ fenris ] ( http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonage/images/f/f7/fenrissmirks2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110321164555 ) in dragon age 2 . 
  then in inquisition , i was pretty disappointed i could n't date [ krem . 
  ] ( http://www.pcgames.de/screenshots/original/2014/12/dragon_age_inquisition_0162-pc-games_b2article_artwork.jpg ), 
  i was also disappointed i could n't date liam in me : andromeda . 
  first he tells you he 's straight and then walks around half naked all the time . 
  i finished andromeda in 56 hours . 
  i think i completed 90 % of the side quests + the main story . 
  and i want to play the game again . 
  that has n't happened to me before . 
  i could n't do it with da : inquisition because the side quests were so tedious , there were a lot of game breaking bugs and parts where i got stuck . 
  playing andromeda i was never frustrated to the point of thinking `` well , i 'm not playing the game again anytime soon because of this part '' . 
  yes , there are things that annoy me but nothing too major . 
  now i 'm ready to play the game again and experience it properly . 
  i seriously rushed the first playthrough . 
  never read any emails , codex entries , datapads , planet descriptions or omnitool info . 
  closing in to the ending i even skipped through most non-cinematic dialogue . 
  but that 's just the way i always play a game with an immersive story for the first time . 
  i 'm driven by the story , mysteries , and resolutions . 
  but i 'm also a semi-completionist , so ignoring side quests feels wrong so i pick them all up and try to accomplish as many of them as possible . 
  also ( please do n't tell on me ) the whole time i was playing the 1.04 version and the only thing i 'm looking for in 1.05 is skipping the space travel . 
  but now i 'm all ready with a passion ^ and ^ a ^ legit ^ copy, 
  i do n't remember it exactly - it 's given by a prisoner on kadara who sends you to his stripper asari girlfriend . 
  i do n't remember what the point of the quest was but i know i was supposed to come back to him . 
  i came to him too late ( after finishing some other quest on kadara ) and the quest was marked as failed . 
  it was also the first time i have encountered an annoying bug because even though the quest failed the mark was still showing on my map but he was n't in that prison anymore so i could n't get rid of it . 
  were there any other failable quest i should look out for on my 2nd playthrough ? 
  i do n't want to fail them by accident . 
  i ca n't bring myself to say `` you 're welcome '' or `` no problem '' ( variations of these in my language ) because any reply like that sounds cocky , overconfident , almost arrogant . 
  irl i usually just nod or something and try to get away but in text conversations , this is really awkward . 
  i do n't want to say anything to avoid sounding arrogant , but no response can make me sound arrogant too !, 
  why does it have to be so difficult ... 
  not only you have to press space once to `` activate skipping mode '' and then press it again to actually skip but it stays on only for a limited amount of time if you do n't press space often enough . 
  it often happens to me that the `` skipping mode '' ends right before i want to skip something again . 
  why make it so tedious ? 
  are they afraid we 're going to accidentally skip what we did n't mean to ? 
  i do n't have that problem in other games . 
  converting it to mono worsens the quality of the sound . 
  is there a way to mix both channels without losing audio quality ? 
  there are many aspects similar to andromeda, 
  * traveling over a long distance in stasis, 
  * meeting aliens, 
  * ai translating and controlling alien technology, 
  * unexpected findings and revelations, 
  plus the stunning visuals - seriously , that movie looks gorgeous . 
  it made me think of what a mass effect movie would look like . 
  i think prometheus is pretty close to how me could turn out . 
  what do you guys think ? 
  are there any other movies that made you think of me ? 
  if i have one father and one mother , that means i have 4 grandparents and 8 great-grandparents . 
  but with 16 great-great-grandparents it kinda loses the point , does n't it ? 
  there are so many of them that they become insignificant .

  or is there a `` correct '' way to do this ? 
  i 'm trying to unify my music collection and this i 'm not sure about .

  i 'm trying to unify my music collection and this i 'm not sure about . 
  i just ca n't find it but i know it used to be there . 
  lots of the playlists on the for you page , also some of the playlists on the browse page . 
  echo '' <div\u00a0style='display:\u00a0table;\u00a0width:100%;height:99%;border:3px\u00a0solid\u00a0green;' '' ;, 
  $ x = rand ( 1,10 ) ;,

  echo '' <br '' ;,

  echo ( ' </table ' ) ;, 
  echo '' </div '' ;, 
  ok , so i know this code is probably a mess to most people but i 'm here to ask about a specific thing . 
  a `` pyramid '' is generated randomly . 
  after a long hit or miss session , i have been able to successfully put it approximately in the center of the page vertically but for the love of god ca n't do it horizontally ( truth is , i have been successful in aligning it horizontally but it breaks the vertical alignment ) . 
  the green line around it is there just to see the borders of the div . 
  so my question is - how can i put the pyramid in the center of the page horizontally and vertically ? 
  i 'm trying to solve a specific problem . 
  i visit this website that features user comments and i want to hide comments from a specific user . 
  [ example site . 
  ] ( http://www.csfd.cz/film/457067-contratiempo/komentare/ ) when i inspect the page code , it 's obvious that each comment window is in a <li tag with id of that specific comment . 
  in that <li tag the user name is mentioned - [ see here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ygsfp ) . 
  could someone help me filter this person 's comments using ublock ? 
  so they do n't appear under any movie profile on that website ?

  did the world split in two , one having 98 % of the population and the other 2 % ? 
  or were those two different worlds from the beginning , where one lost 2 % and the other had the 98 % leave and 2 % stay ? 
  i guess that depends on how that `` departure machine '' works . 
  what if it 's just a teleport between parallel universes , whereas the actual departure was something else ? 
  i read on wikipedia that hitler invaded other countries because he wanted more space for the german people . 
  what if he never did that , but still did everything in germany only ? 
  would other countries react to him exterminating all the jews in his country ? 
  would they ever go to war with him ? 
  or would germany become what north korea is today ? 
  i have z1 compact , it 's already rooted . 
  after the app prompted me to do so i let it update su binaries but that resulted in a bootloop . 
  never mind that , i can deal , but why did that happen ? 
  when it 's winter or it 's cold outside i take comfort in wearing a jacket or a hoodie - it makes me more willing to go outside knowing i 'm not `` exposed '' that much .
