  ** for the simple folk : it wo n't automatically detect artists you added to your library , you have to upload the xml again **, 
  i have experienced bullying in school and what happens to jerry makes me feel exactly how i felt when someone bullied me or if i witnessed someone else being bullied . 
  there really is no humor added either , it 's exactly what the bullies would say and think it was funny . 
  [ the video in question ] ( http://www.xl-gaytube.com/484527/enseando-al-joven.html ), 
  i 'd like to know, 
  * who that guy is, 
  * what studio it is, 
  * what type of porn that is and where can i get more, 
  i just love the way he looks at the camera . 
  nothing comes even close to a combo of mccountry , fries , chicken nuggets and ice tea . 
  what confused me back then was that on tv they talked about taxpayers in the third person . 
  it confused me because i knew we all pay taxes so i wondered who those taxpayers are ? 
  do they pay some taxes for us ? 
  what do they look like ? 
  i think i realized the truth in my late teens . 
  it 's one of those things that just hits you and makes you feel really dumb . 
  / r/totallynotrobots, 
  i recently created a new twitter account and tried to carry over all my follows and lists . 
  when i started recreating the lists i got flagged as a bot . 
  that 's so rude . 
  my external drive started making these crunching noises i already know from my older failed hard drives so i ran crystaldiskinfo and gsmartcontrol with the short test , both said all is good . 
  but when i open seatools the disc shuts off !, 
  i have no idea what is going on . 
  the other disc is detected just fine . 
  i have to reconnect it manually after that . 
  i have windows 10 , acer v17 nitro laptop . 
  are there some other tests i can run ? 
  and why is the official software causing that ? 
  i have the v1 .00 / 1.02 fitgirl repack with the 1.03 baldman update & crack . 
  after i installed the repack and applied the included crack , the game had the bug that shows the @ symbol before every item in the menu . 
  so i installed the baldman update and that fixed it . 
  but i still get no dialogue . 
  when i start the game and there is the repair woman in the hallway - i ca n't even start the conversation , pressing f does n't do anything and then it disappears . 
  it seems like it skips the dialogue . 
  i 'm from the czech republic but i still like to organize my data in english since it looks more ` professional ' . 
  and cool . 
  plus i already have all my devices in english anyway . 
  sometimes it 's hard to come up with a relevant name though . 
  i noticed that people who used to wear braces have sort of ` flat teeth ' - i do n't know how else to describe it . 
  especially the front upper teeth . 
  [ https://soundcloud.com/poshisolation/croatian-amor-enya-caribbean-blue-paradiso-e-edit] ( https://soundcloud.com/poshisolation/croatian-amor-enya-caribbean-blue-paradiso-e-edit ), 
  by ` use ' i do n't mean having it mounted on your dashboard or windshield while it gives you directions . 
  it still runs just as good as when i bought it , i can play all the new games , even the damn dvd drive is working . 
  my previous laptop from 2010 was n't able to run some 2011 games , got really slow after 2 years , dvd drive died very soon ... 
  i know that eventually , i 'll have to swap the hdd and maybe ram but it makes me so happy the price paid off . 
  [ if there is a reason you wo n't find it in the comments ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fvsc6xd.png ), 
  the same is true with adblocking on android . 
  i 'm so used to having all the ads blocked that whenever an ad slips through it throws me off how ugly and off putting it is . 
  i would never be able to use free android apps without adblocking . 
  it 's hideous . 
  any way to improve my experience ? 
  i switched from reddit is fun a long time ago and i still can not get used to this . 
  the popup is incredibly annoying , especially when it needs confirmation . 
  it 's a panasonic nv-ds1 minidv video camera . 
  i recently backed up all the footage to dvds and to pc . 
  everything worked as usual . 
  i have n't used the camera for recording some 7 years but it was used for playback on tv . 
  i bought a new minidv tape ( sony ) and a replacement battery ( not original ) . 
  same thing happens on battery and when plugged in the outlet . 
  i searched online and found these cameras need some cleaning from time to time . 
  does anyone have any experiences with this ? 
  i plan on bringing it to a repair shop but would like to know if someone has already went through with it and if it worked . 
  there 's a cooldown . 
  cool .

  [ article in czech with a photo of the page of the book that mentions all this ] ( https://www.hatefree.cz/blo/hf-zpravy/2316-ucebnice-znasilneni ) . 
  the bold text says :, 
  * ** masochism of the victim **, 
  * ** share of the blame of the victim **, 
  * ** low share of the blame of the aggressor **, 
  * ** exaggeration of the consequences and their trivialization **, 
  this textbook has it all . 
  * when women act provocatively men ca n't control themselves, 
  * she shares the blame when she changes her mind right before or during sex, 
  * if the aggressor is under the influence it 's difficult for him to control himself, 
  * if she was n't physically hurt ( i guess to the point of bleeding ?? ), 
  the consequences of rape are sometimes exaggerated, 
  * women use rape accusations to get back at men , e.g. 
  after an argument , as a justification of a sexual relationship in front of parents ... 
  it 's getting some media attention but of course most people commenting online think the guy who wrote [ the original article about it ] ( http://reportermagazin.cz/a/i2wi7/co-se-uci-policiste-o-znasilneni ) is an idiot and make fun of him . 
  i am so ashamed right now that i live in a country where these stereotypes are taught to law students as facts . 
  [ removed ], 
  i have been to malaysia and the tea party simply ca n't cook . 
  [ removed ], 
  i always read all the parties ' platforms , and decide based on if they even mention lgbt rights or how they mention it . 
  so i 'll always put parties that explicitly state they 'll fight for lgbt rights in the first place , then there are parties that only vaguely group us together under ` minorities ' but that 's fine too . 
  then there are parties who do n't even have minorities mentioned - here i get cautious and try to google articles with opinions of their representatives . 
  and of course , parties who explicitly state they will fight lgbt rights for the sake of traditional values , family , religion , morality ... 
  i do n't vote for those . 
  i have the luxury of choosing between almost 10 parties so i 'm thankful for that . 
  i live in the czech republic . 
  edit : / r/debbiedowner comes back with a vengeance . 
  my 14 year old labrador barks at, 
  * old people, 
  * people in overalls, 
  * bikers, 
  she 's a loudmouth but even if those people entered our yard she would still try to rub herself against their legs hoping for rubs and treats . 
  why would you make a walkthrough when you do n't know what to do in the game ? 
  the purpose of a walkthrough is to show people how to do it . 
  otherwise , it 's just a let 's play video .
