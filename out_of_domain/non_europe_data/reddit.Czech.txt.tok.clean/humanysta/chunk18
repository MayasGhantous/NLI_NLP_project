  then you should know it 's the same with bisexuals . 
  which fallout game is your favourite ? 
  i have only played the third and new vegas and i must say nv is one of my top 10 games . 
  i ca n't get into the old games , i just do n't enjoy them . 
  i wish i did because i 'm really interested in the story . 
  * gta san andreas - my favourite of them all . 
  the fun never ends . 
  * black mirror - this is the game that made me fall in love with point & click adventures . 
  * vietcong - great fps with lovable characters . 
  * stronghold - the only strategy i enjoyed as a kid and still do now . 
  * nfs underground 2 , most wanted - best nfs games , each likeable in a different way , both awesome . 
  * race driver grid - legend . 
  i breathe this game , it 's so good . 
  * syberia - one of the most emotional and beautiful gaming experiences . 
  * max payne 1,2 - dark , atmospheric with breathtaking action . 
  * call of duty 1,2 - another classic . 
  i feel every polygon of these games . 
  i 'd say video . 
  but overall it 's ideal to do both . 
  i am also looking forward to gtav . 
  it 's so frustrating to see my brother playing to on his ps4 . 
  what disappointed me though is that i had to buy the rockstar social club key , because it was on sale and it was 30 % cheaper than the steam version !, 
  i wanted the steam version so bad , but how could i buy it if even the retail version is 40 % cheaper ? 
  so i ended up buying the cheapest digital version i could find . 
  fallout 4 , mass effect 4 . 
  at least i hope those will be released within 2 years . 
  i finished the last wolfenstein a couple of days ago , it was awesome . 
  now i 'm starting with the metro redux . 
  i have played the first game when it was released but never the second one , so i decided to do them both with the redux facelift . 
  the gameplay is already archaic compared to inquisition , but nothing can beat those characters and the story !, 
  especially when it 's available in your country . 
  the playing with a knife does n't have to mean anything . 
  my friend has a small pocket knife and sometimes plays with it during conversations . 
  some people do that with other things ( hair , phone ... ) . 
  you 're right . 
  but he might not realize that . 
   ** / r/trashy is a celebration of trash ** : people , things , media , etc. 
  ** that boldly and shamelessly violates social conventions and cultural norms ** . 
  satisfy our voyeuristic drives by sharing trashy images , videos , stories , and fashion . 
  all forms of trash are eagerly welcomed . 
  i think this violates social norms perfectly . 
  i read the sidebar before i posted , unlike you . 
  yeah , i thought she meant her dad at first . 
  you do n't have to sign your replies on reddit . 
  i see . 
  half the sub is not trash then , just saying . 
  having it as a profile picture seems a bit too much , but please feel free to make assumptions about people you do n't know personally . 
  it 's entirely objective . 
  just like masturbation . 
  some people need 15 minutes while some are done in 5 . 
  yes i did . 
  thanks for correcting me . 
  chicosvideo.com has lots of them in good quality . 
  if you decide for circumcision , there 's no need to worry . 
  i 've had mine done when i was 17 and even though it was uncomfortable for a couple of weeks , i was fine soon enough . 
  i love it . 
  i did n't care about it before . 
  to the [ nicest place on the interet ] ( http://thenicestplaceontheinter.net/ ) of course !, 
  * the walking dead * and * keeping up with the kardashians * . 
  that would be fucking hilarious . 
  * make a multireddit where you put as many musical subreddits as possible . 
  * create a youtube playlist folder where you put as many musical channels as possible . 
  * subscribe to multiple services like google music and use their different options, 
  * listen to radio stations available online, 
  * let your friends suggest you their favourites, 
  * google lists of music , there are tons, 
  * go to rating sites like metacritic, 
  this is good . 
  simple and clear . 
  i like it !, 
  i wish i could just give you the ability to grow beard . 
  it 's so annoying . 
  that yelling was annoying . 
  description from the site :, 
   silvie dym\u00e1kov\u00e1 's raw documentary uncovers the manipulation and pressure that exist behind the closed doors of `` product demonstration excursions for seniors '' in the czech republic . 
  the sad heroes of her film show us the non-functional saucepans , unused vacuum cleaners , `` wool '' blankets and bio-lamps they bought during such excursions for tens or even hundreds of thousands czech crowns ... and that is the best case scenario . 
  in exchange for their id cards confiscated by sellers , many have signed loan contracts . 
  despite their shocking experiences , the elderly take part in these events again and again in a bid to escape their loneliness or because they ca n't say no to the offers . 
  dym\u00e1kov\u00e1 succeeded in smuggling a hidden camera into product presentations and analyzed the high-pressure methods . 
  this documentary was a big success in czech republic . 
  i thought you guys might like it . 
  ads are the price you accepted when you started using the service for free . 
  it 's great to see a european country doing this . 
  i hope others will follow . 
  i meant the `` not so internationally known '' european countries . 
  you know , like that little shithole czech republic i 'm stuck in . 
  i 'm just jealous , that 's all . 
  i guess membership of european union is just a coincidence ? 
  i did n't get the update yet and this scares me . 
  which one ? 
  from my experience every gta since vice city is perfectly playable with k&m . 
  some people would rather play a bad port than no port at all . 
  i agree that for racing games a gamepad is way better ( although not necessary , i used to play everything with k&m just a few years ago and i was fine ) , but taking a gamepad to gta just seems unnecessary . 
  of course feel free to play the game the way you like , but cars in gta were always k&m friendly so if you want to try it it should n't be a problem . 
  [ of course !, 
  ( nsfw ) ] ( http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=1871164941 ), 
  that is not a problem , that is a cultural thing . 
  did you get dumped recently ? 
  maybe if we did n't have to wait for each brand to compile their own sack of shit , it would have been better . 
  it 's actually inteded to look that way , the directors are great with cameras .
