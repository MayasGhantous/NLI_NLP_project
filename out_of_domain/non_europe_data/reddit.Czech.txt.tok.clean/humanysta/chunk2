  i am a big americanaphile and those flags inspired by the american flag are awesome . 
  i will never forget myself for voting fack over lose yourself , but it had to be done . 
  i noticed this too . 
  i was just listening to it this weekend and suddenly it 's gone . 
  sure , i 'll wait . 
  no heartbreaking photos of the policemen ? 
  they are in the worst position in this and always take the most heat . 
  how can someone support these rioters ? 
  what 's it going to help destroying everything around you ? 
  what are you waiting for ? 
  [ scary movie ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttvytboheg0 ), 
  i tried to cross the road on a bicycle before the truck approaching from the right . 
  i managed to crash into it 's side . 
  the result - first grader with a cracked skull , covered in blood , dragged by his super angry mom in her car and then driven to the hospital . 
  i swear that everytime i see parents crying for their children in movies i just remember my mom being furious . 
  that 's how your parents will react in real life . 
  i was n't wearing a helmet . 
  i have a scar on my head that 's staying forever . 
  everytime i ride a bike now , i put my helmet on . 
  true story . 
  i take my dog for a walk , preferably somewhere quiet . 
  she is the only living creature that makes me smile everytime i see her . 
  she 's my best friend . 
  i can think about whatever i want , she wo n't disrupt my thoughts . 
  dogs are just awesome . 
  when i was a little kid i thought being gay was funny ( damn police academy and their blue oyster ) . 
  then i realized i was gay when i was about 14yo and suddenly i was all accepting . 
  sometimes i think about that if i did n't turn out to be gay if i would sympathise with lgbt people or be tolerant like i am now . 
  this whole ` being gay thing ' made me think twice before i start judging other people . 
  what if i grew up to be just another racist , homophobic misogynist ? 
  if so , at least it would n't be my parents ' fault , but the society i grew up in . 
  horse cock and lion 's head . 
  us would invade first , that 's for sure . 
  you know , freedom and stuff . 
  russia would ban alien-earthling propaganda . 
  north korea would launch a missile and blow itself up by accident . 
  eu would try to regulate some more stuff they know nothing about . 
  these `` yeah , right ? '', 
  conversations would get really old soon . 
  godzilla ( terribly underrated ), 
  epic movie . 
  sometimes i feel i was the only one having fun watching this film . 
  can someone provide a link to the whole list ? 
  i ca n't find it in the article . 
  thank you . 
  maybe not the best tip but i suggest you to check out [ v/h/s ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2105044/combined ) and [ its sequel ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2450186/combined ) . 
  these movies consist of several short stories and i am sure some of them are paranormal . 
  the rest covers all other variations of the horror genre . 
  i love them but i must be inside . 
  it just feels like some kind of a terrible disaster is happening outside and i am safe inside my house . 
  and the rain also helps . 
  rainless storm is no storm !, 
  this is the exact reason why i do n't watch any sport on tv . 
  it 's just so terrible when someone looses . 
  i just hate seeing people sad . 
  on the other hand , that 's what makes you a good athlete - when you can get up after you loose and just try harder for the next time . 
  at least i guess so , i know nothing about sports . 
  i 'm gay and everytime i see a straight sex/kissing scene , i skip over it in disgust . 
  except when the guy is hot . 
  why not just weigh the poop ? 
  yes . 
  the idea of a pumping heart is disgusting but i guess stopping it is not the solution . 
  also i hate feeling the pulse , which is the reason why i do n't wear a watch . 
  you probably did n't see [ this film ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106476/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) . 
  how long does it usually take to create the recommendations ? 
  and that is a spoiler , sir . 
  yeah i 'm interested in this too . 
  when the tv here in czech republic aires movie that is inappropriate for children , they just do it after 10pm when it 's legal and it goes uncensored . 
  that 's why we get south park on national television . 
  wtf ? 
  where does this happen ? 
  i have never seen anyone just leave the shopping cart !, 
  everyone returns it . 
  seriously , i did n't know about this . 
  i came here to write this . 
  everyone should have a teleport machine at home . 
  just imagine the possibilities !, 
  and not just a simple teleport - i want it to be just like the floo network in harry potter . 
  i swear if my dreams were recorded , there would be some really cool disaster movies available . 
  this is a bit creepy i know , but i always wanted some device that would save the exact copy of anyone i want to fuck and i could later `` spawn '' that person with preprogrammed state of mind ( meanig that for example the person would think we 're partners ) . 
  everyone you have a crush on saved in you pocket ready to make love anytime . 
  well that does n't work for me . 
  i need the thumbnails of videos to be visibly marked as watched and youtube just does n't do that . 
  yes , time to time it does but mostly it does n't . 
  this happens to me only shower gel . 
  for example sometimes i 'm not sure if i managed to wash both of my arms or just one . 
  i did n't know about this and it 's awesome !, 
  i 've been scanning books all morning . 
  i love how it finds the exact edition . 
  you could also say that they should n't make the movies in the first place because it 's a waste of money as well . 
  ** colin mcrae rally ** is my favourite right now . 
  improved graphics and perfect gameplay . 
  the only thing i miss is support for otg-connected gamepad . 
  try to listen to some related music when reading . 
  for example , when i was reading the witcher , i was listening to medieval type of music or some thrilling movie scores are great for nesb\u00f8 's books . 
  love actually is the only romantic/relationship film i like and it 's one of my most favourite films i have ever seen . 
  ** r.i.p.d ** is extremely underrated . 
  it 's a men in black rip-off but i had fun watching it . 
  this sound pretty serious . 
  i mean if those creatures continued to spread like this , how does the area look now ?
