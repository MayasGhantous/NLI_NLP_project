  i wonder what the reasoning behind that is . 
  it seems to me that their reason is probably the second one . 
  i think the first one seems too extreme and the third one is very improbable . 
  none of those `` reasons '' is reasonable though . 
  hopefully , this changes . 
  my country also sterilized in the past , mostly romani women . 
  but that 's definitely not the case now . 
  although it 's true some people are still stuck in the past so who knows ... 
  yes , i wish our experience with streaming services generally was n't limited to their apps . 
  and easily transferable music collections would be great , too . 
  no , that 's nicolas cage, 
  does it create a new copy of every downloaded song ? 
  i have a problem with players not recognizing music on sd card except poweramp anyway so i ' l probably just stick with gmp for now , at least it works . 
  `` i remember '' is a good example, 
  oh i ca n't get enough of this !, 
  butthurt redditors whine about john oliver not living up to their expectations . 
  this is orgasmic . 
  i hate it when i ca n't get into something that is very popular . 
  this is the face of regret . 
  there 's a fucking zombie kid in the backgroud , how have i never noticed that ? 
  i like turtles !, 
  anything is possible . 
  i personally grew only 5cm between 15-18 and that 's when it stopped . 
  everybody is different so it might be different for you . 
  also , the left menu has been a little bit reorganized , i like it !, 
  empty food packaging , sharpening a pencil , useless paper or what do you do after you 're done chewing a bubblegum ? 
  stick it on your desk ? 
  it must be , i can only see [ 10 random stations ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cpxgtcw.png ) and nothing more . 
  plus the android app has not been updated for me . 
  i hope you picked your bakery wisely . 
  except islam , most redditors are perfectly ok `` questioning '' islam . 
  try a different browser . 
  if it works there , reinstall chrome . 
  bad taste does n't make you an asshole . 
  ruined ? 
  people in this subreddit are always so nice , i love it !, 
  i tried that when reinstalling my phone and sadly it did n't work . 
  there may be a workaround , but i doubt it - it seems the files are encrypted in a way that does n't let you manipulate them . 
  lucky you , i doubt it would be possible in my language because of the way last names work .

  if you like exploring foreign music , 
  this would be hilarious to see in a movie . 
  sucks to experience it in real life . 
  i was circumcised at 17 . 
  it 's going to be as you describe it for some time but after couple of months you 'll be fine . 
  edit : this [ blog ] ( http://swedecirc2.blogspot.cz/?zx=e5b67aa7d497a435 ) describes the process of healing . 
  not necessarily . 
  depends on how you are used to masturbate . 
  check out this [ blog ] ( http://swedecirc2.blogspot.cz/?zx=e5b67aa7d497a435 ) . 
  i used it as `` moral support '' before and after . 
  you are a true saint . 
  i wish they let us at least transfer the information about what was offline so we would n't have to do it manually every time ... 
  what does a shitty circumcision look like ? 
  what can go wrong with that ? 
  hey that 's the search engine that still indexes warez !, 
  i worry about the cashier judging me . 
  thank god for self checkouts . 
  or entire nations , or maybe entire planets, 
  yeah , fuck them and fuck you too !, 
  they 're unemployed so they spend time posting pics on reddit . 
  i 'm not good with caricatures , is that hillary on the left ? 
  it 's simple and easy and generates interesting statistics . 
  it seems it 's not working . 
  it was n't on beats music ? 
  that 's ... sad . 
  oh , i forgot about that . 
  ( no pun intended ), 
  yeah they did , but i think beats music still exists , which is weird . 
  nice try , you 're still europeans , englishmen . 
  do n't worry , jesus is with you now . 
  is that a bad thing ? 
  it is n't more racist , it 's just racist as [ well ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/fleetwood_round_table_wishing_well_-_dsc06564.jpg ) . 
  well tell your dad to have a nice day and to continue in his studies . 
  right now i am with google music because of the option to upload missing music . 
  but , if apple music has a bigger catalogue , is faster , more intuitive , better designed , then maybe i might consider migrating . 
  he spelled it the way it should be spelled . 
  you could say that about any artist . 
  this is great !, 
  alt-tabing or using my phone to help with collectables is one of the most frustrating things ever . 
  just do n't force her into sports . 
  still no update for the pc version !, 
  this is so frustrating , i 've been waiting and checking itunes for updates since launch . 
  great way to convince me to switch , apple ... 
  i never delete my posts . 
  even though i 've changed my mind about lots of things i 've written on reddit in the past . 
  because i know how frustrating it is seeing deleted comments . 
  from my experience , people usually delete their comments after an unsuccessful argument . 
  do n't feel pressured to accept it . 
  live your life the way that makes you happy . 
  all i see is them communicating in a polite way and being replied by a drama queen . 
  if you 're a professional you do n't care why people cancel on you . 
  ok , so something seriously weird is happening . 
  after itunes does n't have access to the original file it uploaded anymore , it warns me and asks me if i want to search for it . 
  when i click `` cancel '' and try to play the song again it plays as it should . 
  why do i get this one-time error and how do i get rid of it ? 
  edit : seems all you have to do is delete local files * through itunes * and then there 's no error . 
  sorry if it 's obvious to you but i 'm new to itunes . 
  with itunes create a smart playlist with a rule to add liked ( hearted ) songs and it automatically adds all hearted songs , even retrospectively .
