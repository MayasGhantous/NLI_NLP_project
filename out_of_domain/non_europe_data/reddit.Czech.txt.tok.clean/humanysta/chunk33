  what you describe as a high is what non smokers feel regularly . 
  i love the show , ama ? 
  yeah , nothing spicy touches my mouth . 
  it completely kills any taste . 
  him , byze , sips with hat films and seananners . 
  love them . 
  that 's what i do in gta . 
  like it 's the most worstest of the worstening worst ? 
  so you 're one of those people who argue with me , but as soon as they start receiving downvotes delete they 're post to save their precious karma score ? 
  where 's the excitement in that ? 
  not ideal , but maybe try adding the song in your library first and then to the playlist . 
  i do n't understand why links like this open itunes but do n't show the playlist . 
  yep . 
  you ca n't add songs to a playlist :, 
  * from the upper part that shows which song is playing, 
  * from the search results until you open them, 
  * from the radio, 
  what is also super confusing is that i can do * ... -  add to -  create new playlist * only from my music . 
  wtf ? 
  also there is no way to go back to the currently playing playlist ... 
  if you 're the murderer , please do n't forget to update !, 
  i live in the czech republic and i consider myself average tall . 
  i rarely meet anyone who is significantly taller or shorter . 
  funny how some people praise him until he touches a topic they masturbate to and slaps them on their dick . 
   2 . do you think last week tonight accurately portrays your personal opinions towards the issues discussed ? 
  you just had to be passive-agressive ... 
  i am a subscriber . 
   i 've definitely noticed that ** the women i know ** tend to hold their male partners ( and even just male friends ) to societal expectations much more than ** the women i know ** . 
  say what ? 
  what is you favourite popular song right now ? 
  do you like pharell 's freedom ? 
  i actually kinda like it , but it 's already starting to get a bit annoying because i keep hearing it on beats 1 . 
  well , i must say number 33 is a really good and decent photo . 
  this is limit for uploaded songs , not those i add from apple music , right ? 
  sorry for the choice of words but that is fucking retarded . 
  i have so much more music than 25k on spotify and google music . 
  so basically i ca n't transition because of this until they raise the limit . 
  nice . 
  i still do n't understand why they did n't separate my music and playlists . 
  if every song from my playlists did n't automatically get added to my library as well , it might 've been less dramatic . 
  how is this different from clicking the three dots and adding to playlist which also adds it to my music ? 
  it 's actually a good thing . 
  imagine you added an album to my music and some songs from the album to a playlist . 
  if deleting them from the playlist did the same for my music , you would end up with an incomplete album in your library . 
  this might fit more in / r/conspiracy , but i think the reason women 's world cup is all over front page is because * some * redditors need to prove themselves they are not sexist after the backslash against pao . 
  what the fuck , the aliens have landed . 
  why over simplicate like this ? 
  there are so many different reasons why someone would downvote , none of which is `` because they 're a redditor and reddit sucks '' . 
  no , reddit does n't suck . 
  i do n't get this . 
  how could you piss somebody off if you 're being non-conflictive ? 
  i rarely get any negative responses . 
  do you frequent default subs and controversial posts ? 
  we all share the same fears . 
  my phone does , i like adding gps coordinates too . 
  when i share a photo , i obviously do n't want to share where i live so this comes in handy . 
  you look good , i 'd say 7/10 . 
  you definitely do n't look boring . 
  jesus , you scared me , you look exactly how i imagine one of my friends might look in 8 years , he 's 20 now . 
  sorry , i ca n't rate you properly because of that . 
  very good looking , i 'd say 8/10 at least . 
  keep up the good work at looking good !, 
  yeah , why do n't you have a seat and watch them comfortably ? 
  should have had that bulletproof vest on , you never know if there is going to be a shooting . 
  i think people fighting on the streets would be arrested just as quick as those `` fuckers '' would . 
  probably just like any other kid . 
  handsome guy , just like a pretty girl , differs greatly person to person . 
  not everybody finds the same traits attractive , you know . 
  because for `` normal '' people it 's already difficult to grasp the concept of homosexuality and transsexuality . 
  it 's easy for them to dismiss a problem of a minority within a minority , when they already doubt the credibility of gay/trans claims . 
  they feel an agenda is pushed on them and start being even more dismissive . 
  yes , please , then there would be one less argument against the validity of some minorities within the minority . 
  i 'm gay and i have no preference towards masculine or feminine men . 
  what i find attractive about the feminine ones ? 
  it 's the feminity in a man 's body . 
  it 's the gentle and sensitive aspect of it that still allows me to have all that in a male body , which i am attracted to . 
  this is true , there are some traits that are often agreed on by many people . 
  i just do n't like it , because i disagree with them so often . 
  it makes me even mad sometimes . 
  definitely tell him . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ even ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ though ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ personally ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ disagree ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sentiment , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ would ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ great ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ finally ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ someone ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ recognize ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sexuality ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ stop ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ acting ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ like ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ they ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ forgot ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ about ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it . 
  do n't listen to him , it looks gorgeous !, 
  yeah , he 's not my type but defly looks good . 
  i 'd post a picture but that 's wrong without his permission . 
  meanwhile in syria : `` i witnessed a public hangin ' '', 
  they just all moved their `` discussion '' in separate subreddits . 
  it only shows two playlists i do n't even have . 
  it does n't allow me to add the song in my playlists . 
  i do . 
  but only because he 's hot . 
  no way , i hated that bitch . 
  no , people just want to know if they can hate her or not . 
  and of course somebody has to ask if she 's really fat . 
  unless you 're a fph supporter , there 's no reason to ask . 
  it 's the first thing you noticed because you ca n't stop thinking about fat people and now you pretend to be just asking a question * definitely not motivated by hatred * . 
  sacred jewish waste ? 
  i guess it 's you . 
   it 's kicking and screaming on voat, 
  ftfy, 
  wait , i thought we were talking about tumblr users , not fph supporters,
