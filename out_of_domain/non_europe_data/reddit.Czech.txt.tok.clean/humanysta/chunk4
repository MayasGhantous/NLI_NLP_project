  no sibling . 
  i would go to school that is interesting for me , not the one that guarantees me a pretty good chance to find a job . 
  i once asked my mom who is a whore . 
  i heard it in a rock song . 
  she asked me if it 's the band she thought and i said yes . 
  she was not happy but did n't take away the cassette ( yes , cassette ) . 
  tagged . 
  i found a script that removes the torrent from the queue when the download is finished . 
  there probably is a way to not seed at all , but this suits me well . 
  one of my classmates played on his phone this high pitched sound for about 20 minutes and the teacher did n't notice . 
  the rest of the class did . 
  hw turned it off only because he could n't take it himself . 
  i borrowed my mom 's fantomas , and there was a picture of sandokan in it as a bookmark . 
  she told me she used to be a big fan . 
  it also feels great that my parents grew up reading books , but i guess more kids were reading in the 80 's . 
  this is great because i think the movie is so underrated . 
  i really liked it , but everyone else tells me how boring it was for them . 
  yes . 
  teacher encourages experiments = bad idea . 
  i really admire him for not punching her in her fat fucking face . 
  i say it all the time - there should be a child license . 
  you would have to do psychological tests , you would have to prove you are capable to take care of the child - basically the same adoptive parents have to do . 
  of course the population would have to be temporarily sterilized until proven capable of raising a child . 
  i do n't say it can be done now , but in the future , sure . 
  it would be just the same as with the adoptions . 
  finally an opinion that lots of people disagree with . 
  can you explain to me how does my opinion classify as supporting eugenics ? 
  wiki says `` eugenics is the belief and practice of improving the genetic quality of the human population . '', 
  that 's not what i said . 
  he looks like he 's holding in a shit . 
  you should stop trying lsd . 
  you 're right , i 'm 19 . 
  i am going to watch it for the cgi . 
  i do n't mute the sound , but still am a bit afraid that i might not hear the footsteps . 
  i am the same . 
  i just wish i was forced to study a particular school so i could bitch about it . 
  now it has all been my choices and i am not happy with this . 
  i am the guy . 
  thank you for your compassion . 
  well , this might be a ** spoiler ** but he does n't do that much , at least not in the second season . 
  he 's just not the type of comedian you enjoy . 
  try some others . 
  my favourites are chris rock , george carlin , ricky gervais or lisa lampanelli . 
  i do n't know if it classifies as stealing but it is wrong . 
  just because you can take it , so the original `` item '' is still there , does n't make it ok . 
  if you went to a store and copied a product , it is n't gone from the shelf so the vendor can still sell it , but who is going to buy a product , that you can copy for free ? 
  that 's why the vendor is trying to protect the product by enforcing law or applying an `` anti-copying protection '' . 
  seriously , anyone who justifies piracy is a fucking asshole . 
  i do n't say i do n't do it , but for fucks sake i 'm not saying it is ok , because it 's not !, 
  now , let me `` borrow '' this album i will never listen to but i will have it on my harddrive anyway . 
  ok , so now the videos started suddenly working , but there 's no sound . 
  and i have no idea why . 
  i did n't even restart the browser . 
  after a restart no video again ... 
  well i use firefox as a main browser , but i also use opera only for viewing youtube - because the addon that marks ytb videos as watched works only for opera . 
  yes it helped , thanks . 
  could someone please explain this to me ? 
  how is it possible , that there was n't atheism in history as we understand it today ? 
  how was it possible that almost all people believed and no one seriously questioned it ? 
  were they afraid of prosecution ? 
  i just ca n't imagine it , but that 's probably because i was raised in a religiously `` neutral '' family , we never had any reason to discuss religion ( except one time , when mom told me , that it 's probably not a good idea to listen to a song called `` go satan go '' in public , because it might make some people angry ) . 
  well i know almost nothing about drugs , but from the little i know , cocaine and heroin seem pretty the same to me . 
  what 's the difference when it comes to addictiveness or danger to health ? 
  i was just reading some comments in [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/morbidreality/comments/1o5lm9/driver_sitting_near_the_body_of_8_year_old_boy/ ) thread and some people mentioned , that you are not required to provide first aid . 
  that shocked me , because in my country ( czech republic ) it is a ** criminal offense ** if you do n't , and we learn how to do it several times throughout school . 
  of course nobody can force you to help if it endangers your own health , but if you hit someone with your car , you ca n't just say `` i do n't have to do anything '' and just call an ambulance . 
  all i see is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xz3sddk.jpg ) . 
  gas pedal , gas pedal , gas pedal ... 
  i just read the title and thought this was an iama ... 
  i did n't read the whole title and thought that she grew up to be a sexy korean girl . 
  well i thought that washing machines are supposed to be in the bathroom ... 
  / r/daddit - i would love to be a dad one day , but there are two reasons i ca n't afford it in near future . 
  first is that i am gay and we ca n't legally adopt a child in my country yet , and the second is that i am simply not a responsible person now and need more time to grow up . 
  i think that right now i would be a terrible father , but who knows , maybe one day i will be ready . 
  that subreddit is just a great way to see happy fathers with their happy children , and i hope i will become one of those fathers one day and be able to post there . 
  my favourite is the r formed with stars in the san andreas sky . 
  three days ago i bought two slices of pizza and they gave it to me on a paper plate with no napkin . 
  the pizza was soaked with grease and it was dripping from it every time i tried to eat it . 
  plus the slices were super thin so i had to fold them to be able to eat them . 
  pizza to go never again . 
  i think you 're not supposed to overthink it like that . 
  i do n't know if there 's proof that says otherwise but is n't a zombie kinda unrealistic ? 
  yesterday i pooped twice . 
  me too , it 's just more comfortable , especially in the morning . 
  date movie . 
  i heard so much shit being said about this film but i just love it . 
  in one year you wo n't change at all . 
  well i guess it was , but somehow i ca n't enjoy my pizza when i 'm drowning in it . 
  maybe it 's just me being an idiot , but i thought they do n't stay that way forever ? 
  i often browse the top links and i know that i already have seen some of those and they look untouched . 
  yes i do . 
  sad about this is that these kinds of things should be more ok to show on tv then what is now . 
  i will never understand how can be csi aired in the afternoon and game of thrones has to be aired after 10pm ... 
  thats really surprising , i was never able to tell any diference between her lyrics and for example rihanna 's ( who i 'm sure does n't ) . 
  but that 's probably because i need to read the lyrics when listening to a song to understand it completely . 
  it makes me sad to say this , but atheists . 
  we need to balance the internet a little bit . 
  i think there 's a big difference between thinking about it and considering it . 
  i think about it often , but never considered it as an option . 
  i think that islam is pretty cool .
