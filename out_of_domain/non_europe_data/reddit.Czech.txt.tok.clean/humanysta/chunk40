  good , i like using spotify on slow connections and it 's far faster than other services . 
  most people only saw the trailer . 
  i will still rather judge the movie after watching it . 
   assertions, 
  i was the one calling others out on making assertions . 
  you can make an album without rape jokes and other juvenile shit . 
  i know it 's hard to imagine , but it 's possible . 
  every rap album is also not made by a dude who looks he died 10 years ago . 
  you do n't even know what you wrote . 
   the dude was blocking the left lane , if he was n't he would n't have ** needed ** to pass on the right, 
  he did n't need to pass him . 
   if the guy would have moved over and let him pass there would have been no aggression, 
  you have no right to be aggressive towards bad drivers . 
  when you cause an accident raging , you 're the idiot . 
  you 're still arguing that other drivers ' unlawful behaviour legitimizes law breaking and road raging . 
   no , i am arguing that the aggressive driving would not have been necessary, 
  here you go again , saying that it was necessary . 
  not this bullshit show again . 
  you are avoiding your errors . 
  admit them . 
  new john oliver video upvoted ? 
  must be non-triggering for social injustice warriors . 
  you 're calling me names and avoiding your error still . 
  i did n't even know these existed !, 
  apple juice and water . 
  / r/lewronggeneration, 
  i probably am , it 's just that a belief or lack of belief is usually something you feel strongly about and is with you your whole life . 
  no , i was raised in a household where religion never was a topic of conversation . 
  a fleshlight . 
  please do n't judge . 
  and it 's really great is n't it ? 
  no one tells you what to think and you are free to make you own opinion . 
  of course , that has nothing to do with religion though . 
  that makes sense . 
  what pisses me off is that it seems like there are no gay people around me . 
  i am on vacation in italy , there are tons of couples and i have n't seen a single gay couple holding hands in the last two weeks . 
  feels lonely . 
  yeah , i can clearly see the emotion in your title . 
  you would n't be that angry if he was n't rich , would you ? 
  you are the brat , op . 
  just because he burnt a car most people ca n't afford does n't make him a worse person than a poor guy who burnt his shitty car to get a less shitty car . 
  you avoided the question . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  i said if a poor person did it under the same conditions , op would still hate the rich kid more . 
  maybe it 's punishing your government for the crimes against the kurds . 
  yes , all the time . 
  and it is completely ok , you are not required to be comfortable with it no matter what people say . 
  you ca n't really say that , because those ` commands ' you speak of are not always justifiable . 
  police officers are out of control , especially in countries like usa with its gun culture . 
  police needs the guns because of the gun culture , that 's why they use it . 
  still does n't make you a worse person because you are wealthy . 
  my butt had been bleeding for two months now and i have n't done anything about it yet . 
  i do n't think it will thank me for anything in the near future . 
  just drink more soda , it has water in it too !, 
  that 's because the answer usually contains more than just ` no ' or ` yes ' . 
  usually it mentions that their opinion is often downvoted and they totally do n't deserve that . 
  and guess what that brings . 
  downvotes . 
  just because it 's a ferrari does n't mean burning it is worse . 
   after minutes of them bugging me i 'd give in and tell them what i think , only to have him proceed to tell me why its wrong and his is right . 
  what 's the problem here ? 
  exchanging opinions is useless if you do n't challenge your opponent . 
  if you say ` a ' and he says ` b ' and then you sit in silence , what 's that for ? 
  it 's actually / r/askmen, 
  you keep talking about a different thing . 
  i say that burning your car when rich is not worse than burning your car when poor . 
   extremely poor man, 
  why extremely ? 
  i just said poor . 
   nope , maybe not a spoiled brat , but still a dick . 
  my point . 
  wealth does n't determine how much guilty you are . 
  you just do n't want to understand it , do you ? 
  i said that if you burn a car ** to get a better one ** your wealth does n't matter . 
  i never said anything about burning a car that is not functioning . 
  no you would n't . 
  i can tell from the downvotes how much i 've hurt your feelings . 
   the fucker lit one of these on fire , to collect insurance money . 
  that 's ... unforgivable . 
  please show me a scale where on the far right , at the end the worst , unforgivable crime is lighting an arguably good car on fire . 
  where do you put serious crime like murder or rape on this scale ? 
  and i 'll consider you an equal human being . 
  how about that ? 
  oh , the terrible downvotes , they hurt so much !, 
  please stop , my precious karma can not be lost !, 
  no it does n't . 
  no it is n't . 
  like , totally . 
  that 's because i do n't comment for a living . 
  you 're the leader of the downvoters ? 
  why did n't you say so ? 
  then that 's the case of disagreeing downvotes . 
  thank you . 
  please go through my comment history and downvote everything . 
  yet so many people had to respond to my comments . 
  it 's easier to ignore , you know ? 
  his comment is just as valid as yours . 
  art is a matter of opinion . 
  no , recognizing something as art is a matter of opinion . 
  if people in this thread truly did n't care about wealth , they would n't react to my comments .
