  he just stated that he 's going to wait for scripthook to update . 
  he did n't complain about rockstar messing it up . 
  he will be if he has to pay for that . 
  he 's referencing a movie . 
  that would help the situation . 
  because he 's not a dick . 
  or do n't overreact and resolve the situation like a decent human being . 
  convenient when you would want to cut in front of someone . 
  just lay on the sorry horn and you 're good to go . 
  thanks for the downvote , sure makes you look mature . 
  the point is you can not even follow the few simple rules this site has . 
  [ reddiquette ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette ) says `` do n't downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you do n't personally like it . '', 
  nobody is going to enforce that but why would n't you follow these rules of common decency ? 
  because that 's your job , to enforce rules of the road . 
  just as the law says it - everybody is a police officer . 
  most probably not , just do n't mind the idiots downvoting you . 
  because that 's how you 're supposed to vote on reddit . 
  that 's a good thing , we do n't need brigading on facebook . 
  still better than russia . 
  or maybe neither . 
  the friend 's comment was way more tactless . 
  also , since when does ` not attractive to me ' means unattractive ? 
  there are plenty of guys i personally do n't find attractive but most people do . 
  that 's nothing compared to what one of my teachers in high school did - he blew at the projector from the ground ... 
  i do , i use it to connect with friends when i 'm on my computer . 
  it 's very useful when you 're a student . 
  let me upload unavailable music !, 
  that 's the only thing keeping me from switching back to spotify . 
  i tried it once and it hurt so i 've never done it again . 
  spotify has the best playlists actually . 
  apple music has very few of them and they are short and google music does n't even let me browse them due to country restrictions ... 
  yes , but those files have to be in the same place and you have to be in the same network with both devices . 
  you ca n't stream the music on your phone , it has to be saved . 
  well compared to no playlists from gm and very limited playlists from am i 'll take generic any day . 
  czech republic . 
  i can see top songs and albums , new albums , recommended albums and 10 radio stations . 
  that 's it . 
  yep . 
  every gm update is like a christmas present to me , but always empty ... 
  there is n't an outrage over circumcision , there 's an outrage over forced circumcision . 
  what do you mean ? 
  do they ask the kid if he wants it ? 
  it 's irreversible . 
  it 's like forcing them to have a tattoo . 
  unfortunatelly i already am at 5.1.1 unrooted so i would have to downgrade , root etc. 
  how can you compare that ? 
  are you trolling ? 
  you seriously think it 's similar to cutting off a piece of your genitalia for no valid medical reason ? 
  from now on i will use this video as a proof that not all bikers are assholes like some people like to claim . 
  i do n't think that 's a school bus ( if those are even a thing there ) but this is most likely a bus a class would take for a school trip . 
  oh look , it 's happening again !, 
  when whites do it , it 's completely unrelated to their culture , but if other ethnicities do it , it 's because it 's their culture . 
  if you wash your penis every day , there is no problems with hygiene . 
  those are busted myths . 
  it is n't even comparable to wisdom teeth . 
   multiculturalism, 
   i am waiting for the riots like this in places like sweden where they welcome everyone but have no places to live . 
   nothing says religion of peace like fleeing a war zone to start a new one in a peaceful country . 
  that 's what i 've responded to . 
  to those racist assholes . 
  and you 're one of them . 
  because my point was that the dispute is not caused by their ethnicity or religion . 
  exactly , ethnic relations . 
  not the ethnicity itself . 
  yeah , i wish i had such caring parents too . 
  i actually bought ps4 because the controller was more comfortable ... 
  for me it 's perfect . 
  the xbox controller makes my hands hurt after a while . 
  yeah , they better make it in time , i am not paying for a service i ca n't use on my phone !, 
  exactly . 
  you have to save it . 
  you ca n't stream it . 
  since none of the generators did it correctly , here is a [ screen ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dafoznq.png ) . 
  ** tyga - fuk wat they talkin bout ** : my favourite rap mixtape/album this year . 
  it 's just fun . 
  easy listening . 
  ** jay rock - 90059 ** : nothing special . 
  listened to it once and did n't think much of it . 
  it 's the second most listened because i usually do n't listen to whole albums , except when they 're released . 
  ** brett eldredge - illinois ** : a good country album . 
  nothing more to say really . 
  ** natalie prass - natalie prass ** : great chill album . 
  all i need . 
  the rest is usually just a couple of songs played multiple times . 
  ** cold . 
  mercy . 
  do n't like . 
  ** ca n't get enough of it . 
  ** new day ** every day , forever . 
  ** big hoops ( bigger the better ) ** sounds unfinished but still great . 
  google music and apple music let you do just that . 
  if google and apple can let you do it , why not spotify ? 
  yeah , the amount of people jerking over this looking like a bomb is just to damn high . 
  clocks ? 
  do n't you mean bombs ? 
  i 've actually never thought of that . 
  it 's too soon to even imagine what the world will be like when we 're old . 
  we do that as well here in the czech republic , 
  some of us like her music because of how it sounds , not because we care about authenticity or lyrics . 
  music does n't have to be `` intellectually stimulating '' to be enjoyable you know .
