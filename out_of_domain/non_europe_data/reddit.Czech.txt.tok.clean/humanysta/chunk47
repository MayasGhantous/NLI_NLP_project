  i hope this is just a joke because this is very disturbing if it really happened . 
  i wish my parents were like you !, 
  they used to bundle me up in unnecessary layers of clothes . 
  to this day , i still have a phobia when clothes shopping - overheated clothes shops during winter are real life nightmares . 
  i have a z1 compact and i always come back to the stock launcher . 
  the app drawer is just so practical . 
  nope . 
  i never floss and tried it . 
  it does n't have any smell . 
  it 's too thin to even carry it . 
  never said that , i just said that bullying is disturbing . 
  i am not interested in making floss work . 
  it 's unnecessary . 
  nobody is doubting it 's within our capability . 
  that does n't make it right . 
  i am waiting to have a steady income and this will be my new hobby . 
  no , they will be just fine since there is evidence flossing is not important . 
  i am not going to provide that evidence . 
  i just love how it gets better and better . 
  do n't you love how awesome youtube is at detecting copyrighted material ? 
  i am so happy i do n't encounter these types of turns . 
  this would definitely make me road rage . 
  maybe try selecting the song and press the delete button on your keyboard . 
  it works for me and is easier . 
  how is the driver 's education in canada ? 
  so there are no mandatory driving lessons with instructors ? 
  i never even thought of that but now i realize that i 've always hated the feeling of having something on my fingers ... this will be a problem . 
  i am no evidence provider . 
  you 're the one making the claim that something must be done , the burden of proof is yours . 
  that 's ... insane . 
  i know i am biased because in my country this is mandatory : examination by a doctor , then you pay for 28 hours of driving lessons with an instructor ( over the span of several months ) + most driving schools have semi-mandatory theory lessons . 
  at the end there is a theory and a driving test , which sometimes includes describing the symbols on your car 's dashboard , opening the hood of the car and describing oil exchange etc. 
  how can anyone get a license without that is beyond me . 
  i 'm guessing this post is downvoted because somebody thought it was n't exciting enough . 
  or , you know , drive at an appropriate speed . 
  that might be the case but to be fair , most dashcammers do . 
  it was mentioned elsewhere in the thread . 
  and you have it wrong . 
  if you claim that flossing is necessary ( that is the claim ) , the burden of proof is yours . 
  it is a claim saying that something extra should be done , that 's why it needs proof . 
  you 're hiding behind a `` joke '' because you can see you 're wrong . 
  it might 've been a joke , but you used that joke to belittle me when you thought you were right . 
  you make me sick . 
  people like you make the world a worse place than it has to be . 
  why would you talk to another human being like that ? 
  do n't you have any decency ? 
  is empathy even a thing in your life ? 
  why do you lash out at people like that ? 
  please seek help as soon as possible otherwise it is going to get worse . 
  your dentist was wrong . 
  mine never even mentioned it . 
  [ educate yourself ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3laaxg/eli5_why_is_it_that_we_have_to_brush_our_teeth_in/cv4owi7 ) before you start making ridiculous claims . 
  first you claim it was just a joke , then you start arguing . 
  what is it then ? 
  you 're ridiculous . 
  read the whole thing , do n't cherry-pick the only small bit that does n't even support your claim . 
  wikipedia is a reliable source and you even decided to overlook the sources provided for the article . 
  pathetic . 
  you 're the one who clearly does n't have a clue . 
  thousands of your made up studies do n't count . 
  you just can not accept the truth that what you 've been doing your entire life is meaningless . 
  do me a favour and think about your life choices . 
  you 're going to regret this behaviour one day and it will be too late . 
  take this advice and you 'll thank me one day . 
  make sure to message me when you 're ready . 
  i have but i ca n't use it for free like spotify . 
  maybe they could finally stop restricting who sees the recommended playlists . 
  yeah but my country is n't supported . 
  sucks to be born in a 666th world country . 
  you can speak your mind as you want , just do n't expect anyone to think you 're not mentally ill . 
  the anti-political correctness . 
  those people love to say how oppressed they feel by not being able to be assholes without consequences . 
  except , you know , it barely even happens . 
  all this `` pc '' bullshit is basically nonexistent . 
   when i was 6 i rode my bike to school, 
  therefore , everyone ? 
  i do n't follow . 
  you are the example of the whole population ? 
  well , not that is has anything to do with it but the stereotype about them is actually the opposite . 
  they have a bad reputation in other countries , especially truckers . 
  somebody forgot they 're not in the euro truck simulator . 
  it 's bullying . 
  not `` bullying '' . 
  you 're shaking in childish anger because someone called you out on being a bully . 
  if a complete stranger told you to kill yourself would you laugh ? 
  the first is completely understandable . 
  the second is fine , the school can choose . 
  the third is just an idiot . 
  i am missing context to the fourth . 
  the fifth example is also understandable , keep faith to yourself . 
  there is no pc apocalypse . 
  uhhhh ... 
  you really think digging through anyone 's history is going to end up differently ? 
  take a look at your own before you criticize . 
  apple juice usually mixed with water . 
  i unfollowed or unfriended some people , started following some reasonable people ( mostly journalists and politicians ) and now i like visiting facebook . 
  quite often but i usually keep it to myself or went on reddit ( that counts as keeping it to myself , you 're not real guys ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ fun ^ ^ ^ arguing ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ are ^ ^ ^ offended ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ someone ^ ^ ^ getting ^ ^ ^ offended . 
  nope . 
  no drugs please .
