  the ones i found are 220ml/330kcal . 
  i think i 'm going to try these to lose weight . 
  3-4 / day should be enough . 
  keeping up with the kardashians . 
  it 's fun . 
  i wish i could do that but my roommate almost never leaves the room . 
  done , surveys are fun . 
  i usually do n't like those that make me write but this one actually made me think which is probably the reason why i did n't close the tab . 
  for non-americans it 's not so hard to decide . 
  we do n't get any of the paid youtube stuff . 
  also no album art for music in my library . 
  and even if i create a playlist on my phone it does n't show up . 
  this shit is so stupid . 
  the woosh shit . 
  if they had iphones nobody would even notice because everyone is used to apple doing it . 
  what does that have to do with what i said ? 
  how did this comment get downvoted so much , when it 's defending the same thing in the second most upvoted one ? 
  it wo n't add anything to your music . 
  yes , there even is a subreddit for that / r/amplaylists but it seems to be ignored by people in this one . 
  here 's how i add music :, 
  first i create a copy of the files because i do n't want itunes to be messing with the originals . 
  drag and drop in itunes , then click file -  library -  update library . 
  wait for it to upload . 
  during upload it shows dashed clouds next to your songs . 
  after the upload ( check the upper right corner of itunes ) those clouds disappear . 
  then i right click the album art and select the option to delete the local copy . 
  after that the regular cloud appears next to the songs and all is well . 
  true , i do it because if i move or delete the files itunes then gives me an error about missing files before it plays the song . 
  no , i 'm pretty sure i do n't want to use that . 
  i expect it would scan for my local files and try to do stuff to it . 
  i do n't want that . 
  oh this is beautiful . 
  i 'm not op but thank you !, 
  i do n't want that , i have most of my music on an external harddrive . 
  you belong to prison . 
  well , google music and apple music have everything you upload . 
  not really , it has most of the music other services have . 
  but i would n't recommend using it , because when something becomes unavailable , google does n't tell you . 
  it just disappears from your library and playlists to never be recovered again . 
  in itunes you can change it yourself . 
  no , only the music you added from their catalogue . 
  maybe if some of your songs were matched , but definitely not those you uploaded . 
  no , only those you added from their catalogue . 
  i 'm talking about the streaming service . 
  spotify only greys them out . 
  in the settings you can set them to be visible . 
  yes . 
  google play music is the name of the subscription service . 
  sounds like a line from family guy . 
  that 's completely irrelevant . 
  i posted this to point out a problem with a specific streaming service . 
  buying music is offtopic here . 
  not really , all i need them to do is let the music in my library but do n't let me to play it ( just like other services do it ) . 
  i 'm not talking about getting a notification about every single piece of music in their catalogue , only the music i have in my library . 
  quality is the same as 320kbps mp3s or the quality of music purchased in itunes . 
  i 'm fine with that . 
  it 's the convenience that makes us use streaming services . 
  it 's more practical than finding a device that can store hundreds of gigabytes of music i currently have . 
  no it does n't . 
  in the settings you can make unavailable music visible . 
  it 's not the same service . 
  you can buy music from the play store , not the streaming service . 
  and i never said anything about wanting to own music , and most people who use streaming services do n't need it either . 
  apple manages just fine . 
  and by the way , spotify has it enabled by default . 
  i am moving to apple music . 
  lets me upload my music and shows unavailable music . 
  that 's enough for me . 
  or , you know , you can use the free version of google music that only lets you upload your own 50k tracks and does n't mess with them . 
  why exactly are you comparing an app to play local music files to a streaming service ? 
  no , i just figured they must 've disabled it accidentally . 
  i 've been a spotify subscriber for some time and i remember turning it off because i did n't want to see how much music was missing . 
  no , you purchase the music from the google play store . 
  it does n't contradict anything . 
  i disabled it in spotify ** years ago ** when i did n't want to see it . 
  ** now i do ** . 
  i am ** not ** a spotify subscriber , i never said that , i said i ** used to be ** . 
  hope it 's understandable now for the simple-minded . 
  i solve it the same way . 
  the catch is , you ca n't know what got deleted since it just disappears . 
  that 's the whole point of the post . 
  exactly , you had * a few * songs mismatched . 
  that happens . 
  you still can upload the music without tags and then retag it in itunes . 
  same thing in google music . 
  you know , you can still use it and not lose any of your music . 
  if you have mp3s , you can upload them to google music for free ( 50k limit ) and they do n't mess with it . 
  you get the streaming experience and keep your music . 
  it would make sense to block me from accessing it and say ` you 've been banned ' instead . 
  google music = google play music - the streaming service . 
  not to be confused with the google play store where you buy music . 
  they grey out music that became unavailable . 
  i 'm fine with that . 
  not really , both would be good . 
  first i downvoted you because you did n't answer my question . 
  then you downvoted my answer . 
  now i just copy your behaviour . 
  apple music !, 
  the one i 'm using right now . 
  they wo n't fix this , it 's been like this from the start .
