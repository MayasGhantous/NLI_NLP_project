  and there 's no point in discovering new music when it may be gone any time without warning . 
  my downvote was justified because you did n't answer my question . 
  then you downvoted because i triggered you . 
  yeah , that 's the streaming service , except it does n't change the fact that you do n't buy music there . 
  i know this . 
  and it 's 50k not 10 . 
  that 's what you should do when you do n't understand something , disregard it . 
  i did n't mention the store at all . 
  apple music . 
  you know what we 're supposed to do with comments that do n't contribute to the discussion . 
  yours is one of them . 
  yeah , me too . 
  just saying i never mentioned the store . 
  no it does n't . 
  you buy music in a section of the google play store . 
  you stream music from google play music . 
  i 'm ugly sure they did n't . 
  those comments are ridiculous . 
  why is it so hard for some to figure out that just because you buy it from the google play store does n't mean you ca n't do it on an apple device ? 
  why do so many people have the need to spread misinformation ? 
  this is not true . 
  spotify and apple music both show unavailable music in your library . 
  why are you lying ? 
  what do you gain by lying ? 
  no they do n't . 
  i 've had music greyed out and it did n't disappear . 
  you can in apple music . 
  or , you know , stop being a bitch about other people supporting artists in other legit ways . 
  i 've used spotify years ago and it already had the functionality . 
  maybe you 're talking about the period when it was only available in sweden ? 
  you purchased them in the google play ** store ** and are playing them in the google play ** music ** . 
  they probably see i 'm being downvoted and just do it too for the sake of it . 
  some people think a downvoted comment is automatically wrong , but i 've seen some of my comments go from heavily upvoted to heavily downvoted . 
  if we could see the numbers it would show . 
  yes , legit . 
  if the musician is n't getting paid , it 's the label 's fault . 
  they are getting the money , they just do n't give it to the artists . 
   music that you are getting from the subscription listening service ? 
  you must be kidding . 
  i was n't saying music is n't being removed from other services , i said ** some services have a way to let you know what got removed ** . 
  wow . 
  i said, 
   no , you purchase the music from the google play store . 
  and you said, 
   the branding here says otherwise . 
  and provided a picture that proved ** me ** right . 
  why are you saying that the brading says otherwise when it ** does n't ** ? 
  no you do n't buy music there . 
  when you click ` buy ' it takes you to the google play store , then it adds the music to you library in google play music . 
  yeah , lots of my comments here have it . 
  i did n't say what you purchase is n't part of your collection . 
  it becomes part of your collection after you buy it in the google play store . 
  oh my god . 
  people in this thread will say the most stupid shit just to have the feeling of being right . 
  i specified i meant streaming music when i put google music in the title . 
  that 's the name of the streaming service , therefore i was talking about music added from the streaming service . 
  music you upload can not become unavailable . 
  think about it for a second , please . 
  they ca n't delete files you uploaded . 
  other streaming services do remove music as well , but * do it in a way that lets you notice * . 
  no , you 're wrong . 
  you should n't worry about your music disappearing just because * it is expected * . 
  that 's like saying do n't put money to the bank , store them under you pillow . 
  bandwagon downvoting . 
  no , they just have the courtesy to leave it in your library and playlists so you can upload it yourself . 
  if you pay for the streaming service it plays the music you add from it . 
  that 's what this thread is about . 
  the streaming service . 
  yes . 
  why did n't you make the same comment when i made a post about google music ? 
  lol i 'm 14 too this is so funny, 
  people are just angry that i 'm right . 
  no , the purpose of streaming services is also replacing your collection . 
  you are not everyone . 
  spotify and apple music do that . 
  no , it 's not theft when streaming music gets pulled by the label , you sign up knowing that and agreeing to that . 
  they were n't walking about music they purchased . 
  that music stays . 
  that 's completely different . 
  netflix does n't advertise to have most of the current and popular movies . 
  i 'm glad that i can at least see what got taken down in some services . 
  still better than confusingly searching for a favourite song that just disappeared . 
  it does n't work for me and there is no sd card option . 
  still beta though . 
  most people do n't have marshmallow and wo n't for a long time . 
  i signed up for that music might get pulled . 
  it 's a common courtesy to not be shady about it . 
  and considering that some services let you know , what 's the problem ? 
  your impression is wrong , that 's not what i 'm thinking . 
  i know i do n't own the music , they advertise they will have it . 
  netflix is known to have movies on rotation because you do n't need them all the time - you do n't watch movies regularly . 
  i 'm sorry for you , really . 
  try to read what you sign up for instead of telling people what they did when you know nothing about it . 
  yeah , play with words . 
  ` my music ' is the library you have with saved music . 
  i know it 's hard to be 14 but at least try . 
   google play music all access, 
  shortly goole play music . 
  when i said my music , i did n't claim ownership . 
  when i say my hometown , i do n't own the fucking town .
