  i know , but that means the music has to be on the same spot on my external hdd which has to be always connected . 
  and the music is not integrated with the spotify catalogue . 
  i have too much music to use spotify this way . 
  that is too inconvenient . 
  if other services do it , why not spotify ? 
  sounds delicious , thanks for the recommendation . 
  although i must say i do n't have much space in my room and buying many ingredients would mean i would have to share my bed with them , 
  i wish it rather showed which songs i 've hearted . 
  or does the ios version do that ? 
  i know , i already have such a playlist . 
  but sometimes i 'm looking at an album and i want to know which songs from the album i 've hearted and creating a smart playlist for every album is a bit inconvenient . 
  is n't the point of spotify the convenience of not having to store the music and manually syncing/copying ? 
  the reason why i use * streaming * services is because they let me stream and if i need it download music . 
  local files have to be manually transferred and you need two devices running at the same time to get it working . 
  that 's not a solution , that 's a very inconvenient workaround . 
  it 's pretty obvious . 
  yep . 
  i actually have two of them at the ceiling in my shower . 
  watched markers should be everywhere , and on desktop too . 
  oh god , what a name . 
  i was obsessed with this guy . 
  my first crush . 
  they keep getting more and more gorgeous every year . 
  never said a word about people who are too tired though . 
  why not both ? 
  do n't worry , you wo n't grow braces . 
  source : went through puberty . 
  ah , a ` statistics guy ' is always needed . 
  especially when it comes to muslims and black people . 
  south park looks like it got taken over by / r/tumblrinaction though . 
  there are subreddits like that , but usually are much smaller . 
  for example there is no subreddit to discuss mainstream music ( maybe mainstream hip hop on / r/hiphopheads ) . 
  the sound mixing of this video is terrible . 
  just like amy schumer . 
  why 20/80 ? 
  the other driver reacted the same way . 
  only a child gets provoked like that . 
  i think i 've seen all of the car brands generalized like this on this subreddit . 
  seriously , if you see any car there probably is a stereotype about it . 
  it was a non issue before he forced himself in front of the the white car . 
  that 's not what the post is about - i was talking about sharing someone else 's link with their commentary . 
  i am the same as you actually . 
  i used to take a train to school twice a week , changing trains two times . 
  i always had to check what station i 'm at , what station i 'm supposed to get off the train ... nights were the worst . 
  it still only shares the link . 
  i 'm not blind you know , i can see there are more options . 
  we can only hope . 
  living in a country where manual is the standard is pretty fucking annoying . 
  my problem is not with sharing a link and adding my own commentary ( which is what you 're showing me ) , but sharing a link that has * other people 's * commentary . 
  i 've said that * several times * and it 's in the main post too . 
  you just did n't bother reading it . 
  the title and the first two senteces were there when i submitted it . 
  i only added the example after your first comment . 
  you were unable to think , which resulted in you misunderstanding the issue * even after i provided the example * . 
  pro tip : do n't do this if you no one talks to you irl . 
  just ignore him , he posts in / r/conservative . 
  yep , i absolutely agree . 
  as someone who likes building a big library of music , apple music is great . 
  it 's always easy to attack the minority . 
  this is a never ending cycle . 
  thanks for spreading your agenda op . 
  do n't forget to cross post to every subreddit there is like you do with every anti-refugee post . 
  i grew up in a small town where , if you were listening to anything but rock or metal , you would get laughed at ( by other kids ) . 
  so i hid my love for hip hop and techno ( not that i would n't listen to rock , it just was n't the only thing i would listen to ) . 
  i still , even in private , could n't listen to any pop music , because it made me embarrassed . 
  it was n't until high school when i met new people who did n't grow up in a rural area and were n't embarrassed about their musical taste . 
  i only got the courage to listen to bieber couple months ago .

  also for [ insert any car brand ] . 
  thank god , another pt cruiser joke !, 
  ( joke ), 
  went against red , relying on it turning green before entering the intersection . 
  people like this vote too . 
  so funny, 
  stop it you , i ca n't stop laughing now !, 
  or maybe not . 
  and the cammer saves the day !, 
  or he does n't . 
  the reality is that the refugees are running from war and europeans do n't like brown people . 
  no wonder the biggest opponents of migration are countries that have the least amount of refugees . 
  the editing of the video is terrible . 
  not all of them . 
  that does n't mean we should treat them all as economic migrants . 
  you can expect anything you want , i prefer reality . 
  but ... 
  but ... there is no reason to drink bottled water !, 
  most politicians are corrupt anyway .
