  he knows what he needs to do . 
  that 's not healthy . 
  you should seek help . 
  this was very confusing because i find the guy on the left more attractive . 
  the cammer certainly did n't have to overreact like that . 
  always the cammer trying to be the hero , ending up being an asshole . 
  seriously , that was polite as fuck . 
  stop playing police and move on with your life . 
  what is wrong with people ? 
  why are you trying to create a conflict ? 
  just move on with you life . 
  i wish all those who talk about `` going with the flow of traffic '' took this advice . 
  i saw it on a laptop and still liked it . 
  [ so here it is . 
  ** kanye west - the life of pablo **, 
  if the album was released a month ago i would be thrilled . 
  i never really gave kanye 's earlier albums a good listen until then and my favorite album was probably yeezus . 
  but in the time of anticipation of tlop i listened through his whole discography and it turned me into the `` miss the old kanye '' type of guy . 
  i still really like tlop , but mostly i just listen to * father stretch my hands pt . 
  2 * , * famous * , * freestyle 4 * , * fml * , * real friends * , * wolves * ( i actually prefer the album version ) , * no more parties in la * , * facts * and * fade * . 
  the rest is not that appealing to me . 
  plus the kid on ulb kinda freaks me out , especially after seeing the video . 
  ** powerwolf - metallum nostrum **, 
  the bonus disc to this power metal band i discovered couple weeks ago . 
  it contains cover versions of famous metal songs ( i guess , i do n't know the originals much ) . 
  power metal is so awesome . 
  my favorite tracks are * conquistadores * and * edge of thorns * . 
  ** rotting christ - rituals **, 
  this greek black metal recently released this album and i 'm in love with ... the first song . 
  * in nomine dei nostri * sounds awesome , but the rest of the album is not very remarkable . 
  ** the witcher 3 ost **, 
  i had this playing in the background and it has almost 200 songs . 
  i did n't listen to all of them but it 's the reason why it ended up so high on my chart . 
  love the game , love the music . 
  ** ignore the album in the middle , it 's a. . . czech version of kidz bop i guess ? 
  some might call it guilty pleasure but i do n't feel guilty for liking it . 
  ** kanye west - the college dropout **, 
  as i mentioned above , this is the reason why i did n't enjoy tlop as much as i would some time ago . 
  totally in love with the album . 
  my favorites are * we do n't care * , * the new work out plan * , * slow jamz * , * school spirit * , * family business * , * last call * . 
  a power metal classic ( according to wiki ) . 
  it 's epic . 
  and the reason why i listen to the genre . 
  * primo victoria * and * wolfpack * are my favs . 
  ** kanye west - my beautiful dark twisted fantasy **, 
  i returned to this album after having it overplayed . 
  some songs still make me physically sick because i 've just heard them too many times . 
  i just do n't have the * power * to listen to them . 
  still loving * dark fantasy * , * all of the lights * , * hell of a life * and especially * see me now * . 
  ** king push -- darkest before dawn : the prelude **, 
  i 'm really looking forward to the new pusha t album because this was great . 
  * intro * , * m.f.t.r. 
  * and * f.i.f.a * are my favorites . 
  i swear some people are scared to slow down . 
  can you stop spreading this spam outside of / r/videos ? 
  that sub is unusable because of you people . 
  well luck and chance are not ` forces ' , they just descibe a situation or a set of conditions . 
  if you think of them as forces than it implies the supernatural . 
  it seems you do n't really want to know what it is called , you just want to bitch about it and chose the wrong subreddit . 
  fast-paced content is easier to consume . 
  some of the content creators know they would n't be able to keep your attention for long so they pack it like this . 
  some of those i watch do this and it can be quite annoying if you become aware of it ( most of the time i do n't ) . 
  why not just kill it ? 
  no , it 's all on my computer . 
  but i found out that even if i copy the files the game still fails to play maybe half of them even though it 's all mp3s . 
  i 'll just stick to playing the music in the background . 
  oh , i did n't know album art may cause problems . 
  almost all of my music has album art . 
  still problems . 
  nobody is going to notice , chris . 
  tbh when someone has a profile visible for public and lets strangers follow them i consider them a public figure , and if their posts are interesting i follow them . 
  i react the same way to porn sometimes . 
  it 's ok , i 'm 21 and i enjoyed deadpool too . 
  of course this smartass answer is the top comment . 
  oh , i actually read the comment wrong and thought it was suggesting to use the library . 
  my bad . 
  yes , but it seems less noticeable . 
  hard to say though , sometimes it does n't happen for 1-2 hours and sometimes it 's there every couple of seconds . 
  too bad he did n't . 
  typical audi driver . 
  right , that sounds like a solution . 
  i might try that . 
  ah , the anti-kardashian butthurts are strong in this thread . 
  you got ta be keeping up , man . 
  i actually watch this show as a keeping up with the kardashians prequel . 
  that 's the reason why i even watch this show . 
  it 's just the asylum theme , these always make me feel uneasy . 
  i actually considered this as an option but i stopped watching like mid-season and it was at the time when it was airing . 
  i might have to watch the whole season again if i chose to do this . 
  it makes me uneasy because there are people held against their will and are being discriminated against based on their sexuality . 
  the way it 's portrayed makes me feel uneasy . 
  watching sane people being treated as insane is just something i do n't like . 
  i love horror movies and i do n't watch them to be scared . 
  i watch them either for the mystery ( most often ) , suspense or gore . 
  the fox and the hound . 
  'cause the feels . 
  postal . 
  you have n't seen the video of how the ` lashes ' look , right ? 
  i 'm not trying to excuse what they do but those lashes are n't what you think they are . 
  [ i think this is the video .
