  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4r_izrzylw ) i mean it probably starts to hurt after some time ... 
  yep , that 's the bad part . 
  they certainly do n't make you feel the same way . 
  they make you feel in a way that still lets you enjoy the show . 
  yeah , i was stuck with the literal definition some time ago too . 
  all those conspiracy videos on youtube make me sick now . 
  i listen to some racist and homophobic music because of the `` edginess '' and good melodies of the songs . 
  that 's probably the only thing i would actually call `` guilty '' pleasure . 
  i 'm not sure about it but i think the comment that originally introduced me to the video actually said they do it in more `` sessions '' . 
  `` who wants to be a dumb fuck atheist ? '', 
  i would probably win a toll free ride on the highway to hell . 
  / r/europe also known as / r/europeanlight or / r/refugeehate, 
  deadpool becomes james bond . 
  no , because i was wrongfully accused of shoplifting once and it made me very paranoid about looking like i 'm about to steal . 
  greg holden - boys in the street, 
  picture pronounced as `` pitcha '' . 
  means cunt in my language . 
  yeah i definitely do n't support them by buying their music , i do n't even know if anyone is selling that shit . 
  the witcher or metro 2033 . 
  hardcover because it 's more comfortable to read . 
  i only said i do n't like the theme of asylums . 
  i never said other things make me uneasy . 
  why would you think that ? 
  i 'm a huge horror fan and that 's why i 'm watching the series . 
  i would n't say that but i 'm currently watching all of their reality shows in the order they aired . 
  i 've never watched reality tv and this family is intriguing . 
  johnny rebel for the racist music and [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucgahjulv2i ) as an example of homophobic music . 
  edit : i just found out the homophobe is an atheist . 
  i do n't know why but that 's just funny .

   american crime story - i still see some polarizing thoughts on this show , particularly to people seeming `` over the top '' . 
  yet i still ask , did anyone consider that that is how these 90s hollywood elites actually behaved ? 
  i absolutely love this show . 
  it might be over the top but i do n't care , it 's so damn * entertaining * . 
  as someone who was n't around to watch this mess when it was happening i really like enjoying it as a tv show . 
  that 's probably my # 1 favorite show of all time . 
  the mysteries , the feels ... it was so good and waiting for a new episode was the worst . 
  i really want to watch this show but i do n't like watching movie/tv adaptations before reading the book it 's based on . 
  this one will be hard . 
  i do n't get it . 
  it has all the potential but fucks up so bad . 
  the first and the last episodes are probably the worst because of how cringey the story is and i know the original show was n't like that because i binge watched it for the first time like a year or two ago . 
  the `` funny '' episodes kinda sucked too but at least they were n't so over-the-top paranoid . 
  also it seemed weird how scully and mulder kinda `` did n't give a fuck '' about people disappearing and being killed all around them . 
  they seemed so disconnected from reality . 
  it was weird . 
  do n't ever even think about doing what the cammer did there . 
  what a fucking moron . 
  i do n't mind innocent people being tortured , i already said i 'm a horror fan . 
  people being held against their will in an asylum is way worse in my opinion than when they are being skinned alive or raped . 
  the psychological terror is worse . 
  like in the funny games . 
  to give you perspective - the purge is one of the movies that makes me feel the most uneasy and i 'm never going to watch it . 
  just knowing the plot makes me sick . 
  nothing , really . 
  i just do n't have anything to comfort myself with anymore . 
  maybe the thought that i 'm going to be a normal weight one day ? 
  so if you have n't seen it then it 's rare , right ? 
   serbian film is very disturbing but literally only to be disturbing . 
  it 's a terrible movie . 
  it 's definitely not terrible . 
  just because we do n't like what was happening in the movie does n't mean we have to say it was a bad movie . 
  it 's my parents ' tv . 
  if it ever happens to them when i 'm not around they will have to reboot it by unplugging it from the wall ... damn smart tvs . 
  i think it was the 2007 us version . 
  yes , definitely this . 
  they will talk at you constantly and give you bad advice about driving . 
  especially the experienced ones . 
  some say the us need a wake up call and that trump could be just that . 
  hobbies do n't have to be productive you idiot . 
  almost none of them are . 
  killing yourself is too much work . 
  wait , are you talking about the ` bae caught me sleeping ' meme as ` baegate ' or a different pronunciation of the word baguette ? 
  oh this guy . 
  dude there are like 4 major streaming services and then there are the minor ones . 
  i think that 's plenty . 
  i think i agree that the market is n't saturated , but that 's not because there are n't enough streaming services , but because most people still prefer other ways of listening to their music . 
  there is just no reason for another streaming service unless it 's extremely revolutionary or has significantly greater selection of music . 
  well , i kinda understand him , i also sometimes like to defend the underdog just for the sake of it . 
  sometimes it just feels right . 
  it just does n't feel right with tidal for me . 
  yeah , every normal human being will let off the gas when someone is trying to overtake . 
  ah , then it ca n't be a repost . 
  hey everyone , next time ask this guy , he gets to decide what is a repost and what is n't !, 
  this is 1st grade blue balling . 
  that was very satisfying to watch . 
  but ... but ... it 's a bmw !, 
  are n't you actually supposed to avoid braking while turning ? 
  nah , you 're actually not supposed to brake while turning . 
   actual foreign language, 
  i know damn well what he 's talking about . 
  my mother and her family are like that . 
  for them , conversation is full of talking over each other , interrupting each other , trying to talk louder than the other person ... and it 's something they all do so it seems normal to them . 
  it 's fucking impossible for me to have a conversation with such people because i 'm not going to do that . 
  if someone starts talking over me i shut up and let them finish . 
  except they are the ones making a negative assumption . 
  do n't make assumptions if you do n't know . 
  reminds me of [ george carlin .
