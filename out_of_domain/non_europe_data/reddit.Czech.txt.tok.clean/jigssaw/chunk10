  i am using oooold scythe ninja 3 ( weighs more than 1kg :d beast of a cooler ) with the same cpu ( used to cool my phenom ii x4 aswell ) and it does the job great ... and i have to give props to guys at scythe - after like 3years the fan broke ( actually i later found it just needed some oil ... - stupid me ) so i emailed them where can i order a replacement and they just send me one for free !!!, 
  btw : when it comes to budget for that keep in mind that the same cpu cooler can work through many updates and different builds so it is perfectly worth it to pay a little bit more . 
  i would propably get 8320 - its more future proof - with both consoles having 8core cpus games are becoming more and more multithreaded , same way with other software - 8320 can only get better :-), 
  in some workloads 8350 can even keep up with i7 - that is pretty damn impressive for a cpu from 2012 . 
  but if you are building new pc from scratch . 
  its kinda hard to recomend fx cpus ... 
  i would n't even care that much about how the chipset is old ( it still delivers everything i need ) but the inability to upgrade it further is a shame :-(, 
  btw : i am running 8350 . 
  my gripes :, 
  wd greens suck, 
  16gb of memory isnt needed in second build - 2x4 is enough and then you can add more later if you feel like it . 
  imho @ 4k crossfire 290/290x  970 sli - xdma crossfire is miles ahead of nvidia solution lot less microstutering thanks to framepacing , better scaling ; and 290/290x get better at 4k . 
  only downside is that they produce little bit more heat ... but to hell with that we are enthusiast :-) also crossfire boards tend to be cheaper than sli boards because nvidia wants money for sli certification . 
  single card @ 1080p is different story though,

  people are putting high end gpus into htpcs ? 
  ... ok :d why not just steam-stream your games from the better machine ? 
  agreed, 
  what does the k stand for ? 
  well x80 is ussualy the high end model and i would be kinda dissapointed if the higend nextgen model would be meant for 1080p ... 
  i would expect 1440p atleast :-), 
  pc is stationary hw - its everybit worth it to just run a cable to it . 
  overall pcie  usb but pcie has potential disadvantage - youll bhe stuck with antenas in the back of your case - which is huge metal object that naturally blocks signal . 
  depends on the tower and router placement . 
  i remember playing cs 1.6 on a server which had healthpacks as a mod ... it also had parachutes !, 
  that is not actually correct . 
  it largely depends on workloads you are running ... yes the difference might be negligible in games but - there are noticable differences in winrar , handbrake , adobe premiere and other general computing applications ( @ 4-5 % ) . 
  and there is very little difference in price between single and dualchannel memory - so yeah i would rather spend a dollar or so more on two sticks which will not be noticable in the overall price of the computer . 
  well yes i agree ... but why would you buy a dualslot board ? 
  ... two reasons for that :, 
   form factor ( miniitx/matx ), 
   getting something on the cheap ( like lets say am1 platform ) ... 
  in those cases of course the few % you sacrifice is worth it for convinience . 
  but when building proper pc - dualchannel is worth it . 
  depends on your budget . 
  just few notes :, 
  pay special attention to sound equipment if you do n't have dedicated dac . 
  is the software you are using opencl/cuda accelerated ? 
  if yes choose gpu ( amd/nvidia ) accordingly if not just get one that is better bang for your buck in that budget category . 
  cpu - if choosing between i5 / fx 8350 or i3/fx6300 get the amd part it has more multithreaded performance which is what you want for editing . 
  there is no such think as good and 720p ... 
  if you want cheap screen get 4:3 1280x1024 panel . 
  even the 16:9 / 16:10 computer screens are ussualy either 1440 or 1600 vertical, 
  2x r9 290 is best option in that budget.those cards only get better at higher resolutions and xdma crossfire with framepacing gets rid of framestutter . 
  but it might be benefitial to wait till early next year amd might be showing off some great new gpus with hbm technology . 
  i would just get the corsair one ... 
  if sligthly better looks or maybe very slightly better build quality is worth twice as much then go for it . 
  i would ` nt even be against buldiong inside the cheapest case you can buy that looks good and has some front vents - i 've done that and they work .

  i 'd build something like this . 
  if your editing software is cuda accelerated ( and not opencl ) change the gpu for nvidia ) . 
  this leaves you + -100 $ to spend on soundcard or dac ( board has optical output ) . 
  but i do n't know enough about audio to recomend any . 
  well that makes things considerably harder ... you can propably forget about analytic sound reproduction from a laptop - no place to stick a proper soundcard . 
  you 're gon na be making a lot of compromises with a laptop - quite honestly i would rather get a 800 $ pc and a 200 $ hp stream for carrying around ... 
  working on a laptop sucks and you pay a lot of premium for processing power . 
  also you have smaller screen in a laptop which sucks for productivity . 
  - if you totally need to be working on the move all the time then i guess you need laptop but otherwise i would n't recommernd one . 
  keep in mind that if you have good internet connection you can always use remote desktop and work on your workstation from outside of home :-), 
  r9 290 from sapphire can be had for like 250 $ and its a steal ... 
  i would say best bang for your buck . 
  r9 290x can be had for little more than 300 and gtx970 for 330-350 $ both are slightly better . 
  you can also wait for nvidia 960 or early next year amd is gon na unveil new gpus with hbm which should be a game changer . 
  what is your cpu ? 
  what is your current system power consumption ? 
  you need new cpu and therefore new mobo . 
  gpu is fast enough for now ( its the equivalent of r9 280 ) . 
  also keep in mind that skyrim is horribly optimazed and needs lot of single core performance so its is understandable it runs like ass - but some newer games might work just fine even with that old cpu . 
  edit : i take it back the cpu is too old ... even the budget 860k from amd has like 80 % more performance ( passmark ) . 
  so yeah you need to replace it . 
  nope only if its a really crappy psu ... 
  yep either get and i5 or fx6300 depending on his budget ... or he might even get away with 860k / the new pentium if 30fps is all he needs . 
  imho r9 280/285 is the maximum reasonable gpu i would buy before upgrading your cpu - youll see bottlenecking otherwise . 
  i 'd say 600 $ -700 $ is the sweet spot . 
  when building on really tight budget you can also look for used parts -, 
  things like ram ussualy works forever ( thats why they put lifetime warranty on it :-) ) . 
  used sandy bridge i5 can also be had for pretty cheap . 
  the same with mobo . 
  used gpu might also be good idea ( i 'd stick with nvidia though if buying used cause of the mining craze ) - but what the hell am i saying i am running 7970ghz edition which i bought used :-) and works like a charm . 
  case is essentialy just a hunk of steel that will last decades so you can get used one too . 
  do n't buy used storage and psu though . 
  but keep in mind ... smaller native res means lower gpu requirements :-) :d, 
  r9 270x or r9 280 if you can spare few buck more, 
  that gpu does n't need upgrade yet ... . . like seriously he asked for 30 fps . 
  r9 280 ( hd 7950 ) will run everything @ 1080p high at 60fps .
