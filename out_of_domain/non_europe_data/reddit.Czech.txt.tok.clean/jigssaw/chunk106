   if you are not , then everything you said was very silly . 
  fine and prosperous example of country leaving eu paints a clear path for other countries to follow from the ever tightening union . 
  remember all those concentration camp guards ? 
  they lost their jobs aswell when the war was over . 
  the card is better ) performance than r9 290x and its nipping at the heels of 980 and 390x, 
  they claim the card is better performance than r9 290x and nipping at heels of 390x and 980 . 
  however there are still rumours that the sites still do n't have the final launch drivers which could make the cards bit better . 
  ddworld.cz publiched a preview for the card few days ago where they said that the cooler performance is very good and quiet ( and is in absolutely different leage compared to stock 290x cooler ) . 
  they also claimed non reference card will be coming mid july ( with 460 and 470 ), 
  nope he says that rx460 and rx470 will be comming mid july and that they might be non-reference right away ( but that they do n't know for sure yet ), 
  eh yes and no . 
  in most of the preview he is comparing it to a stock 290x which they have to test . 
  but there is a part where he talks about his own personal oc model of 290x ( doesnt specify which one ) - and he says that he would swap those cards in a instant . 
  he also compares it in 3x 1920x1200 eyefinity which he uses in his personal rig - and he claims that 480 is better in some games . 
  ( =  not all ), 
  it might mean that they are on par in some or 480 loses some vs oc 290x ... however it could also just mean that 480 doesnt scale as well at higher resolutions ( posibly due to 32rops ? 
  since its a preview for a reference card review it would make sense that he is talking about that . 
  i am in the same camp god damn it :d, 
  well loudness is subjective so i am definitely waiting for a proper review with db measurement comparison :-), 
  the difference i see is that before those were rumours - since he clearly has the card and clearly is making a review i think we can safely assume that what he says is legit info and not just some rumour . 
  what he said doesnt contradict itself at all . 
  390x has higher clocks , faster memory and better power management than 290x =  390x is faster than 290x, 
  well it means that we can expect the performance inbetween 290x and 390x . 
  where as there were some leaks that put it at nano levels . 
  maybe he did . 
  no idea . 
  well this is a preview for a review which comes at 29th ( which would make no sense if he was held not held by nda ) . 
  she said that about rx480 not about 470 / 460 as far as i know . 
  yup seems fishy . 
  either he got special ok from amd . 
  or something got lost in translation about what preview meant and he just broke the nda . 
  if you actually sold you could have had a free upgrade . 
  but to each his own i guess . 
  - not everywhere in the world, 
  - only the reference model which had really crap loud cooler, 
  - `` in sales '', 
  this was the best of someones ability ... let that sink in . 
  because feminism . 
  she did n't speak up because it was the man 's fault ... lel, 
  i love all these intricate reasons for show characters action ... sorry m8 it made sense in the first few seasons where they followed books ... now they just make shit up and the reason for 95 % of questions like this is simply - plothole or character is stupid . 
  so dice gets shit for going away from realism to create more fun gameplay but they also get shit from staying true to realism because feminism . 
  make up your mind reddit . 
  according to ddworld.cz they will come mid june alongside aftermarket 480s, 
  yes i did . 
  the advantage is that dp has smaller connector - i.e. 
  smaller obstruction on the the back of the card ( propably makes a little tiny bit of difference for blower cards . ), 
  well because lot of people still own dvi monitors . 
  dp is better but for 1080p screens without freesync / hdr they are pretty much functionaly the same . 
  it will take a long time to phase it out ( shit until recently vga was present ( although through adapter ) on most gpus and on almsot every mobo . 
  i guess g2a should spend some of that money to hire a pr firm so they could explain to you what the fuck a marketplace means . 
  this g2a hate is ridicilous af . 
  and if devs ca n't even have a system to protect themselves from chargeback then its their own fucking fault . 
  thats like having your home broken in 20 times and still not getting a fucking security cam . 
  if you still have the mice then its pretty cheap and easy to repair them ( alrwady did it twice on my deathadder ) . 
  drm has nothing to do with it . 
  if they sold keys with and somebody payed with stolen credit card and the money is then returned through chargeback then they should simply make the key inactive - for example delete the sold copy from steam or whatever . 
  martells are dead . 
   2 x 480  1 x 1080 from the computex event . 
  now , gtx 980s in sli are not better than a single 1080 , so it 's fair to assume that 480  980 or at the very least 480 = 980 . 
  no sorry sli is totally irellevant . 
  the only reason why 2x980 arent better than 1080 is because sli truly sucks . 
  if amd can make multi-gpu work properly then kudos for them, 
  eh i am sorry but this was the way it always was . 
  only this year nvidia chose to release benchmarks early . 
  if amd did this it would have been called paper launch . 
  keep in mind the 4gb version uses slower gddr5 so it will be little bit slower . 
  ( atleast the reference one ), 
  its funny how a slight change can affect the looks of a card - the sapphire looks actually pretty sick compared to the older photos with silver cooler - that looked shite . 
  i am happy i do n't have this problem since i do n't like the looks of msi and asus cards ... they look like they are designed for 13 years old male audience . 
  devils advocate - not all cases are like that - my case for instance has the mobo mounted `` backwards '' so i am looking at the top of my gpu . 
  ( - so i do n't need to pay extra for backplate :d ), 
  its a small case i 'd say you 'd be safer with a blower . 
  imho the price will fall down - its priced this way so retailers can get rid of their older 380s 960s and so on . 
  dx 11 its around 970 , dx 12 around 980 . 
  i do n't think you are gon na get many more aaa dx11 games . 
  eh how many more dx11 aaa games are you gon na play ? ... 
  how many more are comming ? 
  well the card is perfectly sufficient to play gta ... 
  not a big deal for me - my screens support dp aswell - however i currently use 1hdmi and one dvi-d and the cables are made nice and tidy so if i bought a card without dvi i would have to redo the cabliong - and i wanted to buy a sapphire card anyway so yeah :-), 
   according to the picture , this button is responsible for switching led illumination into different modes ... . 
  however , i 'm quite certain that it does have a complete off state , as it was revealed during sapphire nation podcast . 
  really ? 
  get your shit together pls . 
  this rgb bullshit has to stop . 
  not everyone wants their pc to look like a god damn christmass tree . 
  oh yes i did . 
  lol sorry i feel stupid . 
  oh yes i read it wrong . 
  lol sorry i feel stupid . 
   gpu sag fixed by just putting a book underneath, 
  that screams fire hazard . 
  ** hd 5770 ** - very happy with it . 
  it run everything fine until i upgraded my screen to 1080p . 
  decided to buy ** hd 6770 ** ( the same gpu ) and ** crossfire ** it . 
  although many would argue that it was stupid ( and propably was as by the time the hd6 edition was being replaced ) i had an okay experience - the games i played ussually scaled pretty damn well and overall i was happy with it . 
  later i sold both cards and upgraded to ** 7970ghz ** edition ( got it second hand for nice price - it was bit after 290x came out ) . 
  this card was really amazing . 
  i sold it just recently because i did n't wanted it to lose all its value after polaris launch . 
  ** gt 610 ** - card i got for my htpc . 
  the gpu runs reasonably well .
