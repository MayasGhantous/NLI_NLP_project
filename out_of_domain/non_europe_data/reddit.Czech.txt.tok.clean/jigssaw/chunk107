  however i was very unhappy because the card is loud af and the fan ca n't be regulated by any software means ( even through hardware means - running the fan on lower voltage it is not satisfactory ) . 
  i jerry rigged a bigger fan to it and now its ok . 
  ** gt 630 ( kepler + - = = gt730 ) ** - bought it really cheap as a replacement for my 7970ghz and to hold me over until polaris . 
  currently running the card - works okay for what it is . 
  i use it to play cs : go @ 1024x768 . 
  later i will move it to my htpc as the card is passivelly cooled ( i even overclocked it a bit . ), 
  and now i am waiting for aftermarket 480 . 
  the gpu runs cooler and more quiet than my gigabyte 7970ghz edition with triple fan cooler . 
  so you are talking bs .

   ( 4gb cards are literally just the 8gb flashed to have 4gb , so they were basically considering dropping production of the 4gb version until they were convinced otherwise ) . 
  what ? 
  no they are n't they use different memory chips - 4gb of 7gbps gddr5 vs 8gb of gddr5 8gbps . 
  the bios thing was made for reviewers so they could just send one card instead of two to test . 
  the customer loses if he doesnt pay tax ? 
  what ? 
  i 'd assume the issue in smaller countries that have the higher prices simply has to do with lower amount of items sold - i.e. 
  it will take little bit longer to sell their old stock ( cards like 380x , 390 ) and then they can drop the price . 
  well as far as i know amd just sells the gpu chip . 
  board partners choose what cards they manufacture . 
  and it would make sense that at the beginning when there is high demand and low supply ( meaning they will propably sell every one they make ) that they make the one with higher margins . 
  i assume that when the demand gets little bit lower they will make more 4gb cards . 
  eh 480 4gb could still be a pretty damn good deal vs aftermarket 8gb card - depending on the price though . 
  its plenty quiet for most people . 
  plot twist - `` decline free offer '' just means you get charged . 
  the upgrade comes regardles . 
  you want a gpu right now - that is a reason . 
  the only way this could be a problem is if somebody has a really shitty old psu that doesnt even have the 6pin connector and uses those molex to 6pin adapters . 
  if it were a super budget card ( like 460/470 ) i 'd say i agree it should be made to default to that mode since it is likely that somebody would use it that way . 
  however since the 8gb version of 480 is 240 $ ( and the 200 $ 4gb 7gbps use less power and arent really a problem ) i do n't see them going in those shitty old builds . 
  as for tdp that is murky as tdp and power consumption arent the same thing . 
  ( i am not fan of this but both nvidia and amd do this - i 'd rather they state the average gaming power consumtpion ) . 
  maybe they should add a line to the manual saying - if you have a really shitty psu use the compatibility setting . 
  the only way i can see psu being a problem is that you are running like really old 350w/400w psu that doesnt even have 6pin and you are using molex to six pin adapter . 
  ( and sorry but i ca n't see anybody getting a 240 $ gpu in that kind of a system ), 
  if your lowend psu can handle 400w and has a six pin connector it has one rail and therefore can handle doing it just fine ( all 12v are connected together so if its going to molex/six pin/mobo doesnt matter - only the connectors are an issue ) . 
  so no . 
  psu isnt really the problem . 
  tdp of 150w ! = power consumption . 
  the original post was edited after my reply . 
  anyway you are correct . 
  it surely is misleading - but to play devils advocate they surely could find a bench or a game where it will be 150w ... 
  well amd on their own website claim that rx 480 has board power of 150w . 
  thank you . 
  eh am i the only one who thinks its rly overkill to put 3fan cooler on a + -150 w card ( rx480/gtx1060 ), 
  operating temperature is a conscious choice . 
  80 + c is perfectly safe temperature . 
  we are not in the am2 era anymore no need to get crazy and keep it < 60c, 
  my 15w apu is running at + -80 c ( passively cooled . ), 
  does it heat up my room ? 
  because operating temperature and heat output are two different things . 
  did you really think that just turning a fan faster on a gpu cooler can reduce heat output ? 
  it really depends on which games you choose to benchmark - i can easily make a benchmarking suite in which 480 destroys 980 ... 
  just use modern console optimized dx12 titles at 1080p and its done . 
  and that is why i am buying the card . 
  i am surely not gon na lose any sleep that its few fps slower in old dx11 titles that i already played / did n't like . 
  if you are n't on the government list you should be ashamed of yourself :-), 
  they won all pistol rounds ... let that sink in . 
  you can run cs : go on almost anything . 
  i 'd go for this and wait for rx 470 which should be around 150 $ ( and give around + -380 x performance at much lower power ) . 
  for all around much better build . 
  the release date is supposed to be in the second half of this month .

  do n't do that . 
  its not that it would combust ... it is that if something bad happens ( lets say - some part breaks , some capacitor pops , somethign throws few sparks , ide to sata connector melts ) your pc is sorounded by flamable material - it could potentionally start a fire . 
  in normal operation it should work ok . 
  better options that are essentially free :, 
  a ) go to a local recycling center and ask if they have any old pc case . 
  they will likely give you some old beige one for free . 
  b ) get a wooden board and secure your components to a wooden board, 
   it 's an awesome benefit . 
  not really . 
  you pay for it with higher prices . 
  first lesson of economics : there is no such thing as free lunch . 
  do we know memory clocks ? 
  i ask because i saw some benches with very nice vram freq scaling . 
  from that post :, 
   also , running a businses might be more expensive in your country due to legislation , taxation , etc. , so prices might need to be higher for stores to survive . 
  which is my point . 
  what a joke they are cherrypicking the best possible settings - for example they are doing supersample antialiasing combined with high settings . 
  like lol - nobody in real world would use that . 
  they are going as far as to show sub 60fps unplayble settings . 
  a ) if you want to test at 1080p and show ssaa you are basically testing at entirely different resolutions .
