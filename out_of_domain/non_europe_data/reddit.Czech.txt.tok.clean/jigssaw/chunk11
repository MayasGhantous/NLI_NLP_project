  holy crap ... . and people still badmouth 8350 ? 
  its from 2012 ... now i really want excavator 8core :-) :-), 
  maybe we can finally start recomending that cpu ... . 
  yeah and people still badmouth the 8350 ... its a great cpu which finally starts to shine because games are actually starting to use more then half of its performance ... hooray :-), 
  now i really want excavator 8-core . 
  yeah sure 970 is great gpu and if i were building a new system in that price range right now i would propably buy one . 
  it just does n't seem to make sense to buy one when you have one right now that can do more than you need/want . 
  true that !, 
  but there is one way to still keep using his ddr2 - sure its not the smartest way but . 
  you can get one of the best phenom iis ( like x6 1100t or x4 980 ) and run it in am2 + board which uses ddr2 . 
  but good luck finding one of those cpus on cheap . 
  those cpus when overclocked can still hold its own today :-) ( not for much longer though :d ), 
  cheapest game you can get for free ? 
  u wot m8 ? 
  but seriously propably warface - its a f2p mmofps that runs on cryengine ( do n't know if its anygood or pay to win - havent played it ) . 
  no i would n't :-) thats why i said its not the smartest way . 
  it was more like a thought experiment . 
  860k is propably the best budget cpu you can get . 
  its cheap and its gon na give you plenty more computational power than you have now :-),

  i might even call that overkill for that low power gpu :-) also i picked a board with 4 ram slots so you can upgrade later - which is worth it . 
  if you added better gpu you could expect some mid to high quality gaming at 1080p, 
  could it really be 28nm soi ?

  propably your best option when taking budget into consideration.but you are gon na have to get new memory as well - ddr2 is obsolete you need ddr3 . 
  comparison to your old cpu : http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp[]=302&amp;cmp[]=2362, 
  your cpu is still goood but i would get aftermarket cooler and overclock it a bit ( its propably not unlocked but you can do that using fsb ) . 
  you need more ram atleast 8gb ( 12 would be more future proof ) . 
  your gpu is aging but it should be enough for that resolution imho - if what i suggested wo n't help too much then you need to get new gpu - i 'd propably wait till february to see what amd is cooking with hbm . 
  ssd will improve the overall snappiness but wont help with fps . 
  another thing to keep in mind - arcgis and other software propably too uses gpu acceleration so maybe getting a gpu instead of using the igpu would bring more performance . 
  you do n't want to cheap out on wifi adapter ... trust me . 
  keep the one he wanted in the first place . 
  by all means get ssd its a night and day difference . 
  i would get more ram first though . 
  i do n't know the price difference between those cpus but it might still be benefitial to get the k one because they will hold their value better on secondhand market when you want to upgrade :-), 
  imho aftermarket r9 290 @ 250 $ is sweet spot gpu right now . 
  i would n't spend more than that . 
  are you gon na be overclocking ? 
  if not then 500w is enough, 
  if he already has something that can work there is no need to buy a new one ... waste of money . 
  cpu + - 84w max, 
  gpu + - 300w max, 
  you still get around 50w to spare for mobo and hdd and, 
  that is enough, 
  most people do n't know what their gpu even is :-) most reasonable enthusiast would agree that amd is almost always better bang for your buck . 
  excluding fanboys . 
  i would get 650w-700w just so it can stay with you no mater what you want to upgrade to :-) but even 600w should be enogh for your system . 
  because you might be running overclocked cpu and bunch of drives :-), 
  i love it :d, 
  it might just be there because they are reusing their assets from different source games . 
  just go with am1 athlon 5350 - great little apu that can be cooled passively with enough power to do all media thingies you might want . + dirt cheap miniitx mobos for this one, 
  my way - get some thin small cheap laptop for browsing and such ( like the new hp stream 14 '' - passive cooled for 300 $ ) . 
  and a proper desktop pc . 
  fx6300  i3, 
  mechanical drives do n't saturate 3gbps anyway, 
  reminds me of starship troopers !, 
  :-) service guarantees citizenship !, 
  i am not sure if they are as good - but they are good enough so most people could hardly tell a difference :-), 
  i 'd go with xfx they have lifetime warranty and they are amd only vendor . 
  get amd card - they are better value for the money in that price range and you have the benefit of mantle to alleviate potential cpu bottleneck of fx6300 and you also get free games with your amd card ( 17 % more performance @ 1080p for lower price ) :-) win win win, 
  i also switched the psu for a better one so it can last you trough potential upgrades 430w is not enough,

  edit : didnt realise you want everything from newegg ... but that gpu is too good of a deal to pass anyway so i 'd order it from ncix, 
  yep you 'll be alright unless you are doing some balls to the walls overclocking on both cpu and gpu :-), 
  its not neccesary but its the same prize :-) and i ussualy keep my psu through multiple builds and psu tend to lose some power ( like 10-20 % ) over the years . 
  also 750w is enough if you later decided to get one more gpu to crossfire ( not that it is a neccesarily good idea to do so , but it gives you options ) . 
  also if you do n't push your psu it tends to be cooler and therefore quiter . 
  550w-600w should be enough with healthy headroom for overclocking and such for that build . 
   i used to run my overclocked phenom ii x4 965 ( @ 3.8 ghz ) with dual hd5770 and later hd7970 ( r9 280x - but i was being bottlenecked a lot 50 % -70 % gpu usage ) . 
  so for you i would suggest something like r7 260-265 anything better is propably waste of money . 
   also keep in mind that if you have higher end am3 board it might support the new fx cpus with bios update ( that was my case so right now i am running fx8350 with my asus m4a890gtd am3 board :-) :-p ), 
   if you wanted to overclock you could expect to get like 3.6-3 .8 ghz out of that maybe more if you have a good chip and that would help a lot . 
  then 270 would propably be better choice . 
  edit : i kinda take it back the 460 is very similar to r9 260 so you propably would n't be able to get good performance jump unless you overclock . 
   also get more ram :-),
