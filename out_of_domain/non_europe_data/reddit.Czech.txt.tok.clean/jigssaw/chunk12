   get a bigger psu . 
  400w is really limiting and next time you upgrade you 're propably gon na have to buy another one - i 'd rather buy like 600-700w psu now and keep it longer . 
  or you could go the other way and keep the 300w psu but buy geforce 750ti ( but its + -20 % less powerful than the amd one ), 
   fx6300  i3 i would rather get the amd cpu unless you feel like you are gon na upgrade to i5-i7 in short amount of time . 
  i think you can reuse the fan you get with the reference card . 
  just about every psu should fit just make sure its 80 + ;, 
  500w will be enough .550 w would be better ( more headroom for potential overclocking ) .

  managed to shave 10 $ while improving performance :-), 
  you can save 50 $ + more without sacrificing any performance if you lose the small form factor and just get some regular cheap tower .

  they are about the same depending on the game you play ( in some games tha 750ti wins by about 5 % in others the radeon does ... ), 
  but you can use mantle with amd card and that improves performance noticably . 
  and you also get 2 free games with amd card ( never settle promotion ) . 
  if you are not going to overclock it will . 
  if you are gon na overclock i am not sure . 
  never used or seen that mobo brand . 
  to the point that once you get used to them you ca n't go back :-), 
  r9 280 is your best bet for 200 $ its a nice fit for your 8350 ( 8320/or wahtever you got :-) ), 
  pci-e 2.0 is compatible and you wont have any problems with it - no performance bottleneck, 
  yes http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=2389948, 
  here you go - fixed and made into proper pc,

   you do n't need cooler , if you trying to save as much money it is better to just buy some cheap case with psu preinstalled ( but you do n't want to use it at 100 % because they are ussualy cheap ones inside - but this build is like 330-350w - psu is 500w so youll be ok ) . 
   you do n't need optical - thats a waste of money ca n't remember last time i used optical media . 
   doubled the ram and got you a proper videocard, 
  even better ( 750ti is like 260x/265 ) + you get free games with never settle promotion . 
  win win, 
  i3 with 970 ? 
  ... thats is a bad idea . 
  he should either get i5 or r9 290 ( that is imho he best bang for the buck gpu that can be had at the moment ), 
  i just do n't think that i3 is a good deal - fx6350 can be had for same amount of money and is significantly better in all but few singlethread heavy applications ... 
  well if only thing it has to cool are vrms it might work just ok imho :-), 
  fine just fine ... 
  but if i were you i 'd rather get 24 '' 1080p or 21 '' 900p screen ... all that pixel density seems wasted to me . 
  imho watercooling is kinda pointless unless you want to go balls to the wall overclocking - proper aircooler is all you need . 
  too expensive for what is inside but otherwise quite reasonable build, 
  most people buy a pc and do n't upgrade the cpu atleast for 3/4 years ... by that time its ussualy lot better idea to just get new mobo and sell your old one anyway . 
  valuing `` upgradibility '' too much is a mistake - unless you do n't have much money now and know that you are gon na upgrade to better cpu next year do n't bother with it . 
  the fx cpu clearly has more power than the pentium and clearly more than i3 its just matter of devs utilizing it ( heck 8350 can even go toe to toe with i7 in some workloads ) and it will only get better with time . 
  also keep in mind that people that tests those overclocked pentiums ussualy run them on ridicilously high voltages ( for 22nm ) to achieve those clocks - and believe it or not that will affect their lifespan . 
  i 'd say that is close enough ... 
  yes, 
  are there any small slim cases ( without gpu support ) that can fit full atx mobo ? 
  if i was buildin a pc for someone who is not tech savvy i would get one otherwise i 'd rather get 128gb ssd to put system and some software on and storage drive - i ca n't expect my mother to be able to manage that though  . 
  being an arm licensee only boils amd in a different stew pot . 
  in x86-land , amd had one competitor . 
  now it has a hundred . 
  every chip company that can still fog a mirror makes arm chips ; how is amd any different ? '', 
   well amd can integrate its wordl class gpu technology into arm chip + name recognition - and with mobile phones trying to push 1440p and 4k more gpu is exactly what they need . 
  plus imho in the near future mainstream gpu 's might just go extinct thanks to the apu - so that is huge blow to nvidia and lot of market share going to amd ( or intel if they can keep up in the gpu department ) . 
  285 is basically a 280 with trueaudio and xdma crossfire . 
  either wait till february . 
  or get second 280 for crossfire . 
  i second that !, 
  format it to ntfs with gparted, 
  oh those tears of nvidia fanboys :-) :-) my poor old 7970ghz edition besting the shiny new 970 :-) :-), 
  on ssd definitely not . 
  on hdd i would still say no - imho the capacity isnt worth slowing it down, 
  more then twice ( 660 is around the r7 265 levels which is little bit faster than 750ti ) which means close to gaben :-) :-d, 
  just kidding bro :d, 
  now test it in 4k and show us how 290 can beat 980 :-d :-d, 
  wait a sec - he said that its right on schedule ... ... 
  but was n't carrizo-l supposed to be here in december not in 2015 ? 
  yes that is the correct way . 
  dpi is very personal thing and depends on your mouse/mousepad and what you are used to . 
  i currently use 1200dpi on a textile mousepad . 
  but you have to try which is the best for you,
