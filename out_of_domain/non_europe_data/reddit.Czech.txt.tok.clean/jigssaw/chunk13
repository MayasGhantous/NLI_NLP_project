  simply said - every chip is different but manufacturers do n't have the time and money ( and it doesnt make sense ) to segment their line up into hundreds of skus . 
  overclocking is simply taking your chip to its maximum potential . 
  you can ussualy get few percent better performance without sacrificing anything ( only the time :-) ) . 
  or you can try to go farther and rise voltages - which will make the chip run hotter and can shorten its lifespan but it will make it stable at higher frequencies . 
  or you can go the otherway - keep the clocks and lower the voltages to have cooler and more silent chip that will last longer . 
  ooooh my bad you are propably right :-), 
  second the cpu . 
  but i would propably go r9 290 gpu ( or wait for 960/wait for february next gen amd cards ) they are cheap as hell now and you propably wo n't see benefits with more expensive card since 8350 will propably bottleneck some . 
  edit : nope . 
  that mobo only supports 95w cpus -- so 8370e/8320e is your best bet . 
  i would also suggest getting pcie usb3 card if you use external drives - if not do n't bother with it . 
  60 is enough to keep windows and couple apps . 
  i would n't bother with bigger one . 
  well that is hard ... you have pretty balanced build so upgrading one componenet wont really help much . 
  you would have to upgrade both cpu and gpu - and to upgrade cpu you need to get a new motherboard . 
  ( and another 4gb of ram would be nice too ) . 
  your best bet is to essentially keep the case , psu , drives , ram ( + get 2 more sticks ) and change everything else . 
  and you wo n't be able to do that ( obviously ) on that budget ( you could but the upgrade wouldnt be very big so ) . 
  my suggestion : get aftermarket cpu cooler ( coolermaster evo is pretty cheap ) and try to overclock both your gpu and cpu - in the meantime save up some more money and then sell your old parts and upgrade . 
  budget ? 
  since you want to do lot of multitasking and videoediting i would suggest amd fx cpu . 
  ( fx 6300 over i3 / fx 8350 over i5 ) or if budget is no costraint then by all means go i7 . 
  you can buy passive hdmi -  dvi converters for few buck of ebay . 
  ( you 'll lose sound on them but that is no issue for monitors ), 
  correct . 
  no quality loss - hdmi is just dvi signal + sound . 
  nope - different socket ( that cpu is from 2006 ), 
  more ram wont help at all . 
  sell and build, 
  my thoughs :, 
   you are paying huge amount of money for your case and psu ( 100 $ in a 700 $ build is a lot of money ) - if dont care too much about looks and do n't mind spending little more time building it then just go for some 40 $ case with 500w powersupply preinstalled - coolermaster makes a okay case for that price . 
   i 'd rather have fx6300 than i3 - it is better in everything but few singlethread heavy tasks and unoptimazed games . 
   35 $ for a dvd writer ? 
  to hell with that - waste of money.honestly cant remember the last time i used optical media . 
   you are spending considerably more money on your cpu as opposed to gpu - that is ussualy a bad idea for a gaming rig . 
   4gb ram is not enough, 
   ssd only ? 
  ... hmm imho not enough storage, 
   that mobo is wayyyyy overprized for a locked cpu, 
  you can build lot more powerful rig in that price range if you are prepared to cut some corners . 
  something like this for 100 $ less and considerably more powerful,

  it should work just fine . 
  imho that gpu is a overkill . 
  youll see bottlenecking, 
  128gb ssd + 2-3tb hdd ( depending on what is the current best price per gb ), 
  yes . 
  i3 might be slightly better in some games - but 6300 is overall better cpu that is more future proof . 
  ooooooooooh my bad :-( sorry how stupid of me . 
  anyway i would recommend either the 280 or 290 depending on the budget anythin more powerful will go to waste with taht cpu,

  wait for freesync screens next year . 
  oh you 're right - i would either wait for the gtx960 ( which should be less powerhungry ) , or buy a better psu ( 600w-700w ), 
  black mesa . 
  did you forgot gpu ? 
  or are you just building a workstation that wo n't use any gpu acceleration ? 
  oh i did n't even realize there were two links :-), 
  what is your gpu ? 
  r9 200 series does n't tell us almost anything,

  enough performance for streaming - 25watt tdp =  dead silent . 
  cheaper . 
  language wall ... . 
  so basically uk is your best bet . 
  but ... the grass is n't always greener on the other side :-) :-) :-), 
  600-700w psu is imho the best bet - 500w would be enough for that build but the price difference is small and buying bigger psu now makes your build more future proof . 
  ( psus can last through multiple builds :-) ), 
  then go to switzerland . 
  freeest country in europe - low taxes , reasonable gun policies . 
  and of course rich history and beatiful scenery . 
  louxemburg would be better idead then belguim imho . 
  just for economical reasons . 
  that is correct ( but you can always sell that little athlon - they are dirt cheap and a great little apus for office uses or grandma pc :-) :-) ) . 
  if you 're thinking like that then i3 or pentium g3258 might be better idea . 
  btw i would not buy that ecs mobo . 
  if you look at it closely you 'll see that they use electrolytic capacitators and that is a big no-no ( it 's only matter of time before they go bad ) . 
  + i have n't heard about that company before . 
  also it just seems too cheap ( the reason why that athlon board is that low price is becasue it has no chipset - everyhing is integrated in the soc it is basically just a bunch of dumb traces ) - they have to be cutting corners somewhere . 
  but that 's just my 0.02 $ . 
  i am talking mainly about economic freedom .
