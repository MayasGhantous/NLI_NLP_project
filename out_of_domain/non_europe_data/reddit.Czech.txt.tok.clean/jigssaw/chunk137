  do you think it would be a possibility to make cs _ map that would be played on tournaments ? 
  hello i have ga-m61sme-s2l am2 board and i am looking to upgrade memory so i can run win8 .1 . 
  i have seen on ebay very cheap hynix high-density ddr2 memory that is not supported by intel boards . 
  so i wanted to ask if any of you tried buying it and if it works . 
  is that card enough for 1080p medium/low @ 60 + fps ? 
  i have a very good deal on a used one and according to gpu hierarchy chart ( tomshardware ) it should be in the same class as r7 250 ( ddr3 version ) . 
  but sometimes just boots and operates normally until you turn it off - i tried reseating and reaplaying thermal paste ( + new pads ) , tried different charger but still no luck . 
  its old asus 1.6 ghz intel dual core . 
  any ideas ? 
  i know that some cpus used to run on 3.3 v is it because of that ? 
  are there even used for something today or is it everything 12v ? 
  its low but steady noise that happens all the time and it really bothers me a lot . 
  the hdd was purchased in 2012 so its no longer under warranty . 
  shows `` current pending sector count '' and `` uncorrectable sector count '' to be 84 . 
  so i guess its diying a slow death :-( . 
  any ideas ? 
  or should i just get my data elsewhere asap ( important stuff is already elsewhere in multiple places ) and get rid of that thing ( sell it on ebay or such ) and get a new drive . 
  and if that is the case what would you suggest - need 3tb drive that is quiet , durable and reasonably cheap - its not gon na be operational 24/7 since i have also an small ssd ), 
  are the slightly more expensive red/nas drive worth it ? 
  i am looking for high-capacity ( 3/4 tb ) internal hdd to store bunch of my data . 
  i already have an ssd so the harddrive will be sleeping a good amount of the time . 
  what i want is for it to be quiet , reliable ( as in not to start acting up in 3years like my old one :( ) and reasonably priced . 
  there are also bunch of different options - pipeline , survailance , nas drives , av ... and such - should i pick one of those instead of normal desktop drive ( my use isnt system drive anyway ... ) ? 
  so today i came home from work started my pc and boom my second screen - which is dell 19 '' ips panel connected through dp-dp -  dp-minidp -  hd 7970ghz edition suddenly stopped working . 
  ( it gets recognised as a generic monitor which only supports 640x480 and doesnt display any output ) . 
  so i reinstalled catalyst , ( even tried native windows drivers ) without any luck . 
  tried connecting it to my second minidp output on my gpu , tried changing dp-minidp adapter - no luck . 
  connecting through vga or dvi works ... dont have any other dp screens or devices to try it though :-( (, 
  any ideas ? 
  screen is dell p19s14, 
  cheers fellas i need help :-), 
  i for the love of god ca n't figure out how can i do combinations variations and permutations on this calculator ( sencor sec 101 ) and the only manual the company has for download is in hungarian ( wtf ?!? ), 
  picture of the calculator :, 
  hello i am shopping for simple scientific calculator for mainly for statistics , integrals and combinations and variations . 
  this one caught my eye . 
  is it any good or are there better options that are not lot more expensive ? 
  i think there should be implemented some kind of rating system that would count your ratio of being kicked , teamkills , comp.bans and reports to number of games you play . 
  and if the number was too high you would be branded as `` having bad behavior '' ( or whatever politicaly correct word for toxic :-) ) - popup would show on your screen warning you about that . 
  and telling you to act better . 
  the players deemed toxic would be :, 
  1 . more-likely to be put into match-making with other toxic players, 
  2 . being able to be kicked with simple majority as opposed to every remaining player having to agree ( so they are not imune to kick when playing with a friend ), 
  3 . having their reports count less ( so they do n't abuse it and report other poeple ), 
  ... more ideas ? 
  once their ratio would get back to normal level ( i.e. 
  they play games without being toxic ) it would revert back to normal . 
  also number of reports for griefing/offensive behavior would have to be limited as to not get abused . 
  there could also be some rewards implemented for players with the lowest amount of bad actions such as some random skins once a period a time . 
  i dont think it would be too hard to implement as valve surely tracks these stats already :-), 
  tldr : ratio of bad behavior / games played . 
  players with bad ratio would be queed together . 
  hello guys i wanted to ask you if i have a multimonitor setup using outputs from both my igpu and dgpu how does it do stuff like video decode - because my igpu ca n't do hardware h264 decode but my dgpu can . 
  will even the videos running on the screen connected to igpu output use the dgpu to decode the video ? 
  and how would games played on the igpu screen work ? 
  the reason i ask this is that i can source a lot of hd3470s with two displayport only ports for dirt cheap and they make a great litle card for those older core2 / athlon ii rigs that have igpu which sucks . 
  and not many people have dp monitors . 
  will the dgpu be put to work even if you are not using the output on it ?

  i am getting a8 7650k instead of 7600 but its not on pcpp . 
  its meant to be basic work pc no gaming mostly browsing and light video editing . 
  anything i should change ? 
  its my first time for such a event any advice what not to miss and what not to do ? 
  so i am going to katowice but forgot to buy tickets and now they are all sold out . 
  did i fuck up a lot or is getting there without priority managable / or can i still buy some tickets at the venue ? 
  edit : if any of you have tickets to sell please send me a message :-), 
  they had their booth right next to the stage in the expo center . 
  and i do n't know who 's idea it was but sorry being louder than the commentators during almost every fricking game played there is not a good way to promote your brand . 
  especially for guys sitting on the left side they couldnt even hear the game half the time because of stupid guy screaming hyperx and other bs all the time . 
  i do n't think anybody there is going to buy your products anytime soon ... 
  otherwise the event was great and i loved it and hope to see you next year :-) ( and please make the venue bigger so people can actually move and breathe during virtus.pro games :d :d ), 
  hello guys , so my current htpc is old c2d era laptop with mere 1000 passmark that only has analog outputs and has propably some problems with shielding because it started acting out and the output is blurry and has lines ... 
  so i decided to upgrade and i decided to make a challenge out of it just to see how cheap i can actually make my new htpc/home computer . 
  i recently came into possession of a broken fullatx am2 motherboard which the owner have thrown away ( gigabyte m61sme3p ) - and all it needed was actually just a few capacitators which i already had lying in my parts box ( price of parts < 2 $ ) . 
  ok its kind of a cheating but its true :-) one mans trash is another man treasure . 
  so motherboard was essentially free and i decided to build it around it . 
  the nice thing about those old 2005 era motherboards is that they actually support am3 cpus from 2010 with a simple bios update so they are actually not worthless :-) hooray for socket compatibility . 
  i also already own stock amd cooler which will fit this board , because i upgraded the cooler for my fx8350 . 
  but even if you do n't , chances are you can get one very cheaply because they 've been using the same locking mechanism for 10 + years now :-), 
  for a cpu i browsed ebay and found out the 2 best bang for the buck cpus that will be enough for me on this socket are . 
  phenom 8650 ( 14 $ shipped , 2000passmark ) and athlon ii x3 425 ( 24 $ shipped 2500 + passmark ) i decided to go with the newer athlon . 
  problem with these build based on older platforms is that we are gon na need a gpu as those old igpus ca n't handle h264 decoding . 
  i managed to pick up ati radeon hd3470 ( 256mb ) for 11 $ shipped which is frugal htpc card that will be enough for everything i need . 
  the card was so cheap because it only has 2 displayport outputs but i fixed that with a passive 3 $ dp -  hdmi adapter from ebay . 
  for ram we are gon na need some ddr2 , my board has 4slots so you can reuse a lot of small sticks which you can get for free ( lot of people are upgrading mobos with 2slots :-) ) . 
  but you do n't even have to because these amd platforms support high-density ddr2 memory which is cheap as f -- k. 
  4gb - 13 $ shipped on ebay . 
  you ca n't beat that . 
  now storage - the board supports ide drives and i already have some old 3,5 hdd i could use ( and you can get some like 40gb for free if you really want to stretch your budget ) . 
  but i opted to go with an 128gb ssd ( mainly because the old hdds are noisy ) which you can get for like 50 $ ( all my streaming is over network ) . 
  now for the last part of my build i found an small desktop case from a prebuilt computer with 280w psu inside . 
  for glorious 14 $ shipped .
