  the case only fits microatx so i needed to make some modifications :-), 
  turns out getting rid of the rails that hold dvd drive and hdd and putting the psu there instead was all i needed to do and now this little case will happily take my atx mobo . 
  also because those prebuilt cases dont use standard case headers i needed to use my multimeter to figure out which wires corespond to what and then use dupont cables to wire everything correctly . 
  here is the total build :,

  everything is not finished yet but soon will be ( need to make some last modifications to make front panel usb work and cable manage everrything , alse fix the place where the mains cable leaves the case ) :-), 
  actually cant wait to install win 8.1 on it ( hooray for free student licences ) and test everything . 
  ps : sorry for very long post :-), 
  hello guys , so my current htpc is old c2d era laptop with mere 1000 passmark that only has analog outputs and has propably some problems with shielding because it started acting out and the output is blurry and has lines ... 
  so i decided to upgrade and i decided to make a challenge out of it just to see how cheap i can actually make my new htpc/home computer . 
  i recently came into possession of a broken fullatx am2 motherboard which the owner have thrown away ( gigabyte m61sme3p ) - and all it needed was actually just a few capacitators which i already had lying in my parts box ( price of parts < 2 $ ) . 
  ok its kind of a cheating but its true :-) one mans trash is another man treasure . 
  so motherboard was essentially free and i decided to build it around it . 
  the nice thing about those old 2005 era motherboards is that they actually support am3 cpus from 2010 with a simple bios update so they are actually not worthless :-) hooray for socket compatibility . 
  i also already own stock amd cooler which will fit this board , because i upgraded the cooler for my fx8350 . 
  but even if you do n't , chances are you can get one very cheaply because they 've been using the same locking mechanism for 10 + years now :-), 
  for a cpu i browsed ebay and found out the 2 best bang for the buck cpus that will be enough for me on this socket are . 
  phenom 8650 ( 14 $ shipped , 2000passmark ) and athlon ii x3 425 ( 24 $ shipped 2500 + passmark ) i decided to go with the newer athlon . 
  problem with these build based on older platforms is that we are gon na need a gpu as those old igpus ca n't handle h264 decoding . 
  i managed to pick up ati radeon hd3470 ( 256mb ) for 11 $ shipped which is frugal htpc card that will be enough for everything i need . 
  the card was so cheap because it only has 2 displayport outputs but i fixed that with a passive 3 $ dp -  hdmi adapter from ebay . 
  for ram we are gon na need some ddr2 , my board has 4slots so you can reuse a lot of small sticks which you can get for free ( lot of people are upgrading mobos with 2slots :-) ) . 
  but you do n't even have to because these amd platforms support high-density ddr2 memory which is cheap as f -- k. 
  4gb - 13 $ shipped on ebay . 
  you ca n't beat that . 
  now storage - the board supports ide drives and i already have some old 3,5 hdd i could use ( and you can get some like 40gb for free if you really want to stretch your budget ) . 
  but i opted to go with an 128gb ssd ( mainly because the old hdds are noisy ) which you can get for like 50 $ ( all my streaming is over network ) . 
  now for the last part of my build i found an small desktop case from a prebuilt computer with 280w psu inside . 
  for glorious 14 $ shipped . 
  the case only fits microatx so i needed to make some modifications :-), 
  turns out getting rid of the rails that hold dvd drive and hdd and putting the psu there instead was all i needed to do and now this little case will happily take my atx mobo . 
  also because those prebuilt cases dont use standard case headers i needed to use my multimeter to figure out which wires corespond to what and then use dupont cables to wire everything correctly .

  hello guys i am looking for a tool that will test speed and latency of internet connection using multiple connections at a time . 
  any ideas ? 
  hello guys i am looking for a tool that will test speed and latency of internet connection using multiple connections at a time . 
  any ideas ? 
  hey guys am i the only one with this ridicilous problem ? 
  maybe it has to do with facebook not really understanding czech language or i do n't know . 
  i am `` liking '' of number `` political '' groups on facebook - mostly ancap/libertarian groups . 
  not a single one which can be even remotely called soccialist ... yet facebook keeps reccomending me to join socialist groups ... first it was funny but now i its getting ridicilous ( shit like `` people against capitalism '' , `` we want socialism '' , and other ridicilous groups i would n't touch with a ten-pole stick ) . 
  is facebook just that stupid or - * puts on a tinfoil hat * - are they trying to make me socialist :d :d, 
  i nominate :, 
  this is the new kind of stupid ... 
  if i only change igpu clocks do i need to run prime95 to check cpu aswell ? 
  or is it sufficient to only test the gpu and if so what software to use ? 
  inb4 downvote train ... :-), 
  i see people commenting stuff like `` they get 75 % for doing nothing '' here all the time - so let me breakdown for you guys why that is indeed wrong . 
  valve is giving you great userbase and marketplace with good visibility and easy payment option + easy install method . 
  do you think that is worthless ? 
  bethesda is giving you the right to use their intelectual property and assets to essentially make your own game / expansion pack . 
  before then you would just get your ass sued if you tried to sell anything with it . 
  do you think lets say having the right to use mario or metroid in your game is worthless ? 
  do you think having the right to do expansion for immenselly popular and marketed franchise as opposed to starting your own franchise no one knows is worthless ? 
  let me also reitarate that nobody is forcing people to take this deal you can still make your mods and release them for free - but you have a choice now to release a paid mod which means - you can afford to make bigger and better mods / expansion paks . 
  so its win-win for us too - we get more quality content for our favorite games . 
  you also have to take in consideration that by allowing this - they are allowing a direct competition for their own dlc/expansions . 
  as opposed to companies like ea who locks out modding at all so they can sell you fucking map packs for battlefield . 
  we can argue if maybe 50 % / 60 % would be a better deal . 
  but that doesnt really matter that is quantitative discussion - they are providing valuable service for you and you can choose to use it or not . 
  so steam just released a statement that they are pulling it down ... 
  well i hope you are proud of yourself for destrying choices of other people . 
  its not like you were fucking forced to pay for anything or modders were forced to release payed content . 
  they were simply given an option on which they could release unofficial expansion packs for money without a fear of huge lawsuits for copyright infringment . 
  if you could just understand economics 101 , you would see how that the 75 % / 25 % split was actually a pretty damn good deal . 
  steam sorted out all the distribution and some advertising and bethesda offered them to use their intelectuall property , their assets , engine and everything to make a game . 
  now guess what sells more copies big unofficial expansion pack for a hugely popular franchise or a indie game ? 
  `` fallout : the untold stories '' or `` postapocalyptic joe adventure indie edition '' ? 
  ( not to mention that the indie dev still has to pay for engine and distribution on steam ) . 
  we could 've gotten modders working full time , new indie studios working exlusively to bring us a new unoficial chapter and stories in our most popular franchises universes - sort of like telltale does for got or walking dead . 
  it could 've been glorious . 
  big budget expansion packs ...
