  netherlands and louxemburg are signifacantly more free ( = easier to start bussiness , lower taxes and overall better bussiness enviroment =  lower unemployment and such ) . 
  steam used to pay vat for all european purchases in louxemburg ( or netherlands - not sure at the moment ) for all european purchases . 
  that 's how : http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp[]=1781&amp;cmp[]=2015, 
  plus fx is overclockable and this i3 is locked ... 
  i3 has better singlethread but it is only a dual-core fx simply destroys it by having 3 times as much cores ... while most games today are single thread heavy do you really expect that to do n't change while we have consoles with 8 ultralow power cores ? 
  well simply because i do n't think its worth it to pay 100 $ more for g-sync module today and at the same time it would be a waste not to hop on variable refresh rate technology - monitors last a long time and i do n't see a problem with waiting few months ( he has a monitor today - its not essential upgrade ) - i know i would do the same thing . 
  i 'd rather get r9 290 or wait for gtx960 . 
  imho the cpu would bottleneck the 970 . 
  and the 290 is too good of a deal to pass .

  100 $ less without losing almost any performance in 90 % of applications, 
  i meant because lots of games today are not utilizing the whole power of fx6300 ( it has 6 cores ) but because of new consoles and the overall trends - more software is comming out that will use every single one of them and while i3 ( dual-core ) might win in some applications today fx will win tomorow . 
  nothing wrong with picking nvidia i just think 970 is little bit overkill for that particular cpu :-), 
  r9 290 is a great deal . 
  psu should be enough ( unless you are overclocking - but you are propably not since your cpu is locked ) . 
  if i were you i 'd wait till february - amd will be coming with new gen of cards that might be a gamechanger ( due to new hbm memory technology ) . 
  but if you do n't want to wait go for 290 its a great deal . 
  edit : stupid pcpartpicker did everything from newegg ... 
  fixed and actually relevant now :d, 
  you need different case/psu ( 90w is not enough for your build ),

  40 $ cheaper, 
  better performance in some games . 
  can be overclocked, 
   cons :, 
  worse cpu performance ( not by all that much if using all threads and propably about the same if overclocked ) . 
  worse gaming performance in some games . 
  depends on what you want - but for htpc i would propably rather get that little athlon . 
  or spend more and get the unlocked pentium . 
  ooooor if you were open to slightly bigger case ( microatx fm2 + rig would be lot better at that price point ) :,

  cpu bench : http://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp[]=2195&amp;cmp[]=2020&amp;cmp[]=2311, 
  i know sorry now i fixed it stupid god damn pc partpicker choose newegg for everything and they didnt have the ssd :(, 
  well honestly i would ` nt really bother with `` upgradability '' . 
  since socket 1150 is not that futureproof - there will be like one more generation coming to that socket ( which will add like 10 % -15 % ipc ... so nothing ground breaking ) . 
  that small performance boost imho does n't warrant upgrade anyway so when it comes time for you to have any decent upgrade there will be another socket . 
  i5 is better cpu but imho you should be ok with fx6300 unless you are arma player ( which is known for being horrible on amd cpus ) . 
  the gaming performance is kinda similar - some games go to the penitum some go to athlon - but since you can overclock the athlon ( while still staying on lower tdp than that pentium ) you might even get better perf . 
  overall, 
  btw : just today amd announced that they will be cutting prices of their apus so maybe it will be worth it to wait few days - but the performance difference over that 5350/pentium would be pretty big so it might be worth it if you want to game a little on that thing, 
  btw : if you want to overclock go with asus board ( as far as i know - might have changed ) - but asus was the only one where overclocking worked . 
  does n't those programs use gpus to accelarate computing ? 
  if yes get better gpu if no i would n't bother with it and just use the one intagrated in that cpu . 
  - also amd f8350 will be a better deal for workstation imho . 
  not really - i remember seing carrizo on bunch of roadmaps :-), 
  athlon 5350 or 5150 . 
  dirt cheap ( + dirt cheap mobos even miniitx ) 25w apu that does everything you need . 
  small miniitx cases will add to the professional look :-), 
  id say the a8 would be better in gaming performance . 
  would n't bother with upgrading anything yet . 
  yep you have perfectly good rig right now . 
  simply said you would be paying a lot for a not so big performance jump . 
  maybe only thing that would make sense would be getting another 290 ( they are really cheap right now ) for crossfire ( if you have enough psu wattage ), 
  that gpu is known to run very hot . 
  ( all those fermi jokes float around the internet :-), 
  true . 
  ibm model m is great because it was built like a tank and pricy compared to modern shitty membrane keyboards its great . 
  compared to modern mechanical keyboard its comparable and it comes down to personal prefference . 
  2 . early lcd screens had slight delay , ghosting , and lower refresh rates - today you can get 144mhz lcd screens so that no longer is truth, 
  dp is better in everyway except compatibility . 
  measuring tape :-), 
  @cooler :, 
  if you are not gon na be overclocking ( looks like you wont since its locked cpu ) then you do n't have to buy it - you can always buy it later if you are not happy with stock cooler performance :-),
