  i would expect it to hold up for 2016 without driver updates and then propably not really be all that useful - but since he is propably gon na be buying older games from steamsales anyway ( his current rig is athlon x2 with igpu so he has a looooot of back catalog to enjoy ) i do n't think that will matter all that much . 
  and for those older games this card should rock . 
  and i am thinking about doing it now even when polaris is close . 
  let me state my reasoning and then try to talk me out of it . 
  so i bought my 7970ghz used in march of 2014 and just like a month ago its out of warranty . 
  ( i succesfully rma 'd it in december because of artifacting and crahing in video playback ( games were fine ) ) . 
  i am kinda scared of that happening again so selling it now would make me feel safe . 
  i do n't expect polaris to shake up the prices all that much - after all 14nm is more expensive per transistor than 28nm . 
  and even if the prices shake up a lot i would expect my card to lose lot more value than the potential cards i am looking to buy - the mainstream will have massive perf/watt benefits and propably be cheaper aswell ( power delivery , heatsinks and such ) . 
  on the other hand if i sell my card now and buy a used 290/290x i gain around 30 % more performance a year or so warranty and mostly more future-proof card . 
  i do n't really have many performance problems now that i would need a better card - its mostly just to make my self safe . 
  do you agree with this reasoning or do you think it is a stupid ? 
  * btw : i bought the 7970ghz for 250 eur used and right now i would be propably able to sell it for around 180 eur . 
  which is not bad at all considering i got almost two years of service out of it . 
  ** tldr : ** i am expecting 7970ghz to lose more value when polaris hits then the gpus i am potentially looking to buy - so buying now seems to me like a better idea . 
  hello guys do you know of any good software that does that ? 
  i remember seeing really cool promotional video about it while back but i ca n't find any products featuring it . 
  any info ? 
  basically do you think it is wise to upgrade your screen now ? 
  or do you expect them to become more ubiquitous and considerably cheaper ( maybe thanks to freesync over hdmi ) in the next 6-12 months ? 
  hello guys i am looking to upgrade my 24 '' 1080p 60hz ips display . 
  currently screen that caught my eye is lg 34um57-p . 
  it is 34 '' ultra-wide 2560x1080 has freesync and is 75hz . 
  and the newer ips is propably considerably better than my old one . 
  what i am concerned about though is that the display has actually little bit lower ppi than my current monitor . 
  do you think i will notice it a lot ? 
  the new screen has ppi of 81,72 vs my panel which has 91,79 . 
  i also have a 1280x1024 19 '' screen which i use with ppi of 86,27 which i find okay aswell . 
  so instead of the regular big charities you can choose to give your money to organizations that are actually making a difference . 
  for example :, 
  the n.r.a. 
  ludwig von mises institute, 
  institute for justice, 
  and others . 
  so recently humblebundle.com added the option to choose your, 
  own charity instead of the regular big names they are supporting . 
  amongst others you can choose :, 
  ludwig von mises institute, 
  institute for justice, 
  nra foundation, 
  so i have a simple htpc from spare parts with the cheapest gpu with hdmi output ( and h264 ) i could find which happened to be ooooold ati hd2400 . 
  however since i upgraded to windows 10 i 've been having issues with the gpu drivers ( they are obviously eol and sadly do n't work properly with 10 ) . 
  so i decided to upgrade to a new gpu . 
  i found a very good deal on a second hand almost new gt610 and i jumped on it thinking great its gon na work just fine and be more efficient and more quiet . 
  you would n't believe how pissed i was when i found out after installing it that the stupid card has no fan control and always runs at 100 % meaning its like a bloody vacuum cleaner . 
  my old hd2400 had similar sized heatsink and was miles more quiet than this shit ... 
  so me being me i decided to make my own fan control and jerry rigged a variable resistor on the 12v + line going in to the fan - turns out the fan will not spin on lower voltage at all so great they put the shittest possible fan on it . 
  in the end i just unscrewed the fan from the heatsink and went for the zip-tie method and added a simple 60mm fan which is controlled from the mobo ... 
  i have to say i am very dissapointed with asus and nvidia for making such product and i would suggest no one to buy it . 
  as for the actual gpu part of the card - it does everything i need from it so i am happy with that ( and yeah i know you can buy a passively cooled one but who would have thought that they wo n't be able to cool a card reasonably quiet with a fan ... ) . 
  tldr : asus and nvidia sell cards in todays market that run their fan @ 100 % all the time . 
  f-ck that . 
  [ removed ], 
  it might sound silly but my reasoning is simple - i was sporting hd 7970 ghz edition ( = = 280x ) and that is now already a 2 generation old card . 
  it still works great and the performance is firmly planted in the midrange now . 
  however i am expecting that the value will go down a lot after polaris releases - suddenly you will be able to get the same performance in low-mid-end card for cheap and with amazing powerconsumption . 
  so i am selling while they 're still worth something . 
  i got my hands on very cheap passivelly cooled second hand gt630 ( the kepler version that is now called 730 ) and that should tide me over just fine - it can play cs : go reasonably well and that is mostly what i play anyway :-), 
  your thoughts ? 
  hello guys , so i love my deathadder , it fits my hand great and all . 
  however my middle mouse button doesnt click anymore ( it does but like 1 in 10 attempts ) - the button physically clicks but it doesnt register . 
  so i am looking to solder in a replacement microswitch ( like i did with my lmb before ) - however i ca n't seem to find what kinda switch is there . 
  ( the mouse is obviously no longer under warranty so i ca n't rma . ), 
  just watch this video . 
  this is some gold . 
   `` 600 $ gpu that is significantly more powerful than titan x seems hard to believe . '', 
  top kek . 
  really ? 
  well you can guy a 600 $ that performs on par with titan x - its called aftermarket cooled oc 980ti ... 
  so i guess its sooooo hard to believe to think that next gen nvidia flagship priced product after a 2x + density die shrink and on finfet process is gon na be better than that . 
  ok i would have given him a benefit of the doubt after saying this - afterall he could be just some guy who started playing with pcs recently and never seen the `` magic '' of die shrinks . 
  but then he goes to `` advise '' his followers to go buy 1070 on a launch day and preorder it if its not avaliable . 
  well now that is some serious bs . 
  after what nv pulled with 970 the cut down part would be the last part i would preorder . 
  not sure if posted here already . 
  ** performance ** -, 
  he claims the perf is slightly better than stock 290x and within reach of 980 / 390x . 
  there is a part where he talks about his own personal oc model of 290x ( doesnt specify which one ) - and he says that he would swap those cards in a instant . 
  he also compares it in 3x 1920x1200 eyefinity which he uses in his personal rig - and he claims that 480 is better in some games . 
  ( =  not all ), 
  it might mean that they are on par in some or 480 loses some vs oc 290x ... however it could also just mean that 480 doesnt scale as well at higher resolutions ( posibly due to 32rops ? 
  ** cooler ** -, 
  he says the cooler is very simple but does its job great ( he was amazed at how quiet it is . 
  and that it in no way can be compared to 290x stock cooler ), 
  ** non-reference avaliability ** -, 
  he claims those cards will be avaliable mid-july alongside rx460 and rx470, 
  ** overclockability ** -, 
  he says to do n't expect it to be `` oc dream '' with 30 % higher performance potential and 1600mhz clockspeed . 
  but when overclocked it can reach cards sold at high-end prices recently . 
  hello i 've read that the new rx 480 ( and also the new nvidia gpus ) only support moptherboards with uefi and not older legacy bios motherboards . 
  can somebody confirm if that is correct or not ? 
  i want to upgrade to rx 480 but my motherboard is older asus m4a89gtd pro ( am3 flashed with beta bios and fx8350 cpu ) . 
  and it would suck if it didnt work :-(, 
  hello guys ,, 
  my first post here , just wanted to share my idea with you and get your feedback if it is actually possible to even make something like that . 
  so if you work in it you likely either have a stack of bunch of dvds / cds or usb drives that contain all the possible combinations of bootable utilities ( we are talking all the major windows disks , live linux distros , stuff like mmetest , clonezilla and so on ) . 
  i was thinking about using a pi zero sd card to store all of these . iso files and using its usb otg to emulate usb mass storage of specific isos . 
  as a method of choosing which one i think the simplest , cheap and also pretty cool way would be to use the gpio and just solder a headers to it and then use jumper like you used to do back in the day on ide drives when switching from master to slave . 
  another user already with little bit of soldering made his pi zero into a `` dongle form factor '' so that should n't be a problem . 
  hello guys ,,
