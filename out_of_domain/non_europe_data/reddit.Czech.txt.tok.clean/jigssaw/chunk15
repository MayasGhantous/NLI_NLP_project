  best of both worlds - i 've cut some corners ( mainly case and losing the liquid cooler - you can always get cooler later if you are not happy with stock performance - if you do n't want to try to hunt for el cheapo screen get r9 280 instead . 
  propably backlight . 
  if you can rma do it if you ca n't you might want to look into some guides about repairing that . 
  honestly anything over 80 + bronze is kinda waste of money - they are ussualy at very high premium and those few % of efficiency do n't matter, 
  i 'd look for one which has sata 3 ( 6gbps ) and usb3 - also look for one which supports 125w cpus - imho worth few bucks extra . 
  otherwise try to find specific reviews they will ussualy talk about vrm and stuff like that :-), 
  4130 is pretty ok cpu ( especcialy for that price ) - and you can always upgrade 8350 if you crave more performance . 
  if it does n't have to be matx and you do n't mind dealing with rebates than http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asrock-motherboard-970extreme3r20 is a great deal right now . 
  there are not many matx ones i would want :-), 
  if you have a board then go for 8350 no questions asked !, 
  for that price you ca n't go wrong its a great cpu . 
  did the same upgrade recently ( also had the same phenom :-) ) . 
  yes, 
  depends on your budget - either i7 or fx8350, 
  also - that cpu cooler is good for build that do n't have much space - its better idea to get tower cooler, 
  both amd and nvidia gpus have hardware accelerator for streaming so it mostly doesnt impact fps . 
  check your mobo - some of them do support fx cpus ( !!!! ), 
  with beta bios . 
  for instance i run asus m4a89gtd ( am3 ) with fx8350 . 
  if that is not the case then either get phenom ii x4 965 ( or 980 ) or phenom ii x6 - these are still decent cpus today . 
  look for used parts for instance ebay . 
  depending on what the pcs are maybe just buying ssds would be enough - that way you wouldnt have to even get new windwos licenses . 
  otherwise i 'd look into am1 athlon 5350 or some cheap pentium - eiter of those are good ideas for office pcs . 
  do n't forget ssds . 
  even crappy system with ssd can feel snappy . 
  7870 is gcn so yes - anything older than that propably nope . 
  radeon r9 270x is propably the best idea - little bit more expensive than that but you wont get anything better at that budget, 
  good built !, 
  your case is a bit pricier but that is the price of proper full tower cases so yeah ( full tower master race here :-) :-p ) . 
  that case can last you through many many builds so its propably worth it . 
  i honestly have no idea - but according to a google search - guy has lol maxed @ 1080p with that card @ 170-200 fps, 
  do n't bother with 2400mhz ram 1600mhz is all you need - basically no difference in fps for you . 
  get amd card they are better value for the money in that price range . 
  as far as i know you do n't need z97 board to oc the pentium - even the cheap boards can do that . 
  cooler is not overkill since you gon na be ocing . 
  i personally wouldn bother with dvd drive at all but thats up to you . 
  bf4 is one of the games where amd excells :-) i run hd 7970ghz edition . 
  i game a lot with that cpu - it works well in everygame i tried . 
  with good enough card you are gon na be bottlenecked a little in some badly optimized games but everything runs at more than 60fps which is ok for me :-), 
  it runs lot cooler and quiter than my overclocked phenom used to and overall i am very happy with that upgrade ( honestly bought it because i was dipping below 60 constantly in wolfenstein , after upgrade everything was smooth :-) ), 
  and with consoles having 8 core cpus - games are finally gon na be optimized properly for fx :-), 
  honestly after building and working inside a full tower case its hard to go back into cramped little midtowers :-) . 
  ( i went different way though - bough myself old used full tower from 2000 for few bucks and went diy - it was a lot of work but i am very happ with the finished product ), 
  the gpu is overkill for that cpu - you 'll be botllenecked . 
  i 'd go with 270/280 max . 
  this would be lot more balanced and overall better build - i 'd spend that 50 $ and get 2tb hdd the price difference over 1tb and 2tb is n't very high .

  you can use am3 + processors on some am3 boards !, 
  you have to check manufacturers site and download ( beta ) bios . 
  for instance my asus m4a89gtd/pro supports am3 + fx cpus . 
  and other ( ussualy higher-end ones ) do aswell . 
  if you look on for am3 + boards - youll see that lot of them are still using the old am3 chipsets ( 870 760 and so on ) . 
  propably ssd . 
  it might not help gaming performance ( but that build is ok for 1080 high/ultra anyway ) but it is just a quality of life thing :-) everything feels lot more snappy - 120gb for os and apps is enough . 
  270 is great value for the money - this is a great deal http://www.amazon.com/dp/b00gwv0zd8/?tag=pcpapi-20, 
  edit : you are in australia :-) gigabyte is ok amd vendor but if you can find xfx or sapphire in similar price range go for them . 
  btw . 
  here are some pics - just a comparison how roomy full tower vs mid tower can be :-) ( the first image is my old case with crappy cable management - but there wasnt much else i could 've done in that cheapo case ), 
  should be able to run everything decently at medium specs - something higher something lower @ 1080p 60fps, 
  honestly unless you just want to have fun with your parts its not worth it . 
  you 'll lose resellability and its just more trouble than its worth - get nice big tower air-cooler with silent fan or watercooling setup and forget about it . 
  but it sure is a cool thing to show off :-), 
  evga is best on nvidia side . 
  sapphire/xfx is best on amd side, 
  hmmm i would propably go with cheap am1 athlon 5350 - which is great litle 25w apu that is enough for all office work and is dead silent ( also pc can be very small because itx boards are dirt cheap ) . 
  you would n't even need an aftermarket cooler . 
  hmm r9 265 is propably the best in that budget . 
  but if i were you i would keep your gpu and save up until you get into 200-250 $ budget area that way you can have proper meaningful upgrade . 
  since your cpu is not unlocked for oc you do n't have to get expensive mobo :-), 
  its good balanced build ( maybe better gpu ( like r9 280 ) would be nice ) . 
  i do n't know about the price though - i am not from uk . 
  if you have some friend that go to it university - we get couple of keys for free . 
  so he might sell you one . 
  but its a gray area and not entirely legal . 
  i propably should n't even recomend it . 
  wait for somebody who deals more with intel - i ussuly build amd builds so i do n't know that much about intel chipsets :-), 
  not enugh . 
  undervolting . 
  yes . 
  the cpu has igpu so you can use your pc withou dedicated gpu, 
  there might theoretically problems if you bought all your sticks seperately - but right now youll be runing two pairs both in dual channel so it is perfectly ok . ( i currently run 2x4 gb kingston 1600mhz and 2x2gb zepellin 1866mhz ( i have to run them at 1600mhz though :-) ) .
