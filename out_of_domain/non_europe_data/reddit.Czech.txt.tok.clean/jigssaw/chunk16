  4 or 6gb should be more than enough, 
  i 'd build something like this :-) + hdd,

  we can go cheaper than that :, 
  this will run minecraft and do other light gaming ( lol , quakelive older games ) just fine . 
  and if you want you can get really small htpc case for it .

  with case like this it would be very appealing :-) http://pcpartpicker.com/part/apevia-case-xfit200, 
  its not out of date ... its 2014 part - sure its super cheap low power apu - 25watt part . 
  its meant to be for office machines or htpcs . 
  but it will play minecraft and do other light gaming just fine . 
  and for the price is pretty damn good machine . 
  op asked for cheap machine that can do x. 
  this can . 
  no problems . 
  yes its great game, 
  pretty good build , you dont need gpu for that . 
  you could even get away with using athlon 5350 25w dirt cheap apu - they are pretty snappy when paired with ssd :-) but that just if you wanted to go even cheaper . 
  x4 860k is imho better overall cpu than the pentium ( same with 6300 vs i3 ) ... but lot of people here are just blind intel fanboys ... 
  that cpu is still great - just overclock it a little and get a new gpu ( r9 290 is pretty damn good deal now of if you are team green wait for 960 ) and double the ram . 
  ... . opteron x series might be enough for this build . 
  they are cheap enough and draw very little power . 
  edit : ok my bad - plex can only utilize cpu power - ca n't use igp to do the streams . 
  undervolted fx6300 8320 would be propably best idea - plenty of cores , cheap , and decent power consumption when undervolted/idle which would be most of the time . 
  btw : good luck running 2x 1080p and 720p stream over wifi :-), 
  twice per core performance but fx has 3times as much cores ... so with better multithreadingthe fx has more power . 
  fx6300 is cheaper than i3 and should be enough i5 would handle it just fine . 
  todays being the key point . 
  and i said overall better cpu not overall better gaming cpu for today :-), 
  i said overall better cpu not `` better gaming cpu for today '', 
  i agree that the sweet spot for gaming pc build is + -600 $ , however if op ask what is the cheapest build to do x then the apu will do . 
  a8 7700 with fast ram would be of course better ( amd will be dropping prices even more on those supposedly in few days ) . 
  and pentium g3258/athlon 860k + r7 265/r7 260x/gtx 750ti even better . 
  or there is the possibility of buying used parts - which ussualy make sense for those ultralow budget machines - stuff like ram or cpus ussualy last very long time . 
  it will play minecraft 30-60fps on the igpu . 
  its not the best experience but pretty good for the money . 
  but if you have more to spare then there are better options . 
  this is the cheapest you can go . 
  these little kabini apus ca n't do hybrid crossfire sadly ( it would ` nt really make sense cause there is n't really a dgpu that would be good partner for crossfire anyway ), 
  not really - its ussualy better idea to pair the igpu less kaveri ( athlon 860k ) or pentium g3258 with cheap dedicated gpu ( like the 260 ) - that is unless you want to build something into a small case without gpu . 
  well if you did n't turn cool 'n' quet and other power saving measures in bios then your pc is automatically underclocking when idle - so it doesnt really make much sense . 
  damn ... and i thought my scythe ninja 3 is big :( http://www.scythe-eu.com/uploads/tx_cfamooflow/ninja-3-viewfront1_04.jpg, 
   maybe get a cheaper cpu ( i3/fx6300 ) so you can have money for gpu ? 
   why you guys keep getting those wifi cards ? 
  pcs are stationary - do n't be lazy and run a cable to it . 
  you 'll thank me later ( and you 'll save money ... ), 
  honestly those guys saying that g3258 is better than 860k are full of ----- ... fanboyism . 
  860k is considerably better overall cpu :, 
  the pentium does win in some games ( older titles or games that are poorly threaded ) but 860k has more overall power and will win in newer titles ( heck some games even refuse to run on the pentium - such as dragon age or far cry 4 ) . 
  you are losing potential of upgradability though so keep that in mind ( new carrizo athlon will propably come but that wont be imho meaningful upgrade ) - but most people i know ussually build a pc and then keep it without changing anything for atleast 3-4 years and by that time its ussualy just better to get the new platform . 
   that pentium at 4.7 ghz is runing on ridicilously high voltage - that will seriously shorten its lifespan - safe o.c. 
  might be around 4.3 / 4.4 - so those overclocking benchmarks do n't really make any sense . 
  and keep in mind he was overclocking it on top of the line z97 mobo not some cheap h81 mobos those pentiums are ussualy paired with . 
   i do n't trust cinebench one iota - there was a court case few years ago - cinebench was using intel compiler that made intel cpus look a lot better in benchmarks - sorry but that is not a company i would trust . 
   he benchmarked last-gen console ports made for 3thread of x360 . 
  what about showing some properly threaded games ... 
  now devs are finaly starting to develop for 8core systems so we 'll see more threaded games in the future . 
  g3258 might be better for some games today , but 860k is better overall cpu ( not just gaming ) that will be better tomorow . 
  nope that is the only problem with the athlon ( new athlons will be coming next year but they 'll be propably just marginally better ( + -10 % and more power efficient - my guess no official benchmarks yet and that imho doesnt warrant an upgrade ) - you are very limited with upgrades - so if you know you are gon na want to upgrade your cpu soon ( ish ) go with the pentium . 
  but to be honest selling ( ebay/craigslist ) the mobo will recoup you majority of the cost anyway . 
  those fm2 + make pretty damn good htpcs so i would expect them to hold value ( new carrizo apus are coming to that platform ) . 
  except ubisoft is nvidia partner :-) :-) but good joke :-), 
  its a bad idea anyway . 
  sell your old one and get a stronger single gpu - trust me . 
  agreed . 
  the fx6300 has overall better performance - there is simply no discussion about it . 
  yes it is harder to extract the performance from it but we are seeing more and more multithreaded software . 
  if you want to just game then for now i3 might be better for you - but the difference in games is not really big and i 'd rather lose few fps in games today to gain performance in games and apps tomorow . 
  - just a little thought experiment how many people today are running just games ? 
  - if i am running a game 90 % of the time i listen to some youtube podcasts / watch stuff on second screen and have bunch of other processes run in the background - those extra cores are handy - thanks to them i have faster multitasking , can alt tab faster and stuff . 
  if i am correct intel cpus can go safely up to 90-100c . 
  cause they are soldered ussualy - its cheaper then to make a socket and it is also thinner so the laptop can be nicer . 
  i remember seeing lots of amd laptops with socketed cpus which were changeble but that was a long time ago . 
  well i would buy only parts that last and dont change too much in value in time - ie . 
  case , psu , hdd , memory . 
  i am not really a server guy . 
  but just theoretically would n't it make more sense just to buy fx8350 ( less cores but higher clocks ) and good quality am3 + mobo ? 
  they do support ecc ram as well . 
  and can be had much cheaper ( not sure if they can be run 24/7 for long times though ), 
  290 is the best deal imho at this time - 290x/970 is not much of perf jump for a lot of money . 
  but if you want to be playing at higher than 1080p then i guess it makes sense . 
  anyway if you can wait i would wait for 300 - amd is cooking something with hbm which just might be groundbreaking :-),
