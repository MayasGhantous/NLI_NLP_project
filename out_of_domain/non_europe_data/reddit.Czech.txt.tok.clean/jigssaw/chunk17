  i 'd get r9 270 - its a lot better card for similar price + you get free games ( and better psu so you wo n't have to upgrade it next time :-) ), 
   i think to be fair when building these builds we should n't include `` rebates '' - they are just pain to deal with . 
   also isnt xbox one now 350 $ ? 
  building 400 $ pc that beats ps4 is too easy imho : -- ) we should try harder :d, 
  really ? 
  i thought they were supposed to be making money on hw this gen :-d, 
  btw : they are rumors about amd doing 20nm shrink + maybe hbm to lower cost for the consoles . 
  so well see :-), 
  well according to asus that is not the case with your board :-( that is a shame . 
  my m4a89gtd pro usb3 is running fx8350 right now :-) i had to set almost all voltages mannuly cause the board was overdoing it but it works ( fx8350 is n't even officially supported - only bulldozer cpus show up in the supported cpu list and they have `` beta '' next to them :d :d ), 
  funny thing is that board still has ide header ... so theoretically you could have killer gaming machine booting of like 15 + year old hdd :d :d :d, 
  its kinda complicated : i am running fx8350 in am3 ( not plus ) mobo which is not officially supported and i had to set allmost all of my voltages manualy cause the board did n't know what to set and was overdoing it ... 
  well the thing is my board set cpu/nb voltage @ 1.5 v which seems crazy in comparison with other guys running the same cpu ( 1.18 v ussually ) . 
  i know ussual stuff about unstability in the os . 
  i just want to know if i dial it whole 0.3 v down if it ca n't cause other bad things ( like damaging the nb or not being able to get into bios ), 
  not yet - currently i am running seasonic 620w semi modular psu . 
  propably will upgrade to 700/750w one . 
  any good tips on quiet ones ? 
   think that amd would make more money if they just used the intel sockets for their desktop cpus ? 
  because i would definitely buy an amd cpu if i coul, 
  they ca n't . 
  it would be :, 
  a ) illegal ( propably ) . 
  b ) intel controls the chipset so they can say with which cpus the mobo will work . 
  i used to have corsair before the seasonic and it made electric noise - so i returned it - coul 've just been a bad unit ... but i kinda would n't buy more . 
  yes, 
  this !, 
  alien isolation on ocullus rift ? 
  whaaaaat !!!!, 
  holy crap i can hardly play the game in dark room with headphones ... 
  i ` de be scared shitless with oculus :d, 
  its glorious for the money :-), 
  there are software apps that help you manage that - i use one of those to undervolt my trinity laptop ... but bios level support would be much much much appreciated, 
  actually i think it might be the other way around and the bios is just crazy and might be damaging my board/cpu with those ridicilously high voltages . 
  less voltage =  less heat =  less strain on the parts =  longer lifespan . 
  anyway i undervolted it as much as i could without it getting unstable ( actually found some forum with people having the same cpu and mobo and got into the same numbers they have :-) ), 
  yep that is what happens to me too . 
  and it pisses me off a lot :-(, 
  the 290 is imho better value for the money . 
  890gx i am actually thinking about repurposing it once i upgrade - for htpc ( if i can find some nice slim full atx cases - nobody seems to be making them :-( ) 45w 2ghz dualcore semprons can be had for few bucks off ebay - theyll be silent with my spare stock fx cooler and the board has decent igpu that can handle 1080p video just fine + i have couple of ide hdds laying around doing nothing so i could even get without spending any money on drives . 
  overall i am very glad i had n't cheapened out when buying it 4years ago cause if i bought some cheaper one i would n't be able to now run fx inside and would have to buy a new one . 
  not sure about the pricing but i would check those 16core opteron cpus / or xeon ones they might give you more performance . 
  either that or 8350 + 290 + rest, 
  gpu-z google that, 
  i 'd suggest you do n't do stupid pointless thing such as watercooling a ultrabudget cpu ( and single 120mm rad liquid coolers arent any better than good aircooler - they are actually worse cause the pump can break where as hunk of copper and aluminium will last you forever ) . 
  and rather put the money into better cpu . 
  also i wouldnt spend close to 100 $ on a case in 600 $ pc build but suit yourself :-), 
  something more reasonable :,

  get this and buy cpu cooler later if you need one . 
  nothing wrong bit spending too much on a case :-) it will stay with you loooong enough . 
  but still rather get an i3 or locked i5 with cheap mobo than this pentium and watercooler ... 
  that pentium is overhyped as hell - its a chip that can game pretty well for its price not a good cpu for gaming - it will strugle with doing everything else ( forget watching stuff on other monitor or doing anything in the background ) . 
  fx-6300 - 6cores @ 3.9 ghz and overclockable @ 100 $ ... yes that is one hell of a deal . 
  according to passmark it will spank similarly priced i3 ( 4130 ) by whooping 45 % in multithreaded performance . 
  but you might lose some gaming performance today . 
  ( however newer games - when x360 / ps3 gets dropped should be heavily threaded as xbone and ps4 have 8core cpus . ), 
  i was under the impression that you have to have k processor and z87/97 chipset to overclock . 
  problems are that arent many good matx am3 + boards ( actually 0 i would reccomend ) - http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-motherboard-760gmap34fx, 
  is propably the best you can get on pcpartpicker ... 
  that pentium is pretty damn good cpu for its price i have to agree - i just worry a little because its just 2cores without ht - and there are already two games here ( far cry 4 , dragon age ) which refuse to run on anything lower than 4 threads . 
  hopefully devs will fix it . 
  ... that board has support for that tdp cpu so it would work fine just fine - you might not overclock it or only a slightly but it would work . 
  - now if your argument would be that the board is crappy cause its missing a lot of features we expect from 2014 platform than you would be right . 
  what drivers are you talking about ? 
  also i call bullshit on your first statement - web browsers can utilize multiple threads ( do n't tell me i am the only one who has 20 tabs open in his browser with a youtube video and simoultanously doing other stuff + antivirus scan running in the background - if we are talking strictly 90 % of people - people that do n't game - they would be better served by piledriver ... because their apps do n't need that much per core performance ), 
  1.375 v is the vcore voltage ( i have it actually undervolted right now running at 4.25 ghz 1.344 / 1.356 ( jumps between those two values - for some reason my fsb jumps between 200.63 and 202.24 - any idea why is this happening ? ), 
  i was talking about cpu/nb voltage which is for most people 1.18 v, 
  i am running fx8350 at m4a89gtd pro ( yes old am3 board ) which doesnt even have official support for it - undervolted and slightly overclocked . 
  - so maybe you just lost in the silicon lottery . 
  btw : if the chip isnt stable at stock shouldnt you be able to rma ? 
  devs are still developing for x360 ps3 . 
  when they stop doing that maybe we can see some improvements :-), 
  well as i said up there - buying the cheapest board is not a good idea . 
  anyway i was trying to be real with the overclocks and i think 100mhz bump on that fx8350 should n't be isseu on any board . 
  fx6300 is 95w chip so pushing it a bit should n't really be an issue on 125w board .
