  ... ever heard of rma ? 
  lol that was stupid ... here is the original link http://imgur.com/dv4wlvd,f0hl0kz,zjpayad,z9i3grd,mlwgnnp,umqpz2p,ogdo63v#0, 
  about the boards - unless you plan to do dual gpu i would go with the cheaper one . 
  that is the main difference + slightly better audio and some other gimmicky `` gaming '' features . 
  ( and of course the looks ), 
  this is comparison based on price . 
  which is basically the only comparison that makes sense . 
  the architectures are too different . 
  if i start small fft test on 4 threads only it also doesnt underclock . 
  is it even cause for concern ? 
  are there any real world scenario where something like this would matter ? 
  or can i just say to hell with it and try to overclock it more . 
  could n't find a way to pm you ( i am sort of new to reddit ) - my skype is `` radek-trio '', 
  be sure to check asus / google . 
  to find out if that will even work out on your board . 
  and be ready to fiddle a bit with it :-), 
  i have to agree amd drivers on linux are not very good . 
  but it looks like they are going in the right direction now ( they are opensourcing part of thjeir drivers - or i read about it ), 
  to me the point where one computer becomes different one and not just upgrade is if i upgrade motherboard and cpu at once . 
  yes its kinda arbitrary but that 's the way i see it :-), 
  but i indeed agree its very hard to tell . 
  the cheapest way to use the optical drive ( unless its sata one ) is through usb adapter/caddy from ebay . 
  i use dropbox - it automatically saves them inside my dropbox folder :-), 
  exactly ... get 760k/860k depending on your mobo, 
  i 'd go with am1 build - its 25w soc - can be cooled passively , has enough of an oomph to do what you need and its very very cheap .

  this with 4gb of ddr3 memory and any hdd you can find even something ancient like 40gb should be enough wouldnt bother with ssd . 
  any psu you can find ( the lower wattage the better - psus are not efficient when used at like 10 % of their rating . 
  btw : they will be launching these socs without igpu soon so maybe wait for that and save another 10-20 $ ( pure speculative - but they have to be cheaper :d ), 
  something like this could be your full build,

  so you think it would be profitable for mobo maker to send every person like 3new mobos ... ? 
  dont be ridicilous ... 
  well i do n't want to go into conspiration theories ... but you know that ubisoft is `` the way it 's meant to be played '' ... - atleast the quote about amd hardware being cause of it could be attributed to that . 
  anyway - there are lot of game engines and the most famous/not proprietary are multithread optimized ( and a lot of them even support mantle - which is part of what makes it possible - in dx11 you cant really multithread rendering ) - ea 's frostbite , cryengine , unity and many more support mantle and unreal 4 sure as hell is gon na be optimized for multithread . 
  they do n't have to pay for crossfire support . 
  + crossfire can run in pcie 4x where as sli needs atleast 8x, 
  i would advise you to get 8350 or good cpucooler + mobo and overclock the 8320 . 
  the price differebce isnt that huge ( hell you cant even get the lowliest locked i5 for the price of 8350 ) and you need the higher clocks to compensate for low singlecore peformance . 
  also amd radeon cards are much better in that price range - so i would get that ( that could even compansate the price diff between 8320 and 8350 ) . 
  lots of people are gon na reccomend you to get an i5 vs the 8350 - yes you 're gon na get more singlethreaded performance which will help you in badly optimized games but you 'll be losing 40 + % multithreaded performance when using all cores ( vs i5 4400 which is 20 $ more expensive than the 8350 and the comparison with i3 is not even worth mentioning ) . 
  and with software getting more and more multithreaded i think the tradeoff is not worth it . 
  well the r9 290 have the benefits of xdma crossfire and framepacing - therefore no stutter . 
  radeons also operate better at higher resolutions ( compared to nvidia in same price range - that will help them to catch up ) because of higher memory bandwidth . 
  i would actually advise you to get 2x 290 and see if you are not sattisfied . 
  according to benchmarks 2x290x ( only slightly better than 290 ) are trading blows with sli 980 at 4k so i think the 290 should do the same with 970 . 
  yes the do need more power but if you have well ventilated case you are better off just getting them and switching like 2 incondescent lightbulbs in your house :d, 
  i know about it - they even called their cpus the same as intels ( well almost for instance am486 vs i486 ) . 
  i read that was the reason for naming the next cpu pentium - so they could trademark it and amd couldnt use it - cause you cant trademark a number - well atleast thats what i read . 
  crossfire does n't require licensing - atleast that is what linus said in a video about it . 
  also in crossfirex you get bridges ( not anymore now for new cards ) with the cards where as sli bridges are supplied by the mobo vendor . 
  thats what i meant - they do n't charge for it . 
  if you do n't mind them having slightly different properties ( such as one might be brighter have nicer colors , or ghost more ) then its ok . 
  well for instance i have 2 ips panels one 24 '' lg 1080p 16:9 and one 19 '' 1280x1024 5:4 and ca n't really manage to balance them ( or basically i could but i would have to make my main monitor dimmer and not so vibrant and i dont want to do that ... ) . 
  but its just a slight difference and i do n't really mind it . 
  yes . 
  you might not able to overclock that cpu depending on what board you have . 
  keep in mind that with amd card you get alien isolation for free ... + 2 more games - look up never settle promotion . 
  if i already hadnt had 7970ghz i 'd buy the shit out of this ... 
  i know they are the same cards essentialy . 
  but :, 
  1 ) i am happy with one . 
  2 ) dont have enough wattage psu to support 2, 
  3 ) would have to upgrade cpu anyway to not be bottlenecked, 
  it did - i bought m4a89gtd am3 motherboard ( top of the line 890 chipset ) when building my phenomii rig 4 + years ago - and boom asus released beta bios to support fx cpus on that mobo ( it only did on a few of 890 mobos ) so yeah i did n't have to buy a new mobo and the same mobo now runs my 8350 . 
  but it was kind off luck - i did n't really buy it because of that and couldnt have known - i just liked that mobo because it had sata3 usb3 and stuff :-), 
  what psu does that emachines have inside ? 
  you are upgrading a desktop arent you ? 
  why not just reuse the case ? 
  imho 6gb is enough - 8 would be nicer, 
  this would be better,

  ... well you could try to do some apu build - that way you wouldnt have to buy new case/psu . 
  you 'd save some money and get sff pc . 
  but cpu+gpu combo will get you better performance - this build would be like 720/1080 mid details .
