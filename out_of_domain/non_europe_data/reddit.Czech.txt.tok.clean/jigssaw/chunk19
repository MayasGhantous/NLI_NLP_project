  i3 are just a bad deal ... do n't bother with that . 
  either get pentium k ( you can atelast overclock that one ) or i5 - if you want something in between your best bet is athlon 860k / fx 6300 . 
  if only think you are concerned about is gaming today . 
  then i3 is an okay cpu . 
  if you care more about overall system performance , multithreading or longevity then nope . 
  fx6300 is 85 $ i3 4130 i 99 $ - and the fx is, 
   a ) unlocked and overclockable, 
   b ) has 45 % more multithreaded performance . 
  sorry but i do n't think trading a little bit of gaming performance today is n't worth it to get 45 % more performance for other tasks and potentionally a lot better gaming performance in the future . 
  and upgradability is overrated - by the time most people upgrade their pcs the sockets are already dead anyway and its lot better deal to just buy a new mobo with new features . 
  yep that build has estimated wattage of 150w so you should be ok . 
  cpu and gpu combos ( i meant separate cpu and gpu just to clarify ) for that you would need bigger psu and new case . 
  but something like the build a posted before ( 760k + radeon 270x would give you considerably better performance ) . 
   i think you overestimate the amount of `` overall system performance '' that is dependent on multithread performance . 
  most software outside video and 3d rendering is still single or double threaded at best . 
  ok ... so i guess we are back in dos days where multitasking did n't exist . 
  i bet i am not the only one who uses more than one application at a time - i.e. 
  i regularly play games with some youtube video running on a second monitor + possibly antivirus/filetransfers/downloading and lots of other stuff going on in the background . 
   when is this magical time coming that the 6300 will suddenly become a better gaming cpu ? 
  when xbox360/ps3 go away and dx11 goes away . 
  problem with dx11 is that drawcalls cant be multithreaded properly and that is one of the main reasons why most games overlly use one thread over others . 
   amd a10-7850k is an apu - that means cpu+gpu integrated into single piece of silicon . 
  ( its litle more complicated due to hsa now - gpu cores can do computing independently but that doesnt really matter atleast for now - it will when software devs start to use this ability and it has great potential ) . 
  it is a compromise that offers ok cpu performance and ok gpu performance in very small package that is efficient - doesnt use up much power . 
  that cpu is weak . 
  this would give you almost twice the cpu performance and not much more expensive ( got rid of dvd drive cause that is useless ) .

  of course it will benefit i3 aswell . 
  but i think we can agree that i3 shines because it has better singlethread performance than fx . 
  where as fx has considerable lead if all of its cores get utilized . 
  so lets just say that if you can utilize all of fx cores its a better cpu for you - which might ( or might not ) help it in the future - there are certain trends but we ca n't predict the future . 
  the igpu in a10 is somewhere between r7 240 and r7 250 - low-to-mid end dgpu ( you can even use that a10 with r7 240 and run both of the gpu at the same tine using `` dualgraphics '' ), 
  nope you just use usb flash drive to install os :-) ( you need to have an acces to a other pc to do that though ), 
  well actually if you look at benches from like 2012 and benches today you see that fx cpus got a bit better ( partially thanks to windows 8 and to games being more threaded ) . 
  anyway i 'd also like to point out - that when building such a budget system ( with lowend i3 or fx6300 ) you are not gon na be pairing r9 295x2 gpu ... but something more mainstream - like 270x/280 and in those cases in most games the difference will be negligible ( you are gon na be gpu bottlenecked ) . 
  so those cpus will perform on par in gaming ( in most games ) where as fx will pull ahead in those applications that will utilize all of its cores . 
  this is the software you need, 
  budget ? 
  you ca n't reall upgrade that board so your best bet would be getting an entirely new mobo + apu . 
  this is like the cheapest you can do right now that makes any sense :,

  that would make a gaint upgrade for you, 
  and it will run silent ( 25w tdp can even be cooled passively ) . 
  it will do light gaming just fine . 
  if you want to go little bit better then this would be very noticable upgrade in gaming performance .

  both those build arent obviously gon na be able to play @ 1080p with good visuals and high framerates - but at lower resolutions you will get ok performance which is propably what you are after anyway :-), 
  if this is too much for you then the only way is to go secondhand and try to buy some older hw - since that build of yours is ancient almost everything will be a noticable upgrade :-), 
  twice the cpu power ... athlon x4 860k . 
  and that cpu cooler aint much better than the stock one so just dont bother ... 270 is much better than 750ti in the same price range + you get free games with never settle forever . 
  and dvd drives are worthless - just install os with usb flash drive .

  since you are just splitting 12v rail from psu to the fans there is no way to control/monitor them with bios ...
