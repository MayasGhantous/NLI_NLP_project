  if you are skilled with electronics you can reduce the speed with which they run to by lowering voltage - either through putting resistos or getting them to run on 7v instead of 12v ( +12 v +5 v gets you 7v difference ) . 
  or just get a fan controller . 
  ----- or get pwm fan splitter ( if you have 4 pin fans ) . 
  this is total overkill ... 
  when somebody says media pc i think of :, 
  am1 athlon 5350 25watt quadcore + 4gb of ram and dirth cheap miniitx board and a small ssd ... . for like 200 $ that my friend is enough for 4k video ... so i do n't know what kind of media do you want to play when you need 760 to do it . 
  well maybe post your build :d, 
  the psu should be perfectly fine for the first build . 
  for the second one i am not 100 % sure - depends on the internar division of psu rails ( one 12v rail is 16a other is only 5a ) . 
  the case will be ok unless its some proprietary prebuilt pc ( like dell ) . 
  well you could get another cpu that will fit that mobo ... from 2005 which would be few percent better than what you have ... just try to put it on ebay and hope somebody will give you few $ for it . 
  what kind of screen do you have ( resolution ) ? 
  you can get psu that is not modular - they are ussualy a bit cheaper and modular ones are not really needed unless you want to have a case with a window and show off :-), 
  also you can get r9 280 instead of 285 they are about the same performance 280 is cheaper - but doesnt have true audio support which is imho not really a deal breaker ( there are like 2 games out now with true audio ), 
  + cheaper case, 
  it wont look so pretty but it will perform pretty much the same at much lower price :,

  imho 280 is enoug for 1080p . 
  does it run cs : go ? 
  am1 athlon 5350 and reuse what you can . . mayebe get small ssd, 
  well you kinda did the build i just shed some unnecesary cost from it :-) with this build you should be play anything @ med/high 1080p, 
  compared to cpus they are priced against ( 6300 against lowend locked i3 and 8350 against lowend locked i5 ) they have lower singlethread ( so they will lose in gaming benchmarks for now ) performance but around 40 % better multithreaded performance . 
  they are not bad cpus and they have their uses , what really holds them down is the crap motherboard choice due to ancient chipsets ( from like 2009-2011 ) . 
  imho 6870 is still good enough to give you good experience @ 1080p ( medium ) so if i 'd were you i 'd wait for a few months :-), 
  thing is the decent chipsets are too expensive - and when shopping for a budget cpu the i3/i5 have the advantage of cheap boards with sata 3 and usb3, 
  when building a rig for friend two months ago i went with gigabyte 280 ... and it is artifacting - gon na be returning it soon . 
  my gigabyte 7970ghz ( which i bought used ) started artifacting slightly recently but shaving off few mhz of the overclock helped . 
  i propably wo n't gon na be buying any gigabyte card any soon - it seems like they are one of the cheapest and with highest o.c. 
  ... something seems too good to be true . . 
  should they also make it mandatory to use one ? 
  the problem is n't that they do n't have a mic ... its that they do n't have ussualy do n't a brain . 
  and do n't understand that individual score matters a little if they do n't have any know about of tactics and get the score by lucky rushing , never following the team and doing stupid shit . 
  and even worse those players are ussualy so toxic that just by having a mic namecalling and spaming chat they distract everybody else ... 
  can i buy it outside of us ? 
  aaaah shit ... bastards do n't accept payment from non-us site . 
  can anybody buy one for me ? 
  i 'd gladly send you the money on paypal, 
  i have the same build pretty much :d ... 
  but to be honest 8350 with 7970ghz are pretty much balanced so you would propably have to upgrade both . 
  but as for me - i wo n't bother with it for atleast another year ( i want to see if games finally start actually using the cores i own :d and i do n't want to go intel just to buy new cpu which will perform worse in some scenarios ( multithreading ) to me that is n't an upgrade but a sidegrade . 
  can you rma ? 
  when i bought a psu about 4 years ago it did the same thing ... 
  i returned it within a few days . 
  ortherwise you could theoretically mod it ( if its not under warranty ) - some part propebly got loose and its vibrating . 
  exactly ... 
  290 is the same at 4k and only slightly worse then 970 on lower res ( few % ) . 
  get a 290 - if that is n't enough for you ... get another one . 
  should be plug and play, 
  imho it should work just fine - worst case scenario is you gon na have to set multiplier/voltage manualy - not hard if you already overclock, 
  very nice . 
  get bigger psu so you can overclock - like + -600 watt . 
  wow is pretty badly optimized for multicore cpus ( its a fricking 10year old game already ... ooooh the time flies ) so you might want to go intel if you want to max it - but this cpu will run it pretty good aswell and has bigger multithreaded performance ( + -40 % ) vs similarly prized intel and is unlocked and overclockable . 
  in that price range ( 400 vs 500 ) every dollar more spend pays off - so yeah i wouldnt go for the nextgen crusher, 
  the question is will this be changed right away ? 
  or can they use it again tomorrow ? 
  you 're welcome, 
  dreamhack rules state that every round where teams did something illegal should be forfeited to the other team ... so i guess one round goes to fanatic and like ten of them to ldlc ... happy ? 
  guys where can i match this match ? 
  i had to go away in the middle and i want to watch it . 
  yeah just i just fricking loled when i heard about ps4 ... like seriously ps fucking 4 giveaway for one of the best pc players ? 
  exactly !, 
  :d like one of the best cs players is gon na want to play shooters on a gamepad :d, 
  you wot m8 ? 
  well why would a professional pc gamer be excited about a shitty ps4 ... 
  my friends !, 
  well taht is actually a good point :d but anyway it was imho prety poor choice to have a give away about which like 0 % of community gave a fuck in a middle of the ceremony ... 
  well i 've watched almost all the matches and nothing dropped for me :( is it normal or did i do something wrong ? 
  well i wouldnt call it a natural monopoly ... there is nothing natural about intel having patented x86 isa and only other companies who have x86 licenses are amd and via ( mostly embedded ) . 
  so nobody else can made modern x86 cpu . 
  but look at arm/mips that is semi open ecosystem where a lot of companies design their own processors - qualcomm , apple , samsung , nvidia , arm itself , imagination and maybe more i do n't know of ... so it doesnt really have to be natural monopoly :-), 
  well yes but there are x86 extensions which are not expired . 
  and without those extension ( sse , sse2 , sse3 , avx and so on ) that cpu will not be capable of running any modern software ... . and by the time they expire i guess there are gon na be more of them :-) :-), 
  am1 is better for this, 
  aw that sucks :(, 
   plated usb connector ensures stable and optimum signal transfer . 
  my mouse 's connector is gold plated too , but it 's the bigg, 
  i have even seen gold plated connectors on fricking optical cables :d, 
  thx for that info . 
  i just bought razer deathadder 2013 and will pick it up friday, 
  while this might be truth for some single player games it is not the case for highly compettitive multiplayer shooter such as cs , where every milisecond of delay counts . 
  you need minimum stable 60fps and more is better .
