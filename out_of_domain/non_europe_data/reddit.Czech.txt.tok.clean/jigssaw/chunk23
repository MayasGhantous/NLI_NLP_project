  desktop will come later . 
  i would propably get 8350 ( i upgraded my phenom x4 965 to it which is about the same as your cpu ) and i am happy with the purchase - and i did n't have to get a new mobo so thats a plus - 8350 are really cheap right now . 
  i was running ma 965 @ 3.7 ghz and yes there was difference in gaming ( for instance wolfenstein new order changed from 30-60 fps all the time no matter the settings to stable 60fps in 90 % of the scenes . 
  but the main difference i felt was that the cpu is running much quitter and cooler ( i am now clocked @ 4.3 ghz ) and it has bunch of spare power when multitasking ( i am running dual-monitor setup so i have games + bunch of other stuff on frequently ) . 
  but for instance i ca n't get satisfiyng results in rome ii total war so the difference is n't huuuuuge . 
  and if i had to get new mobo i would propably keep my 965 for some time longer . 
  ( my old am3 asus 890 mobo supported 8350 with bios update so yeah :p - funny thing is that my chipset is actually newer than bunch of them on am3 + boards - some even have 780 chipset which is from the days of phenom and athlon 64 fx am2 + :d :d - i actually find it really amazing how compatible amd stuff is ), 
  all console players would play with flamethrowers ; problem solved :d, 
  maybe just maybe if you compared new 8350 the difference wouldnt be so big - afterall it is on very matured proccess so i would expect it to be better than the first few they made :-), 
  well to be honest ... in my own little experiences with pc hardware - it is either doa ( or somehow not functioning correctly - i.e. 
  ram has errors/gpu artifacts ) - or it greatly outlasts its usefulness . 
  - so yeah i do n't have problem buying gpu/cpu/ram / mobo used . 
  currently running hd7970 ghz edition i bought used -- works like a charm and it will 99 % work till the time i upgrade and i can sell it to someone for who the power of it is enough :-), 
  do you really think that those kind of repairs would make sense today ? 
  - except for something rudementary like replacing a capacitator i do n't see it being profitable . 
  i would strongly advise you against buying something like that - buying low end gpus is not a good deal - you do n't get enough for your money - you are better off just buying old secondhand gpu or using integrated one . 
  if i were you i would build some apu based system - something like this,

  this is more than enough for minecraft and it should play old gen games just fine :-), 
  no it doesnt . 
  your buying an old 2 generations old apu - rather weak cpu bundled with rather weak gpu . 
  and then you buy a very good gpu ... . 
  you can either replace the 5800k with athlon 860k and keep the rest . 
  or get even better cpu ( and different mobo ) - either fx6350 8350 or i5 depending on your budget, 
  btw as for the gpu - xfx is better than gigabyte . 
  xfx is amd only vendor and it has lifetime warranty for the gpu . 
  depends on your cpu choice ... 
  much better and same price,

  laptops would benefit the most imho - cause to run ddr3 @ 2400mhz you need high voltages :-) and oyu really cant do that in a laptop . 
  if you can wait its always better to wait if you need a card now 290 4gb are better bang for your buck and should be enough :-), 
  8gb shouldnt be needed unless you want crossfire two of them, 
  amd chips are consistently better than intel chips at the same price if you can utilize all the cores ( i.e. 
  multithreaded benchmark ) . 
  problem is a lot of people ca n't utilize all the cores so they are not for everybody . 
  proof : www.passmark.com, 
  still eyefinity has better support than sorround ( you can use different size monitor together ), 
  i3 4130 vs fx6300 ( + -100 $ ), 
  i3 4360 vs fx8320 ( + -130 $ ), 
  i5 4440 vs fx8350 ( + -170 $ ), 
  so yeah if you can utilize all of the cores then amd equivalent is better if you ca n't than intel is better . 
  and all of those amd cpus are unlocked so you can overclock them where as those from intel are locked . 
  well there is almost no money in building pcs ... in repairing pcs/upgrading pcs zou can charge people :-p, 
  depends on your price-range and usage scenario . 
  if you can utilize the cores then amd is better than equivalently priced intel chip ( + its unlocked where as equivalent is locked ) . 
  more times than not i see intel fanboys reccomending lowly i3 and silly cpus like that `` because intel '' . 
  tdp does n't really matter - what matters when choosing psu is powerconsumption ( they are related ) . 
  according to measurements done by tomshardware 970 has average power consumption of 176w which is indeed very low ... 
  but there is small litle problem - it achieves it by jumping between 100w and 290w ... so unless you want to have problems you need to accomodate for maximum possible power draw when buying your psu anyway - ( 290x has highest power consumption of 295w according to tomshardware ) . 
  so yeah i would not advise you putting 970 into a prebuilt ... 
  heck ... 
  i would call myself heavy gamer and and still i do n't see a problem with 8gb . . ( i even have another 2x2gb in my drawer - the only reason i do n't want to put it inside is because i would have to take my fan off my heatsink and i do n't really need it :d, 
  indeed indeed . 
  of course i am generalizing . 
  and talking about their current ( aging lineup ) . 
  and yes the pentium changed the lanscape a little bit ( i would still rather buy 860k for 80 $ than pentium for 65 $ but if you want to spend 65 $ and not more then pentium is really great chip ) . 
  but it still makes sense to buy amd in the 100-200 $ price range . 
  i3 4130 vs fx6300 ( + -100 $ ), 
  i3 4360 vs fx8320 ( + -130 $ ), 
  i5 4440 vs fx8350 ( + -170 $ ), 
  so yeah if you can utilize all of the cores then amd fx equivalent is better if you ca n't than intel is better . 
  and all of those amd cpus are unlocked so you can overclock them where as those from intel are locked . 
  not to mention that a some people already have am3 + compatible motherboard and not even know about it - the chances are if you owned phenom ii before and didnt skimp on the mobo that your am3 can support fx with a simple bios update ( that was my case :-) ) . 
  amd is really famous for their compatibility - i recently upgraded oooold 95nm single core athlon 64 2ghz to 45nm phenom ii quad on the same am2 motherboard using the same ddr2 memory :-) heck some cheap am3 + boards still use those ancient chipsets from the am2 + days . 
  not sure if / s ... :-) but a4 line up imho does n't make sense at all . 
  on that extreme budget i would rather get some cheap pentium to have some more cpu grunt for the spreadsheet and intel hd can do 1080p video as well so no need for more gpu power in that price range . 
  a8 on the other hand do make sense for some light gamers on extreme budget . 
  a10 depending on the price but ussualy you might be better off buying cheap cpu + dgpu . 
  i was talking more about i3 vs fx6300 / fx6350 / fx8320 . 
  cause they all have significantly more multithreaded power and are unlocked so you can overclock them a lot . 
  indeed - in the ideal world you could create a benchmark based on your specific daily tasks ... but in the meantime we have to make do with what we have :-), 
  well i would think its fairer to compare 2 chips based by price than to compare lets say 200 $ i5 quad against 70 $ fx4130 quad ... :-), 
  and yes in some cases the i3 would be better and in other the fx would be better . 
  but if you get the fx you will be able to shave a lot off the single core perf benefits of i3 by simply overclocking - i3 dont have unlocked multiplier . 
  so imho it makes sense . 
  but if you are person who doesnt overclock and doesnt multitask a lot then the i3 is better for you . 
  the hardware does n't really matter - regular customer doesnt care if his cpu is made on what litography process or how much cache or ghz does it have what matters is the performance . 
  how the performance is attained is secondary .
