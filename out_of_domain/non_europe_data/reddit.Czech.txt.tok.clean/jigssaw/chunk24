  so i 'll say what i said before again if you can utilize all of its core then amd fx cpu is better than similarly priced intel . 
  + you can overclock that fx cpu where as intel equivalent has locked multiplier . 
  which means in more cases than not the fx cpu will have better performance . 
  and yes sure you can compare hdd to an ssd - `` while the ssd is so much faster the hdd offers a lot bigger capacity '' . 
  done . 
  that should be ok - the whole system should be like 50w + the gpu so you are good to go . 
  just keep in mind that you should look at maximum power draw when picking a psu/gpu/cpu combination . 
  tdp is just how much heat does it make not how much power it consumes - sure they are related but they are not the same :-) . 
  pc mark home conventional is not a benchmark that measures multithreaded performance - it is a micture of multithreaded and single threaded task that normal user would propably do . 
  and since i3 is better in some ways and fx is better in other ways it makes sense that both of them would have + - the same score . 
  i was simply saying that if you can use all the cores amd is better . 
  that cpu is too bad for your monster of a gpu . 
  if you want to stick with amd ( which imho makes sense in this budget ) get atleast 6300/6350 and switch that gpu for 280 instead.also get a after market cpu cooler . 
  this would be lot more balanced,

  you were quicker :-) but yes this indeed another possibility . 
  4300 + 290 just doesnt go together . 
  are you sure you would n't solve your problem by simply overclocking your cpu more ? 
  ... 970 isnt that highend of a card ... and it would save you a lot of money . 
  not to mention lot of the newer games start to utilize the 8cores better than the last gen games . 
  if you are building gaming rig then are spending too much of your budget on a cpu and too little on a gpu . 
  get atleast r9 280 they are very good deal right now . 
  and instead of that cpu i would get fx 6350 or if you are intel fan then intel equivalent in that price range ( i.e. 
  higher end i3 or lower end i5 and cheaper mobo ) or if you can spare the cash get the cpu you want + that gpu :-), 
  also get atleast 600 + w psu the difference in price is almost non existant ... and you 'll be future proof, 
  well the benchmarking score isnt really the problem :-) the problem is that those games do n't utilize all of the cores you have and every little bit of single core performance helps ( and that might very well change in the future ) . 
  if i were you i would propably just keep the cpu and get lower end gpu ( wait for 960 or get 280x or something allong those lines ) . 
  because to have an actual cpu upgrade and not just sidegrade you would have to spend a big chunk of money and the cpu you have now is good enough - unless money is no objection and you want to play everything on ultra . 
  you do n't move your pc ... so do n't be lazy and run a cable to it ... its just better in every way . 
  another option - ( if you can sell you 8150 for a good price ) is to upgrade to 8350 - they perform 10-15 % better and are more energy efficient ( you can overclock them more ) . 
  but first try overclocking that 8150 to its limits :-), 
  get 8350 thats the best you can get on your mobo no sense upgrading later the price difference isnt big . 
  carrizo-l propably or maybe carrizo, 
  if you have lower end card just sell it and get a new card that is more powerful - trust me you save yourself a lot of problems . 
  not everygame supports crossfire perfectly . 
  according to reviews 260x crossfire is comparable to one 270x in most games . 
  2x 260x will cost you 200 $, 
  1x 280 ( better in every way ) is even cheaper than that . 
  so just sell your 260x and get 280, 
  not sure how much processing power plex needs but this might be perfect for you .

  i would have no problem trustin 275w power supply to deliver max load of 50w to that system :-), 
  and nope this is low power apu ( can be cooled passively ) made to compete with atoms/nucs - it is about as powerful as the cheapest celeron ( but uses half the power and it has very cheap miniitx mobos ) . 
  i3/i5 are much more powerfull . 
  this will be more than enough for any media playback though and will be enouch for trancoding 1 1080p stream . 
  what makes this very attractive is that you can put it in really really small enclosure ( there are even mobos that have dc jack so you dont need psu you just use laptop charger ) and it can be dead silent . 
  case is up to you . 
  keep in mind space for hdds and such . 
  if you are gon na be just running an ssd you can go for something like the m350 ( really small ) and using, 
  + laptop charger . 
  well if you gon na be running 4k then 290 / 290x crossfire is better then 970 sli so it makes sense in some cases :-), 
  well i for one buy games few months after release when they are on sale so that problem is not applicable to everybody :-), 
  cause we are building gaming rigs ... . and quite honestly if you are using your gpu to game its gon na be running idle most of the time so the power consumption is not very important . 
  if you are using your gpu to compute stuff for very long periods of time then power consumption matters . 
  yes - exactly - this is the only motherboard that has that though ( thats why it is so expensive compared to other ones :-) ) . 
  it has even an adapter to power your ssd so you do n't have to worry about that either . 
  if thats the case get the m350 or similarly tiny case . 
  if you do n't care too much about boot times you could even make it to boot of usb stick which will make the build even cheaper . 
  what are your opinions on just running refs storage space parity array inside your windows pc ? 
  - to my understanding you can mix and match drive sizes and it is easily expandable ( you can add more drives later ) . 
  i do n't need full nas solution yet - everything important to me is stored on multiple machines and dropbox so that is the backup - this would be just for some bulk storage that is not that mission critical ( movies and stuff ) . 
  right now i just have it on a single drive that is samba shared on my network ( and when i need it i use wol to wake my pc - which is fast cause of ssd ) . 
   a benchmark 290x cf vs gtx970 sli . 
   in the gtx970sli vs. 290 cf review that i found the gtx970sli won by a decent margin @ < 4k . 
  so it seems its purely resolution related . 
  any idea why ? 
  imo its because of the higher bandwidth ( 290 are running 512-bit bus vs 256bus nvidia has ), 
  not everybody sure . 
  but the vast majority posts here are asking for a gaming pc . 
  only if youre doing serious work such as video editing a lot . 
  for gaming nope . 
  ( i still run 8gb in my main machine even though i have another 4gb ( 2x2 ) i could put in ... 
  i just cant bother to pull of my fan from heatsink to do it :-) ), 
  yes but that is imo not worth it . 
  1tb drives are `` too expensive '' ( price per gb - get atleast 2tb one youll thank me later ), 
  get atleast 700w so you have room for overclocking / adding stuff later . 
  r9 270 is considerably better at similar price unless you have shitty psu, 
  just a little note :, 
  1tb drives are not a very good deal ( price/gb ) get atleast 2tb - ( 3tb is the best price per gb currently ) . 
  also you might consider getting drives made for nas operation ( for instance seagate nas or wd red ),
