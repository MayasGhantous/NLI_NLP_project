  getting a new gpu would be a must . 
  you need atleast 8gb of ram ( seing as you already have 2x2 i would get another set of dimms 2x4 ) for a total of 12gb which will be future proof . 
  as for cpu you could to get second-hand 2600k which is to this day very nice chip - but honestly i wouldnt bother because your motherboard is kinda-crappy anyway ( no usb3 , no sata3 , support of ddr3 1333 max , no overclocking ) . 
  so i would get new board and i5 or amd 8350 ( depending on your budget - i am not sure how much stuff cost in chf :-) ), 
  ideal buy list :, 
   i5 4690k / 4670k, 
   z97 board ( for overclocking ) with 4 dimm slots, 
   8gb of whatever ram brand you like ( atleast 1600mhz preferably ), 
   amd r9 290 / r9 280x / r9 285 / r9 280, 
   some storage - 2tb seagate sshd might not be a bad idea . 
  do n't get apu - waste of money . 
  id propably get either amd athlon 5350 ( + you dont need cooler for that it is almost dead silent with shitty stock one or you can cool it passively with better one ) ( very low tdp and comparable performance to your cpu you picked ) . 
  some of the pentiums are another good option ( if you need more cpu power than the athlon can deliver ) . 
  all of them are 1.5 v 1600mhz cl9 . 
  that is good . 
  only problem is that 8gigs will not run in dual-channel - so you lose a little tiny bit of performance over 2x4 . 
  otherwise you should be fine . 
  that is actually the only idea that makes sense :d, 
  the case and psu can be salvaged . 
  psu can still power some lowly office machine/htpc ( be sure to clean it first with compressed air and check for bad caps if you gon na use it ) or you can just use it as diy electronics bench power supply . 
  case is propably shit anyway but for some lowtdp/office machine will do just fine ( will look like shit though ) . 
  hdd could theoretically be used with a external usb enclosure - that is propably not worth it though ( heck i have fx8350 machine and my mobo still has ide interface for those old ribbon cables :d so i could even boot from it ... ), 
  if not then you can get cheaper motherboard ( no need for z97 chipset ) and i5 without that k suffix ( but they are ussualy not that cheaper anyway and k one will hold value for potentional resale better ) . 
  also you didnt specify what psu is in that machine - make sure its enough those higher end parts sure want some watts :-), 
  yes for 10 drives you are propably gon na need raid card anyway . 
  i 'd say the story was one of the best i 've seen in video game period . 
  i 'd say either i5 4440 , one of the better i3s or fx6350 / fx8350 . 
  depending on what you gon na do with your pc . 
  ( fx will have + - 40 % more multithreaded performance ( vs similarly priced intel cpu ) and is overclockable , but will strugle in some badly optimized games due to slow singlecore ), 
  if it is only for gaming today then intel is better - on the other hand software ( and games too ) are getting more and more multithreaded so the fx one can theoritacally have more staying power . 
  in that case i 'd get the best i5 you can afford and cheap 1150 mobo ( do n't bother with z97 ), 
  i would propably get a cpu cooler just because it will make it run much quitter and that is what you want from htpc :-) but you dont need it . 
  format the drive and do a fresh install . 
  make sure you write down your vista serial first . 
  ( if you can get win 8.1 licence then upgrade to 8.1 ), 
  did you get reference card or some aftermarket one ( from other vendor like sapphire , msi , xfx ... ) . 
  you cant really do much one way or the other apart from maintaining good airflow in your case . 
  getting a new gpu ( something like r9 270x ) and overclocking that cpu should be enough . 
  if that is not the case you need new cpu aswell . 
  you need to get vista instalation disk somehow - ( feel free to download it off the internet and burn it on a dvd - its perfectly legal if you have the licence key ) . 
  then you need to get into bios and set up your pc to boot off that dvd and then just follow the instalation . 
  not much time left :-) :d, 
  its very similar for vista . 
  in 99 % it doesnt matter ( no difference ) . 
  use the cable you have, 
  i 'd get r9 270 used ( make sure its working though :-) ) - or something from last gen ( like hd7950 or something like that ) . 
  also it would be nice to double your ram ( 8gb is enough ) - the latency and speed of your ram doesnt really matter very much for gaming . 
  core i3 is a dual core with hyperthreading - that means it simulates having 4 cores - it helps to make the 2 cores work 100 % in some scenarios ( as opposed to like 95 % ) . 
  x86 is open now so anybody can make x86 cpus - the problem is that over the years both intel and amd made extensions to it that made it better - some caught on big time some didnt - but you basically ca n't make a x86 cpu that will run modern os without those extensions . 
  as for your question - nope every few years they renew it - why ( because intel needs amd extensions as much as amd needs intels ( maybe even more so ) . 
  according to wiki ( not the best source i know ... :-) ) :, 
  partly ( open ) . 
  for some advanced features , x86 may require license from intel ; x86-64 may require an additional license from amd . 
  the 80486 processor has been on the market for more than 20 years [ 1 ] and so can not be subject to patent claims . 
  the pre-586 subset of the x86 architecture is therefore fully open . 
  features meaning - extensions . 
  which is what i said . 
  amd could theoretically still make 32bit cpus - just without some of the intels extensions - so the performance would propably be bad ( but whatever lets resurect 3dnow and such :d , intel on the other hand would be f ----- roaylly because they would basically lose the server market which is the biggest cash cow ), 
  imo at this budget buying new doesnt make sense . 
  just buy used tower off craigslist . 
  ... that system will pull like 30/40wats when in full load so i do n't a fire with 350w psu is likely . . 
  for everybody thinking about cardboard boxes as cases ... please keep in mind you can get cases ( granted ugly shitty ones - but better than cardboard box ) essentialy for free people are just throwing them away . 
  i bought old full tower case from 2000 for like 5 $ -10 $ and with little bit of diy ( it was fun project ) i made it to be a killer great looking gaming pc case with huge airflow . 
   diablot, 
  well thats a given :-d but i think it wont have any trouble outputting 40wats ( or + -20 wats during 80 % time of the operation ), 
  are the temps ok ?

  the cpu might be little bit controversial but seeing as you only have 500w power supply and gpu that takes a very big chunk out of that i wouldnt go for 8350/6350 ( as they are both 125w tdp ) . 
  also those 8320e are great overclockers so if you get bigger psu and aftermarket cooler later on you would be able to make 8350 out of it easily . 
  1 stick of ram so you can still use atleast the one 2gb you have for total of 10gb which is more than enough for a gaming pc . 
  1tb hdds arent the best price for gb ( 3tb followed by 2tb ) are but budget is too small to pick anything bigger - if you can spare more cash go for 2tb :-), 
  btw your mobo even supports ide so maybe you can scrounge some poor old ide harddrive for next to nothing if you are lucky . 
  4gb of ram would become bottleneck in a lot of games - you could propably get away with 6gb ( geting one 4gb stick and keeping one 2gb ) and he could upgrade the ram later . 
  in that case it might make sense to pickup 6300/6350 with aftermarket cooler and overclocking it ( rather than 95w 8320e ) . 
  most games today wo n't see difference between 6350 and 8350 ( they cant utilize all of the 8cores properly ) - but in future games the 8core version will propably hold up better . 
  does the performance still suck on amd cpus ? 
  according to passmark :, 
  fx has + - 40 % higher multithreaded score at basically all the pricepoints . 
  so yeah if you can use them moar cores its better :-) + all of them are unlocked so you can overclock . 
  280 are very cheap right now and since you are running at lower than 1080p i 'd just buy one . 
  and yes http://www.eteknix.com/amd-gcn-gpus-directx-12-ready/ - all amd gcn ( hd7000 and rx 2xx series ) are directx ready . 
  on the other hand if you can wait and plan on picking a new screen soon i 'd wait for the freesync compatibility . 
  power consumption being equal to performance ?!, 
  if that is really the case why the hell do n't you use fucking odroid c1 or some other 3w arm device instead of your pc ... jesus christ what did we come to . 
  sorry but no - unless i am some one who runs his cpu 100 % everyday i will not notice those few cents . 
  ( do n't take me wrong power consumption is an issue but its not in any way even close to being hugely important apart from few special cases ), 
  as for cooling and heat - i used to have my phenom xii 965 overclocked to 3.8 ghz and i tell you that bitch was hoooooot . 
  my poor little 8350v @ 4.3 is ery quiet and cant even get my legs warm in the winter unless i run prime95 :( :(, 
  ( my cooling setup - scythe ninja 3 1kg aluminion cooler with 8 heatpipes with noctua redux 140mm fan ) - the fan is running 20 % for majority of the time and ramps up to like 60-80 % when gaming - idle core temp + -30 c gaming core temp + -50 c, 
  if only thing you 're doing today is gaming than maybe what you say makes sense ( lets not forget dx12 with better multithreading support is comming and game engines are becoming more and more multithreaded all the time so how long your that is true nobody knows ) . 
  but if you are doing other things then amd can offer + -40 % multithreaded performance vs similarly priced intel competition ( according to passmark . 
  software is becoming more and more multithreaded and that means fx will have more staying power . 
  just look at 2011 benches fx8150 vs i7 2600k and look at benches now .
