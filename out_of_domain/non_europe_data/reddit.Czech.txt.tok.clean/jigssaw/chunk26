  fx was losing every bench - now its better in everything but gaming . 
  to be honest i think you can build a better pc new for the money he is asking . 
  depends on the quad core and work load . 
  both pentium g3258 and athlon 860k are + -70 $, 
  @ stock athlon has + -40 % better multithreaded performance ( according to passmark ) . 
  the game performance is pretty similar ( some wins for pentium , some wins for athlon ) . 
  you can propably overclock the pentium more than you can the athlon ( becasue you are not limited by temps as much - but running those ridicilously high voltages through 22nm will significantly shorten its lifespan and i would n't do it ) . 
  overall i 'd say athlon is better deal even for gaming ( 2 new games refused to even start on dualcore and that is alarming ) . 
  and using 4threads is not as big a deal as using 8threads so yeah the 40 % multithreaded advantage will bite you in the ass soon . 
  fanboy card ... nothing more :-), 
  if those are your requirements you might as well save the money and get 860k ( which is slightly better than your current cpu ) + mobo for a total of 110 $ if you do the rebate .

  for the same price you might pick pentium g3258 which is worse overall chip ( + - 40 % worse multithreaded performance ( its dualcore ) ) but its better in some games - you 'll have the advantage of potential upgrades ( 1150 socket ) . 
  that penttium has around 20-25 % worse multithreaded performance than his current cpu though ... 
  i 'd rather get 860k which is same price and better in every way ( than that i7 he has ), 
  i 'd go with the 6300 - simply because it will do all the gaming you want at respectable framerates ( i3 will do better ) ... but it has 40 % better multithreaded performance - which is important in productivity tasts and will become important when dx12 comes out . 
  ( it will most likely have better longevity ... ), 
  well i bet somebody in / r/lowendgaming has :-d, 
  but seriously you can play games ( lol , cs : go and such with pretty good framerates ) and new games on very low settings on very cheap hw -,

  not to mention that you need to get rid of that pc anyway - cause windows xp is not safe to be on internet :-), 
  will he use it just for that or is he planning to game on it too ? 
  then go with what jakomako posted ( i 'd get full atx motherboard though - and one that does have atleast one pci slot for compatibility with older audio equipment ) . 
  as for sound card - propably the best idea is to instead get dac which sits outside of your case so it doesnt get any sort of interfernce - they are somewhat expensive though . 
  why go xeon vs i5 ? 
  get rid of the graphics card - you dont need it ( the cpu has pretty good integrated one ) and instead of it buy sshd,

  also you could propably get away with cheaper motherboard, 
  much better in every way ... 
  good luck dealing with all those pesky rebates though :d,

  well i dunno - older sound card maybe :-) well you know i am the sort of guy who likes fulltower builds and buy atx motherboards :-) but you are propably right its not needed an if its few bucks cheaper than thats nice . 
  it has + - 40 % more multithreaded performance but slower singlethreaded ( athlon is quad core , penitum dual core ) - in some games the pentium is better but overall the athlon wins and should win in modern games . 
  passmark . 
  passmark . 
  open the laptop and disconnect tje cmos battery that get rid of it . 
  you need to disasemble it ... every laptop is different try to google `` cmos battery change - your laptop - . 
  but first try to format that harddrive that would be the easier solution - only if that doesnt work you do that . 
  get antenna they are very cheap . 
  running adapter without proper antenna will damage its sensitivity . 
  i do n't know if there are companies that do it in uk . 
  but where i live the number 2 computer parts e-shop will assemble computer for free if you pick all the parts from them - that is the best route imho :-), 
  i honestly wouldnt run it at all . 
  but those usb wifis are pretty cheap anyway so if it works like crap afterwards not a huge loss ... 
  cant you just get a ethernet connection ? 
  its the best way anyway ... it is well worth it to take the time and run a cable to stationary location your pc will be in . . 
  290 is better deal at this time imo . 
  literally unplayble !, 
  if i were you i 'd wait till february for amd to release 380x 390x and for nvidia to release 980ti ... 
  and then choose imho the step up from 280x to 970 is n't that big of a deal to warrant immediate upgrade . 
  i would not go the crossfire way ( too much power , too much heat and doesnt work perfectly in every game ), 
  sega sonic allstar racing transformed is pretty good `` mariokart clone '' that can be played split screen and is ussualy very cheap . 
  best way is to run a cable ... :-), 
  second best way is ussually ( unless you have crappy old electrical network in home ) to use powerline adapter and run a cable through it . 
  but when talking wifi - pci-e cards are the best hands down . 
  ( or good wireless router configured as a client ) . 
  stay away from usb stuff . 
  looks like dell lga 775 socket intel motherboard . 
  it will run core 2 duo / core 2 quad cpus - and with adapter it might run xeons ( which are cheaper on ebay ) . 
  overclocked core 2 quad is still respectable cpu that you can pair with low/mid-end gpu like 260x 265 270 or gtx 750ti to get ok gaming performance at 1080p . 
  overall that pc is salvagable - depending on the cpu installed it might be better idea to just get newer motherboard and keep the ram and stuff :-), 
  so get into bios and tell us the ram and cpu :d, 
  a ) its ussually low quality . 
  b ) 99 % of them are single antenna models ( no mimo - slower speeds ), 
  does he have the board already ? 
  or are you getting really good deal ? 
  that cpu is only clocked @ 2.6 ghz and is locked so you cant even overclock it - i 'd say its a very poor choice .
