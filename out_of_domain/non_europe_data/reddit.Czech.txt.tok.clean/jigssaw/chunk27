  and it has even worse performance per clock than fx . 
  i 'd suggest athlon 860k fm2 based rig or some lga1150 pentium dualcore . 
  ( btw am3 + motherboards are not really expensive ( well good ones are - but you can get the crappy ones for 95w cpu pretty cheaply ) . 
  6gb should be ok imo only problem is that upgrading is gon na ve painful if your board only has 2 slots . 
  3tb is the best price per gb - 2tb is still ok . 1tb are not a very good deal . 
  seagate barracudas are cheap and ok performance . 
  290 / 290x should give you ok performance in most non demanding titles ( older racing games , valve games , leage of legends and such ) . 
  on newest titles you would have to drop some settings . 
  if you want to max everything well then you need sli / crossfire . 
  well i never had any trouble with seageta hdds ... 
  i am running barracuda 2tb for more than 2years now and s.m.a.r.t shows everything is fine ( keep in mind that your hdd will be off/idling most of the time since you are only using it for occasional storage :-) so that helps ), 
  well then maybe you could get a used phenom ii 965 or something along those lines - they are comparable to fx quads . 
  edit : scrap that unless you get a really good deal on one ( unlikely ) you are better off just buying mobo + 860k / mobo + g3258, 
  it maybe a design choice ( for instance in insurgency there is no killfeed at all ) .

  this mobo has no pci ( you do n't need it - pci-express is the newer standard ) ,, 
  4sata ports ( unlikely that you need more - you can always get pci-e card for a few bucks later on to add more ), 
  now amd based build - it will perform worse at gaming than the i5 but overall be better at productivity tasks ( 8-cores ) - you also get better mobo with stuff you want ( it will draw little bit more power though ) .

  oh you want 16gb of ram ? 
  that is definitely doable you 'll have to sacrifice some cpu though and honestly unless you are doing some very specific tasks i am not sure you 'll benefit that much from having more . 
  for 70 bucks its not a good deal - you can get better performing new cpus that need less power for that money . 
  in that case this will suit you nicely - its the best possible around that price point for what you do an will blow your core 2 quad out of the water -,

  + mobo has 4 dimm slots so you can add another 16gb later on . 
  that is just the integrated gpu - if you add dedicated card the pc will use the dedicated card . 
  edit : or do you have nvidia integrated gpu on that motherboard ? 
  if so dont worry anyway it will work prety much the same as your old one . 
  nope you can use pretty much any graphics card in any computer `` if it fits '' :-) and since the pci-e bus which gpus was is mechanically the same for like 10 + years there is like 90 % chance it will fit :-), 
  first i would try getting more ram just to see how much that helps . 
  and if the difference is not enough then i guess you can go the 2011-3 route with i7 5820k / xeon and throw bunch of cores at the problem . 
  or if there are budget constraints you can get 1150 i7 and if you really have low budget you ca n't beat fx8350/fx8320 . 
  1150 and 2011-3 are the two intels platform . 
  1150 has cheaper motherboards and overall is the mainstream platform . 
  2011-3 is the enthuaist platform with 6 core cpus more pci-e lanes ddr4 and such . 
  you will need newer mobo anyway . 
  so you can either buy top of the line 1150 cpu or some 2011-3 cpu ( now with 2011-3 problem is that your 16gb of ram would be worthless so i would suggest 1150 cpu - something like i7 4690k . 
  here are passmark scores -, 
  and actually amd cpus are much better at multithreaded workloads ( including video editing than similarly priced intel counterparts - so they are very good deal - but they just ca n't compete with intel at the high end . 
  the gpu acceleration is very good point - some software can greatly benefit by offloading calculations from cpu to gpu ( gpus are much better at highly paraller workloads as they have lots of cores ) . 
  for instance adobe premiere supports that http://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/system-requirements.html, 
  not sure how much can it offload and such . 
  but maybe getting a good gpu would help you more and be cheaper than changing the cpu . 
  yeas because its ddr3 ( sure you can sell it but you know what i mean ), 
  i5 4690k is like 10-20 % ( 20 % better passmark ) better than the cpu you already have ... not really worth the upgrade if you ask me ( even the much cheaper fx will be + -30 % ( it has 40 % better passmark score and 30 % better perf when encoding ) more powerful at the tasks you are doing ) . 
  have you tried booting into safe mode ? 
  ( press f8 repeatedly when booting until menu screen pops up ), 
  hp stream its fanless very thin comparable to chromebooks very cheap with windows 8.1 , free skype minutes office 365 subscription and one drive, 
  yep only 32gb ssd ( there is a version with 64gb - that shoudl be enough imo + external drive best of both worlds ) . 
  but since its gon na be user for spreadsheets and stuff maybe something bigger would be better :-), 
  just a better quality power strip with integrated fuse, 
  yes it should - cant you stream throug shadowplay though ?

  cheaper and better for what they are gon na use it for . 
  if you want to be extra safe feel free to get diferent case and psu . 
  if they dont download and stuff maybe 128ssd will be a better fit - and make it lot faster . 
  8350 is priced against as i5-4440 and according to passmark offers + -40 % more multithreaded performance . 
  it will be better at tasks like video editing encoding and such which can use all the cores . 
  if you can use all the cores its better if not its not so good ( it can however mean that in future it will be better - cause software is getting more and more multithreaded , more potential staying power , so if you are someone who knows is not gon na upgrade for long time that may be another reason to go fx ), 
  advantage fx :, 
   unlocked so you can overclock and mitigate some of that single threaded disadvantage . 
   compatible with some older am3 motherboards ( so maybe you can upgrade from your phenom ii if you have a good board ), 
  disadvantage fx :, 
   older platform with not so great mobos ( you have to pay more for the really good ones ), 
   higher power consumption, 
  80 + bronze is plenty good,
