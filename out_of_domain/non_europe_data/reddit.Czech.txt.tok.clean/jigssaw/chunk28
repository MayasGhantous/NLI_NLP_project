  well just keep in mind that the fx6300 has comparable multithreaded performance like the i5-4440 so if you can use all the cores ( which the stuff you do propably will ) its basically the same for much chepaer price and you can upgrade later to 8-core cpu that has comparable multithreaded performance as the lower i7s . 
  the reason why people dont like / recomend fx is because its not as good for gaming which is what most people build pcs for ... but at video editing virtualization and other stuff the fx is clear winner @ the same price . 
  and if you gon na upgrade at the same speed like last time both sockets are gon na be propably obsolete anyway :-), 
   i would like a config that could use my ssd as a cache for my hdd . 
  i 've done it on a 1155 platform , can an amd based config do the same ? 
   the cheapest i3 is twice as expensive as a g2030 , is it worth the price ? 
   i can get a g2030 and a basic mo, 
  yep that or 860k, 
  in that case looks good :-) go for it . 
  imho not unless you are one of those `` need to run everything at max 1440fps '' guys :-), 
  there is no difference between pcie 2.0 and 3.0 for 280x . 
  but yes youll be bottlenecked by your cpu in some games ... try it out see how much performance is there untapped ( look at msi afterburner `` gpu usage '' when gaming ) see if you are happy with frame rates and if not upgrade . 
  there is no comparison 290 is much better . 
  r9 280 would suffice if you want to save some money . 
  a ) you need 8gb of ram, 
  b ) since you already own am3 + mobo your best bet would bo to upgrade either to 6350 or 8350 ( imho 8350 so the upgrade is worth it and not just small step ) ( a10 will not fit in that mobo ), 
  c ) the most important thing is the gpu and it will have the most impact - so i 'd suggest doing that first and then potentialy upgrading the rest if you are not happy - r9 270 is very good for the money - buying lower end gpu is not very the best performance for price - its better to save up more and go for the sweetspot . 
  d ) you can skip ssd if you only care about gaming . 
  tldr : buy proper gpu ( imo r9 270 ) + 4gb more ram ( what kind doesnt really matter all that much for gaming ) . 
  if not happy then consider fx6350/8350 . 
  i were in similar situation - phenom ii 965 ( actually better than the 4100 he is running ) and my 890 am3 mobo got fx support with bios update ... 
  so when it came time to upgrade i went for 8350 with the logic that i might aswell get the best part for the socket since its cheap enough and i want it to hold me over for some time - i hope the newer games will use more and more threads ... 
  for 50 you are better of getting powerline adapters ... 
  16 gig is overkill imho, 
  8 - is enough or 8 + the 4 you already have is more then enough . 
  as for gpu brand - xfx has lifetime warranty , sapphire is ussualy considered the best amd card - so those are the best options . 
  however the cheaper cards are perfectly fine ( 270 isnt very power hungry so little bit worse cooling isnt a deal breaker ) and i would propably go for one of the cheapest aftermarket cards like ( club3d or powercolor i think ) . 
  i 'd stay away from gigabyte though - i have had problems with 2radeon gpus i bought from them ( 7970ghz and 280 ) ( one for myself , one for my friend ) - kinda makes sense they are ussualy one of the cheapest and have the highest overclocks - so i guess they have to save cash somewhere . 
  ( i know that is absolutely ridicilously small sample size that doesnt mean anything and i am propably just unlucky ... but you know ), 
  the chances are that sata ports arent the only thing missing the controller or some mikrochip might be missing aswell - motherboard creators ussually make several versions of one board with cost saving measures . 
  why would you spend almost 1/3 of your budget on a case ? 
  ... you can spend much much much less sure it might not look as great and the building experience / cable management might not be as great but spending the additional money elsewhere will bring much better experience .

  woudlnt you rather have double the ram and 60 $ to spend later on for a gpu ? 
  yes you will have harder time upgrading later on though, 
  i 'd suggest saving that money and saving little bit more ( atleast to have total like 100-120 $ so you can afford mid range gpu - buying gpu for 60 $ is not a very good deal - buying sweetspot range will give you much better price for performance . ), 
  you could maybe keep the ram at 4gb and get gpu for like 80-90 $ but that is still not the sweetspot ... imho the igpu should be enough for minecraft so just save up some more later . 
  or you can sacrifice upgradability and go the amd apu route . 
  its up to you . 
  or you can get pci-e sata card they are not that expensive, 
  sure its the cheapest case on pc part picker :d what would you expect ... it looks ok though and will work good enough and in these low budgets every dollar counts . . :-), 
  edit - looking at the pictures the case actually looks fuck -- ng great for the price ... :-), 
  screen savers !!!, 
  :d it would be like 1995 all over again !, 
  announced ! = delivered ... kaveri was announced as 1 teraflop wasnt it ? 
  not that great ... imho,

  and add to it your case + hdd + psu ( 10 $ +20 $ +15 $ ) ... ah damn forgot mouse + keyboard ... well i guess you could get used one for like 10 $ . 
  so this for a total of 358 $ and you get better cpu + modern platform with ddr3 and such . 
  and warranty on lot more items ... 
  thanks . 
  you did good job aswell . 
  imho those these ultrabudget pcs do n't make too much sense . 
  the pc sweetspot imho is like 500-600 $ and you but for that you get 60fps 1080p and much cheaper software :-), 
  i expect carrizo to change that though :-), 
  well basically yes but now you can put ssd inside :d :-) or you can get 2tb hdd vs 1tb ( which is much better price per gb ) and those litle nice things that make it overall better pc :-), 
  arent the pentium and 860k essentially the same price ? 
  well wow is notoriously bad for this ... :-), 
  what about msdnaa ? 
  cant you get acces to that ? 
  came to see 1500w triple 290x overclocked `` furnace '' ... . dissapointed :( why you call 500w system furnace ? 
  i am not sure that the celeron will be able to play 4k video smoothly :-), 
  amd used to make 3-core processor in their phenom ii line up - those were salvaged parts where one of the cores was bad and disabled ( or just disabled because people wanted more of them that they had ) - you used to be able to try to unlock the other core with ceratin mobos . 
  now amd has modulearchitecture where disabling half a module doesnt work - so only even numbers . 
  and intel was never really big on salvaging parts . 
  i guess amd could theoretically make 3-core with their jaguar architecture - not sure why arent they doing that . 
  i 'd go for something that has 4k acceleration - i am not fan of doing it in software ( using cpu brute force ) - i 'd suggest one of the dedicated nvidia gpus that have ( not sure about what cheapest one has that capability ) on radeon side currently only r9 285 has it . 
  i also know some of intel cpus do have it but again not sure which ones and i 'd suspect nothing in the celeron/pentium lineup . 
  actually its not the eu that permits the movement of goods and people - that is a seperate agreement called european economic area and other non-eu member states participate in it ( iceland , lichtenstein , norway ) . 
  anarcho-capitalist position is that it ca n't be reformed .
