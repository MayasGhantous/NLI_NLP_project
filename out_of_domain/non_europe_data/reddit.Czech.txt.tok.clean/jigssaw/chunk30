  gigabyte - i try to stay away from their gpus - had bad luck ( artifacting ) with couple of them ( they are ussually one of the cheapest + most overclocked so yeah somethings got ta give ), 
  just from the top of my head -, 
  skewing benchmarks , handicapping other cpu with their compiler , strongarming oems into selling only intel laptops , screwing over nvidia chipset bussines , giving chips away in markets where they ca n't compete just to starve competition and so on . 
  not a very nice history . 
  they do make good products i have to give them that ... 
  indeed ... they are still better than 90 % of mice that are marketed `` gaming '', 
  damn right i was upgrading from 5770 crossfire and damn it was a change !, 
  7970ghz edition right here !, 
  its a lot better bang for your buck to get like 2x 800w psus to run your monster gpu rig :-), 
  i run 8350 @ 4.3 ghz ( +7970 ghz edition ( = = r9 280x ) ) and in cs : go everything maxed i have mostly 200-300fps and i do n't think cs : go can use all of the cores so imho on 860k you should be around the same, 
  i 'd pay a little bit more and get 600-700w psu ( not a big price difference but it can save you the throuble of buying whole new psu when upgrading later on ) . 
  and i 'd also get 2tb hdd - the price per gb on 1tb models is not very good . 
  otherwise i agree with the build ( maybe small ssd later on but thats not necesary for gaming ), 
  indeed well the build you posted was 500euro so i think bigger psu would be inside the 500-600 range . 
  the hdd was more like a point to be aware off :-), 
  cause a psu is something that can last you through many builds and upgrades - and when it comes time to upgrade you wo n't be limited and will have plenty of o.c. 
  headroom and a headroom to install 300w gpu and overclock it aswell . 
  also psu degradation is a real thing so it will lose some of its wattage during its lifetime . 
  its really simple spending litle bit more now ( there is not a really big difference between 500-600w psu prices ) will save you the hassle of having to get rid of your older psu and getting a bigger one later on . 
  why do n't you just get a fan controller ? 
  ... buying a whole new mobo seems like overkill to me ... 
  or get better yet get pwm fans and jerry rig them off the 12v psu + pwm on your cpu fan . 
  well i used to run phenom ii x4 965 ( + -200 w max power consumption ) with radeon 5770 ( + -200 w max power consumption ) - so i would be perfectly fine with 500w power supply ( i went for 620w instead ) ... now i upgraded to 8350 ( + - the same w as phenom ) + radeon 7970ghz which can take like + -270 w max and i wanted to overclock i 'd be f * cked with that 500w psu . 
  yes you can call that changing a build style ( going from mid-tier to high-end gpu ) but i do n't think stuff like that is too unlikely, 
  its called future proofing . 
  not to mention that after like 3years psu will lose 10-20 % of its wattage . 
  check these out - they already have what you need and they are cheap . 
  i 'd be limiting myself ... . and that is the whole point of my post . 
  i like options and small psu will limit your choices in the future . 
  for one i would have to get a new motherboard ( my old 890 am3 asus mobo supports fx cpus with bios update - something unheard in the intel world ) . 
  and i would be limiting myself in gpu choice aswell - where as with bigger psu i can go the price for performance route and not care about power consumption ( since it runse idle for 90 % of the time anyway it doesnt really mater ) . 
  agreed . 
  upgraded from phenom ii x4 965 - very happy ( + 7970ghz ) . 
  only game i had trouble with was rome ii that did run like crap . 
  you can buy cheap ram `` coolers '' from ebay in color you want ( that might void waranty thoug ), 
  for fps games - good optical mouse        anything laser - keep that in mind when shopping for gaming mouse ( deathadder/zowie/microsoft wheel mouse optical are propably the most agreed upon ) . 
  well the k is overclockable though, 
  really ? 
  because when i play cs : go my cpu runs at like + -40 % utilization ( cores 1-4 get utilized pretty well , 5 and 6 see very light utilization and 7 and 8 remain parked ) . 
  what the hell has cpu got to do with computer freezing ... lol just lol, 
  soemthing like this would porpably be best,

  if i do the threads command it will use all 8 threads but cpu utilization stays about the same ... . is there a way to run opengl version on windows ? 
  there are games that use more than 4 cores - using them efficiently is another matter though . 
  i on the other hand think that more and more games will use more cores - due to multiplatform engines and consoles being octacore . 
  some of ram modules are sold as 1600mhz @ 1.65 v they will default 1333mhz @ 1.5 v - so check what is set in your bios and put the values there manually, 
  definitely not . 
  that is perfectly save . 
  to be sure first consult your ram spec sheet ( how they are supposed to run ) . 
  - the only problem is ( i read ) that pushing more volts to the memory might affect your overclock - i.e. 
  it will put more stress on the mobo and it might not be as stable . 
  btw - only upping the volts will not work you need to set everything manualy . 
  it should since it has mantle, 
  sure ... but that just means that devs/game engines will have to utilize multiple cores ( btw : xbone has actually now 7 cores accesible to devs - with some tradeoffs ), 
  what this is old am2 motherboard with bunch of busted capacitors . 
  there is like 90 % chance that after soldering new ones ( which is pretty easy and i already have the ones i need ) it will work flawlessly . 
  what makes this board special is that with a bios update it supports am3 cpus ( phenom ii / athlon ii ) which means it is still pretty damn relevant even today and will have no problem with older/non demanding titles like dota2/lol/cs : go . 
  also unlike intel boards from this era it support high density ddr2 memory which means that the memory is really cheap compared to normal ddr2 . 
  it also still has ide ( and i have bunch of ide hdds so boom free storage ! ), 
  yes i already noticed that - according to gigabyte site its only a very small heatsink ( which i can easily replace - have some from older dead mobos ) . 
  its missing because the previous owned wanted to keep it :d, 
  yes and a floppy controller !!!, 
  ( but seriously my am3 ( fx compatible ) board has bunch of pci ports aswell :-p ), 
  indeed, 
  update :, 
  desoldered those dodgy caps ( 10 of them suckers needed replacing ) and soldered new ones instead + attached new chipset heatsink . 
  i 'll have to wait to get my hands on some ddr2 + am2 cpu ( will come soon ) to try it . 
  lets hope it will work :d, 
  update ii : ... it works !!, 
  i just read the ltt forum and i think i am gon na puke . 
  all those people complaining about tdp and watts ... . just what the flying f-ck ... 
  so you are wanting to tell that you want to buy 500 $ flagship card but your main concern is not performance but if it will draw a little bit less power so you can save like 5-10 $ a year ?!?!? 
  there are soooooooo many better ways to spend your money to save on electricity than to buy more expensive gpu that is more `` efficient '' ... ( the chances are that over the lifespan of the card you wo n't save any money anyway ), 
  all these people are killing performance computing ... sorry but thats why all the focus is on low tdp mobile sh-t - because even the enthusiaist which are miniscule percentage of the market praise the god of green computing and tdp . 
  just lol . 
  ... ... ... . or are they just nvidia fanboys where every little thing where amd loses suddenly becomes the hugest thing ever ? 
  ... if that is the case then even bigger lol . 
  i was talking about current gen amd vs nvidia , we do n't know much about the 380x anyway to draw any conclusions :-), 
  well i would bet that amongst people who buy higher end cards the percentage is bigger :-), 
  u.s. is like the only country where even if you live and work somewhere else and pay taxes there you are still required to pay taxes to u.s. governmetn . 
  so seriously fuck the u.s. government and fuck you for thinking the tax system is ok . 
  well atleast i do n't use governmetn force to steal from people and call it `` justice '' . 
  thanks but i prefer :, 
  #include < iostream , 
  void main ( ) {, 
  while ( 1 ) {, 
  std : : cout < < '' ( '' ;, 
  as someone with 8core cpu . - ... . might aswell let it work a little bit :d, 
  well since the load avg will put on my cpu is so small it will not boost it from its power saving state anyway and i will not notice it in anyway in performance . 
  the difference in power consumption is so miniscule that it will amount to cents , maybe a dollar a year . 
  and if that will help me keep my computer more secure so be it . 
  i also run malware bytes + - once a month to be sure . 
  imo they are about the same - i prefer avg though ( mostly because of the design and it doesnt force you to register ), 
  ok so i just tried - when running avg scan it uses around 15 % of my cpu + it finishes in like 10 minutes and it does these test every two weeks .
