  they could propably do a litle bit more segmentation ( totally without gpu and super basic igpu ) but they dont want to get into that . 
  ( keep in mind that even very basic igpu is pretty big - all the hardware acceleration of video and stuff like that take bunch of space - the gcn cores are just a part of gpu ), 
  my guess is that if the igpu has only faulty gcn units that it gets binned as lower end kaveri and those 860k are propably mostly those where some other part of gpu ( that is essential ) is faulty . 
  50c idle cpu ? 
  ... isnt that a bit high ? 
  heck my slightly overclocked 8350 is idling 30c core temp ( and i do n't even have it set to downclock to more that 50 % ... ), 
  i think there is something wrong with the cpu ( try replacing thermal paste or reseating the cooler ) . 
  at those temp the cpu is propably throtling . 
  those temps are pretty damn scary ( not sure what is the max safe temp of that particular cpu but my guess would be 100c or less ) . 
  ok according to intel - 72.7 \u00b0 c is the max temp ... so you better get a new proper cooler or stop with that overclocking madness :d, 
  only partially true . 
  amd fx lineup ( 32nm ) and bunch of older parts are rated for max 70c package temps . 
  but the apus are ussually rated at 100c max . 
  temps on which cpu will shutdown ! = safe temperature for prolonged use . 
  amd suggest 62 core / 70 package as a maximum . 
  holy sh * t - i did n't know that amd ceo was a fan of austrian economics ... . got ta buy more amd products :d, 
  deathadder 2013 - best mouse for fps . 
  get more ram ( atleast so you have 6 total preferably 8 ) and reinstall os you shoud be ok, 
  there is no contest . 
  280x hands down .

  niiiiiiiiice, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr-eu_l_pka :d, 
  agreed !, 
  dignitas -  tsm right ? 
  silver tip - do n't aim at the fucking ground / legs ... :d, 
  i believe in strong funding of education ... 
  but not with stolen fucking money ... 
  depends on what you play against - in rounds where you expect enemies to have ak/awp and/or are low on money it makes sense to not buy it . 
  keep in mind that it is windows 10 arm ... so no desktop app will run on it ... 
  amd has great gpu products ... 
  nvidia pays for reviews and employs bunch of people on forums to post bullcrap ... so we still in 2015 and hear `` amd has crappy unstable drivers '' ... even when that is simply is not true and wasnt for like 5 + years ... 
  the nvidia does shit like gameworks where they essentially are benchmarking amd hardware ... ( its closed source binary that ca n't be optimized and they can basically run entirely different code for amd and nvidia cards ... ) . 
  scummy marketing tactics , lying , anticompetitive behavior , rigging benchmarks ... that my friend is why amd is in the slump on both cpu and gpu front ... and people still fall for that crap from nv and intel all over again . 
  scaling up cores is easy ? 
  ... well yes but fx are much more clever architecture - one modelu takes up as much die space as single intel core and yeat has much more multithreaded performance ( comparing to products when it was released ) . 
  more die size means more expensive manufacturing and worse yields, 
  oh good for you you are one of the 0 . x % that use linux ... meanwhile everyone who is building a gaming pc is gon na run windows on it . 
  proof ? 
  go watch gtx 960 reviews on youtube in every fricking review ( on big youtube channel ) you hear the words `` sweetspot for 1080p '' ... do you really think that is a coincidence that everyone is using the exact same wording ? 
  funny thing is that r9 285 is lower price and bettter and when it released not too long ago everyone was like `` meh its pointless '' ... 
  well the game could use being little bit more t-sided since all maps are now ct sided ... 
  actually even less - 10mbit is theoretical troughput . 
  you have to count some overhead and sh * t ... so like 8mbit of real data . 
  building is not where money is - repairing stuff thats where the money is . 
  i on the other hand love my full tower atx build :d its so roomy cool and quiet :-), 
  still hubs arent the only part of the network - the other devices - i.e. 
  stations and modem in this case communicate on 10base-t and some of that theoretical 10mbit is used for signaling , retransmiting and stuff like that . 
  so you are not getting the full 10mbit . 
  ( the same with fast ethernet you dont get 100mbit but like + -97 mbit ) . 
  how the hell would more rules and regulations help competition ? 
  i work for an isp . 
  read the damn contract ... there is no guarantee on actual speeds the rated speed ussually means maximum speed . 
  if we were to guarantee the speed all the time for everybody ( even though 99 % of users use like 1 % of that bandwidth ... ) we would have to crazy crazy amount of bandwidth . 
  and the regular joe user wouldnt even notice the difference but would have to pay a lot more . 
  i work for small isp so we do n't use data caches ( we have bottleneck elsewhere anyway as we run mostly wireless network ) . 
  and we can agree what comcast is doing is scummy but i still do n't think law would fix such a thing . 
  i would however be for a law ( as a compromise ) that isp would have to be open about what he throttless , how much and what are the specific limits . 
  well the way i feel about these 4cent skins is that they are basically worthless ( after valve cut you get like 1cent on the market ) . 
  so if i can lose them i dont care and if i get some 50c skins when i win one out of dozen or whatever i am happy . 
  agree whole heartedly ... 
  i 've been stuck with so many toxic idiots like these so many times and i wanted to quit but i do n't want to get comp.cooldown ... and potentionaly lose rank . 
  cs is partially about keeping your cool and being friendly otherwise comeback is never gon na happen because angry team doesnt communicate and is more likely to do shitty suicide plays ... 
  i am all for more regulation and restriction on what government can do ... :-) shame it doesnt really work out most of the time ( i.e. 
  look at every constitution ever :-) ), 
  better idea : make it so you still get comp cooldown for leaving but you can still connect back and play the game you left . 
  i just wish people like you got their computers sorted out so we can have games without afkers :-), 
  btw guys - why are bots so fucking stupid ? 
  like seriously sometimes i feel they are coded as to piss you off by design - just look at their buying habits - like almost never ever do they buy an actual usable weapon instead of some shit smg negev or whatever ... and there should be a thing that if you take weapon at the end of the round while playing bot , he will drop you that weapon next round . 
  380x is supposed to be flagship . 
  holy shit if they have something even more monstrous ... :-d, 
  you just dieded !, 
  :d nah i wouldnt worry too much :-), 
  well the think is that dual gpu solutions are miniscule percentage of the market so if it takes \u016fopt of work i wouldnt think devs will optimize for it ... there are even games today that dont support dual gpu at all . 
  who knows maybe they will pull out `` ti '' on us . 
  release 380x as the flagship and then later on when nv responds they will pull out the real flagship :-), 
  different idea : lets take into account some sort of player rating - for example - player that is often reported for griefing / kicked a lot ( lets make some sort of ratio out of that ) could be kicked by simple majority as opposed to every remaining player . 
  that could actually work imho . 
  ... . fuck that too much money ... let only ps/2 be allowed !!, 
  that its the biggest fucking bullshit i ever heard ... 
  the overall notion that gender not skill should matter when choosing a player, 
  doesnt even deserve the views, 
  what wi-fi card do you have in your pc/laptop ? 
  some basic single n ( 150mbps ) without mimo will get around that . 
  so you need atleast 2x2 mimo ( 300mbps n ) or ac . 
  obviously getting ehernet wire across a wall is always better . 
  i can see it being used on lans ... 
  well a lot of teams play in gaming houses and wouldnt it be a bit strange if you see your mate having a new box in between ac and the mouse ? 
  it wouldnt propably eliminate all online cheating - just greatly reduce it and eliminate lan cheating . 
  didnt know there is something like that with gta :-), 
  well then in that case its a damn no brainer ... . 
  i dont play dota so i didnt know about it ...
