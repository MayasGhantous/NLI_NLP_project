  well it was old anyway :d, 
  then when upgrading friends cpu i managed to get a drop of thermal paste inside the socket ( he had too much on it and i wanted to just pull it out and then clean it in my hand so i have more space ... ) - this one turned out ok - cleaned the socket and used pin to pull out as much as i could from the holes - it works flawlessly . 
  do n't really orient myself with cases - i diy 'd mine . 
  its mostly personal preference - for me - full tower and good airflow  compactness, 
  keeps on digging ... . 
  this actually might be true - cause if you look at compute benchmarks of gtx9xx the power consumpsion ( and therefore heat ) is vastly different from gaming benchmarks . 
  so if dx12 can use the gpu more efficiently and push it to its limits you will propably see more heat . 
  `` their customers best interest . '', 
  do you by any chance live or lived in a totalitarian country ? 
  cause this is the reasoning ussualy given for limiting freedoms ... `` its in your best interest '' `` we know better than you '' lol, 
  ... lets say your laptop is out of warranty and your display breaks and its not worth it to you to replace the shell and display so you just take the laptop mobo and diy a custom case - then you can provide all the cooling needed - are you still `` a fucking moron '' ? 
  some laptops are advertised for overclocking ( i would never buy something so huge but whatever ), 
  this is just dgpu right ? 
  ( cause it talks about aib ) . 
  the overall trend seems to be more igpu and less and less dgpu so in that case imo amd isnt looking that bad in the future :-), 
  also keep in mind this doesnt count igpu and apus - which nvidia has 0 %, 
  true but i was talking in context of x86 ( pc ), 
  and it means that they will have the same mobo for beema ( carrizo-l ) chips and for carrizo . 
  so horay !, 
  sure no problem with that - i am fan of arm and linux myself but until there is arm version of windows with proper systembased emulation that can be used for all x86 code that wasnt recompiled i do n't see non-x86 pcs becoming mainstream . 
  i guess i shouldnt have put ( ) in there :-), 
  we sure live in interesting times - x86 is basically almost public domain now ( the original patents are expired , only the extensions are not ) , arm/mips is getting into lots of places , hsa ... soon intels x86 `` monopoly '' on computing might end . 
  :d he was member of pcmasterrace i guess :d, 
  if the expenses were that much higheer why wasnt the overclocking disabled in the first place ... and why disable it now when we have such a powerefficient architecture ? 
  yep i wouldnt even call it a laptop because putting it on your lap sure as hell isnt comfortable and natural :d more like tabletop :-), 
  sadly recent amd systems were the same in this regard :-(, 
  lets hope they change back to their old ways . 
  good luck if you think that net neutrality will actually make the internet better ... 
  thats why you wait for steam sale :d, 
  not exactly what you looking for but ... check out esp8266 - its tiny microprocessor board with wifi capabilities that cost less than 4 $ and can be run for a loooong time from just aa baterries ( 2-3 .3 v dc is enough ) . 
  it has enough power to run a very simple webserver which you can fill with information or even do a tiny network share with an sd card . 
  you need to have some very basic understanding of electronics though and little bit of networking/programming . 
  but you could make tiny nodes for like 10 $ which you could leave in a lot of places . 
  to spread some freedom :-), 
  well yeah but in this case not really ... :d its a fricking 25w apu and the fan runs dead silent anyway ... no need for that, 
  added cost and not so great solution, 
  what about facing the flag and doing the nazi salute just to piss them off and show them its essentially the same thing :-p, 
  tldr : `` you should be grateful for what your overlords at nvidia have given you '' . 
  lol just lol . 
  this is what corporate disconnect looks like . 
  i understand and i see good things in the future - when every processor is soc we can have motherboards aslong as standard dont change ( memory pci-e and stuff like that ) . 
  i am hoping for soonish upgrade for am1 ( carrizo-l maybe ? 
  if you have msi motherboard with a dragon on it it will look nice if you have similar looking msi card with dragon aswell :d ), 
  raise awareness and help keep the internet free and open by getting the government to control it ... 
  you know what when we are at it we can also raise awareness and help to protect jewish population by getting the ss involved ... 
  its just the standard school indoctrination - `` government is your mommy and daddy , they mean only good and you need them to protect you '' ... 
  its deep inside ... 
  so fucking what ? 
  do you complain that there is a first class usps post service ? 
  whats the big deal . 
  in the end it will subsidise the regular service ... 
  hehe its obama care all over again `` but we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it '', 
  hehe its obama care all over again `` but we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it '', 
  he is a free beatiful independent human being ... god damn right his opinion matters . 
  hehe its obama care all over again `` but we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it '', 
  honest and humble person would wear hsbc t-shirt because there aint nothing wring with helping people to keep what they made and not paying taxes . 
  new big table . 
  what is fast and what is slow ? 
  why would i want to pay for x speed connection when the connection the websites i use would actually be much slower ? 
  aslong as they are open with what they are doing i see no problem . 
  i would n't buy connection from that company but hey somebody might - doesnt concern me . 
  solutions to crappy service isnt government regulation but competition ... governmetn regulation results in much crappier service ... just remember what service you got last time where you went to dmv . 
  currently government stands in the way of competition in isp industry i do n't want them to impede it even more with more rules . 
  i guess you are not american ... 
  yes but who would buy such a connection ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z_nbhfpmk4 - watch some history about how we got there and why there isnt competition ... maybe then you wouldnt be so inclined to have government do more ... 
  ... hooray for getting back to regulations from 1930s ... very relevant to today 's internet surely ... 
  i will get downvoted to oblivion but i stay away from nvidia and intel because their anti-consumer bussiness practices ... 
  i do n't want to support that behavior with my money . 
  ... well but then you can easily destroy motherboard socket ... 
  if you bend pins on cpu you can pretty easily straighten them you can even manage to repair it if the pin breaks ( put it in the socket ) ... 
  but if you damage pins on the mobo socket you are pretty much fucked ... 
  imho pins on a cpu are better design ... 
  #nohomo though :d, 
  yep never happened to me either ... and i handled a lot of amd cpus ... 
  does the fan ramp up aswell ? 
  could just be reported wrongly ... 
  could just be wrong reporting did what software are you using to measure it ? 
  this does though ...

  i am not worryied about upgrade path ( the user was content with using 10year old basic pc up to this day so when the next update comes its gon na be everything anyway : - ) ) ( we are replacing it because something is broken and its not really worth repairing it - we are planning to salvage the case and hdd - thats why i went ssd only ) . 
  and i choose kaveri because while raw x86 is little bit worse ( according to some benchmarks its even better ... ) it will steamroll intel whenever the opencl/hsa is used ( which is likely it will over the lifespan of the chip ) . 
  so i think that little chip might have more staying power . 
  note - i am not buying the parts in us ( czech republic ) so some of the pricing is different so it wouldnt neccessarily make sense for me to switch the psu/ssd/ram . 
  i picked the ram because it is on sale right now in the shop i am ordering it and because i want dualchannel for the apu .
