  - 360x/360 - possibly a new gpu, 
  - 340 and lower - doesnt really matter so i would expect rebrands of oland / capeverde and so on, 
  this way every card up to 350 would support freesync , trueaudio vsr and other new features . 
  and last time amd also released x90 and x60 as a new ( gcn 1.1 ) cards so they might aswell do it this time too . 
  after the collapse of communism many eastern european countries were faced with similar question - while some of these countries just auctioned the state owned factories to the highest bidder , there were other solutions . 
  for example in czech republic ( where i come from ) - every citizen basically got a small share in all the main state companies and they were free to do as they wished with these shares . 
  most of them sold them for little extra money and after a while owner with controlling amount of shares emerged . 
  no privatisation is perfect and there will allways be people close to the governmetn with insider info and such - but overtime the market will allocate these resources according to merit . 
  70c is the max core temp for fx . 
  62c is the max package temp . 
  i would suggest you clean your pc / improve airflow / get a new cooler ( if using stock ), 
  i use scythe ninja3 ( not sure if they even make it anymore - been using it for a pretty damn long time - its been cooling my phenom ii before ) . 
  but basically anything that is big and has 120mm + fan is good :-) ( just physics more area = better ), 
  noctua is obviously the best but pricy . 
  coolermaster 212 is often recommended because its pretty good price to performance . 
  but if you can find something bigger on sale go for it . 
  in my country you ussualy pay yearly/monthly fee to access library ... 
  space ... you ca n't very well do 4-way cf/sli otherwise ( not that it would matter anyway ), 
  or anything bigger on sale :-) ... heatsinks are mostly just physics - the bigger the area the better, 
  i think op was talking about mobile gpus as in laptops . 
  but indeed you are correct they sold their ultra low power to qualcomm ( their ardeno gpu is even anagram to radeon :-) :-) ), 
  currently amd has basically one very good new mobile gpu - the m295 ( rest of them are rebrands ) but all of them are going to apple . 
  so once they make enough i bet we will see it in laptops, 
  lets start stealing more money through taxes and start subsidizing deodorants !, 
  think of the externalities !, 
  it has awesome effects on everybody they do n't have to smell the ugly body odour of everybody else !, 
  tell me again how people society benefits from the great govenrment propaganda center - public schools . 
  cause there is no more civilised way of society than to steal from your neighbors and then give some of the money back ... much civilised wow, 
  - bang for the buck, 
  - not being scummy , lying anticompetitive walled garden company, 
  yeah well this is finally a believable rumor that makes sense :, 
  - 380/380x tweaked hawai, 
  - 365 rebranded pitcairn ( to get rid of stock ? ), 
  - 360/360x new gpu, 
  this way everything will be freesync compatible ( except 365 - but i expect that will be priced accordingly ) . 
  and anything lower that 350 doesnt really matter imho - anybody looking at that price range should just get a used older card because they are not good price/performance, 
  who say we need public goods ? 
  you use something therefore you pay for it ... 
  it basically the best looking aa you can have . 
  and it will work in games that would normally for some reason not support aa . 
  in normal aa there is complex algorythm that only renders some parts in higher resolution so it can look good and not be ridicilously hard to run . 
  vsr will render everything on higher res . 
  well its simple most girls do n't enjoy playing fps games so there is lot less girls that play them a lot - therefore get very good . 
  maybe its an unpopular opinion but different genders enjoy doing different things ( heck no two people are same so why the hell should two different groups of people be exactly the same ? ... ), 
  are you trolling ? 
  the g3258 has much better singlethreaded performance therefore it performs better in some games or software that cant utilize the 4times as many cores the fx8320 has . 
  and op wasnt asking about games specifically . 
  we are not talking magic just better use of resources . 
  try render video on your pentium and then on fx8320 ... 
  it was in some form in 1.6 aswell :-), 
  well you forgot one important thing ( for somebody building very small budget or home pc not for gaming ) . 
  and that is that the a8 has significantly better gpu while keeping similar x86 multithreaded performance . 
  and that means much better performance in every application that uses opencl acceleration ( adobe suite , spreadsheets and so on ) . 
  also in future it might get better due to hsa . 
  ( also you should propably compare 4150 to 7650k - 7600 is cheaper ; 7650k is unlocked for overclocking + slightly higher clocks ), 
  i found that these kaveri chips make a great price for perfomance for general computing light gaming machines that people want . 
  but if you are gon na add dedicated gpu anyway this of course doesnt matter at all and you shoud go with intel . 
  as a pure cpu ( x86 performance ) intel is a better cpu - it has 2 strong cores while a8 has 4 weaker ones - their multithreaded performance is very similar ( in some cases intel wins in some cases amd wins ( integer heavy workloads ) ) . 
  but in workloads that rely heavily on singlethreaded performance intel is much better . 
  however if you look at these as the whole product ( both of them have integrated gpus ) then amd solution becomes much more desirable . 
  amd gpu is a looot better then the intel one which directly translates to better performance when gaming and better performance in any application that uses opencl acceleration ( spreadsheets , photo / video editing and so on ) . 
  also amd solution is better integrated ( hsa ) so it will propably get better when more software uses it properly . 
  tldr : if you gon na add dedicated gpu intel is better if not then amd is better . 
  i totally agree with you :-) just next time dont say that 4150 is in every way better . 
  because that is only true when you add a dedicated gpu and therefore nullify the advantage amd has . 
  the a8 is pretty niche product but in its price range it is very good deal :-), 
  a8 7650k ( overclockable ) should run lol and smite just fine without the need for dedicated gpu . 
  so if you have low budget and dont want to pick a gpu ( anything lower than r9 260 / gtx 750 doesnt really make sense ) . 
  ( performance in lol for 7600 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3akdz8fji0 ), 
  keep in mind when building a apu rig that you want to get atleast 1866mhz memory kit ( 2x4gb should be enough ) preferably 2133mhz nowadays they are very similar price to normal ddr3 anyway :-), 
  - something like this :-) ( change 7600 for a8 7650k as that one isnt on pcpartpicker and ofcourse add storage and case , psu ),

  ( or different if you dont want to deal with rebates ), 
  overclocking the a8 would make it have better x86 multithreaded performance but that doesnt neccesarilly mean better game performance because lot of games today rely heavily on single core performance ( might change in the future though ) . 
  so it would perform better in most workloads just not games . 
  ( of course that is only if we are talking about comparing the cpu only which actually makes a pretty small part of the apu :-) if you dont have dedicated gpu than the a8 will smoke the i3 ), 
  cs 1.6 runs at higher framerates though :p :p and ofcourse is much better gameplay wise :d, 
  to all the guys complaining about boxes : fuck you and fuck your cosmetics over gameplay mindset , sincerely 1.6 player . 
  well the reason i like to use passmark is that it has like the best database for results ever :-) with almost every cpu possible . 
  no benchmark is perfect you have to test what you want to use the cpu to do . 
  from the few cpus i tested myself the passmark results seemed to be believable ( i.e.
