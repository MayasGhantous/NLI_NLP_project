  ps : upgrade path is overrated ... by the time it matters you are most likely better of buying new mobo anyway . 
  well to be fair . 
  remember that you can also upgrade motherboard ... and in my build he doesnt have to upgrade ram . 
  so i 'd say its about the same . 
  and the cpu part is better on the apu + overclockable so he could even just get a gpu and it would work better - which i doubt with the pentium . 
  well yeah its cheaper ... but it depends on when would he want to upgrade ... cause socket 1150 is eol - new intel cpus are gon na need new platform anyway . 
  you just went full retard . 
  750ti is outperformed by 270/270x, 
  960 is outperformed by 280/280x/285, 
  970 is outperformed in higher resolutions and high vram usage cases by much cheaper 290 ... 
  no fm2 + is basically eol too ( only a refresh incoming ) . 
  my point was that if he would upgrade when there is already a new socket he would be locked into the old socket or have to upgrade the mobo anyway ( or get used cpu ) . 
  i would not sacrifice performance for some maybe litle bit better upgradability in the future . 
  ( especially when the person is getting a 300 $ pc . . will he really upgrade to an i5 ? ), 
  well you know the person propably better than me :-) so you are a better judge . 
  by the way new ddr2 high-density modules are right now much cheaper than ddr3 . 
  to be fair that is likely because only amd systems can use the high-density stuff . 
  4gb of ddr2 is like 12 $ shipped on ebay . 
  i am spartacus !, 
  ( sporting a 7970ghz edition ), 
  eco friendly :d :d :d :d :d oh my god you made me laugh so much . 
  jesus i cri evritim i threw out my pc and now game only on my smartphone becase it consumes much less power . 
  go green !, 
  you understand economics 101 right ? 
  you ever heard of fixed and variable costs right ? 
  because those numbers are total bullshit . 
  electronics bussiness is largely fixed costs ( to develop the technology ) the actualy bom cost is not that big so what amd would need is to simply sell more units - the fixed cost then gets diluted . 
  and boom profit . 
  what ? 
  tonga ( r9 285 ) was released last september . 
  maybe if you people wouldnt be spewing total factless bullshit like : `` amd havent released a product in years , their gpus consume like 5 times the power of the frugal 970 and they will burn your house down , and also you will pay more in power bills in like a week '' then people would actually buy amd gpus ... lol, 
  i guess shill marketing     product . 
  lie that is repeated 100 times becomes a truth ... goebels said that ... and that is the reason you hear the drivers/hotness/huge power bill bullshit ( totally blown out of proportion ) all the time from nvidia shill posts . 
  sorry i did n't wanted to attack you . 
  i justed wanted to point out that what you said is infact not true at all . 
  btw about cleaning out the old stock - these are just rumors and for all we know amd might be waiting for something entirely else ( driver optimazation / problems with hbm or whatever ) . 
  if it were through its kinda stupid move on amd part ... cause everyone is waiting for the new gen anyway lol :-), 
  so what nobody is forcing you to game ... microsoft made directx . 
  and there are number of competing os . 
  which are in some areas better . 
  you might aswell say that linux is infact monopoly for server os ... just because 90 % of people use it doesnt make it a monpoly . 
  maybe you should read some economics ... . . 
  almost every classical economist agrees that anti-trust is bad . 
  most likely tonga ( 285 ) and tonga xt ( currently only in macs ) will be rebranded and occupy similar price slot . 
  they older cards will still propably be cheaper just to get rid of old stock . 
  not really ... 7650k and anything lower you cant really realistically even get cpu + gpu, 
  a8 7650k is same price as 7600 and is unlocked + higher clocked :-), 
  i do agree with you i just do n't agree with `` amd needs to charge more to be profitable . '', 
  i guess it depends on the region but according to official amd slide its the same price . 
  and it was the same price when i bought it last week from a retailer in czech republic . 
  you can check my original post - http://www.reddit.com/r/amd/comments/32yyf9/ive_seen_the_future_its_fusion_a8_7650k_first/ . 
  the board was one of the cheapest ones avaliable and i managed to do quick and dirty oc on the gpu from 760mhz to 900mhz without any voltage increases on the stock cooler . 
  could propably have pushed it little but more but didnt wanted to mess with it ( and potentially have it later overheat on hot summer days ) . 
  yes . 
  you made me sad :-( i guess the time when `` heroes '' used to mean `` heroes of might and magic '' is long gone :-(, 
  what is the mobo ? 
  some of them actually support fx cpus ( mine does :p asus m4a89gtd pro with fx8350 running like a champ ) . 
  anyway i used to run phenom ii x4 965 overclocked to 3.7 ghz . 
  it was good enough until i upgraded to 280x then it simply couldnt keep up . 
  i upgraded last year because the cpu couldnt keep wolfenstein nwo at 60fps no matter the settings :-(, 
  well the 4gb of ram is non negotionable you need that anyway even if upgrading and you can keep it even if you upgrade to a newer platform . 
  so i 'd get that and the gpu too ( or look for used ones they are pretty damn cheap ) . 
  the cpu is tricky what i would do it like this - if your mobo supports unlocking i would try getting one of those cheap athlon ii x3 that can be unlocked to quad core phenom . 
  ( they are like 25 $ on ebay ) and overclocking that ( fsb only ) . 
  if everything works then great you have cheap system with enough power for some time and you saved a lot of money . 
  if it doesnt - then sell the mobo and the cpus and go onto new platform . 
  well he clearly wants to sell it right ? 
  so what sounds better ? 
  - the system is a gaming beast that can play battlefield maxed at 30 + fps !!, 
  at 720p, 
  - can play older games fine but struggles with every modern game and you have to turn down the res for playable settings ... 
  dude you are lucky ... 
  i just googled a little bit and your mobo can be made to work with fx :-), 
  asrock added a beta bios for asrock m3a770de3l which really similar ( only 2 memory slots ) and that same beta bios works with your board . 
  ( you would lose 2memory slots though ), 
  try it on your own risk - and try to message the guy who tested it first :-), 
  first you should open your motherboard manual :-) ( rtfm noob :d ) there you will find a lot of important stuff and then just google the stuff you do n't know . 
  just bind a `` clutch button '' that mutes the voice chat . 
  easy solution to stupidity :-), 
  but will this run minecraft ? 
  i lost it at `` please help us '' :d :d :d, 
  well its not a stretch to think that htpc will be close to somebody 's tv is it ? 
  btw just a psa : you can get ok looking htpc cases for really cheap - google lenovo m57p . 
  they are cheap prebuilts with slim desktop case that fits standard matx ( and with bit of fiddling even full atx ) mobo . 
  older cases float on the internet :-) i got my own for like 20 $ with 250w psu shipped :-) ( btw just be ready to fidle with the front panel stuff - dupont cables needed as they use different connector ), 
  the less you care about rank the more fun you have in game :-), 
  the aiming at the ground/legs is real . 
  :d l2 silver 101, 
  do i have to restart my pc ? 
  no do n't even turn it off just replace it on the fly ... its all plug and play :d :d :d / s, 
  but they are really streaming !!!!!, 
  / s just a jk i hate that shit too, 
  works everytime :d, 
  use fps_max 24 for cinematic feel - it helps you keep calm,
