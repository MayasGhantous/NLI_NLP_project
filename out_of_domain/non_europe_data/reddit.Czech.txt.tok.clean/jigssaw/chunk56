  another thing i feel will help them vs intel is the fact that the top dog chip will run on the same platform ( no expensive server lga2011 with quadchannel memory ) . 
  bulldozer is the first gen ( fx x1xx - like fx8150 4150 and so on ), 
  piledriver ( or vishera ) is second gen - ( fx4350 fx8350 and so on ), 
  steamroller is 3rd gen ( kaveri and athlon ii 860k ), 
  and finally, 
  excavator is the 4rd and last gen of construction family and it will feature in carrizo apus for mobile . 
  we have no idea how will they perform yet . 
  but imho they will be close enough in single thread performance for it not to matter ( with dx12 incoming ) and will compete with ht ( remember i5 doesnt have ht ) and more cores ( kinda like rematch of phenom ii x6 vs lynfield i7 ) . 
  but maybe just maybe they will be even better ( heck they are planning to release a single core cpu in 2016 ) . 
  what will also help them is that intel i5 and i7 have like half the chip ocupated by igp while amd performance parts will be pure cpu ( smaller chip - less expensive ) . 
  holy shit this didnt even ocur to me . 
  well that makes a lot of sense . 
  if that is the case it means zen will have integrated nb/sb that means the mobos will be cheap ( like we sab with am1 ) . 
  and potentially fm3 could have a huge upgradibility . 
  well but that is for server market intel has 15core cpus for that aswell :-), 
  i guess well see leaked server roadmap soon ( this is just desktop roadmap ) . 
  i am betting to see that on the server roadmap - its too early to push arm into desktop . 
  that can happen when microsoft releases proper windows and office for arm :-), 
  it even says `` up to 2 cores '' which suggest that amd plans to release single-core cpus in 2016 . 
  well that is interesting ... 
  it either means that zen will be pretty big core ... or i am just reading too much into it and they just need something to replace those bottom of the barrel sempron jaguar based apus . 
  i wouldnt really expect it in first half ... more like q3/q4 ... well my fx8350 will have to do up until then , 
  while that is true as far as i am aware samsung 14nm should have better density . 
  anyway one thing is sure . 
  its a heck of a way closer to intels than 28nm, 
  yes i know but i dont think intel sells any single core model . 
  ( but i might just be reading too much into it and its just something to replace the bottom of the barrel jaguar based semprons \u00a8 ), 
  nkey rollover ? 
  are you trolling ? 
  so you really think that a budget card is somehow better to the current fastest card on the market ( r9 295x2 ) ? 
  cases come with fans . 
  i have gigabyte 7970ghz edition ( which is the same as 280x ) and it is silent at idle - which is what matter . 
  and i am kinda a silent freak . 
  well liquidvrporn and amd cards will be flying off the shelvs i guarantee it :d, 
  their roadmap says for basilisk apu `` up to two cores '' which means a sku with 1 core - otherwise they 'd just say two cores, 
  no you told me that passmark is somehow a good measure of performance - which obviously if a budget 960 somehow beats a monster dual gpu card which is currently the best single gpu you can buy means you are delusional . 
  while i wouldnt call it confusing one socket is still much superior - because now somebody who buys a budget apu can later on easily upgrade to 8core zen :-), 
  the most interesting thing almost nobody yet mentioned is that fm3 might very well be motherboard without a chipset ( like fs1b/am1 ) . 
  if that were the case it means cheap motherboards and huge upgradability . 
  it would make sense because than amd can charge more for the cpu . 
  the apus are finally a soc - that means nb and sb are integrated into the chip . 
  the summit ridge is n't called an soc but for what we know it could very well have integrated nb and sb and they just cant call it soc without the gpu and display adapter . 
  there is basically 3 posibilities :, 
  1 ) only the apus are gon na be socs and there are gon na be cheap mobos that only take apus ( which would be stupid cause then you wouldnt be able to upgrade on that mobo and it would cause confusion and unnecesarry segmentation ) . 
  2 ) all the mobos are gon na have nb/sb and the reason the apus are socs is purely for mobile ( they are using the same die ) and the integrated nb/sb is gon na be disabled when placed into desktop socket . 
  this is a posibility . 
  3 ) the integrated nb/sb will be only very basic to save power and die space meaning that there could be very budget minded boards with less sata/pcie and so on and then more expensive one with dedicated nb/sb, 
  well there is an asrock board that supports both ddr3 and ddr2 ( it has 2 slots for both ) ... ( it supports am2 + / am3 and am3 + cpus ) . 
  so its not like it hasnt been done before . 
  although whats more likely is that there will be boards with ddr3 and other boards with ddr4, 
  am3 + socket compatibility is imho out of the question . 
  for gods sakes there are am3 + boards which ruun 7xx chipsets from the days of am2 ( 2006-ish ) . 
  what i find more interesting is that apus for desktop are finally socs which means potentially very cheap boards ( like am1 platform ) . 
  its second genereation fx . - which means regular piledriver . 
  it doesnt mean they are gon na release it it means they are shipping it right now ... 
  zen is according to rumors a regular full core with smt technology ( like intel hyperthreading ) so the top desktop part is gon na be 8c/16t . 
  i am expecting the parts be only littlebit behind in single threaded workloads , which by the time of release wont matter since dx12 will be here . 
  but they will compete with hyperthreading and more cores . 
  ( 4c/8t against i5 6c/12t against regular i7 and so on ) . 
  what helps is that those chips wont have integrated gpu taking up half of the die space - which means smaller and cheaper chips . 
  it would be like nintendo wii . 
  get a whole new demographic who never bought `` gaming pcs '' to buy amd cards because of new `` killer app '' :-) :-), 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbbzc2pab9k relevant :-), 
  sadly fx name is no good ( right now ) for the top dog skus . 
  uninformed people would still think its the same bulldozer/piledriver . 
  why the hell does the flair say fake ? 
  sadly from their slide you will only see beema on am1 ( which is still nice since 2,4 ghz beema is 15w while 2.05 jaguar is 25w ) , possibly they could do an unlocked multiplier - which would be cool cause i feel they would overclock a lot an few watts of power consumption wouldnt matter . 
  imho that is mainly because am1 is single channel ddr3 . 
  and i do n't really agree that much with your second point - since nvidia stopped making chipsets ( thx to intel disallowing it ) . 
  ( and as far as i am aware via doesnt make them no longer aswell ) . 
  its now the case that mobo makers implement either intel chipset of amd chipset - which means there is no more brand difference than if those chipsets became integrated . 
  what matters in a board to me is mainly power delivery , i/o and price . 
  well in a few years i bet we could get really close to lifelike .

  add pretty much any case and any psu ( the whole build should take less than 150w at full load ), 
  with this he will be able to play the majority of games at 1080p low 30fps . 
  and have no trouble playing lol/cs : go at very good settings and very high fps . 
  ( source i built a very similar rig few weeks ago ), 
  he needs to have windows licence of course ( or you could run linux but i am not sure how good lol runs with wine ), 
  yes the cpu part of the apu runs at the frequency of 3.3 ghz ( but it can turbo higher ) . 
  to greatly simplify - performance is calculated kinda like = frequency * ipc ( how much can the cpu do in the one tick/cycle ) * number of cores . 
  but i 'd suggest to just look at the benchmarks of games on a8 7600 ( which is little bit older so it got more benches online ) and add a few % . 
  the 7650k pretty much replaces the 7600 at same price and is litle bit faster and overclockable . 
  there is nothing in this price range that can perform better ( unless you get into buying used parts ), 
  ddr4 is pretty much confirmed . 
  what is uncertain is if there will be ddr3 compatibility ( like with phenom ii being able to run with ddr2 or ddr3 ) . 
  with ddr4 alone we could get pretty damn good bump ( from 2400mhz to 3200 and possibly more later on ) - which is 33 % and add up deltacolor compression which wasnt in kaveri which is said to be another + -30 % and you are suddenly have + -70 % memory bandwidth to play with . 
  i feel that that is enough for whatever the first gen 14nm apu is gon na need . 
  after that they will propably add hbm cache :-), 
  well i thought zen is the codename of the architecture ( like kaveri , piledriver and so on ) . 
  and it wouldnt work with the tradition ( calling everything `` on '' / `` om '' - sempron , athlon , duron , phenom ( fx was derived from athlon fx so it doesnt count :d ), 
  but i guess zenon or zenom would work :d,
