  ... well it certainly is a personal computer ... but can we classify it as a pc ? 
  yeah in a fucking 100x100 pixel comparison window lol, 
  with that cpu i think 970 is an overkill youll be bottlenecked . 
  960 is propably a better option ( or 280/285/280x ofcourse ), 
  lose the phenom . 
  get athlon x4 860k - its better than even the best quad phenom out there at cheaper price and lower tdp . 
  what is also very interesting is that since the 2016 apus wo n't be zen but excavator based and they have both ddr4 and ddr3 compatibility ... does it mean that they will fit both fm2 + and am4 ? 
  cause why else even mention ddr3 compatibility ... they sure as hell wont release ddr3 am4 cause the fx wont support it and it would be pointless . 
  ( or it could just mean that ddr3 will be used in mobile ... ), 
  i 'd also like to know if those apus will be fabbed at 28nm od 14nm . 
  but i guess we 'll have to wait . 
  i only hope that they wo n't use the fx branding ... cause fx reputation is tarnished and it could mean potentially lost sales to customers that wouldnt realize that it has indeed nothing to do with construstion core lineup . 
  otherwise i honestly do n't see a problem with their naming scheme ... its very similar to intels ( celeron = sempron , pentium = athlon , a4/a6/a8 is very similar to intels segmentation ), 
  only foundry that makes 22nm is intel ... 
  i sincerely doubt they 'll start fabbing amd cpus . 
  heh my 266mhz amd geode in the wrap is enough for the teamspeak :-) :d routing is done on mikrotik . 
  what i would like the most would be the version with disabled igpu at lower price . 
  ... that would be ideal - as it will run headless anyway . 
  well i work in the industry ( senior technician for wireless isp ) so i got lot of experience of the platform just from work and experimenting . 
  mikrotik makes courses and you can get certification ( and its not expensive like ccna ) so they can teach you the basics . 
  otherwise they have a manual on their wiki which is kinda ok . 
  otherwise nothing all that great is out there . 
  but the benefit of the fact that it is based on linux is that you can learn a lot from other sources which are not strictly for mikrotik for instance i learned a lot about firewall/nat/mangle from a book about iptables . 
  specifically from, 
  linux iptables pocket reference ( pocket reference ( o'reilly ) ) - which is really cheap on amazon ( got it for my kindle ) - i can recommend that . 
  upvoted . 
  beatifully written . 
  thorins response ... `` one finger for every round you got on dust2 vs. envyus  '' lol, 
  [ x ] rekt, 
  [ ] not rekt, 
  the government puts stuff into people minds from very early age ... 
  i dont think you can reverse this in 5minutes :-(, 
  yeah cause we gon na fuck the whole scene because of kids ... 
  sorry m8 if you let your kids watch adult rated movie do n't come complaining if he sees some sex in it . 
  its the same here - its for mature audience so go ahead and advertise sex , guns , alcohol , gambling or drugs i do n't care . 
  yeah add some links to pornhub so they can ban you too ... lol those sites are not here to police you . 
  its bga . 
  it could mean that they are avaliable to oems not general public - afterall its bga chip for laptops . 
  well isnt it actually worse to play at 100hz then ? 
  i 'd much rather play at either 200fps with some little tearing or 144fps cap than to make my gpu work for 200 only for the gsync to effectively cut it in half ... 
  honestly i do n't think you should be buying highend 144hz screen if you do n't have a gpu that can push things higher then 30fps ... 
  i 'd say it is essentially non issue . 
  one thing is what is displayed other thing is the feel of the game . 
  for instance i can easily tell if cs1 .6 is running at 60 or 100fps even on 60hz screen . 
  it should be ( depends on the title and settings though ), 
  not worth it imho, 
  sorry for ot . 
  i just wanted to point out that people should stop the circlejerk `` amd drivers suck '' cause there are problems on both sides . 
  but overall you get pretty damn good experience regardless of brand . 
  for video card ? 
  for gaming ? 
  nah not really . 
  its either running idle when you are on desktop - which means silent and very low power draw . 
  or it will make a little noise when you game ( if you have good airflow in your case and not card with bad cooler ) , but you can hardly hear that anyway over your headphones . 
  and i do n't know many people who play games without sound . 
  did you complain to microsoft when they added solitaire to windows 3.0 ? 
  http://semiaccurate.com/ nuff said, 
  you do n't have to do that . 
  windows will recognize the card as a generig gpu - then you will uninstall your old drivers and install the new drivers . 
  through the actual card . 
  it will get recognized as generic gpu and will display input just fine . 
  its just the hardware acceleration wo n't work until you install its proper drivers . 
  would n't it be insecure to the 51 % computational power style overtake though ? 
  imagining its just a small country . 
  thats true . 
  holy shit ... 
  i just ordered one ... what the hell you cant pass on a deal like that ( even if i own 7970ghz edition ), 
  i think i read somewhere that the variable refresh rate is not mandatory part of the dp 1.2 a spec . 
  so imho it will not unless they adverttise it . 
  ... or you can ask the manfacturer, 
  if they 'll actually honor it i will have a `` free '' gpu upgrade :-) cause i will sell easily my hd7970 ghz ( = = 280x ) for atleast the same price or more ... amazon pls :d,

  i think this is perfect . 
  you can even save a little bit more by going with sempron 3850 ( 1.3 ghz quad core ) . 
  its more than enough power than you need . 
  the rated tdp for these apus is 25w but the actual powerconsumption is even lower ... and they will idle most of the time anyway . 
  its the same cpu architecture as found in the consoles . 
  + its soc ( the mobo doesnt have chipset =  even lower system power consumption ), 
  yes and in the same free market you go and boycott such practices . 
  which is what every sensible gamer does . 
  i never said majority of gamers are sensible or smart . 
  most are stupid fanboys with zero understanding of history , economics or technology . 
   bit more expensive in germany, 
  bloody taxes :-(, 
  sadly that is arm and not x86 . 
  well tressfx tanked simply because nvidia was n't good at compute ... thats why coin miners bought amd cards . 
  is far as i know amd ca n't get acces to the source of the gameworks libraries so they ca n't optimize that part . 
  its just a binary blob for them . 
  and even if they somehow reverse engineer it and find how it works and are able to optimize it nvidia could just release a patch that would change it . 
  not really amd manufactures both at tsmc and gf and up until recently it was only cpus that were done by gf . 
  sadly nvidia bought 3dfx :-), 
  opencl is opensource standard which amd took and implemented . 
  what were they supposed to write their tressfx for ?
