  yeah what i meant is that when you are building a pc you should always overbuild a little psu wise - i see too many 430w psu builds when 500/600w are only a little bit more expensive . 
  gumba cap guy was my favorite !, 
  i know - but that is the part that makes fps go high :d, 
  and also - just logically - there is much more potential - since we all know that nv drivers are pretty damn fucking good while amds not so much - and amd cards have more hw power which is not really used right now while maxwell is very lean gaming focused efficient card that gets used to the max . 
  i am sorry i didnt realize you are going for video editing . 
  i though this was a gaming build . 
  in that case i would rather suggest something like this :,

  switched out the cpu for 8320 ( since they do n't sell 8300 in the us which is reallly cheap where i live ) cause that will have a big impact on all the editing :-), 
  scaled down the gpu to r7 260x which is comparable to that 750ti and costs less . 
  that will be enough for some gaming too :-), 
  switched the mobo - cause the one you picked is as i said earlier older chipset - doesnt support sata 3 - so your ssd would run slower and overall conectivity wise you dont want the board slowing your system . 
  switched the hdd for wd which is ( atleast according to most people around here and my own experience ) more reliable and should last longer . 
  and finally added a aftermarket cooler so your system runs quiet and cool when you put that cpu to 100 % load ( and also you can overclock ) . 
  damn right that is a good point . 
  but it doesnt apply to poeple just upgrading ( unless they are getting new screen aswell :-) ), 
  its just a clever use of the streissand effect :-) :-) if you say to the internet nobody link to us - you will get loads of people linking to you = free publicity :-), 
  or you take the middle - sweetspot performance per dollar where you get the best of both, 
  yes and no :-) ... the card is , the gpu isnt though :-), 
  yeah ... 
  i didnt really follow the tourney and just cassually saw those crazy odds ( 9-91 ) on csgolounge vs nip and was like whaaaat and immedietely did an icb on flipside ... then when the game started i saw hiko a was like ooooh shit i get it now ... but then they won :d, 
  i used to run exactly the same setup had msi 5770 and then got a xfx 6770 sadly i got a 1080p screen at the same time ( upgraded from 1440x960 ) so the jump in perf was offset by the resolution :-d ... then i jumped onto 7970ghz and i am using that still . 
  two cents :d :d :d pun intended :-), 
  puting a pudding in your pc ... thats a paddlin, 
  cmt isnt bullshit - its pretty damn good idea actually . 
  just the execution wasnt that good . 
  communism doesnt even sound good on paper though ... :-), 
  i am waiting for 14nm and zen for the huge perf . 
  jump . 
  at the same time i am propably going to get a freesync monitor aswell :-), 
  my fx8350 + hd 7970ghz edition is enough for now :-), 
  everything is equal for everyone doesnt sound good for hardworking people :-) because it simply is n't fair - no matter how hard you work you get rewarded the same as a joe down street who sits on his ass all day . 
  and once people realize it nobody will work hard and the whole system crumbles - its simply a problem of incentives ... 
  meritocracy is a system that sounds good :-) everyone gets rewarded according to how they contribute . 
  yeah cause we do n't live in a meritocracy :-) ... 
  its not 2003 anymore !, 
  everyone should have firefly already downloaded !!!, 
  ... or you get a motherboard with 4 dimm slots :-), 
  14nm is gon na be big jump for gpus . 
  and also for amd cpus :-), 
  what are you smoking bro ? 
  amd is most certainly gon na use 14nm finfet and not 16nm because 14nm is made by globalfoundries and amd has contracts and ties with gf saying that they have to buy x amount of wafers or pay up . 
  amd ca n't be easily sold due to the x86 license . 
  so its just the typical fud rumors that have been floating around for years ... 
  i remember my first time playing wow ( back in vannilla ) it was my first mmo and i remember being so amazed how huge the world is when my 10lvl dwarf left the starting area and i looked at the world map :-), 
  overall i spent about 200 days ( x24 ) playing wow . 
  it is great fun if you get into a good group of people :-) though after a while it gets repetitive . 
  funny story was how i stopped playing ... 
  it was christmass time and i just said i 'd take 2weeks break from wow ... well that was it . 
  i didnt want to play anymore after that :-), 
  after few years i came back but it was only for very short amounts of time - i played so much that once the paint wore of the mechanics and stuff was just the same repetitive stuff :-), 
  but by all means its a great game you should try it ( warning - you might lose your life :d ), 
  holy shit and i though 150days on my main was impressive :d, 
  overclocking is much less important in sli/cf setups though ( unless you are putting those cards under custom watercooling loop ) . 
  its not very good idea to overclock two powerhungry cards sitting right next to each other :-), 
  well that is pretty hard ... cause it obviously depends a lot on a case - testing it on a bench would skew the results a lot . 
  two power hungry cards next to yeach other pump out some serious heat . 
  keep in mind that its one thing to massivelly overclock single gpu and to massivelly overclock two powerhungry gpus sitting right on top of each other . 
  unless you are doing a custom loop . 
  wearing out a pci slots ? 
  :d :d :d what kind of weed are you smoking ? 
  :d :d, 
  if nano will be cheaper then fury and ... if it features full fiji xt according to rumours ... then i have a tin foil hat theory ... :d, 
  it might be the whole reason for the locked voltage - because otherwise people would just buy cheap nanos and put them under custom loop and overclockign - essentially getting fury xs for really cheap . 
  ever heard of enterprenourship and being self-employed ? 
  damn you are right i didnt think about that :-), 
  damn you are right i didnt think about that :-), 
  lot of amd fx boards feature crappy igpu on the motherboard so its possible on that aswell ( though not on fm2 + board if you get something like 860k ), 
  - simple hikovich + hiko simplovich :-) :d, 
  s1mples hype ? 
  not nearly close enough ... 
  i am czech and ussually play with few polish friends and we still mostly use english - and polish is much more similar than russian ... 
  yeah i was just banned on / r/fullcommunism for replying to some guy that was complaining that its not freedom when he only has a choice of working for shitty wage and starving ... as a fellow self-employed contractor i simply had to help him and point out to him that he has all the freedom he needs and he can work for himself ... but i guess they did n't like that message :-) :-), 
  fnatic is saving some new sick boosts :d :d, 
  what next will they forbid caffeine , taurin and stuff like that ? 
  those are definitely performance enhancing drugs . 
  where are you gon na draw the line ? 
  i do n't see an issue with players drinking coffee or redbull why should i see an problem with stuff like adderall . 
  the whole fucking civilization is high on coffee - its the most sold item by weight after oil . 
  its what makes our world function . 
  redbull contains caffeine -,
