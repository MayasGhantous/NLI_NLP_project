  twentieth century motor company ... all over again . 
  maybe you could try something like the wii nunchack instead of wsad . 
  ( wii nunchack can be used with pc pretty easily with adapter or bluetooth ) and use your other hand with mice . 
  its not gon na be perfect but it should be good enough :-), 
  btw : i personnally own mayflash dual port classic controller pro adapter ( usb to wii controllers ) and it works great with both classic controler and nunchuck . 
  it costs like 20 $ on ebay . 
  and nunchuck costs like 5-10 $ . 
  cheap cheap stuff, 
  i am looking forward to it . 
  it would be cool if they used second screen ( lot of people are running dual monitor setups ) for the inventory management ... but i dont really hold my breath since its ubisoft and console game . 
  just because its better for the pros doesnt mean its better for average player in mm . 
  i think the logical solution and future is that the igpu will be dedicated to doing compute - afterall its great at simple paralerized tasks ( think pathfinding for large amounts of units in rts game , ai or physics ) . 
  its basically amd 's project fusion - you have big cores doing the serial compute and then bunch of gpu cores that will do the paraler . 
  dual graphics is basically crossfire between apu and similar gpu . 
  ssd is a must . 
  and apus are much better fit for the usual workloads - they have comparable multithreaded performance and their can accelerate a lot of stuff ( spreadsheets , adobe and so on ) with their powerful igpu - so the total compute power is much better . 
  their only problem is lower singlethreaded performance which is a non-issue cause he is not gon na be gaming . 
  i 'd go with something like this .

  darthvader is lukes father !!!!, 
  :-) there i said it sorry for spoiling a movie from ' 83 . 
  atlas shrugged is from '57 :-) and i dont think that was spoiler at all :-), 
  i 'll walk you through my logic - pros have ussually much better aim - therefore do n't need that many bullets as an average player . 
  and that also means that when spraying if first few bullets do n't hit they get headshotted by the other guy anyway so they do n't need as much . 
  so in pro sceen m4a4 only has benefits because larger ammo reserve ( you can prefire and spam places ) and because its cheaper . 
  in regular game the chances of you needing more than 20shots are higher . 
  so imho for regular player the m4a4 is more enticing than for a pro . 
  especially because it has very similar spray pattern as ak so its one less thing you need to master . 
  because gpus are much better at paraller tasks than multicorecpus . 
  well for example spreadsheets can benefit a lot from gpu acceleration ( as amd showed with hsa libreoffice ) . 
  but we are talking about gaming and having some strategy game with huge amounts of troops could see huge benefits imo . 
  you have 4gb of ddr3 ram psu ( maybe ) , hdd and a case . 
  so basically you need a mobo with 4 ram slots , some additional ram and a gpu :-) pretty good salvaging, 
  edit : my bad that dam is ddr2, 
  you can propably enroll in some easy entry level it class and get acces to dreamspark that way . 
  i didnt realize how stuff works in u.s. , in most of universities here once you are a student you can sign basically on any course provided there and get credits for it . 
  yep you have mandatory classes you have to take but for the last few credits you can take either some voluntary ones from your faculty or any other class even from other faculties . 
  ok but you have to learn control the a4 pattern anyway - if you do n't you are crap with ak . 
  i say that another advantage the m4a4 has is that it has the same recoil pattern as ak . 
  so if you master ak ( - which you should ) , you mastered the m4 as well . 
  i prefer to use the a4 . 
  because it has the same recoil pattern as ak so its one less thing you need to master . 
  also i like to prefire a lot of spots - which you ca n't really do with a1 . 
  and its cheaper - and every little bit helps on ct side :-) . 
  but i sure as hell would like the option to buy a1s for some rounds - for sneaky peaky plays with the silencer :d, 
  you want 80 + bronze certification - anything on top of that is ussually at a big price premium for not so significant difference . 
  you can look up 80 + program on wikipedia - it specifies how efficient the power supplies need to be at certain load . 
  also watch out for bullshit like 85 + that is just a ripoff - there is no such certification - some oems just put it on their psus so people buy it . 
  80 + is basically useless in europe though since it specifies only operation on 115v and not on 230v . 
  depends on your gpu . 
  but generally you should be safe up to like 100c, 
  i have fx8350 and no i do n't have trouble in minecraft lel :d, 
  the only games i remember having problems is rome ii and arma . 
  i guess but you have to take their word for it . 
  i 'd much rather get 80 + bronze to get official testef figures for 230v :-), 
  edit to clarify :, 
  80 + has no specs for 230v, 
  80 + bronze and up has . 
  do you have a good am3 + motherboard ? 
  if yes then you should upgrade to 8350 and overclock . 
  if you have a shit one then getting 1150 board and i5 is your best bet . 
  that is a good board . 
  if i were you i would just get a fx8350 some good aftermarket cooler and overclock it - 4.5 ghz should be easily attainable on air . 
  and that is a very good cpu that will only get better with time as more and more games with utilise more cores :-), 
  i am running fx8350 @ 4.3 ghz with hd7970ghz edition ( = = 280x ) and i am pretty damn happy with it . 
  i upgraded from phenom ii 965 ( similar tier as your current cpu ) - luckily my am3 motherboard got bios update that made it compatible with fx chips :-), 
  i work as a senior networking technician for isp so i 've got no problem with getting a good ip adress / forwarding :-), 
  well since its `` only '' medium-sized isp in czech republic i am affraid that i ca n't help you :-), 
  well i like to be humble - i am not a total linux noob . 
  just not one of those `` i 've been running gentoo for years and spend my free time compiling kernels '' type of guy . 
  i currently run voayage linux ( debian based distro ) on my home ap ( x86 pcengines wrap ) with teamspeak + i 've got college experience working with linux . 
  also i am pretty skilled ( or atleast i like to think ) when it comes to networking and firewall so i would have only the bare minimum ports open ( with all management - ssh and stuff being open only through vpn access ) . 
  all my firewall is handled through dedicated mikrotik hardware . 
  yes i am planning to install that - i was talking about os though :-), 
  i want my hw to run teamspeak and sadly teamspeak doesnt have arm server binaries so x86 was my only option ( i know about mumble but i and my friends prefer ts ) . 
  i already ordered the hw - its quad core jaguar 1,5 ghz amd cpu ( 15w soc ) miniitx board + dc psu . 
  i expect it to idle most of the time but still wanted to have some spare power if needed :-), 
  well i played with tekkit and few other mods . 
  i have n't played for a long time though . 
  `` hyper threading has no effect on gaming if you have 4 + cores '', 
  not entirely true - the effect is there but it is ussually too small to justify the higher price of i7, 
  well the soc has 15w tdp - i am expecting 15-20w system power consumption when headless idle - and i expect it to be running idle ( or light load ) for majority of the time . 
  i will update the post with kill-a-watt / little review when i get it . 
  i 've spare laptop but its c2d era with 35w idle power consumption - for that reason i am building new machine ( based around a4-5000 15w quad core jaguar apu ), 
  i 've actually used open suse before and i love yast for ease of management , but i read about the lack of long term support and that made me little bit scared ( i dont want to upgrade all the time ) .
