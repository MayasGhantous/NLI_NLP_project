  you are correct . 
  but price-to-performance there is still argument for amd . 
  if you 'd get like r7 260 to go with it it would be pretty nice pc to play most recent games at lower/medium specs, 
  honestly - i do n't think any game that is coop can be scary :-) :-), 
  do they still have the licence to make duke nukem games ? 
  brough to you by am1 from amd :, 
  cheapest possible that would make any sense - http://pcpartpicker.com/p/bfxzqs @ 150 $, 
  pretty decent machine for little more that could do some recent games on low/medium 720p -, 
  http://pcpartpicker.com/p/rv8tng @ 179 $, 
  id say @ 200 $ is half-decent computer for general purposes and light-gaming ( like leage of legends ) :, 
  @ 300 $ we can get solid kaveri http://pcpartpicker.com/p/ptftjx/by_merchant/ which should be sufficient for low/medium 720p/1080p depending on the game . 
  @ 400 is imho the minimum machine for gaming http://pcpartpicker.com/p/7kzbvn, 
  i liked the humor of dnf but gameplay was rubish :(, 
  i love amd for this :-), 
  why not just build am1 miniitx ... . 
  i do n't see all the value in those tiny x86 machines - they are not upgradeable and if something breaks you have to throw out the whole thing . 
  miniitx is imho plenty small for all intents and purposes ( if you take mobo with laptop jack and small case ), 
  imho am1 has to be comparable to stuff intel is putting in those really small nuc . 
  and it fits in something tiny as http://www.mini-box.com/m350-universal-mini-itx-enclosure so what the hell - imho its small enough . 
  jeez mate now i feel really stupid :-) didnt know about that thanks, 
  arent fm1 and fm2 heatsinks compatible ? 
  amd did n't really change their heatsink mounting since athlon 64 ( exception of course being those little am1 ), 
  and vastly superior ? 
  really ? 
  i call bullshit the i3 you are talking about is i3-4010u ( 1.7 ghz dual core ) which is slower than am1 athlon 5350 . 
  and the most expensive nuc intel sells is i5 4250u which is 1.3 ghz dual core cpu . 
  which is not really all that much faster than am1 athlon 5350 ( quad 2.05 ghz ) and the only reason why its faster is because it turbos all the way to 2.6 ghz and i am pretty damn sure that in those smaller nuc it would throttle ), 
   https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?mp[]=1944&amp;cmp[]=2195&amp;cmp[]=2012, 
  and of course am1 rig is considerably cheaper : : intel nucs come without ram , powerbrick , and storage ( also only supports sodimm memory which is more expensive ), 
   intel nuc d34010wyk ( i3 ) - 267 $ @ amazon, 
   intel nuc d54250wyk1 ( i5 ) - 350 $ @ amazon, 
   am1 build ( http://pcpartpicker.com/p/hhzvbv ) - 158 $, 
  its little bit bigger but that comes with its own perks - standard mini-itx , repairable and overall open system :, 
  ( 192 x 210 x 62mm ) vs ( 116.6 x 112.0 x 34.5 mm ), 
  here is your nuc competitor - fits right between the i3 and i5 intel nuc,

  ubisoft winning studio of the year ? 
  u wot m8 ?!? 
  is the new version of 0a . d. 
  actually playble ? 
  last time i tried playing it with a friend it got really laggy and choppy 30minutes into the game which made it almost unplayable . 
  another thing to watch for is how much your psu can deliver on 12v rail ... for instance my friend used to have cheap `` 650w '' psu that could only deliver 450w on 12v rail ... so it got go when we upgraded it yesterday :-), 
  make sure you get non-reference with good rma policy ... 
  but i would ` nt really be worried at all - even if you get it doa ( which is like really small chance ) you can just send it back ... 
  am3 + is reallly old now and i do n't think it will get upgrade ... ( and that comes from a guy who runs his 8350 on even older board designed for am3 :d bios upgrade ftw ! ), 
   am3 + - for perfomance cpus ... now in need of an upgrade pretty bad, 
   fm2 + - apus and budget cpus ( apus with disabled graphics ), 
   am1 - really budget socs designed for office , multimedia ... and maybe old games . 
  traitor !!!!, 
  arent 2x 7970 comparable to 980 ? 
  is n't that like wasting money ? 
  :-) ... ok sorry i wo n't judge :-) still rocking my one 7970ghz @ 1080p and couldnt be happier, 
  that 's true . 
  depends a lot on what games and when you play them - i mostly play games year + after release so most of problem is sorted out and i had zero problems when i run 2x r5770 crossfire . 
  ok i do n't know how many cards have problems but most of the time even if it has it can be `` solved '' by either a tiny overvolt/underclock . 
  depends on the price i guess . 
  its rumored to come watercooled out-of-the box but we 'll see :-), 
  one more reason to be part of team red :-) :-) :d, 
  i loved every minute of it definetely worth this price, 
  i loved every minute of it definetely worth this price, 
  1366x768 is perfectly acceptable on 13 '' display . 
  it has lot more pixel density than the most common display people use ( i.e. 
  1080p 24 '' - ( 120 vs 91ppi ) . 
  http://routerboard.com/rb912uag-2hpnd / http://routerboard.com/rb912uag-5hpnd, 
   + enclosure ( for instance http://routerboard.com/ca411-711 ), 
   +1 atheros minipcie wifi nic ( chances are you can pull it from a dead laptop you have or buy it off ebay @ 10 $ ), 
   +1 x 5g/2 .4 g directional antenna ( depends on band you want to use for `` backbone '', 
   + omnidirectional 2.4 antennas . 
  its not cheap but its the best solution - you have 2x seperate nics so you can put directional antenna on one to get best signal to your ap and then just bridge your seccond ap to it . 
  mikrotiks are proffesional grade solution wireless isps use . 
  i have to disagree with that . 
  if he would lay a cables and put unify aps at the end then yep that would be great solution but in wds mode with omnidirectional antennas ? 
  thats just crappy solution . 
  good point . 
  its still acceptable resolution imho for such a screen - and it allows you to play games with lot lower resources than if it were 1080p screen ( cause using non native resolution sucks ) . 
  i would advise you to just sell your hardware and rather buy a some hardware with lower tdp ... of course depends on what you need your server to do and if you want it to run 24/7 . 
  for instance they are supposed to soon release those am1 athlons without igpu ( you dont need gpu anyway you will run it headless ) . 
  and considering the you can get 25w quad athlon 2.05 ghz with igp + mobo for 90 $ the version without igp i expect to be around 20 $ + cheaper and draw less power . 
  that would be pretty damn sweet small silent home server + nas that does n't draw almost any power . 
  not to mention it also has sata3 and usb3 that other hw in this price range dont ussualy have . 
  yep its total bullshit, 
  am i the only one who simply does n't see the value in these offerings ( even when intel highly subsidizes them ... ) ? 
  seriously miniitx in m350 case is not that much bigger and you can mount it behind your vesa screen ... !, 
  and you dont have to get stupid bga parts with laptop ram on some stupid proprietary mobo ... 
  you can build m350 with am1 athlon 5350 for less money than these nucs which will give you more cpu performance , more graphics performance and its a fricking open platform - you can replace stuff if it breaks ... , you can upgrade it later on ... you can even overclock it .

  qualcom atheros has ussually much better driver support than competiton and its overall better product . 
  wanted to buy 285 for a friend pc recently but the deals on regular 280s were just tooo hard to pass :-), 
  looking forward to carrizo-l - supposed to be out in december, 
  its only a better deal if you are overclocking ... which of course no company is gon na do ... that would be a nightmare . 
  1333mhz memory ? 
  i would n't be anything less than 1600mz . 
  also 860k  pentium if you are not gon na crazily overclock that pentium .
