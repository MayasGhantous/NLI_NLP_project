  its not perfect but here is the cpu bench from the article . 
  we can see that the game scales well with more cores ( fx 6300 outperforming 4300 despite lower clockspeed , i7 2600k outperforming i5 4670k despite lower ipc and lower clockspeed and so on . ), 
  this is the case in most modern games comming out . 
  not every game uses more cores super efficiently but the cores do get used . 
  not sure if you posted the right article but the one you posted shows i7 beating i5 in every single game not by big margins but it does . 
  you do realize you are benchmarking older games right ? 
  i would suggest you look at gamegpu or some other site like that and go to the newest releases - and see if you can see a trend . 
  yes if you benchmark games from 2013 you wo n't see a difference . 
  and i was n't talking about value propositions at all ... but if you want to go there :, 
  i 'd rather buy xeon e3-1231 ( 8 thread haswell 3.8 ghz turbo ) for 254 $ and cheaper board ( b85 for example ) . 
  than i5-6600k for 249 $, 
  and expensive mobo , aftermarket cooler and overclocking . 
  the xeon would give me + - 20 % more multithreaded performance over the i5 @stock . 
  you would have to overclock that i5 like a mofo to catch up and overall it would be considerably more expensive and use up lot more power . 
  ( amazon prices ), 
   there is a near as no difference when it comes to frames per second in recent games . 
  recent ? 
  watch dogs - 2014, 
  tomb raider - 2013, 
  crysis 3 - 2013, 
  thief - 2014, 
  sleeping dogs - 2012, 
  metro last light - 2013, 
  far cry 4 - 2014, 
  grid - 2014, 
  the majority of games tested is + - 2 years old and older . 
  that is not recent that is steam sale bargain bin and it is not evocative of performance in latest titles ( check gamegpu for example for cpu benches ) . 
  in latest titles oooold stock sandy bridge i7 2600k regularly beats i5 4670k even when it has lower clock speed and considerably lower ipc . 
  hyperthreading more then makes up for it . 
  these older games are not optimized to use more than 4 cores very well . 
  latest games are much better though . 
  yeah exactly they test games that are 2 years old and older ( and most likely gpu bound ) and from that they draw conclusions that i7 makes no difference in latest titles . 
  well if they tested latest games and not games that are 2y . o. 
  and older and for example put some older i7 in the mix they would have drawn much different conclusions . 
  for example it sure as hell makes sense to buy xeon e3-1231 v3 over i5 6600k . 
  you get 20 % more multithreaded power for 5 $ ( and much cheaper platform cost . ), 
  where as this article makes the case that basically hyperthreading doesnt matter. ,, 
  oh ok good job m8 i5 beats i7 in a game from 2012 ... its 2016 now . 
  if you think those tests ( that are propably gpu bound anyway and all the differences are statistically insignificant anyway due to exactly that ) are relevant then by all means think that i5 is the best you can get . 
  gamegpu.ru are not legitimate ? 
  i sure think they are lot more legitimate site than some who thinks its okay to benchmark 2 cpus in 2016 using games from 2 years and more ago and firestrike ... one word - gpu bound . 
  http://gamegpu.com/%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82-gpu/action-/-fps-/-tps/ here you go there is a link for most recent benches . 
  meant e3-1231 v3 sorry for the confusion, 
  well what is also interesting is that now finally games are starting to use more than 4 threads . 
  if you look at the most recent games comming out in late 2015 and 2016 , majority of them uses 8 threads reasonably efficiently . 
  in ac : syndicate fx8350 even actually beats haswell i5 4670k . 
  so yeah if this trend keeps up then i have high hopes for zen - sligthly lower st performance then intel wo n't mean anything if the pack in more cores ( case study - sandy i7 beating haswell i5s despite lower clockspeed and lower ipc . ), 
  yeah propably but that xeon + basic solid b85 mobo + cheapo aftermarket cooler ( or no af cooler at all ) will be considerably cheaper than i5 + good overclocking mobo + good aftermarket cooler . 
  and the xeon will use much less power . 
  but sure you can actually overclock i5 higher - you just have to push it a lot - i personnally do n't think its worth it ... and seems like intel realizes this aswell ( i read article where they talk about how they gon na change pricing for those xeons in next gen. ), 
  its kinda sad how long title you have to have to not get downvoted by fanboys :-) :-), 
  eh tahiti is not sold as new . 
  damn i love capitalism . 
  something new comes out and in a year its dirt cheap :-), 
   public utilities and such, 
  ah you mean those run / paid for by the government ? 
  yeah those suck . 
  ca n't really blame capitalism for it though . 
  we live in a mixed economy . 
  more than half of income is taken and controlled by government = = socialism . 
  and thats not even to speak of regulation which severely limit the rest . 
  value is in the eyes of the beholder . 
  some people just like the mac experience and are perfectly ok to pay a little bit more for it . 
  yeah . 
  it sure is :-) they charge how much the people will pay for it . 
  what can i say i guess there is lot of people buying apple who do n't care about $ $ . 
  stock sandy i7 beats haswell i5 in majority of latest games ( late 2015/2016 ) . 
  so yeah i guess you are just fine :-), 
  i guess there is also lot of ram going to embedded systems , routers and such and even recently lot of it was still ddr2 . 
  i am just gon na put a one small data point of my overclocked fx8350 ( 4,66 ghz ) . 
  the same multithreaded performance in integer operations as a i7-5820k ... wow just wow . 
  if new apis can leverage this ... then i do n't know i wouldnt even need to upgrade :d, 
  i am not sure you are aware of vietnamese culture . 
  i live in czech republic and `` we '' have significant vietnamese minority living here ( third biggest minority in the country and `` we '' are the only european country where vietnamese telecom ( vnpt ) actually offers services ) . 
  let met tell you these people are the most enterprenuerial and hardworking i ever saw . 
  two thirds of them are either self-employed or running a bussiness . 
  you can be damn sure those people believe in capitalism and free market ... they are the free market . 
  for instance they control + -20 % of small grocery stores here ( yet there is only 0,3 % vietnamese minority in the population ) it 's quite astonishing . 
  and of course the bloody government keeps blabling on about how they should integrate more into our society and adapt more to our culture ... fuck that we have more to learn from their culture then they do from as . 
  this pc is imho kinda balanced - to upgrade you would basically need to rebuild ( new mobo cpu and gpu ) . 
  or you could go the used way - get a cheap quadcore xeon from ebay for your motherboard ( check first what cpus your mobo is compatible with ) . 
  and get used hd7770 / 7850 maybe also psu : _, 
  well i am + -95 % sure that if it supports the i7/i5 counterpart of that xeon then it supports the xeon aswell ( they are the same die ) . 
  but you should propably look up into it more . 
  throw it in the trash _, 
  that is the conventional thinking however if you look at cpu benchmarks for the latest games ( late 2015/2016 ) you can see that they start to use more cores resulting for example in i7 2600k outperforming i5 4670k and such . 
  so for future proofing the xeon might be a better deal than i5 - it has + -20 % more multithreaded performance at the price of slightly lower st. 
  yes that is imho the best cpu deal on intel side you can get . 
  you get + - 20 % more mt performance than similarly priced i5 . 
  and you save on platform cost ( no ddr4 and no overclocking chipset needed . ), 
  and if you look at the latest games ( late 2015 / 2016 ) you can see them using 8 threads resulting for example in i7 2600k outperforming i5 4670k . 
  sorry thats what i meant to say :-), 
  gamegpu.com does great job testing . 
  on the left you click `` test game '' then pick genre and it shows the newest games tested if you scroll down you can see cpu benchmarks and cpu utilisation . 
  eh 1241 3,5 base and 3,9 turbo . 
  in a lot of mobos you can lock it to be at 3,9 all the time - unless you plan on getting multiple highend gpus and wanting to play older games with them you wont see any difference . 
  on the other hand 1241 has + -20 % more mt performance than 6600k and it shows even in games ( newest ones ), 
  could n't you just use frtc for essentially the same effect ? 
  passmark score over 2000 is what i would recomend as the baseline for general pc usage - generally anything lower than that is too slow . 
  we do have fixed release date for polaris ( sort of ) .
