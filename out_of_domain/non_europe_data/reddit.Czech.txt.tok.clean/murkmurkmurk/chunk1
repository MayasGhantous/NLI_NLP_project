said someone stronk ? 
  * sniff sniff * yes , i can into stronk , thank you very much !, 
  that sounds almost simple !, 
  let 's make it more unclear !, 
  bohemia = \u010cechy , that 's dob\u0159e , but there is also \u010cesko ( the same \u010cesko [ czecho ] from \u010ceskoslovensko [ czechoslovakia ] , not \u010cechyslovensko [ czechyslovakia ] ) which is widely used , not `` formal '' synonym for \u010cesk\u00e1 republika . 
  the problem is , i guess , in constitution , since there 's only \u010cesk\u00e1 republika , therefore all authorities started to using it and it 's to late to repaint all signs !, 
  * reads it repeatedly , confusion intensifies * great , i no longer know where i 'm from . 
  czecho can not into using but stronk !, 
  if shqip sinking into the sea and no one is around but irrelevant palau , is it of makings any sound ? 
  the lack of consonants in english angsts me . 
  i 'm glad czechs are finally somewhat the `` good '' guys in according to adl survey . 
  to soften the happiness though , that 's most likely because there are next to non jews here . 
  have you just ... 
  ~ blushes, 
  move along , nothing to see here , just an obligatory `` west bank , best bank '' comment . 
  you silly americans , we have more than one school as well !, 
  it almost looks like they do n't know how the average works , huh ? 
  what a cutie !, 
  you can into have silesia whenever you of need , he 's a weirdo !, 
  gib kr\u00f3wki and is ok . 
  that does n't counting and is completely not true , 150 % of the 4 % are slov\u00e1ci who forgot to go home after 1989 and the rest 250 % are just other new slov\u00e1ci .

  ## slivovice unite !, 
  first getting stab for being religion in 1419 . 
  now getting stab for being not religion . 
  is not easy . 
  republic of crimea took its place for no apparent reason . 
  that 's why magyarorsz\u00e1g is startled and \u010cesko angry . 
  edit ( translation from english to english ) : slovakia 's ( slovensko ) flag is messed up , being very similar to the crimea 's flag . 
  czech republic is angry . 
  and the rest is demand to put slovakia back to its rightfull place . 
  sorry for your loss , you is of crimea now . 
  ## is not cannibal because it 's pronounced canniball . 
  awww , that 's cute , china brought its fireworks and the other rightfull clay to enjoy the party . 
  it 's their business , fun and okay . 
  the sad part is these local food-nazi bloggers putting everywhere on the internets , how we are undeveloped 3rd world hill-billies just because we do n't tip as ` muricans do . 
  i like how there is 1 kurva per country ratio and the only exception being czechy with 4 kurvas . 
  [ \u266b \u266a ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3tg1x5ewag ), 
  mind your own bulbusiness !, 
  slovakia , get your shit together , 75 per cent of those gypsies are imported from mud-hutts , ghettos and forests of yours !, 
  you are as silly as a ball giving another ball weapons of mass destruction and then invading said ball for it . 
  i feel offended , whatcha ' gon na ' do ? 
  and there goes the oldest question of them all ... 
  okay you two removers ... let 's calm down , shall we ? 
  and then remove poland , i want my house to become a beach one . 
  let 's say both are a mess . 
  the very existence of spelling contests is the proof something is rotten in the state of english . 
   richest countries, 
   kosovo as the country, 
  kosovo ... country . 
  interesting , serbia , interesting . 
  that 's the greatest idea since sliced bread !, 
  ` * tears of joy * `, 
  wrong meme usage , should 've been popular opinion germany . 
  off to gulag with you !, 
  [ totally truth . 
  i would agree on usage of eastern europe . 
  but only if anything east of us was already considered western asia . 
  if you were happily inviting hitler to your backyard ... `` go hug his dead body and never return , kthxbye '' sounds about right to me !, 
  a little bit of context , as i can not many into jokes :, 
  oxford english dictionary is considered an authority when it comes to english . 
  depicted oxford english dictionary , however is not only rubbish , written by poland but also without any trace of uk altogether on the few pages briton listed through . 
  that 's the last straw for the poor have-been-an-empire-once , as american english proven to be of more relevance once again . 
  none intended . 
  it 's india because of [ the guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satyendra_nath_bose ) after whom the boson is named . 
  i hope it does n't fall under the `` no real people '' rule , since it is just an easter egg . 
  if you do n't have any skill or power ... at least love your mother . 
  did n't know that . 
  well , the journey to siberia will be full of irony and love , if nothing else . 
  as a czech , i can ( sadly ) confirm this percentage . 
  boring , he 's not even the oldest one on the roster . 
  hopefully the kid will learn something new from martin ru\u010d\u00ednsk\u00fd who is 44 already . 
  american privilege : not having to watch neither nhl nor international matches at 1-3am . 
  original . 
  search for `` czech '' and you will find only 200 000 ocurrencies of the joke . 
  for the lazy : ~ 2.4 sam bennett, 
  true . 
  i died inside a little when i heard `` sverige '' clear and loud . 
  and therefore the world . 
  well played , slov\u00e1ci , well played . 
  it 's not like it used to be in general i would say . 
  no more `` just farm points from the low tier teams in 10:2 matches and let 's see who of the power 4 will get the gold . '', 
  true , he even kept his stick ... 
  you can get up to 3 hours to the past [ there ] ( http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/sport/zive-vysilani/ ), 
  \\* cough * [ kind of ] ( http://forvo.com/word/mikael_granlund/#fi ), 
  just for the sake of the song , though . 
  guilty as charged . 
  is there something more behind the `` it 's playoffs hockey '' as a reason to not call a penalty or is it just because otherwise it would be 3 on 3 all the time , therefore referees are more benevolent for the sake of games ' pace ? 
  jokes and goals aside ... why exactly is his nickname potato ? 
  ( yes in swedish ), 
  so you are the * gif * guy for today , right ? 
  wave to the camera for yes , two waves for no . 
  yes , i ** am ** entertained . 
  that makes you ... 6 gifs short to my liking . 
  also worth mentioning it was a 0-2 game for a while . 
  i 'm having cze-swe flashbacks from friday . 
  what a game . 
  i 'm not sure about these two jolly rascals , but the guy commenting cze-fra match is certainly not czech . 
  singing anthem , honoring veterans and projecting flags everywhere during every single pre-game ... 
  ... not caring about the world championships .
