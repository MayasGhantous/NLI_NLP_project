  no , `` slovo '' is `` word '' . 
  `` letter '' is `` p\u00edsmeno '' ( character ) or `` dopis '' ( thing you send via mail ) . 
  i 'd say it 's actually more likely reference to stanley parable demo .

  actually , bohemia ( \u010cechy ) is a part of the czech republic ( \u010cesk\u00e1 republika ) , other ones are moravia ( morava ) and silesia ( slezsko ) . 
  czechia ( \u010cesko ) should be used as a shorter form of the name czech republic . 
  and czech ... well , it really should be just an adjective but is very often used instead of czechia . 
  actually , it is n't even news . 
  it 's some kind of gossip or tabloid . 
  it 's a shame that nobody enforces rule iii ( no news ) here . 
  it actually means something like forge mountain .

  these are the ones i occasionaly use :, 
  most popupar and known in cz is probably www.alza.cz but i do n't really shop there because they have really annoying ads and their prices are n't that good . 
  you may also try price comparison websites like www.heureka.cz or www.zbozi.cz to find other shops or reviews for them . 
  ( edit : formatting ), 
  we do n't have amazon in cz . 
  in theory , you can order from the german one and use mail forwarding service but that 's really not worth it except for officialy unavailable stuff like kindle . 
  well ... 
  i do n't really know rusalka but i can see at least one error even in this libretto .

  you can also switch it globally in [ nvidia drivers ] ( https://wiki.videolan.org/file:nvidia-panel.jpg/ ) - this solves colour issue in chrome . 
  i 've never understood why it is set to 16-235 as default . 
  well , tetra pak is just carton box . 
  this gfy is more about that clever funnel thing he created on the top . 
  i can confirm that . 
  yesterday i was watching one citizen going from his suburb home to mall and he actually crossed one street without crosswalk . 
  but it was exception . 
  if he crossed streets ordinarily , his way to shopping mall would be lot shorter . 
  edit : i managed to find the location and found another jaywalker . 
  no mods installed . 
  no , i did n't have any intersections there at any point . 
  i think i also saw other cim crossing this street somewhere else . 
  i agree it could be because there 's no crossing nearby as / u/dakdak99 said . 
  edit : i was probably wrong . 
  i watched this street for few minutes and it seems that all cims deliberately cross it at this particular point . 
  lot of them went there , crossed and went back on the other side of the road . 
  so it could be some kind of bug . 
  this applies only on vehicles heavier than 3,5 tons . 
  well , it works in google photos on android . 
  i guess they probably forgot to implement it on website . 
  i noticed that if you use edit command , it displays little photosphere icon in the middle of picture . 
  video quality is pretty bad , but i managed to read the name of a restaurant !, 
  quick google search then revealed right location .

  these are from gta and they even write that as gruppe sechs so it 's definitely intentional pun .

  i do n't think aeronet is very trustworthy source as they have history of publishing hoaxes , conspiracies , anti-american propaganda etc.

  if it 's prepaid simcard then do n't worry about it and just throw it away . 
  czech operators do n't register these to specific person or credit card . 
  i even threw away multiple simcards with negative balance that i purchased over the internet , so operators could know my name and address . 
  huh , i see this on reddit quite often , so when i was in kutn\u00e1 hora i decided to go there too . 
  it was disappointing . 
  you pay 90 k\u010d ( $ 4 ) and they let you to small cellar with some stacked bones , few candleholders , chandelier , coat of arms and that was pretty much it ... 
  there 's nothing more than what you can see in this gallery . 
  i found st. barbara 's church on the other side of kutn\u00e1 hora much more interesting and i was n't even inside .

  it probably has czech keyboard layout which looks like [ this ] ( http://img.levneelektro.cz/imagesc/ea/a5/eaa5b885b15649c893842240a5bb246e-o.jpg ) and windows in czech language . 
  keyboard layout in windows can be changed and it 's not problem . 
  i guess you probably can change even language . 
  it 's possible at least on my czech windows 10 pro . 
  i do n't know how about home edition - i remember in win7 language could be changed only in ultimate edition . 
  well , in win10 you can configure whether it opens `` recent items '' or my computer . 
  in 8.1 it actually opens my computer .

  now i wo n't be able to view my photospheres even on g + !, 
  and it is n't possible to zoom photos too . 
  brilliant !, 
  i do n't get it too ... 
  i just changed it to ctrl-shift-tab . 
  it 's as simple as shift-tab to press and i usually do n't sprint , crouch and check scoreboard at once .

  what if i ca n't find my country even at global website ? 
  czech republic is n't listed anywhere . 
  edit : actually , it does n't really matter since local sellers are cheaper .
