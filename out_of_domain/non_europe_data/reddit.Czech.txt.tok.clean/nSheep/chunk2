  i installed cloudy g2 3.3 today and found this thing pretty annoying . 
  i tried some googling but only found threads like this one or the one with mods for [ changing navbar height ] ( http://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g2/themes-apps/mod-cloudyg2-3-1-3-2-navigation-bar-t3147734 ) . 
  i checked these mods and found out that the ones for cloudy 3.2 ca n't be downloaded and new ones change only framework-res . apk . 
  so i decided to give it a try and replace this file with old one from my stock 5.0.2 v30d backup . 
  after reboot - voila !, 
  bars are tinting the old way . 
  yay , no white bar in chrome !, 
  i have n't found too much shortcomings of this ... 
  i only noticed i ca n't find anything related to guest mode ( no status bar icon , i do n't remember where else it was ) and after flashing i had wallpaper changed to default one ( but changed it back to custom without problem ) . 
  also navbar height is higher than cloudyg2 . 
  it can be changed using xposed module g3 tweakbox back to cloudy 's 38 .

  since you 're from poland , you probably know allegro.pl . 
  aukro is czech version of it . 
  you can definitely sell agricultural machinery on aukro . 
  i can see some tractors and excavators [ here ] ( http://aukro.cz/pracovni-a-zemedelske-stroje-73128?order=pd ) . 
  i know in german they are called `` wash bears '' and in czech it 's something like `` washer '', 
  unfortunately it does n't display correctly when using night mode in res . 
  i remember i was having similar issues on kitkat . 
  if this is same issue , it had something to do with quiet time . 
  i mean i had it disabled . 
  by default quiet time is set to 22:00 -6:00 ( 10pm-6am ) . 
  since it was disabled , it did n't switch phone to silent in the evening . 
  but if i enabled silent mode manually , it would turn off silent at 6 in the morning . 
  i did n't really solved that , i just changed quiet time period to time when i usually did n't use silent mode ( 12:00 -12:01 or something ) . 
  dammit , something similar happened to me couple of times one year ago when i was on kitkat - mine said `` redfox hp : redfox disconnected '' . 
  and i actually managed to solve that but i ca n't remember what was that . 
  i only remember it was some checkbox or option i enabled earlier . 
  sorry , i ca n't remember more . 
  in the eu , you should get info about allergens for every food on the menu . 
  restaurants in cz * usually * write numbers from the list of allergens next to food names . 
  if not , they should tell you which allergens it contains upon asking . 
  so this could help you too . 
  in your case , you should look for allergen 7 . 
  anyway , ravers ' translation is correct . 
  i actually do n't understand what english speakers do n't understand . 
  english has plenty of words like : world [ vrld ] , bird [ brd ] , murderer [ mrdr-r ] ... 
  we just do n't write letters we do n't pronounce . 
  is it german ? 
  i know something very similar which always seemed to be czech and it 's called `` z poh\u00e1dky do poh\u00e1dky aneb kreslen\u00e9 pornohr\u00e1tky '' but never heard anything about origin of this series . 
  even czech movie database does n't have info about director or country , only year 1980 . 
  some links to episodes , not on youtube for obvious reasons . 
  i can see that file in ` % appdata % \\ . . \\ local \\ vivaldi \\ user data \\ default \\ login data `, 
  i can tell you for a fact that czech language does n't use letter q very often . 
  only in words adopted from foreign languages . 
  others suggested trying google maps - i do n't think there 's any location in cz with q in its czech name . 
  according to urban dictionary , it 's monkey scrotum . 
  that 's awful . 
  have you heard about that american custom of halloween ? 
  people go house by house to scare the shit out of others . 
  lot of people are so afraid they barricade themselves and do n't go out whole week . 
  well , out cat did exact opposite . 
  she hid her kittens every time we discovered where they were ... 
  in the end , she brought them to our malamute who played with them and killed them . 
  we arrived from school when 4 of 5 were dead and she carried last one . 
  it 's website by authors of android police and uploader of this particular app is founder of both so i do n't have any issues trusting it . 
  i use vivaldi several months and never had problem like this . 
  no flash , ublock disabled only for some channels , dash not disabled ... only difference is i have 32 bit version . 
  64 was bit unstable and buggy when i tried it ... 
  so you may want to try 32 bit . 
  i once saw in release notes that npapi is enabled . 
  but i have n't used any npapi plugins so i can not say if these actually worked at some point . 
  [ [ regression ] npapi is disabled : re-enabled on windows and mac vb-11358 ] ( https://update.vivaldi.com/update/1.0/relnotes/1.0.344.37.html ), 
  this happened few times to me too . 
  the url looks like urls of extensions ... 
  but i have n't investigated it any further . 
  second try always opened correct page . 
  wow , nice , thank you !, 
  i was missing features pocket extension has in firefox after i switched to vivaldi . 
  this looks very similar to what i was used to . 
  can confirm . 
  i use old atom nettop as kodi box connected to tv using dvi-to-hdmi cable . 
  i was surprised when i found out that i do n't need separate audio cable . 
  just a little note to css editing of ui . 
  it 's done in application folder for now , so you have to edit files after every update . 
  backup your custom.css file in case folder for older version of vivaldi gets removed during update . 
  i hope vivaldi will get ability to create custom userchrome in profile folder as firefox has . 
  i read somewhere that feature requests can be done using bugreport form . 
  so i sent this request there . 
  looks simple . 
  i 'll fill it in later . 
  there 's joke : boy goes to the bar in czech republic and asks for a beer . 
  bartender says to him : `` beer ? 
  you 're small boy , you should drink juice . '', 
  boy : `` i 'd like to , but i have only 20 czk . '', 
  that is definitely czech . 
  vyp\u00edna\u010d means `` switch '' ( although shift would be `` posun '' ) , z\u00e1mek is `` lock '' and row \u011b\u0161\u010d\u0159\u017e\u00fd\u00e1\u00ed\u00e9 is on czech keyboard layout even to this day .
