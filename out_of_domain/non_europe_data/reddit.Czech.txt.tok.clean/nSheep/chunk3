  hmm , there 's for example `` m\u00edt '' on czech wikipedia . 
  but very next sentence says that this word is not always `` empty '' verb and it depends on context . 
  i do n't know . 
  i think it could be [ \u017delva by olympic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb2m8w-ysso ), 
  there 's also option to add notification bar `` key '' to navigation bar on stock rom . 
  i 'd recommend installing mapy.cz app to your phone . 
  it 's really good offline map of czechia . 
  it could help you in case you get lost . 
  it does n't have offline route planning yet but they promised it should be available before summer . 
  i think even smaller supermarkets like penny , albert or lidl allow paying with euros , but their rates are not very good indeed . 
  it 's better to pay with credit/debit card in those . 
  it did n't give focus to address bar . 
  but i can set alt + d to address bar in vivaldi : / / settings/keyboard / ( it 's in the last group `` page '' ) on windows 10 without any problems . 
  on the paper : we wish good luck in the contest to our czech fans . 
  in the video they also speak about anniversary of their ( emirates ' ) airline to prague . 
  i think i read that city 17 in hl2 is actually inspired by prague ( especially [ panelaks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panel\u00e1k ) ) and couple of other european cities like budapest or even amsterdam . 
  agreed . 
  i googled if i 'm not mistaken about prague and i found article that mentioned amsterdam too but i have no idea what could be inspired by it . 
  water/canals maybe ? 
  anyway panel buildings in hl2 looks exactly like from prague or other czech cities . 
  i remember my old windows mobile htcs with extusb connector in place of 3.5 mm jack . 
  it was pain in the ass and i hated it . 
  adapter for headpones required , can not charge when using headphones , can not use headphones when charging ... 
  but today it is different with widespread android . 
  if someone decides to remove 3.5 mm jack and replace it with some kind of extusb-c abomination i probably can just buy phone by different maker instead . 
  i 'm not sure if there 's anything without flash . 
  czech tv 's website uses flash . 
  but you might be able to watch it using their phone/tablet app . 
  it 's called \u010ct sport and its on google play , itunes and even ms store . 
  hello , thanks for this ama and giveaway . 
  all questions i can think of are probably already asked . 
  except one stupid little thing in new crimson drivers that i ( and bunch of others on amd forums ) did n't find answer to . 
  old catalyst drivers had setting profiles which could be quickly switched from tray menu and also option to switch color space for video playback between 0-255 and 16-235 . 
  new crimson drivers miss both of these . 
  my dashcam records in `` wrong '' colorspace and its software can not change color space internally so my night videos from car are very dark with most of black `` out of range '' . 
  will these options ever come back ? 
  pretty please . 
  no , he wants mouse gesture which works same as pressing ctrl + t. 
  i do n't think there 's way to do it . 
  both gestures for new tab and background new tab have their alternate actions which can not be disabled . 
  personally i 'd actually appreciate it the other way around . 
  gesture only for opening link but not for new `` empty '' / duplicate tab . 
  i guess we should send requests for option to split these gestures . 
  * i 'd love to have custom css for ui in profile directory , same way as firefox has userchrome.css , so i do n't have to edit css after every update . 
  * ( or alternatively ) option to move bookmark bar next to address bar and option to set side panel switch width to 1px . 
  then i wo n't need custom css at all . 
  * also , i 'd like to split mouse gestures for new/duplicate tab and open link in new ( background ) tab , because i use it only for opening links and if i miss link it opens empty tab unnecessarily . 
  * oh , and also option for middle click to open link in foreground tab . 
  i use extension for that now but it 's sometimes lazy and switches to new tab with delay . 
  nice . 
  but that 's not kutn\u00e1 hora . 
  as a czech i think that most of czech people realize that our language is not very easy for foreigners . 
  it 's really nice if you try , but it really is n't requirement . 
  especially in the center of prague . 
  btw , if you really said `` angliska '' and she did n't understand that you mean `` anglicky '' ( = in english ) she 's probably stupid or not czech . 
  from prague ? 
  sadly , there 's no direct connection . 
  train goes north to \u00dast\u00ed nad labem first and then to kv . 
  i can confirm this . 
  also , i reported this problem in march . 
  one thing anyone can do is setting up filter in res for words like `` attack '' , `` isis '' , `` refugee '' etc. 
  works really well . 
  he made his archive on twitch for subscribers only as benefit for people who pay for subscription , so they can immediately access past streams . 
  but he allows reupload for most of his streams so you 'll probably find it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/totalbiscuitstreams ) or on some other youtube channel couple of hours ( or days ? ), 
  later . 
  no , what contributed to this accident is that mercedes run red light . 
  red-orange lights up several seconds after the other way has red . 
  if red-orange was n't a thing and green lit up instead , situation would be same . 
  i can see couple of reports about anniversary celebrations in local news websites but none of them mentions any problem or loud music . 
  just summaries that there were light shows and videomapping etc. 
  adding to that , czech pronunciation is close to `` ha - well '' , i guess . 
  [ czech pronunciation in google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/?text=havel#cs/en/havel ) is quite good . 
  in translation , it 's something like `` serrated one '' or `` toothy one '' . 
  i do n't think it saves tab state . 
  i mean i had twitter page opened with `` view 5 new tweets '' bar and after hibernating tab and opening it again , it just reloaded whole twitter like using f5 and displayed new tweets . 
  [ vranov castle - pantheon ] ( https://mapy.cz/turisticka?x=15.1897915&amp;y=50.6408039&amp;z=16&amp;source=base&amp;id=1853118 ) in front and [ fr\u00fdd\u0161tejn ] ( https://mapy.cz/turisticka?x=15.1747497&amp;y=50.6465053&amp;z=16&amp;source=base&amp;id=1833688 ) in back . 
  nice !, 
  oh , it 's on the left !, 
  almost did n't notice . 
  are you sure that filmmaker is called mimo film ? 
  traffic sign `` mimo film '' on your picture means '' ( no entry ) except film '' - it 's not name of a company . 
  this feature was removed in lollipop update . 
   the men who stare at goats, 
  i only heard this title translated to my language where `` goats '' could be colloquial term for `` tits '' . 
  it 's just about animals ? 
  notifications on facebook can also be disabled [ here ] ( https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=notifications&amp;section=push&amp;view ) , i think . 
  that 's not correct . 
  \u010cechy ( bohemia ) is a part of czech republic ( like moravia and silesia ) . 
  \u010cesko ( czechia ) is short name for czech republic . 
  i remember when i got my first glasses i actually felt my hand-eye coordination was not best because everything was slightly off . 
  but you just get used to it after couple of days . 
  there was also [ experiment ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down ) in which guy wore glasses to see everything mirrored upside down . 
  and he get used to it after few days too . 
  out brain is pretty flexible in these situations .
