  blend it and then drink it quickly , you will not feel full while you are drinking it , but later you will feel full, 
  use fruits and fatty stuff , nuts even if your mixer can take it, 
  create a schedule and force yourself, 
  well , i do n't talk about it unless the person asks , then i calmly tell them why , no apologizing , i just tell them about the ethics and answer their questions . 
  i do not tolerate stupid comments , if somebody starts being a cunt , i do n't waste my time with them . 
  i do n't like backing down and blaming allergies and personal reasons and all that , just because some people are cunts . 
  demand respect , do not apologize . 
  ( very shitty comparison : how many people would bother a devout religious person about their beliefs ? ), 
  just make it clear that you do not tolerate that . 
  well allergies have nothing to do with veganism . 
  if the person is on a plant based diet because of health , then it 's called a plant based diet . 
  if they are vegan * and * have allergies , then that is not the reason why they are vegan . 
  ( if it is , then =  plant based diet ) so they would still explain why . 
  i do n't . 
  ** vegan ** = ethical reasons or ethical reasons + health and whatever . 
  ** plant-based diet ** = no ethics , just personal gain/health/whatever / fitness, 
  ** vegan ** = ' i give a fuck about animals , ( i may or may not care about myself/health/other stuff ) ' ** plant-based ** = ' i do n't care about the animals , i care about myself/health/whatever reason to be plant-based which is not ethics ', 
  reminds me of uncooked ramen, 
  there are cows like that being held at the vet uni where i live , there is nothing new to be observed , they have been doing it for decades . 
  now they just test cow food for farmers and companies . 
  it 's fucking pointless and stupid . 
  the 22 vegan diet should be called 22 plant based diet , the word vegan implies ethical reasons ... 
  just take black paper and glue it to a normal art folder, 
  where i live the local refugee center helps immigrant women , usually older , find jobs like maids or nannies . 
  it helps them while they sort out their situation . 
  they are usually educated polite people . 
  a lady from eastern europe was a live in nanny for a friend 's kid , and it was cheaper than daycare , she was really good with the kid , she did n't speak the language much at first but the kid was like 3 so it did n't matter . 
  later on she learnt the language and did the exam to let her practice medicine in my country because she was a doctor in her country . 
  maybe reach out to the local immigrant community and say how much you can pay and what you are looking for ? 
  keep on going , failure is n't anything to be ashamed of . 
  nearly nobody gets everything right the first time they try . 
  you gain experience whether you fail/win . 
  i 'd say try a duct tape wallet but that really depends if you are okay with looking like a 14yo . 
  ( i am , i have an orange one and i love it , it 's durable and very slim . ), 
  even better , try lojban, 
  go vegan and raw , eat lots of veggies , try intermittent fasting, 
  i like the name , it 's playful and easy to remember . 
  you need to reorganize your priorities , look into minimalism , quit your job , take a break , start pursuing your passions , live a meaningful life, 
  you look really hot and cute now !, 
  err , ca n't you just delete the ones you do n't use ? 
  what would be the point of this ? 
  wow you look really young !, 
  congrats on achieving your goal !, 
  i 'd give you no more than 35 !, 
  https://cronometer.com/ ( i prefer it to myfitnesspal actually , especially if you are doing 80/10/10 or vegan ), 
  if it was marketed as vegan thenfuck them , boycott, 
  is that a guinea pig with a rat ? 
  be careful , rats can kill other rodents , usuarry it is a bad idea to let them interact, 
  it 's basically raw food diet but with ` cheating ' , if done healthy then it can work , but be sure to eat some nuts and drink a lot if you do raw food ( and use the non-raw food cal restriction to make you stay on track ? ), 
  it 's weird, 
  yeah wire mesh stinks , throw it out and buy a cage that has treated bars , really , wire mesh is not ideal for a rat cage , invest in a good cage like the critter nation or savic royal suite, 
  well be careful , as long as you are watching ... a woman had a guinea pig and 2 rats together , and the rats killed the guinea pig , it bled to death , she found it half eaten . 
  all in matter of hours , the rats were used to the guinea pig . 
  or rats killing birds that they never harmed ... maybe your rats are extra nice , but normally you 'd be risking death/bad injuries . 
  you can get used to it , check out freelee the banana girl if you want to see the ` extreme ' version , but yeah it is a big leap from eating ` normally ' , go with what you can do , 
  c'mon how old are you ? 
  cook for yourself , take veganism seriously , everytime she gives you a non vegan meal , write out what animal products are in it , think/write down where they come from , what animal cruelty leads to your food ... 
  stand up for yourself , stand up for your beliefs , stand up for the animals . 
  replace meat with : tofu , seitan , robi ... to lose weight just do not use any animal products , add more veggies , use less fat . 
  i see that you like raw food , just stick to it then . 
  your weightloss will do better when fully vegan , and personal gain is not an excuse for supporting animal cruelty ... 
  better than buying books is just reading stuff online, 
  what rules did you have to follow ? 
  do people follow them voluntarily or are they pressured into it ? 
  did you have problems leaving ? 
  did they give you a hard time ? 
  did the community turn on you ? 
  s/he is right , do not take their eggs, 
  you can not own a living being ... the eggs are theirs , you have no right to take them, 
  if there are too many eggs and you * have * to do something with them , give them away =  anybody who gets the eggs will not ` need ' to buy eggs from hens that live in horrible conditions and give money to the industry, 
  =  there is no scenario in which it would make sense for you to eat the eggs , it would always be more ethical to give them away ... ( / sell ? 
  and invest the money back to the hens , buy them better food ? 
  housing ? ), 
  but try to leave their eggs be ... if your family is already taking eggs , that means that there is no excess eggs , so let the hens keep their eggs, 
  as for the fertilization , do you have any males ? 
  oh and maybe they are walking away because they are used to people taking the eggs away ... 
  * mob mentality * wow that sounds like ... religion * dun dun dun *, 
  well stay strong !, 
  what about kids that want to live , but the parents refuse a transfusion ? 
  how is that looked upon ? 
  ( especially if the kid dies ? ), 
  are there any food restrictions ? 
  well sure , it 's okay to take their waste , bedding and all that , bit it 's not okay to take their kids , their body parts and their ` products ' , and also i do n't think op understands the difference between ownership and guardianship, 
  what do you do with male chicks ? 
  it 's the same with kids , you are their guardian , but that does not mean that you have a right to use them, 
  yeah , what do they do with the males to keep 5/50 ratio ? 
  no , that is pretty much obvious , do they need their poo in any way ? 
  does it have any purpose for them ? 
  poo is their waste , they get it out of their system because they have no use for the food anymore , they took what they needed and now they are getting rid of it ... ( there are exceptions , if you use them for their poo then it 's obviously wrong , like with the coffee eating little monkey animals ( forgot the english word ) when they hold them in cages just to get their poop ... ), 
  animal sanctuary and vegetarian ? 
  uhh , i hope it 's a mistake and they are all vegan ... 
  wow !, 
  that 's awesome !, 
  yeah , fuck them , veganism is about the animals , not fucking food , i will proudly submit my shitty vegan food , my potato mustard nachos with big chunks of carrots need to be seen and loved !, 
  i love it, 
  your trainer is trying to pump you up , so you start working hard again , she means well , and you should listen to her , work out until the negative feelings go away , work out and you 'll make her proud of you, 
  lovely !, 
  keep on going !, 
  i love your hair !, 
  how does it feel to be hot as hell ?
