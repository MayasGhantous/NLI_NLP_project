  just do n't do anything weird in front of the cops . 
  there is no strict definition of ` weird ' , so if the cop drags you to the jail - you were acting weird , do you best to avoid doing that again in front of the cops . 
  tip # 1 : always take your id, 
  as a result foreign reporters write boring stories about political life for last 10 years , completely missing some underground events - you 'll have to disciver then by yourself . 
  tip # 2 : stick with locals , learn to read in russian/belarussian - and you 'll find something you fancy, 
   are they afraid of russian invasion ? 
  never met those kind of people , russians are pretty much integrated . 
  the worst case scenario here is one day your boss tells you `` our company is now owned by russians , now go back to work '' .

   this has the disadvantage of tracker reindexing it after you started tracker without the external drive connected because it thought the files got deleted, 
  this is why external hdds are not supported yet - too many edgecases to support them . 
  ideally it would be solved by a grilo plugin , but this is not yet implemented . 
  make sure you have tracker scanned your music files and these are from your music or downloads folder, 
  plot twist !, 
  music will not display other tracker-indexed dirs except xdg 's music and downloads . 
  it can be tricked , but this is the default setting,
