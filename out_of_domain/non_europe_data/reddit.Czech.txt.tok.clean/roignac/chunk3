  ponomarev is a part of the russian parliament and voted for several controversial amendments for copyright laws ( being an active speaker at pirate party events ) . 
  a question for him would only be ` how do you sleep at night ? ', 
  our sub reddit might even host an ama, 
  whoa . 
  / u/jcaps766 , would you please ask him is he 's interested in emigration to ukraine then ? 
  that 's okay , thank you !, 
  i hope the conference was enjoyable,

  i 've set this to upload some photos from `` ` ~ / pictures `` `, 
  this however can be changed without a rebuild : `` ` flatpak override -- filesystem = xdg-download org.mozilla.firefox `` ` iiirc, 
  `` ` . / build.sh `` ` sets up a local repo and pushes updates there . 
  this repo can be shared with other users ( similar to git repos ) . 
  use `` ` flatpak update -- user org.mozilla.firefox `` ` to pull updates .

  yes , you can override default manifest settings without rebuild :, 
  `` ` flatpak override -- filesystem = xdg-download org.mozilla.firefox `` `, 
  filesystem options are described in [ the docs ] ( https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/wiki/metadata ), 
  i 'm not entirely sure , you probably should ask at #flatpak on freenode - or [ file an issue ] ( https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/new ), 
  i 'm using official branding in this package , so i guess i can not even if i wanted to . 
  i 'd prefer firefox people take care of that, 
  the repo is 820 mbs , i guess more cleanup patterns should be added to decrease this, 
  i 'm using mozilla 's repo ( the github mirror ) . 
  i do n't even want to bother with that - ccache is growing , i wo n't be able to host the repo and can not commit to regular updates . 
  mozilla folks should pick it up if they are interested . 
  on my t440s it took about an hour and a half to rebuild it , so it should be pretty much doable to anyone interested . 
  i 've realized that it gives a writable access to downloads only , other home dirs are read-only . 
  yes , setting it to xdg-download is a good idea, 
  mozilla has verified that debian 's version does n't affect the quality significantly and since march debian has firefox package with mozilla 's trademarks . 
  there are two options here :, 
  * ovh 's kernel has the same quality as ubuntu 's kernel - this means canonical tries to make ovh pay `` for protection '', 
  * quality of ovh kernel is significantly lower - you can still call it ` ubuntu ' if you give canonical a couple of bucks, 
   would they be allowed to call it an iphone ? 
  they are allowed to call it ubuntu for now , for 1-2eur per month . 
  if they 'd receive cease and decist letter the discussion would be totally different, 
   which it clearly was n't, 
  that 's very debatable - a lot of people in this thread think that ovh did n't modify ubuntu code ( they did ) . 
  several small bugs did n't misguide people into thinking that ubuntu is buggy and unreliable , so it falls pretty much into nominative use imho, 
   ovh and dreamhost can simply strip out any ubuntu/canonical references and name their distros , say , ovhuntu and dreambuntu . 
  i wonder how well their sales depts . 
  would work after such move . 
  that 's insufficient . 
  they have to strip ubuntu name from the whole distribution - package name , changelog , documentation . 
  ah , sorry , i thought ` simply ' is the keyword , as this task is definitely not trivial, 
  i wonder what 's dreamhost is paying for then . 
  their ubuntu images are not modified iirc, 
  no , a quick google search does n't give me the info . 
  how does canonical support will resolve in case i 'll ask to resolve a problem with dreamhost 's ubuntu ? 
  will they take the case or ask me to reinstall ubuntu from trusted sources and reproduce the problem ? 
  does asking money from ovh means ` we commit to resolving the problems with your modified version ' ? 
  centos crew rebuilds prepared srpms , replaces three packages - and voila . 
  its an automated process btw . 
  its definitely not that easy in ubuntu world . 
  some say that it was implemented like that deliberately, 
  that is the best outcome we can expect - making ovh code land upstream ( even if its at least ubuntu kernels ) . 
  thank you for bearing with me, 
  i doubt that upstream project will work on issues from such patched packages,

  this has encouraged brave young men and women in western ukraine to rebel to the point of toppling a legitimate president and led to the utterly predictable debacle whereby vladimir putin has annexed part of the country and now casts a long shadow over hopes of genuine democracy in the rest of it . 
  * its easy to check if it builds with latest/3 .20 / ... gtk version, 
  * sharing a build repo for bleed-edge users will help a lot with finding bugs . 
  since flatpak deploys a prepared binary with defined build options it would eradicate issues introduced by difference in compiler/dependencies . 
  * it a safer way to run a new and untrusted app, 
   but it seems unlikely that the tax will be enacted . 
  the proposal , which would need the support of six of the 11 members of the board of supervisors to be placed on the ballot in november , has the public support of just three . 
  even if the board approves the measure , it would require the approval of two-thirds of voters in november to take effect . 
   skeptics say it is difficult to define what a tech company is , and they criticize the measure for singling out companies based in the city while the giants of silicon valley are not affected -- even though thousands of their employees live in the city and have contributed to the income inequality and high housing costs .
