  that feature was [ not accepted ] ( https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/13450 ) upstream , however red hat applies that patch , so `` ` -- block-registry `` ` would work on fedora/rhel/centos .

  that 's weird , most likely its selinux policy error . 
  anyway , arch linux does n't seem to have oci hooks installed , so this instruciton wo n't work yet, 
  switch to a different tty ( ctrl + alt + f3 ) and run it there . 
  in this case a x/kde/gnome crash wo n't affect the dnf . 
  another option is to run it in screen/tmux, 
  instead of a crontab you can also put a php script in cmd/run instruction of the container and use host cron to restart the container ( or use systemd 's timer if available ) . 
  the rest of the structure looks sane to me, 
  sure , you can set cron to restart the container every 5 mins, 
  yeah , it wo n't work in this case . 
  you can however use daemonset if you use kubernetes . 
  ctrl-alt-f1 or ctrl-alt-f2 ( if you use gdm ) will take you back . 
  you probably should n't be doing things recommended by some stranger on the interwebs before reading docs, 
  the syntax for ` config.ini ` is described at https://github.com/willthames/ansible-review#configuration and its usually placed in ` ~ / . config/ansible-review/config . ini `, 
  ` lint ` should point to a directory, 
  lint rules are similar to standards , but used for a bit complex structures . 
  i 'm not entirely sure about this , but in ` standards.py ` we have :, 
  selinux_is_enforcing = standard ( dict (, 
  name = `` selinux must be in enforcing mode '' ,,

   does the container have to shut down to get the new code from github ? 
  or how can i make it so that if i change code in my hub , the docker container keeps running and updates dynamically ?

   it 's no coincidence that he keeps casting himself as the victim . 
  his supporters have already succumbed to the premise that trump is a conservative outsider -- a noble underdog , determined to fight the establishment and to speak truth to power . 
  having accepted that premise , they are predisposed to take any criticism or disagreement as further evidence for trump 's claim that he is surrounded by powerful enemies who are determined to thwart him for their own selfish or corrupt or ideological reasons . 
  his ultimate failure will be taken as proof that the game is rigged -- against the candidate , but also against people like themselves , his supporters . 
   it was from the rand study that the false rumor started , claiming that the arpanet was somehow related to building a network resistant to nuclear war . 
  this was never true of the arpanet ; only the unrelated rand study on secure voice considered nuclear war . 
  however , the later work on internetting did emphasize robustness and survivability , including the capability to withstand losses of large portions of the underlying networks,

   consider iraq . 
  after each pounding from u.s . 
  warplanes , iraq has dusted itself off and gone right back to work developing a nuclear arsenal . 
  six years of tough talk and u.s. fireworks in baghdad have done little to slow iraq 's crash program to become a nuclear power . 
  they 've got missiles capable of flying nine hundred kilometers -- more than enough to reach tel aviv . 
  they 've got enriched uranium . 
  all they need is the material for nuclear fission to complete the job , and , according to the rumsfeld report , we do n't even know for sure if they 've laid their hands on that yet . 
  saddam hussein would n't let un weapons inspectors examine certain sites where that material might be stored . 
  the result when our bombing was over ? 
  we still do n't know what iraq is up to or whether it has the material to build nuclear weapons . 
  i 'm no warmonger . 
  but the fact is , if we decide a strike against iraq is necessary , it is madness not to carry the mission to its conclusion . 
   the prevailing russophobic mood today means tillerson 's professional relationships with russia will be interpreted in an antagonistic way . 
  sen. john mccain ( r-ariz . ) has taken the lead on this .
