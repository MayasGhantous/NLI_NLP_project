  1070 gets about 50-60 fps at 1440p maxed . 
  to reach even 100fps at 1440p you need a 1080 , and even then you wo n't max most games to reach those framerates . 
  benchmarks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op0wrvjqh5u, 
   i 'm just now thinking that if 144hz only triggers when fps exceeds 144fps ,, 
  not sure what do you mean by this . 
  you do n't need to reach anywhere close to 144fps to see benefits of a 144hz monitor . 
  even as low as 75-80 fps on 144hz already looks a lot better than anything on 60hz monitor , and of course the higher fps you have , the better it is . 
  if you go for 1440p 60hz , the smoothness is the same , it 's still 60hz . 
  you 're getting higher resolution but it wo n't look any smoother than 1080p60hz in motion . 
  it 's because while you have tons of monitor manufacturers , the actual lcd panels are manufactured by just few companies and only a small amount of those go into desktop monitors . 
  this is why tons of 1440p monitors have backlight bleeding problems ( all use same panel that suffers from the issue ) or why there are n't any 1080p 144hz ips monitors ( nobody makes them so the manufacturers ca n't put them into monitors ), 
  lot of people believe that just because it 's 144hz , you actually need 144hz to see benefits but it 's wrong . 
  144hz is just the limit and it can show anything below it just fine and it makes a difference as well . 
  just like you can see a difference between 15 , 30 and 60fps on a 60hz monitor , you can see a difference between 60 , 80 or 144 on a 144hz monitor . 
  it 's actually kind of mind boggling that people think stuff that applies to 60hz monitors would n't apply to 144hz one . 
  whether windows will work on another pc ( or motherboard to be precise ) depends on the licenses and i have no idea how it works now with win10 and their versions that they pushed on everyone . 
  other than that , there is no problem with switching a disk with os install between computers compatibility wise besides having to reinstall the correct drivers for the motherboard . 
  and if you copied the win10 from older hdd and kept it as it was , same applies to that . 
  you can always look at specific benchmarks for the game in question and also look at recommended specs ( although it varies how will the minimum/recommended setup actually handle the game and sometimes it ends up being pretty meaningless ), 
  with gpus it 's simple from a hardware standpoint , you can roughly see how powerful are they compared to each other on that site you posted ( actually maybe not the best site seeing how high 780 stands but that 's besides the point ) and the cards also have vram with similar limitations to your normal ram . 
  it gets a bit trickier when it comes to real life performance because some games are `` optimized '' for one of the brands ( in reality it 's more like a dev forces overusing technology that your card is good at to kill performance for the other brand ) so a stronger card might actually perform worse . 
  however , you can always decrease graphical settings to get reasonable performance out of cheap or old gpus or better performance over graphical fidelity from newer gpus so unless you 're going for a specific target like wanting to play most games maxed out at 60fps and 1440p , you 'll probably be able to play any game with a fairly recent gpu . 
  for cpus you have 2 factors in performance , number of cores/threads and single threaded performance ( ie . 
  how fast individual core is ) . 
  nowadays you want at least 4 threads ( lots of games wo n't launch with just 2 ) but at the same time , having more threads than that often is n't supported in games at all or there are huge diminishing returns . 
  games love strong cores and so single threaded performance is probably the most important thing about cpu once you get past those 4 cores ( or threads ) . 
  both multithreaded and single threaded performance is measured in benchmarks like cinebench where you can compare how good is a processor on a certain frequency compared to others . 
  now again , in reality how good of a cpu you need depends on multiple factors , mainly what kind of games you 're playing ( if they can use multiple threads well or at all ) , how demanding is it for gpu compared to cpu ( which includes resolution you want to play at ) and what framerates are you targeting . 
  for 1440p and i 'm assuming 60hz the 6500 should be fine for `` regular '' action games because you wo n't have much more fps than 60 anyway with 1070 . 
  of course if you want to play games that are more cpu demanding like gta5 for witcher3 or games that are all about cpu like strategy games and want higher frame rates than 60 , then you really want overclocking because stock speeds just do n't cut it for 80-100fps in a lot of games ( you wo n't be getting that maxed out with a 1070 at 1440p though ), 
  you should find it on the manufacuters website for the specs of the psu in question ( and same for gpus ), 
  that said , this is really only relevant if you buy garbage no name psus ( which you should n't be doing in the first place ) or are n't completely sure if your psu can still support the new gpu upgrade . 
  however , majority of people nowadays are already buying complete overkill psus for their systems and overshoot like 200-300w over what their system actually needs . 
  aside from higher framerate the ai turns will resolve faster assuming the game is normally programmed and the ai turns take so long because of the ai and not some stupid stuff like hidden animations . 
  though i have n't played civ5 , in paradox games overclocking makes a huge difference during late game and whether the game becomes unplayable crawl or smooth/semi-smooth sailing until the end .

  of course the longer the turns ( more ais and larger map ) , the bigger the difference between stock and oc .

  nothing should happen regardless where you touch but you probably want to avoid all the pins , if nothing else then to not bend them . 
  do n't have cryorig but in [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knf-ghqthro ) the person just flips it and uses the heatsink as a stand which would probably be what i would do . 
  i always recommend 550-650w 80 + gold seasonic or evga for single gpu setups . 
  some people might consider them expensive but if there 's one thing you should invest in for your pc , it 's a psu . 
  a bad one can take all your other components with it while a good once will last you at least over 2 different builds and they usually come with 5-10 year warranties . 
  no simply because a thermal paste is too thick ( edit : i hope that 's the correct word ) to drip anywhere . 
  for ddr4 ram 2133mhz is the stock speed and everything above is technically overclocking . 
  if you 're planning to buy a 960 you should probably wait until 480 instead . 
  cheaper and considerably faster . 
  unless you want the answer to be gpu that is . 
  next upgrade should be ssd, 
  monitors come with dvi/vga cable,
