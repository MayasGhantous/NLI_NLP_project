  for games , the 6700k will be better . 
  it simply depends on what do you want more from the cpu , more cores or faster cores . 
  you can easily try to test fps affecting screen tearing for yourself . 
  run a game with native frame limiter where you can reach 240fps ( quake or cs 1.6 are great for this ) . 
  disable vsync, 
  now since your gpu frames are n't synched together with the monitor , if you lock your fps to 60 on a 60hz monitor , a tear line will periodically run across your screen . 
  now if you increase fps lock to 120 , the line will run across the screen twice as fast and be a lot less visible . 
  and finally , when you increase fps limit to 240 , the line will be almost completely invisible . 
  this is easily reproducible proof that increasing fps above your refresh rate produces visible effect on your screen, 
  if you want to maximize framerates , it does make a difference in games that can utilize the hyperthreading , but in strategy games this is n't often the case . 
  for most strategy games , single threaded performance is king so definitely overclock the cpu . 
  some newer strategy games supposedly utilize multiple cores well ( tw : w , c : s and presumably civ6 ) but unfortunately most tech sites still ca n't do proper cpu benchmarks and i did n't google enough to know how much difference does i7 make over i5 there . 
  for others like paradox gsgs , you could probably run the game on oc 'd pentium and it would perform the same as oc 'd i7 because the game maxes out 1 thread and that dictates how well the game runs . 
  i do n't think you 'll regret the i7 if you have the money . 
  from those benchmarks you ca n't exactly say the i7 does n't help because they focus on wrong parameters . 
  the c : s benchmarks has the right idea but simply does n't have a big enough city to push all those cores to max and we have no idea if the thread scaling goes beyond 4 cores or not . 
  the civ 5 benchmark is completely useless and basically a huge waste of time . 
  nobody cares about average fps in a tb game , what 's relevant is how long are ai turns during late game on a large map with many ais . 
  tearing happens even if you run at fraction of your monitor refresh rate ( as you will see at 60hz 60fps vsync off ) because even if your gpu produces same amount of frames as the monitor displays , without vsync the gpu does n't keep the frame until the monitor is ready to display it . 
  i ca n't explain to you exactly what refresh : fps ratio produces what kind of tearing ( and frankly , you can just try it for yourself ) , but for example 100fps on a 60hz produces entirely different tearing compared to 60/120fps . 
  either way , higher framerates cause less visible tearing ( and also lower input lag between the frames ) even on a 60hz monitor so saying that any higher fps than 60 on a 60hz monitor is useless or even placebo is just plain wrong . 
  on a z170 board the m. 2 pcie lines are independent from from actual pcie slots ( usually they are shared with sata-e ) so you can use m. 2 drive without worrying about it affecting your gpus or other cards . 
  decent difference in cpu bound scenarios depending on the game . 
  in something like ryse the difference was 50 % but that is an outlier . 
  psu is the one part you do n't want to save money on because if a low quality psu fails , it can fry other components in your system as well . 
  i 'd recommend getting a gold rated psu but which one reallly depends on the gpu you will get in the future . 
  for your build you can just get like a 300-400w gold rated seasonic , but if we add 100-150w from a low end gpu , you might want something around the 400-500w range ( again , i 'll recommend seasonic because not many psu manufacturers have good psus when it comes to low wattage since they are harder to make ), 
  i do n't think any games will benefit from 32gb , if you want to spend money on ram , get a faster one with better timings since that actually makes a difference in some games [ arma being a good example ] ( http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/1171/bench/arma3.png ), 
  for the cpu , if budget is n't an issue , there is n't a reason not to get a 6700k . 
  in games that support more than 4 threads , it will give you a noticeable fps increase over and i5 . 
  it should be noted though that not all or even many games will necessarily take advantage of i7 's more threads and in games that do n't ( and i think arma 3 and dayz are such games ) , you wo n't really see any performance gains over an i5 . 
  paradox games are even worse with threads and will max just 1 , which means an i3 at same frequency will perform same as an i7 . 
  for these reasons , for most cpu intesive games , overclocking is usually way more important than having more threads and i 'd recommend you to do that . 
  i7 will give you longevity for all games that will utilize more than 4 threads . 
  this is becoming more common but that does n't mean that all games in future will . 
  looks like overheating , i had the same issue with phenom 965 on stock cooler and had to get aftermarket otherwise it would throttle . 
  sure , if you have a decent psu and motherboard you might even be able to oc a bit , giving you slightly better performance . 
  use a program to make a bootable usb installation from the disk . 
  edit : unless you ca n't now access the disk at all , but i think the only relevant thing from it ( if it 's windows ) is the license key anyway so you can really download an . iso from anywhere and use that legally . 
  it 's easier to be more efficient with higher wattage , so there are n't many manufacturers making efficient ( gold rated ) low wattage psus, 
  the cpu has weak singlethreading so it will never have huge fps in games that ca n't use all those cores ( which is majority ) , but 30fps seems a bit too low and i think it 's simply throttling from the heat and aftermarket cooler will make it better ( at the very least it should remove the stuttering entirely ), 
  unless windows 10 does it automatically for you , you 'll need to install the gpu drivers as well afterwards, 
  6700k will have marginally better singlethreading performance but i do n't think it 's good enough to justify buying new ram and motherboard so go for the 4790k, 
  try increasing ram voltage to 1.4 or 1.45 before you put new sticks in . 
  if it was 1080p it would be an easy yes but with 1440p you will be getting anywhere from 50-100 fps in modern games ( ~ 80 in the games you mentioned ) and ~ 80fps will be when the cpu starts bottlenecking . 
  you 'll probably have to see for yourself since it will depend from game to game and whether you will play everything maxed or lower details in favor of fps ( causing more bottlenecks ), 
  i 'll always recommend 144hz over 1440p for games but you 'll need a good cpu to go with otherwise you 'll get bottlenecked a lot at high framerates . 
  i 'm not the type of person to give a lifespan estimate to hardware ( since it 's highly subjective when it 's time to upgrade depending on your budget , what are you doing with it and what do you expect from it ) but it 's slightly weaker than 6700k and oc 'd 6700k is the best cpu you can get for gaming right now . 
  so if you can overclock it that 's probably the most cost efficient upgrade you can make . 
  1.2 v is what stock sticks use , 1.35 is what oc 'd memory uses and 1.4 is very conservative safe voltage recommendation . 
  you need to post first hence giving it more than it potentially needs , if you actually post with all sticks in there you can tweak the voltage further . 
  yeah try that . 
  and make sure the sticks are at 2133 defaults , not their rated speeds . 
  if it does n't work try the other pair of sticks first . 
  whether there 's a big difference in latency depends how big the difference is and what are you doing . 
  that said , the 5ms/1ms numbers is a very misleading number to consumer and does n't really tell you much more than the technology used ( ie it 's not ips if it has 1ms latency listed ) . 
  look up review at tft central to see actual real world latencies of the panels . 
  stock coolers have the paste pre-applied . 
  not even gtx 1080 is a good enough card to run demanding modern games maxed 144fps, 
  1070 can run maxed demanding games at 1440p at 60 average fps, 
  480 will be weaker than those ( how weaker ? 
  wait for benchmarks ), 
  for 1080p 144hz it will work fine ( you can always lower graphical fidelity and at higher framerates cpu tends to become the bottleneck in cpu demanding games ) . 
  that said , even reaching 80 + fps is considerable improvement in how the game looks and plays on 144hz compared to 60hz . 
  for 1440 , you can expect to run games at 60fps on lowered details ( 390/970 or better performance ), 
  i 'd probably be happy with 480 for 1080p 144hz ( i actually use 144hz monitor with a 270x but i do n't care about playing on low and rarely play aaa games anyway so cpu does all the work for me besides aaa games ) . 
  it really depends how much fidelity do you want and how demanding games do you play . 
  definitely wait for 480 benchmarks and how well it ocs first since those are pretty big questions to know before deciding on paying more for stronger gpu ( right now it can be anywhere from a better 970 to a better 980 at stock frequencies ), 
  480 should be stronger than a 390 ( by how much ? 
  wait for benchmarks ) and it will also remove the big cpu overhead amd cards currently suffer from which is important for 144hz . 
  from those cards the 980ti is the best choice but whether it will be worth buying over a 480 depends on how good exactly the 480 is and the price difference . 
  i5 4400 is a decent amount slower than a 6500, 
  i5 6500 give you the best best bang for your buck . 
  so people who want that buy a 6500 and people who want performance buy a 6600k and get unlocked chip with it . 
  another problem with the 6600 is that you can overclock locked chips on skylake . 
  this means that instead of investing those $ 20 into a 6600 , you can invest them into a z170 board instead and simply get those 300mz back with overclocking , except now you can overclock even more for higher performance gains and you can also use faster ram than 2133 , which again makes a difference in cpu bound scenarios . 
  for z170 you do n't have to worry about it at all . 
  the chipset itself has extra pci lanes individual from those that your pcie slots use and having m. 2 ssd wo n't share anything with a gpu for example . 
  the performance boost is there but do n't expect same jump as you get from hdd to ssd since in a lot of cases the bottleneck is no longer the disk but the cpu instead . 
  there is something better than 1440p or 4k , it 's called 144hz . 
  1440p 60hz monitors cost around the same a 1080p 144hz . 
  do you have a high refresh monitor ? 
  the high refresh being only relevant for `` super competitive '' games argument comes often from people who never actually tried it . 
  60hz does n't in any way look nice and crisp the moment anything moves on the screen compared to even 80fps on a 120 + hz monitor . 
  and sure , there 's an element of preference as well , some people who have consoles genuinely prefer 30fps at 1080p over 60fps at 720p , but i do n't think many pc gamers who are used to at least 60fps would play many games at 30fps even it they looked better compared to 60fps . 
  and with 120/144 or more it 's the same . 
  you 're wrong about locked cpu not supporting more than 2133mhz ram . 
  that only depends on the chipset ( you need z170 for oc 'd memory ) . 
  also whether he will notice a difference or not depends entirely on games , but whenever he is cpu bottlenecked faster ram generally helps [ 1 ] ( http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/1171/bench/arma3.png ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er_fuz54u0y ) . 
  you can argue that he probably wo n't get cpu bottlenecked with that processor if he 's targeting 60fps but that 's entirely different matter from the claims you made . 
  you see benefits of high refresh monitor starting at 75-80fps which at 1080p is entirely doable with the components people buy for 1080p60hz , on older and less demanding games ( which is what people spend most of their time on generally ) 100-200 fps is a realistic goal . 
  i guess i was wrong and in us they are n't . 
  in my country the cheapest 1440p monitors cost the same as the cheapest 144hz . 
  i 'm running a 3200mhz ram with a i5-6400 , care to explain that then ? 
  higher refresh rates makes a difference even when moving cursor across your screen at windows , of course not saying that 's a good reason to spend money on it . 
  of course for tb games you can argue higher refresh rate is n't necessary but as long as you get those frame rates , everything will be smoother as with anything else . 
  you can get a 144hz monitor around that price or even slightly cheaper but it will be tn ( unfortunately no high refresh rate 1080p ips monitors , only 1440p ) so if you really want a budget monitor , you have to choose one or the other . 
  price , if you can afford it ( and the gtx 1080 to get at least those 80-100 at 1440p in demanding games ) , go for it . 
  you just said i ca n't get higher ram frequencies than 2133 unless i have unlocked chip , which i do n't . 
  also , what if i tell you that i can overclock the cpu frequency of the locked chip as well with my motherboard ?
