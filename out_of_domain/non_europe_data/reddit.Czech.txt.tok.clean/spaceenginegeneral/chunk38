  in your situation it would be a lot better to build extremely cheap pc and as you get money to replace the cheap components with better ones . 
  you ca n't do this with a prebuilt because prebuilts will never have quality core components ( like psu and motherboard ) that you need to build on because that 's where they save money . 
  that 's not the point though . 
  this is about op considering paying $ 80 for ~ 5 % performance increase when he could pay $ 110 for ~ 200 % increase instead . 
  sure , you can argue that the ~ 200 % increase might not be that visible in real world usage ( and i 'm not arguing otherwise ) , but why the hell would then op pay almost the same amount of money for a 5 % increase ? 
  you can put any gpu into any mobo pretty much , the limiting factor tends to be psu instead . 
  i think it 's upgrade on the edge of `` worth it '' , i 'd recommend making a bigger jump to a something like the rx470 instead . 
  you can hook it up and everything will be there as it was before . 
  however , if you have os on the hdd still , you might need to set up correct boot priority in bios ( because both drives now have os on them and both of them will try to boot up the os that 's on them ) . 
  everything will stay on the hdd as it was before , if you have a new os installation ( rather than cloned os ) some games and programs might not start because they will be missing registry data in your new os . 
  chipset , features , quality of the components . 
  in your case when comparing a mid range z170 board that already have all the basics to high end z170 board where you 're getting extras you probably wo n't use and pay a it more premium on top , the difference most likely is n't worth it but at the lower price points the differences tend to be bigger . 
  if you 're heavily overclocking good power delivery is for example critical and cheaper boards use low quality components for it compared to more expensive boards, 
  your ram is ddr3 and skylake uses ddr4 so it 's not compatible . 
  yes, 
  the i5 is overkill for general browsing but for editing it makes sense compared to an i3 and will speed things up so keep it . 
  2x8 is probably overkill unless you dad likes 100 tabs open at the same time but it does n't hurt and is n't that expensive and again , for editing it might come in handy . 
  either way go for 2x4 or 2x8 as dual channel speeds things up compared to single channel . 
  you do n't need a gpu , integrated one in cpu will work fine for this purpose, 
  you plug everything in the back of the pc ( ie . 
  motherboard ) . 
  i have no idea about uk prices and only picked through the partpicker so keep that in mind, 
  changes :, 
  * better psu, 
  * ditched hdd in favour of 500gb ssd, 
  * did `` z170 treatment '' , this means barely slower stock cpu ( 6500 instead of 6600 ) but more expensive board that allows you to use more than 2133mhz ram ( so i added 3000mhz sticks which will make the setup at stock on average faster in cpu bound tasks compared to the 6600 you picked ) . 
  you 'll be also able to oc even the locked cpu in the future if you ever feel like you want more from it , and/or it gives you a cost efficient way to upgrade into an unlocked i7 without buying a new motherboard . 
  this is probably somewhat controversial expense that many here would argue against ( especially if you only target 60fps ) but i 'm heavily biased towards having good cpu/ram over gpu since cpu will last you longer than the gpu and cpu cost efficient upgrades ( which includes overclocking and faster ram ) are way harder than buying a new gpu . 
  if you buy a h110 board , you basically ca n't do anything about lacking cpu perf without buying a new motherboard so while this is more expensive up front , in the long run it will allow you to save money . 
  * changed the 1060 to a 4gb 480 . again , this is probably controversial but i consider the 4gb 480 to be the best bang for you buck when it comes to mid range gpus especially since i think majority of people overvalue vram size . 
  if you wanted a bit faster gpu for the system and the pcpartpicker is n't lying about it i 'd get the [ 250gbp r9 fury ] ( https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/bt8h99/xfx-video-card-r9fury4tf9 ) which costs the same as 1060 you were considering but will perform a lot better . 
  aside from the other suggestions here , i 'd ditch the hdd and get a 500gb ssd instead since it 'll end up costing roughly the same and honestly i believe that majority of people who follow the small ssd from programs + large hdd for storage idea ( which originated in times where the largest ssd you could reasonably get was 120gb and most people opted for 60gb ) will benefit a lot more from having everything they can on ssd instead of being able to hoard every piece of media they can find . 
  not saying there are n't people who will genuinely use up 1tb hard drivers but i 'd always get a larger ssd instead ( and there is n't anything easier than adding the hdd afterwards if you 're constantly filling 500gb anyway ) . 
  especially in the age of digital distribution and fast internet where you can redownload whatever you want when you feel like playing it .

  changes :, 
  * switched to z170 board , not a lot more expensive and allows oc in future ( even locked chips ) but mainly you can get faster ram ( replaced 2133 with 3000mhz , virtually same price and pretty big difference in cpu bound scenarios ), 
  * ditched hdd in favour of 500gb ssd, 
  * better psu, 
  * maybe somewhat controversial but i went with r9 fury which costs pretty much the same but should perform slightly to a lot better than 1060 depending on games . 
  alternatively save money and get a 4gb 480 [ for $ 180 ] ( https://pcpartpicker.com/product/84m323/msi-radeon-rx-480-4gb-gaming-x-video-card-radeon-rx-480-gaming-x-4g ) which will trade blows with the 1060 anyway but will be a lot cheaper . 
  unlike most people i do n't think smaller vram is big deal . 
  well researched build and my only problem with it is a cheap 4 phase z170 board , especially since you 're planning to oc from the get go .

  cheapest 8 phase motherboard i could find , balanced out by picking slightly cheaper ram sticks ( same speed and actually better timings than previous ram ) . 
  if you need to stay within $ 1100 exact you can save few more bucks with a cheaper ssd, 
  with skylake you have [ vrm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voltage_regulator_module ) on the motherboard . 
  this means it 's up to the motherboard manufacturer to provide adequate power delivery for the cpu . 
  if you are n't overclocking this is irrelevant since all the boards will have good enough power delivery for stock chips ( and most skylake boards have chipset that does n't allow overclocking anyway ) but the issue with cheapest z170 boards is that while they allow you to overclock you still only have the vrm intended for skylake at stock voltages . 
  obviously , most people will assume that since they are already paying a hefty premium for the z170 board it should handle actually being overclocked but the reality is that they 're paying for the chipset to allow it , not for the components to handle the load . 
  so once you run the overclocked system for some time , sooner or later the board will fail since the components ca n't handle it . 
  now , phases are n't everything . 
  quality of inductors , capacitators , cooling of the vrm , whether the phases are true or doubled , hybrid or digital all plays a role but the variety between z170 boards is pretty small and pretty much all the 4 big manufacturers use equivalent layout on their midrange offerings . 
  counting the phases by the number of inductors around the board is by far the easiest way to tell when the manufacturer stepped from the stock 3-4 phase vrm to something that can actually handle oc . 
  it should handle 60fps but i would n't call it adequate cpu for that card . 
  i 'd recommend at least an i5-6500 but i5-6600k would be ideal . 
  well , you can put them both in but you ca n't really use them in the way you think . 
  best solution would probably be to resell the 1060 . 
  theoretically dx12/vulcan support combining whatever gpus you want ( even amd and nvidia ) but i do n't think any game beside ashes of the singularity actually implements that yet, 
  r9 200 can mean a lot of things , huge difference in 270x and 290x . 
  if you have n't overclocked your cpu i 'd do that first and afterwards probably gpu upgrade . 
  people having compatibility issues were probably talking about m. 2 ssds . 
  yours is sata which should n't have any problems . 
  yes . 
  you do n't really need to `` overclock '' ram nowadays unless you want to go above rated speeds . 
  just load xmp profile in bios and you are good to go, 
  well if you 're having trouble with cpu intensive games , investing into gpu will provide you absolutely no benefit . 
  overclocking is the way to go and should hep a lot . 
  are you asking about whether to oc ram or cpu ? 
  you can do both and individually the benefit from 3.5 ghz to 4.5 ghz 6600k and 2133mhz to 3000mhz ram will be the same on average ( though results will probably differ on games ) . 
  obviously best results will be with both overclocked . 
  that said , since getting ram to your rated speed ( those 3000mhz you 're buying ) via xpm takes 2 seconds in bios while overclocking cpu is a bit more involved and includes trial and error when testing stability , there 's no reason not to do the former immediately and the latter once you feel like it .
