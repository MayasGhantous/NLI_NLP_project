  in my opinion vast majority of people who do n't have a great idea what to look for ( and who are most likely to use site such as logical increments to inform themselves ) will never fill up a 1tb hdd yet would greatly benefit from having a 256gb ssd instead ( or a 500gb ssd instead of a hdd and 256gb ssd ) . 
  including a hdd in every single build is a leftover from several years ago when affordable ssds were small ( 60/120gb ) and downloading from the internet actually took time . 
  and now that i ranted about the site , these deals look okay i guess though sometimes maybe a bit too focused on getting a good deal instead of a getting a good part ( looking at the msi z170a sli , great , you 're saving $ 45 but why are you buying a $ 130 4 phase motherboard for a build with overclocking in mind when 8 phase motherboards retails at around $ 110-120 ? ), 
  sounds good to me , get a fast ram as you have a z170 board and eventually you can even oc the locked i3 with it ( even though the power delivery is n't best and wo n't handle heavy oc for long ) which should give you roughly an i5 performance . 
  well i do n't know what makes a mobo `` gaming '' but a z170 motherboard with 8 phases will cover almost everything you need and be good enough for overclocking , they go for around $ 110 . 
  otherwise a cheap z170 motherboard that will still have all the chipset features ( full speed m. 2 slot , usb 3.1 , allow faster ram than 2133mhz ) but wo n't have good enough vrm to sustain long term overclocking will be about $ 80, 
  yes , good fit . 
  you should wait for kaby lake/zen , they are just a few months out and you wo n't get an amazing deal to upgrade your cpu until then, 
  ram is good , msi gaming m5 ( ~ $ 130 ) , asrock extreme4/k4 ( $ 120 but the latter has some promo and you can get it for $ 90 ) are good midrange boards that can handle oc if you ever decide you want to get a bit more longevity from your chip ( or allow you to buy an unlocked i7 down the line ) and of course will let you utilize the faster ram . 
  edit : though unless you already have the 8350 consider waiting for zen , it 's not really upgrade worth the money . 
  i would n't bother . 
  since you 're not getting z170 for faster ram the difference between the 2 cpus would be about 10 % ( though the 1050ti will probably bottleneck you first depending on what you 're playing ) . 
  especially with zen just few months away . 
  there is n't unfortunately , only z170 . 
  however , the cheapest z170 boards are only about $ 80 which is comparable to h chipsets anyway and the weaker components when it comes to oc wo n't make a difference for you if you wo n't oc so look into that . 
  it 's worth it just for the ram since 2133mhz to 3000mhz has on average ( depending on games and if cpu is the bottleneck of course ) the same impact as overclocking from 3.5 ghz to 4.5 which is pretty significant . 
  ram : no though it might help minimizing possible compatibility issues . 
  also whatever you buy will run at the speed of the slowest stick . 
  cpu : cpu bottlenecking is n't yes/no answer since it depends how demanding the game is on gpu as well . 
  higher resolutions and low framerates make cpu less likely to be the bottleneck but again , some games will be entirely limited by cpu regardless what gpu are you using . 
  overclocking is safe as long as you have adequate cooling and stay within recommend voltages ( find haswell oc guide on r/overclocking . 
  your cpu can degrade over time with oc but even if that happens , in reality it just means that you have to decrease your oc , you 'll still get better performance with slightly less oc 'd cpu then you 'd have with a stock one . 
  for higher refresh rate and high fps you should definitely prioritize cpu over gpu since you can always lower graphical fidelity to alleviate gpu bottleneck but once you hit cpu bottleneck , there are rarely ways around it besides cpu oc and ram oc . 
  also , cpu load often is n't as consistent as gpu load which can cause stuttering and framerate drops when you 're cpu bound . 
  waiting . 
  you wo n't get worthwhile upgrade to what you have for $ 200 . 
  entirely depends on games , resolution , framerate . 
  with low target framerate like 60fps the cpu should n't have problems when speaking about gpu biased games ( aaa games for example ) but with some games the gpu requirement is very low and your performance will be always entirely reliant on cpu ( for example various simulations and strategy games ) . 
  what did you want to accomplish ? 
  if you want to change where your browser downloads you need to choose that in your browser, 
  also the downloads folder is probably a shortcut and you just changed what it opens . 
  hard to say , on the one hand if you 'll be getting a 1440p monitor the 1070 will be definitely way better for it , on the other hand if you get a 480/1060 ( and i 'd probably get a 4gb 480 over those instead , better price/perf ) now , they should handle your current display just fine and in 2 years the 1070 performance will be available in a $ 200 midrange card again if you 'll feel like the card is n't enough for your future monitor . 
  144hz monitors already accomplish the same thing that adaptive syncs do from the high refresh rate . 
  so if you get 100-120 + min framerates you 're not really benefiting much from gsync on top of it . 
  the main benefit from gsync is eliminating tearing which is extremely visible when it happens in low framerates like around 60 but with high framerates it 's really barely noticeable if at all . 
  other feature of gsync is smoothing out frame drops which would otherwise cause noticeable stutters but again , if you 're not dropping from 100 to 60 or from 60 to 40 , this is n't an issue with high framerates . 
  of course the question is if you can keep your framerate consistently above 100 at 1440p which will depend on your gpu and how much do you push graphic settings . 
  if you want to play at ultra and do n't mind 60fps then you will benefit from gsync a lot . 
  no , i just think 4gb vram is easily enough for a midrange card and it 's definitely the best price/perf card ( possibly along with 470 but that one is weaker ) on the market now . 
  people love to `` future-proof '' themselves with 8gb cards but you can count the games that utilize more than 4gb on 1 hand and all it takes is change textures from ultra to high , a difference that you probably wo n't even notice during actual gameplay and you 're good to go ( and that 's ignoring that these cards are probably not even good enough to play these games and keep a good enough framerate in the first place ) . 
  i know newegg has the msi version ( great cooler ) for [ $ 180 ] ( https://pcpartpicker.com/product/84m323/msi-radeon-rx-480-4gb-gaming-x-video-card-radeon-rx-480-gaming-x-4g ) . 
  i do n't really follow deals besides what i see around here since i 'm not from us so there 's really no point . 
  i also heard about a 480 ( down know which one exactly ) with a civ6 code that you can sell and get a net price of like $ 170 , so you might look at that one as well . 
  there 's no consensus how should you distribute money exactly . 
  some people will prefer to invest into a strong gpu while others might want a better cpu which is more cost efficient in the long run but wo n't help you run new aaa games at ultra settings . 
  in general you 're weighing between a good upgrade paths ( for example , investing a bit into a z170 board which gives you faster ram and ability to oc your cpu as opposed to saving money and buying a h110 board for half the price but no way to get more from your system later on ) and immediate performance ( buying a 1070 which allows you to run games at 1440p on ultra but is very expensive compared to everything else and will lose value the fastest ), 
  now that i think of it , there are also [ r9 fury deals ] ( http://pcpartpicker.com/product/m2mxft/sapphire-video-card-112470340g ) , not much more expensive than a 1060 but performance-wise way ahead . 
  also scales better going to 1440p than any other card thanks to hbm so if you 're thinking about buying a 1440p monitor , another option perhaps . 
  toms hardware has pretty rough estimates and it 's not really great for comparing cards that are in similar tiers from my experience , it 's okay if you have an old card to see where it roughly stands but that 's about it . 
  it 's actually surprisingly difficulty to find recent benchmarks that have both 1060 and fury ( non x ) , from a quick search techspot compared the 2 in their last 3 benchmarks ( [ titanfall 2 ] ( http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/1271/bench/1080p.png ) , [ bf1 ] ( http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/1267/bench/1080p.png ) and [ gow4 ] ( http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/1263/bench/1080p.png ) ) . 
  maybe way ahead was n't a good choice of words and from this sample size the 4gb 480 looks still like a better deal but you 'd get a bigger jump from 1060 to fury compared to 480 to 1060, 
  intel since it 's nvme and is n't limited by the sata interface . 
  the samsung is a standard sata ssd with m. 2 form factor . 
  it 's not mentioned in the spec sheet in the link . 
  and if they do n't tell you basic information in the spec sheet ( and we 're not talking about specifics like a model here , just basic information like what 's the psu rating and wattage , ram frequency and what chipset does the motherboard has ) , there 's probably a reason for it . 
  of course , especially at 144hz . 
  unfortunately people here have the habit of taking a broad generalization ( in this case 1070 being a 1440p card and 1060/480 being a 1080p card , except this was always about playing games at 60fps ) and then repeating it like some kind of mantra and after some time when when they see anything better than a 1060/480 and 1080p in the same sentence they assume it must be a complete waste . 
  if you want to play demanding games on high/ultra at 144hz you pretty much need a 1070 even at 1080p . 
  that 's not to say that 1060/480 wo n't manage those framerates if you lower the details ( also all of this assumes your cpu is good enough in the first place ) but most of the opinions here are still based around the assumption that everyone plays at locked 60fps . 
  yes , overclocked i5 or an i7 is what you want for 144hz, 
  overclocking simply means that you tell the cpu to run faster than it 's stock setting , adding voltage to achieve it . 
  this causes more heat which is why you need aftermarket cooler to be able to do that along with a z170 chipset . 
  it 's pretty simple and you can pretty much get a `` free '' ( if you do n't count the cooler and more expensive motherboard ) performance out of your cpu . 
  check out r/overclocking , there 's a guide for skylake oc in the sidebar somewhere . 
  your build is good , only changes i 'd make would be motherboard with better power delivery ( most cheap z170 motherboards allow oc but do n't have quality components to sustain the increased load ) . 
  from msi that cheapest one that has is the gaming m5 which should be around $ 130 , slightly cheaper options would be asrock k4/extreme4 and asus z170a and pro gaming . 
  another suggestion would be ditching the hdd and investing the money into a 500gb ssd instead . 
  some people love to hoard everything they find and will use up the 1tb hdd but i think for most people having a larger ssd and being able to use it for absolutely everything is a better option . 
  you can always add a hdd later if you really need the space . 
  i 'm not sure how you understood being able to use 2 different gpus , if we 're talking about gaming and sli/crossfire , you can use 2 same gpus ( with xfire it 's a bit less strict ) but in general you 're better off buying a strong single gpu instead because using 2 gpus will always scale worse if it is supported at all . 
  having additional monitors plugged into a gpu wo n't have any effect on gaming assuming you 're still just using 1 monitor for the game itself . 
  for most people probably the one that came with the cooler . 
  as you said , pcie 2.0 is n't saturated yet so that does n't matter . 
  965 especially at stock will bottleneck pretty much every modern card at any reasonable framerate so you should probably upgrade cpu first ( maybe wait for zen ? 
  this should be a top comment . 
  majority of `` simple questions '' questions ( often even not so simple questions ) get answered there because everything is contained in a single thread and sorted by new . 
  this means whoever wants to help you does n't need to wade through tons of pointless threads with questions that should 've been in simple questions thread in the first place . 
  reddit is inherently shitty platform for feedback because whether your thread ( and question ) gets any attention depends mostly on upvotes and obviously people who upvote stuff ( which are not necessarily people who have a good answer for your question ) will upvote things they consider interesting . 
  and of course , most of the questions people have are inherently boring so they probably wo n't get any attention . 
  mods should probably do a better job telling people to keep simple questions ( and generally topics that do n't really require huge discussions to warrant a thread ) in simple questions thread because it will help those people with these issues as they are a lot more likely to get an answer and at the same time the subreddit wo n't be cluttered with unwarranted threads . 
  in anything but the most cpu light games yeah . 
  if you want to buy a gpu , i 'd probably look at it from the opposite angle . 
  ask yourself `` what gpu would i buy if cpu was n't a bottleneck ? '', 
  and buy whatever you want in your setup once you upgrade the cpu eventually . 
  z170 board is a good idea even if you do n't oc for the other features and faster ram,
