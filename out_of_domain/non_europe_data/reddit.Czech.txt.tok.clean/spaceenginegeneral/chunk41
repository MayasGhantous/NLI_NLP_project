  i added basically the same stuff i recommend to everyone . 
  * a lot better psu just for like $ 5 more, 
  * ditched hdd in favour of 500gb ssd and saved $ 10-20 . 
  if you know for sure you will use that space you can go with your original choice . 
  alternatively you can add a hdd once you start running out of space later on . 
  * saved $ 55 on gpu , better price/perf and cards are neck and neck anyway although if you want to go with nvidia and play games where it outperforms the 480 by a good margin you can go with that . 
  i would recommend getting a 144hz with the spare money , 1080p60hz and tn is a pretty bad combination nowadays and for around $ 60 more you can get a lot better experience . 
  monitor will also last you a long time compared to anything else in your system so it should be a priority to get a good one . 
  the difference between 2133mhz and 3000mhz in price is very little nowadays and the difference in performance is surprisingly big . 
  in [ 7 game average ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5agh8f/skylake_cpu_and_ram_gaming_impact_benchmarked/ ) the jump from 2133mhz to 3000mhz is equivalent to a ~ 20 % overclock of the cpu . 
  and in regards to hdds , obviously it 's subjective but i 'd always rather delete a game from ssd and redownload it later than playing anything from a hdd ever again ( and have been doing so for years now ), 
  i think paying extra for gsync to pair it with a midrange gpu is pretty bad deal . 
  obviously if you have a 1070/1080 and want adaptive sync you do n't have much of a choice but for midrange the amd + freesync is absolutely the better deal out of those 2 . 
  well since every game will probably load * something * you could argue that every game will benefit from an ssd . 
  it 's also not just about loading times but how often are you loading something . 
  in some games ( mainly open world stuff and especially mmos ) the benefits can be pretty huge since the hdd can bottleneck hard and cause pretty bad swapping during regular playing . 
  but yeah in the end it is subjective , someone will rather have long loading times but keep the games , myself i prefer short loading times and having to manage my space more often , which is why i advocate for ditching hdds in favour of large ssds ( and 256gb to 500gb is a pretty big jump ) for everyone unless they are absolutely sure they ca n't live with it . 
  you should probably switch it simply because you 'd want to eventually and a good psu will last you years ( quality psus will have up to 10 year warranty , what other component in your system do you plan to keep for 10 years ? ), 
  both of the psus you 're looking are good , the g2 got perfect rating from jonnyguru , they did n't test the 550w rmx , only the 1000w ( which performed great ) and the 750w ( performed well but had some build quality flaws ) . 
  toms hardware praises the low noise of the rm550x and it has a 10year warranty ( the g2 has 7year ) . 
  i would probably go with the evga since i trust their build quality more than the corsair but it 's a toss up and i do n't think you can go wrong with either . 
  it 's more expensive but cools better , not much else to say . 
  for overclocking you should go with the h7 not just for temps but also it will be a lot quieter during load . 
  unless you have some huge problems with airflow and your cpu/gpu are overheating because of it , it 's a non-issue . 
  from what i 've seen most of the time when people are adding extra fans it 's not even for the temps but rather to keep down noise ( of course you could say that the temps cause the noise but you get the idea ), 
  try either teflon pads on the bottom of the mouse or a different mouse pad . 
  for the buttons , in what games ? 
  some console ports do n't support anything past a middle button . 
  you can play with the logitech software to try and work around that . 
  atx boards will have more features for the same price compared to matx/itx . 
  fast ram and overclocking with skylake depends on the chipset so z170 matx/itx allow it but the small form factor boards with a good vrm to actually withstand long term overclocking are pretty expensive compared to atx boards . 
  i looked into the manual and the problem is n't necessarily lanes ( on x99 the 3.0 lanes are provided by the cpu with yours giving you 40 and the 6800k gives 28 ) . 
  the problem is that the lanes for the m. 2 slot on the board are provided by the chipset which only gives you 2.0, 
  this essentially means that if you want two m. 2 ssds running at full speed , you 'd need to ignore the m. 2 slot completely and instead use 2 m. 2 adapters that you linked and stick them into pci slots . 
  this leaves you with an 8x slot and 16x slot for sli . 
  i do n't know if that means the cards will both run at 8x but i would assume so , which in the end means that you 're completely wasting the 40 lane cpu ( 8 lanes on one card and 2x4 lanes on the m. 2 adapters ) and you might as well get a 6800k where everything will utilize the same amount of lanes and you 'll only waste 4 instead . 
  i 'm not sure how other boards deal with this but as i said , with this board you 'd need 2 m. 2 adapters and do n't need a 40 lane pcu to be able to use both m. 2 ssds at full speed, 
  edit : basically you 'd have to find a motherboard that divides the lanes for the pci slots as 16x 16x 4x 4x when all are full and i 'm skeptical any board does this since it 's more likely the lane division is intended for 3-4 gpus rather than sli and 2 m. 2 cards , which makes 6850k kind of pointless, 
  b150 chipset only supports 2133mhz, 
  yes , every motherboard will have at least 1 pci slot dedicated for a gpu, 
  if anyone wants tl ; dr, 
  from 2133mhz to 3000mhz you can expect gains similar to a ~ 20 % cpu overclock on average depending on games . 
  similar to overclocking , weaker cpus will relatively benefit more because they are more likely to become a bottleneck compared to higher end cpus, 
  uninstall the drivers for the old card , replace it with a new one , install drivers for the new card ? 
  you will see difference in cpu bound scenarios even without gpu upgrade . 
  however , when buying new components and especially when overclocking you should check what kind of psu do you have because that 's the part where prebuilts save money . 
  they only need psu `` good enough '' to last with the components inside until the warranty ends . 
  so basically , you have to replace everything , welcome to upgrading prebuilts , enjoy your stay . 
  i 'd actually argue for the exact opposite . 
  buying a 480 is extremely safe option for you and will work perfectly with your current display . 
  gpus are probably the fastest progressing components on the market , which also means that even if 490 is a complete flop and does n't effect 1070 prices at all ( which i find very unlikely ) , you 're still pretty much guaranteed that in like 2 years the 1070 performance will be available in a $ 200 card . 
  displays on the other hand progress pretty slowly ( and it takes even longer for the technology to become affordable for consumers ) and besides hdr , there is n't really anything special on the horizon ( affordable oled monitors that work for desktops are far away ) . 
  not only there wo n't be big shake ups but the prices probably wo n't get much better either . 
  finally , even if you get a 1440p display , the 480 might not be as good for the resolution as 1070 but freesync is pretty much free and will do decent job to offset the lower framerates . 
  buying a 1070 will lock you into gsync and you 'll face a pretty tough decision ( especially with a 144hz monitor which you should definitely get ) whether paying a premium on top of the display is worth it . 
  and if you decide it is , you 'll be rewarded with being vendor locked the next time you 're looking for a new gpu ( though this might not be a huge issue if you 'll keep the card as long as you kept the 570 ) . 
  so again , i 'd go with the 480 and see how stuff develops and just upgrade once you feel it 's not sufficient ( and to be frank , if you 're still using 570 you 'll probably keep the 480 for a long time as well , people are obsessed with maxing out everything nowadays but if you do n't mind lowering details then even relatively weak cards will give you pretty great framerates in modern games and 480 is a big upgrade from what you currently have ) . 
  with 1070 you 're pretty much banking on amd completely failing to do decently anything related to gpu development for the upcoming years , which could happen but it 's not exactly a safe bet . 
  fury, 
  gsync is good for low framerates and big frame drops but for high framerates ( 100-120 + ) it have little effect since the problems it addresses ( tearing and stuttering ) become basically non-existent just from high fps . 
  basically the question is how often do you expect to play at ~ 60fps and/or suffer from fps being all over the place . 
  if the answer is often , you 'll be glad you have gsync , if the answer is no , it 's not worth it . 
   also gtx 1070 ca n't reach 144hz on 1440p, 
  on ultra , which nobody with a 144hz monitor uses unless the game is old enough that it does n't matter . 
  probably not for 2400mhz but 3000mhz is n't that much more expensive and the difference is pretty big in cpu bound scenarios ( [ equivalent to about 20 % cpu oc ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5agh8f/skylake_cpu_and_ram_gaming_impact_benchmarked/ ) , probably a bit more with a 6500 since it 's lower clocked ), 
  would make a good difference for 144hz gaming in games that utilize ht ( assuming you lower details to not get gpu bound ) . 
  for 60hz probably not worth it unless you 're planning to upgrade in upcoming years . 
  i think you 're overthinking this . 
  i would n't bother with extra case fans at all if you 're on a low budget , if you 're not overclocking there 's basically no way that you 'll have so bad airflow that you 'll have trouble with temps . 
  you should keep in mind that you wo n't reach prime95 temps in a real world usage . 
  you might try a different stress test instead and make sure you 're not overheating during normal load .

  there no reason to buy amd right now and everyone will probably come up with an i5 build . 
  this build gives you the most upgrade paths in the future but the downside is that it only has i3 compared to builds with an i5 ( which will other people post , it 's still a far better cpu than the amd one in op ) that do n't bother with a z170 board . 
  the weaker cpu will be slightly offset by the faster ram which i5 build without z170 board ca n't have . 
  * i3 should handle 60fps gaming adequately but an i5 would obviously last a bit longer . 
  an i5-6500 could be included which would add $ 90 to the overall cost . 
  reasoning behind the i3 is that it 's good enough for now and in the future it could be replaced by unlocked i5 or even an i7 . 
  builds that will save on a motherboard to fit an i5 will perform slightly better but wo n't have any good upgrade paths without replacing the motherboard as well . 
  they will also suffer from being limited to 2133mhz ram frequency . 
  * ditched hdd for a larger ssd . 
  money could be saved by opting for just 256gb ssd, 
  * more bang for buck gpu, 
  * way better psu for the same price, 
  * removed thermal paste since it 's not needed, 
  my point was that people with 144hz monitors are n't using ultra settings because generally you 're losing a lot of frames for very little in terms of graphical fidelity . 
  unfortunately people who are doing benchmarks are so obsessed with ultra setting that people do n't realize that if you drop few settings to medium you 'll get completely different results than what the benchmarks show .
