  there it comes down mostly to whether you prefer nvidia or amd ( and if neither , amd is the better choice if you plan on keeping it for long time as it will age better while the nvidia is better choice if you want slightly better performance immediately and expect to upgrade your gpu relatively soon ), 
  yes, 
  old gtx 730/40/50 / 50ti are the cheapest cards that can drive 4k 60hz . 
  seeing that it 's still used for gaming look at the 750ti, 
  edit : if you 're buying new a 460 is $ 90 and will destroy any of those cards, 
  if you plan on keeping the card so long i would go with the amd then . 
  if you look at 4 year old gpus and compare them today in modern titles , amd cards that were completely destroyed by nvidia cards at that time will often go toe to toe and sometimes even outperform them . 
  1 ) how important is your cpu heavily depends on the framerate you target . 
  an i3 will easily handle almost everything at 60fps , but for 144hz you really want at least an oc 'd i5 and ideally oc 'd i7 . 
  people who tell you there 's no point in getting an i7 probably only play at locked 60fps and if they get fps drops they will blame the game being unoptimized instead of their cpu anyway . 
  what also a lot of people completely ignore is that if you buy an i5 now , buying an i7 later on will never be as cost efficient as buying it straight up ( that is , based on last years an assuming zen does n't change much ) . 
  this is opposite with a gpu where if you buy a cheap one now , you 're getting vastly better deal by upgrading later ( since the performance difference will be bigger as gpu perf progresses very fast compared to cpu perf ), 
  2 ) i5-6500 is technically the best price/perf i5 on the market right ( at stock ) but unlike other components where you can expect this information to be enough ( like gpu ) , in the vacuum it 's meaningless as you have to look at the whole ram/cpu/chipset package rather than cpu individually . 
  for example most people do n't realize that an i5-6500 using a single memory stick will perform worse than an i3-6100 using 2 sticks running at dual channel, 
  3 ) technically yes but gpu is also a component that will lose value the fastest ( speaking about shooters and action games that is , it will be useless for the other games you mentioned ) . 
  a $ 100 saved on a gpu now will buy you a lot better gpu in 1-2 years .

  * changed to skylake , no reason to get haswell new ( but added cpu cooler since k chips do n't come with one ), 
  * 4gb 480 costs $ 80 less and the performance is pretty similar but feel free to go with nvidia if you do n't want to buy amd, 
  * way better psu, 
  you can save money by getting a 6600k ( or even a 6500 , you can overclock both with this board when it comes down to it ) instead of a 6700k , but if you think you 'd want an i7 eventually anyway , it 's way more cost efficient to buy it now ( and for higher framerates than 60 modern games definitely benefit from the ht ) . 
  the argument against i7 is that zen might bring the cost of cores so if you feel like you wo n't use the i7 in upcoming years ( though if you game at higher than 60fps , you will utilize it ) , it 's possible that upgrading from an i5 wo n't be cost inefficient as it was for the past several years . 
  all of this said , whatever you buy , there is no future-proofing any skylake build without a z170 board . 
  if you 're okay with not maxing out games i would imagine a 380x will do well even at 1440p 144hz in everything but the most demanding titles ( maybe not 144hz but definitely around ~ 100 + , enough to take advantage of the display edit : meaning you will still get ~ 100 at demanding titles and easily 144hz in less demanding ones ), 
  unfortunately for the past years when talking about gpus people only seem to talk about ultra ( and benchmarks are mostly only done at ultra as well which does n't help ) . 
  most games will allow you to scale down the requirements extremely well and if you have a 144hz monitor it 's usually well worth lowering details to get higher framerates in most games . 
  this means the opinions are extremely skewed and make look weaker/older cards worse than they actually are . 
  also the fact that lots of people still just have 60hz monitors does n't help because if they put a game on medium settings and double their fps they wo n't see the same benefit as 144hz users . 
  the m5 is the only one with good enough power delivery to handle increased load from overclocking so i 'd go with that one .

  * 500gb ssd instead of smaller hdd and ssd , same price and better quality, 
  * this could warrant a debate , but i went with an i3 , z170 board and 470 instead of a much weaker gpu and i5 without z170 board . 
  for 60fps the i3 is adequate ( and with 3000mhz ram it 's barely slower than the i5 with 2133mhz ram ) , however , you 'll have a lot more options what to do with the build in the future . 
  you can basically upgrade into an i5 or even i7 without doing anything else , without z170 board you ca n't improve your cpu performance in any way without buy a new board again . 
  the i3 should handle anything at 60 either way . 
  you do n't play gpu intensive games but the 470 will gives you a lot better performance/details at 60fps than the 1050 especially at modern games . 
  * seems like you 're overpaying for the case but i do n't have any recommendation in that regard, 
  * you might want to get a bit better psu . 
  this one will handle this system absolutely fine but if you buy a gold rated 550w quality unit now for more , it should last you like 7-10 years minimum and have enough overhead for any future upgrades . 
  with this one you 're saving money but might encounter being limited in future gpu/cpu purchases and losing money in the long run by having to buy a new psu in 4-5 years for a gpu upgrade . 
  the nvme ssd is kind of pointless . 
  the small ssd for os large hdd for storage does n't translate at all into m. 2, 
  you do n't need 850w psu but the price savings wo n't be big either way, 
  well around april zen will be out so we have no idea what kind of cpu/motherboard deals will be out there . 
  in theory if there were no cpus coming out and you have board that can overclock you 're better of just upgrading cpu rather than switching to a new motherboard completely . 
  there will also be rx 490 but we can only speculate how good will it be . 
  650ti will bottleneck in gpu demanding titles but depending on what you play , if you lower the details enough and/or play gpu light games the i7-6700k can still be well utilized, 
  i could only see it being an issue with terrible airflow but it 's not something you have to worry in a normal scenario . 
  next time you mention `` overkill '' remember it 's a magnet for people who have no idea what they 're talking about . 
  if you want to max out modern demanding games at 144hz , you wo n't be able to even with a 1080 at 1080p . 
  win10 having a shitfit because of oem license ( unless you have retail one ) , not much else . 
  that 's not even the worst thing . 
  how many people do you think know that an [ i5-6500 with a single memory stick will perform worse than an i-3 6100 running dual channel memory ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qhdgolg.png ) ? 
  the problem is that the biggest mistakes people make in their build also tend to be things that most people do n't know or worse , are ignorant about because they just repeat outdated information constantly, 
  source is https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/5agh8f/skylake_cpu_and_ram_gaming_impact_benchmarked/, 
  asrock and msi support overclocking even with their official bioses , you only need a custom bios for gigabyte and asus unless something changed in last few months . 
  you can up the vram voltage up to 1.4 v. 
  poor soul , being downvoted to oblivion for a good advice, 
  and until you upgrade ( which could be years because games wo n't demand 16gb ram for some time ) your [ i5 will run slower than an i3 with 2 sticks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qhdgolg.png ) . 
  great plan , crippling your cpu so you have a spare ram slot in the future . 
  it 's more like 0 % if you ignore base clocks in favor of actual ipc, 
  i have had pc sitting on a table behind monitor running 24/7 for the past maybe 7-9 years without any case and never had a problem with it . 
  i do n't really see any argument against it if you 're not moving it often/at all . 
  people might say it accumulates dust a bit faster but it 's also obviously easier to access for cleaning . 
  assuming you 're in us you can get a 4gb 480 for around that price, 
  gpu is probably the least bang for buck component since the technology progresses by far the fastest from any other components . 
  that said if you think 256gb ssd is enough for you , 512gb wo n't really offer you anything more than a bit more convenience in regards how much stuff can you keep on your pc so it 's not really the `` performance '' choice . 
  the motherboard you listed is a terrible deal , you can get a great z170 board for the same price and wo n't end up with neutered chipset . 
  people have different requirements for space , i 've been using 128gb ssd as the only storage for many years until like a year ago when i upgraded to 256gb and gave away the 128gb one to a family member since i did n't feel i needed the extra storage anyway . 
  it 's not really problem if you delete stuff you do n't use since you can redownload it later anyway ( most people have all their games readily available on steam or any other online distribution service anyway ) and my internet speed is relatively terrible . 
  sure , you have people who ca n't live without hoarding everything on extra hdds but that 's far from necessary . 
  edit : i 'd decide based on how you like to play games , if you do n't care about lowering details i 'd probably get the 1060 simple because it 's better perf / $ than the 1070 and at least you wo n't have to care about disk space in some time . 
  if you want graphical fidelity the 1070 will obviously be better,
