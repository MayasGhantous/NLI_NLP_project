  i like how you automatically pointed towards trahearne , well played , sir ( or lady ?! ) . 
  well played . 
  but seriously - i would kill broham . 
  this is actually pretty decent update , i like it . 
  i 'm still more pumped for ** trading 2.0 ** and i hope it 's going to be reworked trading post . 
  we all have our opinions , so does fernando . 
  if he really thinks so , good for him , but i disagree . 
  btw , expect another article about lewis saying that fernando is the best . 
  just like the old times . 
  900 gems *, 
  they 've actually stood up to the hype in this case . 
   i 'm looking forward to trying out new tp , the old one was awful . 
  this is real qol improvement . 
  great interview , both mercedes guys should be happy he was there to cool down that general atmosphere a bit . 
  i like when press conferences go this `` chilled '' way . 
  exactly , some act like red bull has lost absolutely everything , but they are still very comfortably the second best team in current starting row ( though it 's fair to say they are high in points mostly because of daniel :-p ) . 
  is it just me or nico looks very ... anxious i would say ? 
  the way he talks is still pretty normal , but that body language ... he seems to be really crushed with that `` witch hunt '' thing that happened after spa . 
  politics aside : bernie knows how to piss off many fans & people in general . 
  he 's always been pretty damn good at it . 
  it 's not like he started changing his helmets during his strongest point of career , right ... 
  ot : btw , what 's up with all these not so successful trolls using alfa romeo flair ? 
  or is that just one person hiding behind more usernames ? 
  not the best design ever , he 's had better ones imo . 
  feels a bit ... trippy ... those rb/infiniti logos do n't fit in . 
  i never really liked montoya back in his f1 days , but this is great interview . 
  you can feel how relaxed he is and that he has no issues about the past . 
  he 's just there to enjoy some good racing and talk about sport he loves . 
  i like that attitude . 
  ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ say ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ he 's ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ exact ^ ^ ^ opposite ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ villeneuve, 
  maybe he 's sanctifying that part of track . 
  something like `` may there be no crashes , just hard , yet peaceful racing . '', 
  all the spanish media argument does n't really work , german media love vettel , british media love hamilton , etc. 
  not being friend with your native media would make zero sense . 
  ca n't argue about the rest though . 
  i see your point , [ but ... ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nkf8s1kufhu/t5ylknc4-4i/aaaaaaaaax8/dvazm660_uq/s1600/img_4373.jpg ), 
  people here joke about ( serious ) stuff all the time , what 's wrong about interviewer joking the same way we do ? 
  amount of butthurt comments from you is [ too damn high ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131112164356/lookout/images/9/94/too-damn-high.jpg ) . 
  nah , do n't take his comments on anything too seriously , because he does n't mean them seriously . 
  wow , red bull is everything . 
  red bull nwo incoming . 
  does n't matter how , in the end , he lost to him anyways . 
  it 's not hard to dislike jv , and this is just one of many reasons to do so . 
  he 's such a shame of his name . 
  nah , i do n't think this means anything , i smiled at rosberg 's mistake too . 
  but it was funny to see how fast he changed his facial expression into `` serious boss face '' once he realised that he 's on tv . 
  i do n't enjoy entire concept of it , it 's chaotic and 99 % of interviews go in this way :, 
   `` good race huh ? '', 
  - `` first of all i think fans are amazing , i love you all , you are awesome and you deserve our deep love ... and yeah , race was good , we have strong team . '', 
  it 's rather boring compared to these old interviews where actual press asked even somewhat serious question about race itself . 
  i feel like interviewers are a bit afraid to push on drivers with questions . 
  maybe because they have less time , or they just do n't want to cause even bigger shitstorm coming from fans during live event . 
  even drivers started playing that game of `` must please fans at first place '' . 
  good interviews pretty much moved to press confferences before actual race weekend happens . 
  tl ; dr : i do n't like it . 
  wow , driver to driver radio ... this would make me enjoy vettel vs. alonso battles much more . 
  [ you know what they say ... you can fake smile , but your eyes will tell the truth . 
  i do n't like him either , but i think he 's right this time . 
  canamasas is consistently very dangerous and reckless . 
  pretty much any [ youtube video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sergio+canamasas ) with him is about it . 
  and [ this is from this years monza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iargidtgm-y ) , where he got black flagged . 
  holy shit , somehow i 've missed that ... that 's crazy , even beyond maldonado level ... or online racing level . 
  asshole , even though he has calmed down , delibaretly running into somebody this way is absolutely stupid . 
  oh my goodness , i would be instantly his and their fan ... 
  i know my inner nerd , he would n't ressist becoming biggest williams fanboy after that . 
  well they are n't super rich , but do they really get `` just an average paycheck '' ? 
  that would surprise me tbh . 
  the way alonso looked at mark always makes me laugh . 
  does n't get old . 
  `` yeah , mark , tell us . '', 
  just perfect . 
  because being the fastest in quali means that you 're a bad pilot ... sure . 
  what 's your point ? 
  because it 's horner 's team ? 
  red bull is not the only way to get into f1 . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  people should realise that even 5 minutes long video takes alot of time to make , especially when you focus on lots of editing & almost professional quality of production itself , which is exactly what matt does . 
  show some appreciation to the man , he 's been there since pre-beta and he did alot to promote the game to the general gaming community ( especially considering how crappy was game 's official marketing post-launch ) . 
  same applies to other gw2 youtubers , including woodenpotatoes , bogotter , aurora peachy etc. 
  heck even dontain should deserve some kind of respect for content he did back in the days , though i dislike him , i have to admit it . 
  would be nice , if other thought this way too . 
  ** these people do n't make tons of money out of their gaming content , they do what they do because they are passionate about it , so please , appreciate that . 
  well ... that 's a bit longer break than i expected . 
  guess we can expect halloween to take whole october ? 
  [ vettel with rosberg ] ( http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130407041248/radiocreatures/images/5/5f/i_know_that_feel_bro.jpg ), 
  and fanboys will always come up with stupid arguments whenever somebody says anything different than `` lh is the best driver ever . '', 
  vettel has really bad season ( for the first time in his career ) and he 's being wiped out by his team mate , that 's true . 
  yet hamilton has had bad season in 2011 , when jenson was second and lewis fifth in the driver 's standings . 
  and not because of technical issues . 
  i do n't know if you watch f1 since 2012 or whatever , but it 's not like hamilton always was , is and always will be perfect driver . 
  that 's just not true . 
  he may be the fastest in terms of race pace , but that 's not everything in f1 and i think you know it . 
  worst f1 game corner ever , especially if you try to play just with keyboard , it 's so hard to manage pace in that sector . 
  i usually crash in monaco when i do n't use steering wheel or gamepad . 
  i 'm genuinely interested if sebastian is able to beat daniel on this track , or even better - if he 's able to beat mercedes guys . 
  this is `` his '' track , but you know ... this is n't his strongest year . 
  i hope . 
  obviously fia needs to increase the boost then !, 
  exactly , it already did lol . 
  only drivers who have actually said that it is/was their dream are/were drivers somehow already connected to ferrari ... so ...
