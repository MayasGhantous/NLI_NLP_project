  more on that [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/6nfwf0/what_was_vettel_pissed_about_at_the_end_of_his/ ) . 
  [ which reminds me of certain earlier thread . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/6nc1zt/ricciardo_says_red_bull_can_fight_ferrari_at/?utm_content=full_comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ), 
  but seriously , they should have better race pace . 
  and max is pretty close to front , good start and he might be there for a podium . 
  and hungary should suit them even more so since it 's more aero dependent . 
  lol chill . 
  when something favors ferrari it 's ferrari bias , now something favored mercedes and people go crazy the other way around . 
  this is n't / r/conspiracy . 
  enjoy the gp and best wishes to both of you . 
  holy shit , that 's a strong statement . 
  wow . 
  i 'll just act like that `` thing '' in the end did n't happen lol ... yet another proof that they got over everything from the past . 
  now if only some fans would be able to do the same . 
  this is definition of meme art . 
  oh come on . 
  i do n't care who people cheer for , may it be hamilton or vettel , or freaking stroll . 
  can we please stop with these stupid `` but / r/formula1 says '' generalisations ? 
  every other thread has it in one way or another . 
  it 's waaaaaaay past the point when it was at least a bit funny . 
  ** there are freaking 224 609 people subbed . 
  even if it was vocal majority it still does n't represent opinion of entire sub . 
  absolutely agree . 
  there should n't be `` but they are fighting for championship '' bias . 
  rules are rules and they should be mandated . 
  if anything , ignoring those rules for the sake of show is actually just giving them unfair advantage over rest of the field , which is just dumb . 
  i believe part of their decision making today was based on them letting vettel go in baku without a black flag . 
  fuck yeah i loved it . 
  surely once hype wore off i realised that it has certain flaws and it was too similar to what we have seen before . 
  would i change certain aspects of it ? 
  absolutely . 
  but i 'd be a damn liar if i would say that it 's a bad movie and that j.j. hurt the saga . 
  he did n't , tfa is amazing and i am coming back to it just like with any other star wars movie . 
  i actually liked it more than rogue one and i definitely did like rogue one a lot . 
  to me tfa is very enjoyable as a whole package , while rogue one only picks up pace in the second half of the movie . 
  vader scene was epic and all , but it does n't make the entire movie . 
  already voted but i just realised ... might be useful for next gp predictions contest , / u/kelly _ johnson - how does it work when there 's vsc being used instead of regular sc ? 
  does it still count as sc in predictions ? 
  thanks . 
  okay , good to know . 
  cheers . 
  thanks for doing these every racing weekend . 
  i feel like i read this already before austria . 
  or something along very similar lines . 
  i also think it was on more reputable website , so i guess there might actually be something true about it and it 's not just tabloid media making up shit . 
  it would n't surprise me to be honest . 
  but i may be wrong , i 'm not 100 % sure . 
  gave out so many top ratings today , wow . 
  hamilton , bottas , ricciardo , verstappen , raikkonen , hulkenberg , mercedes and red bull . 
  i 'm always amazed how calm and collected he is after such disasters when talking to press , especially considering his temper when he 's in the car . 
  to be fair ... 
  this was a disaster . 
  going from 20 points in the lead to single point difference is a disaster . 
  i appreciate bottas in this regard . 
  even when kimi took him out in sochi he was just like `` the fuck did he do '' in his standard voice tone . 
  i 'd never think that i 'd wish for somebody to eat their hair . 
  but here we go ... 
  ca n't forget about existence if you did n't know about it in first place . 
  spa . 
  spa . 
  vettel . 
  not really into favorite teams , but ferrari is probably closest to my heart because schumi is very related to them and seb tries to emulate him . 
  please ... dear sir . 
  just chill the fuck out already . 
  if ferrari is n't able to stay with mercedes pace i really hope at least bottas keeps up with hamilton to certain extent . 
  i want it to go down the wire till the final race . 
  got ta love final race drama buildup . 
  honestly ... can confirm . 
  tifosi gave me alot of shit on the web back then . 
  one of the reasons why i actually ended up here is that i was seriously tired of their shit on our local forums . 
  complaining a lot ? 
  i only recall one situation with max . 
  i mean ... he was in the wrong here , but that 's really low amount of whining for his standard . 
  besides that i think he just reported that tyres feel like shit , which is actually very needed report . 
  do we really need these shitposts everytime kimi is on a podium ? 
  it 's the same thing every damn time : `` lol he 's not smiling such personality classic kimi '', 
  even then ... relatively speaking he simply is weaker there . 
  i wonder if red bull would even bother taking him back after that ban . 
  i hate them . 
  first time i noticed he has a union jack on the end of that fin lol . 
  amazing shot . 
  it 's an event . 
  but i would . 
  what do you want to hear really ? 
  it 's monday trash talk thread that is permanently there on every day . 
  hamilton led first , then they switched and vettel led for a while ... now hamilton has been leading for a while again ... ferrari wcc and wdc coming next year guys !, 
  or maybe the one after it . 
  although not as bad as in 2014 , he was n't really good last year either . 
  he tried too hard to make up for performance gap to mercedes by overly optimistic dives and overdrove the car in qualies more often than not . 
  i had lg g2 for 3 + years now . 
  it still rocks well ... although admittedly i really needed to put there a custom rom , and it still gets a bit slow ... but after such a long time of hardcore usage i do n't blame it . 
  eyeing new phone this summer . 
  may as well try ios this time around . 
  already have it on ipad and i kinda like it . 
  he makes last moment direction change in the braking zone . 
  i fail to react in time and we 're both out of the race . 
  i go full nascar on him once we 're out of cars and get a race ban for inappropriate behavior . 
  hamilton makes a comment about setting a bad example for children . 
  / r/formula1 argues all week long who was at fault and wtf1 is making boxer memes about me for the rest of my racing career . 
  not quite .
