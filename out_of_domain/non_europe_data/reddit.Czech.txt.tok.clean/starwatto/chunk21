  i thought it was some kind of weird button photoshop . 
   he combines the consistency and strategy of prost and the raw speed and aggression of senna . 
  this is the best way to describe why schumacher was so great to people who did n't see him in his era . 
  thanks for that , going to save it for later . 
  well , he did n't do so bad in lotus ... until lopez and his fellas started having financial issues . 
  but yeah , it 's pr no matter who says it . 
  that 's some seriously good correction skill , great drive considering the unstability of that car . 
  he slightly moves with wheel even on straights , when not changing direction or anything ... crazy stuff . 
  lauda all the way , piquet was an cheating asshole , while lauda was just somewhat dirty , yet pretty damn good driver . 
  he 's a great guy , that 's for sure . 
  i like his attitude . 
  well , i do n't have many friends who like motorsport at all . 
  let me count ... 2 former classmates from high school , 1 mate from university , my dad , 1 friend of mine ( she does n't watch regularly though ) ... and that 's it . 
  most of my friends ( or people around me in general ) find motorsport boring . 
  but as long as they do n't bitch about it being stupid , i have no problem . 
  their opinions vary from `` cars in circles blah blah , not really a sport , blah blah , everybody can do that , blah blah . '', 
  to `` sometimes i check out highlights on youtube or read the news , but that 's it . 
  '' , i obviously prefer the second group , it 's better than nothing . 
  also there is one specific thing , when i mention f1 is my favorite motorsport league - some come up with `` well it 's definitely better than nascar , but still not my cup of tea . '', 
  not as good as adding new dungeons , but still good . 
  absolutely stunning . 
  he was a champion in lower series though . 
  does anybody have it in bigger resolution ( fullhd ) , please , please , please ? 
  :-p tried to search for it via tineye , but did n't find anything . 
  would 've been amazing wallpaper . 
  he still has a chance , grosjean was dumped too , but then he rejoined f1 in lotus , which could 've been considered as one of the top teams at the time . 
  i think i spot an asshole . 
  he posted it on twitter , in this exact wording . 
  no media misleading this time . 
  i would so love this one . 
  when i found this track for the first time in some simracing game , i thought `` oh my god , this is almost like an australian spa or something . '', 
  amazing track , very challenging and fast one .

  #openallorriot 2015, 
  heh , i 've never heard this radio , was that even in live broadcast ? 
  yep , there is no way [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfce-9brfe ) was vettel 's fault . 
  turkey was , but not this . 
  he just drove around him , when karthikeyan hit him . 
  it does n't change your bitching and moaning either , pal . 
  yeah , he 's well known for that . 
  he lost his license repeatedly even in other series . 
  wait , what ... do you do anything somewhat significant for the community ? 
  or how did they notice you ? 
  just being curious there . 
  mark looks annoyed . 
  so you can say that ho-pin was hopin ' for a drive . 
  well , it 's unlikely , but could n't it be that vettel put in a word about him inside the team ? 
  because of the badass cigar , of course . 
  nah man ... i do n't even have kids and i still want it . 
  oh come on . 
  seriously ... i 'm huge vettel fan , but this constant repeating of `` why was he so slow and why we should be okay about it '' is annoying . 
  it does n't really help anyhow , it just makes us ( his fans ) look like total losers who have to search for excuses all the time . 
  he was slower than daniel , had a bad season , end of story . 
  i still believe `` he 'll be back '' , but he simply lost it this year . 
  i suggest to his other fans to get over it , unless they want to look like some ( even more desperate ) kimi fans . 
  god , that was kinda sour ... did n't realize it until i read it after myself . 
  nicole likes the beard . 
  well ... we all do . 
  nice to see their relationship got so good after such history . 
  please , eddie , say sometime that some * cough * / u/starwatto * cough * guy will be a billionaire . 
  a bit ot , but okay ... chin strap looks cool too . 
  ayrton01cz is the man , i love his editing . 
  i used to wear chin strap and i felt cool with it . 
  [ :( ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wi2vc2csynw/t0xgv_gzw8i/aaaaaaaaljw/f4fl4ypqibq/s1600/okay_guy.jpg ), 
  most people wanted/expected to see serious battle between kimi and fernando , yet kimi got absolutely wrecked . 
  high expectations are common point . 
  ehm ... what ? 
  it 's so easy to forget kovalainens win . 
  amazing job , thanks !, 
  great insight that every f1 fan should watch , no matter if they like fernando or not . 
  brands hatch . 
  people usually say it 's a boring one , but i just like it ... fun and fast middle sector . 
  senna , despite being a legend and symbol of pure racing , was also very dirty driver , but it 's been a long time , so people tend to forget . 
  nothing more into it imho . 
  tough one , i really like both ... but romain has already had a shot with winning-capable car , so i 'd give it to hulk . 
  oh f * ck me , somebody already posted this type of thread . 
  sorry for that spam !, 
  not gon na delete it though . 
  jacques villeneuve is an insult to f1 . 
  [ it 's christmas time , after all . 
  bianchi did n't have a gopro either . 
  `` screw the money man , just give me a hug a sign this for me . '', 
  as far as `` some source on internet says '' goes , they really do , even vettel did n't have a big `` static '' paycheck until 2014 , before he was way lower - but with all these huge bonuses he definitely got . 
  hipster sylvari . 
  i might feel cool after finishing ac with level 12 toon , but game does n't really care and rewards me with same reward as anybody else , who goes through with classic speedrun setup in uncomparably shorter time . 
  that 's pretty much why i do n't care about these special types of runs if i do n't get anything in exchange for my extra effort . 
  what if ... what if / u/oh84s is kimi 's incognito account and he just tests who 's his real fan and going to defend him , and who not . 
  [ onboard camera pov ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7q-1kidwgc ) in case you 're interested . 
  part of the camouflage . 
  horner to lotus ? 
  yep , probably classic christmas issue - everybody wants to play and activate their credit/games , so servers could n't handle it and crashed . 
  give it a time . 
  i think kimi is slightly better , mostly because he 's making less mistakes - and when he does make them , they are usually not fatal . 
  you ca n't really say the same about felipe ( whose mistakes usually mean his race is over ) , who might be , on the other hand - better in general pace/speed , but not in close battles and wheel-to-wheel racing . 
  ftfy : * even pretty damn good ( if not best ) pairings * can lose championships though ... as i 'm sure the gentlemen at mclaren would like to forget . 
  well , alonso has grown into his peak in 2010 + , which was after 9 full seasons if i count right . 
  and i can easily remember people constantly bitching about him before his ferrari era . 
  my point being ... why should n't vettel have same chance to expand his potential ?
