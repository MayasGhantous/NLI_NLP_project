  i do n't think he 's at his peak yet , new team is something he needed to expand it further ... and only time will tell if he succeeds . 
  lewis + fernando is a strong pairing in theory , but not so much in real application ... history is an ultimate proof . 
  anyways ... i really ca n't decide between lewis + jenson | | daniel + sebastian pairing . 
  i think these two pairings are almost equal . 
  ot : i would 've been very interested in daniel + fernando pairing . 
  oh , so i 'm not the only one . 
  already submited a bug report . 
  i can get into dr with other characters , but ca n't log into those who already are in . 
  probably some megaserver instance issue then . 
  eu too . 
  on my d802 i went from cloudyg3 to cm12 without any baseband flashing , i just had to update twrp , but your recovery will tell you if you need to . 
  oh , in that case - ok , i can agree with that . 
  i really missed your point . 
  it 's very sad , underwater content was a strong marketing point back in pre-beta days , and it seemed like a great idea ... which they kind of failed to execute right . 
  nice . 
   i 'm just wondering how many fans are going to approach seb during fan sessions in red bull gear , heh . 
  gon na be fun , especially at monza . 
  ok , most presents here were nice , but this ... this ... now i 'm really jelly , that 's all i can say . 
  enjoy it !, 
  you know something is really wrong with the game when this is top post on game 's fanbase subreddit ... and during christmas . 
  i agree with both op and / u/lon-ami 's posts . 
  this game is great , but it could do much better if it sorted out some stuff . 
  do n't act like there is no grind in current gw2 . 
  `` it 's a shitbox , just like my diapers ! '', 
  sadly enough , ferrari has been pretty good at destroying this experience lately . 
  heh , thanks for reminding me that i actually like pastor ... when jv comes into comparison ... 
  i see this type of picture every winter ... and i am never going to get tired of it . 
  still awesome . 
  are there any winter on-snow races ? 
  i 'm in doubt how much is his opinion based on `` it 's no secret he brings a lot of funding to the team . '', 
  and how much on pastor 's real attitude - remember when he was accusing williams of sabotaging his car ? 
  so ... woodenpotatoes eats himself ? 
  that 's kinda sick , i 'll just stick with that photo of scarlet johansson . 
  sammpo 's at his best again !, 
  got ta love his edits . 
  to the last sentence ... i think he 's actually pretty fast driver , damn he was able to hold behind fernando alonso in spain with clean driving . 
  his problem is lack of perspective and situational awareness . 
  it did iirc , there have been reports during summer that ncsoft plans to release an expansion in 2015 , it 's just that nobody actually said it . 
  [ why not both ? 
  i see your point . 
  well , there is no info straight from arenanet , but stock report from ncsoft said that they plan to release an expansion in 2015 . 
  it 's the best thing we have right now . 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.kdbdw.com/bbs/download/182450.pdf?attachmentid=182450 ) what sammpo used in his video, 
  i used to play with 2gb and same cpu as you for some time , if you avoid open world content with zergs , it 's acceptable . 
  cities are pain though , wvw unacceptable , dungeons/fractals are ok . cpu is bottleneck too , gpu should be okay . 
  red bull has terribly failed in their advertising campaign if you forgot to include that you do n't drink any energy drink . 
  pdvsa consistently contributes for his team . 
  guild wars 3, 
  was jenson told not to pass him though ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ multi21, 
  [ yeah ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/damon_hill#music_career ), 
  pure conspiracy , but also - bernie 's issues in germany were still kinda hot around that time . 
  i know , i 'm just asking if it 's fair to say he was the `` bad '' guy at the moment or not . 
  fernando has aged well since then . 
  that could also mean that they work on an expansion for more than a year ... i 'm not hyping myself up since it 's rather pointless , but i would be very happy to get an expansion announcement at the end of final ls2 episode . 
  just imagine ... you complete the final mission and what you get as a reward ( except some greens ofc ) ? 
  kickass trailer with `` preorder now for 2000 gems '' at the end . 
  one can dream ... 
  i 'm genuinely interested if his car in 2015 fits him more - it should . 
  i 'm not expecting him to win some races , just be closer to actual competition the car is capable of . 
  i mean ... i am his fan , i like him and i still do enjoy his wheel-to-wheel action , but this approach in the matter of `` it 's mostly the car , not me . '', 
  same applies to sebastian , though it 's fair to say in his case most of that crap was coming from his fans and not straight from his mouth . 
  unless kimi brings it on next year , i 'm going to be very disappointed . 
  in my perspective , kimi seems like he does n't give a damn anymore , he 's just there to earn some good bucks for retirement , and that 's kind of a let down for me . 
  especially after his return into f1 , which made me think `` man , that was one hell of a comeback . '', 
  if he really thinks that way , it 's shitting on fans , and that 's never cool , not even for iceman . 
  yeah , that 's more likely . 
  even i enjoyed when somebody was ahead of him that year . 
  `` deal with it '' asura killed me . 
  thanks man , now i ca n't get it out of my head ... 
  zanardi indeed knows alot about not giving up , he 's a great man . 
  yeah , even today , junior series are kinda alot supported by alcohol companies , it 's ironic ... 
  agreed with op . 
  i do n't really understand why they removed this daily and i hate arenanet continues to ignore dungeons . 
  a bit ot , but it also would 've been nice if they added in some kind of `` daily full dungeon clear reward '' . 
  like if you do all paths , you get bonus tokens or something ... a bit of incentive to clear all paths instead of doing just the fastest ones . 
  just ignore them , that 's the best thing you can do really . 
  if you start communicating with them , or even raging at their behavior , you just give them what they seek - attention . 
  acting cool like shit happens is the best way to deal with these poor beings . 
  not just in gw2 , or on the internet - even in real life ... 
  2-3 hours in a fractal ? 
  you mean ... one full fotm run ? 
  in 2-3 hours ? 
  that 's way too much even if you 're new , our first fotm runs after they 've been introduced ( = no guides , nobody knew optimal ways ) took 1-1 ,5 hour tops . 
  yes , that would 've been nice . 
  but as it stands right now , just return of classic dungeon daily is good enough for me . 
  mercedes : hamilton ** rosberg **, 
  williams : ** bottas ** massa, 
  mclaren : alonso ** button **, 
  force india : ** hulkenberg ** perez, 
  toro rosso : ** verstappen ** sainz ( i do n't really care to be honest , but i would like to see max prove all that `` he 's too young '' is bullshit ), 
  lotus : ** grosjean ** maldonado, 
  drs before it was cool . 
  that 's how i imagine some `` friendly matches '' in motorsport !, 
  great stuff , would love to see more of these all stars races ( roc please , adapt this format ) . 
  nah , he 's camping in journo 's houses . 
  can you touch it ? 
  is it just me or trulli is a bit underrated driver ? 
  i feel like he could get a bit more recognition in the sport , like barrichello gets for example - but nobody would care about him if it was n't for his # 2 ferrari era , meanwhile many older fans know what 's up when `` trulli train '' is mentioned , and he was n't even that much behind fernando most of the time when they were together . 
  maybe not a wdc material , but definitely above the average .
