  simple as that . 
  i can easily see some team getting a woman as main diver just for the sake of huge pr , but there has to be one good enough in the first place . 
  f1 is sausagefest , but not because they do n't accept women . 
  what is similar request ? 
  just asking , because that could also mean you just ran into them demanding free eternity ... 
  well , in guild rush you usually spam skill for detecting traps , maybe we 'll use the same mechanic on a ship to detect dragon ... or they are simply going to nuke entire maguuma . 
  to be fair , vettel is not any better when it comes to this stuff . 
  it 's on the table . \u2122, 
  / slowclap, 
  next step : get a badass tattoo, 
  i 've bought stack of 25 once ... worst investment ever . 
  even buying modern warfare 2 paid off better . 
  since then ( after few days of terrible rage towards the game and myself ) , bl keys just from gold transfer/personal story . 
  sorry mate , but this is pretty pointless circlejerk thread . 
  both games are amazing in their own ways , and since you did n't bring in any real argument ... good for you , kthxbai . 
  i actually pre-orderd that game . 
  it was good , but iwnet and it 's unstability and matchmaking kind of ruined most of my experience since i bought it mostly for multiplayer . 
  : - / gave up on cod after that . 
  he would be like : `` if i wanted blue car , i would 've just remained at red bull - they 're even faster for christ 's sake ! '', 
  check [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/comments/16y26k/so_you_finally_hit_80_before_you_post_read_here/ ) . 
  must, 
  not, 
  cry, 
  i just want new weapon skills which have actual use in the game , no matter if they bring them in with brand new weapons , or just with new class combos . 
  just new skills which are n't entirely pointless , anet pls . 
  staff for warriors would give us kungfumaster-archetype, 
  most of time he 's that witty guy with somewhat smart commentary , but in this case ... eh ... i think his comment was rather stupid , and he 's probably going to change his mind in time ... unless he wants to stay away from motorsport for the rest of his life ( after f1 ) , because this is future ( dealwithit.jpg ) . 
  the thing about him is that some people rate him probably way too high , yet he does n't get top-driver recognition in general audience , which he could deserve imo . 
  as others have already said - problem is not in the delivery , probably the only thing expansion can do better in theory , is marketing and hyping up masses , but that 's it . 
  in reality though , we all know that episodic delivery has it 's cons too , most of which are somehow connected to amount of the actual content we can play . 
  there are still lots of players , newcomers , veterans , all sorts of people . 
  we 're currently finishing season and prepairing for some big news , so yeah ... game is pretty alive and doing good . 
  is it just me or did the beginning sound like requiem for a dream ? 
  anyways ... great job . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en_u7n9t8es ) - pretty cold blooded , i like brundle , but this was not nice . 
  insults ? 
  lol . 
  i think it 's daniel  seb  mark . 
  so ... no . 
  it 's really hard to say since most people just provide their personal top 5 ... [ this ] ( https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/who-was-the-greatest-f1-driver/ ) is probably the most objective rating we have . 
  for me , personally ( those i 've seen ) : senna , prost , h\u00e4kkinen , schumacher , alonso, 
  i hope so , there is still chance he 'll be the only one with machinery good enough to fight lewis . 
  nah , they already gave them to mclaren . 
  would 've been amazing if they brought modified version back as raid fractal . 
  so amazing ... ahh . 
  all right , enough internet for today ... 
  that 's stupid reason to downvote then . 
  this one is great too !, 
  nobody said this is better . 
  we 're talking about lewis , not villeneuve . 
  i tried to resist this hype , i really tried ... no more , all aboard !, 
  if it was n't for your comment , i would 've thought there really was colin . 
  ( o_o ) ', 
  on serious note : oh god , i totally forgot about capes . 
  that would 've been great addition too !, 
  vanilla gw2 was based on one dragon , so why expansion ca n't be ? 
  nothing personal , but ... 
  i hate you . 
  i 'll try to sort out my thoughts the best way i can ... that was fucking intense . 
  i love that gs , it 's literally carrot on steroids ... already bought it , no regrets . 
  i am mordrem warrior nao . 
  spear precursor speculations on tp incoming ? 
  also - next visualwood podcast , please make part about gw2 just like you did last time . 
  this has to be discussed . 
  stillhyped, 
  did they actually kill off entire destiny 's edge ( except rytlock ofc ) + trehearne ? 
  this community is actually pretty awesome , nobody is wondering about it 's shittines except you and your bitter sack of sadness . 
  rip sylvari zerg commanders . 
  i love them . 
  they are fun and somewhat challenging to fight + they look awesome ( tbh risen were just generic zombie-ish creatures , nothing extra special ) . 
  ^ ^ it ^ ^ really ^ ^ sucks ^ ^ we ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ face ^ ^ them ^ ^ in ^ ^ a ^ ^ dungeon . 
  this is a game yo , dragon was designed to have fun fight mechanics . 
  would you have fun if he just stepped on you , instakilled you and end of story ? 
  i 'm sorry , but if you look for realism in a fantasy game with dragons , magic , and all this other stuff ... well ... yeah . 
  and fair point , they did n't tell us about e. maybe next time , i do n't really care tbh . 
  do n't ask me , i just used google . 
  tr does n't really care about results though , they are not meant to be on the top . 
  well , that 's not the point . 
  red bull just few days ago did a giveaway for free on our college - `` so you guys can study all night '' they said . 
  5 years ago . 
  uf , how time has passed ... 
  like mclaren does any better . 
  voted for lewis , though i would love to be surprised and proved otherwise . 
  he gets lot of shit for pretty much everything , i think he 's used to that . 
  cheap and fun way to get r&d done . 
  not the best , but definitely most intense one ... 
  going full flat through eau rouge ... and crashing pretty horribly ... yeah ... 
  i woke up , half shocked and half amazed , got ta love those dreams . 
  nope , still not used to it . 
  i think this picture gets even better with time ... 
  as some people already stated elsewhere - it 's not about being a fan of charlie hebdo , or even enjyoing their creations , it 's about respecting their right to make such creations . 
  i can freely say they are over the edge a-holes , but they still have full right to continue in their work . 
  that 's the point - respecting and believing in freedom . 
  as / u/yaris-maris said - i do n't like it , but no matter what they write or draw , that does n't justify some fanatical idiots running into their offices with ak47 . 
   poke a dog too many times and its going to bite, 
  i do n't really want to go deep into politics on this sub , so just a short answer and then i 'll leave this thread behind : if you think this happened just because they were making fun of them ... well ... no . 
  [ source ] ( http://formula1.ferrari.com/news/esteban-gutierrez-im-keen-learn-quickly ), 
  seems like that video-editor did it on purpose , or did he really remain silent after winning a championship ? 
  ca n't remember . 
  you killed my ears , but i still love you .
