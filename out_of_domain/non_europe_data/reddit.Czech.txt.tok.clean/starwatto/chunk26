  like one direction for example !, 
  yellow colouring around the cockpit ? 
  hmmm ... 
  what about us poor guys who have him in flair . 
  i think i 'm missing a joke or something . 
  took me few moments to realize what the hell is going on . 
  so edgy i can cut myself while reading that . 
  damn , i 'd become die-hard fi fan just because of that . 
  wow , well ... from my experience , this subreddit is probably the best f1 online community i 've ran into . 
  it 's not perfect ( nothing is ) , but it 's definitely not bad - there are always going to be some tensions since it 's a sport and we all root for different teams and drivers , but that 's the part of it . 
  and trust me buddy , as vettel fan i got tons of shit on other sites , some casual jabbing at him there is nothing compared to what are some capable to release through their keyboards elsewhere . 
  is n't it obvious - hype train crashed into servers . 
  this . 
  i can still remember how i thought during launch days `` daaamn these mid-level story dungeons are harder than endgame stuff in wow ! '', 
  wiping on almost every trash encounter was no exception back in the days . 
  it 's very active even when there is a break between updates . 
  right now , when hype is over 9000 ? 
  you 'll see tons of people . 
  there are still people trying to pug it , but i gave up on puging it , it 's really better to spend more time on ts and coordinate stuff for 99.99 % success chance . 
  nah , they were joking - check his video . 
  oh wait , josh foreman made that ? 
  even devs are on the hype train ? 
  duh , this is going to be huge !, 
  so who plays drinking version of pax bingo ? 
  we need that on livestream too !, 
  ** too **, 
  ** much **, 
  ** hype **, 
  i just had the best nerdgasm ever . 
  ever . 
  you wish m8 , you wish ... 
  hey !, 
  i hope your skills are going to make me cry when facing new ai man . 
  i really do . 
  i want to cry during the gameplay . 
  and then jump around and scream in joy when i finnaly beat that thing you made me to face . 
  why do you act like other games are free ? 
   players will lack the mastery points and new abilities that give them extra power in pvp, 
  yeah , sure ... pve system is going to affect pvp system , which has been set to be equal no matter what your pve progression is since launch . 
  not sure if trolling or serious . 
  yeah , sure . 
  most of which make you spend much more money than any subscription or buy to play based game on the market . 
  nope , thanks . 
  well yeah , there is a chance that chronomancer is specialization of mesmer , just like rangers get druid spec . 
  also - do n't forget that mesmers already do work with time ( warps etc. ) . 
  i 'm very positive in general , i just hope that we 're going to get more pvp maps even for conquest mode , and that we 're going to get dungeons - they mentioned challenging group content , but that can also be wurm-ish type of content - which is good too , but , you know ... it 's not exactly a disappointment , i just hope for variety between content types ... 
  btw , i would n't really be that sad about getting just one entire profession , because specialization can bring some interesting dynamic into already known professions , and if it delivers as much as i think it could - we 'll get 8 somewhat new profession experiences + one entirely new profession , which probably can also get a specialization , so it 's 9 + 1 , and that 's pretty damn good in my books . 
  and all that amazing ai work would be vain . 
  well it opens up space for new specs as time goes , so i 'm pretty cool with it even if each profession gets only one now . 
  btw , warriors + mesmer meta has been dead for quite a long time . 
   game has been balanced since launch . 
  ** strong imo warning : ** honestly , i enjoy every race/gender combo except norns . 
  i made norn just so that i can get story achievements and cultural stuff ... and that 's with smallest possible norn female setup that 's in the game . 
  they are big , which causes their movement to feel a bit slow and especially males have very annoying voices . 
  top kek . 
  i 've heard they are doing something online , so they might have experience with some poeple downloading stuff . 
  god damn , that 's hot !, 
  serious candidate for best looking car of 2015 . 
  as far as my experience goes : / r/mmorpg is mostly populated by people who prefer classic mmo experiences , so i 'm not even surprised they prefer heavensward , since ffxiv after reborn is pretty damn good mmo for those who seek classic old-school gameplay in new environment . 
  both games are rather uncomparable imo , because they are appealing towards different audiences . 
  if you put this question on some place where are more casual mmo players , you 'd get much more interest in hot . 
  also , if playing on laptop - it 's good to watch out if cpu is n't throttling down after while . 
  i used to play gw2 with full speed cpu , but then i realized the game runs generally much better when i reduce frequency to lower frequency without turbo boost . 
  i mean ... it 's better to have consistent 25-35 fps all the time rather than enjoying 60 fps in the start and then suddenly dropping to 10-15 fps when throttling kicks in . 
  good cooling mat can help and then you can run full speed all the time though . 
  speaking of which , i would n't recommend unparking cpu cores on any laptop unless you are very confident about it 's cooling capabilities . 
  mobile ivy bridge i5 btw, 
  never understood how did he get more ap than me by just standing in freaking lion 's arch . 
  nah , it 's still good ... just not * that good * . 
  call me old-fashioned or something , but i still think giving us more ui modification settings ( or ui addons ) would 've been good . 
  speaking in general , not just about this summary tab . 
  looks a bit off to me , but okay ... at least i have some use for summary tab now , because i tend to quickly forget where i was with my reward . 
  what makes you so pissed off ? 
  even sebastian said that he was thinking about leaving , because current f1 is n't his cup of tea . 
  not that i like horner , but this does n't make me dislike him more . 
  well ... okay ... so what ? 
  i mean - it 's his personal life , and press made a big bomb out of this just because it 's a spice girl , nobody would care otherwise . 
  my point being , we do n't know the entire story and after all it 's not even something that 's my bussiness . 
  i really do n't like this classic `` let 's judge famous people and their personal stuff based on what some gutter press pointed out . '', 
  thing . 
  there is certain stuff that makes me dislike horner too , but definitely not this . 
  reminded me of that interview matt visual did with him in 2013 . :d, 
  1,2,3,4,5 * weapon skills *, 
  f1-f4 ( yes , i can hit these without any issues ) * attunements , bursts , etc. 
  q , r , f , e * utilities + elite *, 
  ; * heal *, 
  v * dodge *, 
  rest is pretty much default . 
  intereact set to left shift . 
  let 's also not forget amount of shit he was receiving in 2013 ... and then being beaten by newcomer who was expected subpar compared to him . 
  i can easily imagine myself getting depressed by this combo . 
  this . 
  i love imola in simrace games , but i never really enjoyed it as spectator . 
  yeah , but neither fi or williams were strong back when they signed contract with them - williams was happy for 5 points and fi is long-term middle team . 
  red bull on the other hand is still direct threat . 
  also , even though that 's just my guess , they enter engine development with money loss in mind , exchanging that for that prestige and big name . 
  these engines are not meant to be profitable like classic production cars for example . 
  these engine are here for r&d and winning . 
  again - just my point of view , but i really think every engine manufacturer goes into it without vision of big profit straight from engine bussiness . 
  thanks god they did n't really conquer these other things in the end .
