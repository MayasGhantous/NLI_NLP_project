  i expect tons of this crap to drop before canadian gp is here ... one single crash , and booooom , too young , no experience , very dangerous , etc. 
  meanwhile there are way more experienced drivers , who have much worse crash rate , but hey , it must be youth and inexperience !, 
  haha , fans these days , right ? 
  did n't win two races and they already forgot his name . 
   you 're just wrong . 
  got ta love these arguments . 
  every second gp is his home gp . 
  it looks really good , although rain particles can hide some details , night seems more dark than what it used to be in older games . 
  good improvement there . 
  not gon na comment on dude 's driving skills , he probably is just a game journalist and not racing games fan . 
  iirc there should be two driving modes . 
  one is called `` pro '' and targets more realistic hardcore driving , while the classic one goes for classic casual audience , just like the old games . 
  maybe he 's using the harder version ... hmm . 
  i like how rosberg spun when he hit him in first corner - usually in older games ai had ( for some reason ) heavier cars which did n't really move unless you hit them with some serious force . 
  this seems more authentic . 
  it 's also fair to say that grosjean probably hit more drivers in single crash than some drivers will hit over their entire career . 
  i doubt they give a damn about social media ... it 's up to their pr department . 
  this is n't really a mercedes 's issue though - same shit went down on rbr profiles after multi21 and on many other ocassions . 
  lotus received quite a bit of crap for grosjean 's crashes too . 
  it 's kinda sad , but normal . 
  czech republic there ... our commentators certainly have big passion for the sport and racing in general , but they are not very professional ... usually miss out on tons of stuff , get excited on replays like it 's live action , even when they saw live action like 10 seconds ago . 
  yeah ... not really good , but at least they have no bias . 
  i would n't like it , but i 'm not a famous driver of globally popular sport . 
  and then there is helmut marko . 
  it 's not really about f1 though , is n't it . 
  f1 did n't ban tobacco advertising in first place either , it was governments , and f1 has to follow local laws ( e.g. 
  no alcohol on bahrain podium , williams running different livery without martini , etc. 
  what makes you rate verstappen so low ( especially below kvyat , sainz , or perez ) ? 
  i guess you are a bit tired of his overhype , but i would n't rate him into last 5 . 
  genuinely curious , no flame . 
  current state ( might change in future ofc . ), 
  - based purely on personal opinions :, 
  top tier : alonso , hamilton, 
  3rd tier : rosberg , ** button ** , bottas , massa , hulkenberg, 
  4th tier : grosjean , ** verstappen ** , ** raikkonen ** , nasr , sainz, 
  5th tier : kvyat , perez, 
  6th tier : maldonado , ericsson, 
  i have no real opinion on manor boys to be absolutely honest . 
  edit : marked drivers i support as a fan . 
  to be fair , maldonado was pretty unpredictable due to his brake issues . 
  as cheesy as it may sound , every point matters . 
  and when you lose those points in such way ... it hurts even more . 
  leaving lotus and leaving f1 are two different things . 
  vergne and guti , unless they really want to push in us talent . 
  rossi it is in that case . 
  he was told ? 
  oh , i missed that ... fair enough , he should 've been more careful then . 
  well that would require some superfast preparation . 
  fingers crossed , it would 've been great . 
  ot : got ta admire that old-school stache . 
  how popular is red bull on russian market ? 
  maybe they wanted to expand there . 
  too late for that i think . 
  at least for few years now . 
   it was sad that it took literally the biggest name in the sport for the better part of the last two decades to die before they did something, 
  same thing applies to f1 . 
  how is that different from mastering metagame on open world bosses though ? 
  tuna sandwich elite op , pls nerf . 
  rip 2015 championship battle . 
  holy crap , that was really smooth . 
  not a single hiccup ... even more impressive when you realize these cars were pretty hard to drive with manual shifting & no computer aid in general . 
  i do n't think i can drive this smooth and fast at the same time in a freaking videogame ... 
  i honestly hate when people shout how everybody can do well in current f1 and how easy it is to drive that car . 
  everything else aside , there is no way they can know how it is to drive current f1 car . 
  get some rest buddy . 
  i 've been using this nickname around the internet and in online games for nearly 10 years and you 're probably third person who pointed this out . 
  slight ot : imagine if they offered hot for gems ... gold/gem rate would explode . 
  jos seems to be acting a bit ... or am i the only one who thinks it 's weird that former f1 driver is afraid of fast drive in a clio ? 
  \\ #pissed, 
  jesus , how much have i missed because i did n't understand english back in these days ... and our local coverage did n't bother translating this ( ca n't blame them though :-p ) . 
  my money is on haas . 
  they have cash and some sort of ferrari backing . 
  not really build ... but i 'd love to live in zephyr sanctum :'( . 
  the most `` holy crap that 's awesome ! '', 
  location i 've seen in gw2 . 
  [ winner 's opinion on the situation ] ( https://twitter.com/frosenqvist/status/604738960481505280 ), 
  well , frank does n't really run the team nowadays , he 's hands down a living f1 legend , and i do n't even like marko ... but you ca n't deny that his influence is bigger in present - he 's the one who takes care of red bull junior programme for f1 , which is one of the most important sources of non-pay driver talents . 
  oh , well ... to be absolutely honest ? 
  i 'm surprised by the amount of people i 've never ever heard of before . 
  he 's a superstar , not denying that , but come on ... 
   blacks , asians and all the other whites can now dream and shoot to become an f1 driver . 
  i 'm not sure what is it with your obsession of talking about races all the time , but anyways ... everybody could dream about it even before hamilton was there . 
  not so classic kimi . 
  he was their ... sixth ( or something ) ... driver . 
  he 'll get over it . 
  indeed , and when i got bored , i just tried which corners are somewhat possible to do with open drs without losing control completely . 
  did n't survive a single try in eau rouge . 
  ric, 
  nas, 
  both, 
  but, 
  at least he did n't have it on selfie stick . 
  :p but to be honest ? 
  if f1 driver drove me around monaco , i would be damn sure to capture that on my phone , just so i can brag to my friends for the rest of my life . 
  1 teq hoard and 1 generic ascended chest from teq ( apothecary ... ) . 
  never had any better drop than this . 
  edit : oh yeah , let 's downvote , because i dare to answer op 's question ... \u10da ( \u0301 \u25c9 \u25de \u0c6a \u25df \u25c9 \u2035 \u10da, 
   also , it 's interesting that you did n't include lewis . 
  there was n't really any serious rivalry between seb & lewis though . 
  i think that 's why op comes up with these two .
