  it 's really hard to judge fernando 's current form when he 's driving that shitbox . 
  based on 2014 i 'd say he 's still better driver than seb , so no change at all if we 're talking purely about performance . 
  what has changed drastically though , is public image of seb ... it 's damn refreshing and i 'm still enjoying it alot . 
  oh , of course he was challenging for the title . 
  he would 've even had a shot in 2012 if it was n't for mclaren 's errors . 
  but at least from public standpoint , the real tension ( `` psychological warfare '' ) and battle was between seb & fernando . 
  i have this feel that they still do n't like each other , while lewis and seb seem to get on just okay . 
  there was an episode when we played as caithe during living story season 2 , can we expect more missions like this in hot and/or during the season 3 ? 
  it would 've been awesome to get some missions `` from the other side '' too , controlling a mordrem general or something ... 
  mission pack explaining what did rytlock do in the mists and how did he actually become revenant would 've been awesome . 
  one day , i hope . 
  i think seb did maximum possible every single race with exception of bahrain gp , so i do n't think he would do any better ( not by huge margin ) , to be honest . 
  great news , at least some classic circuits are sure to be in calendar for now . 
  when i was trying technical preview two months ago , i did n't notice any difference . 
  i think it 's safe to say win10 wo n't have any effect on the game . 
  you have to leave da space ... oh wait ... unless you 're alonso , i guess . 
  to be fair , most world champions are/were . 
  one ticket to maguuma hype express please . 
  still seems unrealistically close to me , especially considering we still do n't know much about so many aspects of the expansion . 
  when will be the time for fulltime beta ? 
  preorder is n't even ready yet ... fingers crossed though . 
  fair point , i did n't realise that . 
  damn it would 've been awesome way to celebrate 3 years anniversary . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ especially ^ ^ ^ ^ after ^ ^ ^ ^ last ^ ^ ^ ^ year 's ^ ^ ^ ^ pr ^ ^ ^ ^ debacle . 
  i 'm not a game developer so i do n't really understand directx and it 's technical background , but would that apply even if we do n't have dx12 compatible graphics chip ? 
  i mean ... i know that we are n't able to get dx12 specific effects on older chips ( or not with decent fps ) , but i 'm not sure if older chip can at least use multithreading technology based on dx12 , although it was designed to work with let 's say dx11 . 
  there you go buddy , [ reddit version ] ( http://imgur.com/sp1jk09 ) . 
  i 'm surprised by amount of people who agree with the guy , i think it 's total bullshit . 
  monaco has been tight as crap for longer than this dude is alive . 
  and other tracks ? 
  if he wants to jab at runoffs , then hello , most of them were made due to other series and not f1 ( though i dislike them too ) . 
  seems like the list of `` i definitely do n't miss f1 '' drivers who were subpar to their teammates is neverending . 
  he was below average in f1 , but hey , it must 've been sport 's fault . 
  god bless montoya , proving that being good in other series can be done without trash talking f1 whenever there is a chance to do so . 
  yeah , because one crazy long straight is very exciting ... 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  what has changed about monaco in last 20 years ? 
  and even more - what has changed because of f1 ? 
  monaco is not a good track , but it has never been , it did n't get worse because of f1 . 
  he 's talking crap . 
  well , at least there is still a list he tops ahead of other drivers . 
  let 's be realistic though . 
  gw2 is much bigger game in terms of technology , programming , designing , etc. 
  also , it seems like ncsoft was n't willing to pump money into arenanet because wildstar was coming . 
  now that ws is out ( and failing ) , ncsoft probably decided it 's about time to pump some cash into arenanet , so they can provide us so demanded expansion pack . 
  you do n't make a huge expansion pack without cash . 
  do you think haas will be faster than fi or what ? 
  big difference between `` money leaks '' in fifa and f1 is that f1 has them legally stated , teams know how much are they receiving and how much goes into fia/fom/bernie 's / whoever pocket . 
  we also know that ferrari gets huge bonus just because they are ferrari . 
  legally speaking , it 's all clear . 
  fifa on the other hand ... well ... you get the idea . 
  f1 's economy is not okay because of how it 's set up , not because it 's shady or something . 
  give me a gun and i 'll shoot these drones down for free . 
  on more serious note ... this is really sad example of what 's not okay with humanity . 
  i think it 's : alonso  vettel  hamilton in terms of ruthless attitude . 
  alonso has very colorful history of specific incidents . 
  vettel has had one big ruthless moment ( speaking of media approach , it 's still nothing compared to crashgate ) and few lesser ... and to be honest , i do n't really remember hamilton having any controversy of this type . 
  he 's that type of guy who cares alot about public image and such shady stuff does n't go well with it . 
  alonso and vettel on the other hand do n't really care about publicity as long as they can stand on that top podium spot . 
  that 's just my view though . 
  ... nope , not really . 
  woooo , kimi might get ahead of williams in quali !, 
   i love how this sub claims we absolutely need quiet 800hp v6 hybrids that rev to 12,000 rpm, 
  this sub claims this ? 
  ** + vettel ** gets cocky when he 's in the car . 
  ** - maldonado ** his spanish gp 2012 was pretty damn impressive . 
  new dungeons with new gear ( skins ) . 
  tons of them . 
  do n't really care if 5man or more , but dungeons . 
  anet pls . 
  i was hoping for warrior to get staff , but this is cool too , looking forward to it . 
  is it really necessary to act like this ? 
  what is it ? 
  you 're butthurt because he has a girlfriend ? 
  some people will never learn . 
  even world champions . 
  vettel 's spin in first lap of 2012 brazil gp . 
  i think my heart stopped beating for a moment . 
  yep , he did . 
  i remember her reporting on that later on . 
  i do n't think he really needed to , so kudos to him . 
  rekt, 
  i had to check twice if that 's actually his account . 
  he 's in the mood today , is n't he . 
  lewis was pretty active on social media years before this survey . 
  but i agree , it 's always nice to see their more human face . 
  as far as i can see , most people in this thread had a good laugh . 
  volunteer . 
  but seriously ... blazing light for life yo . 
  great , at least in this matter common sense won over nostalgia glasses . 
  damn , such quality was ... very unexpected . 
  thumbs up , good job . 
  hi , thanks for this ama !, 
  how big is gpda 's actual influence ? 
  i mean ... honestly , survey was great and well put , but will it actually have any effect on the way things go in f1 ? 
  are you ( gpda ) going to put pressure on decision makers in f1 ? 
  with all due respect , i 'm a bit skeptical about driver 's influence when it comes to general direction of the sport . 
  meowsifies . 
   when bernie retires ( or . . you know . . the other thing . . ), 
  goes into jail ?
