  might be because i do n't see a thing through all these particle effects , but ... ehm , i mean ... absolutely amazing job . 
  exactly . 
  as i said - times have changed and it 's really better to simply say who are the all time greats , rather than picking single guy and put him above others .

  guild wars franchise cancelled , focus now towards free to play mobile games and facebook gaming . 
  out of all possible troll accounts , you pick up him ... 
   there is this one particular user / u/jetshockeyfan that just appears out of no were, 
  dude 's been on reddit for 2 years and has 44k + comment karma . 
   and responds with like 30 replies anytime kimi is mentioned, 
  yeah , screw the guy for being interested in one particular topic ( * that 's not trolling * ) . 
   but you only have to take a quick look at this thread, 
  what about it ? 
  people disagreed with you , is it really that much ? 
  i 've been to forums where people wish you cancer for saying something bad about their favorite driver , few downvotes ( currently your top-level comment is positively voted ) and some casually sarcastic comment is just part of the discussion to me . 
  i 'd say that days of autonomous car being able to beat real champion in quali over single lap are n't that far . 
  full gp though ? 
  i doubt it can happen anytime soon . 
  ai in racing sims is not even there yet , i ca n't imagine it being any better in real environment with uncomparably bigger amount of variables . 
  if anything , it would be either slow , or very dangerous , imo . 
  you forgot to edit sainz . 
  try older f1 games from ea from early 2000s if you do n't mind graphics ( do n't really remember handling though ) . 
  toca race driver 3 is rather too arcady , but it has f1 cars too and you even have to earn them through a special game mode in which you go from go-karts , to f3000 , etc. , and then finally you get to drive williams f1 . 
  i had a good time with these games back in the days . 
  the only issue is that it misses almost every f1 track . 
  this . 
  it 's a track with fun layout , but it does n't generate good racing at all . 
  it 's one of those tracks where it 's hard to overtake even in simracing , unless you want to punch somebody out of the track . 
  what a legend . 
  played in two of my absolutely hands down favorite movies of all time ... 
  i was n't really that excited about guild halls to be honest , but damn , if this is their main attraction on e3 , it should be pretty awesome . 
  looking forward to it . 
  duh , i thought i had enough of it after 2 hours . 
  in total . 
  that 's fun ... and also kinda sad . 
  adding more salt into bleeding wounds of mchonda fans . 
  i feel for ya buddies out there !, 
  i 'm gon na miss button on the track once he leaves f1 . 
  he might not be the most exciting driver to watch , but it 's just impossible not to like him . 
  hamilton has changed this year especially . 
  i expected him to go full classic bullshit spitting hamilton after monaco cockup , and damn i would n't even blame him this time , but he handled it so well it actually surprised me . 
  i used to hate that guy , but he 's starting to grow on me . 
  what is it with general dislike for palmer ? 
  just curious , i 've seen some gp2 races last year and i did n't have any issues with the guy . 
  i used this argument from time to time when there was no idea of guild halls ever coming , and i got downvoted like it was a lie or something . 
  come on guys , summon your inner woodenpotatoe and check some older lore - he 's right , there is a lore basis for game 's name . 
  just saying though , it will be cool feature nevertheless . 
  i 'm not gon na be that `` no chance guy '' , but it seems far from reality to say the least . 
  unless mercedes keep their game up for unbelieveably long time , i do n't think he 's gon na break michael 's wdc record . 
  that 's the main issue with all these predictions and `` might happen '' opinions , f1 is not spec series , and his title run is not just up to his form . 
  just finish the race , please . 
  most likely , yeah . 
  guild wars is a name with good sound . 
  do n't think of 0 rating as something personal , or against that person 's question . 
  questions get asnwered almost every single time , they do n't need to get on frontpage . 
  verizon might be , i have no idea . 
  but my d802 works amazing with lollipop . 
  i 'd go with stock lollipop update anytime , it 's much nicer , works well and i have n't even really noticed any battery life change once the os settled down on the device . 
  stock android is nicer , but i tried several roms and while they were smooth , i got ta say i prefer stock lg experience because it 's way more stable ( no reboot on stock since ... ever ) , and ... dat camera experience . 
  those tyres man . 
  full set of these monsters alone must be heavier than entire current car is . 
  pit crew would have to do some heavy lifting training in order to attach these to car in a good time . 
  right ? 
  he forgot to add `` scuderia '' before ferrari . 
  well , speaking of crazy conspiracies , i even read that petrov held alonso back because renault wanted him to do so ( red bull = renault engine ) . 
  i do n't buy it , just saying . 
  some people still feel the pain for 2010 . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ feel ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ joy ^ ^ ^ ^ though . 
  you play with manual gearbox on a pad ? 
  respect , i can go with manual gearbox only with steering wheel , could n't ever get into `` feeling it '' on gamepad or keyboard . 
  wait , deliberately ? 
  when ? 
  i know he always blames others , but i thought he 's `` just '' a clunky driver . 
  except those which are on frontpage . 
  2012 , in brazil . 
  michael and seb are big friends with sort of a `` master-apprentice '' relationship , he let him through deliberately , becaus wdc `` stays in the family '' . 
  quite different scenario if you ask me . 
  czech republic player here - everything seems to be working just fine . 
  that 's rather weird , considering i 'm in central europe . 
  am i the only one who considers this pretty childish with very predictable , cheap `` joking '' ? 
  the only non-cringy part was the illuminati joke at the very end . 
  not for us as gw2 players and fans , but these types of `` top 10 '' articles always attract many readers , and it might appeal to some people and push them into thinking : `` wow , this guild wars game is just behind warcraft , and it 's ahead of final fantasy and elder scrolls ... should be great , i 'll give it a try . '', 
  i do n't know how about us market , but many people here in central europe do n't really know much about gw . 
  and those who heard of it , think it 's some kind of korean grinder , ... 
  / r/grandtheftautov / is pretty active and big too , though it 's questionable how long will it last . 
  this is classic issue with mmo communities in general . 
  some people claim wow to be dead since the burning crusade release ... 
  that 's why i posted it here . 
  we 've already had enough people bashing his decision , this is fine refreshment . 
  he was the best bet czech republic ever had in open-wheel racing , so quite understandably he still gets lots of shit for it even though it 's been many years now . 
  i got to meet him on local f1 fans meeting and he 's a nice guy though . 
  i highly recommend these 360 videos on phone or tablet , because unlike on pc , you do n't have to click to move it - it moves synchronously with you . 
  vr is damn cool thing . 
  i do n't think point is about pot making you faster . 
  it 's more like it might be dangerous to drive when you 're high . 
  nope . 
  and if that ever happens , i hope there will be checkbox stating that i want to play only with people who bought the game ... 
  you 're nuts dude . 
  you literally take few days old posts from there , post it to your soloreddit and x-post it here like it 's some unique content from your sub . 
  and you wonder why people downvote you ... seriously ...
