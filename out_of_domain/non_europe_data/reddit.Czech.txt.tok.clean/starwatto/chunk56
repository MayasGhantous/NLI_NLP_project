  they decide whether slow cars can unlap or not . 
  how about that ? 
  every driver 's pace is worse when he 's behind someone . 
  wtf man . 
  i 'm obviously very biased , but i still give that to vettel . 
  after bad 2014 which i mostly spent reading excuses coming from his fans ( at least those who did n't jump the ship to aboard the mercedes hype train :p ) this was a fantastic refreshment . 
  i believed in him , but honestly , there was some doubt hiding in my mind . 
  not anymore , he 's still an amazing top level driver and has proved himself as new ferrari number 1 . 
  but aside from that , hamilton was freaking amazing if we exclude hungary . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen such consistency and maturity from him - that 2014 wdc has boosted his mindset big time . 
   hamilton does n't have the moustache !, 
  ftfy, 
  technically , he 's not wrong . 
  you need two legs and arms to drive it . 
  with this in mind i 'd rather see them build up a fresh new team from scratch than `` just '' buying out an existing one . 
  it will be great nevertheless , but i 'd always appreciate more cars on the grid . 
  what kind of kimi related post would it be without you in comments section . 
   after rosbergs attitude in looking backwards rather than attacking forwards, 
  what do you base this statement on ? 
  genuinely curious , not looking for argument . 
  forge artwork looks absolutely mega . 
  i have n't touched my engi since i got him to 80 . 
  guess it will change with expac . 
  i think that was even their purpose , i reckon somebody from that circuit 's management saying that . 
  this made my morning . 
  whoever is f1.com 's editor , he should get raise !, 
  after they somewhat fixed their website it appears to be a good source of f1 info . 
  i really like this new trend in f1 and it 's presence on the internet . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ ^ fom ^ ^ ^ ^ stopped ^ ^ ^ ^ taking ^ ^ ^ ^ down ^ ^ ^ ^ every ^ ^ ^ ^ single ^ ^ ^ ^ fan ^ ^ ^ ^ video . 
  i do n't think the article is as bad as some people here suggest . 
  it just feels more like some f1 fan 's blog rather than professional analysis of each driver 's performance . 
  i use facts like this to explain to non-f1 fans why schumi is such all-time legend . 
  you ca n't really explain to somebody who does n't watch the sport things like his driving style , his legendary ability in rain , his brilliant yet often very reckless moves and other stuff like that . 
  at least when i try , they always just give me * the look * and say something like `` oh , okay ... 
  cool . '', 
  but facts like this one never stop to impress even if you have no idea what 's the sport about . 
  jenson , dc and jordan . 
  the lad gear . 
  something something another senna fanboy who only saw the movie and knows nothing about the man himself . 
  so ... you just dismissed schumi because he was a cheat ( your words ) and then pick senna as the best ever , who was no saint either . 
  i would call senna a legend too , but you 're out of point . 
  i 'm not british , but as far as i can see stuff around myself , it 's not really just a bbc thing . 
  entire society is currently moving towards this . 
  not that i like it . 
  if i had a chance i would go there and listen to his techniques and would n't feel weird next to those kids , not even for a second . 
  now that 's a really interesting til post . 
  never heard of that . 
  even better is that he 's now some sort of renault ambassador or something . 
  well we ca n't expect her to come and say `` yeah i suck , i 'm here for my fine ass . 
  '' , ca n't we ... 
  i dismiss reverse grids with passion . 
  you forgot the sarcasm flag mate . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ hope ^ ^ you ^ ^ did . 
  optimal racing line assist in codemaster 's f1 games is a mess buddy . 
  sometimes it 's right , but sometimes it 's plain wrong . 
  i 'm not absolutely sure , but i think istanbul gp 's racing line assist was just plain wrong for like half of the track in 2011 . 
  better learn optimal way by yourself than looking at what games shows you to do . 
  do n't . 
  please . 
  what ? 
  i simply did n't like the feel of the class , both in gameplay and aesthetical matter . 
  i just recently got it to 80 because reaper looks fantastic . 
  i do like that death knight-ish feeling abound it , so i 'll probably stick with reaper and wo n't ever return to base class as it 's simply not my type of thing . 
  can you imagine this sub and official forums if arenanet made a sale before the launch of the game ? 
  nope . 
  they decided not to do it after community flipped out when they announced it . 
  sad for us ascended users , good for the rest , i guess . 
  oh my ... guess it 's time to start running fractals more seriously . 
  at least i have something to do before the laucnh of hot . 
  thanks for clarifying !, 
  yeah . 
  but being the most casual mmo out there apparently has it 's negatives too . 
  whatever , i can live with that . 
  i 'd make my ascended armor anyways , just for that feeling . 
  i have heavy set complete . 
  i 'll probably go with medium one next , because light armor is suicide ... maybe i 'll have it done by the end of 2020 or something . 
  sounds nice . 
  got ta say i really enjoy recent xandria style . 
  last two albums have sweet spot in my playlist and based on this and demos on google play it seems like new one will be fun too . 
  i remember starting my first ssd windows installation and going to make a coffee and some snack . 
  and returning to installed os asking me for my microsoft account . 
  just wow . 
  that being said , everytime i have to use pc with hdd only , it 's such a pain now . 
  are you sure it 's because of windows 10 ? 
  i did n't notice any improvements . 
  to me it sounds more like clean installation thing - did you try gw2 on fresh older windows installation ? 
  good for you anyways . 
  there 's way more skill in that than in other games in which it 's purely based on rng mechanic that makes your dodge/parry/whatever by % chance from your gear . 
  click the link mate , that 's not hakkinens overtake . 
  i like their current confidence regarding this . 
  they would n't joke about it if they did n't have some really good stuff in their pocket , right ? 
  ^ right ? 
  ^ ^ right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ guys ? 
  i have some news for you then . 
  you ... what ... uh ... i do n't even ... 
  yaaaay , raids !, 
  wow , ricciardo spends summer break almost the same way i do . 
  some actually would .
