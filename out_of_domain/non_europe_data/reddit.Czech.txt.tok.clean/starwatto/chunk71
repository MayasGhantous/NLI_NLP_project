  guilty . 
  huh , what are you talking about ? 
  damn , i never really was that hardcore about sab returning , but this video made me miss it so bad . 
  this . 
  and even if it would be possible to build it just as fast as it was in the game , there is no way drivers could drive it full speed without passing out . 
  honestly , too bad they found that issue early on . 
  as always , ferrari needs mercedes to screw up something in order to grab the top spot . 
  wow , kimi ahead of seb in quali fair and square . 
  good job . 
  looking forward to race . 
  so that 's why he screws around with monza 's contract !, 
  you can also buy blue ferrari yet their f1 team is red ... 
  kimi is your friend ? 
   he seems like a personable guy but i bet he 's a ruthless fucker behind the scenes . 
  pretty much like most famous bosses of great and famous companies . 
  coffee ready . 
  biscuits ready . 
  ferrari hype ready . 
  do not disturb on phone set . 
  let 's do this . 
  fucking hell that start kimi ... :-(, 
  totonator : no questions , come with me if you want to win . 
  really interested what was that fuzz regarding lewis ' car about . 
  ricciardo for once had great start . 
  worst podium interview ever though . 
  but i do n't blame him , no way he could handle that crowd . 
  a long time ago in a galaxy far far away ... 
  haha , yeah . 
  honest cunts . 
  well , to be honest , now that the race and ceremony is over , i do n't care * that much * if seb gets the win afterwards . 
  lewis still drove really well and i doubt it gave him any worthwhile advantage . 
  but yeah ... rules are rules , we 'll see how that pans out . 
  i never really cared about felipe , but this got me . 
  you can tell the guy still loves it . 
  * grabs popcorn *, 
  this will be fun week . 
  nah , i think people would argue even if they dsqed them . 
  maybe not as much , but still . . 
  aw man , monday trash talk will be very juicy . 
  only thing it would likely do is improving seb 's chance to beat nico , not lewis . 
  i do n't miss traction control and even worse overtaking conditions . 
  sensation of speed definitly is better in montoya 's lap though . 
  this is the type of stuff mods definitely should delete without any hesitation . 
  if you really feel need to post it , just do so in post-race discussion . 
  there are more people bitching about hamilton haters than actual hamilton haters . 
  of course my estimation might be just as precise as yours , but who cares . 
  this post is 100 % shitpost and op obviously has some issues with lewis , but i am really tired of reading how many people hate lewis in every thread whenever somebody states something else than how awesome he is . 
  i doubt my top comment there would be as upvoted as it is if there were as many haters as some of you guys think there are . 
  first i did n't pay any attention to the song and therefore did n't really get it . 
  now i hear what you did there . 
  i do n't bother explaining the sport to people who think it 's not worthwhile . 
  i think football is not worthwhile ( for me ) and therefore i am not interested into people explaining me otherwise , i can imagine them thinking the same . 
  but if somebody asks me what i find so interesting about it - well , i usually start explaining how fast these cars are and that there is much more to it than just turning steering-wheel for a few hours a week . 
  how race strategies work , and of course - i mention that there is a fair amount of drama behind all that racing . 
  more cars did that during the course of the race . 
  what matters most is whether you actually gain something by it . 
  stewards have telemetry and timing , they can easily judge whether driver gains something or not - no matter if it is just time or positions . 
  monaco was quite lucky for him . 
  italy certainly is the most under-represented as of now . 
  closely followed by france and maybe even japan ? 
  there are n't any truly legendary japanese drivers , but there have been quite a few decent drivers in the past ... 
  i sort of miss japanese name in the sport now . 
  interesting thing is that germany was kind of recently over-represented ( if that really is a thing ) due to schumi and brutal jump in popularity during and closely after his mighty era . 
  what was it , like 6 drivers in 2010 ? 
  now it seems like things are going back to normal . 
  just search up some pics of seb in 2013 on podium . 
  you 'll find out that lewis still looks good . 
  and yes , i was his fan even during rb era . 
   see you in singapore, 
  gold . 
  dae no more ** f ** errari ** i ** nternational ** a ** ssitance ? 
  still got undercut by prostberg, 
  he just fell asleep because he was tired of developing the car all night . 
  nah , true formula 1 was just in 50s , since then it 's just load of bullshit and stupid politics . 
  if you make abrams put jar jar into new star wars , i 'm going to kill somebody . 
  sorry for ot . 
  is it just because there were more people during f1 race , or are gp2 cars really that louder than f1 cars ? 
  i 'm interested whether ferrari is so confident that they can beat rbr even if they give them their engine . 
  on one side it would be great to see some more competition against mercedes , but on the other side i do n't want rbr to beat ferrari . 
  at this point i do n't even give a fuck anymore . 
  i 'm just sad for their drivers . 
  yeah , not just him . 
  we all do . 
  not that 2014 shit again . 
  if they want him to go , so be it , but let fans say proper goodbye to the man . 
  he deserves it . 
  those two guys happen to be the most successful formula 1 drivers of this time . 
  so i can see some relevance to f1 . 
  how is kimi second ? 
  from my understanding it was his fault that he stalled on the start and even though his push through the field was good , he still dropped 3 positions to his quali . 
  not worthy of second best driver of the day , let alone top 5 performance . 
  i would call him man of the day in quali , but not in race . 
  and next thing - how is bottas ahead of massa ? 
  i mean ... come on . 
  author must have a thing for finnish drivers , stating that bottas is worthy of ferrari team ? 
  how come ? 
  massa was fired from ferrari and bottas was slower than massa . 
  where 's the logic behind it ? 
   i do n't think any former driver has more sour grapes than mark webber . 
  nah , we still have villeneuve .
