  i see no problem in your comment . 
  and as for alonso , as much as i hate to say it , you have a point ... 
  i ca n't come up with any race where he was this bad . 
  he spun once in a big style , but he also lost the car when he was trying to outrbreak maldonado . 
  i think that 's what / u/oh84s is reffering to . 
  it 's been a while since alonso was salty about vettel . 
  haha . 
  just when i started to like lewis ... 
  people are n't allowed to say anything uncool about him . 
  he was the biggest saint and literally f1 jesus did n't you know ? 
  sorry for first comment i misread the question . 
  i think alonso would be better and win this duel , but honestly i would be super happy to be proven wrong in this case . 
  there were italians on the grid before and they did n't drive for ferrari . 
  i would n't bet on that changing anytime soon . 
  just a troll . 
  pretty much a vettelquokka . 
  it 's really just sad . 
  from such dominant glory it was super fast downfall . 
  i 'm not sad for their top management people , but i 'm sad for the rest of the team , who are dragged down by these decisions as well . 
  `` but you know , his team changed setup to low downforce to ease overtaking so that pretty much does n't count . '', 
  i was so pissed reading all that type of shit afterwards . 
  because running with clean air setup somehow makes sense when you 're fighting from the back . 
  watching all practice sessions or nothing !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ tbh . 
  comments on this post . 
  whilst everybody is arguing about ricciardo vs. vettel , le wild kimiquokka appears to save the day . 
  thank you !, 
  it 's not as bad though . 
  not even close . 
  i read through / r/motogp a bit to get a grip of all that drama and damn that was madness . 
  god damn i hope he wo n't . 
  that would be the worst thing for me to see since 2g1c . 
  my father has been watching f1 since early 90s so i literally grew up with it . 
  i was n't that hardcore into it as i am now , but i still have very fond memories of watching f1 with my dad since early childhood . 
  oddly enough , for some reason , we tend to support/dislike exactly opposite drivers . 
  he hated schumacher , i loved him . 
  he loved montoya , i never really liked him up until recently . 
  he loves hamilton , i 'm not really a fan of his . 
  he despised vettel big time during his rbr run ( not so much now , although he still jabs at him ) , i was a fan . 
  and so on ... the only driver we can really agree on is alonso , neither of us likes him , even though we respect his abilities . 
  and ricciardo of course , who does n't love ricciardo ... 
  nah , facebook comments area is still uncomparably worse . 
  no matter at which page . 
  no , he 's not . 
  disregarding everything else - hamilton was born when senna was still alive . 
  so / r/quityourbullshit . 
  i 'm gon na proudly explain to my grandchildren that i 've seen legendary chilton in action . 
  usually just when somebody is playing a quiz game . 
  once my friend asked me with which team schumi won most championships . 
  who does n't know that ... :-|, 
  maybe twice upon a year somebody asks me to explain something from the sport . 
  it seems like my hour monotalk tires them a bit though . 
  either i tell you everything or nothing damn it !, 
  umm ... i hate to be that guy . 
  but what if their modified renault engine is still crap ? 
  you know , they ca n't blame renault in that case . 
  umm . 
  this is probably the most complex , yet rightfully downvoted post i 've ever seen on reddit as a whole . 
  thumbs up for taking effort to write that down , but i ca n't help , it 's load of bs . 
  let 's just settle it down by saying that we both like vettel . 
  no need to justify your fandom towards driver by saying that he 's the best . 
  as / u/themarvz said , in the end we all cheer for the guy we like most , not the guy that is ultimately the best ... because there is no such thing , partially because it 's impossible to compare/measure . 
  kind of like williams then . 
  or mclaren . 
  i just lost a work project . 
  i 'm trying to get some hang of professional stuff whilst still being on college but god damn it 's hard to mix up everything together . 
  school + work + social life + hours spent on reddit = way to go if you hate sleeping . 
  oh god , yes please . 
  movie about kenobi would be a blast . 
  kenobi as a character has a great potential and definitely deserves his own movie . 
  do you really need more ram ? 
  especially on pure android . 
  we have blue/yellow combo with sauber , i 'd much rather see that modern livery they had on r30 . 
  damn that was a sexy car . 
  we need more yellow goodness in f1 . 
  if you people want to remain sane , for god 's sake do n't read comments below that photo . 
  good that he clarified everything , hopefuly most of us can move on now . 
  there are some dank memes in youtube comments though . 
  sometimes . 
  instagram is great , you just have to set it up properly . 
  i follow mostly just models , pornstars and f1 related profiles ... and yeah , then some irl friends , but you get the idea . 
  i might give german coverage a shot . 
  even though i do n't understand shit . 
   has to be the most successful android phone made , if not one of the most . 
  i believe that goes to galaxy s4 , followed by s iii and s ii . 
  samsung rocks this market big time . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_best-selling_mobile_phones ), 
  marquez is such a great number two driver . 
  you do n't see that much dedication very often in motorsport . 
  i do n't know motogp fans that well , but schumi 's attempt in adelaide did n't haunt him for the rest of his career either . 
  i think he 'll be fine , even though hardcore fans will never forget . 
  yes . 
  nobody likes losing . 
  who ? 
  wtf man, 
  edit : oh , nvm , read username, 
  rossi = chocolate senna without chocolate, 
  he wins every race . 
  in our hearts . 
  i just got back to f1 2015 .
