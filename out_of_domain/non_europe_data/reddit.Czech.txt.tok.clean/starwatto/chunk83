  every damn race i lose positions because my tyres fall off the cliff earlier than ai 's . 
  dae too pushing hard is forbiden ? 
  webber was right after all . 
  talk about dream team really . 
  it 's not a space ship . 
  but yeah , there probably is no place for gearbox in that amyways . 
  seems like op is ghostface . 
   no matter what people think of massa , nobody deservers to lose a wdc the way he did . 
  i can definitly agree with this sentiment . 
  i 'm not a fan of felipe , and i god damn i am tired of reading how he should 've won the championship . 
  but losing it like this ... is just too cruel . 
  to him , to his fans , to everybody . 
  i believe these are movistar graphics , not official fom graphics . 
  but yeah , nice addition . 
  even if he has , it does n't change much . 
  is it monday already ? 
  he might be salty , but i do n't see anything salty about that `` get this mclaren out of the way ! '' . 
  through the season he shouted the same thing regarding manor 's to say the least , if not even more teams . 
  chances are he did n't even know who was inside that mclaren car . 
  as always , people need to read actual article and button 's message before passing any judgement . 
  he 's not criticising lewis or anything . 
  it 's more like your older and wiser friend 's advice . 
  after all , jenson knows a thing or two about living a playboy life ... 
  of course we would . 
  does n't change anything , does n't it ? 
  as far as i can see nobody is saying `` i 'd do better than him . '', 
  so amusing , yet so smooth . 
  i guess you could say ... that his oversteer was massive . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ did ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ sound ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ better ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ head . 
  man does n't have fondest memories of brazil as of recent years . 
  that final sentence was absolutely unnecessary . 
  playing games is no different way to spend your free time than watching movies , series , or sports . 
  to answer your original question , we 're on reddit , and that scene was so ridiculous it became internet meme . 
  and people on reddit usually like memes . 
  it 's not the best meme ever ( cod games are way past their prime as well ) , but there goes answer for your original question . 
  for some reason your comment made me remember [ this ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bs5_wofieaa3vut.jpg ) . 
  they should just donate some money and shut up about it . 
  this sounds ridiculous . 
  and puts pretty weird type of light on lewis . 
  a man in his place certainly has higher ambitions and dreams than your average joe . 
  as a czech , yes i do remember him . 
  the hype was very real when he got to race . 
  too bad it did n't work out so well afterwards ... not denying that it was his fault though . 
  it just sucks for czech fans . 
  reminds me of their last year edition of f1 can that was sold here in czech republic . 
  sometime in spring i got to buy a pack of 4 big cans for just 4 $ approx when they were on sale . 
  pretty good deal , and my brother is nerd into collecting cans , so he appreciated it too . 
  they had rb10 drawn on it . 
  top blokes alonso and button . 
  there are still two races ahead of us , let 's not finish the counting yet . 
  damn it . 
  where were you all season ? 
  good stuff . 
  seriously , what 's the point of acting so salty . 
  you have god damn championship man , cheer up ... 
  yep , that 's about as much internet as i can take tonight . 
  damn that 's actually a pretty nice idea . 
  even more so if they make some young karting champs do this . 
  meet your heroes before you get to face them in years to come . 
  would 've been cool . 
  what really gets me that whenever nico lost this season people were shitposting `` dat face says all '' all the time , but the way lewis acted yesterday is way worse as he did n't even have some slight dignity to swallow that sour pill . 
  how ? 
  look at that rear wing again mate . 
  how would you flip it in order to lessen the downforce ? 
  yes , i have double standards regarding this . 
  so what ? 
  as far as i can see middle east is n't part of my culture . 
  yet , to say the least . 
  war is terrible , but if you think i am bad person for feeling more for people on `` my side '' , well , there is no discussion to be held anymore . 
  well , i think if there was any genuine reason behind it , he would 've already stated that . 
  the fact he did n't say anything makes me think he was really just being salty . 
  edit : maybe he was just having a shit . 
  and i 'll gladly apologise if that 's the case . 
  yeah , definitely not `` championship is over let 's take it easy '' type of lap . 
  what got me was when our local commentator actually said `` well that looked like pretty calm lap apart from that slight mistake in the middle sector ... not sure what lap was he watching , but this has been right on the edge . 
  there are drivers who obey team orders to back off . 
  but hamilton is not one of them . 
  even if this is true and mercedes has executed `` multi644 '' for rest of the season , i doubt lewis would just bow down and sit tight behind nico . 
  but hey , maybe i 'm wrong - just my point of view . 
  oh yeah , that 's definitely what he meant . 
  my point was that by no means this was a calm lap . 
  god damn our local commentary was terrible this time . 
  our commentator screamed `` champagneeeeeeee '' into the mic that it nearly killed our audio system , at the end of the race cheered for bottas winning the race ( seriously , what the fuck ) , called ericsson marcussen , said that pastor maldonado just overtook pastor maldonado , and every 5 minutes missed something on the screen , despite this being one of the most boring races of the season . 
  about the race ... pretty meh , thanks god at least verstappen was doing something worthwhile . 
  also - worth mentioning that in china nico got a lot of shit for complaining about dirty air . 
  lewis now encountered the same problem . 
  just saying , nothing more . 
  [ sport tv ] ( http://www.sport1tv.cz/ ) , belongs under amc . 
  it 's paid channel by the way . 
  i thought he did fine . 
  finally some juicy questions on podium interview . 
  three very good races actually . 
  my guess is some kind of inside joke . 
  he seemed to point at somebody on the podium . 
  he must 've seen verstappen do the move on trackside tv panel and thought `` damn son i can do that too ! '', 
  but senna is literally god too . 
  yeah . 
  he got there with his bicycle . 
  holy crap that 's just sad . 
  mclaren as a whole is just sad .
