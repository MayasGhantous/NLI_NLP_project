  and it 's making me sad . 
  i grew up watching them fighting for championships just to watch them fighting for points later on . 
  wtf, 
  one year they apologise for taking too risky path . 
  the year after for being conservative ... pirelli has tough job . 
  i 'm just sitting here and waiting if he does something that genuinely pisses me off . 
  so far i really like him . 
  red bull certainly knew what they were doing when they offered him seat ... what might have seemed as mostly marketing move back when they announced him , now looks like bringing one of the greatest talents into sport . 
  damn it , my comments about verstappen are getting more circlejerky than my comments about vettel ... 
  first half of winter break is very easy for me as i have to study pretty hard for winter semester finals . 
  and then - playing f1 games like mad , mostly . 
  also watching tv series and movies i did n't have time to watch during weekends most of the year . 
  i have a plan of rewatching 2010 season this winter , if i find enough time . 
  fair enough , those two things were n't cool , but they did n't really make me dislike him . 
  it probably would , had it been different driver in that crash . 
  i think they did , but they did n't provide any results regarding that iirc . 
  can we , please , finally move on ? 
  yes , he might have lost because he did n't get chance to undercut , but it 's not like we can change it even if we ( they ) wanted to ... damn it . 
  it was n't funny the first time . 
  it 's still not funny . 
  massive = they will be able to finish races ? 
  point is , would you rather lose to lewis in mercedes or drive that crappy mclaren in midfield when you get lucky on retirements of others ? 
  i believe he 's right about frustration of his rivals , but i doubt it 's bigger than his own , at least right now , after this season . 
  which is what he said unless my english fails me . 
  top banter m8, 
  i remember that media even asked seb about this dinner . 
  he responded with something along the lines of `` eating is important . '', 
  what a time to be alive . 
  well , to be fair , he still might be nice guy , but f1 is high level political game , he would n't last too long as head of ferrari if he was n't using his power for well of his team . 
  that stache though . 
  everything else aside , i want to say , that i appreciate his honesty on this matter . 
  no pr bs , just straight up stating his opinion . 
  it 's fair rating . 
  before this turns out into brutal shitshow , please , fellow vettel fans : he 's not saying that vettel is bad driver . 
  i 'll probably just leave it there . 
  just stop , please . 
  i guess it 's easier to provide people some content about yourself . 
  facebook for example does quite alot of filtering in background which means that not everything certain person posts gets to you ( although if you like and comment most of their content , facebook will push them on top more ) . 
  there is no such thing on instagram/twitter , or at least on their primary content feed . 
  not sure why twitter is less popular though , probably just instagram being more popular - simple lifestyle decision . 
  i 'd go as far as saying that most teams do n't want two top class drivers . 
  sometimes it ends up as legendary as it did with senna/prost ( less likely ) , and sometimes it ends up like majestic fuckup with hamilton/alonso and nearly with vettel/webber ( back in 2010 webber was fairly close to seb in performance to say the least ) . 
  the latter is more likely . 
  does n't motogp do something like that ? 
  would 've been pretty cool . 
  it does n't have to be on every race weekend , but few times a year ... just for fun . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ guys , ^ ^ ^ ^ you 'd ^ ^ ^ ^ make ^ ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ ^ own ^ ^ ^ ^ championship ^ ^ ^ ^ tables ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ this . 
  it 's verge so ... but that bike is great . 
  he 's right about them . 
  better deal with it . 
  came here to post this . 
  he 's genius when it comes to soundtrack music , but he 's also kind of an asshole . 
  he genuinely scammed people who bought his work - not cool . 
  then you should go back and play first two to remind yourself how much more depth there was in these games . 
  i played bf2 recently so i know what i am talking about . 
  ea 's battlefront is nowhere near being so content rich and fun . 
  i wish they would n't try to do it in their own way and just took second installment and remade it into modern engine . 
  that would 've been enough to make me give that game 10/10 . 
  now it 's solid 7/10 , which is n't bad , but the game could 've been much more - and that 's problem . 
  if you like , good for you , ale people should n't ignore the fact that previous games were uncomparably better gameplay-wise . 
  what 's the capacity of stadium ? 
  it looks pretty sad to me despite this being quite a show . 
  iirc stadiums were more full in previous years . 
  thank you for your stream !, 
  but ... [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/yw78dhb ) creeped me out a bit along with that mad dubstep for second . 
  grosjean absolutely wrecked palmer . 
  6 seconds . 
  and here we go , mchonda jokes on sky . 
  not that i hate them , i just find it hilarious they found way to say them even in roc broadcast . 
  seb do n't fuck this up, 
  i need my bragging rights, 
  battle we all watch this for . 
  i know it 's just for fun ... i know it ... okay ... but ... haaaaaa !, 
  let me enjoy this . 
  nice to see ricciardo and vettel being so cool with each other . 
  it certainly gets some special vibe when there are drivers you know and root for in f1 . 
  i probably would n't enjoy it much if there was none of my favorite drivers . 
  damn it seb !, 
  it was so clean up until that ... 
  edit : nevermind . 
  god damn that was close . 
  commentary kept saying it the other way around all the time ... 
  pretty good show !, 
  germany now goes to finals as they beat nordic team ( kristensen/sohlberg ) . 
  here 's hoping that they can face jb in finals !, 
  i guess he had massive understeer . 
  oh god . 
  but hey , he beat ricciardo , i do n't care about rest . 
  germany . 
  but damn hulk saved the day . 
  umm ... congratulations to england !, 
  priaulx was fantastic today . 
  i had pretty high hopes on final split time but man he put my hopes in place by that finish . 
  i believe he took this roc personally as he wanted to take it for michael . 
  not finding excuses , he screwed up that final run , i 'm just saying . 
  he infact is , i would n't even be surprised if he has admitted that to himself . 
  anyways i still think he could 've performed way better even as number 2 driver . 
  he might be on point in some regards , but i seriously doubt any f1 driver thinks of their twitter/instagram/facebook / whatever social media account as a responsibility of promoting f1 as a whole . 
  they do it either because they simply like it , or because they want to promote themselves in first place . 
  i could n't care less about rlm .
