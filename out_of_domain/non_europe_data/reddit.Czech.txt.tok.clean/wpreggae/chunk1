yeah it does n't so far . 
  i 'm working on it . 
  unfortunately i do n't have 720p device and the moment i had to make screenshots on emulator i found out it 's completely fucked up :(, 
  [ 720p update released !, 
  ] ( http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/radio-rastafari/54c0792e-1ccb-4135-b68c-ccdd654e8d32 ), 
  thanks mate !, 
  thanks mate !, 
  hi , i ca n't really do anything about what 's played but i will surely add that checkbox in next update !, 
  ( will be released on monday , but it 's going to take a day or two to microsoft to certify it ), 
  thanks a lot for feedback !, 
  still interested ? 
  i 'd do that app, 
  ok , i 'll try my best to finish it till sunday !, 
  hi , thanks for feedback . 
  i 'll add that possibility to settings in next update for sure !, 
  just released an update , do n't know how long it 's gon na take to certify it tho . 
  hi , this actually looks like a nice challenge , although i 'm quite shitty at designing stuff . 
  could you provide more examples of app that `` look terrible '' and those with `` good ui '' so i could get inspired ? 
  all ama times should be adjusted to each user 's local time . 
  when you check the checkbox on particular event , you 'll be notified 30 minutes before that event takes place . 
  in setting you can chose to be notified 30 minutes before all events, 
  second slider is used to set notification for all events , weird it does n't work for you , personally i 've never run into problem with it . 
  i 'll wait for crash report from microsoft and hopefully will be able to solve this problem . 
  why does it have to be written in java ? 
  if c # is an option i 'd do it . 
  that is correct . 
  thanks a lot for feedback , hopefully l 'll be able to identify and remove that problem . 
  how about windows phone ? 
  ok , ca n't help you with that , sorry . 
  what platforms would you like the mobile app to run on ? 
  nah , you 're absolutely right . 
  the thing is i 'm a windows phone developer  ca n't help you with that then , sorry . 
  as a junior working on a legacy project i almost cried reading `` writing enormous ( more than 20 lines or so ) functions which the say they will refactor later , but do n't . 
  '' , i usually work with methods that exceed 2000 lines , seriously . 
  well , where i live razer is almost cheapest mechanical keyboard available , costs 1/2 a filco . 
  unfortunately no , there is n't . 
  czech republic . 
  i think mechanical keyboards has n't quite reach a decent popularity level here . 
  for reasonable price i could get razer , collermaster or steelseries . 
  as i wanted 10 key less steelseries was out and with razer i guess i 've made quite a rush choice but i do n't like the key layout on coolermaster very much so , i 'm quite happy after all . 
  i got the old black widow tournament edition which still has cherry blue switches . 
  yeah i know , but coolermaster has ten keyless with numeric block instead of the standard middle block . 
  at least those are available here . 
  hi , i do n't . 
  i of course saw all their products on their official web site . 
  the thing is the only one not-full available here is quickfire tk and as i mentioned earlier i do n't like that layout . 
  i would definitely buy quickfire rapid , unfortunately they sold them out like 2 months ago , and when i asked they replied with something like `` we do n't plan to sell this model anymore '' . 
  i do n't at all judge their product line based on the fact i do n't like tk . 
  i 'm convinced rapid would be much better choice than razer bw . 
  bit late but [ done ] ( http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=785228a0-7399-46c5-9e5b-326c63a7d8a9 ) . 
  i created it as an entry to [ #lowrezjam ] ( http://jams.gamejolt.io/lowrezjam2014 ) in which competitors had to make a game with maximum resolution of 32x32 pixels . 
  my entry is 40x24 up scaled to 800x480 , i only included 2 game modes so far , but if the game gets a little popular and i get some decent feedback on it , i will surely add more . 
  anyway i 'll be glad if you let me know how you like it , what 's good , what 's bad and so on . 
  cheers . 
  ( might not be available in your local store yet , i only checked us store . ), 
  hi , thanks a lot for feedback , i 'm glad you like it . 
  i 'll do my best to complete these requests asap . 
  hi , glad you like it . 
  well it lasts 4 seconds and after 2 it starts blinking slightly . 
  i thought it is enough but probably is n't as you 're not the first one mentioning this . 
  i 'll fix it asap . 
  thanks a lot for feedback , 
  well there should be i even thought i prevent that , will fix this today, 
  hmm i found a problem , when you activate screen lock or old your phone with ` start button ' on left side it 's inverted . 
  touche, 
  are you staying in hotels or something like that every / almost every night ? 
  i think 22km per day might be too much for someone who is on his ` first real hike ' and he also carries 10-15kg on his back . 
  back in the day when i was on my ` first real hike ' i 've had enough just after 3 days of that , even tho i was capable of 50 + km per day when ultra light . 
  on the other hand if you 're going to be more light-ish it should be ok . 
  it is . 
  exactly . 
  ** backpack ** : either [ deuter 42l ] ( http://8a.pl/upload/produkt_opcje_zoom/1.plecak-deuter-futura-pro-42_2.jpg ) or [ 65 +10 l ] ( http://www.trailblazeroutdoors.co.uk/images/product/air65.jpg ) deuter depends on how many stuff i have, 
  ** water ** : [ 3l deuter camel bag ] ( http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/41vgf1d-pel._sy300_.jpg ), 
  ** food ** : some kind of * spam * equivalent which we have where i live . 
  ** sleeping stuff ** : i have some no name 3 season sleeping bag which is all right . 
  usually i bring just [ tarp ] ( http://www.spacaky-eshop.cz/obrazky/vyrobky/3/373.jpg ) , because tent is way too heavy and does n't provide much of additional comfort , and i have some 30yo sleeping mat which is big but light and serves great !, 
  ** knife ** : [ mora 2000 ] ( http://www.lifeviewoutdoors.com/images/detailed/1/mora-of-sweden-mora-2000.jpg ), 
  ** head lamp ** : [ blackdiamond ] ( http://www.elitemountainsupplies.co.uk/images/productgallery/773o.jpg ) , do n't remember the exact type . 
  definitely internal , the only time i use external is , when there is only one ( light , but big . 
  usually sleeping mat ) thing that does n't fit inside and i 'd have to use my large backpack instead of smaller one just because of that . 
  pretty much this . 
  i work as . net developer so at work i use visual studio with vsvim extension installed , for other projects i usually use python in which case i use vim, 
  hahahahaha , priceless, 
  hi , cool photos !, 
  i live in czech not far away from there , never been on german side of the park tho . 
  on czech side there is quite a lot of asphalt roads which is annoying , i 've heard german side is much more beautiful than czech , any must see spots to recommend ? 
  this guy knows what 's up, 
  not fast enough, 
  what 's wrong with millwall ? 
  i do n't really know anything about the club i kinda like it in fifa, 
  way too much has changed since c # 3.0 , cheaper ai n't better mate . 
  there is already a lot of stuff in this thread so i 'm not gon na repeat that . 
  you mentioned a simple 2d game , the game jams such as [ this one ] ( http://www.ludumdare.com ) are great to participate in . 
  you can discuss everything with other devs on irc / watch streams of other devs and i find it good to have a ` deadline ' . 
  wait , java still does n't have auto properties ? 
  perhaps something about 35 miles as well . 
  lightweight i only had a jacket and camel back ( 3l refilled in half of the trip ) in my backpack . 
  my right foot hurt afterwards cause there was something wrong with my boots last 6-7 miles and i 've made a huge mistake not fixing it . 
  other than that i was pretty ok , day after i did n't feel a thing . 
  i guess i would be able to do around 45-50 miles per day , unfortunately i have n't find a right trail so far ( where i live there are just short trails usually , longer ones are not suitable for lightweight ) .
