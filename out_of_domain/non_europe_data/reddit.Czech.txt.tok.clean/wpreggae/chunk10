  i did drop from college when i had 1 year to go to become a programmer , even tho the company i work at is n't in the best shape right now i never regretted my decision , not even for a single second . 
  hiking makes me really happy , and beer .

  [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2wrhhq/nonenglish_speakers_of_reddit_what_do_you/cotjmq0 ), 
  femur , tibia and my wrist . 
  femur was by far the worst since i almost lost my leg and was n't able to walk for 3 years . 
  beer, 
  i got hit by a car , it was broken in a really bad spot and a lot of the bone was totally crushed . 
  also my body was n't really happy with fixation of the bone so there was a lot of infection and stuff going on . 
  then later ( after 3 months or so ) they had to switch to some sort of older way to deal with it which took about 6 months . 
  my femur was quite fine by that time ( i 've been walking without crutches for like 6 months i think ) but my tibia ( which was from the same injury ) turned out to be a problem . 
  my leg was turned inside from my knee by 10 \u00b0 or something like that , so they have to broke my leg and straight it which took about 9 months i think . 
  it 's been 13 years so i do n't really remember the exact times on each problem but yea , it 's been a long treatment, 
  i was going out with this girl and fell in love with her best friend ... 
  do n't ride the bike . 
  - i got hit by a car while riding a bike when i was 10 .
