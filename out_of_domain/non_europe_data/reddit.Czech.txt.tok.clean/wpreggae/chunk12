  yesterday it was clear skies and 27 \u00b0 c , right now it 's raining/snowing and 3 \u00b0 c. 
  lovely mountains , lovely spirits, 
  czech republic ( czechoslovakia back then ), 
  it 's 12:42 pm i 'm bored to death at work , totally unmotivated to do anything , i 'd rather be with my so somewhere far away from the city cause weather is so nice today, 
  use latest windows . 
  disregard the antivirus tax . 
  he played with them yesterday vs nip so i 'd say ... yes ? 
  well 2 days ago it was 27c and sunny here , yesterday it was 2c and snowing , today ti 's 10c and sunny . 
  something is fucky with the weather these days, 
  czech republic , it was quite hot ( well normal ~ 17c + ) lately , but last 3-4 days were really weird . 
  we experience weather like this a month ago where it was literally 5-6 times a day change between sunny summer day and a fucking blizzard , that was fucking crazy :d, 
  i 'm from usti nad labem , nothing to see here really although ceske svycarsko national park is quite close if you 're into nature stuff . 
  just to add to perspective here are webcam images from last 3 days .

  lad sure can hit the ball, 
  what , do you think that this is a wise answer to whether you should seeing someone or not ? 
  it 's like you 'd flip on coin on it ... you should rethink it on your own . 
  take a vacation for a few months , travel , then get back to different job , you will feel better ... at least that 's what most people say . 
  it 's called iphone, 
  harold and kumar go to white castle, 
  stoke 5:0 liverpool , oh god my sides, 
  i do n't think ballerin is anywhere near jenkinson quality defensively . 
  jenks also has better crosses , ballerin is definitely more of a winger,

  i might change a job , i really hope my current employer will let me go . 
  otherwise i 'd have to wait another 2 months, 
  i 'm just gon na get some i do n't want and later will be scammed for it anyway,

  the table consists of same values every time . 
  so for a ( small ) example if you have an array of 20 randomly sorted integers 1-20 and you need to get a number which is less than 10 . 
  if you get this number 7 times in a row you 're guaranteed that there are only 2 numbers left and unlucky streak is ahead . 
  yep , exactly, 
  thanks !, 
  who actually cares anymore ? 
  legion commander , obviously .

  volvo please, 
  it 's not way too fast , have you ever skied before ? 
  kek, 
  when you are about to crash at that speed to a car or a tree it does n't make too big of a difference if any at all .

  cocks out lads, 
  ouch, 
  although it completely killed my favourite hero ( batrider ) , made offlane void completely irrelevant , i kinda liked it . 
  was dirty troll picker while 6.84 lasted , now i love offlane shaker and ember being relevant again . 
  the problem is getting there, 
  as a former troll picker , it really is n't ... you can counter storm and lesh quite easily , troll is ( well was ) harder to deal with, 
  he 's like a new signing, 
  buff mask of madness , increase movements speed from 17 to 25 %, 
  idd , that 's complete bullshit, 
  so what 's the build now ? 
  [ this is what i was listening to while i cliked , kek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agdcf5efeb0 ), 
  also elder titan spirit, 
  that 's from north west of the czech republic, 
  nope , it 's not inspiration of morava , it 's inspiration of the other part of the czech republic it also contains same villages with some significant building being the same as well , there was a guy like 3 years ago from uk i think who made a trip here ( to czech ) and made photo to screenshot comparison . 
  i know because i live here ... in the exact part of the country by which chernarus is inspired, 
  could n't find the actual post , found only [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/y6zws ) album . 
  i do n't actually play the game so i ca n't say how relevant the pictures are to chernarus , but it 's from the correct region at least . 
  so are there no towers or have we literally gone back in time ? 
  this is actually exactly how the legacy code i used to maintain looks like, 
  sparklers ca n't melt steel beams, 
  especially steaks, 
  universe void . . even tho void is not played anymore that 's exactly where he is a level above everyone else, 
  i think the second option is the correct one , but then again , this is russia we are talking about,
