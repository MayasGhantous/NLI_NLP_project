  no problem mate, 
  mystic snake now has an unlimited bounces like a lich aghs ulti . 
  i know , right ? 
  oh god my sides, 
  rosters close in 2 days i think , week or two would be too late, 
  there is a browser extension which hides this subreddit while browsing frontpage or / r/all and shows it 's from / r/videos / r/wtf instead ... 
  based on your flair . . why ? 
  i 've had 74 % winrate with ld compared to previous 12 %, 
  although i think it 's just the matter of number of games played ld definitely benefits from storm not being in every second game as well as sniper/troll, 
  he said opposite , it 's already underwhelming as fuck, 
   removed lone druid bear . 
  bear is now replaced with dansgame memes . 
  \\  nice . 
  well faceless void is there ... 
  i really hope it 's gon na be more or less rework of doom/void/dp , i do n't think they will `` buff them back '', 
  more like rework imo, 
  faceless void - increased str gain by anything really ... 
  [ original 2560x1600 ] ( http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/gameplay_updates/686_teaser.jpg ), 
  nope, 
  do you too refresh the patch notes page like an animal ? 
  biblethump, 
  it appeared after a while for me , i was just messing with new hero / new items for like 15 minutes and then it arrived, 
  there is a lot of people who hate and a lot of people who love it , just like with every other drink ... 
  it 's supposed to be served either rum style - room temperature , or whiskey style - room temperature with ice . 
  it used to be made in my home town unfortunately few years back the company got bought and it 's not so good ever since . 
  how is secret going to be invited ? 
  they fucking lost everything since esl, 
  yea lets invite secret instead who won literally nothing since esl and got rekt by tier 4 teams recently, 
  cocks out, 
  wow , cuntish, 
  too accurate for sandpeople, 
  as a lone druid picker in 2k , can confirm : want to go offlane , everyone literally flames for doing so cause i 'm jungler and jungler only ... 
  # * savage *, 
  kek indeed, 
  i had a decent success with this build :, 
  start with double tangoes , ring of protection and stout shield . 
  build these into iron talon and poor mans shield , get power treads afterwards . 
  then go for vlads , start with morbid mask . 
  after vlads i usually go for yasha and blink dagger , after that i either complete manta if i need to get rid of silence or s&y . 
  in case i 'm doing really well i skip these and build daedalus . 
  then i just get aghs . 
  so my final build would be : treads , aghs , daedalus , vlads , s&y / manta/skadi , blink, 
  in past i used to play mom , battlefury void with 70 % winrate but i feel that just does n't work anymore ... with this new build i 'm currently 4:2 which is n't really useful in saying how relevant this is , but it 's still much better than the old way i feel, 
  druid former, 
  time walker ? 
  * sigh * i wish bulldog played on a team where the opponents are forced to ban other player as well, 
  vs who ? 
  his hero pool is n't that bad , i think he could play literally anything and still do better than loda on his best hero, 
  honestly , if he was n't a piece of cheating twat he is , nobody would care about this, 
  i 'd say ramsey over wilshere tbh, 
  magnificent, 
  hi , i live there , let me know if you 'd like some recommendations, 
  skytanic , pipeline fever , live and let dine, 
  i also need you to go buy sand , i dont know if they greade it , but ... coarse . 
  you can use literally any language your hosting supports ... 
  i 'd recommend python just because it does n't suck ... unlike php, 
  the inside looks quite shite tbh . . 
  i 'd look much better made of wood or something . 
  you should take a look at [ mvvm ] ( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848246.aspx ) patter which should be used to develop wpf apps . 
  bascially when you create some form ( view ) called formview.xaml ( . cs ) you then create separate class formviewmodel.cs which is used to store all the data used in the form . 
  then you should have some * repository * or * dataaccessobject * which is used to communicate with the database . 
  for a very simple example i 'm gon na have 1 form which is going to have a textbox and a button which saves entered word to database . 
  my project now contains formview.xaml which looks something like :, 
  formview.xaml.cs should stay as it 's generated so it only contains constructor which calls initializecomponent ( ), 
  your formviewmodel.cs will be something like this :, 
  private worddao dataaccessobject ; / / you should create instance of this in ctor, 
  private string _ word ;, 
  public string word, 
  get return _ word ;, 
  set, 
  _ word = value ;, 
  notifyofpropertychange ( ) ;, 
  public void submit ( ) / / this gets called when you click on the submit button ( there are several different approaches how to achieve this ), 
  dataaccessobject.save ( word ) ; / / save gets connection to database and saves the instance to appropriate table, 
  this approach keeps your views clean and different parts of the app nicely separated . 
  there are few nuget packages that help you with this , take a look at [ caliburnmicro ] ( http://caliburnmicro.com/ ) for instance . 
  drinking beer, 
  yea but if you interrupt chanelled spell with lone druid savage roar it would n't count , thanks volvo, 
  aaand the game does n't work, 
  gif of the red card incident ? 
  thanks, 
  i just ca n't fucking take this anymore, 
  because cb from a fucking villareal is what we bring in as a reinforcement apparently, 
  by a team from bottom part of the table which currently plays without 5 regular starters . 
  yep , checks out . 
  probably just a very small things, 
  this is just retarded , i 've interrupdet many pudge ults with lone druid savage roar and it did n't count , same with orchid ... 
  spain ? 
  i mean the 30s ? 
  yea , from reading the comments i kinda realized that , although there are still some people saying astral/euls counted for them ... 
  cunt, 
  ilya is love, 
  cocks out lads !, 
  no , absolutely not, 
  volvo has never done that in the history of dota ... 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's gon na be either nerfed somehow or completely reworked, 
  yes please, 
  introduce melee spells and do n't increase their cast range with aether lense , seriously pudge ult is fucking ridiculous with that item ... although there is so few spells like that it would probably be easier to just create exceptions for them, 
  arc warden replace third skill with hand of midas which gives 50/100/150 / 200 gold and 125/150/175 / 200 % exp kappa, 
  at least rtz can get out of the sprout .
