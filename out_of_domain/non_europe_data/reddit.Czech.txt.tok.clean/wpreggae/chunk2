  when going not-lightweight ( is there a word for this ? ), 
  while carrying everything i need for a multi-day hike on my back , i usually do like 15 miles per day . 
  i 'm kinda drunk for this right now , i live in usti nad labem ( north-west part of the country ) feel free to ama and i will answer your questions later . 
  hi , sure thing !, 
  hiking is a big hobby of mine so i know a lot of stuff about ceske svycarsko . 
  [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gfgyo ) are some low quality photos from there which i 've taken 2 or so years ago , and [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/6pyk2 ) is few more recent ones . 
  unfortunately quite a lot of ` trails ' in the park are covered by asphalt because back in the communist era they used that area to ` mine ' wood . 
  i 've heard that german side of the park is much more beautiful than czech , but czech side is more popular even for germans . 
  my region was highly industrialized back in the communist era . 
  it still kinda is but all the companies were brought to shit because of corruption which seems to be kind of national sport for politicians in here . 
  there are 2 big chemical plants and 1 power plant converted just to make a hot water for almost all city . 
  recently they build 2 quite big factories which make car parts bu i do n't really know how well is that going . 
  scenery is quite nice , my hometown is in the middle of ceske stredohori which is relatively small mountain range both are and elevation , but it 's always nice to walk not even 5 km away from quite a big city and suddenly be in nature . 
  it 's more complicated with culture there were 2 theaters in the city . 
  now i do n't really know proper words in english for this but one of them was like underground/alternative which i liked a lot and went there regularly but city council closed it simply because on of the actors did make fun of them in his monthly improvisations . 
  anyways all the actors and the rest of staff form new theater and they survive just on donations from people . 
  there are no big music festivals in this area which i do n't really mind as i prefer small ones which are quite good and quite often as well . 
  there are perhaps 2 bigger bands ( i mean like people know them outside the city ) , one plays punk the other reggae . 
  usual music styles on these small festivals are i guess jazz/blues/rock / punk/reggae . 
  sorry for my bad english , i just woke up and i guess it would n't be much better later as well . 
  if something does n't make sense or you want some more details about something just let me know . 
  have a nice day !, 
   it 's really hard for them to land a job or to find a landlord that will let them rent an apartment . 
  so they tend to aggregate in the same neighborhoods and it has a ghetto effect . 
  this all actually begun around 1980 when they brought them here from slovakia , and moved them to once beautiful parts of the cities . 
  there were more and more of them so people who lived there before moved out because their kids were bullied by them they stole their stuff and so on . 
  this created ` ghetto ' effect . 
  now-days stuff like it 's hard for them to find a job and such are just consequences of their life style for all the time they are here . 
  by age of 25 they have 5 kids and they already make shit ton of money and never have to work in their entire live . 
  ... aaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnd i just sound like a typical czech . 
   i feel they 're not given a chance anymore, 
  yep , you 're absolutely right here . 
  exactly i absolutely love it !, 
  you can get pretty much anywhere in czech by train within few hours and do an over-nighter or something . 
  i usually do stuff like this , i leave work on friday , board a train and go somewhere for a hike and i 'm back home on sunday evening , it 's amazing .

  i think it `` can not '' be called racism , there is a lot of asians and black people as well and nobody gives a damn about them cause they 're ok . 
  he 'll be right back !, 
  i made this while ago :, 
  1 . pick up an real world area, 
  2 . use google elevation api to get ... elevations of enough points, 
  3 . make 3d graph, 
  4 . play around with the results, 
  it 's very simple but i think fun project to do , i used it to ` simulate ' floodings . 
  i used python but i guess you can use just about anything, 
  fuck yes, 
  sweeeet, 
  how bout that !!!, 
  giroud trying to replicate sanogo failing the first 20 minutes and then he will strike !, 
  rosicky was solid yesterday, 
  i would never thought i 'm going to hear words exhausted and ramsey in the same sentence really , but yeah , he seems to be a bit off, 
  on the other side of the pitch, 
  yea i think a lot of people is just over-excited . 
  debuchy and chambers both look better than alexis atm . 
  they ai n't even in the squad mate, 
  right ? 
  no poldi or rosicky ? 
  comeon, 
  i usually walk 3 miles per hour while taking pictures enjoying just about everything i can and i do n't think the trails i hike are boring . 
  on boring parts i do like 3.7 miles per hour . 
  ideal pace of hiking does n't exists , it really depends on what you 're the most comfortable with . 
  for instance on a long hike like 35 miles etc. 
  with heavy backpack i move slower like 2 miles per hour , but i know that if i 'd moved this * slow * on a short & ultra light hike , i 'd be more tired than usual . 
  in la liga , whatever . 
  mspaint should do the trick, 
  the only thing missing is the `` yo coral '' in the beginning . 
  just tie one part higher and the other lower so it 's a little more steep . 
  1 ) get proper flashlight, 
  2 ) get proper backup battery with at least 10000 mah, 
  but seriously i think 5400 mah is enough for one/two day tops , especially when it gets cold . 
  i got that but still i would rather go for * proper * backup and for proper charger with higher capacity . 
  you ai n't in / r/funny, 
  train meets a repost, 
  is n't that walcott in between sagna and rvp ? 
  hope not . 
  mertesacker looks much better with armband , i 'd like even wilshere to have it instead of arteta even tho he 's a bit of * cunt * on the pitch, 
  http://steamcommunity.com/id/kulhajs , i 'm uk +1 but that should not be a problem, 
  that 's just retarded, 
  ye there are no as much obese people in any other country actually . 
  who the hell even is the guy goalkeeping for city right now ? 
  never heard of him, 
  [ right ?

  title spot on , just yet another repost . 
  [ here you go ] ( http://www.amazon.com/black-external-rechargeable-emergency-cellphone/dp/b00ispjt1a/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1407742028&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=power+bank+20000mah ), 
  edit : also never ever rely on any electronics , battery is not the only issue you might face . 
  just why does he keep saying how under strength man city squad was ? 
  we still were short of walcott , mertesacker and ozil , we fucking played monreal as a cb second half .

  i 've learned way more by myself , 2 years of college was just a complete waste of time . 
  i live in a country where education is free , which personally i think is kind of a problem cause there is a lot of * students * who are too busy to give a fuck about school and they are there just because they ca n't find a job etc. 
  so there is a lot of people dragging the quality and quantity of information down . 
  the biggest difference was that i studied the part of programming which i was the most interested atm first . 
  i was excited about it and i just loved to program . 
  there was a lot of stuff in college which i thought is completely pointless so i do n't need to know that and therefore can not be bothered to study . 
  later of course , when i stumbled upon some problem and found a solution i was surprised so many times that the solution is just the stuff i thought is useless . 
  the point is when someone tells you : `` remember this , you gon na need this '' , you simply wo n't believe him , but when you find out yourself ( or on stackoverflow probably ) that 's when you start really getting into it . 
  the only good stuff i learned in college was general oop approach which i found much easier to understand by speech than by reading it , but i guess that might be just totally different for someone else . 
  also i see you 're listing . net & php , mysql & mssql . 
  i 'd rather pick one and stick with it for the beginning , you do n't really need to know everything .
