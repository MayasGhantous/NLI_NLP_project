  the last one is just pure gold !, 
  finally something made my day worth waking up in the morning , thank you . 
  few months ago , after hours of debugging legacy code i found something like this in a function which caused the problem . 
  if ( foo.lenght < 8 ) / / !!, 
  bar ( ) ;, 
  if you 're over the age of 12 , you should be able to spell properly, 
  what a kroos , oh wait . 
  vim  all, 
  what ? 
  edit : oh i see now , problem was n't the typo ofc . 
  give me a minute , i 'm gon na try to find that code . 
  i do n't really remember . 
  edit : [ found it ] ( http://pastebin.com/xmatus6k ), 
  [ i made a windows phone app for that ] ( http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/ama-scheduler/50fb5fc9-a8a9-48fb-87e2-f5cd4900daa4?signin=true ), 
  i only imagine all the shit i 'd have to install on my computer and i want to vomit , so sorry but no . 
  also i would be very surprised if there would n't be one already . 
  [ * sigh * ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/post-35593-you-make-me-sad-gif-monty-pyth-vrmd.gif ), 
  yes !, 
  channel 2, 
  you 're da real mvp, 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqqiugqrmpc ), 
  pass and run forward , this is like fifa 101 come on mate, 
  champions league on tuesday , not completely fit yet . 
  wait , you mean he does n't read this ? 
  visual studio for c # , vim for d , python . 
  why not both ? 
  should be back in full training soon , but i guess ho wo n't play at least for next 6 weeks, 
  anyone got some more of that optimism ? 
  rosicky in for wilshere any time now . 
  omg no cazorla , the last thing we need is more fucking flicks, 
  pls pls pls, 
  wtf cazorla , wrong way dude, 
  i think you could use that pisser of cb in david luiz more than di maria tbh . 
  i 'm pretty sure he talked about skrtel, 
  united thinks so . 
  come on mate , nicky fucking bendtner scored vs spurs like after 2 seconds . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4-46ochjsc ), 
  he was only loaned . 
  i think he spent his prime on chelsea bench unfortunately . 
  not saying he 's bad , but could have been much better if he stayed in ` castle . 
  can cazorla hit a barn door ? 
  until they burn the stadium or something . 
  he kinda looks like that since the first pl game . 
  he did n't touch the player either , show me the rule saying you can not take a nap inside the penalty area . 
  finally, 
  ~ ~ it can not go to penalty kicks . 
  in case of draw , besiktas goes on . ~ ~, 
  oh , makes sense, 
  yea , i replied too fast before thinking . 
  i always follow these on / r/soccer cause the one in / r/gunners is obviously way too on-sided . 
  yea referee who was in charge of both cl and el final does n't have a guts to give a card/penalty . 
  this , please . 
  time for rosicky . 
  we 've scored 3 goals in 5 available stoppage times , are these ba minutes ? 
  exactly , would have been . 
  was n't . 
  get over it . 
  worse calls have been made in football . 
  our best signing this year by comfortable margin i think . 
  ^ so ^ far, 
  yea but then again , i can also imagine podolski coming on and scoring a hattrick . 
  added time betting thread . 
  7 min ? 
  mine too, 
  i do n't even have a dog, 
  oh , i actually was n't speaking about any particular event . 
  it was just a guess really . 
  di.fm - chiptunes , jungle , drum 'n bass , deep house, 
  [ done . 
  ] ( http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=7e094881-05e9-420e-8242-f696368abffe ) has been certified just now , might be available a bit later . 
  it 's free . 
  i spent literally more time launching visual studio and waiting for emulator to boot up so i could take the screenshots than i spent actually writing the app . 
  i 'm just glad that i could be helpful , 
  daaamn, 
  arsenal version : buy middle player , play him wide . 
  second assist . 
  ftfy, 
  wow, 
  cause that 's the correct pronunciation, 
  no , just old . 
  i mean , if he would be 27/28 etc. 
  he would still play ahead of curtois i think . 
  he 's past his best , still quiality keeper but there is no reason to play him ahead of curtois . 
  plot twist : it licked the vaseline of its legs and died . 
  lukaku to make it 2:2 in 90 ' anyone ? 
  you get to score , and you get to score , everybody gets to score !, 
  awesome tackle, 
  i think you wo n't be able to update this counter for at least another 3 months . 
  somebody recorded that ? 
  i need new sms ring tone . 
  what is this ? 
  la liga ? 
  on whole new cunt level . 
  this match in a nutshell : rodgers laughing at his players missing huge chances . 
  gim me some poldi, 
  i 'd get it if cazorla played wide instead of ozil , but like this it does n't really make any sense, 
  what ? 
  he played there literally once for us and he 's been great st for koln afaik . 
  how does everyone forget about diaby ? 
  deep somewhere i still believe he will score like 30 goals one season , cause i remember quite well how everyone including me trashed ramsey .
