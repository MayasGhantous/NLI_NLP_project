  sanogo can not get one good touch on a ball that 's true , but he always seems to be in the right place . 
  did you see the match from the start ? 
  chambers with the best of his mertesacker 's `` nein '' impression, 
  mertestriker, 
  someone has to show sanogo how it 's done . 
  considering only players that are fit i guess 7 ? 
  replace sanogo and cazorla + move ozil to mid ( these are 3 points to being 10/10 ), 
  it was shit against besiktas as well , not just today . 
  at least first half was , second half and the win in the end just made it look better , believe me . 
  podolski/wilshere/rosicky / cambell - enough ? 
  did you see our second match vs besiktas ? 
  i guess falcao to real and wnger go for benzema ? 
  damn dude , i feel so bad about having podolski on the bench :( take him back and let him score his goals . 
  cazorla fookin hoof it . 
  watching sanogo and cazorla physically hurts . 
  for a seconds i thought he 's gon na take sanchez off instead of sanogo . 
  i 'd literally die if he would have done so . 
  just hit podolski in the head please . 
  if we 're gon na play this 4-1-4-1 shit again i 'm going to vomit , also if we do n't get proper striker . 
  tl ; dr : i 'm going to vomit . 
  you are not the only one mate . 
  sanogo 1.1 , perhaps even worse, 
  you are not wrong, 
  exactly , after last season and where united finished it , we should be loaning sanogo to united , not buy their useless cunts . 
  perhaps they 've been obtained over time and just leaked all at once . 
  good . 
  we had sanogo and now we have 2 . 
  great . 
  nobody underrates him , he 's a useless tosser . 
  nothing . 
  i know how you feel , i get trolled every single transfer window . 
  we 've got sanchez while we needed cb and dm , great !, 
  yea , we had sanogo and now we have 2 .
