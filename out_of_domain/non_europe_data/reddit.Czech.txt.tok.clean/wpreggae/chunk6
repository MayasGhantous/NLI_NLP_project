  he 's pissed of cause the clothing, 
  god bless that shit diver, 
  itt : klopp 's hoody , homeless ref, 
  yea i thought so , i know he dresses like this for bundessliga but last year i think he still had to dress up for cl . 
  england five germany one !, 
  fuck wenger for sending jenko to fucking west ham and keeping this shaky do n't know what to do flop, 
  fuck wenger for letting jenko go and keeping this unproven flop who ca n't do anything , jenko would play his hearth out in game like this , ballerin just does n't know what to do and he does n't really give a fuck either, 
  next game : play ox , rosicky , cazorla , campbell as startes , no matter what . 
  drop ozil , arteta , ramsey , alexis . 
  never ever play ballerin in an important game again . 
  problem solved . 
  careless , losing way too many balls . 
  either way he has to stop dropping back for balls and just stay forward or he has to be dropped in favor of ox, 
  my favorite line up for next game would seriously be :, 
  ospina, 
  chambers - mertesacker - koscielny - monreal, 
  campbell - rosicky - ox, 
  welbeck ( maybe even poldi up front ), 
  we need something as different as possible atm . 
  also if wenger would n't make the biggest mistake of his career i 'd drop mertesacker in favor of chambers and play jenkinson on the rb , but you know , shit happens . 
  ballerin looked good ? 
  do you realize he is supposed to be rb ( right back ) . 
  the only time he looked * decent * was while going forward . 
  that lad is just another fucking winger of which we have plenty . 
  jenkinson is 1000x better defensively , he had to watch this with weirdest boner cause his beloved team lost but also he probably secured his place as future rb in arsenal . 
  please tell me how the hell did ballerin alright ? 
  do you realize he is supposed to be right back ? 
  the only time he was * decent * was while going forward . 
  defensively he is total rubbish , he has absolutely no clue what to do , his decision making might actually be slower than arteta 's . 
  jenkinson is much much better . 
  well yea , i know it 's not his fault he was playing . 
  but at least as a defender when you do n't know what to do just fucking hoof it , do n't do nothing . 
  which is what ballerin did like 3-4 times . 
  ospina, 
  chambers - mertesacker - koscielny - monreal, 
  wilshere ( diaby if injuried ) - ramsey, 
  campbell - rosicky - ox, 
  he should n't be on the pitch in the first place , horrible defensively , took him a year to decode what to do . 
  can not blame him tho , huge mistake to let him play . 
  d atm . 
  i 'm sooo glad i checked joindota when i got to work , man this was joy to watch, 
  have n't done much with it so far but i 'm loving it . 
  can not really compare performance wise stuff with c++ but it 's definitely pleasure to code in d compared to c++ . 
  it has a lot of neat stuff and as a full time c # developer i think i 'm gon na be slowly trying to smuggle some d stuff into my production . 
  was kinda expecting [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeezbfxebb8 ) soundtrack . 
  disappointed .

  mind games, 
  everything is corrupted as fuck yet nobody really seems to care, 
  good ol' slippero, 
  lukaku actually looks worse on the ball than sanogo does , i 'm impmressed, 
  what a fookin strike, 
  the only goal you twats scored was from dive free kick, 
  butthurt i guess, 
  he 's not even in cm, 
  oh i thought if was implying the speed , sorry . 
  wilshere is in arsenal since 2001, 
  but did all the players got a yellow ? 
  itt : people with cats who play fetch . 
  mine does as well . 
  surely, 
  still * can * score 60 goals in these 2 years tho, 
  [ or right after this moment ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zk5gsbi.jpg ), 
  because he got carried away with it , his initial plan was to get enough money for his treatment and for both kids college . 
  which is actually free where i live as well so ... 
  anybody knows why agbonlahor is n't playing ? 
  thanks, 
  which makes it even harder for such a young player back then to make it to the first team ... 
  get in you whiteheadcunt !, 
  exactly , what the fuck ?!, 
  this ref is abysmal . 
  alexis is absolutely fucking exhausted, 
  mind games, 
  szczesny asleep right there, 
  you are so bloody wrong you twat, 
  you probably do n't want to see my late game earthshaker build . 
  ^ ^ ^ battlefury , ^ ^ ^ deadlaus , ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ come ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ it ^ ^ ^ kills ^ ^ ^ people . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th9vcn6ukyq i think in this video is explained everything about c++ in games , why is it used so much and why is it wrong . 
  i checked like 5 times , it actually did a little . 
  this is me right now ... * looking for ` a ' key to upvote *, 
  [ hfw ] ( http://i1241.photobucket.com/albums/gg508/coolcoolcoolgifs/archer/bear-balls.gif ), 
  thanks for an advice , already solved the problem by not using iis at all , created console app and self hosted it . 
  works fine . 
  at the end the camera guy speaks czech to the other one `` are you * fucking * ok ?? '' . 
  just if anyone is wondering ... 
  thanks for the input , i will look into that . 
  right now i 'm just happy it 's somehow up and running . 
  brilliant, 
  i do n't remember having any browser window opened today . 
  well i had it like 1 app in iis that contained simple web page with api documentation ( the one generated by visual studio asp.net web api project , anonymous authentication ) , and the api itself with basic authentication . 
  not english , able to communicate with no problem after i get used to accents . 
  flamini/arteta on the wing confirmed . 
  58 % of americans need to take a chill pill .
