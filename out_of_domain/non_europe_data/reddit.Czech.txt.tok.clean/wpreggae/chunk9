  my life will never be the same after this . 
  shut up , shut the fuck up !, 
  yea , i sure do !, 
  i 've done quite a lot of hiking over last 2 years , although my standards for a good hike got quite higher lately so most of the times i just stayed at home . 
  yesterday i went for quite a short hike not far away from where i live and it was amazing !, 
  i was n't in such a great mood for a loooong time . 
  big black french press with a little sugar, 
  its 12:09 , i 'm at work , just got back from lunch so i 'm `` checking reddit real quick '', 
  wake up at 9 , arrive to work at 10 , leave work at 17 , get home at 18 then maybe hit the pub at 20 or play dota2 till tired enough to fall a sleep quickly . 
  well our company is in quite a weird position right now , management ca n't find any projects to work on so we 'll probably merge with our parent company within next month or two . 
  the morale is quite low nowadays . 
  anyways , yea hour or two , or the rest of the day it does n't really matter at this point .

  haha , yea i guess . 
  i used to use 2 teaspoons of sugar , then i went down to 1 . 
  nowadays i usually go with a very little sugar even tho i like coffee without sugar as well . 
  i still use fuck ton of sugar when it comes to tea . 
  `` i 'm tripping bear balls '', 
  solo hiking helps me a lot , i usually just * talk * to the nature . 
  i too , use english rather than my native language . 
  weird thing is i did n't even realize how much it helps until last weekend , i 've been quite stressed lately so i went for a hike after really long break because i always found some excuses why not to go and i feel great ever since . 
  oh yea , it totally is !, 
  i 'm lucky enough to live in a small country where kinda everything is surrounded by mountains or at least country side of some sort so it 's really easy to just get out of town and be in a completely different world in under a hour . 
  i absolutely love it !, 
  we do n't have 750ml bottles it 's either 500ml which would be 0,9 $ , or 1000ml which would be like 1,2 $ . 
  500ml of beer cost 0,4 $ , welcome to czech republic !, 
  izrael and palestine, 
  czech republic , not as nice as slovenia : /, 
  yea sure , i 'd just take the money and travel for a month . 
  based on where i live i 'd still have a shit load left over . 
  3 laws of robotics . 
  i met a girl after a long time , she 's really great we have a lot of common hobbies and stuff but i think i fucked up . 
  i think i 'd rather see all the messages someone started typing to me , but either did n't send or changed them completely . 
  freedom, 
  chrome ( including addons that i use ), 
  vlc, 
  well i had to use google for the last one , let 's call it a draw and be done with it , 
  second favorite might be onion flavor . 
  well one thing would be that my father left when i was 2 and i was raised entirely by my mother , second one might be when i got hit by car when i was 10 and had quite a lot of complications with the treatment which took 3 years to the stage when i was able to somehow walk by myself instead of usual 2-3 months , i 'm completely healthy by now ( for 4 years i 'd say ) , but still it affected my childhood quite a lot . 
  beef or deer goulash and beer, 
  my cat name is `` asha '' , the story behind this name is :, 
  friend of mine is a translator and he worked for a woman with a nickname asha , he 's quite a procrastinator and the thing she needed translated was quite difficult so he missed several dead lines she gave him . 
  the main problem was she paid him up front so she gave criminal complaint against him . 
  he then returned the money and everything was fine . 
  i thought it would be quite a banter to name my cat after this girl . 
  that 's my secret , i reddit all the time . 
  female , but i think the cat would have gotten the same name even tho it would be male , i mean the cat for sure does n't care , right ? 
  so what is the context of this please ? 
  i 'm going on a date tomorrow , hope to repeat it during the weekend . 
  i 'll probably go for a hike , play some dota and drink some beer as well . 
  have fun my glorious pcmr friends !, 
  time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time . 
  beer,
