and estonian . 
  be sure to have a happy reddit birthday !, 
  do n't just spend it on strangers on the internet though !, 
  they seem to get a lot of hate for some reason , but at least i think that their first album is really great . 
  the middle part of spiritual healing by death , with the organ-like guitar ( i think ? ), 
  and the solos . 
  rob halford also sounds like he has a huge vocal range . 
  e : oh , and how could i have forgotten king diamond !, 
  so ummm ... you 'll like travincal and durance ? 
  edit : seems like what i meant was n't clear . 
  what i mean is that travi and durance are great , but everything else blows . 
  the first time i watched it , i fell asleep about halfway into the film . 
  the second time i watched it , i really loved it . 
  ( but i 'm a big kubrick fanboy so take that as you will ), 
  your musical compatibility with shamedm is super, 
  music you have in common includes death , judas priest , overkill , annihilator and mercyful fate . 
  if you like mercyful fate , you should definitely look into king diamond . 
  ` abigail ' and ` them ' are probably the best ones to get . 
  for thrash , ` eternal nightmare ' by vio-lence is great , or something by razor , like ` shotgun justice ' . 
  my last.fm name is the same as here btw , 
  [ jesus saves . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wxpet9lwpc ), 
  niiice . 
  i 've only got the single and it obviously is n't signed . 
  [ delivered !, 
  first tried using [ tineye ] ( http://www.tineye.com ) , but got no results . 
  a low-res version was the main picture of [ gaga 's page on last.fm ] ( http://www.last.fm/music/lady+gaga ) ( i 'm also on last.fm with the same name as i 'm here in case any of momma 's fans want to add me ), 
  found a link to the high-res version in the comments of that picture . 
  got lucky since i was also searching for it for ... research . 
  yes , research . 
  the second half of the queen is just amazing . 
  going to do this the classical way - by turning on shuffle and letting it pick from my library, 
  # 1 - metallica - phantom lord, 
  # 2 - annihilator - schizos ( are never alone ), 
  # 3 - black flag - rise above, 
  # 4 - electric wizard - another perfect day ? 
  # 5 - mercyful fate - the unvinvited guest, 
  # 6 - slayer - catatonic, 
  # 7 - municipal waste - a.d.d. 
  ( attention deficit destroyer ), 
  # 8 - absu - of the dead who never rest in their tombs are the attendance of familiar spirits, 
  # 10 - king diamond - them, 
  a disco stick ( that lights up when you upvote ) would be pretty cool !, 
  i had a friend who did the same thing with a floppy disk . 
  `` yeah , no problem man , i can loan it to you , this game that i installed from two cds fits perfectly on this floppy ! '', 
  i hope i 'm not the only one who read the title in the heavy 's voice ... 
  somebody used the `` big head mode '' cheat again ... 
  kyuss - blues for the red sun, 
  black sabbath - paranoid, 
  metallica - ... and justice for all, 
  lady gaga - the fame monster, 
  judas priest - screaming for vengeance, 
  came here to check for him ( and cliff burton ), 
  [ part 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lui2ydn_l3q ), 
  [ part 3 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek4edn85p4e ), 
  that 's not funny ; my brother died that way !, 
  please . 
  mostly asshole , friends . 
  [ ftfy ], 
  you 're missing kyuss . 
  going by [ my last.fm play count ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead/ ), 
  17 - hair, 
  16 - marry the night, 
  15 - schei\u00dfe - i prefer the mugler remix to the original, 
  14 - the edge of glory - great album closer , not a fan of it otherwise . 
  well , besides the amazing piano live version ( s ), 
  13 - yo\u00fc and i - i liked the piano version a lot more on this one too . 
  12 - fashion of his love, 
  11 - the queen - the first half is okay , but the second half is so good . 
  10 - born this way, 
  9 - highway unicorn ( road to love ), 
  8 - bad kids, 
  7 - judas, 
  everything from here on is really , really good in my opinion, 
  6 - government hooker, 
  5 - electric chapel, 
  4 - americano, 
  3 - black jesuss \u2020 amen fashion, 
  2 - heavy metal lover, 
  1 - bloody mary, 
  hair has 18 plays versus 51 plays of bloody mary , so far . 
  what usually happens is that i play the album from start ( or starting from government hooker ) and then repeat some song a couple of times . 
  i like the songs more and more each listen . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuddno7_rmw ), 
  it 's over . 
  the intro to schei\u00dfe as an intro , a bit of born this way on the piano and a performance of the edge of glory . 
  i 'll be sure to post a youtube link once one appears ( unless somebody gets to that first ), 
  edit :, 
  already up on youtube !, 
  `` i 'm sorry dave , i 'm afraid i ca n't do that . '', 
  estonia , j\u00fcri . 
  4:25 pm , summer vacation , ~ ~ masturbating ~ ~ redditing, 
  just installed bf2 today , since i got so psyched for bf3 thanks to all the e3 videos . 
  played for a bit and it has not dated well at all , at least for me . 
  and so i downloaded project reality , since i heard that was good . 
  played a bit , seems pretty interesting !, 
  i 'm definitely interested in playing ( i 'm located in europe though , so that may make it more difficult to play together ), 
  i do n't live on my own , so i ca n't really get rid of all the sugar/other temptations in my home . 
  i doubt a few gummi bears are going to do much to you , 
  good luck to you too !,
