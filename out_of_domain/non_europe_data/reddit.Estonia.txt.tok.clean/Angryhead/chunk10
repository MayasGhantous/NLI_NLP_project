  ** chance the rapper - acid rap ** - also some great summery tracks , but you 've probably heard a shitton of it already ... '' 'cause everybody dies in the summer . '', 
  ** mr. muthafuckin ' exquire - kismet ** - listened through it once , buuut that was the day it came out and i do n't really remember all that much about it . 
  guess i 'll give it another listen sometime soon . 
  my first exposure to this dude though . 
  big k.r.i.t. 
  - k.r.i.t. 
  wuz here, 
  co-signing this dude . 
  seriously underrated , even amongst his fans it seems like this got looked over . 
  some super-emotional stuff like [ ` king cotton ' . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbgw4axw8bi ), 
   gold house - the beats are fuckin nuts on this . 
  yes !, 
  this shit gets me more pumped up than flocka ever has , and i 've listened to a bunch of waka !, 
  the first five songs are such an endless barrage of energetic anthems . 
  1 ) [ green card ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wvs_w1vkai ) - such a crazy fucking start, 
  2 ) [ basedgod strugglin ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj7hnqky3_i ) - go fucking nuts, 
  3 ) [ i 'm like killah ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iws7wn78una ) - fucking heavy, 
  4 ) [ i 'm like killah ( remix ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yf5dud1sx4 ) - the original and the remix back-to-back ? 
  you already know . 
  5 ) [ all i have ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwmanrjddpy ) - fucking scarface sample man, 
  oh and definitely check out the ` trapped in basedworld ' tape if you like these , it 's a much more consistent release imo , all pretty great . 
   the basedprint 2, 
  serious stuff , got some real legit great stuff imo like [ ` where the game began ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz9s2xgc1vm ), 
   6 kiss, 
  [ i 'll link to this danny brown tweet every damn chance i get . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/xdannyxbrownx/status/297353903740182528 ), 
  juicy j always brings a great verse . 
  the vinyl of it i got , for example , does n't have the intro song and the `` rant '' at the beginning of the third track/skit , [ ` graduation day ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm8uvzy-32c ) is missing , though the instrumental still plays . 
  only kinda related , but hey ... 
  if you get him to do a show in estonia i 'll be forever grateful fam . 
  haha yeah . 
  i do n't post much in the main rap thread ( i do * not * want to take part in/cause all the dumb off-the-rails discussions there ) but i do lurk . 
  if you like this side of lil b , be sure to check out the ` trapped in basedworld ' mixtape ... but i 'm just going to paste a part of another post of mine to you ( talking about his ` gold house ' mixtape ) :, 
  yes !, 
  this shit gets me more pumped up than flocka ever has , and i 've listened to a bunch of waka !, 
  the first five songs are such an endless barrage of energetic anthems .

  yeah i 'm not going to argue on that . 
  lil b goes ham on that track . 
  my most played track from him , most def . 
  i think he nailed it , i totally agree with him this time . 
  takes me way back , trying to cop unreal tournament 2003 on imesh , but always getting max payne instead . 
  max payne owns , but it sure pissed me of that i never could get that ut ... 
  and i shopped it !, 
  teamwork , yaaaay !, 
  the other 2 solo ferg songs on the `` lord $ never worry '' mixtape are great too . 
  [ bangin ' on waxx ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uclfhjacbag ), 
  [ choppas on deck ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyf0f-_cx0q ), 
  ca n't wait for ferg 's album/mixtape/whatever . 
  ** user : [ angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ) **, 
  ** death grips - the money store/exmilitary/no love deep web ** : it 's summertime and a lot of fun events with friends have been going on recently ... which means hangovers . 
  and for some fucking reason , i really like listening to harsh music just after waking up from a too short of a sleep , while your head might be hurting and shit . 
  dope stuff . 
  trying to get my friends into them too ... one homegirl is into it , 
  ** the diplomats - volume 1 ** :, 
  confession : i 've never listened to dipset before , so i copped this mixtape and it 's pretty nice . 
  got to the fifth track ( ja rule - `` dial m for murda ( remix feat . 
  cam ` ron ) '' - sorry , could n't find it on youtube . 
  just listen to the original and imagine that there 's a cam verse at the end ! ), 
  and did n't really get past it - it just went on repeat since i reaaaally dug it . 
  ** run the jewels - run the jewels ** :, 
  never listened to el-p or killer mike before , but this is fire . 
  definitely recommended . 
  ** deniro farrar - the patriarch ** :, 
  i 've just been listening to [ `` days go by '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlro5lwfweu ) on repeat , since it 's so good . 
  ** giant bomb - the giant bombcast ** :, 
  goat hip-hop album !!!!!, 
  nah it 's a great podcast about ~ vidya games ~ but mostly just dumb stuff . 
  jeff does drop some knowledge about hip-hop pretty often though . 
  this is the album that got me into lil b. 
  a `` serious '' album by him , fire-ass beats from the likes of clams casino . 
  if you still have n't given him a ( real ) chance , get this ( and ' 6 kiss ' and ` white flame ' and ` god 's father ' and ... ), 
  ** lil b - bitch mob : respect da bitch : volume 1 ** :, 
  and i 've also been listening to this ignant classic from the based god . 
  choice cuts : [ `` salute to the bitch '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ljoabhpldu ) & [ `` shake ya booty '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6sn88y2ewi ), 
  damn it . 
  i did make one , i just did n't link it like the idiot i am . 
  thanks for looking out fam !, 
  just to finish the collection :, 
  [ red flame : devil music edition ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dbtzrxs.jpg ), 
  [ `` based god . 
  '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1hgnhk/i_am_snoop_lion_back_again_ask_me_anything_pt_2/cau6kv1 ), 
  awesome !, 
  i actually really enjoyed load ... reload was garbage though . 
  real appropriate wee-bey flair too . 
  [ here you go . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ducmst7hmi0 ), 
  it 's hilarious . 
  just wanted to chime and say that the `` roller '' game is pretty fun and i hope that you continue working on it !, 
  that song has insane bass . 
  eat 'em like cookies , chips ahoy !, 
  [ you 're off by like a day bruh .
