  trap house , chicken talk , the state vs. radric davis , mr. 
  zone 6 , trap back , ferrari boyz ( with waka ), 
  these should keep you entertained for a while . 
  i 'd start at the beginning .

   [ `` i think it 's safe to say that lil b 's 6kiss album is a classic ... 
  listening to it realizing how many trends bruh bruh started '' ] ( https://twitter.com/xdannyxbrownx/status/297353903740182528 ), 
  i really liked [ `` my hoes they do drugs '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppmrrbpyjik ) off `` drilluminati '' ( great name ) ... but i could n't really get into the rest of the tape . 
  might just be the juicy j and pusha-t verses . 
  season 2 did n't do that much for me on first viewing , but it 's generally agreed upon that it 's really good on a rewatch , and i can confirm that . 
  season 4 of the wire is the tv goat , hands down . 
  if you get to meet him , tell him there 's mad love for him in estonia . 
  well , at least from me . 
  and from some other dude i found on last.fm . 
  ^ i ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ ^ want ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ lil ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ b ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ show, 
  [ larry bird ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3i5ndcw8c0 ), 
  [ `` 05 fuck em '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/covlonq.jpg ) is a pretty great album cover . 
  shouts out to [ trae tha truth - `` i 'm fresh '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mntbot5gh4 ) sampling electric wizard . 
  it 's fucking awesome . 
  wait are you me/am i you ? 
  i actually did the same thing , asked yung god for the `` ginseng strip '' instrumental , but on twitter . 
  his answer was , sadly , also , and i quote : `` naaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh '' . 
  be sure to post that joint then, 
  this might have been for some other rapper my favourite is :,

  [ ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ the ^ ^ lil ^ ^ wayne ^ ^ version ^ ^ is ^ ^ really ^ ^ good ^ ^ though ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfmfh0qaxd4 ), 
  czarface is a great project and it 's a shame it seemingly got overlooked by a lot of people . 
  i 'm super hyped that [ czarface 2 already got confirmed by 7l . 
  [ here 's mine . 
  [ and one for plays by artist , since it kinda gives a better overview . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5yydopt.jpg ) ( no lil b or wayne in the album one , for example , even though i listened to a lot ), 
  and my last.fm account : [ angryhead ] ( http://last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  the last.fm servers shit themselves some time during this month which is why some of my plays are kinda fucked . 
  i definitely did * not * listen to * that * much ** gunplay - 601 & snort ** , but `` bible on the dash '' probably got a couple dozen listens . 
  anything else by him ( besides cartoons & cereals of course ) is kinda meh , too bad . 
  ** run the jewels - run the jewels ** bangs . 
  a solid 8/10 from me , with only two songs i do n't care for . 
  ** metal fingers - special herbs ** is great instrumental stuff ( ca n't program all that well when listening to stuff with lyrics ), 
  ** lil ugly mane - mista thug isolation ** - saddened by the news of him only dropping one more project as lum , which made me listen to this again . 
  still dope . 
  ** freddie gibbs - baby face killa ** - gangsta gibbs is definitely one of the best in the game right now . 
  `` bfk '' , `` the hard '' , `` bout it bout it '' are all great . 
  i feel like ** czarface - czarface ** got overlooked by a lot of people . 
  hella sweet wu-tang clan worship . 
  ** gucci mane - burrprint ( 2 ) hd ** - [ that fucking intro is so raw , damn !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi1q6cpzjdg ), 
  ** curren $ y - new jet city ** - i basically only listen to `` sixten switches '' , `` three 60 '' and `` bitch get up '' from this but they all still own . 
  ** the jet age of tomorrow - the jellyfish mentality ** - lovely electronic music with occasional rapping from the of click . 
  i also listened to a bunch of non-hip-hop instrumental stuff ( good background music for programming ) . 
  shouts out to ** mosh - monarchy ** , the dude behind it posted some story to hhh which is how i found it . 
  dope dark electronics . 
  if you like stoner rock , definitely check out ** slo burn - amusing the amazing ** . 
  one of the stoner goat albums , shame they only put out one ep . 
  fronted by john garcia ( kyuss 's singer ), 
  just a great instrumental soundtrack for one of the goats man . 
  so you can * murdahmurdahmurdah * all those monsters .

  [ i think he 's talking about the `` cheat sheet '' from this thread . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1dy9wj/im_a_cpa_who_learned_java_android_and_published/ ), 
  [ casey veggies got a picture with yeezy on his instagram . 
  ] ( http://instagram.com/p/cf6kvwydq3/ ), 
  happy for him , can definitely hear the influence in his stuff ( and his voice sounds eerily like kanye 's at times ), 
  i wish we got ( foregin ) hip-hop shows in estonia . 
  have a few decent local songs instead , first two are old-school classics and the third is a bit newer ... and they all feature the same dude , which shows how much i know about the local scene/how crappy it is :,

  [ the pitchfork selector freestyle is absolutely hilarious too ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwbnm24yne&amp;t=5m ) ( starts at the 5 minute mark in case the link does n't work ), 
  could n't find the full album on youtube so i uploaded it myself . 
  around 16 to 20 years old , if wikipedia is to be believed . 
  i love a good bike ride . 
  bought a stationary bike last december and rode on that a ton during the winter and spring , made my legs look a lot better and i definitely feel it while squatting , for example . 
  played volleyball on the sand with friends from high school for about five hours yesterday , next to a river , tons of fun . 
  feeling it a bit today though , haha . 
  requesting [ s'gucci saturdays ] ^ ^ only ^ ^ half ^ ^ jokingly, 
  any chance you could upload those as files somewhere too ? 
  need those last.fm scrobbles mane !, 
  they 're all albums , so you 'll have to pay for them ^ ^ or ^ ^ pirate ^ ^ them . 
  `` i 'm thraxx '' , `` 6 kiss '' and `` angels exodus '' respectively . 
  `` 6 kiss '' is a contender for goat lil b imo , so definitely cop that . 
  the other two are good too . 
  same here . 
  but i 've definitely listened to some individual songs off it more than a couple of times - `` a zilli '' , `` a place 4 everything '' and `` i 'm bout my dollas '' ( later retitled as `` live online '' are all great , for example . 
  `` special herbs '' is pretty great music to do some programming to . 
  i tried to watch riddick a couple of weeks back . 
  could n't take it seriously at all since riddick 's glasses reminded me of this fucking picture too much . 
  probably one of my favourite pictures on the internet overall . 
  and you even tagged them properly !, 
  big thanks !,

  user : [ angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  ** lil b - god 's father ** - you already know . 
  as lil b himself would say , `` classics '' . 
  especially [ `` i own swag '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zja6fb5crk ) . 
  ** lil ugly mane - three sided tape volume one ** - ugly mane is great and i really hope he decides to * not * go through with his decision to stop rapping . 
  great stuff , although mostly instrumental . 
  ** lil b - white flame ** - still the goat lil b mixtape by my standards . 
  [ `` i 'm fabio '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp_x0nzsuwg ) has * the * greatest hook .
