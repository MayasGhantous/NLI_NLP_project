  ** lil b - i 'm thraxx ** - confession : had n't really listened to this before . 
  listened through it once and it was pretty great . 
  no `` 6 kiss '' though . 
  ** sons of kyuss - demos ** - raw stoner rock from 1990 from the band that later became kyuss ( and also split off into a dozen other projects , including qotsa ) . 
  great summer music . 
  [ i uploaded it to youtube in case you 'd like to give it a go . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urlenvi8ohk ), 
  ** gucci mane - str8 drop presents gucci mane la flare ** - old , pre - `` trap house '' gucci , apparently at least partly all the way back from 2001 . 
  very enjoyable if you like older gucci . 
  [ check out `` 12 '' for an example . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvtumox3ahc ), 
  ** lil b - illusions of grandeur 2 ** - another lil b project i only listened through once back when it came out and gave it another playthrough this week . 
  it was alright , but no real standouts . 
  ** slayer - undisputed attitude ** - metal covers of punk songs . 
  quite underrated amongst slayer 's discography in my opinion . 
  ** karma to burn - appalachian incantation ** - more stoner rock for the summer . 
  great instrumental stuff . 
  haha , yeah , been on a kick lately ( or for the last 3 years i suppose ... ), 
  was walking home from the store yesterday , thinking my thoughts and thought about how listening to lil b always cheers me up which is why i love him/his music so much , unironically . 
  current favourite positive joint : [ life 's hard . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfc6fvnle_i ), 
  oh and the first five tracks off gold house and/or the entire trapped in basedworld mixtape is the best wake-up-in-the-morning-still-kinda-drunk-or-maybe-hungover music . 
  well that and death grips . 
  aggressive music is the best kind of music for my hangovers . 
  6 kiss and white flame , imho . 
  possibly i 'm gay too , but that one really only has `` serious '' songs ( and is pretty short compared to the other projects ), 
  it 's ( probably ) ripped off soundcloud so it ca n't really be more than 128 kbps . 
  track : [ kyuss - spaceship landing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snprsmnhsfw ), 
  album : wu tang clan vs. 
  the beatles - enter the magical mystery chambers, 
   you bitch , you swim !, 
  bitch , you swim . 
  you swim . 
  i dig swimming but i 'm more of a biking-in-the-morning-guy . 
  the new trinidad mixtape , some random gucci songs ( `` confused feat . 
  future '' off `` lean '' is awesome ) , some random lil b songs and the thuggin ep by gibbs & madlib . 
  same here , lil b not following me and craving gta v. 
  [ any uk/european fam looking to get a console for gta v should probably look into this deal .

  tlou is an amazing game too . 
  `` confused '' is about to become a hood classic , that song is fucking awesome . 
  i can never get used to a remix once i 've already heard the original ( well , more than a few times ), 
  the verses just always sound ... off . 
  user : [ angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  ** lil ugly mane - three sided tape volume two ** - lil ugly mane still owns , cop it . 
  ca n't remember much about it other than it being more of the same . 
  ** a$ ap ferg - trap lord ** - i 've been loving ferg 's tracks since the `` lords do n't worry '' mixtape , so i had high hopes but was not disappointed . 
  `` shabba '' , `` hood pope '' , `` murda something '' , `` cocaine castle '' ... a ton of bangers and quite a bit of variety on this !, 
  ** gucci mane - lean ** - ahh , gucci ... he might be kind of a piece of shit as a human but i ca n't help but love his music . 
  probably best of the `` world war 3 '' series albums . 
  `` confused '' with future is the stand-out track on this for sure , if you only want to listen to a single track . 
  ** gucci mane - gas ** - listened through it once and yeah , also pretty good . 
  the first track , `` one minute '' seemed pretty good since it was different from the usual gucci beat . 
  ** a$ ap rocky - live love a$ ap ** - as requested by my friend to be listened to while playing motherfucking crash team racing . 
  i did not object . 
  ** earl sweatshirt - doris ** - i really liked `` earl '' back in the day . 
  i tho ught it was good , i 'll try to give it another listen soon ... so much new music , not enough time !, 
  `` burgundy '' was the track i did repeat a couple of times though , love it . 
  ** floor - floor ** - rad fucking stoner rock . 
  ** big k.r.i.t. 
  - king remembered in time ** - not my favourite k.r.i.t. 
  release , but his best since `` return of 4eva imho . 
  also requested by my friend for ctr . 
  ** emika - dva ** - electronic stuff with lovely female vocals . 
  i liked the first , self-titled album more though . 
  i also obviously listened to the third gucci tape , ** molly ** , but it was n't long enough to make the list . 
  it 's also alright . 
  and trinidad jame $ 's ** 10 pc . 
  mild ** . 
  was not into the first tape , besides the two singles , but this one seemed a lot better . 
  `` quez '' seemed like the standout track on first listen , although gucci and gambino being on the same track on `` ea $ tside '' is also pretty funny imo . 
  oh and i also listened to a bunch of lil b obviously ( second most played in the last 7 days , after gucci ) , but a lot of different projects of his so they did n't make the cut . 
  i should probably try the captain murphy album since the other stuff seems to align pretty well ... 
  those french whalesavers are pretty damn great . 
  i have n't listened to them a whole lot but i enjoyed `` from mars to sirius '' and saw them live in 2010 , supporting metallica . 
  rad stuff .

  mommy and daddy , please stop fighting ;(, 
  [ i ca n't take anything seriously once i see this dude . 
  pretty great freestyle though , loved ferg 's verse / `` control '' response . 
  do n't forget the trap god 's `` world war 3 '' series !, 
  been playing ( beach ) volleyball with friends a lot this summer . 
  hopefully it 'll last once the summer is over ( too soon , weather 's already pretty shitty in estonia ) , luckily we 've already been looking into being able to play indoors . 
  probably in the high school gym we all used to go to . 
  i like to play something that does n't require much reading while first listening to an album , so i can tune out the game and focus on the music . 
  spelunky is my choice currently , binding of isaac and just cause 2 are also great . 
  but while programming , i 'll try to listen to instrumental/electronic stuff with not a lot of vocals - nin 's `` ghosts '' and reznor 's soundtrack work , daft punk , [ hhh 's own mosh ] ( http://iammosh.bandcamp.com/album/monarchy ) , metal fingers , various other soundtracks and so on . 
  this is n't exactly what you asked for , but here 's some stuff in estonian !, 
  first two are old-school classics and the three others are newish ... and the first 3 all feature the same dude , which shows how much i know about the local scene/how crappy it is :,
