  when you 've only got room for about a hundred you learn to recognize them by the first second ( s ) * real * quick . 
  haha , i never knew `` i 'm the devil '' was `` i 'm god '' reversed . 
  dope . 
  that song is incredibly catchy . 
  * ooh-ooh , lem me sing my song *, 
  * if you feel this shit , ^ mothafucka ^ ^ sing ^ ^ ^ along ... *, 
  i really like the beginning of the underachievers ' `` indigioism '' mixtape , [ philantrophist . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkr5ofr3k34 ), 
  no silence , straight to the point . 
  drama 's intro on `` type of way '' is hilarious . 
  user : [ angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  not a lot of hip-hop this past week , apparently , or just from different albums . 
  ** lil ' wayne - dedication 5 ** - pretty damn good . 
  only one listen and repeats of a few songs so far , but it came out like 8 hours ago so i 'll definitely be listening to some more . 
  `` bitch do n't kill my vibe '' , `` type of way '' , `` pure colombia '' and especially `` you song '' ( more chance & weezy together please ! ), 
  are the standouts to me . 
  ** badbadnotgood - bbng ** - very enjoyable hip-hoppy/jazzy instrumental stuff to throw on while working . 
  i still hate the name of the band though , so goddamn hipstery ... 
  ** spaceghostpurrp - the chronicles of spaceghostpurrp ** - been meaning to get into his stuff more and this was pretty great . 
  repeated `` the black god '' a couple of times . 
  ** death grips - exmilitary ** - had to listen to this again since a friend was talking shit about this release , which is their best work imo . 
  most hip-hoppy i guess , which might be why i like it the most . 
  other stuff : a bunch of instrumental stuff while programming or trying to really read stuff on the ` net . 
  the ** command & conquer soundtrack ** is a classic and brings back a ton of memories for me . 
  ** tron legacy ** was a terrible movie imo ( besides looking pretty stylish ) but the soundtrack is obviously awesome , since it 's by ** daft punk ! ** . 
  ** dredd ** and ** drokk ** , both are great instrumental albums , very different takes on kinda the same thing . 
  and finally , ** scream bloody gore ** by ** death ** . 
  shuffling by albums kept bringing this up and it still has some great cuts , even though it gets overshadowed by pretty much all their other albums imo . 
  any other hhh-ers fucking with death / older death metal in general ? 
  i really liked all quiet on the western front , the picture of dorian gray and slaughterhouse five . 
  i mean , `` zombie ritual '' is one of their best songs but i 'm not that big on the album overall . 
  too samey to my ears , i guess i like the proggy stuff more . 
  have n't listened to many other osdm bands , sadly . 
  my years of listening to metal were like 50 % thrash ( all the bigger and smaller names from the 80s , you can check my profile out if you want to ) , 20 % `` classic '' ( you know the classics ) , 10 % death ( death and cannibal corpse and maybe something else occasionally ) , 10 % black ( darkthrone & well , dimmu ) and 10 % doom/sludge ( electric wizard , mastodon ) . 
  `` confused '' is so damn good . 
  i keep hearing future saying `` uncle phil '' instead of `` i 'm confused '' in the background during the hook though , makes me laugh ^ while ^ also ^ slowly ^ driving ^ me ^ crazy, 
  i was glad to see that it also shot to the top of the gucci last.fm charts ( well , no . 
  2 after lemonade obviously ), 
  the word for `` puppy '' in estonian is `` kutsikas '' so when i get a dog i 'm gon na name him `` guccikas '' . 
  we did this to a friend 's sister ( well , she was rollerskating , big difference ) and it was hilarious/awesome . 
  snuck up on her with the car and just blasted it . 
  `` i slap and i suck clits / i fuck in my church shoes, 
  humblest guy in the room / and i am in the room too ( get it ? ) '',

  game of the generation for me mos def . 
  ca n't wait for the second one . 
  [ got some huge spikes . 
  `` might as well sell a bell , what the hell ^ oo-ooh, 
  i 'm just a nigga with a fucking scale , trying to stay outta jail ^ oo-ooh '', 
  his brother is retweeting gucci 's tweets and then later saying gucci got hacked ? 
  he 's just trying to save his face . 
  [ @guccidointhings ] ( https://twitter.com/guccidointhings ) has some pretty great ones , but has n't been updated in a while . 
  sendspace is so god damn slow , ca n't vouch for this for like another hour . 
  big ups to guwop though . 
  i dunno , i did n't mess with the settings , just used the defaults . 
  metal fingers is * the * shit for programming . 
  you better be willing to ship it internationally !, 
  hell , i 'll pay for the shipping if needed . 
  [ 3:39 to be exact .

  the drought is over . 
  well , soon , hopefully . 
  a `` massive rap/hip-hop fan '' should recognize how great wayne 's music is . 
  well , at least in the mid-late 2000s era . 
  ^ and ^ i ^ think ^ `` dedication ^ 5 '' ^ was ^ also ^ pretty ^ good, 
  i was hoping that the radio `` updates '' at some point through the story ... but i think they just do n't actually have it . 
  real fucking shame , would have loved to commit rampages to sosa . 
  haha , those dudes should meet this local guy whose nickname is gucci ( he 's pretty much a thug , has the gut and - based on my limited exposure - is not the brightest ) . 
  a list of the previous shirts would be nice , so you could get real disappointed over missing something ( and then swearing to yourself to check for new stuff weekly ), 
  found your music through your great story on / r/hiphopheads , been a fan of the ` monarchy ' lp ever since . 
  any chance of these ever getting a physical ( vinyl ) release ? 
  would love to show my support that way . 
  oh and if you ever come to play in europe , please hop by estonia too , i know at least a few people who enjoy your stuff , 
  keep up the good work , ca n't wait for this to drop !, 
  yup , got mine too !, 
  saturday night is not the best time for me , but i 'll try to make it work . 
  * have n't played demon 's in a long while and dark at all on ps3 ( although a bunch on other platforms ), 
  * yup , i 've got ps +, 
  * no platinums, 
  * none , probably . 
  only did one playthrough and basically no pvp/co-op, 
  i feel like juicy j always shines on features . 
  some of my personal favourites :, 
  [ big k.r.i.t - temptation remix ( also featuring waka flocka flame ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pegwednmfbq ) - this song has killer verses from everyone though . 
  [ curren $ y - three 60 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4zgrrw4dve ), 
  [ king louie - my hoes they do drugs ( also featuring pusha t ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fllogzg3hp0 ), 
  [ this is from their official twitter . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/max_damage/status/390827619282731008 ), 
  `` go dig your partner up nigga , bet he ca n't say shit '' is such a cold line that i feel like i 'd freeze to death while wearing a fur coat . 
  [ gucci mane - intro live from fulton county jail ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi1q6cpzjdg ) - this is just incredibly raw and dark . 
  [ gucci mane - two thangs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb61v4og0wo ) - old-school gucci . 
  `` you the one who won the spelling bee / i 'm the first 3rd grader with a felony '', 
  [ gucci mane - get lost feat . 
  birdman ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wqd5wjbkwg ) - the bass on this one is just insane . 
  and my personal favourite :, 
  [ gucci mane - rooftop ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc-6bjd1-gi ) - just incredibly catchy . 
  this owns hard . 
  i had n't heard of this j nics dude before but he and gangsta gibbs sound eerily similar and that 's only a great thing since gibbs has one of the best voices & styles out there right now . 
  beat is dark as fuck too .
