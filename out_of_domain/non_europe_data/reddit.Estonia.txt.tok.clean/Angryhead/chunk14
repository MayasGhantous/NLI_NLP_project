  i 'd like to know too . 
  especially weird considering gucci has done quite a bit of stuff with future - even a whole mixtape ( [ free bricks ] ( http://mixtapemonkey.com/mixtape?m=568 ) ) and i think that `` confused '' was the best song out of all the world war 3 tapes . 
  and then 6 kiss and white flame . 
  if you mean 0005 , yeah . 
  still waiting on that gaga flair . 
  how could you go to a show you enjoy ( and paid a shitton for ) and not stay until the end ? 
  the concept of this baffles me . 
  i guess if you got work early next day or something , but you could probably handle * one * day of feeling slightly more tired than usual ... 
  have you got a last.fm account ? 
  would like to ~ ~ stalk ~ ~ be your friend !, 
  i 've listened to monarchy dozens of times and empire sounded pretty great based on the first listen , so keep on doing what you do !, 
  [ playing as black iron tarkus . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=pl3afgpsci9w1y3b0qyj6qdmvhled4g4vf ) ( link to my youtube playlist , i got to pimp it ), 
  he should do it on the 17th so europeans like me [ could feel even more special . 
  i am insane . 
  just love the way this beat builds . 
  i did n't care much for birds when it came out as a single track , but i feel it really fits in the album . 
  the video is pretty cool too but i ca n't listen to this song without the intro of weezy & dj drama talking shit . 
  curren $ y 's first single , he 's been doing great stuff for a long time . 
  it 's wayne 's mixtape , but this is considered curren $ y 's first single - [ well , at least according to wikipedia . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/where_da_cash_at ), 
  either way works , they 're both great on it . 
  the one i scrobble to last.fm is tagged as a wayne song . 
  dark souls for me too . 
  i 've got more than 300 hours logged combined on the three platforms and so it 's a very familiar yet still satisfying experience for me . 
  and there 's always different builds to try out if you 're feeling like it . 
  i been campaigning for that gaga flair for a while now . 
  i 'd trade out the god for the queen ... ` least for a while . 
  [ i made one back in may . ], 
  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1evptq/flair_time_alright_kids_its_thats_time_again/ca4d18l?context=3 ) never got added here though . 
  oh yeah , the_legend_and_tupac . jpg, 
  audio recording/playback/manipulation . 
  the first time i 've had to start using the ndk ( to be fair , i 've only been doing android stuff for slightly less than a year and for four months in a ` professional ' capacity ), 
  well , 90 % of the time i listen to any instrumental stuff i have in my library , so :, 
  clams casino - instrumentals 1/2, 
  daft punk - `` tron : legacy '' soundtrack ( as already mentioned ), 
  frank klepacki - command & conquer soundtracks ( mostly the tiberian dawn one ), 
  geoff barrow & ben salisbury - drokk : music inspired by mega-city one, 
  karma to burn - any of their albums, 
  mf doom ( as metal fingers ) - special herbs , vol . 
  matt uelmen - diablo 1/2 soundtracks, 
  nine inch nails - quake os , ghosts i-iv, 
  paul leonard morgan & kelvis ochoa - `` dredd '' soundtrack, 
  trent reznor & atticus ross - `` the social network '' & `` the girl with the dragon tattoo '' soundtracks, 
  vangelis - `` blade runner '' soundtrack, 
  yawning man - any of their albums, 
  if anyone has any specific suggestions , based on this ( kinda varied ) stuff , i 'd be glad to hear them . 
  especially if you count the second half ( ambitionz ) too . 
  for anyone ctrl + f-ing for this : the wire, 
  ( doing this since i certainly came to the comments expecting this clip ), 
  guccimerica just trying to keep him down . 
  the only good thing about [ the recent news ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1s10xs/gucci_mane_indicted_on_federal_gun_charges_faces/ ) is the possibility of getting another track as raw as this . 
  like dj holiday said :, 
   `` gucci called me from fulton county and told me to start recording , '' says dj holiday . 
  `` he busted a hot verse right there on the phone and that 's what you hear on the record , with the 1-minute automated warning and all , ` you have one minute remaining ' , it 's so real . '', 
  it 's from the `` trap house '' booklet . 
  the first three are all non-hip-hop instrumental stuff that i mostly listen to while working ( programming ) . 
  ca n't really do that with stuff that has lyrics in it . 
  if ** mf doom 's / metal fingers 's ** stuff was tagged as one single album , it would probably top that list , since i listen to the ** special herbs ** albums a lot . 
  any suggestions for similar , instrumental hip-hop stuff ? 
  ** gucci mane - trap house 3 ** - gucci has had a great year music-wise - and a really shitty year otherwise . 
  i do n't think any single project has been super-great , but they 've all been solid . 
  trap house 3 is probably the best one though - ` nuthin on ya ' , ` traphouse 3 ' , ` tell 'em that ' , ` off the leash ' and especially 'd . i.g. 
  ( dipped in gold ) ' are fucking great . 
  ** spaceghostpurrp - blvcklvnd rvdio 66.6 ( 1991 ) ** - i feel like all raider klan and spaceghostpurrp stuff really fits the dark wintery days , matches the mood . 
  ** big k.r.i.t. 
  - k.r.i.t. 
  wuz here ** - still krit 's best imo . 
  just a real fun thing to listen to , with some introspective stuff too . 
  ** kanye west - college dropout ** - one of those albums my circle of friends usually puts in the background for parties . 
  my favourite from kanye too . 
  daft punk 's discovery fits the same party-background role . 
  ** freddie gibbs - str8 killa no filla ** - i just listened to ` the ghetto ' and ` rock bottom ' on repeat since they are waaaay smooth . 
  gibbs definitely one of the best out there , i hope he blows up . 
  did you animate this ? 
  it was great , keep it up , i love stuff like this !, 
  these [ giant ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7jmwoj0uvq ) [ bomb ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rahdhihc40o ) [ animated ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krhk3ilt9ua ) ( 3 separate links ) are my favourites , though the style is a bit more out there ( and they 're from a podcast that is supposed to be about video games ), 
  ca n't wait for run the jewels 2 !, 
  killer mike is hilarious . 
  the best banger off dedication 5 , imo . 
  some classic weezy wordplay with an effortless flow . 
  do n't kill , typa way , pure colombia and you song are basically the only songs i listen to off d5 , but i listen to them a whole lot . 
  that 's great but i 've always preferred the [ `` tupperware '' freestyle from pitchfork 's selector ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwbnm24yne&amp;t=5m ) ( starts at 5 minutes ), 
  `` this is what i died for '' - nelson mandela, 
  the best christmas . 
  it 's just a joke , in the same style as a lot of others that get posted whenever any lil b stuff comes up ^ ^ and ^ ^ i ^ ^ stole ^ ^ it ^ ^ off ^ ^ facebook ^ ^ and ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ my ^ ^ highest-rated ^ ^ comment, 
  i feel bad - tried listening to this a couple of days ago but could n't get past three songs because he sounds * sooo * much like chance . 
  like it was making me uncomfortable or some shit , i do n't know . 
  dumbest/greatest song of the year , owns . 
  i had listened to the original so many times that when the remix came out it just sounded ... wrong to me . 
  that 's how it goes for most remixes/freestyles for me ... 
  original is still fire . 
  that 's different because it came out at the same time as the original , so that meant that there was no way i had already heard the original like a dozen times before . 
  [ i am into having sex , i ai n't into making love !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j77zgv3qfoe ), 
  slightly off-topic , but this is also a good way of thinking to get into the more extreme sub-genres of metal ( death/black ), 
  mommy & daddy , please stop fighting ; + (, 
  probably because only jeff & patrick completed it . 
  hopefully the [ spoiler ] ( #s `` armstrong fight '' ) from the end gets some recognition for best moment . 
  i cried when seeing gaga summer of 2012 .
