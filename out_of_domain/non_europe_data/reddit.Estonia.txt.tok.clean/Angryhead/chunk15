  a near-religious experience . 
  track 24 , `` lanlord '' samples the ps1 start-up sound . 
  i 'll go with last 12 months because otherwise it 's just 5 songs from slayer 's first album . 
  1 ) gunplay -- bible on the dash, 
  2 ) gucci mane -- rooftop, 
  3 ) mayhem x antiserum -- brick squad anthem, 
  4 ) lil ' wayne -- where da cash at ( should probably be tagged as curren $ y but it was from d2 so yeah ), 
  5 ) daft punk -- fall ( or danny brown - grown up if going with only hip-hop ), 
  this should have been a single . 
  probably favourite gucci song from this year . 
  [ link too . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kcudzj0b_k ) amazing instrumental . 
  started working in august ( part-time as for now ) as a programmer ( android app developer ) for a start-up a schoolmate of mine started . 
  i 've only been seriously programming for like a year so it 's great to go from starting to getting paid for doing something you love . 
  he 's always ranting , but for what it 's worth , lil b * did * diss him on 05 fuck em , on the track `` from the bay '' :, 
   i made my mind up / i 'm only wearing based clothes, 
  feeling like spaceghost ( what ? ), 
  / but that nigga broke with no tv show ( haaaaah ! ), 
  leave a nigga dry with no bitches doe ( fuck 'em ! ), 
  1:17 for the diss :,

  you should n't , but concerts are way less fun if the audience are n't into it . 
  that 's the cool thing about directly ordering from small ( ish ) labels , there 's a good chance they 'll throw in some random shit . 
  i 've gotten a bunch of stickers when ordering some metal records and a german distro sent me their mail order magazine once a month for like a year ( i 'm in estonia ) after ordering from them once ( i guess some people would have found that annoying but i thought it was cool ... even though i did n't order from it ever ), 
  it seems to be a pretty common experience ( mine too ) that s2 works a lot better on a rewatch . 
  it 's kind of a shock the first time through , so many new characters and a story mostly focusing on them , but if you go for a rewatch , you already know the characters and what to expect so can focus on the more subtle stuff . 
  that cover image is amazing . 
  he 's already got a jay z `` inspired '' cover with [ the basedprint ii ] ( http://i.imgur.com/el30haw.png ) and a [ watch the throne photoshop with the silent president ] ( http://i.imgur.com/37dut1q.png ) . 
  what 's next ? 
  one of the first lines on the opening track of that tape , [ ` nyu ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b2mumnzirq ) is, 
   `` basedprint volume 2 , no need for volume 1 ... '', 
  one of his better tapes imo , consistently good with no overtly silly tracks , check it out if you 're curious . 
  it 's basically like a shorter god 's father . 
  ah , cool . 
  probably my top 3 of his `` serious '' projects too , 
  i 've got 2527 and that 's definitely not all . 
  there 's also [ ` great china sea ' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idazpfe6rne ) that uses the ` lift off ' beat . 
  reminds me of [ this one ( two thangs ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb61v4og0wo ), 
  [ user : angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  just know that all of the non-hip-hop instrumental stuff that i listened to :, 
  ** frank klepacki - c&c tiberian dawn os **, 
  ** nine inch nails - ghosts i-iv **, 
  ** trent reznor and atticus ross - the girl with the dragon tattoo os ** & ** the social network os **, 
  ** paul-leonard morgan - dredd os **, 
  ** geoff barrow and ben salisbury - drokk **, 
  are all great and were mostly listened to while programming . 
  oh and ** giant bomb - giant bombcast ** is the giant bomb podcast . 
  they talk mostly about video games . 
  i like those . 
  yeah , some people do ... 
  ** the underachievers - indigioism ** - just a very enjoyable album for me , love the beats and the style of those dudes . 
  the `` third eye '' shit does get old though . 
  probably first since it came out so early in the year . 
  ** czarface - czarface ** - great throwback that does n't sound old in the wrong way . 
  criminally underrated . 
  ** lil b - 6 kiss ** - lil b-s straight-up best project , imo . 
  love it and i think anyone who likes hip-hop would enjoy at least most of it . 
  ** lil b - trapped in basedworl ** - aaaaaaaaaaaaaah need to get hype ? 
  this is what to pick . 
  ignorant and enjoyable as hell . 
  also check out the first five tracks of ** gold house ** !, 
  ** lil b - god 's father ** - pretty much the same idea as 6 kiss , though harder to recommend since it 's longer and not quite as consistent , i think . 
  ** a$ ap rocky - longlivea $ ap ** - it 's no livelovea $ ap but it 's really good , with some throwaway tracks ( fashion killa uuuuuuugh ), 
  ** mf doom ** ( as metal fingers ) ** - special herbs vol . 
  3-4 ** - i listened to a hell of a lot of all of this series but it turns out this one has slightly more plays than the others . 
  great , chill stuff !, 
  i want to give out a honourable mention to ** gucci mane ** - 1322 plays ( third most-played artist ) over the last 12 months but spread out over a bunch of his releases , trap house 3 probably being the best out of this year . 
  you had a great year musically gucci , just try to stay out of the slammer !, 
  it 's really fucking good and chill as hell !, 
  one of my most-listened albums of all time , even got it on vinyl . 
  that ps1 start-up sample is awesome . 
  i 've already done posted this a few times in similar threads but here goes again :, 
  some ** estonian ** stuff :, 
  first two are old-school classics and the three others are newish ... and the first 3 all feature the same dude , which shows how much i know about the local scene/how crappy it is :, 
  [ droopy vs dj critical - tallinn feat . 
  genka ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibjyxkxqwee ), 
  [ a-r\u00fchm - qrat ja ingel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltdo_zptrgu ), 
  [ genka - curacao ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbwqohxus7m ), 
  [ metsakutsu - 11 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcop0ycnm2w ) ( this recently won best local video ), 
  [ tomm \u00a5 $ a$ h - guez whoz back ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5ljafg4w9u ), 
  not sure how well they work when you ca n't understand the language though ( although i 've heard the language is quite beautiful-sounding ), 
  [ `` 2 points off , bruh bruh . 
  '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzqxdeqget0&amp;t=2m40s ), 
  lil b - sometimes i wish he had a bit more quality control or whatever . 
  think of his 2012 output ... if he took the best parts from stuff like god 's father , the basedprint ii , white flame , obama basedgod , # 1 bitch and so on i think he could put out like a really fucking solid double disc or something that every hip-hop fan could `` unironically '' enjoy . 
  and he could combine trapped in basedworld and some other stuff for some heavy-ass cooking/hyphy music too . 
  speaking as a pretty damn hardcore lil b fan ( most played artist on last.fm with more than 7k plays ) . 
  ^ ^ also ^ ^ the ^ ^ fanbase ^ ^ or ^ ^ atleast ^ ^ the ^ ^ ironic ^ ^ so-called ^ ^ fans, 
  you just found one . 
  have you listened to the entire `` i 'm gay '' album ? 
  it 's basically all stuff like this and it 's only 45 minutes long , worth a shot . 
  i love wonton soup , would fit great on a `` cooking '' album by him but i was mostly just talking about his 2012 output . 
  [ odd future got on stage with lil b @ coachella 2011 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2tn1w8lt4e ), 
  that would be interesting for sure , there was an [ interview with too $ hort ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwdytdssfvs ) where he talks about how lil b wrote all the hooks for the pack songs so there 's at least proof that he could write something that could be successful in the mainstream too . 
  i think the lyrics are definitely his weakpoint right now though ( in relation to any possible mainstream success ), 
  maybe the reason i like lil b is that as a non-english-native i do n't `` listen '' to the lyrics all that much usually anyway ... 
  and god damn , not giving a fuck and doing that verse for that wayne song was cool in its own way but if he had done a `` i own swag '' type of spitting on that song ...
