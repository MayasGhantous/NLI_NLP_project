  buuuut i do n't think they 're all that consistent . 
  maybe i 'll try putting one together sometime ... 
  there 's a dot at the end of your second link that causes it to lead to the wrong place . 
  but i second that tutorial otherwise !,

  ** 2 chainz - b.o.a.t.s. 
  ii : me time ** - have been listening to the first half of this album on repeat , especially `` 36 '' , which is so short that the plays just pile up . 
  ** boris - heavy rocks ** ( the 2002 version ) - awesome stoner rock that i recently discovered for myself . 
  the least japanese-sounding band name but it sounds damn good . 
  ** j dilla - donuts ** - also something i first listened to not too long ago . 
  very chill and hearing the original instrumental or sample ( `` one eleven '' ) for a song that i 've heard a ton before ( lil b 's `` dress for the occasion '' ) is always a cool thing . 
  ** daft punk - tron legacy ost ** - another week with this on the table , what a surprise !, 
  as i 've said previously , great background music for programming or whatever you 're into . 
  ** black flag - damaged ** - just a classic hardcore punk album , i do n't have much to add . 
  ** karma to burn - almost heathen ** - instrumental stoner rock , also great background stuff . 
  ** matt uelmen - diablo ii ost ** - yeah , same as the tron legacy ost , although this one also brings back nostalgic memories of the hundreds ( if not thousands ) of hours spent with the game . 
  ** mf doom ( as metal fingers ) - special herbs , vol . 
  1-2 ** - dope beats , for background, 
  ** nujabes - modal soul ** - also something i just recently listened to for the first time . 
  that intro track ( `` feather '' ) is just incredibly relaxing and chill . 
  did n't listen to a whole lot of music this week overall but at least i got a bit of variety . 
  [ you can check out a post of mine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1rtsr3/whats_your_work_soundtrack/cdqvko8 ) , though most of the stuff is non-hip-hop , but hopefully you 'll see something you have n't heard before . 
  thank you , this seems very useful !, 
  i had a lot of trouble my first time exporting a model from blender to use in libgdx and since i have n't done it in a while , i 'll keep in mind to use this when i come back to 3d in libgdx . 
  [ 2 chainz - 36 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cysrmgqcb0q ), 
  [ curren $ y - sixteen switches ( part 2 ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqk1qvajq9s ), 
  catchy * and * informative !, 
  should have been a single !, 
  man , i downloaded his tape or album or whatever a couple of years ago ... it was terrible . 
  [ and in video form ( starts at 4h38m30s ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtyapjct-eq&amp;t=4h38m30s ) - loud yelling ( the appropriate response though ! ), 
  warning !, 
  the articles ( `` opinion pieces '' i guess ? ), 
  are pretty hit-and-miss , but noisey 's ( rap ) videos are damn good . 
  [ the noisey raps series ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nfkc7iwjyc&amp;list=pldoau1ucje-gflfgykzbvbkdbr1cakbsm&amp;src_vid=tybftk6vtvo&amp;feature=iv&amp;annotation_id=annotation_3769743793 ) comes highly recommended , it 's still informative but way lighter and funny ( especially the gucci & waka episode ), 
  [ caught him looking like max biggavelli ] ( http://i.imgur.com/srgiehq.png ), 
  thanks for the post , always good to hear about the experiences of others as an android dev myself !, 
  just wanted to mention that i think the colours on your site make it really hard to distinguish between regular text and links ; might be just my monitor though . 
  i 'd love this [ lady gaga flair ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pxeall8.png ) , ca n't rep my queen otherwise . 
  [ i made a bunch of gucci flairs a while back for a thread like this too ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1evptq/flair_time_alright_kids_its_thats_time_again/ca4cxn6 ) but i guess we already have at least one . 
  this is slightly off-topic but i did n't know where to bring this up . 
  have you guys thought about adding last.fm usernames as the `` hover '' / alt-text/whatever it 's called for flairs ? 
  last.fm does n't seem super-popular based on the weekly threads but that 'd still be cool . 
  let me know if i should make a separate thread for this or something !, 
  oh man , the middle one is so good !, 
  want, 
  [ from that compilation of ` pimp my ride ' intros ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1vz2vs/thought_you_guys_would_like_this_every_one_of/ ), 
  [ user : angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  listened to a whole bunch of new-to-me stoner rock this week , so a lot of these are just `` one playthrough '' albums . 
  ** slo burn - amusing the amazing ** - `` the best album kyuss never wrote . '', 
  if you 're into [ hard rock at all , be sure to check out this underrated 4-track ep ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g78pba7ejpk ) , it 'll only take you 16 minutes . 
  the demo tracks that are added on in some versions are also great . 
  goat stoner rock album imo . 
  ** lil b - 6 kiss ** - just finished listening through this again , so damn good , love it , lil b 's best work imo . 
  ** matt uelmen - diablo 2 ost ** - background music for programming and stuff . 
  brings back a lot of memories . 
  ** melvins - houdini ** - a stoner classic that i had n't listened to until now . 
  pretty great . 
  ** gucci mane - str8 drop presents : gucci mane la flare ** - a compilation of gucci tracks reportedly from as early as 2001 that was released a couple of years ago . 
  old-school gucci is still gucci and still great . 
  ** 2 chainz - b.o.a.t.s ii : me time ** - first half of this album is great , especially `` 36 '' . 
  ** fatso jetson - stinky little gods ** - more stoner rock , a bit too light/surfy for my tastes though . 
  ** lowrider - ode to io ** - yet more stoner rock . 
  alright kyuss clone , but it ai n't no kyuss . 
  ** yawning man - rock formations ** - and lets finish this off with ... more stoner rock , this time instrumental . 
  background music . 
  hmm , some days between the last two dates , maybe they can fit in a gig in estonia if they 're already heading to lithuania ... one can hope . 
  late nite tip is such a great beat , god damn . 
  wulf was good too . 
  [ lil b - pretty bitch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vayrmjwvc44 ), 
  i thought [ pure colombia ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqwaa_p3sey ) was fuego , as was [ you song with chance ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkowz0rfe7y ) , for example . 
  dedication 5 was pretty good overall . 
  gibbs was already on domo 's `` no idols '' project though , on the track [ till the angels come ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yemy7qbo2a ), 
  that 's the date that [ gibbs ' facebook page posted ] ( https://www.facebook.com/gangstagibbs/posts/10202222323333137?stream_ref=1 ) too .

  lil b - trapped in basedworld, 
  funny how the opinion on lord $ never worry changed over time , i remember everyone calling it junk at first ( i did n't much care for it either ) but it seems like most people like it now . 
  i think if you cut like half the songs it 'd be a great short album/ep, 
  wow , that 's awesome , i 'm super-jealous . 
  the entire series has been background music for me while writing code for a while now . 
  incredible stuff . 
  his beats are god-tier , but i do n't much care for his rapping .
