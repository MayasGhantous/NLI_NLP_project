  `` technically impressive '' does n't do much for me .

  the ( lack of ) flow . 
  i 've sent two emails to diorpaint at gmail.com and gotten replies to both ( no beats , just a question and a little story ) so you could probably try that,

  a quick googling leads me to believe it 's from the 2009 film [ `` the janky promoters '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210071/ ) . 
  ( listened to the sample , started typing the words `` russel red '' , autocomplete suggested `` russell red incorporated we winning please don hate it '' and the first result was [ this transcription of the movie 's script .

  i picked up some [ mastodon rolling papers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4pcq163.jpg ) when they came to estonia on their the hunter tour !, 
  they cost way too much but it seemed like the only appropriate thing to get . 
  i 'm no expert , they seem decent enough for me . 
  joe booty, 
  if you enjoy doom 's production , check out the `` special herbs '' series by metal fingers ( one of doom 's many alter egos ), 
  even the vinyl version has n't come out yet . 
  currently scheduled for the 28th of february , i think . 
  i mean yeah , that just makes business sense . 
  do n't put all your eggs in one basket and so on . 
   after listening to only metal, 
  i 'm gon na go from here , since i 'm a metalhead-turned-hip-hop-head too ( i 've been listening to a ton of stoner/doom stuff lately though ! ), 
  have you tried listening to any trap ? 
  `` flockaveli '' is basically the equivalent of a metal album . 
  try [ `` bustin ' at em '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0opjwlpdnrw ) for a taste . 
  go check out / r/trapmuzik if you 're feeling it . 
  and if you like electric wizard ( if not , what the fuck ? ), 
  try this song , [ trae tha truth - `` i 'm fresh '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mntbot5gh4 ), 
  catch up !, 
  that doom one is so cute . 
  i like visiting his page about once every two weeks , makes for some funny ( but also a bit sad ) reading . 
  everything gibbs and madlib have done together has been dope so far , so i 'm going with him . 
  i 'd go with `` baby face killa '' , it 's what i 've listened to the most . 
  honestly i think his projects are usually pretty inconsistent , some great songs mixed with some decent if not outright bad stuff . 
  if you enjoy doing this , definitely keep it up . 
  only thing that stuck out to me was that some posts included your personal opinions while others did n't - i feel like this should be consistent , either post stuff with no comment by you ( boring but safer i suppose ? ), 
  or comment on everything you post ( makes it more interesting imho , but if people disagree with you they might stop reading ), 
  like with the tracks on your blog i ca n't be certain whether you only post stuff that you personally really like or whether it 's more like posting `` important '' new tracks . 
  i 'd definitely be more interested in opinionated stuff . 
  either way , i gave you a follow . 
  good luck !, 
  i feel like if you just post new stuff dry , you - one dude - ca n't possibly compete with a bigger site that has a bunch of dudes churning out content . 
  but if you do opinionated stuff and have an interesting style , then there 's a chance , 
  i 'm with you , always liked this song . 
  just rocky and ferg talking shit over a nice beat , what else do you want from a$ ap ? 
  awesome , i love fu manchu , as does / r/stonerrock !, 
  `` the best album that kyuss never wrote . '', 
  my favourite stoner ep for sure . 
  that neckbeard with the shotgun just looks funny , but not in a good way . 
  and ant is totally meh . 
  feeling the first song ... will edit with reactions to others . 
  e : anybody know whether the beat to the first one is some classic or something new ? 
  aww , why 'd he have to cut off the second song ? 
  yeah , reminds me of the basedprint 2 , mos def one of my favourites from lil b. 
  thank you !, 
   i imagine lil b 's income is almost entirely from live performances . 
  yeah , i do n't think he has any official merchandise out , unfortunately . 
  [ worked out alright . 
  cleaning was kind of a pain though , should use more butter or something next time . 
   on the way out vic was sitting in the foyer selling merch so i got a picture and his autograph . 
  you know you ca n't just post this without also posting the picture , right ?

  [ sixteen switches part 2 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyz3z0vwys ) - just a snippet though ? 
  thought so too but whoever titled it tripped me . 
  the sweatiness just proves that you were having fun !, 
  haha , most everybody here hates on that verse . 
  i really enjoy it too , the weird voices are a big part of what makes ferg enjoyable for me . 
  that recording sounds really tinny though , feels like it was recorded through phone speakers . 
  [ even cnn 's article on el chapo quoted this song !,

  the posthumous `` i have gone in ... to the ground '' will just solidify his status as the goat . 
  i bet there 's plenty of people out there like that , it 's just a logo that looks cool and `` misfits '' just sounds like something befitting of it . 
  lets see how / r/hhh responds to the suburban all-stars ... 
  [ user : angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  ** gucci mane - trap house ** - for a while , i was n't quite sure what gucci 's best release from 2013 was , but now i 'm certain that it 's this . 
  great beats and a surprising amount of variety in both lyrics and vocal styles ( mostly thanks to young thug & rich homie quan ) . 
  ** big k.r.i.t. 
  - return of 4eva ** - just such a great tape , slightly beaten out by k.r.i.t. 
  wuz here for me though . 
  ** schoolboy q - oxymoron ** - did n't go along with the hype , listened through it once and enjoyed it , but have n't really felt an urge to go back and listen to it once , although `` man of the year '' keeps coming up and looping in my head from time to time ... 
  ** nine inch nails - ghosts i-iv ** - my most listened to album on last.fm . 
  love this style of dark ambient stuff and looking for any more suggestions if anybody has them !, 
  ** daft punk - homework ** - have n't listened to this much and it 's pretty cool , though no it 's no discovery imo . 
  ** frank klepacki - c&c red alert & tiberian dawn os ** - nostalgic stuff for me , while still being really great background instrumental stuff . 
  ** young thug - 1017 thug ** - finally listened to this for the first time . 
  pretty great , been enjoying thugger 's features for a minute now . 
  ** kanye west - graduation ** - had n't listened to this for a while , even though it might have been the first hip-hop album i listened to a ton . 
  most beats are a bit too poppy for my taste these days , but i think there are a ton of great & funny lyrics on this album . 
  fun fact - if i go to local parties , this is the only kanye album being played , but if i go to parties in the capital then `` yeezus '' gets played . 
  not sure which i prefer .
