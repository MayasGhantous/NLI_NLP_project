   the underachievers - first time i 've listened to indigoism in two years , good memories, 
  dude , that album came out just over a year ago . 
  love it too though , even if the lyric themes get repetitive fast . 
  i think it was my most listened to tape from last year . 
  they 're kind of a weird mix of rock/metal with electronic elements and voice samples , but i love them . 
  at least partly probably because they were a big part of what i played and therefore heard in my youth though . 
  * eye * think that the government might be fucking with you on some * third eye shit * bruh . 
  ^ ^ i ^ ^ hate ^ ^ myself ^ ^ for ^ ^ typing ^ ^ that, 
  i 'd personally recommend `` trap back '' and `` mr. 
  zone 6 '' if you want some more gucci . 
  fuck yeah it 's a classic , one of my favourites too and even the dj burn one drops are nonintrusive . 
  got a more old-school sound to it though , pretty different when compared to trap house 3 . 
  thanks for sharing , this is dope . 
  looks like this is going to be a heavy cooking album , based on the two songs released so far . 
  lets see if he can trump `` trapped in basedworld '' though ... 
  pretty bitch, 
  beat the odds, 
  what you doin ', 
  i 'm god, 
  o my god 66, 
  all alone, 
  let the eagles go, 
  real plexxx, 
  walk the world, 
  ( birth of rap ), 
  i got bitches, 
  finna hit a lick, 
  based, 
  i want your bitch, 
  what i mean, 
  i 'm the devil, 
  smoke trees fxxx hoes, 
  i went by amount of plays and mostly listen to albums start-to-finish , sometimes skipping a few songs . 
  lil b is basically cheating but , from t-shirts & buddens :, 
   keep recording girlfriends / bet you still jack off, 
   with your butt-cheeks out / listening to `` mood muzik '', 
  got two pairs of these , love 'em . 
  just about to get into d&d ( pathfinder ) so that is damn tempting . 
  too bad i do n't have much use for cassettes and shipping costs more than the package itself ... 
  guess i 'll give the album a try , maybe it 'll be really good . 
  e : two songs in , fuck it , ordered it . 
  pretty great so far . 
  you should cross-post to / r/hiphopimages ( and perhaps note that you made it in the title ), 
  [ this is a good article ] ( http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/mar/01/ukraine-haze-propaganda/?insrc=hpss ) if you want a summary ( of decent length ) of what 's going on in the ukraine . 
  [ and this one ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/02/crimea-crisis-russia-ukraine-cold-war ) explains the russian motives some more . 
  yeah , any article is probably at least slightly biased ... 
  i 'm probably biased towards pro-eu/anti-russia ( living in estonia and so russia flexing it 's muscles does not bode well for us , historically ), 
  would n't mind if he brought that back . 
  a lot of the beats on mastermind have kind of a similar vibe . 
  well , the song was released a few months ago but the video is new . 
  this looks great , but i have to say that my favourite part of keto ( and paleo ) is eating last night 's leftovers - meat !, 
  - for breakfast !, 
  trap house 3 was the best project for sure , but if we 're strictly speaking mixtapes , then i 'd probably go with world war 3 : lean . 
  i only got into gucci late 2012 ( about the time the first trap god came out i think ) but i 've listened to him a lot since then and try to show him a lot of love on this sub and help out people asking for recommendations . 
  realized how many people he has put on thanks to this thread , damn impressive . 
  slowly trying to work through some of his older projects i have n't listened to yet but it 's a big undertaking for sure . 
  he posted [ the first of the two tracks he was supposed to release today ] ( https://soundcloud.com/1017brickfactory/hot-boys-gucci-mane-ft-young?utm_source=soundcloud&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=twitter ) a bit ago but the soundcloud user had this track on it too . 
  guess they realized it was a mistake and deleted it for now . 
  it was a banger though , keep your eyes out for it !, 
  thank you for all the hard work , praises to the trap god . 
  i 'll definitely keep it in mind when i find time to go through some of his stuff from 07-10 i have n't listened to properly or at all . 
  i think i would have believed you if you had said that this was a picture of a mother and her daughter . 
  awesome progress , congrats !, 
  have you listened to any gucci stuff from last year ? 
  all of them have a similar sound , though this is slightly more `` electronicy '' . 
  i 'd recommend trap house 3 , i think it was the best overall release from him last year . 
  [ trae ( tha truth ) - i 'm fresh ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mntbot5gh4 ) samples [ electric wizard - dopethrone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs5coyqmyjk ) , which is a stoner/doom metal masterpiece . 
  great usage of the sample , i wish there was more metal like this used in hip-hop ... that would n't result in nu-metal . 
  [ they 've already collaborated with him before ... ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l9x98vl.png ), 
  i do n't care what part of the states the rappers are from , but i noticed that i like the southern dudes the most , at least lately . 
  big k.r.i.t. , curren $ y , weezy , three 6 mafia , sgp and stuff like that has been on heavy rotation for me . 
  i hope gibbs & gucci team up for a jeezy diss some day . 
  anybody recognize the high-pitched sample ? 
  sounds like i 've heard it before , probably at a slower speed though ... 
  hard-ass beat in any case . 
  [ i want to replace the you died message in souls with this . 
  thanks , it 's definitely that . 
  [ wayne 's version off d5 was cool too ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf4cdwnmrug ), 
  not that much of a stretch tho , reddit is filled with people who play a lot of video games and souls is a pretty popular video game . 
  also the best . 
  i played 4 hours of dark souls 2 late last night ( got it a day early , release date was today in the eu ), 
  loving it like the previous ones !, 
  [ `` mini van dan ( remix ) ( feat . 
  danny brown , a$ ap nast & flatbush zombies ) '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2g2hhphp1e ) is the only thing i had heard a$ ton on previously and i really like it . 
  copped a$ ton 3:16 when it came out but have n't found time to listen to it yet . 
  we have that over here in estonia too , really helpful . 
  never thought that other countries would not have that , seems crazy useful !, 
  it 's [ `` ellen degeneres ( remix ) '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb6aggxh-gm ) in case you were wondering . 
   dude mj was a fuckin g. . he got tons of love, 
  this reminded me of [ this hilarious animation of gibbs talking about a time jackson visited his hometown , gary . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyyaxudadrq ), 
  a what ? 
  anyway , yes , just do n't give up on keto . 
  stalls are normal , okay and happen to everybody . 
  thanks and congrats to you too !, 
  you reminded me that i have n't actually tracked my fat/protein macros , just done my best to keep carbs low . 
  i really should get a food scale and see for sure , i 'm guessing i 'm relatively close to the recommended macros though . 
  a straight-up , no bullshit banger . 
  ca n't wait for hoop life !, 
  [ it was on that subreddit 's front page but here you go .
