  nah those are unpopular for a reason . 
  really enjoying this trend of using autotune but not going too overboard with it . 
  is this seriously the case for you [ or were you just making a sloppy pulp fiction reference ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za_tl1kvlqu ), 
  ah , okay , sure , i can definitely see where you 're coming from and no way i 'm going to argue with pig being filthy . 
  still tasty to me though , haha . 
  i just said `` holy fucking shit '' under my breath . 
  definitely going to try this out !, 
  thanks and good luck from a fellow android developer !, 
  not exactly what you 're looking for but [ lil b - `` lifes hard '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfc6fvnle_i ) always makes me cheer up , even though most of the lyrics are n't all that cheerful . 
  yeah , i 'm dumb . 
  i was looking at the datpiff link and they still have a countdown for another hour . 
  i 'll keep hoping that you come to estonia one day !, 
  thank you for libgdx , i 've been using it for about a year and a half now and very much enjoy working in it ( even using it for work projects ! ), 
  in addition to what fickfrosch71 already mentioned , i 'm currently reading ** grain brain ** . 
  have only read ** why we get fat ** previously but grain brain feels a lot more `` science-y '' to me , a bit harder to read . 
  i 've got a related question but i do n't want to create a new thread :, 
  how are the fat/protein ratios in the pork rinds that are available in the us ? 
  ( since most of the users in this sub seem to be from the states ), 
  in estonia , i 've seen three different local ( or at least european ) brands . 
  two have had about the same amount of fat & protein , but one has about 1.5 times more fat than protein - it 's also got some softer , fatty flesh on it and is the best tasting , but it also costs about 2x as much . 
   tl ; dr chick flirted with me . 
  turned down her cupcake in favor of nuts . 
  i would have laughed out loud had i not been in a public place !, 
  good job , i have n't been on keto as long as you ( though been on relatively strict paleo for a few years ) but this is also how i like to think about these things . 
  and any cravings are basically gone !, 
  taco salad is quick , easy and delicious :, 
  add however much minced meat you want to make to your pan, 
  start browning it, 
  add whatever spices you like ( salt , pepper & chili for me ), 
  add some chopped lettuce about halfway in, 
  eat once brown !, 
  optional but highly recommended : add shredded cheese , sour cream and some ( low-carb ) sauce, 
  so how did you like journey on the ps3 ? 
  comedy asnwer : [ lil b - ellen degeneres ( remix ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb6aggxh-gm ), 
  lil b actually has some songs where he samples interviews ( big surprise , considering the size of his discography ) like [ `` where the game began '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blfcksfuov0 ) samples some interview but i have no idea who is being interviewed or where it 's from . 
  if you know , let me know !, 
  not * all * but definitely the vast majority of it . 
  [ life is a gamble ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpo3ipq9xrm ) off of king remembered in time was produced by 9th wonder for example . 
  what 's you programming background otherwise ? 
   i only used the startapp exit banner , so there are no ads in-game , only when you exit it . 
  as it is full screen , it brings more revenue and you do not have to sacrifice space in-game for the banner . 
  that definitely sounds like something that would piss a lot of people off . 
  thanks for posting , i 'm also enjoying working with libgdx . 
  honestly - i do n't know . 
  ads are such a touchy subject and they cause a lot of people to react ( imo ) irrationally . 
  the project i 'm working on right now has a banner ad that appears at the end of levels ( while you see the score and whether you can move on to the next level and so on ) which seems pretty harmless to me , but i have no idea how users will actually react . 
  awesome , i just had a similar experience !, 
  was at a concert ( windhand , psychedelic doom metal ) and went to buy a shirt to support the band afterwards . 
  asked for a size medium , but the lady behind the counter ( the band 's singer ) said that the sizes run pretty big and that maybe i 'd like a size small instead . 
  told her i 'll take the risk and thanked her for the compliment :d, 
  it 's definitely a bit tight , but i have faith that i 'll get to the point where i can wear it comfortably ... soon !, 
  haha , i saw the live yesterday ( they kicked ass by the way ! ), 
  and would have been surprised too , had i not just read an interview with them the day before . 
  doom duo from estonia , their great [ first full-length is available for `` name your price '' on bandcamp ] ( http://talbot.bandcamp.com/album/eos ) . 
  finally managed to catch them live yesterday , they were awesome warming up the stage for windhand !, 
  i 've been using libgdx for more than a year now and in my experience , they 've `` broken '' very little in updates . 
  the only two things i had any problems with ( scene2d stage & gl1 .0 ) [ are covered in the 1.0 update blog entry ] ( http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=3412 ) . 
  as an estonian , i share your pain . 
   if you are already skinny fat , more lifting and putting on a little muscle might help you in the long run lose the rest of that fat . 
  muscle has an energy maintenance cost , so lifting really could help you lose fat . 
  yeah , that 's definitely something i 'm thinking about . 
  hoping i 'll have some more time once summer comes , semi-crunching at work right now . 
   what i do is only remove the amount i am going to eat so i know when to stop . 
  that sounds like an option ... for now though i 'll try not eating any . 
  i 'm the kind of person who ca n't just stop at one . 
   a bouillon cube daily seems excessive, 
  i usually get muscle cramps in my calves if i do n't drink it but i 'll try going without for at least a day . 
   what about potassium and magnesium ? 
  where do you get those minerals from ? 
  do you eat many dark green veggies ? 
  fish , nuts , mushrooms , or avocado ? 
  i pretty rarely eat fish ( usually canned tuna ) , some nuts , do n't like mushrooms but i do eat avocado pretty often . 
  not sure what are considered `` dark green '' , but i eat a lot of broccoli and whatever generic `` salad '' . 
  i 'll try out some spinach next time i go shopping . 
  thanks for reading and replying !, 
  what about `` couch competitive '' games , which have made a big comeback in the last few years ? 
  i have n't played your game ( sorry ! ), 
  but quick googling tells me it also supports local multiplayer , yet i do n't recall you ever trying to market it as `` one of those '' on twitter ( and i 've been following you for a while ) and no mention of that in the post either . 
   i cant tell you how well local mp-only games sell . 
  presumably not brilliantly . 
  [ towerfall seems to have done alright ] ( http://www.gamespot.com/articles/towerfall-sold-better-on-ps4-than-pc-ouya-version-trails-behind/1100-6419269/ ) but there 's not much info out there . 
   people are now constantly telling me it should have been local play only !, 
  i 'm guessing that this is partly due to everybody and their mother having a few 360/ps4 controllers around now , keyboard only just does n't work as well for multiple people . 
  i 'm just a beginner , but implementing online multiplayer for games like this usually seems like way more effort than it 's worth compared to local only . 
  kinda sad , because a lot of people ( including me ) do n't have many friends with whom they could locally play together . 
  good luck with that !, 
  i 've been on-and-off working on a local mp game for about a half a year in my off-time , it 's my first `` bigger '' solo project . 
  i do n't really have ambitions of making any money off it , mostly in it because i enjoy the dev work and want to have something to show off on my resume , to get into `` the industry '' or to find other people to work on similar projects with . 
  at least it 's already pretty fun to play it with friends !, 
  have you taken measurements ? 
  you might still be losing centimeters from your waist , for example . 
  also , you do n't have * that * much to lose . 
  most of the people losing crazy amounts have a lot to lose too , sometimes more than a person 's ( or two ) worth !, 
  a kilo a week is still pretty damn good dude !, 
  how would you determine system requirements for a game ? 
  just a matter of trying it out on different setups ? 
  or is it even of any importance w/r/t free games ? 
  i 've got what i think is a fairly non-processing-power-intensive game - it 's a wip but you can check it out , available on my website in my flair - but it still seems like it would be nice to include some info .
