  i 'll try to not be lazy and get some in . 
  i even have some old soviet-era dumbbells and a kettlebell at home , thanks to my old man , so that 's a good start . 
  e : and i mostly do the bicycling just because i really enjoy it , not only because of training , 
  you should post this to [ / r/ladygaga ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ladygaga/ ) , 
  love it !, 
  probably the only person in the gaming industry that i consider a genius , with a capital g. 
  we are not worthy !, 
  ( yes please please please ), 
  hardcore parkour !, 
  link ? 
  ( to both , if possible ), 
  [ personally , i much prefer this version . 
  is there anything i can do to help if i 'm not from the states ? 
  `` maybe it will never be background music ; it was clearly never meant to be . 
  that 's probably a good thing , but there are times when you just want someone to get all the good bits and chuck them into a megamix . 
  well the day has come , ladies and gentlemen . '', 
  so * that 's * where my 3300 plays of gaga came from !, 
  i love persistence of time , definitely my favourite anthrax album . 
  dark and powerful . 
  i especially love the combination of intro to reality & belly of the beast . 
  on the other hand , it would be a great story to tell ... 
  dropping loads !, 
  [ fixed that for you . 
  i 'll upload it for you ... 
  [ here you go !,

  i did n't play that much vanilla wow ( got to about level 50 or so and then burning crusade came out ) but as a hunter , this video reminded me - kiting was the most fun you could have . 
  in outlands , i loved kiting the big demons from the gate ( in the first horde area , i ca n't remember the names of the places ) to the village there , causing them to wipe out almost all npcs in the village . 
  pretty assholish now that i think about it , but i still consider it the most fun you could have had . 
  ( the npcs respawned in like 5 minutes anyway ), 
  i wish i still had screenshots of me doing that :(, 
  so wake up , missster freeman . 
  * inhaling *, 
  wake up and ... smell the aashes . 
  ftfy, 
  gaahl sure loves stroking that glass ... 
  comment from youtube :, 
   actually he 's wearing make up in this video , the corpsepaint is his true skin color . 
  have you seen evil dead ? 
  i had the book ( okay , it was more like a comic book ) version of this as a child , and it was fucking terrifying to a pre-kindergarten version of me . 
  i 'm an estonian . 
  you neeeed an estonian voice . 
  just as a minor character . 
  as a homage to encino man . 
  very young by the standards of this thread , it seems !, 
  i 'm in estonia and using elisa too . 
  hope they 've got the same policy over here . 
  yeah , the crowd was pretty good , cheering a lot , of course , when markko m\u00e4rtin or any of the old moskvitches came rumbling ... or if anyone happened to make a costly mistake . 
  there were also a lot of latvians , since otep\u00e4\u00e4 ( around which the rally took place ) is closer to the latvian border , than for example , the capital of estonia , tallinn . 
  a lot of different machines - 3 different generations of wrc !, 
  being a post-soviet country , we also get a lot of ladas and some moskvitches . 
  we sometimes even have trucks competing in estonia , too bad there were n't any this time . 
  [ here 's a picture of one from a previous rally . 
  ] ( http://www.flickr.com/photos/angryhead/5001263637/in/set-72157624857874729/ ), 
  the weather was great , not too hot nor too cold . 
  only rained a bit during the last stage on friday ( the rally took place on friday and saturday ) although this meant that the roads were really dusty on saturday , as you can see in some of the pictures . 
  about the roads - southern estonia has really amazing roads , fast ( the average speed on the first three stages was around 130 km/h ) , snaky , gravelly roads , bumps and some jumps . 
  and every time me and my old man go to a rally , he always points out roads that lead to old special stages that he used to visit years ago , complaining whenever any of them have been `` ruined '' by asphalt . 
  check out the big brain on brett !, 
  [ they do , actually . 
  ] ( http://elisa.ee/et/eraklient/mint/409/mint-arvutipaketid ) ( not that a link in estonian is going to help ), 
  although , thing is , i do n't actually use their broadband service , i just have a phone contract with them ( 5 $ a month for free 3g ! ), 
  i do n't think there were any volgas . 
  no idea about the dzintara volga , never been to a rally in latvia - though i should , some day !, 
  ( bring on rail baltica ), 
  thoughts on hon , dota 2 and any other current/upcoming competitors ? 
  [ and here 's the link . 
  eos is greatly recommended . 
  i remember reading a great interview with you in an estonian computer magazine , ` arvutimaailm ' , back in 2005 or so . 
  thank you for the speech and greetings from across the sea !, 
  cobain should n't count , he cheated . 
  ** your mom is a classy lady !, 
  * who 's that riding in the sun ? 
  who 's the man with the itchy gun ? 
  who 's the man who kills for fun ? 
  psycho dad , psycho dad , psycho dad . 
  * he sleeps with a gun, 
  but he loves his son, 
  killed his wife ` cos she weighed a ton . 
  psycho dad , psycho dad , psycho dad . 
  * a little touched or so we 're told, 
  killed his wife ` cos she had a cold, 
  might as well she was gettin ' old, 
  psycho dad , psycho dad , psycho dad . 
  * he 's quick with a gun, 
  and his job ai n't done . 
  killed his wife by twenty-one ,, 
  psycho dad !, 
  it 's definitely interesting . 
  but interesting does not equal good . 
  thank you for this !, 
  now i can enjoy the game without the stuttering . 
  next time , ban spectre . 
  it 's like i 'm really watching a pub match !, 
  ( shadow fiend not dodging that max range mirana arrow that he had full sight of and then getting killed ), 
  this , but ctrl + skill number instead of clicking . 
  al sweated elvis !, 
  this reminds me of the sin city comics , and since those are awesome , this is awesome !, 
  speaking of lol comics ... 
  does anyone have that blitzcrank `` guide '' comic with `` do retarded sidestep '' ?
