   they get a lot of praise from people who do n't listen to/have any knowledge of jazz, 
  so where should i start if i want similar stuff ? 
  i liked the first two albums but really , really like iii . 
  did n't use it yet but i 'm sure it 'll come in handy one day . 
  thanks for posting !, 
  czarface was dope , there 's a second one in the works too . 
   any of y' all play d&d ? 
  i 'd like to . 
  a friend got really interested late last summer , so we tried to get our hands on a pathfinder beginner box ... finally got one in march . 
  played a session - well , we only managed to get through character creation - but now everybody is too busy with work/school/life to get together weekly or so ( me included ), 
  hopefully we 'll have more time during summer !, 
  wuz here , slightly over return of 4eva, 
  some ** estonian ** stuff :, 
  first two are old-school classics and the others are newish ... and the first 3 all feature the same dude , which shows how much i know about the local scene/how crappy it is :,

  i do n't listen to local stuff much but this is a great idea for a thread !, 
  taco salad is quick , easy and delicious :, 
  add however much minced meat you want to make to your pan, 
  start browning it, 
  add whatever spices you like ( salt , pepper & chili for me ), 
  add some chopped lettuce about halfway in, 
  eat once brown !, 
  optional but highly recommended : add shredded cheese , sour cream and some ( low-carb ) sauce, 
  ( copy-pasted from an older comment of mine ), 
  hmm , i have n't really had that problem ... 
  maybe try finding beef/pork with a higher fat percentage , add more greens and be sure to pour some of the grease onto the plate too . 
  he has shot a guy - who died - in self-defense , yes . 
  this is hilarious , wow . 
  you should post it on it 's own . 
  `` what type of ass is that ? 
  '' , `` let me see some piss '' , `` you mad !? '' ... 
  i think those kinds of people would enjoy at least one of these :,

  my favourite type of his songs , hype and dumb ( in a good way ) but not just him yelling with totally blown-out sound . 
  same here , unfortunately . 
  still get a ton of shitty bites just like previous years , before i got on the keto train . 
  almost always eating dinner at 6:30 pm and in bed by 1 am . 
  summertime is the exception , since i 'll probably be outside at the usual dinnertime , so i usually just grab some snacks after getting home . 
  sorry i ca n't help , but i 've got the same question about labels in estonia . 
  ours say , for example :, 
  carbohydrates 20g of which sugar 8g, 
  how do i count that ? 
  nope , nothing about fibre . 
  do n't recall seeing it being listed on anything . 
  i hope we get another raw-as-fuck track like [ live from fulton county jail ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi1q6cpzjdg ) from guwop . 
  you 've got a lot of catching up to do if you have n't paid attention to his output from last year . 
  awesom job dude !, 
  very inspiring !, 
  i 've been doing paleo for a few years now , so i 'm definitely never going to go back to a `` traditional '' diet ... but i might add back some fruit once i hit my goals and see how it goes . 
  i 'm guessing back in late 2012 when [ gucci tweeted about fighting anybody and game responded to him .

  [ yeah probably that stuff ... from back in late 2012 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob9qprwejrs ), 
  that 's the only thing ( i could find ) that it could be about though . 
  gucci just does n't give a fuck . 
  this looks awesome !, 
  have you got any videos available to show it in full-framerate glory ?

  [ gucci mane - get lost ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y26bpvco-q8 ), 
  my favourite stoner ep . 
  carter v , rtj 2 , flockaveli 2 , everything by gucci, 
  trap house 1 or chicken talk for older-style beats , trap back for modernish stuff , trap house 3 for a modern sound with a decent amount of autotune . 
  i am praying to the trap god that some artist gets inspired by this . 
  he can still rap with a deeper voice when he wants to , like on [ you song off dedication 5 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkowz0rfe7y ), 
  d5 has some pretty great tracks imo ( do n't kill , typa way , you song , pure colombia , uoeno ) , check it out . 
  well i 'm a wizard ... and that looks fucked up . 
  also cool . 
  the original is on one of the special herbs albums too , but i do n't recall hearing the re-release version beat before .

  glad you kept that glowing smile !, 
  great job , keep it up !, 
  guess i should finally check out that kendrick thing then since i fucking love 96 fuckries . 
  kind of not actually a happy song ( though it does sound sunny ) but [ lil b 's `` life 's hard '' always makes me smile .

  [ i really like wayne 's version off d2 too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hwlzogk4ay ), 
  great progress and post , you have a way with words !, 
  i can definitely relate to the points you brought out . 
  ( the ongoing process of ) losing weight/getting fitter has made me more confident and generally made me feel better about myself ... but it is not a simple cure-all for most of life 's problems . 
  hanging out with friends and not being able to eat/drink shit sucks , but i have to say that being able to resist makes me feel proud every time . 
  anyway , please keep us updated - would gladly read more of these kinds of posts . 
  ** lil ' wayne - dedication 2 & da drought 3 ** - these tapes are still incredibly good and anybody blindly hating on weezy ( seemingly not a lot of those people left here though ! ), 
  should listen to both of them . 
  ** waka flocka flame - i ca n't rap vol . 
  1 ** - a solid tape from waka . 
  listened through it once , do n't really recall anything special , maybe the chiraq remix . 
  ** mot\u00f6rhead - ace of spades & overkill ** - a double dose of classic loud , fast & heavy metal .
