  ** death - scream bloody gore ** - man , if i had been a teenage kid listening to this for the first time in 1987 ... fucking hell , just so raw and manic . 
  the beginning of death metal . 
  ** chance the rapper - acid rap ** - just a great and fun summer album . 
  ** slo burn - amusing the amazing ** - * the * best stoner rock ep , if not album , and summer is the best time to listen to stoner rock . 
  try it out if you like any hard rock ( or qotsa , for example ), 
  ** boris - heavy rocks ( 2002 ) ** - definitely in the running for best stoner rock album too . 
  the most russian-sounding japanese band name ever . 
  i want to be healthier than the last generation and to live a long and healthy life . 
  a visible adonis belt and abs would be nice too !, 
  shorter-term goals : i 've got a ( huge ) size s shirt and some shorts that are a number smaller ( 32 '' , currently wearing 33 '' shorts ) that i 'd like to rock . 
  saw them in estonia a couple of months ago , kick-ass show ( though did n't go on for quite as long as i 'd hoped ), 
  definitely recommended !, 
  yeah . 
   yeah it 's a stupid thing to get happy over and it 's probably pretty shallow of me, 
  fuck that , you have to feel good about yourself and there 's no better way than visible progress !, 
  i got some veins showing too but i 'm looking forward to them looking poppin ', 
  wish the ~ ~ gucci mane appreciation ~ ~ rap thread was a bit more active though . 
  ' i just discovered that album for myself a few months ago ^ ^ \u00ce 'm ^ ^ sorry and it sounds great , not dated at all . 
  i 've listened through it once ( compared to like twenty times of hhnf ) but did n't dig it as much , though i 'll surely listen to it more in the near future . 
  already got k.r.i.t. 
  wuz here & return of 4eva on vinyl and shipping to estonia for the vinyl bundle more than doubles the price . 
  same here . 
  unfortunately , they did n't go away after a few years of paleo nor have they gone away over the last five months of keto . 
  their intensity has varied a bit , but i have n't intensely `` tracked '' them to see if their related to not eating/eating something special . 
   stoner metal, 
  that [ new electric wizard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pefphekh96i ) track is promising !, 
  i want to live where you live . 
  where do you live ? 
  ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ creepy ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ all, 
  well , they 're sold by the kilo here , which i think is about 5 of them too . 
  3-4 $ for that . 
  super jealous . 
   i have stayed in `` trace '' or `` small '' keto level ( from the pee sticks ), 
  this means that you are in ketosis , any level does . 
  afaik , at least after a bit of time on keto , even no reading could mean that you are still in ketosis - it just gets really diluted if you drink a lot of water ( as you should ! ), 
  awesome progress by the way , keep it up !, 
  nice !, 
  i 've got blues and [ a blue-coloured bootleg ] ( http://www.discogs.com/kyuss-slo-burn-live-at-the-marquee-club-amusing-the-amazing/release/1432906 ) with some live tracks on one side and slo burn 's amusing the amazing ( best stoner ep imho ) on the other side . 
  libgdx is great ( coming from a fellow android dev ) , go for it .

  [ nobody ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu9zunao_pi ), 
  [ truth ( jeezy diss ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ycxuqjwag4 ) , in a way . 
  awesome !, 
  i saw the [ giant bomb quick look ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokrfcflr8k ) of it a while ago and they definitely enjoyed it . 
  [ there was a pretty good article on noisey recently about this .

  if you are a local of tallinn , yes , after a one-time purchase of a card for a few euros . 
  but if you 're from outside of town , you still have to pay to ride , so there are still ticket checking machines and attendants .

  wiz & ross ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyd_o4exu_k ) , [ sixteen switches part 2 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyz3z0vwys ) and this make up an incredible three-track run on that tape . 
  [ easy to find if you sort by top-rated comments .

  `` random , random stabbings , not just regular ones . '', 
  that 's a great concept . 
  this is really cool , much appreciated !, 
  java ( using libgdx framework ) for the programming part, 
  photoshop for handling art, 
  audacity for basic audio manipulation, 
  reaper or [ jxfr ] ( http://jfxr.frozenfractal.com/ ) for audio creation, 
  have poked around in unity a bit and probably will do so more in the future . 
  kiss your dad square on the lips .

  try not to be disappointed if you do n't get results as quick as you did last time . 
  if possible , remove any food-distractions from your fridges and cupboards . 
  out of sight , out of mind . 
  basically , like / u/modernpreacher said - just do it . 
  good luck !, 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ know ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ joking ^ ^ ^ but he 's got a ton of projects actually , i 'd recommend the `` drunk 'n' high '' album if you can find it . 
  [ turn up the volume knob ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwyg4u4havi ) is a pretty great track off it ( the other tracks have a more traditional production style though ), 
  great stuff , seen it a few times before , but have n't read much yet . 
  speaking of - any plans to pack it into a file that an e-reader could use ( . mobi , . epub or even . pdf ) ? 
  not a fan of reading a lot of text on a computer screen , so i usually send stuff to my kindle , but sending every page separately is kind of a pain . 
  ( hope i do n't come off as too ungrateful ), 
  not supporting your child is pretty spooky, 
  he 's on three songs and actually not bad on those , imo . 
  well , i suppose the dj-drop-like `` rich gang '' in the background of every song every 30 seconds might be kinda annoying . 
  there 's now a demo , for both last - and current-gen consoles . 
  if you buy the full version , you keep your progress . 
  i tried out the ps3 version yesterday . 
  it played alright ( fps was not that great though ) but it was so damn blurry that i felt like i needed glasses . 
  [ i did that , here 's a link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/17ksgi/gucci_mane_is_attending_career_day_at_an_atlanta/c86jq1v?context=3 ), 
  i was hoping for more stuff like the chiraq remix where he just goes in for a single verse through a whole song ( like wayne used to do ) , but we got the regular verse/hook structure for most of it . 
  his hooks are alright , but they 're just generic imo . 
  listen to the new sd album for dope hook/verse stuff . 
  that 's a shame , that tape is one of my faves this year . 
  i 'm guessing a lot of people avoided it due to the birdman association , but he 's only on three songs ... and not bad on them !, 
  ( well , unless you count the `` rich gang '' drop in the background of every track every half a minute ), 
  i like it too , actually, 
  cut like half the songs ( i 'd keep all the ones with birdman verses though , some of the best imo ) and it 'd be a super-solid ten track project . 
  great job !, 
  trap house 3 is one of gucci 's best projects , check it out !, 
  the official title ( on polygon 's website ) of `` let 's write erotic alf fiction together in elegy for a dead world '' is a bit more enticing . 
  i 've been using this recipe for a while , love it !, 
  i also usually add a bit of baking powder too , to make them slightly puffier .
