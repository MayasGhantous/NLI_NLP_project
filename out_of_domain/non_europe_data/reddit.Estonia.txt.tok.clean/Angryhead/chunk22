  these work best as a wrapper for cheese or ham for me . 
  awesome progress and awesome shirts !, 
  the delivery on that line is what makes it so damn effective . 
  this is a k.r.i.t.-ass beat , immediately recognizable as his sound . 
  ... maybe it 's just because the main sample is krit saying `` rob me a nigga '' , now that i think about it . 
  but also the soulful melody ( violin ? ), 
  playing while the beat also has hard-hitting drums . 
  great job man !, 
  what do you normally eat in a day ? 
  any exercising ? 
  zaytoven is a fucking legend and i 've enjoyed all of the young dolph stuff i 've heard so far ( which is admittedly not that much ), 
  love this behind-the-scenes stuff . 
  listened south memphis kingpin a week ago , was pretty good . 
  thanks for the recommendations , will check them out . 
  features on gucci 's stuff mostly . 
  really liked the whole felix brothers project . 
  still have n't properly checked out that collab tape , east atlanta memphis . 
  cool !, 
  will try it out over the weekend . 
  yup , no official merch . 
  bummer . 
  [ soundcloud link ] ( https://soundcloud.com/metroboomin/ilovemakonnen-maneuvering-prod-by-metro-boomin ), 
  damn right !, 
  the telephone video is amazing , got a b & w poster of gaga with the telephone hat on up on my wall . 
  i registered in early 2013 and it was definitely 25 $ back then ... so it 's been like that for a while . 
  i laughed out loud when they showed gucci and it was captioned as, 
   trap god, 
  and then once again when they rapped versace a-capella . 
  imo , `` pure columbia '' was the best off d5 and `` trap house '' is the best off this so i 'm super glad he went for these, 
  easiest to just listen to the entire trap house 3 album . 
  great all the way through if you like the sound gucci has had the last few years . 
  so how did they taste ? 
  dope , i assume ? 
  i was kinda disappointed the first time i heard that said out loud , since i always imagined `` before the cash '' instead . 
  damn , most of this is word-for-word the same as the interview article noisey posted with coach k. 
  [ part 1 ] ( http://noisey.vice.com/blog/coach-k-interview-noisey-atlanta-gucci-mane-migos-qc ) , [ part 2 ] ( http://noisey.vice.com/blog/coach-k-interview-part-2-young-jeezy-gucci-mane-pastor-troy-the-rise-of-modern-atlanta ) . 
  definitely worth reading if you want to go a bit more in-depth ( though maybe they 'll go into the other parts of those in later parts of the show ) . 
  coach k mentions a gucci track named `` fork in the pot '' , anybody got a link to that ? 
  could n't find anything named that on google . 
  that part was great , almost like a toned-down tim & eric sketch . 
  [ i wonder if there are any similarities to `` buscemi !, 
  a game for kids '' ?

  ** joey bada $ $ - b4.da . $ $ ** - listened through the album twice , solid stuff . 
  not huge on joey generally , but i think i 'll give his older projects another chance now . 
  ** paul leonard-morgan - dredd ost ** - great electronic instrumental background stuff for programming . 
  ** migos - no label 2 ** - migos are just pure fun to listen to . 
  i keep `` discovering '' single songs off their projects and then listening to those a lot . 
  this week it was `` no fuckin ' wit '' . 
  ** dr. dre - 2001 ** - just a fucking classic , no more words needed . 
  ** mf doom - operation doomsday & mm ... food ** - same , just classics but i have to give extra props to doom 's production , which i absolutely love . 
  ** death grips - no love deep web ** - album shuffle is my favourite way to listen to music , leads me to listen to stuff i forgot i really liked again . 
  `` deep web '' is especially great . 
  ** uz - balltrap muzic vol . 
  1 ** - crossover trap with rappers spitting over it . 
  great party music ( even though i listened to it while at work ), 
  ** young dolph - south memphis kingpin ** - i love dolph 's , err , mannerisms ? 
  the way he raps ? 
  i 'm not sure how to express myself , english is not my first language . 
  i just love his `` uuuuh-uuuuh '' adlib . 
  nothing extraordinarily great , just solid trapping all the way through . 
  that 's what i usually do with albums , but i have n't actually listened to the last third or so ... 
  i 'll do that tomorrow . 
  ah yeah , sure . 
  i find the same to be true for almost all trap albums . 
  migos even has the advantage of having three different voices on every track , to keep it more varied . 
  what headphones did you get , op ? 
  i got these [ german maestro 8.35 d ] ( http://www.german-maestro.de/en/gmp835dmonitor.htm ) headphones some months ago , they 're awesome . 
  saw them being compared to like 400 $ headphones from well-known companies , but got them for under 200 $ . 
  that might seem like a lot to pay for headphones but i wear them all-day at work and most of the time at home too , so i figure it was a worthy investment . 
  [ jose guapo got to it first . 
  your videos ( and recipes on the site ) are great !, 
  the text recipe for the muffins inspired me to order those silicone molds just last week , have n't tried them out yet though . 
  awesome , ca n't wait . 
  d5 had some great tracks imo , for anybody who missed it - pure colombia , uoeno , you song to name some of them, 
  yeah , that 'd been next on my personal list , but i thought i 'd stick with three . 
  great stuff dude , thanks for the effort & sharing .

  great songs to go dumb to .

  * blackenedwhite , enter the wu-tang ( 36 chambers ) , 2001 , run the jewels 2 , no love deep web [ it 's got a dick on it ], 
  a shitty picture of the collection and closeups of some of the cooler-looking and perhaps not as widely known records . 
  they 're not actually hung up on a wall or whatever ( i keep them on a shelf , out of the way of direct sunlight ) , just laid them out on my bed to take the pictures . 
  looking forward to them album . 
  [ 21.35 $ with shipping . 
  ] ( http://www.vinyl-digital.com/en/rock-indie/classic-rock/exmilitary-black-vinyl.html?listtype=search&amp;searchparam=exmilitary ), 
  it 's a bootleg , but i figured i 'd like to add it to my grips collection - and i 'm not about to pay the insane prices for the originals . 
  sorry , have n't had a chance to listen to it yet - just got it a few weeks ago and something 's been wrong with my record player for a while . 
  [ links here , depending on your region ] ( http://www.teasearecords.net/wu-vs-beatles ), 
  it 's an awesome album . 
  17 $ ( with shipping to europe ) on amazon ( us ) - back in 2012 . 
  i oncse sent an e-mail to lil b about how i was playing ( the whole day for a few days ) diablo 3 and trying to kill diablo herself ( on inferno difficulty , a day before they nerfed it ) and when i finally did it , this was the song that i was listening to at that moment . 
  i truly beat the odds . 
  [ the adventure zone ] ( http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone ) is hilarious and the only one i 've stuck to .
