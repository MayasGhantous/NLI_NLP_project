  no problem , glad to share !, 
  definitely check out `` my brother , my brother and me '' too if you like the brothers ' style of humor . 
  ca n't find it anymore but there was a thread with the title along the lines of `` note that this album means drake has fulfilled his contract to cash money '' hours after the release of it in / r/hhh, 
  somebody tell me that i 'm not crazy because i 'm unable to find it through the search now . 
  the last tiny prototype i made used a seed system , so yeah , it was repeatable . 
  [ this time with a feature from lil b ( the based god , not some off-brand dude ) on a track with some cool production ( but meh verses ) ] ( https://soundcloud.com/noisey/rolling-stone-feat-lil-b-the/s-w6xrg ), 
   they were shit when dedication 2 dropped, 
  [ where da cash at ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_mm_ey2jee ) though , personally i really love drama 's shit-talking at the start . 
  how the fuck ? 
  would this work with pork instead of beef ? 
  any big differences in micronutrients ? 
  from the [ 2 chainz - used 2 music video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqehmt7aj44 ), 
  not the op but i 'll reply anyway :, 
  it 's my fifth viewing and i think they did a great job , have n't seen much that would annoy me or look off ( up to the middle of s4 ) . 
  heh , no problem with a lack of fat on pork over here in estonia - the cheapest cuts - 2.8 $ / kg , so about 1.4 $ / lb - are sold in ~ 2-pound chunks and have a nice , fat layer of fat . 
  pork belly , i think . 
  might have to try this out , but i 'm a bit worried about lacking some vitamins or whatever . 
  cyber city oedo 808 is an awesome ( ly rad ) cyberpunk anime series too . 
  a shame that there 's only 3 episodes of it . 
  now i do n't feel like such a dumbass for also reading it like that at first . 
  yeah , great job !, 
   how is that cool to the fans that there is a wu-tang album that everyone reading this forum post will be dead by the time it drops ? 
  * insert joke about the average / r/hhh member being 10 years old here *, 
  very informative post , thanks . 
  nice !, 
  i 've got blues from the red sun & a bootleg on blue vinyl that has some kyuss live tracks on one side and the slo burn ep on the other side . 
  i have n't listened to it in a while ( my old-ass soviet-era record player stopped working a few months ago and i have n't afforded a new one yet ) but i do n't remember any problems with it . 
  worth it for the amazing slo burn ep , probably my fave stoner project . 
  [ hope you have 150 $ to spend ] ( http://thecamkirk.bigcartel.com/product/trap-god-by-cam-kirk ), 
  maybe it 's because i 'm not a native speaker , but it feels more natural to type it `` 150 $ '' because you say `` a hundred and fifty dollars '' ( at least in that sentence ) . 
  but thanks , i 'll try to keep that in mind . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's [ sean paine , his engineer . 
  yes , of course, 
  this is very cool , great job !, 
  it 's a great series ... but it 's about metal , not hip-hop , from the nola . 
  check it out if you 've got any interest in that . 
  my personal top 3 :, 
  trap house 3 ( well , it 's an album , but it 's imo * the * most consistent project from him ) , trap back and mr. 
  zone 6 . 
  add on chicken talk or the original trap house if you 'd like to try some old-school ( mid-2000s ) gucci . 
  well - am i the only one who really likes this ? 
  going to test too because ... - am i the only one who likes testing in / r/test ? 
  am i the only one who - just a test bruh, 
  these djs are chill as all hell , damn , loving it . 
  thanks for sharing . 
  oh god that is absolutely decadent and amazing, 
  awesome collection !, 
  special herbs is such a great series , doom makes some chill-ass but also interesting beats . 
  [ too long for a straight-up comment , hope a pastebin link works for you !, 
  ca n't speak for op but i just never looked at it for more than a second . 
  `` oh it 's the letter ` i ' and some hands making a heart on both sides , whatever '', 
  ghee tastes great , give it a shot . 
  [ set my record player up yesterday . 
  audio-technica at-lp120-usb record player . 
  fiio e09k headphone amplifier ( missing from picture ), 
  german maestro 8.35 d headphones . 
  and i received the sour soul vinyl today . 
  sounded good to me !, 
  [ posted my hip-hop collection a while back ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopvinyl/comments/2uv4py/hiphop_selection_from_my_collection/ ) , do n't think there 's been anything added since besides sour soul . 
  ca n't wait for the powers that b to arrive . 
  that site is cool , i got a [ doom hoodie ] ( http://www.mymainmanpat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/crew-if-i-ruled-on-white.png ) from there a while back . 
  i 've got a copy of college dropout that sounds pretty good to me . 
  and the third track ( `` graduation day '' ) does n't have a skit/dude talking in the beginning , just the music , found that kinda cool . 
  e : tho yeah , i 've heard that mbdtf sounds terrible on vinyl , which is a shame , since the packaging is pretty cool . 
  `` i wonder '' is so goddamn sad . 
  actually just got the amp today and uh , it 's my first amp , so not a lot of comparison points . 
  listened to a few records ( sour soul , exmilitary bootleg ) and they sounded good . 
  it sure works for turning up the volume real loud , hah !, 
  madvillainy should n't be hard to find and i think it sounds great . 
  thanks !, 
  see you got that doom flair too !, 
  ( i had a lil b one before they removed the one i liked , heh ), 
  there are n't many record stores around where i live - estonia - especially ones that would carry hip-hop . 
  i think i picked the doom records up on separate visits to a record store in stockholm ... 
  i 've mostly bought from amazon or just straight from smaller labels . 
  takes a while to arrive but i 've very rarerly had problems related to packaging . 
  some corners might dented a bit , sure , but i 'm not too picky about that , as long as the record does n't skip around . 
  as the other dude said - it 's an ikea kallax shelf . 
  googling for `` brad jeff drew dan '' would have probably given you the answer too . 
  maybe it 's because she is 90 years old and does n't give a fuck anymore, 
  reminds me of the mechs from tiberian sun . 
  cool !, 
  german maestro 8.35 d. 
  very satisfied with them . 
  their sound is so damn good and their songs are heavy while also being really groovy . 
  [ the other baracka flacka flame video is great too . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dayxkvdnj0u ), 
  actually dig the music on that one ... ( love the original hard in da paint too ), 
  a very fine choice . 
  here 's to many more !, 
  [ user : angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  ** billy woods - today , i wrote nothing ** - excellent underground rap in the style of madvillainy - a bunch of short songs with great lyrics and varied production , even sampling madvillainy ( and the wire ! ), 
  on a track . 
  a shame that i have n't seen any mention of it on here , it 's in the running for my aoty for sure . 
  there might be a few tracks on youtube but it 's the kind of thing you should listen to in it 's entirety . 
  it 's available on spotify . 
  ** young thug - barter 6 ** - pretty good , but it 's nowhere near as good as the rich gang tape , imho . 
  `` just might be '' is excellent straight-up rapping . 
  ** kendrick lamar - to pimp a butterfly ** - i like it , but i much prefer gkmc . 
  do n't have much to add to the discussion .
