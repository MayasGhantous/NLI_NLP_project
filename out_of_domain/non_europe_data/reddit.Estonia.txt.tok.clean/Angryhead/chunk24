  ** young thug - 1017 thug ** - i actually listened to this for the first time after hearing barter 6 and it 's pretty great . 
  `` jungle '' with gucci was the standout track for me . 
  ** weedeater - god luck and good speed ** - really fucking heavy yet groovy stoner/sludge/weed metal . 
  celebrated 4/20 by listening to it a few times , love their sound . 
  ** big k.r.i.t. 
  - k.r.i.t. 
  wuz here ** - super-solid stuff , krit 's best along with return of 4eva imo . 
  chill-ass music . 
  ** billy woods - history will absolve me ** - also a great album from billy woods . 
  have n't listened to it enough . 
  ** kanye west - graduation ** - this was one of the albums that really got me into hip-hop , so it both has a special place in my heart and i 'm kinda sick of hearing it , so i do n't listen to it very frequently and i would stick it near the end of my `` best kanye albums '' list . 
  ** czarface - czarface ** - heard news of their second album coming in june so i listened to this again ... and it 's still dope . 
  but seriously , listen to ** today , i wrote nothing ** . 
  i even bought a collection of short stories by daniil kharms that has the same name as the album and they 're damn hilarious & absurd . 
  what are you favourite tracks on young thugga mane la flare ? 
  i 've probably listened to it front-to-back once , but really only like `` bricks '' off it - though i like that one track * a lot . 
  ah shit , missed this thread . 
  s/o to the sa rap thread for loving this album . 
  love it , definitely feels a lot like madvillainy , very similar structure . 
  definitely in the running for aoty for me . 
  did you like future 's album from last year , honest ? 
  i really liked that album but have n't got into the recent mixtapes as much . 
  listened to all of them at least once but then ... meh . 
  rich gang was probably my second-favourite release from last year ( next to rtj2 ) and i 'd easily cut out at least five tracks too , but half ( or more ) of the tracks are just incredible . 
  not sure exactly what tracks you are referring to on exmilitary , but i love all of it . 
  `` klink '' is in the middle and i probably love it in a large part for the `` rise above '' sample , gives me a lot of nostalgic feelings because it was in a ps1 skateboarding game , grind session . 
  do you like the other death grips projects ? 
  have you checked out / r/zerocarb ? 
  the billy woods album - today , i wrote nothing - is excellent . 
  very much in the vein of madvillainy - a lot of short songs with weird beats and dope , hard-hitting lyricism . 
  also wondering this , and i 've got an even shittier pc :, 
  i5-3210m , 2.5 ghz ( 2 cores ), 
  nvidia gt 630m 2 gb . 
  should meet the minimum specs but i wonder if that means it 's actually playable at a decent framerate .

  ( some stuff copied from previous weeks ), 
  ** jme - integrity  ** - listened through it 4 times , it 's good . 
  some tracks are weaker , and some tracks - `` calm '' and especially `` 96 fuckries '' are way better than anything else , imo . 
  want to get more into grime though , if everybody has suggestions for stuff that sounds like those tracks ( or skepta 's `` that ` snotme '' ) . 
  ** billy woods - today , i wrote nothing ** - excellent underground rap in the style of madvillainy - a bunch of short songs with great lyrics and varied production , even sampling madvillainy ( and the wire ! ), 
  on a track . 
  a shame that i have n't seen any mention of it on here , it 's in the running for my aoty for sure . 
  there might be a few tracks on youtube but it 's the kind of thing you should listen to in it 's entirety . 
  it 's available on spotify . 
  ** genka/paul oja - s/t ** - estonian hip-hop , entirely in estonian . 
  genka is * the * og local rapper and has great and funny lyricism and a pretty dope flow . 
  unfortunately i do n't think anybody wants to listen to rap they do n't understand !, 
  [ maybe check out this video from it though , it 's kinda cool . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjkhc0dwxc4 ) even though it 's of the remix that has a couple of other rappers added ( genka is the first one rapping ) . 
  really like `` bonnoroo '' , `` commitment issues '' , `` doe active '' & `` dope walk '' . 
  ** mf doom - vaudeville villain / unexpected guests / mm ... food ** - i think doom just might be my favorite hip-hop artist overall . 
  just amazing production ( even though he did nothing on vv ) and rapping . 
  i also really appreciate the way he very clearly says ( pronounces ? 
  idk what the words are ) the words , since english is not my first language , makes it easier for me to understand . 
  probably why i put more focus on the beats than on the lyrics in most stuff . 
  ** death grips - niggas on the moon / no love deep web ** - love grips . 
  did n't like notm much when it came out , but now enjoy it quite a lot . 
  but seriously , listen to ** today , i wrote nothing ** . 
  i even bought a collection of short stories by daniil kharms that has the same name as the album and they 're damn hilarious & absurd . 
  thanks for the rec , will try and check it out soon !, 
  have to say that i have n't even listened to dour candy yet . 
  history will absolve me got a few spins , like it , but not quite as much as today ,, 
  wonder if bambam is a fan of mbmbam . 
  estonia , android app/game developer . 
  got a group of friends with whom we all enjoy giant bomb 's stuff . 
  you probably just have to untick the small `` download with sharebeast downloader '' under the big download button . 
  yeah , same here ... currently vibing to bistro . 
  laying back and having a good time , as instructed . 
  [ the remix with bun b & project pat is also dope ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hev7zmlrw2m ), 
   rope around my neck and kick the ladder out, 
  [ sampled on billy woods ' `` dark woods '' track . 
  of course it does , why would anyone lie on the internet ? 
  rooftop, 
  plain jane, 
  nuthin ' on ya, 
  swing my door, 
  but there 's way too many songs i 'd like to also name, 
  this is great , very nice job !, 
  [ user : angryhead ] ( http://www.last.fm/user/angryhead ), 
  after really loving ** today , i wrote nothing ** ( still waiting on that vinyl to get pressed/shipped ) , i started checking out older ** billy woods ** stuff . 
  had listened to ** history will absolve me ** and really like it , though not as quite as much as nothing ( which is probably my aoty so far ) . 
  ** dour candy ** also seemed great , based on one listen . 
  definitely going to give this one more spins soon . 
  ** camouflage ** is his first album and it shows . 
  the general style is mostly there , but it 's just rougher and everything is just generally weaker . 
  still worth checking out if you 've exhausted everything else from him , i suppose , it 's definitely not * bad * . 
  ** mf doom ** is definitely a major influence for woods . 
  ** operation doomsday ** is an incredible ( solo ) debut . 
  although the sound quality is a bit rough compared to later stuff the lyricism and beats make up for it . 
  god damn , i love mf 's production , especially weird stuff like `` hey ! '' . 
  i actually just listened to ** the mouse and the mask ** for the first time yesterday . 
  it 's pretty good ... but there were a lot of skits and i did n't enjoy them at all . 
  not a fan of the high-pitched voices and the humor just was n't hitting for me . 
  ** take me to your leader ** is another classic to me - even though geedorah himself does n't rap on most of it the guest rappers are mostly pretty great ( or even fantastik in one case , \u00f5h\u00f5h\u00f5 ) and the beats are incredible . 
  the tracks that only consist of movie samples are also great . 
  ** a$ ap rocky 's alla ** is definitely good based on one listen . 
  always been a fan of rocky ( hell , i even really liked about a third-to-half of the mob mixtape ) and he seems to be sticking to his guns on this one . 
  glad to see bones on a track , even though i 've not gotten hugely into him ( yet , just downloaded a bunch of his tapes ), 
  `` trap queen '' does n't get played on radio over here - not that i listen to the radio in any case - but i enjoyed it so i grabbed ** fetty wap 's up next ** since hhh seemed to be saying that it 's his . 
  `` trap queen '' definitely seems like the highlight , nothing else really jumped out to me .
