  ** the appeal ** is a gucci album i had somehow never listened to before and i corrected that mistake today . 
  but as has been the case with every other gucci album - the mixtapes are better , since they have none of the poppy songs that are pretty meh . 
  always loved `` makin ' love to the money '' , off the mr. 
  zone 6 tape ( which also has my most played and underrated gucci song , `` rooftop '' ), 
  i just have to say that the top row has a very nice aesthetic actually , haha . 
  what 's the earl sweatshirt project ? 
  i see that you 've listened to the future tapes a lot , but did you check out his album from last year , `` honest '' ? 
  thought it was better than the tapes . 
  speaking of grime : i 've been meaning to get into it for a long time , my way in has been jme . 
  ** integrity  ** just came out a few weeks back and it has some pretty great tracks ( `` 96 fuckries '' , `` work '' , `` calm '' , `` integrity '' are the standouts imo ) if you want to check out some new grime . 
  i 've listened to ** boy in da corner ** a while ago but did n't really get into it , i should probably give it another shot . 
  i just saw ** heavy rocks ** and had to listen to it again . 
  so fucking good , definitely one of my favorite stoner rock albums . 
  have n't looked into their other works much though , \u00e0nything that sounds like heavy rocks ( 2002 ) ? 
  yeah , i 'm trying to get to that stuff too . 
  listened to ** furtive movements ** a few days ago , it was cool . 
  definitely enjoyed his features on woods ' stuff . 
  nah , i actually do really like it . 
  enjoy the comic book skits on that one . 
  as i said , the humor on mask just was n't hitting for me . 
  i 'll give it another go sometime soon , maybe i 'll dig it more . 
  glad you mentioned the billy woods album . 
  love it , probably my aoty so far . 
  very cool of you to do this , got a few downloads going of stuff i had n't heard come out . 
  appreciate the links and the descriptions very much . 
  looked at your previous list but what is essentially just a genre descriptor ( like `` jazzy hip-hop '' for tpab ) did n't give me much motivation to actually dl/buy stuff , but the micro-reviews in the new one are great . 
  it was the album that got me into him , so i 've listened to it the most , but also think it 's the best . 
  slowly going through his back catalogue . 
  history will absolve me & dour candy are also very good , not that into camouflage . 
  have n't managed to listen to much armand hammer or the super chron flight brothers stuff yet . 
  only one i can be confident in naming is doom - the album is very much like madvillainy in structure . 
  dense lyricism , interesting beats and a bunch of short tracks that are n't really connected . 
  the track `` borrowed time '' even samples that line ( the opening to `` accordion '' ) and tells a great , sad story in a few bars . 
  now i want to see somebody freestyle off the top on top of a traffic light pole . 
  check out billy woods - today , i wrote nothing is my favourite , but history will absolve me and dour candy are also great . 
  some sample tracks :, 
  [ `` flatlands '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgubi5fdidu ), 
  [ `` duck hunt '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4awilnvxyq ), 
  [ `` the undercard '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znvlfk16nxc ), 
  huh , did n't know pirados was a thing outside of estonia . 
  today , i wrote nothing by billy woods is my contender for aoty so far . 
  going with `` eye '' right now - just so smooth . 
  ask me on another day and you might get another answer though , it 's all great . 
  would be weird to say `` bistro '' but god damn , it is also so damn smooth . 
   gucci 's a much better lyricist than most give him credit for , and it always surprises me on this tape . 
  this sub might give him some credit for that , but he definitely should get more love for them overall . 
  he is good at making up great-dumb metaphors which leads to a lot of really funny lines . 
  and `` swing my door '' is the goat subwoofer rattler . 
   he works well over some more traditional beats like in dreams come true, 
  yeah , too bad that it 's only 46 seconds long , haha ( nah , it 's actually perfect the way it is ), 
  today , i wrote nothing is my contender for aoty , but that 's where i started with his stuff . 
  have listened to dour candy once ( liked it , need to find time to listen to it mroe ) and history will absolve me a bunch ( definitely agree with the middle being the weakest part ), 
  today , i wrote nothing is a lot like madvillainy imo - weird beats , abstract lyrics , short unconnected tracks - so that 's kinda weird that you ca n't get into it . 
  ah , the_legend_and_tupac . jpg, 
  you ca n't just say that and not link it , man !, 
  [ always preferred the original , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3axo1ngltm ) off of blackland radio . 
  grimier and purrp sounds more aggressive . 
  yeah , that was bothering me too , so i edited it a bit :, 
  just listened to madvillainy 2 for the first time today and it did n't do much for me . 
  but i can almost never get into remixes of tracks i 've already heard a bunch of times . 
  integrity  is a very enjoyable album , give it a shot if you like this .

  chwck out billy woods ' discography, 
  billy woods, 
  copped that album on vinyl recently , damn good stuff , love billy woods , he is criminally underrated/unknown ( amongst underground rappers ), 
  not that big of a fan of this track but his body of work ^ ^ ^ ^ huehue is great . 
  surprised there 's no mention of billy woods 's today , i wrote nothing . 
  love that album . 
  days with dr. 
  yen lo is very good also though . 
  billy woods is who i recommend to anyone that listens . 
  start with history will absolve me or today , i wrote nothing . 
  though pretty much all of his stuff is great ( and also the group projects he has been a part of , super chron flight brothers & armand hammer are the most prolific ones ), 
  to be fair , * all * of the promo spots suck . 
  dope mash-up of this in dj hero, 
  try this track , no downtime . 
  it 's got a really groovy beat ( and a cool video ), 
  gibbs ' `` 10 times '' has both gucci & e-40 on it . 
  it 's like listening to the dedication series - it just feels wrong without dj drama talking his shit all the time . 
  [ the realest summerjams by taswell ] ( https://play.spotify.com/user/taswell/playlist/26eezkxxu2kzklmtvdf8he ), 
  let 's not forget [ lil b - free lil wayne ] ( https://youtu.be/uywoxniwyhy ) . 
  makes me wonder if their collab was related to this track . 
  4 years `` hey , remember fuuture ? '', 
  looks like a very comfy place #skate 4, 
   make sure you have an idea of the type of game you want to make . 
  nah , do n't let this discourage you . 
  i registered , had the phone interview and my plans were nothing more than `` uhh , not sure , maybe i 'll port something i 've made previously or make something new ? '', 
  and i got access . 
  so not having a concrete plan is not a detriment , at least in my experience . 
  [ definitely not what you meant but it reminded me of this das racist interview/track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvl0wz3_-ee ), 
  [ such a lovely smile . 
  the introspective parts of this song remind me [ `` worst enemy '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzgn_-vvii ) , love that track .
