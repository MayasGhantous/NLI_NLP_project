  if you want to give him a chance :, 
  if you want the classic trap old-school trap sound he helped originate - chicken talk, 
  if you want the early 2010-s trap sound - trap back, 
  if you want the modern trap sound - trap house 3, 
  but ask any other gucci fan and you 'll probably get different answers . 
  and fwiw i 'm an extremely white kid in an extremely white country and i just like his music . 
  not in some dumb ironic way . 
  to be honest - at least for me - gucci is not the kind of dude that puts out projects to listen to start-to-end repeatedly . 
  most of them are like a solid 6/10 so just pick out the standout tracks , add them to your playlist and move on . 
  trap house 3 is the only project of his i think is great all the way through . 
  it 's got great features ( including a pre-blowing-up young thug ) an introspective track or two and the beats are varied enough ( d.i.g. 
  is too damn dirty ), 
  not like i 've listened to all of his stuff either though , haha , but probably at least half of it . 
  [ gucci mane - truth ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2wbtrvskci ), 
  0:54 for the relevant line ( but listen to the whole thing since it 's hard ), 
  at least on mac , seems like vuforia does n't work in-editor anymore . 
  no problems when deploying to device .

  [ `` all nas need is one mic / all i need is one stove / homie got a nice flow / but gucci got that white coke '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbsdysw778o&amp;t=45s ) always makes me laugh . 
  do you have any track names for stuff he produced ( especially looking for lil b ) ? 
  the beat to [ zenith ( feat . 
  joey bada $ $ ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7gde8mdh3y ) is hella chill and what i 'm hoping the bbng collab will produce . 
  [ young dolph - play wit yo bitch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uukayi_qpty ), 
  i go bouldering at an indoor gym two-three times a week ( for a total of about 4 hours per week ), 
  i 'm not sure if he was in prison at the time but he also dropped the three cold war mixtapes ( part 1 : guccimerica , part 2 : great brrritain & part 3 : brrrussia ) on one day , october 17 , 2009 . 
  trick question : it 's persona 4 . 
  loved his work on dour candy , solo stuff of his i 've listened to has been nice too . 
  hoping this comes to streaming services .

  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgknlewjxzc ), 
  i know i went from never being able to do a pull-up to a few after a few months of bouldering 2-3 times a week . 
  could probably bust out a few more if i actually focused on them instead of sometimes trying to do some at the end of a session . 
  one of the dopest dudes around . 
  this does not disappoint . 
  ** escape from aeon **, 
  hi thread , it 's been a while . 
  my development partner / u/ghostknot posted here about 6 months ago but here i am now with some updates . 
  this week mostly spent on adding [ a splash screen/intro logo ] ( https://gfycat.com/dapperoddfieldmouse ) and a [ simple main menu with a sweet rotating tower ] ( https://gfycat.com/lastpointlessalligatorsnappingturtle ) . 
  and made it so that every generated & valid map [ gets saved into a . png ] ( http://imgur.com/a/7uxy4 ) so that i can marvel at them later . 
  should hook it up to a twitter bot now ... 
  also a fun bug : [ added destructible walls back in . 
  ] ( https://gfycat.com/welltodofelinebooby ) what do you mean that anything that gets killed/destroyed spawns blood , loot & a corpse ? 
  anyway , escape from aeon is a sci-fi horrorish roguelike focusing on ranged combat that 's not just `` one action is a turn '' but using a action points like the old fallout games , for example . 
  built in unity , using [ entitas ] ( https://github.com/sschmid/entitas-csharp ) for ecs . 
  our progress has been pretty steady , both of us are working on this from our off-time and defo not dedicating all hours to it . 
  my current plans for upcoming weeks are to work on the map generation and ai ( the two rabbit holes that you can endlessly go into ) . 
  right now there 's some bugs ( features ? ), 
  with overlapping rooms that can generate huge open fields , ranged combat perhaps not the funnest in that kind of an environment . 
  would like to set the stage for prefab rooms as well , since we currently have none but it seems like it would be a good thing to add to the flavor . 
  ai - well , if we have an action point style combat system , then a smarter , tactical ai is in order to take advantage of it . 
  otherwise the player can pretty easily juke the enemies , even if that is not the most fun way to play . 
  a lot still left to be discovered and discussed and tested in regards to that . 
  [ young thug will bring my father back ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivu3qw7lr5o ), 
  cool stuff man , love that first picture of gucci , dude looks so happy , 
  for gucci :, 
  you want that old-school trap sound ? 
  chicken talk, 
  you want that turn of the decade/lex luger-era trap sound ? 
  zone 6, 
  you want that thugger-enhanced trap sound ? 
  trap house 3, 
  i 'm a big gucci fan but honestly i do n't think he has any project that is absolutely great end-to-end , but he has a huge catalogue of great tracks . 
  trap house 3 is the most consistent overall , imo . 
  for pusha t :, 
  i envy you if you have n't listened to clipse yet . 
  hell hath no fury is amazing , lord willin ' and we got it 4 cheap , vol . 
  2 are also really really good .
