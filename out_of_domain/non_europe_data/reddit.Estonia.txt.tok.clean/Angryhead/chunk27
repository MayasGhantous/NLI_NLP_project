  the most underrated dude out . 
  album is dope . 
  well you got the top two right , for sure . 
  short & sweet wins in my book . 
  the fortune street tnt is long but totally amazing . 
  bitch mob : respect da bitch vol . 
  1 had some real bangers on it . 
  salute to the bitch , shake ya booty , please respect the bitch , my life , i need the based , rock 4sho , back of yo neck , bill bellamy ... 
  billy woods and ka ? 
  my dude . 
  known unknowns is such a dope album . 
  i 've been having a lot of itching on my shoulders lately , though i think it 's mostly related to me getting sunburnt a lot like a month ago . 
  nothing special about the boys though , haha . 
  been mostly zc for about 8 months . 
  this is the run : prison break, 
   i feel like you less go to lil b for good music and more go to lil b for interesting and weird music , but maybe that 's just me . 
  same here . 
  this album is certainly the most consistently `` competent '' from lil b ( even just for the improved microphone quality ! ), 
  but i think a lot of this album is just kinda ... boring . 
  competent , but not very interesting . 
  i dunno man , lil b is by far my most played artist and that 's how i felt . 
  6 kiss still # 1, 
  this is a classic but i 'm also a fan of [ lil b ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=it_azwop1ea ) and [ spaceghostpurrp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcofoajqen8 ) versions of rapping over this track too .

  this time , a post from the programmer side , as opposed to being from the designer ( / u/ghostknot ) . 
  i 'm surprised at how much i 've commited over the last week when i look at the log , sine it feels like i just spent a bunch of time making keyboard-friendly ui navigation work . 
  mostly for our vendor & recycling machines , [ for which the ui looks like this right now ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5uzvvqo.png ) . 
  / u/ghostknot might kill me for posting this non-polished/uglyly implemented version , but hey !, 
  i 'm just real glad it works !, 
  up-down to go through the listings , s to sell . 
  the recycling machine is essentially a vendor you can `` recycle '' ( sell ) stuff at . 
  the items on the right are a list of stuff in your inventory , the weapon on the left is more detailed info about the selected item , a view we use in multiple places . 
  for the item , ` milspec ' refers to the condition of the item ( ranging from ` defective ' to ` masterwork ' , affects reload cost & accuracy ) and ` tritanium ' to the material that it is made of ( affects damage dealt & taken ) . 
  ` plasma ' , of course , denotes the main type of damage the weapon deals and ` pistol ' is the type of the weapon . 
  `` basic pistol '' is the description that , uh , could use some work . 
  i know / u/ghostknot has made some mockups that have more flavour text that includes the weapon material & condition in a more prosaic way ... but i have n't implemented that yet . 
  the dream scenario would be to have some kind of crazy procedurally generated story there , haha . 
  or perhaps only keep the descriptions for special weapons ? 
  thoughts ? 
  below that , ` burst ' & ` single ' & ` bash ' are all attacks that this particular weapon has . 
  kind of gibberish , no ? 
  taking ` burst ' as the example :, 
  * '' 3d1 +4 is the damage calculation formula, 
  * \u00f83 is the ammo cost for a single attack, 
  * \u03c06 / 6 shows how much ammo is loaded and how much can be in your clip, 
  * 35cu denotes the chronounit cost for using the attack, 
  other stuff i did :, 
  thanks , / u/ghostknot has been doing great work  i 'm especially impressed since i do n't think he has had much ( if any ) experience with pixel art previously , though he is one hell of an experienced designer otherwise . 
  [ i made these ( read : i copied the hand from the japan relief bracelets ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qm8rs.png ) . 
  the quality is n't very good though and the neutralvotes & downvote probably look too similar . 
  was n't sure what the size of these things needs to be either . 
  here 's my take though !, 
  hello everyone , i started following a paleo diet last monday , for the purpose of losing weight . 
  the benefits of eating healthier also sound good , but as an 18-year old male with no apparent big medical conditions , i ca n't really feel the dangers of that , yet . 
  i went cold turkey on everything - i used to eat a lot of bread , all kinds of baked stuff , potatoes , pasta and the like . 
  the only thing i really miss so far is ketchup , but i 'm looking into making my own . 
  i have n't felt any big cravings for anything sugar-heavy , although i did cheat a bit on saturday ( but it was my grandma 's birthday , i ca n't say no to a piece of cake there ! ), 
  luckily , i have n't experienced any headaches , which are apparently pretty common for people starting out on paleo . 
  the only exercise i have been doing is a bit of bicycling , but i 'm trying to get myself together to do some more . 
  oh yeah , and my weight . 
  i weighed in at 88.3 kg ( ~ 195 pounds ) last monday and 86.0 kg ( ~ 190 pounds ) today . 
  great success !, 
  ( although a part of it certainly is the amount of water i 've been drinking , since it 's summer and damn hot over here , ` least for an estonian ), 
  i know that typing `` ss '' ( or `` mia '' - pick your poison ) is not hard , but still , i imagine that this would be very easy to implement and could be quite useful . 
  with maybe another button that serves as `` re '' . 
  you definitely should n't rely on everyone to call missing - basic map awareness is very important - but considering how important it is considered in even normal games , i do n't see a reason why it is n't implemented yet . 
  the `` fall back '' ping kind of serves the same function , but most people wo n't listen to a `` random guy '' telling them to fall back unless they know the reason they should - in which case they probably would have done it themselves anyway . 
  hey ,, 
  trying to co-op with a buddy on the 360 . 
  what keeps happening is that :, 
  i place a white sign, 
  my friend does n't see it, 
  i place a new sign, 
  immediately after placing a new sign , my friend sees the sign, 
  he tries to summon me , but it says failed on his side and i get no text on my side, 
  this all happens vice-versa too . 
  what i 'm guessing is happening is that as soon as i place the second sign , the first one appears for him , but since i have already placed a new one , the summoning fails . 
  any ideas on how to fix this ? 
  probably caused by the fact that we 've both got the same isp and shitty routers with closed nat ... but we could co-op fine like a week ago , this has just started happening a couple of days ago . 
  tl ; dr : russian copies that are widely sold in eastern-european retail stores can not be activated or played, 
  i made this thread because [ the thread from yesterday ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/xcom/comments/11ckjx/todays_patch_seems_to_have_made_the_game/ ) kind of died out , since it seems the region locking was fixed for most people . 
  unfortunately , users in eastern european countries ( confirmed by users from estonia , latvia and romania ) are still affected by this problem . 
  i live in estonia and bought a russian key online , which was sent to me late thursday - a couple of hours before it was supposed to unlock for our region . 
  when i tried to enter the key , i got an error - `` sorry , but the following items are not available for purchasing in your country '' . 
  now , this is where i maybe should have asked for a refund ( although getting one from a keystore does n't seem very likely ) . 
  instead , i went the vpn route ( russian ip ) , unlocked the game and started downloading it . 
  when i woke up in the morning ( download finished ) i disabled vpn and tried to play the game . 
  tough luck , error : `` this game was activated with a product code that is only valid in a specific geographic region . 
  since you are not currently in that region , xcom : enemy unknown is not available to play . '', 
  using a vpn , i can still play it , but i 'd rather not risk getting banned for it , since it 's technically against the steam tos . 
  when i go to the steam store , it says that i already own the game , so i ca n't even purchase it again without having support remove it first .
