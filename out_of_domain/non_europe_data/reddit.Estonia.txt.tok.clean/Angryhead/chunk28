  tl ; dr : russian copies that are widely sold in eastern-european retail stores can not be activated or played, 
  i made this thread because [ the thread from yesterday ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/xcom/comments/11ckjx/todays_patch_seems_to_have_made_the_game/ ) kind of died out , since it seems the region locking was fixed for most people . 
  unfortunately , users in eastern european countries ( confirmed by users from estonia , latvia and romania ) are still affected by this problem . 
  i live in estonia and bought a russian key online , which was sent to me late thursday - a couple of hours before it was supposed to unlock for our region . 
  when i tried to enter the key , i got an error - `` sorry , but the following items are not available for purchasing in your country '' . 
  now , this is where i maybe should have asked for a refund ( although getting one from a keystore does n't seem very likely ) . 
  instead , i went the vpn route ( russian ip ) , unlocked the game and started downloading it . 
  when i woke up in the morning ( download finished ) i disabled vpn and tried to play the game . 
  tough luck , error : `` this game was activated with a product code that is only valid in a specific geographic region . 
  since you are not currently in that region , xcom : enemy unknown is not available to play . '', 
  using a vpn , i can still play it , but i 'd rather not risk getting banned for it , since it 's technically against the steam tos . 
  when i go to the steam store , it says that i already own the game , so i ca n't even purchase it again without having support remove it first .

  [ tweet with danny confirming it ] ( https://twitter.com/xdannyxbrownx/status/299936735637405696 ) and apparently kathy said so on her show . 
  [ and here 's a link to the classic moment that led to this . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrzgsq5l8ou ), 
  happened upon my old sandwich grill ( you know , [ one of these things ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wn9jxmr.jpg ) ) in a forgotten corner of the kitchen and started wondering if they can be used for anything that does n't include bread . 
  i suppose making some `` paleo bread '' to use with it could be an option too , but i 'm usually not a fan of `` paleofied '' food . 
  i started keto exactly a month ago started at 82.7 kg and was 78.9 this morning . 
  went down to 77.9 a week back but has bounced back a bit - i have n't been able to give up weighing myself daily ... yet . 
  anyway , i 'm definitely going to keep on going on , with my goal of 70 kg in mind and hopefully within reach for summer !, 
  have n't weighed under 80 since last fall so this is what is motivating me . 
  i 've been eating paleo-style for a few years now , so going on keto was n't a huge change , just cut out the fruit and added some stuff like salted & roasted peanuts back in ( they 're sooo delicious but overindulging them is also what i 'm going to blame on my `` piss '' ) . 
  i lost a lot of weight on paleo a few years ago and then slowly got sloppier while maintaining . 
  cutting out the fruit is probably what has helped the most , since i used to eat a ton of them - could n't just eat one - in addition to the keto-style regular meat lunches . 
  not getting sleepy past-noon and generally feeling more energetic is awesome !, 
  [ here 's a picture of a delicious oven pork & broccoli dinner i had a few nights ago . 
  now i 'm off to cook some bacon and broccoli for tonight 's dinner !, 
  tl ; dr : male , 179cm , 82.7 kg  78.9 kg , loving the energy on keto . 
  [ here 's my previous post from after my first month . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/220mtf/sv_first_month_of_keto/ ), 
  today , i weighed in at 77.8 kg so that 's a kilo down since last month , but not quite as low as the 77.2 i got to a few weeks ago . 
  so i 've been kinda stalling - the scale has n't moved all that much ( and i tried to scale back on the daily weighings , to once or twice a week ) , but my body has definitely shrunk a bit - [ i can now get into a big-sized small shirt ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/24aoye/nsv_woman_assumed_i_was_a_size_small/ch5etzz?context=3 ) and comfortably use the next notch on my belt !, 
  definitely going to keep on keeping on though !, 
  anyway , on most days i eiher drink a cup of bouillon for breakfast or fast past it , eat leftovers for lunch - usually consisting of pork steak or something made of minced pork or beef with a side of broccoli or cauliflower - and make something along the lines of what i ate for lunch for dinner , enough so that i 'd have leftovers for lunch for the next day too . 
  then the cycle repeats !, 
  throw in snacks of consisting of a boiled egg or few , some ham , cheese , sour cream and maybe some nuts or pork rinds and that 's basically what i every day . 
  i do n't use any sweeteners nor drink anything besides water , tea or rarely , coffee ( black or with butter ) . 
  occasionally some booze on the weekends - rum or whiskey , preferably with ice but definitely no chaser ( i like to call that `` iron man '' - ing it , haha ), 
  i think the reasons why the scale has n't been moving * that * much are :, 
  i do n't really have all that much to lose - i 'm 179 cm & 77.8 kg which equates to 24.3 bmi ( 5ft 10 '' / 171.5 lb ) . 
  typically almost-skinny-fat . 
  nuts ( especially salted & roasted peanuts ) are my worst enemy - i can easily go through a pack of 150g ( about 1000 calories ) while watching tv ... after having already eaten a big dinner . 
  so i 've stopped buying them for now . 
  pork rinds are not quite as bad but i can easily eat a load of them too . 
  neither of these satiate me but they are oh so delicious , damn it !, 
  i know that exercise does n't really help with weight loss but i 've still probably been too inactive - working as a programmer so i do n't really move around much . 
  at least i get up to do dumb shit with my friends on the weekends while still managing to avoid carby foods . 
  barbecue season !, 
  i bought a kitchen scale ... but i have n't yet tracked my food for an entire day with it . 
  this is probably what 's holding me back the most , since i only have a guesstimate on how many calories i 'm actually eating . 
  now for some questions :, 
  chapped lips - are they caused by my diet , and if so , any good ways to fight them ? 
  i drink at least 4 liters of water a day ( probably more than 6 on most days ) so i * highly * doubt they 're caused by a lack of water . 
  maybe i drink * too * much ? 
  my lips get especially bad if i eat a bunch of those damn peanuts . 
  bags under eyes - same question . 
  i get around 7 hours of sleep on most days , so i do n't think the bags are caused by lack of sleep . 
  note : i do n't take any supplements or medication , should i ? 
  never really got the flu , these are the only `` health '' problems i notice , besides muscle cramps , which are ( pre-emptively ) cured by drinking a cup of bouillon in the morning . 
  and finally , some observations/comments :, 
  man , not wanting to really badly sleep in the afternoon is the best !, 
  even though i 'm not quite as overly energetic as i was during the first few weeks , i still feel better than `` usual '' . 
  only kinda-maybe bad thing is that i tend to get up earlier . 
  why the fuck did i only discover `` taco salad '' a few weeks ago ? 
  it 's damn delicious , really quick & easy to make a great fit macro-wise . 
  the only slight danger with it is that it 's got a lot of calories , ` least when you make it with minced pork that has 300kcal/100g . 
  my cravings for high-carb stuff are basically non-existent ... not that i really had them before - i 've been on paleo for a couple of years before this , but on paleo i gorged on fruits . 
  sometimes , water tastes really fucking sweet !, 
  i especially tend to notice this while showering , for some reason . 
  i have n't made any `` fake desserts '' , besides a try at some bread and that made me physically feel hollow in my chest area . 
  caused by the baking powder ? 
  anyway , it did n't taste all that great and the weird feeling definitely put me off . 
  the core of this community is great and very inspiring !, 
  wow , this got kinda long .
