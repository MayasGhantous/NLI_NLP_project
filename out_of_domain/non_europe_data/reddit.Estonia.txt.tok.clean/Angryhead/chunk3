  mmmmm ... magus ... ( `` sweet '' in estonian ), 
  glad i 'm not the only one who really loves this intro and song - hell , persistence of time is my favourite anthrax album . 
  `` a city of souls dying for peace '' is probably one of my favourite lines in metal too .

  this available on youtube ?

  nice , reminds me of the quake i soundtrack by nin , which is kinda what i 'm going for myself too .

  i 'm still in 12th grade , but so far , this tops everything else by quite a lot . 
  in classic mode , evelynn . 
  if the servers have been fucking up , most losses revert to `` loss forgiven '' , which means that they do n't go into your long-time w/l record . 
  as an akali player , my biggest fear is silence . 
  hard cc also shuts her down . 
  i 'm disappointed that they do n't like death . 
  started with amerika for me too !, 
  i was 11 at the time when it was really popular on mtv/local radio . 
  got their `` reise , reise '' album . 
  after that , listened to a ton of slipknot and linkin park until about 2006 , when i discovered master of puppets ( probably because metallica visited estonia on their tour back then , when they were playing the whole album . 
  i did n't get to see them until 2010 though ) . 
  for a long while i thought that mop was metallica 's only good album , without having even listened to any of the others ... oh how foolish i was !, 
  and from that i discovered everything else that i mostly listen to nowadays - classic 70s , old school thrash , stoner and death . 
  my favourite song about erectile dysfunction !, 
  the title is from the onion , right ? 
  lately i 've been mostly listening to the `` ghosts i-iv '' album by nine inch nails . 
  dark , instrumental ambient , good as background music ( since i 'm on teamspeak 99 % of the time i 'm playing lol ), 
  hennessy , a bad bitch and a bag of weed - the holy trinity, 
  to everyone saying i should n't even bother playing like this - yeah , you 're probably right . 
  luckily , this was just something i tried for kicks while i did n't have access to my main pc ( which runs it good on medium or so , which is good enough ), 
  i was just ( pleasantly ) surprised it even ran and did n't throw any errors . 
  seemed like all the effects were working too . 
  brant bjork of kyuss , fu manchu , mondo generator and various other projects . 
  he is an awesome player and has brought so much to the desert/stoner rock genre . 
  i 'm an estonian and i 'm ashamed that i have n't seen 'em live yet .

  have been listening to a lot of non-metal stuff too lately , but my top is still dominated by metal ( except a special lady ), 
  20 $ per gram in estonia , which works out to about ... 760 $ for an ounce . 
  damn . 
  preferably grass-fed . 
  man , some of those lists are dumb as fuck . 
  fast five on the best movies list but no drive ? 
  wtf ? 
  fuck yeah for tyler though !, 
  the thumbnail made it look like you 're eating off a huge tomato . 
  would be great !, 
  in my school we had to write an essay/term paper on a topic of your own choosing ( you had to consult with a teacher though ) at the end of the tenth grade , so i ended up writing about 60 pages on metal with a friend of mine . 
  well ... it 's written in estonian . 
  and i was 16 at the time , so the writing is pretty crappy . 
  and it is no `` deep-insight '' essay , it 's just essentially a basic history of some of the sub-genres and big bands we thought were most important at the time . 
  heh , well , i just turned 19 a couple of days ago so it was n't that long a time ago !, 
  bands we specifically wrote about were : zeppelin , sabbath , maiden and metallica and no-big-silence ( since the teacher told us we have to write about an estonian band too . 
  not my cup of tea , but my friend liked them and he got to interview their singer . ), 
  the genres were : hard rock , nwobhm , thrash , black , death . 
  also a page on metal `` fashion '' and a questionnaire we had a couple of the classes in our school fill out . 
  i was a big thrash fan back then , so that 's what i wrote the most about  - late 2009 , early 2010 . 
  ( it was also the time i discovered gaga and i remember listening to her a ton while writing about metal haha ),
