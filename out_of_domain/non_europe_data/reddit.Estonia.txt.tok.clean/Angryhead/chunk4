  i 've heard that nicholson is posing since he thought that kubrick was taking a picture of him , when , in fact , he was taking a picture of himself with his daughter . 
  `` mom , just get me a pepsi !, 
  please , all i want is a pepsi ! '', 
  and she would n't give it to me !, 
  all i wanted was a pepsi , just one pepsi , and she would n't give it to me !, 
  just a pepsi !, 
  [ kyuss - day one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptqpeqx9aqg ) , at the end of spaceship landing . 
  works fine for me in ff 8 ... 
  [ speaking of the best jokes told at a funeral ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm2xpkqenaw ), 
  great song , best off death magnetic , imo . 
  sorry , but i think you looked much better with the long hair . 
  now the neckbeard just looks weird . 
  but hey , do whatever the fuck you like , totally your choice . 
  that would be * amazing * !, 
  yup . 
  although i find load to be a great album too , i probably would n't consider any song off it * better * ( although the outlaw torn is awesome ), 
  how my hair look , mike ? 
  [ nah , i think that award goes to corpsegrinder . 
  [ kyuss - live @ bizarre festival , germany , 1995 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3cmlxjemuw ), 
  32 minutes of stonery greatness . 
  and the way to the mailbox was uphill both ways and it was -40 degrees outside , right ? 
  god fucking damn , tracks that earl and tyler do together are the best and this would be * amazing . 
  swag . 
  `` so funny `` take you out '' a song i wrote in 2008 leaked . 
  i wrote it for an artist to sing as the world cup song !, 
  maybe they 'll use it now !, 
  that 's what she wrote on twitter . 
  honestly , ( like every other world cup song ) i do n't like it . 
  really bland . 
  you take that back , earth is great !, 
  so are you troy or abed ? 
  got it as a gift from ~ ~ the gift pile ~ ~ the great lord gaben on the first day of the sale and i 've played it 26 hours already ... which means i have n't played any of the other games that i 've bought , except to get the christmas achievements . 
  50 % finished !, 
  i have n't listened to a lot of new metal this year , but i really like worship music by anthrax . 
  did n't expect much from them considering the circumstances , but i think it 's a great album . 
  heard it on one of the odd future talk unreleased stuff collections , really great . 
  and a day later it 's back on the reddit frontpage with a 9gag watermark . 
  it 's a pretty great album , not as good as `` under the influence '' though , imo . 
  love domo mostly for his chill raps but this one is just so hilarious . 
  i do n't know what version of goblin you have , but it seems to be missing [ `` golden '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzsimjlzeow ) , which is probably the darkest and best song on the album . 
  we 've tried waiting about 5 minutes , so i * really * doubt this is the problem . 
  yeah , i actually used the entire egg ( with the shell removed . ), 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  i 'm not sure what moisture you 're referring to , but i had them out on table for the whole night , stuck 'em in the fridge when i went to sleep and ate one for breakfast after microwaving . 
  tasted great . 
  i actually found them easier to eat after they had cooled down , since then i could actually hold and eat them and they would n't fall apart . 
  [ sold out as a threadless shirt . 
  ] ( http://www.threadless.com/product/2347/historical_reconstitution ) i 'm actually wearing the hoodie version of it right now , love it !, 
  i often do n't notice it 's cold until i see people around me in many more layers than i have on, 
  am i really the only one that actually feels a lot colder during winter now ? 
  probably an effect of having about 20 pounds less fat on me than i did last winter , but he also implies he 's lost a lot of weight ... 
  ( as a side note , i really dislike all these lists claiming to be of the negative sides in the title but are actually `` hidden '' praise . 
  ugh , just so smug . ), 
  i bought it from threadless , but it seems like they do n't sell them any more . 
  oh and threadless ships basically anywhere afaik ( i 'm in estonia ), 
  you gonn ' help , huh ? 
  you gon na look out for me ? 
  you gon na look out for me , sergeant carver ? 
  you mean it ? 
  you gon na look out for me ? 
  you promise ?!, 
  you got my back , huh ? 
  lucas ( the dude on the cover , for those who do n't know ) is actually the singer in a hardcore punk band called `` stone cold '' . 
  [ here 's their 2010 demo . 
  ] ( http://www.mediafire.com/?geaq4weqcmr6a4y ), 
  i 'll link some of the more serious/slower songs for you , maybe you 'll like them . 
  [ king cotton ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmacwvns1wy ), 
  [ 1 time ( remix ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ilazu8oig ), 
  [ unchain me ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqat_crdwwu ), 
  i have n't heard most of his stuff ( because there 's just so much ) , but `` basedgod velli '' and `` i 'm gay '' are the best albums/mixtapes since they consist of more serious songs . 
  once again proving the good old [ `` lemmy * is * god '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plkpuu2pazm ) proverb . 
  [ something cool for all of y' all not familiar with domo 's music . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tas09cohbu&amp;feature=related ), 
  the `` all life is sacred '' shirt is pretty great . 
  i 'm more of a post-human kind of death man , but the part in this beginning at 3:30 is * so fucking good . 
  slayer - the antichrist, 
  kyuss - 50 million year trip ( downside up ), 
  metallica - phantom lord, 
  according to last.fm , my top 5 is actually all slayer ( with gaga coming after that ) , but that 'd be boring to post , so i took the top ones from different bands . 
  i hope that you guys will ship it to europe in case i happen to win - hell , i 'd have no problem paying for the shipping . 
  whan an awesome thing that you 're doing !, 
  edit : oh , you guys are cool with overseas . 
  cool . 
  cool cool cool . 
  i thought it was the worst by far . 
  domo 's was pretty good but hodgy was great and i ca n't wait to hear him in a couple of years !, 
  memorex cds and claustroflowbic are dope as hell . 
  ( admittedly , as a of fan ) i 'm not feeling this . 
  breaking bad is really , really good ... but not as good as the wire . 
  i 'll be damned if any show ever tops the fourth season of that . 
  al sweated elvis !, 
  `` you must be logged in and you must have made a purchase on the oddfuture store to gain access to the exclusive free content . '', 
  this comes up when i try to download any of those . 
  damn . 
  well , i have them all anyway , but it would have been a convenient way to share them with friends . 
  [ bought it from amazon in case anyone was wondering . 
  ] ( http://www.amazon.com/blackenedwhite-mellowhype/dp/b0051ojhs6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1330444333&amp;sr=8-3 ), 
  i ca n't claim to be anywhere near an expert to argue with scorsese , but not a single kubrick film ? 
  i 'd love to see that , maybe you could take a picture ? 
  same here , i really dig that album .
