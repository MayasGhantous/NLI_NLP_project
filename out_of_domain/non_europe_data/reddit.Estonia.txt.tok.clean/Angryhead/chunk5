  is it coming out on vinyl ? 
  [ lil b - white flame ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp_x0nzsuwg ), 
  [ hodgy beats - untitled ep ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_awbtypczpg ), 
  [ a$ ap rocky - deep purple ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpr5dyx46m0 ), 
  [ domo genesis - rolling papers ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-uq_qyvmdy ), 
  [ death grips - exmilitary ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orlbo9wkz2e ), 
  so essentially a bunch of hip-hop . 
  i was going for the beat sheol with maggie achievement , actually . 
  got it a few tries later though , 
  speaking as an estonian ( we * wish * we were scandinavians ) in high school :, 
  45 minute classes ,, 
  10 minute breaks in between ,, 
  35 minutes for lunch . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8dnaedvl6u ), 
  only item i 'm missing is the bandage , still have n't managed to complete that damn super meat boy !, 
  ... free pizza into your moth ? 
  it 's ( the instrumental ) of `` country shit '' . 
  check out that ( or the remix with luda ) , `` something '' , `` 2000 & beyond '' and `` american rapstar '' for some good songs . 
  i just hope rorie does n't get totally fucked over ... 
  but but but they could hire him for giant bomb and have him [ write more great gaming articles like this one on dark souls . 
  ] ( http://www.giantbomb.com/news/lifes-a-bitch-and-then-you-die-45-hours-with-dark-souls/3722 ), 
  donals foosd, 
  preach it brother !, 
  yeah , i 'm just really glad for them . 
  they 're just having fun , especially now that earl is back ( and killing it ), 
  the part where it 's just tyler alone gives me chills man ... 
  i did it because a big part of hhh hates of ( and would therefore just downvote this ) while liking earl . 
  personally , i love the whole thing . 
  this * is * their most recent stuff , dude . 
  steamroller . 
  snow so white , moon so bright, 
  they 're on a playground making canines fight, 
  ai n't no place for my kids to go, 
  [ according to rapgenius . 
  ] ( http://rapgenius.com/hodgy-beats-snow-white-lyrics ), 
  have n't gotten it yet - waiting for the vinyl release !, 
  if i could choose , i 'd probably pick the one with lucas 's face , because it 's just so nondescript , just imagine some kid in 50 years popping it into his holo-vinyl-scanner and going all & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ;, 
  i did download it though and i really enjoy it . 
  oldie is the obvious stand-out but bitches , hcapd and sam keep getting a lot of replays too . 
  had to search for your store a bit [ ( here 's the link for anyone else ) ] ( http://www.mmmpineapple.com/ ) but wow , that hoodie is sweet !, 
  and free shipping worldwide ? 
  and promise of discounts next week ? 
  definitely thinking about getting one ( if you restock medium ! ), 
  probably the biggest estonian rapper , genka - in estonian . 
  [ genka - 407 karaati ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc80a0_igqy ), 
  [ a-r\u00fchm - qrat ja ingel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgeckbvywkq ), 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hf7fob2bfa ), 
  and something really chill :, 
  [ droopy vs dj critical ft genka - tallinn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibjyxkxqwee ), 
  * who is ally sheedy, 
  * ally sheedy nude, 
  i really like the progression here . 
  read it in l-boy 's voice . 
  earl as a white dude . 
  twice . 
  the easiest is just heating up whatever 's left over from the night before . 
  [ here you go !, 
  ] ( http://www.mmmpineapple.com/ ), 
  dude running the shop said that there 's gon na be a 4/20 sale this week , so you might want to wait before ordering . 
  hey , nothing to lose by entering !, 
  i 've got this saved as going_to_mcdonalds_with_more_than_5_dollars . gif, 
  definitely going to be there at the estonian show !, 
  i eat them at school like that all the time , but all of my friends cringe and whine about it . 
  i enjoy the added flavour from the peel , you know ? 
  haters gon na hate . 
  it 's actually just an ad campaign with 150 popular names from australia , not referring to any bands or singers . 
  [ short news piece in estonian . 
  it says that the people taking part did not want to say what they were doing or what they were trying to say with their undertaking . 
  so they just waited at the bus stop and took the next streetcar to a local shopping mall . 
  they were allegedely protesting against sms loans . 
  summer glau ? 
  definitely getting both of these on vinyl . 
  e : 35 eur , both including s & h to estonia . 
  's cool . 
  use the code `` april12 '' for 20 % off the records !, 
  i try not to discriminate by genre , so i 'll listen to whatever sounds good to my ears , always looking for more stuff to listen to . 
  but mostly :, 
  lady gaga, 
  various hip-hop like odd future , lil b , big k.r.i.t. , a$ ap rocky, 
  trent reznor 's stuff , mostly the instrumentals . 
  [ here 's some estonian dnb ( i think ? 
  ) ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwuwesu0xxa ), 
  [ here 's my last.fm account . 
  so do i my friend , so do i. 
  not a lot of activity there though . 
  although i 'm trying to avoid anything related to the ball , since i 'm going to one at the end of august , 
  but i 've also got tickets for a megadeth show , a mastodon show and a local festival called hard rock laager in june !, 
  saw them playing at a festival last summer and while i did n't get to meet them up close , they did seem jolly guys and happily waved back to me when i waved to them while they were setting up for their set . 
  steamroller, 
  [ even tyler thought so !, 
  estonian here , 20 $ for a gram . 
  [ did he have a face ? 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndbo3spnwg ), 
  yeah , i think he 's just trolling and trying to keep everyone guessing on what video they were shooting for . 
  that would be the best show ever . 
  looking for one . 
  i 've got two high school final exams still coming up , which is why i 'm ( atleast planning ) not buying d3 before the end of may , but i 'd like to have a small taste of it . 
  looks like the dude 's gaining some popularity and i for one am really glad - i think he definitely deserves it . 
  loving his production . 
  * a fifth act - fight baal,
