  well , for example : 20 $ / gram in estonia . 
  but lately we 've been smoking it pure anyway , since none of my buds ( or me ) smoke tobacco . 
  tastes a lot better . 
  sweat-shirt is just my nickname, 
  * [ to the tune of `` trilla '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrv_wxbsq1s&amp;t=51s ) *, 
  in estonia . 
  next time , use google before you make yourself look like a dumbass . 
  the math checks out !, 
  god 's father and white flame are the best , although # 1 bitch and the basedprint 2 are also great . 
  speaking of the somewhat serious stuff , that is . 
  well , i 'm gay and illusions of grandeur came out in 2011 . 
  iog part 2 came out recently though , but i have n't listened to it much . 
  was n't a big fan of obama basedgod . 
  yeah right !, 
  actually ... it says 350 $ , which comes to about 450 $ . 
  damn !, 
  same here . 
  trying to keep a playa down , for shame !, 
  `` paint a nigga like mozart '', 
  e : gucci mane in `` crazy '', 
  nah , it was gucci . 
  white flame !, 
  [ here 's my joy . 
  on sl1 . 
  [ i 'm from estonia and this song is named after our capital - tallinn . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibjyxkxqwee ), 
  funny video and an enjoyable beat . 
  numbers , triple f, 
  and even though it seemed to get a lot of praise on here : no idols . 
  domo 's and the alchemist 's style just do n't mix for me . 
  yeah , how can you not love fucking iron man ? 
  i 'm not sure if it 's the temperature in my room or k.r.i.t. , but i got chills during his verse . 
  it 's a bit too long , yeah . 
  i 'd remove yela and joey , but maybe add schoolboy q. 
  have n't listened to q on his own , but everything he and rocky do together seems to be instant gold . 
  i ca n't stand the way he enunciates some of the words , especially `` jigga '' just makes me cringe . 
  just my opinion though . 
  tyler , the grateful . 
  it 's pretty exhausting trying to listen to an entire waka album , so what i usually do , is play flockaveli but skip anything that i ai n't really feeling . 
  and get [ stereo type ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kmi2udhdlq ) ( relaxed ) or [ still standing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1jpbdnspgs&amp;t=13s ) ( crazy ) for an additional intro . 
  god damn , i do n't want to be sad on christmas . 
  i 'm pretty sure it is him , bruh bruh . 
  i think he talked about singing on that song back when he performed it for the first time on mtv , a couple of weeks back . 
  you should read palahniuk 's `` rant '' . 
  not nsfw enough !, 
  glad to see that he also thinks that k.r.i.t. 
  murked it . 
  [ we #squad now !, 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noh9wjq2txg ), 
  based god in 3d !, 
  [ or look at this text in picture form !, 
  basedgod velli is majorly underrated, 
  [ trae sampled electric wizard 's `` dopethrone '' , ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mntbot5gh4 ) so i 'm waiting on somebody to get on to sampling [ death , `` spiritual healing '' for example . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lajqoecss_o&amp;t=3m31s ), 
  rip chuck , fuck cancer . 
  '' , get it ? '', 
  you 're so funny ! '', 
  i 'd have guessed lips , based on your flair . 
  sadly the game does n't show the turn count/year during that screen , but based on my other closest screenshots it only took about 80 years to break him . 
  [ this was actually the only city of his i took ( and subsequently razed ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5jqac.jpg ) , but yeah , i did kill a bunch of his units while they were trying to take carthage or utique back , which led to [ this fun situation . 
  ordered one !, 
  [ now enjoy the music from the underwater levels in smb . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbx-8jqigfa ), 
  [ rocky and q : back and forth ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd54rrbsn9y ), 
  is a dope producer but it 'd be awesome if they did something together . 
  [ a 5x5 for the last 3 months . 
  ] ( http://www.tapmusic.net/lastfm/collage.php?user=angryhead&amp;type=3month&amp;size=5x5 ) far right in the top row is the giant bombcast , been listening to a lot of old ones while playing dark souls . 
  [ 1 time remix ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ilazu8oig ), 
  [ i own swag ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zja6fb5crk ),

  [ salute to the bitch ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sflzbutb7ys ), 
  my most played rapper according to last.fm and nobody has a list up here so here goes . 
  mostly based on most plays . 
  i am the one who frags !, 
  listen to the `` obama basedgod '' tape if you need some voting inspiration . 
  `` yeah 2013 , obama basedgod - vote for me ! '', 
  the basedgod 's curse has been placed upon them now . 
  my `` favourite '' line of his is `` paint a nigga like mozart '', 
  listened through it once and it all just felt so ... samey . 
  i would n't call it bad but there 's definitely a lack of variety . 
  for my money , sleeping in class is still his best . 
  if flair could have your last.fm username when hovering the mouse over it , that 'd be pretty dope . 
  i reaaaaaaally hope we get another `` i own swag '' out of this . 
  [ i think this is the kind of message mr. la flare would stand for . 
  please link to whatever song/paste the lyrics on that . 
  just imagine if every person lil b has used as a song title got butthurt about it . 
  on the grind 24/7 , eh ? 
  estonia, 
  genka - tallinn ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibjyxkxqwee ), 
  [ a-r\u00fchm - viimane lumi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ymqh1rfri ), 
  [ ? kvartett - p\u00fcstolid rendiks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uylih4yzoow ), 
  pretty shitty scene overall , but there 's some good old-school production out there . 
  and the lyrics are often actually pretty good - but y' all wo n't understand them unless you learn estonian . 
  shiiiiiet , trapped you pretty good !, 
  i 'm about two thirds through , and so far , it 's nothing special , in my opinion . 
  this tape is full of the ridiculous , ad-lib-filled-shouting-on-weird-beats type of his songs and they have to be pretty special for me to like them . 
  ah damn , i was quickly browsing before a lecture and since the search did n't bring it up i decided to post . 
  the time you have to react to the powerup feels too short to me . 
  maybe you could pause the game for a second so the players can read what it says before they have to focus on the ball again ?
