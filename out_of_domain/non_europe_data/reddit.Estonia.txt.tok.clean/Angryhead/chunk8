  bars for days . 
  more metal in hip-hop , please ... that 's not nu-metal . 
  for example , [ trae - `` i 'm fresh '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mntbot5gh4 ) samples electric wizard and is therefore fucking killer . 
  for sure !, 
  saw them live a couple of years ago at a festival . 
  it was outdoors , but the atmosphere was great anyway since it started raining .

  that 's pretty good , thanks for the link .

  damn deal . 
  fergenstein is dope . 
  i thought lord $ never worry was a total bust at first , but i 've been listening to it a lot lately - especially the ferg songs . 
  bangin ' on waxx , work and choppas on deck get me hyped as hell . 
  e : superexcited for trap lord . 
  i 've heard rumours that the `` store everything for every time '' is an unfortunate requirement for euphoria .

  could anyone who grabbed it before it reached the download limit upload it ? 
  and he often goes on pretty long streaks of rting/replying to a bunch of people on it too . 
  song number 627 on the complete myspace collection, 
  [ well they alread released a tribute to b so ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf74sp9o-gi ), 
  i do n't want to be `` that guy '' , but i think ` god 's father ' and ` white flame ' deserve a chance . 
  young chop 's twitter background is fucking hilarious . 
  awesome news though . 
  i thought it meant `` out the rap game '' , hah, 
  always glad to see another dude pass the `` be nice to nardwuar '' test . 
  yessssssss , got that positive lil b flair now !, 
  thank you !, 
  both of the jaot albums are real good , available on oddfuture.com as free downloads . 
  ca n't wait for the third one to drop . 
  that 's the first thing i saw too , truth be told . 
  trap house , chicken talk , the burrprint ( the movie 3d ) , the state vs. radric davis , trap back .

  heh , i 'm actually pretty new to gucci myself and have n't had the time to listen to everything yet , but those were the ones that i had listened to and had caught my ear . 
  hard to find the time to listen to everything while also listening to all the new cool stuff that gets put out and of course , the basedgod 's vast discography . 
  every time i hear that intro ( and i 'm alone or possibly drunk ) i just have to slightly twitch along and then go nuts during the laughing part . 
  i 'm not alone in this ... right ? 
  most of my collection is made up by metal records , but i 've got some hip-hop in there too . 
  kanye 's `` college dropout '' & `` mbdtf '' ( really should do something with the artwork in there ... ) , krit 's `` k.r.i.t. 
  wuz here '' & `` return of 4eva '' , mellowhype 's `` blackenedwhite '' and , of-course , `` enter the wu-tang ( 36 chambers ) '', 
  i 'd really like to get czarface on vinyl , since the artwork is sick , but any site i 've seen wants too damn much to ship it over here . 
  ca n't wait for trap lord !,

  thank god my phone automatically stops playing music when the headphones get unplugged . 
  funny how `` sula '' in estonian means `` melted '' , and , for example , `` sulalumi '' means `` melted snow '' . 
  this led me to immediately think it meant `` melted man '' . 
  a lady gaga show for me . 
  ( i wish we got any visiting hip-hop artists up here in estonia ... but gaga owns irregardless . ), 
  you 've heard the album but not half the songs on it ? 
  huh ?

  it took me less than 2 hours , definitely a game to be played in one sitting . 
  's all good , i visit this subreddit pretty often but did n't think about posting it here . 
  they 've got another mixtape , ` better off dead ' coming up . 
  no idea when though . 
  hopefully soon , sometime after the beast coast tour perhaps ?

  [ made me think of `` the chronicles of riddick : escape from butcher bay '' . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_chronicles_of_riddick:_escape_from_butcher_bay ), 
  too long , in my opinion . 
  hah , i never even thought of `` dominoes '' as the pizza chain . 
  then again , i do n't live in the usa . 
  i 'm kin to `` white flame '' myself , but yeah , most would name `` god 's father '' . 
  but `` 6 kiss '' and especially `` i 'm gay '' are probably the ( conventionally ) `` best '' . 
  i 'll gladly pay the iron price for a shield like that . 
   yeah it was fun when i was 20 years old, 
  this song was uploaded a year ago . 
  the vimeo video was uploaded 9 months ago . 
  if anything , i 'm guessing it was the other way around . 
  fake edit : the vimeo video even says `` prod .
