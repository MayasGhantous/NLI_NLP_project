  [ ? kvartett - p\u00fcstolid rendiks ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uylih4yzoow ), 
  not a very great scene overall ( imo ) , but there 's some good old-school production out there . 
  and the lyrics are often actually pretty good - but y' all wo n't understand them unless you learn estonian . 
  the most cringeworthy part is here is the font on your phone . 
  you ca n't just say that without posting the picture man !, 
  seriously though . 
  music for days , literally ( 5 days and 19 hours of lil b in my library ) with more to come . 
  varied beats and flow ( and lack of it ) . 
  plus i 've already got like 5.6 k plays of him so i 've got at least some days down . 
  this is why i love [ `` im just livin '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fyn7zpqafy ), 
  `` nah bitch , shut up . 
  shut the fuck up bitch , i do what i want - i 'm the basedgod . '', 
  - `` hmm ... that seems about right . '', 
  as far as i know the dude started seriously rapping like a year ago so he really does n't have much stuff ...

  i 'm guessing that this is old but i had n't seen in it before and really liked it so decided to share it with the fam !, 
  if you got any more lil b comics , post 'em !, 
  riff raff 's account justified the existence of vine for me . 
  action bronson 's karaoke sessions are pretty great too . 
  a cooking show with lil b and action bronson , with a special `` kitchen talk '' section of gucci mane demonstrating the latest pyrex accessories . 
  i have n't seen it in years but i remember it being pretty funny . 
  much more subdued though , this is - spoiler - only a dream . 
  [ slo burn - amusing the amazing ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g78pba7ejpk ), 
  yeah , it 's an entire 16-minute ep , but if you like any of it , you 'll like all of it . 
  the nearer summer gets , the more i listen to stoner ... again . 
  [ check out the giant bomb video review . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zahgp4a1o9e ), 
  user : same as here - angryhead, 
  have not listened to a ton this week , been sucked in by dragon 's dogma : dark arisen and actually been outside a lot since the weather got all nice ` round these parts !, 
  and i discovered that all of my charts ( 7d/1m/3m / 6m/12m/overall ) are topped by lil b. 
  lil b - i own swag, 
  just copped ( a pre-order for ) the 2lp for a cool 20 $ , for less than i had seen it anywhere on the ` net . 
  living in estonia finally paid off !, 
  ( i know the song came out way before rocky got famous but it fits really well ),

  really liked the previous two releases ( and the internet 's album ) , so been waiting for this . 
  four songs in , digging it . 
  i have never seen a video with 608 likes and no dislikes . 
  ca n't hate on that video , 
  e : of course , somebody had to go and ruin it now :(,

  last.fm usernames on tag mousover or next to the tag would be great . 
  this was playing back when i played diablo 3 ( last summer ) and beat the final boss ( diablo himself ) on inferno ( the day before a big patch that nerfed him ... or me , ca n't remember ) . 
  truly a #tybg moment for me . 
  ' 6 kiss ' is still his best for my money , with a very close ` white flame ' second and ` i 'm gay ' third . 
  [ danny brown knows what 's up . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/xdannyxbrownx/status/297353903740182528 ), 
  yeah , the fact that music only played when there was an actual source for it ( plus the montages at the end of every season and * i think * , one random scene that included avon walking in slow-motion ) was pretty important and brought up . 
  anyone have the instrumental of this ? 
  the rapping part is okay , but the instrumental could is on some clams casino-type shit, 
  woah , sorry for that . 
  been such an event-packed week for me that i seriously thought that it was sunday already . 
  trap game time travel, 
  try out the whole ` trap house ' album , maybe you 'll dig it . 
  a simpler time with a less-crazy gucci with ( often funny ) bars for days . 
  oh and it 's got jeezy on a couple of tracks , before all that crazy shit went down . 
  asked him on twitter for whether an instrumental version is available , but he told me `` naaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh '' . 
  story of my life bruh . 
  ca n't even really take a single shot now - kinda sucks when living in north-eastern europe, 
  [ gucci been helping out older women though ] ( http://i.imgur.com/q0e93ub.jpg ), 
  throw up a link if you find it , please : + ), 
  the line after that ad-lib is `` young based god got a bitch that was racist '' though ... 
  yesss , finally somebody who also thinks that white flame is his best ( mixtape ) . 
  great guide , can vouch for it . 
  ** the jet age of tomorrow - the jellyfish mentality ** - new stuff from jaot , always a good time if you like spacey electronic stuff with occasional rapping from the odd future dudes and associates . 
  ** nine inch nails - ghosts i-iv ** - heard the new track which made me listen to this again . 
  still love it . 
  the beatles - enter the magical mystery chambers ** - i fucking love this mash-up album . 
  some chill shit . 
  ** the jet age of tomorrow - the journey to the 5th echelon ** - see above . 
  their second album , also great . 
  ** curren $ y - new jet city ** - i just cycled through ` sixteen switches part 2 ' ( i wish it was longer !, 
  ) , ` three 60 feat . 
  juicy j' and ` bitch get up . 
  feat juvenile ' , since those are my favorite parts of it . 
  dope . 
  ** big k.r.i.t. 
  - k.r.i.t. 
  wuz here ** - a modern classic and his best , imo . 
  listened to both this and the chopped & screwed version , great summer party music . 
  ** danny brown - xxx ** - one full playthrough of this usually satisfies my cravings for a while . 
  harsh , but rewarding .
