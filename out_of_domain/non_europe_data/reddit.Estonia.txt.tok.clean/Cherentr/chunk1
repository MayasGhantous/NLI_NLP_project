  it is commonly known that porn is n't like real sex .

  maybe this was true a lot of years ago but nowadays ** most ** porn is not even close to rape . 
  if you 're going to make such statements please provide us with evidence . 
  edit : words are hard, 
  are they going to have werewolf children ? 
   i 'd like to see similar evidence for `` most teenagers are well informed nowadays '',
