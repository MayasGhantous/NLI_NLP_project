  kind of made a problem out of the who situation for usa ) should n't be enough . 
  unless some unbiased sites ( like wikipedia ) are ready to point fingers at assad it is n't going to be enough . 
  is what you 're saying more people killed = more evil country ? 
  then us is some pretty evil country would n't you say ? 
  op said that assad is better because it does n't kill people as cruelly as the rebels do . 
  okay op i do n't know if you 're still interested in the topic or not but i will try to change your view - somewhat . 
   we should be glad that russia is helping him instead of condemning them both, 
  the thing is - russia is a rival of the us . 
  giving it up would n't not only mean us has no control there but also that russia would . 
  from a militaristic standpoint it is n't a really great thing for the us . 
  however i guess supporting the rebels does create refugees which taxes their allies a lot too . 
  so it 's decision of the united states to make - give up syria and help their allies or tax their allies and pour a lot of money into the cause and cause unrest in assad to prevent russia from taking power in syria . 
  from a moral standpoint i 'd agree that russia winning would be better for syrians as it would stabilize the country and give them * slightly * better rulers . 
   let 's say there are five of this shotgun in the world . 
  but a bunch of other people have very similar shotguns . 
  also we do n't know if there are any exactly like that illegally but we know that some very like the shotgun do exist illegally . 
   ok , let 's say that video footage shows the shot came from billy 's bedroom window , and that billy was home at the time and has not reported any trespassers in his house . 
  there is no clear evidence that the shot came from assad . 
  if there was clear evidence that the shots came from assad 's military base it would be case closed . 
  but there is no such kind of evidence . 
   and let 's say that billy , shortly after police arrive , rents a wrecking ball and demolishes the house . 
  is that enough ? 
  actually the situation was quite different . 
  assad asked the un and russia to investigate themselves and were quite upset there was no clear evidence . 
    unless some unbiased sites ( like wikipedia ) are ready to point fingers at assad, 
   they do . 
  wikipedia does n't . 
  they say the perpetrators are unknown . 
   exclusive : gruesome syria photos ** may ** prove torture by assad regime, 
   their report , based on thousands of photographs of dead bodies of ** alleged ** detainees killed in syrian government custody , would stand up in an international criminal tribunal , the group says . 
  so what this is saying is cnn blames al-assad for torture . 
  torture has happened but there is no real proof that it was done by al-assad . 
  perhaps i missed the point where there was good evidence of al-assad torturing people . 
  here we go again, 
  but better late than never as they say . 
  and we would have to go through some cruel painful shit . 
  nobody wants a ww3 . 
  russia vs usa would start ww3 . 
  no , i am not saying they do n't torture . 
  they even tortured some europeans . 
  all i am saying is they need more reason to do it that the rebels which would make them better in my book . 
  also usa just stopped training rebels , which i guess means that it will go downhill for the rebels fast . 
  hey guys , the thing we said about not training rebels anymore was a joke !, 
  got you guys good , haha . 
  are the articles i am looking at - right hand side it clearly says : perpetrators unknown . 
   not a bunch , not at that level . 
  it literally had to be either a syrian attack , an attack made with stolen syrian weapons , or an attack made with weapons carefully crafted by a hostile government ( such as the us ) to match the syrian weapons ' footprint . 
  someone could 've stolen them years ago and sold them now who knows . 
  does n't matter much anyway anymore as us stopped training the rebels . 
  lots of refugees and refugee hate these days . 
  because vietnam worked out so well for you guys , you 'll surely take north korea in weeks !, 
  i think a lot of people missed my point and there 's only me to blame for being vague . 
  all i was suggesting that it would n't be a walk in the park . 
  not that the us would get their ass handed to them . 
  not likely . 
  i think you made an interesting point though so i am going to address it . 
  oh , of course usa would beat them if it was an all-out war . 
  but would it be ? 
  things would not go as 1v1 usa vs nk . 
  both have allies : usa has south korea there and north korea has china and russia . 
  go on a full-out war against russia 's and china 's ally ? 
  i think that might be a little too risky . 
  there is a chance both russia and china abandon north korea and then they 'd be fucked . 
  what if not though ? 
  would the us risk ww3 ? 
  you 're right - they have n't been super close lately . 
  would china want to be allied with russia though ? 
  i 've no clue if china would stay neutral or ally with either side . 
  lukasenko has been the president since 1994 . 
  do n't see anybody else taking his place anytime soon . 
  i thought they were done with that ? 
  i do n't quite see what the eu could do here - short of declaring war for some bullshit reason anyway . 
  the sanctions are already in place . 
  russia is n't violating any un laws . 
  the russian economy is getting better as oil prices rise due to the chaos everybody is causing in middle east . 
  so no reason for russia to stop either . 
  actually i do n't think they will be defined at all , in depth at least . 
  depends on who the big players in the future are though . 
  might be russia/usa/both might be looked at like nazis are now . 
  who hates the west ? 
  i do n't know , they were leaked after all . 
  whoever did that had no interest in downplaying the numbers did they ? 
  not really . 
  i think the us has more wealthy people than africa does . 
  true , but the point still stands . 
  more people = / = more wealthy people . 
  i am unsure about which western government you 're speaking of but if it is the us then here 's a nice wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_united_states about what the us has done . 
  if the government you go to ca n't control you 101 % they 're much better off terminating you . 
  think of what teleportation offers in wars . 
  instant transport of troops and machinery . 
  even if that could n't be mass produced and they 'd only end up with a couple of teleporters or even only you - it 'd be huuuge . 
  that 's too risky to give away . 
   this is a major reason males are more likely to die before child birth and shortly afterward than females . 
   women generally have a higher pain tolerance than men . 
  could you get a sources for me on these please ? 
   i think the perception that men are superior to women has to do with patriarchy . 
  in our society , males hold the power so they can take risks and behave in ways that are n't as acceptable for women since the negative consequences are n't as great . 
  i would see if you made that point if we were talking about middle ages or a country like saudi arabia . 
  what prevents a woman going into politics other than personal preference ? 
  i do n't really see a wall here seeing that many powerful women are in politics and in high positions .
