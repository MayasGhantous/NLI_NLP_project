  no , that would just add fuel to the fire . 
  if he had stable control he 'd still have to imprison opponents for sure , but i do n't see why he 'd have to commit more and worse atrocities . 
   russia would have to provide strong military and economic support , which russia may not be in a position to do . 
  russia expanding its influence over the eastern med does not benefit nato , as it increases the threats to turkey and greece . 
  if america keeps fueling the insurgency , yes , but since the op 's point was that the west should stop meddling there , we can assume that the insurgency would die down . 
  insurgency without support can be dealt with rather easily compared to insurgency with allies . 
   and , even if assad does regain power , his regime will have a limited life span . 
  within 10-15 years , another revolt/power struggle will destabilize the region again . 
  assad dynasty has been controlling the region since ' 71 . 
  why do you think it 'd be destabilized again ? 
  yes , i can choose what thoughts to think . 
  for exqmple i can fantasize about an ice cream with a nice crispy cone and 3 balls on top . 
  can you not do that ? 
  i see this a week old , but i found your post interesting so i am going to respond anyway . 
  first of all , size :, 
  both population and land -  europe is bigger . 
  almost * twice * the population and a little bit more land . 
  europe is n't just france + uk . 
   a lot of their weaponry is old but still very effective ,, 
  yes , it is not a superpower that it used to be , but russia has always , prioritized military . 
  i think there is a misconception with that , saying the russian equipment is old and rusty and shit is somewhat true - their civilian technology ( radios , cars television ) is pretty bad ( has been getting better lately though ) but their military has been always been top notch . 
  granted us definitely has better armed forces nowadays i think if you add europe to russia things are looking bad for the us . 
   frankly , europe 's military does n't really even weigh all that heavily into things in this scenario . 
  do n't get me wrong , europe has some of the best trained military personnel on the planet , but their militaries are geared for either quick strikes or for very limited fields of engagement . 
  very true , a lot of it is for special missions but i saying it has no military whatsoever is not true . 
   again , i do n't want people thinking i 'm insulting the military prowess of europe . 
  it 's just that the united states and russia are larger countries that have historically poured more resources into their militaries . 
  only after the ww2 actually ( for us anyway ) . 
  that is when us became a superpower . 
  before and during ww2 germany was the powerhouse of military , being by far the most advanced in that field . 
  uk , russia and to some extent france were big as well . 
  nazi germany vs us in 1939 and i 'd give it to nazi germany 9 times out of 10 . 
  stalemate with a lot of dead people . 
  depending on the generals and such us may or may not annex a few countries . 
  to conclude , i think it would be a very bloody war for both sides , us would have a big edge having poured a lot of money into their armed forces already , while europe has n't been doing that lately . 
  however if you give a year prep time so both sides can focus on their military i think it will be a total loss for the us ( if the us is invading anyway ) . 
  europe already has very good infrastructure and if they had a year to feed the war machine i think it 'd be very , very scary . 
   just because of the number of ships and planes we have . 
  europe actually has a bigger navy that the us not even adding russia to the equation . 
  russia has another 200 warships . 
  warships in europe and russia : 753 for europe , 412 for the us . 
  the amount of military aircraft in the us and europe + russia is almost the same with both being around ~ 5000 . 
  it 'd be just as hard to stop production in central/eastern europe as north dakota . 
  i am not exactly sure , how the us is running nato considering it is a defense pact and servers its purpose well and would do so even without the us . 
  about the un , well ... 
   the united nations is an international organization founded in 1945 and committed to maintaining international peace and security ; developing friendly relations among nations ; promoting social progress , better living standards and human rights . 
  ca n't say the us is thriving in any of these . 
  yes , the us is one of the most influential member of the un along with russia and china . 
  what i meant was that nobody gives a shit what the un says , not even the us who is running the thing . 
  any decent country that has some basic defenses can pretty much laugh at any resolutions . 
  nato has always been about russia and the us . 
  nato was a counteract for the warsaw pact . 
  if us had no need of other states in nato there would be no nato . 
   look at the tpp . 
  its americas deal , the world forced to adopt it or fall out of the loop, 
  the world ? 
  only the 12 countries have joined the partnership . 
   cardenas j. alban is a former staff sergeant in the united states army who plead guilty to , along with johnny m. horne jr. , [ 1 ] the murder of qassim hassan , a sixteen-year-old iraqi . 
  he was sentenced to one year 's confinement , demoted to private and given bad-conduct discharge . 
   william laws calley , jr. [ 1 ] ( born june 8 , 1943 ) is a former united states army officer found guilty of murdering 22 unarmed south vietnamese civilians in the my lai massacre on march 16 , 1968 , during the vietnam war . 
  after several reductions , calley 's original sentence of life in prison was turned into an order of house arrest , but after three years , ** president richard nixon reduced his sentence with a presidential pardon . 
   in the first few hours of the operation , two active duty soldiers from charlie company 3/187th infantry regiment , executed three unarmed iraqi detainees . 
  [ ... ] the third soldier later made an arrangement with the government to plead guilty to a reduced charge of ** aggravated assault ** . 
  [ ... ] facing mandatory life sentences , the two soldiers who carried out the executions entered plea deals that reduced their maximum sentence to 18 years , ** making them eligible for parole after 5 1/2 years . 
   detainees habibullah and dilawar ( surnames were not provided ) were killed in custody during that time . 
  military pathologists classified the killings as homicides . 
  claus and 27 other members of the united states armed forces were named for the role they played in the abuse . 
  which was routine . 
  however , military prosecutors decided that responsibility for the men 's deaths was spread too broadly for any one soldier to face murder or manslaughter charges . 
   claus was charged with assault , prisoner maltreatment , and lying to investigators . 
  he pled guilty , and received a ** five-month ** prison sentence in 2005 . 
  these are just some examples . 
  you can find this bullshit in most cases of the cases in the list . 
  so while you 're right that they have been convicted , the other guy was also right that the thing is a fucking joke . 
  since when are countries like vietnam , peru , chile etc. 
  the richest ones ? 
  vietnam is 126th , peru is 93rd in the world . 
  does n't seem like top of the chart to me . 
  well you said the us made the ** world ** adapt or with tpp and i do n't see how it affects most major powers , honestly . 
  i do n't see how china/russia/european countries have `` fallen out of the loop '' by not being in the tpp . 
  the culture of these immigrants is quite wildly different . 
  from blaming the western world ( europe and usa ) for many of their problems to hitting/raping women , stoning people to death . 
  it seems very likely that these people who ca n't be arsed to work or learn the language do n't give a damn about learning the laws of the new country they 're in . 
  so if they keep their `` culture '' and their culture goes against the country 's ( sweden 's ) laws ( and it does ) then they are likely to commit more crimes . 
   and quite literally the rest of the world, 
  not quite sure how he turned them against the world , since they were already pretty hateful towards the world ( rightlyn , imho ) considering what the versaille treaty did to germany . 
   think that pretty heavily out weighs bruised ego 's and hurt feelings about the last time they got their asses handed to them in a war in which they were one of the main aggressors . 
  that was n't even the reason the germans were angry though . 
  i was talking about the versaille treaty . 
  french , american and britsih leaders took away german land , asked for 20 billion ( !!! ), 
  gold marks for reparations , which caused a huge inflation . 
  in less than a decade the money had inflated so much that a gold mark in 1918 was equal to 200 billion marks in 1923 . 
  workers got paid multiple times a day , because the inflation was just that big . 
  kids built block houses with stacks of money . 
  people lost their jobs - when hitler came to power there were around 6 million german people unemployed . 
  in a few years he fixed the economy and found 5 million jobs so there were around 1 million people unemployed people left . 
  he constructed infrastructure , fixed inflation and overall made the german situation a lot better . 
  that 's why nazism and killing jews and foreigners even worked - they had been so majorly screwed in the ass by the rest of the world for the last 20 years . 
  so basically the rest of the world ( mostly french , america and britain ) collapsed german economy , took away their military forces and land and made them miserable in many other ways . 
  to say that 's a minor inconvenience or `` a bruised ego '' is ridiculous .
