  thanks for pointing that out , did n't really think that through . 
  what i meant was that i ( teenager ) and anyone i know ( in the internet too ) that i have talked to about this topic does not think porn is the same as sex . 
  also i 'd imagine if you 're being raped you would do something about it ( try to scream/try to fight etc. ), 
  which i have never seen in porn . 
  he is always the ~ ~ karate ~ ~ chinese kung fu guy . 
  does n't matter . 
  are you 4 real ? 
  i do n't want to talk to imaginary people . 
  so you are not for real ? 
  well yes , they 're quite cool indeed . 
   dog, 
  i tell my dog the greatest lies all the time . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ dog . 
  the london look, 
  have you killed a huge bear with a brokeb fork ? 
  never . 
  i am just a little retardeb . 
  please tell me how can you perform tests on god, 
  if you can honestly say `` i enjoy smoking '' after smoking a cigarette i am pretty sure you actually do enjoy smoking . 
  karma 's a bitch if you 're a bitch, 
  maybe not * amazing * health benefits but it has some that are never mentioned because y' know . 
  actually it is pretty arrogant to assume that you know the best what other people enjoy and do n't enjoy . 
  is it scientifically proven that no person enjoys smoking cigarettes in any way ? 
  could you provide me with your source please ? 
  jerk switched rune 2h with iron 2h . 
  you can still do it,

  tom cruise, 
  exactly !, 
  actually it is impossible to `` save '' a life since everybody dies anyways . 
   water, 
  it is probably recycled anyways . 
  if it is not recycled then yes please !, 
  poopy water is the best !, 
  thank you for the reply and trying to describe it though !, 
  it sounds amazing . 
  i have lately been practizing meditation myself and just wanted to know how it made other people feel . 
  thanks for the warning !, 
  i just wanted to know how it went for other people , 
  i have been reading about meditation and doing meditation for a few weeks and it gets me to this really awesome calm feeling where i also discover a lot about myself . 
  thanks for the reply !, 
  i will definitely check out the vipassan\u0101-meditation . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  i wish i could do that before before sleep but it always makes me a lot more awake . 
  it absolutely is !, 
  i also tried the [ no-self ] ( http://www.no-self.com/ ) experience which was amazing too . 
  i guess it has different effect on everybody which makes the stories even more interesting and unique !, 
  do you still meditate regularly and does it help you to focus on stuff  ? 
  but but you could make some money off of me . 
  constant reposts, 
  if you did that totally intentionally absolutely aware of the title then this is awesome !, 
  you will never forget the third letter of my name . 
  work hard and work smart . 
  i ca n't find the site ever since i lost it a few weeks ago :(, 
  i am scared to go to that website . 
  edit : it was n't there :(, 
  want me to play with them . 
  i 'm afraid of little kids breaking . 
  i guess the girl would have pushing marks ( ? ) . 
  also if you rape someone they 'd probably try to fight which leaves marks, 
  o boi here we go again, 
   a sentence that has 8 words or less . 
  well , there are a lot of parennts here anyway . 
  i guess they 're fucked when their kids find out . 
  no , it does n't . 
  at least you wo n't get cramps because of that . 
  actually you 're wrong because it 's supposed to be `` you 're '' . 
  only if the head is split open . 
  we ca n't know for sure who was an atheist and who was not if we go more than few hundred years back . 
  what does math and a lot of branches of science have to do with critical thinking ( except some branches that have to do with things that bible states i.e biology etc ), 
  i wish i had explained myself better but i am not that great at english . 
  after you downvote me could you reply what you disagree with ? 
  could you elaborate which parts that he mentioned were wrong ? 
  he was a professional redditor . 
  100k + karma in a year is pretty good . 
  these kids are certainly on some heavy drugs . 
  `` i 'm hitler 's granddaughter '', 
  i 'm a straight male, 
  very well , even though they might have the critical thinking skills they do n't seem to be using them . 
  also you mentioned that bible should n't taken literally ( there are lots of people who agree and disagree ) then what would be the meaning of praising slavery , rape , burning for an eternity ( for anything !, 
  ) , hate for homosexuals etc ? 
  actually drowning is usually not painful at all, 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/popular_science_monthly/volume_13/may_1878/the_question_of_pain_in_drowning ), 
  3rd degree burns do not hurt so i guess it would n't be that painful, 
  actually drowning is quite fast . 
  imagine you 're in a shipwreck , if there 's no way you 're going to survive the logical course of action would be to inhale water which would get you unconscious immediately, 
  do you not have zoos ? 
  there are some really batshit crazy people out there you know . 
  do n't set your life career etc. 
  on the line just to tell someone . 
  wait till you can provide yourself and then do it if you want to . 
  true that , also op could be living in a place where you could get yourself killed if you said you 're an atheist . 
  i guess if you 're afraid of some that would be a bad way to go , did n't consider that . 
  no , they do not but you may get 2nd degree burns ( redness with clear blister ) if the fire is not all around you which could be pretty bad . 
  [ wikipedia 's article nsfw ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burn ), 
  it pretty much kills the nerves . 
  i am not the best person to explain that to you , sorry . 
  yeah seems like you ca n't even say it in this topic . 
  have you ever even been there ?
