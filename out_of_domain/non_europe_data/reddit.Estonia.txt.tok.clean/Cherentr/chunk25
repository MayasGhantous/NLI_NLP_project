  the eu 's gdp growth in 2014 was 1.6 , the us 's gdp growth was 2.2 in 2013 . 
  i would n't exactly call that stagnation . 
   birth rates are low to the point of being forced to allow millions of immigrants in who wo n't assimilate into the local culture, 
  the birth rates in eu are 1.6 and in the states they 're 1.9 . 
  that 's 0.3 difference which is n't exactly a whole lot . 
  about the fact that we allow refugees in because our fertility rates are super low , i would like a source . 
   your militaries are ill-equipped and poorly trained, 
  i would be extremely happy if you could offer me a trustworthy source on that . 
   i want a strong political , economic , and cultural europe . 
  i do n't want american money or american blood doing what european money and blood is more than capable of doing . 
  have you considered why america is doing this ? 
  i can tell you that it is not because of a good will . 
  it is because influence in europe is very useful for america . 
  nobody is going to fight against them when they arrange a coup d'etat in some arabian country . 
  business can be done in dollars , which is great for america . 
  yeah i know they 're legal i just did n't know russia was using them in syria as they 're a bitch to clean up . 
  people in vietnam are still dying to cluster munitions that did n't explode . 
  odd that one would use such measures in his allies ' territory . 
  kadyrov always reminds me of ramsay bolton for some reason . 
  in nato perhaps . 
  russia still holds its own and so does china , plus some other countries that are in their sphere of influence . 
  does n't mean they do n't resist the us 's will in syria though . 
  china is also building some `` islands '' in south china sea . 
  exactly , the us still has to consider the opinions and wants of ** at least ** these 2 countries . 
  oh my god , / u/imperium _ dragon , you ca n't just ask someone why they 're blue . 
  saa has been steamrolling rebels with the help of russian bombing actually, 
  i think you severely underestimate the power of an order from an authority . 
  no , but you obviously are judging from your comment history . 
  what does america have to gain from bombing the saudis back to stone age ? 
  nothing . 
  politicians just lose popularity because of men coming back in coffins . 
  u.s aww force haha, 
  ^ ^ * only ^ ^ applies ^ ^ if ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ a ^ ^ high ^ ^ ranking ^ ^ member, 
  you could also skydive from a balcony with the assistance of a nurse . 
  your logic has holes . 
  if you do n't have anything to eat then you ca n't shit anyway . 
  a fully decked t-90 would first and foremost hope that its reactive armor works and blows up the tow before it hits the tank . 
  if that 's not the case however , i would guess it depends where it is hit . 
  if the tracks are hit it is quite probable that the tank is n't moving again . 
  i would bet that if it got hit in the face it probably would survive . 
  at the time much of the country was in the hands of fsa , nusra and isis ( it still is , but to a lesser degree ) . 
  so my point was that if assad had no power ( or it was extremely limited ) , russia would have no power . 
  if usa did n't do anything ( they pretty much did n't ) and let assad stabilize the country then assad would be back at power , right ? 
  and with assad at power , russia would have power . 
  so yes , assad is russia-aligned , but if assad has no power , russia has no power . 
  is n't that almost always the case , though ? 
  if you look at any feminist ( i ca n't talk for all women , obviously . 
  only those that fight for equality or say they do ) organisation webpage ( [ example ] ( http://www.aauw.org/what-we-do/ ) ) there is a very good chance you 'll only find cases where women are being discriminated . 
  if you look at the webpage i brought out you can see they fight for more women in stem fields , but what about more women as miners or welders ? 
  draft ? 
  lighter sentencing for women ? 
  they do not bring these out as their mission and from there i can take a leap and assume that they 're not against them . 
  if you 're saying you fight for equality but only for women 's rights i 'd assume you 're advocating for these inequalities . 
  and when someone posts about a saudi execution it just starts off with 3000 upvotes ? 
   that seems to me like arguing that since animal rights groups only show examples of animals being mistreated but do n't mention animal attacks that they must not be opposed to animals attacking humans . 
  if they said they were fighting for a kind of peace ( how would that work , i do n't know ) between animals and humans and then do n't mention anything about animal attacks , then indeed . 
  but they do n't . 
  they only say they fight for animal rights . 
  these kind of sites tend to say that they fight for ** `` equality between genders '' ** . 
  now fair enough , aauw does n't say it that much , it is mentioned under research , though . 
   just to be clear , by ` these kinds of sites ' you are referring generally to the websites of groups working to better women 's lives which also have ` equality between genders ' as a goal ? 
  yes . 
   the first is that gender equality is a big issue with many parts . 
  it makes sense for different groups to work on different parts of that issue . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  handling that takes resources and resources are limited . 
   or for a less volatile subject , a group dedicated to feeding malnourished children may focus on only one country or region even if they desire an end to hunger worldwide . 
  this could be because that is the area they are familiar with and passionate about or because they simply do n't have the resources to do more than that . 
  there is a very important distinction here , though . 
  1 ) if you say you want to end world hunger , but only do it in nigeria , because you do n't have the resources then fair enough . 
  2 ) if you say you want to end world hunger , but only do it in nigeria , because you only feel passionate about nigerian children , then i would argue that you 're really not working to solve world hunger . 
  sure , you 're contributing towards it , but in the end solving world hunger does n't really matter to you . 
  what matters is that children in nigeria do n't starve . 
  you would stop when nigerian children are no longer starving . 
  same seems to be with these feminist sites ( i am not saying all of them do it and aauw seems to be pretty mild as well , but it * is * there ) . 
  the resources thing we can also throw out of the window because typing a few hundred more words ( to start it off ) on their webpage would n't make a big difference in spending , i 'm sure . 
  the goal of these sites seems to be to eliminate the injustices that do n't benefit them . 
  while if their ultimate goal was gender equality they try to eliminate injustices that benefit them , also , especially if they are very closely related ( i.e they want more engineers instead of waiters , which is fine , but they absolutely do not want less nurses ( where women are overrepresented , like they say in stem fields men are overrepresented . ), 
  for more builders , welders or truck drivers . 
  a long-tailed arboreal asian monkey with a characteristic loud call . 
  su-27 and su-30m2 , correct ? 
  do you differentiate by bort number or by something else ? 
  i really do n't see how armed populace fares any better against a tyrant , honestly . 
  the government has much * much * better weapons , logistics and all of that stuff . 
  you ca n't really fight a tank or a bomber with ar-15 , can you ? 
  the best things against tanks that insurgents use are mines ( which , correct me if i am wrong , civilians ca n't but anyway ) and even then they do n't pose a huge threat as a well-taught sappers can easily get rid of them ( mines just slow things down ) . 
  against a foreign power usa has the armed forces . 
  if the whole country is n't taken by storm ( and i do n't see how it could be taken that way ) the men who would be insurgents would be drafted anyway . 
   in every single revolt ever , the populace found access to weapons to be immensly helpful . 
  as technology advances they become less and less helpful . 
  anyway , how are you going to keep up the supplies ? 
  if there 's no foreign country aiding you with logistics , supplies , anti tank weaponry etc. 
  then you are pretty much left for dead anyway . 
  is it worth the civilian casualties in everyday life to get a little head start in the fight against tyranny ? 
   there are countless examples of guerilla fighters successfully resisting a technologically superior enemy . 
  pretty much all of them with massive foreign help . 
  drones , heat-seeking cameras etc. 
  make guerilla warfare quite a lot harder . 
  also if you disregard some ethics then there are some very good ways to fight against guerillas . 
   why attack a tank , when you can wait for the tank driver to fall asleep and kill him in his barracks ?
