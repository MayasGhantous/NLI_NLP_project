  germany invaded it 's neighbors but apparently everyone is quite fine with them nowardays as they payed for their fines and apologized . 
  my point is that either 10 countries are somehow all randomly anti-russian or russia is the reason . 
  it 's not like one day finnish , estonians , latvians randomly went `` hey in 5 minutes lets randomly turn against russia '', 
  it might be a sign of a troubled ukrainian army but having been through basic training believe me . 
  if you are on the field and have to nibble on ration packages they do n't exactly go for taste when composing such food supplies . 
  i am sorry this is a lie . 
  you do n't go in `` protecting '' people by shooting them . 
  read the books , research on the internet . 
  soviet union lost quite a lot of troops fighting against polish troops . 
  about us sending troops to baltics . 
  us sent ~ ~ 600 ~ ~ 150 troopers to estonia . 
  you tell me . 
  are the ~ ~ 600 ~ ~ 150 troops a threat to russia ? 
  or are they more about a symbolic support to estonian people ? 
  i think simon was simply more ballsy and a huge help bwas being able to speak the language . 
  simon did talk to locals but he looked for `` more colorful '' people . 
  i do n't think these reports are mea n't as talking to normal people . 
  they drive to the epicenter of happenings and film whats going on getting interviews of people being part of these events . 
  the local people you commented where next to a bmp apc so it was that the reason he was there . 
  thanks , i did a fast google and mistook the total 600 as the number sent to estonia . 
  it is 150 as you said , fixed my original post . 
  as a estonian a contingent of some nato troops to be present are to me as a de facto protection . 
  i care for what is happening in ukraine but the behind the scene games is murky at best . 
  obviously all sides of the conflict throw as much mud at each other as possible . 
  i am looking at facts . 
  the biggest fact is crimea was annexed . 
  the fact is russia has held war games near baltic borders in recent times . 
  now again i am not hiding in my basement thinking an attack is imminent or even theoretically going to happen . 
  i am saying having actual nato troops in a time of tension when a neighbor of estonia just annexed another countries territory into itself is reassuring . 
  after all why be in a military union if they would n't show support ? 
  having the possibility of a false flag attack that escalates is like being afraid of a comet hitting in some sense . 
  such attacks can be done at any time for any reason , history actually shows that most of the more famous recent wars in my region started with such false flags . 
  winter war , supposedly finland shelled a village ( although no such caliber guns were nearby for the reason to avoid tension ) , germans attack on poland ( supposedly polish soldiers attacked a german border post or was it a radio tower ? 
  ) , su starting the annexation of estonia ( estonia supposedly helped a polish sub escape thereby not being a neutral country ) . 
  i do agree that having foreign nationality troops is n't exactly nice but again . 
  a neighbor of estonia , russia just annexed territory . 
  the guy doing it , putin even hinted at baltic countries being next . 
  it was more of an ironic remark but joking on such details is n't what a world leader should do in my opinion . 
  sandler had a couple of good ones . 
  sandlers biggest letdown was ` filler humor ' . 
  the slapstick jokes were constantly reused in his movies and seriously got old , his movies seem to be stuck in 2000-1990s . 
  `` you can do it ! '', 
  guy cameo can only be funny a couple of times . 
  lately he simply seems to be producing semi-crap movies knowing enough people will watch , for him to get some profit . 
  ** waterboy ** , ** mr.deeds ** were nice , fables for grownups . 
  ** happy gilmore ** one of the first and a classic . 
  ** bid daddy ** and ** click ** were a slightly more mature take on sandler . 
  click even had a nice drama element . 
  ** anger management ** also was quite good . 
  ca n't go wrong with old jack . 
  give him a role and watch him go . 
  i 'm actually amazed i have watched 6 sandler movies that i consider good . 
  now sandlers like a bad version of nicolas cage . 
  south park probably summed it up best with the `` rob schneider derp the derp the derp '' skit . 
  that 's like telling a person you should n't think of a pink elephant . 
  cool awesome military grade stuff that you are supposed to not see and touch is inviting . 
  also a human law is when the number of people in a group increases the time until someone does something stupid cuts in half with every additional person . 
  well depending on a teacher and a kid i can perfectly well see it happening . 
  such serious topic jokes used to break the routine in classes for me . 
  some teachers were pretty sarcastic and cruel also depending on the joke . 
  thanks for the kind reply . 
  i did search but did n't think to search with those specific keywords that would of come up with those threads . 
  reading those threads makes it quite clear it is a fairly common story . 
  still does n't seem like no one really knows the exact origin where the story originated , as far as i have read those threads . 
  are you talking about encircling or taking cities ? 
  encircling is done with a lot less troops than taking one . 
  the history of wwii is sieges against other armies in cities . 
  granted if you want to attack an army anywhere , city or not , you probably should outmatch them in numbers . 
  i do n't think there were any `` same and similar objectives '', 
  you brought up grozny but it seems like you did n't remember what happened there yourself . 
  russia bombed the city more or less to the ground and after that had to search every corner and piece of stone for rebels . 
  if wiki is to believed the rebels had 3000-6000 active troops . 
  the whole city was considered a combat zone at that point ( why else bomb it from air and ground ? ) . 
  currently the threat can come from any part of the city but they can take `` control '' by simply getting the important buildings and by patrolling the main streets to show presence and keep order from any rebels blocking or taking over important buildings/locations . 
  there really is n't a reason to consider the entire part of eastern ukraine as diehard gun toting rebels nor their major cities . 
  how many consistent fighting men with guns have the rebels produced through the whole region ? 
  ( serious question actually , i have n't gotten a source for numbers ) . 
  i have seen only road blocks set up inside the city and on roads where they had any serious weapons . 
  so far if there has been news of ukrainian army in eastern ukraine it 's how they stormed a building/roadblock . 
  how they lost 2 attack helicopters and if they are moving they either get stopped by civilians or manage to lose an apc here and there . 
  not really a grozny of setting up a battle line and bombing a city from air and ground . 
  more like trying to avoid stirring more shit up as much as possible . 
  so far they can move pretty well even in the most hostile regions . 
  there are skirmish battles here and there but the death toll of rebel fighters with guns vs ukrainian army is n't that big in terms of daily confrontations ( if reports are to believed but seems like media on both sides reacts pretty quick to any skirmishes/battles ) . 
  estonian here ( baltic state ), 
  estonians say :, 
  ema / isa ( formal ), 
  emme / issi ( small children / `` cute '' version ), 
  vanaema / vanaisa ( grandma / grandpa , literally old + mom ; old + dad ), 
  the word opa or opaa is used as an expression and means `` sit on lap '' in my language . 
  have n't even heard that opa is used as dad or mom somewhere . 
  this is becoming strange . 
  i ca n't find my source but something similar supposedly happened with germans ` liberating ' estonia from soviets . 
  basically a group of local estonians who sided with germany were making the best progress and were the first to reach tallinn but german high command called them to hold position out of fear that they would reach the city first . 
  it would cause too much dissidence showing the locals that their own troops are capable of fighting and on face value out performing german counterparts on their own territory . 
  so a more suitable german unit was found who got the honor of being the first to `` fight their way '' to the city . 
  now again i do n't remember where i read it or if it was even a trusted source but it does make you wonder how much political game was going on even in the thick of fighting . 
  i mean soviets had their politburo agents sent with army groups to make sure every unit acted with enough zeal . 
  simon ostrovsky is back, 
  this time ...
