  i bet most of them would prefer a more armored personnel carrier than a lada . 
  it obviously does save couple of seconds/minutes depending on the distance to determine who these guys exactly are but i would think the benefits are secondary . 
  in order to engage they would have to dismount anyway unless they want to uncomfortably try to find a firing position inside a cramped car . 
  you do know that by most models trace back homo sapiens being evolved on the african continent so any land is actually owned by african nations if you use your own faulty logic . 
  the current baltic state area was settled in the mesolithic period by swiderian culture ( formed in current polish territory ) that smoothly went over to the kunda culture and from there the narva and neman cultures . 
  it more or less follows how it happened in western europe , same way the ice sheet melted and people moved up to settle as the lands got habitable . 
  then it evolved into the next culture of corded ware that more or less was something of an empire in terms of land area with similar styles for pottery , tools . 
  at some time period also the finno ugric people came and settled the finnish and estonian territory and what is now north western russian territories . 
  so the inhabitants and the new blood mixed , also the language was changed to finno-ugric from whatever people used back then . 
  russia pre-history saw more or less the tribes coming out of africa/middle east area go upward and settle the step lands and slowly creep up towards the modern russia region as they did with the rest of europe . 
  i ca n't seem to mark down a lot of different culture references as it seems not much has been documented . 
  it 's obvious that what we consider russia then had a ton of different tribes some more akin to baltic tribes , some more akin to finno-ugric people and some unique in their own way . 
  the moscow/ukraine area were in the corded ware culture so at that point most of europe were getting similar ideas and developed quite hand-in-hand . 
  the modern reasoning of where russia got started when the `` east slavs '' who mostly came from current belorussian/ukrainian lands took over other local cultures and got dominance . 
  in terms of getting the name rus or baltic/estonian/finn association it happened more or less in the same time period of 900 to 1100 ad . 
  there were earlier references of roman tacticians and other people making references to these people but the namecalling began when nations started forming . 
  rus is under dispute as it can actually be a finnish word as the first real guy to gather up a nation there was by modern research a finno-ugric , good old rurik . 
  the word rus and modern russia could either mean simply a southern tribe that was similar to the word rus or the finno ugri word for `` the men who row '' as people who traveled the region of the origin of the rus state mostly used rowboats to get around . 
  russians called finno-ugris chudes ( was sometimes applied to finnish , estonians to relatively late like 15th or 17th century ) , balts called them by relatively close towns , finns/estonians called them by a loanword from german influence to categorize slavs etc. 
  we more or less all developed and happened at the same time and our nations are quite intertwined . 
  for example north russians are much more like finno-ugrians and south russians are likewise like belorussians/ukrainians than north russians are similar to south russians . 
  balts are inbetween somewhere . 
  the rus people at first were also quite multi ethnic , it was formed out of balts , finno-ugris , slavs and probably other tribes . 
  in some way it could be even considered a baltic/finno ugric/slavic superstate . 
  although as history would show west got in the way and conquered baltic areas first . 
  southern baltics went to germany and finland went to sweden . 
  think about the future years trying to remember what bans were imposed . 
  `` guy we seem to have lost all our goats . '', 
  `` oh fuu ... i totally forgot , we banned goat sperm ! '', 
  `` quick send shipments to irelands for goatsperm , get those hands busy people ! '', 
  not really , bioware games did become more earning oriented but i would dare anyone to say that mass effect or dragon age are n't good rpg series . 
  sw : tor was a hugely milking machine but again , we are talking about ea here , the game itself was actually again good . 
  bioware know their rpg genre . 
  casey hudson worked on a lot of good bioware titles ( mdk , neverwinter , bg2 : soa etc ) but in these games he was a technical artist or some `` less prominent '' roles ( but still saw the old team in action ) . 
  he did more or less give us jade empire , kotor 1 and mass effect . 
  at least was in a role to hugely affect it and get it into production in the first place . 
  so you have to give him that , he created the newer-bio games that were all gems in their own right . 
  ea has given us lots and lots of stupid money milking dlc 's but the money they can put into production has boosted the quality of the bioware titles by a lot . 
  they get a lot of money put into the games and they can work their magic . 
  i would take that deal with the devil ( working under ea ) if they continue to build on such successes as mass effect and dragon age . 
  seriously me i put off for so long as it felt like some cheap ea title but once i played the first one i was hooked . 
  i 'm the person who played their old stuff like bg series , neverwinter etc. 
  they still go it and i am sure the team is qualified enough even with him gone . 
  estonian here . 
  some of these pictures if not all are in kauna talu , estonia . 
  this was picked up on our media . 
  our own special police , mild `` fbi or fsb '' , investigated the place and did n't find anything illegal or sinister going on . 
  it is a youth camp establishment . 
  the group in pictures seems to be `` plast '' that is more akin to boyscouts movement . 
  the weapons and armaments are registered to the local kaitseliit , basically the estonian equivalent of home guard , civilians who are n't professional military but still like to defend their homeland and train for it . 
  these guys range from local boyscouts to ex-military guys who still like to be around guns and outdoors , or random people who do this for fun and a break from common life routine . 
  where else can you get a license to paradrop or blow up explosives ? 
  so take what you will for the guys , the group who came there might have nationalistic views but such a camp is n't for training terrorists exactly . 
  well they obviously get some military knowledge as the camp offers such recreational activities but as they are linked with kaitseliit the affiliation probably stops there . 
  so going by logic and local knowledge , it seems to simply be more of an awesome summer camp with guns and less about training next generation terrorists . 
  ** edit : ** also the only neo-nazi stuff i seem to see is that one guy who wears one of the `` white power '' symbol shirt , is also wearing the german hat and doing the nazi salute in another picture . 
  oh and the red/black flag that was brought with them . 
  ** edit2 : ** one source proclaims that the local group who came did have connections to the ukrainian nationalists , that some estonian nato officer was present ( not specified if active duty or who he exactly is ) and the topic of the camp was supposedly terrorism and insurgency . 
  only problem the source being a supposed homepage that has by now been taken down . 
  also it strangely is an ukrainian site ( ukraine . ua domain name and the main site language was russian or ukrainian ) . 
  so not sure if the edit2 info is to be trusted or not as the site ca n't be viewed anymore . 
  well they are local press so the articles are in estonian . 
  it 's quite an `` old '' story though . 
  they do give the camp owner name and general information about the establishment that i already wrote down . 
  amazing alright , there is nothing left . 
  seems like a strange thing to fire upon , was it an accessible monument or why was it so completely demolished ? 
  i remember watching this . 
  it was like watching indiana jones , only real and a documentary . 
  go watch it now !, 
  [ minor spoiler ], 
  i mean in what film does the main journalist drink vodka , hire a local mob goon to drive them around , shoot a rifle to deter local camp guards and break into an area using an ex-police chief . 
  estonia the same . 
  `` ameerika m\u00e4ed '' or american mountains . 
  estonia used 3d printer to copy potato and make 10s and 10s of potato !, 
  sadly estonia hacked by politburo so ca n't make more , also potato not edible . 
  tried . 
  give me an example of an engine that does not use aesthetics and filters to make a game look better . 
  if you doubt it was unintentional then you would think it was intentional . 
  the creepiest part to me is how all the guys ashes were piled at their neat position at the back of the truck . 
  having been in similar situations of riding with 6-8 guys in gear at the back of an uncovered truck i sort of imagined myself in that position . 
  the idea of these if the doctrine/tactics are similar in ukraine is to actually return fire if ambushed . 
  they did look like they got hit by something strong enough to knock all of them unconscious and they sort of burned to ash on their initial seating positions . 
  scary . 
  the name of the map is fuel dump . 
  used to play the shit out of et . 
  it did n't have a lot of official maps but boy were they good and big . 
  gold rush was probably my favorite map , the progression of escorting a tank and later a truck made this map quite hectic and you always knew clearly where the enemy was at with progression . 
  i know even a better loophole , russia should rename itself russia2 . 
  no more nuclear armament regulations , no more promises of anything . 
  cause you know , we are russia2 , not russia . 
  i am sure these countries ** do n't ** have large stocks of russian equipment . 
  baltic countries use a fare share of swedish , german and us equipment among others . 
  very little soviet era equipment remains in service , depends on the specific baltic country . 
  so unless they secretly keep stockpiles of soviet era equipment in working order in some hidden storage facilities no one knows about , i ca n't see see the logic behind your comment . 
  why mention finland besides sweden for estonia ? 
  israel , sweden , germany are the main guys . 
  why mention britain for latvia ? 
  as far as i can see they only bought one types of vehicles from them and even they are not fully delivered . 
  some swedish stuff ? 
  their anti-air relies on swedish equipment , most of their anti-tank is old swedish stuff and they use swedish transportation vehicles besides germany and us ones .
