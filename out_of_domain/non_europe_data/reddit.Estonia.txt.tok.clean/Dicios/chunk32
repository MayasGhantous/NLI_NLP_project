  hitlers idea on supporting the ukraine front was probably not his own decision and he still had some generals giving him advice on the matter . 
  it 's kind of a hard decision to make . 
  a moral victory of starting an assault on moscow or strategic victory of guaranteeing fuel supply . 
  assault on moscow would of not been fast with the extra fortification time or not . 
  the obvious answer is hitler was the reason any of the wars started when they started at all . 
  so he and his staff were at least ` brilliant ' enough to know when is the time to strike . 
  he was also lenient enough with his commanders to even allow them to take decisions . 
  as we saw from the su side they might of had good commander but the chain of command was that long that no one was willing to act on their own . 
  so just for providing and not stopping commanders deciding stuff was arguably his good decision . 
  part of the reason why it was called `` bad decisions '' is because there were n't really good ones left . 
  most of the bad ones just happened to be at the ending stages of ww2 , wonder why right . 
  the fights that germany lost became `` bad decisions '' or in other words `` might of been a better option '' . 
  before it was victory after victory so it was n't clear if a bad decision was made or if a better option was present . 
  for example if he allowed north group to retreat what good of it done to hitler ? 
  su would of gained land and probably broken through again . 
  it was his last `` 10 % we might hold and still get su '' gamble . 
  it was n't inherently bad decision . 
  so i would say even hitler could n't balls it up . 
  german loss was put into motion before any of these assaults as the su factories started slowly but surely producing huge amounts of equipment and russians got mobilized . 
  the breakthrough in ardennes could arguably be called a bad decision as hitler deciding on the assault lost valuable forces by attacking instead of digging in to defend . 
  some divisions even ran out of fuel midway the push so obviously if they stayed put in an area they would of lost less fuel than a full on final push assault . 
  this is probably the best proof there is . 
  a realistic video of border guards from both sides discussing this on the scene . 
  inb4 rt claims `` russian border guards who were on the spot bought out by estonians to sign false testimony and talk lies '', 
  i bet the next trip her parents will want like daily photos of newspaper and her to bring a local person into the skype chat and show his or her passport . 
  wait , does that mean my grandma who has lived at least 15 years longer so far since his husband died actually hated the man ? 
  does it work backward ? 
  waiting for a `` revenge '' one from hannah . 
  - lewis = ross, 
  - simon = joey, 
  - duncan = uuuhh ... rachel i guess as `` ross '' kissed him . 
  - sips = chandler, 
  - hannah = monica ( arguably she is quite monica ), 
  it streamlined a lot and arguably changed the most going from 4 to 5 ( no stacks , hexagons , global attributes for happiness etc ) so it did change a lot of the mechanics . 
  it was never a bad game though . 
  this is like a very bad sexual innuendo . 
  one great tip for spelling definitely that always stuck with me is first spell `` finite '' ( as most know ) in your mind and then simply add the `` de '' `` ly '' parts . 
  statements like `` it is pure nationalistic pride '' makes it obvious you have no idea what you are talking about . 
  educate with the terms of non-citizen , what exactly lies behind that term and what rights they actually have or do n't . 
  also giving a complete opposite faction who has no idea what your nation is , citizenship is suicide . 
  it 's like creating a nation of taliban and usa patriots with one being a minority . 
  you might live in your la la land but as current situation in sweden , germany , france or ukraine shows mixing radically opposing factions will not work . 
  besides in the case of estonia arguably the policy has worked . 
  from 32 % of non-citizens to the current 6.5 % without any fiasco scenarios like ukraine crimea or having swedish right parties get power . 
  the `` unfortunate '' word immediately made me think of this :, 
  - ariel - `` foreign russian citizens '', 
  - potion - `` russian aid '', 
  edit : oh gawd , even the parallel of taking `` their voice '' ( censorship ) . 
   what opposite faction ? 
  terms like `` brother nations '' was product of soviet era . 
  whole policy was built around idea of unification . 
  this conflict is absolutely artificial and driven not by evil russians , but by `` oppressed '' baltic people which are majority . 
  what do you afraid of ? 
  along the term `` brother nations '' we also learned new terms like `` siberia '' , `` gulag '' , `` work battalion '' , `` kgb '' , `` nkvd '' , `` enemy of nation '' , `` deportation '' , `` official history '' , `` russification '' , `` censorship '' , `` ban of national emblems '' , `` 5 year plans '' and all the wonderful reasoning and action that came with it . 
  finland was also a `` brother nation '' until they did n't accept su land demands . 
  suddenly when you do n't accept russian/su policies you become oh such a threat . 
  i wonder why ? 
  if by `` driven by baltic people '' means `` russia stop policing our country and do what you are supposed to do , govern russia not estonia , latvia , lithuania '' then yes . 
   and it is exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  people who got citizenship does n't magically became estonian , they are still russian . 
  it could have been this way from the day one with 0 non-citizens . 
  like in belarus and ukraine . 
  and on matter of ukraine if they would have non-citizens whole conflict could have been much bloodier and a lot earlier . 
  that is what you are talking about ? 
  those 32 % had to make an effort to get estonian citizenship . 
  they showed they want it and acknowledge that such a thing exists . 
  those who did n't get it by default had to prove their very bare minimum knowledge of what estonia is and estonian language so they can function in estonia . 
  if the news came on with `` all evacuate estonia theater , a bomb thread has been made '' in estonian they would know to get the hell out . 
  you are confusing nationality with ethnicity , among estonian russians there are still a lot of ethnic russians , the point is they proved that they know what estonia is about . 
  basic knowledge of why they should be estonian citizens . 
  your try at twisting ukraine `` as a good example of granting citizenship '' by saying `` the bloodbath would of began quicker '' is demonstrably false . 
  latvia , estonia ethnic russians live peacefully with this arrangement in the baltics . 
  the country that allowed everyone , ukraine is having a war . 
  i do n't see how you could possibly explain yourself this reasoning . 
   what ? 
  please provide examples of radically opposing factions in each of this countries . 
  even in ukraine it is political crisis not ethnic . 
  germany , france has problems with an increased migrant wave who formed town communities , did n't want to integrate and in france had big riots as second generation immigrants did n't accept second rated jobs that their parents were happy with . 
  so in fact they created a secret second citizenship of entire sub-groups . 
  also problems with muslim minority extremists who by their own law require sharia laws and zones . 
  sweden has similar reasons with recently having a right party win elections who as one of their main political messages will limit migration quotas to deal with the problem . 
  ukraine obviously had a civil war while their ethnic groups , while historically distinct ( kiev rus and moscovites ) , were actually similar , still a civil war . 
  even a small spark set this off . 
  the real reason is that in case of estonia they are getting away with it and russia is losing one of their trump cards . 
  estonia had again , 32 % non-citizens , a huge number . 
  now their political play card of `` oppressed people '' is 6,5 % . 
  they are losing some 0 . % every year . 
  estonia is steadily fixing the issue by integrating people by having them take basic tests on citizenship knowledge and language to function in the country . 
  soon russia wo n't be able to use the `` they have non-citizens ! '', 
  card . 
  also you still did n't check what it means . 
  basically a non-citizen has every right besides parliamentary voting . 
  they can travel , have pensions , have an actual passport issued , can vote in local elections and every other right besides giving the ability to vote for parliamentary elections to determine the government . 
  the idea behind the original reasoning is that the minority was from a former enemy and a very large percentage . 
  political suicide once again , we had no idea how would they react to an independent nation . 
  hell russia had no idea what russia or russians were about emerging from the su . 
  estonia had two decisions . 
  accept everyone and have a foreign ethnicity with 30 % minority who might cause political tension from the get go or continue the state where it left off . 
  estonia chose to continue the fairly stable state of pre-annexation . 
  basically from our standpoint su annexed us and used their `` livingspace '' program to use animal trains to cart people out of estonia and bring foreign people in to make a state lose its stability and unity as an ethnicity .
