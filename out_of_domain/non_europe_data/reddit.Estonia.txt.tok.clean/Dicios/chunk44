  fixed that for you . 
  would n't want to diminish the deaths of others who also died fighting the axis . 
  also could you break down that 20 million . 
  what region where they from ? 
  civilian ? 
  military ? 
  sources ? 
  edit : as a foot note this is n't meant as an offense , reread my comment and thought it would seem like one ( in todays politically correct world i guess every question seems like this ) . 
  i am honestly interested though what exactly do people usually mean by 20 million lost . 
  are the other annexed republics part of that number ? 
  or how does russian press transcribe the 20 million to belong to ? 
   the use of `` n '' in replacement of the `` p '' is sometimes done because they used to be reffered to as donetsk national republic, 
  i do n't think so . 
  it 's simply translation in ukrainian/russian . 
  dpr is english for donetsk peoples rebublic, 
  dnr is just in russian , donetsk narodny respublica, 
  so dnr is the same in russian/ukrainian as dpr in english . 
  same way cccp is sometimes sssr or ussr as the acronym taken sometimes is the original non translated version . 
  so what part of that page do you think is true ? 
  i do n't see the 20 million number anywhere with sources , even the first sentence gives no sources and says it 's over 20 million . 
  a poetic variant would also be something like `` armu endasse '' or fall in love with yourself . 
  or `` ennek\u00f5ike / k\u00f5igepealt armu endasse '' if you need the `` before anyone else '' part . 
  also gets the cool letter \u00d5 . 
  also the `` armasta end '' variations sound the most logical to a native speaker . 
  a nice wordplay if you think about it with the `` end '' doubling as an english word so kind of like `` love - end '' . 
  or add `` ennek\u00f5ike '' part to add the `` before anyone else '' meaning back to it . 
  ennek\u00f5ike basically means `` enne '' - before and `` k\u00f5ike '' - everything . 
  so a neat word to represent `` beforeeverything '' . 
  `` first of all '' is `` estiteks '' so it would be `` esiteks armasta iseennast '' or you can get away with `` esiteks armasta ennast '' or `` esiteks armasta end '' . 
  basically `` iseennast - ennast - end '' are what happens in other languages also , people simply pronounce less and less of an original word until the `` slang '' becomes an officially used word , they still mean the same thing . 
  in english , `` you are '' became `` you 're '' or `` god be with ye '' became `` good bye '' . 
  similar to the english `` you are/you 're '' `` iseennast '' seems the most official way to write , `` end '' seems the most informal . 
  so depends on your taste of how classy it has to be . 
  yay , such a nice post . 
  well i think we share a little kinship with brits in terms of being ultra cynical , not having a constant `` have a nice day '' smile on our face and obviously , shitty weather . 
  you also are a gentleman that understands the finer things in life as is very cheap beer , more importantly totally passable quality tasting cheap beer . 
  also keep visiting before we start turning into semi-helsinki in terms of prices , they are slowly going up and so is the tax on alcohol . 
  lets hope fins drink enough here to keep the politicians sane on not pricing it too high . 
  so i say pip pip old chap , nice to ave ye !, 
  you can claim false flag on everything , the point is if you can prove it . 
  providing `` proof '' in style of `` well it totally suited their agenda '' is not proof that would hold up in court as they say . 
  same way anti-ukraine people could plant a bomb for the reason to claim false flag on ukraine sided people and cause havoc among the ranks . 
  this is n't how people should argue , you ca n't simply false flag any attack that is from your side and every attack that is from the other side to be valid . 
  seems like ukraine is a bunch of hitlers fighting angles . 
  so far not 1 stay bullet from separatists and every bad deed in the war is ukraine or ukraine false flag . 
  well i am getting my information from mostly western based media outlets and `` independent '' online media outlets , so `` pro-ukrainian '' side just by living in a western oriented culture bubble . 
  most media outlets do n't like to mention it but it is pretty clear who was shelling donbas . 
  at least it is n't `` false flag , rebels shelling their own troops and town ! '', 
  as is now common when their side is mostly on the offensive . 
  pro-ukraine media found a mostly `` mid road '' of going for `` yes we are doing this but some victims are also counter artillery and they have been shelling from populated areas '' as was visible in some videos of them really having grads next to regular housing . 
  most shells probably were mishaps as certain artillery is not that accurate but they hoped for the best . 
  not that it makes any difference to the people who lost family or friends . 
  to them its obviously ukraine fault . 
  but again at least western media is n't reporting false flags as main news . 
  the bus shelling comes to mind how it became `` a ukraine false flag mine '' . 
  i would say that if a bad event happened that they caused , ukraine sided media would simply avoid reporting it while russian sided media would make up some semi conspiracy theory . 
  by ukranian media i mismatched terms . 
  i mea n't it as `` western '' but i do see that ukraine itself might be more propaganda oriented . 
  after all when your country is at war you try to bs in your own favor as much as possible . 
  this is kind of a direct counter for both sides to seem stronger , also internally if things are bad people are more likely to cause distress , one domino falls , others start tipping . 
  more so in a fairly western society as is ukraine , people are smart enough not to want to get recruited into the area . 
  have n't actually viewed any actual ukraine tv channel broadcasts , mostly due to them not spreading that much over here or any other site that picks up on interesting stuff . 
  well besides ukraine today but that is a counter to russia today more or less . 
  as for the bombing i would say there are a lot more plausible scenarios beside `` rebels did it '' , `` ukraine false flag '' . 
  it takes 1 person to organize this . 
  it could of just been someone who even sympathized with rebel views . 
  just like any crazy who bombs houses or parades , or organizes anything evil and harmful to others . 
  ukraine government also lost a lot from this as news spreads and other near eastern regions are less likely to show open support as they are less likely to organize similar parades ( or open air events ) in fright of getting bombed so more `` closeted '' support for ukraine . 
  your idea for revenge of a killed relative is even good enough . 
  people who lost someone do n't always think straight anyway and the parade had ( as far as i gathered from the news ) military uniformed people in it . 
  this is in fact what causes people to snap , a dramatic event in life . 
  this however again is us two throwing theories into the wind , some might seem more valid than others . 
  it 's more potent if news outlets run with such theories instead of reporting from all sides and relying mostly on what happened without adding more to the news to sensationalize it . 
  give estonia some credit for not giving a f. :p, 
  i mean sure it does escalate but what is there to escalate ? 
  even the cold war was n't this practically dangerous . 
  russia actually has annexed territory this time !, 
  we should n't ass-kiss such action . 
  yes it is n't as black and white and crimea probably would of joined but russia meddled in this situation by sending in their own `` green men '' ( confirmed by putin ) and barricaded any nay-sayers or ukrainian army on the peninsula . 
  so how it was done is not exactly nice . 
  simply call on russias bullshit and do n't let them be `` hey you ca n't have a parade so close !, 
  but it sure as hell ok for us to actually cross borders and send our military there !, 
  hey you ca n't escalate and send equipment to ukraine but we sure as hell can ! '', 
  i am not totally 100 % but i am pretty sure only a `` symbolic '' unit was there , so like 4-5 vehicles . 
  as media often does it makes it seem like only us was there and it was an us only parade . 
  2 semi-myths that i actually looked into and did my own research . 
  1 ) what is an ukrainian government ? 
  4 pillars of the actual government were left standing . 
  that is the cabinet the prime minister and the parliament . 
  it is such a lie every time someone says `` the government was ousted '' . 
  no it was the same government since 2012 i believe ( maybe 2011 or 2010 ) . 
  just because the president went missing and was at first illegally replaced does n't mean the government was . 
  this is n't russia . 
  the president does have less power and the `` government '' is mostly governed by cabinet + pm + parliament . 
  2 ) those us donations go around the world . 
  it 's one of the ways us builds friends . 
  plenty of republics where us sends money and it does n't cause uprisings . 
  my own country got about 300,000 dollars per month at first from us for support . 
  africa gets tons of support from america , europe and probably other countries . 
  russia itself if i 'm not gravely mistaken still gets support .
