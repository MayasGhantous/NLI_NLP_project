  became fully operational in 2014 . 
  it was also big enough with large production rooms . 
  a proper factory . 
  not just some offices somewhere . 
  so they are springing up . 
  not 1000 per factory but if you go by years and add up all the employees you will get some 1000 factories . 
  as for gdp that 1 person would still benefit others in form of taxes . 
  unemployment , people working aboard , wealth gap will be mostly shown in taxes gotten at some time . 
  it will all end up in that statistic . 
  obviously it is n't the perfect statistic , even by your given examples . 
  it 's basically the statistical equivalent of stereotyping an average but it does more or less work at showing the general healthiness of a population . 
  we do n't have that many `` 1 billion earners '' who would boost our gdp . 
  bacteria is bacteria . 
  basically the answer is cheaper/easier . 
  probably also as she could and knew how to . 
  if the female genitals contain the same bacteria they use in making yogurt why not use some of her own ? 
  its like going to the store on the bottom floor . 
  i find it is the same argument of `` wrong '' for people who drink breast milk . 
  in essence it is milk but the `` taboo '' obviously comes from us eating something out of a human made . 
  like mild-cannibalism . 
  humans aside we do eat a lot of strange stuff , be it chicken skin or ground up cheaper parts of an animal inside their intestines in form of sausages . 
  well unless you are a vegan or do n't eat those particular items . 
  also a lot of stuff people have made because `` it got bad '' but we got used to eating or drinking it . 
  so we kind of engineered a way to store or prolong products . 
  there are no bounds to mankinds laziness . 
  the sandwich i threw together in 20 min today was an afterthought . 
  turned out to be the best part of the meal . 
  what if dinos were the et 's but the last person who came crashed the bloody ship and caused the extinction . 
  now they kind of avoid earth because it reminds them of fking up . 
  they are quietly thinking on their planet `` pshh ... do you think earthlings have the technology to know we meddled with their stuff ? '', 
  ** do you feel like skills were unlocked too slowly , or at just the right pace for you to fully understand what they did and when to use them ? 
  a tiny bit faster would be nice . 
  i do like the concept of you getting to know the skills by giving you them at a certain pace . 
  ** did you backtrack to earlier areas to get map completion things ( points of interest , vistas , skill points ) that were locked when you were first , or did you skip over them entirely ? 
  well did n't really have to backtrack , the points were on the map . 
  it just did n't direct me toward them . 
  i completed vistas in first area before i `` unlocked vistas '' . 
  i can see what they were going for with removing the initial `` ohmygod !, 
  so much information ! '', 
  affect but it can counteract as i got initially confused what they were as there was no information . 
  i had to level to like 7 or whatever to actually be 100 % sure what they do . 
  oh so those assassins creed style view points are called vistas was basically my reaction . 
  ** did you enjoy the early leveling ? 
  yes as it was a new game , it made it enjoyable . 
  the only thing that annoyed me is that there is/was no way to disable the `` story mode here ! '', 
  marker on top . 
  what if i want the guide to point me toward area goals instead of my story mission . 
  ** do you think that leveling was tedious and will deter you from making more characters ( so you do n't have to mash 1 again ) ? 
  compared to other mmo 's no . 
  although the game context is n't that different . 
  story missions sure but the end game grind is similar to all . 
  so i 'm kind of off put by the idea that i have to go through pretty much the same stuff and as my main is level 80 by now i find myself constantly logging in with that one as i feel bad for sacrificing my time playing while getting inferior non level 80 loot . 
  this also plays into the whole achievement hoarding . 
  as they are account bound there is n't that much motivation to use alts . 
  most achievements can be gotten with your main rushing every area of the game . 
  another thing about this is that you kind of have to gear towards a certain character with your skin unlocks ( 1000 chest skin for example ) and time investment so you again kind of get locked down into one character . 
  ** any other comments i may have forgotten about ? 
  i did n't join with this wave . 
  i joined with the last months 75 % off deal . 
  edit : apparently you can hide the personal story bit , great !, 
  thanks for informing me !, 
  i see nothing bad in a us base . 
  it 's stupid to willy-nilly around as such a small country in such a location as is the border of eu , russia . 
  either be western minded or russian minded . 
  we already know that being neutral only put a `` easy target '' sign on us in the last world war that affected us until the 1995 or so in terms of having to build up our country . 
  so might as well `` walk the walk '' besides `` talking the talk '' . 
  russia stronghanding us by telling how to run our country ? 
  well , lets fight them back with their own tools by allowing us close to their borders , so making similar hard decisions . 
  besides we are already in most of the unions , an allied base with us troops more or less drops the old troops on ground argument . 
  if someone tries a ukraine scenario they will have to do it through us troops . 
  so the news articles will be reporting of `` us troops '' amid the conflict instead of a far far `` estonian defense forces '' only skirmishes against unknown partisans . 
  inb4 us is doing cia stuff and will cause more harm . 
  as for our own air force , in the more economically stronger future , possible but there is n't a lot of reason to buy our own jets if other allied nations are capable of providing us with patrol squads . 
  why fix what is n't broken ? 
  ordi is so-so . 
  in general they are a good company but the cheaper variant you go for the less you will be getting . 
  most seem to have a 2 year guarantee period so at least you can probably return it . 
  i would recommend shops that sell more common models just because you can search google for reviews . 
  usually all companies have less quality models . 
  probably only apple ( as they sell a low variety ) can keep a steady impression of quality . 
  http://www.hinnavaatlus.ee/ is a great local site that lists quite a lot of companies small and big and you can narrow your search down to whatever you want . 
  only problem it seems to be estonian only ( or i am totally not seeing the language option ) . 
  as people said v\u00f6\u00f6t is another word for `` triip '' or stripe . 
  orav is squirrel . 
  so stripe + squirrel . 
  the problem probably is that v\u00f6\u00f6t is an unpopular word to use and people prefer `` triibud '' or `` triip '' instead of `` v\u00f6\u00f6diline '' `` v\u00f6\u00f6t '' . 
  so it might confuse people what v\u00f6\u00f6t means . 
  yeah i remember also when morrowind emerged . 
  the graphics where more or less the same effect that oblivion or skyrim gave you/us . 
  you were simply amazed how such detail could be put into the world . 
  so `` good graphics '' is a perfectly fine expression . 
  if you compare morrowind at the time and skyrim at its release they both had the `` great graphics '' feature . 
  if you compare morrowind and skyrim graphics in current times obviously skyrim has 9 years of progress ahead of mw . 
  same way a game from 1993 or 9 years before morrowind , could still be a 8bit sidescroller ( actually 6 years before morrowind , [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/daggerfall_promo_screenshot.jpg ) was the last game from the elder scrolls series the world had seen ), 
  still morrowind modders that are keeping the game up to date are showing just how good of an engine ( and how good modders ) are . 
  just glare at these :,
