  evil genius was the closest . 
  nice to see it finally as a remake . 
  show those pesky ... ewww ... huumans . 
  i have no primary language . 
  every language is secondary for me . 
  utterly provocative undertones indeed . 
  accusing russia of annexing crimea when they are `` contempt with current russian borders '' . 
  this is one of our `` chav '' culture trademarks . 
  also smokers do this now and again . 
  same guys who throw cigar buts on the streets even if there is a trashcan 5 meters away from you . 
  i do n't know if its a racist thing , probably not . 
  we do n't really have any `` racist things '' per say as we have n't had any sizable minorities of non-whites to irk those types of prerogative folk . 
  so no secret anti-white sings have developed and hopefully will not . 
  as someone who does n't litter or spit on the street it irks me also when people do this . 
  it is commonly viewed as a uncultured act , something a well behaved person would n't do . 
  i am fairly sure it is n't a secret racist thing though . 
  sorry for your loss !, 
  some generally `` sadder '' songs that i managed to find :, 
  - [ defoliated words ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yboyv9de-q ), 
  - [ children of the sea ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afo8ewnmqlc ), 
  - [ estonian i am and estonian i will remain ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hshkpxrn-dy ), 
  - [ on a windless night ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7pujsimig ), 
  - [ old mans song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjpptyolmhe ), 
  - [ peace ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64nd59jteoi ), 
  - [ he who flies towards the beehive ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fkilnexxza ), 
  i do n't think there is a specific song that is played at funerals , maybe someone else knows . 
  then again i have only been to one funeral so far , thankfully . 
  the songs i listed are simply something most estonians know off . 
  some are newer though like `` on a windless night '' . 
  they are n't nazis . 
  learn the meaning of a neo-nazi . 
  heck actually even during ww2 there were slavs or russians who fought on the side of germany but that is another topic . 
  point being , him being russian does not mean he ca n't be a neo-nazi . 
  they simply take ideas over from hitler or nazis in general . 
  they apply them from their view point , nationality side . 
  usually its the idea of a strong nation , they blame minorities , outsiders or whoever . 
  they like the idea of their bloodline and population , in this case probably russians , being the ones dominating their own country without letting any globalization in . 
  so it is n't some germany vs russia thing from ww2 for them . 
  these ideas represent a whole other facet to them . 
  hence neo-nazi . 
  plenty of documentaries done to show who some of these guys are . 
  they are n't exactly hiding in woods eithers . 
  as for reusing nazi era signs and symbols learn again what these actually represent besides `` nazi ! '' . 
  each of these had an idea of its own . 
  mostly the `` third reich '' idea of continuing a empire but for example if the eagle looked at the right or left , it meant different things . 
  wikipedia this shiat . 
  his tattoo seems to look at the right side so it represents `` nation '' . 
  no one said that the `` nation '' has to be germany . 
  `` stop uniting against us guys !, 
  if it comes to a war we ca n't as likely win . 
  we need you guys divided so it evens the field ! '', 
  always found [ dag\u00f6 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tck0dpdtyho ) to be amazingly special and weirdly estonian . 
  also obviously our nationally embedded and songs worn into our culture like whatever [ olav ehala touches ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxsrvnhlrw&amp;list=wl&amp;index=386 ) . 
  well that could be a solution to some of the smaller claims . 
  i do n't think a nato base is based around one nationality anyway . 
  just because it is a nato base russia can see it as some us staging ground for a possible attack whatever nationality occupies most of the base . 
  simply give us one nato base that we can actually make practical use off . 
  something to do with air patrolling or surveillance and we will be fine . 
  enough boots on ground to give another reason not to organize a `` green men 2 '' . 
  because it would n't solve the problem of estonia 's own defense needs . 
  number one being a better guarantee for nato to come help when the time calls . 
  russia , while the chance is low , will be more willing to organize stuff with just local estonians defending it . 
  a local conflict/disturbance . 
  if there is a chance that other nations military is affected the conflict immediately takes an international tone . 
  another threat got me interested . 
  my own story is when it was very cold . 
  basically had summer clothes as i came from a trip and had a long walk to another airport . 
  my bladder was about to give up and due to the cold i could n't really hold it in anymore , so i rushed to a nearby single yet large tree on a hill . 
  little did i know about 4 horse riders came like 5 meters from me so i had to literally move with them while i was peeing to hide my shame . 
  this turned into an ellaborate dance of having to count for the length of the column of horses , my own speed not to distrupt the peeline , awkward half pantsed walk and the speed of the horse riders , while cyircling around the tree . 
  another story is how my friend was drunk and decided to pee in a quiet corner . 
  i was a little further away but immediately saw where he had gone wrong . 
  about 30 meters behind him , facing that corner was a police van . 
  obviously the officers did the most trollish thing possible , waited until the `` crime '' was in action and turned their bloody light on so everyone in the vicinity focused on what the police was shining at . 
  obviously it was the funniest thing for me and a fine for my buddy once he finished . 
  disclaimer : i do n't advocate for peeing in public in any way , ok a forest area away from huge populations is fine . 
  its just that . . stuff happens when in dire need . 
  i think human psychology is something that would be interesting to hone . 
  human interaction , tell signs etc. 
  basically becoming the equivalent of a real life mr.monk or sherlock or poirot , or miss marple . 
  some uber guy who notices details and can read people like open books . 
  picked up a strange `` russianish '' accent but since you explained you were from ukraine and now in canada it makes perfect sense . 
  you speak quite well . 
  no words were lost due to not understanding , even i slur more estonian words normally speaking . 
  i made my own native recording :, 
  where i try to pronounce as clearly as possible :, 
  and a version how i speak normally without emphasizing pronouncement :, 
  edit : actually now that i listened them to side by side i noticed you pronounce some letters too specifically . 
  `` k\u00f5igepealt l\u00e4heme s\u00f6\u00f6ma '' you kind of say `` l\u00e4h-he-me '' , you kind of `` get stuck '' on the h saying it almost twice when usually you should `` get lazy '' and simply say `` l\u00e4-he-me '' . 
  similar is the `` pool tundi '' , you almost say like `` po-ll '' emphasizing the letter `` l '' when in fact it should be `` poo-l '' . 
  i mean i 'm nit picking on the harshest level of course . 
  do n't get mad at me . 
  without those i would n't be able to tell you from a native speaker . 
  i mean if you really only started learning and we have spoken it since birth you are obviously learning it amazingly . 
  if you came to estonian i would think your accent would be near gone once you hear locals speak and you adapt your own speech ( as usually happens when people live in the native languages environment ) . 
  so you have a really strong base already in terms of pronouncing . 
  by your own logic why a english accent ? 
  estonian is n't slavic nor part of the english language tree ... 
  no accent would be the ultimate way to speak any language . 
  what if she did n't see the sign ?
