  funny by their own stupidity/quirks or funny for being smart and able to make jokes ? 
  an actually good comedian would be recently deceased tarmo leinatamm who was in the parliament . 
  also well known conductor and part of a legendary comedian trio . 
  ( example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kpwj2v1sco ), 
  others : savisaar , ansip , r\u00fc\u00fctel , juku-kalle raid , indrek tarand , used to be funny peeter v\u00f5sa and others . 
  check out our tourism video :, 
  less genuine ? 
  more scripted ? 
  well obviously the content is n't scripted as the yogs while recording do n't have any scripts , maybe a very rough `` lets do this and that '' , 99 % add lib . 
  editors kind of spice up the video by adding an extra source for jokes . 
  making things multi faceted . 
  they make mediocre parts more noteworthy . 
  i do n't think we are missing out on anything because most of the edits come at spots where the actual jokes are n't that ... good , usual phuns to build up the good atmosphere . 
  why have subtle edits when you can have both silly edits + subtle pro editing off cuts and transitions ? 
  perhaps this is because i always liked how sips himself went for the `` ironic win95 low quality '' editing jokes and how this trend has crossed over to other channels . 
  hitler wanted to conquer more than he had . 
  that sure as hell did n't work out . 
  just because `` hitler planned it '' does n't mean it would of went so . 
  by the end of ww2 hitler used `` inferior races '' in his armies even as elite ss units that hitler of 1939 would of jailed hitler of 1944 for . 
  the point remains `` planned '' . 
  who would say some other factor unseen would of made it impossible for hitler to carry out those orders ? 
  just as hitler was totally stunned by ussrs ability to produce and carry on a war hitler might of not seen something else that would inhibit his plan from coming true . 
  do you think only 1 thing in the total universe , was ussr , that could throw hitlers plans off track ? 
  what if us had developed the nuclear bomb and instead of japan would of dropped it on berlin ? 
  would you think hitlers plans would go 100 % as he wants then ? 
  you are making it seems like world history would of been just as hitler wanted it if it was n't for ussr . 
  hitler also wanted to win the air war above uk that caused serious bomber losses to germany . 
  hitler also lost a lot of their navy to the allied forces as their wolfpacks got hunted down , he sure as hell did n't plan these losses . 
  well pardon the semantics . 
  my idea was that hitler wanted to conquer more than he had - his plans did n't work out in the end . 
  fixed the op to be worded more accurately . 
  i love how pc game shots can be ( nsfw ) like it kind of shows how far we have come . 
  / retardshowerthought, 
  every account on reddit is a bot except you . 
  i love how in this picture you can literally see ` dust prints ' of an impact around some craters . 
  like if you took some flour , mushed it together with some water and threw at a wall . 
  you could see the round pattern of the impact as the dust burst out . 
  agreed , i was with steam from day 1 also when i registered my hard copies to this `` new won online networking program '' . 
  i never experienced anything bad from steam ( other than it being an extra thing you have to always run in the background ) but that is for granted to this day . 
  it crashed on me a couple of times at an early release but nothing over the top , maybe 1-2 a month is what i would remember . 
  other than that it worked , worked like won worked before it . 
  as people said 7 years this early matters . 
  as we grow older the age differences slowly fades as people are all more or less mature in their decisions . 
  people are happily married with a 10 year age gap . 
  i would even think at 21 and 28 it could be seen as somewhat `` strange but working '' if it works . 
  there are different `` rules '' that people nicely make up . 
  the age/2 +7 was mentioned . 
  another one i heard is - +5 years from your age is the maximum . 
  it 's [ ` wave your flag ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyltk0fgjpc ) with different lyrics . 
  hey football never hurt anyone, 
  ^ edit : ^ that ^ is ^ a ^ dirty ^ lie , ^ football ^ is ^ a ^ contact ^ sport ^ and ^ if ^ it ^ was ^ competitive ^ you ^ bet ^ your ^ arse ^ that ^ you ^ got ^ bruises , ^ sprains ^ and ^ other ^ aches ^ after ^ coming ^ off ^ the ^ field . 
  i find it funny how violence is condoned by christians when bible is full of these awesomely gruesome deaths . 
  might not be as visual but as we have seen from movies depicting biblical stories it is n't all games and flowers now is it . 
  i 'm glad someone actually knows him . 
  a great personality . 
  well the attention you would get would n't be that dangerous than the guy who already knows that there is in fact a federal agent and would use google to scout the house . 
  i mean you check google and see a blurred house in the neighborhood and might get curios but the guys who might use google to scout the property are the ones you should be worried about . 
  holy eff '' salvadoran air force , using passenger airplanes with explosives strapped to their sides as bombers , attacked targets inside honduras . '', 
  i remember my best friends dad used to use dos even when windows 95 became popular , because it was faster for him to type commands in . 
  well besides it being a `` default '' booking , i would guess it would either be a new series or fallout 4 . 
  no way they would release a new single player elder scrolls just after their mmorpg . 
  this was ... everything i ever wanted . 
  the music , the amazing stunts , the tension !, 
  three guys , one world , one goal - they were born to do stunts and by god , they will do stunts !, 
  also probably because rome is among common saying like `` all roads lead to rome '' and `` rome was n't built in a day '' so its simply a common city name you use in slogans/sayings . 
  oh come on guys . 
  we at least get to see more ` fun ' footage from the separatist side . 
  i love how they basically went to square one in naming their tanks . 
  like they reached the top with t - ( 19 ) 90 and now that the millennia is long past started from the beginning with t - ( 20 ) 14 . 
  you would be surprised how `` ww1/ww2 '' our warmaking still is in some areas . 
  even us with their multi billion warbudget use sandbags to enforce their checkpoints or living areas out in the open or dig simple foxholes . 
  one major `` problem '' is resources , it would be stupid to start shipping defenses when wood/sand / ` soft ground ' is nearby . 
  also blowing up bridges , digging very steep holes or making hedgehog or other types of defensive obstacles is still very in . 
  a tank is still a tank and has to get past these things . 
  same for barbed wire and booby traps to slow down infantry . 
  the goal of the game for the defensive side is still the same . 
  ww2 had also a lot of trenches . 
  we all associate ww1 with trenches because 90 % of the time nothing else went on besides sitting in trenches and lobbing bombs . 
  no amazing air battles , no real sea battles , no massive amounts of tanks to support taking trenches . 
  so ww2 just `` saturated '' the pictures scene with more city battles and troop movement . 
  they still had more or less a trench at every defensive position when suitable and if they had at least a free day to dig . 
  the fact that `` no mans lands '' of thousands of craters existed in ww1 , only shows how effective trenches really are . 
  you can literally bomb the living shit out of people and most of the line will still hold up . 
  even during ww2 some trenches were so efficient or well hidden that instead of attacking , opposing sides literally dug trenches into other trenches or tunnels as no one really wanted to charge a trench head on . 
  `` girls do n't like a cheapskate '' ... 
  you are the one making cringe worthy material . 
  firstly no one likes being economically underhanded . 
  we would all like to be rich to some point . 
  you thinking every girl , even someone who you only have met with texts , is somehow entitled to a 30 $ just for ticket first date is odd . 
  your idea of a `` perfect relationship '' seems to be to live above your economical level , take loans , `` not be a cheapskate '' and fake it until it ends in ruins ? 
  or life off the guys wage ? 
  where is [ england ] ( http://static.tumblr.com/ab9b2b06f9c56811940ec35475bca78a/whnwjik/1romj5ql5/tumblr_static___sticker_375x360.png ) ? 
  i also heard that germany is about to release king tiger ii and ratte tanks and hugo boss is about to make new army clothes for the soon to emerge european army . 
  yes we get it , there are ukranian neo-nazis and nationalists in some of the army branches ( nationalists are probably the first people to feel patriotic and fight for the country ) . 
  some russians seem to think that the only way a neo-nazi operates is a 100 % copy of a ww2 ss officer . 
  resurrect hitler , restart the ovens , study mein kampf by heart and i do n't know what else . 
  neo-nazis are n't nazis , they use some of the ideas of nazis . 
  same way we can have neo-nazis in russia ( or other countries ) . 
  they are n't freaking copying ww2 nazi germany . 
  jesus , i find this idea so idiotic but seeing how russian media is portraying the ukraine war as a war against nazi v2 .0 i ca n't really blame them for buying into this .
