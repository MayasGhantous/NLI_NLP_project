  he is known for the most god awful overplaying scenes on earth . 
  the movies themselves are acceptable though . 
  sandler was brilliant at first , the second time around , third ... then everyone caught on . 
  his comedy got stuck in somewhere between 1998-2004 . 
  i have not seen the cobbler nor pixels but a lot of the recent movies are worse than the latter scary movies . 
  he does n't really care that he is making these almost b flick movies . 
  he still gets enough cash from them . 
  most of the quotes are from his glory and early days of waterboy , billy madison etc. 
  the `` hate '' is in no way sudden , it developed over years seeing him ride off his old reputation . 
  but the first movies was actually good and acclaimed even by critics . 
  i think there was only two of them and the second one botched . 
  eddie has n't milked money with his skills totally . 
  for example i remember him mostly by the voice of the donkey in `` recent '' years and shrek was quite a brilliant movie , eddie helped a lot with the sidekick role , if even by voice . 
  he has n't actually done that much recently . 
  certain hard logics have to be there . 
  we still act and learn a gaming universe/world/logic by starting with our pre-knowledge of our own worlds natural laws . 
  basics like eyes see , guns fire , feet walk , jumping temporarily sends you into air , how common objects look , how water `` works '' etc etc. 
  we take a lot from our real world and that kind of helps us orientate in the game . 
  now if the game is bad at introducing new concepts or elements we will rely on `` real life logic '' and get ` angry ' that they implemented something so outside the box we would of not got it . 
  so for example we can perfectly guess before having played lets say counter strike , that how fast we can run to some place and that by pressing jump we can get on that ledge . 
  what is near `` gaming logic '' is ideas like crouch jump , this concept is something you have to know , not based on real life ( well technically parkour/high jump etc also clear their legs ) but still no one `` crouches '' while jumping . 
  also stuff like elder scrolls games having a hard set limit of overburdened is something of a `` gaming logic '' that only makes sense as a gaming mechanic and you have to learn by either playing or knowing of it . 
  so in conclusion i hate both sides of this argument on some days , well the individual arguers . 
  we do take real life logic to games as its easier for us to grasp common concepts . 
  but this does n't mean that games have to be ultra realistic without breaking any rules at all . 
  else every game allowing , to take and simply move along at the same tempo , with bullet wounds is kind of unrealistic in the way it is delivered . 
  i understand the reasoning but i would of wished for a middle ground . 
  while they are quite new and `` weird '' in old town i kind of liked them , they added a nice friendly transport way . 
  what did need regulation would of been the number of them in the old town region ( easier said than done ) and some kind of pass to allow drivers on the streets . 
  with more time the more of these taxies on the street . 
  i liked the earlier days when i maybe saw like 1-5 while walking down the main streets . 
  uhh ... dude , you know something about books ? 
  books can have anything in them . 
  fantasy does n't have to be 100 % outwordly . 
  it can be based on reality or even a continuation of real events . 
  in this situation as the writer is polish and the games art and architecture mimics polish ( and general slavic ) middle age life ( villages , painted wooden houses etc ) then it is a perfectly clever idea . 
  the game does take place and uses polish culture and somewhat of a setting for its fantasy universe . 
  same way got uses english middle age history to draw inspiration . 
  best [ intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpclhana4-e ) ever, 
  `` that 's a bold move cotton , lets see if it pays off '', 
  i ca n't wait for `` an american tourist in iraq managed to beat a platoon of isis fighters relying on americas army training knowledge '', 
  half life 1 came out in the age where doom , quake , unreal tournament ruled . 
  story driven fps was something of a revolution and it pushed other developers to match their products . 
  half life 2 while not being as heavy of an impact on the market compared to the release of hl1 , did solidify a couple of things . 
  firstly the source engine , besides graphics it made an unnecessarily accurate physics engine that again other companies had to match in their games . 
  secondly , already granted , they made the game very mod friendly so some bought hl2 just to enjoy the soon to be imported modding scene ( along with the official `` mods '' that came with hl2 like cs : s and dod : s ) . 
  while the story was good in hl2 it was already something of expected from modern aaa fps titles . 
  ( with cod and halo already being a thing ) also with titles like doom 3 , great graphics was n't either something that odd in 2004 . 
  ( hl2 or source did go for texture sizes and crisp graphics while doom 's engine focused on lighting , mapping etc ), 
  a new classic besides the `` mu inimesed '' by chalice would probably be [ tuulevaiksel \u00f6\u00f6l ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s7pujsimig ) . 
  also no one mentioned [ ta lendab mesipuu poole ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikqno18zvc ) , i really really love the arrangement of this song and the buildup , old way to `` drop the bass '' . 
  also google/youtube the name `` olav ehala '' , his basically our ` poor mans ' mozart . 
  some samples : [ p\u00e4ikeseratas ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzczg0r-4ra ) , [ valulaul ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxsrvnhlrw ) , [ h\u00f5beniit ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxqs-otftxy ), 
   is music still a large part of your culture or has this faded since you won your independence ? 
  it 's not as big of a part as it was , in terms of mobilizing and gathering crowds and kickstarting the re-independence, 
  movement . 
  it still is important enough as kids get thought that `` we sang ourselves to freedom '' and our perhaps most important tradition is the song festival ( night and regular ) that can gather like 30 % of the country under one dome . 
  so i would say the kids are brought up with these patriotic songs in mind and such music is perhaps a connecting piece still . 
   what is the state of patriotic music like today ? 
  its mostly the old `` 1991 's '' songs that get remade with more modern backdrops or re-sang . 
  a lot of the artists of our singing revolution are still alive and kicking so they are still actively giving shows , appearing on tv etc etc. 
  we might get new patriotic pieces that hit it off with the people like every couple of years . 
  as was chalice minu inimesed . 
   is much music still produced in estonian or like the rest of europe has it gone to all english music on the radio ? 
  thanks !, 
  depends on the station . 
  most of it is world top but estonian artists are known and have their niche . 
  less modern `` house , dance , mix '' music and more focused on lyrics as they obviously ca n't compete with world top names or production value , remixes etc. 
  we do have plenty of artists that everyone knows , genka , tanel padar , sal saller , getter jaani , eda ines , maarja liis , koit toome etc etc etc , plenty of household names that still produce quality music that can be considered `` estonian pop '' . 
  actually the well known show format of searching for a countries singing `` idol/superstar '' has helped us get plenty of artists that make it in estonia , from the already named getter jaani to birgit \u00d5igemeel , karl taukar or liis lemsalu . 
  i do n't think they are fearing aggression . 
  rather than rethinking their position due to the current geopolitics . 
  like `` hey , this power play is happening near the arctic , ukraine and other places . 
  might it be reasonable to further align with west to take part in this game of chess ? '', 
  no its a peoples thing , people are pricks , knobs , bellends and mighty fine aholes sometimes . 
  also we got over ussr , its called something like 're - independence ' . 
  in honesty this is quite obviously a trolling/lols attempt , half assed or not . 
  : ) lets keep ansips message of '' \u00c4rge alluge provotsioonidele '' in mind . 
  some must be really good at it , i have seen really fat people around . 
  you extract it from western spies poisoned by russia ? 
  well if you look it up it actually is n't plutonium nor polonium . 
  its putonium . 
  i hate roundabouts , i find traffic lights relaxing . 
  you have a clear freaking red for stop and green for go , you can regulate the flow by keeping green lit more for one way and less for the other . 
  roundabouts again you have this constant ache at the back of your head of `` can i make it between them ? '', 
  `` is that guy going to turn away or is he going to go for another round ? '', 
  etc etc. 
  you also need to be constantly ready to go , even if you are going to wait like 1 minute , `` oh ready up . . nope nope cars ... oooh ok speeding up . . noo nope nope , other way came . . oooh oohh may . . nope nope '' . 
  also its like a freaking circus act of trying to bend your head backward while driving forward on the roundabout while at the same time keeping an eye for signs that might or might not be there . 
  jesus , just thinking about roundabouts makes me mad . 
  a straight road crossing with red/green is a lot more stress free than a constant swirl and trying to bend your head in 4 directions to keep your car in the lane , watch for possible traffic and check for signs that are sometimes hidden behind brushes . 
  then we have roundabouts that have like 4 lanes on them , do n't get me started on those , freaking who in the hell thought up those things ?!, 
  also if there is a constant flow of cars in some directions , good luck getting onto the roundabout at all . 
  you will die of old age before someone gives you a mercy yield . 
  i do but you ca n't be 100 % sure that someone had forgot to put their blinker on . 
  even if you have the right you have to check if the other guy noticed you coming in from the round . 
  gg no re, 
  i have a 4 year old laptop ( replaced now but it still use it when i need 2 laptops ) . 
  i started experiencing heating problems with it also . 
  my friends old laptop did the same so i would be 99 % certain its the most common problem of too much dust/long gone thermopaste/clogged up active vents .
