  now if they only could get to see ain lutsepp and aarne \u00dcksk\u00fcla i would be happy . 
  those voices would be up there with morgan freeman . 
  offensive is the best kind of funny . 
  everyone looks , stands and no one manages to divide who covers who . 
  i hope our summer will now be 40 degrees . 
  thats how global warming works right ? 
  next year we should push christmas to january when we will have snow . 
  well not only postimees . 
  other `` media '' outlets like delfi do it daily with all kinds of viral videos . 
  i am sure opinion written pieces have done reports on news funnel sites as is reddit in most publications . 
  easy and actually interesting content as it gets voted up . 
  well if he does then he is putting it back in the economy so ... :p, 
  `` no animals were harmed making this movie '', 
  in estonian we just say `` head aega '' / `` good times '' . 
  we also use `` n\u00e4gemist '' / `` see you again '' . 
  i think we are n't the most creative people , like vulcans . 
  actually even that is a lie , we even dissed our own sayings and mostly use the cooler italian `` ciao '' or even russian `` davai '' . 
  my maths teacher used to shout `` halllooo ?!?! '', 
  when he wanted to get someones attention . 
  it always felt like she was answering the phone in the most angry way possible . 
  i seriously feel like the world became a better place today . 
  a movie that was made like what , 20 years ago ? 
  suddenly 2 of the main characters make a homage playing off each other and the movie . 
  20 years later !, 
  and they do it with this layed off charm , not some top notch production to hone in on the money . 
  kind of broke the 4th wall of a `` big industry '' for me if ` former ' ( no offence ) aaa list actors are chipping in on amateur videos and with their own yt channels . 
  lots of happiness and, 
  health for your birthday ,, 
  from [ a name ], 
  oooh : d, 
  well make sure not to leave your xxl butplugs and dogmasks in plain sight when they come to visit . 
  as a pc gamer will i be able to view the movie in the cinema ? 
  important !, 
  uhh actually the easiest answer is that wikipedia is a secondary source linking to primary sources . 
  so the information is 99 % of the time correct and actually most up to date but it in itself is citated from other sources so why not link to the primary source ( s ) in the first place . 
  your estonian is like 95 % perfect but there are some words with a hint of accent . 
  the biggest thing is a kind of a russian native speakers soft `` j '' sound in some words instead of our `` i '' sound . 
  very slight but as its such an easy thing to notice you do notice it . 
  i heard it in `` inimesed '' - injimesed and `` s\u00fcnnivad '' - s\u00fcnjivad . 
  then the word `` v\u00e4\u00e4rikuselt '' was slightly off , also a hint of `` j '' and you kind of pronounced the long '' \u00e4\u00e4 '' as a one vowel '' \u00e4 '' sound , you needed to stay on that \u00e4 sound a little longer . 
  but again this is nitpicking ( hey you asked for it : ) ) , 95 % sounded on point . 
  kind of a known trick to fake being crippled . 
  my personal favorite in terms of creativity was the flower scam of putting a flower in your hand and then asking for a donation . 
  also ca n't forget the classical `` i am just short of a bus ticket/food money '' or whatever location is near to be short on something . 
  once a person in our group gave such a person money and for extra akwardness waited outside to see if he really was buying food , well he came out empty handed looking at us suprised . 
  i like it how its `` normal '' as it has happened before . 
  like some test . 
  oh hotel exterior on fire ? 
  pfff , move along , just testing the sprinklers . 
  miski 2-3 laulu on playlisti v\u00e4\u00e4rilised endaarust . 
  eastern europe , tornades ? 
  i have lived in eastern europe and i have never seen or heard of a tornado here , and i am not talking about myself but even by news . 
  literally they do n't happen here . 
  the only tornades i have seen are from movies usually taking place in north america . 
  edit : to confirm this i googled my countries last tornado attack and apparently the worst tornado happened in the year 2000 when a guy got hit with a flying plank and died . 
  caffeine is not bad per say , in moderation caffeine is perfectly fine . 
  poolakas, 
  well , you reap what you sew . 
  in lame man 's terms i guess i made a mistake, 
  he should take that 100 $ and buy a 10 inch dildo just for fun and donate it or something . 
  her last name is named after will.i.am, 
  there is a term for that actually . 
  when items in a category take the name of the entire category . 
  similar reasoning with `` the moon '' and `` the sun '' . 
  people find it easier to refer to similar items even if it is n't technically the name of the item . 
  ahh the good old days then in pre-teens i remember the age of `` lets play for 3 hours until kazaa dl 's something '' and the obligatory `` lets play something else for an hour until it burns it on the disc '' . 
  get off your high and mighty horse . 
  its a book , not like the bible . 
  even the communists had their own communist manifesto book by marks . 
  you do n't have to be a nazi , yankee or commie to read any of the sides books or `` enjoy '' ww2 history . 
  we have had neo nazis and i am sure access to the book before this . 
  it might , just might have a slight surge at first of his ideas being brought up for discussion ( with like any kind of ban lift ) but it will settle down and we wo n't even notice this . 
  it takes a little more than a multi hundred page book to radicalize people . 
  hitler himself more or less struggled half his life to gain power and the trust of people . 
  never mind brazil ... look at sweden ( and poland , germany ) : x, 
  this is my love hate relationship with football , in order to be good at it you actually need to do the minimal number of touches , and every touch counts . 
  oh god , i remember it was a sucker punch kind of situation for me . 
  i had no idea what green mile was ( had n't heard of the book either ) and simply stumbled upon it while watching tv . 
  i freaking cried like a babbi at the end . 
  estonians use \u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4 ... \u00e4mmm ... mmmm ... aaaaa ... and yes sometimes \u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6 too, 
  if you are more advanced you go for the \u00e4\u00f6\u00f6\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u00e4\u00f6\u00f6, 
  what ? 
  you serously got it backward . 
  the `` rail shooter '' of fallouts was fo3 as it constricted you to certain paths with more or less clever way of using metros to block access or zones . 
  nv was made by , more or less , the same people who made f1 & 2 . 
  it also fixed a lot of the gripes of f3 . 
  one major one was a lack of branching story and a more diverse way to solve quests . 
  another one was exactly the `` world levels with you '' deal . 
  it 's the easy way out design for developers to make everything scale . 
  do n't get me wrong f3 was a great game with good atmosphere but it was not f1 & 2 kind of opportunistic world . 
  also f3 was lacking in an important part of fallout universe , that is the grim dark humor . 
  it had some but nv brought in more . 
  nv allowed you ( and the devs ) to have more fun as did the originals . 
  also i would argue the boring world ( in terms of looks ) was in f3 where it was either dusty remains , metro or cityscape - ` oblivion ' landscaping in future where you also had heaps of rehashed areas . 
  nv brought back some nature and colour to different areas . 
  most of the needed skills/knowledge you will pick up as you go ( half the fun of a new place is to experience it ) . 
  i do n't think there is anything you absolutely need to learn actually , fairly similar bubbled society to sweden/latvia , with a hint of more openess with every generation . 
  talking from experience after having lived for a short while in an asian country so i do n't think there will be much culture shock . 
  stay calm and carry on . 
  just as any population our range extends from assholes to awesome people .
