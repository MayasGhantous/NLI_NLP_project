  each security organisation is a extra layer of protection , nato , eu , baltic etc etc. 
  this `` international troops '' is just that . 
  a layer . 
  it is not only for direct conflict . 
  it is more of a political message , each time russian duma has to address situations on this topic they will have to write an extra paragraph of `` estonian troops with contingents of danish , united kingdoms , french troops '' . 
  they ca n't take use of this for `` divide and conquer '' . 
  also check up on your facts . 
  during ww2 or `` that event '' as you put it i am pretty sure they did have nukes . 
  i kind of recall some sort of event that helped take out one of the axis major powers . 
  so check your facts . 
  last time an eastern power and western power clashed there were nukes . 
  in fact that is the only time in history when a nuclear bomb has been used during war . 
  reminds me of deus ex ... 
  1 lets take a hypothetical situation . 
  lets say a russian convoy/agent got lost on the border and was caught in estonia . 
  or lets say some base blew up near st. petersburg or leaked a toxic cloud . 
  whatever it might be it would n't be a `` local '' event with russia and the baltics . 
  it might include some international troops dealing with such situations as they are stationed in estonia so it widens the `` local '' aspect into `` global '' . 
  this was the idea behind my `` has to write extra nations on the list '' example in the post before . 
  it simply is a thorn on russian side . 
  and no i do n't think they discuss such stuff but they can take use of the situation of a weak estonia ( or anybody ) to influence other categories , be it local russian population , economics or some other stuff . 
  russia plays politics with every category possible . 
  if they can reference a `` lonely estonia '' in terms of military defense it only helps with their view of the world . 
  russian authorities are like authorities in any other country , 99 % of the issues are their local ones . 
  also russian people are like people everywhere , most deal with pay , rent , food , family , entertainment . 
  if i do say myself i do believe i am quite grounded on issues and my world view . 
  you yourself are proposing strange scenarios , i do n't know how you would get that i would think `` russians were plotting in a dark castle '' . 
  2 i was simply trying to push you into the corner as i find it funny you brought up east vs west , nukes and said none were involved - that is it . 
  i mean japan was quite an important player during ww2 , occupied china , kept some soviet forces busy patrolling the border , brought in us into the war . 
  i mean i totally get what you really meant but then again technically ww2 had every element that you mentioned in it . 
  t\u00f5 facist ! '', 
  to anyone who does not know this yearly show is a goldmine for laughs . 
  best years imho are with the goth detectives noel and russel . 
  surely it is , that is why this article got 0 support votes as of current time . 
  i wonder what is non subtle for you ? 
  a big red flashing sign of `` yogscast reference here be ! '', 
  i feel as this is a gamble for putin . 
  russian economy is already kind of slowly falling as of having to reorganize trade . 
  a war is rarely economically viable , then they have to support crimea . 
  if statistics are to believed russian gdp per capita has dropped to almost 2009 level . 
  a 36 % drop from 14,000 $ to 9,000 $ in 1 year . 
  actually what am i saying ? 
  go do battle in syria !, 
  the faster the conflict ends the quicker the refugee crisis calms . 
  uhh ... it is n't `` sly tony voice '' , its a larger category of `` simons godfather voice '' that also sly tony has . 
  pretty sure simon used that voice more times than sly tony and google duel . 
  it 's his go-to voice just like granny bacon , grizwald or brian blessed . 
  oh wow , very well played . 
  then again when you have 3 players with a common goal it should be easy enough to sway war to your favor . 
  i am amazed how fast they took germany and his allies over . 
  then again i am surprised how well the game was handed to them , like a double lottery win , first a civil war in france and then communist takeover . 
  like . . hnnnggg ... perfect timing porn . 
  the controlled chaos is perfect and how well everything locks into place as if they discovered an easy mode . 
  i actually feel like russia is kind of `` mild '' more western minded russians . 
  i mean why talk in english when russia has all popular sites copying foreign ones . 
  they have their own ` facebook ' , messengers etc. 
  so most people know english , `` consume '' english side of the internet and are probably more up to date with western views . 
  ok you put it into words but what i find frustrating is that the `` downtime '' that i need is quite a lot . 
  its not just walk twice a week for me . 
  i literally need like ~ 3h a day of internet time to get into my own `` zone '' and totally relax . 
  so the thing that soothes you after work , kind of needs a little time cut themselves . 
  `` one tiny country about to stand up to russia , wait until you read how they gathered an army of insurgents below ! '', 
  judging by -34 in your post ... no ... no it could not . 
  most get that the post is about `` wow pyrion and hamill had a convo on twitter '' not `` oooh drama '' . 
  now the only logical thing to do is invite mr.hamill to yogtower and officially apologize by making simon frantically cry infront of dear sir . 
  cuming in your eye !, 
  and of course the classic, 
  [ `` roooar ... rwaaaor ... rooooaor ... roooooawwwr '' ] ( https://youtu.be/wyrifvddwqm?t=57 ), 
  most retailers do n't really care either if such stuff happens . 
  you and others are just savvy gamers and know what a bundled or goty game is . 
  a store has thousands of products , they do n't go into details as what a certain digital product actually contains . 
  they lump every digital game together and look at the total profit margin . 
  if they make a loss at pricing products wrong they do n't care as fixing these mistakes would take more manhours and perhaps eat up on the profit itself . 
  so sometimes small mistakes are not cared about as long as the cash machine runs in general , they already take into account that pricing mistakes do happen ( this really is n't even a mistake , they probably are selling at a profit , who cares that it more or less has a `` duplicate + more '' product next to it ) . 
  besides in food products you get this also . 
  for example sometimes the price of the same line products 500g container is cheaper than 1kg container ( going by 1kg wholeprice ) so it 's cheaper to buy 2x500g than the 1kg single product . 
  how about folk rock , is that alt enough or too alt ? 
  well i post them everytime but i absolutely think dag\u00f6 is the best answer to a `` inner estonian sound '' . 
  the soothing voice of the vocalist and very different sound . 
  also lyrics are quite ... interesting to learn . 
  oh and very good estonian pronounciation by mr. saatpalu , afaik he has done voicework for tv channels as in `` coming up next '' etc. 
  - [ dag\u00f6 - tuuletallajad ( wind stompers ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpvk_yhsfms ),

  i think there is more kinship to finnish , so if finns are about 75 % nordic then i would put estonia at 50 % , the rest probably is about 16,6 % baltic , 16,6 % russian , 16,6 % german influence . 
  i do feel our society , culture and government are most suited for a `` nordic '' style of development . 
  just as chinese have a cultural language for business and their hidden rules i think estonian culture mostly understands finnish thinking , culture and business . 
  so it is easier to us to feel more at ease in finland as we `` get '' why people are melancholic , `` bubbled '' on the streets or sometimes `` rude '' or not smiling in the service sector as it is similar back home . 
  the huge influence imho is the internet culture and in more broad view still us dominance so that `` happy go smile '' archetype of building your name up as a product ( be ( artificially ) as handsome as you can , fake attitude , social media presence a must etc ) is more prevalent . 
  although as that is a general `` west '' and world trend then this mostly brings everyone together . 
  i do think we are quite unique as a society itself honestly . 
  our population is small enough that the entire country functions as a disfunctional family . 
  our most prevalent sayings say everything about us . 
  `` estonians favorite food is another estonian '' and `` everyone knows everyone '' . 
  so we kind of are already this ultra capitalist society where everyone works their ass off to achieve something while throwing ( softly ) others under the bus . 
  also the quest to find `` our nokia '' ( although now a bad thing ) is still going . 
  oh and jakob hurt always said it nicely that `` if we ca n't be big in numbers then we should become big in spirit '' is always another nicer way of summing up our society . 
  projects like `` e-residence for everyone '' and `` effective government '' stem from such speeches and brainstorms . 
  ironically the idea of `` getting ideas and implementing them as experiments '' eg . 
  startups has become a motto in itself .
