if you are a private person ( not a company ) and you buy from an other eu country ( germany in this case ) , then you do not need to pay any tax in estonia . 
  yes , in case of china you would need probably pay at least vat , which is 20 % . 
  if you are a private person , then a seller pays 19 % german vat automatically on your behalf - prices on amazon.de already include that . 
  if you are a business ( with vat number ) , then a seller does not pay vat in germany , instead you pay vat in estonia , which is 20 % . 
  why it is misleading ? 
  prices on amazon already include vat - so nothing will be added at checkout ( for private persons ) . 
  source : i buy on amazon.de both as a company and as a private person . 
   vat is not added to invoice , but there is no need to pay it in estonia . 
  in the link that you sent :, 
   buying, 
   if you buy and receive goods for business purposes from another eu country , you must account for the vat on the transaction as if you had sold the goods yourself , at the applicable rate in your country . 
  is n't it the same what i said in, 
   if you are a business ( with vat number ) , then a seller does not pay vat in germany , instead you pay vat in estonia , which is 20 % . 
   a country like russia , usa , china , anywhere in middle east , africa or south america, 
  something does not belong to this list . 
  i too used ethermine and left it because effective rate was constantly lower by 10-20 % and never above than the reported hashrate . 
  i am using dwarfpool now and it seems to be floating around + - 10 % , my reported hash rate is 940mh , right now dwarfpool displays it as 968mh effective . 
  i had the same with ethermine , then switched to an other pool and it works fine . 
  usa i guess ? 
  you do not need 80gb hdd for mining , i mine on a 16gb usb drive and it works just fine . 
  i know there is a `` welcoming programme '' ( completely free btw ) ( it includes a1 estonian language courses and some other basic courses about estonian society ) for immigrants that have resided for less than 5 years in estonia but since you are an estonian citizen i am not really sure if you are eligible for that . 
  you could read more about that there https://www.settleinestonia.ee/mod/page/view.php?id=123, 
  i personally run my rigs with `` asus prime h270-plus '' motherboard that supports 6 gpus . 
  my ram is 4gb and gpus are rx 470 4gb . 
  regarding the os on the usb drive , i was trying to mine with windows 10 first but it failed since it was taking literally hours to do something simple like adjust gpu memory clock on all gpus , switch from eth to zcash , etc. 
  so now i am running https://simplemining.net/ which is basically a custom ubuntu . 
  it supports overclocking and undervolting but i feel like it undervolts worse than it does on windows - a rig with 6 x rx 470 4gb makes about 168 mh in total and takes about 1000w ( wall ) , while on windwows it was taking about 900w . 
  i use claymore miner . 
   do n't intend to tear estonia apart . 
  unfortunately some people do , like putin for example ? 
  for example , russia supported the rioting during the `` bronze night '' . 
  also something has happened to crimea too , just as an example of the russian activity . 
   russians vote for keskerakond and almost exclusively for keskerakond . 
  it is the party of liars , thieves and russians . 
  could not agree more . 
  every keskerakond ad that i ever seen always had a russian language translation , it 's clear who are the keskerakond target audience . 
  username checks out . 
  it works perfectly with 6 gpu . 
  estonia stopped buying electricity from russia already long time ago . 
  it is unclear why our grid is still connected to russia . 
  btw , just yesterday [ russian hackers attacked estonian grid ] ( http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/after-three-baltic-countries-agree-to-disconnect-power-grids-from-russia-the-cyber-hackers-arrive ) . 
  such a lovely neighbor ~ ~ why ca n't it just disappear ~ ~ . 
  they are still used in some airports , for example in vienna . 
   one of the happiest days of my life was when i find out i could renounce my citizenship upon becoming 18 ; i made it my goal then to become an adult and be free of this shackles -- of this curse . 
  sorry to shatter your goal , but it is likely that you can not renounce your citizenship if you do not have an another . 
   it takes time , money , political will and negotiations to reorganize and build/engineer all that . 
  yes , we did have 25 years to do that . 
  why was it given a priority only after russia again started attacking it 's neighboring countries ? 
  great . 
  however in order to get a work visa to the country you want to immigrate to , you would need to have some very valuable skills that the local population does not . 
  even after you immigrated , you do not acquire citizenship immediately , it usually takes 5-10 years . 
  but what if you step on it ? 
  when you really do not want to give vodka to your bear, 
  when you live in florida and take your pet to work, 
  do you mean ukraine and georgia ? 
  [ rest of the europe already did ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/wide_area_synchronous_grid_%28eurasia%2c_mediterranean%29.png ), 
  this is a gas pipeline . 
  the op article is about electrical grid . 
  i agree however that whole eu needs to stop buying energy in any form from russia and other authoritarian countries . 
  edit : you edited your post and my post is out-of-context now :(, 
  taxes ^ ^ ^ / s, 
   ukraine, 
  i already referred it in my post . 
  belarus is basically a pro-russian puppet and moldova elected a heavily pro-russian president recently . 
  both have russian language as an official language ( however in moldova it is only `` a regional language '' ) . 
  they are simply irrelevant because no changes are expected there in the nearest decades . 
  north korea needs to be stopped . 
  they are just provoking nato , do they really think they would stand any chance ? 
  although nearest to north korea nato country is u.s. and it is maximum what they could `` attack '' , but hypothetically if north korea would attack germany or united kingdom or any other nato country , i can not see a reason why nato article 5 would not be invoked . 
  with countries like russia vetoing everything and saudi arabia in `` human rights council '' ? 
  nah , secret cia moon base is closer . 
  this is the best entry in this eurovision . 
  best eurovision entry ever 12/12, 
  honestly he was looking like he is having a seizure . 
  and his victory speech is simply insulting to other contestants . 
  erdogan : nazi europe confirmed, 
  you are the troll . 
  you called me `` a xenophobic eastern '' and claimed `` estonians never seen a brown person '' in that thread . 
  so yes , why nothing is being done about people like ** you ** ? 
  proof [ there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6b1kc7/europe_is_facing_an_unprecedented_rise_of/dhjfw6h/ ) , also [ saved webpage in case if you edit it ] ( http://peeep.us/208e9ada ), 
  edit : so you removed the post , so [ here is the copy you can not remove ] ( http://peeep.us/208e9ada ), 
  did not expect any less from / r/latestagecapitalism, 
  really ? 
  really ? 
  so you are just saying that i am a racist xenophobic person just because of my country ? 
  is not it the definition of racism ? 
  i do not know about statistics , but it is easy to see them not in city center . 
  if i am in city center , it gets even easier . 
  so am i lying , do you really think i never seen brown people in estonia ? 
   i think chances are you 're making shit up, 
  ok , think whatever you want . 
  thankfully reality wont bend to your delusion . 
   either way an estonian talking about real europe with regards to migration it 's ridiculous , yes . 
  so here is the ** real racism ** coming from ** you ** . 
  estonians are bad , syrians are good , right ? 
  ( hint : it is racism ), 
  btw , [ recently an refugee tried to burn his wife in estonia ] ( http://news.err.ee/316307/estonian-court-takes-into-custody-refugee-man-suspected-of-burning-wife ) . 
  but what , i though they do not exist here ? 
   only that an overwhelming majority of estonians will never met a migrant from africa . 
  if they live in a rural area probably .
