  i do not know what is your city . 
  what is your latitude ? 
  mine is 59 . 
  try this https://www.keeleklikk.ee/en/welcome, 
  have you already got your residence permit approved by the police/immigration board ( politsei - ja piirivalveamet ) ? 
  i heard that the annual quota is running out very quickly . 
  any kind of storage would work . 
  i use a usb drive and it works just fine . 
  if you are an estonian e-resident you still have to pay taxes on your personal income in your real home country . 
  if you setup a company in estonia then it could make some tax optimization for you . 
  it would be in this case 0 % tax for undistributed income and 20 % tax for distributed income . 
  you can also add https://www.eki.ee/en/dictionaries , an estonian dictionary ( including dialects ) made by the eesti keele instituut, 
  or you could just mine ethereum and then sell ethereum for signatum . 
  * electricity companies hate this trick *, 
   stealing company electricity ? 
  smart !, 
  i hope you meant stupid . 
  rma it . 
  you could buy a psu tester in order to find out whether the psu is supplying the right voltage . 
  however i have one failing psu ( cables are 100c hot ) and it still supplies the correct voltage . 
  so an infrared thermometer could help too , in order to find out if any cables are too hot and therefore melting ( i had 3 psus that had melted cables ) . 
  yes , i pay ~ 0.10 eur for kwh and it is still very worth it . 
   not web . 
  but cookies alone are not sufficient security . 
  would you prefer an authentication token as plaintext in the url ? 
  i just logged in to seb and you know what ? 
  it has set a cookie called `` sesky '' with the authentication token . 
  since it is not sufficient , could you tell me how i can hack it without infecting an end-user device ? 
   if the user is on public wifi you can copy the cookie when it is being sent , man in the middle attacks . 
  if you use https then it is impossible to intercept traffic ( well you can intercept but it will be encoded ) , that 's why it is called `` hyper text transfer protocol ** secure ** '' . 
  the eesti.ee website uses https . 
  you could try it yourself - open something like wireshark , and then try to open a http website and https on an other device * ( however you could also use the same device since the logic would not change ) * . 
  you will be able to see the http traffic as plaintext but https will be encoded . 
  elisa has unlimited mobile internet for 39 eur but i think it is post-paid . 
  i had the same issue with 3 rigs - it turned out to be a melting pci-e cable ( the part that is connecting to the psu itself ) . 
   i 'm wondering if someone has gone through the same path and what are common pitfalls and money sinks for small companies in estonia . 
  i am not sure whether it qualifies as a money sink , but if you are an `` e-resident '' and have no address in estonia you will be have to use someone 's else address as a legal/registration address . 
  also you would need an accountant , but if your company is small and/or you are willing to fill forms on the emta.ee ( taxboad ) website , you can do it yourself ( i think many of them are translated to english ) . 
  if there is no employees and no vat turnover , then you only have to fill an annual report once a year . 
   in my own country we pay around 200eur every month for social security even if we do n't have any profit or employees , is there something like this in estonia ? 
  if you have no profits and no employees you do not have to pay any tax . 
  that 's hardly a `` big surprise '', 
  it is not only in uk , there is a worldwide shortage of gpus, 
  it is absolutely real , it is uses the gov domain, 
  certainly there is less control than over fiat money . 
  you would be ok with that ( average wage is ~ 1100 eur ) . 
  i think rent in tallinn starts from ~ 300 eur . 
  there are cheap cruise ferries for like 90 eur ( two-ways ) between tallinn and stockholm . 
  one way ticket ( also on a ferry ) to finland costs about 30 eur . 
  most people speak english but if you intend to remain in estonia then you should learn estonian . 
  public transportation between cities and in tallinn is good in my opinion . 
  mobile internet is also very good ( i have like 70 mbps download / 20 mbps upload on my phone ) . 
  since we have e-government , you would not be have to go to government offices for bureaucratic stuff , all can be done using internet ( e.g. 
  like i said above , it eliminates the need of staying in queues for useless bureaucratic papers , etc. 
  retarded bot, 
  yes , they are also turning frogs gay . 
  so once ethereum goes pos , could miners mine these zksnarks transactions instead ? 
  you can not fully integrate into society without learning the local language . 
  it applies to every country . 
  communism, 
  a trader is not equal to a hodler, 
  `` state-capitalism '' is a commie 's favorite `` argument '' . 
  then it would not be the * real socialism * because real socialism ca n't fail . 
  because it 's javascript , that 's why . 
   worrying about `` where will i put my rigs '' ? 
  i simply store my rigs in a rented office space . 
  electricity price is also lower in that case . 
  i saw this ad on other non-crypto related subreddits too . 
  that 's a too hard question for a socialist . 
  i use english as os ui and as a local for all apps . 
  i even use american datetime format . 
  it feels more english that way so the ui immersion is not broken ( i mean only in phone/pc , not in everyday talking ), 
  what do you mean by `` registering id card '' ? 
  do you already have estonian id card ( [ it looks like this ] ( https://www.politsei.ee/dotasset/162964.jpg ) ) ? 
  yes , its possible . 
  every crypto market is a [ random walk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/random_walk_hypothesis ), 
  a life lesson learnt - never trust to the chinese government . 
  well i kinda believed that chinese gov could be backing neo or other chinese cryptos . 
  i checked / r/neo and there is more chinese shills right now than i could count . 
  yes but in reality that andromeda would be more like a dumpster , because there would be no icos in china . 
  its a shame they do not fix this bug because it ruins blockfolio charts . 
  they could probably make it to use a mean price within the past hour . 
  or ignore trades with very low volume . 
  my balance increased by 36 deltas, 
  thanks . 
  fucktoken is good too - it 's price increased 4-5x times since ico . 
  regarding the neo , i just sold it for eth . 
  it means they are fucked , as they said themselves * `` we decided to continue to allow ico participants to return bitcoins they invested '' * , in other words they will comply with the new chinese ruling . 
  how do you think how are they feeling if they refund money from their ico ? 
  yeah very good , just could not be better . 
  i did read your explanation and i still do not understand how is this making things any better ? 
  yes it seems hardly enforceable and it makes it only worse - means china will fine neo . 
  btw i am not a kid and definitely not offended , are you though ? 
  there is no `` deployed '' button on github, 
  a 20 days account is accusing someone of being a paid shill ... 
  my point is that i find it strange that there are many 20 days old account on this sub . 
  i think an exchange is better than a wallet that is just installed to your hardrive . 
  the best option is hardware wallet like trezor but it costs around 100 euro . 
  so you can not afford any real gpu like gtx 1080 and you are telling other to get a real job ?
