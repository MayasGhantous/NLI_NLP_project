  basically nothing . 
  just endless `` we do not have a date yet '' from the mods . 
  the only more or less update was from hando rand ( agrello project lead ) which basically said that withdrawals processing will continue tomorrow . 
   that 's fucked up if its that easy . 
  how could this threat be taken care of ? 
  you are immune to this hardware wallet . 
  blockfolio often has bugs like this . 
  not particularly with delta . 
  aneesh is redditor for 1 month , you are a redditor for 4 hours . 
  its all the same . 
  to be honest i think that you both are shills, 
  i have no idea who is anessh . 
  said the fucking 29 days old account . 
  are you kidding ? 
  90 % of all posters on this subreddit are 1-60 days old accounts . 
  it looks very weird compared to other subreddits . 
  \\  huffingtonpost.com, 
  seems legit, 
  another 2 hours old account, 
  blockfolio uses hitbtc price and hitbtc price is not real, 
  hitbtc is a scam , use etherdelta instead, 
  do you really think you are making agrello look better ? 
  you and other shills are only hurting it , you all are using the same wording in every sentence . 
  another 30 days old account . 
  are you all kidding ? 
  you are only hurting agrello by this shilling . 
  roads hate this *, 
  but who was building the roads there !, 
  only government can make roads , you wo n't fool me . 
  everyone i do not like is a ~ ~ nazi ~ ~ land-lord slave labor owner . 
  i have noticed there is also a lot shills , for example you . 
  hando said that they are working on it and can not disclose any information yet . 
  they claim that about $ 40m . 
  i use two 100w fans . 
  this guy just asks for it https://tips.fbi.gov/, 
  i think nvidia cards are better . 
  my gtx1070 rig has hash rate about 190mh/s and power consumption ~ 600w . 
  while rx470 rig has hash rate about 155mh/s and power consumption ~ 800w . 
  i have ~ 250 eur platinum psu ... 
  yes . 
  my simplemining config is :, 
  core mhz : 120, 
  memory mhz : 1300, 
  power limit ( watt ) : 90, 
  all gpus in this rig are gtx 1070 evga sc, 
  nvidia cards are 2x times more expensive than amd cards ( i.e. 
  i would recommend them for their msrp ~ 200 eur price . 
  i bought all my amd gpus at msrp prices ( i.e. 
  rx 470 for ~ 220 usd ) , while gtx 1070 ( evga sc ) a bit more expensive than msrp , for ~ 550 usd . 
  it was in april so the risk of not breaking-even is higher today . 
  this is definitely not get-rich-quick scheme - e.g. 
  almost all my initial psus broke down ( pci-e cables melted ) so i had to return them ( however eu law warranty covered all cases ) and then buy more expensive ones . 
  i mine only eth because dual mining consumes more power and like i said i had some negative experience with burning psus . 
  now i have platinum 1200w psus for each rig ( i have 5 rx470 x 6 rigs , 1 rx470 x 5 rig , and 1 gtx1070 x 6 rig ) . . so 41 gpus in total . 
  the gtx1070 rig costed about 4100 usd in total while rx470 rigs about 2000 usd each . 
  its risky to build a new rig now ( especially nvidia ) , but if eth price does not crash then you are likely to repay the investment within one year probably . 
  i have a watt meter , multimeter and psu tester ( [ this one ] ( https://www.amazon.de/digiflex-pr%c3%bcfger%c3%a4t-spannungsversorgung-lcd-display-diagnose/dp/b004io5ct8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1505333364&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=psu+tester ) ) . 
  also , since i am in europe my voltage is 230volts , not sure if this makes any real difference against usa 120v . 
  ctrl + f `` estonia '' - 0/0 found . 
  can a foreigner start a business in estonia ? 
  yes , a foreigner can start a business in estonia . 
  there is plenty of information available about that on the internet . 
  you are not different from morenovn, 
  you are welcome , shill . 
  you are only hurting agrello by this bullshit you are pushing in this sub every day . 
  that was the last straw , now eth is doomed . 
  you could sue a seller though . 
  when i buy from amazon the seller is not a chinese company . 
  do you know what part started fire ? 
  i do n't think that chinese companies are directly selling things on amazon . 
  since you are using karma and account age as an indicator , i think you are fucked in comparison to me . 
  you are just another shill , like aneesssh , gokayuna and all other bots . 
  the team is largely incompetent . 
  instead of working on the project ( and processing withdrawals ) , they hire trolls that come after you when you start asking questions . 
  and these trolls will be calling me names in my replies - all coincidentally will be a few months old at max accounts . 
  yes i am using my real account . 
  when i was asking questions in slack or telegram or this fucking subreddit , the only response was `` fuck you '' by endless amount of trolls like you or this mexcian moderator `` juanmd '' that knows absolutely nothing . 
  so that 's how agrello spends money they raised - on hiring shitty trolls . 
  no , i am not monerovn . 
  yes , monerovn is troll - just like other thousand trolls in this sub - aneesh84 , gokayutna , koustourika just to name a few , except that they are trolling in favor of agrello , not against . 
  are you calling them out too ? 
  if you remember what was happening on during the first days of ico - literally 1-2 days old accounts were posting a few words comments like `` great project , very bullish '' to every post on this subreddit . 
  i spent 5 eth on this project and of course i want it 's token price to rise - but i am not delusional to ignore how they were processing withdrawals or their troll army on this subreddit/slack/telegram . 
  yeah whatever . 
  just fyi i submitted my kyc documents before they lifted this as requirement for < 2 btc and got verified . 
  you did not even read what i said - my kyc information was submitted before the ico started and i had no problems with it . 
  check the pools status . 
  it looks like that its working https://ethermine.org/miners/7e329ad735acbc46812e3a7d46a24d90fe552954 . 
  how it can be a thread while its based on ethereum ? 
  i do n't use windows , but i use simplemining.net os on a 16gb usb flash drive and it works fine . 
  my 8 pin pci-e cabled burned ( melted ) a bit . 
  it happened with 5 psus . 
  let me guess , all these wallets are yours ? 
  this website looks scammy, 
   looks like he is n't gon na payup either, 
  should have used a smart contract , price could be synced using an oracle . 
  you still believe in tesla ? 
  or edison ? 
  pshh sheep, 
  this probably one of the cases when eu regulations are really useful - here in eu all items have 2 years `` legal warranty '' ( in addition to the `` manufacturer warranty '' ) and it 's nearly impossible to avoid it .
