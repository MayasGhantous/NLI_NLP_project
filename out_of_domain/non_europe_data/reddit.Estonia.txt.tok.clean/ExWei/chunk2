  i live in the capital city and see them quite often . 
   making things up again, 
  if you really think that in reality that i never seen them , then you are delusional . 
  so far you are the only who makes things up , according to you i am racist because i admit that eu has issues , and i moved to britan , however even i do not know that i moved to britain . 
  thanks for the eye-opener . 
   the article does n't say what you say , ehat a surprise that you are making things up again, 
  it literally says `` syrian man who arrived in the country as a refugee into custody for preliminary investigation after he was suspected of setting his wife on fire . 
  '' , how it does not mean '' recently a refugee tried to burn his wife in estonia '' ? 
  can you have at least one argument without calling your opponent racist ? 
   is very relevant of your fascism . 
  well he literally said `` free speech brigade '', 
  wow that guy is so rude , he does seem to completely to despise the peasants who buy his shit . 
  despite the reporter/pranker is very wrong , he was not have to slap him . 
  he could [ take notes from tom cruise ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d7wzcdt_0s ) . 
  i agree with what the video says , but the narrator 's voice is so annoying & condescending , he just assumes that the viewer was in coma for the latest 100 years . 
  is this el chapo ? 
   we need solutions, 
  hire a copywriter . 
  most likely just a google translate thing .

  as i found [ there ] ( http://www.terviseuudised.ee/haigus/2016/05/26/vasektoomia ) , it is allowed only if you have at least 3 children , older than 35 years or there are medical reasons . 
  why would anyone do voluntarily such thing to themselves anyway ? 
  so is it nsa fault that microsoft failed to prevent this malware ? 
  microsoft knows that it is their fault , and that 's why windows 10 is enforcing updates . 
  is this code web scale ? 
  100 % tests coverage ? 
  look at this article from april 15 : [ windows consumers woke up on saturday to some good news : microsoft says it has already patched a series of potentially catastrophic hacks ] ( http://fortune.com/2017/04/15/microsoft-shadow-brokers-patch/ ), 
  when did this `` wannacry '' attack happen ? 
  last week . 
  so it was not zero day at least on april 15 . 
  microsoft failed to distribute its patch to all windows devices . 
  yeah bro i really do n't , thanks for the eye opener . 
  except that i really do , and it does not mean some bs articles that microsoft uses to cover up their failures . 
  oh , or the real issue there is that nsa is not guilty of at least something ? 
  sorry for speaking against the narrative . 
  there should be no option to do not update in first place ( with only exception to windows server edition ) . 
   the nsa should sit on vulnerabilities then ? 
  besides as i keep saying they have probably found and fixed literal thousands of exploits that you have never , and will never know about . 
  nsa should not sit on exploits , but windows is a microsoft product and its foremost their liability to keep it secure . 
   do you think every exploit is found instantly ? 
  nobody thinks that . 
  they would not exist in this case . 
   how do you find them ? 
  u say u know lots so how do you find them ? 
  no googling now use ur big old brain, 
  i wont respond to your original question , but i will respond on how exploits are being ** prevented ** to the software : 1 ) input sanitation 2 ) sandboxing ( now windows 10 apps from their app store do that ) , its a very important thing , probably if microsoft went this way at the very beginning ( completely without allowing `` normal '' apps ) , it would have prevented like 99 % of all windows exploits . 
  3 ) obviously internal security audit . 
  bugs in general are prevented via tdd/bdd testing and separated qa team if the company is big enough to afford it . 
  so , if something is wrong with microsoft software , it is microsoft fault foremost . 
  trying to blame everything on nsa is just ridiculous , its like they do not know what is responsibility . 
  he is a hero , we should probably erect a monument in his honor . 
  probably from bronze , i already know where we could get the material :d, 
  unbelievable . 
  erdogan is creating his own mini-army in all western countries . 
  yes , the title is clickbait ( but it is err who created that title , not me ) . 
  he says he wont allow `` nato '' troops in finland to aid estonia . 
  for example , germany is a nato member and a eu member at the same time . 
  assume , russia attacked estonia and germany wants to aid estonia and germany needs to be in finland to do so . 
  would he classify it as `` eu aid '' or as `` nato strangers '' ? 
  also , at the same time he says that he expects that 42.7 lisbon treaty article does not rule out military aid , which means that if russia attacks finland and estonia aids finland , nato is getting dragged into conflict automatically . 
   there is zero reason why nato or eu troops need to be in finland to defend estonia . 
  they need to be in estonia to defend estonia . 
   what is this retardation ? 
  only reason youd need to go to through finland is if you want to attack russia , not defend yourself from it . 
  if russia would , for example , close the `` suwalki gap '' then going to estonia through finland would make sense . 
  not to mention that if estonia is attacked then some kind of response to russia could be made from finland , given their big border with russia . 
  also , finland has airbases and docks that could be used and some of them are in very proximity to the estonian coast . 
  what the finnish defense minister said only added uncertainty . 
  it looks like that he wants to benefit from nato but at the same time hold no nato obligations . 
  what a `` smart ass '' . 
  ** edit ** : i bet if russia would attack finland then he would change his opinion regarding nato troops in 1 second . 
  and what if estonia is under attack , genius ? 
  finland says `` fuck you , its your business '' ? 
   i will re write it , hopefully with less letters and more spaces so you understand . 
  you did not understand my message . 
  i said that finland wants all eu countries ( means nato too ) help to finland in case of war , but if estonia is under attack , then finland is not going to `` let nato strangers in '' ? 
  you understand ? 
  ** he said he wont let nato troops in if estonia is already attacked , not in time of peace . 
  ** ** at the same time , he wants everyone else to help finland , including nato that will be automatically engaged if any eu&nato country helps finland ** . 
   are you seriously retarded, 
  only retarded thing here is, 
   does it ? 
  yes . 
  eu has article 42.7 , it says :, 
  * if a member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory , the other member states, 
  shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power , in, 
  accordance with article 51 of the united nations charter . 
  this shall not prejudice the specific, 
  character of the security and defence policy of certain member states . 
  assume that russia attacked finland and estonia aids finland by sending estonian troops to finland . 
  the very first moment when estonian and russian troops are engaged in combat , russia would treat it as estonian aggression against russia and therefore start its invasion into estonia , which would immediately trigger nato article 5 which says * `` each member state to consider an armed attack against one member state , in europe or north america , to be an armed attack against them all '' * . 
  therefore , de facto , if russia attacks finland then it would be have to fight with entire nato , because i doubt that russia would e.g. 
  fight german and estonian troops only in finland but do not attempt any invasion into e.g. 
  germany/estonia . 
   pretty sure eu countries are not synonymous with nato , and their forces are not one and the same . 
  check my comment [ there ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/6bofrp/finnish_defense_minister_wouldnt_allow_in_nato/dhojqpo/ ) , i explained how nato could get involved if russia attacks finland . 
   but in this scenario , it 's quite likely russia would avoid attacking nato members specifically to avoid triggering article 5 . 
  and an attack on estonian troops inside finland is a much less clear application of article 5 .
