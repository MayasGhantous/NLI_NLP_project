  this is the area of uncertainty . 
  us invoked article 5 after 9/11 so just attack on troops that are outside of country also could invoke the article 5 , since the terrorist attack did . 
  also , i am really not sure that if russia ever attacks finland , things would be as usual on the estonian-russian border . 
  russia does provocations all the time ( e.g. 
  abduction of eston kohver from estonia ) even in the peace time . 
  is this a real photo or a photoshopped one ? 
  how do you say `` database '' in hipster ? 
  hesburger is the finnish clone of mcdonald 's . 
  some finn traveled to us some long time ago , saw mcdonald 's and decided to create something similar in finland . 
  now hesburger is a chain network just like mcdonald 's . 
  i thought it is an endless gif initially, 
  good, 
  there is russian-language tv which is run by the russian government , but only ethnic russians watch it . 
  there are some politicians , like yana toom that are obviously sponsored by russia . 
  [ in case of yana toom , she was ( maybe still is ) a russian citizen until 2006 when savisaar granted her citizenship ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/yana_toom ) . 
   if they want us they can take us by force, 
  they ca n't . 
  because of nato . 
  the only people who are getting ill feelings from ethnic estonians are those people ( i.e. 
  those russians ) who are hostile either to the estonia or to the ethnic estonians . 
  many ethnic russians are still commemorating 9th may while estonians do not , many of them like the `` bronze solider '' , many of them say things like `` ussr built factories for you !!! '' . 
  only reason why they vote for the pro-russian politicians like yana toom is because they promise to hand out them estonian citizenship and only because of that - its not like they care about infrastructure development , economic , taxes - they vote for them only because of the ethnic factor . 
  estonian citizenship is not hard to get , the only requirements are to live 8 years in estonia ( many of them lived 50 + years ) , know estonian language at least at b1 level , and some constitution knowledge test . 
  i wonder is / u/eresidency account run by the government ? 
  hateful video, 
  could you send link to the store ? 
  are you talking about german mindfactory ( mindfactory.de ) ? 
  they seem to have both rx 470 and rx 570 out of stock . 
  if 194,93 eur deal that you are talking about is still in stock , could you please send me the link ? 
  i pay 0.1 eur ( with vat ) per kwh as a business customer in some eu country . 
  is expensive-than-15-16c rate that you are referring to is for residential or business customers in your country ? 
   usually there 's a lot of additional costs , the naked energy cost is around 0.16 $ . . but with all the related costs it has a final price of about $ 0.30 . 
  wow that 's so high . 
  in estonia the naked energy cost is about 0.05 $ per kwh and then there is energy transfer fee which is plus another 0.05-0 .07 $ . 
  so in total it gets to about 0.12 $ per kwh for residential and to 0.10 $ per kwh for business in my case . 
  however even this 0.10 $ can get reduced ( via lower energy transfer fee ) if you consume really a lot of electricity . 
   i think gtx 1070/1060 will start to get depleted soon when miners realize they are profitable too . 
  they are profitable but roi is much lower . 
   a normal estonian wo n't know because we do n't pay for it . 
  normal estonians who work pay for it via social tax which is 33 % of the `` most gross '' ( not sure how to call it ) salary . 
  [ here is a calculator ] ( http://www.kalkulaator.ee/et/palgakalkulaator ), 
  nvidia cards are also a lot more expensive than amd, 
  i see on amazon.de that gtx 1060 6gb costs at least 250eur . 
  i bought * ( about 2 months ago ) * rx 470 4gb for about 210eur and they are doing ~ 28mh/s when bios-modded and overclocked . 
  so how many mh/s gtx 1060 can do when overclocked ( nvidia ca n't get bios modded , right ? ), 
  yes , hopefully amd cards will be back in stock soon . 
  it is limited to 10 per customer . 
  i added it to cart , then changed quantity to 50 and then it displayed this :, 
   ` quantity ' must be less than or equal to ' 10 ' . 
  another washington post bullshit article . 
  us does much more than any other nato member to protect estonia and yet its `` trendy '' to bash it . 
  all these us troops and aircraft that are right now in estonia are going to do what if russia invades , according to that article ? 
  get killed by the russians and trump would completely ignore that ? 
   russia were to infiltrate little green men into estonia , as it did in crimea, 
  except that ukraine is not a nato member and a lot less stable than estonia . 
  putin is not that insane to get in conflict with whole nato just because of his imaginary imperialistic reasons . 
   moreover , trump devoted much of his brussels speech , the highlight of his first presidential trip to nato , to berating the allies for not paying their fair share . 
  yes surely trump is pro-russian because he said that other nato countries should more contribute to nato defense . 
  strong logic . 
   did you read the article aside from the title and snippets ? 
  yes , i did read the whole article . 
   why ? 
  not to repel invasion . 
  they could n't . 
  they 're not strong enough . 
  to put it very coldly , they 're there to die . 
  they 're a deliberate message to the enemy that if you invade our ally , you will have to kill a lot of americans first . 
  which will galvanize us into full-scale war against you . 
  it is about south korea in the article . 
  it completely omits that there is a similar thing in estonia - because it would be harder to bash us if mention that . 
  the article fails to mention anything about us troops in estonia . 
  it depicts estonia as some `` 2nd class citizen '' - nato member so that even south korea which is not a nato member gets us troops while estonia does not ( as the article would want you to think ) . 
  that 's overly expensive , they are outdated now but few months ago their price was ~ $ 200 . 
  yes , theoretically it is possible . 
  it also could hide some your accepted shares and i even know few pools that are probably doing that . 
  well i do not want to spread fud or something , but i mined on https://ethermine.org/ for about 1 month and my `` effective hashrate '' ( which is being calculated from accepted shares ) was constantly lower by 5-20 % than reported hashrate and never higher , very rarely it was equal . 
  you can click at some of the `` top miners '' on their website and you can see that literally everyone has the same issue , for example :, 
  - [ 70 gh/s vs 80 gh/s ( 12 % difference ) ] ( https://ethermine.org/miners/58801ebec6685d0d5461a30999fa5df91549a59e ), 
  - [ 61 gh/s vs 66 gh/s ( 8 % difference ) ] ( https://ethermine.org/miners/8613a3342fe57860a3403bf8b1f0c63c2566a34d ), 
  i mine on https://dwarfpool.com/ right now - however it also has some shady things ( such as unconfirmed shares for many hours ) , but my effective hashrate is always + - 5 % of the reported hashrate there . 
  i just do not get why someone uses ethermine.org , especially big miners with like 50-70gh / s hashrate . 
  even if ignore their shady tricks with effective hashrate , just 1 % fee is significant in their case . 
  with 70gh/s it is around $ 3500/month right now . 
  combine their official 1 % with 5-20 % hashrate loss and you are losing lots of $ , like around $ 18,000 - $ 75,000 / month if you have 70gh/s ( as some their `` top miners '' do ) . 
  i have 35 rx 470 that are doing about 1 gh/s , and i spent around $ 9,000 on that . 
  [ op also spent around $ 9,000 and is doing just ~ 330 mh/s ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ethermining/comments/6ez7a0/thanks_for_buying_all_the_amds/diei660/ ) . 
  almost 3 times lower than my amd setup . 
  how many hashes/s nvidia cards ( when overclocked ) do at zcash mining ? 
   got 2 r9 290s and 2 rx 480s . 
  ** both 8gb ** . 
  if putin invades estonia and kills any us troops ( american citizens ) there is absolutely no way how trump or any other us president could avoid article 5 invocation . 
  that 's why us troops are there and even this op article mentions it as an example of such us policy in south korea ( but once again , the article completely fails to mention that there is the same us policy in estonia - that 's why i am attacking this article ) . 
  ok then everything is a bullshit assumption . 
  trump could pull out all troops , say that he would honor the article 5 and in reality do not that . 
  would it be any better ? 
  he is obliged to honor that so media questions like * `` president drumpf you are literally hitler , you are such a bigot and a racist , despite the fact that there is thousands of us troops in estonia , can you answer that bullshit question that everyone knows answer to ? 
  no matter what you answer we will bash you 24/7 '' *, 
  btw , is there any other eu&nato country that does more than us for the deterrence against russia ? 
  i wanted to really answer your question but then i checked your post history and you just wrote 7 comments in that thread bashing estonia . 
  why are you so butthurt about that ?
