  but even then , i still will answer your question :, 
  probably if russians would be commemorating just `` end of war '' there would be no issue . 
  but they are commemorating soviet conquest of estonia - and this is the issue . 
  they still repeat the same bullshit - `` there was no occupation , we built the factories !!! 111 '' . 
  but i guess you already perfectly know that . 
   well yeah , i realise that the actual cultural baggage around 9 may is pretty fraught . 
  but still , your post seemed to imply ( especially to someone who does n't know the history ) that the mere act of celebrating something estonians do n't celebrate is disrespectful , which is a pretty damn long bow to draw . 
  well my post was intended to imply that 9th may is bad because it is intertwined with waving of russian/soviet flags , [ deportations denial ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_deportations_from_estonia ) , occupation denial * ( they voted 99.99 % in favor of ussr , must be a real referendum ) * and other obvious anti-estonian elements . 
  if russians would just commemorate the people who died in the ww2 then i would personally have no issues with that event . 
   as for my butthurt , i was abused by an estonian patriot as a child, 
  i am sorry . 
  may i ask if you do you live in estonia as of today and do you have an estonian citizenship ? 
  i personally undervolt primarily because i can use 1000w psu that way . 
  when undervolted my rig takes about ~ 950w , while without undervolting it is about ~ 1200w . 
  1000w is net , while 950w is at-wall . 
  i think 1000w net translates to something 1050w at-wall, 
  why / s ? 
  except odd `` p '' writing , it looks completely ok, 
  i have a lot of rigs that do ~ 170 mh/s . 
  i could sell them , dunno , maybe $ 4000 or $ 5000 each . 
  i could even do a vat invoice . 
  since france is in eu no extra taxes . 
  what price you see in the amazon checkout is the absolutely final price . 
  i buy from amazon myself so i know this , and this is eu law btw . 
  ** edit : ** did not you ask it already in this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/eesti/comments/69mp7l/got_a_question_about_ordering_from_amazonde/ ? 
  check closely the price that you see at the checkout ( the very last step ) . 
  there you will see the final price with all charges/taxes . 
  as an example , i have two amazon.de accounts - one for my private purchases and other for my company ( vat-registered ) purchases . 
  let 's use [ this camera as an example product ] ( https://www.amazon.de/sony-dsc-hx60-digitalkamera-megapixel-lcd-display/dp/b00i9x2klw/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1497118546&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sony+cyber-shot+dsc-hx60 ) . 
  currently on the product page i see price 241 eur . 
  when i add it to basket using my private account , [ i see postage - 12.54 , ** vat - 43.01 ** , and total price - 258.07 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yi5sksv.png ) . 
  when i add it to basket using my company account , [ i see postage - 15.05 , ** vat - 0 ** , and total price - 217.57 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rdhcyhc.png ) . 
  so when you buy as a private person , you just pay the price you see in the checkout and nothing in estonia . 
  when you buy a as a company , you also pay the price at the checkout but instead of paying german/french vat , you pay vat in estonia . 
  you are welcome . 
  also , i am not sure about french amazon , but on german amazon when it says `` dispatched from and sold by amazon . '', 
  then it means it will be shipped by dhl express so you do n't have to go to the post , usually it takes 1-3 days . 
  they usually call few hours in advance to ask you if the delivery time is ok . 
  likewise , the exact shipping method and estimated delivery date is also written in the final checkout step .

  [ we are gon na fight radical islamic terrorism , believe me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=runypf4q2g8&amp;t=1s ), 
  i use it with the dev fee and it works just fine . 
  i live ( and run a company ) in a country with 0 % corporate capital gains tax and 0 % corporate income tax :d . sorry for you guys who have to deal with these pesky things . 
  ** edit ** : [ i included an example calculation in the below comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ethermining/comments/6glyz8/psa_mining_is_a_realizable_tax_event/dirvyok/ ), 
  estonia , an eu/nato/oecd / eurozone member at the same time . 
  it has however 20 % tax rate for individuals , but it applies only when you pay yourself dividends . 
  so you can reinvest your money without tax infinitely . 
  for example , if your company revenue was $ 1000 in a year and you did not pay yourself any dividends then there is no taxes . 
  if you paid yourself $ 100 dividends then tax is $ 100 * 20 % = $ 20 . 
  so it encourages reinvestment . 
  no , it is not exactly like that . 
  extremely rough example ( i inflated profit numbers for easier calculation so not have to use decimals ) :, 
  assume i invested $ 20,000 into the mining business . 
  then assume i was re-investing every $ of profit into the mining business over few years . 
  since there is no capital gains / income taxes , it does not matter whether the profit is from ethereum price fluctuations , mining income or anything else , so i do not have to write down when i mined the coin , etc. 
  so , later , assume it comes down to the following :, 
  | year | profit | year end balance ( prev balance + profit - dividends - tax ) | dividends | tax paid |, 
  | ** total ** :| ** $ 2,270,000 ** | ** $ 1,190,000 ** | ** $ 900,000 ** | ** $ 180,000 **, 
  so as you can see , from $ 2,270,000 company profit just $ 180,000 of taxes is paid . 
  in us with c-corp there would be double taxation , and the final tax amount with the same amount of dividends would be much higher than $ 180,000 , with any legal entity . 
  some unpleasant situation with the big government you got over there . 
  notice : i am not a lawyer . 
  for legal companies :, 
  so once it finds out it will send you a letter requesting to immediately pay the taxes specifying the exact amount they want . 
  if you still do not pay them then they will calculate interest about ~ 10 % per annum . 
  if after some time you are still not paying then they will add some fine . 
  if it did not work either , then they will enforce bankruptcy and ban you from running a company for 1-2 years . 
  for private persons :, 
  if tax evasion is small then a fine , if it is big then a fine or prison sentence up to 5 years , if it is extremely big ( over $ 400,000 ) then prison sentence 1 - 7 years . 
  for both legal companies and private persons the law says that there should be intent to evade taxes , so if you did not pay them by mistake and are able to prove it in court then there wo n't be a fine or prison sentence . 
  however , taxes are much lower here than in us so it is not very costly to pay them , i made an example calculation in some other comment - [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ethermining/comments/6glyz8/psa_mining_is_a_realizable_tax_event/dirvyok/ ), 
  tallinn translates as taani linn , which means danish town . 
  also , denmark got it 's flag from estonia . 
  it depends on your country . 
  i am sure in north korea it is banned . 
  i heard some venezuelans reported problems too . 
  but if you do not live in such country and just mining ( and paying required taxes ) then there should be no issues . 
  on ethermine.org my effective hashrate is always 5-10 % lower than the reported hashrate . 
  if they are legit , then why such difference ? 
  i do not know but something similar once happened to me : i was messing with bios mods and overclocking and my rx 470 got to about 40 mh/s for about 30 seconds . 
  probably it was just a claymore displaying bug in my case rather than a real hash rate . 
  i think rather than some government conspiracy theory this guy is just very smart ( because somehow his miner ** allegedly ** has higher hash rate output ) so everyone uses it , therefore he is very rich as well , because of the dev fee it collects . 
  what 's more interesting in my opinion , is which exactly `` optimizations '' it uses in order to achieve that ? 
  as he [ refers ] ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1433925.0 ) to that :, 
   - nofee set `` 1 '' to cancel my developer fee at all . 
  in this mode some optimizations are disabled so mining speed will be slower by about 4 % . 
   by enabling this mode , i will lose 100 % of my earnings , you will lose only 2-3 % of your earnings . 
   so you have a choice : `` fastest miner '' or `` completely free miner but a bit slower '' . 
   if you want both `` fastest '' and `` completely free '' you should find some other miner that meets your requirements , just do n't use this miner instead of claiming that i need, 
  to cancel/reduce developer fee , saying that 1-2 % developer fee is too much for this miner and so on . 
  so what i am thinking is , probably these optimizations simply do not exist and the claymore miner just ** visually ** multiplies hashrate by 103 % in the ui so it looks like it that it is higher , but actually it is not . 
  so he runs this scam called `` optimizations '' and takes 1-2 % fee to his pocket while in reality there is no optimizations/hashrate improvement whatsoever ? 
  closed source is not inherently bad . 
  you just need to trust the developer of the software to make sure that no bad things are happening .
