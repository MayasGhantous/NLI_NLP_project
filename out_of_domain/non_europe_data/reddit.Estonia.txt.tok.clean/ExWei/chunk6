  ethereum price may go + - 20 % within a day and they are offering 5 % - 8 % for a year ... 
  so if claymore would deposit his $ 100m he would get just ( assume 7 % interest rate ) $ 7m for that , while if an average guy would deposit $ 50,000 into that then it gets to just $ 3,500 per year . 
  this is very low in my opinion for an investment into something that goes + - 20 % within a day . 
  i do n't know exactly but definitely it is somehow automated . 
  so yes , it seems to be just a long term deposit into a very volatile currency with just 5-8 % interest rate . 
  but you can withdraw the deposit at any moment tbh , it is described in the link that i sent above . 
  try to run some benchmark on it without overclocking . 
  if temperature will get to 100c then rma it . 
  dwarfpool is getting down ever day since recently . 
  i was using them for months but now i switched to nanopool . 
  also it is a bit suspicious that balance on dwarfpool may be unconfirmed for hours . 
   i 've tried switching over to pools like nanopool and the shares i get are literally half the amount, 
  it does not matter . 
  dwarfpool just has different difficulty so you are getting a lot of shares . 
  my `` reported hashrate '' is 940-970 btw . 
  reported hashrate fluctuates from 940 to 970 mh/s, 
  since this april, 
  i have sold some part of my eth and right now i am holding about 20.5 eth, 
   not without putting in work or risk their capital , no , they do n't . 
  with pos , they would . 
  zero risk, 
  zero risk ? 
  ethereum fluctuates ~ 10-20 % every day so 7 % interest rate in pos is just ridiculously small with such extremely high volatility . 
  there is huge risk in pos investments - 2 days ago ethereum price was ~ $ 390 , right now it is $ 337 , nobody knows what it will be the next week . 
  i agree with the rest of your argument but there is definitely some risk in pos . 
  if these cards are real , where can you pre-order them ? 
  where did you get this info ? 
  what is your memory overclock ? 
  should be at least 2000 mhz . 
  imo once difficulty will be high enough all these people with 1 gpu will leave . 
  so after that , difficulty will get lower again . 
  not that i disagree tbh , there is already enough information . 
  look at the ethereum difficulty chart . 
  it goes both up and down . 
  i think if you are married you are not have to pay tax on that , but i am not sure . 
  you could call emta ( esotnian tax board ) and ask them that question http://www.emta.ee/eng/private-client . 
   any idea on how much estonian pay in taxes on their wages ? 
  yes . 
  if net salary is 1000 $ then it looks like that :, 
  note that some % are relative to gross or `` very gross '' ( not sure how to call it ) amount . 
  name | rate | amount, 
  social tax | 33 % | 412.5 $, 
  unemployment insurance ( employer part ) | 0.8 % | 10 $, 
  unemployment insurance ( employee part ) | 1.6 % | 20 $, 
  pension second pillar ( mandatory by law if you are born after 1983 ) | 2 % | 25 $, 
  personal income tax | 20 % | 205 $, 
  total tax paid is 672.5 $ , which is 40.21 % of the `` very gross '' wage . 
  it looks like the following : employer pays 672.5 $ to the tax board and the remaining 1000 $ to your account . 
  however , the common answer would be just 20 % since theoretically it is the only tax paid by the employee ( but even this in 99 % of cases is filed to the tax board by the employer so in reality all taxes are paid by employer ) . 
  probably my explanation got very confusing , there is some calculator http://www.kalkulaator.ee/en/salary-calculator and it correctly calculates taxes . 
  however i just re-read your post - if your wife is not estonian resident ( resident = more than 183 days in estonia per year ) and just has an account in an estonian bank then there are definitely no taxes there . 
  yes . 
  my point is that if 1-gpu-miners leave due to the high difficulty it will go down . 
  there are free miners like genoil or sgminer-gm , what prevents from using them instead of claymore ? 
  yes , they changed the fee to 0.2 % recently . 
  imo it always a shady pool . 
  i personally use nanopool , it is much larger ( 280 gh vs 4600 gh hash power at the moment ) , it has 1 % fee . 
  i am into mining since this april , i have 35 gpus and ~ 950 mh/s hash power . 
  until recently i was using dwarfpool which is kind of okay but it also had some shady things like unconfirmed shares for 12 hours ( i could wait 12 hours but i could not think of any legit reason why it would be 12 hours ) . 
  since recently dwarfpool started getting down almost every day and i thought it is the time to find a new pool . 
  everyone around was praising nanopool so i switched to it . 
  so far ( since about june 10 ) it did not have any downtime issues , monitoring updates every 10 minutes and it may take up to ~ 20 minutes for it to calculate all shares that you submitted and add them to your balance . 
  before dwarfpool and nanopool i also tried ethermine.org back in the april and it was always showing effective hash rate about 5-10 % lower than the reported hash rate so i do not like ethermine.org since then . 
  yes , if all would stop their rigs difficulty would drop to 0 . 
  1 rx 570 costs ~ $ 220 ( msrp ) . 
  1 gtx 1070 costs about $ 490 right now . . so $ 200 are likely to be not enough to build at least any rig , let alone decent .

  are you running windows ? 
  their license `` restricts use of the software as server software '' - [ # 2.c . v , link ] ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/useterms/retail/windows/10/useterms_retail_windows_10_english.htm ) . 
  i had the same issue with ethermine.org . 
  you could click at some of their `` top miners '' ( list at the index page ) and almost all of them have the same issue . 
  i use nanopool and my effective hashrate varies within 10 % of the reported hash rate . 
  i have about ~ 950 mh/s so sometimes it is 850 mh/s and sometimes 1100 mh/s . 
  what is your effective hashrate on a pool ? 
  there is no such thing as `` my own difficulty '' - it is the same for everyone . 
  you can see it there https://www.coinwarz.com/difficulty-charts/ethereum-difficulty-chart . 
  increasing worldwide hash rate ( miners ) = increasing difficulty . 
  the opposite is also true : decreasing worldwide hash rate = decreasing difficulty . 
  so you can reboot your computer as much as you want , it wo n't affect difficulty . 
  it seems to be just too good for $ 1000 . 
  i would suggest you to download simplemining.net ( free ) os to your usb drive ( make sure to change the email in the config and configure it to use ethereum ) and then test it if it really can mine at 120 mh/s . 
  so if your calculated hash rate is 63 then it is an absolutely legit and a real hash rate . 
  if you just overclock gpu ( just +600 mhz ) and do not undervolt cpu , what happens ? 
  also , what is your cpu model ? 
   alpereum showed reported hash of around 50 mh and a calculated hash of 33 mh/s . 
  calculated hash rate is what really matters . 
  probably something interferes with claymore so therefore it is reporting the wrong hash rate . 
   i 'm really not sure what happened here . 
  it appears i spent 8-ish hours mining fine , getting correct shares and everything , but the eth was later deducted from my balance, 
  they were deducted because they were transferred to your wallet . 
  yes - i forgot that alpereum has minimum payout ( they introduced it recently ) . 
  it looks very weird then why your balance got deducted . 
  according to the [ calculator there ( link ) ] ( http://whattomine.com/coins/151-eth-ethash?utf8=%e2%9c%93&amp;hr=30&amp;p=220.0&amp;fee=0.0&amp;cost=0.1&amp;hcost=0.0&amp;commit=calculate ) , with 30 mh/s you should be making 0.000688 eth/hour and 0.001147 eth/hour if your hash rate is 50 mh/s .
