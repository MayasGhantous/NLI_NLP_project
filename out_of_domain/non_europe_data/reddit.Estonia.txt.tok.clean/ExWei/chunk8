  nobody knows what will happen with ethereum in 6 months - it 's price may go to $ 1000 , may go to $ 50 , may go or not go proof of stake . 
  if you look at some old posts ( like from jan 2016 ) on bitcointalk.org you will see that everyone is predicting that mining will be unprofitable `` very soon '' , but yet , its profitability ( in $ ) only increased . 
  likewise , mining still may be profitable in a year or two from now . 
  or may be not . 
  if you are willing to take this uncertainty risk , then it makes sense to install 2 gtx 1070 to your current rig . 
  3 gtx 1070 would consume around 500w . 
  yes , you are right . 
  i meant 570 . 
  so assume this scenario : i spent $ 1000 on ethereum when it 's price was $ 40 and 2 months later it crashed to $ 1 and is not going to recover . 
  that way i lost $ 975 and ethereum that i bought is pretty much useless now . 
  or , i bought a rig for $ 1000 and even if ethereum crashes i still can mine other coins . 
  if all coins crashed my hardware is still worth something . 
   you made a bad investment , but got bailed out by the market . 
  this kind of bad investments works since 2010 . 
   profit is going down everyday . 
  today 's profit in usd is higher than it was in april . 
  yes , you can . 
  mining programs like claymore allows you to specify a gpu index ( es ) that you want to use for mining . 
  a single gpu would just make a few dollars a day , you wo n't make any money that way . 
   how much did one of your 6x 470 rigs cost counting all the components ? 
  about 1700 eur . 
   also , at what price did you get the 470s, 
  6 sapphire nitro rx470 4gb at 190 eur and 29 msi gaming x rx470 4gb at 220 eur . 
  note that it was back in april . 
  today they are out of stock or are being reselled for like $ 500 . 
  `` mining wo n't be profitable next week '' - every day , since 2009 . 
  i have some nvidia gpus so i could try this . 
  he still has the chance though , with this one weird old trick .

  also note that many landlords will want you to pay 1 ( or 2 ) months in advance , a real estate agent fee , and a deposit . 
  it is usually rent price * 3 . 
  i did not use this website but i often see this in similar threads https://goworkabit.ee/?lang=en . 
  it may be helpful . 
  it 's called e-residency and it 's basically an account for estonian e-government websites . 
  it is not a residence permit and especially not a citizenship . 
  * segmentfault *, 
  a helicopter ride should be a right . 
  username checks out . 
  since the very first days ( like 2009 - 2010 ) everyone was predicting that mining will be dead `` the next week '' , and as you can see , today , 7 years later it is still very alive . 
  so kinda `` toilet clown '' username makes it even funnier . 
  look at bitcointalk posts from 2015 or 2016 - this * `` ethereum going pos soon , see you cards for $ 10 on ebay '' * argument is already very tired . 
   it 'll keep going up and eventually it wo n't be worth mining, 
  no , it wo n't be - nobody has free electricity . 
  it will reach some kind of equilibrium . 
  [ look at this difficulty chart ] ( https://www.coinwarz.com/difficulty-charts/ethereum-difficulty-chart ) - it also goes down sometimes ( but the general trend is up ) . 
   but you 'll have to keep on adding hardware and replacing cards as they die since it takes so much longer, 
  i bought 35 rx470 about this april and they already broken-even ( or as people say on this sub ( wrong terminology ) , `` roi 'd '' ) . 
  i live in eu and all products have 2 years * legal * guarantee so if gpu dies the manufacturer will have to repair it . 
  are you aware eth price is 6.25 x of what it was in april ? 
  difficulty is only 5x btw . 
  200t vs 1000t . 
   most of western europe and scandinavia is socialist, 
  no , they all are capitalist . 
  it seems to be a common misconception . 
  also : '' [ denmark tells bernie sanders it 's had enough of his ` socialist ' slurs ] ( http://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/denmark-tells-bernie-sanders-to-stop-calling-it-socialist/ ) '' . 
   or is this too difficult for a single cell organism such as yourself ? 
  oh , it did not take long for you to descend to insults . 
   sure , i said most , then you keep bring up one country ... 
   one does n't equal all . 
  let me repeat my comment : `` no , they ** all ** are capitalist . '', 
  do you see word `` all '' ? 
  what really sad is influx of people to this sub with one or two gpus that think that they are `` experts '' . 
  such a great sub turning into cancer . 
  a good website to find hiking places in estonia http://loodusegakoos.ee/where-to-go/search-options . 
  i agree . 
  these people who bought a used gtx 1060 and now think that they are `` experts '' are really annoying . 
  or even worse , those who are mining using their pc . 
  your post is already getting downvoted . 
  the `` experts '' with a used gpu are triggered . 
   in 6 months all current hardware will be mining for pennies . 
  mining requires continuously updating hardware . 
  people are still mining with r9 380 , a gpu from 2015 . 
  oh watch out - i see you used common sense and logic , it seems to be an unpopular thing in this sub . 
  it 's full of people who are frustrated that their single gpu did not make them rich . 
  i agree . 
  the roi from mining is incredibly high and in my opinion it is safer to mine rather than to directly buy the coin - if the coin crashes you at least still have the hardware . 
   yeah fuck people for trying to get in on the action with whatever hardware they have lying around . 
  somehow i managed to setup my rigs without asking stupid questions on reddit . 
  someone ca n't find out hash rate of rx570 and it 's retail price without being spoon fed ? 
  yes , fuck them . 
   i do n't know about people mining with 1 gpu and claiming they 're experts, 
  i believe it is a majority of people on this sub . 
  many are trying to `` look smart '' while even not understanding basic concepts such as difficulty . 
  or have you not seen comments like `` difficulty is always going up despite network hash rate , in 1 month it will be unprofitable '' ? 
   but i have seen you say it more than once - that 's pretty annoying, 
  yes , i said it in 2 threads . 
  compare that to the daily `` mining is going to die next week '' circle jerk driven by the `` mainstream opinion '' hivemind . 
  what is more annoying ? 
   mining is becoming less and less profitable as the difficulty goes up ( not helped by the price fall and all the recent sideways movement ) . 
   that is indisputable, 
  really ? 
  it is more profitable today than it was in april . 
  in april i was mining around 1 eth a day = ~ $ 50 . 
  today i am mining 0.38 eth a day = $ 92 . 
  twice more despite the difficulty increase ( thanks to the price increase ) . 
  i am not counting on the future price - it was profitable 3 months ago , it is profitable today , likely will be profitable tomorrow . 
   by today 's prices , you 're making just over half today of what you made per day at the start of june . 
  if that 's not a drop in profitability , i do n't know what is .
