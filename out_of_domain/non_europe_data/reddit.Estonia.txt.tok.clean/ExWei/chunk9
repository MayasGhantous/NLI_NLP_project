  if compare to the start of june - yes , today 's profit is lower . 
  if compare to the february ( as your graph shows ) , or the previous year - no , today 's profit is higher . 
   for people getting into mining now , they 've missed all of that glorious early action , ridiculously low difficulties by today 's standards through 2016 and up until about april before things started taking off . 
  neither i or you know for sure whether is it missed or no . 
  we can only guess what will be difficulty and price in 1 year . 
  look at the old threads from bitcointalk - from 2012 or 2013 . 
  everyone was saying `` missed all of that glorious early action '' - it turned out that they were just in time . 
  probably , today ether mining is still just the beginning ( just like it was with bitcoin/litecoin ) ? 
  [ look at this great article about bitcoin adoption and its price ] ( https://medium.com/@mcasey0827/speculative-bitcoin-adoption-price-theory-2eed48ecf7da ) . 
  i think it has a great point . 
  i bet you are not glad that you did not buy them back in the 2016 or 2015 . 
  tbh a bank sepa transaction fee would not be higher than 0.3 $ . 
  so the real advantage there is that ethereum is not bound to a nation borders . 
  * < look at username  * so who is a retard now ? 
  good for you . 
  better sell your gpus now , it is already unprofitable . 
  trust me i know things i have old gtx 550 . 
  only if it is laptop edition . 
  it is not long . 
  compare it to the other investing options . 
  \\  minima, 
  dwarfpool is an old pool and it is definitely not a scam . 
  it just sometimes has issues . 
  it would be pointless for dwarfpool to do a exit scam since they are already earning a fee and it outweighs the possible exit scam gains . 
  it happens relatively often with dwarfpool .

  i never heard of infobus , but i used luxexpress and ecolines and they were very good . 
  buy high sell low.that 's the most popular ( and therefore the best ) strategy . 
   hitler pool, 
  i heard it has a lot of gas ... for transactions , of course . 
  are you still fuding ? 
  you every comment here is a fud . 
  the keys that are being sold for $ 15 are illegal oem keys . 
   `` if the law is to allow the minimum cost of cryptocurrency transactions in russia , this step will be the springboard for the takeoff of the russian economy , '', 
  could not think of any more bs than this . 
  also , the internet blockings , which are common in russia . 
  surely it is going to work fine / s. 
  a hard wallet would not prevent it , it was a multisig code error . 
  i thought you meant a paper wallet , since it is possibly to generate a wallet in parity and then print it 's . json file and use it is as a paper ( or `` cold '' ) wallet , therefore even if the original parity software installation is removed , the vulnerability would be still there . 
  so you are right then - a ledger nano s is safe since it does not use the same code for the multisig wallet creation as parity does . 
  i think if you change some . linkflairlabel class properties to :, 
  height : auto ;, 
  top : auto ;, 
  then it will work correctly . 
  you are not have to use geth if you are using a pool for mining . 
  if you use pool for mining , you can use anything as a wallet - an exchange , geth , parity , trezor , anything . 
  therefore , are not have to sync anything by default but if you want to use geth as a wallet , then you have to . 
  geth -- light sync will work but in my case it was very slow despite the `` light '' parameter . 
  in my case , i switched to [ parity ] ( https://parity.io/ ) and it got synced up in minutes . 
   was n't parity just hacked ? 
  only multisig wallet was `` hacked '' because it 's code had a bug . 
  the same way a paper wallet could get `` hacked '' if you would screw it like parity did with multisig wallets . 
   when i first looked around for a desktop wallet , this web browser based walled just stink like a month old fish . 
  in retro perspective i am glad i never used it . 
  it adds a nice chrome integration for signing , really useful with e.g. 
  eos ico or on exchanges like https://etherdelta.github.io . 
   `` mist '' or `` my ethereum wallet '' is better then this javascript-browser based wallet , imho . 
  if you do not use a hardware wallet , one day `` my ehtereum wallet '' webserver can get hacked and your funds would be stolen . 
  it ca n't happen to parity since it is a local installation . 
  you ca n't damage a video card unless :, 
  a ) you increase voltage, 
  b ) you let it overheat ( more than 90c for a long time ), 
  i have 41 gpus ( 6 of them are nvidia gtx 1070 , others are amd ) and my screen was getting blank , black , frozen , etc countless times when i was trying different overclocking settings . 
  9.35 mh/s is very low . 
  i do not have 1080ti but there https://www.nicehash.com/?p=calc you can see that it has 35 mh/s on average . 
  my gtx 1070 overclock parameters ( offsets ) are :, 
  core - 120mhz, 
  memory - 1300mhz, 
  i use linux though . 
  i know there is some setting on windows in the nvidia control panel like `` optimize for computing '' that also should increase nvidia hashrate . 
  i am using https://simplemining.net/ loaded on a usb drive . 
  i am not sure if it makes sense with just one gpu ( due to costs of a usb drive and profitability of one gpu ) . 
  cpu does not matter for mining , i have cheapest 40eur cpus in my mining rigs and just 4gb of ram . 
  if you do not want to use a special os ( https://simplemining.net/ ) for mining ( does not make sense with just one gpu ) , then i think you should use nvidia 's `` optimize for compute performance '' function https://www.reddit.com/r/ethermining/comments/66cc99/old_news_nvidia_control_panel_optimize_for/ . 
  it should increase hashrate , but i never used it personally ( since i use linux only ) . 
  you could also try to gradually overclock it ( like in increments of 100 mhz for memory and 10mhz for core ) . 
  you could also try to overvolt gpu but it can destroy it ( so do not do it ) . 
  also it is very important to watch for gpu temperature and your psu should have enough power . 
  $ 10k - $ 50k ? 
  i am sure it will be more like $ 1k - $ 5k, 
  i can agree . 
  i have two acs in a room about 45m2 and one opened window outperforms them all . 
  where i am it is 21c * ( about 70f ) * at day and 12c * ( about 50f ) * at night ... only nice for mining . 
  nah , they just watched a short 30 seconds video on youtube and now they are experts on the subject , just like majority of journalists nowadays . 
  usually risers require a molex connector , therefore you need a molex cable . 
  there are also adapters like 6pin to molex or sata to molex ( sata to molex is not recommended ) . 
  yeah but in reality you will end up with banned github and and linkedin . 
  like it happened before . 
  fyi there is a thing called `` freedom of speech '' , i believe it has something to do with `` other delicate content '' and restrictions regarding it . 
   i see / u/exwei states it is not recommended but i have seen multiple rigs with it and i myself have never had issues doing it either . 
  some molex to sata cables are ok and some are not ok ( because of low chinese quality and bad manufacturing process ) . 
  some got rigs or houses burned thanks to them . 
  here are some examples from the past that did not go well :,
