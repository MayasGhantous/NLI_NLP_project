  although this lineup is not set in stone either . 
  meanwhile the trio that left ( bzz , general and yol ) played for `` teamless '' in esl open quals . 
  they did , that is true . 
  but sqreen changes his teammates as often as his socks ( probably not true ) . 
  ** 4asc ** dropped out of hitbox eu championship . 
  pls . 
  noooo . 
  noooo . 
  source ? 
  should have added / s to the post i guess . 
  what op said has been known for a week at least and is in the main post already . 
  ** arcade.powerrangers ** have registered bignum ( and jackal , j4 , chshrct , ditya ra ) instead of gorec for majors , which seems like a downgrade to me . 
  has gorec found a better team for himself ? 
  if that is true then they are most likely 4cl ( or a successor of that team ) , since bamboe and egm never really left it when others did and the team itself was invited to gaming paradise . 
  then either stop visiting sites that might cause an issue at work or get a boss who does n't burst into flames if ( s ) he sees a 10px butt on a computer screen . 
  this one is easy . 
  danish bears win since they have a 5-man lineup . 
  can you fucking tl ; dr your fucking comment you fucking fuckwit ? 
  were far from 100 % record now , considering the season here started in march , but n\u00f5mme kalju started with 9 wins . 
  i demand an apology from sky sports #ssn # 9wins #justice #podolski #aha, 
  fuckingmad 's stack mcr made it to the next round . 
  sing fangays 4head, 
  7mad was playing with kebap and his buddies in the second qualifier already . 
  tbf those three grand finals have nothing to do with the current secret roster . 
  might as well compare eg with the old c9 . 
  doubt it . 
  yoky wants to play mid and he would not be able to do it in navi . 
  yoky will join sqreen 's stack . 
  general left sfz long before he joined empire . 
  because the post is about am taking a nap and not about the op 's username . 
  so amazing that you just need to reupload it to your own channel in youtube ? 
  according to him obviously . 
  all he does is reuploads tracks with millions of views on youtube to his channel and posts them here . 
  no logic ( excalibur , mitch , thecoon , milan and zeroji ) is going to be there as well for sure . 
  what about empire though ? 
  was this alohadance thing a joke or not ? 
  empire recently withdrew from ucc europe and the announcement by the ucc mentioned `` recent changes in composition '' although that might have been mistranslated when using google . 
  they swapped masakary for thecoon after the deadline . 
  tbf they lost to sockshka , funzii , rvp + 2 who have been playing together for a month now . 
  so not a huge shocker considering burden just got together a few days ago . 
  dante on the receiving end again . 
  got ta feel for the man . 
  those two games you mentioned were from the eu qualifiers which are hosted by faceit . 
  not sure how it works there , but i would n't expect those games to be ticketed since they are kinda not part of the main tournament . 
  and as mtbadtoss already said , all six games that have been played by now were all ticketed . 
  [ do n't lie ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/search?q=singsing&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month ), 
  translation :, 
   official : do n't believe rumors !, 
  @funn1kdota does not leave @team_empire . 
  v1lat was left, 
  milan might not be part of this stack considering he tweeted '' [ freeagent ] ( https://twitter.com/milandota2/status/707001191516020736 ) '' yesterday . 
  black , nikobaby , thecoon , milan and buugi will play under the no logic gaming banner in epicenter quals, 
  but op did not say he 's gon na random disruptor before the first roll . 
  thus the first roll is irrelevant . 
  vanskor , black , buugi , jonassomfan and shak playing as team `` avengers '' in wellplay invitational qualifier tonight . 
  `` omen challenge '' , something to do with smite, 
  [ alan walker - fade ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7sz5sbzyy ), 
  you know what 's even better ? 
  just linking to the source video on youtube . 
  asus rog has nothing to do with dreamleague this season . 
  blocked in estonia as well . 
  [ music video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrx5praludy ) on ultra records ' channel is not though . 
  mirrors of that video are n't blocked either . 
  and the song is available on [ spotify ] ( https://open.spotify.com/track/05gc0ksxbowszzapriwfxj ) as well . 
  i do n't really care if this particular video is blocked here , but ffs sony do n't just block one video for shits and giggles . 
  broodmothers ( relaxxx , skanks , keyzer , ill and focus ) is a stable roster in eu . 
  they have n't really won anything , but they 've been around the scene playing in small tournaments all the time . 
  considering there are n't many stable teams , them getting an invite to closed quals is n't perhaps too far fetched . 
  people have already pointed out that despite being a stable roster they did n't register their team before the roster lock . 
  mouz is gon na sign danish bears . 
  ad finem itself is already a growing organization with teams in multiple games . 
  not that it really matters but there 's not gon na be any original content on a `` fails lmfao '' channel , everyone knows that . 
  op was aware . 
  did n't really like how the voting was integrated into their shop , but always happy to see new teams and especially players at an international lan . 
  gratz to beesa , cc&c , mjw , fronz and stan king . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yes , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ beesa ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ playing ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ carry . 
  why would anyone buy it from ebay though if one could get it from the official provider for the same price ? 
  what circle ? 
  the poster in the video had october in it . 
  gs starts on 3rd , main even starts on 8th ( ? ), 
  if i remember correctly . 
  how about you stop posting links to your `` tips '' site , m8 ? 
  how about using search function next time then ? 
  interesting news tend to get posted instantly when official sources publish them ( not that you 'd care ) . 
  is there a list of who casts what this year ? 
  would be nice to know if someone wanted to avoid certain casters . 
  10am local is the start time of the broadcast , not the time of the first game . 
  maybe they 've said otherwise on stream , but that 's what the dota2 website says . 
  who 's the other estonian pro ? 
  yes please . 
  kang has been playing instead of zacky for wgu since ti . 
  have n't seen anything official about it though , not that i 've ever looked for it . 
  he was removed from mineski-x 's team on the roster change page . 
  he is also part of the ingame team if that means anything . 
  you mean early august , right ? 
  rodjer is all tagged up in current flipsid3 v e-lab game . 
  seems like they swapped him for mettpum . 
  everything can be viable in 2-3k . 
  serious or not , but prodota gaming and prodota.eu are not the same thing . 
  they are banned from the open tournament .
