  but there 's also a 50k mpgl tournament there with the best teams from sea . 
  controlled, 
  camps do n't belong to teams . 
  also , stop picking jungle lc , then you do n't have this problem any more . 
  yes , op just lost against gyro . 
  e : gyro did 6k damage with maxed rocket barrage . 
  meanwhile storm did 5.9 k with remnants and you did 4.7 k with dragon slave as a colossaly underleveled lina . 
  might as well buff rocket barrage according to this match . 
  if storm was playing for the other team he could have hid in the trees just like gyro . 
  zip , vortex , remnant and you 'd be back at the fountain before you could even blink an eye . 
  it 's just you being out of position and way underleveled . 
  and whether or not a skill is owerpowered should be left for icefrog to decide . 
  why the do they call it `` 2017 '' roster ? 
  it 's still gon na be 2016 for another 4 months . 
  jesus fucking christ this triggers me so hard for no reason . 
  i better not see them playing together in 2016 or else ... 
  games are already ongoing while the website shows that group stage starts on 9 october ( `` coming soon ! '' ) . 
  time to update that section . 
  e : also there seems to be two groups , one is ending tonight by the looks of it but what about the second one ? 
  there is no info anywhere . 
  i realize that a lot of smaller tournaments rely on sites like jd and gosu for schedules and news articles but in my opinion there 's no reason for an organizer to purely fall back to those sites . 
  take advantage of the social media/offical homepage to keep people updated on any news about the competition . 
  looking at the teams of group b on liquipedia i 'd imagine that those games are postponed due to wesg ? 
  if so again let people know about the new schedule , etc. 
  good luck with the tournament . 
  this might come as a surprise for many players but there actually is a way . 
  reporting her for intentional feeding which leads to low priority games is a perfect punishment here . 
  what time does the first match actually start ? 
  * [ gosu shows 08:30 cest ] ( http://www.gosugamers.net/dota2/tournaments/12315-wesg-europe-and-cis-lan/3459-group-stage/12316-group-a/matches/143295-team-denmark-vs-necroraisers ), 
  * [ jd shows 09:30 cest ] ( http://www.joindota.com/en/matches/211230-team-denmark-vs-necroraisers ), 
  * [ liquipedia shows 07:30 cest ( 08:30 eest ) ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/world_electronic_sports_games/2016/europe_cis ), 
  * [ official site shows 08:30 but does n't specify timezone ] ( http://int.wesg.com/en/europe-cis/matches/5267 ), 
  `` biggest '' eu teams that are in the second na qual right now are :, 
  * solidudes ( micke , insania , masakary , sealkid , solitude ), 
  * evil corporation aka rip kaipi ( chaoly , buch , nox , tolera , ownedme ), 
  * jebaited/thinking ( blazemon , charlie , jabbz , mawi , wagamama ), 
  solitudes lost to some random dread stack , jebaited to comanche in ro32 . 
  evil corporation lost to f5 in ro16 . 
  solitudes might actually get themselves into the final if they play well , doubt about chances of the other two . 
  1st place got to chose from 3rd-4th . 
  and vp picked liquid . 
  trixi hype !, 
  so you 're saying that we should put all our money on vp to beat fl @ summit 6 ? 
  but vp with is playing in boston as well . 
  not sure how likely is it for these two to avoid meeting each other in the bracket though . 
  why bother hiding names in the screenshot if your reddit username = steam name ? 
  and yes , i 've got nothing better to do . 
  has liquid confirmed that gh will stand in this time ? 
  i know he has been playing with the team recently , but have n't seen an official confirmation for dreamleague finals . 
  you are not even the first one to make that `` lul karmawhoring '' / new post . 
  lottery winners ? 
  lycan is not in cm tho . 
  does anyone know the format in gs ? 
  are games bo1 or bo2 ? 
  forfiet = / = disqualified, 
  bbc one and fox sports are buffering multiple times in a minute . 
  sky sports 3 stream not online at all . 
  better hope it 's not earth spirit if liquid plans to play in the final, 
  5k for a single bo5 is not bad at all . 
  lq is funnik , lolik_o , scandal , sunlight and yol according to faceit, 
  yes, 
  eu already has 3 directly invited teams , while sea has none . 
  1/80 chance so it 's unlikely to happen . 
  artstyle was zeus, 
  what happens to the old penta team ( maden , tmw , radek , kaht , s1d ) ? 
  so he ca n't smurf in ranked now . 
  literally . 
  babyknight 's recent vlog sheds some light :, 
  no way that 31 min shortest match is correct . 
  dc lost final game against fnatic in like 20 mins . 
  surely the whole np squad will make an appearance on their off day . 
  and so will bulba , dendi and pedro . 
   when forev left secret , puppey should have considered him for the offlane, 
  pld said in an interview ( one of his last in secret 's shirt , ca n't remember which exactly though ) that they were considering 33 , but khezu ended up with them instead . 
  schedule is out : http://www.marslive.cn/index.php?g=portal&amp;m=article&amp;a=index&amp;id=222, 
  is this channel gon na show six bts series tournaments that were never streamed ? 
  the original announcement in 2015 said that there will be 18 tournaments in the next year , but only 12 actually happened . 
  did you guys just pocket $ 60k that was not paid out for the missing tournaments , kappa ? 
  silent played only 3 heroes, 
  ft was a draw as well . 
  ddk ? 
  current csgo caster who used to play quake, 
  they all knew that the final was going to be an offline event . 
  source : sing was streaming qualifiers . 
  oq # 1 was played on 11 july . 
  ca n't be bothered to look for a stream link though . 
  i 'm sure you can find it yourself . 
  would n't be surprising if 33 replaces khezu . 
  he was already looked at last year by secret . 
  really solid player and deserves better than hellraisers . 
  considering secret 's first choices declined ( high profile players like kpii and s4 ? ), 
  then he 's imo odds on favorite here . 
  another option is ghostik , can speak english and does n't really have an option for a better team in cis region . 
  swift didnt get visa so benhur was playing instead, 
  how is liquipedia an official source for yamateh 's stack ? 
  i get that they do n't usually have wrong info , but they do n't really have a source for that lineup either, 
  i 'm not saying they are not playing together , i 'm just questioning the source . 
  how does a random liquipedia article without a citation confirm that they are actually playing together though ? 
  there 's no reason to believe that they are not playing together as there 's no reason for liquipedia editors to just add false information , but without an actual source that player list holds as much credibility as lgdamefan reddit posts . 
  i might be pedantic here and i 'm sure hardly anyone actually cares about a tier 2 sea friends stack for a qualifier , but that team should not be in the confirmed/official list as long as there 's no official confirmation from the players .
