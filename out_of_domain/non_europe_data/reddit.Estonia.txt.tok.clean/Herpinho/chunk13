  also , they did indeed qualify with that five man lineup according to [ met malaysia 's facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/mineskieventsteammalaysia/photos/a.159818430867463.1073741828.159430530906253/846740808841885/?type=3&amp;theater ) . 
  that 's an actual source for that lineup , but it still does n't really make it official as it 's nothing more than an open qualifier team at the moment . 
  those positions are wrong though , topson was playing a core role for them . 
  i 'm not saying they are not playing together , i 'm just questioning the source . 
  the keeper had an eye on the ball prior to the kick . 
  he is just behind # 17 and can actually see the ball . 
  but when the goalscorer started moving , the wall moved to the right at the same time , thus blocking the keeper 's view making it impossible for him to react . 
  ( the camera is on the left side from the other goal as net posts are not aligned properly ), 
  again , i 'm not questioning whether they play together or not . 
  i 'm just saying that the current source ( liquipedia articele ) does not in any way confirm that they play together . 
  just because someone in liquipedia has written down the correct list of players without an actual reference to the fact , does n't make it a valid enough source . 
  met malaysia 's facebook post makes it a fact ( or any other source that has something to do with the actual team ) . 
  third party site ( in this case the liqupedia `` source '' ) with no reference might as well be just a rumor . 
  would you blindly believe liquipedia with no source provided , if it says that dendi is now playing for eg ? 
  i 'm a bit late to the party , but op is an asshole . 
   ca n't give my source, 
  so literally not confirmed . 
  just as stupid as `` confirming '' leaks . 
  let 's assume it 's all pick , no bans , first random by orange was also first overall pick . 
  * player 1 randoms a hero ( beastmaster in this case ) . 
  does n't matter which hero yet so it 's a sure bet your gon na get a hero when you click that random button ( 112/112 = 100 % ), 
  * player 1 re-randoms , which has no effect other than taking one hero away from the pick pool ( 111 heroes left ) . 
  * player 2 randoms oracle , which has no effect other than taking another hero off the list ( 110 left ) . 
  * player 3 randoms same hero as player 1 previously . 
  that 's one specific hero from 110 that are left in the pool -- 1/110 = 0.91 %, 
  * player 3 re-randoms , which again only makes the pool smaller ( 109 left ) . 
  * player 4 randoms same hero as player 1 and player 3 previously -- 1/109 = 0.92 %, 
  so its 112/112 * 1/110 * 1/109 = 0.00834 % = ** 1 in 11990 **, 
  if there was a guy saying at the start that they 're all going to random beastmaster that would change the first random to a specific hero as well , which would be 1/112 , thus :, 
  not pulling out of something is not reward worthy though . 
  sfte also beat og . 
  maybe they can poach fly ? 
  that is 11 scored and 192 conceeded in 36 matches ( 0.31 and 5.33 per match ) . 
  i smell a record here . 
  can anyone find a team with worse performance in top flight ? 
  [ league table ] ( http://jalgpall.ee/league.php?b=ml&page_id=30&year=2011 ), 
  so i was just browsing through football articles in wikipedia and stumpled upon indonesian leagues . 
  there 's indonesian premier league that is run by the football federation . 
  then there is indonesia super league run by pt liga indonesia . 
  finally , liga indonesia premier division , which itself is divided into two : one is run by pt liga prima indonesia sportindo and the other by pt liga indonesia . 
  by the looks of it , some clubs play in multiple competitions . 
  and then my head exploaded . 
  all in all i found four `` top division '' season articles :, 
  * [ 2011 -- 12 indonesian premier league ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011\u201312_indonesian_premier_league ), 
  * [ 2011 -- 12 liga indonesia premier division \\ ( li \\ ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%e2%80%9312_liga_indonesia_premier_division_%28li%29 ), 
  * [ 2011 -- 12 liga indonesia premier division \\ ( lpis \\ ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%e2%80%9312_liga_indonesia_premier_division_%28lpis%29 ), 
  * [ 2011 -- 12 indonesia super league ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%e2%80%9312_indonesian_super_league ), 
  none of these articles look like a hoax , so is there anyone who can explain what 's going on there ? 
  there are currently 53 nations that play under uefa , this means france will be the 52nd and final piece in the puzzle , as estonia can not play itself . 
  both associations confimed the friendly today , so it 's a done deal . 
  unless ofcourse by that time uefa has added another association to their union . 
  i 'm wondering what other countries are close to getting it . 
  i guess bigger countries , that have existed since the dawn of football , should be close . 
  but on the other hand many new associations have joined uefa in the last 20 years and i doubt the powerhouses have had the chance to play occasional low level opponents between their money-making friendlies with other big nations . 
  could there have been a team with that milestone before the 90s ? 
  edit, 
  fifa confirms the record in making :, 
  first of all the song : [ the funeral by band of horses ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmfwfhtfohk ) . 
  the movie was mostly a one-man work , at least most of it . 
  as the song was first released in 2006 , the movie itself can not be older , but it 's possible the movie is not even released yet as it was declined by many festivals as i recall . 
  the animation and look seemed like if it was done in flash , but more detailed . 
  i can not really remember much of it plot-wise . 
  the protagonist had a problem getting close to his love interest for some reason . 
  and i think the it took place in a kingdom . 
  if i remember correctly , the clip is from a infantry documentary in which around 20 men took part in an extreme endurance training . 
  / solved, 
  ** tl ; dr ** i calculated the likely-hood of each team in starladder 11 eu+cis division getting a place in the lan finals . 
  i 'm bored and i 've been watching a lot of starladder games in the last week and it 's been fun seeing such a close fight . 
  tomorrow is the last day and there are still six teams remaining in the competition for the four eu+cis slots . 
  especially happy about the possibility of seeing new teams in action . 
  i used the article in [ liquipedia ] ( http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/star_ladder_star_series/season_11/europe_and_cis ) and i really hope they did n't have any mistakes in there while i was doing this . 
  blah-blah-blah , lets get to the point . 
  so the table looks like this at the moment . 
  secret , hr and polar have all played their games , while the other three have cards still in their own hands . 
  secret 11-4, 
  polar 11-4, 
  empire 10-3, 
  and there are still three games left to be played , which means we can have eight different outcomes . 
  empire v lajons, 
  i 'm not gon na bring out all eight different scenarios , since there 's not much to talk about them individually . 
  check the [ doc in pastebin ] ( http://pastebin.com/hhcrnz9e ) if you want to see more details . 
  but i 'm gon na bring up one which i will call * v1lat 's nightmare * . 
  if pr wins both games tomorrow and empire beats lajons then there will be a six-way tie at 11-4 !, 
  and as their weird `` personal advantage '' system would not determine any clear winners or losers , the teams would have to play additional 15 games ( 5 each ) . 
  yummy !, 
  also if lajons wins both their games and pr beats empire , then there will not be any tiebreakers , but that 's not gon na happen , right ? 
  right ? 
  let 's rather talk about teams and their chances . 
  ** lajons ( 7 qualified , 1 tiebreaker and 0 eliminated scenarios \u2248 95.8 % ) ** is sitting at the top at the moment and , not surprisingly , is most likely to qualify . 
  only way they could be out is if the six-way tie happens and the team drops out in the tiebreaker . 
  otherwise they are guaranteed a place in kiev . 
  ** hellraisers , polar , secret ( 2-6-0 \u2248 75 % ) ** all sit at the same score already and as their own little three-way is dead even at one win each as well , they ca n't be separated anyhow . 
  they can still all qualify if empire loses both games , but a tiebreaker between those three teams is most likely . 
  ** empire ( 5-1-2 \u2248 70.8 % ) ** is still at a great place to qualify . 
  if the team loses both games it 's out , but if they win at least one , they are guaranteed a place in ukraine unless v1lat 's nightmare happens . 
  there would be a lot of four-way ties at 11-4 with the trio above , but as empire beat them all , they would escape the tiebreakers . 
  ** pr ( 0-1-7 \u2248 8.3 % ) ** is out unless they win both and hope for that empire beats lajons and forces a six-way tie . 
  11-4 does n't look so bad at first , but out of those four losses three were against hr , polar and secret who happen to be at a fixed 11-4 already . 
  and pr would lose out in the tiebreaker because of that . 
  linked right to the start of the track .
