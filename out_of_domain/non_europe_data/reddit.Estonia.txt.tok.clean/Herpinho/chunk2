  i would n't really say he 's a good enough for the national team at the moment , but if he gets to play in a better league again he might get another chance in a few seasons as our current top three cbs are all over 30 . 
  we 've had four different keepers for the position . 
  londak , kotenko , aksalu and current no1 pareiko . 
  currently aksalu is out of the contention , as he has yet to play for sheffield united in the league , even though its his third season there . 
  kotenko , who played for viking fk in 2009-10 , has finally found a club in azerbaijan where he gets play time , but has made many mistakes there already and his future in the nt does n't look good . 
  so that leaves londak and pareiko . 
  and frankly , the wisla krakow keeper has been one of our best players in the recent seasons . 
  there 's also a 19-year-old vitesse keeper marko meerits , who looks promising . 
  pavel is our second best keeper right now , but i do n't really think he has a chance for the first choice again . 
  actually they do n't . 
  with the money they have , they should be far-far ahead of everyone else , but somehow they are n't . 
  eleven actually . 
  these are not mentioned here yet . 
  a weekly show called * sportschau * covers bundesliga . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; i only saw 2 goals in the stoppage time . 
  so who 's gon na take the next freekick ? 
  mertesacker ? 
  george burford, 
  you probably misunderstood it completely as xp has nothing to do with who you get to play in head to head seasons . 
  division and the team 's star rating are the factors , as you said it yourself . 
  footytorrents has all their epl and cl matches from this season in hd . 
  europe here , everything seems fine . 
  ereption . 
  it 's okay . 
  estonia took 10 points in the group when they were trailing by one . 
  it 's the flag of jalgpallihaigla , supporters group for the team . 
  feels like every time keane has his hands up , the ref has his hand up as well , with a card in it . 
  although it 's 4-0 to ireland , i do n't see them doing much in the euros the next summer . 
  bad defending and dubious decisions by the referee got them the result . 
  why is keane celebrating after losing the ball every time ? 
  you silly man , lower your hands . 
  only four more !, 
  [ ufwc history dates back to 1872 , 58 years before the world cup . 
  the very first international football match was played between scotland and england on 30 november 1872 . 
  the score was a rather unexciting 0-0 . 
  on 8 march 1873 , england and scotland played again . 
  england won 4-2 , and became the very first unofficial football world champions . 
  ] ( http://www.ufwc.co.uk/about/ufwc-frequently-asked-questions/#2 ), 
  basically if it 's between two `` a '' national teams , it counts as a title match . 
  friendlies included . 
  that hair . 
  i have n't heard anything . 
  he gets $ 7 per week , so he surely ca n't be a rich guy , unless something-something . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ykma9.jpg ) + [ stats ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ilw9w.jpg ) , but as you can see he will join peterborough ( for $ 425k , which will double my club 's balance ) . 
  so next on the line is [ this guy ] ( http://i.imgur.com/u3hgo.jpg ) + [ stats ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jyvjk.jpg ) , but he is also on his way out , for free . 
  after that ... 
  i do n't know . 
  they were my best players by far . 
  thinking about the upcoming season in league two makes me shiver . 
  [ this user has all the us episodes on youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/user/raezeman ), 
  hurling and gaelic football . 
  when a new game arrives , i always start with arsenal to fill that empty cabinet at the emirates . 
  it usually takes 3-4 years to win every trophy at least once . 
  after that i go for the `` english hero '' achievement . 
  estonia, 
  free willy . 
  barca got bayer leverkusen , not basel . 
  [ aleksandrs cekulajevs ] ( http://www.soccerway.com/players/aleksandrs-cekulajevs/52759/ ) scored 46 in 35 league games this season . 
  the joke 's on you . 
  it 's only $ 2.11 / liter . 
  you seem surprised . 
  care to explain a little more ? 
  mr bean came ? 
  if the second half of the season goes the same way the first one did , they will qualify for relegation play-offs and possibly retain their place in super league . 
  lausanne 's 11 +11 = 22p, 
  wow , i have n't pirated any of the top pc games , own crysis 2 and fifa 12 on origin , and portal 2 on steam . 
  these movies are n't even out on dvd/blu-ray yet . 
  but who would exactly feature in this squad from estonia then ? 
  vassiljev surely ca n't beat eriksen , kvist or rasmus elm . 
  pareiko ? 
  not a chance . 
  the only estonian i would consider for this dream team is klavan , as i have n't seen boilesen play . 
  but still , having seen how often klavan makes silly mistakes on the pitch , i 'm farely sure there has to be someone better than him . 
  avoided a red and then scored the winner . 
  luckpard . 
  fulham also had only a day between the games . 
  the pass was fine , the goalkeeping ... not so fine . 
  is it possible that chelsea are in the european final and therefore can become the last english entry as title holders ? 
  this would render their fa cup win useless and the cup runner-up ( lower placed team ) would take their el place , thus leaving arsenal out of cl and you out of el . 
  will do it when i get back home from work . 
  hopefully he will do better than previous two ( or even three , ca n't quite recall ) that had short spells at the club . 
  i would n't be surprised c. ronaldo he was hired by mourinho , who took the club over after i left around 2015 . 
  edit :, 
  [ so i made some screenshots ] ( http://imgur.com/a/zkosk#1 ), 
  c. ronaldo retired as a player after 2020-21 season and soon became a youth coach at fulham . 
  and then , after a year , he moved to arsenal . 
  in 2023 he would be 38 . 
  i vaguely remember him finishing his career at rm , so that would mean he could have retired in summer 2022 . 
  37 is n't that young , as most of my own players have retired much earlier . 
  he joined arsenal in 2015 winter transfer window for $ 47.5 m and played there until the end of 2020-21 season . 
  what a bad deal it was : averaged 20 matches and 5 goals in the league . 
  behind walcott , hulk and a brazilian regen in the pecking order , at least it looks like that way when checking best elevens from that time . 
  after that played one season for old boys in argentinian nacional b ( ! ), 
  and then retired and joined sunderland as a youth coach . 
  maybe mou just brought him to london because he could , not that he needed him . 
  but his avg rating dropped gradually in years . 
  at first it was over 8 at barca , peaking at 8.73 in 2012-13 season . 
  in the last 2 seasons there it dropped to 7.7 and his play time was also considerably smaller . 
  at arsenal he 's best was 7.43 in the second season , but was as low as 6.67 in 2019-20 . 
  or maybe the team just lacked his needed xavi & co.
