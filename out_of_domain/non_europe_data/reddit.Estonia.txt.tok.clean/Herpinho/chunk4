  nice to see there 's a player in estonia called buffalo 's grave ( a. b\u00fcffelgrab ) . 
  or actually not , the real player is alo b\u00e4rengrub . 
  sucks that the estonian names are just meaningless gibberish . 
  and even the english teams do n't have ** every single kit ** available on the site . 
   who the fuck is bilbao when we have london !, 
  ftfy, 
  and are they 20 or 50 ?

  why was such a big stadium built there anyway ? 
  as i understand the town itself has a population of only 100,000 .

  oh wait ... he retired a few years ago and we did not qualify,

  no it 's not . 
  they only played 70 minutes in this match . 
  that 's not how you draw satan !, 
  i see your swedish division 6 match and raise you estonian top division match between kuressaare and kalju . 
  the match ended 2:3 , but was eventually marked down as - : - . 
  home team subbed in a banned player ( one match ban for collecting 3 yellows for the reserve team ) . 
  the away team also had a banned player on the field ( new signing from lower league team , who did n't have time to serve his ban there ) . 
  they also had 4 non-eu players on the field for a five minute period ( 3 at a time are allowed at most ) . 
  there have been 4-5 similar cases in recent years here . 
  one time a team gave away a 6:0 win . 
  in the highest division of the country ( ! ) . 
  how hard can it be ? 
  1 , 2 , ... erm ? 
  come on italy , do it !, 
  i dare you !!, 
  he is . 
  he 's been with the squad as a coach since his retirement . 
  although i doubt anyone cares , we actually play the usual 4-4-2 : ojamaa/oper up front , puri/kink on the wings and dmitrijev/vassiljev in the middle . 
  foreign tv channels get them wrong quite often . 
  but it 's not like they can take it from todaysformations.com , is it ? 
  who cares again , but saag is # 20 . 
  and how did we still manage to miss when all french attacking players stayed on the other side of the field . 
  pretty good refereeing in my opinion . 
  giroud was wrongly called offside a few minutes ago , but can not recall any other incident . 
  on behalf of estonia , fuck you republic of ireland !, 
  cunts !!, 
  mom , did i do it right ? 
  time for new caledonia to make the switch to afc . 
  where i get polish version ?

  this bizarre campaign was pretty much our only hope to get to a major tournament in ... ever . 
  the transfer window has n't opened yet , thus he is still with k\u00f6ln .

  six teams get a world cup spot .

  what he really means is that there is n't a single europa league match today . 
  the inevitable happened . 
  better team won . 
  that # 22 is coquelin , right ? 
  no , leave jenkinson out of it !, 
  ninja turtles !, 
  so that 's where all those g4s guards are training for the olympics . 
  i think i 'm gon na win this one . 
  cup and el qualifying matches included , so about 20 home matches per season , which makes it roughly 1,5 $ per match . 
  as i ca n't go to most of the matches due to work i just use their facebook 's `` attend '' discount for each match , which is half the price of the original 5 $ . 
  hey , niels de ruiter , to hide your name in screenshots change your nickname [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aygkd.png ) on your manager 's profile page . 
  the way you say it , i can see you have n't noticed arsenal is on their moneygrab tour . 
  hate it , but i do n't listen to this kind of music anyway . 
  i 'm likely late for the party , but why does arsenal have 2 fa cups in this picture ? 
  why not have all 10 ?
