  ] ( / spoiler ), 
  and eventually the package is returned to the original man 's house . 
  [ this has nothing to do with the answer ] ( / spoiler ), 
  the package contains a human arm with a tattoo on it . 
  [ so that people could identify the arm , ok , i see the point ] ( / spoiler ), 
  a woman with one arm goes to the man 's house . 
  she rings the doorbell and the man answers the door . 
  [ so the man obviously knew who the woman was , why did he open the door ? 
  especially if she had a gun ] ( / spoiler ), 
  the woman takes one look at the man and shoots him . 
  why did she do this ? 
  [ what a bitch ] ( / spoiler ), 
  i would n't contradict the original story if i said that the man was forced by some people to cut off the woman 's arm and then went for a road trip to show the evidence , but the woman followed him and killed everybody he visited and eventually the man himself as well . 
  he just threw the ball further away from himself so he could make a run and quickly kick it to his striker . 
  he obviously looks for a target up front and is then surprised by the opponent kicking the ball when he looks at the ball again . 
  nothing unusual about it . 
  i hate him because his name in estonian is poop . 
  literally . 
  [ stu has taken photos of the players ] ( http://www.gettyimages.com/search/search.aspx?assettype=image&amp;artist=stuart+macfarlane ) for arsenal 's website . 
  bendtner and van persie have their last year headshots photoshopped onto [ bfg 's body ] ( http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/per-mertesacker-of-arsenal-poses-for-a-photo-during-the-news-photo/149749417 ) .

  the exact same heads . 
  so they were obviously not at the shoot for whatever reasons . 
  ramsey and park are with their olympic squads , but their pics on [ the first team list ] ( http://www.arsenal.com/first-team/players ) are still from last year . 
  why manipulate their photos if they can just shoot on some other day ? 
  i 'm 180cm/90kg ( 5 `` 11 / ~ 200 ) and my m fits just fine . 
  would be tight for an athletic build with bigger chest . 
  if i was you i 'd go for s , as m would surely look too baggy on you right now . 
  yeah , i would take short-sleeved over long-sleeved anytime .

  njordsjaelland is in the cl , he could play in his home country !, 
  or if copenhagen beats lille in the play-off he could even return to his hometown !, 
  anderlecht would be another option close to london !, 
  ajax has been sucked dry , so another possible destination . 
  i 'm sure all these teams would take him . 
  bad accents by foreign characters who speak their native language in the movie . 
  as i can understand russian , it makes me cringe when someone speaks in russian and gets pretty much every emphasis and pronunciation wrong . 
  especially in big budget movies . 
  it 's not bad , but honestly i do n't care either . 
  on the scale from `` awful '' to `` awesome '' this would be `` meh '' .

  that was close to a 50 pass combo right there . 
  for me it looks like dicaprio in a suit , that 's it . 
  i understand these `` first look '' pictures when they show a superhero or some weird looking character , but this one is just a man in a suit .

  pretty good for a team that disbanded almost four years ago . 
  she is n't missing any , so i assume that she scored ten . 
  estonia -- [ kiiking ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kiiking ), 
  it took him 20 minutes to correct them . 
  furthermore , both clubs had their lineups available long before he even created the thread . 
  otherwise , it 's good that we have active people who try their best . 
  phil is the fourth official in this match , so i guess he can still cause some havok on the sideline . 
  it 's never offsides . 
  the average attendance in estonian premier league ? 
  [ same song on their official channel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tom2dk-rllu ),
