  is that tarmo kuusk any good or is he in the squad because you 're from estonia ? 
  this is surely because of those weird mls transfer fee rules . 
  that title is just plain bad . 
  as people have already pointed out they did n't actually start with 11 youth players , but rather 10 homegrown players plus dani alves . 
  after an injury , he was replaced by tito and only then did barca have a team of 11 homegrown players on the field . 
  for the first time ever . 
  you do n't make any sense ... 
  `` barca plays with a lineup full of home grown players for the first time ever '', 
  simple enough and there 's no bending the truth . 
  though i understand why some people do n't like my remark , it 's basically just like false advertising . 
  words like `` amazing '' , `` fantastic '' and `` golazo '' should be avoided altogether . 
  there are videos of good goals here all the time , mixed with great ones , but hardly any of them are actually amazing . 
  i guess so, 
  drew carey 's improv-a-ganza is not on par with wliia , although it 's funny enough to watch . 
  sadly only 40 episodes were put together . 
  explain like i 'm five . 
  most of the players look nothing like pires anyway . 
  can somebody tell me why this is `` an absolutely fantastic '' goal ? 
  seems like a pretty common shot from outside the box . 
  well placed , no doubt , but shots like these are featured here every other day . 
  nothing special about this one . 
  e : accidentally a, 
  a dull and boring name tallinn should be replaced by kalewipojad ( kalev 's sons , written with w instead on v , as the was the original spelling ) , named after an [ estonian epic ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg ) . 
  and as it 's a custom database anyway , the hometown , tallinn , should be renamed to reval , which was the towns original name before estonia 's first independence . 
  chairman should definitely be ( over ) ambitious aivar pohlak , who is the godfather of estonian football right now ( good and bad ) . 
  manager should be siil serviti ( hedgehog edgewise ) , which comes from the epic kalevipoeg again and is a popular character here . 
  stadium ( lindakivi ) should n't be a big one as there are n't any big one 's in estonia anyway . 
  attendance numbers should be extremely low as in real life ( [ the average was 191 in 2012 ] ( http://jalgpall.ee/attendance.php?b=ml&amp;year=2012 ) ) , just to make it a bit more unique and stand out from the others . 
  ca n't think of anything, 
  kit should be a simple blue-black-white , after the national flag . 
  for shits and giggles the away kit colors should be green-purple-white , after the hideous ( in my opinion ) flag of the governorate of estonia . 
  not really here to spoil op 's party , but this would be a really bad deal . 
  just head over to / r/dota2 and get it for free from there . 
  e : actually by looking at his dota 2 inventory he is likely looking for unsuspecting people , so be aware . 
  here 's to 5000 more !, 
  now i really wan na know how many goals has gomez scored in a week . 
  huh ? 
  that bradford game has has nothing to with reading . 
  to be honest , it feels like a weak comeback to me . 
  so often it feels like most of the people here have never seen a full football match or watched highlights on youtube . 
  every gif/video seems to be amazing or absolutely incredible , even though these goals/passes/saves happen weekly . 
  milan was matched automatically with barcelona in step 5 . 
  there were four spanish teams remaining and thus one had to be drawn . 
  malaga was in the same group with milan so that left only barca . 
  otherwise there would have been 4 spanish teams in the last three pairs , which , of course , was n't allowed . 
  this increases the chances a bit . 
  the remaining teams at the time milan was drawn were :, 
  * ~ ~ malaga ~ ~ ( same group ), 
  * man united, 
  * porto, 
  * real madrid, 
  if a non-spanish team ( man united or psg ) was drawn from the winners pot , then there would have been 2 spanish group winners and 2 spanish runner-ups for the remaining three matches . 
  thus these would be the remaining teams :, 
  * man united or psg, 
  * porto, 
  * real madrid, 
  that would leave at least one match with two teams from the same association . 
  * man united, 
  * ~ ~ porto ~ ~, 
  * real madrid, 
  at this stage it was already sure that malaga would have to play porto , as people have already mentioned ( spanish v spanish not allowed , no other options for malaga ) . 
  the remaining teams had no restrictions and real madrid drawing man united was just a 50/50 chance . 
  spk3z is correct .

  [ rs tv show tracker ] ( http://lab.rolisoft.net/tvshowtracker.html ), 
  yes , we play in some obscure european top league , but nevertheless we scored 136 ( 106 league + 28 cup + 2 europe ) in 42 official matches . 
  i want some recognition !, 
  yay , another one . 
  lacks practicality and content . 
  [ the same thing was asked some time ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/okxvi/anyone_know_someone_in_the_game_personally/ ) , if anyone is interested . 
   as i played for flora 's youth team until i was fifteen , i know most of the players born in 88-89 who have made it to the game . 
  the best ones even have caps for the national team !, 
   many of my current co-workers are also amateur players who are in the ( a few years dated ) database . 
   all in all , i would think there are more than 50 players in the database that i know in real life , 3-4 that i communicate with regulary . 
   fc levadia tallinn at # 56 and fc flora tallinn at # 61 ? 
  the meistriliiga ( estonian top division ) must be pretty high quality , since neither of the above teams managed to win it . 
  the champions were jk n\u00f5mme kalju , ranked # 102 . 
  i agree , that estonian clubs are nowhere near that good , but the order of these three clubs is correct . 
  by the looks of it the stats include last four seasons , which means in that period levadia made it into the play-off round of europa league , while others were defeated in the first round every time . 
  that probably over-weights flora 's slightly better performance in the league . 
  and although kalju won this year and finished second the year before , they were far off before that . 
  how can i output this sound into mic ? 
  this shit happens all the time . 
  i bet most of the people only know about these movies because of the haters . 
  same thing with a serbian film . 
  [ a never ending sliding tackle , to be more precise ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7rnt5c2qaq ), 
  better than seeing that same old once in a lifetime goal for the n ^ th time . 
  [ why you hef to be mad ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqvb2oy0ph8 ), 
  nice to watch , but far from unbelievable . 
  i doubt he has played in plymouth and west devon combination division one . 
  it 's snowing in winter , call the police . 
  oh my gooooooooooood !, 
  a poor effort by ba . 
  he hit it low , where it was the easiest for the defender to block it . 
  vermaelen just did what every other defender would have done in this situation . 
  sounded like that to me as well . 
  he had that guilty pause right after . 
  andres oper in a goal compilation , now i 've seen everything .
