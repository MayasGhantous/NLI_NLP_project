  if i was his coach i would yell at him until he cried for doing this shit . 
  the term `` non-league '' is fucking stupid . 
  do they not play in a league then ? 
  diaby-giroud is the new song-rvp, 
  although it might be hard to believe , these are actually childhood pictures of actors that later in their lives portrayed the characters . 
  this shit does not belong here . 
  this literally happens in every other game . 
  i do n't know why , but for some reason i still ca n't instantly say which is which , when talking about these keepers . 
  even today , when asked how did arsenal score i said the shot took a huge deflection and ... umm ... the keeper had no chance . 
  mignolet and begovic, 
  continues the tradition . 
  four from four ( three clubs and nt ) . 
  not bad . 
  lukaku/defoe/ba up front . 
  so funny !!!, 
  where did you find this gem ? 
  thanks for letting us know !!!!, 
  big ass names = / = quality, 
  \u00e4\u00e4\u00e4, 
  those damn turtles . 
  has to be 16-year-old [ marten m\u00e4gi ] ( http://int.soccerway.com/players/martin-magi/249834/ ) . 
  why ? 
  because he is the only one that has ever featured on the bench in the league for us . 
  ~ ~ screenshots or ~ ~ stop saying literally . 
  despite the schedule , i doubt any of you 're players died . 
  lol , so funny , that guy is showing the middle finger, 
  e : and 8 hours ago is not `` just '', 
  you guys have mistaken cristiano ronaldo for ronaldo, 
  i ca n't seem to find that one list . 
  no , not again !!, 
  it 's all about focus , these fucking lines do n't do anything . 
  no , he was certainly not brutally rejected . 
  original, 
  other than klavan and ojamaa , i do n't recall any players doing * very well * with their teams either . 
  kink has had an impact at gy\u00f6r , but the playing level there is so-so . 
  add pareiko , morozov and maybe zenjov , who just recently came back from an injury , to the the players who might play decently against a team like holland . 
  others are * streets behind * . 
  previous matches have clearly shown that we are not on the same level we were a year ago and we 've never been good against top teams away anyway , so i doubt the game against holland will be any different . 
  sadly , joel has been far from a class act since his return to the national team . 
  i guess the long flights affect him too much . 
  tv on google play is not available in your country yet . 
  posting this makes you a cunt . 
  those * magical * gifs are always posted in the match threads anyway , so they should stay there . 
  gif comments are always one of the most upvoted ones . 
  third most voted comment in barca-milan thread . 
  plus all the goals are in the match thread itself . 
  [ the same thing on sauniks ' official channel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyvytk9nmt0 ), 
  fucking stop reuploading things to your shitty channel and just link to the originals , you twat . 
  [ the same thing on david a 's official channel ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbdfqgdiogc ), 
  fucking stop reuploading things to your shitty channel and just link to the originals , you twat . 
  i once found an arsenal shirt as well . 
  that 's all i 'm telling you guys . 
  i do n't think you know what * cameo * means . 
  what a post from a random redditor . 
  that screenshot alone does n't show anything unusual as a lot can happen in 15 + years . 
  take the one with the biggest stadium, 
   and i ca n't think of a team in recent memory that has conceded so many in three games against anyone ? 
  this , of course , comes from a league no one has ever heard , but trans scored 40 in 4 games against ajax in estonian top division two seasons ago . 
  18 of those were scored by one guy . 
  [ 3 ] ( http://int.soccerway.com/matches/2011/08/13/estonia/meistriliiga/jk-trans-narva/fc-ajax-lasnamae/1076442/ ) and, 
  sensational ? 
  i would expect a striker get a shot on goal from that position , even if it is a bit awkward to get to . 
  fucking hell , at least let it disappear from the front page of r/soccer before you post the same exact video again . 
  wrong , you 'd have 38205000 dollars . 
  no , you should not be worried . 
  it 's a game and the name of a player has nothing to do with anything in the game nor the real world . 
  to me it looks the opposite as you have to rely on imported players and not your actual academy products . 
  shut up , fagget . 
  [ p\u00e4rnu linnameeskond ] ( http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=320090024704806&amp;set=a.302313829815759.66328.302303666483442&amp;type=3&amp;theater ) from estonian first division . 
  yes , they have that logo on the [ shirt ] ( http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=327224200658055&amp;set=a.327223080658167.70661.302303666483442&amp;type=3&amp;theater ) . 
   i 've yet to see any professional sport make teams play each other after they have been eliminated from a tournament . 
  literally every team sport tournament that has round robin phase , e.g. 
  fifa world cup . 
  from the title i expected something like [ this ] ( http://www.larsramstad.com/bilder/full/splitheadt1000_2_big_busts7.jpg ) , but it was only a cut . 
  what a let down . 
  her name in estonian is `` punch ( him/her ) in the face '' . 
  in other words this is a logo for a * new company * . 
  fuck that title , do n't bother googling for the * old * logo . 
  cest is gmt +2, 
  cool , cool , cool, 
  if you wan na see something silly , watch [ new kids turbo ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648112/ ) . 
  remakes count as well . 
  so if someone watched the games live , it 's possible to have a bigger count on the courier than the number of games played . 
  okay . 
  i 'm not sure what i watched , why i watched it and what this has to do anything with football other than saying denilson is barry 's long lost cousin . 
  huh ? 
  two days ago , coincidentally , this was on the front page of r/soccer . 
  yes, 
  the players would look like ants if the image is resized . 
  `` this app is incompatible with your phone . '', 
  no apps support 2.1 any more . 
  sad . 
  two most southern teams in northern conference would then be moved to southern conference for the new season , so that the number of teams would be even . 
  english u21 players ( eg wilshere , sterling ) got the most minutes in the premier league this season while playing for arsenal and liverpool . 
  thus , so to say , these two clubs contributed the most to the future of the england national team . 
  created a torrent file of all the replays , if anyone 's interested . 
  i do n't have the greatest connection , but it should be faster once more people help seed it .
