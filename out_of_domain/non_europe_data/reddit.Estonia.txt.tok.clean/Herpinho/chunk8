  estonia - kyrgysztan , both to score @ 2.20, 
  estonia is clearly the best team , but our defensive line is just atrocious today . 
  ca n't see us ~ ~ e ~ ~ keeping a clean sheet . 
  huh ? 
  explain like i 'm five . 
  cool . 
  world as in america . 
  cool , cool , cool . 
  i 've had it opened almost the entire time , only downtime has been due to windows updates . 
  not sure why it stopped at 99 % , might be because you ca n't connect to me for some reason , not too sure about how all this works . 
  trackers/dht show that i 'm the only seeder at the moment as well , so the hit-and-run mentality of others does n't help either sadly . 
  maybe it 's just easier for you to download the few uncompleted ones through dota . 
  sadly yeah , it was a quite favorable draw for hjk . 
  but on the other hand , closest opponent possible , that saves traveling costs for the club , and our clubs are just dirt poor . 
  and even better for our small fans group , just around $ 40 to get there and back on the same day + match ticket , no need for hotel or anything . 
  that 's pretty cheap for an away game . 
  two season ago there was a friendly that ended 6-1 to hjk , but surely it will be closer this time . 
  best . 
  ugly .

  attributes screen is awfully wasteful when viewed in higher resolutions . 
  you can fit so much more on the screen in profile mode and also customize it to your needs .

  ca n't decide between all those godawful russian accents in american movies . 
  as i understand russian a bit , it just ruins the moment every single time . 
  it 's like they 're not even try , which is probably true . 
  other than saying `` spain/uruguay/etc will win , cause they 're good '' or jokingly saying that `` jamaica will win , cause why not '' there 's not much to say at the moment , since most of the teams that will compete are still unknown . 
  `` too soon '' fits the context perfectly right now . 
  yes . 
  dont forget audi cup and paulaner cup . 
  could we please stop using hd in the submission titles . 
  these kind of football videos are never in true hd . 
  just because some asshat on his laptop upscales shitty quality videos and adds 10 filters to it , does n't make them hd .

  he 's named [ silvio philips ] ( http://jalgpall.ee/players.php?year=2013&amp;team=1382&amp;player=30624&amp;b=ml ) . 
  not exactly what i would guess to be a traditional croatian name , but what do i know . 
  both play for n\u00f5mme kalju , for the reserve team to be more precise . 
  they got some game time recently in the league as first team players were rested due to midweek european games . 
  one guy is called jefferson , the other one is reginato . 
  that 's pretty much all i know about them , being a casual fan of the club . 
  why they are here and play week in week out in the third tier for our reserves ? 
  who knows . 
  a keeper named gary hogan was on the bench for tallinna kalev a few times , but he never made an appearance for the club . 
  surely he missed a great opportunity to be featured on this beautiful map as he left the club less than a ( is * a * needed ? 
  sounds really weird ) month ago . 
  match threads are full of those horrific gifs . 
  keep 'em there .

  i 'd bet your description is spot on . 
  the team itself plays in the third tier ( esiliiga b ) in estonia and ( if i remember correctly ) is the combined men 's team of p\u00e4rnu jk , p\u00e4rnu vaprus and p\u00e4rnu kalev , which all have their own youth systems . 
  they all played separately until a few years back when they decided to merge so they would have a more competitive team in the town of p\u00e4rnu . 
  but they still suck since the players are amateurs and most are born after 1990 . 
  two seasons ago they just had a coat of arms of p\u00e4rnu as they 're logo , but i guess they wanted something different . 
  but tbh , no on really cares , since there 's hardly any football culture in estonia . 
  does using refresher with poison nova add another instant or does it just reset the duration of the first one on enemy heroes when they 're hit ? 
  [ but , but ... you do n't need to ravage to be a hero ] ( http://www.dota2.com/heroes/ ), 
  that happened like two or three days ago and a post was made about it .

  why exactly is this phenomenal ? 
  020 is still 20, 
  before gibraltar joined the party which european country held the record for playing with all 52 fellow uefa members ? 
  why bother when sites like [ livescoretv ] ( http://www.livesoccertv.com/ ) and [ liveonsat ] ( http://liveonsat.com/ ) do it anyway and are far more comprehensive ? 
  yo mama so fat necro maxes aura first . 
  doubt it was the exact same file as i started this save pretty much when the fm came out , but that should do it if you are interested . 
  i 'm one of those managers who does n't really care about the backroom staff , so my dof hires the scouting staff and gives them assignments . 
  why do so many matches in mls start later than the announced kick-off time ? 
  in this case it was delayed 25 minutes . 
  nah , it 's fabio and he realized that rvp had taken his number while he was away at qpr . 
  why would a movie leave one devastated ? 
  whether it is well made or not , in the end it 's still just a movie .
