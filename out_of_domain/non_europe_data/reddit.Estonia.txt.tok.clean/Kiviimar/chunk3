  moreover , i 'm not familiar with either aref chaker nor abdullah nasih ulwan , although i understand the later is a well-respected scholar , so i will try to acquire this book you mentioned . 
  attempts to find peer-reviews of this work have so far failed , so i hope you can understand my suspicion . 
  the problem with our understanding of events like these , which have occured over many centuries ago is that the sources available to us display an innate cultural bias , which may be excarbated over time . 
  in fact , this extends to any source , regardless of time and place . 
  any scholar interested in studying these events , be they the conquest of jerusalem in 1187 , the destruction of baghdad by the mongols in 1258 , or the surrender of granada in 1453 should be able to employ and respect the different sources available to them with an amount of detachment and intellectual honesty . 
  as a rule of academical conduct , i would not be able to simply utilise one source , make a grand statement about how noble group x is and how barbaric group y , pat myself on the back and go home . 
  i hope that elucidates to many my original point , in which i did attempt to refute what you were saying , but only called it onesided . 
  thanks for the response !, 
  i 'll definitely take a look at it tomorrow ( it 's getting late where i live ) . 
  but this creates a problem with regards to those people who have studied islam academically , for example , but are not spiritually convinced with what they encounter . 
  would n't it be fair to say that we can expect that these are the people that have studied ` true islam ' . 
  would you then consider them kuff\u0101r ? 
  yes , maybe !, 
  i mean there are already so many ways to approach the whole concept of islam . 
  i suppose anthropologists would be more interested in how people ` live islam ' on a daily basis , whereas theologians would prefer to understand the religious texts . 
  i 'm talking about this last group in particular ; these are usually people that are highly competent in arabic , possibly in other semitic languages , such as hebrew and aramaic , and are thus capable of reading the quran in its original language . 
  if they remain , let 's say , unconvinced by its message , would that make them * kuff\u0101r * ? 
  hey , was jaber je docent arabisch daar ? 
  and also bizarre . 
  there 's no mention of a garment in the arabic , and the word \u0631\u0648\u062d / r\u016b\u1e25 / does n't mean angel . 
  arberry 's translation is much closer to the text :, 
  `` and she who guarded her virginity , so we breathed into her of our spirit and appointed her and her son to be a sign unto all beings . '', 
  i do n't believe that any serious scholar of islam believes that muhammad was illiterate . 
  i 'm not sure i can agree with this . 
  i suppose that you 're refering to quran 96:1 \u0627\u0642\u0631\u0623 \u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0631\u0628\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u062e\u0644\u0642 , but the text itself does not mention his response . 
  interestingly , the same verse also refers to `` teaching by the pen '' , which would be an interesting phrase to use in the presence of someone who was supposedly illiterate ? 
  thanks for the response . 
  i 'm playing a bit of devil 's advocate here , as i have n't really made up my mind on the matter yet . 
  i 'll give you my thoughts on the the second citation first , as i 'm more familiar with it the verse you 're refering to is 157 , not 155 , but that 's not that important . 
  in any case , the arabic reads * alladh\u012bna yattaba\u02bf\u016bna l-ras\u016bla l-nab\u012byya l-\u02beumm\u012byya lladh\u012b yu\u011fid\u016bnah\u016b etc * ; the word \u02beumm\u012b being translated as ` illiterate ' . 
  most translators seem to prefer this meaning , probably as a result of ibn ` abb\u0101s ' * had\u012bth * when he said, 
  however , it 's also possible to translate ` common ' ( arberry ) ; ` illiterate ( not conventially educated ) ( sarwar ) or to leave it untranslated ( shakir ) . 
  now for the first verse . 
  the phrasing tends to imply you 're right : * wa m\u0101 kunta tatl\u016b min qabli-h\u012b min kit\u0101bin wa l\u0101 ta\u1e2bu\u1e6d\u1e6duh\u016b bi-yam\u012bnika * , ` and you did not recite before any book [ translation says scripture ] , nor did you write it with your right hand . 
  it seems a bit mystical , but if we take the meaning of * kit\u0101b * to be ` scripture ' , then it may just mean that muhammad was not a clergyman . 
  my buddy ibn kath\u012br also refers to the hadith mentions earlier in his tafs\u012br . 
  if you allow me the question , would the matter of muhammad 's ( il ) literacy influence your faith or understanding of islam in any way ? 
  thank you for being open and honest about this . 
   prophet muhammad was a merchant , he used to interact with different kinds of people , he went to sham for trading , and sham at that times , were under the territory of the romans which their formal religion was christian . 
  can you imagine if he interacted with the scholars of christianity and learn from their scriptures , how much would the quran will be influenced by the scripture of christianity ? 
  this is one of the reasons why the last prophet were destined to not be able to read . 
  apart from the issue of him reading scriptures , is n't it widely accepted that he interacted with the christian monk bahira . 
  it 's supposed to be mentioned in tabari at least , but i ca n't find the reference right now . 
   just look at the statues around the kaba , why do you think there were so many god-statues inside and around the kaba at that time ? 
  while prophet ibrahim was a monotheistic . 
  its because there was a man from the quraish tribe who went to sham , and he saw many of the romans creating statue of their pious person , he felt that by creating statue of a pious person will make him feel closer to god , hence when he went back to mecca he created the same thing , generation after generation passed by , there was a generation after them who had no idea who was this statue , but because their ancestor used to feel something spirituality just by presence around it . 
  those generation started to think that this is might be the statue of god , viola !, 
  i 've not heard of this tradition before . 
  according to ibn al-kalb\u012b 's * kit\u0101b al - ' asn\u0101m * mecca was settled by the ismail , whose descendants eventually filled the city , which then led to infighting and the abandonment of the religion of ibrahim ( * wa stabdal\u016b bi-d\u012bni ibr\u0101h\u012bma wa ism\u0101 ' \u012bla * ) . 
   it was written about the prophet in the torah and the gospel , as unlettered , the one who can not read . 
  if prophet muhammad can read , then the jews and the christians would say '' he is not a prophet , because it is written in our scripture that the last prophet would be unlettered '' and they will accuse him ( prophet muhammad ) as a liar . 
  do you have a reference to this in the torah or gospel ? 
  edit : edited for style . 
  i mean ... i major in classical arabic and semitic philology . 
  i 'm not sure if that 's enough to convince you , but i thought it might be useful to point out . 
  i feel that you 're letting your personal sentiments get in the way here . 
  in any case , the meaning of \u0627\u0642\u0631\u0623 ( ' iqra ' ) is rather unambiguously the imperative `` read !, 
  rectified : the same * s\u016bra * refers to the verse to teach by the pen ( \u0639\u0644\u0651\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0645 ) . 
  hmm , sorry ; maybe there 's some kind of miscommunication going on here . 
  without resorting to insults , the only thing i was trying to point out is that the s\u016bra we 're talking about , i.e. 
  s\u016bra 96 ( \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0642 ) , which starts with the imperative verb \u0627\u0642\u0631\u0623 , contains the line \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0651\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0645 in the fourth verse . 
  yes or no ? 
  what i was trying to point out is that the use of the word qalam , `` pen '' , is interesting , as the qur ` an is considered to have been revealed to a supposedly illiterate person . 
  is that clear enough ? 
   he has only interacted with the monk for half an hour . 
  you 're telling me that he has gotten the entire bibilical/judeic scripute stories at a young age when he was barely adolescent to remember into his head and then approximately 25 years later spit all those knowledge he acquired in less than a day into a whole book ? 
  no , that 's not what i 'm saying . 
  i 'm merely asking about the degree to which muhammad is considered to have interacted with christians -- both clergy and laymen -- while in syria and elsewhere . 
  how about his interactions with khadija 's brother , waraqah , considered to be a nestorian monk ? 
   also , tabari is not a reputable source . 
  the guy , tabari himself , collected every piece of info , true and false , to say about the prophet . 
  he said he was merely a collector of information , truth and false , and that clearly he should not be relied as a reference . 
  so if he heard the prophet popped a bunny out of a top hat and it grew wings , he would write that , too . 
  alright , fair enough . 
  but it 's also considered to be mentioned by ibn hisham and ibn sa 'd . 
  hmm , no , that was not necessarily what i was aiming at . 
  in any case , i feel that we might be talking past eachother , so thank you for your patience and your responses ( :, 
   first off , that was khadija 's cousin , second of all , waraqah died few hours after he met the prophet on the same day . 
  in fact , it was waraqah himself who informed the prophet ( pbuh ) that he is the prophet while he himself was too apprehensive to accept the fact . 
  cousin , my bad . 
  i was wondering though , ibn ish\u0101q mentioned that bil\u0101l was being tortured by umayya b. khalif , and that waraqa put an end to this . 
  how could this be possible if he died a few hours after meeting muhammad ? 
   second of all , he spent majority of his life in the arabian peninsula , outside of jerusalem , where the number of monks and priests were way too sparse for him to interact with , especially since the detailed biography talks about him doing so many other things to even have the time to meet with monks and priests to learn about christianity and judaism . 
  okay , that 's fair enough . 
   also , it might help that the quran was oral , not in a book during the time of the prophet . 
  it was only codiifed into books after his death . 
  i think this is one of the most convicing arguments actually . 
  still , one does not necessarily disprove the other , right ? 
  do n't you feel that 's taking it a bit too far ? 
  the only problem here is that i just misremembered , as i do n't think that there 's any source that consider waraqa the cousin of khadija . 
  i just made a mistake in their relationship , that does n't necessarily disprove my other points . 
  besides , i 'm fully invested and convinced of my ability to read arabic , so unless you 're saying that tabari , ibn kath\u012br , al + tha ` \u0101labi , and al-kalb\u012b are all spreading `` inaccurate info '' , i 'm still waiting for an actual response . 
  consider also s. guenther 's article * muhammad , the illiterate prophet * ; which appeared in the journal of qur ' \u0101nic studies . 
  yep . 
  pretty much any muslim who dies as a result of political conflict is considered * sh\u0101hid * , ` martyr ' . 
  it would absolutely be incorrect . 
  finnish has been influenced ( mostly lexically ) by ( proto - ) germanic languages and later by swedish and russian . 
  moreover , in finland itself you also encounter different dialects . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean with `` grammatical circlejerk '' though . 
  i can only talk about the early islamic period ( up to the coming of the seljuks ) , but there are probably some things we should clear up before moving on .
