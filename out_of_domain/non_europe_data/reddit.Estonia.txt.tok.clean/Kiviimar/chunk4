  i hope that some researchers on the diadochoi period could also respond , because it 's been a while since i looked at that myself . 
  ** how do we define the middle-east ? 
  within our field of study , there are differing opinions on what constitutes the middle-east . 
  for example , i 'm currently living in tunisia , which i would consider a part of the middle-east , but other people may disagree with me , considering the maghreb ( libya , tunisia , algeria , morocco ) a different region altogether . 
  some consider egypt to be part of the middle-east , but differing opinions would put the border at the sinai . 
  those who would include egypt might similarly not include the horn of africa . 
  it seems that you seem to favour the notion of the middle-east being anatolia , the levant , mesopotamia , greater iran and the arabian peninsula . 
  i would even go a bit further and say your definition of the middle-east is restricted to mesopotamia ( modern-day parts of syria , iraq , and kuwait ) . 
  at the risk of giving off a serious arm-chair governor vibe , mesopotamia and egypt are probably rather easy areas to control . 
  they are for the most part flat , fertile , and cut off from immediate access : the zagros mountains in the case of mesopotamia and the red sea in the case of egypt . 
  of course both areas are still vulnerable from the south and west , but we 'll get to that too . 
  ** the middle-east in the early islamic period **, 
  so i will now focus on my actual area of specialisation , which is the early islamic period . 
  despite the image imprinted upon us of the ` abbasid caliphate ' being a unified structure , which had clearly defined borders , until the mongol invasion and the subsequent raze of baghdad in 1258 . 
  this image is only partially true . 
  let 's go back to the rise of the abbasids as a state to explain what happened in detail . 
  the umayyads had been in power for almost a century when they were violently overthrown by the ` abbasids . 
  half a century later , a political crisis at the beginning of the 9th century , resulting in the death of the caliph al - ' amin shattered mesopotamia and left the abbasids internally weak , and it is almost immediately afterwards that the caliphs became increasingly dependent on the protection of turkic warlords , turning more into figureheads from whom ( semi - ) independent rulers drew legitimacy , but controlled little more territory outside the palace in samarra . 
  as a result , many autonomous statelets sprung up all over the mesopotamia and the levant , and egypt was completely lost from 868 onwards . 
  it has been argued that one of the reasons for the initial response to the crusades was so lackluster was that the various * emirs * were more concerned expanding outplaying their muslim rivals than to pay attention to yet * another * political actor in the area . 
  ** tl ; dr : the actual period during which the middle-east was united under one islamic 'em pire ' was rather short ; particularly during the middle-abbasid period many different statelets sprung up **,

  hello !, 
  i 'm doing my ma in arabic and semitic philology , but i studied medieval islamic history and shi'ite theology during my bachelor 's . 
  great question , let 's see what was going there . 
  you will undoubtedly be aware of the difference between sunni and shi\u2018a islam , but i 'll put them here just to provide the argument with more clarity . 
  ** whence the difference between shi\u2018ites and sunnis ? 
  the origins of the shi\u2018a - sunni split seem to be political in nature : after the death of muhammad , there immediately arose a discussion on the subject of his succession ; but it is very unlikely that either party called themselves by these names . 
  when talking about the earliest proto-shi ` ite movements , most scholars of medieval islam prefer the term `` alid '' , to distinguish the largely political movement from the later theological movement . 
  in any case , the ` alid movement represented a minority , as it appears that most muslims supported abu bakr as muhammad 's successor . 
  because of this , the ` alids became very popular with disenfranchised muslims , at the period these were mostly converts from christianity , judaism , zoroastrianism and particularly a host of millenialist cults and sects of the time . 
  heinz halm argues that it is only from a later period onwards , around the time of the martyrdom of husayn , that we can talk of a `` theological '' shi'ism , which seems to have incorporated many ideas from iranian religion ( s ) , particularly on the concept of the `` light of muhammad '' ( ar . 
  * n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad * ) and its understanding of hereditary authority . 
  ** the shi'ite relation to the abbasid revolution **, 
  coming back to the point , as you can imagine the martyrdom of \u1e24usayn at the hands of the umayyads in kerbala was n't exactly warmly received by the shi'ites . 
  the reasons for the collapse of the umayyads are many and can not be discussed here , but it 's obvious that the abbasid revolution was at its core a populist grassroots movement , supported very strongly by muslims of non-arab origin , particularly from the area of khorasan ( roughly modern-day turkmenistan ) . 
  kennedy notes that `` the problems of the [ muslim ] community would never be resolved until the lead was taken by a member of the holy family '' , which is pretty much in line with basic shi'ite ideas of rulership . 
  although the head of the ` abbasid dynasty was of the same descent as the candidate supported by the ` alids ( ` abd allah b. mu ` \u0101wiya ) , he was of a different branch and not preferred by the majority of the ` alid party . 
  in the end , this difference led to open simultaneous revolts in basra and medina . 
  although the medinan revolt was quickly crushed , the revolt in basra spread initially rather successfully to other cities in iraq , before it was finally crushed in b\u0101khamr\u0101 , on the road between basra and k\u016bfa . 
  the leader of the revolt died several days later of his wounds . 
  ** tl ; dr : the ` alid ( later shi\u2018ite ) community felt betrayed by the ` abbasids because they did n't choose their candidate to be the new leader **,

  i 'm pretty sure halm has something about al-saff\u0101h , but i wo n't be home until january and i do n't have the book in pdf . 
  it 's from mst3k, 
  upvoted for laughs , but ... that 's not in the qur ` an, 
  yeah , it 's borrowed from german . 
  haha , no ; the japanese word is native and thus coincidental . 
  the finnish word was borrowed , probably from * low * german , which was the lingua franca of the baltic area in the 16th/17th centuries . 
  disclaimer : i do n't know pre-koin\u00e9 greek that well . 
  the achaemenids were named after their first ruler achaemenes , a greek approximation of old persian / hax\u0101mani\u0161 / , which we find in the behistun inscription . 
  the name was translated by b. schlerath as `` characterized by a follower 's spirit '' . 
  i 'm not sure what that 's supposed to mean . 
  now the etymology of achaeans ( gr . 
  \u03b1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 ; `` akhaioi '' ) is contested , it has been suggested that it was derived from a hittite form , but beekes contests this and suggests it 's of pre-greek origin .

  - took old persian in college, 
  - beekes , r. * an etymological dictionary of greek * ( brill : leiden , 2010 ), 
  & m. de vaan : * an overview of old persian *, 
  i 'll try to be brief . 
  you 're right that it 's highly anachronistic to apply a modern term like `` feminist '' to someone like muhammad , but the same has been done with terms like `` socialist '' , for example in maxime rodinson 's biography of the aforementioned . 
  this is also not a scientific article , so we arguably do not have to hold it to the same standards . 
  whether that is ethical is another question . 
  as you 'll probably know , the biggest problem with our understanding of muhammad is that there are virtually no contemporary accounts of his life . 
  all our information on his deeds and his life is derived from later , islamic sources that sometimes contradict eachother and naturally exhibit a certain kind degree of bias . 
  this is not to say these sources are false , but at the very least they should be treated with a large degree of caution , * especially * where it concerns pre-islamic arabia . 
  another aspect of this problem is that the inhabitants of pre-islamic arabia were not a homogenous group . 
  for example , pre-islamic yemen was characterised by a highly developed urban civilisation , and it seems unlikely that they would have the same laws as the settlements along the syrian frontier , let alone those of the bedouin tribes in the arabian heartland . 
  interestingly , judging solely from the written material available , it would appear that gender distinctions in the upper part of the peninsula were not as strongly defined as elswhere , considering the amount of materials written by women . 
  moving on to the actual questions : i 'm not a specialist on islamic law , so i 'm not quite comfrotable talking about marital and property rights , but i 'll try to go through your points one-by-one :, 
   muhammad gave them the right to own property and extended marital and inheritence rights, 
  it 's possibly that muhammad extended marital and inheritance rights , but even from islamic sources it 's apparent that women in pre-islamic arabia owned property and land , such as in the case of khadija , muhammad 's first wife . 
   he changed the way dowry was paid , instead of going to the father it went to the wife and that she would keep it even after the marriage was terminated ( by death ), 
  hoyland ( 2001 ) notes that something like this is mentioned by tabari :, 
   in pre-islamic times , when a man died and left a widow , his heir , if he came at once and threw his garment over her , had the right to marry her under the dowry of her deceased master or to give her in marriage and take her dowry . 
  but if she anticipated him and went off to her own people , then they took charge of her . 
  so it seems that according to the islamic tradition that widows in pre-islamic arabia could be forcefully integrated into the tribal structure of her deceased husband . 
  at the same time , tabari also notes that they were able to escape from this fate . 
  it does n't seem very clear either way , but that is also the nature of the texts we 're dealing with . 
   he gave women the right to divorce their husbands ( for any reason ? 
  exceptions ? ), 
  the trend seems to be in the opposite direction here , actually . 
  isfahani in his * kit\u0101b al-aghan\u012b * says that ( some ) women in pre-islamic arabia had the right to dismiss their husbands , which is to be contrasted with the islamic perspective that a woman has to ask her husband to divorce her . 
  she is theoretically able to go to a judge independently , but her husband will always have to finalise the divorce . 
   women were given the right to inherit property and family assets . 
  this can be contested by looking to the islamic sources , not just the aforementioned example of khadija , but also the girl waraqa , who is considered to have promised muhammad 's father a hundred camels if he would sleep with her . 
  the implication here is that waraqa herself was the owner of this stock of camels , and in the case of khadija it is likely that she ( partially ) inhereted her wealth from her father or another male family member . 
   is any of this true ? 
  it is likely not * completely * false , but seriously ambiguous at best . 
  it would appear that many of the things mentioned here as being introduced by muhammad already existed at the time , and in some cases the preceding structure allowed * more * freedom to women . 
  however , many of these things likely partially depended on class and wealth . 
  it seems that muhammad might have straightened this out and leveled the laws for society as a whole .
