  ** opinion warning : ** in my opinion the article is poor journalism . 
  we should be very careful with applying modern terms to historical figures so far removed from our own period , especially those with tremendous impact , such as muhammad . 
  make no mistake , the same goes for terms like * socialist * ( rodinson ) , * terrorist * ( coulter , spencer ) , * post-colonialist * ( crone ) , etc. 
  in some cases these terms are useful in order to increase our understanding of the period , but we must be extremely cautious that these do not cloud our judgment .

  as a dutchman i can say that the netherlands is not `` very anti-islam '' . 
  we have our share of bigoted politicans , but it would be extremely unlikely the op would be attacked * en plein public * for praying , especially in a more urban environment . 
  oh sorry , i should have clarified that . 
  you 're absolutely right , it 's not a term that applies to him at all , but rather something patricia crone uses in one of her articles to describe the changing political situation in mesopotamia after the breakdown of the abbasid caliphate from the middle of the ninth century onwards . 
  it 's actually a really fascinating article actually , and [ available online for free ] ( https://www.hs.ias.edu/files/crone_articles/crone_post_colonialism.pdf ) . 
  a better example concerning muhammad 's period would be for example ( proto - ) nationalist , which has been used to describe islam as an `` arabic '' religion , so to speak . 
  hey !, 
  as you yourself allude to , most of the information we possess about the * ha\u0161\u012b\u0161iyya * is derived from polemic sources . 
  because i do n't have my regular sources at my disposal right now , i 'm going to take a look at their entry in * the encylopaedia of isl\u0101m * . 
  bernard lewis mentions that while all european names for the order are derived from the arabic term for cannabis ( * \u1e25a\u0161\u012b\u0161 * ) , usage of the substance is not attributed to the sect in the medieval contemporary sources of either crusader , sunni or isma\u2018ili origin ; although it appears once in a polemic fatimid tractate . 
  lewis concludes that the term is of syrian origin and was restricted to that area .

  as i pointed out , i ca n't access it now , but also consider reading heinz halm 's excellent book on shi'ism , i 'm pretty sure he refers to the sect in there as well . 
  speaking about the spread of islam in the middle-east , there exists a widespread idea of the camel-riding left-handed bedouin warrior who would give you the choice between islam and death . 
  this is not very historical , however :, 
  ** numbers of conversion **, 
  after the destruction of the umayyads ( who actively discouraged conversion using the argument that islam was an arabic religion for arabs ) , the rate of conversion increased dramatically . 
  there are no exact numbers , but richard bulliet estimated that by the beginning of the 10th century 80 to 90 percent of the population of iraq had converted to islam . 
  it seems likely that numbers in egypt would have been similar , and the death of coptic language as a spoken language in the 14th-15th century may also give a clue to this process . 
  the process outside of urban areas was likely to have been much slower , as is attested by the continued existence of non-muslims ( albeit in relatively low numbers ) in different areas of the middle-east . 
  ** methods of conversion **, 
  the most obvious method employed was to make conversion to islam socially and economically attractive . 
  non-muslims would pay a higher tax on their property as well as a poll tax , making conversion economically beneficial . 
  individuals may also convert in order to gain prestige or in order to rise in the ranks of society . 
  outside of the * dar al - ' isl\u0101m * , in our case central asia , the caucasus , the indian subcontinent and south-east asia , we find that from the 14th to 15th centuries the activities of sufi orders start to play an important role . 
  examples of these orders would be the yasawiyya in central asia , the qadariyya in the caucasus , and the naqshbandiyya in the indian subcontinen . 
  sufi saints were considered to be able to perform miracles and would enter into highly spectacular debates with representatives of other religions , which is described in various sources from the period ( such as ibn battuta , i 'll look up a nice citation from him ) . 
  this is not to say there were no periods of repression of non-muslim groups ; ( the threat of ) physical violence in some cases undoubtedly influenced the rate of conversion at various times and in various places . 
  the massacre of the jews in granada might have enticed some of their co-religionists to either leave the area or to convert to islam . 
  there are also some indications that this occured on some southeast-asian islands where local sultans would wage war on non-muslim tribes . 
  this is outside my area of specialisation , so i 'm a bit apprehensive about it though .

  just a point of order : the painter is not chechen , but ossetian . 
  hey , great question !, 
  so zoroastrianism has n't completely disappeared from ( greater ) iran : up to this day there are still some small pockets of zoroastrians , particularly in yazd province . 
  although they are theoretically protected under the iranian constitution , there are reports of harrassment and discrimination . 
  the underlying reason for the disappearance of zoroastrianism is in no small way related to the fact that it was never too large to begin with . 
  if i remember my classes correctly , zoroastrianism was something of an elitist religion meant for the ruling class which was n't too keen on proselytising and outlawed marriages with non-zoroastrians . 
  the children of mixed families would therefor not be considered believers . 
  i understand that even to this day most zoroastrians do not accept conversion to zoroastrianism . 
  ** so what did people believe if not zoroastrianism ? 
  i 'm just gon na go off on a bit of a tangent here as something of a follow-up to your question . 
  because of the relatively hands-off approach to popular religion of the persian ruling class , iran and mesopotamia gave rise to an incredibly diverse religious landscape full of interesting gnostic and millenial movements like manichaeism ( although that did not end well for its founder ) , mandaeism ( which still exists today ) and many judaeic-like sects . 
  zoroastrian ( or perhaps we should say * iranian * ) influence was still very strongly noticeable , particularly in a metaphysical sense . 
  virtually all of the popular religious movements of the time had a strong dualistic nature , which seems to be an iranian concept . 
  although the orthodoxy of these various religious movements were not always too fond of the others ( for example , judaism is absolutely reviled in the mandaeic religious codices ) the archaeological material indicates that people happily borrowed from eachother and worshipped a variety of angels and demons that were probably not indigenous to their own spiritual background . 
  i 'm sort of projecting right now , but i get the strong impression that these various sects were not very strongly formalised . 
  when islam entered , and particularly after its solidification in the 9th-10th centuries many people must have converted . 
  this being said , there are probably still some traces of pre-islamic mesopotamian religion in contemporary islam , most visibly in shi'ism . 
  if you want to know more about this , you can read :,

  and of course the various articles in the [ encyclopedia iranica ] ( https://iranicaonline.org ) . 
  do you know russian ? 
  i could give you the link then , but it would n't make much sense anyway . 
  if you google vadim kadzhaev you can find some stuff about him in english ( :, 
  god forbid you actually enter into discussion with people you do n't agree with . 
  if anyone is interested in this , there is a [ long history ] ( http://www.pravapis.org/art_kitab1_en.asp ) of muslim tatars using the arabic script to wright various slavic languages , including polish , ruthenian , and belarussian . 
  when you know how to read the arabic script as well as the language used in the script , it makes for a really bizarre experience !, 
  it 's almost definitely from * / ay\u0161 lawnak / , `` what 's your colour '' or something similar . 
  / \u0161l\u016bn / as a general interrogative was probably reanalysed from there . 
  hey !, 
  you 're not wrong , and i talked to a lot of my friends on whether or not their `` interrogation '' was justified . 
  in their defense , there were some suspicious elements ( going in by ferry , having recently visited turkey ) and they were also very polite . 
  as my father pointed out , they were likely more curious than immediately suspectful , and i was n't treated with any agression . 
  a similar question about zoroastrianism was asked in a [ earlier post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/5bbyl3/playing_eu4_i_notice_i_can_easily_convert_people/ ) , which i also answered . 
  i ca n't help you with your question about pre-christian beliefs in europe though , sorry !, 
   i just wondered if the authoritative figures in their religion ever felt these additions were ` wrong ' in any sense . 
  yes . 
  to use an extreme example , the early quakers were so against the intrusion of pagan elements , that they even refused to used the common names for the days of the week , prefering to say `` first day , second day , third day , etc '' . 
  that 's just from the top of my head . 
  of course , there are plenty of modern-day christians that are very critical of the perceived commercialisation of christmas . 
  a simple google search will probably find you plenty of results . 
  i suppose it has something to do with how the tags were coded . 
  seeing how it 's an english-language game ( english having almost completely lost gender marking in nouns ) , i 'm not surprised the code was n't altered for the translations . 
  maybe someone that has looked at the code of the game can tell more about this , but i imagine that dynasty names and prepositions are stored separately : in english the preposition is always invariable , after all .
