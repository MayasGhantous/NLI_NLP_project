  i can imagine that it would take more effort to add another heap of conditions to account for :, 
  dynasty/country names beginning with a vowel, 
  dynasty/country names ' gender, 
  specific plural forms . 
  it 's definitely not impossible to implement ( and you can probably do it yourself ! ), 
  , but it would mean that these things would have to be recoded . 
  i 'm not surprised at all , but i agree , it looks somewhat messy . 
  excellent post . 
  as i 'm writing my master 's thesis on the arabian nights , there 's a few things i 'd like to add : it really depends on which version you 're reading . 
  most translations are based on the french version by galland , which -- although an excellent book in its own right -- only partially represents the arabic manuscripts . 
  this has less to do with choices in translations , it 's more that galland added stories that simply do not exist in the original . 
  burton 's `` translation '' is even worse in that sense , as he adds entire expressions that are not found in the original . 
  it is possible that later variations of the arabian nights were edited by more abstinent authors . 
  the translation i 'm reading was written by husain haddawy , and is based on the edition by muhsin mahdi ( which in turn was based on the earliest arabic manuscripts dated to the 14th-15th centuries ce ) and i have not yet found any instance in which any character refuses to or only reluctantly drinks alcohol . 
  that being said , i 'm about halfway now , so maybe i 'm yet to be surprised . 
  that being said , the linguistic and narrative character of the arabian nights makes it clear that it was meant for recitation for a wide , not necessarily educated audience . 
  this may indicate that consumption of alcohol was at best acceptable , and at worst tolerable . 
  irwin , r. ( 1994 ) -- * the arabian nights - a companion *, 
  heller-roazen , d. ( 2010 ) -- * the arabian nights * , trans . 
  i 'm not sure that i 'm breaking the rules of this sub now , but i 'll just go with it :, 
  i 'm not surprised your professor would say that !, 
  speaking from purely linguistic terms , the earliest material in our possession is not written in actual classical arabic nor in dialect , but something inbetween . 
  the exact nature of this variety of arabic is still under discussion , and is actually one of the major discussion points of my thesis . 
  with regards to content , some of the most famous stories do n't actually occur in the arabic originals either : the tale of aladdin and his lamp does not seem to have an arabic origin , and was likely added by galland . 
  then you have burton , who added all these weird fetishised and sexual elements to the story : make no mistake , there are very erotic actions described in the originals ( which is probably why al-nad\u012bm considered it `` vulgar '' ) , but burton 's obsessions with sex really shines through in his interpretation . 
  i 'm not so aware as to the degree to which native arab authors and critics edited these stories , although downplaying or re-interpreting the consumpion of alcohol seems to go pretty far . 
  i remember talking about s\u016bf\u012b poetry and the role of alcohol with muslim family members and friends , and they seem to assume that all references to alcohol are `` spiritual '' or `` symbolic '' . 
  this assumption was refuted during my first year in university when the subject was discussed in the lectures on sufism . 
  cool , this is totally up my alley !, 
  what 's also cool is that we have comparatively a lot of sources for a period of history and an area of the world that is characterised by a `` frustrating lack of sources '' ( g. rex-smith ) . 
  it is very difficult to accurately determine the relationship between the personal inclinations of rulers and their actions even today , and this problem becomes much larger when we try to extrapolate it to events more than a millennium ago . 
  moreover , to what degree can we separate religion from politics , especially in pre-modern pre-enlightenment societies ? 
  even nowadays , there are serious discussions on the degree to which islam as a belief and islam as a political ideal can be separated . 
  it 's likely that dhu nuw\u0101s did n't particularly like christians , but a lot more was going on . 
  let 's go back to the unification of yemen first :, 
  so you have to imagine that the history of yemen was characterised by four rival kingdoms : saba , hadramawt , qahtaban and mina . 
  they were frequently at war , although it is obvious that for the majority of this period the kingdom of saba was the most powerful . 
  this changed around the 2nd century bce , when they suffered a series of military setbacks and subsequently were seriously reduced . 
  this , in turn , led to increased decentralisation of the lands still under their control which allowed for the rise of a fair amount of tribes called the himyarites . 
  over the course of about four centuries ( !, 
  ) , this confederation was able to amass so much power that they subjugated and annexed every other kingdom in the area , projecting their power even to what is now northern saudi arabia . 
  the rise of the himyarites is significant , as it marked the first time in history that the entirety of yemen was united under a single power . 
  moreover , the historical data indicates that judaism had made faster and more successful inroads into south arabian culture than christianity . 
  across the straits of aden , the christian king of axum had quite openly declared himself a `` servant of christ '' and laid claim on lands under himyarite control . 
  you understand that this led to some degree of animosity between the two . 
  so by the beginning of the 6th century ce , relations between axum and himyarite yemen had turned rather sour . 
  it 's important to keep in mind that dhu nuwas ' predecessor was not as particularly anti-christian : although he executed some preachers for proselytisation , there was no indication of wide-spread persecutions . 
  more importantly , he exhibited strong pro-byzantine leanings , which was not acceptable for a large segment of the tribal aristocracy . 
  interestingly , nebes notes that the largest portion of support for dhu nuwas came from sabaean tribes whose influence had become diminished under himyarite rule . 
  around the same time , axum had already led a military intervention into south arabia , which did not do much to alleviate tensions . 
  so by the time dhu nuwas actually came to power , relations between the himyarites and axum had deteriorated immensely . 
  he proceeded to raze churches , massacre groups of christians and basically tried to provoke the axumites as much as possible . 
  to his credit , this worked : the king of axum led a full invasion , destroyed dhu nuwas ' armies and reduced yemen to a client state to be annexed some fifty years later after a final failed uprising . 
  ** tl ; dr : dhu nuwas represented an anti-axumite faction of himyarite society and his actions were mostly political **, 
  * recommended readings *, 
  hoyland , r. - * arabia and the arabs *, 
  nebes , n. - `` the martyrs of najran and the end of himyar '' in * the qur ' \u0101n in context * , ed . 
  as another poster ( u/ancienthistory ) pointed out , al-kalb\u012b 's * kit\u0101b al-asn\u0101m * is an important work . 
  he also pointed out some of the problems in using it as a primary source , but i would just like to add that the book was not that well-received even by other muslim scholars at the time . 
  i 'll have to look up the exact citations , however . 
  ** general overview **, 
  - hoyland , r. ( 2011 ) * arabia and the arabs : from the bronze age to the coming of islam * . 
  although it 's not a revolutionary book , hoyland still gives an indispensable overview of what we actually know from pre-islamic arabia . 
  ~ ~ hoyland goes from region to region , so you might have to check each chapter individually to see what he says about religion and beliefs . ~ ~ there is actually a chapter entitled `` religion '' , so it would make sense to look there !, 
  ( 1979 ) * the pantheon of palmyra * . 
  as you can see by the age , it 's already a bit dated , but still a fascinating read if you want to know more about the religious environment on the edges of arabia before islam . 
  - fischer , g. ( 2011 ) * between empires : arabs , romans , and sasanians in late antiquity * . 
  basically fischer talks about everything during the late classical period , and bases himself mostly on roman sources ( he himself indicates he 's not an arabist by training ) . 
  ** the peninsula **, 
  - crone 's `` the religion of the qur ` anic pagans '' and `` how did the qur ` anic pagans make a living '' are two articles which talk , as you can see , about how the mu\u0161rik\u016bn of the qur ` an are described . 
  these articles were recently integrated in a volume entitled * the qur ' \u0101nic pagans and related matters *, 
  - for southwest arabia you could try looking for articles written by norbert nebes and peter stein , although they more directly treat history and linguistics specifically . 
  there 's a lot more available material in french , if you can access that , mostly by christian robin , who has written really interesting stuff on the conversion of yemen to judaism and its relationship to the israelites . 
  i think that 's pretty much most i have in my head right now , and i think this will get you a long way . 
  if you really run out of stuff you can just respond to this post or drop me a pm . 
   `` you arabs are a bunch of idiots '' , he said . 
  i asked him why . 
  he said : `` because you was those who were the most beloved and noble amongst you , and then you put them in the ground for the earth and vermin to consume them ; whereas we burn them and in an instant they reach paradise '', 
  the quote above is from possibly the only primary source describing possible contact between muslims and vikings the well-known travelogue of ibn fadl\u0101n , who was sent as an ambassador to central asia . 
  it must be noted that the majority of the arabic sources that speak of the same subject are more interested in describing how they saw the vikings , rather than vice versa . 
  as far as i know , ibn fa\u1e0dlan 's * ri\u1e25la * is the only attestation of an actual conversation between muslims and vikings . 
  as we know , the vikings frequently travelled along the wolga river all the way down to the black sea ; a number of these were also enlisted in the byzantine varangian guard , which was entirely composed of norsemen . 
  however , the term encountered in the arabic sources ( * r\u016bs ( iyya ) * ) is not entirely free from ambivalence : james montgomery argues that the term was not applied for any specific group , but rather any peoples from the north engaging in trade and military activities . 
  regardless , there are some indications that ibn fa\u1e0dl\u0101n is indeed talking aobut vikings :, 
  it is likely that he a group of vikings somewhere in the area of modern-day astrakhan oblast , or at least somewhere along the volga river ( * wa ra\u02beaytu al-r\u016bsiyya wa nazal\u016b \u02bfal\u0101 nahri \u02beitil ) . 
  what 's particularly interesting about this encounter is that he gives an accurate description of viking burial rituals , which are corroborated by sources from the other side of europe ( perhaps an expert on viking expeditions in western europe can attest to this ? ) . 
  in any case , ibn fa\u1e0dl\u0101n of course mostly provides information as to how the vikings were seen by muslims , rather than the other way around . 
  it 's evident that muslim writers were intrigued by the liberal behaviour of vikings they encountered , particularly the civil independence of women and the openness with with sexual relations were conducted . 
  moreover , ibn fa\u1e0dl\u0101n was horrified by the lack of hygiene of the men he encountered , stating :, 
   `` they are the most filthy of god 's creations and do not wash themselves after defecating nor after sexual intercourse , nor do they clean their hands after they have eaten '', 
  from what i understand , this actually contradicts with what we know about vikings ; again , an expert on viking social customs should probably comment on this . 
  on a more positive note , ibn fa\u1e0dl\u0101n was very much impressed by the physique and strength of the men he encountered , stating that he `` had never seen more perfect physiques '' . 
  so what can we actually learn from this ? 
  there is next to nothing in ibn fa\u1e0dl\u0101ns * ri\u1e25la * apart from the initial quote i gave that describes how vikings saw muslims . 
  it 's possible that the vikings considered muslim tendencies towards ritual cleanliness and abstention from sex and alcohol to be ( x , y , z ) , but apart from a single comment about burial customs , we do n't really know much about viking perspectives on islam ( at least not from the islamic sources ) . 
  ** tl ; dr : vikings thought the muslim burying of people is cray-cray **,
