  the other one is `` how did the qur ` anic pagans make a living '' . 
  i 'll edit the main post as well . 
  cool , this question is totally my area . 
  i 'm not sure why you think classical arabic declined after the 9th century . 
  in fact , the 9th century was the period in which the first real grammars of classical arabic were being produced ; sibuwayh himself only died right at the end of the 8th century , and that 's pretty much the first grammar we have of arabic . 
  classical arabic was more or less continuously in use by muslim scholars , both from within the arabic world as outside until the nahda period , i.e. 
  the 18th century , until it was more-or-less replaced by modern standard arabic . 
  in any case , when you look at the history of classical arabic literature , it 's obvious that more-or-less the same standard was used up until the beginning of the 18th century ; al-mas ` \u016bdi ( 9th century ) , yaq\u016bt al-r\u016bm\u012b ( 13th century ) , and al-umawi ( 15th century ) all pretty much write in the same kind of language . 
  in other words , this decline never really took place . 
  that being said , there is a corpus of texts written in a form of arabic that is neither dialectal nor classical , and which is usually called middle-arabic . 
  a sizeable amount of texts , some of which were produced by authors otherwise fluent in classical arabic , are written in this kind of register and reflect a somewhat simplified form of classical arabic with a fair amount of substratal influence , both from the arabic dialects as well as from neighbouring languages . 
  we 're still trying to figure out what the nature of these texts is , exactly , but it 's apparent they do possess some kind of standard . 
  bear in mind that the majority of these texts can be classified as popular literature , so it would be extremely unlikely you would find texts of a religious nature amongst them . 
  to answer your question : the kind of writing you refer to , if written in arabic , would definitely be classical arabic and would attempt to at least reproduce the standard used by earlier muslim writers .

  cool question !, 
  note : i 'm primarily a philologist of arabic and my knowledge of hebrew is pretty much cursory , so i ca n't offer too much information on the history of judaism in arabia in general . 
  seeing the framing of your question in an * islamic * context , i think i can be of some help though !, 
  the biggest problem with our understanding of pre-islamic arabia up until the death of muhammad is that so much of it has been influenced by the islamic hagiographies . 
  as you understand , considering the theological implications , we risk entering an extremely controversial discussion . 
  it is important to realise that we possess extremely few primary sources from this period : even the constitution of medina , although very likely to have been composed during muhammad 's lifetime is only mentioned in sources written by -- you guessed it -- muslims . 
  all-in-all , considering the hagiographic and teleologic nature of these texts , we have to be extremely critical in assessing them . 
  now , moving on to the actual event itself : the massacre of the banu qurayzah is mentioned in ibn hi\u0161\u0101m 's * s\u012bra al-nab\u012b * ( or al-s\u012bra al-nabawiyya ) , which was based on an earlier work by ibn is\u1e25\u0101q , which is now lost . 
  it later appears in al-\u1e6cabari 's * \u1e6car\u012bkh al-rusul wa l-mul\u016bk * ( history of the prophets and kings ) , but this version too is based on ibn hi\u0161\u0101m 's version . 
  according to these sources , after the ban\u016b quray\u1e93a betrayed muhammad the latter laid siege upon their stronghold . 
  after about a month they surrendered unconditionally and subsequently 600 to 700 men were massacred and their bodies disposed of in a large trench . 
  it 's possible that this event is refered to in the quran ( 33:23 ; 8:55 -58 ) :, 
   he brought down those who supported him from the people of the book from their castles and cast fear in their hearts ; a number of them you killed and a number of them you took captive . 
   the worst of living creatures in the eyes of god are those who disbelieve , and they do not believe ( 56 ) -- those who allied you , then broke their alliance every time , they do not fear ( 57 ) so if you you victor over them in war , then disperse them so that they may remember . 
  ( 58 ) if you fear betrayal from a people then refuse their treaty ; indeed god does not love traitors . 
  in my understanding , the quran is extremely vague here and does not relate to any specific event . 
  as such , i 'm not entirely convinced that the specific event is mentioned in the qur ` an . 
  more strangely , such an event would likely not have gone unnoticed in the larger area : compare the massacre of na\u011fr\u0101n , which occured about a century earlier : it 's suggested that about 2 000 christians were killed in south arabia , which not only prompted the invasion of yemen by the christian kingdom of ethiopia , but is also corroborated by aramaic writings from syria as well as the qur ` an ( 85:4 -5 ) . 
  it seems very unlikely that the jewish coreligionists of the ban\u016b quray\u1e93a would have not mentioned this event at all . 
  incidentally , the first time this event is mentioned after muhammad 's death is during the islamic conquest of syria , in which this verse is used to justify the seizure of enemy lands . 
  in short , if we are to take the islamic sources for granted , it would mean that the complete extermination of an entire jewish tribe would have gone completely unnoticed in an already interconnected near east . 
  this seems to be incredibly unlikely .

  ** warning : personal opinion following ** :, 
  so what 's going on here ? 
  a few days ago i had a discussion with one of my professors , where we were discussing the sometimes outrageous events described in the early islamic sources . 
  i personally believe that many of these stories served to explain some of the more obscure or esoteric parts of the quran , which simply do not make sense without any context . 
  through folklore , which may either be original or based on earlier stories and expressly tying these to muhammad -- while in this case , simultaneously absolving him of this event by leaving the actual judgment to one of his companions -- a certain spiritual authority is added . 
  it must be mentioned that the muslim authors recounting these events were very much aware of this and used stylistic elements to expresse their scepticism : the verb * za\u02bfam\u016b * , ( ` they assert ; suppose ) as well as the expression * wa ll\u0101hu \u02bfalam * ( ` but god knows best ' ) are generally inserted when the authors want to stress the general unrelability of their sources ( see also khalidi , * islamic historiography : the histories of al-mas ` \u016bd\u012b . ), 
  for a lot of different reasons for which i do n't have the expertise -- nor the desire -- to get into , there 's a relatively small amount of contemporary literature produced by non-believers of islamic background * specifically * aimed at attacking islam . 
  a few come to mind : there 's someone called ibn warraq who has written anti-islamic polemics , as well as the relatively ayaan hirshi ali . 
  as i said , i 'm not really interested in the modern aspect , so let 's look at history , where things are much more interesting !, 
  i 'm going to take three examples : an individual atheist ( the blind philosopher-poet al-ma\u02bfarr\u012b ) , a social phenomenon ( qalandariyya ) and finally at anti-islamic polemics . 
  ** al-ma\u02bfrr\u012b **, 
  if memory serves me right , one of the first arab atheists who proclaimed himself as such was the 9th century writer al-ma ` arr\u012b , who was relatively radically anti-religious : for example , he denounced the islamic pilgrimage as being `` a pagan 's journey '' , was a strict vegetarian and is known for the following quote :, 
   there 's two kinds on the earth : those with reason and no faith ; and those with faith but no reason ( * ithn\u0101n f\u012b l-ar\u1e0d : dh\u016b l-\u02bfaql bil\u0101 d\u012bn ; dh\u016b l-d\u012bn bil\u0101 \u02bfaql * ), 
  although he was already at the time somewhat of a controversial person , he was also widely respected and he supposedly received large numbers of visitors to his house every day . 
  i wanted to use this example to show that even at the time , atheism was not unheard of , and that atheist poets and philosophers could even live safely and relatively comfortably . 
  a few centuries later , around the 12th century a group of wandering mystics called qalandariyya rose to prominence in the eastern part of the islamic world ( contemporary iran and afghanistan ) . 
  what 's fascinating about this group is that they were strongly sceptical of any outwards professions of faith : they reasoned that if overt displays of piousness was both hypocritical and blasphemous , as that meant a believer was not solely devoted to god , but also to his environment . 
  with this in mind , their main purpose was to provoke rejection from society and to this end , the qalandars started dressing and acting provocatively : they openly broke islamic laws , extolled christianity and zoroastrianism over other religions , exposed themselves and shaved all of their hairs ( including the eyebrows ) . 
  a good example of this antinominan behaviour comes from the poetry of baba taher ( more of his poetry [ here ] ( http://www.farsinet.com/poetry/babatahir1.html ) :, 
   i am the drunkard who people call a qalandar ;, 
   i have no home , no family , no shelter . 
   i spend my days wandering around your house ;, 
   at night i place my head on a stone, 
  as you can imagine , the qalandariyya were seen with some degree of suspicion by the authority -- which partially explains their tendency to keep on the move -- but actual persecution was rare . 
  ** anti-islamic polemics **, 
  finally , it 's important to mention the existence of anti-islamic polemics from non-muslim writers . 
  it can be argued that to a degree , poets like al-ma ` arr\u012b and mystics like the qalandars were still a part of the islamic fold . 
  so how were non-muslims treated when they expressed criticism of islam ? 
  interestingly , we possess very early documents from christian and jewish authors attacking islam . 
  it 's evident that there were some lively debates , as al-j\u0101hi\u1e93 writes about them , somewhat annoyed , in the 11th century . 
  although there 's no truly objective accounts , some christian texts do include muslim critiques of christianity , which probably indicates that there was a degree of mutual respect . 
  hoyland ( 1997 ) quotes :, 
   it is hoped you will treat us fairly in the discussion , and that you will negotiate as brothers who share in the goods they inheirt from their father . 
  all of them share in them . 
  nothing belongs to the inclusion of the other . 
  so we and you should be on a par in the discussion . 
  although it 's obvious that some core elements of their respective religions were impossible to surmount ( the problem of the trinity for muslims ; and the absence of muhammad in performing miracles for christians ) , it appears that there was a least a space for interreligious debate and polemics .

   interesting but using your reasoning , you 'd have to reject the large majority of history regarding early islam because it is naturally entirely written by muslims . 
  you 're not going to find any foreign sources regarding the battles of badr or uhud , etc. 
  and this isnt really controversial among muslims considering the account is in bukhari . 
  you 're absolutely right !, 
  in the case of yemen ( in which i 'm very interested ) , it 's even more frustrating : g. rex smith pointed out that the lack of written data from the pre-dynastic period makes it fairly hard to reconstruct the annexation of southwest arabia into islam , you know , outside of the hagiographies .
