  what 's more , absence of evidence does not necessarily imply evidence of absence . 
  for example , when * hagarism * was written , it was subjected to such a degree of well-founded criticism , that over time the authors agreed that much of their initial hypothesis was unable to be properly maintained . 
  that being said , i think it 's absolutely appropriate to treat these sources with a high degree of skepticism . 
  when we look at the trojan war , an event that happened in history , and take the greek retelling for fact , we would end up with an extremely skewed perspective on history . 
  in short , i do not discount the muslim tradition entirely ( which would be self-defeating ) , i just work under the assumption that a fair portion of it is embellished and exaggerated . 
  as a philosophically strong jeffersonian , i 'm not sure how to feel about this . 
  check back there regularly anyway . 
  i bought a really nice mandolin there about four years ago for about 90 eur ( :, 
  superinteressant !, 
  context : started out as pskov , by the late 1600s noticed that i only lacked zaporozia and halicz in order to form ruthenia ; managed to steal them both from under russia 's eye , culture shifted to ruthenian , tada !, 
  in arabic , they 're called * \u1e25ur\u016bf muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da ` \u0101t * , i.e. 
  `` disjointed letters '' . 
  as others have already pointed out , nobody really knows : some believe that they refer to some of god 's 99 names , others believe that they have some kind of numerological value , and so on , and so forth . 
  i believe the general consensus amongst muslim scholars is that they do n't know , hence the term `` mysterious letters '' . 
  edit : there is a pretty good overview of the different theories [ here ] ( https://thedisconnectedletters.wordpress.com/ ), 
  sure , why not : the idea being that some of these letters preceding various s\u016bras helped people remember earlier s\u016bras that discuss more or less the same subjects . 
  for example , al-shu ` ar\u0101 , al-naml , al-qasas and ta-ha all contain the letter \u1e6d\u0101 ( \u0637 ) , and all of these discuss moses ' encounter with pharaoh . 
  it 's not impossible , and i think in these cases there 's no one answer that is better than the other . 
  just one comment : although jesus definitely spoke a dialect of jewish palestinian aramaic , it is likely that he also spoke koin\u00e9 greek to some degree . 
  we have a pretty good idea of what jpa looked like , and ( neo - ) aramaic continues to be spoken as a native language in some parts of syria and turkey . 
  moreover , if i remember correctly , the first gospels can be dated to around five to seven decades after jesus ' death , which is roughly the same period as the first copies of the qur ` an . 
  scandinavia exists 0/10 . 
  nah just kidding , looks amazing !, 
  in my kurland runs i like to take revenge on denmark for the northern crusades by taking over all of scandinavia, 
  hm , i 've never really thought about this , but i 'm unaware if there are any other religious figures in the qur ' an , or generally in islamic literature whose _ nasab _ is taken from the mother rather than the father . 
  cool . 
  did his father ever become a muslim though ? 
  i would definitely ask this question on r/askhistorians . 
  sean martin is a great writer and film director , but as far as i 'm aware , he 's not a trained historian . 
  at the very least , some specialists can contextualize his statements . 
  this is a really interesting question , and although i 'm not entirely sure if i 'm completely equipped to answer this question , i think i can give you a succinct explanation as to what some of the reasons are for language death , particularly in reference to some other , comparable situations . 
  when you say `` successful '' , i assume that you mean `` alive '' rather than extinct . 
  the question relates to two particular subfields within linguistics : historical linguistics and sociolinguistics . 
  there is a general notion i need to adress first : the relationship between ethnicity and language is a tricky one , and not as straightforward as it is sometimes made out to be . 
  especially before the development of nationalism as a philosophy and art form in the 19th century , the language one spoke did not necessarily be an indication of ethnicity ( and when you think about it , neither is it now ) , and the relationship between the two seems to have mostly affected by practicality or prestige . 
  we 'll get back to this later as well . 
  it 's only at a later moment that language becomes a more important part of identity . 
  i 'm not a historian of the british isles at all , so maybe someone who knows more about that can tell you more about the historical context in which celtic-speaking areas were annexed by their respective overlords . 
  in the case of the british isles , this is by the english , who spoke a germanic language , and in the case of britanny by the french , who spoke a romance language . 
  when we get a map of europe in front of us , we can see that virtually all of the places where celtic languages are spoken ( with the exception of ireland , and arguably also the isle of man ) are governed by countries that have either a single non-celtic official language , such as french in the case of britanny ; or whose primary official language is non-celtic , such as english in the case of wales and scotland . 
  in short , celtic-language speaking areas have been under the control of non-celtic-language speaking powers for several centuries and up until about a millenium . 
  this is where the two factors i talked about earlier , namely practicality and prestige , come back into play , and historical linguists often refer to the two to talk about loanwords and language death . 
  firstly , there may be practical reasons to start speaking a new language : usually for economic purposes , such as to trade with other people , or out of or pure necessity , for example , in case of military drafting . 
  another reason is prestige : the language of the invader is associated with the elite , and learning it can increase chances of upwards social mobility ( this , for example , is likely what happened in egypt and the rest of north africa after the islamic conquest ) , or more negatively put : holding on to your own language diminishes social standing and can lead to persecution . 
  in the case of the celtic languages , french and english were the prestige languages ( known as superstrata ) . 
  considering these circumstances , it might be a lot more interesting to ask why these celtic languages did n't go extinct . 
  this can be partially explained through geography : regions where celtic languages are/were spoken were generally remote or difficult to access , such as the very tip of britanny or the outer hebrides in scotland , or the western part of county galway in ireland . 
  there was generally less contact with foreigners in these areas and hence fewer reasons to to learn different languages , let alone forego the first . 
  the sociolinguistic element of this question is strongly related to the rise and influence of nationalism , which starts to play a significant role within ethnic communities from the 19th century onwards , particularly in europe . 
  basically from the french revolution onwards , identity become more dependent on ethnicity , rather than religion , which also led to an increase of metalinguistic awareness . 
  in some cases , this was government-sponsored , such as in france , where increasingly intolerant linguistic policy from paris led to the virtual extinction of many minority languages in france . 
  some of these languages , such as lorrain , gascon or proven\u00e7al , could be considered dialects within the same linguistic continuum in france , or at the very least , were typologically closer to metropolitan french , and these disappeared rather quickly . 
  however , the non-indoeuropean language basque and the celtic language breton , which are typologically less similar to french , were less strongly affected by this policy . 
  however , some more ... passionate french nationalists may still insist that basque and breton are dialects of french . 
  on the other hand , nationalist sentiment in ireland , wales , and brittany has very much served to keep celtic languages alive in these places . 
  for example , in an 1886 essay , john fleming , editor of the gaelic journal , wrote the following :, 
   `` make yourself acquainted as well as you can with the industrial resources , the history , the language , and literature of the country . 
  you will then be a patriot , and able to serve the country . '', 
  ** in short ** , the survival of the celtic languages in these places can be attributed to a number of factors , including geographical and social ones . 
  i would kindly ask a historian of these areas to provide a more appropriate context for these specific regions .

  this is a great response , thank you very much !, 
  i was just wondering if you 're aware of any mosques standing to this day , which are now used for other purposes ? 
  nah , i would n't worry about it .

  someone else , u/velostodon , already replied to this question , so i 'm going to formulate my answer in a way that , in a way , is more of an answer to his . 
  although his answer is very consise and to-the-point , i feel that it overlooks many of the very interesting developments in early islam as well as in early medieval shi\u02bfism , and i disagree strongly with the notion that sunni islam must be considered the `` natural '' form and shi\u02bfa islam the `` exception '' . 
  if you feel that i mischaracterize you , then i apologize . 
  let 's get started :, 
  ** i - the catalyst : martyrdom of the forefathers **, 
  u/velostodon starts by referring to the rashidun caliphate , which consisted of four elected rulers ( abu bakr , \u02bfumar , \u02bfuthm\u0101n and \u02bfal\u012b ) and mentions the split between the sunnis and shi\u02bfa 's from the start , stating that the conflict arose due to a disagreement whether \u02bfali or ab\u016b bakr should have been the first caliph . 
  this is mostly accurate : although there was a sizeable faction in the early community that argued that \u02bfali should be the prophet 's successor , the majority voted for abu bakr . 
  in shi\u02bfi historiography it is often mentioned that the decision was rushed through while \u02bfal\u012b was attending to mu\u1e25ammad 's corpse , but the writings detailing this mention from the second century after the fact , so it 's impossible to establish if this actually happened . 
  either way , it is said that \u02bfal\u012b did not contest abu bakr 's election . 
  what is important to note , however , is that the majority of \u02bfal\u012b 's supporters came from the so-called * \u02bean\u1e63\u0101r * ( ` the helpers ' ) and some of the very earliest muha\u011fir\u016bn who had come with mu\u1e25ammad to mad\u012bna : they represented the kind of muslim with unimportant or no tribal affiliation ( such as ex-slaves ) or arabs with little social standing . 
  ab\u016b bakr 's claim was maintained by the establishad tribes of mecca , some of whom had until very recently opposed mu\u1e25ammad , even violently . 
  the \u02bean\u1e63\u0101r , perhaps justifiably , feared that the meccan aristocracy would turn the situation in their favour . 
  however , what is important to note is that at this point , the situation was still wholly political . 
  the situation only started to gain a spiritual dimension when \u02bfal\u012b rose to power : his predecessor , \u02bfutm\u0101n , was assassinated by a group of disgruntled egyptians . 
  due to his considerable tribal affiliations , his cousin mu\u02bf\u0101wiya insisted that \u02bfal\u012b would execute his assassins . 
  however , \u02bfal\u012b was already in a politically weak position , as the majority of his support came from egypt , as well as from southern iraq . 
  his refusal to do so led to open rebellion on mu\u02bf\u0101wiya 's part , who was already governor of syria at the time , and who gained support from mu\u1e25ammad 's famous widow , aisha . 
  at this time , most historians prefer to use the term '' \u02bfalids '' or `` proto-shi\u02bfites '' , as they were a relatively diverse group with no particularly established orthopraxy . 
  after a short skirmish in iraq , mu\u02bf\u0101wiya and \u02bfal\u012b declared a truce . 
  at this point , a sizeable portion of \u02bfal\u012b 's supporters left him , arguing that mu\u02bf\u0101wiya 's rebellion had turned him into an non-believer ( * k\u0101fir * ) , as \u02bfal\u012b had been divinely appointed . 
  \u02bfal\u012b 's compromise with a non-believer meant that he lost his divine mandate . 
  this group was henceforth known as the * \u1e2b\u0101ri\u011fiyya * ( ` those who went out ' ) , and would continue to wreack havoc on the islamic world for the next two centuries . 
  the rest of \u02bfal\u012b 's life was rather miserable : he was no longer in control of some of the richest areas of the caliphate and his legitimacy amongst his followers was severely diminished . 
  for the next six years he lived in k\u016bf\u0101 , until one of his ex-followers stabbed him with a poisoned dagger as he was praying , dying two days later . 
  the caliphate was now firmly in control of mu\u02bf\u0101wiya , who was able to rule in relative peace for a decade or so , although his governance was never really accepted by \u02bfal\u012b 's earlier supporters . 
  he was able to bribe al-\u1e24asan , who was \u02bfal\u012b 's oldest son , from rebelling against him ; although the shi\u02bfi sources prefer to mention that \u1e24usayn was being a pacifist . 
  two years before mu\u02bf\u0101wiya 's own demise however , al-\u1e24asan died suddenly in mecca ( of course , the shi\u02bfi sources blame mu\u02bf\u0101wiya for this ) . 
  \u1e24usayn , who was al-\u1e24asan 's brother and successor , was not as content with mu\u02bf\u0101wiya 's governance , and there is a famous letter transmitted by shi\u02bfi historians that describe some of their interactions ( al-tus\u012b ; * kit\u0101b al-iqtir\u0101\u1e25 * ( c. 1150 ) ) :,
