   i know not of any trial ( fitna ) to the muslim community greater than your governance ; not in the eyes of my soul , nor my faith , nor in that of mu\u1e25ammad 's community ; nor is anything better for me than to strive against you . 
  doing this would surely be pleasing in the eyes of god . 
  [ ... ] know , oh mu\u02bf\u0101wiya , that god ( the most exalted ) in his reckoning does not ignore the great nor the small , he merely counts them . 
  god 's supporters will make war unto you , and they will cast you from your house into exile ; and those people who support your son , a drunk slaveboy who plays with dogs , will know nothing of you , except that you have lost your soul , destroyed your faith , misled your people , and ruined your trustworthiness by listening to the words of insolent ignoramuses , having killed your piety on their account . 
  as you can see from \u1e24usayn 's letter , mu\u02bf\u0101wiya 's wrongdoing were considered both religious and secular ;, 
  the pot boiled over when mu\u02bf\u0101wiya appointed his son yaz\u012bd as successor , the first time a muslim ruler had attempted to create dynastic rule , and when mu\u02bf\u0101wiya passed away , it finally led to another open revolt . 
  \u1e24usayn was invited to come to iraq , and having set out from mad\u012bna , he was set upon by one of yaz\u012bd 's armies and was killed in the following battle near karbal\u0101 , iraq . 
  this event is extremely important for shi\u02bfites and \u1e24usayn 's death is commemorated every year on the 10th of mu\u1e25arram . 
  we 've so far discussed the historical events underlying the causes for the shi\u02bfi - sunni split . 
  so how did they affect the regular joes , or in our case , the regular mu\u1e25ammads ? 
  we do have contemporary descriptions that mention how people were uncomfortable with choosing either side , as this could mean the difference between life in paradise and eternity in hell . 
  these descriptions often mention the terms d\u012bn \u02bfal\u012b and d\u012bn mu\u02bf\u0101wiya . 
  those who know arabic will realize that the term d\u012bn means ` religion ' , and although this is correct , there is no indication that there were any serious theological differences between the two groups . 
  at this point , we 're really still just talking about political affiliation mainly . 
  so when did these theological differences begin to get noticeable ? 
  well , at this time ( 680-750 ) , islam was really still in its infancy and there were varying ideas about what it meant to be a muslim , and it is only during the 8th century that there was an increasing necessity to canonize the islamic religious material . 
  now the qur\u02be\u0101n is a relatively stable source , even despite minor variations between some of the earliest manuscripts , which are by no means large enough to warrant serious confusion . 
  however , the qur\u02be\u0101n is sometimes vague and open to interpretation ( as is really any significant religious text ) , so it requires a degree of supplication that can tell you how to about life 's details . 
  at this time , the * \u1e25\u0101d\u012bth * ( ar.pl . 
  * \u02bea\u1e25\u0101dith * ) literature had not yet been canonized , and extremely varying stories about the prophet 's life and his companions were running wild . 
  the islamic tradition tells us there were people you could pay who would fantasize a hadith on the spot , if it would fit your needs . 
  simultaneously , there were all kinds of religious and spiritual movements : milleniarist groups and gnostic cults , as well as persianiate imperial cults . 
  what 's fascinating to see is that in shi\u02bfa islam , many of these elements became incorporated : the concept of n\u016br mu\u1e25ammad , the idea that the descendants of mu\u1e25ammad carry in them a kind of light which bestows on them the divine right to rule is an important aspect of justified rulership in shi\u02bfa theology , which is remarkably close to persian ideas about rule . 
  the milleniarist aspect is visible in the shi\u02bfa notion of the hidden imam , who is prophesized to return on the day of judgment ( and he is supposed to have come several times already ) ; the isma\u02bfili tradition has a concept of hidden ( b\u0101\u1e6din ) and visible ( \u1e93\u0101hir ) knowledge , which is a possible influence from gnostic religions , such as manichaeism . 
  around the same time , the established clergy in places like damascus and samarr\u0101 were attempting to canonize islam , partially in order to establish a kind of religious dominance , but also to be able to answer the claims and critiques of jewish , christian , and zoroastrian polemics . 
  i would say they were fairly successful in doing so : shi\u02bfites and sunnis agree about the majority of what is considered trustworthy \u1e25ad\u012bt literature , even if they disagree on the exact interpretation ( for an example of this , see the one about mu\u1e25ammad 's last sermon : the shi\u02bfites argue that he appointed \u02bfal\u012b his successor , sunnis are more like ` nah ' ) . 
  however , we can notice serious differences in the way the different movements gathered support : the \u02beumayyad clerics in the urban centres relied strongly on the prophetic narration and tradition , and had the support of the state , whereas the proto-shi\u02bfites were able to rally support from the common people , especially from recent converts . 
  ** iii - the middle ages and beyond **, 
  so by the end of the 9th century , we can definitely talk about a difference between sunni and shi\u02bfa islam : most importantly , sunnis argue that rulership is based on merit ; shi\u02bfites argue that rulership is hereditary and a divine right . 
  at this time , however , things were starting to develop in interesting directions : there were already different branches of the shi\u02bfa , mostly regarding to which im\u0101m they follow , and would continue to split off until the 11th century , but i do n't really want to focus on that . 
  what is much more interesting is the collapse of the umayyads in 750 . 
  i 'm not going to detail the reasons for the collapse as that is well-described enough on wikipedia , but let 's look at the result : the rebels were largely reliant on \u02bfalid / shi\u02bfite help in order for the umayyad dynasty to fall , and they expected that their assistance would be rewarded by putting a member of \u02bfal\u012b 's family on the throne . 
  when that did n't happen , the \u02bfalid movement as a whole became a lot more quietist , as they had mostly given up hope for direct political leadership . 
  the shi\u02bfi sources describe this event as `` the great betrayal '' , so it 's fair to say they were pretty salty about all of it . 
  rather , shi\u02bfism developed in a much more insular direction : rather than trying to gain political power directly , they worked ( in the case of the isma\u02bfilis ) through a system of pseudo-clandestine missionaries . 
  they were particularly effective in north africa , amongst the berber tribes of tunisia and algeria , as well as in places like northwest iran and azarbaijan . 
  it was in these places that shi\u02bfite dynasties rose to power and were able to come in control of huge parts of the islamic world : the berber fatimids were able to expand from tunisia all the way into egypt and the levant while the shi\u02bfa kurdish buyids were able to gain control over the majority of iran and iraq . 
  we tend to think of the shi\u2018a as a minority group , which right now is certainly accurate , but it is a historical fact that in the 10th century , the vast majority of the islamic world was firmly under shi\u2018ite control . 
  the ` abbasid caliph was nominally still in power , but his authority did not really stretch beyond the palaces of baghdad and samarra , to the point that he was effectively a vassal of the shi\u2018i buyids . 
  meanwhile , in egypt , the fatimids were able to do what they please , going as far as cursing the names of ` umar and ` uthman , as well as that of the ` abbasid caliph in their friday prayers . 
  it is also interesting that contemporary muslim writers were complaining about the state of affairs : however , they were more concerned with the fact that that the buyids were persians than shi\u02bfites , which indicates that religious allegiance was not considered as important as ethnic or cultural affiliation . 
  however , u/velostodon is absolutely right when he says that the shi\u2018ites did n't convert anyone , and it is definitely an interesting thing to think about . 
  this is probably because they had no good reason to : even nowadays , orthopraxy is arguably more important than orthodoxy , and the shi\u2018ite rulers of egypt and iran did not see any need that their citizens believed the exact same things they did . 
  more practically , attempting to forcefully convert their population could well lead to open rebellion . 
  it must be mentioned that the population of iran was sunni-majority until the safavids converted them in the 16th century ce . 
  lastly , it should be mentioned that shi\u2018ite quietism lasted well into the 20th century : not only did shi\u2018ite theologians acknowledge a kind of separation between secular and religious power , they actively eschewed seeking political positions . 
  when ruhollah khomeini revitalized the idea of wilayat al-faq\u012bh ( ` governance of the ( islamic ) jurist ' ) , he was nearly assassinated . 
  it certainly led to a split within the religious community in iran , some of whom were violently opposed to the notion of an ayatollah holding political power . 
  to summarize : in the earliest period of islam , there were no significant theological differences between sunni and shi\u02bfa islam , as these only started to form by the latter half of the 8th century , and crystallized over the following centuries . 
  shi\u02bfite rulers did not proselytize , either because it was not desirable politically or necessarily spiritually . 
  shi\u02bfa islam was generally quietist up until the beginning of the 20th century .

  adding to the discussion about ` aladdin : it 's true that none of the arabic of the the arabian nights contain the story of ` aladdin . 
  what 's more , some of the arabian nights ' most famous stories , such as ali baba and sindbad the sailor do not actually occur in the arabic manuscripts . 
  the first european translator of the stories , antoine galland , likely added stories to the manuscripts he translated , for the simple reason that they did not contain enough material to actually fill a thousand-and-one nights . 
  according to galland 's own diary , there was a christian arab from aleppo by the name of hanna diy\u0101b , who served as his informer . 
  for more information , see [ www.ejournals.eu/pliki/art/7639/] ( braide , e. * christian arabic and garshuni versions of sindbad the sailor ), 
  this is such a cool question , but it 's rather complicated to answer and it also a pretty controversial topic , particularly amongst religious non-drinking muslims . 
  i also generally focus on other things , but i 've found several references to alcohol and alcohol consumption in my studies , so i 'm gon na take a shot at it either way . 
  i 'm pretty sure someone knows much more about it than me , though . 
  the short answer is : the state generally ** did n't really care ** who was consuming what . 
  the long answer is below :, 
  firstly , there is no such thing as ` the islamic civilization ' . 
  already directly following the islamic conquest you notice that islamic societies take on an extremely diverse character , and what may have been practiced in morocco could well be considered heresy in iraq , or vice versa . 
  this also directly affected the way different rulers interacted with things nominally considered forbidden or taboo , such as the ( public ) consumption of alcohol . 
  either way the production and consumption of alcohol in islamic societies , particularly amongst the elite , goes back pretty much until the founding of islam itself . 
  i 'm going to look at several different things , firstly , about what the islamic tradition itself says about the consumption of alcohol , then i 'm going to look at how alcohol is portrayed in the literary sources , and then i 'm going to discuss what we actually know about its consumption . 
  it is generally held that the qur\u02be\u0101n forbids alcohol outright . 
  this is definitely a position found amongst many muslims nowadays , but the phrasing itself is ambiguous enough to warrant a degree of interpretation . 
  in any case , the qur\u02be\u0101nic citations were not considered an immediate prohibition ( not in the earliest phases , at any rate ) . 
  moreover , the qur\u02be\u0101n also refers to `` rivers of wine '' in its description of paradise , so * \u1e2bamr * was not necessarily seen as a bad thing per se . 
  in the * \u1e25ad\u012bth * literature , however , the tone is dominantly negative : i just googled for \u1e25ad\u012bts on alcohol ( in arabic ) , and they all condemn all sorts of alcohol consumption , even the smallest quantities . 
  however , as roger allen pointed out : `` there is considerable debate as to the precise definition of \u1e2bamr '' , and it is from the earliest moments that we know of disagreement within the islamic community regarding to what could and could not be considered \u1e2bamr . 
  some people brought up the issue of spirits , which was considered to be the same as \u1e2bamr by all legal schools , except the \u1e24anafis . 
  in any case , there were many long discussions about the exact definitions of what kinds of drink fall under the ( post - ) qur\u02be\u0101nic ban on * \u1e2bamr * , but as we all know , there are generally differences between what is proscribed and what people actually do . 
  we know that people throughout the islamic world consumed alcohol . 
  how do we know this ? 
  well , firstly , there 's a good deal of arabic poetry that deals directly with the consumption of wine . 
  a particularly fine example of wine poetry was composed by the third umayyad caliph , al-wal\u012bd b. yaz\u012bd ( translation roger allen ) :, 
   cast off hidden cares with frivolity ; thwart fate by enjoying the daughter of the grape, 
  how i long to drink from a maid of noble descent on her wedding-day, 
  resplendent in her jewels , wondrous to behold, 
  as though her glass contained a firebrand gleaming in her eye, 
  there 's a really long article on * \u1e2bamriyy\u0101t * poetry in the encyclopedia of islam as well , and the aforementioned allen also spends some time talking about it in his introduction to arabic literature . 
  secondly , the 15th century arabic-language manuscripts of the arabian nights contains a quaint little story of the porter and the three maids , who embark on a raunchy sex adventure facilitated by a copious amount of alcohol consumption . 
  they are later joined by the caliph har\u016bn al-ra\u0161\u012bd ( of * civilization iv * fame ) , which tells us something about how alcohol was perceived by the general population , generally as something * awesome * . 
  in any case , the consumption of wine is attested for more or less every period in islamic history : it got a particular importance amongst s\u016bf\u012b orders from the 13th century onward , the idea being that the consumption of alcohol and the resulting stupor could bring them closer to god . 
  it is sometimes said that the wine-verses of the sufi poets must be taken metaphorically , and there is definitely a lot of mystical subtext in sufi poetry , but considering the large scale on which alcohol was being consumed , this is probably more an indication of historical whitewashing than anything else . 
  in any case , here 's a piece of poetry from the 13th century mystic \u02bfumar b. al-far\u012bd ( d. 1235 ) ( translation allen ) :, 
   in remembrance of the beloved we drank a wine through which we became drunk before the vine was ever created, 
  for a cup it has a full moon ; it is a sun circle by a new moon ; when it is mixed , how many a star appears !,
