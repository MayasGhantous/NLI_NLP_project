  ahem http://teevox.com/ is quite similar :3, 
  but yea it 's obvious they 've put some sweet effort into their viewer :d, 
  give up, 
  discovered the same thing when the latest patch went live , not sure if it was before also , i did n't come up with as elegant abuse as that guy did but still : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc0boieu198, 
  edit : apparently it 's been around for ages just they have n't done anything about it : /, 
  edit 2 : possible that the same bug was used in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-qsvcouf6k and maybe other vids by him just the client made to `` think '' that he 's standing on a inventory station ?

  dieing on my birthday i guess ? 
  not really accomplished anything in my 21 years and 364.25 days of living, 
  why would i get rid of it ? 
  it does everything i do . 
  everything will be twice as efficient . 
  repairing a car will turn into repairing 2 , tearing down a wall will go twice as fast etc.

  nice .

  there was a similar accident this year during the vln endurance series, 
  ** [ nsfw ] ** one person died . 
  i mostly follow f1 but yea and if i 'm not mistaken the limits were already lifted and they are doing safety improvements to the track . 
  edit : looking it up they will be lifted in 2016 when the improvements are done . 
  print head , i doubt they are using laser printer , most likely direct thermal or thermal transfer printer . 
  but yes the head needs to be either cleaned or replaced if it 's damaged . 
  most likely yea , but i have seen some recipe printers use thermal transfer though too , i actually have one laying in my office that i need to throw away . 
  i 've used it to make a straight cut a few times but no . 
  well i do use it to keep some papers pinned to the side of the computer case at work . 
  but as a ruler it is absolutely useless .
