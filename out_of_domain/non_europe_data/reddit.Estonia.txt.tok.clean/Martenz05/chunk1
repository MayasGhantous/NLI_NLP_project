it might actually go over better than you think in easter europe , especially if it successfully puts a stop to russian aggression . 
  the various energy giants and other western europe companies that have profitable relationships with russian oil , though ? 
  they 'll only accept it if they run out of other options . 
  considering how medvedev awarded russian journalists and news anchors with medals for their contributions in the georgian conflicts ... 
  i 'm going to go with the conclusion that the propaganda aspect of the conflict was actually more important than the military aspect , and russia did win the war decisively enough to dictate what goes into the history books . 
  theoretically speaking , natural selection should eventually kick in and cause the shitty people that invariably rise to power to stop being shitty out of basic self-preservation . 
  of course , this implies that the democratic process continues to function and the people doing the brutal murdering do n't try to take power themselves . 
  * oh , and interestingly enough , the solution could theoretically work for both ` murica ( which this has somehow devolved to ) as well as india . 
  even worse , it seems that u.s. intelligence agencies are having an institutional , self-perpetuating power trip , rather than simply a select few individuals , whose power trips would end with their retirement . 
  well , it 's not like there 's no precedent for this kind of behavior from wg . 
  just look at the marder . 
  the nerfed it about five times , then it got shafted by physics and started getting stuck on anything remotely uneven and then they nerfed it a few more times for good measure . 
  while russian tanks remain protected from direct nerfs and only get hit when global game mechanics are changed . 
  i 'm pretty sure they do , given that i 've bought five rpg rulebooks from them . 
  while they do n't advertise it , ludo does order specific books for interested customers , if you are willing to wait a month or three . 
  and it 's still cheaper than amazon shipping . 
  huh . 
  alright , thanks for the advice . 
  i guess i 'll just abandon the line for the time being and focus entirely on grinding toward the leo 1 . 
  noticed a subtle mistake on the final version . 
  ` p\u00f5rand on plekist ' -  ` p\u00f5randal on plekk ' would be the correct way of saying ` on the floor is a stain ' . 
  but if you want to use elative , then ` p\u00f5rand on plekist ' does have a different meaning - ` the floor is made of tin ' would be the literal meaning of that sentence , rather than ` the floor is made of stain ' . 
  ah ... so this is why i keep getting ` lucky ' snap shots as arty ? 
  yeah , they definitely need to do something about that . 
  the tiger i definitely does n't belong on the front line . 
  using hp as armor is just playing to lose . 
  then again , i agree that camping with a tiger is also a waste of its ' potential . 
  through trial and error while grinding the tank , i 've developed a strategy that 's more or less effective with the tiger i , but i 'm having a really hard time coming up with a concise description of it . 
  after several minutes , the best i 've come up with , is that the tiger is a great frontline tank later in the game ; if the tiger is at full hp while the enemies are on low health . 
  but just exchanging alpha shots with russian tanks from the very start just does n't work . 
  at the time the tiger was first introduced , i think they were . 
  although the tiger did become obsolete before the war ended . 
  the allied tiger-equivalents ( m26 pershing and is-2 ) were only entering service ( both in early 1944 ) around the same time the germans were already phasing the tiger i out of service ( production stopped in august 1944 ) . 
  i did the same thing at one point , but an off-hand comment by quickybaby made me reconsider . 
  i now ( try to ) think of it like this : the win chance % is n't an indicator of whether or not i 'm going to win . 
  it 's an indicator of how hard i will have to try and carry . 
  edit : a word, 
  after some google magic , i 've come up with * `` d\u017euudopoisid '' * ( 1985 ) by janno p\u00f5ldma . 
  english translation of the title would be * `` judo boys '' * . 
  have n't been able to find an isbn code for the book . 
  i 've also discovered there is a 2007 reprint . 
  checked for typos . 
  there are none . 
  but it looks like the problem is with the provice files , rather than with the strategic resources themselves . 
  now that i think back on it , i vaguely remember connecting the custom strategic resources to icons in a file other than strategic.resources.txt . 
  perhaps that 's why it crashes . 
  going to dig a bit more , go through the filenames and see if something jogs my memory . 
  i know it can work , i 've done it before and it 's frustrating that i ca n't remember . 
  after some digging , i managed to get it working . 
  added additional entries to interface/mapitems . gfx and strategic_resources . gfx . 
  copied uranium entry and renamed the ` name ' line to `` gfx_cheat_xyz '' . 
  works now , resources present and game does n't crash on load . 
  found another report in estonian media . 
  strelkov ( or an account in his name ) had recently been bragging on vkontake ( russian fb ) about the separatists having buk-missiles and shooting down a ukrainian military transport plane . 
  after the news of mh-17 's dissappearance broke , the posts were removed and the separatists now insist that the vkontakte page it was posted on was made by fans , rather than strelkov himself . 
   good point especially given both the uk and us governments ( just off the top of my head , there 's probably others ) have been traced the same way doing the same thing . 
  which is why there are twitter bots detecting wiki edits from us and uk governments as well . 
  there 's a difference between actual intelligence operatives ( who have better things to do anyway ) , and low-level propaganda grunts who are trying to show to their boss that yes , they are doing something to earn their salary . 
  the edit did originate from a static ip belonging to russian media , not from a russian government agency . 
  let 's see ... 
  * tiger 1 , because it 's awesome ( subjective rose-tinted tank nerd glasses . 
  do n't bother arguing ), 
  * alecto , because it can derp anything to death if it 's top tier, 
  * cruiser ii , because it can derp almost anything even if it is n't, 
  * possibly at-2 because of it 's troll armor . 
  still grinding through this one , though . 
  * pziii , because it 's a lot like the pz1c , except a bit harder to one-shot . 
  there 's just one problem . 
  putin needs the oil and gas money to keep his people happy . 
  ` his people ' meaning the oligarchs backing him behind the scenes . 
  if his actions start hurting their profits enough , then one day , long before there 's a public revolution , putin will be ` persuaded ' to retire and replaced by someone who the west is willing to work with again . 
  actually , i read a news snippet couple of months ago that basically said that putin believe it 's his responsibility to arrange a new marriage for his ex-wife . 
  russian culture , go figure . 
  this is a problem with expense scaling in agriculture , actually . 
  while i 'm not an expert on agriculture , i have studied small business management and agriculture was given as a classical example of expense scaling . 
  one lesson i learned , is basically that it 's really , really hard to turn a profit in agriculture . 
  there 's a minimum amount of farmland/herd size you need to have even a chance at being profitable , and this varies depending on climate and local labor costs . 
  machines are expensive to maintain and manual labor , while cheaper , is also not as cost-effective as the scale of production increases . 
  the cheapness of manual labor is also a subjective term in developed countries , while the running costs of machines do n't increase as much as you go from 10 % capacity to 100 % . 
  you either have to pay wages that are n't competitive ( or possibly even legal ) , move the production to a country with cheaper labor costs or produce massive quantities , so that the running costs of your machinery become negligible compared to your turnover . 
  the last option seems like the most optimal , until you realize that the quantities required are so massive you 'll never be able to sell everything before it spoils . 
  so , in order to keep farmers in business ( and in their own country ) , government pay subsidies to agricultural companies , to make up for the excess production . 
  i know there are some questions unanswered ( such as why excess production still needs to happen with subsidies ) , but i 'm probably not the best person to answer them . 
  like i said , i studied small business management , not agriculture . 
  bert platoon ... some shaky , but still competitive platoons in the current matchup ... 
  honestly , i 'm not seeing anything special . 
  everyone gets teamwork fails from time to time . 
   thats a pretty old way of thinking though . 
  does n't mean that it 's wrong , though . 
  not every social change is progress . 
  though coming from putin ( or any russian ) , it 's very blatant hypocrisy , considering how they refuse to integrate in the countries they consider ` near abroad ' . 
  but there 's nothing a kv-2 loves more than a tog . 
  i 'm certainly not arguing that immigrants should n't be allowed to speak their own language among themselves . 
  i 'm arguing that immigrants should respect the culture and language of the country that they choose to migrate to . 
  that includes learning how to speak the local language , rather than demanding that all locals learn to speak their language . 
  this is less of a problem in the us , but very much a problem in eastern europe , where former soviet republics have sizable soviet-introduced russian minorities which russia wants to ` protect ' from alleged ` fascists ' . 
  except for one problem . 
  russian culture ** is not ** at risk of being eradicated . 
  russian culture exists in russia , and will continue to exist there regardless of its ' status in latvia ( or any other russian neighbor ) . 
  latvian culture , on the other hand , does n't really exist outside of latvia and ** is ** at risk of being completely eradicated due to various demographic and social processes .
