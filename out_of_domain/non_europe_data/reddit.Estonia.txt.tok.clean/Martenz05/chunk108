  in my personal headcanon , * thus the jsdf fought there * is an absurd fanfic of * here we go again * , written by a 2chan nationalist that did n't like filthy american gaijin being involved in the story . 
  car from the uk to anywhere is complicated , because the steering is on the wrong side . 
  i know people in estonia who had a lot of trouble getting a uk car declared road legal . 
  there was a rumor at one point about his wife and his wife 's son being threatened , unless he backed up hillary 's campaign after being cheated out of the primary win . 
  i 've never been a bernie supporter . 
  i went from undecided to trump supporter about two weeks before he won the primary . 
  and i 'm not denying sanders fucked his followers . 
  i 'm just suggesting he probably did n't give in to team shillary 's pressure out of greed . 
  considering many of bernie 's plans basically hinged on `` let 's make successful white people pay more taxes '' for the funding , i can kind of get the animosity toward him . 
  he was all about socialist-style redistribution of wealth , which is not a sustainable solution to anything . 
  it basically rewards people for failing at life , while punishing legitimate success alongside immoral money-grabbing . 
  hillary 's stance on this is very much cynical : given a path to citizenship and welfare , immigrants and refugees are very likely to vote democrat over republican . 
  it 's a conscious effort by the democratic establishment to change the composition of the voting population in a way that guarantees they always have majority . 
  bows and arrows remained relevant in europe as a hunting tool long after guns made them obsolete on the battlefield . 
  especially since nobility did n't want the peasantry to be armed with guns that would put them on par with soldiers equipment-wise . 
  this is why `` fletcher '' remained a job that was relevant among peasants until social order got to the point that surnames among commoners became a thing . 
  as for being impressed by the locals ' skill , i 'd say it was more about being impressed with their presumed ability as hunters , not their prowess as warriors or as an army . 
  i 'm fairly certain the retreat behavior is to retreat to the ** nearest ** node point . 
  there should be other node points in the system . 
  if you move toward them ( and away from the enemy fleet ) before pressing the retreat button , your fleet should retreat through those . 
  and have you tried sots2 ? 
  it fixes a lot of the issues you describe , and most of the bugs have also been fixed . 
  even if there are a few orphaned features that lack the depth to make them interesting , such as the government alignment system . 
  it 's still a very playable game despite its ' shortcomings . 
  honestly , at that point , i 'd be thinking more like `` giant pile of gemstones that my character can jump into '' . 
  or `` how long will it take me to fill breezhome with gems '' . 
  the eeoc 's guidelines *** should *** be made more stringent . 
  but for reasons of political correctness and ideological pressure for multiculturalism , this is n't being done . 
  if any politician tried , they 'd instantly be branded an islamophobe and ostracized out of office , regardless of the legitimacy of the issue described above . 
  no , it 's unlikely to be an intentional , organized effort to cripple the economy . 
  rather , it 's just an effort to get more money for themselves through hoping frivolous lawsuits stick . 
  and islamic communities are far closer-knit that those of majority religions . 
  they do coordinate statements and accusations based on what provides success and what does n't . 
  for something similar : see refugees memorizing instruction pamphlets of what they have to say and do to officials to be granted refugee status . 
  things like destroying their passports and claiming to be underage , for instance . 
  anyone else notice the lack of ctr shill tweets lately ? 
  are they all asleep ? 
  did they already run out of money ? 
  or have they just completely given up on astroturfing everything they ca n't use the low-hanging `` conspiracy theory '' accusation against ? 
  let me make this absolutely clear :, 
  #just because hillary 's crushed does n't mean any of you are allowed to be low energy on election day !, 
  well yeah . 
  i love the houses you build to suit your needs . 
  which is why i do n't want to clutter them up by trying to fill them to the brim with gemstones . 
  but breezehome ? 
  who cares if breezehome is a pile of lag and physic glitches ? 
  it is my perception of the situation , yes . 
  statistics already prove that mass immigration is a drain on the economy , not a benefit . 
  a majority of immigrants ( legal and illegal ) are on some form of welfare . 
  there is logical explanation , other than importing future voters , for obama 's decision to make `` look the other way '' the official federal policy in regards to illegal immigration . 
  do n't wear trump swag , it 's illegal advertisement . 
  but * do * find yourself some plain red clothes or a red hat with no political slogans . 
  makes it harder for the media to legitimize large-scale fraud if recordings of the voting stations show a mass of red shirts . 
   how do illegal immigrants get on welfare exactly ? 
  illegal immigrants do have access to get federally subsidized adult education programs . 
   completely impractical, 
  sure , expelling them all at once definitely is . 
  but just catch & release of those that are caught red-handed ? 
  that 's the executive branch refusing to enforce the laws set by congress that it is legally obligated to enforce . 
  the biggest issue i have with illegal immigration is really how absolutely unfair it is to the people who follow the laws and immigrate legally . 
  legal immigrants sometimes wait for years to have their application reviewed and approved . 
  and when they get here , they find that they 're persecuted against and called illegals , because so many criminals are cutting ahead of the line . 
  and make no mistake , * every * illegal immigrant is a criminal : by the very act of illegally immigrating , they 've shown that they 're willing to break the laws of the country they want to enter . 
  if they were n't criminals , they 'd be patient and wait in the line like they 're supposed to . 
  heck , did n't someone do a luxembourg wc ? 
  out of curiosity , what is the niche of elemental fury ? 
  i liked the shout in vanilla , but it seems lackluster in requiem . 
  the official party line of the ussr regarding homosexuality : `` it is a degeneracy produced by capitalist decadence and does not exist anywhere in the union . '', 
  yeah , exactly my point . 
  elemental fury does n't do anything that slow time does n't do better . 
  its ' only real advantage is a shorter cooldown , if you planned to follow up with other shouts , which is n't really worth it in requiem . 
  if you need more than a single shout , to win a fight , you 're probably fighting a dragon and fury is suicide anyway . 
  that shout does n't have a niche anymore , which is a shame . 
  also : walls are prioritized over floors , and removing obstructions from construction tiles is prioritized below everything else ( except roof construction ) . 
  so if you 're designating walls to be built over trees , bushes or rock chunks , the obstructed tiles will get built last . 
  yep . 
  we have it really good when it comes to medicine . 
  even in the 40s , it was common for people and families to be heartbroken over a great many diagnoses , until they remembered that `` oh yeah , did n't they invent a treatment for that ? '', 
  but these days the reaction to some of the grim stuff can often be `` what do you mean it ca n't be treated ! '', 
  have you ever tried building a structure completely outdoors ? 
  they clearly build wall and floor tiles obstructed by trees last , when the rest of the building is finished . 
  for whatever reason , construction jobs that require item removal are assigned last . 
  there 's also the discrepancy that characters with plant-cutting disabled can still cut plants to make room for a construction assigned to them , so cutting the plant is not a separate job . 
  he can only plead the fifth of the testimony incriminates * him * . 
  `` it incriminates someone else '' is n't a valid reason to plead the fifth . 
  and if he has been given immunity , then he 's no longer allowed to plead the fifth , because immunity means nothing he says can incriminate him . 
  they almost did break the game with the 10.0 rubicon update that was briefly deployed and then reverted and cancelled because the main feature of the patch ( the emblem system ) was completely broken and imbalanced . 
  they key difference is that flags are earned directly through missions and medals , they 're not a credit sink . 
  and there is no `` make flag permanent for gold '' option . 
  the camouflage bonuses , on the other hand , are relatively minor . 
  no different from how permanent/temporary camo patterns in wot also include a 5 % camo bonus . 
  you 're having a bad streak . 
  and possibly , there 's confirmation bias at work . 
  for instance , i mostly play humans and liir . 
  i 've `` noticed '' in my games that there always seems to be a lot of hivers . 
  or the hivers always seem to be the faction that spawns next to me . 
  and i hate fighting hivers because their ships are so tough and fast in combat . 
  no , have a fast fleet ( dd and cl ) and a slow fleet ( bb , ca , cv ) . 
  keep both on s&d in the same naval regions , but do n't merge them into a single fleet . 
  random dragon encounters do n't happen before the western watchtower quest .
