  it 's just that you have to constantly reassign and rebase fighters to new air zones , because the ai does n't do it for you and because doomstacks of 1000 airplanes are useless due to the mechanics of air battles . 
  yes , that is germany putting all of its ~ 250 divisions on the border with neutral jugoslavia while player british empire is in position to invade through france , poland and denmark . 
  do you mean increase democracy support in your own country ? 
  or in other countries ? 
  it would be useful if you showed the code you copied and edited . 
  basically , it 's because texas is among that handful of states that contributes more to federal funding schemes than it takes out of them . 
  if they 're kicked out of some federal funding programs , nothing disastrous happens to texas . 
  texas can just replace the lost federal funding with state-level programs . 
  and they will have the available funds , now that they no longer have to contribute to the federal programs that they just got kicked out of . 
  not sure , he 'd probably be off-balance for having to debate kaine instead of clinton . 
  however , the death of clinton would also be an unrecoverable disaster to the democrats ' campaign . 
  i think it would make the debates a moot point . 
  once trump 's campaign readjusts to the shock of hillary 's sudden death , he 'll basically be running unopposed , or running against jill stein . 
   / r/politics has told me repeatedly, 
  well there 's your problem . 
  you 're listening to that lot of brainwashed idiots . 
  their first reaction to truth is `` it does n't fit my worldview , so it must be [ insert reason for dismissal here ] . '', 
  or at least the first reaction that does n't get censored by the mods . 
  hmm ... from the code you copied , it looks like you might have an extra } in there . 
  check your { } pairs to make sure you do n't have any missing or extra . 
  that 's definitely something that can break the whole idea file you 've created and cause `` invalid idea '' errors . 
  in that case , it might be that the, 
  allow_civil_war = {, 
  has_government = democratic, 
  section is missing . 
  this would make it so that if the country enters civil war , the democratic side keeps this idea . 
  alternatively , you can put in always = no , which makes the idea disappear whenever civil war happens . 
  hm ... does the structure of your ideas file look like this :, 
  ideas = {, 
  country = {, 
  fin_democracy = {, 
  this seems like you 've forgotten to put your idea into the country = { } block . 
  it 's either that , or you 're overlooking an excess } somewhere above fic_democracy, 
  right , i see what the issue is . 
  fin_democr is in the wrong `` level '' . 
  there are many categories of `` ideas '' , political advisors , nation buffs from foci and tank designers are all different categories . 
  you 're trying to define fin_democr as a new category , when it should just be a country idea . 
  here 's what it should look like : http://pastebin.com/u0jhdjhj, 
  u/amajesticpotato has acted dishonorably toward r/crusaderkings, 
  media brainwashing , for the most part . 
  jill stein is more qualified for the job than h. rotten clinton , and also a woman . 
  so it 's not even just the `` hillary 's a woman '' argument . 
  indeed . 
  try and swim up to the lady stone in the middle of the lake . 
  it 's a nice and pleasantly exciting swim to there and back . 
  and what you 're doing is playing with semantic terms to derail the discussion . 
  a representative republic is one form of democracy . 
  if you want to argue that america is n't a democracy , then please , provide evidence that it is an oligarchy , a dictatorship , a theocracy or a monarchy where the royalty wields real power like in saudi arabia . 
  a word of warning , though : requiem restricts standing stone bonuses . 
  if you pick a primary stone ( mage , warrior or thief ) , you 're stuck with switching between that stone and its ' charges ( lady , steed , lord for warrior ; tower , shadow and lover for thief ; atronach , apprentice , ritual for mage ) . 
  iirc , you can also always switch to serpent , but then you 're locked with serpent for good . 
  disclaimer : this is old knowledge from before i broke my previous installation of skyrim with excessive modding . 
  so it might not be accurate in the latest version of requiem . 
  you forgot the # from the start . 
  makes your offer look energy-deficient . 
  #\u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 donald take my high energy \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064, 
  while the nazis did plenty of reprehensible things , let 's not imply that armed partisans taking shots at german soldiers were `` civilians '' . 
  using bigger guns to shoot back at people trying to kill you is n't a war crime . 
  there 's no `` cheating '' or `` unfair advantage '' in a battle , outside of legitimate war crimes like entering combat in enemy uniforms . 
  agreed . 
  best to look at past events objectively , instead of trying to pretend either side was better or worse than they actually were . 
  their fear . 
  the commander 's incompetence . 
  ~ ~ i think alternate alien science either disables biters by default , or can be configured to disable biters ( which arumba has done for this pack ) . ~ ~, 
  disregard . 
  i 'm full of shit when making `` educated '' guesses at 1am . 
  this is caused when a certain windows update ( specifically : kb2999226 ) fails to properly install . 
  starbound is not the only program affected by this . 
  [ see this page ] ( https://www.smartftp.com/support/kb/the-program-cant-start-because-api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0dll-is-missing-f2702.html ) for fixing instructions . 
  failed windows update . 
  [ see here ] ( https://www.smartftp.com/support/kb/the-program-cant-start-because-api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0dll-is-missing-f2702.html ) for fix instructions, 
  fair enough . 
  apparently , it 's difficult to realize an `` educated '' guess is not that educated when it 's past 1am . 
  thanks for providing the correct answer . 
  and, 
  you ... seriously ? 
  you have a sick , sick mind and i 'm now terrified that people like you exist and i might meet someone like you in person one day . 
  at least i can be glad you 're only releasing these twisted urges in a video game , and not in real life . 
  basically , the research credit bonus of '' -100 % ahead of time penalty or -50 % research time if not ahead of time '' is bugged . 
  if a tech is ahead of time , you get both bonuses ( meaning , you get zero ahead of time penalty and -50 % research speed compared to base ) . 
  if you stack other research bonuses ( nuclear scientist , free trade etc. ), 
  it 's possible to have nearly -100 % research time for certain techs . 
  if you stack bonuses and a limited-use -50 % credit , you can get very close to -100 % research time . 
  also , the displayed `` time to research '' accounts for the saved up days . 
  if you 've saved up 30 days of research , and it would take 31 days to research nukes thanks to all the bonuses , the tooltip in op would show 1 day to research . 
  alternatively , op is using the easybuff mod to cheat . 
  surprisingly hard , actually . 
  even if they got significantly ahead of time on tech , they get starved of manpower and either military factories ( if they build enough civ factories for trade ) or resources ( if they build enough military factories for production ) . 
  i 'll admit , most of my experience with minors comes from trying to wc with the baltics . 
  the other two baltics are the only easy prey , and they do n't provide much in the way of manpower or resources . 
  they only provide factory space . 
  and then it 's a choice of finland , sweden , poland , germany or the onion . 
  wow . 
  thanks for introducing me to this tool . 
  does it require a patch to work with requiem , or is it compatible on its ' own ? 
  if the shady sam thing bothers you , then you probably ought to update lal . 
  i think he 's been removed from the latest versions of it and you get pointed directly to helgen the first time you ask any innkeeper about rumors . 
  just went through the game files . 
  op is definitely running the game with mods . 
  none of the countries in vanilla get -100 % ahead reduction for nuclear tech .
