  or he embraced war to the point that he did n't * want * to return to civilian life anymore ? 
  not sure about the rest , but it does n't matter if you 're a registered democrat . 
  you can vote for anyone you want at the ballot , and if someone says otherwise they 're a filthy liar trying to manipulate your vote . 
  in the elder scrolls lore , this is resolved with elves being limited in the amount of children they can have over their lifetime . 
  four times is the maximum a mer woman can get pregnant , and that 's considered exceptionally fertile . 
   the anschluss vote was certainly one of the most rigged referendums in human history . 
  there was a significant movement in austria to join with germany , even before hitler took power in germany . 
  they might not have had a 50 % majority , but the anschluss movement did have a considerable amount of public support in austria . 
  for the most rigged referendums in history , you have to look to the east and the neighbors of the ussr `` voting to join the ussr '' by referendum . 
  over there , russian soldiers crossed the border and then had to dress in civilian uniform to stage a communist protest calling for the referendum , because only something like 0.1 % of the local population supported communism . 
  it 's an international agreement . 
  once the authority passes over , taking it back requires icann to agree to give it back . 
  the us does n't have any kind of leverage to demand it back . 
  pretty much the only thing the us can do on its ' own authority is turn to digital isolation and make the us internet separate from the rest of the world 's internet , which defeats the point of the internet as a global network . 
   would any of the imperial higher-ups have a problem with this world if they found out ? 
  unlikely , as long as the tithes hold up . 
  some might even approve , since this kind of constant struggle breeds a hardy stock of soldiers for the guard ( which is likely where most of the tithe ends up ) . 
  however , there might be some disapproval from higher up , if the warlords lower the quality of the tithe by only providing captives weakened or maimed by their imprisonment or capture . 
  the guard does n't need frail cripples , especially not illiterate cripples from a feral world tribe . 
  they 'll express their disapproval to the governor , who will then express his disapproval to the warlords . 
  nah , that 's the difference between the neighbor being charged with trespassing and the centipede being charged with ( attempted ) murder . 
  yeah , it 's western europe that has the worst debt problems ( and greece ) . 
  seems like you have a bit of a misunderstanding of what stop and frisk really entails . 
  first , stop and frisk is not a search . 
  it 's a surface frisk for * concealed weapons only * . 
  it still requires reasonable suspicion , even if it does n't require probable cause . 
  it has already been ruled that being black or hispanic by itself is not reasonable suspicion . 
  however , dressing like a gang member can be reasonable suspicion . 
  it should be noted that detecting a concealed weapon ( or something that * feels * like a weapon ; not what feels like a wallet or a drug packet ) during a s&f does give probable cause for an actual search and seizure . 
  if the gangs `` wise up '' and coordinate to change their fashion and organizational culture , then it would mean stop and frisk rates go down as the cops do n't have reasonable suspicion as frequently . 
  especially since there was that recent court decision that declared some nypd s&f policies unconstitutional . 
  in practical terms , the biggest change of that decision is that `` being in the wrong neighborhood '' can no longer be considered suspicious in areas where the court decision applies . 
  police will continue to have other reasons for reasonable suspicion , of course . 
  primarily behavioral reasons they spot , [ such as poses ] ( http://lifehacker.com/know-how-to-spot-the-signs-of-a-hidden-handgun-1650351312 ) that suggest they 're hiding a weapon . 
   arumba complaining to devs about the `` doodads '' in multiplayer early in the video . 
  i 'll assume by `` doodads '' he means ground clutter stuff . 
  i 'm pretty sure the devs said in one of their fff blog posts that they were going to change how ground clutter works , to reduce its ' performance footprint . 
  i think the planned solution is that ground clutter elements are no longer going to be objects that get saved with the map . 
  and then you have to make do without your most useful , productive colonist until you get more lucy . 
  estonian here , and i have to say that supporting thi is a bit suspect . 
  he had his moments in the past , but over the last two years in office , he 's been constantly giving off the impression of a distant technocrat who holds in disdain everyone that is n't as `` enlightened '' as him and his fellow establishment politicians . 
  he 's not a libertarian , and never has been . 
  he 's a left-wing globalist . 
  not to mention he wields very little political power as president . 
  it 's more of a ceremonial position . 
  ilves had nothing to do with pushing through the austerity measures . 
  yeah . 
  that 's my first factory too , after arumba inspired me to buy the game for that setup . 
  and i 'm at the point where i 'm like `` how the fuck am i going to bus all of this ? '' . 
  as well as `` shit , i do n't have enough stitarite left in the spawn to waste on smelting it raw '' . 
  and from there : `` crap , the flotation belt is clogged with crushed ore again . '', 
   fun, 
  fixed that for you . 
  ' ' is a character of its ' own . 
  alt + 19 to write it yourself . 
  very much hyperbolic : at this point , it looks like kersti kaljulaid , an experienced bank manager and a a member of the european court of auditors since 2004 , is going to be elected in riigikogu with overwhelming consensus . 
  so basically : an establishment globalist with close ties to international banking is going to be the estonian president . 
  check if prussia has the tech for battleship_1 and any other ships in the fleet . 
  iirc , things get weird if a nation has non-foreign equipment that they do n't have the technology for . 
  most people do n't follow the presidential race before the first debate , outside of what the media reports in evening news . 
  in the first debate , he had to break the impression that the msm is constantly pressing : that trump is a racist , misogynist bully who 's too spontaneous to ever be `` presidential '' . 
  that 's why he avoided attacking clinton too viciously . 
  not sure what it could be in that case . 
  if you want , put your whole history file into pastebin , reply with the link and i 'll check it out . 
  found the mistake . 
  the navy is supposed to be inside the `` units '' tag . 
  the following is correct :, 
  units = {, 
  division = {, 
  #army stuff, 
  ... #other land divisions, 
  navy = {, 
  #navy stuff, 
  but you had :, 
  units = {, 
  division = {, 
  #army stuff, 
  ... #other land divisions, 
  navy = {, 
  #navy stuff, 
  growth , definitely . 
  at that point in the game , you 're either a world-conquering major , or destroyed/made irrelevant by the ai majors . 
  retention is only useful if you have very few factories and need to switch production lines often . 
  and even then it 's not that good , because the bonus is multiplicative . 
  i.e , if a tech gives you '' +20 % retention '' it does n't mean base 20 % efficiency from switching lines , +20 % from tech = 40 % efficiency after switching production . 
  it means base 20 % * ( base 100 % +20 % from tech ) = 20 % * 1.2 = 24 % efficiency after switching production . 
  except the first one is actually safer if you have to write this in php . 
  because in the second option , php might decide to do something stupid and return something other than * false * ( or more likely , soft-cast * bool false * to * int 0 * or * null * if you use the output in any kind of comparison ) . 
  just for future reference , custom_effect_tooltip is really only meant to be used if the normal tooltip generated from the effects of the event is something very confusing and you want to replace it with a handwritten explanation . 
  in most cases , it can be safely removed , if you 're copying a vanilla effect and adjusting it for your own mod . 
  i see this one 's a bit old , but you can try using special notation to generate a `` backspace '' character as the first `` letter '' in the localization file for equipment version and test if it erases the space generated by hardcode . 
  the notation for backspace is '' \\ b '' ( without quotation marks ) , but if pdx coders know what they 're doing , they 'll probably sanitize that and it 'll just result in '' \\ bmk.i '' or whatever . 
  but you never know . 
  it 's an easy oversight to make . 
  the modifiers do stack , yes . 
  if you have all four traits , there 's a total of a ~ 3 % chance for any of your children to turn demonic before they reach age 3 ( and become disqualified from the event ) . 
  mostly because the professional politicians , particularly those of the democratic party , have lost all credibility . 
  it 's all a big circle of corrupt traitors playing musical chairs and closing ranks if anyone is threatened with criminal charges . 
  we need an outsider who is n't part of that institutional system of influence peddling to clean house . 
  i feel that if trump loses , the only recourse that remains to put an end to the widespread corruption among both the democrats and the establishment republicans is a violent revolution .
