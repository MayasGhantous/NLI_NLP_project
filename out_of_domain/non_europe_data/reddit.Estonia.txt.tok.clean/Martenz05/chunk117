  tullius occasionally came off as dismissive to the point that i wondered if he was being deliberately insulting to nords and then feigning ignorance of nord traditions to get away with it . 
  chiang kai shek was involved in the `` big 3 '' negotiations from time to time , but being left out was largely because fdr and churchill want to piss off stalin by putting cks next to stalin . 
  especially since stalin did invite representatives of the chinese communists to all of the major conferences and having the leader of the chinese nationalists there with the big boys would probably have caused an incident of some kind , like demanding mao be there as well . 
  personally , i do n't trust * either * of the two major parties . 
  the gop establishment has also rallied against trump and i would not be surprised if the colluded with democrats `` just this one time '' to keep an anti-corruption candidate out of the white house . 
  because let 's face it , most influential billionaires cover their bases by donating to candidates of both parties . 
  regardless of their party affiliation , i consider politicians to be bought and paid for until they prove otherwise with their actions , like trey gowdy has with his work in the oversight committee . 
  that 's how blatantly broken us democracy has become . 
  do n't we all ? 
  can you honestly say that you would n't do it , if you were bored and had the time and skill to ` shop up a convincing enough fake ? 
  you fucked up the imgur link . 
  you 've got mismatched parentheses . 
  you 've got \\ [ i got blocked \\ ] \\ ( link ** \\ ] ** instead of \\ [ i got blocked \\ ] \\ ( link ** \\ ) **, 
  there are already [ leaks ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9846#efmacnafm ) out there which point to the dnc deciding that hillary was the democrat nominee long before the primaries were over . 
  there 's [ talk ] ( https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5423 ) of `` throwing bernie a bone '' , so he and his supporters would have the illusion that they `` won '' something that `` does n't make a difference anyway '' . 
  hell , some superdelegates who supported bernie had funding for their own campaigns cut due to `` loss of trust '' , though i ca n't find that specific email at the moment . 
  i 'm sure someone here has a bookmark for it . 
  at any rate , the dnc heavily rigged their primary to ensure hillary won . 
  and that 's the things with massive rigging like this : once it becomes public , there can never be a legitimate result in the perpetrators ' favor ever again . 
  hillary and the democrats around her have repeatedly proven they are willing to rig the process to win . 
  if they do win , there will always be justified doubts about the legitimacy of their victory . 
  if some insurgent trump sympathizer does blow the whistle , * the media will simply refuse to report on it * . 
  just as they are largely refusing to report on the worst of the podesta leaks , as well as the wall st. 
  speech transcript leaks . 
  cnn is straight up telling us `` it 's illegal for you to possess ( and implying : to see ) these documents directly . 
  but we 're different because we 're media , so it 's legal for us '' . 
  so we have to trust clinton news network to decide for us what we need or do n't need to know about the candidates ? 
  got an addition for you :, 
  ** estonia **, 
  ** in-game fascist party name : ** fascist, 
  ** historical fascist party name : ** [ vaps movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaps_movement ) . 
  the party should also be banned in this timeframe , much like france bans the communist party . 
  the dictatorship of konstantin p\u00e4ts ( in-game non-aligned ) was established specifically to prevent the fascist vaps movement from taking power as they were about to win a democratic election . 
  ** in-game fascist party leader : ** ( autogenerated ), 
  ** historical fascist party leader : ** [ andres larka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andres_larka ) . 
  though imprisoned since 1934 , he was the vaps presidential candidate , figurehead or not . 
  the actual political leader [ artur sirk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artur_sirk ) died in 1937 , falling out a window in luxembourg ( officially suicide , allegedly assassination by agents of p\u00e4ts ) . 
  ** in-game facist demagouge : ** [ johannes vares-barbaruse ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johannes_vares ), 
  ** historical wtf : ** johannes vares was a * communist * collaborator . 
  the local figurehead of the soviet occupation regime during ww2 . 
  it is very difficult to find someone who makes less sense as the fascist demagouge of estonia . 
  ** historical fascist demagouge : ** andres larka , same as party leader . 
  the interpretation being that activating him as a political advisor means ahistorically releasing him from prison and letting him rekindle the vaps movement . 
  literally nobody . 
  they have to read the emails for themselves . 
  i 'll be honest , when i saw that 420 , i expected you to take a flamethrower to it . 
  surprisingly , they 're not . 
  you can make six wood statues in the time it takes to make a single stone statue of the same size . 
  nah , probably from / u/spez and the other admins . 
  there 's a bit of nuance to god 's infallibility . 
  god is good by definition . 
  he is not subject to our understanding of christian moral values ; christian moral values are subject to him . 
  if god has done something that a christian finds evil , then the christian is wrong about something and is failing to understand the goodness of god . 
  the fault is only ever with human understanding of god , never with god himself . 
  christianity is complicated , especially to a believer . 
  as hateful as muslim fanatics are toward unbelievers , they are still comprehensible . 
  genuine christian fanatics , rare though they are these days , aspire to be more similar to god in every way they possibly can . 
  this allows christians to descend into very bizarre depths of insanity and self-contradiction without being in breach of their faith . 
  considering certain concepts that christians hold true ( like the trinity ) are flat out logical impossibilities . 
  to atheists , these logical impossibilities disprove god . 
  to christians like myself , the logical impossibility only proves that god is greater than logic and does not need to conform to it . 
  and as i aspire to be closer to god , i do n't need to let myself be bound by logic either . 
  it 's a very liberating sensation , not having to worry about contradictions . 
  uhh ... 
  i think you 're in the wrong subreddit . 
  this is hearts of iron 4 , not europa universalis . 
  trinity defines that all of the following statements are true :, 
  father is god, 
  son is god, 
  holy spirit is god, 
  father is not son, 
  father is not holy spirit, 
  son is not holy spirit, 
  the second half of those violate the logical principle of transition . 
  and no , the doctrine of trinity is n't `` father is part of god '' etc. 
  christian scholars and clergy actually acknowledge and preach that the nature of trinity is true in defiance of classical logic . 
  welcome to the batshit insane wing of christianity . 
  where we are not required to understand what 's coming out of our mouths ( or keyboards ) . 
  i 'm guessing smokeleaf is some futuristic gmo weed : the whole plant can be processed into joints . 
  no leftover fiber waste . 
   what we do n't really have enough research on is the effect of radiation on humans - because only the japanese atomic bomb survivors are the only samples we have . 
  this is straight-up false . 
  we also have the survivors among chernobyl cleanup crews at the very least . 
  not to mention the effects of atom bomb radiation are actually distinct from the effects of nuclear reactor/meltdown radiation . 
  still , i 'm not sure if the ussr ever released the data gathered by the doctors tending to the conscripts in chernobyl . 
  or how much data they gathered to begin with . 
  this solution runs headfirst into economic walls , though . 
  a plant needs to be profitable over the course of its ' lifetime . 
  unless we 're looking at the communist approach with a planned economy funded exclusively out of taxpayer pockets , nobody is going to build tiny nuclear plants in every other city out of altruism . 
  such tiny `` local '' plants ca n't hope to ever sell enough electricity to make up the costs of construction , operation and maintenance that pile up over the plant 's lifetime . 
  for these plants to be worth building , the price of electricity needs to go waaay up . 
  or , it needs to be a huge plant that produces lots of cheap energy not just for the local area but for `` export '' into other regions . 
  man , molag bal 's quest is peanuts compared to namira 's . 
  thing is , thanks to its ' superior mobility , the is-3 also tends to dictate the engagement in close quarters . 
  the is-3 always has the option to pull back faster than the tiger ii can close in . 
  the only way a tiger ii can force an is-3 to engage on the tiger 's terms is if the is actively fucks up map awareness and gets into a bad position . 
  not the smoking gun , sadly . 
  our excellent autists already looked into these posts on the_donald and they 're probably fake . 
  one account is definitely satire and the photo of the files on the other is a stock photo with captions . 
  still , ca n't hurt to report these to the election watchdogs for official investigation .
