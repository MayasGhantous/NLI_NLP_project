  let 's be honest : if there are tons of civilians blocking way too many avenues , then it 's * because half of them are faceless * . 
  ( if you 're playing lw2 , anyway ), 
  oh , i thought the / s was so obvious it did n't need to be put in , but i guess not . 
  so i 'll spell it out for you : if trump was as fascist as the leftist media paints him as , then half those `` brave '' celebrities , journalists and college students criticizing him would be rotting in in a mass grave , and the other half would be too terrified of trump and his regime to do anything but praise how glorious a leader trump is . 
  i think the point of the poster is `` are you an invisible op nuisance like loki ? '', 
  it 's not just the ( absent ) tone that makes it sarcastic , but a major contradiction in the sentence itself . 
  who in their right mind would not be terrified of speaking out against a fascist leader ? 
  and yet nobody is afraid of criticizing trump . 
  therefore , it should be pretty obvious i meant trump is n't fascist . 
  i run a mod called requiem , it partially removes `` soft '' immortality from characters ( i.e , the type of immortality that mods and console commands can alter ) . 
  if i accidentally hit an `` immortal '' npc when they 're already forced to the kneel animation , i kill them . 
  and i like it that way . 
  i like the idea that friendly fire is a thing . 
  makes the game far more immersive than just being able to rely on undying companions when i get into trouble . 
  well , estonia has made an official statement that a ) estonia is not the unnamed baltic country , and b ) that it may be deliberate disinformation to fracture us-baltic trust . 
  and the second one is not that far-fetched . 
  russian agents are not above false-flags and faking credentials to sell their disinformation to willing outlets . 
  especially if the outlet is eager from the start to believe the disinfo and is n't interested in doing their due diligence to verify the fake news . 
  here : https://sputniknews.com/europe/201702161050757803-estonia-espionage-us/, 
  i know sputnik news is n't the most reliable when it comes to political matters , but it 's the only english source i could find right now . 
  i first read the original statement and reports in estonian , but obviously that wo n't be much use as proof . 
  still the article does n't editorialize or twist the original report . 
  hmm ... an influential civilian trying to sabotage the foreign policy direction of the administration . 
  is n't this the same kind of logan act violation they just got done accusing flynn of ? 
  hmm ... an influential civilian trying to sabotage the foreign policy direction of the administration . 
  is n't this the same kind of logan act violation they just got done accusing flynn of ? 
  the head of the executive branch making an official statement on behalf of his government means `` pretty much nothing '' in your mind ? 
  so basically , anonymous sources are always right and more trustworthy than anything official statements can say ? 
  [ well , what do you know ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5uqzh2/i_have_a_pc_modded_minecraft_server_called/ ), 
  noooope . 
  the last one was pius xii who was keeping globalists out of the curia . 
  john paul ii just toned it down a little bit so as to not break the illusion too soon . 
  read up on the * [ sede vacante ] ( http://novusordowatch.org/sede-vacante-1958-2008/ ) * repill for yourself . 
  impact of day without immigrants : restaurants were not as crowded and traffic was much smoother . 
  i know from experience it does n't . 
  `` restore body part '' does n't work for `` whole body '' conditions like plague . 
  yeah , save after they 're infected , then edit the immunity value to 99,99 % and the pawn will complete the immunity progress when you reload . 
  and it was the earliest reliable method for humans to purify potentially contaminated water into a drinkable state . 
  and then we 're the racists because we hold non-whites to the same standards of intelligence and moral integrity that we hold ourselves to . 
  yeah , op noticed . 
  even started the thread with asking someone less important to help him , because he did n't want to take away from the dev 's time . 
  they did , but there were problems with boiled water . 
  for one , boiled water does n't stay fresh in storage for as long as beer , for instance . 
  it was also easier to make large quantities of alcohol and store it , than boiling water every day . 
  alright , let 's just put this one to rest . 
  trump 's stance of vaccines is more like `` maybe we should n't inject massive vaccine cocktails into infants less than a year old , and instead spread the injections out over the first two years of their life . '', 
  not `` let 's ban vaccines ! '', 
  here 's an easter egg for you : if the hindenburg survives , rudolph hess uses it for his trip to britain . 
   chamberlain 's incompetent diplomacy ( he truly believed there wo n't be a war ) as opposed to churchill 's firm believe that war is inevitable and the allies should have defied the germans earlier . 
  i 've read other accounts of this . 
  churchill himself supposedly said at some point that despite his criticism of chamberlain at the time , he did not fully understand how unprepared britain was for war until after he became pm , with all the clearances that entailed . 
  he later even acknowledged that chamberlain 's diplomacy delayed the war and was invaluable for getting britain prepared for it . 
  claiming sexual assault over mere words ? 
  `` i felt raped by what he said to me '' is sadly a real thing , too , which diminishes genuine victims . 
  besides , trump 's `` grab them by the pussy '' was clearly in the context of groupies consenting and throwing themselves at the rich and famous given the opportunity . 
  well , the recent search for information , and the associated shitposts on t_d led me to [ this graph ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5v1iwc/grenade_attacks_are_now_a_thing_in_sweden/ ) , from which i concluded that i really have all i need to know to be confident that open borders are not viable . 
  [ here 's why . 
  ] ( http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/11/03/imgur-alternative-slimgur-taken-offline-by-targeted-child-porn-uploads/ ), 
  well . 
  that would be an amazing mod . 
  hair-pull frustrating to figure out , but amazing when you do . 
  well , it would n't be as bad as angel 's + bob 's oil refining . 
  lets you electronically sign legal documents over the internet that ( in most other countries ) you 'd have to show up in person to sign , or find and hire a trustworthy local lawyer to sign on your behalf . 
  basically , only useful if you want to establish a business in estonia ( and by extension , the eu market zone ) without having to travel to estonia every quarter or two to sign important paperwork . 
  yeah , after all it 's not like soldiers are risking their lives or anything . 
  even in war , women are the greatest victims of the conflict because they lose their husbands and sons . 
  that 's because it 's a good way of keeping track of how much water you 've been drinking . 
  only drink out of a single measured container . 
  once it 's empty , you know you 've drank 3l or whatever the size is . 
  the main reason for this is [ apparently ] ( http://news.postimees.ee/3826371/russian-warplanes-cannot-switch-on-transponders ) that russian military aircraft are designed and built without civilian-compatible transponders and russia is either too broke or simply not interested in reducing the likelihood of international incidents to refit their planes . 
  it 's not automatically a ramming maneuver . 
  if the ship that 's moving into/through an occupied tile , they are allowed to declare a ramming maneuver , but if they do n't then the ships pass each other . 
  in truth , there is no such thing as `` moving through '' a tile occupied by an enemy , unless you actually end your movement on the same tile . 
  according raw , only position at the end of a ship 's movement can determine whether the ship is allowed to ram . 
  refer to page 213 of rt core rules , maneuver actions and the box on ramming and boarding actions on page 215 . 
  to quote `` if a starship ends its maneuver action ** within 1 vu ** of an enemy ship and its ' bow is facing said vessel , the starship ** may ** give up its ' shooting action ... '', 
  given the earlier explanation of vus in the maneuver action section , `` within 1 vu '' includes being on the same tile , and `` may '' always means it is an option , not mandatory . 
  so even if you end your movement within the same tile , you 're not forced to ram . 
  absolutely , the sentencing should not be up to the jury . 
  imo , the best option would be to have the death penalty on the books , but hold judges liable for any carried-out executions of people that later exonerated . 
  the possibility should be there , but only if a professional is absolutely certain of guilt . 
  given that there have always been willing collaborators among afghanis , i 'd say they are n't even united in that . 
  the only thing any tribe of afghanistan hates more than foreign invaders , is the tribe a few valleys over that they 've been feuding with , and when offered , any given tribe is more than willing to cooperate with foreign invaders to oppress tribes that have slighted them in the past . 
  countries made up of splintered tribes like that typically do n't manage a unified nation until they either balkanize , or if one tribe establishes itself as completely dominant over the others . 
  indeed . 
  what we do is boycott companies over what they 've done , or publicly stated . 
  what the left does , is boycott companies over their lack of virtue signalling when the left is pressuring them to do so . 
  it 's probably something wrong with the picture itself . 
  make sure it 's not the wrong size or something . 
  apparently [ these books ] ( http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/index_astartes_\\ ( background_books \\ ) ) contradict * the last church * on the emperor 's stance on religion . 
  since tlc is a black library book , it 's `` less canon '' than the official gw materials . 
  just start downvoting this meme crap and the shitposters will go away when posting memes starts costing them imaginary internet points . 
  you know , that definition can only be true if the value of power is 0 . 
  because if power = / = 0 , then the equation is recursive :, 
  oppression = oppression + power = oppression + power + power = etc. 
  i 'm sure there 's a subtle joke in there somewhere , but i ca n't figure it out . 
  how the shit did i miss that ? 
  yeah , i actually am a programmer and use those equations all the time . 
  i somehow managed to default back to regular math . 
  i do n't get the appeal of chaos .
