  yeah ... banning people who call others imbeciles for their political views does n't mean they 're banning conservatives . 
  not by itself , anyway . 
  do they have a pattern of banning conservatives for such language , without banning leftists for the same kind of thing ? 
  so ... your hard drive may be dying . 
  you should make backups of important stuff and get it checked out . 
  it also tends to overpenetrate , where the 5.56 would fragment , so the stopping power is actually comparable . 
  bigger difference is cover penetration . 
  off the top of my head ? 
  his talk of red lines in syria when he had no intention of following through on the threat , and the loss of us international credibility that took place when he failed to follow through when the red lines he had established were crossed . 
  his administration `` suggesting '' to companies being fined which liberal activism `` charities '' they should donate to as part of their compensation settlements . 
  i 'm not buying the story that companies just decided on their own to donate near-exclusively to liberally biased political activism groups without any input or signalling from the administration . 
  the point being that 10-14 arleigh burkes will handily sink an iowa regardless of the refit , probably without casualties even . 
  meanwhile 10-14 patrol boats would get completely demolished if they tried to get close enough to sink an arleigh burke with their weapons . 
  been argued to death and back on spacebattles . 
  a modern battleship would be an arsenal ship with craptons of cruise - and aa missiles . 
  railgun technology is * at most * promising to replace 5 '' guns and give them increased range and velocity , as well as freeing up ship tonnage in future designs for things like more powerful engines or additional missile storage . 
  even payloads equivalent to 8 '' or 10 '' guns are completely beyond reach of the current experimental railguns . 
  16 '' - equivalent railguns are so far beyond reality that it 's very amusing for me to hear all these armchair admirals who are suggesting railguns are going to bring back gunboat battleships . 
  the only thing i hate about wt is that its impossible to find honest/critical previews/reviews of their content . 
  gaijin copyright strikes anyone who criticizes their content or the direction their game is taking , so the only youtubers who still provide wt content are the ones who will never criticize them , because their channels run on wt content and gaijin can just kill their channel if they step out of line . 
  you mean like all the `` experienced '' politicians who , for the past 20 + years , have n't earned a dime of money that is n't just leeched off the taxpayers or `` donated '' into their `` charities '' ? 
  have to agree there . 
  when people say 4chan , i generally think of either / pol / or / tg / first . 
  and the latter is a pretty chill place that occasionally gets amazing shit done . 
  can confirm . 
  writing is a very different deal from talking . 
  i can manage writing an email in russian ( with the occasional help of a dictionary ) . 
  takes me five minutes to recite a single sentence off a screen/paper if there are any of those big words in there . 
  especially if there are any of those \u0446 , \u0436 , \u0449 or other parseltongue letters in there . 
  fluid , spontaneous talking is right out . 
  there a source for those spicy truthbombs ? 
  because i desperately want to share these with my liberal associates who continue to believe trump is the worst thing ever and i know they 'll ask for sources . 
  still useful if you 're ready to become feudal , but gavelkind screwed your chances of getting the sites to reform the pagan religion . 
  an it gives access to various feudal events , and improves your ability to obtain good court physicians , which is something pagans ca n't really control otherwise . 
  nah , even if you voted democrat , people who voted democrat more times than you would still call you a nazi . 
  it may have been your fault this time , but `` accidents '' need to be common for a player to turn blue from the first shot . 
  not op , but basically the stance is that the impact of federal regulations and taxes on your life ought to be minimal , unless you 're in the business of interstate or international commerce . 
  the government that matters most in an american 's life ought to be their state government , and state elections should be the most significant election cycle . 
  likewise , people should only worry about informing themselves about the candidates of their state elections . 
  the idea being that the federal level has so little power that it does n't really matter who 's holding office there . 
  this is how it used to work for most of the 1800s , until the fed kept giving itself more and more power over the states under the administrations of t. roosevelt , w. wilson and fdr . 
  and it continued into the cold war , because the us in its ' entirety needed a singular policy direction to remain competitive with the ussr . 
  correction , infantry was perfectly capable of assaulting and holding trenches , and remained necessary in that role throughout the war . 
  tanks were designed to counter barbed wire and machineguns , which were preventing the infantry from reaching the trench . 
  tanks ' ability to cross trenches did not directly help in taking the trench . 
  that feature was only important in overrunning a trench and immediately assaulting the next one in the same offensive push , forcing the enemy infantry still in the trench to retreat or become encircled .

  if you want coffee buddies , look to scandinavia . 
  as for why : in 1773 , the british east india company was given the right to trade and deliver their tea ( they had stockpiled a large excess in london , and were having trouble selling ) directly to the colonies without having to pay double customs for them ( once , when the eic delivered them to london , and again , when exporting them out of london 's warehouses ) , allowing the eic to undercut the price of smuggled tea . 
  without getting too much into the legal nuances of it , buying cheap tea from the eic implied the colony recognized the british parliament 's authority to tax them . 
  which the future usa refused to do , leading to the boston tea party and eventually the revolutionary war . 
  colonies that were n't as rebellious as the thirteen colonies accepted the tea and thanks to a steady supply of cheap tea it became a tradition there . 
  yeah . 
  if the disease is bad enough , it 's possible for death to trigger before the healing event , especially since children have reduced health until their reach adulthood . 
  if the walls collapse due to soft soil or something , the extra work of smoothing out the edges of the grave again is so significant , you might as well be starting from scratch . 
  heck , even homing missiles are not a terrible mechanic in itself , as long as they 're not inevitable , unavoidable blue shells . 
  if it was feasible to shoot them down or if the homing was only partial ( i.e , large enough turning circle that they 'll probably crash into walls if they miss you the first time ) , they 'd be completely fine . 
  i did went through that frustration as soon as i found out what the reward is : a permanent perk that grants increased ingredient gain from plants , including nirnroot iirc . 
  he 's suggesting turkish men that have already moved to central europe have five children with local women ( who will be raised as turks in the spirit of islam ) .

  calm your tits : the map is just a globalist `` ideal '' , not an achievement . 
  yeah , the regime should be authoritarian neutral or fascist if it 's a puppet of russia . 
  it does n't , really . 
  it keeps the movement in the headlines ( even if negatively ) . 
  being in the picture is n't relevant for actually succeeding , though . 
  in fact , these movements are n't intended to succeed . 
  if they actually `` succeed '' then the professional protesters are out of a job , so they 'll have to scramble to find something new to protest against . 
  alinsky 's tactics are intended to rake in the dough from naive idiots who will donate their rent money , and from self-serving puppetmasters like soros , who have enough money that spending a few grand a month on each of these low-effort movements to keep derailing efforts at constructive political dialogue is worth the risk . 
  it probably \\* does n't outright ignore your intrigue , just reduces the likelihood if you have high intrigue . 
  but nothing ever makes it impossible . 
  \\* someone would have to check the event code to make sure .
