  that 's dumb . 
  really , really dumb . 
  even modders know better than that . 
  i prefer the `` carriage travel only '' fast travel restriction . 
  a horse is fast enough to travel within a single hold , and you do n't miss any of the random ~ ~ loot ~ ~ encounters on the way . 
  such as actual atronachs that drop precious salts . 
  stagger from high damage strikes is still there , but they 're immune `` stun '' attacks like shield bashing . 
  capped accuracy ?

  that sight sounds so incredibly satisfying . 
  shame my computer is n't really good enough to handle much more than ~ 500 bots without dropping below 20 fps . 
  i recall the local estonian news on the incident with the dutch ambassador and his boyfriend . 
  rumors from ... let 's be honest , dutch gossip mags , suggested it may have been a hoax hate crime . 
  people who knew the couple suspected the boyfriend was threatening to dump the ambassador if he did n't get himself reassigned to a country larger and more `` diverse '' than estonia and they may have made up the `` backwards racist homophobes '' excuse . 
  perhaps not quite as accurate . 
  more like `` if germany was willing to go to war over danzig , they would have seized it in a day and forced poland and the rest of the world to accept the new reality by now '', 
  in short , it 's why 800 troops is a deterrence force , not a military threat that could stop an actual invasion in its ' tracks ( or threaten russia itself with an invasion ) . 
  it has more integrity than cnn . 
  except where russian political dogma is concerned . 
  estonia has never had an stv system as typically envisioned . 
  nobody 's ever gotten to select a `` preferred order '' of candidates on their ballot . 
  it 's not even necessary , because we 're not talking about an fptp system where it would make sense to be able to `` transfer '' your vote in the event that your first preferred candidate does n't get elected . 
  each vote goes to a specific candidate first , and there are personal mandates , meaning enough people voted directly for a candidate for them to automatically win a seat in the district . 
  the size of a personal mandate threshold is based on population and the amount of seats a district is officially assigned , so with low enough voter turnout and a divided enough vote , it 's possible nobody gets a personal mandate in a district . 
  theoretically , with 100 % voter turnout and very exact vote distribution between candidates , it 's also possible for all the seats of a district to be handed out as personal mandates , but i do n't think it 's ever happened . 
  then there are regional mandates . 
  after personal mandates are handed out , each voting district will have votes left over : the surplus from candidates who won personal mandates , as well as the votes of candidates who fell below the threshold . 
  these votes get transferred to the candidate list they were part of , usually the list of their own party . 
  the numbers are tallied up and each list has a certain amount of votes assigned to them . 
  every list that meets the regional mandate threshold gets a regional mandate seat given to the candidate at the top of the list . 
  the lists are ordered , so being higher on your party 's list of candidates means you 're more likely to get a seat ( if you 're not expecting to get a popular mandate , anyway ) . 
  if a regional mandate is assigned to a list , the threshold amount of votes is removed from the pool , and the process is repeated until all regional lists are below the threshold for regional mandates . 
  parties are allowed to have an `` open list '' , which is reordered by popularity in the personal mandate round ; none of the major parties do this and instead keep control over the list ; ostensibly to include qualified experts who lack the mass appeal of public figures and celebrity politicians in legislative decisionmaking . 
  like with personal mandates , the vote threshold depends on the population of the district and the amount of seats the district is supposed to get in the parliament . 
  the majority of parliament seats are handed out in this stage , though there are typically seats and split votes left over from this stage . 
  finally , there are compensation mandates where the votes of the candidate lists across the nation are pooled together and some math is done to assign the remaining seats of parliament to parties using a modified d'hondt method . 
  in this phase , all seats of the parliament that were not assigned as personal or regional mandates due to low turnout and/or split votes are handed out . 
  essentially , there is a `` compensation mandate threshold '' that a list has to meet to obtain a mandate here . 
  if any lists meet the threshold , they are assigned a mandate ( in the order of which list has the most votes remaining ) and the threshold amount removed from their pool . 
  if there are seats remaining but no lists are over the threshold , then the vote count of each list is multiplied by the same number and checked again for meeting the threshold . 
  again , the candidate that receives the mandate is the one at the top of the list , meaning the party has control over which candidates are preferred to go into the parliament . 
  oh , and there 's also a minimum required vote percentage threshold for a list to qualify for participation in the regional and compensation rounds . 
  yes . 
  go to askthe_donald if you want to ask questions . 
  you won the culture war on safe spaces existing , and t_d is ours so we kick you the fuck out if you 're violating the safe space . 
  just like every liberal safe space kicks out us `` deplorables '' when we come in and start talking about hillary 's blatant corruption , migrant crimes or proving hate crimes as hoaxes and providing links to leaks and videos . 
  and then deal with the consequences of addicts turning to crime to pay for drugs ? 
  legalizing the substance does not miraculously make an addict less desperate to get their fix . 
  and it does n't matter if they 're paying for legal or illegal if they 're still turning to crime to get the money for it . 
  and all the regulations controlling `` legal '' drugs are still business expenses that allow illegal drug dealing to undercut legal drug vendors and remain in business . 
  i certainly hope you 're not envisioning a straight-up return to the era where it 's all completely unregulated and cocaine is openly advertised as a children 's cough medicine . 
  `` ending the drug war '' is not some magic wand solution that 's going to fix america 's drug and crime problem . 
  i 'm aware . 
  which is why i recommended askthe_donald , not asktrumpsupporters . 
  in your situation , you 're immediately assuming that person b also secretly confessed . 
  in reality , we have no idea whether wikileaks actually has information on russia that they 're not releasing because `` russian connections '' . 
  it 's entirely possible the russian government and intelligence agencies are corrupt and self-serving enough to lack idealistic whistleblowers with actual access to compromising information . 
  russian culture itself is far more accepting of corruption than western culture . 
  the common attitude there is that with corruption , the crime is getting caught or not paying your dues in money and loyalty to the people above you that are allowing your corrupt activities . 
  so you 're talking about republican leaks vs democrat leaks ? 
  if wikileaks was a partisan organization , they would have suppressed the bush war cabinet leaks . 
  until the clinton leaks , i was actually fairly convinced wikileaks had a liberal/democrat bias and they were suppressing leaks on their crimes . 
  i 'm really glad they proved themselves nonpartisan there . 
  mind you , disease , starvation and freezing to death in the russian winter , even if they 're because of the war , still go to hardy . 
  so basically , when they 're leaking the dirty secrets of republicans , they 're good nonpartisan journalists . 
  when they start leaking democrat secrets as well , they 're clearly partisan-biased and/or in bed with russia . 
  wonderful logic you 've got there . 
  ** bulwark of faith **, 
  perhaps this could be a once-per battle ability that gives a prot and stress resist buff until the end of combat , at the cost of a speed debuff and having a dead slot for the rest of the battle . 
  or if not something that radically unique , then at minimum the length of the prot buff needs to be extended to three turns like most other buffs . 
  ** hook and slice **, 
  with some minor changes , i could see this having some utility as a low damage , high acc finishing move that works against any rank . 
  you do n't get the obscene damage of most bh moves , but get the versatility of a near-guaranteed hit in the bh repetoire . 
  and that nbc article conveniently neglects to mention that [ the rnc/gop hack seems to have * failed * ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-hacking-republican-party-may-have-failed-2016-12 ) . 
  meaning that no data worth leaking was obtained and shared with wikileaks . 
  ( there are a number of other sources saying this , but this one seems more credible ), 
  and yes , it 's true that in your hypothetical situation , it would prove wl to be biased and protecting b. 
  but that hypothetical has got nothing to do with reality , because they probably do n't have information on the gop to withhold in the first place . 
  and even if wikileaks did obtain information from russian intelligence to publish , it does n't necessarily mean they 're in russia 's pocket . 
  they published the dnc emails because the public had a vested interesting in knowing . 
  whether it was made available to them by a whistleblower or a foreign intelligence service is really irrelevant , as long as they do their due diligence , verify its ' authenticity and publish it . 
  i trust that if information harmful to the gop or even trump himself made into their hands , they would publish it , and it would not be their fault if russia had information on the gop that they did n't share with wl . 
  it 's not as if wl is in a position to make demands of russia . 
  so let me ask you , do you think wl should have withheld the dnc information they did have , until they got an equally incriminating piece on the rnc/gop ( of which we currently have no proof that they actually possess ) ? 
  potentially withholding the leak indefinitely ? 
  and from there , should they also have withheld the iraq leaks or the diplomatic cables , until they had equally incriminating information about china or russia ? 
  or do you agree that it 's nonsensical to delay the release of information already in hand until some hypothetical new leak can guarantee `` fair '' targeting ? 
  coded differently , yes . 
  poisons and enchantments are status effects on the arrow . 
  the bullseye perk is a hitscan spell that has a 15 % chance to be autocast every time you release an arrow , separate from the arrow itself . 
  it 's coded differently because the engine does n't let a player perk auto-add enchantment effects quite the way they needed them to . 
  first off , it means every weapon counts as having that enchantment and it ca n't be restricted to just bows and crossbows . 
  second , the paralysis effect itself does n't work on a flat percentage chance basis ; if a paralysis effect hits a target , it either works 100 % of the time ( possibly with reduced duration ) , or the target resists it 100 % of the time . 
  third , it would probably override existing enchantments of the weapon if they did it like that , because a weapon can only have one enchant effect and the engine does n't support `` appending '' an existing enchant . 
  the gamebryo engine is kind of shit like that .
