  particularly zealous or hateful astartes my outright reject the idea of tolerating any kind of xenos , even temporarily for an alliance of convenience . 
  `` we do n't need xenos ' help . 
  the emperor guides the righteous to victory . '', 
  and all that sort of thing . 
  and of course , astartes usually having some kind of history , it 's possible they hold old grudges against enemies they 've fought before . 
  there is politics . 
  there is ** a lot ** of politics . 
  especially in the imperium . 
  the imperium is divided into numerous factions , many with their own armies and naval forces . 
  the idea being that if one imperial power is corrupted by a madman or heretic in charge , the other powers can stop them . 
  it 's why the imperial guard ( i suppose the astra militarum , these days ) is n't allowed to have their own starships . 
  it 's why the imperial navy is n't allowed to have ground attack forces . 
  it 's why the large astartes legions were split up into smaller , more manageable chapters after the horus heresy . 
  it 's become kind of cliche , after the expansions of the first dawn of war games used it , but if internal imperial politics come to a head and nobody is interested in backing down , it 'll usually end with two or more imperial factions calling each other heretics and fighting it out in some localized region . 
  removing the `` one per planet '' restriction from a building is a very , very trivial mod to create . 
  and yes , there are larger overhaul mods that include this kind of thing .

  maga , one spicy burn at a time !, 
  it 's an algorithm gaming trick . 
  new subreddits that have n't had any content on the front page are artificially promoted there as a way of advertising small but `` trending '' new subs . 
  and of course , the admins continue to tolerate this kind of astroturfing as a matter of policy . 
  space marine chapters do have their own fleets . 
  declaring an exterminatus and actually holding orbit for long enough to carry it out are two different matters . 
  and here 's where imperial politics come into play : an inquisitor is still subject to the judgment of their fellow inquisitors . 
  a chapter master can likely turn to some other inquisitor and say the one calling his loyal chapter heretics and trying to exterminatus their recruitment worlds has gone mad or turned heretic , and actually be taken seriously . 
  that 's just it , it 's not the same thing at all . 
  breaking line of sight before the enemy has fully aimed and pulled the trigger is completely realistic . 
  moving out of the path of a bullet after it 's been fired is matrix-level dodging , which your colonists are n't ( and should n't be ) capable of . 
  the only reason bullet movement is that slow in the game is so the player has an overview of who 's shooting what . 
  and using [ intelligence he knew was fake ] ( http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=80731 ) to justify starting the russian hacking bandwagon among politicians , while withholding the fact the intel was fake . 
  it 's also a matter of resources . 
  in addition to inhospitable environment , those planets do n't actually have anything worth pursuing . 
  various anomalies and events repeatedly make mention of `` minerals that have no use to us '' . 
  still , afaik there 's at least one mod that makes all asteroids habitable . 
  she shut down the iss ? 
  i hope not for good . 
  that space station was expensive !, 
  you 're experiencing fog of war . 
  just because you ca n't see anything , does n't mean nothing is there . 
  it 's not like eu4 or ck2 , where you have perfect , 100 % visibility to every tile adjacent your own borders . 
  archimedes proved in 250bc that, 
  along with first recording the polygonal algorithm for rigorous calculation of pi , which dominated pi calculations until the late 1600s , when the infinite series technique was invented . 
  in addition , we have ancient mathematical expressions where we know the definition of pi `` by implication '' , meaning the engineers and mathematicians that authored these works did not actually record the exact value of pi in writing , but calculated it on the spot , thus showing the accuracy of their chosen value of pi only by the implication of their end result . 
  they basically did n't . 
  the vassals did what they wanted until they needed the emperor to protect them from foreign threats . 
  and then it was back to doing what they wanted . 
  yes , if your flank collapses , the enemy switches to attacking your center , and gets a 90 % damage bonus from attacking unopposed ( your center also does n't deal any damage to the unopposed enemy flank , until the your center routs the enemy center ) . 
  if both your flanks collapse , then both unopposed enemy flanks get a 270 % damage bonus attacking your center , for having both flanks unopposed . 
  also , if your center collapses first , but your flanks continue to hold out , then the enemy center immediately gets the full 270 % damage bonus against whichever surviving flank it proceeds to attack . 
  this is why a single big stack concentrated in the center is usually inferior to a smaller stack split across three flanks . 
  and these `` unopposed flank '' bonuses stack on top of things like the potential 300 % bonus from good tactics choices , as mentioned by others . 
  i 'd also add that there 's a combat modifier called experimentality , which is absolutely terrible and only gets more terrible as the leader 's martial score increases , because the game treats it as a positive trait . 
  hypothetically , it can give great damage bonuses by randomly increasing or decreasing your damage values . 
  in practice , all it takes is one bad experimentality roll for your army to get fucked , while one amazing experimentality roll is very rarely enough to decide an even battle . 
  at most , if you get lucky , experimentality can make an already easy battle even easier . 
  if you get a military leader with experimentality , do n't use them in combat . 
   like other ** stasi communist ** scum . 
  ftfy, 
  it does n't affect unopposed flanks as such . 
  the flanker trait means the leader gives a damage + defense bonus when the leader is in charge of one of the flanks . 
  whether that flank is fighting unopposed or fighting normally does n't affect that leader bonus , you get that bonus either way . 
  it 's basically equivalent to the `` leading the center '' bonus , except it works for the left and right flanks and not the center . 
   but if this kind of game design continues , pretty soon the elitists will be sitting in long queue times . 
  not only that , but they 'll also be stuck with fighting other elitists , that they ca n't just steamroll . 
  and media is naturally highlighting the incident where the guy went and pretended to be a nazi at a trump rally . 
  in light of his fanatical bernie support , it can be nothing but a false flag , as these `` hate crimes '' often are . 
  the cringe here is that this cancer is probably selling really well in the idiot demographic . 
  ftfy . 
  the queen was born back then , but she was n't queen until 1952 , seven years after the war . 
  i wonder if there 's a flavor news event for that should the game actually last that long . 
  edit : well , at least in vanilla there is n't . 
  hitler assassination is n't that unusual with historical focus off . 
  it is pretty much guaranteed to happen if britain and france go to war over czechoslovakia and germany does n't force czechoslovakia out of the war within 150 days . 
  from there , it 's a 20 % chance for hitler to be assassinated , or 33 % chance , if the allies have pushed any significant distance into germany . 
  care to explain why the usn is helping france design their navy ? 
  nah , probably not . 
  it 's just that the church of satan is publicly distancing itself from our opponents , rather than the other way around . 
  how the fuck did you even make it into orbit , let alone to the moon , like that ? 
  that 's a lie about phoebe . 
  she lets you grow up , and then stops pulling the punches . 
  and then she waits , patiently until your back is turned , your excess weapons sold to merchants , and your turrets shut off to save on power . 
  and then she punches again , just as hard as cassandra would have . 
  cassandra is consistent in her harshness . 
  phoebe is a total yandere , always waiting until you 've almost forgotten about her before she reminds you that she 's still in charge . 
  better read from the beginning . 
  the anime cut out a significant amount of character establishment and early development that was present in the manga . 
  replaced with a maintenance notice , now , so they 've probably noticed . 
  given that the [ main page ] ( http://www.kerberos-productions.com/ ) of the company site is still up , it 's probably nothing permanent . 
  edit : and there 's even a statement about website/forum tinkering on their twitter ( @solforce ) . 
  eh , well , the clausewitz engine does n't have * switch * functionality . 
  mostly because lua ( the language on which moddable files are based on ) does n't have * switch * functionality . 
  so this annoying series of nesting if/else blocks is the only way to do this with a single event . 
  which is unfortunately necessary , since iirc this is an anomaly , and the other way to make this happen would be making carbon-copy anomalies for every planet type , and giving each anomaly their own `` change planet temperature '' event . 
  leading the nation 's money into their pockets ( and the pockets of their major donors ) , the lot of them . 
  best case scenario for the us is to have both of the establishment parties collapse around the same time . 
  then maybe finally in the prevailing chaos and uncertainty , pushing through the constitutional change away from fptp will seem like the `` safe '' option to enough greedy senators and representatives . 
  send a pm to ` r/the _ donald ' and it should show up in their mod queue . 
  if they 've permanently banned you to the point you ca n't even do that , then just remember this as a life lesson : your actions can have permanent , unappealable consequences and remember to restrain yourself in the future ( whether you restrain your drinking or your negativity is up to you ) . 
  you ca n't always apologize and expect to be forgiven . 
  i do n't think they are , no .
