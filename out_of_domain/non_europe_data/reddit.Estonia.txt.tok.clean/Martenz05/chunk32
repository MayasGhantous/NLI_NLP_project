  after extensive play , i have yet to see an enemy be alive at 0 health , but it does occasionally happen with my heroes . 
  as far as i can tell , fractional healing is possible , while fractional damage is not . 
  ** merry men ** - finish a level 5 long mission with only male characters, 
  ** ride of the valkyries ** - finish a level 5 long mission with only female characters, 
  ** maidens of light ** - finish a level 5 long mission with four vestals, 
  ** star power ** - finish a level 5 long mission with four jesters, 
  ** quarantine now in effect ** - finish a level 5 long mission with four plague doctors, 
  ** split four ways ** - finish a level 5 long mission with four bounty hunters, 
  it 's a bug , obviously . 
  not sure what causes it , but i 've had torches , holy water and even rations end up in the trinket bank after a mission . 
  shift-click works to delete them , though . 
  i see , i guess it just got patched out before i had a chance to see it , then . 
  maybe a `` ship out '' ability that lets you send loot back to town while camping ? 
  the guilty conscience quirk also sometimes makes characters automatically activate confession booths in the ruins . 
  got a 3x33 crit with a highwayman 's grapeshot blast recently , thanks to clean guns , ancestral bracer and a bunch of other stacked bonuses i no longer recall . 
  highest single damage roll was 84 with a hellion . 
  i ca n't remember whether the attack was if it bleeds or wicked hack , but it was against a bone commander ( 2-tile target ) . 
  damage buffs included : adrenaline rush , 2x emboldening vapors , battle trance ( self camp buff ) and the camp buff from bounty hunter that grants a buff against two-tile targets . 
  it also means increased heal for the vestal if she uses judgment , which is useful without being op . 
  and i completely agree that a `` healing given '' buffs and trinkets would make healers op . 
  occultist healing is already borderline op with a cleansing crystal ( reduce bleed chance ) . 
  combine with a buff to healing strength would make it even more so . 
  it 's mainly useful for synergy the occultist 's healing skill , which can definitely be huge . 
  it 's not about having more than one volunteer . 
  it 's about the game not letting op choose who volunteers . 
  op has 8 soldiers who should qualify for becoming volunteer . 
  game says only one soldier qualifies for being volunteer ( probably not the one he wanted to make volunteer ) . 
  and trying again after reload , it apparently said two soldiers qualify . 
  probably because the stress spiral happened during the fight . 
  characters get disobedient and pass , suicide themselves or attack without prompt , wasting precious retreat opportunities, 
  in estonian , general diminutive is done by adding '' - ke '' to the possessive case of the word . 
  for instance `` koer '' is dog , `` koera '' is dog 's and `` koerake '' is doggy ( and `` koerakese '' is doggy 's ) . 
  however , the most common child-talk words have become distinct words in their own right , rather than something formed based on general diminutive . 
  in child-talk estonian , doggy and kitty are most commonly `` kutsa '' and `` kiisu '' ; mommy and daddy are `` emme '' and `` issi '' , not `` emake '' and `` isake '' ( these words do exist as well , but are not used in that context ) . 
  muscle size based off gun caliber ? 
  that would make arty the most muscular . 
  probably thinking of ` j' . 
  there 's no ` j' character in the russian alphabet , but there are ` ja ' ` je ' ` jo ' and ` ju ' characters . 
  it gets easier , but bone commander + spearman is still a massive threat to a party . 
  surprisingly , i do n't find front line jester odd at all . 
  starting at level 2 ( with equipment upgrades ) jesters are great at dodge-tanking , especially with a + dodge trinket or two . 
  crusader-jester in the front two slots is amazing against both the swine bosses and all the hags . 
  holy lance reaches into position 3 ; dirk stab reaches into position 3 and resets crusader position for another holy lance . 
  the back slots are kind of irrelevant in the boss fight . 
  i basically pick whoever can give the best camping buffs to crusader and jester . 
  and probably gr or hwy to deal with traps and scouting on the way to the boss . 
  the nobles are being `` persuaded '' to hand off younger relatives to train under the tutelage of black lotus . 
  ostensibly , this is a beneficial relationship : black lotus gets agents that can pass for legitimate nobility in their operations , the nobles no longer have the obligation to pay for the lifestyles of distant cousins that do n't stand to inherit anything anyway . 
  on top of that , they get adequately prepared spies and assassins out of those cousins , should they ever return . 
  in reality , the `` apprentices '' are not that distant as relatives , are being held captive , and are being indoctrinated to some degree to be loyal to black lotus . 
  challenge accepted . 
  i 'm such a manly duke , that even my daughters come out strong enough to hold their own in fistfights . 
  they can force a draw even against the strongest of opponents . 
  i feel you . 
  i always hit the same problem with my characters . 
  solstheim is flat out . 
  it 's endgame content for when you 've beaten the mq . 
  some of the toughest enemies of requiem are in solstheim . 
  i made the mistake , once , of using live another life to start as a dunmer refugee in raven rock . 
  never again . 
  you might want to try your hand at kiting giants and mammoths in whiterun . 
  you 'll probably have to abuse ai pathfiding a lot , though , which could be immersion breaking for you . 
  dragur crypts should be doable as well , though , if you have fire runes , sunbolt and a ton of magicka and stamina potions in your arsenal . 
  the assumption of a civil war in estonia is ... somewhat absurd , really . 
  for one , there 's very little local support for separatism or deposing the elected government by force . 
  it 's also unlikely that estonian law enforcement and counter-intelligence agencies completely fuck up and fail to arrest the members of a local fringe group before they get armed well enough that the matter needs military action , rather than police action . 
  even then , the estonian military is capable of quickly overcoming any purely local fringe group . 
  russian support of fabricated separatists is also very difficult to hide . 
  `` russians on vacation '' are plausible , but the equipment is a problem . 
  estonia has discarded most , if not all , of its ' soviet-era equipment . 
  russia ca n't just send the separatists outdated soviet equipment and pretend it originates from defected or captured estonian stockpiles . 
  since estonia uses western equipment these days , russia ca n't send matching models of vehicles to the separatists . 
  plus , there are already nato troops in estonia . 
  realistically , the matter of the estonian civil war would already have led to one of three outcomes :, 
  * estonia swiftly crushes its ' rebels thanks to nato air support ;, 
  * russia moves troops into estonian ( and therefore nato ) territory openly enough that article 5 goes into effect , war breaks out, 
  * as above , but nato just disintegrates over the lack of article 5 response in estonia , which is obviously an unacceptable option to nearly any us politician, 
  at most , russians could overrun the baltics and make a few moves into poland before nato gets its shit together . 
  after that , either the polish forces push the russians back with german and british ( and possibly french ) ground reinforcements . 
  and then either everything goes nuclear , or the americans arrive just in time to ~ ~ steal the glory ~ ~ finish liberating the baltics and assist with containing russia within its ' borders . 
  hm ... that 's true . 
  i did use azirok , and the last time i went to solstheim was in the days of requiem 1.7 . x, 
  and yeah , going to solstheim ... actually , i 'm not 100 % sure if it 's even possible to go to solstheim before you 've encountered cultists unless you use lal to start there . 
  the ship captain is reluctant to go back , and it 's possible you wo n't be able to persuade him unless you 've already triggered the start of the db questline . 
  edit : original train of thought : going to solstheim would most likely break immersion in your case . 
  it 's borderline impossible to avoid running into the db questline on the island and being treated as dragonborn . 
  for instance , you would have to avoid sleeping to prevent being captivated by the standing stones in your sleep . 
  either that , or the way gw intends for us to buy op units and build armies like that . 
  terror mission targets are decided at the start of the month , and afaik they always target the country with the highest panic . 
  so it 's possible for a country to be marked for a terror mission at the start of the month , but then leave the council during the month , before the terror mission hits it . 
  resulting in a terror mission in a country that 's already left . 
  as herpygerstmcderp noted , aliens can do infiltration missions that instantly cause countries to leave . 
  since they had 8-10 meld in july , it 's plausible they had just enough resources to decide on spawning an infiltration mission . 
  making a sympathetic villain in 40k is hard indeed . 
  i think it can work , though . 
  you can give them a sympathetic background , yes , but you also need to make it completely clear they 're just so far gone that they need to die . 
  always leave in the possible interpretation that the sappy backstory is just an excuse that the villain uses to justify sacrificing infants to chaos . 
   dos is weapon or action dependent . 
  will come back to this . 
  he forgot to come back to this .
