  putting it to good use with my new character . 
  depends , really . 
  i 'm estonian , and i 'm fairly certain it was mentioned . 
  not in detail , of course , but the occupation of poland ( as well as the rest of ww2 ) was covered in significant detail , and the battle was noted on the maps and briefly mentioned in the text . 
  also , [ sabaton 's 40:1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epeqwq-ayv0 ), 
  in the first phrase , ` kannahabe ' is more accurately ` cannabeard ' ( as in cannabis ) . 
  ` n\u00f5iak\u00fctt ' is ` witch hunter ' . 
  nice to see something from estonia posted here . 
  / u/theimij gave good points on early smithing . 
  i 'd also add that its only hard getting to smithing 50 . 
  because at 50 , you can take the perk for making jewelry , which is ridiculously efficient in terms of material : value , meaning you start advancing really quickly after you get the jewelry perk . 
  just make sure you stockpile any gemstones you find . 
  a word of warning , though . 
  it 's not a smart idea to powerlevel to smithing 100 without improving combat skills . 
  requiem is deleveled , but reaching level 20 is what enables random dragon attacks ( including the really powerful dragons , because deleveled world ) . 
  you want some method of quickly dealing damage to the dragon while it 's busy nomming on the hold guards or giants or whatever else you can lure it into . 
  tried the current beta mod about two weeks ago . 
  is the ui going to see any kind of further polish ? 
  the white/near-black contrasts between window frames and various background elements definitely gets hard to look at after half an hour or so . 
  well , that explains it . 
  i was experimenting on lydia , so if she 's essential/protected , that might explain it . 
  honestly , i think it 's a good thing to have some protected/essential companions in requiem . 
  i 'd understand followers dying in a pitched battle . 
  dying because they get stuck on some rocks while i 'm busy in another part of the room , not so much . 
  or when they get smashed in the face by a blatantly obvious and easily evaded trap . 
  yes , it could be seen as accidental if it happened only on occasion and at random to different kinds of changes . 
  but it 's happening consistently with major balance/grind changes ; and all of those `` simple mistakes '' just randomly happen with nerfs that would piss off their customers ? 
  sorry , not buying it . 
  de 's problem lies with incompetent decision-makers , not with incompetent programmers failing at documentation . 
  a dedicated verb for expressing `` i 'm feeling too lazy to do x '' . 
  ... since when is apathy a verb ? 
  in vanilla , it 's called a `` light plasma rifle '' , which is too long for the remembrance wall in-game . 
  we 'd see the text scrolling back and forth , if it was a . gif or a video instead of a screenshot . 
  a few questions : what level is your character ? 
  what 2h skill level/perks do they have ? 
  how much damage does your 2h weapon have according to inventory ? 
  check the mcm settings under combat to see if you have a particularly high weapon damage multiplier or damage modifiers . 
  at around level 15 , my 2h-focused character * can * kill giants reasonably quickly , if there 's a distraction that stops the giant from sending her into the space program . 
  still it 's possibly a bug , so i 'll pre-emptively ask for your load order . 
  around level 20 , battles with a single giants are entirely winnable . 
  even so , i 'm pretty sure it 's a bug , because you seem to be using some of the outdated requiem patches meant for requiem 1.7 . x , while using requiem 1.8 . x. 
  azirok 's patch central is entirely outdated , i believe . 
  the new patch central by thetrader is [ here ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61621/ ? ), 
  at the very least , as far as i know , this is the only up-to-date requiem patch for dragonborn : http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60508/, 
  it 's even more ironic : it would be an anti-fascist pact . 
  if putin is turning russia into anything , it 's fascism not communism . 
  an alternative approach is light armor in the chest slot and heavy armor in the other slots . 
  particularly if you 're fortunate enough to come across steel plate or dwarven armor sets , which is a massive slowdown at lower levels because of the weight . 
  iirc , i finally had the stamina and health to put on the full set of steel plate chest around level 12 . 
  then again , i was playing against racial advantages as a bosmer heavy armor/2h . 
  estonian here . 
  i 'd like for it to be about the armored train ( counter - ) offensives against red russians during our war of independence . 
  the estonian liberation of neighburing latvia ( or at least riga ) from the german * landeswehr * would be a fine topic as well . 
  though i imagine it 's possible to write a whole album about the military feats that happened on the tail end of ww1 and in the few years after the war . 
  as the russian empire was going into civil war , germany went for a last-ditch offensive land grab to have leverage in the peace negotiations . 
  so many freshly independent countries in eastern europe , estonia included , ended up fighting on two fronts against two great powers of the time . 
  and somehow pulled it off . 
   [ occult = bush = ig farben = nazis = wunderweapons = paper clip = micc-tt = rma = emasculated u.s. military = nwo vs caliphate = apocalypse ] ( http://www.combatreform.org/transformationunderfire/index.htm ), 
  and this is what happens if we excessively invoking the stronkness of the m113 and call it ` gavin ' . 
  cancer in the subreddit goes up 42.33 % and a brigadier general suddenly dies of an aneurism . 
  hmm ... so i gather you have a demense duchy or county within your vassal 's de jure borders ? 
  i suspect he might be stacking other mechanics-changing mods on top of requiem , which results in conflicts that make requiem easier than it 's intended to be . 
  that , or he 's just letting out hot air to seem like an expert in front of the stream audience . 
  problem being , the game does n't differentiate `` acted dishonorably - stole as regent '' from `` acted dishonorably - murdered the heir you wanted out of succession anyway '' after the opinion penalty is applied . 
  if a guy has `` acted dishonorably '' against you at least one , the game sees that and qualifies him for righteous imprisonment . 
  they way i see what op explained in practice would be this :, 
  each curio has a large set of potential outcomes , let 's say 15 . 
  let 's take a scrolls curio . 
  on normal interaction , it has 15 % ( option a ) , 35 % ( option b ) 50 % ( option c ) . 
  ( random item ) interaction ( option d ) . 
  when you create a new save , the game assigns values to the random stuff , probably weighted/restricted to produce sensible results . 
  for instance , ( random item ) would be restricted to holy water or torch in our torch example . 
  similar to how burning knowledge can be good or bad , pouring holy water on evil scrolls could have a negative result ( stress from disturbing reaction ) or a positive one ( ritual puts character at ease ) . 
  you 'd have to experiment to find out , and the results would be recorded in a `` curio lab '' in town . 
  while i do n't support it in any way , this is n't quite accurate . 
  the judge will be given those details , in private , but they wo n't be revealed to anyone else . 
  then the judge says `` this guy in a black suit and sunglasses , nevermind what agency , came up to me an told me this case endangers national security . 
  based on what he told me , i 've decided he 's right and this case ca n't go on . '', 
  not quite a bug . 
  iceland is just so far from everything else , that an ai that only has icelandic territory often decides the rest of the world is too far away to bother with the whole hassle of moving . 
  and i 'm guessing the simulator will end the world when dwarf fortress ( [ and its ' definition of fun ] ( http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/v0.34:losing ) ) is assimilated ? 
  i love it how there are more soldiers in the background , enviously looking at the lucky few who get to take an up-close look . 
  would n't that mean ` housewives ' would n't be counted for purposes of unemployment either ? 
  seems to me like the definition of unemployment you described already accounts for cultural differences , making male-only unemployment statistics redundant . 
  i think by `` media '' he means `` hollywood cop shows '' , not actual news media . 
  visible signs of corruption in the dryads is a good idea . 
  and i love the idea that the ` standard ' ~ ~ murderhobo ~ ~ *** adventurer *** solution ( killing the dryads ) is only going to make it worse . 
  what happens if the players think the black tree is the source of the corruption and try to chop it down , or even succeed at doing so ? 
  i 'd recommend making chopping/burning the tree impossible . 
  perhaps a spirit of one of the hanged criminals gets out and attempts to possess whoever damaged the tree ? 
  while i agree the american system is fucked up , i 've also seen the other end of the spectrum here in estonia . 
  if a case does n't get media attention and the crime is n't some form of vigilantism , our courts will let pretty much anyone who pleads guilty without making a fuss out on parole . 
  headlines were made here a while ago , about how a car thief was convicted for the 17th time for his `` job '' . 
  he received a fine and a probationary sentence , because the judge found him `` appropriately apologetic and interested in rehabilitation '' . 
  he spent less than 24 hours in prison . 
  goes to show that all lenience all the time is not a solution either . 
  there 's a rising sentiment here that there 's no point in reporting a crime to police any more , and that victims should simply gather up a posse and take matters into their own hands . 
  hmm ... so i probably should n't defend my ( hypothetical ) property with land mines ? 
  ah , but that 's a crime that embarrasses the justice system . 
  they will deal with seriously and give harsh sentences for , because it highlights their own failures .
