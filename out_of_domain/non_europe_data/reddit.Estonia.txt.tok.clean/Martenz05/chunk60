  go after the tyranid and risk having chaos marines get to mcguffin first ? 
  or let it flee and risk it attacking the imperial outpost the team 's thunderhawk landed at . 
  and obviously , the players do n't need to be immediately aware of all the potential consequences . 
  as far as the second idea goes , i 'd say it 's more than a bit shaky when it comes to lore . 
  mind you , i 'm not saying `` you ca n't do this '' . 
  it 's your game after all , and you certainly can do whatever you like . 
  i 'm just saying `` this is stuff you should probably address in your plot '', 
  ** first ** , if there are `` local space marines '' , then they would know about the codex astartes . 
  the 8000-year timeframe you 've set is a bit late for the space marines to be a legion detachment , though not entirely out of the question . 
  ** second ** , i doubt the space marines , no matter how resigned , would simply * let * the colonists do as they please with their genseed . 
  if the colonists are trying to reverse-engineer astartes creation , then at the very least the original space marines would make sure to oversee the process and make sure the result is not straight-out heretical . 
  ** third ** , only the toughest and most resilient humans can survive the geneseed implantation , which is why space marines have very strict screening and brutal initiation trials even before the candidates get implanted with geneseed . 
  although being a warzone against feral orks is certainly fertile ground for suitable candidates , i doubt a single solar system could produce 1m actual space marines in 8000 years . 
  ** finally ** , there 's the matter of equipment . 
  producing astartes power armor and weapons is not trivial , and if the isolated colony had enough intact industrial capacity and expertise to produce quality equipment for a million space marines , they they would likely have had means to reestablish contact with the imperium before 8000 years passed by . 
  i have to admit , 1001 is an odd maximum in that case . 
  since integer storage works in powers of two , a `` round '' cutoff point would be 1023 or 511 , as 1000 takes up as much space in memory as 1023 would . 
  wow , way to put words into my mouth . 
  of course unicums have actual skill . 
  but spamming gold ammo and consumables does give a boost to players that do n't have the time to practice wot six or more hours a day . 
  the regular he is usually good enough , too . 
  maybe the reward leveling is intended for shriekwind bastion , nearby ? 
  that dungeon has some high-level vampires in it . 
  i know when i was first reading your post , i thought the brittleshin was the pass with vampires . 
  aim for the side armor of the tall central hull section in the center , above the tracks . 
  with a doctor 's salary , you could certainly be in the estonian upper middle class , but the standards for umc in estonia are significantly lower than they are in america . 
  one important cultural difference that comes into play here is the estonian aversion to taking loans . 
  many people here see taking a loan to buy something as living above your means , even if you 're perfectly capable of paying off the loan . 
  without that irrational stigmata attached to taking loans , you might be able to get yourself into what qualifies as upper-class living standards for estonia , provided you manage your finances well and do n't go overboard . 
  you 're not the only one interested in something like that . 
  i do n't know if anyone has fixed the issue , but i do recall someone on this subreddit saying that taking infinite magicka away from npc mages nerfs them into complete impotence . 
  de has yet to make an announcement that warframe is out of beta , yes . 
  though i ca n't recall when they last actually referred to the game a being in beta , either . 
  most likely , they intend to keep the beta card indefinitely , so they can use it as an emergency excuse if they commit a colossal blunder of some sort . 
  if that 's the case , then it 's the nurses problem for consenting to additional duties without additional pay . 
  while it 's undoubtedly a shady method of reducing salary costs , it 's up to the employees to call out their employer on this kind of thing and take them to court if necessary . 
  a normal `` nice '' car costs in the ballpark of 30-40k $ brand new . 
  though i know several estonians who have actually gone to germany to buy their new car , because it 's cheaper there ( even with the travel expenses ) than it is in estonia . 
  as far as nice houses go , it depends heavily on location . 
  there are some pretty nice houses in the 50-75k range , but they 're all hours away from where you 're likely to have a well-paid job as a doctor or lawyer . 
  the moment you enter the city limits of any sizable town , you 're looking at 100k + even for complete dumps , if there 's even a house ( and not an apartment ) available . 
  as for visiting america , yeah . 
  traveling to the states from estonia is expensive . 
  pretty much the only destination more expensive to get to is australia . 
  the facts of geography dictating the price of travel . 
  ai ca n't deal with decadence ? 
  really ? 
  since when ? 
  last i recall , a decadence revolt has exactly two potential outcomes : a ) `` revolt wins : the giant green blob now has a new and improved ruler '' b ) `` revolt defeated : every vassal in giant green blob now loves ruler and provides more levy '', 
  a [ real-estate ad ] ( http://www.kv.ee/loksa-ilus-linn-kus-on-hea-infrastruktuur-sobralik-2552350.html?nr=16&amp;search_key=8b087c404de5b9a037e77a4fea21ff1e ) of what i 'd consider a nice house . 
  though this is 90min of motorway away from the capital 's city limits , plus city traffic to the workplace . 
   also , idk about estonia , but in america doctors make more living in rural areas, 
  this unfortunately is n't really the case in estonia . 
  the scale of distances is completely different here . 
  it 's completely viable for ambulances to transport critical patients from rural areas to city hospitals . 
  in fact , it 's cheaper for the government to pay for maintaining a medical transport helicopter than it is for them to subsidize doctors and hospitals for rural areas . 
  the main problem , a doctor in rural estonia is unlikely to have a full workload 's worth of patients . 
  thus , the smaller , rural hospitals are struggling as various specialist doctors congregate in the major towns . 
  it has to do with communism , but not in the way you describe . 
  yes , it was communist policy to encourage urbanization . 
  however , estonians have traditionally been a rural people . 
  and the degree to which estonians despise and reject communist ideals is quite extreme . 
  the lack of doctors in rural areas has more to do with estonians embracing the rules of capitalism and the free market . 
  if anything , the soviet regime was propping up rural areas with the kolkhoz and sovkhoz systems of agriculture administration . 
  the same goes for the urbanization : people are leaving the rural areas because there are n't as many well-paid jobs to be had . 
  small farms are being bought up by big agricultural companies , which prefer to import cheaper labor from elsewhere , rather than hiring locally . 
  well , i 'm sure you 've at least heard of europe 's refugee crisis . 
  there 's also cheaper-than-estonian labor available through work-visas in russia , belarus and ukraine . 
  the biggest difference is , agri-companies ca n't afford to pay more than minimum wage and remain profitable . 
  meanwhile , estonian quality of life expectations and living costs have gotten high enough that locals wo n't take the agri-sector jobs unless they get significantly more than minimum wage . 
  there are many other , far easier , jobs available at minimum wage . 
  this is fortress mode , right ? 
  or can i actually set up my own tavern and build structures in adventurer mode now ? 
  wait , what ? 
  you can load magma into minecarts ( and i 'm guessing magma-safe buckets ? ) ? 
  how ? 
  i thought the only way to get magma smelting closer to the surface was massive pump stacks . 
  [ really now ? 
  ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-14/russian-jet-nearly-collided-with-passenger-plane-sweden-says/5965816 ), 
  pretty sure i saw a video where one of the devs said vipers ca n't grab and constrict on the same turn . 
  that the `` grab + constrict in a single turn '' we saw in the footage was just scripted in to make the demo they were showing more exciting . 
  is n't there also an vote-fudging algorithm , which reduces the amount of upvotes actually displayed for posts with very high vote counts ? 
  there are plenty of men who would n't be good in a fight . 
  they still have to register . 
  to be cleansed - that is the fate of all xenos !, 
  still good against afvs and supply trucks , though . 
  the a-10s would be perfectly capable if russia tried to use `` little green men '' . 
  obviously , they would n't be much use in the event of an open russian attack . 
  first , test on a rabbit ( guaranteed level 1 creature ) to verify rise dead ii works on a basic level . 
  then continue testing on bandits and whatever other human corpses you come across to narrow down the specific level of human you can raise with the spell . 
  absolutely . 
  it 's what happened to estonia , just south of finland , after it gave in to soviet demands and let the soviets establish military bases in estonia . 
  annexed completely less than a year after allowing the bases . 
  but what if it 's crackling with lightning ? 
  is n't that just as good as being on fire ? 
  i could see that reasonable logic being overriden by `` oh shit loanshark is going to fuck me up if i do n't pay back fast . '', 
  they might ... in fine print on the bottom of some page everyone just glances over at best . 
  mostly because the emperor gave them permission to swim thusly . 
  so now that you 've learned that , do you enjoy 30-minute wait queues more than being useless on most maps . 
  sack ?
