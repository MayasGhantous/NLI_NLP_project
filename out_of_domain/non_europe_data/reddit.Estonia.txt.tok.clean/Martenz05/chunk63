  do n't expect to be able to drive on the ice road , though . 
  it 's entirely possible the road wo n't be opened at all , if the winter is too soft and wet . 
  and looking at your scheduly , the ice road is right out . 
  not a chance in hell the road will still be open in spring . 
  it 's usually open from late january to early/mid-february if it opens at all . 
  i 'm pretty sure the daedric boots from giant slaughterfish was just someone getting really lucky with loot rng . 
  even in states without at-will employment , employment can still be terminated if the employee breaks employment contract . 
  not performing to the level demanded by the contract is a valid reason for firing . 
  likewise , even a half-decent contract would have clauses for downsizing . 
  an employer can already have adequate protections even without at-will . 
  at-will regulations are a deliberate imbalance of power in the favor of the employers , which the employers have actively lobbied for . 
  note that * ment * is a somewhat derogatory term for police . 
  comparing with english slang , * ment * is better than ` pig ' , but worse than ` cop ' . 
  calling an actual police officer * ment * to the face might not be a great idea . 
  unless the game locks out customization options for unique characters , like it did in eu/ew . 
  in fact , britain , usa and canada are the only countries that use the short scale . 
  even all the other former british colonies do it the sensible way . 
   the official designation of the ship-type is `` heavy nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser '' ( russian : \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0451\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0435\u0440 ) , but because of their size and general appearance , the ships are often referred to as battlecruisers by western defense commentators . 
  make sure to learn some basic conversational estonian . 
  it 's alright if you butcher the pronunciation and/or grammar . 
  i assure you , people will be quite impressed that you 've even bothered to try . 
  many foreigners coming here just find out they can manage everything they need with english or russian and do n't bother with estonian . 
  there are considerations besides protection here , though . 
  she could remove the armor on her human part by herself . 
  but armor on her horse part ? 
  would probably need assistance with that . 
  that officer is wearing what i think is an old officer 's jacket over current casual fatigues , hence the mismatch . 
  depending on when the picture was taken , that particular combination might valid dress code . 
  the uniform regs in estonia allow mixing current uniform elements with older ones during transitional periods . 
  basically : if logistics has n't issued him the new officer 's jacket yet , he 's allowed to mix the mismatching elements . 
  he 's also a lieutenant colonel , so the junior officers and grunts under him probably wo n't call him out on it even if it 's not a valid combination . 
  it 's not that the corporations do n't want money from the female demographic . 
  they do . 
  they just want the male and female demographics to be distinct and clearly separated for marketing reasons . 
  it 's easier ( less risky ) for them to create two shows , one marketed for boys and another for girls , than a single show that tries ( and likely fails ) to be successful with both demographics . 
  hence why the corporations have an interest in reinforcing the gender divide . 
  stupid , but then again a lot of the marketing people are aged 40 + and completely out of touch with how the minds of younger generations work these days . 
  they just assume that younger generations still basically think the same way they used to when our current marketers were first learning their job 15-20 years ago . 
  here 's the thing : it 's also unconstitutional for courts to punish legislators for the legislation they create . 
  courts can strike down bad legislation , but they ca n't go after the elected representatives that created it . 
  separation of judicial and legislative power and all that . 
  exactly . 
  almost all of the `` cool '' mods for bethesda games require having a script extender for the game . 
  damn , you made me remember how sad i was when i found out valkyria chronicles could not be modded . 
  because hardcoding ai behavior to individual maps is a bit of a show-stopper when you want to create new maps . 
   the uploader has not made this video available in your country . 
  thanks for actually saying linking what it is , for those of us who ca n't see the video . 
  definitely checking this out . 
  while the t-90ms definitely needs a nerf , the 2a6 could use a slight buff to gun handling . 
  either slower bloom or faster aim time , i 'd say . 
  while i wo n't argue some players are terrible at pve , there are other balance issues in pve . 
  to list the bigger ones :, 
  * some maps are borderline impossible without player arty in the team . 
  * ai arty is frustratingly smart ( i.e , it will always wait to cb player arty ) . 
  * terminator/ramka ammo sponges in tier 5-6 operations . 
  * bmp he spam . 
  * inability to one-shot weak ai tanks . 
  as noted by / u/rdm13 , the jester is the problem in your team . 
  that character is only a few steps short of being dead weight in the team . 
  taking the jester into the dungeon means you had to leave a more useful character behind . 
  unless the team is completely optimized around taking advantage of the jester 's abilities , that is , in which case he can be a pretty amazing crit and bleed machine . 
  he 's the [ lethal joke character ] ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/lethaljokecharacter ) of this game . 
  was n't there some species jellyfish that was basically immortal , because it evolved perfect cell replication ? 
  the reason the one-shot thing bothers me is because it basically defeats the purpose of having sc ammo in mbts . 
  if your sc has the damage potential to one-shot them , but the game forces a two-shot minimum , you might as well just two-shot them with ap and not bother with switching ammo types . 
  so this is latvian gratitude for liberating riga from landeswehr pigdogs in 1919 ? 
  you no have potato because you ingrateful no deserve it !, 
  only in some programs . 
  notably , many software development interfaces only use shift + ctrl + z for redo . 
  it gets even worse if ctrl + y actually does has a function other than redo . 
  [ manga spoilers ] ( / s `` yes , that girl who fights rory is the demigoddess of hardy , who is the god of the underworld . 
  but rory is the demigoddess of emory , who is the god of death . 
  as far as the genders do , i think it 's a bit ambigous . 
  rory and the other demigoddess are both obviously female , but the gods are less clear-cut . 
  especially since the story does n't clarify the details of the marriage hardy wants to force on rory : a few scenes in the manga define it as hardy & rory , but other scenes say it 's other demigoddess & rory '' ), 
  well , that explains why sweden is willing to get so close . 
  but how come finland has n't stabbed him for the personal space intrusion ? 
  you forgot to escape the parentheses in the link . 
  needs to be like this,

  it 's not really about stopping the world from changing . 
  religious fundamentalism is an ideology . 
  like every ideology , it has specific ideas about what the world should be like , and how the world should change toward its ' ideal . 
  it just so happens the ideals of islamic fundamentalists are abhorrent to those of us that hold western ideals . 
  well , spoilage coverage does make sense for refrigerators . 
  it might be that they just had their lawyer write up a single `` universal '' warranty document that covered all appliances . 
  parsing word count in addition to specific keywords would make the bot slower , though . 
  i suspect it might even clog the kickbot outright . 
  try posting the question to / r/gamesupport . 
  it was n't the government holding that much debt . 
  it was the private banks . 
  the way borrowing money is supposed to work is that if someone is in too much debt already , nobody is willing to lend them more money . 
  for some reason , people in expensive suits believe that this failsafe mechanic did n't need to be applied to banks and government because infinite economic growth and other buzzwords . 
  because banks also provide financial advice when somebody takes a loan . 
  at the very minimum , the bank should analyze a person 's financial situation and tell them : `` no , you wo n't be able to pay this loan back , so we 're not giving you money . '' . 
  instead , the banks told people something along these lines : `` do n't worry if you do n't have enough income and savings to keep paying back the interest two years from now . 
  by next year , that house you 're buying is going to be worth so much you can pay back the loan and still have enough left over to buy a cheaper house . '',
