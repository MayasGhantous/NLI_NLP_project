  putin might be many things , but communist is n't one of them . 
  ideologically , he 's an opportunist and nothing else . 
  he might pretend to follow some ideology publicly from time to time , but his only goal is staying in power . 
  what did you expect , then ? 
  i 'm ... genuinely confused about what you 're trying to say about estonians . 
  i 'm not defending putin by saying he 's not a communist . 
  he 's a power-hungry tyrant . 
  just pointing out that communist ideology has very little to do with putin 's motivations . 
  the fact that he 's got no ideology beyond staying in power actually makes him less predictable and more dangerous to russia 's neighbors like estonia . 
  if he and his cronies were really communists , then at least the west would have no illusions about russia being a democracy . 
  truth is , the political elite in the west is trying really hard to pretend russia is a normal country , and not a third-world shithole . 
  this possibility has existed since before way of life . 
  i may be misremembering , but the first time i saw this was in old gods . 
  it happens if you make a regular betrothal , but later something changes so the ai would no longer accept the original betrothal . 
  if this is the case , you need to go to diplomacy yourself and prompt the ai to honor original betrothal ( which they usually will ) . 
  from your bugged typewriters , of course . 
  the anime seems to have rushed past a lot of scenes presented in the manga . 
  it 's only something like 7-8 chapters behind . 
  meaning : the non-fictional ice ix form of water . 
   ... on the internet is an image of planepacked ... 
  besides the existing suggestions , i also recommend looking through the deathwatch books . 
  the region deathwatch is set in , jericho reach , is a rediscovered sector being pacified by an imperial crusade . 
  the gm sections about the setting give quite a bit of detail about this kind of thing . 
  clearly , he was killed by a hellion . 
  probably turned by siren . 
  / r/ofcoursethatsathing, 
  if you 're burnt out enough that you 're becoming horrible in your current role , you may as well get a pay rise out of it . 
  in tetris , blocks rotate in one direction only . 
  in the gif , they rotate the `` wrong '' way , compared to the game . 
  [ osteoporosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osteoporosis ) and [ osteopetrosis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osteopetrosis ) are different words for different conditions . 
  bones also become brittle if they are too dense . 
  aaand ... this is different from us how ? 
  medieval book burning were generally about religious texts that were deemed heretical , not scientific treatises . 
  the burning of scientific books is a myth , not a fact . 
  nope . 
  scientific regression is largely a myth , it was just temporary stagnation at most . 
  it was more about the political and cultural chaos following the collapse of western rome and the mass-migration of germanic tribes . 
  sounds like a cool idea . 
  though i do vaguely recall the draconomicon of some edition stating that dragons do n't have `` mixbreed '' forms , since the dragon matures into one or the other of their parents ' subspecies . 
  the problem is noticing when a governor dies . 
  even worse , the eventual reveal about how wwi propaganda was bullshit made people in the us highly skeptical of reports describing the holocaust . 
  then what would be the point of buying spectre blueprints ? 
  and how would that work with people from opposing syndicates being in a pub team together ? 
  there is a map there , thankfully . 
  here 's a [ better link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war#peace ) . 
  i 'm guessing it was the revelation that the empire had taken slaves from japan . 
  and the subsequent asskicking that was unleashed . 
  capitalizing on the enemies surprise , i 'd say . 
  as big as the throne room was , it was still extremely close quarters as far as gun are concerned . 
  if she let the imperial solders recover from surprise , they could still have charged and overwhelmed her with numbers as she reloaded . 
  plus , she was probably just as outraged by the slavery as punch-the-prince itami was . 
  to elaborate , it was strictly better because it triggered the ambush overwatch shots on the ayys turn as they scrambled for cover and then you got a full round of actions in addition to the overwatch , without the ayys getting a full turn between the overwatch and your own turn . 
  so basically give turrets a melee attack called point-blank shot ? 
  sounds reasonable . 
  well , there wo n't be any meaningful un response . 
  the us would just veto anything actually damaging , like sanctions . 
  that 's not to say individual nations and other bodies could n't put sanctions in place . 
  would be interesting to see what happens if the eu put large-scale sanctions against the us into effect . 
  that 's my point . 
  it would be interesting to see what happens if `` too big to fail '' is just allowed to fail . 
  yes , exactly that . 
  there are also these annoying pods that stay still for a turn or two , before they resume patrolling . 
  you ca n't be sure that a pod will stay still , and you ca n't be sure it will walk into your soldier in the open . 
  i 'd say the only way to make it challenging is to make the jsdf the enemy . 
  maybe in an alternate setting where japan goes full-imperialist on the special region for the oil and other resources . 
  something similar to x-com 2 , perhaps ? 
  imperial loyalists ( or simply rebels who realize the special region is being taken advantage of ) inventing guerrilla tactics to resist the occupation . 
  could also be a fun open-world rpg with multiple ~ ~ good/bad ~ ~ bad/ambigous endings . 
  no , you are not . 
  only reason i chose nvidia when i built my first computer was because amd driver support for linux was really , really crap at the time . 
  borderline nonexistent , in fact . 
  after that , it was just brand loyalty that i never saw reason to question until quite recently . 
  making an omelet . 
  everyone 's got their own variation of water/egg/flour proportions and preparation process . 
  to be fair , it 's not like merkel 's predecessors were any better . 
  schroeder in particular comes to mind . 
  the guy was nothing but a puppet of the oil and gas industries . 
  it 's because jumping over cover tiles , climbing up ladders and dropping down through skylights does not cost any additional movement points , as far as i can tell . 
  or the amount it costs is so negligible that it does n't have noticeable impact on the pathing algorithm . 
  it defines the natural body temperature of a ~ ~ creature ~ ~ species . 
  setting it extremely high does ** not ** make them fireproof . 
  do note that changing [ homeoterm  might not work ( or possibly break your game ) in the latest version of df . 
  urist mcvoliol up above believes that it has been moved from raws to hardcoded functions . 
  i have n't touched homeoterm in forever , myself . 
  [ ignitepoint ] is still definitely in the raws , though . 
  so you could possibly lower the point of spontaneous combustion to body temperature . 
  i 'm fairly certain omsk is clay that sun refuse to touch . 
  are you sure about how graze and crits work ? 
  unless i 'm mistaken , a successful dodge reduces incoming damage by half . 
  i 'm pretty sure i 've seen my rangers ' shotgun hits do more damage than one-half of a maximum non-critical damage roll to codexes that dodged the hit into a graze . 
  yeh . 
  the weakspots problem is just unavoidable , the longer a tank is in the game . 
  still , the tiger p does have 200mm on lower ** and ** upper glacis plates , which is unusual among german heavies . 
  it 's not uncommon for moderately experienced players to go `` ok , german heavy , go for lower plate '' if they 're on low enough health to start panicking . 
   26 % of estonian population is russian, 
   ethnic russians responsible for ~ 50 % of crime in estonia, 
  take of that what you will . 
  suggestion to the friendship mechanic : a new , massive debuff would lead to the same `` defeat snowball '' issue as animosity debuffs . 
  instead , how about a hero immediately gains 100 stress if a friend dies . 
  and possibly they gain a new negative `` friend lost '' trait after the mission .
