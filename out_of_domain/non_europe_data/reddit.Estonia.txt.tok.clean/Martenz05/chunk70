  * competent agencies must identify the individual . 
  * the refugee must formally request international protection and fill the required paperwork . 
  * the fingerprints of refugees must be taken and transferred to a unified system . 
  * primary background check should be carried out in the country of initial arrival . 
  the host country of relucation should be able to carry out secondary background check . 
  * a medical examination of the refugee must be carried out and documented . 
  a number of suggestions to streamline the process were made by pevkur , such as barring people who have not presented asylum request documentation from being assigned to the refugee relocation program and not permitting refugees to roam free while they are awaiting to be relocated . 
  in short , they 're demanding the hotspots of refugee arrival like italy and greece actually follow the directives agreed to for the refugee relocation program . 
  there 's a very important catch when it comes to refugees . 
  if they 're applying for asylum , then the country trying to identify them is n't allowed to ask for information directly from the government the refugee is fleeing from . 
  which does make sense , if the refugee is genuinely fleeing from government persecution . 
  would n't want to tell the country that `` oh , we 've got your political dissident over here , come and assassinate them when we are n't looking '' . 
  western europe : `` the muslim world is war-torn and unsafe because the browns are fighting each other all the time ? 
  let 's bring them all over here , where they 're safe from reality !, 
  oh , they 've started fighting each other and us over here ? 
  let 's send them to some east european backwater that nobody cares about ! '', 
  there are slow and inefficient ways of reliably corroborating information without requesting any from the government of the refugee 's origin , but they 're never going to work on the scale needed to verify all the refugees ' identity . 
  basically , it would mean risking the life of a european by sending them into a warzone to question the relatives of the refugee ; without syria knowing why they 're there . 
  the liver is what turns alcohol into the chemicals that actually make the body drunk . 
  as processing alcohol damages the liver , the liver gets slower and less efficient at turning alcohol into those chemicals fast enough for the body to get drunk . 
  there are also other factors at work , that do n't directly involve the liver , such as the body building up a resistance against those alcohol-derived chemicals that intoxicate the body . 
  surprisingly , / r/communism only has 15k , same as this place . 
  you do need some form of photo id to vote in estonia , though , even if you 're not voting online . 
  mostly as a countermeasure to voting fraud : ca n't have people voting multiple times , or voting on behalf of other people . 
  i 'll have you know i stopped at ac1 . 
  ooh look !, 
  there 's a new heroes of might and magic out !, 
  started with homm 2 . 
  3 with the expansions was amazing too . 
  ubisoft 's 6 and 7 are at least an improvement over 4 and 5 . 
  with series as long-running as homm , you just have to take off the nostalgia glasses and evaluate the new games on their own merits , instead of comparing them to the older ones all the time . 
  looks amazing . 
  the only thing that irks me from a security perspective is that the `` wrong '' buttons very obviously do n't do anything . 
  what i 'd recommend is adding some dummy logic gates that react to all buttons , but do n't actually lead to the door . 
  either that or just hiding the logic box entirely . 
  ... hmm . 
  and now that i 've seen this , i just had a good idea for a secret door in a glitch castle . 
  you came to the series at a bad time , then . 
  4 was a dramatic step down from 3 . 
  it ultimately came down to the devs trying to mix things up and keep the series `` fresh '' , but `` fixing things that were n't broken '' was the best way to describe the result , compared to 3 . 
  but i do agree that 5 is a nice step up from 4 , and probably only second to 3 in terms of gameplay . 
  also in the current system : if you 're rich enough and the theft is big enough , you do n't go to prison either . 
  have them commit some public crime against the regime . 
  something that gets them marked as `` shoot on sight '' by the military . 
  from your limited description , i 'd say perhaps planting a bomb in a temple dedicated to the new god . 
  or perhaps desecrating the altar or something . 
  it 's less confusing than seeing 0-1 at the top with five tanks dead . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ arty ^ ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ ^ both ^ ^ ^ ^ teams ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ tk-d , ^ ^ ^ ^ then ^ ^ ^ ^ one ^ ^ ^ ^ team ^ ^ ^ ^ killed ^ ^ ^ ^ an ^ ^ ^ ^ enemy ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ other ^ ^ ^ ^ killed ^ ^ ^ ^ two ^ ^ ^ ^ enemies . 
  a power plant burning coal for 20 000 electric cars is , at worst , exactly as dirty as 20 000 cars burning fuel individually , possibly cleaner depending on the technology used in the plant . 
  problem with making them separate is that then it would be possible to get both . 
  getting strong and fit on the same character would be very much overpowered , i think . 
  as in , potentially immortal overpowered . 
  true enough . 
  there are two ways in code to do it . 
  the easy way is to make the traits `` opposites '' of each other , like proud/humble are . 
  which in this case would mean congenital strong gets replaced if you get fit . 
  but since adding `` fit '' as a non-congenital `` strong '' would mean going over existing events anyway , it 's not so difficult to be diligent and add a condition that prevents events grating `` fit '' from firing if the character already has strong . 
  which is exactly why she has the courage to talk about something as reasonable as this . 
  thankfully , the o-i exp has that massive gun depression problem on its ' sides . 
  it literally ca n't shoot tanks that are side-hugging it . 
  iq tests are not really the best measure here , because the scale changes ( and is intended to change ) all the time . 
  100 iq is supposed to be the average in any given year , and in any part of the world with a functioning education system , people do get smarter as generations pass . 
  if your parents tested at 120 when they were still in school , they 'd probably test at below 100 if they took the tests again today . 
   ca n't see any credible poll or statistics suggesting the majority of them agree with this guy . 
  even if the people that agree with yosef are n't `` the majority '' , their group is still large and influential enough that the leaders of israel feel they need the approval of that single rabbi to do things . 
  that in itself speaks more of the power of the ultra-orthodox jews than any statistics . 
  if they were really `` insignificant '' as you claim , then why would netanyahu bother with asking for yosef 's approval ? 
  i 'd say a baron or equivalent at most . 
  possibly even a wealthy burgeoise , with no true title of nobility . 
  any higher than that , and their noble rank would see the troubles of the estate noticed and intervened in by higher authorities . 
  is that abom build viable at champion level and/or the dd , by any chance ? 
  the problem with using the `` opposite '' mechanic , is that a new trait always overrides the existing one . 
  gaining congenital traits like strong or genius does n't make much sense , but neither does losing them . 
  especially not seeing them replaced with something non-congenital . 
  you 're mistaken . 
  a proper neckbeard does require considerable trimming and maintenance . 
  it is not merely the length , but also the thickness that determines the beard 's power . 
  i have yet to commit to any specific editor . 
  currently i 'm using netbeans ide for the sake of being consistent with the rest of the project team i 'm working with . 
  edit : though i do know that i despise vi and its ' derivatives . 
  there is n't much you can do to guarantee your vassals will like you heir from the start . 
  you could grant your heir a landed title and hope that they actually cultivate positive relations with other fellow vassals , but that 's always a gamble . 
  it 's nigh-impossible to be universally beloved since the latest patch , and it 's definitely not worth the effort to try if it does n't happen by accident . 
  if you need the vassals to like you because of council approval and such , then use the favor system to force them to vote for your decisions despite their dislike of you . 
  if it 's about levy contribution , then just pick one or two of the weaker vassals in your realm and look for ways to make them like you ; which will most likely revoking titles from strong vassals and granting them to weaker ones . 
  i 'm not quite sure what you 're talking about with claims remaining within the demesne . 
  the only way to preserve a fabricated claim through succession , is to declare war over it before you die . 
  if you 're talking about something else , then it depends on your succession law . 
  what 's your succession law , in that case ? 
  if it 's gavelkind , then the only thing you can do besides changing succession law , is to try and make sure you only have a single son when the succession happens . 
  there 's quite a bit they can do . 
  most importantly , cancel other trade agreements that benefit you more than them . 
  and probably impose sanctions as well . 
  out of curiosity , was that normal sub-zero or fahrenheit sub-zero ? 
  i hear you . 
  it was those fucking blue decks that made it impossible to do anything on your own turn that made me swear off the game just after the innistrad release . 
  someone checked the stats of that thing in tes5edit a long while back . 
  the giant slaughterfish have a perk that grants all of them ... something like +100000000 % unarmed damage . 
  it could even oneshot alduin if it had the opportunity . 
  celsius , naturally .
