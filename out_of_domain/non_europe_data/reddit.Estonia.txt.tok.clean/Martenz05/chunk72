   after the german revolution , between 11 and 14 november 1918 the representatives of germany formally handed over political power in estonia to the national government . 
  the russian bolshevik invasion and the estonian war of independence followed . 
  on 2 february 1920 , the peace treaty of tartu was signed by the republic of estonia and bolshevist russia . 
  the republic of estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the league of nations in 1921 . 
  - [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estonian_declaration_of_independence ) ^ ^ [ 1 ], 
  the racism toward black us troops is nothing more than allegation at this point . 
  the soldiers allegedly taunted refused to make any formal statements to spark an investigation , when offered the opportunity by estonian liaison officers . 
  and it would not surprise me at all , if the racist remarks were coming from our local russian fifth column . 
  more importantly , they do n't sell the rights because they do n't want to risk the show being successful somewhere else , competing with their own schedule . 
   the assault marine got onehit by a killer kan because he had no respect for any enemy left at that point . 
  sounds like he was getting into character rather well . 
  as far as hordes go , i 've discovered that there can be quite a bit of tactical variety . 
  for instance , a single 120 mag horde is typically easier to deal with than two 60 mag hordes . 
  to get a better grip on the mechanics and encounter balance , you might want to `` simulate '' encounters on your own , without the players present . 
  run the math on how much damage and how many attacks the party needs to make to kill the enemy force in a basic slugging match . 
  do a `` good roll '' scenario ( players roll 7s on all damage rolls ) and a `` bad roll '' scenario ( players roll 3s on all damage rolls ) and see where that gets you . 
  it was in the treaty of tartu between estonia and the soviet russia that soviet russia renounced all its ' territorial claims against estonia and recognized estonia as a sovereign entity . 
  the incorporation of estonia into the ussr in 1940 was illegal to begin with . 
  whether the dissolution of the ussr was legal is not relevant as far as the legitimacy of estonian independence is concerned . 
   this will occur at the time when russia regains the power equal to the ussr . 
  haha , that 's a fine joke . 
  what little wealth exists in the russian economy is mostly based on resource export . 
  when oil becomes obsolete as a resource , russia is headed for north korea levels of poverty and starvation . 
  if it does n't collapse into outright civil war , then it 'll also reach north korea levels of totalitarianism and international isolation . 
  russian strength has always been based on its ' military . 
  except for tanks and a brief period during the space race , ussr was constantly lagging behind western technology in the cold war , both military and civilian . 
  russian exports were pieces of junk that nobody other than its ' satellite states were willing to buy . 
  if the west started a new technological arms race now , then russia wo n't be able to keep up the technological arms race . 
  either it gives up and surrenders all pretense of technological parity , or it goes bankrupt trying to keep up and still loses technological parity . 
  last time this happened was in the 80s , and the ussr collapsed . 
  when russia collapses again , the dissolution of the ussr is going to be completely irrelevant as a legitimacy argument . 
  no need for concern . 
  this is why our fascist mods and the jlp exist . 
  in the same list was `` free camera '' . 
  de is going to create another shiny , bug-ridden gimmick that gets abandoned two months after release . 
  her agenda is that the choice of who to let in ( and whether to let in anyone at all ) should belong to the uk , and not eu bureaucrats . 
  it 's unlikely that it was mistaken for an incoming rock . 
  a huge and obvious aspect of space rocks is that their acceleraion , deceleration and any change direction is strictly and predictably dictated by forces of gravity ( or collision ) . 
  any object in space changing speed or course on its ' own must be a ship of some kind . 
  i 'm fairly certain there 's implied manglement nepotism included in this series . 
  kase probably has n't done this because he knows someone `` important '' is going to take ice 's side in any complaint , regardless of the growing mountain of evidence . 
  or just parts of it are impossible to make out because of blood stains . 
  and yet evidence that police acquire from an illegal warrant is admissible , as long as the cops believe their warrant was valid . 
  so basically , the hope is that by arresting people for making videos the cops waste the courts ' time enough to piss off the judges so that they start putting their foot down on other cop behaviors as well ? 
  i hope you 're posting from mobile . 
  otherwise the sloppy spelling is inexcusable . 
  you 're not a kid playing cod , where every microsecond is precious when typing . 
  it 's particularly important to spell correctly when discussing any serious issue . 
  if you do n't have the time to write out full words and spell them correctly , then why are you wasting your oh-so-precious time on reddit at all ? 
  why should anyone take your rushed posts seriously ? 
  gavelkind , like all other aspects of pagan culture , are only sustained by conquest .

  ftfy . 
  this is why europe 's right is having so much trouble pushing back . 
  everyone expects someone else to do the hard work . 
   and the vk b may be replaced , but right now it 's very much worth the grind . 
  i had not heard about this , and it breaks my heart to find out about it . 
  the vk b and e 75 are the only german heavies that are stronger than average for their tier , and they 're removing one of them ? 
  let 's hope we get something that 's equally good , and not a complete turd like what happened at the lower tiers , when they added the dw2 as a mandatory step in the panther line . 
  i 've tried that . 
  i still get focused to death while i wait for the aim to settle . 
  or i do n't wait to aim and consistently miss the weakspots , if there even is one to aim for . 
  edit : a word, 
  so basically there 's nothing i can do to in the tiger ii to change the outcome of a match ? 
  either i vulture some damage from the better tanks if the team is winning anway , or helplessly melt with the rest of my team ? 
  success in the tiger ii depends entirely on the team not melting and it is n't capable of making a difference if the team does start melting ? 
  this is neither balanced gameplay or historical accuracy . 
  no premium account . 
  not going to have one , either . 
  as i noted in the op , i have all modules unlocked , no e75 unlock . 
  commander has sixth sense . 
  rammer is equipped . 
  angling the tank only lasts for the first few shots , until the team melts and the mediums surround me . 
  basically , tl ; dr : `` you 're an idiot for wanting to play german tanks . 
  gib money to wg to make the experience less unbearable . '', 
  i swear to god they 've purposely turned the german tech tree into a giant , sick joke . 
  fuckers have successfully driven me to the point or rage that i 'd kill them if i ran into them on the street . 
  venting and ranting aside . 
  thanks for the good advice . 
  playing it as a second line brawler does seem to be getting better , more consistent results . 
  though i 'm still getting murdered as soon as the front line dies . 
  i 'm not asking for an auto-win machine . 
  i 'm asking for a machine that is n't just a fat damage-pinata for other equal-or-higher tier enemies tanks to slap around . 
  when i ask `` how to be profitable in tiger ii '' , i do n't want the answer to be `` play other tanks to make up the loss '' . 
  that is horrible game design on wg 's part . 
  fine , i get it . 
  they 're a company and need to make money , so they want people to buy premium tanks and account time . 
  i get that us penniless scrubs who ca n't afford gold are just there so the premium players have someone to play against . 
  the problem with tanks as terrible as the tiger ii ( or for a more extreme example , the dw2 ) , is that when i get silver loss game after game , i fully realize i 'm just there for no other reason than to be slapped around and it makes me want to quit the game in disgust . 
  and for the record , at no point was i saying i want historical accuracy . 
  i want wg to stop the bullshit excuses and constantly switching between `` game balance '' and `` historically accurate '' when they justify why some tanks are garbage while others are blatantly overpowered for their tier . 
  i have watched all the tutorials already , regarding sidescraping and such . 
  and i do try to put into practice . 
  i do cover up my lower plate whenever possible . 
  and when i back up to get a shot off , i get penned through the lower plate or the gun mantlet by a borsig on the other side of the map . 
  as far as sidescraping goes , i do try to make use of it , but i ca n't figure out what i 'm doing wrong , even after watching tutorials and such . 
  sure , i can ricochet hits reliably , but the second i poke out to take a shot , i still get blasted in the turret front or upper plate by the invisible tds behind the heavies . 
  the problem i always have with sniping in t10 matches , is that the tiger ii is neither stealthy nor fast enough to get around the flank for side shots , and ineffectually shooting at the front of t9 and t10 heavies and hull-down mediums is just as expensive as paying repair costs for brawling . 
   perhaps watch some replays from wot replays to see the tiger 2 played well . 
  unfortunately , i 'm having trouble finding any that are n't so old as to be irrelevant because of updates .
