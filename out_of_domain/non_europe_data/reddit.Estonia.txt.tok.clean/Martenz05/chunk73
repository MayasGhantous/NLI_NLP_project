  say hello to big-ass mosquitoes and malaria . 
  if putin or any other russian leader had the power to do so , they 'd force us to replace our kids with russians . 
  they might be more patient and more civilized about the process of replacing other cultures , religions and ethnicities , but the end goal is the same . 
  russia is already a graveyard of indigenuous east european and uralic cultures , and they want to extend that graveyard further west . 
  replays without commentary are not really much good , if i 'm not even sure what i ought to be paying attention to . 
  a replay can only tell you so much without commentary . 
  i mean , sure , if i knew the player i 'm looking at was taking calculated risks and analyzing the situation well , i could probably take a thing or two away from the replay . 
  but even i have had one or two great games in the tiger ii , stomping through on blind luck and a derpy enemy team . 
  still , thanks for the suggestion . 
  it had not even occurred to me to watch replays outside youtubers . 
  napalm is not something you make . 
  you pump it out of the bowels of the earth . 
  also , `` napalm '' is a funny name for magma . 
  not just more lenient , there 's also the favor system you can use to force a marriage . 
  fake video . 
  the audio is from a smaller protest . 
  idea might be to human-wave the border and hope some soldiers get through ? 
  the favor system was added by the conclave patch . 
  there 's a `` buy favor '' diplomatic interaction that 's like sending a gift , except instead of an opinion boost , you get a favor on the target of the gift . 
  the game keeps track of these favors and you can spend them to make ai do stuff they would normally refuse , like force them to accept marriage proposals . 
  there are also events that grant favors , though i think most of them are restricted to characters in your own realm/court . 
  you seem to have missed the point . 
  a single densely populated city of 1 mil . 
  people contributes less to the causes of climate change than ten sparse cities of 100 thousand people . 
   user = = moron, 
  a single equals sign means defining ` user = moron ' , which is probably redundant , since ` moron ' is the assigned default for the ` user ' variable anyway . 
  is it weird that i instantly recognized this is the deluge map ? 
  probably shelling the `` exploding '' mountain in the right side of the picture . 
  nope . 
  op said the * colonel * was hassling him the entire time . 
  it 's something that happens to tenno that stand still while spamming their gun . 
  a good approach in theory , but it would mean multiplying the amount of work that a lab needs to do by at least a factor of 10 . 
  [ relevant xkcd ] ( https://xkcd.com/683/ ) explains the nature of forensic testing pretty well . 
  and these are labs that are already backlogged with criminal evidence to the point that occasionally cases get dismissed because prosecution ca n't just postpone the trial forever waiting for evidence to come out of the lab . 
  as far as i can see , the best way for japan to create a `` righteous '' proxy war is to arm a resistance against zorzal 's tyranny . 
  and arming them with modern weapons is entirely unreasonable for japan . 
  the resistance milita would not need advanced weapons like rpgs , machineguns or even modern assault rifles . 
  even bolt-action or semi-automatic rifles would be a great boon . 
  avoiding long term problems is not as complicated as it might seem . 
  just bribe the leaders of the resistance with high-ranking positions in the future collaboration government , and they 'll keep the grunts of the resistance in line , even if they do n't fully understand the moral and cultural reasons behind the japanese `` human rights '' demands .

  dark heresy is inquisition , deathwatch is space marines , black crusade is chaos and only war is imperial guard . 
  they are all slightly different variations of the same core system , each with some unique quirks of their own . 
  the different rulesets can be mixed , but it 's generally not a good idea to do so . 
  the power levels between the different settings are too incompatible , for one . 
  there are also some rules that differ and conflict between rulesets ( most notably , psychic powers ) . 
  which books you 'll need depends entirely on the game you 're getting into . 
  it 's a question better directed specifically at your gm , rather than an open discussion like this . 
  or if you 're interested in being gm , i recommend starting with dark heresy . 
  dh is the `` baseline '' to which the other 40krpg systems are generally compared to . 
  it 's not about a menial/repetitive job being challenging enough to be interesting . 
  it 's more about being challenging enough that you do n't start feeling the job is completely beneath you . 
  no need to be completely content . 
  just not discontent enough you 're willing to go through the whole gauntlet of looking for a better job .

   secularism is a government direction , not one of the people of the country, 
  the problem here is , a government is , ideally , supposed to be an extension of the will of the people . 
  what you 're suggesting , is that the government should just push for a western ( and liberal ) idea of `` progress '' , dictating to the people what their opinion ought to be . 
  disconnects between the beliefs of the government and the beliefs of its ' people are what breeds extremism and revolutions . 
  resistance to the political left 's idea of progress is building up in europe , and you 're suggesting the same kind of ideological steamrolling ought to be done in far more conservative countries like bangladesh ? 
  the basic solution to this issue is actually quite simple . 
  instead of focusing on `` elves ** do not die ** of old age '' , focus on `` elves do not die ** of old age ** '' . 
  elven populations can still be ravaged by war and disease . 
  while nobility and royalty can escape war and disease better than common folk , they are proportionally more likely to be assassinated by their peers . 
  after all , an elven heir would have long decades , perhaps a century or more , to grow jealous of their parent 's crown . 
  to quote myself from the other thread :, 
   the basic solution to this issue is actually quite simple . 
  instead of focusing on `` elves do not die of old age '' , focus on `` elves do not die of old age '' . 
   elven populations can still be ravaged by war and disease . 
  while nobility and royalty can escape war and disease better than common folk , they are proportionally more likely to be assassinated by their peers . 
  after all , an elven heir would have long decades , perhaps a century or more , to grow jealous of their parent 's crown . 
  to elaborate , just because age categories define elves as long-lived , does not mean it 's common for them to live that long . 
  my take on this is that elves who live to be a 1000 years old are exceedingly rare . 
  many of the stereotypically ` elven ' personality traits ( aloofness etc. ), 
  are nothing more than coping mechanisms for dealing with the inevitable sense of grief and loss that comes with having close friends among shorter-lived races . 
  as far as training and `` levels '' go , it 's easy to forget that player characters are supposed to be exceptional individuals . 
  people who are motivated enough to keep training and refining their abilities and constantly seek out greater challenges . 
  unlike dragons , who grow more powerful purely by growing older , an elf 's power level is not strictly linked to their age . 
  having centuries to learn something does not necessarily mean an elf is better at something than any other intelligent simply by virtue of having had more time to practice . 
  at most , it might mean an elf has learned a wider variety of skills during their life than a human . 
  there are still physical limits to a person 's ability . 
  suppose an elven warrior has reached a point of skill where he 's good enough to beat everyone he knows . 
  the first of his options is to become complacent and only keeps up enough training to maintain his level of skill . 
  a second option is to go out to explore the world and seek out greater challenges , which in the average dnd setting is quite likely to get him killed . 
  finally , his third option is to decide he could use some variety in life and start the road to mastering a new skill , letting his warrior talents slowly fade away due to lack of practice . 
  though the system itself does not model it beyond age category penalties , skill atrophy is still very much something that realistically ought to happen . 
  he 's not going to prison ( a state/federal establishment ) , he 's going to jail ( operated by the county sheriff ), 
  clarification needed : how many dice are in the block rolled and are the regular 6-sided dice ? 
  exactly . 
  the consequences are big enough that cf should create a failsafe for that situation . 
  as a developer , you 'll always want to remove known possibilities of code going into undefined behavior . 
  most likely , they 'll make an unloaded cell count as `` not enclosed '', 
  perhaps racism should be something that varies heavily from locale to locale ? 
  in a larger town , a party with a half-breed in it is noticed and remembered as unusual , but nothing more than a wary attitude from the innkeeper or the guards comes of it . 
  a different town might completely deny entry to the party on account of having a half-breed in it . 
  to be fair , the baltics were already shackled to the euro well before they adopted it . 
  they could not have devalue their currency even if they had wanted to . 
  which was a more or less a necessity to gain the international market 's trust and break their economies ' dependence on russia .
