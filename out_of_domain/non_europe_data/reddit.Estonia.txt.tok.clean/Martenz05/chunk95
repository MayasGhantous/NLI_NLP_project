  yes , exactly this . 
  rondel actually is inside the territory the jsdf claims as a buffer zone around the gate . 
  mostly because the author messed up the scale and claimed far more territory than the jsdf could reasonably police . 
  a circle with 200km radius is a lot of territory . 
  i 'd probably be trying to figure out if humans from earth are capable of learning magic , and then learn some myself . 
  or if it turns out us earthlings ca n't use magic , i 'd start organizing an anti-slaver militia . 
  which would probably end up as an oligarchic republic with myself and my locally recruited militia veterans in charge . 
  because let 's face it , the culturally medieval masses in the sr just would n't be able to handle democratic responsibility . 
  they 'd just end up voting to sign away their freedom to a tyrant that promises them safety from bandits , dragons and imperials . 
  so what 's the alternative ? 
  sending in riflemen to be ambushed by enemies hiding inside those clay houses ?

  eh , who cares . 
  unless you did n't bring a comprot specialist . 
  nah , more like a crazed fanboy got served . 
  the donald ca n't be stumped so easily . 
  honestly , i 'd say do n't worry about that . 
  some of the shit the comes out of the mouths of our own veteran politicians makes us embarrassed about being estonians . 
  demented and horrible politicians seem to be everywhere . 
  considering how cartoonishly corrupt hillary is , with that growing list of people who have suddenly died in car accidents and muggings just before they were about to testify against the clintons in court , i ca n't imagine trump being any worse than her . 
  a lot of the `` trump is a backwards racist '' imagery has actually turned out to be nothing but media bluster , paid for by the clinton campaign . 
  what have the swiss got to do with this ? 
  or do you mean second to be shut down by swedes ? 
  because threatening to not protect nato members sends the wrong message to the enemies of nato . 
  it undermines the deterrence value of the alliance . 
  it 's not . 
  the bbc was unabashedly pro-remain and had no problem giving remain propaganda a much louder voice . 
  nothing permanent will come of this . 
  it 's just a show for us plebs . 
  they 're hoping if they take a few token actions , we 'll just settle down a bit and wo n't care enough to go into the streets when they quietly resume their migrant imports . 
  for true hardmode elder kings , try that one independent county in valenwood that has ayleid culture . 
  restore ayleid rule over cyrodiil . 
  personally , i 'm of the opinion that the system is rigged because bernie won the primary in a landslide in the one state where the voting machines were not being provided by a private contractor . 
  and because [ two out of three ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfn2-uv-zui&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=58s&amp;user=redactedtonight ) of the companies providing voting machines have made large donations to the clinton campaign . 
  not really . 
  the scorpion is a much taller vehicle , meaning it 'll have worse camo . 
  you do need some kind of initial investment to get a business started . 
  however , the requirement of 2500 $ initial capital is quite flexible in estonia . 
  the tax authority is only going to demand to see the 2500 $ transferred to the company bank account in two circumstances : a ) you want to pay out dividends or b ) the company is going bankrupt and its ' assets are being demanded to pay off outstanding debts . 
  a llc in estonia can theoretically operate indefinitely , without ever having the initial investment capital paid in . 
   but if i missed the bus , at least i there 's a safe road to walk it . 
  buses in estonia travel frequently enough that it 's usually faster and more convenient to wait for the next bus , than to travel the distance on foot . 
  yes , locating your own tax residence to estonia would pretty much require estonian citizenship , and estonia does not permit double citizenship for its ' own citizens due to the national security risks it would cause considering the russian minority in estonia . 
  definitely not worth it . 
  but registering your company in estonia is quite simple if you choose to become an e-resident . 
  ah , and one important thing to note : the tax office wo n't let you pay out dividends from your profit until you pay the initial 2500 $ *** up front *** . 
  getting the 2500 $ out of company profit requires you to pay it to yourself as salary . 
  and salary costs for the company have a significantly higher tax burden than a dividend payout would . 
  so yeah , there is a bureaucratic cost involved , if you hold off on paying the initial capital . 
  human vs ai co-op , maybe ? 
  correct , you 'll be fine as long as you have the 2500 $ somewhere . 
  the scenario you just described is the ideal one . 
  no , the base capital ca n't be taken out without closing the company . 
  by definition , a company is n't supposed to have assets if it does n't have capital . 
  if this is n't the case in your accounting , then something has gone horribly wrong in there ; and it 's very likely the tax office will see such a state of things as an accounting fraud . 
  this is the case in pretty much any country , not just estonia . 
  eh , all i know about tax residency ( not physical residency ) is that it has a lot of asterisks everywhere . 
  even if it 's just between eu countries . 
  you 'd be better off consulting an actual lawyer for that stuff , rather than just a guy that took a semester 's worth of courses for small business management in estonia . 
  it 's probably best to rent a car . 
  public transportation outside the major population centers is mainly geared toward locals who need to travel between towns for work . 
  it 's not really aimed at being convenient for tourists who want to visit the landmarks . 
  visiting viljandi might be worth it , if you have the spare time in your itinerary . 
  if your schedule for the trip is already full enough , then it 's probably best to skip it . 
  there are plenty of noteworthy sites in and around p\u00e4rnu . 
  the base rules are largely compatible . 
  stats like wounds , and the skill lists are pretty similar . 
  iirc , the only part that is n't at all compatible between the different rulebooks of 40krpg is psychic powers . 
  dark heresy , rogue trader and deathwatch all have their own psyker powers that can not be joined together . 
  still , it is entirely possible to run an all-guardsman party in dark heresy . 
  the problem is , only war has a lot of useful mechanics for setting up a larger military unit that the player characters are part of . 
  as well as better rules for mass combat . 
  and only war 's progression paths are generally better optimized for soldiers , military officers etc. 
  the progression paths of dh characters are distinctly pushing characters toward being smarter and more inquisitive than ordinary grunts . 
  hell , i 've had mp going out-of-sync well before 1940 rolls around . 
  lots of players probably completed the interesting parts before they got a legal copy of the game . 
  hence why they have so few of the achievements recorded by steam . 
  what debates ? 
  i 'm ... 80 % confident hillary will attempt to become the first president who never debated their opponent during their entire campaign . 
  the main advantage of taking the baltics is making sure that germany * does n't * take them . 
  taking the baltics makes it much easier for germany to seize leningrad , and encircle any soviet troops stationed in eastern poland . 
  then again , the hoi4 ai is still a complete derp at critical things like division design and producing all the equipment its ' divisions need . 
  i do n't see how you could possibly lose to it , even if germany did get the baltics . 
  because hillary can just bribe the msm to ignore trump 's complaints ? 
  then again , i 'm actually rooting for this . 
  it 's going to be an absolute landslide for trump if hillary flat out refuses to debate her opponent . 
  i recall bernie offering to debate trump at one point , but it was n't so much backing out on his part , as it was complying with the various debate restrictions placed on him ( and all other candidates of the republican primary ) . 
  that was a clever move on bernie 's part , actually . 
  he had to have known that trump could n't accept a debate without breaking agreements with the rnc . 
  if trump had been bold enough to call the bluff , bernie would have had to back down himself . 
  however trump was in a somewhat precarious position in the primary , so he did n't risk calling the bluff and potentially giving the panicking nevertrump republican establishment an opportunity to kick him out of the race prematurely . 
  you certainly should . 
  lots of interesting stuff has been added , if the last time you played was before the antiquarian update . 
  the luxembourg wc depended on an exploit that gave any nation infinite manpower . 
  the exploit has since been patched .
