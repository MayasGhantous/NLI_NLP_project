  i much rather listen to sheever cast a game than annee . 
  edit : annee not annie . 
  fair point . 
  it 's mostly the diction annee uses and her voice that i find bothersome . 
  despite that she does in fact give a good commentary on what 's going on . 
  props to you , you made someones day better today . 
  sg is south-american not cis lol . 
  theeban and conrad went for sg . 
  so one vote for eg , two for sg . 
  yeah , my bad . 
  got them mixed up , 2nd game was all eg . 
  this needs a thread on its own so people stop bashing pgl for something they do n't even control . 
  kylo would do you good ; tanky , great damage and counter attack + heal immunity + dot, 
  lol ? 
  you do realize a big reason why sumail wins or comes out break-even in every mid matchup , is because his mechanical skills are unparalleled by ant other player . 
  compare the cs of midone , noone , sumail ( or sumail vs anyone ) etc when matching up against ana . 
  perhaps you should start working on your mechanical skills so you could climb out of the 1k trench . 
  psu and cpu is understandable , i considered the said options myself as well . 
  why the drop to 8gb of ram though ? 
  no i 'll take your word for it , i had no problems with memory on my last computer with 8gb ram . 
  does this look fine ?

  if you keep them hydrated and the temperatures right , it actually is n't that problematic . 
  it comes down to husbandry more than the subrate itself actually . 
  that being said , tiles and the like are much more forgiving . 
  king arthur : legend of the sword up my ass, 
  which is not a good bedding for bearded dragons btw . 
  the safest route is tiles . 
  they 're practical and you can find really good looking ones . 
  i was on tiles until today , i switched up to this :, 
  50 % sand and 50 % topsoil . 
  and i only put half of the cage since it has its specific areas for doing business - you dont want the soil to be dirty . 
  if you use a loose subtrate : make sure they 're mature beardies , they are well hydrated and well-fed ( otherwise you might end up with a trip to the vet . ), 
  this is just one example of it being under the `` avoid '' label . 
  if you google around a bit , it is common for vets to disapprove of these beddings . 
  the reason why wood shavings , walnut shells etc are bad is manifold . 
  1 ) they do not digest, 
  2 ) they have sharp edges  can cause internal damage . 
  3 ) due to their size they can easily cause impact, 
  of course , it depends on the bearded dragon and owner - you might be fine with it and have no problems . 
  but the person who recommended it is spreading a false understanding . 
  you comment contributes nothing to what i asked what so ever . 
  the 2015 macbook pro can run the game at high with ~ 60 fps . 
  the macbook pro 2016 is much more powerful . 
  alright , didnt know that , thank you for clarifying your comment . 
  thank you !, 
  these helped a lot , including what you posted , now i have my settings on high and average around 55-60 fps . 
  i put hand/face lotion , it burned like a motherfucker . 
  i believe i did n't even take it off , it was before heading to sleep, 
  wrong subreddit . 
  try r/jailbreak, 
  anyone know where to get those pants he 's wearing ? 
  woah , i had no idea this brand existed . 
  i love it , thanks !, 
  i checked your list and downloaded more than 10 the apps you use . 
  i also started journaling thanks to finding out about day one . 
  i ca n't thank you enough . 
  when did you buy the mac ? 
  i had the same issue with my mb pro 2016 two weeks after buying it , apparently there were some manufacturing issues or the like with the butterfly keyboards . 
  try contacting apple , i got a new mac in 16 hours after calling them . 
  i used my mbp 's siri , and i do n't think it 'll ever end ... 
  it has been at least 5 minutes by now, 
  the vegans that i know have the constant need to lecture me or others as to why they eat what they eat and how we should change as well . 
  i do n't need this - i know fairly well what the conditions are that the animals live in , but i still choose to eat meat . 
  vegans constantly bugging me about eating meat is the last thing that will change me . 
  they should mind their own business unless a person expresses interest . 
  my girl of 5 months recieved a text about 3 weeks ago from her abusive ( physical and psychological abuse ) ex from a few years back , wanting to meet up . 
  they were supposed to meet just because he `` wanted to talk '' , however , at the ex 's home . 
  i found it both irrational and stupid that she would go , yet she insisted that she was just curious and said this is a one-time thing . 
  so they met , and talked , nothing happened . 
  we move on with our lives . 
  a few days back he texted again , saying he still had some of her stuff from during their relationship ( her favourite shirt , a hoodie and a book ) . 
  alright , i was expecting him to find a reason to meet-up again and as with last time , she decided to go . 
  today she went to his place to retrieve her stuff - was supposed to take a minute to get her stuff and leave , right ? 
  they had a heated arguement and he started pulling her towards him and trying to make her take her clothes off . 
  she struggled herself out of his grip and was about to leave - then he threw her book into the fireplace before she could take it and said she should have a drink , that she was always `` nicer when drunk '' . 
  he also called her a worthless slut etc at some point when the argument began . 
  i found this out after telling her several times i want to know what happened ( considering she stayed 2 hours instead of the expected few minutes ) , at first she was negligent , but eventually said everything because she wanted me to know . 
  my first reaction was to tell her i never want to hear her stepping foot in this guys house again and she agreed , yet also noted that she cant be 100 % sure she will not be afraid to say `` no '' to him . 
  i still feel the need to get advice as to how to handle this situation . 
  wrote this on phone , overlook the typos please . 
  edit : they were together for a year and a half , most of that time he put her through terror and fear - leaving her too scared to cut ties with him . 
  tldr : girlfriend 's abusive ex wants to meet up and use her for his sexual needs , knowing she is afraid of him to this day . 
  edit : i must 've put `` how '' in the title subconsciously , it 's excessive . 
  lately i have been completely and utterly confused , often times when my gf and i make a plan she bails out and does n't let me know anything until it 's way due time to tell me whether we are going to do something or not . 
  we 've been together for around 5 months and this has happened a few times every month . 
  sometimes less , sometimes more .
