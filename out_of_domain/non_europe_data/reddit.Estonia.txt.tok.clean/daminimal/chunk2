  same design on the notice , but green background for the `` yes '' and red for `` no '' with a white font color could help . 
  otherwise a colored border could work as well , but make sure to create a padding between them if this is the route you take . 
  otherwise i quite like the site . 
   the colors do grow on me when browsing the page prolonged and it 's easy to get attached to them , but it 's the first impression that 's a bit off - at least for me . 
  maybe the landing page should thus be focused on with a critical eye by an outsider - who does n't feel too attached to the design . 
  that 's my 2c , i hope that 's any help . 
  fruit loops .

  i think the istick + nautilus mini should be sold in a single package for new people ( such as me ) as it is so highly recommended starter in this sub .

  i live in denmark at the moment and i think that the `` jante law '' is the most horrible thing ever imagined - especially for school children . 
  i am glad we do n't have this back home , but i do wish people were a bit less arrogant sometimes . 
  the jante law '' ... negatively portrays and criticises individual success and achievement as unworthy and inappropriate . '', 
  how is this good ? 
  i feel that this unwritten law is everything that stands against progress and also against gifted and successful individuals sharing their experiences . 
  we are not all the same and should never act like it . 
  a gifted child should be helped further along because of the possibilities - not kept back to keep away ` abnormalities ' . 
  got my first ever setup going today .

  merry christmas to you too !,

  i 'm actually having some 12mg juices in my nautilus mini . 
  i started with two bottles of 18mg , but it seemed a lot . 
  12mg seems to hit the mark for me . 
  these two are delicious , still . 
  i think my fianc\u00e9e will be using this one more than me though , as i also have an istick . 
  thank you !, 
  not danish , but estonian . 
  studying in denmark though . 
  great idea !, 
  hope this takes off . 
  for daily usage it 's difficult for me at the moment though because i need a working lastpass plugin . 
  just tried [ \u00b5block ] ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%c2%b5block/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en ) today and it 's great . 
  uses far less memory than the competition as well . 
  i did n't realise it was n't english . 
  i will edit my post as well . 
  but why if ublock is a more lean version of the same thing ? 
  coming from a 4gb ram laptop owner tho . 
  [ i think , ] ( http://i.giphy.com/kn1uarsyagouc.gif ) if it takes 200mb less of ram it 's great . 
  it also uses lots of less cpu cycles . 
  even adblock plus is a lot faster than adblock . 
  look at their charts on the [ github page ] ( https://github.com/gorhill/ublock ),
