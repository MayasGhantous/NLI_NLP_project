  i had cpu bottleneck even with my i7-4770k until i turned off hyperthreading . 
  at what clock are you running it ? 
  i would n't say my new i7-4770k is much faster than my old i7-920 was . 
  tho i must say i got lucky with 920 and unlucky with 4770k - both can clock to 4ghz max . 
  before ( 331.65 ) & after ( 331.82 ) - both about 95 fps , did not observe any significant change . 
  gtx 570 in sli , i7-4770k , 16gbram ,, 
  test range , 1080p , ultra . 
  got unlucky with it , cant overclock past 4.1 ghz . 
  otherwise does not feel like big upgrade from i7-920 . 
  nothing like going to ssd or ips screen felt like . 
  wow . 
  it 'll be money well spent , 
  incorrect . 
  the special relativity replaces newtonian mechanics as more general case . 
  technically f = m_0 a. 
  the actual mass depends on speed because as you accelerate you increase the kinetic energy and e = mc ^ 2 -  m = e/c ^ 2 . 
  edit : do n't know how to make subscript 0 . 
  the time goes imaginary , not negative , when ftl . 
  i see chickens under the tree . 
  apparently it 's postponed . 
  i got a pro grade ibm laptop at 2001 that had wifi in it and did cost $ 4000 . 
  sure it had workstation cpu and a discrete gpu inside , but at that time the wifi was the feature to have . 
  before i discovered the quick save function i went to mun , collected samples and came back to kerbin only to over decelerate during last 100m of decent . 
  lost my shutes and crashed hard . 
  also rage quit . 
  this made me search for save function . 
  just rocking those stairs . 
  ssd & ips monitor were the biggest jumps for me . 
  ssd made everything feel snappier and ips monitor made everything pretty .

  nice screen . 
  colors are vibrant , but somewhat inaccurate . 
  no dead pixels . 
  10/10 would buy . 
  good old ben , 
  directx is a low level api too , it was initially conceived as direct to the metal api that bypasses all the software abstraction layers in windows . 
  it 's just too old , the hardware it abstracts is not there any more . 
  sure it has been updated over the years , but it 's time to move on to different model . 
   0.05 % of all people on earth played dota2 last month . 
  insane . 
  this number ca n't be right . 
  but ... space ship two does not reach orbit . 
  * 3 ukrainians and one estonian, 
  i 'm from estonia and went to time warner cable page just out of curiosity . 
  did n't think the plans are that bad . 
  here are the web pages of our two largest isps : [ elion ] ( https://www.elion.ee/eraklient/internet/interneti-pusiuhendus ) and [ starman ] ( http://www.starman.ee ) , just as a reference . 
  in urban areas we get 100/100 connection from elion for 24 $ and 200/20 connection from starman for 25 $ . 
  we 're not even at the head of the pack in our region , our neighbours have faster connections available . 
  i 'm pretty sure that re ( s * h * i * t ) = 0, 
  edit : [ wolfram alpha confirms it ] ( http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=re%28s+h+i+t%29&amp;x=-733&amp;y=-72 ), 
  edit2 : [ your referenced equation is still imaginary ] ( http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt%28-s+h+i+t%29%5e2&amp;x=-732&amp;y=-71 ), 
  got very similar build , same cpu , gpu , 16gb ram , asus mobo , etc. 
  it only takes a 1440p monitor to push it to the max . 
  you 'll have to disable the hyperthreading for bf4 . 
  i broke my g700 mouse , but i prefer g500 anyways . 
  i too read the 20000 lieus book too before google . 
  i figured they must look like submarines . 
  do n't use it in workstation tho . 
  it 's good for compute , but it still runs standard geforce drivers . 
  the geforce drivers artificially limit performance in some workstation applications like solidworks . 
  i for one support this approach if it allows them to bring the cost down . 
  i have my high end pc that i keep up to date , but other computers in my apartment ( ipad , macbook , smart tv , smartphone , dslr , router , console , etc , etc ) are not upgradeable and i 'm perfectly happy with that . 
  that alienware box will last for couple of years at least and by then we 'll have game stream tech readily available . 
  that 's one out of ten billion games . 
  current match counter ( match id ) is at about half a billion . 
  or did you imply one out of ten billion people ? 
  do you include dead people ? 
  you 're not even trying . 
  however , what i 'm saying is that if you have 4 bad players and 1 good one playing carry , and the other team has 4 bad players and a good one playing support , the first team will ( generally ) win , simply because a carry is a lot more influential in that scenario . 
  that implies both the good carry and good support are in mmr hell . 
  and even then it will be just one data point . 
  an experienced support in low mmr game will end up carrying the game anyways . 
  touch\u00e9, 
   although , i could see additional design costs involved to remove the standard `` plug and play '' aspect of pcs ( at least in the first iterations ) . 
  i do n't think they 'll build them like pcs from off the shelf components . 
  they 'll probably build them like laptops and solder everything onto the motherboard . 
  what are you using it for ? 
  different apps have different requirements . 
  we actually tested a few high end geforce gpus and low end quadro gpus in our office . 
  quadro won as far as solidworks goes . 
  they started doing it a while back . 
  at the beginning you could just flash firmware to upgrade a [ geforce card into quadro ] ( http://www.techarp.com/showarticle.aspx?artno=539&amp;pgno=9 ), 
  edit : fresher charts . 
  quadro k5000 and gtx 680 share the same gpu . 
  notice the difference ? 
   do you have a source for this ? 
  see those charts ( there are more in the article ) . 
  quadro k5000 and gtx680 use same gpu , but k5000 is much much faster . 
  he might want to wait a bit . 
  i got the same gpu and at this moment everything runs well and the gpu is surprisingly quiet . 
  overclocking will add noise without much benefit . 
  the premiere relies on compute so for you the titan should be the best . 
  gpu is definitely overkill for 1080p , you 'll be better off if you buy something half as expensive and upgrade after 3 years . 
   i hardly consider 15 % not much benefit . 
  he 's got 60hz monitor and the gtx780ti can already do 60fps . 
  at this point of time the extra performance is useless . 
  better wait until there 's real need for it . 
  you 'll need to call nvidia rep.
