  have the same problem when looking for pants . 
  wtf is mscd ? 
  [ tobi and puppey cocasting a navi game ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2ddsarc4gm ), 
  i take it as a honest question and try aswering it . 
  you ca n't game on a mac . 
  as simple as that . 
  it 's not why macs are bought , there 's pc for that . 
  computer today is an appliance , you just wo n't wash your clothes in a dishwasher . 
  instead the macs are bought for things that you often cant see in the pc specs such as build quality , rigidity of the body , used materials , battery life , keyboard backlight , etc. 
  those items were n't in the specs before apple started emphasizing them . 
  it does all the other things beside gaming well enough so specs is n't primary concern for most mac buyers . 
  hackintosh ca n't provide those . 
  you build hackintosh for os x. 
  for me the tiger is comparable to windows 7 and it was released in 2005 . 
  today the win 7 is good enough so there are n't any good reasons for hackintosh . 
  maybe pixelmator . 
  the bigger the fan the better . 
  extra points for open case . 
  you are only ruining the game for yourself . 
  none will beat a custom desktop . 
  laptops are power limited , if you put desktop parts in them they 'll melt . 
  wrong . 
  the keyword is `` gaming '' . 
  770 is a good and efficient gpu , but it still draws 230w of power at stock speeds . 
  the minimum recommended system power for it is 600w . 
  could n't find the power draw for an alienware laptop , but the biggest power supply for them is 330w . 
  they are more power efficient because they are slower . 
  the power draw is roughly proportional to second power of frequency . 
  here 's a list of various 3dmarks . 
  the highest mobile gpu is at 23 . pos . 
  it 's the way it should be , but it actually is n't . 
  there 's [ this influential work ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_structure_of_scientific_revolutions ) in philosophy of science by kuhn that states :, 
  `` a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light , but rather because its opponents eventually die , and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it . '', 
  i think the original author of the sentence is [ max planck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paradigm_shift ) . 
  have an open mind too , 
  all right . 
  you found a `` laptop '' that can beat 760 . 
  with all the respect tho - for the price of $ 2500 you can buy both a sleek laptop and a top-of-the-line desktop . 
  the thing is so compromised it beats the point of having a gaming laptop . 
  i mean [ just look at it ] ( http://www.notebookcheck.net/review-alienware-m18x-r2-notebook.77048.0.html ) , the vents alone are bigger than my work laptop . 
  this subreddit is all about common sense , and alienware is not . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  you 're using 3g stick . 
  no wonder . 
  amd integrated the memory controller into cpu - it gave a significant performance advantage . 
  intel only integrated the memory controller in nehalem processors and they were way faster than core duo ones . 
  an i7-920 cpu is still relevant today . 
  arma series and watch dogs are poorly written . 
  use bf3 , it is free on origin right now . 
  it 's one of the best optimized modern games , you should use it as a benchmark . 
   doing the same thing over and over , and expecting different results , is stupid . 
  bit off topic , but it 's the definition of insanity . 
  einstein said it before lorenz discovered with chaos theory tho . 
  i 'm from estonia and it 's not common for someone at his age to speak russian . 
  i can speak both russian and english but for me it is difficult to process the bilingual input at teamfights . 
  no he 's not . 
  rip, 
  post it to [ r/powerwashingporn ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/powerwashingporn ), 
   even on lowest settings i have a hard time keeping stable 60fps in the city . 
  and it doesnt look so different ( low vs ultra high ) . 
  guess that explains the high minimum requirements . 
  it seems cpu bottlenecked though . 
  judging by the recommended system requirements - yes . 
  i hope it will be addressed in later patches/driver updates though . 
  nvidia gamestream allows streaming with minimal cpu/gpu overhead . 
  the copyregion ( ) function is terrible - it checks bounds for each pixel inside the double for loop . 
  the bounds check is also done inside setpixel ( ) and getpixel ( ) functions . 
  at least you could do the bounds adjustment before loop and adjust the loop from/to values accordingly and then use direct memory access without any extra bounds check . 
  it would be even faster if you could copy a whole row of pixels with a single buffer.blockcopy ( ) command . 
  you underestimate the importance of team secret for starladder organisation . 
  at this point they are probably willing to throw whole ruleset out of the window to get team secret into kiev . 
  they will be losing a lot of viewers because of secret forfeiting . 
  of all the people that ever lived about 20 % is now alive . 
  the population growth has been explosive since ~ 1900 . 
  `` looks like i must return :d '', 
  he did say that `` it looks like i must return '' after the games . 
  kalevipoeg ( literally son of kalev ) is the [ estonian epic story ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalevipoeg ) . 
  the text on the wallet is `` kalevipoeg at the gates of hell '' . 
  he mixes information and data . 
  there 's a lot of data but little information . 
  besides . 
  we created all this stuff before digital age - we just did n't record it . 
  the path planning is quite processor intensive operation and has to be done every time someone clicks somewhere . 
  i guess it 's done on server and limits the amount of instances one server can run . 
  it would make financial sense to add ad hoc optimizations to reduce server load but the drawback is predictability . 
  they probably did n't bother earlier but now they want to reduce load on servers . 
  not that big of a deal . 
  small nuclear weapons contain only a few kg of nuclear fuel - in comparison the chernobyl reactor had 180 tons of it . 
  the first 40 bytes of the bitmap is the [ bitmap info header ] ( https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd183376%28v=vs.85%29.aspx ) followed by uncompressed pixel data . 
  if you choose the color channel values from ascii table and delete the header it 's possible . 
  if you want challenge tho , use [ whitespace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whitespace_%28programming_language%29 ) or [ brainfuck ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brainfuck ) programming languages . 
  you ca n't distribute a virus as * . bmp - for it to work it needs to be executed . 
  viruses are normal programs with malign intent . 
  you sound funny , 
  the device only needs a public key for encrypting the messages . 
  the private key is only needed for decryption . 
  how does it look like in text editor when a cat walks over your keyboard ? 
  just wondering . . 
  jumping into water is normally forbidden as you can easily get lost under ice . 
  how would you deal with parties with some high level players and some low ?
