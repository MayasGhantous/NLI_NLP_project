  there are different levels of `` production '' though . 
  for company-internal tools or brand new projects with no users yet , having a few hours or days of downtime is no big issue . 
  and if you plan on upgrading soon for sure , then it might make sense to do it right away , since there will be much less time for it once the app gets popular . 
  just as a note , interpol is not a police agency , and does n't have jurisdiction . 
  it 's more of a shared database of arrest warrants and other communication tools to help national police agencies to talk to each other . 
  i 'll bet you one month of reddit gold on that it 's not mct/bfr/raptor or mars related . 
  edit : if you 'd like to take on the bet , please confirm before the actual announcement is published , 
   why those libraries have n't being ported in 6 years ? 
  the vast majority of them have been ported : https://python3wos.appspot.com/, 
  there 's no reason to start a new project in python 2 today . 
  for existing projects however , many people do n't see enough of benefit to upgrade . 
  docking with a rotating thing is possible * only * if the docking port is precisely aligned with the center of mass of it . 
  then you can in theory spin your ship at the same rate , and still stay stable relative to it . 
  but if the docking port is not aligned , then it wobbles around , not just rotates . 
  there is no way to stay stable relative to it at all . 
  uncheck this here ? 
  edit : ah no , i have n't upgraded to 1.0 yet , maybe it 's different there . 
  thanks , this fixed it !, 
  so was there any announcement at all ? 
  or did it turn out to be a fake twitter account ? 
  so as i understand , they build engines in california , ship them to mcgregor , texas for individual testing , ship them back , assemble the stage from it , ship it to mcgregor again for 9-engine testing , and then ship it to the launch site . 
  why would they keep the test site so far away from their main factories and engineering in hawthorne ? 
  aha , sad to hear :(, 
  should we call it a draw then ? 
  for a single rocket no , but there 's more than one rocket . 
  * on average * all similar rockets will behave in similar ways . 
  after a number of first and reused flights , you can calculate the probability of `` will this flight succeed , assuming that previous flights of the same core did '' based on the data from all previous flights ever made on any core . 
  the first launch might have a medium risk , because there 's a good chance that some manufacturing mistakes were n't noticed in testing . 
  the second or third flight might be the least risky , since a few successful flights is great testing . 
  and after that , the risk might go up again due to increased chances of components wearing out . 
  no , specific impulse is a measure of fuel type + engine efficiency . 
  the other factor you need to consider is empty ship mass to fuel mass ratio . 
  if the specific impulse is lower , then you need a larger proportion of your spaceship to be fuel . 
  30000 km/s is an insane speed though , 10 % of the speed of light , which is completely infeasible with today 's technology . 
  for comparison , most rockets have a delta-v of 10 km/s , and the saturn v with all the moon landing stages had a total delta-v of about 17 km/s . 
  this means that `` starting from standstill in space '' and going in one direction , the entire saturn v could accelerate the final tiny return capsule to 17 km/s , with everything else discarded on the way . 
  i sort of disagree . 
  sure , i 've seen a few startups which resulted in co-founder arguments and legal issues because these were n't properly organized from the start . 
  but i 've seen way more `` neat idea '' projects that fizzled out and were abandoned after a little bit of work and never became a proper startup . 
  it would have been a waste of time and money to hire lawyers , accountants , and organize everything from the start from those . 
  i thought that was automatic if the airbag deploys ? 
  do you know how does the french duty to assist laws handle cases where the assistance would harm ( and in case the trolley problem , kill ) bystanders who were not in danger before the assistance ? 
   i 'm a little confused about what an llc will offer me , aside from legal protection ( from what , though ? ), 
  but that is a * very * important benefit . 
  the llc `` protection '' means that if you are sued and end up owing someone money , then they can take it only from the assets of the llc . 
  if you do business as an individual , then they could take it from your personal assets ( house , cars , wage garnishment ) . 
  note however that a single-owner llc is not a perfect protection . 
  if a court decides that you acted maliciously on purpose , knowingly sold dangerous items , or something similar , it could still order you to pay the costs out of your personal assets . 
  but it 's still certainly worth it . 
  there may also be tax advantages . 
  an accountant familiar with the laws in your state would be able to advise on those . 
  here is a map of the international ferries : http://www.balticferries.nl/images/routes/route_all.jpg, 
  there are no connections from riga to tallinn or helsinki , because to land route is * much * faster ( 5 hour drive instead of 24 + hours for a boat ) . 
  there are also three small connections not shown on the map : between estonian mainland and the two small islands on the west coast ( saaremaa and hiiumaa ) . 
  these are about 30-90 minute trips on tiny ferries . 
  in february the sea will be frozen over , and you can also drive to the small islands over ice roads : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9450807.stm, 
  this also means that most likely any pleasure cruises in small yachts will not be possible , since only the main routes have icebreakers and ships capable of breaking ice themselves . 
  so unfortunately your best bet remains a day trip tallinn-helsinki-tallinn ( about 2-3 hours each way ) , or two overnight cruises to stockholm and back . 
  i do n't get why they would want to use a cryptocurrency and a blockchain at all . 
  unless you want to make sure that no central authority can undo or prevent transactions , a simple database on reddit servers would be better in every possible way . 
  reddit gold , and in-game currencies in every game already work fine without any crypto behind it . 
  take $ 5m of your investors money to distribute magic tokens to random anonymous users of an free ( and almost advertising-free ) website . 
  i 'm really wondering what step 2 is . 
   from 01.01.2011 a private limited company can be established without contributing the share capital if the proposed area of activity does not require capital investments . 
  the share capital of such a company will be formed by the liabilities of the founders amounting to the sum they promised to provide as share capital contribution . 
  to explain this a bit more : the share capital ( and therefore the cash or other assets that the company has ) must always be at least 2500 eur . 
  but it 's possible to avoid paying that into your company 's bank accounts initially . 
  instead , you `` promise '' that if the company goes bankrupt and ends up owing more money than it has in assets , then you will cover up to 2500 eur from your personal assets . 
  note that you can take money out of the company as dividend ( most tax efficient ) only after making the share capital payment into your company 's bank account .

   spread marbles all over the floor . 
  op has cats . 
  when i gave my cat one marble , she loudly rolled it around the house for an entire night . 
  multiple cats and a bag of marbles ? 
  i 'd rather try to sleep between an airport and a construction site . 
  yes , you will need a business bank account in an estonian bank for it , at least for holding that share capital . 
  to open an account , you will need to visit the bank in person with an id card or passport ( the anti-money-laundering rules require that the bank identifies people in person ) . 
  it should be possible to hire a sort of lawyer ( `` notar '' ) to do it for you , if travelling to estonia is annoying , but i 'm not sure how that works . 
  after that , you can do everything on it online . 
  i think after that you can also have another account for the company elsewhere in europe . 
  but if you already have an id card , using that estonian account remotely might be a good option - the online banking systems here are * much * better than what i saw in the uk for example . 
  generally no , the application would not be illegal . 
  the application is just another original work made by you . 
  but the copyright of the resulting png files would still be owned by the game 's authors . 
  however , it 's a bit more complicated if the proprietary file format is designed to be a copy-protection measure itself ( it 's encrypted , scrambled , etc not just undocumented ) , and your application is designed to break that copy-protection measure . 
  in this case , the [ application may be illegal ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-circumvention ) , but someone more familiar with the laws could explain more . 
  the approach you mention is pretty popular with emulators & updates to classic games : scummvm , older versions of openttd , etc. 
  these either patch or replace the game executables , but require the user to copy the graphics and other content files from `` their own legal copy of the original game '' . 
  i have n't heard of a case of the developers getting into trouble over this - but these are games that have been out of print for 10 + years , and the publisher most likely does n't care any more . 
   it does n't feel like a soothe progression , but rather a struggle to survive to start , then it just gets easy . 
  that sounds similar to every tycoon and sim-building game . 
  the problem is that any economic difficulty adjustments either make the game impossible ( no way to make a profit ) or trivial once you have plenty of spare cash .

  and the biggest/oldest one started at the same time in early 1900 's as the soviet communist party , is currently in greek and eu parliament : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communist_party_of_greece,
