  which area of lasnam\u00e4e did you grow up in ? 
  i grew up in a few places there as well , and the dodginess seemed to differ based on the area . 
  the older sikupilli and pae neighbourhoods seemed to be worst - there i 've seen someone lying in a pool of blood , people getting beat up in bus stops , and of course the [ pae street bomber ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bomb_man_of_pae_street ) . 
  the newer neighbourhoods near katleri and loopealse have always seemed to be safer , with more young families around . 
   this is sort of cheating , in that your pre-agreed parity scheme for the board counts as information . 
  sure , but you need previous agreement for any sort of meaningful communication . 
  you need to agree on how physical signals represent bits , how data is split into frames or packets or streams , what it is supposed to represent , any compression algorithms and so on . 
  agreeing on an error-correction scheme is n't any more cheating than agreeing that it 's ascii text . 
  ^ ( per user , per year ), 
  how about extending the bet again ? 
  until it eventually launches ? 
  check this http://vm.ee/en/taxonomy/term/41 out instead . 
  looks like you can stay in estonia without a visa for 90 days out of every 180 days . 
  wave height proportional to the ships : http://imgur.com/a/57xp6, 
  but it 's probably not that steep , not sure how far apart the waves are . 
  how do they manage to zoom in and keep it in view from hundreds of kilometers away ? 
  trademarks are for branding and copyrights for artistic works . 
  you have to register for a trademark , but copyrights are automatic . 
  if this text is long and `` artistic '' enough , it * may * be covered by copyright , but if it 's a slogan or tagline , most likely you want a trademark . 
  it depends on the contract . 
  the contract for a site that display 's other people 's media would include either a * license * to copy and show it , or a transfer of copyright ownership . 
  if it 's just a license for the work , then the author retains the copyright and can go after any unauthorised copies themselves . 
  if it 's an ownership transfer , then the site would own it , and only they can ( but are not required to ) go after uploaders . 
  the easiest way to do this is to send a [ dmca takedown notice ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/online_copyright_infringement_liability_limitation_act#notice_from_copyright_owner ) to the site hosting the uploaded copy . 
  unless the uploader objects , they will just delete it . 
  but note that if the goal is avoiding people finding out about the videos , rather than making more money from live shows , then this line of work might be a bad choice . 
  it 's almost impossible to permanently delete something from the internet , since it anyone could re-upload it under new anonymous user accounts at any time , and legal attempts to delete material could end up [ drawing more public attention ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/streisand_effect ) to it . 
    one of the reasons is she believes the country looks down upon those who left during the war . 
   that is definitely not the case . 
  if anything , people ( including older generation ) feel sympathy for those who got in the way of war and had to leave/escape . 
  i think people felt mildly annoyed in early 1990 's at estonians who had been living abroad for 50 years and came back right after re-independence to `` teach us how to run a country '' . 
  but no hard feelings at all towards people who just left or returned , and certainly not these days . 
  i agree that op and his grandma should come and visit if at all possible !, 
  in the unlikely case that you end up discussing the history with someone , they will most likely be interested in hearing more about the life in new zealand than why and how they left . 
  there are plenty of dirt roads in small villages , connecting houses in the forests and fields that are many km away from `` proper roads '' . 
  i think the main question is why google bothered with mapping all these on streetview ? 
   i still find this hard to read , and it only works from working backwards - ie , it launches , and you look back to see where you were before . 
  but how do you look at the probability of a launch on a given attempt ? 
  say launch attempt # 1 last sunday . 
  based on history , how can you look at these charts and find the probability of going to space today ? 
  is n't that exactly what these graphs show ? 
  for example , let 's say that spacex announces that they will launch in 10 days . 
  you find `` l-10 '' on the bottom graph , and see that there is about 10 % chance that the launch will actually happen in 10 days . 
  you then find `` l-10 '' on the top graph , and see that the median expected delay is about 12 days . 
  so you can predict that the actual median expected launch date might be 22 days away from today . 
  for the `` probability of going to space today '' , you would look at `` l-1 '' , `` propellants loaded '' and `` terminal count '' columns depending on how far along it is today . 
  now you are right that this merges together all attempts for a mission . 
  `` two days before announced launch '' probability will be different depending on whether it 's the first or a repeated attempt . 
  but on average it should still show `` probability of going to space in x days '' for all possible x. 
   but that does n't mean we should make it a criminal act just because it 's extremely embarassing . 
  but why not ? 
  it clearly harms another person and most people strongly disapprove of it . 
  and it 's not like someone 's actually useful rights or freedoms are being restricted - if you want to publish nudes of your ex , just get a written permission from them , and everything is fine . 
   leave and stay in a hotel . 
  and check if you can rent out your own apartment on airbnb . 
  might even make a profit . 
  looks like it 's a sticker on a coin , not actually defacing the coin itself . 
  so the law might not apply . 
  why bother with a short helicopter hop over a dangerous section when you can take one to the very top ? 
  it would be amusingly trollish to land there in a hawaiian shirt and flip-flops , take a selfie , and fly back while the mountaineers watch in anger . 
  what counts as possession ? 
  being the driver ? 
  to get started , have a look at the `` visiting estonia '' section here : http://vm.ee/en/taxonomy/term/41, 
  in countries with no estonian embassy , another eu country 's embassy should offer information and process visas . 
  in pakistan , it 's hungary : http://vm.ee/en/news/pakistan-islamabad, 
  the visa is for the whole schengen area in eu , so it also does n't matter that much which country you apply to . 
   the higher thrust engines should mean that it takes about 200 m/s less delta v to reach orbit , primarily because the f9 will spend less time fighting gravity . 
  while that 's useful , would n't the main benefit of 20 % more thrust be the ability to add 20 % more fuel ? 
  either by stretching the tanks again or chilling the fuel to be denser . 
   would that violate instagram 's tos ? 
  yes , if you scrape the web site . 
  but they have an official api for developers , including [ searching latest media by tag ] ( https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/tags/ ) . 
   would that violate ip of users ? 
  * probably * not . 
  users posting pictures to instagram give instagram a license to display and distribute their content , and instagram can give sub-licenses to others . 
  but it 's difficult to say whether the having an official api implies a license from instagram to display the pictures or not . 
  based on https://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/ it seems that it 's okay as long as you show up to 30 photos at a time , do n't store copies on your servers for too long , and quickly remove images that users mark private . 
  there is no centralised government database for applying to or searching for internships . 
  applying for an internship is much like applying for a job ( just perhaps easier ) - find some companies you are interested in , find out if they offer internships and get in contact with someone there , and convince them to hire you . 
  i know internships in software engineering tend to be paid , and in humanities tend to be unpaid , but not sure about things like marketing or economics . 
  edit : some online job search sites like [ cv.ee ] ( http://www.cv.ee/job-ads/internship ) and cvkeskus.ee might have internship offers as well . 
  i do n't think this would be helpful . 
  as i said , it 's much like applying for jobs - browse cv.ee and cvkeskus.ee ( both have english versions ) , find companies that seem interesting , and email each one to ask . 
  having someone else asking this or applying for you immediately raises the question `` why does n't the candidate do this themselves ? '', 
  and most likely would not be successful . 
   hydrazine is actually an example of a combustionless rocket fuel , it spontaneously breaks down into other chemicals , releasing energy in the process . 
  what keeps it from breaking down while just stored in the fuel tanks of the rocket or storage tanks on the ground ? 
  `` scum '' is way too harsh . 
  this attitude is only directed at people who moved here permanently from russia during the soviet era , never bothered to learn estonian over the last 30-50 years , and still demand to get all their government and business services in russian . 
  there are no hard feelings towards other foreigners not speaking estonian . 
  but generally estonians will get * very * excited and happy if you speak even 10 words or so !, 
  there are a lot of masters courses taught entirely in english :, 
  * http://www.ut.ee/en/masters-degree-programmes-taught-english, 
  the number of batchelor 's programs in english is a lot smaller . 
  but even in batchelor 's cs and it , many higher-level courses are taught in english only . 
   what degree is most useful to get a job in estonia ? 
  - i 'm assuming it or computer science , and would choose it out of the two . 
  are there more in-demand degrees or skilled trades ? 
  you are right that cs and it are the most in-demand in estonia , and many software companies have international employees so the working language at the office is also english . 
  for the choice * between * cs and it , i would recommend cs if you are interested in programming and software development .
