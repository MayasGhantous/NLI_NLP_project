  they tend to be one-off about whatever interesting question comes to mind . 
  for example , i wanted to see the gps speed distribution in steps of 10km/h :, 
  select ( speed / 2.8 ) : : int as spd , count ( * ) from parsedcache_gpsfix group by spd order by spd desc ;, 
  or find the number of cell tower ids in my dataset :, 
  select count ( distinct ( ( data -  ` cid ' ) : : int , ( data -  ` lac ' ) : : int ) ) from parsedcache_event where tag = ` device.cell.location ' and data -  ` type ' = ` gsm ' ;, 
  are there any obvious oversights that i 've missed ? 
  or perhaps some interesting ideas to try ? 
  i 've thought of getting rid of the hstore in favour of jsonb , that should help at least with queries that cast hstore contents to numbers . 
  i think he means that living costs in argentina are low , so charging even half of typical us contractor rates is a great income . 
  and local clients from argentina do n't want to pay even 50 % of us rates .

   cutting a security tag off of a jacket is not legal advice . 
  it 's / u/shittylegaladvice, 
  why not ? 
  op already tried going back to the store to have it removed , and they refused . 
  so his only remaining options are to sue the store , throw the jacket away , or remove it himself at home . 
  and it ca n't be good practical legal advice to go to court over something you can legally fix in a few minutes yourself . 
  why not just tell * us * about yourself and post your questions here ? 
  you will get many more useful responses that way . 
  most people wo n't bother to start writing about themselves to you first , nor bother arranging a time to chat on facebook . 
  and as a plus , responses here can be read by anyone else interested in ut . 
   please note that if the page takes more than 5 seconds to `` calculate '' the result , the weather api is likely not responding and i am not to blame . 
  just try refreshing the page . 
  why do you need a weather api ? 
  you could just output `` no '' all the time , and be correct 97 % of the time . 
  good luck with your research .

  looking up the current registered owner 's information is 1 eur per plot . 
  but if you do n't know the exact location or address , it might be more difficult to track down the farm . 
  perhaps if the current owner is a government entity , it * might * still be possible to claim it ? 
  but if it has already been privatised to someone ( perhaps one of your relatives if your father or you never claimed it ) , then probably not ? 
  in any case , it could would be worth hiring a local lawyer to help , even if it 's just to find out more about your family history and roots . 
  as you can see , the privatisation/restitution was a very controversial topic . 
  my grandfather got back his childhood home that his father had built with his own hands , so i 'm clearly positive about it . 
  but when houses and land were returned to their original owners or relatives after the end of the occupation , there were people who had been living there rent-free for decades - in our case immigrant workers from the rest of the soviet union , were often given `` first pick '' of houses in favour of locals and previous owners . 
  these tenants suddenly found themselves having to move out or start paying commercial rent , in houses that they had gotten used to . 
  but since during soviet times it was all nationalised to * government * ownership , the tenants never owned these in the first place . 
  klick is a terrible computer shop , i try to avoid it at all if possible . 
  it 's okay if you want to save 5 % , but if you ever need to deal with their warranty returns , it 's not worth it . 
  i could perhaps agree that it might not be * necessary * , but why would it be * inappropriate * or `` not the right place '' to have it ? 
  it 's a service that could be useful to plenty of freelancers , startup founders , and other people working in technology . 
  it seems to me that `` not the right place '' still implies that there is something shameful about mental health , and it should be hidden from `` professional '' settings . 
  as a comparison , what about a small business tax advice booth ? 
  i could see that being useful to plenty of independent developers as well . 
  but i do n't think it would raise a similar controversy , people would just think `` oh nice '' , and ignore the booth if they are not an independent developer with tax questions . 
  there are * some * companies who only patent things defensively .

  kalev spa in the city centre has the biggest pool : 50 meters and 8 lanes . 
  lots of schools and sports clubs have 25 meter pools , i like the one in audentes fitness . 
  school pools , if they sell tickets to outsiders , should be cheaper but perhaps less modern than sports clubs . 
  the prices might have changed , but there are pictures and addresses . 
   nowhere to put a flag, 
  [ sure there is . 
  something like this ? 
  i guess it can be useful if you want to out-hipster the hipsters with common and boring macbooks in kalamaja . 
  an irs employee on reddit also recommended the following in a similar situation : https://www.reddit.com/r/irs/comments/2ukq3p/dependent_already_claimed/co9i9md, 
  you can still claim the dependent if you file on paper . 
  the irs will then audit both returns where they were claimed . 
  the person who claimed them incorrectly will have to repay the deductions . 
  please do update us with the outcome of this new case !,

  mmm ... tasty cyan,

  you make it by distilling air , and that air might have floated in from anywhere in the world !, 
   invert your field relationship in your clustering index -- make it on ( time_gps , user_id ) . 
  note that i have `` where user_id = 123 '' in the query , i 'm only looking at one user 's data at a time . 
  so the index should still be fine ? 
   then the ` order by time_gps / 10000 ' should be able to make use of that index . 
  i tested on a small example table , and it seems that `` order by field / 10000 '' does not make use of an index on field , even if that 's the only thing in the index . 
  it seems that it treated as an opaque expression like any other function , and postgresql does not seem to figure out that `` field / 1000 '' and `` field '' sort orders are interchangeable . 
  a functional index probably would help , but i 'd like to keep the time step in the expression user-configurable . 
  you should get a good slow-motion camera and record a video . 
  sorry for the confusion - updated the post to fix these . 
  my table actually has a field called series_id . 
  i used it interchangeably with `` user_id '' in the post , because the fact that there are multiple series per user is unimportant , and users seemed more obvious in the explanation than series . 
  time_gps is a bigint , holding milliseconds since 1970 . 
  i guess i could convert it to a timestamp , but this is the original format that the gps chip provides . 
  the two indexes are :, 
  * `` parsedcache_gpsfix_series_id_a31c1ce9c62c8a5_uniq '' unique constraint , btree ( series_id , restart , counter ), 
  * `` parsedcache_gpsfix_series_id_21d61565965bdf1b '' btree ( series_id , time_gps ) cluster, 
   finally , what does ` explain analyze ' show for actual timings ? 
  uh , i feel really stupid now !, 
  turns out the actual queries themselves run in a few seconds when in explain analyze . 
  the rest of the slowness must be from the processing in the export script itself , so there is actually no need to optimize this in the sql level . 
  for example , when taking the series with the most ( 3.8 m ) rows :, 
  # explain analyze select distinct on ( time_gps ) * from parsedcache_gpsfix where series_id = 117 order by time_gps ;, 
  unique ( cost = 3026256.04 . .3044346.37 rows = 883995 width = 88 ) ( actual time = 3030.452 . .3862.309 rows = 3480338 loops = 1 ), 
  -  sort ( cost = 3026256.04 . .3035301.20 rows = 3618066 width = 88 ) ( actual time = 3030.451 . .3366.170 rows = 3481288 loops = 1 ), 
  sort key : time_gps, 
  sort method : external sort disk : 333384kb,
