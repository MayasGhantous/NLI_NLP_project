  it 's about 50 % more expensive than the acceptable but cheap ones the locals use , and 2x more expensive than uber . 
  but that 's still a lot cheaper than getting scammed for 50x the expected price by a shady `` cheap '' taxi driver . 
  note that there is also a tallinn * a * takso , not sure about them . 
  for ordering any of the usual taxi companies , as allu22 said the taxify app is pretty good . 
   hotel, 
  no idea , sorry , but avoid this one :, 
  that said , i do n't think there is an issue with untrustworthy hotels in tallinn like there is with taxis . 
  some might be better or worse than others , over - or underpriced than others , but i have n't heard of any being dangerous or scammy . 
   they have heavy quality control on their service . 
  uber is practically the opposite of this . 
  these rules seem to be similar to what uber drivers have told me about . 
  some sort of background check , 1-day course before starting , and the drivers are kicked out if their rating drops below 4.5 out of 5 . 
  i know `` anyone '' could be a driver there ... but so far my experience of about 50 trips has been super positive . 
  i used to take 2.5 start +0.5 / km taxis about once per day before ( reval , s\u00f5bra , marabu etc ) , and uber drivers are way nicer than the average of professional tallinn taxi drivers . 
  with taxis , i guess every third or fourth smelled horrible , half of them could not speak any estonian , and one even had the back seat full of random trash and kept looking at tv shows from his tablet while driving . 
  with uber every single one has been helpful and polite , some even offering free water , to use their phone chargers , to change the radio station , etc without asking . 
  i guess tallink has always also been okay , but since they are pretty pricey i only use them when i need to pre-book it in the middle of the night to go to the airport . 
  so yeah , despite the questionable tax dodges uber uses , i have become a big fan . 
  which is a good thing , really . 
  there are already two existing string formatting methods which can be used if the string is built dynamically , plus countless templating libraries . 
  since the f-strings can reference any variables that are in scope , nut just explicitly provided arguments , having f-strings composed of user input would be extremely insecure . 
  forcing them to be only literals in code gets rid of that security risk . 
   make the initial capital payment of 2500 $, 
  you do n't even need to pay in the initial 2500 $ any more . 
  instead , the founders can `` promise to pay the company 's debts up to 2500 $ when asked to '' . 
  however , until you 've actually invested this amount into the business , the company will show up with a special tag in the business registry , and these are generally seen as risky or untrustworthy . 
  office landlords , suppliers , etc will be much more suspicious and may ask for pre-payments . 
   are there any compelling reasons why i should switch, 
  i 'd say it 's the opposite : are there any compelling reasons to stay on 2 . x ? 
  basically all of the useful libraries have been ported , or have newer and better replacements : https://python3wos.appspot.com/, 
  if you are starting new projects or scripts , python3 is nicer in small details . 
  the improvements are n't enough to motivate a large existing project to switch to python3 , but there 's no point in starting new stuff in python2 . 
  maybe in addition to other methods , but it 's not going to be enough . 
  most good developers never * actively * look for a job in their life , and never think of `` going to see what 's on cvonline '' . 
  they take an internship or a part-time job from an university job fair while in college , and stay there after graduation . 
  and then switch jobs when a friend from another company convinces them to . 
  advertising at local tech meetups could work , as could http://careers.stackoverflow.com/ . 
  every visits stackoverflow a few times per day , and the right-hand sidebar is filled with job ads near you . 
  my understanding is that this is intended as a `` self-contained '' python version similar to python virtualenvs on unix , so that you can ship your python application + python + libraries as a single installer . 
  it * should * isolate your application from any other python versions that the user has installed , so that if the user runs `` pip install -- upgrade blahblah '' on their computer , your application does not break . 
  but there is no sandboxing for the application code . 
  the application can still run shutil.rmtree ( ` c :\\ ' ) and it will execute with the current user 's permissions . 
  it 's `` static linking '' , not vms or containers . 
  in fact , the @ operator was added just to make numpy code easier to read . 
  it will not yet be used anywhere in python 's own standard library .

  [ majaka p\u00f5igu baar ] ( https://goo.gl/maps/iuzkk ), 
  last time i was there on a pub crawl about 5 years ago . 
  the place looks like it has n't been renovated since 1970 , there were middle-aged drunks dancing at 2pm , pekiv\u00f5ileivad for 1 eek , and when you asked for `` a shot '' , you got 100g of vodka in a milk glass . 
   what would be the best way to approach this ? 
  you should either do it completely for free , or charge your full commercial rates . 
  good close friends and family might get free help , and will understand that they ca n't ask for too much of your time . 
  business contacts get business rates , and are happy to pay them if it 's valuable for their business . 
  but people in between , friends of friends and distant family ? 
  do not work with them at all , and especially do not give them a discounted price that is n't 0 . 
  they wo n't understand how high professional market rates are , and will think that they are `` overpaying '' even at a steep discount . 
  and then they will ask for endless changes and extras to make up for that `` overpaying '' , and you ca n't easily refuse because they * are * a * client * who is paying you . 
  the big problem with product hunt is that i 've never heard of anyone ever mentioning it outside of early-startup-discussion-boards . 
  if your target market is early-stage software startups , then great , but if it 's big enterprise companies , or banks , or hairdressers , or truck drivers , or whoever else , then its of no use . 
   product hunt is full of passionate early adopters, 
  that 's the idea ... but i 'm fairly sure 99 % of these passionate early adopters are also marketing people at startups trying to advertise on ph. 
  the only context i 've ever heard ph being mentioned is `` how to advertise on ph '' , and never `` i found this new cool thing on ph '' . 
  that might be because of the type of websites and subreddits i read , so i tried searching for `` product hunt '' on reddit and google . 
  there are three types of posts that show up :, 
  * ph people advertising their own site . 
  * people discussing how to advertise on ph. 
  * random results with the word `` hunt '' , like people discussing hunting products ( guns , ammo , vests , etc ) unrelated to the ph site . 
  i have not yet found any mentions of ph by early adopters who are just looking for new products and not also trying to advertise there themselves . 
  but perhaps that 's all okay if this audience overlaps enough with your target market . 
  no , i agree completely - if you have a something that appeals to marketing folks , or is general enough to appeal to `` absolutely everyone '' ( including marketing folks ) , then it can be great . 
  one of these bars , p\u00f5rgu , also has fantastic food . 
  i think he says that because most people only visit tallinn , and both tourists and people living in tallinn often forget that there is more to estonia than just tallinn . 
  but while that 's true , i disagree with the advice . 
  starting from tallinn is the most efficient choice for 95 % of tourists , especially if it 's your first visit to estonia . 
  there 's the largest number of `` cool things to see per day '' there . 
  if you are staying for 3 or more days and the weather is good , then consider also going to some marshlands , islands on the west coast , tartu , etc. 
  after you get bored of tallinn . 
  \u0ca0_\u0ca0 he 's asking about a * conversation * partner ... 
  i do n't think speaking estonian is at all * necessary * to make friends . 
  it just takes a bit of time for people here to get used to new people ( drinking together also helps ) . 
  for estonian tutors , i unfortunately do n't know anyone . 
  but if you do n't need a specialist and just someone to chat with and who 's willing to interrupt the conversation to offer advice , then perhaps try asking from local universities or student societies ? 
  there must be lots of students who would like a small side job . 
   i think you may be the first person ever to follow all of / r/legaladvice 's rules . 
  does he have renter 's insurance ? 
  still , even if you are a beginner at coding i would suggest looking for internship-type developer positions at local it companies . 
  these are almost always paid , the teams often include foreigners and therefore use english at work , and should be a lot easier to find than bartender/salesman jobs . 
  most software engineering students get a part-time job already in their first year of studies . 
  not sure if internship/beginner-type positions are posted online , but if you email local companies , i think about half of them will say `` welcome '' . 
  about the rental and utility prices - most students get together as a group of 2-3 and split rent on an apartment together . 
  that might be difficult to organise ahead of time from abroad , but once you have arrived might be a good option . 
   graduation is essential/prerequisite to find a job ? 
  not * necessary * in it . 
  but :, 
  * unless you already have work experience , having a degree or even currently being a student will help . 
  * at least some of your classes should actually be fun and educational !, 
  the university program will force you to learn about topics that most people do n't bother learning on the job ( maths , machine learning , compilers , basic electronics & circuit design , etc ) , and generally `` broaden your horizons '' more than just coding . 
  you can register a business online at https://ettevotjaportaal.rik.ee/index.py?chlang=eng, 
  it costs about 180 eur in fees . 
  the e-residency is not a requirement for it .
