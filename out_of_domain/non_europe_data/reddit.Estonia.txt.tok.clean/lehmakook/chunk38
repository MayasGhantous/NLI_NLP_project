  however , you need some form of digital identification to be able to manage your company paperwork online . 
  the e-residency is basically just an id card with encryption keys that enables you to do that . 
  if you already have a local id card from a few other european countries , then that might work as well . 
  note that to open a bank account for the business , you will need to travel here in person at least once . 
   uber intended for it to be a ride-sharing program, 
  eh , that 's creative lawyering by uber at best . 
  uberpop does n't show the driver the passenger 's destination until they are in the car and start the drive , and the driver never enters an intended journey . 
  it 's pretty hard to actually ride-share when neither of you know where the other one wants to go before booking . 
  yeah , all parts that are n't shadowed by the blast shield should be destroyed, 
   i do n't think you even can `` go back to school '' like that . 
  there are a couple of highschools for adults , with classes in the evenings . 
  * ask local mobile phone repair businesses . 
  they might be able fix and resell the broken ones , or use them for parts . 
  and their customers may be interested in buying used but working phones . 
  * most of these are pretty old , but some local hackerspace or university cs club might want one of each working one for a `` mobile apps testing lab '' . 
  every android phone is slightly different , and getting apps to run reliably on old phones is very tricky without having them at hand . 
  some guesses :, 
  * vc investors want to see a 20x or 100x return from their best investment , and are okay with all of the rest failing . 
  if a company just makes a small solid profit , that 's a failure for them . 
  so they push all of their companies to ignore small profitable directions and attempt `` world domination '' even if its a very risky bet . 
  * vc funded startups get a lot more publicity , especially if they fail after a large investment . 
  it could be that bootstrappers fail more often , but nobody notices . 
  * bootstrappers might seek vc funding only when they realise that their current business model is n't working well enough . 
   would n't any efforts we make just slowly diminish over time as double solar winds strip away the atmosphere ? 
  yes , but i 've seen the timeline for this loss of atmosphere quoted as 100 000 to 10 million years . 
  plenty of time to figure out new solutions . 
  most people here are against accepting refugees/migrants as well , i get it . 
  but try not to go full retard here ? 
  instead , the comment section on delfi.ee is perfect for going full retard . 
   typically , the ones who know best what tools they need are the craftsman themselves , and many good managers would listen to their programmers . 
  if $ 100 a year can make a single programmer waste 10 minutes less every day doing a particular task , it is already a profit for the business . 
  sure , in a small , < 10 developer shop that might work . 
  you find a good tool , put it on the company credit card , and perhaps even convince your teammates to use it . 
  but in company with hundreds or thousands of developers ? 
  each team might use their favourite tools ... until a high-level manager decides to standardise on something else for `` more synergy '' . 
  it will be extremely difficult to convince management make an exception for your team , let alone change the company-wide standard solution to your favourite tool . 
  and these enterprise licenses with thousands of seats are vastly more profitable than selling 5 licenses at a time . 
  winter is coming . 
  i 've seen both , and found the original 1972 solaris to be way better . 
  the 2002 hollywood solaris is mostly a drama about relationships and regret . 
  the [ 1972 soviet solaris ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069293/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) is more of a mystery thriller mixed with philosophical questions about alien life . 
  as a warning though ... it feels very `` long and slow '' compared to modern movies . 
  there are 10 + minute sections where nothing `` happens '' , just a car driving or some scenery panning by , even more so than in `` 2001 '' . 
  [ you do n't say ? 
  you 're not wrong , but the mods should not allow it even if it 's an useful tip and posting here is a great way to spread the message . 
  * everyone * wants to spread their message . 
  people want to spread android app warnings , post notices about lost people or pets , invite people to their * really important * protest movement / environmental cause / book club / diet / cult / whatever , share their new amazing novel , etc. 
  even if it 's done with no profit motive , nobody wants to wade through all that spam . 
  also , rule 5 : no screenshots . 
   i want to give myself the best chance at this, 
  everyone else has given advice on how to become a * nasa * astronaut . 
  but given how insanely competitive that is , i think the best realistic chance for going into space is actually very different :, 
  * stay in finance , optimise your career for making as much money as you can . 
  * pay russians $ 50 million for a flight to iss ( http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-03/25/russia-space-tourism-2018 ), 
  * hope that elon gets the commercial tourist flights going at lower prices , maybe even for under $ 10 million in the next 10 years . 
  starting a new space launch company is probably way overkill if you just want to go to space , 
  feel free to pm me if you have any questions about apps and software , i 've been building apps and data storage / analysis backends for startups for almost 10 years now . 
  ( although after a few attempts i decided that building apps for other startups is much less stressful than trying to run my own . ), 
  the very short summary of the argument is as follows :, 
  there are hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy alone , our sun is pretty average , and according to latest data , planets are common as well . 
  many of these are * billions * of years older than our sun and earth , and with a billion-year head start a civilization could probably spam the entire galaxy with automated probes . 
  but we have not yet seen any signals or evidence of life at any of those other stars . 
  so there must be some reason why intelligent life is pretty rare in the universe . 
  * it could be that life starting in the first place is rare . 
  * it could be that evolving into intelligent life is rare . 
  * it could be that intelligent life always kills itself off . 
  if we find microbes , then that 's evidence for life starting independently being a common occurrence , and the `` all life eventually kills itself before colonizing the stars '' possibility must be more likely . 
  the refugee crisis could be a great positive influence for estonian-russian integration and relationships in estonia . 
  people will realise how similar our cultures and lives actually are when compared to the `` new outsiders '' . 
  i 'm only half joking . 
  it 's possible to fake the `` from : '' and `` reply-to : '' headers of emails , so something that looks like it came from @google.com or @yourbank.com might actually be a fake email . 
  but it 's not possible to make a fake account that can also * receive * email . 
  so just send him a new email ( do n't hit reply on the original one ) to his @google.com address . 
  if he can see and respond to it , it 's legit . 
   he says he 's part of a new project in which they help a few companies per quarter right now set up strategy . 
  he also suggests that they do all the strategy related stuff free and that all money would be going directly to cost of clicks . 
  that sounds entirely possible . 
  google makes 99 % of its money from selling advertising , and they have a lot of people providing help & assistance to businesses who buy these ads . 
  if the guy only asks you to pay google on google sites where you typed the url into the browser yourself , then i do n't think there is an obvious way for this to be a scam . 
  if he asks to pay at www.g00gle.co , then it 's some phishing scam . 
  if it 's a fake :, 
  * could get an error back if such @google.com email does not exist at all . 
  * could get no response if it it exists and belongs to someone else , and they just delete it as spam . 
  if it 's legit :, 
  * could get an actual response , 
  * could get no response back because he 's very busy ... but if he does n't read your emails , then how is he supposed to help you anyway ? 
  what 's the best guess for a stable release at this time ? 
  no in a rush , just wondering how to plan a project that could really use the new row-level security !, 
  before starting with these infrastructure upgrades , install something like newrelic to see * why * the website is slow . 
  it will show you how many requests you are getting , which pages , how long they take to load , and which database queries they run . 
  it could be something as simple as a single bad database query in a loop on the front page . 
  if you live in the uk , it 's probably easiest to eventually get a local bank account . 
  but until then , and afterwards for gbp - eur transfers , use transferwise.com, 
  it was great when i was studying in the uk . 
  they do n't even have to be a group of rich people . 
  my university had a yacht club . 
  it owned a 40 foot yacht that the students maintained and fixed , organized very cheap classes on sailing , and 3-day trips were about $ 100 per person including food and sharing a car for the drive to the harbour . 
  most police forces do n't have the resources or skills to track down anonymous online accounts like this . 
  sure , if you [ hack banks for a billion dollars ] ( http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/15/hackers-steal-billion-in-banking-breach/23464913/ ) or [ run the world 's most popular online drug marketplace ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/04/world/americas/silk-road-ross-ulbricht/ ) , fbi will track you down eventually . 
  but a local city police force ca n't , they are too overworked with other cases .
