  mongodb ( or any other company ) is n't going to avoid shipping a useful feature to their customers just because a commercial partner also provides that feature . 
  because it 's not worth the effort for valve to make exceptions for the extremely rare people who do n't have phones , when it improves the experience for 99.9999 % of their users . 
  yes . 
  as far as i can see , they just changed the logo and the `` tagline '' . 
  but i have no idea how either of those will help with, 
   people know intellij idea . 
  people know resharper . 
  people know teamcity , but they do n't necessarily know that these products are from the same company , nor do they know what other products jetbrains offers . 
  it must be very painful to read all the speculation in / r/spacex and not being able to confirm or correct anything . 
  out of curiosity , as a whole ( not just launch dates but everything ) , how often are we correct ? 
  10 % of the time ? 
  has there been any news on this ? 
  i thought usaf had approved it , but still waiting for faa approval . 
  not a big fan though ... the new pycharm logo colors and the black rectangle on top are jarringly `` in your face '' . 
  it 's okay on their website , but does n't fit any other icons in the taskbar or window switcher . 
  i think we could do better than 7 stories . 
  maybe a kickstarter to buy / r/spacex 's own observation tower , for example http://www.ebay.com/itm/aermotor-fire-tower-deerstand-tower-100-ft-zipline-28-000us-firetower-/231755979198?hash=item35f5bb99be, 
  the price of a lego piece has remained constant , between 10 and 15 cents for the last 35 years . 
  when adjusted for inflation , it has actually gotten cheaper : https://flowingdata.com/2013/02/07/analysis-of-lego-brick-prices-over-the-years/, 
  lego seems more expensive , because the sets have doubled in size on average . 
  when i was a kid , the dream set that you hoped for was something like the [ 200-piece coast guard ] ( http://brickset.com/sets/6435-1/coast-guard-hq ) , but you were still excited about a 100-piece [ dump truck ] ( http://brickset.com/sets/6668-1/recycle-truck ) or [ helicopter truck ] ( http://brickset.com/sets/6328-1/helicopter-transport ) . 
  nowadays the top shelf dream sets are 1000-2000 pieces , and `` average '' ones around 500 . 
  or for lego technic : mobile crane 1978 model has 512 pieces , 1995 model has 850 pieces ( it was rad !, 
  ) , 2005 model has 1884 pieces , 2010 model 1289 pieces again , and finally 2013 model has 2606 pieces : http://brickset.com/sets/theme-technic/tag-crane, 
  sure , one month of gold on each bet , separately ? 
  the first one seems straightforward : i bet model3 is unveiled before mct . 
  the second one needs a bit more clarification i think . 
  let 's count first stage `` serious '' engines that fire at liftoff . 
  so for example [ the n1 had 30 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6t2s5zu.jpg ) , space shuttle had 5 ( 3 engines + 2 solid boosters ) , falcon 9 has 9 . 
  later stages , control thrusters , abort engines , etc do n't count . 
  hm yes , i mean the bfr - as it takes off from earth . 
  30 engines for use * after reaching orbit * would be too insane even for elon . 
  hmm , interesting . 
  if i calculated it correctly , these two would have provided 0.2 % ( 1/500 ) of the lift-off thrust . 
  why was such a small increase worth the extra complexity ? 
  would n't it have been easier to make the main engines or solids a tiny bit more powerful ? 
  thanks for the explanation !, 
  so from googling a bit more , it seems that they were used during launch in two situations :, 
  * as you mentioned , as a the engine that takes over after the external tank is gone and the ssmes have shut off . 
  * starting from 1998 , sometimes also fired after dropping the solid boosters , but while the ssmes are still active , for a bit of extra thrust and also for getting rid of excess fuel in the oms tanks . 
  so for the clarification of the bet , i would place them somewhere as part of stage 1.5 to 2.5 ( labelling stages for the shuttle is tricky ) : they are n't lit on the ground , and sometimes only after all other engines have shut off . 
  or maybe they still count , because they are at the bottom of the rocket right next to the first stage engines . 
  diatz , what do you think ? 
  although i suppose that there wo n't be such unambiguous cases with the bfr , which i expect will be a * big * usual vertically stacked rocket . 
  [ i 'm more than a bird , i 'm more than a plane , i 'm a birdplane ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ys5guifjyo ), 
  but once it has been leaked to l2 , avoiding sharing it with / r/spacex makes no difference . 
  l2 is n't a secret club or a `` safe space '' , anyone who pays the fee can log in and browse the posts . 
  i 'm sure people from all aerospace companies ( including spacex and their competitors ) to perhaps even people from north korea have accounts . 
  once it 's leaked to l2 , people from spacex will notice sooner rather than later , and will still try to crack down on leaks . 
   the l2 section in the nsf forums contains a lot of industry people with inside information that choose to share exclusive information under the assumption of good faith and privacy . 
  if that 's the case , then that seems very unwise of them . 
  anyone who pays the l2 fee can browse the content . 
  i 'm sure people from all aerospace companies ( including spacex and their competitors ) , to people from russia and perhaps even from north korea have accounts . 
  it 's not a private space by any means . 
  if they post there , then it 's either information that they can share with the public , or they are leaking confidential information to `` anyone '' already . 
   how would you ( hypothetically ) recover from your private keys being stolen ? 
  well it 's simple - whoever has your private keys legally * is * you and now takes over your life . 
  your wife and kids will be upset for a little while while they adjust to having a new dad , but it 's all your own fault for not securing your keys properly . 
  same experience here : rq is * a lot * simpler to install and configure than celery . 
  i 'm now using it in all of my projects except one . 
  the one is still on celery because i have n't found a good way to schedule tasks with exact < 1 minute delays ( i need 10 seconds , not `` next full minute '' ) with rq . 
   what other hypotheses do you guys have ? 
  my hypothesis is that some of the leaked numbers are wrong . 
  someone misheard or misremembered , and then mis-leaked the numbers . 
  that 's a much simpler explanation than empty space wasted on walkways in first stage fuel tanks ? 
  if it gets patched at all . 
  smartphones tend to get updates and patches for 1-3 years after first release . 
  and a similar software support period seems to be starting to take place with smart tvs . 
  i do n't see companies bothering to keep patching and updating software in all internet-connected things anywhere close to the hardware lifetime of those things . 
   seb offers you a virtual credit card that has a expiry date of few months and you can set the limit . 
  that 's ok if you buy online a couple of times per year , but would get really annoying for active use , no ? 
  i pay for web hosting , spotify , uber , amazon purchases , ms office subscription , backup service subscription , dropbox , etc with a card - updating these every three years is already tedious . 
  air looks cleaner in blade runner, 
  static fire is n't just a quick engine test : it goes through the full countdown and launch process , just shutting down the engines instead of releasing clamps a few seconds after `` launch '' . 
  so why not release the rocket and let it fly if it goes well ? 
  because they need to hit exact launch times , often to the second . 
  if a problem turns up that would delay the launch , then even if its a quick fix , it could mean long delays until the next opportunity to try launching arrives . 
  but they can schedule static fires whenever , so that they still have time to fix issues before the real launch time . 
  but uruguay and florida only have a 2 hour time difference ? 
  yes , it 's a reasonable argument . 
  but if the salesman is n't authorized to make that change , * then the contract is n't valid * , and op is still gets what they want ( refuse arbitration ) . 
  the default situation when no contract exists is already in op 's favour . 
  how frequent are the updates really ? 
  unless you are expecting a real firehose of data , consider just using https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/ for the server -  app communication . 
  the same api works for both android and ios from the server side . 
  this is precisely for the use case of notifying apps when new data is waiting on the server , and as a bonus :, 
  * you do n't have to implement any sockets or long-lived connections yourself ,, 
  * it shares a single socket to google/apple servers for all apps on the device , which saves battery ,, 
  * it can wake up the cpu and start your app even if the device is suspended ,, 
  * starting from android 6.0 , android will force-suspend your app if the screen is off even if holding wakelocks ; incoming gcm messages are one of the few exceptions that are allowed for background processing . 
  the new extra-cooled fuel might be the reason for this ? 
  if they load it too early , then it will heat up in the tanks ? 
   probably just an excuse for some property owners to not pull up the heat ( and wallet ) . 
  this can sometimes be an issue in september , but it 's now almost christmas . 
  once it 's turned on , it 's either constantly on for the whole winter , or somehow automatically controlled based on outside ( inaccurate ) or inside ( more accurate ) temperatures . 
  and as you said , sometimes the radiator does sometimes get warm , so heating most certainly has been turned on . 
  what sort of house are you renting an apartment in ? 
  my best guess is that the temperature controller is somehow badly calibrated or whatever . 
  if it 's a big apartment building , then the landlord ca n't do anything by themselves , they will have to ask the * korteri\u00fchistu * to send an engineer into the basement or something . 
  ask the landlord to speak to the building management , or ask for their contact details .
