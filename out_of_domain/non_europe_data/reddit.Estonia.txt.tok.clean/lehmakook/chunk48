  there is no legal requirement to pay yourself a salary . 
  but the tax office tries to say that if you do `` active work '' for your income in your one-person o\u00dc , then you are supposed to tax the dividend payouts with social tax . 
  if your profits in the o\u00dc are from `` business profit '' , then not . 
  but what exactly counts as `` active work '' , and if you actually need to do that are currently debated in a few high-profile court cases and in the news . 
  the results have been confusing , with sometimes the tax office winning and sometimes not . 
  sometimes these contracts have been re-classified as an employee relationship , with the * client * ending up responsible for the social tax . 
  if you charge one client a hourly rate , and pay yourself zero salary , and take everything as dividend , then that 's probably risky . 
  if you have multiple clients , and pay yourself near the estonian average salary , then that 's probably okay . 
  if your o\u00dc has multiple owners and/or hired employees who do the bulk of the work instead of you , then it 's certainly okay . 
   i 've done my research and understand that generally an o\u00dc seems to be much preferred and has lots of advantages over fie . 
  o\u00dc has other advantages besides taxes - mainly that as a fie , you are personally responsible for all business debts . 
  apart from deliberate fraud , the o\u00dc owners are not . 
   would i get to send myself on maternity leave ??? 
  not sure , but this is certainly worth figuring out . 
  the maternity leave payments in estonia are very generous , i think 100 % salary up to 2700 eur/month , for until the baby is 18 months old . 
  the salary is calculated based on social tax paid in the previous calendar year . 
  if there was no social tax paid , then it 's based on the minimum salary . 
  there may be special cases people moving between different eu countries , not sure . 
  so for tl ; dr : the overall suggestions i 've heard from my accountant and various friends in freelance are :, 
  * o\u00dc for sure instead of fie ,, 
  * make sure you have at least a few different clients ,, 
  * pay yourself at least average salary ( 1000-1200 eur or so ) ,, 
  * take the remaining profits as dividend . 
  maternity leave may change things , but not sure about that . 
   they have like 7 + places that offer indian food , among which are some more authentic and expensive ones , or restaurants in the old town, 
  that 's still `` rare as rocking horse shit '' for someone coming from the uk , 
  accountants can definitely explain the different forms of running a business and the taxes required for each . 
  i suppose they may also know about the maternity leave details , but you 'd have to ask if they do . 
  my guess is that they will know if they or their friends are recent parents , and otherwise not . 
  thanks , very interesting blog post , and presentations & papers from the same author !, 
  i guess i can use crc , pick the crc length based on how many bits i can afford for it , and choose the best polynomial for the data & check sizes based on his paper . 
  this is probably too specific to find an answer for without luckily stumbling on someone 's phd thesis , but i wonder if there is any analysis of other error modes than bit flips and bursts of zero bits . 
  in the barcode application , i expect that most of my errors will be `` block shifts '' : moving a part to the left or right , and deleting and duplicating bits on the side . 
  could become, 
  by shifting the block `` 11 '' by one to the right , deleting from the right , and duplicating a bit to its left . 
  i expect this to be the main error mode because of imperfect camera perspective correction - if the corners of the barcode are slightly wrong , then the grid of pixels i 'm looking at will be stretched , squeezed or moved from its expected location . 
  you would assume so , but there have been a number of cases where people were charged , some convicted for `` just changing the url in a browser '' . 
  it 's more about whether the server owner `` authorized '' you to view the page , rather than the technical competence or strength of the security measures . 
  * http://www.technologyreview.com/view/507661/jail-looms-for-man-who-revealed-att-leaked-ipad-user-e-mails/ ( changed user number in the url ), 
  * http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/business/dealbook/insider-trading-sec-hacking-case.html?_r=0 ( changed article numbers in websites , saw not-yet-published earnings reports ),

  even if you should be eventually found not guilty , it 's * very * risky to report security issues on other people 's websites or servers in a way that can be tracked back to you . 
  you can only pay voluntarily if you are a permanent resident of estonia ( op 's gf no longer is ) : https://www.haigekassa.ee/et/inimesele/kindlustus/vabatahtlik-kindlustus, 
  perhaps you could get around it by not telling any government agency in estonia or germany about moving , and hoping that they do n't figure it out and come back for the health services costs when you fall ill . 
  overall the cross-border health insurance is for emergencies when travelling - you are supposed to get long-term health insurance from the country where you currently live . 
  note that most used car sellers who look like companies are actually just `` commission advertising companies '' who manage the storage and sales process , but the actual owner could still be a private individual , and the sales contract will be between private individuals . 
  if the actual owner is a private individual , then you get zero legal consumer protection benefits and need to take the previous owner ( not the sales company ) to civil court if there are any problems . 
  hint : if the value added tax ( k\u00e4ibemaks , shortened to km ) in the advert is 0 % , then it 's most likely a private owner . 
  if it 's 20 % , then it 's most likely owned by a company . 
  ask them if you have any doubts . 
  it 's * very * risky to buy an used car in estonia without having it checked out by a mechanic that you choose before handing over the cash . 
  `` running a business in estonia '' is just too vague to be able to help . 
  * what kind of business ? 
  * are you thinking of a new fancy cafe in tallinn ? 
  a mobile game studio ? 
  a sawmill in the southern estonia ? 
  the paperwork for all small businesses will be somewhat similar and easy , but after that it 's all about your sales and marketing skills , not about `` estonia '' . 
  start working for a brand-name cleaning service . 
  your cut of the payments will be very little , but they will take care of finding customers , scheduling , and processing payments . 
  after you have a few regular trustworthy customers who ask for you by name , offer them to cut out the middle man and start working for them directly . 
  get paid in cash , and declare it on your taxes . 
  quit the brand-name cleaning service . 
  this is extremely common in long-term services like cleaning , gardening , etc. 
  and also a reason why a bunch of recent uber-of-cleaning `` startups '' have failed : once you have found a cleaner that you like and trust , there is no more value provided by the middle-man service . 
  put a \\ before the ), 
   i honestly do n't know , my accountant said that in order for the purchase to be ok for a company , the vehicle must be registered as a ` commercial ' one . 
  i 'm no expert on the rules , but that does n't seem right . 
  there is no requirement that companies can only buy `` commercial '' vehicles in estonia , but there are differences in taxation . 
  * value added tax when purchasing :, 
  usually when you buy stuff from anyone , they have to add 20 % vat to the price . 
  but companies ( if they are vat registered ) can discount the vat or ask for it back from the tax office , so in effect buy stuff 20 % cheaper . 
  this includes vehicles , except `` passenger cars '' . 
  for passenger cars , you get only half of the vat back , unless you can show that they are for re-sale or renting out to customers . 
  for any other vehicles , like trucks , buses , etc , you get all of the vat back . 
  but this is irrelevant for the small van you linked - the ad says 0 % vat is added , so there is nothing to get back ( and it probably means the seller is an individual ) . 
  it is also irrelevant if your company is not vat registered , since then you also do n't get to ask for it back . 
  * `` special benefit '' ( erisoodustus ) tax when the company allows employees or owners to make personal trips . 
  this tax is added to all sorts of benefits companies give to employees for free , to make them equivalent to salary payouts . 
  for passenger cars , if you do n't keep track of which trips are work trips , then it 's a flat fee of ~ 250 eur per month . 
  if you keep track of trips , and they are all for work only , then there is no extra tax . 
  if you keep track of trips , and some are personal , then you pay 30 cents per km of personal trips or 250 eur per month , whichever is smaller . 
  for all other vehicles ( not passenger cars ) , if the employees/owners make personal trips , then you are supposed to pay ~ 60 % tax on what it would cost for the employee to get the same benefit from elsewhere . 
  the tax office uses a long-term rental price as an example of how to find its value . 
  so for example if take the company van for a personal road trip , and renting it would cost 20 eur / day , then you are supposed to pay approximately 12 eur / day in tax . 
  not sure if there are requirements for tracking or documentation of trips . 
   basically , in my country , commercial vehicles are those which clearly are used for commercial purposes , for example a car whose back seats have been removed etc. 
  not sure how exactly it works here , but i think it 's mostly based on the type registration of the vehicle , which in turn is mostly based on the * fully loaded weight * of the vehicle . 
  the biggest potential risk seems to be that someone 's house is broken into while your service is down , and they sue you for not alerting of ( and potentially preventing ) the crime . 
  i would always suggest running a service with paying customers as a llc , but it really depends on how expensive it is whereever you are based , for $ 15/month in income it might be a significant expense . 
  if you have other side projects or businesses , you can bunch them together in one llc until there is enough assets or different risk levels to be worth separating them . 
  but there are various other ways of reducing risk :, 
  * liability insurance . 
  * a clear contract and service level policy with your customers , where you say that your liability is limited to refunds , not damages . 
   uwsgi also has more configuration options, 
  [ understatement of the year here ] ( https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/options.html ) , 
  uwsgi is amazing , but the biggest complaint i have is that it has way too many poorly structured and documented configuration options : 400 in core , and over 1200 with the plugins . 
  and what 's the difference between ` pidfile ` and ` pidfile2 ` , and ` log-date ` and ` logdate ` ?? 
   i get the following strange one which from google translate i 've figured out was about drugs being sent to my place . 
  drug dogs barked at the letter , they opened it , found 13.7 grams of plant matter that quick tested positive for weed . 
  they sent it for further analysis to a lab .
