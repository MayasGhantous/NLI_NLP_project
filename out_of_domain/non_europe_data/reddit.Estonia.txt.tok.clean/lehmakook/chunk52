  it 's on the wrong ocean , for west coast launches . 
   the ultimate labor colony for china and sk, 
  and the sad thing is , this would still be a tremendous upgrade in quality of life and freedom for nk people . 
  before i moved to intellij , yes . 
  a few copies even . 
  because every 2-3 months eclipse decided to corrupt my workspace/plugin files , and needed a fresh install . 
  not allowing your citizens to leave is the best indicator of a shitty dictatorship - ussr in the past , nk now . 
  it means that things are so bad that you need to keep people locked in as `` state labour property '' . 
  but a transitional nk government would not need to lock people in . 
  every other country can decide for themselves if they want to give some north koreans visas to enter . 
  it 's a bit hidden , but if you scroll down on the booking page on tallink.ee , they sell single tickets in a 4-person cabin shared with random strangers as well , for 1/4th of the price . 
  looks like the prices are starting from 40 eur each way in that case in may . 
  but of course sharing with friends would be a lot more enjoyable . 
  the ferry is also good because it 's overnight - starting at 6pm , arriving at 10am or so . 
  so you save on one night of hotel costs , and avoid wasting a day on travelling . 
  but sleeping on the ferry can be scary if it happens to be a stormy night . 
  come on , it 's * news * not a movie or a book . 
  news is supposed to have a short and accurate `` spoiler '' in the title , not a buzzfeed clickbait `` you wo n't believe what this google algorithm just did ! '' . 
  i get the annoyance if you watch go matches for entertainment - i do the same with spacex launches . 
  but its not something you will ever find spoiler-free links to on the internet . 
  event sports news puts results in the title . 
  same here . 
  but do n't start complicating everything with separate repos and submodules when you * intend * an app to be re-usable - split them up later when you actually start re-using it in multiple projects . 
  the program can most likely stay the same , they may need to re-run all the millions of simulated matches against itself to train it though . 
   why throw away the analysis of the variations you already did ? 
  simple game ais throw it away because keeping it does not provide much benefit . 
  for example , let 's say a program considers 10 moves , and 10 opponents moves in response . 
  after the two moves , only 1/100 of the work done previously is still useful . 
  might as well start from scratch to keep the program simpler . 
  but i 'm guessing that alphago would still keep it - the extra 1 % performance is nice to have , and perhaps a lot of the board position and potential moves evaluation has not changed for the parts of the board that are sufficiently far away from the last played moves . 
   why do so many ai-related libraries seem to use python ? 
  python was one of my first languages , never cared much for it and moved on to java ( android ) , c # ( unity ) etc. 
  clearly , i was wrong and i guess i need to give it another go . 
  not sure about ai specifically , but python is extremely popular in all sorts of scientific fields because :, 
  * it 's a reasonably easy language to learn for a beginner ,, 
  * there is a large set of very fast ( wrappers for c and fortran ) numerical computation libraries and good plotting tools ,, 
  * unlike r or matlab , it 's also useful for other types of software - you can use your existing skills to write better-than-bash scripts , web apps , desktop guis , etc. 
  if i understand correctly , laser safety glasses work by absorbing the wavelength of the laser you are working with , while allowing other wavelengths to pass ( so that you can still see something ) . 
  if so , how useful are they for such high powered lasers ? 
  1kw focused on a small area should melt through them in an instant ? 
  vacuum cleaners create a lot of static electricity , which may fry electronics if you touch it while cleaning . 
  one thing that will complicate using the margin of victory is that it is very non-linear . 
  you can play go `` peacefully '' , focusing on territory and influence , or aggressively by starting a big fight where you bet a lot of points on who is able to read the outcome more moves ahead . 
  large margins come from winning one local fight , not from steady better play . 
  here you go : / r/fence, 
  an ( european ) friend of mine got his ( european ) bank account closed and permanently banned from re-opening , because he put an american mobile phone number on it . 
  he was visiting the us for 3 months in the summer , super fun to start your 3-month road trip by learning that your bank account and cards have been closed . 
  but apparently it was easier for the bank to just deny service to anyone who * might * be an us citizen , rather than spend the time on checking it in detail or reporting data to the us irs . 
  some more ideas :, 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaali_crater - tbh a bit boring tiny lake to look at in reality , but interesting because it 's a meteorite crater . 
  * if you have enough time , you can take the ferry directly between saaremaa and hiiumaa , and visit both islands . 
  * there are nice lighthouses on the southern tip of saaremaa https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s%c3%b5rve_lighthouse and western tip of hiiumaa https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b5pu_lighthouse, 
  it will be two separate tests ? 
  one for the nuke and one for the rocket , not with a nuke * on * the rocket . 
  i 'm sure there are unicode code points for that . 
  links ? 
  html ? 
  real hackers ^ tm use a plain text 7-bit ascii index.txt file . 
  the justice department databases are built and maintained by centre of registers and information systems ( http://www.rik.ee/en ) . 
  in particular the e-file system you see there is much more extensive than it looks like from the website : many other databases such as the court documents database , criminal records database , jail information system , probation information system etc are `` views '' and user interfaces on top of the e-file which holds the master copy of all documents for court-related stuff . 
  the police operations databases are built and maintained by ministry of internal affairs it department ( http://www.smit.ee/ ) , but they do n't seem to have much info for the public , and no services that are open to the public . 
  the dyson airblades are still terrible . 
  it 's impossible to put your hands in there without accidentally touching the sides , or worse the bottom with a stinky puddle of water . 
  they are faster than usual dryers just because they have a stronger fan - the air speed helps more than temperature . 
  but some places have very high speed usual dryers , for example http://www.xleratoreurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/xchanger_angled_on_wall_thumb.jpg , which are even better . 
  after reading a long post , `` what starbucks can do '' turns out to just be `` pay employees more '' . 
  sure , they should , but there is no unusual insight or / r/bestof quality there ? 
  looks like a shit tour too - calling a visit to saku brewery and some cheese factory `` gourmet '' , come on ? 
   0p deal can very well be a purchase . 
  it happens all the time in commercial agreements between companies . 
  in some countries ( uk for example ) contracts have to provide some value to both sides to be enforceable , so # 1 amounts are popular in contracts . 
  and a 0p purchase is much easier to cancel than a 1p one . 
  this is a popular , but untrue myth : http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/spacepen.asp, 
  * pencils are dangerous , because little bits of graphite will float anywhere , and graphite conducts electricity . 
  * the space pen was developed by fisher pen company using only his own money . 
  once finished , he sold them to nasa at $ 3 per pen . 
   that 's fair but how similar is the `` similar economic space '', 
   the only similarity is they 're both software , which really is no similarity . 
  that is similar enough . 
  `` computer software '' is a economic space for trademarks , regardless of what the software does or how it is licensed . 
  no similarity would mean a shampoo or plumbing service , or for example a clothes retailer : http://www.kik.de/, 
  is it really disingenuous ? 
  they ( probably correctly ) thought that they have a right to the name , since they have a trademark for `` kik '' in the field of `` computer software '' , registered well before the small open source project was started . 
  and they most likely did plan to force a `` yes '' if being polite did n't work . 
  `` respond yes , or we 'll force you to respond yes '' is a reasonable email to write , if you are certain that you actually can force a yes , and asking nicely is just out of politeness or hope for goodwill . 
  that 's a lot of work to work around this `` problem '' , and will not help much anyway . 
  plenty of other situations will leave gaps in sequences :, 
  * when a transaction is rolled back due to a conflict ,, 
  * when the postgres process crashes or is hard-shutdown ,, 
  * when sequence caching is used , every time a client disconnects ,, 
  * when anyone runs the nextval ( ) function and does n't use it . 
  not yet . . 
  i 've been working on other newer projects where i use redis-queue instead of celery . 
  but please let me know if you figure something out . 
  regarding these requirements for practicing law in estonia - i thought they were only a requirement if you want to represent people in estonian court ? 
  it should be fine to work as an legal consultant for companies who do business in us without being a certified lawyer here ? 
   she could be trying to ensure that all her accounts are within the fdic insurance limits . 
  no , she certainly is n't . 
  nobody gives 50k to a `` friend '' when they are worried about fdic insurance limits , they just open accounts in their own name at different banks . 
  this analogy does n't really match .
