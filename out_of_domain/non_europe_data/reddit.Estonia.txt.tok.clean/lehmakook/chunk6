  but you could do the same with a manned ship . 
  they are reasonably profitable if you figure out how to do 2-3 contracts per ship . 
  but building the ship for that can be tricky . 
  you are looking for a non-compete agreement , not a nda . 
  but it 's unlikely to be useful to you . 
  * if you do n't want the development firm to come out with a similar app * themselves * , you have little to worry about . 
  development firms are happy to charge you money for building things , because they prefer the stable income from work to taking the risk ( and rewards ) of releasing and marketing their own products . 
  * if you do n't want the development firm to build apps for other people who might have similar ideas or end up your competitors , they are going to refuse . 
  all firms work on many projects for many clients , and they are n't going to turn down future business just to get a small prototype project from you . 
  learning from your project , putting it into a portfolio , and using this experience as a selling point for future clients who want similar apps is part of the business . 
  the kid * is n't born yet * , you need a much more invasive test than a spit swab for that . 
  but in any case , there is no point in giving in to the crazy demands . 
   in reality , as long as everything is done right by you guys , you make it impossible for anyone with malicious intent to harm doge . 
  not really . 
  if you look at https://www.litecoinpool.org/pools then any of the top 5 litecoin pools could 51 % attack doge on their own without any warning . 
  even if clevermining put * all * of its hashrate into doge , then the top 2 litecoin pools could still succeed at an attack . 
  the reason they have n't is that they prefer to profit from keeping on mining litecoin rather than messing with doge ( or they are just nice ) . 
  the risk is reduced after most of the big litecoin pools start merge mining dogecoin . 
  i wonder if that `` political direction '' refers to sanctions on/from russia , and the supply of rd180 engines for the atlas v. was n't the next batch of engines supposed to be delivered this week ? 
  if they do n't arrive , picking the two teams that use atlas v would be unwise . 
  you do n't need to put licenses on the code to do this . 
  unless you are a full-time employee or have a contract that includes copyright transfer , you are the sole , `` all rights reserved '' owner of the source code . 
  i 'll report a gpl violation . 
  report to whom ? 
  as the owner of the gpl-licensed code , you still have to go to court about copyright infringement yourself , and you can do that just as well without any open-source license on the code . 
  organisations like the free software foundation [ only fight for gpl violations on code that they own ] ( http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html ) ( being written by their members , or assigned to them ) - but they wo n't take over your project unless it 's actually useful to the general public . 
  if you are certain that they are still using your code , and they are hosting it at a server provider who follows the dmca , you can file a takedown request with the hosting company to annoy the client . 
  but if the new developers have started from scratch or removed * all * of your code , then the copyright angle might not work . 
  the best approach might be gather as much evidence as you can that they agreed to pay you for your work , and sue them to enforce payment . 
  / u/clevermining 's main point is that it does n't matter if they are hashing doge or not . 
  anyone in the world with enough scrypt miners , for example any of the top 3-5 litecoin pools ( https://www.litecoinpool.org/pools ) have enough hashing power to jump into dogecoin without notice , and perform a 51 % attack . 
  they have had this power for a long time , and the fact that they are not currently hashing doge does n't change anything . 
  if there 's a risk of someone taking over the pool and using it for malicious goals , then f2pool and silverfish are just as much of a risk as clevermining . 
  this risk is over only after the majority of scrypt miners in the world are merge-mining litecoin and doge . 
  this is n't possible at all , because the sun not a point light source - it 's * bigger * than earth . 
  if a shade is placed near earth , it has to be as big as the earth . 
  the closer you put the shade to the sun , the * bigger * it needs to be . 
  if it 's near the sun , it needs to be almost as big as the sun . 
  your post title !, 
  that still would n't work . 
  the sun can * look * as a small pinpoint for a * single * human eye , but it never actually would get smaller . 
  light emitted from the north pole of sun arriving at the north pole of earth has to be blocked , and light emitted from the south pole of sun arriving at the south pole of earth has to be blocked . 
  these two rays of light never get closer than 1 earth diameter to each other . 
   not a resource , not a physics change that greatly improves the game , not even eve . 
  bananas . 
  it 's not like these things are comparable , or one-or-the-other . 
  a banana part is something a dev could add as a joke in a few hours . 
  resources , physics updates , etc. 
  take months of development and testing work . 
  more merchants can make it attractive for more users . 
  but not with usual merchants . 
  for the vast majority of purchases , paying with cash , credit card or paypal is easier and faster than buying bitcoin for the first time . 
  nobody is going to learn how to get into bitcoin to get a 2-20 % discount on pizza - the effort and exchange fees are not worth it . 
  the current push for more merchants makes it possible for people * who already have bitcoin * to spend them , but it 's not enough to convince everyone else to buy bitcoin instead of just entering their credit card number . 
  the one advantage bitcoin has is reasonably high privacy for online payments , so the merchants have to be of the kind where people really value privacy over their effort : * porn * . 
  `` anonymous porn money '' is one angle that could actually attract more everyday users to buy bitcoin to keep their subscriptions form appearing on their credit card bills . 
  the rebuy option at coinbase is a fantastically clever for them . 
  if you `` pay with bitcoin and rebuy '' on coinbase , then, 
  * coinbase sends usd to the merchant ,, 
  * coinbase pulls usd from your bank account ,, 
  * coinbase still charges you fees ,, 
  * and no bitcoin balance ever changes at all . 
  it 's at best a gimmick used to convince bitcoin holders to promote coinbase and grow their market share as an usual payment processor . 
  i 'm not so sure . 
  spacex could be making a lot of money in the future , but it 's also spending a lot of money right now . 
  thousands of engineers , and building out a manufacturing chain and launchpads is expensive . 
  and while musk certainly knows all the silicon valley 's biggest investors , in the end they would be looking to make a profit instead of taking humanity to mars . 
  and that profit might be too far in the future compared to investing in the latest silly social app which facebook or google buys two years later . 
  to tap a fax , you have to either tap the phone line in the building , in the ground , or at the exchange . 
  in any case , you need to actually target a specific phone line , and be physically present in the area . 
  but you can compromise someone 's computer by sending them a pdf or other file with malware , and having them open it . 
  you 'd be surprised by how many corporate offices still use windows xp and ie6 , and never-updated versions of adobe reader , and there might not be anyone properly knowledgeable about computer security in the organisation . 
  there have even been various completely automated malware that infects your computer , and either uploads all of the documents found somewhere , or encrypts and holds your files hostage . 
  if a three-letter-agency is after you , you are screwed in any case . 
  they could just walk in and demand copies of all documents . 
  but having data on computers is less secure because there are a lot of people all over the world looking to compromise systems with no particular target in mind , and they would not pay for a flight to come and tap your fax . 
  let 's skip the whole big theatre , and just have a cinema that 's hundreds of toilet stalls with tvs . 
  dinner and movie dates would be awkward tough . 
  i 'd like to see how that works out when you ask for a refund . 
  `` here 's your $ 19 back for the hardware , but unfortunately we ca n't undo or refund already performed services . '', 
  dilution is n't a bad thing by itself . 
  when investors put money into a business at a fair valuation , the value of the existing owners ' shares stays the same . 
  their percentage goes down , but the value of the whole business goes up by the investment amount . 
  but one of the many problems with the services for equity deal is that as a 1 % owner , you would have no say in the future investment rounds . 
  hell , if you worked for many companies , you would n't even have time to keep up with the current state of their investment and business deals . 
  for example , if a company is previously worth $ 1m , and you own 1 % , then that 's $ 10k . 
  if investors put in $ 250k , then the value of the company becomes $ 1.25 m. 
  they now own 20 % , because $ 250k is one fifth of $ 1.25 m. 
  everyone else now owns 80 % of the company - meaning that your new percentage is 4/5 of what it used to be . 
  so now you own 0.8 % of the company . 
  but 0.8 % of the new value , $ 1.25 m is still the same $ 10k . 
   now , if my 1 % is based on the company being worth `` x '' and then the company accepts funding by a partner who values the company at `` y '' does my value and percentage both change to reflect that ? 
  it changes based on `` y '' and how much they put in . 
  it does n't matter what the value was when you were given 1 % of the shares . 
  it is expected that the value of your shares changes ( hopefully upwards !, 
  or to anyone willing to put a day of effort in .
