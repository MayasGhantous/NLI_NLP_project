  i 'm willing to * bet * that there are plenty of other glaring security holes as well . 
  very [ retro ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_izwyfpnfvqi/tuyefwbfibi/aaaaaaaaauo/mnzh9h89xi4/s1600/dsc_0183.jpg ) . 
  how about a coin-operated doorbell ? 
   the metric expansion of space does not happen where there is significant gravity , as in a galaxy . 
  does that mean that there still is expansion , but gravity pulls the galaxy back together ? 
  or is gravity actually somehow preventing or resisting expansion ? 
  new ksp versions have been released every 2-4 months , so you are still good for a few months . 
  fascinating , thanks !, 
  kopli used to be the place not to visit . 
  now it 's the hipster and artist district of tallinn . 
  even the space shuttle , with no crew escape system , had self-destruct charges . 
  if some error had caused it to fly towards land instead of the atlantic ocean , the range safety officer would have blown it up . 
  the baby did n't consent to its parents having sex or being born either , but it still needs diapers , food and school supplies . 
  this thread explains some of the reasons , mostly based on open-source projects that oracle has bought and then pushed hard to monetize : http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2e2c1o/what_do_we_hate_oracle_for/, 
  it 's not really shady in an illegal deals way . 
  it has enough lawyers to make sure that any deals stay barely in the legally allowed side , while maximising potential profit . 
  maximising profit is the * only * thing larry ellison and oracle seem to care about . 
  every company wants to make money , but oracle is comically single-minded about it . 
  the size of the u.s. pet food , toys & services market was $ 55.72 billion in 2013 . 
  dogecoin with $ 11 million `` market cap '' is clearly undervalued !, 
  it 's difficult to estimate that without actually being shown 100 pictures . 
   i do n't think there 's anything inherently illegal about the bank accounts . 
  though they may be doing it to avoid paying taxes ( which is illegal ) . 
  no serious company would ask temporary employees to use their personal bank account for their business transactions . 
  it 's certainly a scam , at best laundering money for the company , but more likely helping scammers transfer money abroad from local fraud victims ' credit cards and bank accounts . 
  their `` customers '' will `` pay '' you , you send the money abroad to the scammers , and you end up on the hook for repayment ( and probably fraud charges ) when the victims notice their money has gone missing . 
  i do n't even get what his problem with chargebacks is . 
  it can be a pain if you are a merchant who is hit with many invalid chargebacks , * but most merchants are not , and he 's not the merchant * . 
  / u/saurik even said that it 's not a problem for him . 
  so customers are fine with it ( they can chargeback if needed ) , and cydia is fine with it ( they get more business , and do n't have excessive chargebacks ) . 
  i 'm not sure any of them actually want to buy software from cydia with bitcoin . 
  they are just upset that saurik does n't believe in their glorious magic numbers , and is n't helping them pump it . 
  `` not going to space today '' - activate all engines and decouplers . 
  human eyes are amazingly sensitive in darkness - they can adjust to light levels up to 1 billion times in difference . 
  but it takes 20-30 minutes in darkness to adjust to the highest sensitivity . 
  few people would have the patience to drive to a location with no light pollution , switch off all flashlights , and wait . 
  * do n't * use a `` ram clean up '' tool . 
  it makes your system perform worse , not better . 
  ever since the earliest versions 5 + years ago , android has had proper ram management in the os itself . 
  it keeps apps open in the background , so that they open fast when you switch to them . 
  but it kills and cleans up background apps when actively used apps want to use more memory . 
  it has a bunch of clever ways to figure out which apps to clean up first and which to keep - based on for example how recently you have used them . 
  there was a misunderstanding . 
  / u/lorthneeda was talking about the today 's asiasat launch , and the deleted user was talking about the f9r kaboom . 
  do you remember the time when you saw the flash ? 
  enter your exact location ( to within a few km , nearest city is not enough ) and timezone at the top right at http://www.heavens-above.com/iridiumflares.aspx and check !, 
  it 's also great for predicting upcoming flashes . 
  note that more negative numbers are brighter . 
  the sad part about all this waste is that it 's not even doing useful work for bitcoin . 
  bitcoin does n't need trillions of hashes per second to `` be secure '' against 51 % attacks . 
  it would be just as secure with one hash per second or per minute split across users , as long as nobody else can beat it . 
  all this electricity and effort of building new hardware is just competition for the fixed number of bitcoin handed out to miners per day . 
  if all firms stopped developing new miners , or if all asics blew up at the same time , bitcoin would still function the same way . 
  or in fact , i predict that very soon a small number of hardware developers are going to be the only ones left mining , and could easily attack the network if a few of them decide to . 
  note that you can get an estonian id card even as a non-estonian eu national . 
  the big 3 telecoms is all there is , all smaller brands are actually their re-sellers or even their own low-cost brands . 
  but all of them have pre-paid options - you do n't need any sort of id for those , you can get a sim card and load money onto it in most supermarkets and kiosks . 
  what direction is research into future processor design going towards ? 
  do you think fully asynchronous processors will become more popular as transistors get smaller ? 
  or will the asynchronity ( if that 's a word ) be reserved for high-level communication between a large number of synchronous processor cores , sort of a networked-cluster-on-a-chip ? 
  hmm , at those odds , i 'm willing to bet against you !, 
  but lets keep the stakes at a more reasonable 25/10 ? 
  just to clarify - it would be if spacex is selected , you win $ 10 from me . 
  and if spacex is not selected , then i win $ 25 from you , right ? 
  i * think * we are on the same page . 
  my understanding was :, 
  * if spacex ( and someone else ) gets cctcap funding from nasa , you win $ 10 from me . 
  * if spacex is excluded from cctcap , sn and boeing get money from nasa , i win $ 25 from you . 
   `` they want a guilty plea on their books , and that 's what they 're going to get , '' mr. shrem said on saturday from his parents ' home in brooklyn . 
  `` they got a bitcoiner . '', 
   mr. shrem , 24 , said his plea could include jail time , though he is optimistic that it will not . 
  before his sentencing in about three months , he said , he plans to ask bitcoin supporters to write letters to the judge on his behalf . 
  this guy has no idea how the legal system works , or must be actually happy to be a `` martyr for bitcoin '' . 
  in any case , do not let him into the house . 
  if he gets in , he wo n't leave , any arguments might get physical , and you have a much bigger problem than being potentially sued . 
  also , it sounds like you give in easily in negotiations or disputes - it will be even harder to argue with him in person compared to over email or phone . 
  possible solutions :, 
  * have a free day every year , and two free days every four years that are * outside * of the calendar . 
  they are n't a weekday . 
  * slow down the earth . 
  do you remember the exact location and time and the approximate direction you were looking at ? 
  if you enter your location and timezone at http://heavens-above.com/ you can browse the different satellites to see if the time and direction of the flash matches . 
  make sure your location is accurate to a mile or so , not just the nearest city . 
  i would guess that this was an iridium flash . 
  these last a few seconds , but appear much brighter than other satellites , stars , planets or even airplanes at night . 
  syrian dictator al-assad is already an ally of russia , and is already fighting against isis . 
  russia would just offer support to his military . 
  but really , there should be an achievement for being bad enough to get us , europe , turkey , russia , syria , lebanon , saudi arabia , iraq , iran and * fucking al-qaeda * to all team up on you together . 
  `` heroine use '' is something entirely different . 
  the main difference seems to be that lego has been adding a lot of huge sets . 
  i remember wanting that ( or some other similar ) police station when i was a child , it was one of the flashiest sets at my local store . 
  so as new huge sets are added , the `` mid-range '' choice also ends up being much bigger than it used to . 
  compare it to a modern $ 99 police station set : http://shop.lego.com/en-us/police-station-60047, 
  the old police station looks like it has maybe 150 pieces , the new one has 854 . 
  there are already a bunch of locally-installed spam filters available , for example http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/ . 
  in fact , these were very popular before gmail came along and amazed everyone with their spam filtering quality . 
  but they do n't work that great these days . 
  the main issue is that spammers have evolved , and have started randomising everything they can to throw off spam filters . 
  maybe you get an email about viagra , and tell your locally installed filter to block it . 
  but tomorrow you are getting spam about penny stocks , and then password phishing scams , and then whatever .
