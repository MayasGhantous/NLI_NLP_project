  * both the gps and the mobile phone parts require quite a bit of power . 
  not a problem in cars with a large battery and built-in charging . 
  bit in comparison , smart watches need charging every 2-3 days . 
  so before talking about an app , figure out the collar itself . 
  and to make a decision on buying or not buying , i would need to know the up front price , the monthly price for the data service , the weight or bulkiness , and how often it needs to be charged . 
  even if you have the most amazing app in the world , it 's of no use if the collar itself is too heavy for a pet or needs charging weekly . 
   with that said , what 's the most cost-effective ( least fees ) way to convert usd to euro ? 
  get a local bank account, 
  use transferwise to convert + transfer usd in your us bank account to eur in your estonian bank account . 
  any local bank will be fine . 
  most people use seb , swedbank , lhv or nordea . 
  people have their preferences based on whose internet banking ui design they prefer , but really they are 98 % identical for all practical purposes . 
  something that might be a hassle though is that you are an us person . 
  the irs requires all foreign banks to send them lots of paperwork about us citizens and past residents finances . 
  so some european banks refuse to have any customers who have relations to us . 
  lhv is probably one of those , since they have a warning message `` we are closing all usd bank accounts '' in their web ui . 
  if they refresh the macbook air , it 's going to be a retina macbook air . 
  i think the `` triangle '' is mostly due to the loooong gap in various macbook releases . 
  for a while there used to be two classes : air and pro . 
  in 2016 , they released the rmb , but kept selling the older models , which creates the weird triangle . 
  the retina screen is clearly possible at small and light models ( the rmb ) . 
  so the only remaining question is if they can deliver it at a cheaper than the current rmb price . 
  but i do n't see apple being willing to ship a sub-standard screen to provide a `` budget '' model either . 
  so my prediction is that , either :, 
  * there will be no more air . 
  rmb replaces the `` air '' line , or, 
  * a laptop named `` air '' is released , but it is basically a `` rmb late 2016 '' refresh . 
  the forbes website is basically blogspot.com with a famous brand name domain . 
  almost anyone can become a `` contributor '' who writes their own stories there . 
   also , what 's the connection between a company not accepting credit/debit cards and money laundering ? 
  not much really . 
  nearly all companies who do not accept credit/debit do n't do it because the card companies charge a 2-4 % fee . 
  if you pay cash they get all of the payment . 
  yes, 
  that moustache . 
  looks like you won the bet with 42 engines !, 
  the radiation has never been an insurmountable obstacle , just the nasa regulations for allowed radiation are extremely low . 
  nasa limit is 3 % increase in probability of getting cancer later in life , over the entire career of an astronaut . 
  some of their mission plans are calculated to see enough radiation to have a 4-5 % increase in probability of getting cancer later in life , so are `` unacceptably high '' . 
  but spacex and any volunteer astronauts can just decide that a 5 % increase in getting cancer before you die of old age is fine . 
  its ' hand-wavey , but for a reason . 
  spacex can only develop a limited amount of technology with the time , funding and people they have . 
  they have about 5000 employees , at its height the apollo program had 400 000 ( with contractors ) . 
  nasa and other companies can each do some parts up to the mars toilets . 
  my favourite is [ samsung sgr-a1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xte9hpwrdg4 ) : a robot with a machine gun and a grenade launcher . 
  that 's just how serious he is about cyber security .

  nasa has some stereo images from mars : http://mars.nasa.gov/mars3d/, 
  you need one of those red-blue glasses to see them though . 
   give mars a thick , breathable atmosphere . 
  afaik all the plans for near-term ( up to hundreds of years ) plans involve giving it a thick but not breathable atmosphere . 
  the most common step is to melt the polar co2 ice caps , but some have also propsed crashing comets made of water ice into the planet . 
  even though a thick co2 atmosphere would be poisonous to humans , it would have huge advantages over an almost-vacuum atmosphere :, 
  * to go outside , you only need an oxygen mask , not a bulky full body vacuum suit . 
  * habitats do n't need to hold pressure , just be airtight . 
  if they leak , emergency oxygen masks are sufficient . 
  * plants can grow in co2 atmosphere . 
  * thick atmosphere will speed up wind erosion , and grind the sharp-edged sand that breaks everything into more familiar soft sand . 
  * thick atmosphere will capture more sunlight and warm up the planet . 
   edit : fuck you . 
  if you 're going to downvote me then provide a reason . 
  sometimes there 's downvote bots , sometimes it 's a completely different reader downvoting . 
  there 's no reason to think that it was the parent poster who downvoted and get angry at them . 
  couple of days to a week maybe ? 
  but note that even if it `` clears '' and you get $ 10000 in your account , it 's not a yet a 100 % guarantee that the money is yours . 
  your bank will mail the check to the bank where it was written , who will inspect it , etc. 
  if in the end it is found to be invalid or the writing account does n't have enough money in it , your bank will take the money back from your account . 
  this might take 2-4 weeks . 
  sugar does not magically turn into ants . 
  ants wander around from their anthill , sometimes wander into buildings , and if they find sugar , invite other ants to it . 
  an ant is not going to find its way from an anthill to the 20th floor of a concrete building , through staircases and fire doors and everything , and back again . 
  but you could [ order some ants online ] ( https://www.amazon.com/live-ant-farm-ants-shipped/dp/b00gvheqv0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1475447380&amp;sr=8-1 ) if you need some . 
  in some countries such as sweden and norway they are n't : https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2016/apr/11/when-it-comes-to-tax-transparency-norway-leads-the-field, 
  everyone can look up everyone else 's tax return . 
  but they also get to see who looked . 
  as a note : there is n't evidence yet that these extra dimensions exist . 
  there are mathematical models for more dimensions , which sort of work out . 
  but no experiment has yet shown any evidence that they exist and that these mathematical models are realistic . 
  i do n't think this election was ideal , but there was nothing too terrible about it either . 
  the major differences with us are that, 
  * people do n't vote on the president , just the parliament does . 
  * the role of the president is mostly as a `` head diplomat '' , they have very little influence in the day to day government matters . 
  because just 101 parliament members vote on the president , they can and sometimes do decide ahead of time who to select for the position . 
  this year they had a long process of 6 rounds of voting between each political party 's favourite , and still failed to reach a consensus . 
  so they decided to go with a relatively unknown but politically neutral new candidate instead . 
   the public has not had time to voice any sort of opinion, 
  well , technically that does n't matter , the public does n't get a vote . 
  but i agree that it would be more appropriate to have a longer time and more debates , the president is supposed to represent the country , and choosing someone unknown feels weird . 
  what if you use gas for a [ pulse jet engine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibw618geqyi ) immersed in the water ? 
  if you take this to the extreme , then the only device that apple should make and sell is the iphone . 
  it 's by far their best selling device , and smartphones are the most popular `` computer '' type worldwide . 
  a keyboard is a niche requirement these days . 
  but people want different computers for different use cases . 
  they could have a serious pros in the lineup , and still have 2-3 models for people who want less power and thinner and lighter models . 
  trade secrets are already protected by other laws . 
  the surgeon was just an example why non-competes are bad . 
  we should not make exceptions for professions which are in `` public interest '' , but try to find a solution that protects trade secrets but allows people in every profession to move between employers while using their skills and experience . 
  25 % profit margins are very rare though : only seen at monopolies and technology companies ( which often have sort of a user familiarity monopoly , it 's very difficult to change from microsoft word to openoffice ) . 
  most companies end up with 2-10 % profit margins , since any bigger and competitors will try to win over their clients with lower prices .
