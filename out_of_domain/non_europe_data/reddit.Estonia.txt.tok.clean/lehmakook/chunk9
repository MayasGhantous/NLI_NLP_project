  * hate on altcoins , without realising that all of their arguments also apply to bitcoin ,, 
  * run exchanges , `` investment funds '' , wallets and other businesses or just outright scams without actually having any business or computer security experience ,, 
  * promote and speak well of these businesses , despite them being obviously below all real-world standards , just because there are no actually trustworthy businesses in the bitcoin space ,, 
  * present pro-bitcoin arguments that assume that people already own bitcoin , or want to receive bitcoin ,, 
  * come up with entirely idiotic bitcoin use cases , for example the `` let 's put marriage contracts into the blockchain '' ,, 
  * do n't realise that public-key cryptography and hashes existed well before bitcoin , and can be used much more appropriately without a distributed blockchain for various applications ,, 
  * anyone who uses the terms `` fiat '' , `` shill '' and `` sheeple '' . 
  i 'm just not sure there is anyone else left at all . 
  i guess there was this one ex-microsoft guy who actually seemed to be excited and knowledgeable about the technology regardless of whether one bitcoin is valued at $ 400 or $ 0.04 . 
  why take them from the clerk at all if you do n't need them ? 
   `` eesti ajalehtede aasta keskmine tiraa\u017e ( 000 ) estonian newspapers \u00b4 circulation ( 000 ) , average circulation in year '', 
  that 's the print run size in thousands , averaged over the year . 
  so for a daily newspaper it should be the average number of copies printed per day , and for a weekly newspaper the average number of copies printed per week . 
   how should i pay the $ 10 ? 
  sure , pm me your address . 
  payment sent !, 
  very excited for spacex , 
  spacex really should name their test rockets something other than falcon 9 . 
  i do n't think an app would be an useful investment . 
  the main marketing issue is that people do n't know that ph test strips exist , they do n't know that they are for sale , and do n't know why they would ever want any . 
  an app wo n't help with those . 
  making websites is much better , since it can be found with google when people search about their actual problems ( cooking , cosmetics , diets , etc ) , and only later discover that they might want to get some test strips . 
  that would be cool , but i seriously doubt that will ever happen . 
  there is no political will to spend money on human spaceflight in europe . 
  i think there is a good chance that even the ariane rocket family will be retired once spacex proves its reliability and timeliness of launches - it will be very difficult to sell the independent space access capability to the european public if it 's cheaper to buy it from spacex . 
  and coffee . 
  coffee-snobs debate endlessly about the acidity of different brews , and might be interested in getting some numbers . 
  but i do n't think `` ph test strips '' are any of the words they would type into google - the page has to be discoverable with the terms they use . 
  i think that approach can only work when you know * exactly * what the problem is . 
  often in software , the most difficult challenge is figuring out what to build , instead of hacking out the code for the solution . 
  and you really need to talk to other people to see if your ideas about what to build make any sense . 
   you think that 's possible ? 
  that depends on the italians , so no idea unfortunately . 
  i 've had my estonian passport reissued and mailed to an embassy in another eu country , but that took two visits and well over a month . 
  getting a citizenship for the first time may take longer than 90 days i think ? 
   would i still be let through tallinn airport without a visa or anything before i get my passport ? 
  if you enter with your australian passport , you should not need a visa to stay for 90 days as a tourist : http://vm.ee/en/who-does-not-need-visa-visit-estonia, 
  hopefully the italian embassy in tallinn could then process your citizenship request in 90 days ? 
  although it might be faster to go visit rome while in europe and handle paperwork there . 
  all the local embassy would be doing is taking your documents , mailing them to italy , and waiting for a response . 
  if you go to some place in italy , perhaps you can explain things in person or correct missing info much faster . 
  the working holiday visa should last up to 1 year , so that should give you plenty of time to get the italian citizenship and a permanent pass to live and work anywhere in the eu . 
  but i ca n't find any info on it in english , so perhaps email or call the consulate : http://www.sydney.vm.ee/consulate, 
  the article says that, 
   the ula/blue origin agreement allows for a four-year development process with full-scale testing in 2016 and first flight in 2019 . 
  which is way too late for commercial crew . 
  nasa requirements call for first human flights already in 2017 . 
  they are changing the propellant ( new tank proportions ) , and adding 26 % of thrust ( so it makes sense to make the tanks 26 % bigger ) - it 's effectively going to be a new rocket . 
  making the walls sturdier does n't seem like a big change compared to those . 
  this article seems like mostly journalist-invented conflict drama to me . 
  sure , ula would like to keep things just the way they are and keep raking in that sweet government cost-plus money . 
  but `` staunch rivarly '' and `` war '' between musk and bezos ? 
  or corporations that can feel `` embarrassed '' ? 
  without a direct quote on these , that seems just journalists ' imagination . 
   and it does n't help he has such a strong foreign accent . 
  it diminishes ` the return of american leadership in space '' concept . 
  uh , the `` americal leadership in space '' is entirely based on german accents ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wernher_von_braun, 
  the main crazy point of the bearwhale theory is that there is someone out there who is selling bitcoin with the goal of keeping the price slowly falling over many months . 
  and they are somehow supposed to eventually benefit from this `` price manipulation '' . 
  if miners , past holders and owners of stolen coins want to sell , then waiting a bit for buy orders to appear , but not too long for the price to go down further makes sense . 
  but they are n't the mythical bearwhale manipulator ^ tm , because their motivation is to get cash now instead of somehow benefit from falling prices . 
  just one table ? 
  better get a million random numbers in case you run out . 
  another suggestion : please link any dates with a specific time to http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/ for the non-us fans of spacex !, 
  or at least please also provide the utc time , converting from the many different us timezones is confusing . 
  check out the original thread at http://www.reddit.com/r/buttcoin/comments/2adssm/buttcoin_foundation_rocked_as_founder_exposed_to/ to understand the context . 
  buttcoin.org was just a fun hobby site . 
  the original author was offered almost $ 30k by someone , and that someone later turned out to be bfl . 
  in these emails , the buyer explains to the original owner how `` we want to add advertisers like bfl , and therefore should tone down the criticism '' . 
  because they did n't want to say `` i 'm from bfl and i 'm going to delete the posts to make us look better '' outright . 
  no actual advertisers or business plans exist . 
  the problem with cleanup is that to go and get one piece of junk , you have to match orbits with it and slow it down . 
  after which your cleanup craft is also about to re-enter , and has to then burn even more fuel to speed up again to stay in space . 
  effectively cleaning up each piece of junk would need a single-use cleanup craft and rocket launch as big and expensive as the satellite itself . 
  the best solution would be to reach a worldwide agreement that all satellites must have fuel reserved for deorbiting itself after the mission is over . 
  that already is the case with some geo satellites , but satellite owners are a bit reluctant because the same fuel could be used for extending the profitable lifetime of the satellite . 
  while i agree that spacex should and eventually most likely will launch other companies ' spacecraft , it seems that they are just too busy to get started with that right now . 
  integrating dream chaser onto the falcon 9 and managing the launches would be a lot more work than putting a standard satellite in a standard fairing for their already way overworked engineers . 
  and it seems that they would prioritise work on dragon 2 , falcon heavy and proper reusability in the next few years instead . 
  i do n't think they would refuse out of principle , but i could see them refusing because they just do n't have the free time for it . 
  they already have a launch backlog of tens of missions , they are busy building dragon 2 , falcon heavy and getting reusability to work . 
  and their engineers are infamously overworked . 
  there does n't seem to be a reason to spend the extra engineering effort on integrating dream chaser onto the falcon 9 if all they would get in return is the standard launch price . 
  the patch might not be enough . 
  try the new exploit versions as well : http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2hehiz/cve20147169_bash_fix_incomplete_still_exploitable/, 
  the national library has a digital archive with many of the `` classic literature '' books , very old books , and government documents available in epub or pdf format : http://www.digar.ee/arhiiv/et/raamatud, 
  perhaps someone can suggest a good reading list ? 
  there also seem to be some ebooks available from torrents : https://kickass.to/usearch/eesti%20category:books/ but these are very bizarre collections . 
  the best in there seem to be estonian translations of popular foreign books ( lotr , sherlock holmes , etc ) , not sure why boat-building instructions and a handbook on mushrooms is included . 
  for news , the best options are :, 
  * the national broadcaster , http://err.ee/ ( also in english at http://news.err.ee/ ), 
  * the largest newspaper , quality ranges from reasonable news to popstar bs , http://www.postimees.ee/, 
  * the largest online news portal , quality is somewhat shit , http://www.delfi.ee/ . 
  but sub-brands that are actual published newspapers , http://epl.delfi.ee/ and http://ekspress.delfi.ee/ tend to be ok . 
  please avoid reading any of the ( anonymous ) online comments at the news sites , they are full of angry stupid people spewing complete shit - the comment sections are often referred to as a `` public toilet wall '' for a reason . 
  for finding people to talk to , / r/eesti is more popular than / r/askanestonian . 
  there are also a few big online forums on specific topics ( computers , cars , etc ) - what are your interests ? 
  looking more closely at these book torrents , i would avoid them . 
  the only estonian originals in there seem to be either crazy conspiracy theories , completely unknown authors or some bizarre handbook . 
  the national library collection is a much better source .
