  looks like it 's a 36-character alphabet , so the chance to generate the code is 1 / ( 36 ^ 4 ) = 1/1679616, 
  edit : lol i 'm dumb, 
  excellent observation . 
  i 've always thought it was just given to the next born waterbender . 
  i made a script that sends head requests ( should be faster ) and checks for random codes . 
  import httplib , sys, 
  from random import choice, 
  # boilerplate, 
  url = '' / videos/clip/the-legend-of - korra-219-full-episode - { 0 } . html '', 
  # infinite loop, 
  while 1 :, 
  # generate random 4-digit code using the alphabet ( list comprehension ), 
  code = '' '' . join ( [ choice ( alphabet ) for i in range ( 4 ) ] ), 
  # establish connection with nick.com, 
  connection = httplib.httpconnection ( `` www.nick.com '' ), 
  # send a head request to the connection + url variable + code, 
  connection.request ( `` head '' , url.format ( code ) ), 
  # head can be used because only need to check whether it is 404 or not, 
  response = connection.getresponse ( ), 
  # check wether the response is not a 404, 
  if response.status ! = 404 :, 
  # if it 's not a 404 , print out the code and stop the program, 
  else :, 
  # if it 's a 404 , just print out the code with a nope, 
  repetition is n't a big enough issue to waste so much memory and power . 
  also , this has little to do with your computer power . 
  it 's nick.com 's reponse that takes up most of the time . 
  that 's kind of what i was hoping the next avatar series to be . 
  some poor earthbender living in the slums , a sandbender in the desert or something like that . 
  the boulder takes issue with your misplaced apostrophe . 
  there are still 60 minutes in a 24-hour clock . 
  it would be nice if people did n't associate us with the slavic people either . 
  i do a lot of things but i 'm not good at any of them . 
  so why do we need to send humans to mars ? 
  what can they do that rovers ca n't ? 
  i have to admit , i was really confused but i goddit . 
  nope , i heard the news . 
  but a man can dream . 
  did that site really just make me enable javascript in order to view a screenshot ? 
  imagine controlling this guy with qwop . 
  please use youtube links . 
  nobody outside of the us can see nick.com videos . 
  to be fair , korra thought she was fine too .

  let me guess , estonia is ethnically diverse because 25 % of its population is russian . 
  i 'm not going to use a vpn to access a video stream ... 
  it 's a silly hack to a problem that should n't exist in the first place . 
  it means it should n't be solved in the wrong way . 
  the right way is removing regional restrictions in the first place . 
  then you could reupload it to a site that is less comparable to hell on earth before resorting to a [ vpn ] ( https://i.imgur.com/uwynuni.png ) . 
  yes . 
  no one ? 
  also , there are better ways of web ripping than screen recording . 
  double also , stop acting like a pretentious cunt . 
  i never implied that this was done for me . 
  and it 's against the rules to talk about things like that here . 
  dunder milfflin though, 
  wender ? 
  who 'd a thunk that one of them would end up becoming the main villain of book 4 ? 
  i hope they animate the comic books at least . 
  i just did n't get a similar experience from reading them . 
  try a search engine, 
  i really like that you made that reference . 
  oh , nobody 's father , who art nowhere , i know you ca n't hear me , completely ignore this prayer . 
  nothing art though and nothing will ever be . 
  jesus was just a man . 
  a man . 
  wow , i 'm shocked :d, 
  you get benefits with gold ?? 
  barney !, 
  the red lotus because they actually have a logical reason for being villains , other than just being evil , sociopathic or power hungry . 
  thank god . 
  usually , the word `` movie '' is n't welcome around here . 
  it should continue like [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/0xvilo5.jpg ) though . 
  can you make long-hair-beard zaheer ? 
  you can always read the [ wiki ] ( http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/avatar#known_avatars ) . 
  i 'm guessing more old people did the test this year ? 
  someone taking a photo of their easy test would n't seem suspicious at all ? 
  lots of random kitkat posts on / r/mildlyinteresting . 
  either kitkat likes to leave easter egg bars or it 's just / r/hailcorporate at work . 
  ( seven ), 
  i downvote everyone who uses / s , no matter how much i agree with them . 
  toph can also hear . 
  i 'm pretty sure kuvira 's armour would would be clanking around .

  pls no, 
  why would they ?
