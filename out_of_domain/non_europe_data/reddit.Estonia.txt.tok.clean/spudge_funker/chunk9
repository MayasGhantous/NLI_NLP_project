  i like that mug, 
  i too repeat memes for emphasis . 
  is there a subtumblr for reddit ? 
  inb4 the person holding the water gun is jennifer lawrence, 
  imgur should make a scratch-off-type mode for nsfw images . 
  it 's similar to the one in san andreas . 
  i just have an f-91w , so i suppose my time is worthless .

  that 's definitely not a french kiss . 
  they 've been working on the script for years , apparently . 
  i can only assume that it 's going to be as good as , if not better than the rt shorts , which i loved , and that 's good enough for me . 
  lol dumbass, 
  two drums and a cymbal get thrown into a lake . 
  i want the english name for estonia to be renamed to estland . 
  i do not want to change the flag , especially to symbolise a religion . 
  i want people to realise that estonia , along with latvia and lithuania , is a northern european country . 
  it is estland in almost every other european language . 
  seems like it 's randomly estonia in english . 
  also , i 'm not a big fan of the - ia suffix in general . 
  i do n't think it suits our country . 
  spanking the salami,

  i have a lazy eye as well and 3d movies have n't worked for me either . 
  what did work , however , was [ google cardboard ] ( https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/ ) . 
  i bought one for less than $ 3 on ebay and it 's a fantastic experience . 
  it has lenses that are as big as your eyes and it makes both of your eyes individually look straight . 
  it actually takes a few seconds for your eyes to adjust when you put it on . 
  for $ 3 , you should definitely give it a go , granted that you already have a smartphone with a big screen . 
  that place looks surprisingly clean !, 
  i was in a mcdonalds in hungary a few years back where you could get refills . 
  history books,

  i 'm surprised other countries do n't do this . 
  it 's really hard to see people in the dark when driving . 
  i 'm very done with this site . 
  there 's a dick joke in here somewhere but i ca n't seem to find it . 
  do we get a pair of complementary ice skates ? 
  never realised the reichstag was so beautiful . 
  i can just imagine two dying people having this conversation lying around this tile . 
  it does sound like something millie would say though . 
  ocktv is awful . 
  i dare you to watch any video on their channel and not cringe . 
  if that 's a moose , i do n't want to see what your rots look like . 
  retweet, 
  the second one is really good !, 
  i do n't know how true it is , but i 'll take its word for it !,
