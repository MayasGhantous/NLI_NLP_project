autism is tough , is n't it ? 
  sadly all this is an emulation bug . 
  does n't work on vc . 
  use mupen64 . 
  you really do n't need a webcam . 
  the game is always more important than the webcam . 
  it can be distracting in most cases . 
  it exists in estonian too ( and finnish i think ), 
  german spoken in hannover is the closest to standard german . 
  french spoken in tours is the closest to standard french . 
  if the `` centre of the french language '' was in paris , the standard language would be based on parisian french . 
  ( which it is not ), 
  why was this downvoted ... ? 
  there 's nothing wrong with this comment ... 
  you can not have a word before a % , it has to be a number between 1-100 , as the name `` per cent '' implies . 
  well , besides the speedrun category `` any % '' of course . 
  zeldaspeedruns.com is a great resource for learning the tricks , and it also has routes for some categories . 
  tokyoboi also has tutorials for any % and mst , but not sure how up-to-date those are . 
  for beginner categories to run , i would suggest any % , no im/ww and no ww . 
  in terms of the platform you 're running on , it does n't matter that much , but there are a few categories were the fastest route only works on 1.0 n64 , but there are routes for other versions aswell . 
  namely ganonless and 100 % . 
  jp n64 1.0 / 1.1 ( not sure which one ) is fastest for : 100 % , ganonless , there is also a route for no im/ww which is very close to the vc route , all dungeons, 
  jp wii vc is fastest for : mst , any % , no im/ww, 
  ique is fastest for : low % ( former any % w / no sword ) , no ww ( pretty sure ) , glitchless/bug limit ( since it has a lot of cutscenes and never savewarps ), 
  however , what the fastest category is really does n't matter . 
  just run on whatever you have . 
  1.0 / 1.1 categories have 1.2 routes . 
  run your favourite game . 
  a game that you can play for hours without getting tired of it . 
  if there are no speedruns of it , route it yourself . 
  you will burn out easily playing a game you do n't like/don ' t enjoy/don ' t know, 
  is this low % ? 
  tf2 upgrade to premium , $ 4,99, 
  have played it since early 2012 , and getting bullied since i 'm a f2p whenever i 'm on a non-valve server is n't fun :d, 
  mgs 628, 
  my windows 95 pan-european edition cd ( if that counts :d ), 
  no preference on what game . 
  these probably should n't be included , since only very old people speak them . 
  also , livonian is near-extinct , something like less than 10 people speak it natively iirc . 
  would disagree also . 
  `` impeerium '' is sometimes used for `` empire '' instead of `` keisririik '' but i 've never heard someone say `` imperaator '' . 
  i count 9 lol, 
  gratz on the record , 
  it does n't say that anywhere in that link . 
  the ainu are still mongoloids , but they have unique features to the japanese that live near them . 
  they are very hairy , much like white people . 
  related , estonian also wrote all the / v / sounds as `` w '' before 1918 , due to german influence . 
  pretty sure it is . 
  we have both `` susi '' and `` hunt '' as words , and i find it very odd that 2 cognates that are synonyms came from the same word directly . 
  `` hunt '' coming from german `` hund '' and `` susi '' coming from pre-finnic `` sunti '' seems much more likely tbh . 
  in estonian , when toasting , `` proosit '' is more common than `` terviseks '', 
  it ultimately comes from latin `` prosit '' , but likely through low german, 
  it is possible that other ugric languages do use that root , but they are n't marked on this map . 
  bravo !, 
  cosmo 's 18:10 was on ique . 
  if i remember correctly ique record is joden 's 18:07 . 
  swordless route is also called low %, 
  small correction : the teutonic order only a took a minor part of lithuania ( the coast ) , they mainly fought in modern day estonia and latvia . 
  there were no `` tiny feudal kingdoms '' , most of them were duchies , principalities , bishoprics , counties etc, 
  for linguists ? 
  maybe, 
  for everyone else ? 
  definetely not, 
  have n't used any addons . 
  i have the 300 cursor achievment , do n't have 200 tm , 200 ac and 150 + prism achievments . 
  hc 's have went from ~ 650 -  5079 -  23759, 
  is that optimal or am i doing something wrong ? 
  every reset has been at around 500-600 hours of playtime . 
  how many hcs do you have ? 
  i use windows 7 , and i used windows keyboard layout creator to have ipa symbols and other letters on my keyboard . 
  the previous record was n't all that unbeatable . 
  a godrun with old strats would have been sub 5 . 
  with the current strats , sub 5 is much more realistic , and this run would 've gotten it if it had not failed the fish in a barrel dupe . 
  for estonian :, 
  ait\u00e4h - from `` aita jumal '' - `` help , god '' , more shortened version of `` ait\u00fcma '' , also much more commonly used . 
  `` jumal '' is of either fenno-permic origin or a loan from proto indo-iranian * diyumna . 
  compare sanskrit dyum\u0101n ( heavenly , shiny ) . 
  `` aitama '' seems to be from proto indo-iranian * avas -, 
  t\u00e4nan - of finnic origin . 
  a loan from proto-germanic * \u00feen\u03c7w\u014d - is also possible but unlikely . 
  compare gothic \u00feeihv\u014d ( lightning ), 
  do you mean southern bessarabia ? 
  i actually looked it up from the estonian etymological dictionary and it 's true . 
  it gives the etymology for `` hunt '' as either being a loan from low german `` hunt '' or an older loan , from proto-germanic * \u03c7unda -, 
  however , the entry for `` susi '' ; http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=susi, 
  lists it 's etymology as possibly an older ie loan from proto-germanic or proto-baltic * \u1e31u\u032fn\u0325t\u00f3 , compare latvian `` suntene '' - `` big dog '', 
  the estonian word is identical to the finnish one . 
  the etymology is uncertain but it is of finno-ugric origin . 
  this is basic school biology , but still , an interesting fact . 
  the ethnic group is sometimes called `` madjarid '' so you could technically coin something like `` madjarimaa '' for the country . 
  too busy having a siesta , 
  i know that feel . 
  what made me get over my inferiority complex was just not caring about other people and socialising the least . 
  100 % teetotaller btw . 
  even if you have no body odor , you really should shower after pe . 
  i 've only created 1 conlang . 
  i took the vocabulary from various sources , mainly latin and lithuanian , but also russian , german , english , romanian , estonian ( my native tongue ) , and changed it around a bit . 
  i attempted to change them somewhat regularly ( / o / into / u / f.e was a common theme ) though . 
  in making the grammar , i did n't take any direct inspiration but it is very ie-like , highly fusional . 
  looking through my word-list , i ca n't find any roots that are completely made up .
