  `` solicit '' ) - to worry, 
  `` limb '' ) - spit , tongue , language, 
  only 1 . 
  i 've worked on 2-3 other projects , but they are n't nearly as fleshed out as my main one , and you ca n't communicate without any problems . 
  the main set in nominative :, 
  | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person, 
  * also the formal singular 2nd person pronoun, 
  other pronouns :, 
  3rd person singular feminine - ** ja **, 
  3rd person singular neuter animate - ** je **, 
  3rd person singular neuter inanimate - ** ox **, 
  3rd person singular indefinite ( in english - `` one '' ) - ** \u00fan **, 
  2nd person singular semi-formal - ** vu **, 
  2nd person singular extremely-formal ( historically for nobles , now only in literature ) - ** domnyvostru **, 
  dialectal 1st person plural inclusive ( used rarely , lit . 
  `` us all '' ) - ** nos-tut **, 
  every pronoun declends in 6 cases : ** nominative ** , ** accusative ** , ** genitive ** , ** locative ** , ** dative ** and ** vocative **, 
  there are also reflexive forms for all of them . 
  `` ja '' , `` je '' , '' \u00fan '' , `` ego '' , `` nos '' , `` noster '' have - met suffixed to them in the reflexive forms , and the rest have - ps suffixed . 
  * see [ 1st person singular present perfect ] future [ accusative ] . 
  it no-include [ 3rd person singular present ] you [ accusative ] *, 
  a few questions :, 
  1 ) how are `` catra '' and `` cinta '' pronounced ? 
  especially interested in that `` c '', 
  2 ) what is the ordinal number for 1 ? 
  ( in english : `` first '' ) , and what are the differences in using `` una '' and `` prima '' ? 
  yes , that is exactly the case in romance languages , but i 'd like to know what op meant with the slashes , since only 0,1,8 and 10 have them . 
  * doubt [ 1st person singular present ] , therefore think [ 1st person singular present ] , therefore be [ 1st person singular present ] *, 
  note about some romlang things : i 've no cognate for latin `` cogito '' . 
  the `` u '' in latin `` sum '' was unrounded , unnasalised and fronted to / i / , also lowered to / e / in many dialects , so both `` sim '' and `` sem '' are correct . 
  same thing with latin `` cum '' - * kum -  kim < -  kem, 
  thanks  is there any difference in the style of use or are they the same ? 
  * thank [ 3rd person singular present subjunctive ] god [ accusative ] that be [ 3rd person singular present ] friday * ( fossilised form from the genitive of `` jupiter '' ( iuppiter ) in latin , in terms of the days of the week , the meanings have changed and only 2 from latin remain : `` dies iovis '' was thursday in latin , but is friday in my conlang . 
  `` dies saturni '' is still saturday though . 
  the rest are n't of latin origin ), 
  yep . 
  the unmarked case is vocative . 
  it is the least used case aswell . 
  the vocative is also somewhat irregular since it is marked with the - e suffix in some words . 
  examples :, 
  ** k\u00e1nas ** - nominative * dog *, 
  ** k\u00e1n ** - vocative, 
  this is the ipa - the international phonetic alphabet . 
  [ d\u0292 ] is the `` j '' in `` jump '' , and [ \u0292 ] is the `` g '' in `` mirage '' . 
  [ x ] is a sound that does n't exist in english natively , but in the word `` loch '' , or german `` bach '' ( technically not , but it 's similar ) . 
  [ j ] is the `` y '' in `` yes '' . 
  most english people pronounce it with [ h ] , but the original spanish does pronounce it with [ x ] . 
  so the noun does n't change with numerals ? 
  interesting . 
  are toko - / sun only for humans or all animate things ? 
  i forgot about that , that 's a good idea . 
  i do n't know about russian , but in estonian , it is the same as with plural , the noun is in partitive singular - ** 0 kassi **, 
  thanks , that 's pretty cool . 
  yes . 
  it is the same as polish/czech `` ch '' and russian '' \u0445 '' . 
  very simple genitive case , represented with the - an suffix in majority of words :, 
  `` my father 's other brother '' :, 
  * i [ genitive ] father [ genitive ] other brother *, 
  the order is free , so `` antrus br\u00e1tas pateran myn '' is correct . 
  putting the possessor first stresses the possessor and vice versa . 
  ( my father vs my father ), 
  there are no special possessive forms of pronouns like in latin . 
  from the anglo pronounciation : ** kriscinas ** / ` kristsinas /, 
  something more fitting , in regards to the location of my language in my conworld : ** kristianas ** / ` kristjanas /, 
  interesting . 
  i translated it to my conlang , and the first 4 lines rhyme easily , because the first 2 lines both have an imperative , and the next two lines both have 2 items listed . 
  the last line does n't rhyme though . 
  * weapon [ accusative plural ] you [ genitive ] no-surrender [ 2nd person singular present imperative ] *, 
  * fight [ gerund accusative ] continue [ 2nd person singular present imperative ] *, 
  * until death [ locative ] destruction [ locative ] - and ( - k\u00e9 is an enclitic for `` and '' ) *, 
  * through fire [ locative ] danger [ locative ] - and *, 
  * no-be [ 3rd person singular future ] weapon [ genitive plural ] surrender [ gerund accusative ] *, 
  you use the imperative or subjunctive moods , or something else . 
  the imperative is usually used for orders or very certain statements ( not asking the other 's opinion ) , and the subjunctive is used for possibility , wish and discussing the action . 
  let 's eat ( when the conversation is between 2 people ) : ** jestea ** - eat [ 1st person dual imperative present ], 
  we should eat/shall we eat ? 
  ) ** - eat [ 1st person dual subjunctive present ], 
  we should eat maybe ? 
  ( a very uncertain statement , putting the question up for discussion ) : ** jestenaintaut ( ? 
  ) ** - eat [ 1st person dual subjunctive present ] + the - aut enclitic , which marks uncertain statements . 
  we should eat maybe ? 
  ( an alternate way to form the same thing as above ) : ** r\u00e1s be ` jestika ( ? 
  ) ** - maybe eat [ 1st person dual conditional present/future ], 
  something just for fun : ** exejestenaintaut ? 
  ** , which translates to something like `` let 's eat it completely outside maybe , or what ? '', 
  * not one man no-be [ 3rd person singular present ] born [ present participle , this forms the passive ] as evil [ dative ] *, 
  this is 14,8 \u2030 by the way . 
  blood alcohol level in percent does n't tell me ( personally ) anything . 
  being legally drunk is around 0,20 \u2030 . 
  the vowels and diphthongs seem fine to me . 
  `` ei '' , `` ai '' , `` oi '' might be a bit better though . 
  i would suggest seperating the voiced and voiceless dental fricatives ; `` dh '' and `` th '' if you want digraphs , and '' \u00f0 '' and '' \u00fe '' if not . 
  why two different ways of representing / k / ? 
  is there an etymological reason behind this ? 
  did / \u028a : / come from / o : / * ? 
  if not , i would suggest `` uu '' or `` ue '' for this . 
  \u0175 is a very rarely used letter . 
  i would suggest `` hw '' or `` wh '' as digraphs or something else . 
  `` myyk '' for v\u00f5ro is technically outdated ortography . 
  it should be `` m\u00f5\u00f5k '' , but i 'm not an expert on the subject .
