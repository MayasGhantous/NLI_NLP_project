  also , my dictionary gives gothic `` m\u0113ki '' for `` a sword you can point/aim '' , but this is is a small difference , nothing big . 
  the old icelandic word was `` m\u00e6kir '' . 
  what is `` ugaun '' ? 
  latvian for `` estonia '' is `` igaunija '' , derived from `` ugandi '' , the southeastern ancient estonian county, 
  and as someone else already said , finnish has `` viro '' , which is derived from `` virumaa '' , the northeastern ancient ( and modern ) estonian county . 
  worth noting : estonia had a diet in the 15th century and from 1917-1919 , in the form of `` maap\u00e4ev '' , which translates to `` land day '' ( the swedish `` riksdag '' and imperial diets are called `` riigip\u00e4ev '' , which translates to `` state day '' ), 
  it also existed from the 16th century onwards until ww1 as the self-governing body of estonia , latvia and curonia . 
  short :, 
  / \u00e4 e i u \u0268 /, 
  long :, 
  / \u00e4 : e : i : u : o : /, 
  the spoken/lower-class language also has / \u0250 \u0259 \u028a \u0258 / as reduced vowels , and nasal vowels before nasal consonants . 
  * thoughts you [ genitive singular ] no-interest [ 3rd person plural present ] i [ accusative ] same-much as they [ genitive ] absence **, 
  an alternate , more lower class/common pronounciation :, 
  longest verb :, 
  `` how have you two not exterminated completely above , or whatever ? '' '', 
  `` and in the liberators , i think '', 
  longest adjective :, 
  `` the most liberator-y '' [ accusative case ], 
  definitely not bad . 
  you could also have 2 or more standards for pronounciation , e.g upper class/lower class or various dialects , but the orthography would be the same . 
  as a native speaker , i think this is correct . 
  an example : the word `` p\u00fcha '' , meaning `` holy '' is pronounced / ` pyh\u0251 / by most people , but is / ` py\u0251\u032f / in my dialect , since / h / is very weak and is almost always dropped at the beginning of words and often in the middle of words . 
  the wikipedia chart does n't give / \u00e6\u0251\u032f / as a possible diphthong , but it occurs in my dialect : `` n\u00e4ha '' / ` n\u00e6h\u0251 / -  / ` n\u00e6\u0251\u032f /, 
  this may be pedantic , but where do you get the name `` ugaun '' from ? 
  it has many names , but `` ugaun '' is not one of them . 
  what is the source of it meaning `` lively '' ? 
  my source gives the origin as old east slavic ( i think , it says `` muinasvene keel '' which translates to `` ancient russian language '' ) * ug , meaning `` south , southern land , southern wind '' . 
  compare `` yugoslavia '' and russian \u044e\u0433 ( jug ), 
  agriculture arrived to estonia after around ~ 4000 bc , but it was of low importance compared to hunting-gathering . 
  at around 3200-3100 bc the importance of agriculture and animal husbandry rose highly , likely due to indo-european influence . 
  from this map you can deduce that agriculture did not come from the south , however i ca n't find anything on the direction whence agriculture came . 
  yes , latvian derived `` igaunija '' from the estonian county called `` ugandi '' in estonian . 
  it is n't called `` ugaun '' in any language i can find . 
  do you have a source for it being finno-ugric ? 
  that seems to be one the theories , yes . 
  but naming it after ugandi seems more logical to me , since that 's what the latvians would 've had contact with the most . 
  informal :, 
  * all\u00f3 / al ` lo : / - also used as a telephone greeting, 
  * labas / ` labas / - just the casual all-round `` hello '', 
  * laburansas / labu ` ransas / - good morning , but can also be used when it 's not morning, 
  semi-formal/intermediate :, 
  * salve / ` salve / - more formal version of `` hello '' , compare english `` hi '' vs `` hello '' , it 's somewhat similar, 
  * orensam / u ` rensam / - shortened version of `` good morning '', 
  * d\u00e9nam / ` de : nam / - shortened version of `` good day '', 
  * veskaram / ves ` karam / - shortened version of `` good evening '', 
  * naktam / ` naktam / - shortened version of `` good night '', 
  * popietam / pupi'etam / - shortened version of `` good afternoon '', 
  formal :, 
  * salve / ` salve / - this can be both formal and semi-formal, 
  * g\u00fatim orensam / ` gu : tim u ` rensam / - long version of the previously mentioned phrase , same with all of them, 
  `` i guard '' , derived from the word for `` safe '' , but unlike in latvian/lithuanian , this is strictly formal . 
  hard to say . 
  a lot of the vocabulary is lithuanian , but a large portion is from latin . 
  the grammar is broadly indo-european , but it is too regular compared to natlangs - only 1 declension class in the common gender and 4 in neuter , and neuter is far smaller than the common gender in terms of number of nouns . 
  verbs have 2 conjugation classes but they differ only in the present simple tense . 
  `` to be '' is the only irregular verb , besides some very small irregularities . 
  it 's too late now to change anything major i think , i 've just got too many words . 
  also a somewhat big corpus , which is somewhat useful , since the older texts are interesting to look at since they feature different features or mistakes ( me not understanding the base text correctly ), 
   a\u00e2l\u00e4 / a\u0251l\u0251\u02d0 /, 
  interesting orthography . 
  how are other long vowels marked ? 
  does he have strabismus ? 
  i 'll answer as somebody outside the anglosphere :, 
  1 ) i first heard about them through the mandela effect itself . 
  2 ) n/a, 
  3 ) n/a, 
  4 ) it 's `` sex in the city '' off the top of my head, 
  5 ) never watched star wars . 
  however i do remember the line from various sources as starting with `` luke , '' and not `` no ! '', 
  i remember there being 2 types of deserts : cold deserts , and hot deserts . 
  does this division not exist in english ? 
  1988 it seems , except for that weird border in siberia . 
  most of european russia and the far east are temperate forests , a lot of the south is steppe/desert . 
  i 've only done this with european countries and a few others, 
  an example : albania, 
   the country : ** albania ** / al ` bania /, 
   the person : ** albanikas ** / al ` banikas /, 
   the language ( same as the adjective in informal speech ) : ** albanis lingas ** / al ` banis ` li\u014bas /, 
  in short : person : - ( a ) nikas , adjective : - is . 
  suffixes such as - sem , meaning `` land '' are removed . 
  e.g : wales is ** `` kymresem '' ** , but a welsh person is ** `` kymrenikas '' **, 
  the name for the country itself can be descended from latin , or something else due to historical reasons . 
  e.g one of the names for `` sweden '' is ** `` gotsem '' ** , meaning `` land of the goths '' . 
  if the native word or the most common exonym use non-native phonemes , they are changed . 
  e.g `` fiji '' is ** `` viti '' ** , since there is no / d\u0292 / . 
  i chose the native form ( it is `` viti '' in fijian ) over / ` fiji / or something else . 
  if possible , names are translated . 
  e.g one of the names for the netherlands is ** `` brevessiemei '' ** , which translates to `` lowlands '' . 
  the united states are ** `` junktais st\u00e1tei '' ** , which translates to `` united ( connected ) states '', 
  interesting . 
  is this is in any specific branch ? 
  are there any ie languages where the descendant of * k\u02b7etw\u00f3res starts with / q / ? 
  is that some uralic influence i see ? 
  \u00dck\u00e9 , za , co and siba seem familiar . 
  the proto-uralic roots would respectively be * \u00fckte , * kakta , * kutte and * \u015b\u00e4j\u0107em . 
  * k\u02b7etw\u00f3res is the pie root for the number 4 , and your 's obviously is descended from this . 
  but the / q / at the beginning is odd . 
  how would '' \u00fck\u00e9 '' be pronounced , by the way ? 
  a piece of the wikipedia article about karl ix of sweden , although i translated it very early so much of the text is very dated .
