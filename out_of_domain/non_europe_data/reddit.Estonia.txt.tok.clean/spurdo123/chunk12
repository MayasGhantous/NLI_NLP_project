  there are also words in there that are not in my list of words , because i did n't remember to add them . 
  here 's a sample text , compared to the modern form :, 
  original :, 
  \u00edtiu rebellias . 
  modern ( bad choice of words ), 
  \u00edta rebelliam . 
  modern ( correct choise of words ), 
  literal translation :, 
  * on the final years of his reign he changed psychologically ( i 'm not actually sure ) unstable and johan and karl started a rebellion against him *, 
  a lot of the differences are me learning more about grammar in general , and how everything comes together . 
  using svo for all . 
  ** \u00cd apaklamorial jam ** ( this could also mean : `` he made her happy '' ), 
  ** n\u00e9 \u00ed paklamorial jam ** - i might not understand this correctly, 
  ** \u00cd n'apaklamorial jam ** ( also could mean : `` he did n't make her happy '' ), 
  the main verb is `` klamorius '' / kla ` muorius / meaning `` to cry '' . 
  the prefix pa - indicates `` making sb . 
  cry '' . 
  the prefix a - forms antonyms . 
  negativity is almost always done with the n ( e ) - prefix prefixed to the verb . 
  the subjunctive mood . 
  e.g `` may he live a long life '' - `` v\u00edtent longim vitam '', 
  epistemic :, 
  the verb `` galius '' , which also has the meaning of `` can '' , `` be able to '' . 
  e.g `` he may live a long life '' ( but i 'm not sure ) - `` galetaut v\u00edtius longim vitam '', 
  the optional definite article `` la '' , that inflects for number ( 3 ) , gender ( 2 ) , and case ( 6 ) . 
  it is often just contracted to l' . 
  the noun inflects differently aswell . 
  example :, 
   ** m\u00fanas ** `` man '', 
   ** l'm\u00fans ** or ** la m\u00fans ** `` the man '', 
  most dialects do n't have this though . 
  in terms of upper class speakers , the pronounciation is more conservative . 
  original / ke / , / ki / and various consonant clusters are preserved . 
  no vowel reduction etc. 
  in terms of grammar , upper class speakers use enclitics much more . 
  only 1 is used in many dialects and lower-class speech . 
  a few examples :, 
  most dialects would say ** `` ego et ja '' ** . 
  the - k\u00e9 enclitic indicates the word `` and '' . 
  '' ** - * `` can you help me ? '' * . 
  this one is actually quite widespread . 
  the - n\u00e9 enclitic forms general questions . 
  many dialects however only mark forming questions with intonation and tone ( this is considered correct in the standard language aswell ), 
  upper class speakers also use the subjunctive much more , and the distinction between imperative present and imperative future is still there . 
  another thing that distinguishes lower-class speech from upper-class speech is contractions . 
  the most advanced form of this being pseudo-possessive suffixes . 
  an example :, 
  the standard form in the standard language and upper-class dialects . 
  `` myn d\u00famas '' is pretty much the same thing aswell . 
  ** d\u00fama 'm \u00ee ** - * my house * . 
  the '' \u00ee '' represents a schwa derived from u , y or i. 
  the standard language has no schwas . 
  this construction is more common than the former in many dialects . 
  i actually wrote down most of my grammar and vocabulary with the upper class/posh dialect/pronounciation in mind , but converting a text to a lower-class dialect is quite easy . 
  / j / , like the `` y '' in `` yes '' . 
  technically ? 
  a lot of influence from other languages aswell . 
  although most of the pronouns and some very simple verbs are all of latin origin . 
  in short ; a posteriori where a large part is of latin origin . 
  most of my verb morphology is independently created though ( some minor influence from russian , e.g - l is one of the suffixes for past tense ) . 
  * if want [ 1st person plural present ] that survive [ 1st person plural present/future conditonal ] , be [ 3rd person singular future ] necessary use [ infinitive ] every [ accusative ] tool [ accusative ] who/which be [ 3rd person singular present ] on hand [ locative dual ] . 
  especially ( word that emphasises the subject ) disgusting [ plural ] *, 
  how did you derive the suffixes for accusative and nominative ? 
  i would expect the nasal ending to be of accusative . 
  most latin declension classes have a nasal ending for the accusative . 
  i 'm not a professional whatsoever , but i 've translated a lot of songs into my conlang . 
  my most recent being `` maybe '' by the ink spots , and you can sing it really well . 
  other songs , e.g like the pokemon theme , the tempo is way too fast , and you ca n't really sing it in my conlang . 
  an example :, 
   english : ** got ta catch them all **, 
   translated : ** reikyti gaudytius \u00edlem omnim ** ( lit . 
  `` i have to catch them all '' ) for ambigious person the form would be ** est reikytyns gaudytius \u00edlem omnim ** ( is required to catch them all ) , even longer, 
  way more syllables . 
  i have n't written any songs myself , i 've only done some poetry , which can be sort of sung as a rap . 
  1 ) romanian, 
  2 ) lithuanian, 
  3 ) latin, 
  100 % correct . 
  i used 3 different 2-line texts . 
  this is absolutely correct , since it 's an a posteriori where the majority of roots are lithuanian/latin . 
  the similarity to romanian is coincidental . 
  postes gotfr\u00edd leitial fragmentami musa na grindat \u00edu . 
  1 ) the cognate to `` jeffrey '' , somewhat comical and dated, 
  2 ) i 'm presuming the text is talking about the christian god . 
  any other god would be a different word . 
  * name [ 3rd person singular genitive contraction ] be [ 3rd person singular past ] jeffery , like [ 3rd person singular past ] cheese [ accusative ] . 
  one [ locative ] day [ locative ] , mouse steal [ 3rd person singular past ] he [ genitive ] cheese [ accusative ] . 
  jeffery furious be [ 3rd person singular past ] !, 
  think [ 3rd person singular past ] that cat [ 3rd person singular genitive contraction ] do [ 3rd person singular past ] it [ accusative ] , cat tell [ 3rd person singular past ] jeffery [ dative ] that no-do [ 3rd person singular past ] it [ accusative ] . 
  jeffery no-believe [ 3rd person singular past ] he [ dative ] . 
  afterwards jeffery find [ 3rd person singular past ] piece [ accusative plural ] mouse [ genitive ] on floor [ locative ] he [ genitive ] . 
  follow [ 3rd person singular past ] they [ accusative ] until giant [ locative ] stick [ locative ] , poke [ 3rd participle past ] out-of ground [ locative ] !, 
  climb [ 3rd person singular past ] there [ locative ] ( used as an intensifier in this case ) heaven [ locative ] !, 
  god say [ 3rd person singular past ] , `` no-should-be [ 2nd person singular subjunctive present ] up-here [ locative ] stand/be [ infinitive ] , exit/go out [ 2nd person singular present imperative ] '' and god kick [ 3rd person singular past perfective ] jeffery [ accusative ] to ground [ locative ] , where he die [ 3rd person singular past ] , end [ definite ] !, 
  exactly . 
  e.g i 've heard people say that finnish is one of the most difficult languages to learn . 
  my native language is estonian ; a relative of finnish , so it is incredibly easy for me to learn . 
  even without learning the language , i can understand a significant portion of any text . 
  english is n't as difficult as people say , since it 's used so much ; there are tons of resources and places to practice it . 
  also the fact that people are exposed to it from childhood ; languages are acquired more easily as a child .
