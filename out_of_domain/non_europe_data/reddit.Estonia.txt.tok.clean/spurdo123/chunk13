  writing english is another question - this only comes with practice really . 
  also since this list includes affixed verbs , the count is inflated . 
  e.g `` abear '' is conjugated in the same pattern as `` bear '' . 
  * if do [ 2nd person singular present ] ^ 1 only possible ^ 2 , you never be [ 2nd person singular future ] better than that [ locative ] , who you are *, 
  1 ) the present tense is also used as an ambigious tense . 
  2 ) grammatically , this is the accusative of the present passive participle of the verb `` galius '' - which means `` to be able to '' . 
  i 'm not sure though which participles are passives and which ones are actives , i might have the names confused . 
  especially in this specific verb . 
  alternatively , this part of the sentence could be translated word-to-word from the english version , but it would sound clumsy . 
  3 ) alternatively , the whole sentence could use the indefinite 3rd person pronoun , instead of the 2nd person pronoun . 
  i 'm not sure which one would fit better . 
  e.g `` if one does only what one can do '', 
  * eat [ 3rd person plural present perfect ] , eat [ 3rd person plural present continious ] , eat [ 3rd person plural future ] - and - because always eat [ 3rd person plural future ] *, 
  * `` they have eaten , they are eating , they will eat - because always they will eat '' *, 
  low crime rate ? 
  we have one of the highest murder rates in europe . 
  i would n't worry about it , the chocolate egg does n't give that much anyway . 
  formal :, 
  * all human [ plural ] born [ 3rd person plural present perfect ] free [ dative ] equal [ dative ] - and in dignity [ locative ] right [ locative plural ] - and . 
  they be [ 3rd person plural present ] gifted-with [ plural ] with reason [ dative ] conscience [ dative ] - and and act [ 3rd person plural present subjunctive ] against each-other [ locative ] in brotherhood [ genitive ] essence/soul [ locative ] . 
  informal :, 
  * all man [ plural ] - are equal [ plural ] and they [ dative ] - are same [ plural ] right [ plural ] . 
  they-are intelligent [ plural ] and should/must act [ infinitive ] against-each-other [ locative ] brotherly [ adverb ] *, 
  i 'm too lazy to do a ipa , but it 's worth noting that in informal pronounciation / st / -  / \u0283t / ; / s / -  / \u0283 / word-finally and vowels at the end of words are reduced to / \u0259 / . 
  the biggest grammatical difference in formal and informal speech is the use of the subjunctive . 
  the auxilliary verb `` turet ( es ) '' + the infinitive is used to represent the subjunctive in informal speech and some dialects . 
  ( the verb `` to exist '' ), 
  p : \u00cdtiu ** est ** nygas or ( used in dialects only ) ** ebet ** nygam ( the verb `` to own '' ), 
  `` turet '' exists in formal speech , but with a slightly different meaning . 
  it 's used for orders ( like the imperative ) , but with extra emphasis . 
  interesting . 
  here 's a 9-word sentence in english as 1 word in my conlang . 
  ** and had you not been breaking in , or whatever ? 
  n - assimilated form of `` ne - '' , negates the verb, 
  in - it means `` in '' , when prefixed to an intransitive verb, 
  lum\u00e1t - to break , so `` inlum\u00e1t - '' is `` break in - '', 
  erist - the ending for 2nd person singular pluperfect, 
  k\u00e9 - an enclitic meaning `` and '', 
  n\u00e9 - the enclitic used for forming questions, 
  aut - the dubitative enclitic ( the speaker does n't quite know if the listener had not been breaking in , it might 've been something else ), 
  ** kua emorterist , tu be ` mem\u00ednab . 
  * if kill [ 2nd person singular pluperfect ] , you remember [ 2nd person singular conditional future/present ] . 
  no-be [ 3rd person singular future subjunctive ] - ( enclitic that forms questions ) so ? 
  i 've been playing since august last year pretty much continiously , although quite passively . 
  the stats say 6591 hours ago , with 12 ascensions . 
  i 'm up to 15 nonillion all time cookies and 1,73 million prestige . 
  4,34 septillion cps . 
  the big update made my cps and heavenly chips count way lower , but i recovered extremely fast . 
  i only recently got the last kitten update . 
  going for 250 prisms in my current run . 
  never used any addons whatsoever , never once tried the beta ( when everybody was playing that ) either . 
  i created mine just for fun , but it has helped me grasp grammatical concepts much better and thanks to it i understand linguistics a lot more . 
  it 's just a great learning experience . 
  * king god-and *, 
  * once be [ 3rd person singular past ] king . 
  he was childless . 
  king want [ 3rd person singular past ] son [ accusative ] . 
  he asked from priest [ dative ] he [ genitive ] : `` son me [ dative ] be-born [ 3rd person singular future subjunctive ] ! '', 
  priest say [ 3rd person singular past ] king [ dative ] : `` pray [ 2nd person singular imperative ] god [ dative ] , who [ dative ] name be [ 3rd person singular present ] werunos '' . 
  king approached werunos [ dative ] to then god [ dative ] pray [ infinitive ] . 
  `` hear [ 2nd person singular imperative ] i [ accusative ] , father [ vocative ] werunos [ vocative ] ! '', 
  god werunos down - ( antonym ) - go [ 3rd person singular past ] from heaven [ locative ] . 
  `` what [ accusative ] want [ 2nd person singular present ] ? '', 
  `` want [ 1st person singular present ] son [ accusative ] . 
  `` be [ 3rd person singular subjunctive present ] so '' . 
  said bright god werunos . 
  king [ genitive ] wife gave-birth [ 3rd person singular feminine past ] son [ accusative ] . 
  there are 3 words in total for `` king '' , but none of them come from pie * h \u2083 r\u1e17\u01f5s . 
  somewhat incorrect . 
  i live in the `` keskmurre '' area according to this map , but everyone i know ( including old people ) speak the standard language . 
  the only feature i can think of is not pronouncing the `` h '' at the beginning of words . 
  i 'd say that the area of dialects is exaggerated everywhere except for the v\u00f5ru dialect and maybe the islands . 
   how do you form the future tense ? 
  it 's worth noting that a future tense is by no means required . 
  many natlangs do n't have it ( e.g finnic languages ), 
  it does n't ** have ** to be formed in any way , that 's what i meant . 
  unless you 're talking about words such as `` tomorrow '' , `` soon '' , `` in a few years '' etc. 
  i think i misunderstood the first post a bit . 
  * past already write [ present passive participle ] be [ 3rd person singular present ] , ink dry be [ 3rd person singular present ] *, 
  * i : why-destroy [ 2nd person singular present continious ] earth [ accusative ] !!!, 
  * alien [ plural ] : because exist [ 3rd person singular present ] people [ accusative singular ] , who think [ 3rd person plural present ] that english language be [ 3rd person singular subjunctive present ] only , what [ accusative ] one [ indefinite pronoun ] need [ 3rd person singular present ] speak [ infinitive ] *, 
  * i : that be [ 3rd person singular present ] fair/true , understand [ 1st person singular present ] *, 
  it 's centum but pie * \u01f5 and * \u01f5\u02b0 yield / s\u02b2 / . 
  in baltic languages these would be / \u0292 / , and in italic / g / and / h / . 
  e.g `` siemas '' / 's \u02b2emas / ( meaning `` land '' ) compare lithuanian '' \u017eem\u0117 '' , latin `` humus '' . 
  [ these come from pie * d\u02b0\u00e9\u01f5\u02b0\u014dm , with the baltic roots coming from the genitive * \u01f5\u02b0m\u00e9s , but i do n't know about latin ], 
  it 's quite balto-slavic besides that , but it has a very heavy latin substratum and then heavy borrowing . 
  in terms of cases ; ablative -  locative . 
  instrumental -  dative . 
  a bulk of the loanwords are from middle low german , and some from east slavic . 
  ( examples : `` keiser '' - `` emperor '' [ from middle low german `` keiser '' ] , `` erc\u00f3gas '' - duke [ from middle low german `` hertog '' , influenced by german `` herzog '' ], 
  this text is actually quite outdated , since i recently redid a lot of the noun , adjective and verb inflection ; for example the locative used to be marked with - t - , which is quite non-ie , and it had been that way since the start . 
  is yours centum or satem ? 
  how do your numbers look like ? 
  here 's a few that i find most interesting :, 
   1 : ** \u00fanas ** / ` u : nas /, 
   8 : ** yktas ** / ' \u0268ktas / [ irregular / o / -  / \u0268 / sound change ], 
   100 : ** kentos ** / ` kentus /, 
  cool . 
  my word for `` 2 '' in nominative is `` d\u00favas '' / ` du : vas / - the stress is different though .
