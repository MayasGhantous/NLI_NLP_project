  `` da\u015byat '' for `` 10 '' instantly reminded me of russian . 
  it looks pretty good though  . 
  i like the non-palatalised stop in `` gatw\u00e1r '' , besides the romance languages , i ca n't think of any living ie languages having that . 
  lithuanian , manx and irish have / k\u02b2 / , and scottish gaelic has / c / . 
  my conlang actually does n't have the pitch accent system that lithuanian has , only stress and length are differentiated . 
  e.g `` o '' has a three-way distinction ; / u / unstressed , / uo / stressed , / o : / long . 
  * no-go [ 2nd person singular present imperative ] gentle [ adverb ] in that [ emphasiser ] good [ accusative ] night [ accusative ] . 
  fight [ style : furiously , in a rage ] , fight against light [ genitive ] dying [ locative ] . 
  both are used . 
  here are some russian swearwords used , that i hear :, 
   urood, 
   suka ( somewhat rarer ), 
   debiilik ( not sure if it 's russian ), 
  all the fusional affixes for the verbs , nouns and adjectives . 
  6 noun cases , 3 numbers , 8 tenses + 2 imperatives , and 2 moods . 
  also 14 nominal forms , of which many declend in all cases and numbers . 
  no fusing of affixes either ( there was a special term for this i think ), 
  i 'm interested in your vocabulary . 
  how much indo-european or uralic ( or even turkic/arabic as you mentioned trading with arabs ) borrowing is there ? 
  is there somekind of linguistic purism movement ? 
  for example terms for agriculture ; in estonian ( an uralic language ) , many terms relating to agriculture are borrowed from proto-germanic or baltic . 
  ( e.g wheel , plow , seed , field , slash-and-burn , sheep , names for many plants ), 
  also , is the religion or religious vocabulary influenced by indo-europeans or uralics ( you mentioned it being similar to finnish paganism ) in any way ? 
  russians ? 
  did they adopt agriculture extremely late ? 
  that sounds interesting . 
  no word that directly and always translates to `` home '' . 
  `` d\u00famas '' - this means both `` house '' and `` home '', 
  `` t\u00e9vyn\u00e9 '' - this means `` fatherland '' , `` native land '' , and `` home '', 
  also , no words that directly and always translate to `` moon '' and `` month '' respectively, 
  `` l\u00fana '' - this means both `` moon '' , and `` month '' , although the meaning of `` moon '' is primary . 
  `` mensas '' - this means both `` moon '' , and `` month '' , although the meaning of `` month '' is primary . 
  no word for `` husband '' , this meaning is used by the word for `` man '' - `` v\u00edras '', 
  * look [ 2nd person singular imperative present ] you [ genitive ] do [ present passive participle accusative singular ] !,

  would n't that be `` linguistic purification '' ? 
  for those who ca n't read cyrillic :,

  dark pink - `` great russians '' - russians, 
  light pink - `` little russians '' - ukrainians, 
  grey - poles, 
  green - bulgars, 
  blue - germans, 
  yellow - french, 
  right row :, 
  dark blue - moldavians/moldovans, 
  white - albanians, 
  dark yellow - `` cygane '' - i think this was gypsies, 
  brown - gagauz, 
  light yellow - jews, 
  extremely exaggerated in russia ( and i presume in scandinavia ) . 
  i think `` moldavia '' refers to both bessarabia and the part of moldavia in modern-day romania , while `` moldova '' refers to the current state of moldova - bessarabia minus budjak and bukovina . 
  that 's what i expected . 
  i only just started playing the game . 
  i 'm not `` complaining '' , just bringing up the points that i disliked on my first playthrough . 
  it just seemed odd , i did n't know if it was tied to the difficulty . 
  bad wording , whatever, 
  yeah in hindsight that now seems obvious , but the fact that even on easy , there are next to no rebels as a large empire , seems a little off . 
  in eu3 there were massive amounts of rebels as a large empire regardless of difficulty . 
  to be honest it was quite generic , and took a lot of influence from films and media depicting that era ( the gun in the bathroom , bodyguard calls in sick , etc ) . 
  that does n't mean the story was bad ; it was very good , just that it was n't completely original . 
  it 's still a kick-ass game though . 
  the best game i 've ever played i 'd say . 
  immense nostalgia aswell . 
  shame about the series though , mafia 2 just was n't as good as the first one ( it was still a good game though ) , and from what i can tell mafia 3 is n't looking that good .

  the voting age for local elections in estonia is 16 . 
  taking effect in the next elections in 2017 . 
  because there are a lot of old people , especially in rural areas . 
  reducing the voting age brings more young voters , to vote on issues regarding young people . 
  bringing the voting age down also ( should ) increase the interest of youth in politics , the future of the state and the municipality . 
  and many issues that are important to young people are done on the municipal level - school , sports facilities etc. 
  finno-ugric peoples and turks not being considered white is a very dated theory . 
  it is true that hungarians , finns , turks etc all originated from asia , but genetically they are all mostly the same as the people surrounding them . 
  interesting that dravidian peoples are considered `` black '' by this map . 
  do they look any different from north indians ? 
  that seems likely yeah . 
  poland-lithuania 's ghost in east prussia , 
  how old are you ? 
  have you seen modern 15-year olds ? 
  they 're physically quite mature . 
  dude , i 'm 15 . 
  i know only 1 gendered language - russian . 
  most nouns can be determined by the ending of the word . 
  e.g in russian , most masculine nouns end in a consonant . 
  most feminine nouns end in - a or - ja . 
  most neuter nouns end in - o or - e. 
  of course there are various exceptions . 
  e.g words that end with the soft sign ( \u044c ) are quite irregular . 
  there are some patterns in terms of meaning , e.g words regarding emotions , feelings etc are mainly feminine . 
  e.g `` love '' - '' \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c '' , is feminine . 
  a better comparison of this sort would be the fact that there are about 2x as many azeris in iran than in azerbaijan .
