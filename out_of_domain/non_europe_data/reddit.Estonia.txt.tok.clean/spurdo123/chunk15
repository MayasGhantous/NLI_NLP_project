  the formal ( to people you do n't know at all , people of a higher rank than you ) pronoun that would be used : ** voster ** / ` vuoster / ~ / ` woster /, 
  the overformal ( e.g to a noblewoman by a peasant , or as a joke ) pronoun that would be used : ** domnyvostrum ** / dumn\u0268 ` vuostrum / ~ / dumn\u0268 ` wostrum /, 
  reversing the word order ( t\u00e9 am\u00f3 , t\u00e9 myli etc ) would stress the fact that it is * you * that i love , not anyone else . 
  bulgarian does use grammatical cases , but not for every noun . 
  the vocative is still used , so i 'd say putting the number at 2 would be fair . 
  for pronouns , accusative , dative , nominative and prepositional are distinct . 
  the vocative is used for certain animate nouns , e.g family members , masculine names , and some others . 
  the instrumental is used in certain phrases . 
  i think macedonian is pretty much the same as bulgarian . 
  i think you should put the number at 2 , but with an asterisk , because there are a lot of exceptions . 
  could you give an example of the vocative ? 
  this is pretty much true for estonian aswell . 
  there are only 3/4 irregular cases - nominative , genitive , partitive and the short form of the singular illative . 
  the rest are formed 100 % regularly by attaching a suffix to the genitive . 
  ( singular or plural respectively ), 
  the english possessive ca n't be called a true grammatical case ; it 's a clitic . 
  it 's disputed though . 
  in english , they only truly exist in pronouns , here are examples :, 
  he - this is in the nominative case . 
  `` he came '' , `` he is big '' , etc, 
  him - this is the oblique case . 
  e.g `` i love him '' , `` him '' fills the role of the accusative case . 
  `` i gave the letter to him '' . 
  `` to him '' fills the role of the dative case . 
  his - this is the genitive case . 
  e.g `` this is his car '' . 
  it indicates possession . 
  in other languages , these distinctions exist for all nouns/noun phrases . 
  in english , most of these are indicated by prepositions . 
  e.g the essive case . 
  in english this is represented by the preposition `` as '' . 
  e.g `` as a doctor '' . 
  in estonian , this is represented by a suffix to the noun - the essive is `` arstina '' , while the nominative is `` arst '', 
  i meant the vocative in russian . 
  this is true , yes . 
  for example in estonian , adjectives , determiners and nouns all inflect for case and number . 
  interesting . 
  i always thought that \u043b\u0435\u0441\u0443 was just the prepositional . 
  besides god and people , are there any other vocative forms ? 
  yeah , it 's somewhat difficult to explain in simple terms . 
  it 's worth noting that while english uses the verb `` to have '' to indicate possession ( e.g i have a book ) , estonian uses the adessive case . 
  the adessive case usually carries the meaning `` on ( top of ) '' . 
  e.g `` laual '' - `` on the table '', 
  but it 's also used for possession - `` i have a book '' - `` mul on raamat '' , lit . 
  `` on me is book '', 
  absolutely true . 
  probably the most easiest language for me to learn would be finnish , despite the fact that it 's regarded as incredibely difficult . 
  simply because my native language is so similar to it . 
  many ? 
  i can only think of 1 romance language that still has noun cases - romanian . 
  the oblique ( or objective ) case is used for the object of a verb or preposition . 
  so that means it can fulfill the role of the accusative , but also the dative , locative etc. 
  e.g in the sentence `` i like him '' - `` him '' is the direct object , and is in the oblique/objective case . 
  and the accusative is used for the direct object . 
  in short , the oblique case * can * represent the accusative , but it can also fill other roles, 
  that is thanks to the diminutives . 
  there are 3 diminutives , broadly categorised as neuter , feminine and masculine . 
  - ut - is the neuter diminutive . 
  it broadly indicates smallness . 
  - iuk - is the masculine diminutive . 
  it usually indicates certain qualities ( strong , rough , big etc ) and amplifies the meaning , but also the speaker himself . 
  - ul - is the feminine diminutive . 
  this usually softens the meaning , also certain qualities ( cuteness , attractivness etc ), 
  stacking diminutives together like this is used extensively by children . 
  if the order was ut-ul-iuk , it is most likely that the speaker was a female child . 
  if it was just ut-iuk , ut-iul or only one diminutive , it would be difficult to tell anything about the speaker . 
  a further deconstruction of that word :, 
   dain - the root for `` sing '', 
   anium - indicates a collection of something ( so , dainanium - means `` an album '' ), 
   ut - the neuter diminutive, 
   iuk - the masculine diminutive, 
   ul - the feminine diminutive, 
   um - indicates the dative dual, 
  you would use the verb `` omama '' ( or archaic `` evima '' ) , so '' ( ma ) oman raamatut '', 
  it 's somewhat weird to me though . 
  to say that the book is on top of you , you would say something like `` minu peal on raamat '' ( `` peal '' being the adessive of `` pea '' - meaning `` head '' ) , although that also carries the meaning of `` my head has a book '' ... 
   we foundimme ourn dog abandonedettu in a boxissa, 
  that 's just too damn funny . 
  how about nouns ? 
  knowledge , knower etc ? 
  true , but it behaves just like the diminutives , so i categorise it as such . 
  something similar in russian :, 
  '' \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c '' - `` to help '' requires the dative . 
  and from what i can tell latin also requires the dative in the verb for `` to help '' - `` succurro '' , so this might be an indo-european thing .

  in my a posteriori ( mainly baltic , latin , loan sources are germanic , east slavic and finnic ) conlang , a few of my earlier terms have unknown etymologies ; i ca n't find the source and no longer remember how i got them . 
  this is interesting to me , since i find etymology quite important ( e.g getting the numbers right , my word for `` five '' for a long time was `` pent - '' ( which makes no sense , since the - nt - is a hellenic feature ) , now it 's `` penk - '' , which is much more suitable ), 
  a few examples :, 
   ** paden ( - iti ) ** - `` to fall '' ( possibly related to lithuanian `` patekti '' . 
  due to the pa - at the beginning , it 's most likely of baltic origin ), 
   ** klikel ( - is ) ** - `` small '' ( possibly related to german `` klein '' , but i find it unlikely ), 
   ** kei\u00e1es ** / kei'a : es / ( the - es is technically a suffix ) - `` because '' ( i 've no idea how i derived this , but it lines up with other conjuctions , beginning with k - . 
  compare latin `` quoniam '' , lithuanian `` kad '' , but a finnic source is also possible , compare finnish `` koska '' - `` because '' ), 
   ** pastan ( - iti ) ** - `` to try '' , `` to attempt '' ( no idea . 
  the pa - at the beginning indicates probable baltic origin ), 
   ** trekas ** - `` racetrack '' ( this might be just straight from english `` track '' ( racing slang ? ),
