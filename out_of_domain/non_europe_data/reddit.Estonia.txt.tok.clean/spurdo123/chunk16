  but i 'm not sure . 
  compare lithuanian `` takas '' ), 
   ** snibas ** - `` nipple '' ( no idea aswell . 
  compare lithuanian `` spenelis '' ), 
   ** kolenas ** - `` knee '' ( no idea . 
  compare lithuanian `` kelis '' ), 
   ** paletas ** - `` toe '' ( no idea whatsoever . ), 
   ** peras ** - `` hope '' , `` expectation '' ( compare latin `` praesumptio '' ( presumption ) , but this is unlikely as a source ), 
  a few other interesting etymologies :, 
   ** orensas ** - `` morning '' . 
  this is descended from latin `` oriens '' , which had the meaning of `` dawn '' , `` sunrise '' , and also `` east '' . 
  the word for `` east '' is now a germanic loan - `` austris '' , from proto-germanic * austr\u0105 . 
  oh , thanks . 
  this seems to be from old east slavic \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0463\u043d\u043e then , lining up with other loans , although a loan for a body part is odd ( but still possible ), 
  * britain vote [ 3rd person present perfect singular ] for ( for the purpose of ) leave [ gerund dative ] from european [ locative ] union [ locative ] *, 
  for estonian :, 
  `` eha '' means the red evening sky . 
  `` t\u00e4ht '' means star . 
  `` eha '' is possibly from proto-finnic * ektago ( or a similar root ) . 
  `` t\u00e4ht '' is from proto-finnic * t\u00e4hti . 
  note : this word is only used for venus in the evening , . 
  `` koit '' means dawn . 
  it is from proto-finnic * koi . 
  this word is only used for venus in the morning . 
  3 ) ** aot\u00e4ht ** - agu + t\u00e4ht . 
  `` agu '' means dawn or twilight . 
  it is essentialy a synonym for `` koidut\u00e4ht '' . 
  this has multible possibilities for origin :, 
  a ) same root as in the word `` hagu '' ( thin wood chopped down for heating ) - of baltic origin . 
  compare latvian `` sakas '' and lithuanian '' \u0161aka '' . 
  b ) same root as in the word `` hakkama '' ( to start ) - this is probably from proto-germanic * hakk\u014dn\u0105 ( compare english `` hack '' ) . 
  alternatively this root is of baltic origin , compare lithuanian '' \u0161okti '' ( to jump , to dance , { dialectally } to start , to begin ) . 
  c ) same root as in the word `` h\u00e4gu '' ( light fog , mist , muddy mix ) . 
  this is of finnic origin but i ca n't find the reconstructed word . 
  cognate to finnish `` h\u00e4k\u00e4 '' . 
  i guess you could say that . 
  i did this as a child , and i have n't seen any of the effects described . 
  luckily i did n't do it much , and stopped when i discovered conventional masturbation . 
   attaching multible suffixes to the root of a noun and verb to form new words, 
  that does n't sound too unreasonable for a fusional language . 
  in my ( fusional ) conlang , there are a few verbs created of 2 or more prefixes :, 
  e.g : ** entob\u00edtiti ** - `` to return '' , `` to come back '', 
  `` ent - '' - means `` back '' , `` ob - '' forms antonyms , '' \u00edt - '' is the root for `` to go '' , and '' - ti '' is an infinitive suffix . 
  for suffixes , i can only think of one : - - nium indicates a collection of something , and - as indicates the masculine singular nominative , so words of this kind always end in '' - niumas '' in the singular nominative . 
  here 's my attempt at something like that :, 
  ** neultrepacekoslovakytinas ** - `` the one who does n't need to be made to resemble a czechoslovak very well '' - in nominative singular with no further suffixes attached, 
  ** neultrepacekoslovakytin\u00f3riamk\u00e9aut ** - `` and the ones who do n't need to be made to resemble a czechoslovak or someone very well '' - in accusative plural ( + dubitative enclitic and enclitic for `` and '' ), 
  breakdown, 
   ne - negation, 
   ultre - - indicates doing something very well , very good, 
   pa - - hard to explain , but in this case indicates `` making something resemble something '', 
   yt - forms a verb ( is retained in nominal forms of verbs ), 
   in - participle of necessity, 
   as - masculine singular nominative, 
   \u00f3riam - accusative plural, 
   k\u00e9 - `` and '', 
  something worth noting :, 
  cities like reval , riga etc were ethnically majority german in the middle ages . 
  even as late as 1820 , over 40 % of reval 's population was of german ethnicity . 
  german ethnicity . 
  jews in estonia atleast were always a very small minority . 
  the first jewish congregation in reval was founded only in 1811 . 
  in 1820 there were 36 jews in estonia . 
  i do n't know about riga , but from what i can tell there was a bigger community there ( although still , there were more baltic-germans than yiddish-speaking jews ), 
  ** s\u00fade tupsum pilni ** / ` su : de ` tupsum ` pilni / - * shit [ 2nd person singular imperative singular present ] you [ reflexive accusative ] full [ locative ] * - lit . 
  `` go shit yourself full '' , broadly translates to `` go fuck yourself '', 
  ** deos perfutent tavam matrem ** / ` deus per ` futent ` tavam ` matrem / - * god fuck [ 3rd person singular present subjunctive perfective ] you [ possessive feminine accusative ] mother [ accusative ] * - lit . 
  `` may god fuck your mother to shreds '' , or something like that . 
  it 's worth noting that not every language writes it as `` jazz '' . 
  for example estonian writes it as `` d\u017e\u00e4ss '' . 
  the dative case is used . 
  word order is generally irrelevant , it varies between dialects and sociolects a lot . 
  * man woman [ dative ] book [ accusative ] give [ 3rd person singular present ] *, 
  the dative cases is marked by a suffix , in nouns there are 12 of these suffixes in singular , not counting irregular nouns . 
  here 's the full list :, 
  masculine :, 
   1st and 3rd declensions : ** - u ** / u /, 
   2nd declension : ** - \u00ed ** / i : /, 
   12th declension : ** - iui ** / jui / ~ / iui /,

  an important thing to note :, 
  there are 2 versions of the game ; oldschool runescape ( a.k.a `` 2007scape '' ) and runescape 3 . 
  if you have no prior nostalgia/experience with the game , as a new player it 's likely best to play runescape 3 . 
  the outdated graphics and engine of oldschool might put off someone who 's never played the game before . 
  in terms of playerbase size , they 're more or less equal . 
  great game . 
  played it for the first time a few years ago with no prior nostalgia ( along with ocarina of time ) , both blew my mind . 
  mm has more content , and pretty much only due to that fact i like it more .
