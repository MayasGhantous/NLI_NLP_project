  [ a map with etymology ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/4be6gu/the_word_yes_in_european_languages/ ), 
  although that map still makes a mistake on irish and scottish gaelic . 
  in estonian there is aswell ; anything over 300m is a mountain ( not the absolute height from sealevel ), 
  we still call many of our highest hills mountains , even though they are not . 
  ** \u00dapi davesai mag akam k\u00e1m leitos **, 
  * river [ plural ] give [ 3rd person plural present ] more water [ accusative ] than rain *, 
  what are you talking about ? 
  is there no mutation/gradation/lenition ? 
  so , e.g in * bd * , is the `` bd '' cluster always intact in all forms ? 
  what ? 
  i presume this is about support/voting for the republican-democratic parties , with red being republican and blue democrat ?

  * we [ dual dative , i 'm presuming this since no context in op , and because the dual is cool ] be [ 3rd person plural present ] morning [ dative , but the meaning `` morning '' is archaic , this word is only used for `` breakfast '' ] bacon egg [ plural ] - and *, 
  * damn , my [ possessive masculine nominative singular ] car no-start [ 3rd person singular present ] *, 
  * go [ 1st person singular future ] shopping [ supine , i 'm presuming this is said by a `` hip '' person or a female , as this is an english loan ] afternoon [ instrumental singular ( a non-productive case ) ] *, 
  * know [ 1st person singular present ] that know [ 2nd person singular present ] that know [ 3rd person singular present ] that eat [ 1st person singular past ] food [ accusative ] today *, 
  baltic romlang . 
  the verb `` to know '' ( infinitive : `` koniti '' ) is from latin `` cognosco '' ( to learn , to recognise , to know ) , but the meaning has broadened slightly . 
  the initial `` j '' in `` jedau '' and `` j\u00e9skam '' is an independent development , not influenced by slavic . 
  yep , this is true . 
  you can do it with a chopper easily , although iirc you miss out on a unique stunt jump . 
  the word `` tai '' when used as a pronoun . 
  normally , it puts emphasis on the subject , or has the meaning `` that over there '' ( somewhat archaic/dialectal ), 
  but , when used as a pronoun , it acts as a distal 3rd person pronoun ; `` he over there '' , `` he near you '', 
  e.g the sentence `` person a said this and person b said that '' , in english you ca n't really say it with pronouns . 
  but in my conlang :, 
  * he said this and he over there said that *, 
  unlike other determiners , `` tai '' has no gendered forms . 
  of course , this is n't `` untranslatable '' , but it takes a while to explain . 
  also , there 's a lot of vocabulary with tiny nuances that take a while to explain : e.g there 's a whole hierarchy for words that mean `` leader '' , `` lord '' , `` master '' , `` mister '' etc. 
  every word has a slight difference in meaning . 
  e.g in power or status ; an * `` erras '' * is more richer than a * `` ponas '' * , although both firmly translate to english `` mister '' . 
  * find [ 1st person singular past ] rome [ accusative ] like city made-of brick [ locative plural ] , leave [ 1st person singular past ] - and from it [ locative ] like city made-of marble [ locative ] *, 
  * this [ plural ] annoying [ nominative plural ] ( lit . 
  `` bullying '' ) fly [ plural ] be [ 3rd person plural present frequentative ] annoying [ nominative plural ] *, 
  * go [ 1st person singular past subjunctive ] sleep [ inessive/lative , non-productive case ] approximately hour previously [ adverb ] *, 
  * meet [ 1st person dual future ] ( lit . 
  `` together-come '' ) ordinary/usual [ locative ] ( notice the francocism ) location [ locative ] today [ adverb ] *, 
  with grave accents , indicating stress . 
  some points :, 
  `` h '' is always silent ; * / h / -  / - / in all cases . 
  in older loanwords/exonyms , it is n't written , so `` greece '' is `` ellas '' / ` ellas / . 
  but in newer ones , they are ; so `` honduras '' is still `` honduras '' , but pronounced / un ` duras /, 
  * please , hear [ 2nd person singular present imperative ] i [ accusative ] *, 
  * i truly [ adverb ] no-want [ 1st person singular present ] steal [ infinitive ] you [ possessive masculine plural accusative ; it defaults to masculine since there are multible items in a list and they are of different genders ] power [ accusative plural ] life [ accusative plural ] - or *, 
  * every [ emphatic ] life be [ 3rd person singular present ] special for existence [ dative ; can also mean `` world '' , funnily enough ] this [ genitive ] world [ genitive ] *, 
  macrons and acute accents are interchangeable . 
  * where [ inessive/lative , non-productive case ] you leave [ 2nd person singular past ] that [ pseudo-definite ] jacket [ accusative ] *, 
  * ( from the backside car [ locative ] ) no-be [ 1st person plural present ] - ( interrogative enclitic ) there still/yet *, 
  * how much/many conlanger [ accusative plural ] be [ 3rd person plural present ] require [ present passive participle nominative plural ] in order to change [ infinitive ] lightbulb [ accusative ; 2nd diminutive ( augmentative ) of unattested `` virnas '' < - loanword from german `` birne '' ) *, 
  i think this counts puppet kingdoms under regencies , under which the kingdom of poland ( 1916-1918 ) falls under . 
  this would explain the baltics aswell ; there was an united baltic duchy in 1918 . 
  46 mil ? 
  that does n't sound right . 
  did you do monks from lvl 62 ? 
  i did monks only from something like lvl 91 though , did sharks until that . 
  i think i made around ~ 20m at the highest , probably something more like ~ 15m . 
  i cooked them aswell , but i do n't think the burnt amount affects it too much ; i 've got 3242 burnt sharks and 1040 burnt monkfish in my bank right now . 
  there 's a gigantic difference ; with monkfish you can play other games , do whatever while doing it . 
  it 's very afk . 
  with rc you ca n't really do that ( unless you 're a god at multitasking ), 
  very cool . 
  what do your pronouns look like ? 
  are there any remnants of the dual number , or is it all gone ? 
  are you confusing the nominative and accusative ? 
  in most ie languages , the accusative of the 1st person singular pronoun begins with ** m - ** ( english : `` me '' , latin `` me '' , lithuanian `` mane '' ) , while the nominative is something different : ( english `` i '' , low german `` ick '' , latin `` ego '' , lithuanian `` a\u0161 '' ), 
  i would guess your `` eo '' to be the nominative , not the accusative . 
  also , what do your dual pronouns look like ? 
  the problem with a keyboard is that you ca n't input precise movements like you can with an analogue stick . 
  this is a very important fact in oot especially , to hit ess position on a keyboard you have to pause , go to the options , edit the range , and only then you can do it . 
  same thing for something like dot skip , since iirc you need to hold the analogue stick slightly left to do the sidehop . 
  for a casual playthrough , a keyboard is perfectly fine though . 
  estonian `` s\u00e4\u00e4sk '' is a cognate with the sami \u010duoika . 
  and apparently finnish also has `` s\u00e4\u00e4ski '', 
  other finno-mordvinic languages :, 
  * erzhya : \u015be\u015bke [ idk the cyrillic ], 
  * moksha : \u015b\u00e4\u015bk\u00e4 [ idk the cyrillic ], 
  * no-exist [ 3rd person singular present ] shelter [ accusative ] against storm [ locative ] *, 
  the estonian `` s\u00e4\u00e4sk '' is n't from proto-samic . 
  they both come from the same source though , and that source is shared between finnic , samic and mordvinic languages . 
  my suggestion : put the estonian as a seperate colour , and have it say `` cognate to northern sami '' \u010duoika '' ), 
  by the way , where did you get '' \u010dakku '' ? 
  that 's karelian , is n't it ? 
  cognates exist in the mordvinic family , but not anywhere else .

  this is true , yes !,
