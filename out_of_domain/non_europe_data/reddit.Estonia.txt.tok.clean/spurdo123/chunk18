  but , nearly 35-40 % of our vocabulary is of germanic origin . 
  this is an important fact , keep that in mind . 
   the only thing estonia and scan . 
  have in common was there was raids in estonia and minor settlement, 
  nope . 
  culturally , we 're quite similar , but this is just due to proximity i guess . 
  linguistically , ( not counting blood relatives like finland ) , we are most related to northern germany ( and by extension : the netherlands ) . 
  by coincidence , our vocabulary is quite similar to english aswell ( old germanic loanwords + newer latin/greek loanwords make it even bigger ) . 
  we have a small amount of slavic vocabulary . 
  however , the amount of slavic roots is still about twice the amount of swedish roots . 
   estonians are genealogically more finnish & slavic than germanic, 
  what is `` germanic '' anyway ? 
  nordics and germans are very different from each other in terms of genetics . 
  what is `` slavic '' anyway ? 
  russians living in northern russia would of course be similar to us genetically ; they are russified finno-ugrics . 
  in terms of actual history ; we were ruled by germans for 700 years , despite different states being the controllers . 
  under the russian empire , german nobles retained their privileges until the 19th century . 
  in this regard , i would actually count estonia as a part of a germanosphere , not `` nordic '' . 
  there 's a big problem with classifying things like this : we have next to nothing in common with iceland , norway , switzerland . 
  but we do have lots in common with sweden , finland , germany . 
  everything goes in a continuum . 
  it 's pointless to draw lines . 
  it is true , we have things in common with russia . 
  but poland ? 
  belarus ? 
  next to nothing . 
  * breast [ dual nominative ] *, 
  ** sernerdas ** , i got it by asking cleverbot . 
  he answered `` serious nerd '' , so that became `` seris nerdas '' -  `` sernerdas '', 
  two-ten-thousand [ dual ] two-hundred [ dual ], 
  i 'm definitely not an expert on the matter , but here 's a website :, 
  scandinavians have more of the haplogroup l1 , while germans have more of the haplogroup r1b, 
  why are broadleaf and mixed forests not distinguished ? 
  in estonia , there are slightly more coniferous forests than broadleaf .

  the situation with h\u00e4n / se is pretty interesting , since in estonian , it exists too , but using `` see '' ( our cognate to `` se '' , with the same meaning ) is considered rude by some , and i 'm not sure if it 's even widespread , it seems to be used more by the youth . 
  our 3rd person pronoun ( `` tema '' , `` ta '' ) is used extensively still . 
  it is a cognate to the finnish `` t\u00e4m\u00e4 '' ( `` it '' ), 
  and regarding indo-european languages , proto-indo-european itself never had a 3rd person pronoun ; it used demonstratives , like some of the older ie languages , like latin . 
  * eat [ gerund ] good be [ 3rd person singular present ] *, 
  simple statements like this tend to be sov , although svo is generally the most common word order . 
  my alphabet is quite simple , it has less characters than the iso latin alphabet ( missing `` q '' , `` h '' , `` w '' , `` z '' ) . 
  however , there are letters used for various abbreviations , some of which are quite rare ( but not completely unique ), 
  ** \u1ef9 ** is used as an abbreviation for ** ym ** , ** yn ** / \u0268m / , / \u0268n / . 
  it seems to be quite a rare letter , but it is used . 
  ** y\u0328 ** is used as an abbreviation for ** ys ** / \u0268s / . 
  this seems to be even rarer . 
  but from what i can tell most notably elfdalian uses this . 
  these can also be combined ; for example the cluster / ams / - it would be written as ** \u0105\u0303 **, 
  in action :, 
  ** tamsumas ** -  ** t\u0105\u0303\u0169\u0105 ** `` darkness '', 
  what is the language that has `` naka '' ? 
  also , is there any further etymology for sanskrit `` r\u0101tri '' ? 
  interesting that they use an ie word , `` night '' is not a word that is often borrowed . 
  here 's a map of this same word in europe : http://imgur.com/4dd10f5, 
  the word falls neatly into the language families ( the sole exceptions being irish and scottish gaelic ) , but it does n't seem to do that here in india . 
  in slavic and baltic languages , the letter '' \u010d '' is used for this . 
  in estonian , '' \u0161 '' is used for the same sound as english `` sh '' , but there is no '' \u010d '' so for the english `` ch '' sound the letter combination `` t\u0161 '' is used . 
  '' \u0161 '' is only used for proper nouns and certain loanwords . 
  so , `` ketchup '' in estonian is `` ket\u0161up '' . 
  no reason to buy it secondhand ; developers have long since disbanded , if you want to support them , i suggest checking out daniel v\u00e1vra 's new project : kingdom come : deliverance, 
  i realised very late that this is in fact the bay of biscay . . 
  are the biscic languages related in any way to basque or the ie languages ? 
  or are they a seperate family ? 
  how much romance/celtic/basque influence is there ? 
  depends on the language . 
  there is another similar case called the comitative that fills this purpose . 
  for example , in estonian , for the sentence `` with my wife '' , the bare comitative would be used . 
  but , a preposition can be used for emphasis :, 
  * minu naisega - * i [ genitive ] wife [ comitative ] *, 
  * koos minu naisega - * together i [ genitive ] wife [ comitative ] *, 
  * rape [ 1st person plural imperative present ] they [ possessive neuter accusative plural ] horse [ accusative plural ] and escape [ 1st person plural imperative present ] ride [ adverbial active present participle ] they [ possessive feminine accusative plural ] wife [ accusative plural ] , that [ masculine ] they [ accusative ] confuse [ 3rd person singular future ] *, 
  / \u0259 / is any unrounded mid vowel ; [ e ] and [ \u0264 ] are very common allophones . 
  ** r\u0259t\u0259rik ras\u0259va \u015aup\u0259\u0259 ** / \u0281\u0259t\u0259\u0281ik ' \u0281as\u0259wa \u0283u ` p\u0259 /,
