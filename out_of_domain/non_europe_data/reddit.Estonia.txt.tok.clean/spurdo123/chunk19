  doggish is such a cool name . 
  question : what is the 1st person singular pronoun ? 
  / dv / -  / tv / ( because there is no / d / ) -  / t\u02b7 / ( because there is no / v / ) should n't be that far-fetched . 
  and regarding the second to last ; there is no / f / . 
  closest sound would be / p\u02b0 / . 
  ( represented in the ortography by `` f '' , funnily enough ), 
  regarding initial consonant clusters in natlangs ; estonian for example drops the first element and keeps the second in loanwords [ e.g low german `` storm '' becomes estonian `` torm '' ], 
  currently none ; the closest things to clusters would be aspirated labialised stops :, 
  * / k\u02b0\u02b7a /,

  * / t\u02b0\u02b7a /, 
  * london [ inessive singular ] warm-is and sunny-is right now day-is *, 
  * ( 2nd person interrogative particle ) smile [ plural present ] still , yet , even now you [ 2nd genitive ] eye [ plural ] you [ 2nd genitive ] cheek [ delative plural ] *, 
  the 2nd genitive is used for 2 or more possessions , as opposed to the 1st genitive , which is used for 1 possession , and the 3rd genitive , which is used for ambigious possession or origin .

  1 ) sernerdas - a heavily fusional conservative balto-romlang ; my first conlang , i made it this way since i like lithuanian and had a big interest in latin at the time . 
  there are a few mistakes in it that i do n't like ; namely having centum ( latin ) roots for very basic words ; the 1st person pronoun ( the nominative ; the oblique forms are fine ) ; many of the numbers , etc. 
  the 1st person pronoun is `` ego '' , but something more fitting would be `` esiun '' . 
  i also was somewhat lazy , so i did n't flesh out many features ; e.g the subjunctive is overly regular ; the passive voice is formed analytically ; the balto-slavic pitch accent is totally gone , adjectives have only 1 declension class and are semantically and phonologically completely distinct from nouns etc. 
  also , i think it could 've been more phonologically innovative ; i believe a person who is fluent in lithuanian , latin and knows latvian could understand most of the language , besides some words , e.g the vocabulary has a quite a few germanic loanwords , similar to latvian . 
  some are quite old , e.g '' \u012bserna '' , meaning `` tool '' , sword '' ; from proto-germanic * \u012bsarn\u0105 , meaning `` iron '' . 
  2 ) takanaa - a somewhat agglutinative a priori language ; small phonology , tight phonotactics and a large amount of grammatical cases . 
  currently in the beginning stages ; the grammar is looking nice but my vocabulary is extremely small . 
  also vso . 
  does this mean `` off is my will '' ?

  about estonia :, 
  `` estonia '' in estonian is `` eesti '' . 
  this is infact a loanword from german `` este '' . 
  the name has 2 possible origins :, 
  1 ) from a germanic word for `` east '' - compare german `` ost '' , old english '' \u0113ast '' , english `` east '' . 
  2 ) from a proto-baltic * a\u012bsto - , * a\u012bst ( e ) r , meaning `` land '' , `` field '' - compare lithuanian aik\u0161te - `` field '' . 
  before the germanic conquering , we called estonia `` maavald '' , which is a compound of 2 words ; `` maa '' , and `` vald '' . 
  `` maa '' means `` land '' , and `` vald '' in modern use means `` parish '' , `` municipality '' . 
  about finland :, 
  the name `` suomi '' is most likely from proto-baltic * \u0161\u0101ma - , which is from * \u017eem\u0113 - , meaning `` land '' . 
  there are 2 alternate etymologies :, 
  1 ) an older indo-european loan , with the original meaning `` man '' . 
  compare latin `` homo '' , and old lithuanian '' \u017emuo '' . 
  2 ) the older theory , that is it the same root as in `` suo '' ( `` swamp '' ) or `` suomu '' ( `` scale '' ) . 
  both are of finnic or finno-ugric origin .

  interesting , it 's showing up as blocks for me though . 
  i meant old lithuanian , sorry . 
  '' \u017emogus '' is an affixed form of '' \u017emuo '' . 
  nope . 
  estonia and latvia are atheist/lutheran ; poland , lithuania , slovakia , slovenia etc are all catholic .
