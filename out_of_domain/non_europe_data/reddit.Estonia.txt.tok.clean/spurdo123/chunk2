  seems like something i should try out though . 
  however , besides the roots themselves , i try to create as much as possible by myself ( idioms , phrases , coining new words ) . 
  also taking many synonyms from many different source languages , so f.e i have 6 different words for `` city '' which all have their own style variety and are used in special occasions . 
  turks have very little mongol/turkic admixture . 
  they are very similar genetically to the surrounding arabs , armenians , greeks and whoever lived there before they came there . 
  similar to hungarians : while other uralics have a lot of haplogroup n , hungarians have virtually none , they are genetically very similar to the slavs , germans , romanians etc living by them . 
  for natlangs , i would put forth estonian and finnish as examples of `` phonetic '' ortographies . 
  i can only think of 1 irregularity for estonian.there are some words with \u00fc\u00fc ( vowel ) where the '' \u00fc\u00fc '' is pronounced as '' \u00fci '' . 
  f.e `` s\u00fc\u00fca '' is pronounced `` s\u00fcia '' , `` h\u00fc\u00fce '' is pronounced `` h\u00fcie '' etc. 
  more interesting history than the other two ? 
  that 's debatable tbh . 
  all 3 have had very interesting histories . 
  riverbend ? 
  where does this come from ? 
  `` eesti '' was loaned into estonian from german `` este '' , and it is presumed that that came from the germanic word for `` east '' . 
  an alternative etymology would be from baltic * a\u012bsto - , * a\u012bst ( e ) r , meaning `` land '' , `` field '' . 
  compare lithuanian aik\u0161te - `` field '' , `` flat place '', 
  our alternate name , terra mariana or maarjamaa , means `` mary 's land '', 
  i 'll post a sample text for all to see :, 
  in veiat dainan ne ` gal, 
  pretty good , most of the ? s are of lithuanian origin . 
  in the second line , `` in veiat dainan '' is one word . 
  `` in '' means `` in '' in this case . 
  the other two are of lithuanian origin . 
  `` ortius '' is a verb ( base form ) . 
  compare the latin word for `` sunrise '', 
  e ` ipsa is `` to himself '' ( or actually `` for himself '' in this case ), 
  `` aiternam '' = `` eternity '' in accusative . 
  i do n't know how to express myself clearly , but that 3 word construct would be written as 1 word in my native language ( estonian ), 
  `` in '' is a preposition, 
  `` veiat '' is in locative, 
  `` dainan '' is in genitive, 
  almost all of my roots are derived from living languages . 
  `` g\u00fatim '' is accusative of `` g\u00fatis '' , which is taken from english `` good '' ( one of the few roots of english origin ), 
  `` kal\u00e9dus '' is accusative of `` kal\u00e9dos '' , which is taken from lithuanian `` kal\u0117dos '', 
  my conlang , roots are from living languages ( latin and lithuanian , mostly ), 
  acute accent marks vowel length , `` x '' is / ks / , `` y '' is / \u0268 / and the rest of the letters are as they are in ipa . 
  do you mean the etymology of all the words ? 
  from moon [ locative ] , i heard [ past simple 1st person singular ] pain [ accusative ] and ideal [ accusative ], 
  herself ( ja + met ) [ accusative ] , woman with complex [ dative ], 
  in my [ genitive ] garden [ locative ], 
  my [ genitive ] girl appeared [ past simple , 3rd person singular ] disoriented ( lit . 
  `` disdirected '' ), 
  secrets [ plural ] universe [ genitive ] and thought [ genitive ], 
  spark for [ this preposition has a lot of meaning , but in this context it is `` for '' ] development [ dative ] flowers [ genitive plural\u00ee ], 
  this [ short form of `` oxes '' , - es is added for emphasis ] is triumph, 
  i could add the etymologies and how i got to what i have aswell , if you 'd like . 
  is there a way to represent long vowels ? 
  i did this with writing the letter double . 
  looks pretty good , although this would look better done on paper rather than on a computer, 
  there is no `` early stage '' of estonian that is well attested that i can think of . 
  the first attested texts of estonian are from the 15th-16th century . 
  for texts before 19th century , it depends on whether the text is of the northern dialect or southern dialect . 
  with the northern dialects , i can understand it pretty well . 
  the ortography is different , consonants are sometimes written double when they should not . 
  also some words that are archaic , but for a more educated person this would not be a problem . 
  for southern dialects on the other hand , i can understand much less . 
  however someone who knows these dialects natively could probably understand a lot more . 
  i ca n't find any proto-finnic or proto-uralic texts , but i 'd like to try out these . 
  it varies a lot . 
  in simple sentences such as `` kysy minulta kysymys '' i can understand it perfectly . 
  but with more advanced sentences the understanding is medium-low . 
  i can get the overall theme of conversation but that 's it . 
  tourettes , i guess ? 
  i still have it , but it 's much much milder . 
  for 2 conlangs :, 
  1 ) '' \u00e4x\u00e4 '' - [ \u00e6x\u00e6 ] or [ \u00e6\u03c7\u00e6 ] , i have n't decided on whether it is a velar or an uvular , since i find it somewhat difficult to distinguish these myself . 
  but since the antonym for this is '' \u00e4h\u00e4 '' i think this would be better pronounced as an uvular fricative . 
  '' \u00e4 '' - `` emotion '' , `` feeling '', 
  `` x '' - `` negative '' , `` bad '', 
  '' \u00e4 '' - `` emotion '' , used as an intensifier, 
  derived from latin `` insanus '' , all adjectives end with - is . 
  b ) `` kvailis '' - / ` kvailis / , stress on the first syllable, 
  derived from lithuanian `` kvailai '' which means `` crazy '' , `` stupid '', 
  for 2 ) , they are synonyms . 
  could you provide an ipa ? 
  f.e is \u03b7 pronounced [ \u025b\u02d0 ] or [ i ] ? 
  there was already a thread on this , but i 'll post it in my other conlang . 
  the main idea was that morphemes are as small as they can be . 
  \u00e4 - emotion, 
  h - positive , so '' \u00e4h '' - `` happy '' , `` merry '' , `` good feeling '', 
  f - time, 
  y - filler so there are n't complex consonant clusters , also means `` emptiness '' but not in this case, 
  h - positive, 
  o - location , so `` fyho '' means holiday, 
  j - colour , apperance, 
  i - femininity , so `` ji '' includes `` feminine '' colours , purple , pink , but `` red '' in this case , so `` fyhoji '' is `` red holiday '' - christmas . 
  thanks . 
  [ \u00e6x\u00e6 ] - consonant is a voiceless velar fricative, 
  [ \u00e6\u03c7\u00e6 ] - consonant is a voiceless uvular fricative, 
  make something that is n't a nominative-accusative language . 
  ergative-absolutive for instance . 
  also , i would suggest to try out consonant mutations . 
  for phonology , i ` ve n't got much to say , i usually only add sounds that i can clearly pronounce and differentiate . 
  ( e.g a distinction between / h / and / \u0266 / is something i would never do ), 
  for my romlang , since that 's my most developed one . 
  elis - / ` elis / alice ( no / \u00e6 / ), 
  baskv\u00e9 - / bask 've : / basque country, 
  beir\u00fat - / beiru : t / beirut ( city ), 
  damaskus - / da ` maskus / damascus,
