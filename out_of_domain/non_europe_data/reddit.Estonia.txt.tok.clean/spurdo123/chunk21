  sernerdas :, 
  i asked cleverbot , he said `` serious nerd '' . 
  i just contracted that . 
  i 'm not sure . 
  this is the first word i created in the language . 
  probably influenced by estonian `` tagant '' , which means `` from the backside '' . 
  the language features an extensive locative case system , and i really like the exessive case . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl :, 
  it means `` land language '' ( m\u0101 + \u010d\u012bl ) , which is a very common endonym for finnic peoples . 
  not very original . 
  takanaa 's script is an abugida , so there is no real alphabetical order , but there is an order of consonants . 
  it goes like this :, 
  * / t\u02b0 /, 
  * / k\u02b2 /, 
  * / p\u02b2 /, 
  * / t\u02b2 /, 
  1 ) plain stops, 
  2 ) aspirated stops, 
  3 ) palatalised stops, 
  4 ) retroflex stops, 
  5 ) liquids , nasals , sibilants , fricatives, 
  6 ) semivowels, 
  the reason for the `` kpt '' ordering is because my native language ( estonian ) orders it like that . 
  ^ 1 - can be analysed as / \u0288 : / and / \u0288 / , respectively, 
  ^ 2 - commonly is voiceless : / \u03c7 / , also can be a trill : / \u0280 /, 
  note about ablative : many indo-european languages have fused it with other cases ( with the genitive in balto-slavic , i do n't know about others ) , but most notably armenian and albanian ( of modern languages ) still have it . 
  it 's not too common of a case . 
  and the uralic languages have a slightly different meaning for it ; it 's comparable to the delative ( i.e `` from on top '' ) , although the basic meaning of `` from '' can still apply . 
  also , for a fusional conlang , i would suggest an instrumental or comitative case , or some other non-adpositional way to mark instruments/company . 
  ( although the comitative ai n't too common either ), 
  what a weird map . 
  it 's before the dissolution of yugoslavia , but after the dissolution of czechoslovakia , however , czechoslovakia dissoluted after the dissolution of yugoslavia . 
  also , baltic states are independent , while belarus and ukraine are not . 
  this situation existed for only a brief period in august of 1991 . 
  if czechoslovakia were still united , that map would be valid for august 22-23 1991 , since estonia and latvia restored independence august 21 , ukraine became independent august 24 and belarus august 25 . 
  i 'm talking about the map u/mrsnail5 posted . 
  huh ? 
  classical latin does n't have an alveolar approximant , it has a trill . 
  it 's not `` wrong '' ; the english pronounciation is based off the ecclesiastical ( church ) pronounciation , where `` v '' is / v / , and `` ce '' , `` ci '' are / t\u0283e / , / t\u0283i / . 
  he was talking about the pronounciation of english speakers ; which is different from the pronounciation of classical latin speakers . 
  wrong for classical latin , yes , but not for ecclesiastical latin , which is a perfectly valid form of latin . 
  * say [ 2nd person singular imperative ] i [ allative ] that i no [ 3rd person singular present ] be [ present connegative ] crazy *, 
  * say onto i that i no be crazy *, 
  votic actually , but yes , this is a finnic conlang , more closer to estonian than finnish . 
  funnily enough , the orthography is actually influenced by livonian , which uses macrons for long vowels .

  about estonian dialects :, 
  mulgi and tarto are pretty much extinct , but v\u00f5ro is still quite strong . 
  there is also a dialect in saaremaa , but it 's often called an `` accent '' , since they are notorious for merging [ \u0264 ] ( '' \u00f5 '' ) and [ \u00f8 ] ( '' \u00f6 '' ) into [ \u00f8 ] . 
  livonian is also extinct , but there is a small revival ; there are about 40 non-native fluent speakers . 
  did you do it ? 
  yes , i did .
