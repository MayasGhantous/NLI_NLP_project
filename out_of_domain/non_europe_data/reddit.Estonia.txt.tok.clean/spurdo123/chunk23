  proto-finnic * jauho is a derivation from * jauhadak - `` to grind '' . 
  it 's worth noting that in f.e estonian , the verb and the noun have diverged somewhat ; the verb is `` jahvatama '' , and the noun is `` jahu '' . 
  votic is missing ; it is `` javo '' . 
  estonian : `` p\u00e4rak '' , most likely derived from `` p\u00e4ra '' - `` backside '' , from proto-finnic * per\u00e4 , from proto-finno-ugric * per\u00e4 . 
  also , `` aanus '' exists , which is a loan from latin , but is strictly medical . 
  `` p\u00e4rak '' is also somewhat medical , more colloquial terms would be `` sitaauk '' , `` perseauk '' ( lit . 
  `` shit hole '' , `` ass hole '' ) , or just simply `` perse '' ( `` ass '' ) . 
  but those may be somewhat vulgar aswell . 
  a more polite term would be `` tagumik '' , but it also refers to the buttocks as a whole . 
  it is derived from taga - , which means `` back - '' . 
  it is of uralic origin . 
  estonian : `` sinine '' , which is from proto-finnic * sininen , and has cognates in mordvinic languages , but is possibly of indo-iranic origin . 
  compare pashto \u0634\u064a\u0646 '' \u0161\u012bn '' `` blue '' . 
  it 's possibly a distant cognate through indo-iranic languages to russian '' \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 '' ,,
