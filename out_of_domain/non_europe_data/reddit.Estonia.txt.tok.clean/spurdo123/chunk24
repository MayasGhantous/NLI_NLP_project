  most dialects do n't use every single unit , so that 's why some overlap somewhat .

  about v\u00f5ro :, 
  as far as i can tell , it 's named after the rut of wolves :, 
  * radokuu has gotten its name because of the fact , that on that month is the rut of wolves ( a synonym that exists in standard estonian , otherwise i would n't understand the final word ) *, 
  alternative names in v\u00f5ro :, 
  `` susi '' is from proto-finnic * suci . 
  i ca n't find the etymology for rado/radu . 
  `` k\u00fc\u00fcndlekuu '' - after `` k\u00fc\u00fcnlap\u00e4ev '' - `` candle day '' ( k\u00fc\u00fcndlep\u00e4\u00e4v in v\u00f5ro ) , a holiday on the 2nd of feburary, 
  other names i can find , for standard estonian :, 
  `` k\u00fc\u00fcnal '' is from proto-norse * kundila , compare old swedish `` kyndil '' . 
  `` helmekuu '' - `` bead month '' , this is very similar to the finnish name . 
  `` radukuu '' - see above ; radu + kuu . 
  `` soes\u00f5idukuu '' - `` wolf 's riding month '' - i presume this refers to the wolf 's rut again . 
  `` s\u00f5it '' is derived from `` s\u00f5itma '' - `` to drive '' , which is ultimately from proto-finno-ugric * \u015boje . 
  `` kirbukuu '' - `` flea month '' . 
  `` kirp '' is finnic , cognate to finnish `` kirppu '', 
  hunt + kuu . 
  `` hunt '' is from low german `` hunt '' , or possibly an older loan from proto-germanic * hundaz . 
  i would expect that to only apply to ie languages , + a few coincidences . 
  in estonian , they are `` p\u00e4ike '' and `` poeg '' , respectively . 
  both start with p - , but that 's it . 
  a few interesting homonyms/homophones in estonian :, 
  `` silm '' , `` eye '' , and `` lamprey '' . 
  they both come from proto-finnic * silm\u00e4 , but `` lamprey '' declends a bit differently ; the genitive is `` silmu '' , but in `` eye '' it is `` silma '' . 
  in finnish these are seperate . 
  the word `` oak '' is finnic , but `` dam '' is a loan from low german `` dam '' , influenced also by german `` damm '' . 
  they declend differently aswell , the genitive of `` dam '' is `` tammi '' , and the genitive of `` oak '' is `` tamme '' . 
  they are both finnic , although `` payment , tax '' might be ultimately of indo-iranic origin , and are seperate in finnish , as noted by the different genitives once again ; the genitive of liver is `` maksa '' , and the genitive of `` payment , tax '' is `` maksu '' . 
  this is because estonian has lost many final-vowels in the nominative singular , while finnish has n't . 
  `` voor '' - a triple homonym/phone . 
  it means `` an oval hill formed under glacier ice '' ( there was an english term for this but i do n't know it ) , `` turn , round '' , and `` a row of vehicles '' . 
  `` hill '' is a loanword from finnish `` vuori '' and the genitive is `` voore '' . 
  `` round '' is of baltic origin , compare lithuanian `` vora '' , and the genitive is `` vooru '' . 
  `` a row of vehicles '' is from low german `` vore '' , and the genitive is `` voori '' . 
  probably not too interesting , since it 's not indigenous to europe . 
  a map of asia would be more interesting . 
  although , you could map europe by direction of the loan . 
  in estonian `` riis '' is from low german `` r\u012bs '' . 
  * but to.be.broken [ present singular ] i [ formal female 1st genitive ] - be heart-be odysseus [ sublative ] *, 
  * war [ 1st genitive ] mastermind , for.a.long.time [ augmentative ] - be someone.who.has.disappeared *, 
  * island [ superessive ] run [ present participle ] body.of.water [ inessive ] *, 
  * but be broken my heart to below odysseus *, 
  * war 's mastermind , for a long time is someone who has disappeared *, 
  * on an island , in running body of water *, 
  i do n't know much about greek mythology , what kind of 1st person pronoun would athena use ? 
  formal female ? 
  humble female ? 
  or a gender-neutral one ? 
  rice is n't as widespread as the potato in europe , but yeah , i get where you 're coming from . 
  it 's likely because he 's one of the few known internationally . 
  interesting how the month names are very similar in estonian , although sadly we no longer use the traditional names ( it would be extremely difficult to standardise aswell ), 
  august was known as `` l\u00f5ikuskuu '' ( cutting month ) and `` m\u00e4dakuu '' ( rotten month ) , among others . 
  although `` k\u00fclvikuu '' ( cognate to kylv\u00f6kuu ) refers to may , not august . 
  december was `` j\u00f5ulukuu '' ( christmas month ) , `` talvekuu '' ( winter month ) and a few others . 
  also , `` kesa '' still means `` fallow '' , summer is `` suvi '' , which is archaic in finnish . 
  estonian , supine / - ma infinitive ( form listed in dictionaries ) : `` lugema '' , from proto-finnic * lukedak , from proto-uralic * luke - . 
  the - da infinitive ( form used in most other finnic languages ) is `` lugeda '' . 
  votic : `` luk\u00f5a '' , same origin as estonian . 
  hungarian `` olvas '' ( to read ) is also the same origin . 
  a mountain has a relative height of over 200m , that 's the definition i was taught . 
  * while ( particle that forms adverbial participles ) to.be.honest [ present participle ] , [ endearing honorific ] you [ informal vocative ] , no [ 1st person singular ] to.be.bothered [ present singular ] i [ semi-formal masculine ] *, 
  * while being honest , o you , not bothered am i *, 
  what ? 
  absolutely not . 
  mafia was notable for its realism . 
  mafia 2 less so , but still .

  here 's `` p\u00f5drakasvataja '' ( translated from estonian : elk grower , or reindeer grower ) by ps troika . 
  the song heavily relies on puns , so it 's not a good candidate for translation , but i did it anyway . 
  here is the original text translated into english :, 
  * my brother is an elk grower/reindeer grower far-away in the north *, 
  * what shall i bring him for his birthday ? 
  * like always , i shall bring , i shall bring , i shall bring * or * like always , vodka , vodka , vodka *, 
  * my sister gathers moss for the elks/reindeers in the north *, 
  * what shall i bring her for her birthday ? 
  * my uncle puts down trackbed bars far-away in the north * - the pun is `` liipreid '' ( trackbed bars ) vs `` liitreid '' ( litres ) ( i.e `` he puts down litres '' - `` he drinks '' ), 
  * what shall i bring him for his birthday ? 
  * my fathers other brother is a millionaire on alaska *, 
  * what shall he bring me for my birthday ?
