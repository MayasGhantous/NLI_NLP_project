  yep , it will take some time , but it ( along with the greek alphabet ) are quite easy to learn compared to anything else , since they are closely related to the latin alphabet , and have very similar structure . 
  something like armenian should n't be that hard aswell , although the letter shapes there are more distant from latin . 
  / ` p\u02b0\u0259 ` ta ' \u0259t\u0259pu\u0281utus /, 
  * and you [ informal ] , brutus [ vocative ] ? 
  the vocative is the only case indicated by a prefix - \u0259t\u0259 - , which is derived from one of the 2nd person pronouns . 
  foreign names are changed to fit the phonology/grammar , much like latvian . 
  ( for example : estonian `` andrus kivir\u00e4hk '' becomes latvian `` andruss kivirehks '' ),

  there are 2 ways to make a map like this :, 
  a ) where the languages are spoken . 
  b ) where the languages are official . 
  b is heck of a lot easier to map . 
  this map accomplishes none of these :, 
  * 1 ) ireland has 2 official languages : irish and english . 
  * 2 ) scottish gaelic is official in ( parts of ) scotland ( i think ), 
  * 3 ) wales has 2 official languages : welsh and english . 
  * 4 ) basque ( a language isolate , or part of the vasconic family ) is official in basque county . 
  * 5 ) switzerland is multi-lingual . 
  * 6 ) swedish is an official language of finland, 
  * 7 ) german is an official language of south tyrol, 
  * 8 ) various sami languages are official in norway , sweden , finland . 
  ( notably not russia ), 
  also i would suggest keeping borders , and marking subborders . 
  also distinguishing language families . 
  in this map subbranches are marked for indo-european , uralic and afroasiatic languages , but not for turkic languages . 
  turkish is of the ( western ) oghuz branch . 
  i like diacritics better than digraphs , so i would use something like \u0161 and \u010d ( like in slavic ) , or \u015b and \u0107 ( easier diacritics ), 
  although a few natlangs ( most notably votic ) use \u0161 and t\u0161 for these sounds , respectively . 
  not using diacritics , i would use `` x '' for / \u0283 / and `` tx '' for / t\u0283 / . 
  * victory-be say [ agentive participle apulative plural ] , say [ plural present ] who [ non-interrogative plural ] : `` i [ formal male apudessive ] - be victory-be '' . 
  succeed [ gerund-supine-infinitive ] - be say [ agentive particple apulative plural ] , be.able.to [ present plural ] say [ prospective present plural ] who [ non-interrogative plural ] : `` succeed [ far-future singular ] i [ formal male ] , say [ present plural ] and end [ inessive singular ] : `` succeed [ past singular ] i [ formal male ] *, 
  * victory is to next to the sayers , say who : `` next to me is victory is '' . 
  succeeding is to next to the sayers , are able to about to say who : `` will succeed i '' , say and in the end : `` succeeded i '' *, 
  the far-future tense ( along with the near-future tense ) is a rarely used literary tense , extremely formal . 
  i 'd say that west country dialects are more conservative than ga. 
  `` english accent '' in popular use almost always refers to rp , yes . 
   loyalty to governments is called mental retardation, 
  i seriously hope that you meant imperialistic governments like the soviet union by that . 
  sernerdas has recieved multible spelling reforms , so the modern orthography is quite regular . 
  although there are multible irregularities with the letter `` i '' . 
  it can represent :, 
  * a ) the phoneme / i / , which it does in most cases, 
  * b ) the phoneme / j / , which is also represented by `` j '' . 
  for example : the 1st person singular past form of the verb `` to dream '' is ** svai\u00f3jau ** - / sva ` jo : j\u0250u / . 
  one / j / is represented by `` i '' , the other by `` j '' . 
  * c ) palatalising the previous consonant . 
  this is also done with `` j '' in only a few cases , mostly when the following vowel is / i / . 
  examples : ** sjv\u0113res ** / 's \u02b2ve : res / `` beast '' , ** siaistia ** - / 's \u02b2\u0250is\u02b2t\u02b2a / `` wound '' , ** sjin\u014dti ** / s\u02b2i ` no : ti / `` to learn '', 
  the letter `` b '' can also represent both / b / and / p / word-initially - the latter is a very recent sound change . 
  at first glance , the letter `` o '' might seem irregular , but it 's actually completely regular ; it 's :, 
  * a ) / ` uo / when stressed, 
  * b ) / u / when unstressed, 
  * c ) a similar letter - \u014d ( or sometimes \u00f3 ) represents / o : /, 
  a few words , namely `` ospitalas '' ( `` hospital '' ) and `` cinema '' ( `` cinema '' , `` movie theatre '' ) have various pronounciations :, 
  * a ) / upi ` talas / - this is the initial pronounciation , since the word is a loan from french ( the original latin word was not inherited , otherwise the word would be * ospit\u0101le , and neuter , instead of masculine ( the - as is a dead give-away for a recent loanword ) ), 
  * b ) / uspi ` talas / - penultimate stress ; a more conservative pronounciation, 
  * c ) / ` uospitalas / - initial stress, 
  cinema :, 
  * a ) / ` sinema / - the initial pronounciation when loaned from french . 
  * b ) / ` tsinema / - hypercorrection ; `` c '' usually represents / ts /, 
  * c ) / ` kinema / - a more conservative pronounciation, 
  * while [ particle that forms adverbial participles ] - be be [ present participle ] - be chaos [ 1st genitive ] , also-be opportunity-be *, 
  * while is being is of chaos , also is opportunity is *, 
  a few in sernerdas ( a conservative fusion of balto-slavic and classical latin ) :,
