  ** m\u016bnas ** - `` man '' , compare to english `` man '' . 
  there is a possibility of it being a loan from proto-germanic , but the / u : / instead of / a / is unexplained , and the added - as masculine ending is unusual for older loans . 
  a more likely theory is metathesis from a latin word - either homo-homin - , or `` h\u016bm\u0101nus '' . 
  dialectal `` im\u016bn '' , `` im\u016bna '' , `` imuna '' , `` imunas '' , etc also support the metathesis theory . 
  ** armas ** - `` arm '' , most likely derived from the verb `` armeri '' - `` to equip '' , `` to use '' , from latin `` armo '' - `` to furnish with weapons '' , `` to arm '' . 
  however , it was still likely influenced by proto-germanic * armaz . 
  ** akta ** - `` persecution '' , `` banishment '' . 
  compare to english `` act '' . 
  this is most likely a loan from proto-germanic * anht\u014d . 
  old english '' \u014dht '' comes from this , but no modern english words do . 
  sernerdas :, 
  yes , they are extremely common . 
  some clusters are palatalised . 
  some are in seperate syllables , some are not . 
  for example :, 
  * ** tuscis ** / ` tustsis / - `` empty '' , `` void '', 
  nope . 
  the syllable structure is strictly ( v ) cv ( c ) . 
  * do [ present singular ] to.correct [ infinitive-supine-gerund ] much [ accusative ] , do [ present singular ] but to.be.brave [ causative present ] more [ accusative ] *, 
  * does correcting much , does but making being brave more *, 
  basic words are shared between language families . 
  e.g english is indo-european , so it shares some very basic words with most of the languages of europe , iran and northern india . 
  finnish , estonian and hungarian are part of the uralic family , so they share some basic words as well ( hungarian is still very distantly related to the finnic languages , comparable to swedish vs bengali . 
  * finnish and estonian `` k\u00e4si '' vs hungarian `` k\u00e9z '' - `` hand '', 
  * finnish and estonian `` j\u00e4\u00e4 '' vs hungarian `` j\u00e9g '' - `` ice '', 
  * finnish `` p\u00e4\u00e4 '' , estonian `` pea '' vs hungarian `` fej '' , `` f\u0151 '' - `` head '', 
  * finnish and estonian `` vesi '' vs hungarian `` v\u00edz '' - `` water '' . 
  the interesting thing about this is it 's possibly a very old loan from indo-european . 
  ( or some claim it to be nostratic or evidence of a common indo-uralic origin , which is a fringe theory ) . 
  english `` human '' is unrelated to german `` mensch '' . 
  it comes from latin `` humanus '' ( `` humane '' ) , from `` homo '' ( `` man '' ) , from proto-indo-european * \u01f5\u02b0m\u1e53 , whence also old lithuanian '' \u017emuo '' , whence modern lithuanian '' \u017emogus '' , and also irish `` duine '' . 
  german `` mensch '' is a cognate to english `` man '' , although it 's a derivation . 
  a better comparison would be to use german `` mann '' . 
  bengali `` manush '' does seem to be a cognate , yes . 
  bengali `` haat '' also seems to be unrelated to english `` hand '' . 
  i also live in the middle of nowhere ; the nearest settlement is 6-7km away , but i can only barely see the milky way . 
  that 's crazy . 
  where i 'm from ( estonia ) nearly everywhere is 100 miles ( 161km ) of a large town ( either tallinn - 400k , or tartu - 100k ) . 
  although there should still be very good darkspots , i happen to live quite close to the capital ( ~ 80km = 50 miles ) . 
  edit : that definitely seems ridiculous :, 
  [ this ] ( http://www.inquinamentoluminoso.it/worldatlas/pages/fig4.htm ) shows that there is still 1 place where there 's a darkspot ; western saaremaa . 
  and about 40-50km from tallinn , the colour is already blue , the 3rd lowest . 
  low german and high german way more different than dutch and flemish . 
  they are in completely different branches of the west germanic branch , while dutch and flemish are n't . 
  i think he means that montenegro was n't a country before 2006 . 
  * do [ present singular ] you [ informal ] what [ non-interrogative accusative ] , ( 2nd person particle that forms questions with the expected answer of `` no '' ) stab [ present singular ] you [ informal ] i [ informal gender-neutral accusative ] *, 
  * do you what , stab you me ? 
  for me this would be a very old dialect of estonian . 
  most likely very difficult to reconstruct , since the first comprehensive texts are from the 16th century . 
  mainly the wanradt-koell catechism . 
  although you can still deduce many things , e.g that the proto-finnic * - pi for 3rd person singular present was `` p '' , and not modern `` b '' . 
  although this might be a quirk of the orthography used . 
  also , the [ \u0264 ] sound-shift likely was n't complete , since it 's written with the proto-finnic vowel in some instances :, 
  * `` nynda '' vs modern `` n\u00f5nda '' ; compare votic `` nintaa '', 
  * `` wothkat '' vs modern `` v\u00f5tke '' , compare finnish `` ottakaa '', 
  many times , it 's written with '' \u00f6 '' , which is how [ \u0264 ] was written until the 19th century . 
  e.g :, 
  * '' \u00f6nnis '' vs modern '' \u00f5nnis '', 
  also , the negative verb still conjugated for person in the non-imperative ; `` eb '' can be seen , instead of the modern `` ei '' . 
  the - n genitive , like in finnish , can also be seen : `` sen issan '' instead of modern `` selle isa '' , and `` surman leha '' instead of modern `` surma liha '' . 
  [ e ] -  [ \u0264 ] in words with back vowel harmony . 
  [ o ] -  [ \u0264 ] . 
  this change is more varied , and is most fully done in votic . 
  e.g proto-finnic * korva ( `` ear '' ) becomes finnish `` korva '' , votic `` k\u00f5rva '' , estonian `` k\u00f5rv '' . 
  but proto-finnic * kota ( `` house '' ) becomes finnish `` kota '' , estonian `` koda '' , and votic `` k\u00f5ta '' . 
  also , it can correspond to proto-finnic [ \u0251 ] . 
  proto-finnic * sana ( `` word '' ) becomes finnish `` sana '' , votic `` s\u00f5na '' , estonian `` s\u00f5na '' . 
  from the examples in my post above , pf * korkeda ( `` high '' ) becomes finnish `` korkea '' , votic `` k\u00f5rk\u00f5a '' , estonian `` k\u00f5rge '' , but northeastern estonian `` korge '' and southern estonian `` korge '' or `` korg\u00f5 '' . 
  in my finnic conlang m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , this change is even more extensive than votic . 
  e.g pf * pimed\u00e4 yields votic `` pimi\u00e4 '' , but m\u0101\u010d\u012bl `` pim\u00f5da '' . 
  * i [ adessive ] be [ 3rd person singular present ] jar [ inessive ] dirt [ partitive ] !, 
  * on me is in jar dirt !, 
  it 's a well known fact that that is the oldest comprehensive estonian text , so i just googled it in estonian ( wanradt-koelli katekismus ) . 
  although , more generally , i do n't really know . 
  proto-finnic * uksi is possibly a baltic loan ; compare lithuanian `` uoksas '' - `` opening '' , `` cavity '' . 
  also , proto-samic * uks\u00eb is related . 
  the map has the sami languages descending from proto-finnic , which is not the case . 
  other finnic languages :, 
  also , finnish has archaic `` uksi '' , like u/tilakattila mentioned . 
  just avoid [ \u00f0 ] , [ \u03b8 ] and [ \u0279 ] , which are uncommon sounds that exist in english . 
  if you have wildly different phonotactics , then it wo n't sound much like english anyway . 
  sure , but it 's just a rare sound . 
  define `` immigrants '' . 
  ~ 25 % of the population of estonia came here after 1950 . 
  legendaries at lower levels are pretty much useless , since they get obsoleted very quickly . 
  but cool nonetheless , i got a hellfire at ~ lvl11 on my recent playthrough from scorch , during the mission . 
  takanaa generally uses pronouns for both , although honorifics are used aswell . 
  pronouns usually indicate social status first , familiarity second . 
  there are 4 grades of 2nd person pronouns :, 
  * informal ( higher to lower ; also the one used between friends ) - ** ta ** / ` ta /, 
  * semi-formal ( between equals ; also between people who do n't know eachother ) - ** \u0259ta ** / ' \u0259ta /, 
  * formal ( medium to high ; low to medium ) - ** \u0259tun ** / ' \u0259tun /, 
  * very formal ( low to high ) - ** \u0259tina ** / ' \u0259tina /, 
  honorifics are more varied . 
  they are generally used to indicate humbleness and politeness . 
  f.e you would say ** \u0259s \u0259ta ** ( polite honorific + semiformal 2nd person pronoun ) to someone who you do n't know very well , but hope to become friends soon , but you would say ** x\u0259\u015bak \u0259ta ** ( very polite honorific + semi-formal pronoun ) to someone who you do n't know much about and probably wo n't meet again , but wa n't to be polite . 
  there are no gendered pronouns , but there are gendered honorifics . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl generally has no system that represents familiarity/social-standing . 
  the traditional t-v distinction , that exists in the neighbouring languages russian and estonian , is ignored . 
  so , you use the singular 2nd person pronoun - ** \u0161in\u00e4 ** / ' \u0283in\u00e6 / for everyone .
