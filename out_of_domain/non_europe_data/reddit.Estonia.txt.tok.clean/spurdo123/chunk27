  the 2nd person plural - ** t\u00f5\u00f5 ** / ` t\u0264 : / is only used for groups of people . 
  the genitive can take on other meanings , besides possession . 
  e.g in balto-slavic languages , the genitive case marks a negative direct object . 
  in estonian , the genitive case takes on various adpositions . 
  e.g : `` over the fence '' - * \u00fcle aia * - over fence [ genitive ], 
  in takanaa there are 2 copulas , the infinitives are :, 
  * ** \u015bagaak ** / \u0283a ` k\u02b2ak /, 
  the first one is suffixed as - ( a ) \u015b in the present tense , so e.g to say `` the ball is blue '' , you would say :, 
  * blue-be ball-be *, 
  the second one is used for weaker relationships ; e.g `` the ball is sort of blue '' , or `` the ball is blue-ish '' , you would say :, 
  * be blue ball *, 
  nope , takanaa is a priori . 
  something interesting about `` sarv '' in estonian ;, 
  there are 2 words , which also share the same root , but are borrowed from different stages :, 
  ** hirv ** `` deer '' - from baltic , \u0161 -  h is a regular change in finnic languages . 
  ** k\u00f5rv ** `` ear '' - possibly an early indo-european loan , before satemisation . 
  ** reddit - internet\u012b esile\u0161ti **, 
  * reddit - internet [ genitive ] front-page *, 
  * madam , i can [ 1st person singular present ] be [ infinitive ] drunk , but tomorrow be [ 1st person singular present ] i sober , and you be [ 2nd person singular present ] still ugly *, 
  i had some trouble with deadlift in uvhm at first aswell . 
  just get a good shock weapon , be patient , and do n't rush it . 
  while takanaa is agglutinative ; it has quite short roots and words , and there are generally no compound words . 
  the longest roots that exist , are 10-letter verbs , prefixed with ** a\u015bu - ** ( forms antonyms ) :, 
  e.g ** a\u015butup\u0259naak ** / a\u0283utup\u0259 ` nak / - `` to make amends '' , `` to correct '', 
  the longest form derived from that would be ** a\u015bunilipa\u015butup\u0259nakanaa\u015bama\u015b ** / a\u0283unilipa\u0283utup\u0259naka ` na\u0283ama\u0283 / , which is the plural exessive of the passive frequentative gerund - `` from frequently being made amends to '' . 
  the plural desublative , plural elative , and plural delative are also the same length . 
  morpheme by morpheme :, 
  * ** a\u015bu ** - in this case forms the circumfix for the exessive , along with ** - aa\u015bam **, 
  * ** n ** - filler phoneme , because there are no diphthongs and the next affix begins with a vowel, 
  * ** ili ** - forms frequentative verbs, 
  * ** p ** - forms passive verbs , in this case `` p '' instead of `` pa '' , because the verb starts with a vowel, 
  * ** a\u015bu ** - in this case forms antonyms, 
  * ** tup\u0259n ** - root for the verb : `` to err '' , `` to make mistakes '', 
  * ** ak ** - forms the infinitive-gerund-supine . 
  * ** an ** - forms the 3rd genitive , onto which locative suffixes are attached, 
  * ** aa\u015bam ** - forms the exessive case , along with ** a\u015bu - **, 
  * ** a\u015b ** - forms the plural, 
  uhh , estonian distinguishes these , i 'm pretty sure . 
  although / p / is often aspirated in word-initial position by many , i pronounce it unaspirated . 
  for example :, 
  * `` l\u00f5pu '' - [ ` l\u0264pu ] - `` end '' [ genitive ] vs :, 
  * `` l\u00f5bu '' - [ ` l\u0264b\u0325u ] - `` fun '', 
  the distinction is between voiceless stops and slack voiceless stops . 
  in takanaa :, 
  / t / , / t\u02b2 / , / t\u02b0 / , / t\u02b7 / , / t\u02b2\u02b7 / , / t\u02b0\u02b7 / , / \u0288 / and / \u0256 / . 
  these distinctions also exist for / p / and / k / , except the retroflex consonants . 
  although labialised stops only exist in placenames and loanwords . 
  examples :, 
  * ** ka ** / ` ka / `` due to '' , `` because of '' vs ** xa ** / ` k\u02b0a / `` fire '' , `` danger '' vs ** xua ** / ` k\u02b0\u02b7a / `` might '' , `` power '' vs ** ga ** / ` k\u02b2a / `` also known as '' , `` also '' vs ** kua ** / ` k\u02b7a / `` strategy '', 
  what do you mean ? 
  well , they are , but they just sound similar to the alveolar stops . 
  from my personal experience , normal mode was a bit easy , tvhm was great , it was quite challenging , and it forced me to change my playstyle a lot . 
  have n't tried uvhm yet . 
  is / \u0256 / without / d / a rare occurence ? 
  takanaa has only 2 voiced consonants : / \u0256 / and / \u0281 / .

  i love having definiteness as an optional feature , because i personally tend to forget about it often , and it 's useful to have a way to emphasise something very easily . 
  takanaa has an optional definite article that evolved from the distal demonstrative :, 
  ** tu ** / ` tu / in singular ; ** tu\u015b ** / ` tu\u0283 / in plural . 
  it is placed before the noun , and only inflects for number ( which is common ) . 
  example :, 
  ** iti\u015b tu k\u0259xatata\u015b , siluti ut ** - * this-be the [ definite article ] weapon-be , use [ past singular ] that * - * this is the weapon is , used he * ( note : the distal demonstrative is used as a 3rd person pronoun ), 
  1 ) using the 1st person singular semi-formal masculine ( or feminine , if the speaker is female ) pronoun everywhere . 
  2 ) using the 2nd person singular informal pronoun everywhere ( as it implies the speaker is of a higher or of the same standing as the listener ), 
  3 ) using honorifics , that imply that the speaker is of a higher standing than the listener . 
  e.g :, 
  ** \u015aakat\u0259 duk , i\u015b\u0259t \u015bakat\u0259 ax\u0259 ta ** / ' \u0283akat\u0259 ` t\u02b2uk ` i\u0283\u0259t ' \u0283akat\u0259 ` ak\u02b0\u0259 ` ta / * know [ present singular ] i [ semi-formal masculine ] , no [ 2nd person singular ] know [ present singular ] ( senior -  junior honorific ) you [ 2nd person singular informal ] *, 
  interesting that armenian , latin and lithuanian were all influenced by their respective verbs for `` to lick '' . 
  estonian :, 
  food : `` toit '' and `` s\u00f6\u00f6k '' . 
  * `` toit '' is derived from the verb `` toitma '' - `` to feed '' , which is finnic , a cognate to votic `` toittaa '' . 
  related to `` toibuma '' - `` to recover '' , which is a cognate to finnish `` toipua '' . 
  * `` s\u00f6\u00f6k '' is derived from the verb `` s\u00f6\u00f6ma '' - `` to eat '' , which is from proto-finnic * s\u00f6\u00f6d\u00e4k , from proto-uralic * sewe - . 
  apparently it 's an indo-iranian loan , but ety mentions nothing of the sort . 
  the - k suffix is likely a cognate to finnish - kki , from proto-finnic * - kkei . 
  chair : - `` tool '' , a loan from middle low german `` st\u014dl '' , ultimately from proto-germanic * st\u014dlaz . 
  the livonian order was in no way whatsoever latvian , they were german . 
  the latvians and estonians were serfs . 
  something interesting : latvian `` jauns '' is a cognate to english `` young '' ( through proto-germanic ) , and `` juvenile '' ( through latin ) . 
  other finnic languages :, 
  lithuanian also has ** jaunas ** , which means `` young '' , so probably not . 
  they are related . 
  in karelian `` saksa '' means `` rich person '' , which is odd , since they never had a german aristocracy . 
  it 's a proto-norse loan , and has meanings other than `` german '' in estonian , livonian , karelian and izhorian .
