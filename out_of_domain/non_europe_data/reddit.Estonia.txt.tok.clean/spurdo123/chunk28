  the original meaning of `` breath '' has been somewhat lost in the estonian word , although it remains in derivations : `` hingama '' ( to breathe ) , `` hinget\u00f5mme '' ( breath ) ( lit . 
  `` a pull of the soul '' ) . 
  denmark is irrelevant . 
  they held small parts of estonia , but the main players were the teutonic and livonian orders , and then later sweden ( but the german aristocracy persisted ) . 
  there was some animosity against germans , mainly before ww1 , but after the independence war and ww2 , it flipped around to the ( now communist ) russians . 
  even though the germans have probably caused us more harm than the russians , although they ruled for ~ 600 years , and the russians only for ~ 50 , or for ~ 100 , if counting the late russian empire after the abolition of serfdom . 
  yes . 
  i can translate both english and french songs into sernerdas quite easily , since it is indo-european ( heavily latinised baltic ) . 
  i 've only translated estonian songs into m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , and it works great , since finnic languages are even more closely related . 
  i 've translated 1 estonian song into takanaa , and it 's very difficult to sing , because the phonotactics are wildly different . 
  comparison :, 
  a theoretical native speaker would probably sing much faster to compensate , but i ca n't do it . 
  i 've translated english translations of originally french songs . 
  there were hostilities . 
  in the 1220s the danes and germans fought each other , but formed a truce in 1238 . 
  nope . 
  it 's probably from baltic , compare lithuanian * siela * , in line with * taivas * also being a baltic loan . 
  the similarity to germanic languages is then coincidental , or if it is a germanic loan , then the even closer similarity to baltic languages is coincidental . 
  estonian is my native language . 
  ( see my flair ), 
  well , it 's really easy to become fluent in english , since it 's the * lingua franca * of the internet . 
  if it was e.g lithuanian , i 'd be just as fluent in lithuanian . 
  a ) a * lingua franca * is a common language that 's spoken between people with different native languages . 
  the most widely spoken modern * lingua franca * is of course english . 
  latin was a * lingua franca * throughout the roman empire , russian is one in parts of the former soviet union , and etc. 
  b ) lithuanian is probably my most favourite language .

  is there something inherently bad with xenophobia ? 
  why should we be tolerant towards people who :, 
  a ) do n't assimilate ( i.e remain in their own bubble ), 
  b ) do n't learn the state language ( estonian ), 
  most people are n't `` xenophobic '' towards russians who do speak estonian and have assimilated . 
  i 'd bring up an analogy in africa but i can only think of south africa , and the whites there have lived there far longer than russians have in estonia . 
  sankrit : v\u1e5bka, 
  which form is more `` ancient '' ? 
  with or without - s ? 
  someone decided that the form with - s. 
  well , the lithuanian form is more conservative , because in terms of the ending it has only underwent 1 sound change : * - os -  - as ( - o -  - a ) , while sanskrit has underwent 2 : * - os -  - as -  - a.

  very interesting . 
  what would the map look like if bessarabia is included ? 
  the 3-way distinction between moldavia , transylvania and wallachia is almost perfectly seen here , except for the easternmost part of wallachia and dobrogea . 
  i 'll answer the 3rd question . 
  nobody really cares . 
  the president is mainly a ceremonial post with no real power .
