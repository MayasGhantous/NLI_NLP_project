  there are seperate roots for 1-8 , 128 ( * akak * ) , and 8192 ( * akakasak * ) ( 16 eights and 1024 eights ; the last only gained a solid definition in the modern era ) . 
  the rest are derived . 
  e.g 80 is * k\u0259takasapukakasil * - 2 eights after eight eights .

  the map ( and the other one op posted ) does n't seem to have the regions for estonia/latvia/lithuania . 
  also , not for bosnia , croatia and slovenia . 
  every other country seems to be normal . 
  the map seems to use the first-level divisions ( i.e us states , uk countries ) . 
   what 's your source for this ? 
  it also gives a possibility of a baltic origin : proto-baltic * a\u012bsto - / , * a\u012bst ( e ) r `` land '' , `` field '' . 
  the specific form of `` estonia '' in english is from latin , the estonian form of `` eesti '' is from ( baltic ) german . 
  stripe it germanic/baltic then . 
  also sometimes in the singular : * valimine *, 
  it is the gerund ( a.k.a - mine action noun ) of * valima * - `` to pick '' , `` to choose '' , from proto-germanic * waljan , cognate to german `` w\u00e4hlen '' . 
  which means it 's a ( indirect ) cognate to german `` wahl '' . 
  well , the germanic origin is more plausible and is usually cited , but the baltic theory should be represented . 
  i would suggest 2 colours for a mixed origin , and stripes for uncertainty with 2 + theories , or whatever , to represent multible theories for an origin . 
  / k / -  / t\u0283 / is a very common sound change before front vowels ( examples : the romance languages , votic ) . 
  it 's noteworthy . 
  also , `` cold '' comes from the dialectal `` cald '' ( with a / k / ) , not oe '' \u010beald '' . 
  uhh , i did n't . 
  i just said that the `` c '' in that word represented / k / . 
  because `` c '' has very different pronounciations depending on the language . 
  i wanted to emphasise the fact that it started with a / k / . 
  what do the vowels with macrons represent ? 
  archaic speech in sernerdas :, 
  pronouncing `` o '' ( and a few `` u `` s ) as / o / : ( this results in original * us being pronounced as / os / , which is a newer soundchange , which then recently reduced back to / us / . ), 
  pronouncing / h / if the word starts with a vowel . 
  this is hypercorrection in most cases , but a few cases , such as * onur * / ` uonur / -  * honor * / ` honor / `` honour '' have it right . 
  never using periphrasis , which is quite common in many dialects . 
  e.g :, 
  always * vilka * , never * de vilk * ( genitive of * vilkas * `` wolf '' ), 
  final / n / -  / m / ( ultimately also hypercorrection in many words ), 
  * vulpen * / ` vulpen / -  * vulpem * / ` vulpem / `` fox '' ( accusative singular ), 
  / u / is never reduced to / i / ( this is only sporadically indicated in writing ) , so * sin * / ` sin / -  * sum * / ` sum / - `` 1st person singular form of `` to be '' ), 
  the endings / ` kes / and / ` ks / are switched . 
  so `` ox '' / ` uoks / becomes / ` hokes / `` this '' , from latin * hoc * plus the emphatic - es . 
  `` l\u016bkes '' / ` lu : kes / becomes / ` lu : ks / `` light '' , from latin * lux * . 
  no palatalisation , so * siaistia * / 's \u02b2\u0250is\u02b2t\u02b2a / becomes / ` siaistia / `` wound '', 
  sov word order . 
  full use of the instrumental case , use of less commonly used prepositions , and loss of all contractions . 
  so e.g * met tetiae ` ma * / ` met ` tet\u02b2\u0250ima / becomes * s\u016b tet\u0101 man\u0101 * / ` su : ` teta : ` mana : / `` with my aunt '', 
  / \u0268 / -  / i : / , which is hypercorrection in many cases . 
  e.g * skaityti * / s\u02b2k\u02b2\u0250i ` t\u0268ti / becomes / skai ` ti : ti / `` to read '' , which is the correct old form , while * mycas * / 'm \u0268t\u02b2s\u02b2as / becomes / ` mi : tsas / `` hat '' , which is a loan from either low or high german , possibly through estonian , where the original vowel was / y / . 
  use of more archaic vocabulary . 
  e.g * vandon * / van ` duon / in the standard language only refers to the water you drink , but in archaic use it 's used for water in other contexts . 
  also * merkinas * / ` merkinas / means `` breakfast '' in the modern language , but in archaic language means `` morning '' . 
  in estonian , the word * sade * exists , but it 's usually used in scientific contexts and means `` precipitation '' . 
  it 's derived from the verb * sadama * `` to rain '' , which is a very common verb . 
  another derivation * sadu * `` rainfall '' , '' - fall '' exists , and it 's more commonly used . 
  ( usually in compound words , such as * vihmasadu * `` rainfall '' , and * lumesadu * `` snowfall '' . 
  in estonian colloquial language the words * k\u00fcte * , * k\u00fcts * and * k\u00fctus * are also used , which are derived from the verb * k\u00fctma * `` to fuel '' , which is ultimately from proto-finno-ugric * k\u00fc\u010de - . 
  possibly an early indo-iranian loan , from proto-indo-iranian * a\u01f5ya . 
  i dislike this argument . 
  you could say the same thing about finnic languages , that they are a mix of finno-ugric , germanic and a bit of baltic , since nearly 40 % -50 % of the common vocabulary is of germanic origin . 
  ( a bit less in finnish , a bit more in estonian , afaik ) , and a few grammatical features have been influenced by germanic languages . 
  e.g :, 
  * tenses are analogous to germanic ones . 
  present , past , and perfect , pluperfect , which are formed using the copula + a participle . 
  no future however . 
  * use of a copula verb . 
  * adjectives agree with nouns . 
  many languages have been influenced by their neighbours . 
  way too similar imo . 
  idioms would likely change a lot . 
  a 2nd person plural pronoun would probably arise , likely a reduced form of * you guys * , e.g something like / ` j\u0259g\u0259s / . 
  the 1st person singular nominative would probably be descended from * me * , as seen in modern * me and john * . 
  i do n't believe the orthography would change that much . 
  yes , germany did control over 50 % of modern poland , but the majority of pre-partition poland was in fact in russia . 
  i would suggest :, 
  vowels :, 
  a e o u i \u00e4 \u00fc y, 
  consonants :, 
  this is i.e what hungarian does , since you do n't want '' \u0161 '' . 
  it 's worth noting that pie * wed - is most likely related to proto-uralic * wete . 
  it 's likely a loan from pie , although some have argued a nostratic or indo-uralic origin . 
   read the title mate . 
  i 'm talking about english names of countries , not native names . 
  technically it 's still ultimately from * crna gora * , since `` montenegro '' is a calque from it . 
  hungarian * h\u00e1z * is possibly a really old loanword and is probably a wanderwort . 
  it 's a cognate to finnish * kota * `` hut '' and estonian * koda * `` dwelling '' . 
  compare persian * kad * `` house '' , turkish * kodak * `` home '' , ainu * kotan * `` village '' . 
  where are the exact spots ? 
  thanks , this sounds good . 
  i grinded slayer for 100cb , because that 's one of the reqs for western provinces hard . 
  and i 'm using `` skiller '' figuratively . 
  thanks , i 'll check it out . 
  in sernerdas :, 
  `` c '' is / ts / , `` y '' is / \u0268 / . 
  i could represent `` c '' with just `` ts '' , but it 's more convenient . 
  in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl :, 
  `` c '' is / ts / , `` y '' is n't used . 
  i use '' \u00fc '' instead of `` y '' like in finnish for / y / for consistency with '' \u00e4 '' and '' \u00f6 '' . 
  in takanaa :, 
  neither are used . 
  i could use `` c '' for / \u0283 / instead of '' \u015b '' , and `` y '' for / \u0259 / instead of '' \u0259 '' .
