  deli n\u00f3vis - / ` deli ` no : vis / new delhi, 
  j\u00e1pan / i\u00e1pan - / ` ja : pan / japan ( both are correct , `` j '' is only written at the beginning of words ), 
  marsei - / mar ` sei / marseille, 
  muh\u00e1med - / mu ` ha : med / muhammed, 
  articles . 
  they inflect in 6 cases ( nom.acc. , gen. , loc. , dat. , voc . 
  ) , 3 numbers ( singular , dual , plural ) and 2 genders ( common , neuter ) . 
  both definitive and indefinite . 
  and they are n't even required , i only added them to spruce up the language and for poetry . 
  rest of the language is pretty regular . 
  5 noun declensions ( 4 in neuter , 1 in common , can tell from the noun ) and 2 verb conjugations , but you ca n't tell which one it is from the verb itself . 
  was n't pvp armour polled and rejected ? 
  ca n't remember though . 
  there are definite and indefinite pairs . 
  `` la '' and `` los '' are the definite articles in nominative . 
  ( common/neuter respectively ) and `` un '' and `` os '' are the indefinite articles in nominative . 
  ( common/neuter ), 
  i 'll only post the singular forms , posting dual and plural would make it too long . 
  accusative : most common is - m suffix , but also - us and - a. 
  genitive : most common is - n suffix , but also - u , - ae and - a ( w / apophony ), 
  locative : this is basically a prepositional case for locations , like `` in '' , `` from '' , `` far from '' , `` until '' but also to represent composition . 
  most common suffix is - t but also - a. 
  dative : this case also uses prepositions , i originally also had an instrumental case , but i merged it with this one so this case represents the traditional dative , instrumental and comitative . 
  e.g `` met '' is used as both a comitative and instrumental preposition . 
  this case is fused with accusative in the neuter gender , so the preposition `` per '' along with the noun in accusative is used to represent the dative form . 
  most common is - u suffix . 
  vocative : this case makes heavy use of apophony , but the most common change is shortening of the word , most commonly removing the gender marker ( - os or - as ) from the end of the word . 
  e.g the vocative of `` kristos '' ( christ ) is `` krist '', 
  this seems to be the case . 
  the numbers up to 6 are all finnic . 
  ( even finno-ugric or uralic ? ), 
  and 6-10 are finnic roots applied in a base 8 manner . 
  i can recognise finnic roots in the seasons aswell . 
  `` suhus '' ( compare estonian `` s\u00fcgis '' ) and `` tyelve '' ( compare estonian `` talv '' . 
   do you have an inclusive and an exclusive form of `` we '' ? 
   are your pronouns gender neutral ? 
  there are 3 3rd person singular pronouns , male , female and neuter, 
   do you have them at all ?!, 
  yeah . 
  here they are :, 
  * tu / tu / - you, 
  * \u00cd / i : / - he, 
  * je / je / - it ( animate ), 
  * \u00dan / u : n / - one ( i forgot the term for this ), 
  * nos / nos / - we ( more than 2 ), 
  * noster / noster / - we ( 2 ), 
  * vu / vu / - semi-polite `` you '' - i took the idea of an impolite , semi-polite and polite second person pronoun from romanian `` dumneata '' vs `` dumneavoastr\u0103 '', 
  * veu / 've . u / - you ( 2 ), 
  * vos / vos / - you ( more than 2 ) or very polite singular `` you '', 
  * \u00cdle / i : le / - they ( more than 2 ), 
  * \u00cdla / i : la / - they ( 2 ), 
  surprisingly enough , the phonology is almost exactly the same as when i first created it . 
  one thing i can think of is that unstressed / o / is allowed ( and written as `` o '' ) in some cases , while in the beginning this was n't the case . 
  e.g `` ostrovas '' would have been `` ostruvas '' and `` komandantas '' would have been `` kumandantas '', 
  also a palatalised / s / , which in the beginning was pronounced as the sequence / si / ( and is written as `` si '' still ), 
  i 'd say `` dukyt\u00f3ras '' / duk\u0268 ` to : ras / , which means `` duke '' or `` leader '' . 
  i took inspriation from romanian `` conduc\u0103tor '' - i have a word with the con - prefix aswell , `` kondukyt\u00f3ras '' , which means `` grand duke '' or `` leader '' ( if there 's a kondukyt\u00f3ras and a dukyt\u00f3ras then a kondukyt\u00f3ras is more powerful ), 
  may i ask what does the acute accent represent in your orthography ? 
  stress ? 
  you should mark this in the ipa by adding an ' before the syllable that is stressed . 
  here are all the forms : http://pastebin.com/6n1zdxn6, 
  i make tools [ acc . 
  plural ] what ( inanimate counterpart to `` who '' ) make [ 3 . person plural ] tools [ acc.plural ] what watch/guard [ 3 . person plural ] code [ acc . ], 
  what deploys/releases tools [ acc.plural ] what build [ 3 . person plural ] tools [ acc.plural ] for guarding/watching [ gerund in dative ] of monitors [ genitive.plural ] for deploying/releasing [ gerund in dative ] tools [ genitive.plural ], 
  acute accent marks length . 
  in mind [ locative ] my [ genitive ] , i scream [ present continious ] very [ - es intensifier added , so this is emphasized ] loudly [ adverbial form ], 
  related to op , what is the bare minimum to kill zulrah ? 
  not looking for efficiency , doing it for the diaries . 
  i currently have 71 magic and 67 range ( this will be 70 as it is a req for the diary ) . 
  no void , and i 'm not very rich . 
  i have 2 verbs : `` ebius '' and `` possideius '' , but the other means something more like `` to possess '' . 
  so here is how you conjugate the word `` ebius '', 
  present simple :, 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  past simple :, 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  future simple :, 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  | singular | ebiut | ebiuta | ebiuti |, 
  past continious :, 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  present perfect : ( note in pronounciation : the i ' is pronounced as / j / in this case ), 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  future perfect : ( note in pronounciation : the a ' is reduced , almost silent ), 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  conditional ( future , present ) , the conditional of other tenses is formed by repeating the verb in that tense, 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  subjunctive ( present , as an example , this is formed regularly in other tenses ), 
  | | 1st person | 2nd person | 3rd person |, 
  imperative : d - prefix ( d'eb-i - ), 
  `` they have done it '' would be '' \u00cdle i ` fagerivihai oxem '' or '' \u00cdle i ` ferivihai oxem '' ( same meaning , just shortened , since such a long stem for such a simple word is somewhat cumbersome ) also , free word order , so '' \u00cdle oxem i ` ferivihai '' , `` oxem \u00edle i ` ferivihai '' , `` i ` ferivihai oxem \u00edle '' etc are all correct . 
  what is the difference between `` ghazao '' and `` ghazet '' ? 
  the word for 1 is '' \u00fanas '', 
  and there are words that end with that : `` m\u00fanas '' ( man ) , `` s\u00fanas '' ( son ) , `` fr\u00fanas '' ( woman ) , `` l\u00fanas '' ( moon ) - these can be written as `` m1 '' , `` s1 '' , `` fr1 '' , `` l1 '', 
  for common gender numbers , that 's it , since the other numbers have more complex stems . 
  for neuter numbers , however there are more of these types of words . 
  the word for neuter 2 is `` di '' , and this is a very common syllable . 
  `` dimitius '' ( to forgive ) -  2mitius .
