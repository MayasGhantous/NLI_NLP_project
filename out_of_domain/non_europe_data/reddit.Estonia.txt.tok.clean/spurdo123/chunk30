  the only letter i do n't use in any of my languages is `` q '' . 
  from european languages , albanian and english use `` sh '' , slavic languages use '' \u0161 '' , and german uses `` sch '' . 
  i usually use '' \u0161 '' for / \u0283 / , or '' \u015b '' . 
  thanks for the advice everyone . 
  i did 2 attempts , and it 's pretty hard . 
  i died to the jad phase both times . 
  it looks like i just have to get better at it . 
  the red phase is stressful but i got the hang of it quick . 
  is there some way to practice without spending money ? 
  the teleports are quite expensive . 
  oh , i had n't thought about boosting . 
  thanks . 
  k -  h is a common change . 
  t -  z should n't be too far-fetched either . 
  the satem soundchange in ie languages is similar , stop -  sibilant . 
  proto-germanic * - az yields old norse - r . the soundchange is called `` rhotacism '' . 
  for example :, 
  proto-germanic * dagaz yields old norse `` dagr '' , gothic `` dags '' , dutch `` dag '' , and english `` day '' . 
  palatalised consonants would be pretty hard yeah , since they are n't indicated in writing and some words have 2 different meanings , depending on if the consonant is palatalised . 
  your pronounciation is pretty good btw , albeit a bit rough . 
  also , your `` s '' is geminated , when it 's not supposed to be . 
  your `` a '' is also a bit weird , i 'd say it 's unrounded , similar to the hungarian `` a '' . 
  in some spots it 's perfect though . 
  learn ipa , like others have said . 
  wikipedia has good articles , with phonetic description and audio files . 
  learn linguistics terminology , like others have said . 
  `` depending on the situation '' is too vague . 
  having romance numbers but mostly a priori vocabulary is a bit odd , but that 's purely my subjective opinion , you can do what you want , but just present it in an understandable manner . 
  also , unless you 're doing an indo-european a posteriori conlang , try to focus heavily on syntax . 
  if you ignore it , it will become too english-like ( unless your native language is something else ) . 
  estonian does n't have voiced consonants , if you want to be pedantic . 
  it has slack voiceless consonants . 
  ( i.e the glottal opening is slightly wider ) . 
  although i personally only notice the difference between voiceless , voiceless slack , and voiced for / t / and / d / only . 
  they are definitely not the same as `` k '' , `` p '' , `` t '' at the end . 
  `` teet '' ( male given name ) and `` teed '' ( roads ) are distinct . 
  also `` saag '' ( saw ) and `` saak '' ( catch , haul , loot ) . 
  hitler ended it . 
  probably every game with guns in it has that . 
  they 're there in mafia ( 2002 ) , and they were in gta 3 aswell ( poorly done , but still ) .

  notes :, 
  the word for `` plains '' and `` steppe '' is the same . 
  i usually just translate this as `` steppe '' . 
  the indefinite pronoun used in takanaa is the 1st person singular pronoun ; in english this can be the 2nd person pronoun ( `` you '' ; this is known as the `` generic you '' ) or a seperate 3rd person pronoun ( `` one '' ) . 
  yeah , that 's one thing i have n't bothered to learn . 
  i do n't see the need anyway ; it 's easier for beginners to read . 
  in estonian , the word ** pahem ** also exists , meaning `` left '' . 
  it is the comparative of * paha * `` bad '' , possibly from proto-germanic * b\u0101\u01e5a - . 
  compare old norse b\u00e1gr `` difficult '' . 
  also , the comparative of * vasak * is * vasem * ; a bit more similar to finnish . 
  it 's from middle low german `` karde '' , `` karte '' , cognate to english `` card '' and `` chart '' . 
  i 'd suggest macrons for rounding and double letters for length . 
  actually , it 's more like 30 % -40 % . 
  there are a lot of old proto-germanic and proto-norse loans that are shared with finnish , and newer loans from high german . 
  `` southslavia '' is n't an english word . 
  the proper name is `` yugoslavia '' . 
  also , it 's worth noting that the irish war of independence was ongoing at this point , and so was the polish-soviet war . 
  it 's most likely just before the battle of warsaw , so summer of 1920 . 
  sernerdas ( spoken more or less where lithuania , latvia and belarus are irl ) has 8 seasons , which is unusual for an ie language . 
  currently , it 's ** rudon ** / ru ` duon / . 
  this is translated as `` late autumn '' , `` early winter '' . 
  the first snow has already fallen , but it 's still quite warm and the ground has n't frozen . 
  usually the month of november . 
  next is ** ibernas ** / i ` vernas / . 
  this is the core winter . 
  the ground is frozen and the snow is permanent . 
  usually december to february . 
  next is ** prevasara ** / pre ` vasara / . 
  this is when it 's getting wet and the snow is starting to melt . 
  usually march . 
  next is ** vasara ** / ` vasara / . 
  this is the core spring . 
  the snow is almost completely gone , there are floods . 
  usually april . 
  next is ** v\u0113r ** / 've : r / . 
  this is pretty much the month of may ; it 's very warm , but kids are still going to school and the summer crop is being planted . 
  next is ** aistas ** / ' \u0250is\u02b2t\u02b2as / . 
  this is the core summer . 
  usually june to august . 
  next is ** prerudon ** / preru ` duon / . 
  this is the beginning of autumn and the hunting season . 
  it 's still quite warm . 
  usually september and early october . 
  next is ** autumnos ** / ' \u0250utumnus / . 
  this is the core autumn . 
  usually october and early november . 
  it was my first conlang , so there are a lot of problems ( e.g i did n't even touch on pitch accent ; my vocabulary is now over 2000 words and documentation is hard to find ) . 
  also , it 's heavily latinified . 
  `` kael '' is baltic . 
  compare lithuanian `` kaklas '' . 
  finnish `` kaula '' is a cognate .
