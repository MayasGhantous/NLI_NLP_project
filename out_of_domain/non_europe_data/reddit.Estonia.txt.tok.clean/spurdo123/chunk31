  apparently some dialects have `` kakla '' . 
   some obvious improvements to natural language would be to have one character for each possible consonant, 
  but why ? 
  most orthographies have this . 
  in my opinion , etymological spelling is more interesting . 
  e.g , lets say the soundchange / sk / -  / \u0283 / happens after the advent of writing ( and no reform occurs ) , and / \u0283 / occurs in other positions aswell . 
  then , for / \u0283 / , you would have 2 ways of writing it : however / sk / used to be written ( e.g `` sk '' ) , and however / \u0283 / used to be written ( e.g `` z '' ) . 
  this adds an interesting layer to the orthography . 
  if a consonant is very rare , and no confusion arises , it might be possible to just not indicate it in writing . 
  e.g let 's say there 's a word pronounced / ` so\u0294e / , and / oe / is not a diphthong ( and the combination of `` o '' and `` e '' is n't a digraph ) . 
  the word can be just written as `` soe '' . 
  also , you can do a lot of different things if you 're not using the latin alphabet . 
  edit : i missed the fact that your goal is to simplify communication , but still . 
  i would n't consider estonia `` ethnically diverse '' . 
  we have only 2 ethnic groups : estonians and russians ( and some ukrainians aswell , but many are russified ) . 
  the younger generation of russians is assimilating . 
  i hardly believe we are more `` diverse '' than india or china . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  we do n't even really have dialects anymore ; the only ones that are still strong the southern estonian dialects , and they are sometimes considered as seperate languages . 
  estonia used to have ** kroon ** s until 2011 . 
  the name lit . 
  means `` crown '' . 
  we had ** mark ** s ( compare bosnia and pre-euro germany ) from ~ 1919 to 1928 . 
  the name also has the meaning `` mark '' , or `` postmark '' , but they are different words , declend differently ( the genitive of the currency is * marga * , the genitive of `` postmark '' is * margi * ) , and are loaned at different times . 
  the meaning of the currency is a proto-germanic loan , and the meaning of `` postmark '' is a high german loan . 
  we also have the low german version of this root : ** m\u00e4rk ** , meaning `` mark '' , `` sign '' . 
  finland also had ** markka ** until they adopted the euro . 
  traditionally in sernerdas , latin names have been used for the elements in all scientific contexts , but this is in decline . 
  copper : ** varas ** / ` varas / , or ** k\u016bpros ** / ` ku : prus / ( chiefly scientifical ),

  iron : ** raudas ** / ` r\u0250udas / , ** gelesios ** / ` geles\u02b2us / , or ** ferros ** / ` fer : us / ( chiefly scientifical ) . 
  also , the word ** \u012aserna ** / ` i : serna / exists , but only has the meaning of `` iron '' in dialects . 
  it usually means `` tool '' , or `` sword '' . 
  `` running silver '' ) , or ** merkurios ** / ` merkur\u02b2us / ( traditional scientific term , rarely used ),

  unless you 're talking about mycenaean greek , or modern greek , it 's always been / y / ( the german '' \u00fc '' , a sound that does n't exist in english ) . 
  although apparently some words did have the / u / sound in early ancient greek . 
  my native language , estonian , has the / y / sound , so greek loanwords retain this sound :, 
  you 're an idiot if you think that . 
  it 's just that the support of communism in this thread is disgusting . 
  the world would be a much better place without it . 
  what are we then ? 
  we do n't share much culture with lithuania or russia . 
  maybe . 
  but i 'm talking about the communism practiced in russia . 
  if the whites had won the civil war , ( and had recognised and allied with poland , lithuania , latvia , and estonia ) , eastern europe would be much more developed , and there would be less pointless deaths . 
  ww2 becomes an issue though ; germany would 've fared much better against a non-imperialist power , not like the ussr . 
  i 'll give them that ; an imperialist power with a strong military like the ussr was important in the defeat of germany . 
  in sernerdas :,

  he 's somewhat right though . 
  estonia has never had that flag , but the current land area of estonia has been occupied by an entity with the flag in the picture . 
  ( the essr was n't even a sovereign state ; the ussr flag should probably be used if you count occupations ),

  a few names i remember :,

  * l6vi - was number 1 for a time in classic . 
  for non-estonians , his name is internet-speak for `` l\u00f5vi '' ( lion ) . 
  * wisely done - first to 200m dung , currently number 8 . 
  * aasiwat ( later allar ) - do n't remember too much about him aswell, 
  there were a few others but i ca n't remember right now . 
  oh yeah , totally forgot about him . 
  he was rank 1 for some time aswell , in early 2013 . 
  * its * and * it 's * has nothing to do with grammar ; it 's a spelling/writing/orthography issue . 
  ipa would indeed be useful , but if you 're familiar with the language , you can guess the pronounciation easily . 
  btw , * ch * in german , scots and slavic languages represents / x / , a sound that does n't exist in english , best described as a rougher `` h '', 
  i do n't understand your point . 
  to better see similarities . 
  i hate the transliteration system for russian used here ; the better way is to do it like the other slavic languages ; no `` kh '' , no `` ye '' , etc. 
  use `` h '' and '' ( j ) e '' instead . 
  one of the worst offenders is the name `` khrushchev '' , which should be `` hru\u0161\u010dov '' . 
  the '' \u0161\u010d '' cluster has a special pronounciation , but i ca n't type ipa right now . 
  slavic languages have very simple orthographies . 
  polish is the hardest , but still regular . 
  `` luutara '' would mean `` bonefence '' in estonian .
