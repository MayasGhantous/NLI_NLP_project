  important note for vocabulary : there are 2 main words for `` war '' - ** bellos ** and ** karias ** . 
  * bellos * refers to war in general , and is used in statements like * war is devastating * , * the lord started many wars * ( if said wars are not listed in the next sentence ) . 
  the word * karias * is used for certain wars and campaigns : * the war began 2 years ago * , * independence war * , etc. 
  e.g : the franco-prussian war is ** frankiae-preisiae karias ** , and the 1st world war is ** pirmas kusma-karias ** ( first world-war ) , or ** pasaul\u0113s karias ** ( world 's war ), 
  [ ety ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=t\u00e4ht&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et ) claims that it is finno-volgaic , not finno-ugric . 
  the furthest cognate listed is mari . 
  also , * t\u00e4ht * in estonian also means `` letter '' , as in `` letter of the alphabet '' . 
  estonian : ** sool ** , from proto-indo-european * seh \u2082 l - ( or * sal - ) . 
  probably a wanderwort . 
  other finnic languages :, 
  it 's onomatopoetic , possibly related to the verb * siputama * `` to flail around '' , which is also onomatopoetic . 
  in takanaa :, 
  there are 2 different cases , i call them genitive 1 and genitive 2 . 
  genitive 2 is morphologically in essence a plural version of genitive 1 . 
  the first genitive is used for 1 possession , and genitive 2 is used for many possessions . 
  there is also a genitive 3 , but it is used for origin , birth and a few adpositions , not for possession . 
  e.g :, 
  `` the man 's daughters '' - ** tar\u0259sap m\u0259nadda\u015b ** / ` ta\u0281\u0259sap 'm \u0259na\u0256a\u0283 / - * man-gen2 daughter-pl *, 
  if you would use genitive 1 in this sentence , it would imply that only 1 of the daughters is the man 's , the others are someone else 's . 
  e.g `` pa\u015banipara 's and xarata 's daughters ( pa\u015banipara has only 1 daughter , xarata has 2 + ) '' would be ** pa\u015banipar\u0259 f\u0259 xarat\u0259p m\u0259nadda\u015b ** - * pa\u015banipara-gen1 and xarata-gen2 daughter-pl *, 
  to say `` i have x '' , the apudessive ( usually translates to `` next to '' ) case is used . 
  e.g `` i have lots of money '' - ** xu xadan \u00feanaka\u015b ** - * a.large.amount money-gen3 i [ gender-neutral informal ] - apudessive-cop *, 
  here are some examples of the 3 grades of vowel and consonant length :, 
  ** kogu ** / ` ko\u0261\u030au / * whole * ; * collection * ; * body * ; * collect-imp * - ** koka ** / ` kok\u0251 / * chef-gen * ; * coca-cola [ colloquial ] * - ** kokku ** / ` kok : u / * together ( in a lative sense ) * - ** kokku ** / ` kok : : u / - * collection-illative * , * body-illative *, 
  ** vere ** / ` vere / * blood-gen * - ** veere ** / 've : re / * edge-gen * ; * roll * - ** veere ** / 've : : re / * roll-imp * ; * edge-partitive-pl * ; * roll-gen * [ note : for me * roll-imp * is a bit sketchy ; when unstressed it can be long instead of overlong ], 
  ** vina ** / ` vin\u0251 / * thin.see.through.layer * ; * twilight * ; * smell * - ** viina ** / ` vi : n\u0251 / * vodka-gen * - ** viina ** / ` vi : : n\u0251 / * vodka-partitive * ; * vodka-illative *, 
  * i-poss-n-gen mind-gen inner-m working-m be-3sg-prs that [ basically an intensifier in this case ] mystery *, 
  that 's a really cool distinction . 
  although i 'm pretty sure a `` passive infinitive '' would mean something like `` to be ridden '' . 
  for estonian , only medical terms seem to be listed . 
  here are more commonly used words :, 
  * kusiti - from * kusi * `` urine '' + - ti , an instrument-forming suffix . 
  strictly medical , usually used in an urological sense . 
  * munn - derived from * muna * `` egg '' . 
  vulgar , but very common colloquially . 
  * t\u00fcra - cognate to finnish * tyr\u00e4 * , where the word means `` hernia '' , `` spell '' , `` witch 's arrow '' ( last 2 are archaic ) . 
  it 's a very common swearword ; the meaning of `` penis '' sometimes is forgotten . 
  more vulgar than * munn * . 
  * noku - derived from * nokk * `` beak '' . 
  very childish . 
  * till - somewhat childish . 
  most likely from a name of a bird . 
  the word also means `` dill '' , but they are unrelated etymologically . 
  ( the meaning of `` dill '' is a cognate to english through middle low german ) . 
  * k\u00fcrb - rare . 
  cognate to finnish * kyrp\u00e4 * . 
  all cognates have the meaning of `` penis '' . 
  * v\u00e4nt - somewhat uncommon . 
  presumably from * v\u00e4nt * `` pedal '' . 
  * riist - from * riist * `` tool '', 
  * v\u00f5mp - rare . 
  unknown origin ; usually in the insult * ime v\u00f5mpa * `` suck a dick '', 
  from * v\u00e4ike * `` little '' + * mees * `` man '', 
  from * mees * `` man '' + * au * `` honour '' .

  * holy this-temp day-temp all.we-cop ___ *, 
  * holy on this day all-we 're ___ *, 
  note about syntax : takanaa is vso ; but determiners and adverbs come before the verb , adjectives come before the noun . 
  and in the present tense the copula is suffixed to the subject . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl :, 
  * we all be-1pl-prs ___ today-adj-ade holy-ade day-ade *, 
  * we all are __ on the holy day of today *, 
  note : instead of * p\u00fc\u00e4t\u00e4 * ; you can use ** p\u00fc\u00e4c\u00e4d\u00fct\u00e4 ** / ` py\u00e6ts\u00e6\u00f0yt\u00e6 / * bless-pst-pass-ptcp-ade * `` blessed ( adessive ) '' .

  edit : thanks !, 
  many still think it is a disease . 
  most people on the internet are young , urban , and much more accepting of it . 
  if you only take tallinn , and exclude russians and people over 40 , you will most likely get a very high result . 
  although lgbt acceptance has nothing to do with being nordic ; our history and culture has . 
  lgbt people are a relatively recent phenomenon , and our relatively recent history has been influenced by the soviet union , so change is coming slowly . 
  note how i never claimed that . 
  i said :, 
   [ . . ] has nothing to do with being nordic ; our history and culture has . 
  i said , that our `` nordicness '' ( whether we are nordic or not ) is indicated by our history and culture . 
  i never once said that estonia is `` nordic '' . 
  * well ( a hard to translate interjection ) just ( also hard to translate ) you.like-adv cry-sg-imp *, 
  * well just , like you cry *, 
  notes : * kital * means `` similar to sth '' , `` like sth '' . 
  so * takital * means `` similar to you '' , `` like you '' . 
  and * takitul * is the adverbial version of that .
