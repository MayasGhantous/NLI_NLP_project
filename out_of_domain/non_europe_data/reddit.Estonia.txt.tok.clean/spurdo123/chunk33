  * well , we 're going through some bad times *, 
  the speaker is displeased with the situation , and is just stating a fact . 
  * well , go-pl-imp we *, 
  * well okay then , let 's go *, 
  the speaker is displeased with the situation , but has accepted their fate and no longer cares . 
  for * s\u0259tu * - there are 2 primary meanings :, 
  * come.on , run-sg-imp !, 
  the speaker is urging the listener to do something , but unlike with * na * , the speaker is n't necessarily displeased with the situation , just urging the listener to do something . 
  * just chaos-cop *, 
  * we 're just going through some bad times , nothing to worry about *, 
  the speaker is trivialising the situation , and telling the listener not to worry . 
  actually , finland had a swedish aristocracy . 
  estonia and latvia had a german one , yes . 
  during the 16th century they adopted lutheranism , and a bit later adopted high german , replacing the former ( middle ) low german . 
  their own local dialect evolved , with many estonian and latvian loanwords . 
  in takanaa , the possessor is indicated by the genitive cases ( inflects for number ) . 
  if there are multible possessions , genitive 2 is used ( i.e a plural version of genitive 1 ) . 
  the possessed is indicated by a possessive suffix ( inflects for number ) . 
  if there are multible possessions , the possessive suffix is suffixed with * - p * in singular , * - bi * in plural . 
  the possessed always comes after the possessor . 
  so , a few examples :, 
  `` father 's horse '' ( 1 father , 1 horse ) = ** att\u0259 upa\u015ba\u00fei ** / ` a\u0288\u0259 ` upa\u0283at\u02b0i / * father-gen1 horse-3sg-poss *, 
  `` my father 's horses '' ( 1 father , many horses ) = ** att\u0259pipi upa\u015baa\u015bi\u00feip ** / ` a\u0288\u0259pipi upa ' \u0283a\u0283it\u02b0ip / * father-gen2-1sg-poss horse-pl-3sg-pl-poss * [ plurality is marked twice ; once as * - aa\u015b * in the noun , and as * - p * in the possessive suffix ], 
  `` my fathers ' horse '' ( many fathers , 1 horse ) = ** att\u0259\u015bipi upa\u015ba\u00fei\u015b ** / ` a\u0288\u0259\u0283ipi ` upa\u0283at\u02b0i\u0283 / * father-gen1-pl-1sg-poss horse-3pl-poss *,

  what is the etymology of valga/walk/valka ? 
  ( the estonian county coloured in here ), 
  i can find an estonian etymology ; from * valge * ( earlier * valkeda * , * valketa * ) , meaning `` white '' . 
  use the desktop site instead of the mobile one . 
  there should be an option in the top-right menu . 
  `` dead language '' = no native speakers , no community uses it as an everyday language, 
  well , it 's a shame english has only 1 word for these two very different concepts . 
  when i see `` estonian '' , i think of ethnic estonians , not russians . 
  well , there was no `` latvia '' either , and `` estonia '' comprised only the northern part of what today is estonia . 
  also , i find that hard to believe . 
  do you have any sources for that ? 
  i know that the finns were n't slaves like the estonians , latvians and livonians were , but a finnish-speaking aristocracy ? 
  interesting . 
  the situation here was completely different . 
  the name `` estonia '' was only used for current northern estonia . 
  there was no uniting term for all estonians . 
  the word * eesti * is a loanword from german . 
  the original native term was * maavald * - `` land-parish '' , but it 's sort of a rare word . 
  we had counties ( * maakonnad * ) , but no organisation greater than that . 
  i do n't know too much about latvia , but there were multible tribes there : curonians , semgallians , latgalians , and the finnic-speaking livonians . 
  the latgalians eventually formed the latvian nation . 
  there was no estonian/latvian-speaking aristocracy of any kind ; the peasants were seen as subhumans ( exaggerating a bit ) , and only thanks to the baltic-german estophiles/lettophiles that began to change in the 18th/19th centuries .

  in sernerdas , some refrain from using words of latin origin , coining new words of baltic origin to replace them . 
  in most cases , there exist synonyms for latin-origin words , and both are used freely . 
  e.g :, 
  * ** meilyv\u0113 ** / 'm \u0250il\u0268ve : / instead of ** am\u014dr ** / ` amo : r / `` love '', 
  * ** gim\u0113nimas ** / gi ` me : nimas / instead of ** kult\u016bra ** / kul ` tu : ra / `` culture '', 
  `` fifth day '' ) instead of ** frideinas ** / fri 'd \u0250inas / ( from a germanic language ) or ** i\u014dvas ** / ` jo : vas / `` friday '' ( from latin * dies iovis * , which actually originally meant thursday ), 
  * ** miensyti ** / m\u02b2en 's \u0268ti / instead of ** intelyneri ** / inte ` l\u0268neri / `` to understand '', 
  * ** dirpti ** / ` dirpti / instead of ** lab\u014driri ** / la ` vo : riri / `` to work '' , although in this case the synonyms have a slight difference in meaning ; * dirpti * implies that the work is exceptionally difficult , and that the speaker is somewhat complaining about it . 
  in some cases they are just pure synonyms with no difference in use . 
  ( most likely * utu ) . 
  cognate to finnish `` utu '' and votic `` utu '' . 
  we also have the word * sumu * , which is a loan from finnish . 
  it only refers to very light fog . 
  baltic but with very heavy latin influence . 
  / ` talita\u0281at\u02b2u /, 
  * curse-pass-agent-ptcp *, 
  * the one who is cursed *, 
  \u017e , \u0161 , etc -  h is also an usual change in baltic loans in proto-finnic . 
  so : [ pairs are finnish-estonian ], 
  * \u0161aka -  hako , hagu - `` certain type of branch '' , `` thin firewood '', 
  * \u017ealias -  haljakka , haljas - `` faded '' , `` colour of young grass '' , `` shiny '', 
  * \u0161ein-as ( lithuanian : \u0161ienas ) -  hein\u00e4 , hein - `` hay '', 
  an easy way to create inflection tables ( like in wiktionary ) . 
  there 's probably a program for this but i do n't know it . 
  estonian : ** kunst ** , from middle low german . 
  the meaning was influenced by high german . 
  yeah , for some reason there 's an oddly large amount of transgender people in conlanging . 
  there 's been some talk of it before , but i do n't remember what reason people came up with . 
  the proportion of females seems normal though .

  this-cop linguistic-cop indo-european-adj-pl language-gen1-pl fore.walk-agent-ptcp-gen1-poss-3pl again create-inf-poss-3sg-cop - wikipedia *, 
  * ancient is indo-european is language is pie . 
  this is linguistic is of the indo-european languages common forewalker 's again is create is - wikipedia *, 
  in essence , * reconstruct * is * again to create * , and the infinitive also acts as a supine and gerund , so * reconstruction * is morphologically the same word . 
  the copula is suffixed to many words , but not all , only : * ancient indo-european language . 
  this linguistic reconstruction * . 
  in possessive clauses , only the final word receives the copula ( e.g : father 's mother 's brother 's sister 's aunt -  only `` aunt '' recieves the copula , but e.g in `` blue big round car '' , every word can recieve the copula , or if the qualities are unemphasised , then only `` car '' would recieve the copula , or if certain qualities are emphasised , then those qualities would recieve the copula ), 
  his language is based off of proto-indo-european , which uses this orthography . 
  you could make a more modern and natural orthography though for pie , e.g you could write the laryngeals as e.g `` x '' , `` z '' , `` c '' , or whatever . 
  yep . 
  izhorians , votes , and also setos are all orthodox . 
  the setos were also christianised a century or two before the rest of estonia . 
  ingrians ( as in , ingrian finns ) were lutheran , since they immigrated from finland to ingermanland in the 17th century .
