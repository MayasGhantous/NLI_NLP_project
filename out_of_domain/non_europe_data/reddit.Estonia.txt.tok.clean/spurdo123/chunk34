  see [ this ] ( http://anglistika.upol.cz/fileadmin/kaa/emonds/vikings2014.pdf ) paper . 
  verbs in takanaa conjugate only for number , except for the negative verb , which conjugates for person aswell . 
  here are the tenses : [ note for pronounciation ; most are identical to ipa ; \u015b is / \u0283 / , g , b , d are / k\u02b2 / , / p\u02b2 / , / t\u02b2 / , \u00fe is / t\u02b0 / , double vowels indicate that the stress is on that syllable ( the vowel is still short ) ], 
  ** present ** - this is used for actions taking place in the present . 
  they can be either ongoing , or habitual . 
  for the meaning of `` the action is happening constantly '' , the preposition * sibi * is placed before the verb . 
  conjugation in the 3 conjugation classes : [ 1st class : infinitive-supine-gerund ending in ** - k ** ( stressed syllable ) , 2nd class : infinitive-supine-gerund ending in ** - m ** ( unstressed syllable ) , 3rd class : infinitive-supine-gerund ending in ** - \u015b ** ( unstressed syllable ) ], 
  * 1st : singular : ** - \u0259 ** ; plural : ** - \u0259\u015b ** [ so e.g * \u015banuuk * `` to live '' -  * \u015ban\u0259 * `` lives '' ( no person specified ; singular number ) ], 
  * 2nd : singular : the infinitive ** - m ** is removed ; plural : ** - \u015b ** is suffixed to whatever vowel remains . 
  [ so e.g * \u0259j\u0259m * `` to go '' -  * \u0259j\u0259 * `` goes '' ( no person specified , singular number ) ], 
  * 3rd : singular : ** identical to the infinitive-supine-gerund ** ; plural : ** identical to the infinitive-supine-gerund **, 
  ** past ** - this is used for actions that took place in the past . 
  the action that took place is relevant to the conversation at hand . 
  conjugation :, 
  * 2nd : s : ** - ni ** ; p : ** - ni\u015b **, 
  * 3rd : s : ** - ni\u015b ** ; p : ** - ni\u015b ** [ e.g * sas\u0259\u015b * - `` to be calm '' ; * sas\u0259ni\u015b * `` was calm '' ( no person specified ) ], 
  ** past historic ** - this is used for actions that took place in the past , but have no relevancy today . 
  e.g the sentence `` x did y on z day '' would use the past historic tense , but `` i did x yesterday already ! '', 
  would use the past tense . 
  conjugation :, 
  * 3rd : s : ** - nu\u015b ** ; p : ** - nu\u015b **, 
  ** near future ** - this is used for actions taking place not right now , but later today . 
  this is a literary tense , and is usually replaced by the present . 
  conjugation :, 
  * 2nd : s : ** - na ** ; p : ** - na\u015b **, 
  * 3rd : s : ** - na\u015b ** ; p : ** - na\u015b **, 
  ** far future ** - this is used for actions taking place far in the future ; not today , probably not tomorrow , most likely not this week . 
  this is a literary tense , and is usually replaced by the present . 
  conjugation :, 
  * 2nd : s : ** - naa ** ; p : ** - naa\u015b **, 
  * 3rd : s : ** - naa\u015b ** ; p : ** - naa\u015b **, 
  also , object forms exist , but they are regular suffixes added to whichever tense/form . 
  in the 1st and 2nd conjugations : [ plurals are simply - p ], 
  * 1st person : n/a ; reflexive verbs are created, 
  * 2nd person : ** - ta **, 
  * 3rd person ** - \u00feu **, 
  in the 3rd conjugation : [ plurals are identical to singular ], 
  * 1st person : ** - aw\u0259 ** , or a reflexive verb is created instead, 
  * 2nd person : ** - at **, 
  * 3rd person : ** - ut **, 
  note about the 3rd conjugation : every verb in this category has the basic meaning of `` to be x '' ( the meanings are usually broader ) , derived from adjectives or nouns . 
  e.g the verb ** t\u0259p\u0259s\u0259\u015b ** - `` to be evil '' , `` to do evil things '' , `` to do bad things '' - derived from ** t\u0259p\u0259l ** `` bad '' , `` evil '' . 
  in takanaa , they usually do n't exist .
