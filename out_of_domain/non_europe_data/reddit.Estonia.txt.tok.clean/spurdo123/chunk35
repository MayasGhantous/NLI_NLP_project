  * c ) the tense is present,

  alternative sentence , using the passive : ( less common , but often seen in poetry ),

  note about syntax : the normal word order is vso , but in passive clauses it becomes svo . 
  for baltic cognates , compare lithuanian * pyti * `` to start to give milk '' , `` to get wet '' , `` to milk '' ( may be dialectal ) . 
  lithuanian * pienas * and lativan * piens * `` milk '' might be related . 
  there 's also a slight possibility of it being indo-iranian , compare avestan * pay\u014d - * , middle persian * p\u0113m * . 
  central europe is in essence the german cultural sphere ( a germanosphere , if you will ) . 
  this usually includes the baltics aswell . 
  lithuania because of their history with poland , and latvia and estonia because of their history with an ethnic german aristocracy . 
  the cold-war era simple east-west distinction is obsolete and irrelevant . 
  also , the vikings were closely tied with oeselians ( people from saaremaa / \u00d6sel ) , and curonians ( people from kurzeme/curonia/kuramaa ) . 
  some sentences of a creole between sernerdas and takanaa :, 
  the only takanaa influence in this is a change in phonology ; no diphthongs . 
  `` my cat is black '' :, 
  * sernerdas : ** manas katas est negris ** / ` manas ` katas ` es\u02b2t ` nekris / * my-poss-m cat-m be-3sg-prs black-m *, 
  * takanaa : ** pa\u015bas\u0259\u015b majupi ** / ` pa\u0283as\u0259\u0283 ` majupi / * to.be.black-prs cat-poss-1sg *, 
  influences of takanaa : the word * passa * is from takanaa . 
  the zero copula is influenced by takanaa , where it is a trend ( the copula is usually a suffix ) . 
  takanaa / \u0283 / and sernerdas / s\u02b2 / fuse into / s : / . 
  `` sit here !, 
  ** , or ** ik\u0259s s\u0259tit !, 
  ** / ` ik\u0259s ` patit / , / ` ik\u0259s 's \u0259tit / * here sit-prs *,

  ** / ` itapan ` p\u02b2atak\u0259 / * here-adv sit-imp *, 
  influences of takanaa : the word * patit * . 
  the / k\u02b2s / cluster of sernerdas becomes / k\u0259s / . 
  voiced stops become voiceless . 
  the adverb comes before the verb . 
  both takanaa and sernerdas have a lot of cases ( 28 and 6 , respectively ) . 
  here is the declension of the word * il\u0259k * ( from sernerdas * vilkas * ) `` wolf '' :, 
  | | singular | plural |, 
  | nominative | il\u0259k | il\u0259k\u0259, 
  | genitive | t\u0259 il\u0259k | t\u0259 il\u0259k\u0259, 
  | locative | in il\u0259k | in il\u0259k\u0259, 
  | dative | u il\u0259k | u il\u0259k\u0259, 
  | superessive | at il\u0259k | at il\u0259k\u0259, 
  | apulative | aka il\u0259k | aka il\u0259k\u0259, 
  | essive | ass il\u0259k | ass il\u0259k\u0259, 
  creolisation results in two different ways to mark the indirect object . 
  `` i gave to the wolf '' can be :, 
  * a ) ** s u il\u0259k pitan ** / ' \u1d4as\u1d4a ' u ` il\u0259k ` pitan / * i dat-wolf give-pst *, 
  * b ) ** s aka il\u0259k pitan ** / ' \u1d4as\u1d4a ` aka ` il\u0259k ` pitan / * i apulative-wolf give-pst *, 
  yes . 
  many languages incorporate the object into verbs ( e.g polysynthetic languages such as yupik ) . 
  although i ca n't think of any languages incorporating the subject . 
  ( not counting the suffixes for person seen commonly in indo-european and uralic languages ) . 
  my conlang takanaa can only indicate the object in the verb , with either noun incorporation or object suffixes ( 2nd person , 3rd person ) . 
  so , `` i saw him '' would be :, 
  ** inutt\u0259ninut \u00fei ** / ` inu\u0288\u0259ninut ` t\u02b0i / * see-pst-obj-3sg i [ informal gender-neutral ] *, 
  without incorporation : ** inutt\u0259ni \u00fei u\u00fe\u0259 ** / ` i ` inu\u0288\u0259ni ` t\u02b0i ` ut\u02b0\u0259 / * see-pst i [ informal-gender-neutral ] he-acc *, 
  `` i saw the horse '' would be :, 
  ** inutt\u0259ninupa\u015b\u0259 \u00fei ** / ` inu\u0288\u0259ninupa\u0283\u0259 ` t\u02b0i / * see-pst . horse-incorporated i [ informal gender-neutral ] *, 
  without incorporation : ** inutt\u0259ni \u00fei upa\u015ba ** / ` inu\u0288\u0259ni ` t\u02b0i ` upa\u0283a / * see-pst i [ informal gender-neutral ] horse-acc *, 
  greater finland ( ca n't think of a better name right now ) would most definitely have ingria . 
  the flag would probably be different aswell , since it most likely would n't be a finnish state , it would be a finnic state , consisting of finns , estonians , karelians , votes , ingrians , ludes , and veps . 
  although the inclusion of sami lands is weird ; this map splits the sami into 2 states , which is still better than 4 though . 
   for the record my conlang is kinda agglunitave , not really like hungarian or so , more like latin , do n't know if that is agglunitave, 
  if your affixes have only 1 meaning and do n't change in word-formation , then it is agglutinative . 
  f.e the plural suffix is ** - ak ** , and the comitative suffix is ** - ap ** . 
  so , the plural comitative would then be either ** - apak ** or ** - akap ** , * not * something else like ** - aps **, 
  no language is fully agglutinative or fully fusional . 
  estonian fuses many affixes ( genitive plural , partitive plural ) , and lithuanian has some agglutination :, 
  * feminine plural of * geras * `` good '' = ** geros **, 
  * masculine singular of * geras * = ** geras **, 
  * masculine pronominal singular of * geras * = ** gerasis ** ( ger + as + is ), 
  note about the word `` apple '' :, 
  the connection of finnish * omena * and estonian * \u00f5un * is uncertain . 
  the only certain cognates of estonian are votic * \u00f5una * and north-eastern estonian * oun * ( resulting in theoretical finnish * ouna ) . 
  for an indo-iranian comparison , compare yidgha * \u00e5muno * , * amun * `` apple '' . 
  the original could do with a remake/remaster , sure . 
  but mafia 2 's graphics are very good , i see no reason for a remake/remaster . 
  sernerdas ( a baltic language , spoken in modern-day latvia , lithuania , east prussia , most of belarus , and parts of poland ) has a lot of loanwords . 
  a large portion are from latin , but there are also :, 
  i. : finnic borrowings . 
  mostly from proto-finnic , with a few from livonian or estonian . 
  examples :, 
  * ** vasar ** / ` vasar / - `` hammer '' - the loss of the final - a points it to being a newer estonian loan ; or the final - a was lost due to homonymy with * vasara * `` spring '' . 
  * ** pela ** / ` pela / - `` game '' - ultimately from swedish * spela * , but the loss of initial s - indicates a finnic loan . 
  the word is a very new borrowing , since contact with finnish would 've been impossible , and it has been loaned into estonian only recently .
