  * ** roias ** / ` ruojas / - `` shit '' , `` excrement '' - from proto-finnic ? , influenced by estonian * roe * ( gen. : * rooja * ) . 
  only the masculine - as form has survived in the standard language , parallel feminine - a forms can be seen in dialects . 
  * ** vaena ** / ` v\u0250ina / `` hostility '' - ultimately from old east slavic * vojna * , most likely a newer loan from estonian , as it is seen in northern dialects , where there are next to no russian loanwords . 
  influenced by the russian * vojna * , gaining the meaning of `` war '', 
  : germanic borrowings . 
  these fall into 3 categories : 1 ) early proto-germanic loans . 
  some are loaned through finnic . 
  2 ) middle low german loans , some through estonian . 
  3 ) later high german loans . 
  examples :, 
  * ** ariatas ** / ` ar\u02b2atas / `` leader of a platoon '' , `` army leader '' - from proto-germanic * harjatug\u00f4, 
  * ** b\u012bd ** / ` pi :d / `` please '' - from german * bitte *, 
  * ** oulderi ** / ` o : lderi / , / u : lderi / `` to hold '' , `` to keep '' - from middle low german * h\u014dlden * . 
  the - r - infinitive is extremely strange ; it is non-productive , only existing in verbs from latin , or with the productive suffix * - eiri * . 
  * ** kuningas ** / ` kuni\u014bas / `` king '' - from proto-germanic `` kuningaz '' . 
  an irregular variant * kunyngas * / ` kun\u0268\u014bas / is also seen , pointing to a long / i : / . 
  iii . 
  : slavic borrowings . 
  in the standard language , these are mostly from old east slavic , although dialects have a lot of loanwords from russian . 
  examples :, 
  * ** akuna ** / ` akuna / `` window '' - from old east slavic * ok\u016dno *, 
  * ** cilv\u0113kas ** / tsil 've : kas / `` manpower '' - from old east slavic * \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043a\u044a *, 
  * ** kunyga ** / ku ` n\u0268ga / `` book '' - from old east slavic * \u043a\u044a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 *, 
  i 've thought of plausible explanations for the large latin influence in sernerdas , and i 've come up with a theory of sorts :, 
  * the roman empire expanded to modern-day poland , and latinified the local population . 
  they came in contact with the baltic-speaking population to the east , and heavily influenced their language.the local dialect of latin spoken in poland was very conservative , without palatalisation , but still with some large changes that are seen in sernerdas ( loss of / o / , loss of / h / , large changes to verbs ) . 
  later , in the modern era , during language standardisation , rampant borrowing from latin and french ensued . 
  the latin spoken here is extinct now , but has influenced sernerdas and the local dialects of german surrounding it . 
  also , west slavic languages are spoken in a smaller area ; in galicia , slovakia , parts of czechia and southern poland . 
   intuitive grammatical structure, 
  intuitive to who ? 
  indo-europeans ? 
  or do you mean something else , like regularity ? 
  is this an indo-european conlang ? 
  the cases look indo-european , but i do n't recognise any of the words . 
  the nasal plural genitive is very familiar . 
  estonia and latvia both have a very large russian minority ( ~ 25 % ) , and lithuania has a polish minority ( something like ~ 5 % ) . 
  although this does n't fully explain lithuania . 
  estonia also has a large hiv-epidemic that most people do n't know anything about , since it 's mostly restricted to russians .
