  * ** x\u0259\u015bak ** / ` k\u02b0\u0259\u0283ak / - formal honourific . 
  used for people the speaker does n't know much at all , e.g business partners . 
  * ** p\u0259k ** / ` p\u0259k / - humble honourific . 
  somewhat self-deprecating , although not as much as using the humble 1st person pronoun . 
  * ** p\u0259kala ** / ` p\u0259kala / - humble female honourific . 
  usually used by women who want to indicate that they are married and not available . 
  * ** l\u0259 ** / ` l\u0259 / - polite honourific used by males to females . 
  * ** \u0259lat ** / ' \u0259lat / - polite honourific used by females to males . 
  estonian * peegel * is loaned through middle low german * spegel * . 
  initial consonant clusters are simplified in loans in estonian . 
  e.g :, 
  * middle low german * storm * -  estonian * torm * `` storm '', 
  * old east slavic * kr\u012dst\u016d * -  estonian * rist * `` cross '', 
  if the consonant cluster consists of 3 consonants , then only 1 is lost :, 
  * middle low german * straffe * , or german * strafe * -  estonian * trahv * `` fine '' , `` penalty '', 
  however , some words have the consonant cluster preserved :, 
  * middle low german * kr\u0101n * , or german * krahn * , * kran * -  estonian * kraan * `` faucet '', 
  * german * klave * -  estonian * klahv * `` key '' ( on a keyboard ), 
  * middle low german * gr\u0101ve * -  estonian * kraav * `` ditch '', 
  there were/are finns in ingria , who were/are lutheran , as opposed to the local orthodox izhorians . 
  but karelians are usually considered distinct . 
  actually , baltic german was a high german dialect that evolved later , after low german 's decline . 
  we have some loans specifically from that dialect , e.g ** kemmerg ** `` toilet '' from baltic german * k\u00e4mmerchen * , and ** klimp ** `` dumpling '' , `` lump '' , from baltic german * klimpe * , but also possibly from swedish * klimp *, 
  * question-cop be-inf or no-inf be-inf *, 
  * the question 's to be , or to not to be *, 
  note : * f\u0259p * `` or '' also means `` but '' , `` and '' , `` although '' . 
  `` and '' usually translates to ** f\u0259 ** / ` p\u02b0\u0259 / , which is it 's primary meaning . 
  ** f\u0259p ** has the meanings of `` but '' , `` and '' , `` although '' , `` or '' , `` though '' , `` even '', 
  no , using ** f\u0259 ** in that sentence would only mean `` apple and orange '', 
  to say `` apple or orange '' you would use ** f\u0259p ** , but it could also mean `` apple and orange '' . 
  you can use the same word for them , but usually not . 
   native estonian words that have syllable final clusters ,, 
  yes . 
  these exist because estonian has lost final vowels in nominative . 
  e.g :, 
  * ** part ** `` duck '' - from original ** partti ** , seen in votic, 
  * ** jooks ** `` a run '' - derived from `` jooksma '' , from original ** jooksu ** , seen in finnish * juoksu * , and because the genitive ends with - u. 
   initial cluster with c and an l or r , or are these just in borrowings ? 
  there are a few onomatopoetic words that do have initial clusters . 
  they are usually derived from variants without the cluster . 
  * ** krahmama ** `` to grab '' < -  ** rahmama ** `` to do a sudden movement '', 
  * ** kriipima ** `` to scrape '' , `` to scratch '' < -  ** riipima ** `` to scrape '' , `` to scratch '' ( but a bit rarer ), 
  but a vast majority are borrowings from various german dialects . 
  yes . 
  takanaa distinguishes between / k / , / p / , / t / , and / k\u02b0 / , / p\u02b0 / , / t\u02b0 / , written as `` x '' , `` f '' , '' \u00fe '' . 
  there is also a palatalised series : / k\u02b2 / , / p\u02b2 / , / t\u02b2 / - written as `` g '' , `` b '' , `` d '' . 
  there are no voiced stops . 
  there are a few words where the only difference is aspiration :, 
  * ** tata ** / ` tata / `` question '' vs ** \u00fea\u00fea ** / ` t\u02b0at\u02b0a / `` sun '' , `` sky '' , `` cloud '', 
  * ** ka ** / ` ka / `` due to '' , `` because of '' ; `` oh !, 
  '' , `` oh but sadly ! '', 
  vs ** xa ** / ` k\u02b0a / `` fire '' , `` danger '', 
  * ** ta ** / ` ta / - forms questions expecting a `` yes '' answer ; informal 2nd person singular pronoun vs ** \u00fea ** / ` t\u02b0a / `` light '', 
  * ** pa ** / ` pa / `` droplet '' vs ** fa ** / ` p\u02b0a / `` water '', 
  thanks !, 
  no , but i did start writing a [ document ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/14s-mty2zn7kuxelxmihkennpb0lfrriyg794j8z5040/edit?usp=sharing ) on the grammar , but it is unfinished and a bit outdated . 
  i 'll try to update it . 
  firework - ** xapu ** / ` k\u02b0apu / - derived from * xa * `` fire '' , `` danger '' . 
  also means `` explosive '' . 
  the * - pu * element is most likely onomatopoetic . 
  new year 's eve - ** ana\u015b ilatatan kadda\u00fei ** / ` ana\u0283 ` ilatatan ` ka\u0256at\u02b0i / - * new year-gen1 night-3sg-poss *, 
  new year - ** ana\u015b ilatat ** / ` ana\u0283 ` ilatat / - * ilatat * is derived from * ilat * `` time '' , `` age '' , `` period '' . 
  but most people would just say ** k\u0259t\u0259 nulu s\u0259t\u0259 \u015bap\u0259 ** / ` k\u0259t\u0259 ` nulu 's \u0259t\u0259 ' \u0283ap\u0259 / * two zero one seven *, 
  sparklers - ** xapu ** / ` k\u02b0apu / - the same word as for fireworks and explosives, 
  nip\u0259 - k\u0259t\u0259 nulu s\u0259t\u0259 xap\u0259 **, 
  * right.now-cop current-adj year-gen1 final-adj day-3sg-poss-cop . 
  in.conclusion - two zero one six *, 
  * right now 's current year 's final day his is . 
  in conclusion , two zero one six *, 
  because of the day takanaa handles western dates , this is broken up into two sentences . 
  there are 2 ways to keep track of time : with either the western gregorian calender , or the traditional year system , named after either major events or the year of the king 's reign . 
  certain villages also use the village shaman 's name and age . 
  gregorian months are still used , due to western influence . 
  so , in the traditional year-system , you could say this sentence in 2 additional ways :, 
  * right.now-cop one-after-3 . eights-ordinal time.of.peace-gen1 year-gen1 final-adj day-3sg-poss-cop *, 
  * right now 's 25th peacetime 's year 's final day his is . 
  the current era dictated by major events is ** \u015basalat ** `` time of peace '' - which started when the soviet union fell in 1991 . 
  * right.now-cop six-after-ordinal s\u0259tata-gen1 year-gen1 final-adj year-3sg-poss-cop *, 
  * right now 's 14th s\u0259tata 's year 's final year his is . 
  the current king , s\u0259tata , started his rule in 2002 , so this is his 14th year . 
  usually , the `` final day of x 's yth year '' would be the day before he got crowned y years later , but the end of the gregorian year y years later is also used . 
  next to none . 
  schadenfreude is one i can think of . 
  do you mean `` proto-germanic '' instead ? 
  that 's very interesting . 
  estonian : ** maasikas ** . 
  derived from * manner * / * mander * , meaning `` continent '' . 
  finnish * mansikka * is a cognate . 
  the connection to the earth is seen in neighbouring languages aswell : latvian * zemene * from * zeme * `` earth '' , russian * zemljanika * from * zemlja * `` land '' , swedish * jordgubbe * , from * jord * `` earth '' , german * erdbeere * from * erde * `` earth '' . 
  in a trip to the country , the lassiter v16 police that 's involved in the lucas bertone subquest ( you have to warn some guy from the police ; a highway patrol lassiter later shows up and they surround the place ) is located more or less where you 've marked on the map . 
  you can glitch inside through the wall ( a pole has no collision ) , and you can find that lassiter parked there . 
  if you take the car and do the subquest , upon starting it , the car teleports . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_45oephgr9a ) a video of it . 
   richard, 
  sometimes written as `` rihhard '' aswell . 
  the traditional pronounciation is / ` rih : \u0251rd / , but today under english influence / ` rit\u0283\u0251rd / can be seen aswell . 
  it 's a quite rare name though . 
  he was very popular around the time when he won the gold in 2008 , but i have n't really heard from him recently . 
  discus throw is n't very popular , but it 's known .
