  `` month of n\u00e4\u00e4r '' ( a holiday that used to be celebrated during new years ' ) . 
  : * n\u00e4\u00e4rid * ) comes from middle low german * niej\u0101r * , * nij\u0101r * ( compare english * new year * ) . 
  during the soviet occupation the word was also used for christmas , because christmas ( * j\u00f5ulud * ) had a religious connotation . 
  `` heart month '' , because january is the `` heart '' or centre of the winter . 
  `` bead 's month '', 
  `` new years ' month '' . 
  `` beginning 's month '', 
  nobody really does , they have been used traditionally but only certain pagans use traditional month names nowadays . 
  they can be used in a poetic manner aswell . 
  my native language is estonian and i 'm fluent in english . 
  i 've studied russian but i 'm bad at it . 
  i can understand some finnish , lithuanian , and latvian aswell , but not anything major . 
  finnish because it 's similar to estonian , and lithuanian/latvian because my first conlang was baltic , so i read about them . 
  i do n't have any formal linguistic education . 
  that would be occitan , which is near-extinct nowadays . 
  it 's quite different from standard french , but it 's closely related to catalan . 
  also , * kont * is what dogs eat , and fish have * luu * . 
   heart 's so broken i ca n't help but laugh, 
  * i-dat to.be.in.pain-3sg-prs heart so much , that-rel i-dat is.not [ contraction of `` ne yr ( a ) '' ( no be-3sg-prs ) + emphatic '' - es '' ; but `` yr ( a ) '' is only used in dialects . 
  it 's only used in the standard language as a part of this contraction ] nothing.else-acc do-inf except laugh-gerund-dat *, 
  * to me is in pain heart so much , that to me ai n't nothing else to do except laughing *, 
   a country can be judged by the quality of it 's proverbs, 
  / 's \u02b2e : men ` gal\u02b2a ` ju : dikeri ` kin ` janaus ` verbu : n ` ka : litati /, 
  * land-acc-f can-3sg-prs judge-inf with she-poss-gen-n proverb-gen-pl-n quality-dat *, 
  * land can to judge with her proverb 's quality *, 
  my sentence/phrase : ** you know , the world is n't run by the laws written on paper . 
  it 's run by people . 
  there are a many theories for the baltic words :, 
   1 ) from a region in sweden . 
  possibly related to the vagoths . 
   2 ) from proto-indo-european * wek\u02b7 - `` to speak '' . 
  compare old prussian `` wackis '' - `` shout '' , `` war cry '' . 
  so it has the meaning of `` those who shout '' . 
  those are n't required ; many natlangs just repeat the verb ( although you would have a negative particle , affix or verb ), 
  i do n't know much about east asian languages , but is this a chinese/vietnamese conlang that is related to them , or just inspired by them ? 
  cool . 
  how similar is it to the modern chinese languages , like mandarin ? 
  my conscript for takanaa ( an abugida ) has only one punctuation mark . 
  it looks like more or less like a capital `` z '' , and it translates more or less to the latin semicolon ; separating thoughts . 
  there are no spaces , although the next line usually starts with a new word ( so you do n't split words at the end of lines ) . 
  i 've got a question about ergativity . 
  is it naturalistic for the agent to be in the absolutive case when the object is indirect , but ergative when the object is direct ? 
  an example from a conlang i 've been working on :, 
  `` i saw the man '' ( or , more accurately , `` i saw the man , but i do n't see him anymore '' ), 
  * i-erg def-art-sg man-abs see-pst *, 
  `` i went to the school '' ( or , more accurately : `` i went to school , and i 'm still there '' ), 
  / ` to : n ' \u0251 ' \u0292go : l\u02b2u ' \u00e6jus\u025bu /, 
  * i-abs def-art-sg school-lat go-pfv *, 
  interesting , thanks . 
  yes , in this case it 's required by the verb . 
  how about the sentence :, 
  `` i gave a cigarette to a man '', 
  / ` to : n ` p\u0252 : ri 's \u0259k\u00e6rit ' \u0283y : j\u025bu /, 
  * i-abs man-dat cigarette-abs give-pfv *, 
  would this be naturalistic ? 
  ok , thanks a lot . 
  the most popular religion in estonia is orthodox christianity . 
  16 % are orthodox , but only 10 % are lutheran . 
  traditionally , it was lutheranism , but estonians are no longer religious ( you could argue that we never really were , but during a period from the arosal of the moravian church in the 18th century until the early 20th century we were definitely more religious than now ) , and russian immigrants are religious . 
  setos , who are orthodox estonians , are also more religious . 
  not really . 
  only one thing strikes out for me : many definite articles . 
  those sound like noun classes , but having 2 different systems of the same concept is weird . 
  estonian * \u00f5li * only refers to olive and machine oil . 
  petroleum , often called * oil * , is ** nafta ** . 
  cognate to english * naphtha * , from latin * naphtha * , from ancient greek * \u03bd\u03ac\u03c6\u03b8\u03b1 * ( n\u00e1phtha ) , ultimately from old persian * * ( naft ) . 
  oh , yeah , i forgot about that . 
  non-religious people are definitely the majority , there is no question here . 
  also * \u00f5li * . 
  very interesting . 
  this is a different phenomenon from noun classes , it seems . 
  yes . 
  a conlang i 've been working on has this :, 
  there are a lot of prepositions , and the ending phoneme of a preposition triggers consonant mutations of the initial consonant of the next word . 
  if a word begins with a vowel , then no mutation takes place . 
  there are 4 different types of mutations . 
  * weak - this is triggered by prepositions ending in vowels . 
  the change is usually palatalisation , but stops have various other changes . 
  ( e.g voiceless stops are deleted ) . 
  example : ** poarh ** / ` p\u0252 : r / `` a man '' -  ** sag bpoare ** / 's \u0251 ' \u0252 : ri / `` using a man '', 
  * mixed - this is triggered by prepositions ending in voiced stops . 
  the changes are too varied to sum up . 
  example : ** poarh ** / ` p\u0252 : r / `` a man '' -  ** togat boari ** / ` t\u0251j\u00e6d ' \u03b2\u0252 : r\u0259 / `` under a man '', 
  * nasal - this is triggered by prepositions ending in nasal consonants ( / n / and / m / ) . 
  the change is usually a prefix of / m / ( sometimes / \u0259m / , but it 's usually dropped ) , but / g / and / k / turn into / \u014b /, 
  example : ** poarh ** / ` p\u0252 : r / `` a man '' -  ** gunn mboari ** / ` gun \u1d4a ` mb\u0252 : r\u0259 / `` next to a man '', 
  * strong - this is triggered by prepositions ending in all other consonants . 
  the change is usually gemination , or devoicing in the case of voiced stops . 
  example : ** poarh ** / ` p\u0252 : r / `` a man '' -  ** alh foare ** / ' \u00e6l ` f\u0252 : r\u0259 / `` about a man '' , `` concerning a man '', 
  by the way , ipa is taught here in estonia as a part of english lessons . 
  lessons begin from about form 3 ( age ~ 8-9 ) . 
  we have the the rp pronunciation of english words written with ipa ( although it 's broad transcription ) . 
  it 's restricted to english ; we never learn ipa for estonian or russian ( which is the most common third language taught ) . 
  i do n't know if ipa is used for teaching german , since it 's only taught in cities . 
  i 'm willing to bet that other european countries do something similar . 
  a posteriori conlangs are simply conlangs that base their elements on existing languages , or are related to them . 
  they can be either realistic or mostly realistic ( a descendant or dialect of a real language ) , or not realistic ( mixing different languages that would n't realistically mix ) . 
  old church slavonic is not the originator of all slavic languages . 
  it was based on a south slavic dialect spoken near thessaloniki during the 9th century . 
  it 's not too far off though ; proto-slavic was spoken only a few centuries earlier , and the differences between slavic dialects at the time were n't big .
