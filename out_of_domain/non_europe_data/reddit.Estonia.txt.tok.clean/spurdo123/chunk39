  a great article besides that , though . 
   if you want it naturalistic you should consider adding nasal vowels , a lot of natural languages have them, 
  well , sure , but this is just the choice of the conlanger . 
  of european languages only a couple have nasal vowels ( french , polish , portuguese off the top of my head ) . 
  or you could do what latin did , where vowels before nasal consonants are nasalised . 
  it 's not like it 's an universal feature . 
   and you could use diacritics, 
  both diacritic-heavy and diacritic-less orthographies are fine . 
  just a stylistic choice . 
   or tones, 
  sure !, 
  i.e my point is that , the conlanger himself chooses how his conlang is . 
  all conlangs do n't have to be naturalistic ( unless you have a very specific goal , that involves the conlang being naturalistic ) .

  estonian * nautima * and latvian * nauda * are indeed cognates , but only through proto-indo-european . 
  the estonian word is borrowed from finnish * nauttia * , which is from proto-germanic * neutan\u0105 , ultimately from / proto-indo-european * newd - `` to seize '' . 
  the latvian word is ultimately also from that same pie root .

  in sernerdas , occupational suffixes have masculine and feminine forms . 
  the masculine form is the `` default '' one and is used when the gender is unknown . 
  here are the main suffixes :, 
  * ** - ( t ) \u014dr ** vs ** - tr\u012bkes **, 
  examples :, 
  * ** ospitaleites ** / ` uospital\u0250ites / `` male doctor '' , `` doctor in general '' vs ** ospitaleit\u0113 ** / ` uospital\u0250ite : / `` female doctor '' [ pronounciation can also be / upita ` l\u0250ites / or / uspita ` l\u0250ites / ], 
  * ** siud\u014dr ** / 's \u02b2udo : r / `` killer '' ; vs ** siudytr\u012bkes ** / s\u02b2ud\u0268 ` tri : kes / `` female killer '' ( rarely used ), 
  * ** tirtineikas ** / tirti ` n\u0250ikas / `` hero '' , `` tough guy '' ; vs ** tirtineika ** / tirti ` n\u0250ika / `` heroine '' , `` tough girl '',

  / a ` k\u02b0a /, 
  * thank.you [ formal ] !, 
  most derivational affixes added to the verb in takanaa deal with the length of the action , although some deal with other things aswell . 
  * ** ili - ** / ili / - derives frequentative verbs [ to do x often ], 
  * ** \u015ba - ** / \u0283a / - derives verbs with the meaning of `` to do x for a long time '', 
  * ** l\u0259 - ** / l\u0259 / - to do x more and more over time [ this is called the progressive aspect , i think ], 
  * ** lu - ** / lu / - to do x more than before, 
  * ** k\u0259 - ** / k\u0259 / - to stop doing x, 
  * ** k\u0259l\u0259 - ** / k\u0259l\u0259 / - to do x less and less over time, 
  * ** sa - ** / sa / - to do x once, 
  * ** \u015bu - ** / \u0283u / - to do x in advance, 
  * ** pi - ** / pi / - to do x instantly , to do x as quickly as possible, 
  * ** x\u0259 - ** / k\u02b0\u0259 / - to do x with bad intentions, 
  * ** s\u0259 - ** / s\u0259 / - to do x with good intentions, 
  * ** laga - ** / lak\u02b2a / - to do x accidentally [ involitive ], 
  * ** ga - ** / k\u02b2a / - to do x intentionally [ volitive ], 
  interesting . 
  do you have inflected prepositions or just contractions ? 
  ; e.g in * ur ` mne * . 
  estonian also has ** verev ** ( `` blood-red '' ; from * veri * `` blood '' ), 
  in takanaa : / \u0281 / ( also can be [ \u0280 ] ) , which is not that rare . 
  many european languages have it . 
  in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl : / \u0264 / . 
  bulgarian , estonian , and votic have this . 
  in sernerdas : / \u0268 / , which is quite common . 
  russian , polish , and v\u00f5ro have this . 
  some proto-baltic and proto-germanic words are similar enough to the point where it is impossible to tell from what source the word came into proto-finnic . 
  e.g estonian ** rand ** , finnish ** ranta ** `` beach '' may come from either proto-norse * stran\u0111a , or / proto-baltic * kranta . 
  estonian ** latakas ** `` a big piece '' , `` a blow '' , and finnish ** lattea ** `` flat '' may come from either proto-germanic * flataz `` flat '' , or proto-baltic ? 
  ( compare lithuanian `` platus '' - wide , open ) [ the - kas is a common suffix in estonian ], 
  estonian ** naine ** and finnish ** nainen ** are ultimately from proto-uralic , with ** - inen ** suffixed . 
  khanty ** n\u00e4j ** and mansi ** n\u0101j ** are cognates , meaning `` honourable lady '' , `` countess '' , `` godess '' , `` fire '', 
  the verb ** naida ** ( `` to marry '' , in both estonian and finnish , although it is a rare word in estonian ) is a suffixless version of the stem . 
  hungarian ** n\u0151 ** might be related . 
  thanks . 
  speaking of mid vowels , takanaa has a single mid vowel that can range from / e\u031e / to / \u0259 / to / \u0264\u031e / . 
  i write it as / \u0259 / , but usually pronounce it as / \u0264\u031e / ~ / \u0264 / . 
  regarding / \u0264 / , the only reason it exists in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl is because of the vowel harmony system . 
  it is a finnic conlang , so this might be familiar to some :, 
  front vowels | back vowels, 
  / i / ; / y / | / u /, 
  / e / ; / \u00f8 / | / \u0264 / ; / o /, 
  / \u00e6 / | / \u0251 /, 
  / i / is a neutral vowel , which means it can exist in all positions . 
  / e / was a neutral vowel in proto-finnic , but in southern finnic languages ( including m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ) , the sound shifted to / \u0264 / in words with back-vowel harmony . 
  so , compare :, 
  * estonian : * v\u00f5lg * / ` v\u0264l\u0261\u030a /, 
  takanaa has an inferential system . 
  the inferential aspect is marked on the verb if the action was n't witnessed by the speaker . 
  e.g : `` the hero died , apparently . '', 
  ( the speaker heard of this from someone else ) :, 
  ** / ` pa\u0281atawat\u0259n\u0259ti / - * die.hero-incorporated-inferential-pst *, 
  morpheme-by-morpheme : * parat-awata-\u0259-n\u0259t-i * - * die-hero - ( incorporated form ) - ( inferential aspect ) - ( past tense ) *, 
  they were colloquially known as * turkey * for a long time .
