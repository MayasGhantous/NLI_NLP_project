  it 's also used a lot in constructing other numbers , e.g 12 is `` didikos '' , so you could write it as 22kos , but that would be quite odd . 
  the word for neuter 4 is `` kvos '' , and there are some words that end with this , e.g `` akvos '' ( water ) - a4, 
  small correction : the estonian word does not come from old norse . 
  there are 3 possible sources :, 
  * old high german st\u016br, 
  * low german st\u016br, 
  source : http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=suur&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et, 
  this is what i 'd do :, 
   a \u00e1, 
   e \u00e9, 
   i \u00ed, 
   o \u00f3, 
   \u00f8 \u01ff ( not sure about this one ), 
   u \u00fa, 
   y \u00fd, 
  standalone long vowels :, 
   \u0101 \u0113 \u014d, 
  diphthongs :, 
   ai au ei oi ou ( this seems to be fine ), 
   \u00e8 ( what sound was the schwa originally ? 
  if schwas developed from `` a '' you could have \u00e0 or romanian \u0103 , if they developed from / \u00e6 / you could have '' \u00e4 '' , if from `` i '' you could have \u00ec or romanian \u00ee etc ), 
  consonants :, 
   p t k b d g, 
   r l m ng ( do you have the / ng / sequence ? ), 
  nj j h, 
  note : if / ts / are / t\u0283 / are very common phonemes , they could be represented with c and \u0107 . 
  it 's definitely of indo-european origin . 
  pie * ma\u0123o - ( also * me\u01f5 ( \u02b0 ) - , * mag ( \u02b0 ) - ) is the source ( compare greek `` mega '' ) , but from what source it came into estonian is n't known . 
  either an older loan from pie itself or a newer loan from e.g latvian itself . 
  compare old saxon mak\u014dn ( to make , to build ) . 
  the germanic version of this root ( * mak\u014d ( ja ) n - ) was possibly later borrowed into estonian as `` magama '' ( to sleep ), 
  if you 're doing anything related to linguistics/conlanging , i heavily suggest learning ipa , it will help a lot . 
  e.g what is the difference in pronounciation between '' \u00e6 '' and `` e '' ? 
  this map just uses an awful transliteration system . 
  yep . 
  loads of them . 
  german rule for 800 years and contact with germanic peoples before that for hundreds of years left a big mark . 
  about 25 % vocabulary is of germanic origin . 
  fun fact : the word `` eesti '' is actually a loanword from german `` este '' . 
  it became popular in the 19th century during the national awakening . 
  the natives called themselves `` maarahvas '' ( land-people ) and the language `` maakeel '' ( land-language ) before that . 
  there was no name for the land itself of estonia , since there was no concept of an united estonia . 
  interesting . 
  this is contrary to what i 've been told in the past . 
   `` i forgot my bag on the bus '', 
  i 'm a non-native speaker , but i would use an allative or illative ( onto , into ) preposition here . 
  this is probably wrong though and influenced by my native language ( estonian , where you would use the illative case in this sentence translated ), 
  the name is `` sernerdas '', 
  in the language it means `` standard '' ( noun ) ( e.g `` jazz standard '' is `` sernerdas c\u00e9san '' ), 
  i actually got the name by asking [ cleverbot ] ( https://cleverbot.com ) what i should name my language . 
  it answered `` serious nerd '' so that turned into `` sernerdas '' . 
  / u/trollabot spurdo123, 
  somewhere between balto-slavic and romance . 
  e.g the dual number is alive and well . 
  there is a locative case that is heavily used but there is no instrumental nor ablative . 
  an existential clause is used to represent possession much like in russian . 
  this is represented with the dative case . 
  e.g `` i am cold '' -  `` m\u00ed est frig\u00f3ris '', 
  * m\u00ed - dative of `` ego '' - `` i '', 
  * est - 3rd person singular indicative of `` estius '' - `` to be '', 
  * frig\u00f3ris - `` cold '' , adjective, 
  osrs actually , since i 'm a member here . 
  i was a f2p back in the day for a very long time . 
  cia agentas : '' \u00c1r etraiti kvudem , tu be ` mortab ? '', 
  / a : r / , `` if '', 
  / e ` traiti / , `` i pull off '' ,, 
  / ` kvudem / , accusative of `` kvudes '' or `` kvud '' , `` that '', 
  / tu / , `` you '', 
   be ` mortab, 
  / be ` muortab / , `` to die '' in conditional ( present , but future and present are identical ) 2nd person singular, 
  / uoks / , `` it '' , `` this '', 
   be ` fueru, 
  / befu'eru / , `` to be '' in conditonal ( future ) , 3rd person singular, 
   l\u00e1bes, 
  / la : bes / , `` very '' or `` extremely '', 
  / ` skausmis / , literally `` pain '' with the adjective ending, 
   iest, 
  / ` jest / , `` to be '' in 2nd person singular indicative . 
  note , this is not palatalised like the russian '' \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c '', 
  / mu : nas / , `` man '', 
   per, 
  / per / , causal preposition that governs the dative in common gender , dative preposition that governs the dative-accusative ( identical ) in neuter gender , in this case a causal preposition . 
   tucu, 
  / tutsu / , `` tu '' ( you ) in dative ,, 
  tu ne ` patirtevist shakespeare-m usk\u00e9s tu skaitytevist \u00edm in originalit klingon-at, 
  * you neg-experience-presentperfect shakespeare-acc . 
  until you read-presentperfect he-acc . 
  in original-loc . 
  pronounciations of the names have been adapted to suit the phonology , but the writing has n't changed . 
  the `` tu '' can be omitted , and word order is completely free . 
  so a more formal sov order would be :, 
  shakespeare-m ne ` patirtevist usk\u00e9s \u00edm in originalit klingon-at skaitytevist, 
  ** est\u00fa esti d\u00e9kas genei \u00famorum in oxet kusmat . 
  est\u00fa esti - i do n't know exactly how to explain this construction . 
  but `` est\u00fa '' is similar in meaning to the adverbial present active participle ( while being ) , but it has a slightly different meaning . 
  something like `` in being '' . 
  in estonian this is called the inessive of the - ma infinitive . 
  and `` esti '' is the 3rd person plural form . 
  cont : ten type-plural human-acc : plural in this-locative world-locative, 
  no , but certain grammatical oddities are influenced by it since it 's my native language .
