  a breakdown of `` on reddit gifts '' and the genitive/possessive constructs there :, 
  * gen2 [ * - anap * ] - this indicates that there are multible possessions [ in this case gifts ], 
  * sg - this indicates that there is only one reddit . 
  * ine [ * - aap * ] - inessive ; in this case answers to the question `` where ? '', 
  * pl [ * - ak * ] - plural - there are multible gifts . 
  * poss-3sg [ * - i\u00fei * ] - this indicates that the possessor is not the speaker nor the listener , and that there is only one possessor . 
  [ in this case reddit ], 
  * pl [ * - p * ] - this indicates that there are multible possessions [ in this case gifts ], 
  so , grammatical number is marked twice . 
  in the second genitive [ it is the second genitive because there are multible possessions ; and there is no plural marker , so there is a singular possessor ] , and in the possessive suffix [ the possessor is singular 3rd person , and the plural marker means that there are multible possessions ], 
  finnish ** kiitos ** and estonian ** kiitus ** `` praise '' are from proto-baltic * geid - . 
  compare lithuanian `` giedoti '' - `` to sing '', 
  yep . 
  from proto-baltic * geid - `` to sing '' . 
  in estonian the meaning has turned into `` to praise '' . 
  it probably just means `` missing etymology '' . 
  anyway , * hiiglane * is derived from * hiigel - * `` giant '' , which is derived from * hiis * `` holy forest '' , `` holy place '' ( pagan ), 
  yes , that 's a better translation . 
  for me they are almost interchangeable . 
  ( central estonia ), 
  * n\u00e4pistama * also means `` to pinch '' . 
  '' \u00e4a '' is very odd , and definitely not danish . 
  danish has '' \u00e6 '' , not '' \u00e4 '' . 
  `` zs '' is distinctly hungarian , where it represents the `` g '' sound in `` mirage '' [ \u0292 ] . 
  latvian also has it [ e.g `` d\u0101rzs '' - garden ; `` arb\u016bzs '' - watermelon ; `` b\u0113rzs '' - birch ] , but it has no impact on pronounciation , it 's pronounced the same as `` s '' [ s ] ( it might be geminated , i 'm not sure ) . 
  the `` s '' exists because they 're masculine nouns , and latvian has lost the historical vowel . 
  so proto-baltic * ber\u017aas became `` ber\u017eas '' in lithuanian , but `` b\u0113rzs '' in latvian . 
  chiming in as someone who has no prior nostalgia with the series , and started with skyrim . 
  skyrim was a good game , although not in the ways morrowind is a great game . 
  i had lots of fun playing both . 
  i could n't get into oblivion though . 
  from first glance ( i played maybe ~ 2 hours ) it seemed that it just did n't have the action-gameplay of skyrim , or the world , story , and rpg elements of morrowind . 
  it probably gets better later , but i ` ve n't bothered . 
   the welsh have been in the british isles for 30,000 years, 
  the welsh people , as in genetically ? 
  maybe to some extent , but i find that hard to believe . 
  anyway , subsequent migrations have altered the genetic makeup . 
  the welsh culture and language , definitely not . 
  the indo-european migrations happened ~ 3000-5000 years ago . 
  the welsh language became distinct from the other celtic languages much later . 
  yep . 
  `` kike '' has the diphthong / a\u026a / , while `` kiik '' ( estonian for `` swing '' , where the name comes from ) has the long vowel / i : / . 
   picking sounds you ca n't pronounce, 
  i 'm guilty of this . 
  i ca n't pronounce / \u0268 / or / \u0259 / properly ( i pronounce them as / \u0264 / ) , but i still have them . 
  also , distinguishing / \u0252 / and / o / is very difficult for me , but one of my conlangs distinguishes them . 
  estonian . 
  i 'm not sure , but i might be able to pronounce it . 
  st. olms canal south-two . 
  i took the place over after killing dro'sakhar ( a fighters guild bounty ) . 
  i also have some things ( namely a daedric bow ) in a crate at the balmora fighters guild , but i do n't use it that much because people think i 'm a thief if i take anything from it , unless i cast chameleon first . 
  in estonian , there are three vowel lengths . 
  so , / s\u0251d\u0325\u0251 / * hundred * , / s\u0251 :d \u0325\u0251 / * send-imp * , and / s\u0251 : :d \u0325\u0251 / * get-inf * are all distinct . 
  estonian also has a 100 or so very commonly used roots that have been created ex nihilo ( out of nothing ) by language reformers in the late 19th and early 20th century . 
  although many of them have been influenced by other languages [ e.g * laip * '' ( dead ) body '' has obviously been influenced by german * leib * `` body '' ] . 
  do other languages have this ? 
  in terms of vocabulary , there is an interesting word : * leheneeger * `` journalist '' ( usually a slur ) , but literally `` paper nigger '' , or `` paper black person '' ( * neeger * has traditionally not been offensive , the modern pc alternative is * mustanahaline * `` black-skinned '' , but it 's a clumsy word in my opinion , and it comes with a problem , because * must * means both `` black '' and `` dirty '' ), 
  yes , that 's an unvoiced alveolar stop , but it 's not [ t ] . 
  i think the term was `` lax voice '' . 
  anyway , they 're different sounds , that 's certain . 
  parts of estonia and latvia are orthodox . 
  the oldest community being the setos in setomaa in southeastern estonia ( converted around ~ 1000-1200 ) , the next oldest are the ethnic russian old believers in a few areas on the western coast of lake peipus ( came here around ~ 1600-1700 ) . 
  the newest russophone orthodox community came here from 1945-1990 . 
  they live in parts of ida-virumaa and tallinn . 
  latvia only has that final wave , i 'm pretty sure . 
  it might be lenis , yes . 
  i 've seen `` lax '' and `` slack '' being used aswell . 
  yes , the difference is only for plosives . 
  so : [ \u0261\u030a ] , [ b\u0325 ] , and [ d\u0325 ] contrast with [ k ] , [ p ] , and [ t ] . 
  notation is a bit iffy . 
  there is a diacritic for `` weak articulation '' and a diacritic for `` voicelessness '' ( which i used ) , and both can be used for this phenomenon . 
  interesting . 
  how well known are they ? 
  ( in latgale , in latvia ? ), 
  in takanaa , the passive is generally formed with the element * - p - * , with some additional changes . 
  also , the word order changes in passive clauses from vso to svo . 
  in the 1st conjugation [ verbs with infinitives ending in * - k * ] , the passive is formed regularly with the prefix * pa - * attached to the verb . 
  example : ** kakataak ** * attack-inf * - , 
  * ** kakat\u0259 tara \u00fea ** * attack-prs man i-acc * - * attacks man me * `` the man attacks me '', 
  * ** taraja pakakat\u0259m \u00fei ** * man-abl pass-attack-prs-pass i * - * from the man is attacked i * `` i am attacked by the man '', 
  so , * kakat\u0259 * -  * pakakat\u0259m * . 
  in the 2nd conjugation [ verbs with infinitives ending in * - m * ] , the passive is formed with various suffixes . 
  example : ** pidum ** * give-inf * - , 
  * ** piduxad\u0259ni \u00fei axataakamipi ** * give.money-incorporated-pst i friend-apulative-poss-1sg * - * gavemoney i next to friend my * `` i gave money to my friend '', 
  * ** \u00feu piduxad\u0259pip axataakamipi ** * i-abl give.money-incorporated-pass-pst friend-apulative-poss-1sg * - * from i wasgivenmoney next to friend my * `` money was given to my friend by me '', 
  so , * pidu ( xad\u0259 ) ni * -  * pidu ( xad\u0259 ) pip *, 
   ablative case, 
  to expand : in finnic languages it has the specific meaning of `` from on top '' . 
  the elative case is used for the meaning of `` from inside '' . 
  for placenames , it varies . 
  in estonian , i would say * t\u00fcrilt * `` from t\u00fcri '' - in the ablative , but * tallinnast * `` from tallinn '' - in the elative . 
  to say `` from home '' , you would use the exessive case , which in estonian only exists for a handful of nouns ( i can think of 2 ) , so it 's * kodunt * , instead of * kodult * or * kodust * ( ablative and elative , respectively , although they can be used in certain situations ) . 
  some languages also use it to mark the agent of a passive clause . 
  [ e.g * it is done by me * - * by me * would be the 1st person singular pronoun in the ablative ], 
  latin uses the ablative for instrumental solely because the historical instrumental case and ablative case fused . 
  this is a historical peculiarity unique to latin . 
  those are all very regular changes .
