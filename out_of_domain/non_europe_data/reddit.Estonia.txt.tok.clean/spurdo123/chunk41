  finnic languages do n't have the [ \u0283 ] sound natively . 
  * h -  \u00d8 in votic and livonian . 
  also in colloquial estonian to some extent . 
  * ei -  ie in all balto-slavic languages except for old prussian and certain lithuanian dialects ( namely samogitian , which can be seen on the map ) . 
  finnic languages have retained the `` ei '' . 
  also , you might wonder why the finnic languages do n't have the * - s * ending like lithuanian and latvian do . 
  this is a later development in latvian and lithuanian , where neuter nouns became masculine . 
  the final * - n * was most likely dropped because it is morphologically unusual for finnic languages . 
  a lot of our nouns end in vowels . 
  ( estonian and veps of course lost these final vowels later ) . 
  and because `` ei '' is a front diphthong , the ending vowel became '' \u00e4 '' [ \u00e6 ] , to correspond with vowel harmony . 
  although both `` e '' and `` i '' are neutral vowels in proto-finnic . 
  e.g , proto-balto-slavic * \u017aambas becomes finnish/estonian `` hammas '' , and lithuanian '' \u017eambas '' . 
  the latin word is simply a cognate ( it shares a common ancestor in proto-indo-european ) . 
  proto-finnic borrowed its word from proto-baltic . 
  estonian * hirv * only refers to the genus * cervus * . 
  they are rare outside of hiiumaa and saaremaa . 
  the word * kits * ( or more specifically , * metskits * - lit . 
  `` forest deer '' ) refers to the genus * capreolus * and is much more widely used . 
  it comes from german * kitz ( e ) * and also means `` goat '' . 
  there is also the word * kaber * that refers to * capreolus * but it 's rare . 
  missing finnic languages :, 
  what language is * kem * ? 
  the area seems to indicate izhorian . 
  * ludic : ** \u010fumal **, 
  * mari : ** jumo ** [ cyrillic should be ** \u044e\u043c\u043e ** ], 
  all come from proto-finno-permic * juma . 
  the same root exists in erzya and moksha aswell . 
  possibly from proto-indo-iranian * diyumna . 
  compare sanskrit `` dyum\u0101n '' - `` heavenly '' , `` shiny '' ( idk the devanagari ), 
  fun fact : in estonian , * jumala * means `` very '' . 
  interesting . 
  probably so . 
  o -  \u00f5 is a regular change in votic , while o -  e seems irregular . 
  for me , * kits * almost always refers to * capreolus * . 
  goats ai n't that common . 
  what is the source for valga/walk/valka being germanic ? 
  i can find one etymology , stating that it 's from estonian * valge * ( earlier * valkeda * , * valketa * ) , meaning `` white '' [ ultimately either finno-mari or finno-ugric ], 
  also , * viljandi * is supposedly derived from * vili * `` fruit '' - which is a proto-indo-european loan , or possibly from proto-balto-slavic . 
  plus the suffix * - ndi * . 
  an alternative etymology is * vilja * ( genitive of * vili * ) + * and * `` fruit bounty '' , or `` fruit gift '' . 
  * and * is derived from * andma * `` to give '' , which is finno-ugric . 
  estonian * malev * has the specific meaning of `` volunteer army '' or `` volunteer formation '' , usually used in the historical sense ( during the northern crusades estonians from many counties came together to form an army ) . 
  today , there are organisations that are called * malev * . 
  e.g the [ malev of tallinn ] ( http://tallinn.kaitseliit.ee ) . 
  and it 's of unknown origin . 
  it was mentioned in the livonian chronicle of henry . 
  the only known cognate is in baltic german , which borrowed it from estonian . 
  there is a distinction ? 
  * k\u00f5uts * seems a bit derogatory to me . 
  i would say * kass * for all cats . 
  it 's an east slavic loan . 
  ( either from russian dialects or from old east slavic ; compare russian * \u043a\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0430 * ), 
  if there was a need to make the distinction , i would say * isane kass * `` male cat '' . 
  yep , * koiras * and * koira * are from the same root . 
  in estonian , the word * koeras * exists and refers to `` father cannabis '' ( apparently a type of cannabis , contrasting with `` mother cannabis '' . 
  i 'm not an expert , so i do n't know much about it . ), 
  well , in literature , maybe . 
  but i would never use that word in normal speech to refer to a male cat . 
  rather as a derogatory word for cats regardless of gender .

  [ mekias ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ngdr05y.jpg ) - an imperial warrior who is an expert of two-handed long bladed swords , his favourite being chrysamere . 
  he is well versed in the restoration school , and in his spare time likes to learn about enchanting , conjuration and alchemy . 
  he also likes to hone his skills with short-bladed swords and spears . 
  his favourite spear is an enchanted glass halberd with extra fire-damage , and his favourite short-bladed sword is a daedric wakizashi . 
  he knows how to handle medium armour , but he rarely wears it . 
  he is hortator and nerevarine , but has yet to face dagoth ur . 
  he is master of the fighters guild , house brother to the great house hlaalu , and an agent in the imperial legion . 
  he hates house redoran , having looted their treasury a while back . 
  some other facts : * mekias * means [ `` sword '' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reconstruction:proto-germanic/m\u0113kijaz ) . 
  * binkis * was a [ lithuanian poet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kazys_binkis ) . 
  i have n't done that many imperial legion quests . 
  i 'm currently only at the penultimate quest for darius in gnisis . 
  ( rescue some orc ), 
  i saw no real point to use long blades after i got it to 100 , so i started using spears . 
  i 'm up to around ~ 55 , i think . 
  short blade is only at around 20 . 
  the way i used chrysamere resembled a spear anyway - holding the sword out , and charging at the enemy with boots of blinding speed . 
  ( the blinding effect negated , of course ), 
  difficulty is at +25 ( originally at -75 because it was my first time , gradually turned it up since . 
  i tried a new character at difficulty 0 and the beginning is much more fun , also because i understand the game now ), 
  cool . 
  but how come your mercantile is so low ? 
  i 'd argue the opposite . 
  it was definitely an elder scrolls game , but it was n't an rpg . 
  rather an action game with some rpg elements .
