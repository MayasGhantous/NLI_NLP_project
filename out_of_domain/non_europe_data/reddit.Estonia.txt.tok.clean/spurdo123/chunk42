  let 's take `` you 're a cunt '' . 
  starting with 2 words :, 
  * you [ informal ] - cop evil.person-cop *, 
  * you 're cunt are * - it literally means `` evil person '' but it 's used as a colloquial insult and is a bit vulgar . 
  -  4 words :, 
  * be-prs [ polite honourific ] you [ informal ] evil.person * - this is more emphatic than the copular suffix , translating to maybe `` you are being a cunt '' . 
  the polite honourific is often used in insults , it does n't really change the meaning . 
  * are oh you a cunt *, 
  -  8 words :, 
  * to.be.evil-prs [ disrespectful honourific ] you , and also evil.person-cop [ polite honourific ] you-cop *, 
  * are evil fucking you , and also an cunt 's oh you *, 
  -  16 words :, 
  * therefore , in.the.past to.be.evil-pst [ disrespectful honourific ] you , right.now to.be.evil-prs [ disrespectful honourific ] you , later.today to.be.evil-prs [ disrespectful honourific ] you , voc-evil . person !, 
  * so , in the past were evil fucking you , right now are evil fucking you , later today are evil fucking you , o cunt !, 
  * but.even cunt-cop [ disrespectful honourific ] you ; for.a.long.time be-pst cunt and bad.person - therefore dislike-prs i [ informal gender neutral ] you-acc due.to you-gen1 be-inf-apulative-poss-2sg cunt-essive , also so thank.you [ informal ] , because-cop bad.person-cop and cunt-cop you , yes , [ particle indicating displeasure with the result of the verb ] to.be.evil-prs [ slightly less disrespectful honourific ] you !,

  [ m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jxjhcbr.png ) - * \u010d\u00e4d\u0113\u00f5\u0161\u0161a * and * jalk\u0101\u00f5\u0161\u0161a * are rare ; normally * \u010d\u00e4\u0161i * and * jalka * are used instead . 
  * varp\u0101\u00f5\u0161\u0161at * is used a bit more often , but is often replaced with * varbaz * . 
  does n't seem too bad to me . 
  it 's perfectly realistic ( livonian does the exact same thing , but without \u010d ) . 
  although i do n't use '' \u01df '' and '' \u022b '' . 
  ( '' \u00e4\u00e4 '' and '' \u00f6\u00f6 '' instead ), 
  i could also write :, 
  * t\u0161\u00e4dee\u00f5\u0161\u0161a * - this would be the estonian writing system . 
  not too bad . 
  i personally just like macrons and '' \u010d '' . 
  * tshaedehoeshsha * - this would be the english system with digraphs ( i.e horrible ), 
  do you have / iu / , / ui / , / oi / etc ? 
  if not , why use the circumflex in those digraphs ? 
  it was originally * - teistk\u00fcmmend * , as seen in cases other than the nominative . 
  i.e meaning `` the other/second ten '', 
  * \u00fcheteistk\u00fcmne * - * eleven-gen * , or * one-gen-other-part-ten-gen *, 
  oh , ok . have there been any attempts at a spelling reform ? 
  well , it 's a finnic conlang spoken near the eastern coast of lake peipus . 
  the conworld it 's in is extremely similar to ours ( only that the russian advance into ingria and lake peipus was slower and smaller , so the local finnic languages survived ) . 
  \u00f5 is / \u0264 / ( a phoneme in southern finnic languages - estonian , v\u00f5ro , votic . 
  it used to be written as '' \u00f6 '' ( / \u00f8 / ) in older estonian texts ), 
  having digraphs would n't be naturalistic - no finnic language uses them . 
  \u0161 and t\u0161 are common , but no finnic language uses \u010d , although the neighbouring latvian and lithuanian do . 
  livonian uses macrons ( like latvian ) for long vowels . 
  an alternative would be to write it in cyrillic but again , this would n't be realistic . 
  all finnic languages are written in the latin script . 
  also , i could go the etymological route and get rid of \u010d / t\u0161 , because all instaces of / t\u0283 / come from historical / k / ( either before front vowels , or a geminated one ) . 
  this is what the romance languages do .

  what the hell , how/when did this happen ? 
  interesting . 
  times change fast , i think i last took a look at the leaderboards in ~ september or something . 
  i was already a part of house hlaalu so i rp 'd it so that it was n't that tough because i was already well known . 
  and it 's supposed to be easier because the hlaalu are crooks . 
  crassius is a bit odd , yngling is crooked , and velanda and nevena just bow down to orvas dren . 
  becoming hortator of the other 2 houses is definitely great . 
  idk , i liked it because [ it shows how the telvanni are a very odd bunch - one does n't like men so i had to literally kneel at her feet for her vote , one is completely insane , and one infinitely delays naming you hortator , so you have to just kill him ] ( / spoiler ) . 
  and i had n't dealt with them before that quest . 
  that last tidbit is interesting . 
  [ i was definitely over level 20 when doing those quests , but my reputation was probably low - i 'll have to check my saves ] ( / spoiler ), 
  turn the difficulty down . 
  -75 is great . 
  turn it up later when you 're a higher level and the game suddenly feels extremely easy . 
  also , watch some videos about mechanics before diving in to ease the pain . 
  i watched ( some of ) [ this playlist ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr225hwlwcs&amp;list=plb472f7a0e57751b7 ) by justred . 
  some mistakes in your build wo n't matter that much tbh . 
  i myself made some mistakes in my first build : having both medium and heavy armour as major skills ( i ended up only using heavy ) , having speechcraft as a major skill ( i rarely used it , and had to level it by training ) , and not having a second weapon skill as a minor/major skill ( i ended up maxing long blade pretty quickly ) , but this is n't too big of a mistake , the difference in leveling speed is n't that big . 
  but if you just ca n't get into it no matter what , do n't bother . 
  the game is n't for everyone and there 's no point torturing yourself . 
  i feel the same for oblivion - i just ca n't get into it , even though i love both morrowind and skyrim . 
  some people will recommend mods - i 'd say do n't bother . 
  sernerdas uses loanwords for all .

  for some words , both variants are used equally :, 
  * psychology : ** \u0101v\u014dt\u012btuz ** / ' \u0251 : vo : ti : tuz / * brain-gen . science * , or ** ps\u00fckol\u014dgia ** / psyko ` lo : g\u02b2\u0251 /,

  the word * t\u012btuz * is derived from the word * t\u012bt\u00e4d\u00e4 * / ` ti : t\u00e6\u00f0\u00e6 / `` to know '' . 
  it 's a calque from estonian ( where * teada * -  * teadus * ), 
  * all-gen-pl flying-gen . law-gen-pl following-adverb , no-3sg to.dare-cond-3sg bee at.all fly-inf *, 
  confusing and unnecessary . 
  all slavic languages that are written in the latin alphabet use `` j '' for / j / . 
  using `` y '' for both / j / ( \u0439 ) and / \u0268 / ( \u044b ) is retarded . 
  `` j '' gets left unused anyway , i do n't see any reason whatsoever to use `` y '' for / j / . 
  estonian ** tuvi ** , from middle low german * duve * . 
  cognate to english * dove * . 
  ultimately from proto-germanic * d\u016bb\u01ed . 
  in takanaa , the particle ** ata ** / ` ata / is used for making conditional sentences . 
  it translates quite well to english `` if '' . 
  there is no conditional mood . 
  the apodosis always comes first .
