  technically there is a future tense ( 2 actually - near future and and far future ) , but they are literary and most dialects do n't use them . 
  so i wo n't mention them here . 
  what is * . agn * ? 
  you could make up an ethnonym and name it after that . 
  an ethnonym could be very simple - `` the people '' , `` landfolk '' , `` shorefolk '' , `` forestfolk '' , etc. 
  and naming the language after that - `` people 's language '' , `` land language '' , `` shore language '' , `` forest language '' etc. 
  as a naturalistic example , the estonian endonym before the 19th century was * maarahvas * , lit . 
  and the language was called * maakeel * , lit . 
  `` landtongue '' . 
  the votes ( a neighbouring tribe ) still call their language that sometimes - * maat\u0161eeli * . 
  or you could name it after a placename , or a loanword ( i.e the root would n't actually exist in the language itself , and would be meaningless ) . 
  as a naturalistic example * eesti * in estonian ( the modern endonym ) means nothing and is a loanword from high german , but originally either meant `` east '' in proto-germanic , or `` field '' in proto-baltic . 
  ah , thanks . 
  narva is very urban , unless by `` countryside '' you mean everything besides tallinn and tartu . 
  most russians are concentrated in urban areas in ida-virumaa and tallinn . 
  there are some scattered throughout the rest of the country ; i know one russophone ukrainian who lives in a neighbouring village . 
  that 's a dated etymology though . 
  it 's probably from proto-baltic * \u017aeme , meaning `` land '' . 
  this map uses the english exonyms though . 
  it 's always nice to see people who loved the game as a child . 
  i sadly ( or luckily ) have no nostalgia with this game at all , but i know how it feels . 
  it 's a great game , and nostalgia fortifies that greatness . 
  my favourite game to this day ( mafia 1 ) is a game i have lots of nostalgia for . 
  i can now objectively see its flaws ( just like i do with morrowind ) , but i still love it to death . 
  i do n't see the appeal of graphics mods tbh . 
  anything lower than 60fps ai n't worth it . 
  and old graphics add to the nostalgia . 
  the estonian cognate , * ustav * means something like `` trustworthy person '' , but is usually an adjective : `` trustworthy , `` loyal '' . 
  in lithuanian : ** kaklas ** , meaning `` neck '' . 
  my baltic conlang sernerdas 's cognate for this word is * kalkas * / ` k\u00e4lk\u00e4s / , also meaning `` neck '' ( specifically the front of the neck ), 
  in latvian : ** debess ** , meaning `` sky '' ( a bit dated , it 's usually in the plural as * debesis * ) . 
  my baltic conlang sernerdas 's cognate for this word is * debes\u012bs * / ` devesi : s / , meaning `` cloud '' , `` flock '' , `` sky '' . 
  in estonian : ** \u00f5u ** / ' \u0264u / , meaning `` outside '' ( as a noun ) . 
  my finnic conlang m\u0101\u010d\u012bl 's cognate for this word is * \u00f5bi * / ' \u0264vi / , meaning `` open area '' , `` opening '' . 
  russia is ultimately from proto-germanic * r\u014d\u00fer\u0105 , meaning `` rudder '' . 
  from the same source come finnish `` ruotsi '' and estonian `` rootsi '' , which mean `` sweden '' . 
  yeah . 
  nostalgia is just a very powerful feeling that makes a great game even greater . 
  but nostalgia ca n't fix a bad game . 
  i 've actually heard a lot of good things about fable : the lost chapters . 
  but i have n't tried it yet .

  takanaa has 2 numbers : singular and plural . 
  the plural marker is either * - p * , or * - k * . 
  in a few ( generally mono - , or disyllabic ) words reduplication of the final syllable marks the plural number . 
  this is archaic in a lot of words . 
  example : ** axu ** / ` ak\u02b0u / `` dog '' ( singular ) -  ** axuxu ** / ` ak\u02b0uk\u02b0u / `` dogs '' ( plural ) , but also ** axaak ** / a ` k\u02b0ak / , which is the more regular version . 
  proto-takanaa had an inflectional paucal , indicated by * - m * . 
  standard takanaa uses the particle * m\u0259 * / 'm \u0259 / `` some '' + the plural for this purpose . 
  example :, 
  takanaa : ** \u015ban ** / ' \u0283an / `` thing '' ( singular ) -  ** m\u0259 \u015banap ** / 'm \u0259 ' \u0283anap / `` some things '' ( paucal ) -  ** \u015banap ** / ' \u0283anap / `` things '' ( plural ), 
  proto-takanaa : ** skann\u014d ** `` thing '' ( singular ) -  ** skannam ** , or ** skann\u0105m ** `` some things '' ( paucal ) -  ** skannapi ** `` things '' ( plural ), 
  a dialect where the paucal has survived is northern takanaa , or pitish , where the paradigm is so :, 
  ** \u0161ena ** / ' \u0283\u025bn\u0252 / `` thing '' ( singular ) -  ** \u0161en\u00e1 ** / ' \u0283\u025bn\u0251 : / `` some things '' ( paucal ) -  ** \u0161enaphe ** / ' \u0283\u025bn\u0252p\u02b0\u0259 / `` things '' ( plural ), 
  * all man-pl to.be.obligated-3pl-prs die.violently-inf *, 
  / sv\u00e6rj\u025b / is surprising . 
  til where `` sw\u00c4rje '' comes from . 
  how is that word derived ? 
  i mean like , morpheme-by-morpheme . 
  odd , but interesting . 
  ** sur\u00f5da ** is `` to die violently '' , ** k\u014dta ** is `` to die '' . 
  the distinction is an innovation in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl . 
  in proto-finnic , `` surdak '' and `` kooldak '' were synonyms . 
  something similar happens in finnish though , where * surma * = violent death , and * kuolema * = death . 
  i 'm not familiar with the series , but the quote sounded like it was said by a violent person . 
  if i used * k\u014dta * , it would have meant something like `` all men die one day '' , although that may be the actual meaning of the quote , i 'm not sure . 
  where/how does prenasalisation occur ? 
  ah , then i would use * k\u014dta * . 
  interesting quote , nonetheless . 
  fascinating . 
  does fortis-lenis have any grammatical function ? 
  they 're before front vowels , so no romance language besides sardinian would pronounce those words with a / k / ( theoretically ) . 
   actual name, 
  yeah !, 
  let 's use * maavald * instead for estonia . 
  it 's beautiful and not german . 
  a nameless conlang i 've been working on has a somewhat deep orthography , but nothing really crazy :, 
  * ** naugag ** / ` no : j\u0251 / - `` good '', 
  * ** seag ** / ' \u0283\u025b : / - `` war '' , `` conflict '' [ this can be written as * sea * aswell ], 
  it 's actually quite regular , but there are still many irregularities :, 
  * ** vaiss ** / ` f\u00e6 : s : / - `` wolf '' [ should be / v\u00e6 : s : / at first glance ], 
  * ** vaigur ** / ` v\u00e6jui / - `` fox '' [ should be / ` v\u00e6 : jui / at first glance ], 
  * ** vor ** / ` foi / - `` in '' , `` per '' , `` for '' [ should be / ` voi / at first glance ], 
  * ** vog ** / ` vo : / - `` before '' [ should be / ` v\u00f8 / at first glance ], 
  there are a few in takanaa :, 
  ** k\u0259l\u0259lud\u0259m ** / ` k\u0259l\u0259lut\u02b2\u0259m / - to lose the spark in a relationship [ * k\u0259 - * `` to stop doing x '' + * l\u0259 - * `` to do x more and more over time '' + * lud\u0259m * `` to love '' ],
