  ** apalud\u0259m ** / ` apalut\u02b2\u0259m / - to start loving someone else [ * apa - * `` over '' , `` across '' + * lud\u0259m * `` to love '' ], 
  ** salud\u0259m ** / ` salut\u02b2\u0259m / - to have a one-night stand [ * sa - * `` to do x once '' + * lud\u0259m * `` to love '' ], 
  ** unakara ** / ` unaka\u0281a / - enemy of an enemy ; someone who is allied to you only because you share a common enemy [ * unak * `` enemy '' + * - ara * - agent suffix ], 
  ** a\u015busalan\u0259sa ** / ` a\u0283usalan\u0259sa / - the feeling when you bump into someone but ca n't get past because you keep blocking eachother by going in the same direction ( i remember seeing this here on reddit ) [ * a\u015bu - * - derives antonyms , + * salan\u0259sa * `` encounter '' , `` meeting '' , which is derived from * salan\u0259m * `` to meet '' , `` to have an encounter '' ], 
  ** a\u015bur\u0259t\u0259n\u0259\u015b ** / ` a\u0283u\u0281\u0259t\u0259n\u0259\u0283 / - to give a fuck , to be bothered [ * a\u015bu - * - derives antonyms , + * r\u0259t\u0259m * `` to be able to '' + * - n - * ( used for linking affixes that would otherwise form a diphthong ) + * - \u0259\u015b * - forms verbs with the meaning of `` to be x '' ], 
  yeah , but writing it with a `` k '' and pronouncing it as / k / feels like an artifical and unnecessary change . 
  estonian * p\u00fcha * also means `` holiday '' . 
  ** it 's not anyone 's fault . 
  in takanaa :, 
  / ' \u0259\u0281akan\u0259\u0283 'm \u0259ta\u0281ani\u0283 /, 
  * to.be.guilty-prs somebody-neg [ = nobody ] *, 
  * want-prs [ emphatic particle ] tom-abl-cop help-inf-cop *, 
  * wants really from tom is to help is *,

  ** n\u0259katta ** / ` n\u0259ka\u0288a / : lynx, 
  estonian * madu * is possibly loaned from proto-germanic * ma\u00fe\u00f4 . 
  compare gothic ( ma\u00fea ) , and dialectal english `` made '' , meaning `` worm '' , `` maggot '' . 
  it could also be a loan from proto-indo-iranian * ma\u0107a - ( or `` matsa - '' ) . 
  in this case it is a cognate to proto-sami * muoc\u0113 `` moth '', 
  i would take the proper noun , and change it to fit the phonology and grammar . 
  so , in sernerdas it would be ** portlandas ** / purt ` landas / or / ` puortlandas / . 
  - because a noun in the nominative has to end with either ** - a ** , ** - \u0113 ** , ** - s ** , or ** - r ** . 
  otherwise it would n't be possible to inflect it . 
  proper nouns and loans get ** - as ** usually . 
  in takanaa it would be ** purutulanat ** / ` pu\u0281utulanat / - no consonant clusters . 
  in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl it would be ** portlanti ** / ` portl\u0251nti / - because besides some exceptions , nouns in nominative have to end with a vowel . 
  skyrim 's hardly a rpg . 
  it 's an action game with rpg elements . 
  this does n't mean it 's a bad game necessarily . 
  morrowind is a truer rpg , and oblivion is a mix of the two . 
  newer bethesda games are a mix of open-world action with rpg elements . 
  morrowind and skyrim are radically different games and i enjoy them for radically different reasons . 
  skyrim has a nice story , a great combat system , and realism . 
  the negatives are good graphics ( which means it runs like shite , but this is an issue on my part ) , jack-of-all-trades-ism ( you can do anything ) , and few choices to make ( pretty much only the civil war questline , which i liked a lot ), 
  i like morrowind because of it 's graphics ( it runs really well ) , a great story , great role-playing elements ( classes , the leveling system ) , choices ( the 3 houses , the different guilds ) , you ca n't do everything in one playthrough ( to be a part of the mage 's guild and advance you have to actually be a good mage ) . 
  the negatives are bad realism ( which hinders role-play ) and clunky animations ( not really important ) . 
  both games have detailed and interesting worlds , although i like morrowind 's more because it is alien . 
  and both games are set in the same tes universe . 
  skyrim 's radiant quests are good for roleplay , but are shallow . 
  i like to roleplay a lot in gta , and a radiant quest system would imo be perfect for that sort of game . 
  yeah , sure , but this is on my part . 
  newer games run worse , and this takes out some enjoyment . 
  ( although i still loved the hell out of gta4 at ~ 15fps , simply because it 's a great game ), 
  absolutely . 
  i ca n't remember , but there are a few early ones in sernerdas , from december 2015 :, 
  ** - ( i added the numbers a bit later though ), 
  i 'll try to do a gloss , but at this stage i did n't understand many linguistic concepts , so the grammar was a bit inconsistent :, 
  * karl ninth-ordinal ( fourth-ordinal october thousand fivehundred fifteen - thirteen october thousand sixhundred eleven ) be-pst sweden-gen stadtholder thousand fivehundred ninety nine - thousand sixhundred four and king 1604-1611 , gustav i vasa youngest-superlative sun *, 
  there are a lot of differences . 
  the numbers are very different now , and much more realistic ( not just esperanto-ish interpretations of latin with the lithuanian 1st declension * - as * nominative ending slapped onto it ) . 
  at that point i did n't pay any attention to realism and just took whatever from whereever . 
  now i atleast have a vision , but it 's still weird and unpolished at parts ( e.g i never touched on pitch accent ) . 
  it 's supposed to be a baltic conlang with a very strong influence from latin . 
  there is another sentence , which i actually got from a reddit challenge ( this might have been either january 2016 or december 2015 ) :, 
  * about moon-loc , i hear-pst-sg pain-acc and ideal-acc : *, 
  * of the moon , i heard the pain and the ideal : *, 
  the main differences are :, 
  * the ** - t ** locative . 
  i ca n't remember where i got it , but it does n't appear in any italic or baltic language . 
  now it 's marked by vowels . 
  * the catch-all ** - l ** past for verbs , only changing for number . 
  i got this from russian . 
  at this point i did n't pay any attention to realism . 
  now it 's marked by vowels , but the * - l - * has stayed in the feminine past . 
  * the ** - m ** accusative . 
  i actually changed this very late . 
  it actually could be ** - m ** , but in proto-balto-slavic , and in old prussian , it had changed into ** - n ** , so i changed it to this . 
  * * et * meaning `` and '' . 
  this still exists as a synonym , but i usually use the baltic * ir * / * yr * / ` ir / , / ' \u0268r / , and german * yn * / \u0268n / instead . 
  * * ego * meaning `` i '' . 
  this is from latin . 
  quite unrealistic . 
  now it 's * esiun * / e 's \u02b2un / ( stressed ) , and * es * / ` es / ( unstressed ), 
  * acute accents for vowel length . 
  technically both are allowed , but i 've used macrons exclusively since the summer of 2016 , now . 
  yeah  the early months were just learning , and it was a great experience . 
  i 've since started new projects and they 've been much more stable . 
  i have no regrets at all , except for making my vocabulary a bit too large too quick . 
  making any big changes would be a nightmare now ( i 've got around 2500 words ) . 
  i 'll start :, 
  war - ** karias ** , ** bellos ** / ` kar\u02b2as / , / ` pel : us / [ there is a slight difference - * karias * refers to a specific war , * bellos * refers to war in general ], 
  battle - ** puknia ** / ` puk\u02b2n\u02b2a /, 
  frontier - ** kraja ** / ` kraja /, 
  general - ** generalas ** / ` generalas / ( in older literature * genrales * , * genralas * , etc could also be seen ), 
  colonel - ** \u014dberstas ** / ` o : verstas /, 
  captain - ** kapitanas ** / ` kapitanas /, 
  hero - ** \u0113r\u014ds ** / ` e : ro : s /, 
  soldier - ** kareives ** / ka ` r\u0250ives / , ** karat\u014dr ** / ` karato : r / , ** m\u012bles ** / ` mi : les / , ** suld\u0101tas ** / sul ` da : tas / ( only used for the german and russian armies , and in a historical context , usually ), 
  army - ** arias ** / ` ar\u02b2as / , ** arm\u0113 ** / ` arme : /, 
  regiment - ** ariatulas ** / ` ar\u02b2atulas / , ** regimentos ** / ` regimentus /, 
  weapon - ** ginklas ** / ` gin\u02b2klas /, 
  to conquer - ** vinkti ** / ` vin\u02b2kti /, 
  military - ** mil\u012bcios ** / mi ` li : t\u02b2s\u02b2us /, 
  guerilla warfare - ** b\u0113gneikinis karias ** , or ** b\u0113gneikinus mil\u012bcios ** / pe : g ` neikinis ` kar\u02b2as / , / pe : g ` neikinus mi ` li : t\u02b2s\u02b2us / . 
  `` banditlike war '' ( from * b\u0113kti * `` to run '' -  * b\u0113gneikas * `` runner '' , `` escapee '' , `` bandit '' , and the adjective of that is * b\u0113gneikinis * ), 
  sernerdas ( a baltic language spoken from pskov to bukovina , and from minsk to pomerelia ) has lots of synonyms . 
  the usual main set is just `` first day '' , `` second day '' , etc , until friday .
