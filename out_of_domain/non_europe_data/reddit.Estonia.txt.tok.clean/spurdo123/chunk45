  `` firstday '' ), 
  * ** antrudeina ** / antru ` deina / - tuesday ( lit . 
  `` secondday '' , or `` otherday '' ), 
  * ** terdeina ** / ter ` deina / - wednesday ( lit . 
  `` thirdday '' ), 
  * ** keterdeina ** / keter ` deina / - thursday ( lit . 
  `` fourthday '' ), 
  there are synonyms for these four days derived from germanic languages . 
  these 4 are cognates to their english equivalents , through proto-germanic . 
  these are only used in western dialects , but can often be seen in literature :, 
  * ** m\u0101nadeina ** / ma : nadeina / - monday, 
  * ** tiasdeina ** / t\u02b2as ` deina / - tuesday, 
  * ** vodandeina ** / ` vuodandeina / - wednesday, 
  * ** tursdeina ** / turs ` deina / - thursday, 
  the days from friday to sunday are more complicated . 
  the most common version is :, 
  * ** i\u014dva ** / jo : va / - friday [ from latin * dies iovis * , which meant `` thursday '' ], 
  * ** saturn\u0101la ** / saturna : la / - saturday [ from latin * dies saturnis * , but also mixed with the event of * saturnalia * , which celebrated the winter solstice ], 
  * ** keiskdeina ** / keisk ` deina / - sunday [ from * keiskti * `` to rest '' + * deina * `` day '' , so `` resting day '' ], 
  the germanic synonyms exist for these 3 days too , and are a bit more widely used :, 
  * ** frideina ** / fri ` deina / - friday, 
  * ** laudeina ** / lau ` deina / - saturday [ from proto-germanic `` laug\u014dz dagaz '' - `` washing day '' , probably through proto-norse or a finnic language ], 
  * ** saul\u0113sdeina ** / ` saule : sdeina / - sunday [ a calque from proto-germanic . 
  from * saul\u0113 * `` sun '' + * deina * `` day '' ], 
  * ** sunnondeina ** / sunnun ` deina / - sunday [ a direct loan . 
  much rarer than the above . 
  only a handful of villages use this word regularly ], 
  in the standard language , all are considered correct , but the 4 numbered ones , * i\u014dva * , * saturn\u0101la * , and * keiskdeina * are used most often . 
   ofursti `` colonel '' / \u0254fur\u0283t\u02b2i /, 
  that looks germanic . 
  where is it borrowed from ? 
   heirforin, 
  what are the etymologies of these ? 
  just binge-watched every episode . 
  cool series . 
  very cool . 
  a borrowed adposition is interesting , and especially such a common one such as `` under '' . 
  are there are any more of them ? 
  or is * undir * only present in that word ? 
  in sernerdas :, 
  / \u0268 / , since it generally only comes from historical * / i : / , with a lot of exceptions . 
  also in loanwords , where it approximates original / y / , / \u0259 / , or / \u0264 / . 
  in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl :, 
  probably / \u0292 / , since it generally only exists in consonant gradation [ / \u0283 / < -  / \u0292 / ] , and in loanwords . 
  but also from original / ch / , e.g proto-finnic / ` v\u0251nh\u0251 / ( `` old '' ) becomes m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ** van\u017ea ** / ` v\u0251n\u0292\u0251 / `` old '' . 
  the affricate / ts / is also rare , although it can be analysed as a cluster of / t / and / s / . 
  in takanaa :, 
  labialised stops , which exist only in loanwords from an unknown language . 
  e.g ** kua ** / ` k\u02b7a / , meaning `` strategy '' . 
  from native sounds , probably / \u0256 / and / \u0288 / ( or / \u0288 / and / \u0288 : / , depending on idiolect/analysation ) . 
  the real reason for this is that i forgot about them for a while . 
  some very important words do use them though , like ** ddat ** / ' \u0256at / , a particle indicating impatience with the verb , and being angry with the listener, 
   s\u00df, 
  what does this represent ? 
  well , it 's a unique concept , hard to forget :d, 
  thanks !, 
  it 's baltic with heavy latin influence . 
  how many nouns end with ** - ok ** ? 
  the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate rule is really interesting . 
  no exceptions ? 
  a bit unrealistic , but ok . 
  if the purpose is not to be naturalistic then it 's fine , 
  use 2 spaces for better formatting !, 
  what are the details of this conlang ? 
  is it semitic/arabic ? 
  what script is that ? 
  it 's appearing as blocks on my phone right now . 
  yes . 
  proto-finnic and the finnic languages come very close . 
  nouns in the nominative end with a vowel , or with ** - h ** . 
  infinitives end with ** - k ** , but this was lost and became a vowel in almost all daughter languages . 
  some participles also end with other consonants . 
  the genitive case also ends with ** - n ** ( which became a vowel in many daughter languages ), 
  there are a lot of exceptions , though . 
  so i would suggest adding those . 
  the immediate aftermath of world war 2 was a time when resistance against the soviets was highest in the baltic states . 
  it all died down in the 50s though , after deportations , and lack of western help . 
  the movement of the forest brothers was most organised in lithuania . 
  nobody really viewed the soviets as `` liberators '' . 
  the nazi regime was more fair to the average person . 
  ( there were n't that many jews or roma here , but of course things were bad for them ) . 
  it was the replacement of one occupation by another . 
  both commited crimes . 
  but soviet crimes were more tangible and had bigger repercussions . 
  what is the ipa of * phaaetan * ? 
  in the interwar context it 's better to categorise finland as ( geopolitically ) eastern european , since it gained independence from the russian empire , and fought against communism the same way like estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland did . 
  the finland = nordic thing came much later . 
  but if you mean culturally then yeah , but this does n't matter much here . 
  in estonia , 1 in 10 people being christians seems a bit too high , but it 's probably just my personal bias . 
  i only know 1 religious person . 
  she is a jehovah 's witness . 
  ** rakani ** / ' \u0281akani / - `` commander '' , `` warleader '', 
  rare features in takanaa :, 
  some cases :, 
  * sublative - `` to below '' , `` for '' , `` for the purpose of '' , `` to around '', 
  * subessive - `` under '' , `` around '', 
  * desublative ( or `` subelative '' ) - `` form under '' , `` about '' , `` from around '', 
  * apulative - `` to next to '' , `` over '' , `` to the front '' , also functions as a dative case , marking the indirect object, 
  * apudessive - `` next to '' , `` above '' , `` in front of '' , `` facing '' - also used for possession , as in i-apudessive be something , meaning `` i have something '', 
  * deapulative - `` from next to '' , `` from near '' , `` from above '' , `` from the front '' - also used as an ablative ( i took it from him ) .
