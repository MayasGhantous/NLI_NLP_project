  the ablative case only marks the agent in a passive clause . 
  * different genitive cases : genitive 1 is used for 1 thing being possessed , genitive 2 for multible , and genitive 3 is used for origin , and an ambigious number of possessions . 
  an example :, 
  ** madd\u0259pipip itt\u0259pi\u00feip ** / ` ma\u0256\u0259pipip ` i\u0288\u0259pit\u02b0ip / * mother-gen2-poss-1sg-pl son-pl-poss-3sg-pl * `` my mother 's sons '' . 
  for verbs , there are some interesting distinctions :, 
  * past vs past historic - the past historic is in essence used for actions that are n't relevant now . 
  the past is used for events that are . 
  * near future vs far future - the near future is used for events that will take place today , this night , or tomorrow . 
  the far future is used for events that will happen over 2 days from now . 
  also , verbs are only marked for tense , aspect , voice , number , and for the object . 
  for example :, 
  ** inutt\u0259nita \u00fei ** / ` inu\u0288\u0259nita ` t\u02b0i / * see-prs-2sg i * `` i see you '' . 
  i 'm not sure how this is glossed though . 
  i know many polysynthetic languages mark both the object and the subject in the verb , but takanaa only marks the object . 
  not sure how rare that is . 
  what do your cases look like ? 
  also , uralic languages do have adpositions ( mostly postpositions ) . 
  not every relationship can be expressed by a noun case . 
  cool cases !, 
  although i think the names are odd . 
  i would call your `` sublative '' an `` elative '' , and your `` elative '' an `` exessive '' . 
  and i think the `` perlative '' is usually called the `` prolative '' . 
  the `` elative '' indicates `` movement out of sth '' . 
  something being `` outside of sth '' is different . 
  i would call that an `` exessive '' , but idk . 
  the way the exessive case is used in finnic languages is actually the opposite of the translative , i.e transitioning out of a state . 
  a friendly suggestion : use 2 spaces between words , so it 's easier to read !, 
  latin has plenty of adpositions . 
  many of these have been loaned into english aswell ( like * per * and * pro * ), 
  the borders look a bit off . 
  especially the ah-serbia border . 
  * [ classifier for birds and other objects in the air ] all [ weak mutation ] bird-part-pl [ deemphatic particle ] nest-abs-pl start-persistive-3pl , [ emphatic particle ] i-abessive and you-abessive ; we-erg what-abs wait-persistive-1pl ? 
  * those all the birds them nests are starting , oh but without me and without you , us what are waiting ? 
  yes . 
  an ergative-absolutive language i 've been working on has 11 cases . 
  there are 7 regular paradigms . 
  here is how an '' - h stem '' noun inflects . 
  * poarh * means `` man '' . 
  | | singular | plural |, 
  | absolutive | poarh / ` p\u0252 : r / | poarac / ` p\u0252r\u00e6g / |, 
  | dative | poare / ` p\u0252 : ri / | poaruz / ` p\u0252rus / |, 
  | lative | poarib / ` p\u0252 : r\u02b2u / | poaribuc / ` p\u0252 : r\u02b2ug / |, 
  | comitative | poarat / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6d / | poaratag / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6t\u0251 / |, 
  | partitive | poarat / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6d / | poarac / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6g / |, 
  the partitive case is used for count nouns and a few prepositions , and is almost always seen together with a classifier . 
  an example : `` five women '', 
  ** nago bpoantanst sat ** / ` n\u00e6j\u0251 ' \u0252 : nt\u00e6n\u02b2s\u02b2t 's \u00e6d / * [ feminine classifier ] [ weak mutation ] woman-part-sg five *, 
  the partitive plural is used only for prepositions ( e.g * eva * / ` iv\u00e6 / , meaning `` all '' ), 
  90 % is exaggerating . 
  the rate of autism is probably higher than normal , but definitely not that high . 
  that * \u0438\u0438 * only appears in words ending with * \u0438\u044f * . 
  russian * \u0433 * often corresponds to western european `` h '' . 
  so it means `` harmony '' . 
  i can think of one other word where h < -  \u0433 - * \u0433\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 * `` homosexual '' . 
  there are probably more though . 
  the quote by the friend translates to this , i think : `` either i will stop being a person , or i will throw ( give up ? ), 
  learning russian '' . 
  and i 'm pretty sure * \u0443\u0448\u0451\u043b * means `` left '' , not `` went '' . 
  not sure though , i do n't know prefixed verbs too well . 
  the final sentence is something like : `` he said , that to start living in harmony with the world , only when ( he would ? ), 
  quit from university '', 
  that 's not a pitch accent . 
  it 's just a third phonemic length . 
  now that you mention it , i can hear some sort of falling tone but it feels forced and only appears when stressing it . 
  not sure though , never heard of this . 
  in normal speech there is definitely not a tone . 
  but when i 'm emphasising the difference , it kinda exists . 
  so , let 's take * saada * / \u02c8s\u0251\u02d0\u02d0d\u0325\u0251 / `` get-inf '' and * saada * / \u02c8s\u0251\u02d0d\u0325\u0251 / `` send-imp '' . 
  i could just as easily apply that tone in * get-inf * to * send-imp * , there is no difference . 
  if it exists , it 's not phonemic . 
  interesting . 
  it may be my idiolect though . 
  my point is though , that the tone is not unique to overlong syllables . 
  i can apply it to any syllable , there is no difference . 
  although when i have to contrast the two and pronounce them slowly and clearly , i will use the tone on the overlong syllable . 
  it 's weird . 
  probably . 
  other estonian words from that root :, 
  * ** happeline ** `` acidic '', 
  * ** happelisus ** `` acidity '', 
  * ** hapukas ** `` sourish '' , `` sour '', 
  * ** hapusus ** `` sourness '', 
  * ** hapend ** `` oxide '' ( dated - now * oksiid * ), 
  * ** hapenduma ** `` to oxidise '' ( dated - now * oks\u00fcdeeruma * ), 
   most people can speak english decently . 
  among the youth of tallinn and tartu , probably so . 
  everywhere else , no . 
  the rural youth is quite bad at it , and older people have next to no english . 
  people born before the 60s also learned german , but they 've most likely forgotten it or did n't care much about it . 
  russian skills are also bad among estonians . 
  the youth has next to no russian , and most older people have forgotten it . 
  this is most likely different in places like tallinn and ida-virumaa though . 
  ** jat sansi caraulju poluju toa pilag , rag tueluzadats can oasnu ceanag pi agusn , sese conn agusaluc pat djanstulucac pagag . 
  * in [ mixed mutation ] i-essive great-erg fire-erg i-abs burn-pres-3sg , but warmth-benefactive negative.verb-inf somebody-erg they-abs [ particle that forms various verbs , in this case meaning `` to stop going '' ] go-inf , and-emphatic past goer-erg-pl only [ mixed mutation ] puff.of.smoke-abs-pl see-pres-3pl *, 
  * in i great fire me burns , but for warmth not somebody them stop going , and also past goers only puffs of smoke see *, 
  the words ** lag ** / ` l\u0251 / and ** oalag ** / ' \u0252la / , which are basically topic markers i think , the first being emphatic , and the second deemphatic . 
  an example :, 
  * big cloud [ emphatic topic marker ] , and man [ deemphatic topic marker ] , and-emphatic def-art [ mixed mutation ] river *, 
  in essence translating to `` a big cloud !!, 
  ! , some man or whatever , and the river . '',
