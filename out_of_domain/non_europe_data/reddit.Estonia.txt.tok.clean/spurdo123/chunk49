  balto-slavic languages ( excluding bulgarian , and a few other slavic languages that have lost the vocative ) have 7 , they are missing the ablative , which fused with the genitive ) . 
  uralic languages also tend to have a lot of cases . 
  livonian has only 8 , while veps has 23 . 
  at some point the distinction between noun case and suffix becomes hazy . 
  noun cases tend to apply to all nouns , while suffixes tend to only apply to a select few . 
  for example the prolative case in estonian : ( * meritsi * `` by the sea '' , * k\u00e4sitsi * `` by hand '' , but not something like * pastakatsi * `` by pen '' ( which does n't exist ) ), 
  that was the implication , yes . 
  uralic languages do this . 
  this is called the `` inessive case '' . 
  example from estonian :, 
  * ** kast ** `` box '' -  ** kastis ** `` in the box '' ; or alternatively with a preposition along with the genitive : ** kasti sees ** `` inside the box '', 
  i feel like this discussion deserved it 's own thread , although that 's just my opinion . 
  these folks rarely repost to the small discussions thread aswell : /, 
  no , no , not at all . 
  ** - kupk\u0101 ivani **, 
  / ` kupk\u0251 : ` iv\u0251ni /, 
  * feel-2sg-prs [ interrogative particle ] you now this-part , mister crab ? 
  * yet months and [ non-emphatic ] years go.by-pst-3pl zarathustra-gen soul-gen over , and [ emphatic ] he/she even no-3sg listen-3sg this-acc [ telic ] ; he/she-gen hair-pl become-3pl white-translative *, 
   partitive case, 
  this has various meanings . 
  in finnic languages this marks the atelic accusative , i.e the action is not finished . 
  this contrasts with the `` accusative case '' , which marks the telic accusative ; the action has been completed ( in actuality the genitive case is used in singular , the nominative in plural , and the nominative in imperative clauses . 
  in finnish the accusative is distinct in pronouns ) . 
  also , in some other phrases it translates to `` some '' . 
  e.g in estonian : ** meil on juustu ** `` we have some cheese '' - * we-adessive be-3sg-prs cheese-part * . 
  if you said ** meil on juust ** , * we-ade is cheese-nom * , it would mean `` we have cheese '' . 
   perfective, 
  this means that the action has been completed . 
  in estonian this is marked by an adverb ( usually something like * \u00e4ra * `` away '' ) along with the telic accusative . 
  the perfective aspect as an aspect itself is usually marked in the verb , like in russian : ** \u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c ** `` to give '' is perfective , ** \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c ** is imperfective, 
   perfect, 
  this exists in english . 
  `` i have done something '' vs `` i did something '' . 
  note that american english tends to not use this too often . 
  both the perfect and the perfective can exist in a language . 
  an example from estonian :, 
  ** * i eat-1sg-pst cake-gen away * - `` i ate the cake ! '', 
  ( whole , did n't leave anything behind ) - imperfect perfective, 
  ** * i be-1sg-prs cake-gen away eat-pst-active-ptcp * - `` i have eaten the cake ! '', 
  ( as a declaration , just now ) [ the be + past active participle is how you form perfect tenses in estonian ] - perfect perfective, 
  but , in essence there is no difference between those two sentences . 
  the second one is rarer in colloquial language . 
  also , note : the partitive is marked in the noun , and the perfect and the perfective are marked in ( or around ) the verb . 
  * so geat-pl , he-gen family-gen companion-pl , grieve-3pl-pst lord-part , who-rel-part be-pass-connegative assault-pass-pst-ptcp . 
  they say-3pl-pst , that-rel all-ela king-ela-pl this-ade land-all , he be-3sg-pst superlative generous-comparative and [ emphatic ] righteous-com-pl mind-com-pl , superlative kind-comparative self-all people-all and [ non-emphatic ] superlative keen-comparative , that-rel fame-part acquire-inf *, 
  superlative adjectives are formed with the particle ** k\u0101\u010d\u010d\u00f5 ** , which is obviously derived from ** k\u0101\u010d\u010d\u00f5\u00f5 ** - * all-gen * , plus the comparative of the adjective . 
  stargate is an interesting case . 
  there was no universal translator , most languages that were encountered were descended from earth 's languages , and from not too long ago , so there was always a linguist in a team to communicate and translate . 
  for example in the episode `` 2001 '' , daniel found a newspaper written in a p-celtic language ( `` similar to welsh '' ) , and he could understand it quite well , except for one word which ultimately meant something like `` infertility '' . 
  makes sense , derivations like that vary a lot . 
  the part where the linguists figure out the local language and communicate is never shown on screen though , except for the original movie . 
  the people on abydos were descended from ancient egyptians , but somehow daniel could understand them quite well ? 
  this was 5000 years after they had left earth . 
  i doubt he would 've understood much at all . 
  even though we have coptic nowadays , the language of abydos would 've evolved differently .

  what country is carrantania ? 
  is `` pr hungary '' - `` people 's republic of hungary '' ? 
  is that a communist country ? 
  that 's the equivalent of `` bob '' ; a very common name . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl generally borrows it 's christian names from russian . 
  the more estonian and lutheran * j\u0101ni * or * jani * can be seen , but it 's rare . 
  unlike the votes , the landfolk are n't very religious , so there is n't as big a stigma against lutheranism . 
  ties to the estonians are very big aswell . 
  in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , they are formed from the country name in genitive + the word `` language '' - ** \u010d\u012bl ** / ` t\u0283i : l\u02b2 /, 
  for example : finnish language : ** s\u014dm\u00f5\u00f5 \u010d\u012bl ** / ` so : m\u0264 : ` t\u0283i : l\u02b2 / . 
  * finland-gen language *, 
  estonian : ** vir\u014d \u010d\u012bl ** / ` viro : ` t\u0283i : l\u02b2 / * estonia-gen language * . 
  * viro * is also what finland calls estonia . 
  since * eesti * , * estonia * and the sorts are the germanic and/or possibly baltic exonym , not the native finnic one . 
  this is derived from the name of a county in north-eastern estonia - * virumaa * . 
  ** m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ** / 'm \u0251 : t\u0283i : l\u02b2 / itself is derived from ** m\u0101 ** `` land '' , `` earth '' . 
  it is a cognate to estonian * maakeel * / 'm \u0251 : ke : l / , which used to be the native term for the estonian language . 
  to say `` in finnish '' , for example , you would say ** s\u014dm\u00f5\u00f5 \u010d\u012bl\u00f5\u0161a ** / ` so : m\u0264 : ` t\u0283i : l\u0264\u0283\u0251 / * finland-gen language-ine *, 
  other finnic languages :, 
  * ludic : ** vari\u0161 **, 
  probably a few months to flesh out the grammar . 
  vocabulary will take longer . 
  a conlang is never complete though . 
  for example , i added reflexive verbs to takanaa about 6-7 months after i started it . 
  that 's a pretty major grammatical feature . 
  although if you put your mind in to it you can flesh out a grammar in a week ( i would not suggest doing this ), 
  ** savit ** / 's \u00e6vid / - weak, 
  derived terms :, 
  * ** sav ** / 's \u00e6f / - weakness , loss, 
  estonian does it . 
  `` spongebob '' is ** k\u00e4snakalle ** - `` sponge kalle '' . 
  although `` kalle '' ai n't too common , it 's just a funny name . 
  so does finnish : ** paavo pesusieni ** - `` paavo sponge '' ( i think ), 
  mostly in children 's shows i guess . 
  ** jearmon ** / ` j\u025b : rmo : / - to stop , to end ( intransitive ), 
  derived terms :, 
  * ** jearmtt ** / ` j\u025b : rd / - to stop , to end ( transitive ),
