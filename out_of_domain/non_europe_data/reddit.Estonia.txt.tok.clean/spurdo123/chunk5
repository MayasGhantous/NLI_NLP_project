  the vocabulary is latin and lithuanian in origin , and the grammar is broadly indo-european . 
  interesting . 
  iirc , the historical province is called `` moldavia '' . 
  `` munn '' is actually from `` muna '' , which means `` egg '' . 
  and it is of uralic origin . 
  other words :, 
  * t\u00fcra - of finnic origin . 
  this does n't mean anything else besides `` penis '' , but it means `` hernia '' or `` curse '' in other languages where it is a cognate . 
  * noku - this is likely derived from `` nokk '' , which means `` beak '' . 
  this is either finnic or a loan from pg * \u03c7nukka - . 
  * till - either from the name of a bird , or from `` tila '' , which means something like `` small pipe '' . 
  e.g livonian `` til\u0101 '' means both `` small pipe '' and `` boys penis '' . 
  * k\u00fcrb - all i know is that it 's of finnic origin . 
  this is a cognate to finnish `` kyrp\u00e4 '', 
  * peenis - i presume this is ultimately from latin `` p\u0113nis '' . 
  the root `` peen - '' also means `` thin '' . 
  this is a medical term . 
  * suguti - from `` sugu '' - `` gender '' , `` sex '' + the - ti suffix ( forms instruments ) . 
  `` sugu '' is a possible ie loan . 
  compare old indian s\u016b\u0301te . 
  ( gives birth ) . 
  this is also a medical term . 
  how did you do 99 hunter ? 
  black chins ? 
  the dual number , i guess . 
  although only 1 of my conlangs uses it productively and heavily inflects both nouns and verbs to it . 
  in others it is only in the base form ( nominative/absolutive ) of nouns . 
  not a true romlang , i guess . 
  the vocabulary has a lot of roots of origins other than romance . 
  mostly lithuanian . 
  the grammar is n't directly descended from anything , but has influence from languages such as e.g russian and lithuanian . 
  i deliberately used words of latin origin where synonyms existed , e.g `` kailos '' instead of `` roios '' ( heaven , paradise ), 
  note : the second line originally read `` sanktifik\u00e9tis f\u00e9rant n\u00e1mas tun '' . 
  i translated the first 2 lines quite early on , so this is n't correct any more . 
  `` sanktifik\u00e9tis '' is an adjective and `` f\u00e9rant '' is `` i am '' in future subjunctive ( it should 've been `` fuerunt '' ) . 
  since latin uses a verb , i decided that this would be better . 
  alternatively you could use the present active participle + `` to be '' in future subjunctive 3rd person , which would be `` sanktifik\u00e9tyns fuerunt n\u00e1mas tun '', 
  ** english ** | ** sernerdas ** | ** ipa **, 
  our father , who art in heaven | pater nostrum , k\u00ed iest in kailat | / ` pater ` nuostrum ki : jest in ` kailat /, 
  hallowed be thy name | sanktifik\u00e9tent n\u00e1mas tun | / sa\u014bktifike : tent na : mas tun /, 
  thy will be done on earth | tun noretas fagerant ni kusmat | / tun nu ` retas fa ` gerant ni ` kusmat /, 
  and in heaven | et in kailat | / et in ` kailat /, 
  give us today our daily bread | dave nostru ud\u00e9nas nostrum d\u00e9nim donam | / ` dave nuostru ude : nas nuostrum de : nim duonam /, 
  and forgive us our debts | et dim\u00edtes noster nostrum deb\u00edtami | / et dimi : tes nuoster nuostrum debi : tami /,

  amen . 
  | \u00c1men . 
  | / a : men /, 
  they are cognates aswell . 
  it is possibly an early ie or tocharian loan , or even of nostratic origin . 
  compare armenian `` oski '' ( gold ) and tocharian `` w\u00e4s '' ( gold ),

  finnic languages have a lot of loanwords from germanic languages . 
  even basic words such as `` yes '' , `` and '' , `` already '' , `` just '' ( as in `` just now '' ) - in estonian those are `` ja ( h ) '' , `` ja '' , `` ju '' / `` juba '' ( - ba adds emphasis , compare gothic `` ju '' ) , `` just '' ( pronounced / just / ), 
  1 ) sernerdas , an a posteriori based on mainly lithuanian and latin, 
  * luke [ vocative ] , be [ 1st person singular indicative ] you [ genitive ] father [ nominative ] *, 
  note : `` esm '' is not palatalised like it is in russian . 
  also , `` luke '' is in vocative , but since the vocative ending is either - e or a short stem , nothing changes . 
  2 ) an ergative-absolutive language with consonant mutations i have n't named yet, 
  * luke , you [ genitive ] father i + copula * ( copula is suffixed to word and it is - \u1ebd in masculine gender ), 
  i have n't worked on names yet in this language , so i just took the english pronounciation for it . 
  i initially read this wrong , and thought you wanted to increase the chance of getting puzzle boxes . 
  however having more puzzles themselves is perfectly fine , but i do n't think it 's worth the dev time . 
  `` kevad '' and `` kev\u00e4t '' are from proto-finnic * kev\u00e4t although there is a cognate in the mari languages - `` ke\u014be\u017e '' which means `` summer '' . 
  * doctor [ plural ] say [ 3rd person plural indicative ] drink [ 2nd person singular present subjunctive ] seven [ accusative singular ] glass [ accusative singular ] water [ genitive ] day [ locative ] *, 
  from what language did you take the - et ending for 1st person singular from ? 
  i only know russian and there , - et is the ending for 3rd person singular and - u or - ju are the 1st person singular endings . 
  oh ok , is that also the infinitive ? 
  oh of course , i forgot this . 
  will edit the op . 
  sound-wise : `` exskriberius '' - / ekskri ` berius / - `` to write out '' or `` to write outside '', 
  the / kskr / cluster sounds ugly . 
  aesthetically : `` insulaniumas '' / insu ` laniumas / - `` archipelago '' ( insula + - nium + - as ), 
  at first glance , it looks sort of clumsy , but after pronouncing and understanding it , it is n't bad ,, 
  ok , thanks . 
  thanks lol . 
  the language itself is pretty much indo-european . 
  i 'm not sure if you could call it a romlang since many elements are from other languages or made up . 
  regarding `` exskriberius '' , it follows a regular pattern of prefixing verbs . 
  e.g `` to travel around the world '' is `` jud\u00e9tius peri kusmat '' ( kusmat being in locative case ) , but `` to travel around '' as an intransitive verb is `` perijud\u00e9tius '' . 
  you can also stick prefixes together , so `` to come away '' is `` adob\u00edtius '' ( ad + ob + \u00edtius ), 
  the `` ex '' prefix means `` out from '' or a change of state out of something . 
  e.g `` i wrote outside of the house '' would be `` ego skriberil ex d\u00famat '' , but `` i wrote outside '' as an intransitive verb would be `` ego exskriberil '', 
  most of my translated texts that i have are translations of songs . 
  here 's a sample :, 
  * i [ genitive ] brother be [ 3rd person singular ] elk [ genitive ] grower far-away north [ locative ] . 
  what i he [ dative ] birthday [ accusative ] bring [ 1st person singular future ] *, 
  i 'd say hungarian . 
  do whatever you want . 
  you can have an a posteriori vocabulary with an a priori grammar and all points inbetween . 
  whence have you derived your vocabulary ? 
  could you post a sample ? 
  note : i literally translated `` bloody '', 
  bloody mole . 
  we no-consider [ present continious 1st person plural ] talk [ infinitive ] about bloody [ locative ] mole [ locative ] but bloody mole wink [ present continious 3rd person singular ] me [ accusative ] in face [ locative ] . 
  i want [ 1st person singular ] off-cut [ infinitive ] it [ accusative ] , off-chop [ infinitive ] it [ accusative ] and make [ infinitive ] guacamole [ accusative ] *, 
  * if the conversation is between 2 people , then it should be `` noster '' and the verb would be `` ne ` manytiuta '', 
  for romlangers , `` oxem '' ( nominative : `` ox '' or `` oxes '' ) is derived from latin `` hoc '' , which went / hok / -  / ok / -  / oks /,
