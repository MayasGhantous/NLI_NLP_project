  just plain old overworking . 
  you 'll burn out . 
  question : why * hervat - * ? 
  most languages usually have * horvat - * or something similar to that if they 're not deriving it from the latin * c ( h ) roatia * . 
  it 's not that big of a deal though . 
  i like the analogy with * serb - * . 
  if your conlang is n't supposed to be naturalistic , then go ahead . 
  i like * eaie * for / \u00e6 / , lol .

  there 's loads of material on them , so if you 're making an a posteriori conlang , a germanic or romance language is the simplest bet . 
  for example , making a na-dene a posteriori conlang is much much more difficult , since there 's less documentation . 
  their reputation is bad since beginners usually begin with these . 
  nothing wrong with that , in my opinion .

  pretty sure it 's 50-50 ( unless something very big has changed in 6 months ), 
  read , like others have pointed out . 
  could you give some examples from your conlang ? 
  for anglophones and other people whose native languages do n't generally have noun case , it will be difficult to learn . 
  but english luckily has case ( somewhat ) in pronouns , so always think back to ** he ** vs ** him ** ( the second being the `` accusative '' , or `` oblique '' ( since it takes prepositions : * to him * , and not `` to he '' ) , since english has nominative-accusative alignment ), 
  that 's cool . 
  i never expected osrs to grow like that . 
  might have to get back into it . 
  it should be in the nominative . 
  the girl is the subject in that sentence , she is doing the action ( dreaming ), 
  `` at night time '' is an adverb , you can mark it in any way ( a case can be used here , so something like * night-temporal * ) . 
  the way you do it is fine . 
  the object of the sentence is the patient , it is the person who the action is being done to ( i kill * her * , i see * him * ) . 
  this takes the accusative . 
  this sentence is intransitive , it has no object . 
  the person who is doing the verb is generally unmarked ( unless you have a marked nominative ) . 
  there are languages that mark evidentiality on nouns and not the verb ? 
  and i doubt he intended on marking something like that . 
  interesting . 
  could you give any examples from natlangs ? 
  now that i think about it , my native language , estonian , does this :, 
  * ** mulle see meeldib ** - * i-all this-dem like-prs-3sg * `` onto me this likes '' - `` i like this '' ( the allative is used for indirect objects ), 
  * ** mulle tundub , et ... ** - * i-all feel-prs-3sg , that-rel ... * `` onto me feels , that ... '' - `` i feel that ... '', 
  russian too :, 
  ** \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f ** - * i-dat this-dem like-prs-3sg * `` to me this likes '' - `` i like this '',

  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl is a finnic conlang spoken on the eastern coast of [ lake peipus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_peipus ) . 
  so it shares most of it 's animal names with other finnic languages , although with some exceptions . 
  here 's a small list :, 
  * bear : ** k\u00f5nca ** / ` k\u0264nts\u0251 / - this is a cognate to finnish * konsio * , but i forgot the etymology . 
  there is no cognate in estonian, 
  * bear : ** kar\u017eu ** / ` k\u0251r\u0292u / - this is from proto-finnic `` karhu '' , cognate to estonian * karu * and finnish * karhu * . 
  this is either derived from * karheda / `` coarse '' , or an indo-european loan through indo-iranian . 
  compare greek '' \u00e1rktos '' , and sanskrit '' \u1e5bk\u1e63\u00e1 '' . 
  * bear : ** \u00f5k\u0161i ** / ' \u0264k\u0283i / - this is a much rarer word , and is a cognate to finnish * oksi * . 
  there is no cognate in estonian . 
  * deer ( capreolus ) : ** kavriz ** / ` k\u0251vriz / - this is a cognate to finnish * kauris * and estonian * kabris * . 
  ultimately from a proto-germanic word meaning `` he-goat '' , `` buck '' .
