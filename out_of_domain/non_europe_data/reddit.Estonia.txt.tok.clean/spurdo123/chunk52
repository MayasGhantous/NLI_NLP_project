  old east slavic * gum\u012dno * yields votic * koomina * , finnish * kuomina * , dialectal estonian * koomits-a * but aunus karelian * kuomino * . 
  what is the etymology of * tahulzda * ? 
  estonian and finnish generally do n't drop the pronoun . 
  ah , that 's quite interesting . 
  estonian * tahvel * and finnish * taulu * seem to be loaned from different sources . 
  [ ety ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=tahvel&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et ) claims that the estonian word is a middle low german borrowing , which means it can only be theoretically shared with livonian , votic , and izhorian ( which would loan it from estonian , or latvian for livonian ) . 
  the finnish word might be a seperate swedish loan . 
  [ wiktionary ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taulu ) says it 's just a germanic borrowing . 
  an interesting etymology , nonetheless . 
  i 'll look in my votic dictionary and see if i ca n't find a cognate . 
  how estonian * armastus * was specifically derived :, 
  * armas * + * - tama * ( forms verbs ) = * armastama * `` to love '', 
  * armastama * + * - us * ( forms nouns ) = * armastus * `` love '' [ - ma is the infinitive suffix which is dropped in derivations ], 
  * - tama * is a cognate to finnish * - taa * . 
  for example :, 
  * estonian : * kaduma * `` to disappear ''  * kaotama * `` to lose '' [ consonant gradation takes place . 
  originally d-\u00d8 , now seemingly du-o because of sound changes ] ( note : the dictionary form of estonian verbs is the ma-infinitive , not the da-infinitive like in finnish . 
  those would be * kaduda * and * kaotada * , respectively ], 
  * finnish : * kadota * `` to disappear '' -  * kadottaa * `` to lose '', 
  * - us * is a cognate to finnish * - us * , * - ys * , and * - uus * . 
  for example :, 
  * estonian : * s\u00f5rm * `` finger '' -  * s\u00f5rmus * `` ring '' ( jewelry ), 
  * finnish : * sormi * `` finger '' -  * sormus * `` ring '' ( jewelry ), 
  the votic words for `` love '' are :, 
  * ** armauz ** - cognate to the estonian , karelian , and veps word . 
  * ** elte\u00fcz ** - also means `` gentleness '' , `` grace '' . 
  cognate to estonian * heldus * - `` generosity '' , `` grace '' . 
  * ** suvaamiin ** - this means something more like `` loving '' . 
  gerund of * suvata * `` to love '' , `` to tolerate '' . 
  cognate to finnish * suvaita * `` to tolerate '' , `` to accept '' , and estonian * suvatsema * `` to be bothered to do sth '' ( borrowed from finnish ) . 
  estonian : ** raisakotkas ** , from * raisk * `` carrion '' , `` corpse '' ( but in modern colloquial use just a swear word , akin to `` damn '' or `` heck '' ) + * kotkas * `` eagle '' . 
  the old english * wer * and latin * vir * are related through proto-indo-european , the common ancestor of most of the languages of europe , persia , and northern india . 
  kurdish and armenian too . 
  the exceptions in europe are the uralic languages ( finnish , estonian , hungarian , and the various ones spoken in russia ) , and also basque , whose relatives are all dead . 
  lithuanian for example has * vyras * , and irish has * fear * . 
  the original reconstructed proto-indo-european word was * wihr\u00f3s . 
  proto-finnic * henki also had the meaning of `` breath '' . 
  this meaning is missing in estonian , livonian , ludic , veps , and izhorian . 
  the meaning of `` breath '' ; `` breathing '' exists in finnish , votic , and aunus karelian . 
  the verb * hingama * `` to breathe '' exists in estonian , and `` breath '' translates to * hinget\u00f5mme * or * hinge\u00f5hk * `` pull of the soul '' ; `` air of the soul '' . 
  ( the first refers to one single breath ; the second to the odor of your breath ), 
  finnish * sielu * might be a germanic loan , but like with many other words , it 's impossible to tell whether the word came from a baltic or germanic language . 
  because * taivas * `` heaven '' is also a baltic loan ( compare lithuanian * dievas * `` god '' ) , the baltic theory seems more plausible . 
  another example of a word where it 's impossible to tell where the loan came from :, 
  * finnish : ** ranta ** , estonian : ** rand ** `` beach '' , `` shore '', 
  * lithuanian : ** krantas ** , latvian : ** krants ** `` beach '' , `` shore '' [ latvian word is dialectal ], 
  * swedish : ** strand ** , norwegian ** strand ** `` beach '' , `` shore '', 
  because finnic languages simplify initial consonant clusters , you ca n't tell where it came from . 
  although ; baltic * - as * ending nouns tend to preserve their ending , but not always . 
  lithuanian * \u0161ienas * is a cognate to finnish * hein\u00e4 * `` hay '' , not something like `` hein\u00e4s '' . 
  however lithuanian * \u017eambas * is a cognate to finnish * hammas * ( veps and ludic * hambaz * ) `` tooth '' ( `` sharp edge '' in lithuanian ) . 
  also , the * ie * in the finnish word is irregular . 
  baltic loans happened before this sound change ( ei -  ie ) happened in lithuanian and latvian . 
  athough the proto-baltic and proto-norse reconstructed forms happen to both have * - a * at the end . 
  what language are you talking about ? 
  * sila * means `` force '' , `` power '' in various slavic languages . 
  friendly reminder : learn ipa !, 
  that pronounciation guide is useless . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_phonetic_alphabet ) is a good start . 
  scroll down a bit and there is a table of sounds . 
  click on each one , the article has a sound file of the sound being pronounced . 
  it also has the phonetic description , pay attention to that , it will come useful ( e.g when discussing sound changes you will hear words such as `` nasal '' , `` bilabial '' , `` palatal '' , `` velar '' , etc , which are very important . 
  they all have to do with how you pronounce the sound . ), 
  yeah , lithuanian * siela * and serbo-croatian * sila * are actually [ cognates ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/siela ) . 
  probably not . 
  the proto-germanic form is reconstructed as `` saiwal\u014d '' ( the gothic word is * * - * saiwala * ) , while the proto-balto-slavic form is `` s\u00e9\u02c0ila\u02c0 '' . 
  sound changes in the daughter languages just made it seem closer . 
  yes , i mean that the literal translation is missing , it only exists in compounds/derivations , and special phrases like you mentioned . 
  * hing * as in `` hinge '' is a middle low german loan . 
  the english `` hinge '' is a cognate . 
  there 's lots of words like that :, 
  * * kipper * `` skipper '', 
  * * pott * `` pot '', 
  * * number * `` number '' [ that - mb - is a coincidence . 
  the same sound change happened in old french ( inheriting from latin ) , and estonian ( borrowing from high german ) ], 
  * * kool * `` school '', 
  * * kiikama * `` to keek '' [ - ma is an infinitive suffix ], 
  * * t\u00fc\u00fcrima * `` to steer '' ( a boat ), 
  although a few of these are high german loans . 
  they 're synonyms , but not quite . 
  * pere * is a more general term . 
  * perekond * only refers to the parents and the children , who live under one household . 
  lithuanian generally does n't borrow words from proto-slavic though . 
  the few slavic loans that exist in the standard language are generally quite new , from polish or belarussian . 
  it 's unlikely that it was borrowed since latvian and old prussian also have this word ( * saime * and * seim\u012bns * , respectively ), 
  that initial '' \u0161 '' does n't exist in any slavic language aswell . 
  the proto-balto-slavic root should be * \u015boi-m - , and is where both the baltic and slavic words originate . 
  through pie it '' s a cognate to english `` home '' . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://mw.lojban.org/papri/conlang_test_sentences ) a great site . 
  also a few of my favourites :, 
  `` you know , the world is n't run by the laws written on paper . 
  it 's run by people . 
  some according to laws ,, 
  others not . 
  it depends on each individual how his world will be , how he makes it . '', 
  `` show me your cunt , young girl . 
  show me your breasts . 
  show me your tits , here on the street . 
  let 's fuck here on the street just like dogs . '',
