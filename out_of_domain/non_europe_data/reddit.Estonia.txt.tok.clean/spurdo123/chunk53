  he sung this song ( translated from irish ) on a street , and nobody understood him or paid attention to him . 
  the show was called no b\u00e9arla , i think ], 
  `` when both parties , the machines involved , when both of them hate you , then you know america loves you and we do love he who will be the next president of the united states of america , donald j. 
  yes , now i realised that , but it 's still incorrect . 
   does n't really matter , softened s can turn into an \u0161 pretty easily, 
  could you give any examples from lithuanian ? 
  these type of maps tend to have odd language borders . 
  best to not mind them . 
  e.g the karelian and hungarian areas are extremely simplified . 
  use of `` sa '' ( informal singular 2nd person pronoun ) and `` te '' ( formal singular 2nd person pronoun ) is inconsistent here , which is bad . 
  should be, 
  and ,, 
   mis numbril on sinu valu ? 
  should be, 
   mis numbril on teie valu ? 
  and the formal imperatives are :, 
  estonian does the opposite . 
  the comitative suffix is placed after the genitive stem , and agrees with pronouns and adjectives in the genitive . 
  ** minu ilusa kepiga ** - * 1sg-gen beautiful-gen stick - ( gen ) - com *, 
  * kepi * is the genitive of * kepp * `` stick '' ( nominative ) , and * - ga * is the comitative suffix . 
  * `` clean '' , `` stainless '' , `` perfect '', 
  ** sav ** / 's \u00e6f / * n. * `` fish '', 
  derived terms :, 
  * ** savit ** / 's \u00e6v\u0259d / * n. * `` something resembling a fish '', 
  * `` relating to fish '' ; `` fishlike '', 
  * ** sauveston ** / ' \u0283o : vi\u0283to : / * v. * `` to catch fish '', 
  ** geirh ** / ` ge : r / * n. * `` fall '' , `` a drop '', 
  derived terms :, 
  * ** geron ** / ` giro : / * v. * `` to fall '', 
  * ** geireston ** / ` ge : ri\u0283to : / * v. * `` to catch something or somebody mid-fall '' , `` to prevent something or somebody from falling '', 
  * mul * is the adessive case . 
  ( on top of something ), 
  saying * mul on * , lit . 
  `` on top of me is '' , is used for ownership ( `` to have sth '' in english ) . 
  this is used for other nouns aswell : * temal on * `` he has '' ; lit . 
  `` on top of him is '' , * bussijuhil on * `` the busdriver has '' ; lit . 
  `` on top of the bus driver is '' . 
  it 's also used for phrases like * mul on k\u00fclm * `` i 'm cold '' , lit . 
  `` on top of me is cold '' or `` i have cold '' , and * mul l\u00e4heb h\u00e4sti * `` i 'm doing good/well/fine '' , lit . 
  `` on top of me goes well '' . 
  some verbs also use the adessive . 
  e.g * vedama * `` to be lucky '' , but if you do n't use the adessive it means `` to pull '' :, 
  `` on me no pulled '' [ that - nud is the past active participle , also used for negation in the past ], 
  `` i no pulled '', 
  * mul * can also translate to `` for me '' . 
  e.g in verbs like `` to help '' , `` to do '' . 
  the person who is being helped is marked with the adessive . 
  `` he did on me homework away '', 
  * ta aitas mul lehti riisuda * - `` he helped me rake the leaves '' , lit . 
  `` he helped on me leaves to rake '', 
  i do n't know how to describe the following usage , but it 's somewhat colloquial , and still has something to do with ownership . 
  * ta pani mul minema * - `` he ran out on me '' , `` he ran away '' ( and he had something to do with me ) . 
  `` he put on me to go '' , although * minema panema * just means `` to start to go '' , `` to run away '' , etc. 
  this is a really complicated aspect of estonian verbs i would n't suggest diving into quite so soon . 
  note , if you literally want to say `` on top of the busdriver '' , you would use a postposition along with the genitive : * bussijuhi peal * . 
  note : `` kurat '' is a really mild swear . 
  it 's on par with `` heck '' , `` darn '' , or `` damn '' . 
  * raisk * is also quite soft , but not as soft as * kurat * . 
  stuff like * t\u00fcra * , * vitt * , etc are extremely vulgar and you only hear them spoken by the youth . 
  historical spelling is rare since most languages have only been written down and codified quite late . 
  i would n't consider homonyms a `` natural feature '' , but synonyms , yeah . 
  especially if the language has a literary tradition , however long . 
  ( estonian for example has a literary tradition of 100-150 years , and has a ton of synonyms , many of them extremely obscure . 
  also obscure grammatical forms that have been created by linguists , such as * - tet * for the past passive participle instead of * - tud * . 
  this is rare today . ), 
  actually , now that i think about it , i 'm not sure . 
  are there any languages with no homonyms , or only a handful ? 
  yeah , you 're right . 
  southern finnic languages ( estonian , v\u00f5ro , seto , votic ) have / y / , / \u0264 / , / \u00f8 / , and / \u0251 / . 
  v\u00f5ro also has / \u0268 / as an allophone of / \u0264 / before nasal consonants . 
  / \u0264 / 's part in vowel harmony is quite important . 
  it eliminated / e / as a neutral vowel . 
  so , while finnish can say, 
  / ` velk\u0251 / `` debt '' , with a front and a back vowel , votic says / ` v\u0264lk\u0251 / . 
  / i / is still a neutral vowel in all finnic languages , meaning it can exist in all words , regardless of the type of vowel harmony .

  let 's start with the vowels :, 
  diphthongs turned into long vowels :, 
  * ~ / \u0251i / -  / \u00e6 : / - written as \\ < ai  - from proto-mutish * / i : / , or something like / a : / ~ / \u00e4 : / ~ / \u0251 : /, 
  * / e\u0251 / ~ / \u025b\u0251 / -  / \u025b : / - written as < ea  - from proto-mutish * / \u025b : / ~ / \u00e6 : /, 
  * / o\u0251 / ~ / \u0254\u0251 / -  / \u0252 : / - written as < oa  - from proto-mutish * / o : /, 
  * / ei / ~ / \u025bi / -  / e : / ~ / \u025b : / - written as < ei  - from proto-mutish * / e : / ~ / \u025b : /, 
  * / ue / ~ / ui / -  / y : / - written as < ue  - from proto-mutish * / u : /, 
  * / \u0251u / ~ / \u0254u / -  / o : / - written as < au  - from proto-mutish * / \u0251 : / , or something like / u : / ~ / o : /, 
  there is a system of ablaut , which , before the advent of writing , was a simple vowel-length one . 
  long vowels were eventually diphthongised , and then later turned into long vowels again . 
  unstressed vowels also underwent sound changes :,
