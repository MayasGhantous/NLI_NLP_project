  stops also underwent changes , which affected vowels . 
  word-final / g / was deleted . 
  this blocked the former unstressed vowel changes . 
  historical / og / yields modern / \u00f8 / though , with some exceptions . 
  word-final / b / evolved in numerous ways . 
  before historical / i / , it turned into / u / and palatalised the previous consonant . 
  before historical / e / , it became / u / , and that / e / became / \u025b / . 
  before historical / \u0251 / it became / u / and that / \u0251 / became / \u0259 / . 
  word-final / d / became / t / , in all cases . 
  word-final voiceless consonants became voiced . 
  ( / k / , / p / , / t / , / s / -  / g / , / b / , / d / , / z / ), 
  intervocalic voiced stops underwent a sound shift :, 
  * / g / -  / j /, 
  * / b / -  / v /, 
  * / d / -  / \u025f / , but / j / in the 3rd syllable or later, 
  / s / before modern long vowels became / \u0283 / . 
  / s / in all consonant clusters became / \u0283 / . 
  nasal consonants after vowels were deleted , and the vowel recieved compensatory lengthening . 
  word-final geminated consonants became un-geminated , with the exception of / s : / after / \u00e6 / ( historical / \u0251 / ), 
  a class of nouns are written with < < h   at the end of the word in the absolutive . 
  this appears to block sound changes but it 's unknown what the original sound was . 
  it might be aspiration , but there are no traces of it anywhere else . 
  and various other changes . 
  initial / v / became / f / in some cases . 
  this does n't even mention dialects . 
  this is the pronounciation which the standard language proscribes . 
  in formal speech people will pronounce * vann * `` water '' as / ` v\u00e6n / , but you will commonly hear things like / ` f\u00e6n / , / ` fan / , / ` v\u0251n : / , etc. 
  the standard language has mostly killed the original dialects , but much like english , people often have `` accents '' ( * aksentac * / ' \u00e6ksint\u00e6g / ) , which are much more varied and different than the ones english has . 
  there are still grammatical differences of course . 
  the consonant mutation system varies wildly . 
  the standard languages has no postpositions , but in some dialects they exist . 
  thanks , but what do you mean by `` you need to escape some brackets '' ? 
  huh . 
  i do n't notice anything odd .

  in semae ` zel , what does < u  represent , and is there a phoneme like / o / or / \u0254 / ? 
  how different are the central dialects from the standard , if at all ? 
  the southern dialects seem pretty similar aswell .

  but oh some people there he saw *, 
  the antipassive is used here because the speaker is using the verb `` to say '' , and then stating a fact , which is in the 2nd infinitive ( `` doing x '' , sort of like participles . ) . 
  `` he said x '' , is never `` he-erg x-abs said '' , but `` he-abs antip said x [ as the 2nd infinitive ] '' . 
  this also stresses the speaker himself . 
  also : do keep doing these !, 
  the more often the better . 
  what is the difference in the use of < o  and < u  then ?

  if anyone 's wondering why most maps are of europe , it 's because documentation is best for european languages , and most people in the subreddit are ( seem to be ) from europe . 
  there are a few maps of asia though , such as [ water ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/5w2255/water_in_various_languages_of_asia/ ) , [ iron ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/5z4ku8/iron_in_various_languages_of_asia/ ) , and [ paper ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/etymologymaps/comments/5z4lvq/paper_in_various_languages_of_asia/ ) , by u / - o-o-o - .
