  yep . 
  the finnic languages are a famous example . 
  an example from estonian :, 
  ** ma s\u00f6\u00f6n vorsti ** - * 1sg eat-1sg-prs sausage-part * - `` i am eating sausage '', 
  ** ma s\u00f6\u00f6n vorsti \u00e4ra ** - * 1sg eat-1sg-prs sausage-gen away [ implies the perfective aspect ] * - `` i will eat the sausage '' ( in the future , but relatively soon , probably immediately ), 
  it belongs to the finnic family . 
  estonian and votic are the closest by vocabulary . 
  phonologically , it shares some similarities with veps , votic , and livonian . 
  the grammar is a bit more unique , but similar to estonian in syntax . 
  but yeah , finnish is a close relative . 
  some isoglosses shared with the southern finnic languages ( estonian , votic , livonian ) :, 
  * / e / in back vowel harmony words -  / \u0264 /, 
  * / o / in the first syllable and sometimes in other positions -  / \u0264 /, 
  isoglosses shared with votic :, 
  * / k / before front vowels -  / t\u0283 /, 
  * loss of initial / h /, 
  * loss of word-final / n / and / m / . 
  the previous vowel recieves compensatory lengthening . 
  however , in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , if the vowel before was originally long , the nasal consonant is preserved . 
  so compare votic * p\u00e4\u00e4 * - * head-gen * to m\u0101\u010d\u012bl * p\u00e4\u00e4n * - * head-gen * . 
  loss of final nasals also happened in estonian , but without compensatory lengthening . 
  unique grammatical features :, 
  * subjunctive mood . 
  developed from the past conditional . 
  ( conditional 2 ) . 
  e.g ** \u00f5li\u0161in min\u00e4 vabraz ... ** - * be-1sg-subj 1sg rich * - `` oh , if i were rich . . '', 
  * dative constructions are odd . 
  for example , compare estonian ** mul on k\u00fclm ** - * 1sg-ade be-3sg-prs cold * to m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ** \u010d\u00fclm\u00e4 \u00f5\u00f5 min\u016b ** - * cold be-3sg-prs 1sg-gen * . 
  the estonian sentence in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl cognate-by-cognate would be ** minuta \u00f5\u00f5 \u010d\u00fclm\u00e4 ** , which is ungrammatical , or a dialectal estonianism . 
  also , the name itself , * m\u0101\u010d\u012bl * / 'm \u0251 : t\u0283i : l\u02b2 / , lit . 
  `` land language '' , a compound from * m\u0101 * `` land '' ( compare * mua * in karelian , * ma * in veps , * m\u014d * in livonian , and * maa * in all other finnic languages ) , and * \u010d\u012bl * `` tongue '' , `` language '' ( compare estonian * keel * , finnish * kieli * , votic * t\u0161eeli * , livonian * k\u0113\u013c * , etc. ) . 
  this ethnonym , `` land language '' , `` landfolk '' is really common among finnic peoples . 
  estonian ( as * maakeel * ) and votic ( as * maat\u0161eeli * ) have used this name . 
  this was the original name for estonian . 
  the current name , * eesti keel * , is a loan from high german in the 17th century , which became popular in the 19th century . 
  the livonians called their language `` shore language '' or `` beach language '' - * r\u0101ndak\u0113\u013c * ( * rannakeel * in estonian , something like * rannan keeli * in finnish , and * pereg\u012b\u010d\u012bl * or * ramm\u0101\u010d\u012bl * in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ), 
  the ludic name for their language , * l\u00fc\u00fcdi * , might be derived from a slavic or germanic word meaning `` people '' ( compare gothic * liudi * and russian * ljudi * * \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 * ), 
  a few words are shared with the northern finnic languages , but not the southern ones :, 
  * ** \u00e4\u00e4 ** / ' \u00e6 : / - 3rd person singular pronoun . 
  compare finnish and veps * h\u00e4n * and karelian * h\u00e4i * . 
  phonologically , this word undergoes the exact same changes as votic theoretically would . 
  ( loss of initial / h / and word-final / n / , compensatory lengthening ), 
  * ** k\u00f5\u0161k\u00f5da ** / ` k\u0264\u0283k\u0264\u00f0\u0251 / - `` to touch '' , `` to steal '' . 
  compare finnish * koskea * and izhorian * koskia * `` to touch '' . 
  * ** \u014dtari ** / ` o : t\u0251ri / - `` holster '' , `` sheath '' , `` bag '' . 
  compare finnish * hootra * and izhorian * hoodra * `` sheath '' , `` scabbard '' . 
  * ** k\u00f5nca ** / ` k\u0264nts\u0251 / - `` bear '' .
