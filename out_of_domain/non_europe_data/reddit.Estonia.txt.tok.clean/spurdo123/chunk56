  yeah , but how is it reconstructed as * orb\u044a , when all the slavic languages underwent this change ? 
  edit : ah , thanks for that link . 
  no , we do n't have that idiom . 
  do you know how old it is ? 
  if it 's newer than the 19th century , then it could n't have been loaned . 
  the verb * olema * `` to be '' is an auxilliary for the perfect ( formed together with the past active participle . 
  the auxilliary defines the tense/mood ( present , past , quotative ), 
  our low german loans are old . 
  the nobility adopted high german by about the 16th century . 
  so , technical terms regarding ships , boats , and the sea are usually low german . 
  terms regarding things like machines and medicine are usually high german . 
  before the 1930s , we wrote < v  as < w  , but it was seen as too german .

  * this-adv def [ mixed mutation ] tree-erg tomorrow-adv burn-3sg-fut [ emphatic topic marker ] *, 
  the reason that `` tree '' is in the ergative is because the tree himself probably does n't like being burned . 
  i.e he is burning involuntarily . 
  so , compare :,

  some notes :, 
  the word for `` letter '' in the standard language is either ** laiskas ** or ** pisma ** . 
  the latter is a slavic loan , found mainly in eastern dialects . 
  the word ** pestula ** in the northern dialects is a loan from latin . 
  the word ** br\u012bf ** / ** pr\u012bfs ** in the western dialects is a loan from german . 
  the word ** raetei ** in east courland dialects is a cognate to ** raid\u0113 ** in the standard language , meaning `` letter of the alphabet '' ; `` character '' . 
  i ca n't remember exactly . 
  i started experimenting with languages ( mainly orthography , phonology and dialects , never got into grammar ) in ~ 2012-2013 or so , and started making a real conlang in late 2015 , the same time when i discovered this subreddit . 
  i ca n't remember how i found this subreddit , but probably through r/linguistics , in some way . 
  i 'm not sure where my interest in languages came from . 
  i knew ipa beforehand though , since i learnt it at school , during english lessons .
