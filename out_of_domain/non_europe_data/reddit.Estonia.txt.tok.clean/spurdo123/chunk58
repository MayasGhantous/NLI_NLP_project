  * the lake far here shall be *, 
  note : the reason why the future is used is because the speaker is telling this to someone who is on their way to the lake . 
  you could use the present tense , but it would mean something like `` the lake is far away , do n't bother going there '' . 
   voiced consonants were still common ( as they are in estonian ) ;, 
  estonian does n't have any voiced stops . 
  they are lenis . 
  the pronounication of estonian `` g '' , `` b '' , `` d '' is very similar to finnish intervocalic `` k '' , `` p '' , `` t '' . 
  the finnish `` d '' as in `` k\u00e4den '' - * hand-gen * is voiced , though . 
  the new testament was originally written in the southern estonian dialect , so i ca n't comment on its features since it 's not my native language . 
  the old testament was first written in a northern estonian dialect . 
  for anyone curious , it can be found [ here ] ( http://www.digar.ee/viewer/et/nlib-digar:427/21495/page/32 ) . 
  because it 's so old , the language is more `` pure '' , i.e all the artifical elements in modern estonian are n't there . 
  my fraktur ai n't so good , but from what i can tell , it 's quite similar to modern estonian . 
  the orthography is quirky . 
  the '' \u00f5 '' / \u0264 / phoneme is written down in many ways . 
  the soundshift should be quite old , but it 's written down like it was n't there sometimes : ** sanna ** instead of ** s\u00f5na ** ( * sana * in finnish ) . 
  many differences have to do with `` g '' , `` b '' , and `` d '' contrasting with `` k '' , `` p '' , `` t '' . 
  some different words : ( 1715 vs modern ), 
  * ** alganud ** vs ** alanud ** - past active participle of * algama * `` to begin '', 
  * ** parrandamatta ** vs ** parandamata ** - * - mata * form of * parandama * `` to fix '' , so `` without fixing '', 
  * ** agga ** vs ** aga ** - `` but '', 
  * ** l\u00e4ts ** vs ** l\u00e4ks ** - 3rd person singular past of * minema * `` to go '' . 
  this seems like a southern-estonian dialectal feature to me . 
  also seems like a southern-estonian word . 
  * ** t\u00e4\u00e4dma ** vs ** teadma ** - `` to know '' . 
  * ** s\u00e4\u00e4l ** vs ** seal ** - `` there '' . 
  this is often found in poetic language . 
  the usage of * ea * instead of * \u00e4\u00e4 * in the standard language was controversial in its time , because * \u00e4\u00e4 * is much more common among dialects . 
  some weird uses of cases :, 
  * ** agga kui jesus nende m\u00f6tted n\u00e4ggi ** - here , either the plural accusative or plural nominative of * m\u00f5te * `` thought '' is used . 
  the modern sentence would be ** aga kui jeesus nende m\u00f5tteid n\u00e4gi ** - `` but when jesus saw their thoughts '' , with the plural partitive . 
  ** `` all things have been given to me to go to ??? '', 
  - the usage of the adessive * mul * instead of the allative * mulle * is weird for me . 
  this is still used in poetic language though . 
  the sentence in modern estonian would be ** k\u00f5ik asjad on mulle antud , et minna ??? ** . 
  * et * is a word that introduces a relative clause . 
  it usually ca n't be dropped . 
  usage of the illative instead of the allative is odd . 
  in the modern language the construction '' \u00fctles vastu '' does n't exist . 
  overall , not too different . 
  some constructions are clumsy in modern use and the orthography is weird . 
  the previous vowel is / \u00e6 / . 
  this only happens in a couple of really commonly used words , such as ** casanag ** / ` k\u00e6s\u00e6n\u00e6 / `` where ? '', 
  ( interrogative ), 
  some idiolects/dialects would also pronounce * banag * as / ' \u03b2\u00e6n\u00e6 / , but it 's seen as non-standard . 
  are there any situations where * on * ca n't be omitted at all , in informal speech ? 
  cool . 
  i just realised your conlang is finnic , lol . 
  is it realistic , or just inspired by it ? 
  i do n't recognise * kahkamm\u00eb * , but the rest are obvious cognates . 
  it looks kind of similar to finnish * kaukainen * , though . 
  i like that votic-like back-vowel in * javri * . 
  does this only exist in this word , like in votic , or is it a more regular change ? 
  does your conlang have a name ? 
   and not have / ks / as a phoneme . 
  hey , / ks / is pretty cool . 
  especially when there 's also / gz / . 
  interesting . 
  also , for some inspiration . 
  finnic peoples have derived their demonyms from a number of things . 
  a common one is `` landfolk '' and `` land language '' for estonian and votic . 
  the finns call themselves after a baltic word for `` land '' . 
  the ludes probably call themselves after a germanic or slavic word for `` people '' . 
  the livonians call themselves the `` shorefolk '' and their language the `` shore language '' . 
  the votes call themselves after a sharp stick ( * va\u010f\u010fa * ; * vai * in estonian ) - their symbol . 
  so , for example you could borrow a sami word for `` people '' , `` land '' , or something , and derive it from there . 
  \u00e4\u00e4 / ea is a bit different . 
  standard estonian also has * pea * `` head '' , while finnish and most estonian dialects have * p\u00e4\u00e4 * . 
  although karelian has * pi\u00e4 * . 
  although yeah , * seal * corresponds to * siell\u00e4 * and * teadma * corresponds to * tiet\u00e4\u00e4 * . 
  although in that last case the original vowel was a long * ee * , which makes the estonian word irregular . 
  ( finnish regularly changes * ee * -  * ie * ), 
  * kergem * / older * kergemb * is a cognate to finnish * kerke\u00e4mpi * , but it means `` quicker '' . 
  yep . 
  the estonian and finnish words were loaned through either proto-germanic , or proto-baltic . 
  the proto-baltic word might be a proto-germanic loan . 
  in sernerdas :, 
  ** natas ** / ` n\u00e4t\u00e4s / - sister of one 's husband ; asscheek, 
  `` sister of one 's husband '' is a loan from finnic , from original `` nato ( s ) '' . 
  compare finnish * nato * and estonian * nadu * . 
  i forgot where i derived `` asscheek '' from , but it 's the older meaning .
