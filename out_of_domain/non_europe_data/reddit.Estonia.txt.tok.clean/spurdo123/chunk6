  -  / ` uoks / . 
  the meaning is quite different aswell . 
  it means both `` it '' ( also as an inanimate 3rd person singular pronoun ) and `` this '', 
  estonian :, 
  * fight [ 2nd person singular imperative ] i [ comitative ] *, 
  `` kaklema '' is related to `` katkema '' ( to break , to break in two , to halt , to stop ) , and it is of finnic origin . 
  the formal or plural imperative would be `` kakelge minuga '', 
  not really strange , but i have 2 very common words that are from english :, 
  * longis / ` luo\u014bis / - `` long '', 
  also , the verb `` oulderius '' / ` oulderius / and noun `` oulderas '' / ` oulderas / - `` to hold '' and `` holder '' , which i borrowed from english so i could have `` st\u00e1toulderas '' ( stadtholder ), 
  there are other words that by coincidence look similar to english , when in fact they are from latin . 
  e.g `` upinias '' / u ` pinjas / - `` opinion '' is from latin `` opinio '' . 
  also `` studentas '' - `` student '' , which is from lithuanian `` studentas '' ( i think , might 've borrowed it from english and added - as ), 
  * no-wait [ 2nd person singular imperative present ] other [ accusative plural ] , that they make [ conditional future 3rd person plural ] you [ accusative ] into ( only used for a change of state into something ) happy [ locative ] *, 
  `` hello '' :, 
  * salve / ` salve /, 
  nothing special . 
  `` salve '' is romantic , but the rest are n't , i guess . 
  `` welcome '' :, 
  * sveikam / ` sveikam / - literally `` safety '' in accusative, 
  * sveikane / ` sveikane / - literally `` we guard '', 
  `` goodbye '' :, 
  i have some features that are only used in the spoken/common language . 
  1 ) contractions . 
  f.e `` tu iest '' ( you are ) becomes `` tu ` st '', 
  2 ) reduced vowels :, 
  * / a / -  / \u0250 /, 
  * / e / -  / \u0259 /, 
  * / i / -  / \u0268 /, 
  * / u / -  ~ / \u028a /, 
  * / \u0268 / -  / \u0258 / ( slightly higher than schwa ), 
  3 ) shortening of words and suffixes . 
  the gender markers - as and - os are emitted in many words . 
  words like `` fagerius '' ( to do ) become `` ferius '', 
  4 ) loss of dual number . 
  5 ) loss of obscure grammatical features , for example 3rd person future imperative . 
  i have n't fully fleshed this out yet though . 
  i 've toyed with dialects aswell . 
  f.e over 50 variations of the word `` i '' , which is `` ego '' / ego : / in the standard , written language . 
  3 grades of formality :, 
  * if you [ 2nd person singular informal ] go [ 2nd person singular present continious ] through hell [ locative ] , continue [ 2nd person singular imperative ] go [ gerund accusative singular ] *, 
  * if you [ 2nd person plural semi-formal ] go [ 2nd person plural present continious ] through hell [ locative ] , continue [ 2nd person plural imperative ] go [ gerund accusative singular ] *, 
  * if you [ 2nd person plural formal ] go [ 2nd person plural present continious ] through hell [ locative ] , continue [ 2nd person plural imperative ] go [ gerund accusative singular ] *, 
  i ` ve n't done the months , but i have done the days of the week :, 
  * und\u00e9nas - / un ` de : nas / - literally `` one day '' or `` first day '', 
  * dud\u00e9nas - / du ` de : nas / - `` second day '', 
  * trid\u00e9nas - / tri ` de : nas / - `` third day '', 
  * ked\u00e9nas - / ke ` de : nas / - `` fourth day '', 
  * j\u00f3vas - / jo : vas / - named after jupiter . 
  note : this is n't actually the genitive of `` jupiter '' in the conlang , it 's a fossilised form loaned from latin . 
  * saturn\u00e1las - / saturna : las / - named after saturn, 
  * kid\u00e9nas - / ki ` de : nas / - the `` ki - '' is from `` kieskius '' , which means `` to rest '' , so `` resting day '' . 
  * ed\u00e9nas / ede : nas / - yesterday, 
  * prud\u00e9nas / pru ` de : nas / - day after tomorrow, 
  * pred\u00e9nas / prede : nas / - day before yesterday, 
  you can repeat the pr - prefix , so `` the day before the day before yesterday '' would be `` pre-pred\u00e9nas '', 
  i went for a very simple phonology that ( by coincidence ) looks very similar to the ipa . 
  although for example / a / should actually be [ \u00e4 ] , but this is n't too important i think . 
  except for `` o '' , long vowels are n't any different in quality than the short ones . 
  estonian ( and finnish ) :, 
  there are multible theories :, 
  1 ) from baltic * deivas ( wiktionary gives a more narrow `` proto-balto-slavic * deiwas '' ) , meaning `` god '', 
  2 ) from proto-indo-iranian * daivas , for which the cognate would be old indian dev\u00e1 - , meaning `` heavenly '' or `` divine '' . 
  the meaning is closer than the baltic root . 
  3 ) from proto-germanic * teiwaz , for which the cognate is old icelandic t\u00fdr ( the god ), 
  the baltic origin is the most likely , but either way , it is an indo-european loan . 
  the finnish `` tapellaan '' is similar to estonian `` tapleme '' , which means something like `` lets violently brawl with eachother '' or `` lets ( violently ) argue with eachother '' . 
  kind of funny i guess . 
  good job though , 
  estonian :, 
  `` s\u00fcsi '' - from proto-uralic but i do n't know the reconstructed root . 
  also `` kivis\u00fcsi '' which is a more narrow definition or type of `` coal '' . 
  `` kivi '' ( rock , stone ) + `` s\u00fcsi '' . 
  `` kivi '' is from proto-finno-ugric * kiwe . 
  the word for `` carbon '' is also derived from this root - `` s\u00fcsinik '', 
  `` meco '' is apparently an archaic or literary term for `` con me '' , but the most common one should be used , yes . 
  condensed [ adjective , nominative ] milk [ noun , nominative ], 
  those no-be [ 3rd person plural present ] mountain [ plural ] , they-are [ contracted form of '' \u00edle esti '' ] wave [ plural ], 
  actually , you 're right . 
  i think i misread the source . 
  ** - indiana jones et fin\u00e1lis karag\u00e1ienas, 
  nationalsocialist [ plural ] , i hate [ 1st person singular present ] this [ accusative plural ] guy [ accusative plural ], 
  * this could be shortened to `` naciei '', 
  vowels : / \u0268 / , / \u0252 / , / \u0264 / , / \u0259 / , / y /, 
  consonants : / ts / , / \u0256 / , / \u0288 / , / \u025f / , / c /, 
  no particular order . 
  / ` tades ego : ` fivi ` muortas ekstermina ` to : ras kusmuri : /, 
  * now i become [ 1st person singular present perfect ] death , destroyer world [ genitive plural ] *, 
  note : `` exterminat\u00f3ras '' has the synonym `` sunaikintat\u00f3ras '' . 
  yep , this . 
  i 've taken a habit of translating song lyrics , and it helped me develop my grammar aswell , at points where i had no features for what was required . 
  i guess `` vot '' , which functions pretty much the same as the estonian `` vot '' and russian '' \u0432\u043e\u0442 '' ( vot ) ( as far as i know the 2 are the same ) . 
  the borrowing of this word into my conlang makes sense since in my conworld ( nothing more than mapping dialects onto europe currently ) the language is situated in the area of latvia and lithuania , so both estonian and russian are close . 
  pronounced / vuot / ~ / wot / ( / wo / is an allophone of / vuo / ), 
  it 's used as an intensifier of sorts . 
  hard to explain . 
  `` damn , that 's a good song '' could be translated as `` vot ox est buenis musas '', 
  or `` well , now we 're going '' ( after some complications or delays ) could be translated as `` vot tad \u00edtene '', 
  kind of yeah , but not exactly . 
  * you say [ 2nd person present ] that be [ 1st person singular present ] crazy , because you no-think [ 2nd person singular present ] that i know [ 1st person singular ] what [ accusative ] you do [ 2nd person singular present perfect ] *,
