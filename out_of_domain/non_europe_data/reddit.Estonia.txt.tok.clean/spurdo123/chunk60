  ** p\u00f5\u0161m\u00f5da ** / ` p\u0264\u0283m\u0264\u00f0\u0251 / - has a positive connotation . 
  cognate to finnish * pehme\u00e4 * and estonian * pehme * . 
  the proto-finnic form is likely * pehmed\u00e4 . 
  ** l\u012bp\u00f5da ** / ` li :p \u0264\u00f0\u0251 / - used only for things relating to the weather , e.g `` soft wind '' . 
  ** l\u00f6\u00fc\u010di ** / ` l\u00f8yt\u0283i / - also means `` weak '' , so it has a mostly negative connotation . 
  cognate to votic * l\u00f6\u00fchki\u00e4 * `` soft '' , `` tepid '' , `` mild '' . 
  thanks , 
  thanks !, 
  probably so , i 'll have to check if there 's a cognate in votic . 
  it does n't perfectly fit phonologically though . 
  seconded . 
  that 's an interesting question . 
  a marked absolutive should n't be too far-fetched since marked nominative exists . 
  wikipedia lists nias , an austronesian language as an example .

  note about foreign names : the way they 're written usually stays the same except for the endings . 
  the pronounciation is butchered according to mutish orthography . 
  the original pronounication is usually completely disregarded . 
   dwe\u0301neh \u2081, 
  what is the etymology of this word ? 
  i presume it 's a cognate to old latin * duenos * ? 
  where do you find your pie roots ? 
  ( e.g wiktionary only lists * dew - ), 
  * 3sg-emphatic due.to [ n - prothesis ] eat-prs-connegative potato-gen-pl fried fat-ess appear-3sg-prs *, 
  * he due to eating of potatoes fried in fat appears *, 
  the adjective * vritig * only exists in the phrase * lemhoda vritig * `` chip '' , `` french fry '' . 
  * it.is.known 1sg-erg all [ weak mutation ] thing-part-pl def [ mixed mutation ] help-benefactive 2sg-gen try-1sg-fut *, 
  * it is known that i all things for the help of you shall try *, 
  the interjection * sna * also means `` it is obvious that ... '' , `` you already know that ... '' , `` it is logical , that ... '', 
   would-do-1, 
  is this a conditional mood , a contraction , or something else ? 
   do-1p . sg-aor . cond all-acc, 
  is this a mistake ? 
  should n't it be the reverse ?

  * immediately he the tools must sharpen , if he work good wants shall work *, 
  yeah , probably . 
  it indicates the knowledge of both the speaker and listener . 
  a related one , ** snape ** / ' \u0283n\u00e6pi / means basically the same thing but it 's a bit rude : `` is n't it obvious that ... '' . 
  in mutish they are technically formed with the adjective-forming suffix * - ig * / i / , but usually , instead of ordinals , the normal cardinals are used . 
  so , f.e :, 
  `` the fifth man '' : ** ag boarh sat ** / ' \u0251 ' \u03b2\u0252 : r 's \u00e6d / * def [ mixed mutation ] man five * , or ** ag boarh satig ** / ' \u0251 ' \u03b2\u0252 : r 's \u00e6ti / * def [ mixed mutation ] fifth *, 
  there is no special abbreviation . 
  the sentence above would just be ** ag boarh 5 **, 
  currently i do n't have many :, 
  ** so ** / 's \u0251 / - `` totally !, 
  '' , `` i was telling you !, 
  '' , `` i knew it ! '', 
  ** tape ** / ` t\u00e6pi / - `` right now ? , i ca n't be bothered , i 'll do it later '', 
   would-do-i . 
  is this just a contraction ?

  could you describe this word in more detail ? 
  how did you derive your word for fries/chips ? 
  ok . do you derive the names of any other vegetables by their shape ? 
  e.g is a banana a `` long fruit '' ?

  the verb * tagezon * / ` t\u00e6jizo : / means `` to matter '' , `` to be important '' . 
  could you give etymologies for those verbs ? 
  i do n't recognise them . 
  ah , cool . 
  how about * edataa * ? 
  for * pys\u00e4hty\u00e4 * , i presume it 's related to * pysy\u00e4 * `` to remain '' , which is a cognate to estonian * p\u00fcsima * . 
  izhorian also has * p\u00fcs\u00e4h\u0165\u00fc\u00e4 * , with the meaning of `` to stop '' .

  although takanaa is n't made to be logical , it 's quite regular . 
  and i would n't call it simple . 
  it 's inspired by japanese though , with its complex honourific system and agglutination .
