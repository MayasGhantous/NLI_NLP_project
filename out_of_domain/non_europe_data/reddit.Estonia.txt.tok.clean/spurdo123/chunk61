  the verb * tagezon * requires an indirect object . 
  something is important to somebody . 
  ** mutuz muzis ** / ` mutus ` muz\u0259s / - * muth-gen-pl land-ess * - `` in the land of the muth '' . 
  although they do n't have any seas , but * vanag * just means `` large body of water '' , so `` in the mountains and also the lakes '' . 
  note about the genitive ordering : this implies inalienable possession , i.e the muth homeland . 
  if you switched the order , it would mean any land the muth have conquered , but not their homeland . 
  how about grammar and vocabulary ? 
  what happens to the word * cunt * ?

  what do your noun cases look like ? 
  for y\u00e9lian :, 
  does * p\u00e8s * mean anything else ? 
  is it only used for the lative sense , or can it be used for indirect objects ? 
  what is * _ pat _ * ? 
  that 's a pretty long copula . 
  why is it marked on the verb ? 
  interesting . 
  the verb ** sealon ** / ' \u0283\u025b : lo : / means `` to lead '' , and `` to be a king '' . 
  normally , it is a transitive verb ; `` to lead who '' , but when it has the meaning `` to be a king '' , it requires an indirect object ; `` to be a king to who '' ( usually just `` to the people '' or `` to us '' when the king is the king of the speaker , but when you want to insult the king you would say `` to the nobles '' . 
  the king himself would say `` to god '' ) . 
  also the verb ** seagon ** / ' \u0283\u025b : jo : / `` to start a war '' . 
  it has to have an indirect object , `` to start a war against who '', 
  although both these verbs have frequentative variants that do n't require any sort of object . 
  ** sealezon ** / ' \u0283\u025b : lizo : / `` to rule '' , `` to lead '' , and ** seagezon ** / ' \u0283\u025b : jizo : / `` to wage war '' . 
  i 've mostly abandoned sernerdas ( a baltic romlang ) , but i still like aspects of it , especially dialects . 
  it was my first conlang , so it has problems . 
  the derivations are still cool , so there are verbs like ** dedainoti ** / ded\u0250i ` nuoti / `` to sing randomly '', 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ( a southern finnic language ) is great . 
  it is a close relative of my native language , estonian , so derivations are always interesting . 
  i really like the 3-way distinctions on adverbs in finnic languages , so for example :, 
  * ** \u010d\u00fcl\u010di\u0161\u00e4 ** / ` t\u0283ylt\u0283i\u0283\u00e6 / `` up against '' ( inessive ), 
  * ** \u010d\u00fcl\u010d\u012b ** / ` t\u0283ylt\u0283i : / `` to up against '' ( illative ), 
  * ** \u010d\u00fcl\u010di\u0161t\u00e4 ** / ` t\u0283ylt\u0283i\u0283t\u00e6 / `` from up against '' ( elative ), 
  although sometimes the derivations do n't match up to the noun cases :, 
  * ** li\u010di ** / ` lit\u0283i / `` near '', 
  * ** li\u010d\u0113 ** / ` lit\u0283e : / `` to near '' ( illative ), 
  * ** li\u010dint\u00e4 ** / ` lit\u0283int\u00e6 / `` from near '' ( exessive ), 
  from the exessive , you would expect `` to near '' to be something like ** li\u010di\u0161\u0161i ** ( the translative ) , and `` near '' to be something like ** li\u010din\u00e4 ** ( the essive ) . 
  for comparison , those adverbs in estonian are :, 
  * ** k\u00fclge ** ( short illative , instead of expected * k\u00fcljesse ), 
  and, 
  * ** ligidal ** ( adessive , contains the element - da - ), 
  * ** ligi ** ( no case ) , or ** ligidale ** ( allative ), 
  also , i should probably update my flair . 
  how about you ? 
  have you dabbled in any a posteriori conlangs ? 
  cool . 
  what branch is it in ? 
  also , a question : why do you have < \u015b  and < \u0107  in your latin alphabet instead of < \u0161  and < \u010d  ? 
  mutish cases : here 's the declension for a noun , which ends with * - h * / \u00d8 / . 
  ( * poarh * meaning `` man '' ), 
  * absolutive : singular : ** poarh ** / ` p\u0252 : r / , plural : ** poarac ** / ` p\u0252r\u00e6g /, 
  * dative : ** poare ** / ` p\u0252 : ri / , p : ** poaruz ** / ` p\u0252rus /, 
  * lative : ** poarib ** / ` p\u0252 : r\u02b2u / , p : ** poaribuc ** / ` p\u0252 : r\u02b2ug /, 
  * comitative : ** poarat ** / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6d / ; p : ** poaratag ** / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6t\u0251 /, 
  * partitive : ** poarat ** / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6d / ; p : ** poarac ** / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6g /, 
  in this case , because the vowel is long , there is no ablaut . 
  in words with short vowels , e.g ** cuth ** / ` kut / `` son '' , the vowel in absolutive singular , and partitive is different . 
  so , e.g the ergative singular of that would be ** cotu ** / ` k\u0251t\u026f / . 
  although ablaut does n't happen to all words with short vowels in the first syllable . 
  e.g ** polu ** / ` p\u0251l\u026f / `` fire '' has no ablaut . 
  closer explanations :, 
  absolutive and ergative are self-evident , but the involuntary experiencer in intransitive sentences is always in the ergative , so compare :, 
  * ** toaju dendedag ** / ` t\u0252 : j\u026f ` de : ji\u025f\u0251 / * 1sg-erg beat-3pl-pst * `` i got beaten up '' ( and did n't like it ), 
  * ** toa dendedag ** / ` t\u0252 : ` de : ji\u025f\u0251 / * 1sg-abs beat-3pl-pst * `` i got myself beaten up '' ( and liked it , or deserved it ), 
  the genitive is quite broad , and besides possession , is used for origin , description , and compounds . 
  the word order indicates , whether the possession is inalienable or alienable :, 
  * ** popoja ag salh ** / ` p\u0251p\u0251j\u00e6 ' \u0251 ' \u0283\u00e6l / * father-gen def [ mixed mutation ] tongue * `` father 's tongue '' - inalienable, 
  * ** ag salh popoja ** / ' \u0251 ' \u0283\u00e6l ` p\u0251p\u0251j\u00e6 / * def [ mixed mutation ] tongue father-gen * `` father 's language '' - alienable, 
  the dative is used for indirect objects , and for movement that implies going towards a location , but not reaching it . 
  the lative is used for movement , that implies reaching the location . 
  the essive is used for states of being , and also `` being somewhere '', 
  the elative is used for `` coming from somewhere '' , `` coming from a state '', 
  the comitative is used for possession ; `` i have x '' is * 1sg-com x be * . 
  it 's also used for instruments and company . 
  the abessive means `` without using x '' , `` not having x '' , `` being x-less '' , and `` without x '' . 
  the benefactive marks the person who is benefitting from the action . 
  e.g `` i gave a flower to the fish for my aunt '' , is ** toaju lulh ag zove toaja hansats suegab . 
  ** * 1sg-erg flower-abs def [ mixed mutation ] fish-dat 1sg-gen aunt-ben give-1sg-perf * . 
  or , in this case it could also mean that the aunt gave the flower to me , to give . 
  the partitive has a few uses . 
  firstly , it 's used for counting , along with classifiers . 
  for example : ** ra airuzt satlupa ** * [ natural/constant classifier ] year-part five.hundred * `` five hundred years '' . 
  it 's also used for saying `` there is x '' : e.g `` there are man '' , or `` men exist '' is ** poarac moazag ** * man-part-pl be-prs-3pl *, 
  i really love big case systems , even though they are quite rare .
