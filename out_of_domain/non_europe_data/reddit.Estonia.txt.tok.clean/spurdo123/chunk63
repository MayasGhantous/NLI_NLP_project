  the diaresis is used in loanwords to indicate an irregular pronounciation . 
  e.g * monumenth * without the diaresis would be pronounced / 'm \u0251numint / at first glance . 
  takanaa is agglutinating but generally words do n't get very long .

  * * - pip - * - suffix for 1st person possessive suffix , multible possessions, 
  * * - \u02b2i - * - suffix for plural, 
  this word is an exception . 
  in casual speech most people would not incorporate * a\u015bu\u015bagatara * `` teacher '' . 
  you could have phonemes that only exist in loanwords . 
  estonian has / \u0283 / , / f / , / \u0292 / , which only occur in loanwords . 
  / \u0292 / is usually pronounced like a lenis / \u0283 / though . 
  and for some , / \u0283 / is just / s\u02b2 / . 
  / f / also tends to be more like / v / . 
  this is more true for older speakers . 
  or you could just approximate them , e.g / l / to something like / w / . 
  the dropping of word-final / r / seems quite common . 
  ** vearsog ** / ` f\u025b : r\u0283\u00f8 / * n. * `` injury '' , `` damage '' , `` accident '', 
  alexander is n't an english name , unless he is borrowing it directly from english , which i find unlikely . 
  where does it have / \u0279\u02b7 / anyway ? 
  * 1sg-com def [ mixed mutation ] opinion important no-3sg-pst . be-pst-connegative [ contraction ] , even.if 3sg-abs live-3sg-pst . 
  def [ mixed mutation ] 3sg-abs debitive [ strong mutation ] die-pst-connegative *, 
  * me with the opinion important was n't , even if he lived . 
  the he had to die . 
  the loanwords with non-native phonemes are new . 
  e.g * fotograafia * ( photography ) , * \u017eelee * ( jelly ?? 
  ) , * \u0161eff * ( chief ) , * \u0161okolaad * ( chocolate ) , * \u017eanr * ( genre ) . 
  there are n't that many of them . 
  older loanes were nativised , so e.g compare german * graf * to estonian * krahv * . 
  coffee is * kohv * . 
  german * fahrt * yields estonian * vaart * ( although it might come from middle low german , where the word was * vart * ) the volume of these loanwords is extremely high . 
  something like 25 % of the total day-to-day vocabulary . 
  ** / ` x\u025b : n ` t\u0252 : j\u00e6d 'm \u0252 : g / - * hunger 1sg-com be-3sg-prs * - `` hunger with me is '',

  here , the verb is dropped ; * veinn * is just a particle indicating the necessative , but in certain phrases the verb is dropped , and only the particle remains . 
  he probably means ipa .

  what does this mean ? 
  could you give some examples of the language ? 
  could you give a gloss , i.e a word-by-word ( or rather , morpheme-by-morpheme ) translation ? 
  most scripts have their own romanisation systems . 
  you should create one . 
  i would suggest as close to the ipa as possible , with no digraphs . 
  a script is a writing system . 
  there are different types ; alphabets ( latin , cyrillic , greek ) , syllabaries ( japanese ) , abugidas ( devanagari - the script many languages of india use ) , abjads ( the script of arabic ) , logographies ( the chinese writing system ; kanji in japanese ) . 
  alphabets write every sound on their own , and make no distinction between vowels and consonants . 
  in syllabaries , every character is a syllable . 
  in abugidas , each character is a consonant + a vowel . 
  e.g \u092a is `` pa '' . 
  the vowel is indicated by changing the character in some tiny way . 
  abjads do n't write vowels . 
  in logographies , every character represents a word or concept . 
  a romanisation is a system that is used for writing another writing system in the latin alphabet ( what we are currently writing in ) . 
  e.g the romanised form of russian * \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e * is * horo\u0161o * ( or * khorosho * , but i dislike that system ) . 
  the ipa is the international phonetic alphabet , a system of writing down , how a word sounds . 
  a digraph is two characters in an alphabet , which when put together , make a different sound than the two characters seperately . 
  e.g `` sh '' in english , is a digraph . 
  takanaa is somewhat similar to japanese , grammatically . 
  it has honourifics , an open-class of pronouns , and is agglutinating . 
  a similar word is the informal female 1st person pronoun : ** \u00fea\u015bi ** / ` t\u02b0a\u0283i / in takanaa , and ** watashi ** / ' \u0270\u1d5da\u0320ta\u0320\u0255i / ( \u308f\u305f\u3057 ) in japanese . 
  ( i 'm not sure if the japanese one was actually feminine ) . 
  i was inspired by the celtic languages with mutish but the consonant mutation systems are nothing alike . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl is an a posteriori finnic conlang , so it is most similar to votic , estonian , livonian , veps , and finnish ( in that order ) . 
  sernerdas is an posteriori baltic conlang , so it is most similar to lithuanian and latvian . 
  lexically , it is very romance . 
  in mutish , `` this '' and `` that '' are just determiners , and not pronouns , with the exception of when they would appear in the absolutive . 
  ** / ` t\u0252 : j\u026f ' \u0283\u025b : m\u00e6 ' \u0283y : ` no : lid / - * 1sg-erg house-abs this like-1sg-prs * `` i like this house '', 
  ** / ` p\u0252 : r\u026f ' \u0283y : ` p\u00e6j\u00e6s ` p\u00e6t\u0251u / - * man-erg this boy-abs kill-3sg-perf * `` this man killed a boy '', 
  and, 
  ** toaju sue nauligt ** / '' t\u0252 : j\u026f ' \u0283y : ' \u0283\u025b : m\u00e6 ` no : lid / - * 1sg-erg this like-1sg-prs * `` i like this '', 
  in takanaa , determiners exist as suffixes :, 
  * ** axatadi ** / ` ak\u02b0atat\u02b2i / * axata-ti * * friend-this * `` this friend '', 
  * ** axatada ** / ` ak\u02b0atat\u02b2a / * axata-da * * friend-that [ medial ] * `` that friend '' ( near you ), 
  * ** axatadu ** / ` ak\u02b0atat\u02b2u / * axata-du * * friend-that [ distal ] * `` that friend '' ( over yonder ), 
  demonstrative pronouns ( * it * , * at * , * ut * - proximal , medial , distal ) exist , but the proximal one is rarely used . 
  the distal one acts as the 3rd person pronoun . 
  yeah , atashi was the one i was thinking of . 
  in estonian , the meaning is almost always `` son '' . 
  it only has the meaning `` boy '' in the form * poja * , which is usually the genitive of * poeg * , but has become a seperate word ; the partitive of * poja * is * poja * , and the partitive of * poeg * is * poega * . 
  `` boy '' is * poiss * , which is derived from * poeg * . 
  also , * poeg * means the offspring of an animal , regardless of gender . 
  `` kitten '' is * kassipoeg * - lit . 
  `` cat 's son '' . 
  open :, 
  * pronouns , nouns , verbs , adverbs , adjectives , honourifics ( to a degree ),
