  question : how many speakers of the language live in neuquen ? 
  how different are the dialects ? 
  also , what do your pronouns look like ? 
  are there any traces of the dual ? 
  the adjective would be :, 
  ** gubal ** / ` k\u02b2up\u02b2al / - derived from * gu * `` a medium amount of something '' , + the location suffix * - ba * [ * gupa * meaning `` the middle or central part of something '' ] , + the adjective suffix * - l * . 
  the noun is easily derived from this :, 
  the verb would be :, 
  ** xawataak ** / k\u02b0awa ` tak / - `` to enforce '' , `` to use force '' , `` to moderate '' , from * xawa * `` might '' , `` power '' , `` force '' , plus the verb forming suffix * - t * plus the infinitive suffix * - aak * . 
  this has a somewhat negative connotation though . 
  ** la\u015bas\u0259\u015b ** / ` la\u0283as\u0259\u0283 / - `` to be peaceful '' , `` to be alright '' , `` to be in good shape '' , usually in the causative ** la\u015bas\u0259l ** / ` la\u0283as\u0259l / would be more positive : `` to keep the peace '' , `` to peacekeep '' , `` to moderate '' , `` to keep everything in check '' . 
  from * la - * `` to become more like x over time '' , + * \u015basa * `` peace '' + the copulative verb forming suffix * - \u015b * . 
  my word is ** to understand ** . 
  do you only have 2 grammatical genders ? 
  i vaguely remember something about semitic or afro-asiatic languages having this .

  my word is ** rich ** ( wealthy ), 
  oh yeah , thanks . 
  yeah , now that you mention it , marking stress on single-syllable words does seem redundant , but it really does n't matter , in my opinion . 
  there are no limits , pretty much . 
  finnic languages have borrowed kinship terms , mostly from baltic languages [ cousin ( in estonian ) , tribe , tribesman , mother ( in finnish ) , sister , brother ) and words for body parts . 
  ( neck , thigh ) . 
  also most words for any sort of technology . 
  ( a very large portion of vocabulary regarding agriculture is germanic . 
  `` to plow '' is one native root i can find . ), 
  also , both words for `` to hunt '' in estonian are loans , from middle low german . 
  finnish has * mets\u00e4st\u00e4\u00e4 * , which is derived from * mets\u00e4 * - forest , which is loaned from baltic . 
  i find this interesting , i wonder what the original word was , and why it was replaced . 
  although i do n't think we 've borrowed any pronouns . 
  regarding u/regrettablenamehere , `` to murder '' was created ex nihilo and `` to conquer '' is germanic ( loaned artificially from finnish though ) . 
  `` violence '' - * v\u00e4givald * is derived from * v\u00e4gi * `` power '' , which is native , and * vald * `` area , parish '' , but originally `` power '' . 
  which is germanic . 
  most violent terms seem to be native . 
  in the early 20th century linguists ( actually , is this the right word ? 
  in estonian - * keelemehed * `` language men '' ) started coining words ( sometimes ex nihilo , sometimes deriving ) and borrowing words from finnish . 
  this was because estonian did n't have any technical or literary vocabulary . 
  i guess it spread through literature . 
  many words were synonyms : * naasma * `` to return '' , vs * tagasi tulema * `` to come back '' . 
  both are used today . 
  some older synonyms are n't used anymore , so it 's the ex nihilo * relv * `` gun '' instead of * s\u00f5jariist * `` war tool '' . 
  and nobody says * uskuma panema * `` to make believe '' , the ex nihilo * veenma * `` to convince '' is used instead . 
  many changes were morphological , so e.g the superlative can be ** k\u00f5ige parem ** - * all-gen good-comparative * or ** parim ** , which was artifically created . 
  today , most people do n't know about these words and do n't notice . 
  * hetk * `` moment '' is just a normal word . 
  you would n't know it was artificially borrowed from finnish . 
  some things did n't catch on though , like * - tet * instead of * - tatud * ( the past passive participle for verbs with the * - ta * suffix ) , and words like * selmet * , which was shortened for * selle asemel et * `` instead of '', 
  a famous linguist was johannes aavik , and if you try to read a text written by him , you wo n't understand a lot of it . 
  he even tried to reverse a soundchange , i mean how cool is that ? 
  the sound change was / o / in the non-first syllable -  / u / . 
  finnish did n't have this , so they have * ilo * `` joy '' , and estonian has * ilu * `` beauty '' . 
  this did n't catch on . 
  he also did stuff with the orthography , like < y  instead of < \u00fc  for / y / . 
  today , only pagans use this . 
  also , many folks on the internet , when < \u00fc  ca n't be typed . 
  mutish has a preposition for the associative plural : ** eic ** / ` e : g / . 
  so , for example ** eic hcarolh ** / ` e : g ` x\u00e6r\u0251l / `` carl and his friends '', 
  takanaa has a special suffix , which is ** - uup ** / ` up / for 1st and 3rd declension nouns , and ** - uuk ** / ` uk / for 2nd declension nouns .
