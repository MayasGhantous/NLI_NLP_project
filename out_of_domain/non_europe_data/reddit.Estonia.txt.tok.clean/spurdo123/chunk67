  so , for example ** xaratuuk ** / k\u02b0a\u0281a ` tuk / - `` xarata and her friends '', 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl does n't mark it in any way . 
  i 'm not sure , probably to be closer to our finnish brothers . 
  estonian syntax specifically was like german ( v2 word order ) , and still is , for the most part . 
  i ca n't say anything about other parts of grammar . 
  relative clauses are formed very similarly to english , but this is probably older indo-european influence . 
  finnish is probably easier to understand for modern estonians , but that 's because of borrowings .

  in mutish , the definite article can be used for pronouns . 
  * def [ mixed mutation ] 3sg and 3sg shop-lat go-3 ( pl ) . perf *, 
  `` he ( that we know ) and he ( that was just introduced ) have gone to a store '' ( and are probably there , but have n't come back ), 
  also , augmentatives are formed by reduplication , which is extremely irregular for monosyllabic words . 
  the augmentative of ** sav ** / ' \u0283\u00e6f / `` fish '' is ** sabsav ** / 's \u0251us\u00e6v / `` big fish '' , `` sea monster '' , but the augmentative of ** sav ** / 's \u00e6f / `` weakness '' , `` loss '' is ** sosav ** / 's \u0251s\u00e6v / `` tragedy '' . 
  the augmentative of ** cninn ** / ` kn\u0259n / `` city '' is ** caninn ** / ` k\u00e6n\u0259n / `` metropolis '' . 
  is this required at all times , or is it only used for e.g emphasis ? 
  i mean , that 's it basically . 
  long vowels come from original diphthongs . 
  the former voiced stops kept the preceding vowel from undergoing a sound shift , which is why it 's / ' \u00e6j\u0251u / , and not / ' \u00e6j\u00e6u / or / ' \u0251j\u0251u / . 
  ( the original pronounciation was / ' \u0251g\u0251b / though ), 
  sure , go ahead . 
  / \u0264 / in estonian , votic , livonian , and v\u00f5ro arose because of the vowel harmony system :, 
  front vowels : / \u00e6 / , / \u00f8 / , / y /, 
  back vowels : / \u0251 / , / o / , / u /, 
  neutral vowels : / e / , / i /, 
  now , / e / lost it 's position as a neutral vowel , and the system became :, 
  front vowels : / \u00e6 / , / e / / \u00f8 / , / y /, 
  back vowels : / \u0251 / , / \u0264 / , / o / , / u /, 
  neutral vowels : / i /, 
  it also arose from / o / , and sometimes / \u0251 / , and in one root / u / in the first syllable , but that 's just a normal soundshift . 
  northern estonian dialects ( basis for standard estonian ) later lost vowel harmony altogether though , but still have / \u0264 / . 
  now , / i / is the one last neutral vowel remaining , and / \u026f / would create a system without it . 
  ( turkish e.g has no neutral vowels , while korean does ), 
  / e / and / \u0264 / exists in the southern finnic languages : votic , v\u00f5ro , livonian . 
  north estonian has it , but does n't have vowel harmony anymore . 
  with the exception of / \u025b / and / \u0254 / , that system is entirely attested . 
  ( finnic languages have / \u00e6 / and / \u0251 / though , not / a / ), 
  very cool . 
  lative and locative , but no ablative/elative bothers me a bit , but that 's just me , 
  the finnic system of allative - adessive - ablative , illative - inessive - elative , and translative - essive - exessive feels really neat to me , and i 've emulated it in my conlangs somewhat . 
  mutish speakers would probably have a hard time learning the orthography , since it 's tradition to butcher all foreign proper nouns and names according to mutish orthography ( which is quirky ) . 
  mutish does n't have / h / , it has / x / instead . 
  also no dental fricatives . 
  so `` happy '' would probably be pronounced / ` x\u00e6p\u0259 / . 
  the / \u014b / in < ng  does n't exist , and neither does / ng / ~ / nk / , so they would probably pronounce it as / n\u0259g / ( except word-finally , where it would just be / n / ) : `` singing '' = / 's \u0259n\u0259g\u0259n /, 
  in terms of grammar , they would probably make mistakes like `` him cried '' , because in mutish , involitional experiencers in intransitive sentences are in the ergative .

  yes , takanaa uses honourifics . 
  they are placed before the name or noun they modify . 
  the traditional list is :, 
  * ** \u0259s ** / ' \u0259s / - standard polite honourific . 
  said between strangers , usually . 
  * ** \u0259k ** / ' \u0259k / - honourific used for people older than you, 
  * ** ak ** / ` ak / - honourific used for people younger than you, 
  * ** \u0259xa ** / ' \u0259k\u02b0a / - honourific used for people of a higher rank than you, 
  * ** ax\u0259 ** / ` ak\u02b0\u0259 / - honourific used for people of a lower rank than you, 
  * ** l\u0259\u015ba ** / ` l\u0259\u0283a / - honourific used for people that you find endearing or cute . 
  very rarely said to heterosexual males . 
  * ** x\u0259\u015bak ** / ` k\u02b0\u0259\u0283ak / - extremely polite honourific, 
  * ** p\u0259k ** / ` p\u0259k / - humble honourific . 
  somewhat self-deprecating, 
  * ** p\u0259kala ** / ` p\u0259kala / - humble female honourific . 
  used by married or taken women . 
  * ** p\u0259kuru ** / ` p\u0259ku\u0281u / - extremely humble honourific . 
  nobody younger than 40 uses this other than for comedic effect . 
  * ** l\u0259 ** / ` l\u0259 / - polite honourific said by males to females, 
  * ** \u0259l\u0259t ** / ' \u0259l\u0259t / - polite honourific said by females to males, 
  * ** fi ** / ` p\u02b0i / - disrespectful honourific . 
  * ** fak ** / ` p\u02b0ak / - very disrespectful honourific . 
  because honourifics are an open class , many nouns can be used in this way , or new honourifics have been derived from nouns :, 
  * ** axat ** / ` ak\u02b0at / - derived from * axata * `` friend '' . 
  used between friends . 
  * ** kaxara ** / ` kak\u02b0a\u0281a / - related to * kaxit * / ` kak\u02b0it / `` war '' , `` battle '' . 
  said to soldiers . 
  * ** kara ** / ` ka\u0281a / - shortened variant of the former . 
  said between soldiers , and some males . 
  * ** kinit ** / ` kinit / - used between nationalists ( both jewish and pagan ) . 
  derived from * kanitu * / ` kanitu / - the folk , the people . 
  * ** kit ** / ` kit / - shortened and more colloquial variant of the former . 
  quite popular in some circles . 
  * ** a\u015bita ** / ` a\u0283ita / - derived from * a\u015butara * `` foreigner '' . 
  used for foreigners , and by some people for atheists , non-pagans , and non-jews . 
  * ** \u015buwa ** / ' \u0283uwa / - another disrespectful honourific . 
  derived from * \u015bulawa * `` traitor '' . 
  often said by nationalist pagans to jews and vice versa . 
  * ** t\u0259 ** / ` t\u0259 / - probably derived from * itt\u0259 * / ` i\u0288\u0259 / `` son '' . 
  said by adults to boys . 
  * ** m\u0259 ** / 'm \u0259 / - probably derived from either * m\u0259nadda * / 'm \u0259na\u0256a / `` daughter '' or * m\u0259m * `` girl '' . 
  said by adults to girls .
