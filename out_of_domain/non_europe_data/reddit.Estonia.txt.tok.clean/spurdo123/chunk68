  the takanaa people live in the westernmost part of the eurasian steppe , north of the caucasus . 
  they have their own state , which is a constitutional monarchy . 
  a bit less than half of takanaa tribes have historically been jewish . 
  this is due to influence from the khazars , who in this conworld adopted judaism quite heavily . 
  around half have been pagan ( the traditional takanaa faith ) , and around 10 % have been of other religions ( muslim , christian , other sects ) . 
  today , in the takanaa state , the percentages are more like 60 % -37 % -3 % . 
  many jews have immigrated to israel . 
  also , atheism has become popular , and many urban folk are `` culturally pagan '' , or `` culturally jewish '' , depending on what tribe their roots are from . 
  intermarriages have traditionally been rare . 
  animosity between the two groups has traditionally been high , the tribes were never under one ruler , but due to growing influence of the russian state in the 17th-18th centuries the takanaa tribes banded together to fight the russians . 
  that political alliance has lasted until today ( loose confederacy under one king , which has slowly become more centralised ) , but socially , things are more complicated . 
  no , it 's a language isolate . 
  it 's similar to tengriism in some aspects , like horse sacrificing , but is mostly independent . 
  ( i have n't worked out the religion fully yet ), 
  pronounciation would be tough . 
  / y : / especially , and / \u0259 / in stressed positions . 
  consonant mutation . 
  so , it 's ** ag hjimh ** / ' \u0251 ' \u029d\u0259m / , and not * ag himh * / ' \u0251 ` x\u0259m / `` the male cousin '' . 
  ergative-absolutive alignment , and the fact that involuntary experiencers in intransitive sentences are in the ergative . 
  the difference between the dative and the lative ( dative implies going towards somewhere , lative implies reaching it ), 
  the antipassive , and when to use it . 
  it basically implies that the action was only partially done or attempted . 
  monosyllabic words take ablaut , which is irregular , mostly . 
  some monosyllabic words do n't take ablaut , like * tod * / ` t\u0251 / `` fat '' , `` grease '' . 
  all the prepositions . 
  although the mutation that they trigger is usually regular , with the exception of the definite article * ag * / ' \u0251 / , which triggers the mixed mutation , but prepositions ending in vowels usually trigger the weak mutation .

  an alternate version for `` hello '' would be ** ave ** / ` ave / or ** aue ** / ` aue / ~ / ` awe / but it 's only used in the military and sounds really official or formal . 
  the second is a dialectal variant . 
  most people just say ** labas ** / ` l\u00e4v\u00e4s / , which is baltic . 
  in many dialects , ** labs ** / ` l\u00e4bz / ~ / ` l\u00e4ps /, 
  you could use ** populos ** / ` puopulus / `` population '' instead of * liaud\u0113s * , but it 's uncommon . 
  so , ** kalbianti maknus \u016bm\u0101nus populos ** / kal\u02b2 ` b\u02b2\u00e4n\u02b2t\u02b2i 'm \u00e4knus u : 'm \u00e4 : nus ` puopulus / - * speak-3pl . prs big-n human-n population.n *, 
  ** oxes ** / ` uokses / `` this '' ( masculine , neuter ) is derived from latin * hoc * / ` hok / + the emphatic * - es * . 
  which then underwent loss of initial / h / -  / ` okes / -  / ` oks / -  / ` uoks / . 
  then the emphatic * - es * was added again : -  / ` uokses / . 
  in some dialects more sound changes happened : -  / ` wokses / -  / ` vok\u0283is / -  / ` vok\u0283 / -  / ` vo\u0283 /, 
  noun cases , the more the merrier . 
  regular initial stress, 
  lots of diphthongs, 
  good old nominative-accusative alignment , maybe with a touch of marked nominative . 
  fusion , with little agglutination as possible .

  while mutish is base 12 , it is base 10 for numbers higher than 100 ( * sotiz * / 's \u0251d\u0259s / still refers to 144 though , while * lupa * / ` lup\u00e6 / is 100 . 
  * capanh * / ` k\u00e6p\u00e6n / , which is `` 8 twelves '' , so 96 , can also refer to 100 ) .

  yes . 
  estonian uses these often :, 
  `` lord god '', 
  `` may heaven come to help '' . 
  hard to translate . 
  * * jumala * - this means `` very '' , but lit . 
  `` god 's '', 
  `` from the front of god '' , or `` from god '' , or `` for god '' . 
  more or less translates to `` please '' . 
  said before a phrase , e.g * jumala eest , \u00e4ra tee * - `` please , do n't do it '', 
  the estonians are the most atheistic people in the western world . 
  christianity never took a hold , but these phrases still became popular . 
  we do n't have any references to jesus though . 
  it 's unlikely that these phrases are very old , since estonian paganism does n't have a pantheon , although it has a few figures that are like gods : uku , taara , etc.

  finnic tribes at this time most likely said something like ** koira ** , although the years are unclear . 
  ** peni ** was also a synonym , which in modern finnic languages is the same , except for v\u00f5ro , where it is ** pini ** .
