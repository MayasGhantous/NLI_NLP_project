  consonant mutation ( lenition in this case ) : / n / -  / \u014b / -  / j / . 
  < nh  is just a way of representing that in writing . 
  finnish and estonian do , but not sure about other uralic languages . 
  hungarian uses the dative . 
  not every phoneme ; voiced stops are never geminated . 
  there is a `` bare infinitive '' in mutish , but it 's only in dictionaries and is not used on its own . 
  the ending is usually * - n * ( a long vowel ) , more rarely a voiceless stop , and sometimes a voiced stop , there are 2 other infinitives , that are formed from this `` bare infinitive '' ( or `` 1st infinitive '' ) :, 
  2nd infinitive :, 
  ** at ** / ' \u00e6d / + the bare infinitive , triggers the mixed mutation in the initial consonant of the bare infinitive . 
  this is the verbal noun , basically the gerund . 
  e.g : ** sealon ** / ' \u0283\u025b : lo : / `` to lead '' -  ** at zealon ** / ' \u00e6d ' \u0292\u025b : lo : / `` leading '' , `` leadership '' . 
  this inflects like a noun , so what is known as the supine ( e.g `` i came here to run '' ) is formed as the 2nd infinitive in the benefactive case , or alternatively , with the verb in the future , and in the corresponding person : `` i came here i shall run '' . 
  3rd infinitive :, 
  ** ann ** / ' \u00e6n / + the bare infinitive , triggers the nasal mutation in the initial consonant of the bare infinitive . 
  this translates to `` the one who has x-ed '' , and `` having x-ed '' , so : ** ann nsealon ** / ' \u00e6n : \u0283\u025b : lo : / `` the one who has led '' ( a noun ) and `` having led '' ( an adverb ) . 
  sort of like a participle . 
  ** ta\u015butunat ** / ` ta\u0283utunat / `` plains/steppe spirit '', 
  ** cairebh ** / ` k\u00e6 : riv / * n. * `` glass '' ( as in the material ), 
  ** na ** / ` n\u0251 / * n. * `` fruit '', 
  and so are all finnic languages . 
  the eastern ones ( votic , veps , izhorian etc ) do n't have that newest germanic layer of borrowings ( swedish in finnish , low and high german in estonian and livonian ) , they have lots of russian borrowings . 
  contact with the proto-germanic and proto-norse speaking peoples was very intensive . 
  contact with balts was even higher , so we borrowed weird words like `` sister '' , `` cousin '' , and `` tribe '' from them . 
  what do your cases look like ? 
  the lative is interesting , it 's only seen in adverbs in finnish .

  * you priests pieces into beat , grab lands , and gather money some *, 
  is that a * - k * infinitive ? 
  what is the 1st person plural present of your copula ? 
  in proto-finnic it 's * olekmek * or * olekmak * , which i find really cool . 
  yeah . 
  the proto-finnic * - k * infinitive is a vowel in all the finnic languages except for v\u00f5ro , where it is * - q * ( a glottal stop ) . 
  it 's just a cool sound , imo . 
  and v\u00f5ro has * saistaq * for this verb , so it might be * sais - * . 
  ( wiktionary lists ** saistak * ), 
  cool . 
  that 's pretty big variation between dialects , you have both the finnish * olemme * and estonian * oleme * in there , lol . 
  votic has * \u00f5\u00f5mm\u00f5 * and veps has * olem * , though . 
  very cool .

  them on are brains and conscience and to must to act brotherly their . 
  very cool . 
  i do love me some declension tables . 
  why do you list the ergative first though ? 
  the unmarked case is usually the first . 
   the ergative case works a bit more like the nominative case, 
  what do you mean by this ? 
  the ergative usually marks the subject of a transitive verb , unless you have split ergativity or mark something else by it . 
  well yeah , intransitive verbs are where that difference becomes apparent .

  * [ reduplicated augmentative ] thanks , 1sg-com this necessative [ nasal mutation ] be-perf . connegative *, 
  * thanks so much , me with this had to be *, 
  * pultuz * `` thanks '' is derived from ** puelton ** / ` py : lto : / `` to praise '' , `` to thank '', 
  thanks . 
  is there any way to prevent them running out of organisation ? 
  estonian ** eit ** , which is a cognate to finnish * \u00e4iti * , means `` hag '' , `` old woman '' , and in colloquial language `` girlfriend '', 
  that 's meaningless . 
  they do n't speak estonian and live in their own bubble . 
  they came here illegally under an occupation . 
  seems like immigrants to me . 
  are you claiming that a very large portion of estonians are `` racist '' ? 
  ( this opinion is the norm ) . 
  how about dialects and related languages ? 
  the comparative method is imo much more fun than internal reconstruction . 
  immigrants skew the results for latvia and estonia . 
  whatever . 
  no point in arguing with non-estonians . 
  you wo n't understand . 
  russians are still caucasian , albeit usually much darker than estonians ( many of the russians here are from ukraine , the caucasus etc , not from northern russia , where the people look similar to us ) . 
  the correct term is xenophobia , not racism , but it does n't really matter .
