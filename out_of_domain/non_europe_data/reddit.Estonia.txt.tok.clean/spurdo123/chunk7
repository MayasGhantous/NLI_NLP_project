  yes i know , my native language is estonian . 
  in this instance , `` vot '' was borrowed into estonian from russian , that 's what i 'm saying . 
  * ray * . 
  ray , if somebody ask [ 3rd person singular ] if you be [ 2nd person singular present ] a god [ mixed declension nominative singular ] you say [ 2nd person imperative future ] , yes, 
  note : `` un diev '' is using the indefinite article . 
  without it it would be `` dievas '' . 
  this is a dialectal feature that is not required or baked into the language itself . 
  `` maa '' being of indo-aryan origin is just a theory , and is n't fact . 
  art ox fant\u00e1sias est ? 
  * this real life be [ 3rd person singular ] ? 
  or this fantasy be [ 3rd person singular ] ? 
  i used sov order , but the word order is free otherwise . 
  in written language , the word '' \u00e1 '' or '' \u00e1es '' / a : / - / a : es / ~ / a : is / can be used for general questions . 
  in spoken language , questions are formed by intonation and tone , or sometimes the word '' \u00e1 '' aswell , when necessary . 
  it does n't inflect in any way . 
  - es adds emphasis . 
  `` are you the man ? '', 
  - '' \u00c1 tu iest la m\u00fana ? 
  '' , which in spoken language would be `` tu ` st la m\u00fana ? '', 
  if the word `` are '' is emphasised , then it would be '' \u00c1es tu iest la m\u00fana ? '', 
  note : in estonian dialects , `` k\u00f5iv '' exists as a synonym , meaning birch . 
  in finnish dialects , `` kaski '' exists meaning `` young birch '' or `` young broadleaf forest '', 
  war no-decide [ 3rd person singular present ] who be [ 3rd person singular ] right , only who remain [ 3rd person singular ], 
  this is the meaning in finnish and other languages such as veps and izhorian . 
  ** erg nos pugniki in let acpalvet . 
  / ` nuostrum ru 'd \u0268klei in ` fuskerisi lum ` suolum erg ` nuos pug ` niki in let ats ` palvet /, 
  * we [ genitive ] arrow [ plural ] darken [ future simple 3rd person plural ] the [ neuter accusative ] sun [ weak declension accusative ] *, 
  * then we fight [ future simple 1st person plural ] in the [ locative ] shade [ weak declension locative ] *, 
  in terms of cases :, 
  * - as - marks the singular nominative case of ( common gender ) nouns, 
  * - am - marks the singular accusative case of ( common gender ) nouns, 
  * - an - marks the singular genitive case of ( common gender ) nouns, 
  * - at - marks the singular locative case of ( common gender ) nouns, 
  * - u - marks the singular dative case of ( common gender ) nouns, 
  * - e - marks the singular vocative case of a small number of nouns , and also those ending in consonant clusters . 
  ( singular vocative is usually unmarked ) . 
  e.g the vocative of `` tevynas '' ( fatherland ) is n't the regular `` tevyn '' , but `` tevyne '', 
  the inflection of neuter gender nouns and adjectives , and the inflection when dealing with articles is too complicated to sum up here . 
  others :, 
  * - is - used for adjectives . 
  e.g `` g\u00fatis '' is `` good '' as an adjective , but `` g\u00fatas '' is `` good '' as a noun . 
  `` g\u00fat '' is the vocative both as an adjective and as a noun . 
  adjective declension is similar to noun declension , but with `` i '' instead of `` a '' , but the dative ending is '' - ur '', 
  * - ( yt ) ius - used for the infinitive of verbs, 
  * - niumas - used for a collection of something, 
  * - at\u00f3ras - used for agents , e.g `` lignas '' - `` forest '' , `` lignat\u00f3ras '' - `` woodcutter '' or `` forester '', 
  * - ias - used for forming a noun from a verb/adjective if the noun is only somewhat related to it . 
  e.g `` gim\u00e9sius '' - `` to give birth '' , `` gim\u00e9sas '' - `` birth '' ( as in the event ) , `` gim\u00e9sias '' - `` birthday '', 
  * - ul - forms adverbs, 
  i only have one circumfix , which marks the conditional mood . 
  it is `` b ( e ) - ( verb ) - ( i/y ) k '' for 1st person singular . 
  e.g the 1st person singular conditional of `` to work '' ( lab\u00f3rius ) is `` be ` lab\u00f3ryk '' . 
  the ending is the same as the future simple tense . 
  earlier on , i used to have more of these , e.g all of the perfect tenses were marked by circumfixes , but i later dropped them as they seemed sort of clumsy . 
  in terms of noun prefixes , some of the shorter locative prepositions can sort of `` fuse onto '' the word . 
  e.g `` against you '' is `` ot tuta '' in the correct , longer form , but `` o'tuta '' in the more common and casual way . 
  verbs however have many prefixes . 
  `` e - '' means the action is done completely , or throughout . 
  e.g `` fagerius '' means `` to do '' , but `` efagerius '' means `` to complete '' . 
  `` a - '' and `` ob - '' form antonyms . 
  all ( most ) of the locative prepositions can become prepositions to intransitive verbs . 
  e.g '' \u00edtius '' - `` to go '' , '' \u00edtius ib d\u00famat '' , `` to go to the house '' ( use of the locative in this sense , the `` ib '' or `` i '' preposition is n't used ) , but `` ib\u00edtius '' as an intransitive verb means `` to go on '', 
  plosives : < p b t d k g  nasals : < m n  affricates : < ts dz t\u0161 d\u017e  fricatives : < f v \u00fe \u00f0 s z \u0161 \u017e c \u0107 , 
  approximants : < l r  other : < h q , 
  something like this . 
  question : is the / ts / sequence different from the / ts / affricate or are they the same in your conlang ?

  * and so the penny ( weak declension nominative ) fall [ 3rd person singular present ] *, 
  ehh , technically ? 
  it 's a posteriori . 
  the vocabulary is mostly from latin and lithuanian , with tiny bits of russian , english and estonian . 
  most of the basic words like `` and '' , `` so '' and all the relative clauses are from latin . 
  but there are a lot of lithuanian words scattered around . 
  e.g the verb `` padenet '' ( padenius ) in that sentence is from the lithuanian `` padengti '' , meaning `` to cover '' , although my verb means `` to fall '' or `` to drop '' . 
  this was one of my earlier words , so i do n't remember how i got this meaning . 
  i made the grammar largely up myself , and it looks quite indo-european . 
  although certain elements were borrowed . 
  e.g - l for past simple ( only 1st person in my conlang ) was borrowed from russian . 
  and the passive voice is formed very similarly to estonian ( to be + certain participle ), 
  in terms of phonology , `` o '' being / u / unstressed was sort of influenced by my native language estonian , where in the spoken language this is a somewhat common change . 
  `` o '' being / uo / stressed was influenced by latvian , where it is something like / ua\u032f / . 
  small sample of vocabulary : ** kau sieme , sik m\u00edtul oulderes , tu d\u00edtami na rokaite **, 
  * kau - `` how '' , from latin `` quam '', 
  * sieme - `` land '' , from lithuanian '' \u017eem\u0117s '' ( regular \u017e , \u0161 -  sj/si ), 
  * sik - `` so '' , from latin `` sic '', 
  * m\u00edtul - `` gentle '' , from latin `` mitis '', 
  * oulderes - `` to hold '' , from english `` holder '' ( the noun `` holder '' came before the verb ), 
  * tu - `` you '' , from latin/lithuanian `` tu '', 
  * d\u00edtami - `` children '' , from russian '' \u0434\u0438\u0442\u044f '' ( ditja ), 
  * na - `` on '' , from russian '' \u043d\u0430 '' ( na ) ( i took many prepositions from russian ), 
  * rokaite - `` hands '' , originally from russian '' \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430 '' ( ruka ) , but i changed / u / -  / uo / in influence of latvian `` roka '', 
  for certain prefixes , the apostrophe is used to seperate it from the word :, 
  * b ( e ) - marks the conditional mood , e.g `` i would speak '' - `` be ` kalbyk '' . 
  * n ( e ) - marks negation . 
  e.g `` i am not '' - `` n'esm '' or `` ne ` sem '' . 
  note : for the conditional negative , the negation is written without a apostrophe . 
  e.g `` i would n't speak '' is `` ne be ` kalbyk '' , not `` ne ` be ` kalbyk '',
