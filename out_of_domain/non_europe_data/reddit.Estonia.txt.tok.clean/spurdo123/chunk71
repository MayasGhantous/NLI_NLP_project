  phonologically very innovative . 
  palatalisation is rampant . 
  pie * - os * ending is just * - s * . 
  uses clitics a lot , e.g to indicate the future .

  western :, 
  grammatically very innovative . 
  usually 2-4 cases : nominative , accusative , genitive , prepositional , with acc and gen sometimes fusing , and sometimes acc and prep fusing . 
  has had a lot of influence from german , mostly in terms of vocabulary . 
  the influence on the standard language is in vocabulary , mostly.the pie - os ending is missing , or in a few cases , - s. uses contractions , but not as much as the eastern dialects . 
  uses idioms a lot , which is not the case in most dialects .

  :d sounds like `` dick-area '' ( * k\u00fcrb * in estonian , * kyrp\u00e4 * in finnish , * t\u0161\u00fcrp\u00e4 * in votic all mean `` cock '' , and * - la * is a suffix that means `` area '' . ), 
  preserving the weak-grade / \u03b2 / , / \u00f0 / , / \u0263 / is quite cool . 
  estonian has / v / , / j / , and / \u00d8 / for this series . 
  in votic : * lat\u0161i * -  * lag\u00f5 * ], 
  mutish does n't have noun classes nor does it have gendered pronouns or anything like that . 
  it does have determiners and pronouns based on animacy though . 
  there 's even a 2nd person inanimate pronoun , which evolved from poetic use out of the old vocative . 
  in day-to-day speech you 'd use it to talk to the water for good luck in fishing , for example . 
  it 's also found use in insults , when addressing people . 
  inanimate determiners :, 
  * `` this '' : ** sue ** / ' \u0283y : /, 
  * `` that '' : ** cue ** / ` ky : /, 
  animate determiners :, 
  * `` this '' : ** bau ** / ` bo : /, 
  * `` that '' : ** nau ** / ` no : /, 
  using inanimate determiners for people is insulting . 
  e.g ** croat sue ** / ` kr\u0252 :d ' \u0283y : / `` this cunt '' , instead of ** croat bau ** / ` kr\u0252 :d ` bo : / `` this chap '' . 
  inanimate pronouns :, 
  * 3rd person singular : ** nea ** / ` n\u025b : / ( stressed ) , ** ni ** / ` n\u0259 / ( unstressed ), 
  * 3rd person plural : ** noava ** / ` n\u0252 : v\u00e6 /, 
  * 2nd person singular : ** seaso ** / ' \u0283\u025b : s\u0251 / ( stressed ) , ** seas ** / ' \u0283\u025b : z / ( unstressed ), 
  * 2nd person plural : ** seavas ** / ' \u0283\u025b : v\u00e6z /, 
  animate pronouns :, 
  * 3rd person singular : ** ceann ** / ` k\u025b : n / ( stressed ) , ** cea ** / ` k\u025b : / ( unstressed ), 
  * 3rd person plural : ** ceanag ** / ` k\u025b : n\u0251 / , ** ceava ** / ` k\u025b : v\u00e6 / ( just synonyms ), 
  * 2nd person singular : ** sea ** / ' \u0283\u025b : / ( stressed ) , ** si ** / 's \u0259 / ( unstressed ), 
  * 2nd person plural : ** toag ** / ` t\u0252 : / ( happens to be pronounced the same as the 1st person singular unstressed pronoun - * toa * ) , ** seava ** / ' \u0283\u025b : v\u00e6 / ( just synonyms ), 
  also an interesting distinction : `` to go '' for inanimate objects is ** pilon ** / ` p\u0259lo : / , which also means `` to burn '' , while `` to go '' for animate things is ** agusn ** / ' \u00e6jus : /, 
  wait , nominative , accusative , ergative , ** and ** absolutive ? 
  how do you use those ? 
  tripartite languages make 3 distinctions and do n't have a nominative . 
  i do n't see how you could make 4 . 
  or do you have some weird form of split ergativity ? 
  estonian is fusional for the core cases ( nom , gen , part ) , yes . 
  it 's also lost possessive suffixes and you wo n't find any long non-compound words . 
  the sami languages are also apparently fusional , iirc . 
  the uralic languages are also probably the closest languages to the ie family , in all senses . 
  true . 
  it 's colloquial , but it 's really commonly used in day-to-day speech this way . 
  ** eilvun ** / ` e : lvu : / * v. * `` to court '' , `` to go to have sex '' ; `` to fuck '' , `` to have sex '', 
  ** vaimtt ** / ` f\u00e6 : mt / * v. * `` to grow up '' , `` to mature '' ( for humans ),
