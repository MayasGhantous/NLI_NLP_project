  the letter < j  is ** a\u0161taz i ** , which means `` short i '' . 
  ( calque of russian * \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0435 * ), 
  the alternative pronounciation of < david  would be / ` teivit / . 
  ** petersoni ** is already a known surname , so the pronounciation of < peterson  becomes that . 
  could anyone who speak finnish be kind enough to translate this sentence ? 
  in estonian we can say `` to believe in something '' like english ( with the illative ) , but i 'm not sure if this is just german/english influence or something . 
  usually it 's just the partitive , though . 
  sure , that 's cool . 
  japanese does it . 
  \u3042\u305f\u3057 ( atashi ) is feminine , while \u4ffa ( ore ) is masculine . 
  ( and informal ) . 
  my conlang , takanaa has 4 sets of feminine and masculine 1st person pronouns ( informal , semi-formal , formal , humble ) . 
  also a gender-neutral one for each set . 
  there 's also variants , like ** tuk ** / ` tuk / instead of ** \u00feuk ** / ` t\u02b0uk / for the masculine informal , and ** ta\u015b ** / ` ta\u0283 / instead of ** \u00fea\u015bi ** / ` t\u02b0a\u0283i / for the feminine informal . 
  plural ones are only gender-neutral . 
  2nd person and 3rd person pronouns do n't have any gender distinctions . 
  2nd person pronouns change for formality/humbleness , while 3rd person pronouns do n't do any of these . 
  ( the 3rd person pronoun is simply the distal determiner ), 
  not related , but closest in terms of features and vocabulary ( lots of borrowings from ie languages in uralic languages , some are very early ), 
  i think you 've got your terminology mixed up . 
  what 's an `` intransitive object '' ? 
  a do you mean some kind of adverb ? 
  in mutish they 're inalienable . 
  when alienable , it would mean `` someone else 's urine you keep in a jar '' ( think jarate in tf2 ), 
  and i do n't see how this is inappropriate at all . 
  intransitive verbs are defined by the fact that they do n't have direct objects . 
  could you give an example of what you mean ? 
  do you mean indirect objects ? 
  ( this case is usually called the dative if it does n't fill any other purpose ), 
  i 'll check it out . 
  i do n't like that it 's on facebook , but i have an alt . 
  edit : request sent . 
  cool idea . 
  i 've made a baltic conlang and i know some russian , but i do n't understand a single word . 
  native speakers of the aforementioned languages would probably have a better time . 
  from first glance , / \u00f0 / , / \u00e6 / , and / \u0153 / are all strange . 
  russian has / \u00e6 / as an allophone , but i 'm not sure about the rest . 
  / \u026a / and / \u028c / are odd too . 
  * `` unbelievable '', 
  ** voacan ** / ` f\u0252 : k\u0251 : / * v. * `` to shout '' , `` to cry '' , `` to want '' , `` to desire '' ( negative style variety ), 
  * `` today '', 
  well , to give an example from natlangs :, 
  proto-samoyedic had it , but with some weird exceptions ( * k\u00e5l\u00e4 - `` fish '' , compare finnic `` kala '' ), 
  * khanty lost it, 
  * western mansi lost it, 
  proto-samic lost it, 
  * north estonian lost it, 
  * veps has it in a limited form, 
  mari has it, 
  * komi-zyrian and komi-yodzyak may have it ??? 
  ( uncertain ), 
  proto-mordvinic has it, 
  small correction : only north estonian lost vowel harmony . 
  south estonian and votic still have it . 
  ( with / e / being a front vowel and not neutral , and / \u0264 / a back vowel ) . 
  ** hoaron ** / ` x\u0252 : ro : / * v. * `` to fib '' , `` to lie '' , `` to tell tales '' ; `` to tell '' ( unreliably ), 
  oh , yes , livonian too . 
  it 's lost consonant gradation aswell , like veps , which has a limited system of vowel harmony . 
  ( compare veps ** pimedan ** to finnish ** pime\u00e4n ** and estonian ** pimeda ** - `` dark-gen '' ), 
  south estonian has a number of isoglosses that are really archaic . 
  v\u00f5ro has a glottal stop , < q  , which descends from proto-finnic word-final * k. all the other finnic languages have a vowel . 
  so compare :, 
  * estonian : ** elada ** ( notice the lost vowel harmony ), 
  * finnish : ** el\u00e4\u00e4 ** ( notice the lost intervocalic `` d '' ), 
  * v\u00f5ro : ** ell\u00e4q ** ( vowel harmony , glottal stop at the end ), 
  also , some proto-finnic clusters have unique correspondences in south estonian :, 
  proto-finnic * lapci ( laptsi ) `` child '', 
  * estonian : ** laps ** ( notice the apocope ), 
  * v\u00f5ro : ** lats ' ** ( notice the apocope , shared with north estonian and veps ), 
  probably does n't have to do much with neighbouring influence . 
  finnic has a lot of ie influence , it 's perfect tenses were e.g modelled after germanic/baltic languages ( `` to be '' + participle ) . 
  also a huge influence on vocabulary . 
  some kinship terms , terms for most technologies , etc were borrowed . 
  ** potach ** / ` p\u0251t\u00e6k / - * n. * `` argument '' , `` quarrel '', 
  ** \u0107airunn ** / ` t\u0283\u00e6 : run / * n. * `` arrow '', 
  estonian : ** keegi ** , derived from * kes * `` who '' , which is from proto-finnic `` ken '' + * - gi * `` even '' , `` too '' , which is from proto-finnic * - kin . 
  artifcial borrowings from finnish ( non-technical vocabulary , mostly ) . 
  some grammatical forms are also ex-nihilo , e.g the * i * superlative : ** parim ** instead of ** k\u00f5ige parem ** `` the best '' . 
  today both are used , the second one is glossed * all-gen better * . 
  also many derivations , which is probably the case for almost all literary languages . 
  long vowels were only diphthongised in central estonian dialects , and the standard language is based on this . 
  this change was regular and for all vowels in dialects , so ** moa ** or ** mua ** `` land '' , ** kiel ** `` language '' , ** kuok ** `` cake '' etc. 
  but in the standard language we say ** maa ** , ** keel ** , ** kook ** . 
  the / \u00e6 : / -  / e\u0251 / shift is irregular in the standard language aswell : ** pea ** `` head '' , but ** r\u00e4\u00e4kima ** `` to speak '' , and not * reakima * . 
  the older form was / \u00e6 : / ; the partitive plural of ** hea ** is ** h\u00e4id ** . 
  compare the partitive plural of ** luu ** `` bone '' : ** luid ** . 
  the word ** h\u00e4\u00e4 ** is still an accepted word in the standard language , and is used in some contexts . 
  but i personally , in day-to-day speech always say * hea * . 
  ( actually more like * ea * , with h-dropping ), 
  ** paines ** / ` p\u00e6 : niz / * n. * `` rope '', 
  * `` old '' ( for humans ), 
  * `` fat '' , `` rich '' , `` well-off '', 
  ** t\u00f6\u00f6l\u00e4\u00e4ne ** / ` t\u00f8 : l\u00e6 : ne / * n. * `` worker '',
