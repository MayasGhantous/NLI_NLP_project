  it 's always interesting how spoken finnish is so innovative , while written standard finnish is so conservative ( the most conservative finnic language , in most areas . 
  veps and estonian preserve weak-grade consonants better , estonian preserves long vowels better , votic has a more archaic negative verb , v\u00f5ro preserves pf word final / k / , as a glottal stop , v\u00f5ro and karelian preserve pf word final / h / , but in everything else , finnish is more conservative ), 
  estonian does n't do this . 
  9 is * \u00fcheksa * , which might become * \u00fceksa * in fast speech , but that 's it . 
  spoken finnish also does things like * tule * -  * tuu * and * olen * -  * oon * . 
  in estonian , it 's always * tule * and * olen * , no matter what . 
  ** suerh ** / ` sy : r / * n. * `` something that is useless or worthless '', 
  that 's just a transitive object , which would be in the accusative in nom-acc languages , in the absolutive in erg-abs languages , and in the accusative in tripartite languages ( where the transitive subject is in the ergative and the intransitive subject is in the absolutive ), 
  there are exceptions of course , with experiencers and whatnot , and with active-stative languages . 
  sernerdas has the following terms :, 
  * ** omosexualistas ** / umuseksua ` lis\u02b2tas / - very formal and medical . 
  used for both gays and lesbians . 
  * ** pederastas ** / pede ` ras\u02b2tas / - colloquial , somewhat vulgar . 
  sometimes used as an insult . 
  only used for gays . 
  often used as an insult . 
  for gays only . 
  * ** p\u012bder ** / ` pi : der / - very vulgar . 
  - r stem variant of the above, 
  * ** geias ** / ` gejas / - colloquial , but not vulgar . 
  used by gays themselves , mostly . 
  no real connotations . 
  [ note : a woman from lesbos is ** lesboneit\u0113 ** / les\u02b2bu ` neite : / ], 
  very formal and medical . 
  somewhat colloquial . 
  the formal term would be ** eteros ** / ` eterus / . 
  a slang slur of sorts is ** karelasis ** / k\u00e4re ` l\u00e4sis / , lit . 
  `` the blue one '' ; pronominal form of * karelis * / k\u00e4 ` relis / `` blue '' ( azure to be precise ), 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , spoken by a man :, 
  * if 1sg to.take.as.a.wife-1sg . prs random-part european.person-part , how big be-3sg . prs chance , that.rel 3sg be-3sg . subj foreign ? 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , spoken by a woman :, 
  * if 1sg go-1sg . prs man-ess random-all european.person-all , how big be-3sg . prs chance , that.rel 3sg be-3sg . subj foreign ? 
  the verb ** n\u0101da ** / ` n\u0251 : \u00f0\u0251 / `` to take as a wife '' , `` to marry a woman '' , is related to the noun ** n\u0101n\u00f5 ** / ` n\u0251 : n\u0264 / `` woman '' , `` wife '' . 
  in finnish , the verb * naida * refers to all genders , but in estonian , * naida * is only used for women , like in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl . 
  the adjective ** lu\u010dan\u00f5 ** / ` lut\u0283\u0251n\u0264 / is a loan from russian * \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0439 * . 
  thanks !, 
  takanaa 's native script has a symbol that looks like the latin capital z. 
  it 's placed at the end of a line , and basically corresponds to the semicolon , it seperates thoughts . 
  takanaa 's script also marks questions much like spanish , with one symbol at the beginning of the sentence and another one at the end . 
  there are no punctuation marks besides that . 
  [ an example of a question ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4ffwx5d.png ) [ i forgot what the sentence actually is , and i ca n't be arsed to check it ], 
  in the latin alphabet , takanaa uses all the normal punctuation marks , and also uses \u00bf ? , although this is optional ( formal texts in the latin script will always use it though ) . 
  what is z in the native script is the semicolon in the latin script . 
  well , it 's a baltic conlang spoken in modern-day latvia , lithuania , belarus , kaliningrad , and parts of poland and ukraine . 
  it was my first conlang so it 's not very good . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://docs.google.com/document/d/14s-mty2zn7kuxelxmihkennpb0lfrriyg794j8z5040/edit?usp=sharing ) an old unfinished doc about it . 
  it should be correct though .

  the diaresis is a diacritical mark that only appears in loanwords , that marks a certain vowel , and marks the stress . 
  e.g ** ped\u00e4nth ** / pi ` j\u0251nt / `` pedant '' , when written as * pedanth * , would be pronounced / ` pij\u0251 : t / , or / ` pij\u00e6nt /, 
  does your romanisation not use capitalisation ? 
   lithuanian, 
  huh ? 
  that / t\u02b2 / and / \u0250 / do remind me of lithuanian though , lol . 
  also , the etymology of * t\u00f6\u00f6l\u00e4\u00e4ne * is * t\u00f6\u00f6 * / ` t\u00f8 : / `` work '' + * - l\u0101n\u00f5 * / * - l\u00e4\u00e4ne * , an agent suffix . 
  funny how that suffix stayed there in your word . 
  cool . 
  by the way , i find your use of < a\u0304\u0308  and < o\u0304\u0308  really interesting . 
  i purposefully strayed from using those in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , and use < \u00e4\u00e4  and < \u00f6\u00f6  instead , because the stacked diacritics look ugly , in my opinion . 
  the lyrics on wikipedia say :, 
  ( herzeg-bosnia , lika , that is our pride ), 
  but in this version , it is :, 
  ( prigorje and lika , that is our pride ), 
  prigorje is the region near zagreb . 
  the antepenultimate and penultimate lines on wikipedia are :, 
  * za dom i slobodu , ( for home and freedom ), 
  * hrvatskom narodu ( for the croatian nation ), 
  but in this version appear to be :, 
  * zovi , za slobodu ( call , for freedom ), 
  * hrvatskome rodu ( for the croatian kin ), 
  the line :, 
  is also missing . 
  nope . 
  looks a little bit too old , and the colours are too bright . 
  i do n't remember it being that complex aswell . 
  the camera aswell , pretty sure it always stayed in 3rd person behind the player character ( i also do n't remember player characters besides knights , but this was just probably the one i played as ), 
  nope . 
  i 'm intimately familiar with runescape . 
  runescape was never 3d with a camera behind the player character , weird how you would mention it . 
  runescape never had a see-through inventory aswell . 
  nope , it was online . 
  it used adobe shockwave , i think . 
  sorry if i came up as rude . 
  my fault , explaining things like these is really difficult to do accurately . 
  an important fact i forgot initially was that it most likely used adobe shockwave , i 've added this now .

  yes , that 's it !, 
  thank you !, 
  i wonder why i only remember one class though , that 's odd . 
  the colours seem more vibrant from pictures too . 
  why is kirbla marked in estonia ? 
  some random village in the middle of nowhere . 
  j\u00fcri uluots , the estonian prime-minister-in-the-duties-of-the-president at the time was born there , though . 
  interesting nonetheless .
