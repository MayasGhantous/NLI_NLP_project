  this is accomplished by a very deep orthography . 
  and some vowels only appear in certain situations ( e.g / \u026f / and / \u00f8 / only occur word-finally . 
  / \u00f8 / could be considered an allophone of / o / ) . 
  there are the letters < \u00e4  / \u0251 / , < \u00eb  / e / , < \u00ef  / i / , < \u00f6  / o / , and < \u00fc  / u / , though , that only appear in loanwords . 
  they also indicate stress . 
  so all in all , if the orthography is supposed to be shallow , i would use lots of diacritics . 
  for a deep orthography , i 'd use both .

  20 is considered the number of a devil . 
  20000 is `` a devil 's thousand '' . 
  the beast of / ' \u00e6rs : \u00e6s : \u00e6s : / ( `` in support of me '' ) is a coincidence , i only noticed this after writing it out . 
  this is using the long form of the 1st person singular pronoun . 
  you could have / ' \u00e6rs : \u0252 : j\u00e6s : / aswell . 
  interesting fact : only 1 copula ( the final word ) . 
  i count 2 for u/padawannerd , or 7 if counting the prefixed `` be-permanently '' , etc. 
  ( are those copulas ? ), 
  in your orthography , how do you represent / e\u026a / and / \u025b / ? 
  why is the first `` u '' in * kuraso'uk * reduced ? 
  why is n't the `` a '' in * inda * reduced ? 
  you can indicate stress in the ipa with < '  . 
  so e.g in / in 'd \u0251 / , this marks the second syllable as being stressed . 
  the sami cognate being lule sami * suohp\u0113 * , meaning `` soft '' . 
  the proto-finnic word was * hopeda , which was most likely borrowed from proto-germanic `` samftijaz '' - even , light , soft . 
  the proto-finnic word also had the meaning of `` soft '' , which is seen in veps `` hobed '' , meaning soft , gentle , delicate , fine . 
  also , * l\u00e4\u00e4nemeresoome * in english is just `` finnic '' . 
  `` balto-finnic '' is rare . 
  the run itself was n't so important . 
  what was important was his commentary , it summed up the history of oot any % in a really sweet way , and made many people dig further into it . 
  that run was probably the reason i even played oot and mm casually . 
  there 's a lot of great and interesting history in there . 
  any % in itself is n't really interesting at all , but the run was an introduction to something much bigger . 
  any % also was n't that competitive . 
  in late 2013 and early 2014 , there were only 2 people seriously running it : skater and shaeden . 
  there were a few names with good times , like kuhls with 19:08 . 
  skater eventually got sub 19 . 
  i have n't heard of shaeden since , but i saw him in jodenstone 's and skater 's chat in february of 2015 ( holy shit , that was 2 + years ago ) . 
  later , cosmo began running it again , got his 18:10 . 
  then jodenstone came . 
  also , nostalgia . 
  2013 could be considered a golden year of speedrunning . 
  a lot of people got into it during that year . 
  twitch became really popular . 
  forgot to mention that the proto-finnic word was most likely borrowed from proto-germanic * samftijaz , which meant `` even '' , `` light '' , `` soft '' . 
  missing finnic languages :, 
  - ijaz and - eda are both suffixes , ignore those . 
  an important cognate is lule sami * suohp\u0113 * . 
  \u0161 ( / \u0283 / ) -  h is a regular in finnic languages . 
  s -  h is n't that strange either . 
  f -  p is also very common . 
  so , a simplification of the cluster , a change of the vowel , and hop - is n't that unreasonable . 
  although it 's just a theory . 
  it does n't fit perfectly . 
  livvi and ludic are both next to veps , around lake onega / \u00c4\u00e4nisj\u00e4rvi . 
  ( marked as `` karelian '' on your map ) . 
  livvi is spoken between onega and ladoga . 
  ludic is spoken around onega . 
  votic and izhorian are in ingria , votic is spoken in the villages of j\u00f5g\u00f5per\u00e4 / krakolje and liivt\u0161\u00fcl\u00e4 / lu\u017eicy . 
  they 're both just south of ust-luga . 
  izhorian is spoken around the soikinsky peninsula .
