  there is a construction that resembles a circumposition , but is most likely an adverb . 
  ** \u00c4\u00e4 tul \u00e4rr\u00e4 tal\u014d tak\u00f5ci ** / ' \u00e6 : ` tul\u02b2 ' \u00e6r : \u00e6 ` talo : ` t\u0251k\u0264tsi / * 3sg come-pst .3 sg away farm-gen from.behind * `` he came from behind the farm '', 
  that would be the out-of-universe reason . 
  all glitches are valid . 
  if really big glitches are found and they are not fun , then new categories are created . 
  for example , gta vice city has a glitch called `` script stack underflow '' that allows you to skip to the final mission and complete the game in about 10 minutes . 
  ( the current wr stands at 11:47 ) . 
  it 's not very popular , and if you take a look at [ the leaderboards ] ( http://www.speedrun.com/gtavc#any ) , most runs are from august of 2016 , which is when the glitch was discovered . 
  there is a category called `` any % no ssu '' that completes the game in around 50 minutes . 
  this run is extremely glitch heavy , making use of the replay function to skip most of the asset missions . 
  ( the current wr stands at 52:31 ), 
  the `` glitchless '' run would be around 1h and 30 minutes , but nobody runs it , since the replay glitches skip a very tedious part of the game - sunshine autos . 
  you have to collect cars for a list , and they spawn randomly . 
  so it 's completely luck-based . 
  speedrunners generally dislike luck-based elements . 
  they also skip another tedious part - cone crazy , which in the old route , was used to make money to buy the assets . 
  nobody wants to go back to this . 
  there 's also a category called `` all missions '' , which completes all the missions , with no further restrictions . 
  ( the current wr stands at 2:18:06 ), 
  `` grammar '' is not a `` classist/racist structure '' though . 
  prescriptivism is . 
  that 's a key difference . 
  aave has grammar , general american has grammar , they 're just different . 
  yeah . 
  using technical terminology in a casual setting is just confusing . 
  i consider myself right-wing , but i find the general right-wing opinion on language idiotic . 
  i 've been interested in languages for a while . 
  i started with orthographies and gibberish dialects , did n't get into grammar ( besides noun declension ) for years . 
  i ca n't remember where i discovered r/conlangs ( this was in december 2015 ) , but i visited r/etymologymaps and r/linguistics for a year and a half before i discovered this subreddit . 
  probably through those , somehow . 
  i had heard of klingon and tolkien 's languages in passing before , but not a lot . 
  i knew about esperanto but really did n't think about the constructed aspect of it . 
  also , u/madmac0498 mentioned xidnaf . 
  his earlier videos are from 2014 , so i probably knew about him before i found out about conlanging . 
  his video about conlanging is newer though . 
  i speak estonian natively . 
  so my early attempts were characterised by a large number of noun cases ( i really liked , and still do , the 3-way system of illative-inessive-elative , allative-adessive-ablative , etc , basically of : going-being-coming ), 
  i knew russian a bit , and this did influence my first conlang a little ( i had the - l past that did n't change for person , even if other suffixes did ), 
  * no-2sg . imp be.embarrassed-prs . connegative , if.rel eat-2sg . prs ice.cream-part , no-2sg . imp allow-prs . connegative society-part say-inf 2sg-all , how enjoy this-part *, 
  * no you worry , if eat you ice cream , no you allow society to say you onto , how enjoy you this *, 
  russian loans :, 
  * ** op\u0161\u00f5stva ** / ` op\u0283\u0264stv\u0251 / `` society '' , from russian * \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e * ( ob\u0161\u010destvo ), 
  alternative native form for the second would be ** \u00fc\u0161t\u00fcs\u010d\u00fcnt\u00e4 ** / ` y\u0283tyst\u0283ynt\u00e6 / , but it 's slightly less common in colloquial speech . 
  it 's derived from ** \u00fc\u0161t\u00fcz ** / ` y\u0283tyz / `` common '' , `` same '' + the suffix * - kunta * / * - \u010d\u00fcnt\u00e4 * , which derives groups of things . 
  the estonian and finnish cognates to this word are * \u00fchiskond * and * yhdyskunta * ( \u00fchd\u00fcskunta ) , respectively . 
  in estonian , * - kond * is a suffix which does n't change for vowel harmony , since standard estonian does n't have it . 
  in finnish , * kunta * is a seperate word . 
  in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , it has become a productive suffix , so it changes for vowel harmony . 
  is that a marked nominative ? 
  in `` 2s eat snow-food '' , 2s is marked and snow-food is unmarked . 
  in pronouns , is the accusative form regular or irregular ? 
  i presume ** ki ** is a particle that marks the nominative . 
  * fawanamyu * does n't have any markings , while it is the object of the sentence . 
  while * sa * , the subject , does have that nominative particle . 
  do you only mark the accusative case in pronouns ? 
  or is there some sort of accusative particle ? 
  how does that accusative form look like there ? 
  the 2nd person singular nominative seems to be ** sa ** , and the accusative ** isa ** . 
  how about 1st person , 3rd person , plural ?
