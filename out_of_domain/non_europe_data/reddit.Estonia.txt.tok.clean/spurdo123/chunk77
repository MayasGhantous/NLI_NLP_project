  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl is a finnic language spoken near the city of oudova/gdov ( \u014ctova / ` o : t\u0264v\u0251 / , in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ) , stretching further south . 
  also , what is the ipa of that ? 
  where is your conlang spoken ? 
  to add :, 
  * vool * also just means `` flow '' . 
  ultimately derived from the word * voog * `` a big wave '' , which is from proto-uralic * uwa - `` to flow '' . 
  actually * pini * in v\u00f5ro . 
  * peni * is the estonian/finnish/votic form . 
  ( in votic it means bitch/female dog , specifically ), 
  also , other finnic languages :, 
  it 's not that unthinkable . 
  i remembered ainu being tripartite in pronouns and nom-acc in nouns , but i looked it up and this is false . 
  it actually does n't mark case in pronouns at all , but has tripartite pronominal suffixes in the 1st person plural , and nom-acc pronominal suffixes in the 1st person singular . 
  a marked nominative is really cool , since it 's so rare but still not that exotic . 
  old norse and gothic had it . 
  [ example from gothic : * dags * is day-nom , while * dag * is day.acc ], 
  that initial / o / is strange , unless you got it specifically from the northern russian dialects , where that / o / exists . 
  / ` k\u025b : n ' \u0251 ` x\u00e6k\u0251s : \u0259 ` l\u0251 'm \u0251j\u00e6g /, 
  * 3sg def [ h-prothesis ] afterlife-ess [ emphatic topic marker ] be-3sg . fut *, 
  * he the afterlife in shall be . 
  the word * aconn * / ' \u00e6k\u0251n / `` afterlife '' is derived from * oco * / ' \u0251k\u0251 / , which means `` devil '' , or `` beast/spirit in the afterlife '' . 
  the mutish afterlife is seen as a continuation of this life , but with these spirits making life harder . 
  they suck your blood , make tremendous noise , and are constantly nearby , so loneliness in the afterlife is impossible . 
  so the muth have a very strong fear of death . 
  for this reason they 're also quite pacifistic , but fighting and wrestling are still favourite national pastimes . 
  some muth , but not all , believe in reincarnation based on good deeds . 
  in these areas christianity is widespread aswell , so they tend to mix folk religion with christianity a lot . 
  for them , if you do n't do any good , you will go to * ag haconn * and spread the rest of eternity in suffering . 
  although the afterlife is actually not as bad as you might think , more of a constant inconvenience , but not mild enough to get used to . 
  what other meanings does * a * have ? 
  so , `` he goes on hell '' ? 
  does your conlang not differentiate between `` going somewhere '' ( allative/illative/lative , etc ) and `` being somewhere '' ( adessive/inessive/essive , etc ) ? 
  cool . 
  to bring some examples about this from a natlang :, 
  in estonian :, 
  * 3sg go-3sg . prs hell-ine * - * ta l\u00e4heb p\u00f5rgus * is ungrammatical and incomplete . 
  adding one word : * ta l\u00e4heb p\u00f5rgus lolliks * - * 3sg go-3sg . prs hell-ine crazy-translative * `` he 'll go crazy in hell '' makes it grammatical . 
  * 3sg walk-3sg . prs hell-ine * - * ta k\u00f5nnib p\u00f5rgus * - `` he is walking inside hell '' . 
  `` he goes to hell '' or `` he 'll go to hell '' ( same thing ) is * ta l\u00e4heb p\u00f5rgu * , or * ta l\u00e4heb p\u00f5rgusse * ( same thing , the illative has 2 forms ) - * 3sg go-3sg . prs hell-ill *, 
  another sentence : * ta k\u00e4ib p\u00f5rgus * - `` he visits hell '' ( often ) , the gloss would be * 3sg go-3sg . prs hell-ine * . 
  the verb * k\u00e4ima * means `` to walk '' or `` to go '' , but with the inessive , also means `` to visit '' [ * ma l\u00e4hen k\u00e4in poes \u00e4ra * - * 1sg go .1 sg.prs walk-1sg . prs store-ine away * `` i 'll go to the store '' ], 
  the insult , `` go to hell '' , is * k\u00e4i p\u00f5rgu * - * walk-2sg . imp hell-ill * `` walk to hell '' , or `` go to hell '', 
  even more strange , although major phonological changes in loanwords are n't that unusual . 
  finnish is the only finnic language that writes < y  for / y / . 
  all the others write < \u00fc  . 
  livonian uses a macron for long vowels , but this is latvian influence . 
  vowel harmony is missing in north estonian , livonian , and partly in veps . 
  to bring examples of germanic/german influence :, 
  * perfect tenses formed with copula and participles ( might be baltic influence . ), 
  * v2 word order in estonian ( german influence specifically ), 
  * a shitton of vocabulary . 
  all the finnic languages have had germanic languages that have influenced them . 
  proto-germanic influenced all . 
  but there was a newer wave that influenced the westernmost languages . 
  this was swedish for finnish . 
  this was middle low german for estonian and livonian , and later standard german and the high german dialect of baltic german . 
  livonian actually got it through latvian , not directly from german .

  what are the differences between those orthographies ? 
  what 's the reason for having 2 ?

  this reminds me of russian , where * \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f * ( istorija ) means both `` history '' and `` story '' .

  that vocative is so sexy . 
  is the suffix always * - i * ? 
  is there a distinct plural vocative ? 
  how conservative is it ? 
  does it preserve the masculine nominative ending of nouns , so e.g is `` king '' * k\u00f6ning * , or something like * k\u00f6ning ( a ) s * or * k\u00f6ning ( a ) r * ? 
  ( in proto-germanic : * kuningaz * , * konungr * in old norse , no word from this root in gothic , but borrowed as * kuningas * into finnic ( funnily enough * kuning * in v\u00f5ro , the same sound change happened in all the modern germanic languages except icelandic ) , as * kunigas * into lithuanian , and as * gonagas * into northern sami ),
