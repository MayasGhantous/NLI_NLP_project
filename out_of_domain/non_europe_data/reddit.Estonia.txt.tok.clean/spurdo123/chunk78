  m\u012b\u0161\u00e4 \u00f5p\u00f5\u00f5t ? 
  pronounciation guide : same as estonian , but macrons indicate long vowels , < d  is / \u00f0 / , and < g  is / \u0263 / . 
  tradition . 
  estonian was the first finnic language with that sound to be written down , and it originally wrote it as < \u00f6  , which also represented / \u00f8 / . 
  a man named otto wilhelm masing invented the letter < \u00f5  in the early 19th century to represent / \u0264 / . 
  v\u00f5ro , livonian , and votic , the other finnic languages that underwent the sound change , all write it as < \u00f5  . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl is a southern finnic language . 
  it 's closest to votic , but with some unique elements in grammar and vocabulary . 
  like votic , but unlike estonian , it has vowel harmony , possessive suffixes , and no apocope ( with the exception of final / l / before front vowels , which turns into / l\u02b2 / . ) . 
  it also shares the change of / k / before front vowels -  / t\u0283 / with votic . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl 's orthography is odd though . 
  it 's similar to livonian in the way it marks long vowels with macrons , but unlike livonian , it does n't use the macron for letters with diacritics that already mark special vowels . 
  so / \u00e6 : / is < \u00e4\u00e4  , not < \u01df  , which is the letter livonian uses . 
  the letter < \u010d  is also weird . 
  votic uses < t\u0161  , although karelian uses < \u010d  . 
  all the other finnic languages do n't have the / t\u0283 / sound natively . 
  so , written with votic/estonian orthography , < m\u0101\u010d\u012bl  would be < maat\u0161iil  . 
  pronounced / 'm \u0251 : t\u0283i : l\u02b2 / . 
  `` land-language '' . 
  so , what would the nominative of `` king '' be ? 
  there 's front-back vowel harmony . 
  back / \u0264 / corresponds to front / e / . 
  there 's one neutral vowel - / i / . 
  this is the system in votic and v\u00f5ro . 
  other finnic languages : ( wall of a room ), 
  also , u/lolikus is correct . 
  the word for `` hay '' is different , in estonian : ** hein ** , in finnish : ** hein\u00e4 ** . 
  that \u0161 ( / \u0283 / ) regularly becomes / h / when borrowed into the finnic languages . 
  also , another good way to spot baltic loans is if lithuanian and latvian have - ie - , and estonian and finnish have - ei - . 
  the - ei - is older and is seen in old prussian . 
  both lithuanian and latvian turned it into - ie - after it was borrowed into the finnic languages . 
  and like u/h2ppyme mentioned , * m\u00fc\u00fcr * and * sein * mean different things . 
  the berlin wall is ** berliini m\u00fc\u00fcr ** . 
  so , tips for next time : if the english word has multible meanings , narrow it down to one !, 
  many languages make distinctions english does n't . 
  freestanding wall in votic is ** m\u00fc\u00fcr\u00fc ** or ** m\u00fc\u00fcri ** , which was borrowed from estonian ** m\u00fc\u00fcr ** , which was borrowed from middle low german ** mure ** . 
  you 've got a typo . 
  the votic word is ** \u00f5p\u00f5a ** , not ** \u00f6p\u00f6a ** , which violates vowel harmony . 
  \u00f6 is a front vowel / \u00f8 / , a is a back vowel / \u0251 / . 
  \u00f5 is a back vowel / \u0264 / , so it can appear in a word together with a , while \u00f6 ca n't . 
  loan words from izhorian ( / e / appears with back vowels there ) and russian ( no vowel harmony at all ) do n't have this , but this is not the case here . 
  also , \u00f6 in non-initial syllables is rare , generally only found in izhorian loans . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=sein&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et ) - the ety has the etymology , and lists cognates to the estonian word . 
  i also used the `` vadja keele s\u00f5naraamat '' for the votic word . 
  what do you mean by `` consonants in the wrong order '' ? 
  i agree , even though my native language ( estonian ) distinguishes / \u00f8 / and / \u0264 / . 
  i had trouble distinguishing these until i learnt about linguistics , now i know which sound i 'm making by tongue position , even though i have trouble hearing the difference and still confuse these sounds in words like * \u00f6elda * `` to say '' , which should be / ' \u00f8eld\u0325\u0251 / , but i say / ' \u0264eld\u0325\u0251 / , and often write * \u00f5elda * . 
  russian has / \u0268 / , and when estonians learn it , we are taught that this sound is / \u0264 / , so most pronounce it as such . 
  i can try to produce it , and when i hear it i recognise it , but it 's still so similar to / \u0264 / . 
  estonian does n't have this sound , are you thinking of / y / < \u00fc  ? 
  / \u028f / is the german < \u00fc  , and the wikipedia article 's sound file sounds just like / \u00f8 / to me . 
  that 's a good start , most people have n't even gotten to that part . 
  maybe so , but the example of [ \u028f ] as seen [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:near-close_near-front_rounded_vowel.ogg ) sounds nothing like estonian < \u00fc  ( supposedly / y / ) , but rather < \u00f6  ( supposedly / \u00f8 / ) . 
  it sounds almost exactly like the word ** \u00f6\u00f6 ** / \u00f8 : / , which means `` night '' . 
  the example of [ \u00f8 ] as seen [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:close-mid_front_rounded_vowel.ogg ) sounds weird , definitely not the estonian / \u00f8 / . 
  veps does n't have < \u00f5  . 
  i 've no idea what the breve represents .

  < i  / i / is neutral , so it 's not important .

  what does * pi ' * represent ? 
  `` more '' ? 
  is it a standalone word or only a prefix ? 
   zeleni = green, 
  i do n't know how intentional this is , but this form is quite west slavic ( * zelen\u00fd * in czech and slovak , * zielony * in polish ) . 
  east slavic uses the definite pronominal endings ( russian and belarusian have that \u0451 ( jo ) aswell ) , and south slavic has no vowel at the end . 
  i 'm not sure on the etymology , but could someone more knowledgeable explain why west slavic has that ( long ) front vowel ( / \u0268 / in polish ) when the proto-slavic word had a back yer ?
