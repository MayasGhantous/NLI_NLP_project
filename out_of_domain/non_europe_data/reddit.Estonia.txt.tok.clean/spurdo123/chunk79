  ( * zelen\u044a . 
  as seen in old church slavonic ) why was n't it lost ? 
   likua [ lik\u02b0\u02d0u\u0250 ] `` to move '' , valada [ v\u0251l\u02d0\u0250d\u0250 ] `` to pour '', 
  why do you preserve the intervocalic * / d / in only one of these ? 
  finnic conlangs are so cool . 
  could you give more details about yours ? 
  i noticed [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/6j4fyo/things_youd_challenge_27_23/djbyyjx/ ) that you have < \u00f5  and also have < e  as a neutral vowel , or do n't have vowel harmony at all . 
  which is the case ? 
  in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl : ** a\u0161v\u00f5na ** / ' \u0251\u0283v\u0264n\u0251 /, 
  * / h / in consonant clusters -  / \u0283 /, 
  * / e / in back-vowel-harmony words -  / \u0264 /, 
  * vowel added to the end in the nominative ( this happens in many other words , e.g * sisar becomes `` s\u00f5zari '' / 's \u0264z\u0251ri / - sister . 
  is that your actual orthography ? 
  do you have any grammatical cases ? 
  if you do , how does * nyngyr * inflect ? 
  how is it derived exactly , morpheme-by-morpheme ? 
  as seen in estonian ** liikuda ** and veps ** likkuda ** . 
  ( that - k comes from v\u00f5ro , where there 's a glottal stop at the end , but i do n't know the v\u00f5ro word atm . 
  eastern votic dialects also have - g here . ), 
  estonian ** valada ** is a cognate to finnish and votic ** valaa ** , from original ** valadak ** . 
  veps and ludic also have ** valada ** . 
  v\u00f5ro has ** vallaq ** . 
  finnish and votic regularly lose that intervocalic / d / in the infinitive , with the exception of disyllabic words , like ** saada ** ( * saata * or * saavva * in votic ) `` to get '' . 
  also the word `` dark '' proto-finnic ** pimed\u00e4 ** . 
  - in finnish : ** pime\u00e4 ** , in votic : ** pimi\u00e4 ** . 
  in estonian * pime * , genitive ** pimeda ** ( the genitive preserves the original nominative in this case , as estonian loses final nasals . 
  estonian also lost / \u00e6 / , / \u00f8 / , / y / , / \u0264 / in non-initial syllables ) . 
  veps and ludic have ** pimed ** here . 
  the proto-finnic infinitive was always * - dak * or * - tak * . 
  never just a vowel like in finnish and votic . 
  what 's the ipa of that ? 
  * mina * / ` min\u0251 / in estonian is the long 1st person singular pronoun - i. 
  cool . 
  what do your genders look like ? 
  is the neuter the most common ?
