  * f - is used for future participles , e.g the adverbial future participle of `` to love '' is `` f ` am\u00f3rex '', 
  also , contractions are written with apostrophes , but most of them are n't really a part of the written language . 
  except for the contraction of `` how '' - e.g `` how good is this ? '', 
  contracted form - `` ka ` buenis ox est ? '', 
  - free word order by the way , so this can go in any way . 
  revenge be [ 3rd person singular ] a dish [ mixed declension nominative ] good [ superlative adverbial ] serve [ present active participle ] cold [ adverb ], 
  it 's odd that you would list the proto-finnic roots for livonian , but there is no asterisk to indicate a reconstruction . 
  the livonian words for `` spring '' and month '' are `` kiev\u0101d '' and `` k\u016b '' . 
  ok , sorry then :d did n't notice the other one .

  ** semper vaskenet ** - i do n't understand this sentence since the latin and english translations use different verbs , and also the meaning of `` ever '' in this context . 
  ** kaip imantras imtet oxem ; ** - i also do n't understand this sentence completely . 
  only for the second person pronouns . 
  informal : ** tu ** / tu / - used for informal situations like friends and family , and strangers who are younger than you , and people who are of lower rank of you in hierarchys . 
  although if you want to be over-polite you could use the semi-formal pronoun for the last 2 .

  this is also the plural pronoun .

  latin , lithuanian , russian , estonian , german , english , latvian , romanian , proto indo-european ( in a rough order of significance ), 
  knowing only the first 2 would get you a very long way . 
  * then all change [ 3rd person singular past simple ] , when fire [ genitive ] nation attack [ 3rd person singular past simple ] *, 
  there was a thread about this a month ago , so i 'll copy my post from there . 
  it was about romlangs so i used overly-latin vocabulary ( e.g `` kaelos '' instead of `` roios '' for `` heaven '' ) . 
  i think this should be up-to-date .

  i 'd say the map does a bad job at seperating non-ie languages from ie languages . 
  kurdish and ossetian are both indo-iranian . 
  greek and armenian form the controversial/disputed branch of `` graeco-armenian '' ( they 're usually in different branches ) and albanian is it 's own branch . 
  uralic and altaic ( again , disputed terminology ) languages are n't indo-european at all . 
  also , there is no `` sami language '' , there is a group of languages called `` sami languages '' . 
  yep , a lot of my vocabulary is from latin and in this text i deliberately used words of latin origin where other words could 've been used . 
  only one i can think of right now . 
  to put down trackbed bars < -  to drink a lot, 
  `` to put down trackbed bars '' < -  `` to put down litres '', 
  yeah , synonyms from many sources was somewhat of a goal of mine . 
  for example , here are all the words for `` city '' :, 
  * stadas / ` stadas / - used for native cities , neutral style variety, 
  * kaubungas / kau ` bu\u014bas / - rural , small town/city , in historical discussion : trade centre , city focused on trade, 
  * urbas / ` urbas / - used generally for foreign cities , also neutral style variety, 
  * mestas / ` mestas / - used for backwards , run-down and crime-ridden cities , towns and villages . 
  * burgas / ` burgas / - advanced , big , metropolitan area, 
  * civitas / tsi ` vitas / - used for certain italian cities ( f.e venice , rome ) and also all city-states . 
  * sirius bright [ superlative ] star in night [ locative ] sky [ locative ] be [ 3rd person singular present ] *, 
  a lot of the word order is free . 
  although adjectives always go before the noun and prepositions like to come before the adjective ( or noun , if there is no adjective ) they are describing . 
  e.g `` in my house '' is `` in h\u00fasat myn '' - `` in h\u00fasat '' is `` in house [ locative ] '' and `` myn '' is `` my '' ( `` i '' in genitive ) . 
  however , articles override this , so the order is : preposition - ( article ) - ( adjective ) - noun, 
  so , e.g ** klarium astras est in naktit roiat sirius ** is perfectly valid . 
  i 'm not exactly sure , but is this order ovs ? 
  i added all the dual forms aswell , since i have it . 
   our book ( one book shared by 3 + owners ), 
   our book ( one book shared by 2 owners ), 
   our books ( multible books shared by multible owners ), 
   our books ( 2 books shared by multible owners ), 
   our books ( 2 books shared by 2 owners ), 
  ** nostri nygi **, 
   our books ( multible books shared by 2 owners ), 
   our books ( multible owners have one book each ), 
  `` books , that is ours '', 
   our books ( multible owners each have multible books ), 
  `` books , that are ours '', 
   our books ( 2 owners have one book each ), 
   our books ( multible owners each have 2 books ), 
  ** nygei , k\u00f3 esta nostrum ** - here , `` esta '' is in the dual, 
   our books ( 2 owners each have multible books ), 
  the last 5 are just novelty , and would only be used if the distinction is necessary . 
  you can use one of the first variants with no issues in communication . 
  regarding the dual number , it really ups the complexity of everything . 
  if you count the conditional and all the participles , there are well over 100 different forms of verbs . 
  also , the dual is n't really used too much . 
  i rarely get to use it when translating texts . 
  i make up for that complexity by having all inflection be consistent . 
  most common gender nouns declend identically , and neuter gender nouns only have 4 types of declension , which you can tell from the word itself .
