  unlike finnish , / e / in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl is not neutral and is a front vowel . 
  examples :, 
  * `` bogless '' : ** s\u014dt\u00f5i ** / ` so : t\u0264i / . 
  from * s\u014d * + * - t\u00f5i * '' - less '' . 
  * `` voiceless '' , `` without a voice '' : ** \u0113nit\u00f6i ** / ` e : nit\u00f8i / . 
  from * \u0113ni * + * - t\u00f6i * . 
  in this case , the original proto-finnic back-vowel suffix was * - toin * , which later became * - t\u00f5i * . 
  another example :, 
  * `` maybe a poem '' : ** runoko ** / ` runoko /, 
  * `` maybe an eye '' : ** silm\u00e4\u010d\u00f6 ** / ` silm\u00e6t\u0283\u00f8 /, 
  * - ko * / ko / `` maybe '' contrasts with the front * - \u010d\u00f6 * / t\u0283\u00f8 / . 
  could you give some examples ? 
  the change happened between proto-finnic and the common ancestor of votic , v\u00f5ro , livonian , estonian ( and m\u0101\u010d\u012bl ) . 
  estonian later lost / \u0264 / in non-initial syllables and also vowel harmony , but kept it in intial syllables . 
  livonian also lost vowel harmony , and its pronounciation of ancestral [ \u0264 ] is actually [ \u0268 ] . 
  / e / became a front vowel and / \u0264 / was created as its back equivalent . 
  so , compare finnish ** velka ** and izhorian ** velga ** to votic ** v\u00f5lka ** , livonian ** v\u022dlga ** , and estonian ** v\u00f5lg ** . 
  * - ko * / * - \u010d\u00f6 * is simply a cognate to the finnish enclitic , with a minor change in meaning .

  it normally means `` grass '' . 
  mutish has 2 words , the borrowing and the native word :, 
  ** snaigilh ** / ` sn\u00e6 : j\u0259l / - derived from * snagon * / ` sn\u00e6jo : / `` to know '' , plus the agent suffix * - lh * , so `` knower '' . 
  sernerdas also has 2 words , but neither are native :, 
  ** dator ** / ` datur / - borrowed from swedish * dator * . 
  compare also latvian * dators * . 
  slightly dated . 
  also sometimes * datoras * / ` daturas / , which is rare . 
  the youth use this more . 
  the form with * - as * is slightly more common . 
  what 's the `` all-gendered pronoun '' ? 
  how is it used ? 
  is `` they ( all-gendered ) '' just 3rd person plural for mixed-gender groups ? 
  are there any examples from natlangs for this ? 
  the 2 languages with gendered pronouns i know ( english , russian ) make no distinction in the plural . 
  8 and 9 are possibly partial indo-iranian loans . 
  ** kaheksa ** ( 8 ) is * kaks ( 2 ) ( from ) detsa * ( * detsa * being the proto-indo-iranian word for `` ten '' . 
  compare sanskrit * dasa * and greek * deka * . ) . 
  ** \u00fcheksa ** ( 9 ) is * \u00fcks ( 1 ) ( from ) detsa * . 
  * kahe * is the genitive of * kaks * and * \u00fche * is the genitive of * \u00fcks * . 
  the alternate theory is that the second element is a negation of sorts , from the negative verb * e - * . 
  100 ( ** sada ** ) is also an indo-iranian loan . 
  compare avestan * sat\u0259m * . 
  there is also a pre-balto-slavic/indo-european borrowing theory for the number 7 ( ** seitse ** ) , compare proto-indo-european * septm\u0325 . 
  so the answer is either 6 , 7 or 99 .

  not the whole lithuania , but the region around klaip\u0117da ( the german name of which is memel ) . 
  vice city , a game with a % counter , has a very strict definition for 100 % . 
  you can manipulate the % counter by duplicating missions , each instance of a mission grants a certain percentage , so you can reach 100 % without completing everything in the game . 
  it 's capped at 100 % , so you ca n't gain any more percentage . 
  so it 's defined as completing every objective that grants percentage towards the counter . 
  because of this , the counter shows 100 % before the run is actually completed , as mission duplication is still used . 
  bug limit is a synonym that 's sadly not used in the anglophone community , for whatever reason . 
  in my opinion it is the better name . 
  no major glitches is something else .

  strange . 
  i 've never heard of an estonian pronouncing it with any sound other than the hard / g / . 
  the letter `` g '' in estonian always makes a / g / sound ( to be precise , actually [ \u0261\u030a ] , which is a lenis unvoiced velar stop ), 
  yep ,

   would each world have to create their own quantum mirror for them to work ? 
  i reckon this is true . 
  all the worlds seen in the quantum mirror seem quite similar to ours . 
  there was one in point of view , where the mirror was at some beach though . 
  cool , thanks .
