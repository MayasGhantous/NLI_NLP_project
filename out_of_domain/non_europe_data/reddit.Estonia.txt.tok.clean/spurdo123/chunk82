  baltic is separate . 
  most theories say that the slavic and baltic languages once had a common ancestor : proto-balto-slavic . 
  but this was a very long time ago , so the similarities are very hard to see : common sound changes compared to other families , and similar grammatical features ( such as the negative direct object being in the genitive , and the ablative being fused with the genitive ) . 
  there is no intelligibility at all , between slavic and baltic . 
  which usually is a good indicator that they are separate families . 
  the three largest language families of europe are indo-european , uralic , and turkic . 
  romance , germanic , slavic , etc. 
  are subfamilies . 
  nitpicking , but it 's an important distinction . 
  proto-finnic borrowed heavily from other languages . 
  kinship terms , terms for most technology are all borrowed . 
  mainly from baltic and germanic languages . 
  basic terms such as `` tribe '' , `` daughter '' , and `` sister '' are all borrowed from baltic languages . 
  `` cousin '' in estonian is baltic . 
  `` mother '' in finnish is germanic . 
  this continued on in the daughter languages . 
  finnish borrowed heavily from swedish , estonian borrowed heavily from low german and standard german , and the rest ( votic , izhorian , karelian , etc ) borrowed heavily from russian . 
  the finns , ludes , and estonians most likely borrowed their endonyms . 
  finns from baltic ( originally meaning `` land '' ) , ludes from either russian or proto-germanic ( russian * ljudi * , gothic * liudi * = people ) , and estonians from german ( originally meaning `` east '' ) . 
  there are alternate theories : * suomi * coming from an older indo-european word meaning `` man '' - compare old lithuanian * \u017emuo * and latin * homo * . 
  or it being native , related to the words * suo * `` swamp '' , * suomu * `` scale '' , and * suoda * `` to let '' , `` to give '' . 
  * eesti * might be ultimately baltic , from a word meaning `` field '' . 
  the original estonian endonym was ** maarahvas ** , lit . 
  the language was ** maakeel ** - `` land language '' , and estonia itself was ** maavald ** , which in modern estonian means `` land parish '' , but originally something like `` land power '' . 
  this was in general use until the 19th century , when the german * eesti * was adopted . 
  pagans still use the old terms . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl is finnic . 
  its closest relative is votic . 
  estonian is also close . 
  in terms of grammatical features , it preserves possessive suffixes , like votic and finnish , it innovates a subjunctive from the past conditional , loses the instructive , and innovates 3 new cases : the prolative , the lative , and the exessive . 
  those three were originally just suffixes , in proto-finnic . 
  it also loses the potential mood . 
  examples of the new cases :, 
  * ** pitikaz men\u0113 a\u0161v\u00f5nci ** / ` pitik\u0251z ` mene : \u0251\u0283v\u0264ntsi / * bug go-3sg . pst perch-prolative * `` the bug moved through the perch '', 
  * ** pitikaz men\u0113 a\u0161v\u00f5n\u00f5z ** / ` pitik\u0251z ` mene : ' \u0251\u0283v\u0264n\u0264z / * bug go-3sg . pst perch-lative * `` the bug moved towards the perch '', 
  * ** v\u00f5l\u017eo l\u012bvi a\u0161v\u00f5n\u00f5nta ** / ` v\u0264l\u0292o ` li : vi \u0251\u0283v\u0264n\u0264nt\u0251 / * wizard be.in.the.future-3sg . prs perch-exessive * `` the wizard shall soon turn back from being a perch '', 
  it also has an unique way of handling dative/genitive constructions :, 
  `` i 'm cold '' : ** \u010d\u00fclm\u00e4ni ** / ` t\u0283ylm\u00e6ni / * cold-poss .1 sg * , or ** \u010d\u00fclm\u00e4 ( \u00f5\u00f5 ) min\u016b ** / ` t\u0283ylm\u00e6 ' \u0264 : ` minu : / * cold ( be-3sg . prs ) 1sg-gen *, 
  `` i have to eat '' : ** pit\u00e4d\u00e4 s\u00f6\u00f6d\u00e4ni ** / ` pit\u00e6\u00f0\u00e6 's \u00f8 : \u00f0\u00e6ni / * must-inf eat-inf-poss .1 sg * , or ** pit\u00e4d\u00e4 s\u00f6\u00f6d\u00e4 ( \u00f5\u00f5 ) min\u016b ** / ` pit\u00e6\u00f0\u00e6 's \u00f8 : \u00f0\u00e6 ' \u0264 : ` minu : / * must-inf eat-inf ( be-3sg . prs ) 1sg-gen *, 
  in terms of phonology , it shares many of its isoglosses with votic . 
  / e / in back-vowel-harmony words -  / \u0264 / ; / o / in the first syllable -  / \u0264 / ; / k / before front vowels -  / t\u0283 / , etc. 
  like western finnish , but unlike all other finnic languages , m\u0101\u010d\u012bl has no palatalisation . 
  an unique sound change is proto-finnic / ts / -  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl / \u0283 / . 
  in other finnic languages , it usually fused with / s / . 
  v\u00f5ro preserves it initially , and in other cases it 's reconstructible internally and through cognates in other uralic languages . 
  it preserves the proto-finnic voiced stops ( / g / , / b / , / d / ) as / \u0263 / , / v / , / \u00f0 / . 
  other finnic languages preserve them in various ways , but only veps and livonian preserve them fully .

  the governate of livonia had both estonians and latvians . 
  the makers of the map probably could n't be arsed to find the specific ethnic border , so they just approximated .
