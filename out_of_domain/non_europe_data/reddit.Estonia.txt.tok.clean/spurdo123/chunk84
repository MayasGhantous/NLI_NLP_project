  e.g for the [ etymology ] ( http://www.eki.ee/dict/ety/index.cgi?q=soome&amp;f=m&amp;c06=et ) of * soome * `` finnish '' , there 's a theory that it comes from an old indo-european word meaning `` man '' , so it lists latin * homo * and `` lithuanian ** \u017emuo ** '' but also marks that it 's dated and archaic ( the modern word is * \u017emogus * , of course ) .

  ** los p se q ** / ` l\u0251z ` p\u0251 ` si ` ku / * or p and q * - p or q but not both, 
  ** les p se q ** / ` liz ` p\u0251 ` si ` ku / * or p and q * - p or q or both or something else, 
  ** p sels q ** / ` p\u0251 ` si : s ` ku / * p and/or q * - p and/or q, 
  mutish has a definite article , which acts just like a preposition . 
  this triggers mixed mutation of the initial consonant of the next word ( this is irregular , prepositions ending in vowels usually trigger weak mutation ) . 
  so , `` man '' is ** poarh ** / ` p\u0252 : r / , and the definite form of that is ** ag boarh ** / ' \u0251 ' \u03b2\u0252 : r / . 
  ( note : / \u03b2 / fuses with / v / in most dialects , and i personally say / v / aswell ), 
  there is a plural form : ** aga ** / ' \u00e6j\u00e6 / , which triggers weak mutation . 
  `` men '' : ** poarac ** / ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6g / , `` the men '' : ** aga bpoarac ** / ' \u00e6j\u00e6 ` b\u0252 : r\u00e6g /, 
  some dialects say ** ag boarac ** instead , but this is considered nonstandard . 
  in terms of usage , in mutish , proper nouns , names , placenames , can be definite . 
  it 's also used together with demonstratives . 
  the definite article always goes before the noun : ** ag boarh cue ** / ' \u0251 ' \u03b2\u0252 : r ` ky : / * def [ mixed mutation ] man that.dem * - lit . 
  `` the that man '', 
  there is no indefinite article , but there are 2 deemphatic particles that resemble it somewhat : ** poarh oalag ** / ` p\u0252 : r ' \u0252 : l\u0251 / `` some man '' , `` a man '' ( topic ) , ** poarh mei ** / ` p\u0252 : r ` me : / `` some man '' , `` a man '' ( when not the topic ), 
  proto-mutish had an inanimate-animate gender system . 
  this system is gone in modern mutish , but there are remnants ( such as demonstratives and pronouns differing for animacy ) , but there is also an inanimate definite article , but it 's considered archaic and is only really used in poetry or a few dialects :, 
  works the same way , triggers either mixed or strong mutation .

  takanaa in hebrew script is wip , since i 'm not too familiar with the script . 
  basic principles : vowels are written as such : / \u0259 / is he ( \u05d4 ) , / a / is alef ( \u05d0 ) , / i / and / j / are both yod ( \u05d9 ) , and / u / and / w / are both vav ( \u05d5 ) . 
  palatalised stops are written as the voiced stops of hebrew : \u05d2 = / k\u02b2 / , \u05d1 = / p\u02b2 / , \u05d3 = / t\u02b2 / . 
  aspirated stops are written so : \u05da = / k\u02b0 / , \u05e4 = / p\u02b0 / , \u05e6 = / t\u02b0 / . 
  retroflex stops are written so : \u05d6 = / \u0256 / , \u05d8 = / \u0288 / ( sometimes they are both written with zayin ),

  the verb * a\u015buk\u0259n\u0259m * `` to remember '' is derived from the verb * \u0259k\u0259n\u0259m * `` to forget '' . 
  it 's usually used in contrast to forgetting . 
  the derivation is irregular , the regular form would be * a\u015bun\u0259k\u0259n\u0259m * , since the * a\u015bu - * prefix does n't assimilate vowels , usually . 
  germany would n't be that difficult since it 's only existed since 1871 . 
  serbo-croatian for `` friend '' is ** prijatelj ** . 
  ** prijatelju ** is the vocative , used when addressing someone .

  breton , hopi , and tewa ( those two are native american languages ) are 3 others , which have non-compound words for non-cardinal directions , so this phenomenon is actually very rare and unique . 
  izhorian : ** lounad ** , ** loune ** , ** louned ** , ** eteel\u00e4 ** - both roots seem to exist , not sure which is more common . 
  `` the south sun '' , or `` the south day '' ), 
  izhorian in this case is interesting , since it 's closely related to karelian , not the neighbouring votic .

  in * crni bombarder * , there is a line :, 
  which is glossed :, 
  * friend-voc old-def . voc from previous-gen war-gen *, 
  so , `` the old friend from the previous war '' . 
  he is talking directly to the old friend , he is addressing him , which is why it 's in the vocative . 
  i ca n't find a translation , but from what i can tell , it 's something like, 
  * but be-3sg . prs/her-gen heart-loc/heart-dat ?? 
  ? , friend-gen own-gen *, 
  google translate gives `` weight '' for * te\u017ee * , but not too sure . 
  it might fit , `` there 's a weight in her heart , of her friend '', 
  often sung at the song festival , as seen [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrbd1ztyniy ) . 
  i like this version , though . 
  the melody is originally from a german folk song , and the words were written by a baltic german pastor - [ martin k\u00f6rber ] ( https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_k\u00f6rber ) .

  notes :, 
  the word * vaimuvara * basically means `` cultural achievements '' or `` art '' , and literally means `` treasure of the mind '' ,, 
  the word * vahvus * technically means `` bravery '' , but to my modern ears it sounds like `` coolness '' ( * vahva * = cool ) , but the original meaning of * vahva * is indeed `` brave '' .
