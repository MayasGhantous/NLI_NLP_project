  the russian government is definitely not friendly to minorities . 
  the situation is better than under stalin , but that does n't say much . 
  estonian , finnish , votic , ludic : ** ja ** , from proto-germanic \\* ja , or \\* jahw . 
  ( ja meant both `` yes '' and `` and '' , - hw was a particle meaning `` and '' , cognate to latin * - que * , only surviving as gothic * - uh * . ), 
  livonian : ** un ** , ultimately from middle low german ** un ** , probably through latvian ** un ** . 
  votic also has ** i ** , which is probably a bit more common . 
  a loan from russian * \u0438 * ( * i * ) . 
  estonian also has ** ning ** , which is a bit less common . 
  \\* niin ( estonian : * nii * ) means `` so '' . 
  * kui * ) means `` as '' , `` if '' . 
  \\* - k\u00e4 was an emphatic particle , not productive in modern estonian . 
  etymology : from middle low german ** un ** . 
  compare german * und * . 
  interesting that latvian borrowed this word . 
  the word * ir * existed before , which still means `` and '' in lithuanian . 
  i wonder if any estonian dialects borrowed it , since livonian also has it . 
  in my russian empire game i kept the capital at moscow . 
  my only possessions in the balkans were basically the black sea coast , including tsargrad , and montenegro , austria owned the rest . 
  i ca n't remember if it renamed it automatically or if i did it myself . 
  from a roleplaying viewpoint , if your focus is the balkans and the middle east , then sure , go for it . 
  if not , from a purely practical viewpoint , i see no reason not to . 
  that 's a different word , * yra * in lithuanian . 
  * ir * in modern latvian means something like `` both x and y '', 
  example : `` n\u0101ca ir jaunie , ir vecie '' - both the young and the old came . 
  interesting . 
  you should update the [ wiktionary page ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ir#latvian ) then , if this usage is archaic . 
  could you comment on the other usages listed there ? 
  are they all archaic ? 
  * ir * meaning `` and '' , yes , but * ir * meaning `` both x and y '' is not said to be archaic . 
  ok , maybe so , but still , a label is missing if it 's archaic . 
  wiktionary usually marks archaic usages with a label in the beginning , as seen [ in the article for `` thou '' ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thou#english ), 
  setos are orthodox , yes . 
  christianised by the kievan rus a couple of centuries before anyone else . 
  they are basically the only religious estonians . 
  v\u00f5ros are not . 
  the old believers on the peipus coast should also be marked . 
  in wiktionary code it would be written { { lb | lv | archaic } } - lv standing for `` latvian '' , and lb standing for `` label '', 
  in wiktionary , `` etymology 1 '' , `` etymology 2 '' etc are used for words that have different origins but are written the same . 
  for * ir * , `` etymology 1 '' is the copula , cognate with lithuanian * yra * . 
  i 'm not talking about this . 
  it just happens to be written and pronounced the same as the other * ir * . 
  `` etymology 2 '' is the conjunction and particle , cognate with lithuanian * ir * . 
  i read out from that page that `` and '' was the old meaning , no longer used , and the current meaning is `` both x and y '' , and an emphatic particle . 
  * speak-agent . ptcp-cop 1sg [ masculine informal ] elk-ess *,

  * tinasa * means both `` deer '' and `` elk '' . 
  if you want to specify , you would say * tinas\u0259mumu * / ` tinas\u0259mumu / , lit . 
  `` deercow '' for elk . 
  elk are n't usually seen in takanata\u015ba , but they are known in stories and folklore .

  why does < r  represent / \u028b / ? 
  or is it < r '  ? 
  cool . 
  yeah , now i see , i forgot about rhotacism in english . 
  my thought process was / r / -  / \u028b / , that 's so strange , but from the perspective of / \u0279 / -  / \u028b / it ai n't so strange . 
  takanaa is mostly symmetrical , marking negation with a negative verb , although in negative sentences the subject can be omitted , as it is always marked in the negative verb . 
  this is rarely done though , since the 1st person pronoun encodes a lot of information : formality , gender , and status of the speaker . 
  in the examples i use the gender-neutral informal . 
  `` i saw him '' : ** inutt\u0259ni\u00feu \u00fei ** / ` inu\u0288\u0259nit\u02b0u ` t\u02b0i / * inutt\u0259-ni-\u00feu \u00fei * * see-pst-3sg . obj 1sg *,

  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl is finnic , and uses basically the same system as finnish : the verb takes the connegative together with the negative verb . 
  the past connegative is the same as the past active participle . 
  finnish has different connegatives for person and number sometimes , this is not the case in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , each tense/aspect has only 1 connegative .

  thanks . 
  it 's a wip . 
  no reason , but yeah , i should be using the final forms . 
  not writing schwa is a good idea , although i 'd only do it in the middle and end of words . 
  otherwise ** \u05e0 \u05db \u05d8 ** would be both / ' \u0259t\u0259k\u0259n\u0259 / and / ` t\u0259k\u0259n\u0259 / . 
  using those final forms can be incorporated into this , so ** \u05d8\u05db\u05df ** would only be / ` t\u0259k\u0259n / . 
  i 'm unsure if i should be writing / a / , / i / , / u / with alef , yod , and vav , or diacritics . 
  there are also / j / and / w / , which are also written with yod and vav . 
  they only occur between vowels . 
  so e.g / ` il\u0259j\u0259 / would be ** \u05d9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4 ** , lit . 
  - jlj\u0259 - or - ili\u0259 - . 
  because there are no consonant clusters or diphthongs , this is read as - i-l-i-\u0259 - initially , but two consonants written together have a schwa inbetween , so - i-l - [ \u0259 ] - j-\u0259 -,

  deemphatic topic ( the bird is the topic , but the fact that it 's a swallow is not important , it might have been something else , but it was probably a swallow though ), 
  deemphatic , not a topic ( the bird is not important at all , the important bit is the fact that something sang ),
