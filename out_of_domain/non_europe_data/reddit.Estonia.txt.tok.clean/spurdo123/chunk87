  i like mafia 1 's system a bit better though . 
  fre was an afterthought . 
  an open world was n't a part of the core design . 
  but yeah , fre was really fun and challenging . 
  still have n't finished all of the challenges .

  * you from : love you i !, 
  * kid from : aswell love me i !, 
  how come you have / \u0279 / , / \u027e / , ** and ** / r / ? 
  are they allophones , or different phonemes ? 
  estonian : ** s\u00f5ber ** . 
  probably a baltic loan , compare lithuanian ** s\u0117bras ** `` companion '' and latvian ** s\u0113brs ** `` friend '' , `` relative '' . 
  other finnic languages :, 
  * votic : ** s\u00f5bra ** , ** druuga ** [ loan from russian * \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 * ( drug ) ], 
  * livonian : ** s\u00f5 ' br\u0101 ** ( borrowed from estonian ), 
  the estonian female version is ** s\u00f5branna ** . 
  it 's used quite often , unlike some other gendered nouns . 
  first off , learn the ipa - the international phonetic alphabet . 
  the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_phonetic_alphabet ) is a good start . 
  scroll down , and there 's a chart of consonants , and further down a chart of vowels . 
  when clicking a symbol , the corresponding article has a sound file of a person pronouncing that phoneme ( sound ) . 
  it will be invaluable in describing how your language sounds . 
  the current system you 're using does n't tell me much . 
   how can i make the forms sound more realistic ? 
  there 's something called the [ sonority hierarchy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sonority_hierarchy ) , which basically says that certain consonant clusters are much more common than others . 
  the consonants closer to the syllable nucleus ( in most cases the vowel , but in some languages a syllabic consonant . 
  maybe you 've heard of czech and its vowelless words , such as * krk * `` throat '' . 
  that / r / is syllabic , it acts as the syllable nucleus . ), 
  tend to be of higher sonority ( there 's a chart of the sonorities of different phonemes in the article ) . 
  there are always exceptions to this hierarchy . 
  for example the english word `` cats '' . 
  the / ts / at the end violates the hierarchy . 
  / t / is less sonorous than / s / , but is closer to the syllable nucleus . 
  you should keep the hierarchy in mind but do n't let it constrain you . 
  but besides that , you 've got a lot ahead of you . 
  even more cool : synonyms that are ultimately from the same root . 
  e.g estonian ** hea ** , ** h\u00e4\u00e4 ** , and ** h\u00fcva ** all mean `` good '' and are all from proto-finnic * h\u00fcv\u00e4 . 
  what 's cool about consonant gradation is that at one point it becomes almost indistinguishable from suppletion . 
  an example from estonian :, 
  ** uba ** / ` ub\u0325\u0251 / `` bean-nom '' - the weak grade ( genitive ) of this is ** oa ** / ` o\u0251 / . 
  in proto-finnic this probably ^ 1 went ** upa ** -  ** uba-n ** . 
  so simply / p / -  / b / . 
  that / b / later became / \u03b2 / and later was deleted in most positions . 
  so then it was * upa * -  * ua-n * . 
  voiceless stops between vowels became lenis in estonian , and final nasals in the genitive were deleted . 
  / u\u0251 / -  / o\u0251 / is less regular , i presume it 's because / u\u0251 / is n't a diphthong in estonian . 
  ^ 1 this particular word might have been * pupa initially . 
  this is regular in estonian , so other words that have the pattern u - ( lenis stop ) - a have the / o\u0251 / weak grade . 
  e.g / ` nu\u0261\u030a\u0251 / `` knife '' -  / ` no\u0251 / . 
  / ` tub\u0325\u0251 / `` room '' -  / ` to\u0251 / . 
  this gets me thinking , are there any languages that use suppletion for noun cases ? 
  estonian and english both do it for verbs and adjectives , but i ca n't think of any nouns . 
  < \u010d  for / t\u0283 / , < \u0161  for / \u0283 / , < \u017e  for / \u0292 /, 
  < c  for / k /, 
  < c  for / ts /, 
  [ \u025f ] , [ \u0281 ] , [ \u0280 ], 
  [ \u0252 ] , [ \u025b ] , [ y ], 
  i was talking about synonyms , so the doublets should have the same meaning . 
  * 1pl go-pst-1pl maternal.uncle.gen-poss-1sg village-ine , it be-3sg . prs world-gen superlative big-comparative village . 
  * we went maternal uncle 's mine village in , it was world 's all bigger village . 
   city, 
  does en\u0142alen not differentiate between settlements of varying sizes ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  interesting nonetheless . 
  nope , estonian . 
  estonian uses < \u0161  and < \u017e  in loanwords , but / t\u0283 / is < t\u0161  . 
  dumb question , but what 's the difference between / aj / and / ai / ? 
  / ` vi ` p\u0252 : r\u00e6g ` t\u0251\u025fi ` o : v\u0251s : \u0259 ` guzd\u025bu /, 
  * many man-pl fat road-ess stroll-perf .3 pl *, 
  * many men fat road in strolled have . 
  the word * vig * also means `` a lot '' , `` most '' , and `` every '' , `` each '' , `` every single '' when the noun is in singular . 
  what do your tenses look like ? 
  i presume your conlang is isolating/analytic ? 
  thanks . 
  the spelling looks weird , but is n't actually that irregular . 
  the biggest irregularities are the letters < v  and < s  which can stand for / v / and / f / , and / s / and / \u0283 / , respectively , mostly irregularly , but usually if the following vowel is long , then they are / f / and / \u0283 / , respectively . 
  there are a lot of exceptions to this . 
  consonant clusters are also irregular . 
  < sn  represents both / sn / and / \u0283n / . 
  they are often simplified . 
  for example : ** vojan ** `` group '' , `` gang '' is / ` f\u0251j\u0251 : / , not / ` v\u0251j\u0251 : / , like expected . 
  and ** suerh ** `` crap '' , `` something that is worthless '' is / ` sy : r / , not / ' \u0283y : r / , like expected . 
  there are other various irregularities , but for most words , if you know all the spelling rules , you can accurately guess the pronounciation . 
  is this conlang finnic/uralic/sami ? 
  i recognise ** labzj ** and ** nimje ** as cognates . 
  ** lap\u0161i : v\u00f6h !, 
  / ' \u0283in\u00e6 ` t\u00e6m\u00e6 ' \u0264 : ` r\u0251t\u0251 /, 
  * lap\u0161i : v\u00f6h !, 
  * child : and [ deemphatic ] what-interrogative this be .3 sg.prs [ surprised clitic ] *, 
  * you : that be-3sg . prs milky.way *, 
  * child : eww !, 
  be .3 sg.prs [ `` maybe '' clitic ] with.a.disgusting.taste , except when.rel be-3sg . subj chocolate-gen taste-com *, 
  the word * rata * originally meant something like `` path '' , `` road '' , `` way '' , but in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , and related languages izhorian ( as * rada * ) and karelian , only means the milky way . 
  votic was/is spoken in the western end of the `` ingrian '' area . 
  and `` olonetsian '' is usually known as livvi or livvi-karelian .
