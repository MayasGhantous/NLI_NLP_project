  mutish . 
  a priori , with initial consonant mutation and a deep orthography . 
  strongly fusional . 
  reminds me of hungarian . 
   connected to the same lettres, 
  the orthography is the same ? 
  hungarian does n't have < gh  though . 
  i 'm not sure if < my  or < ky  are used , but they definitely look hungarian . 
  thanks . 
  i 'm estonian . 
  thanks . 
  yes , that 's true . 
  i was just listing cognates to the estonian word . 
  cognates have the same origin , but often have differing meanings .

  the noun * momsvich * / ` mo : sv\u0259k / `` head of state '' , `` president '' is derived from * moma * / 'm \u0251m\u00e6 / `` country '' , `` state '' , and * vich * / ` f\u0259k / `` head '' , `` figurehead '' , `` leader '' .

  is ghearic a posteriori ? 
  or what 's it influenced by ? 
  cool . 
  i like the capitalised nouns . 
  do you capitalise demonyms ? 
  `` 2007scape '' , `` 07scape '' , and `` rs07 '' were more popular names in early 2013 , when the subreddit was created . 
  the osrs wiki was `` 2007scape wiki '' ( 2007 . runescape.wikia.com ) until very recently . 
  when was the term `` old school runescape '' first used , anyway ? 
  i do n't think it had an official name initially . 
  ah , interesting . 
  i do n't remember that name being used initially ( by players atleast ) though , might just be me . 
  it changed at one point , or there were 2 . 
  there was definitely a 2007 rsps but i remember the 2006 one better .

  depends on what period of history you find more interesting , the middle ages or colonisation and early firearms and artillery ? 
  but besides that , aoe2 is for some reason much more popular . 
  imo it 's a great game but aoe3 is better . 
  personally , i would n't recommend getting the hd version if you do choose aoe2 , imo it looks awful , and my first experience was buggy as hell . 
  aoe1 is also really cool , and i like it a bit better than 2 . 
  the theme is ancient civilisations . 
  if it 's not fun like 3-5 hours in , just give up . 
  the game ai n't for you . 
  although i would suggest lowering the difficulty ( it goes from -100 to +100 , imo 0 at the beginning is too difficult for the first playthrough , but it 's fun as heck on your second one ) . 
  i started at -75 and gradually highered it , currently at pretty much the end of the game , at +50 . 
  the difficulty slider makes a huge difference . 
  it looks great for 2002 . 
  much better than gta 3 or vice city , although comparing these ai n't fair , mafia was developed for the pc , the gtas were developed for the ps2 .
