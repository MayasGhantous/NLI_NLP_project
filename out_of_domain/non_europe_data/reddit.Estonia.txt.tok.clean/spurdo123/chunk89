  biggest gaps in details are the hands . 
  although i do n't know any games from the era with detailed hands . 
  the reason the race was considered so hard is because the original unpatched versions had no difficulty setting . 
  with the patch , it becomes really easy , you can just turn the difficulty down and disable damage . 
  also , it was designed with racing wheels in mind . 
  regarding cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me : ( assassination of don morello ), 
  the mission has 3 endings . 
  the first one is the airport one , that you usually get . 
  you can get the second one by blocking morello from going to the airport , drive left of him . 
  it 's somewhat random , if you 'll get it or not . 
  the third one is less known , and is much harder . 
  [ ] ( #s `` you can kill him on the way , when he opens his window to shoot . 
  his limo is bulletproof but the window can be shot through . 
  the easiest way to do this is to make the driver crash somehow . '' ), 
  i would n't call them clunky . 
  i have n't played 4 or primal though . 
  far cry 1 sort of was `` clunky '' , but not really . 
  1 , 2 , and 3 are all well-done games , but for me they just felt boring . 
  what 're your favourite games ? 
  just curious . 
  strife ( doom engine ), 
  chex quest ( doom engine ), 
  return to castle wolfenstein ( 2001 ), 
   wolfenstein 3d is n't really worth playing unless you just want to see the granddaddy of `` doom clones '' . 
  it 's very dated . 
  idk , i really enjoyed it . 
  the labyrinths are quite unique . 
  doom has some of it , but doom felt much more open to me . 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl / 'm \u0251 : t\u0283i : l /, 
  from ** m\u0101 ** / 'm \u0251 : / `` land '' + ** \u010d\u012bl ** / ` t\u0283i : l\u02b2 / `` language '' , `` tongue '' . 
  cognate to estonian * maakeel * / 'm \u0251 : ke : l / and votic * maat\u0161eeli * . 
  mutish : - ** mutital ** / ` mut\u0259t\u00e6l / . 
  from the root ** muth ** + ** talh ** / ` t\u00e6l / `` language '' , `` tongue '' . 
  the root * muth * is only seen in the ethnonym , it means nothing . 
  out-of-universe , it was influenced by `` mutation '' ( initial consonant mutation is an important feature ), 
  it means nothing , but out-of-universe , it was influenced by finnish * takana * `` behind '' . 
  in-universe , it means `` standard '' . 
  out-of-universe , i got it from asking cleverbot . 
  so i shortened that and added the - as masculine ending . 
  the endonym ( what the speakers of the language call themselves ) is unrelated and varies , but the most common is `` latins '' ( * latinei * , * ladinei * ) ( in this conworld , poland was latinised and influenced the neighbouring baltic tribes a lot . 
  later germanic and slavic migrations forced the romance-speaking folks to migrate and they were assimilated into the baltic tribes ) , or just from the local area - `` prussians '' , `` curonians '' , etc.

   go.by.foot, 
  that 's interesting . 
  could you elaborate ? 
  why did you choose just this verb here ? 
  what other `` go-by-x '' verbs are there ? 
  is there no simple `` to go '' verb ? 
  < i  being / y / is really cool . 
  do you have / i / or / \u026a / ? 
  if so , how do you represent them ? 
  ah , cool !, 
  fascinating .

  notes : * mi\u00e4 * is the `` short '' 1st person singular pronoun and * min\u00e4 * is the `` long '' one . 
  estonian has a similar system , with * mina * and * ma * , although in estonian , the difference is in emphasis . 
  in m\u0101\u010d\u012bl , the difference is in formality . 
  the short one is usually only used in very informal contexts .

  cool !, 
  do you have vowel harmony ? 
  from that text i only noticed / e / together with back-vowels , but finnish , veps , and karelian all have / e / as a neutral vowel . 
  i 've probably never been to certain blocks in western san fierro .
