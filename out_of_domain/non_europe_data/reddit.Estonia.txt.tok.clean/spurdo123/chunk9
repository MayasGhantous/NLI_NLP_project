  there is only 1 irregular verb ( to be ) and around 5 irregular nouns . 
  there is no irregularity in adjectives . 
  all adverbs are formed with the same suffix ( - ul ) added to stem of the adjective ( remove - is or - os , which are the nominative endings for common and neuter gender , respectively ), 
  ** d\u00favas puss\u00edbilei b\u00fatytet : art nos esmi s\u00f3lis in universumat art nos n'esmi . 
  ubes esta lygul terrenses . 
  / ` du : vas pus ` si : bilei bu : ` t\u0268tet ` art ` nuos ` esmi ` so : lis in uni ` versumat ` art ` nuos ` nesmi ` ubes ` esta ` l\u0268gul ter ` renses /, 
  * two possibility [ plural ] exist [ 3rd person singular present ] : either/or we be [ 1st person plural present ] alone in universe [ locative ] or we no-be [ 1st person plural present ] . 
  both [ emphasised ] be [ 3rd person dual present ] equally terrifying [ adjective dual ] *, 
  anything bilabial besides / p / , / b / and / m /, 
  i also find it somewhat difficult to distinguish between / x / and / \u03c7 / . 
  e.g russian supposedly has / x / , but i hear ( and was taught to say ) / h / or at the very least / \u0266 / or / \u0127 / . 
  and when i listen to e.g german , i only hear / \u03c7 / and / \u00e7 / . 
  in terms of vowels , the central vowels are somewhat hard for me to distinguish . 
  / \u0268 / and / \u0259 / are all i can do . 
  yep . 
  my conlang is based on latin and lithuanian mainly . 
  ** common gender nouns in singular : **, 
   nominative : - as, 
   accusative : - am, 
   genitive : - an, 
   locative : - at, 
   dative : - u, 
   vocative - ( no ending ) , or rarely - e, 
  the nominative - as is inspired by lithuanian , the - am for accusative is broadly indo-european , the - an for genitive is inspired by finnish . 
  i do n't remember where i got the - at for locative . 
  the - u for dative is by coincidence similar to russian , but i did n't intend on it . 
  ** common gender adjectives in singular : **, 
   nominative : - is, 
   genitive : - in, 
   locative : - it, 
   dative : - ur, 
   vocative - ( no ending ), 
  ** verb infinitives always end with - ius **, 
  neuter gender nouns always end with - os in nominative , but the rest of the cases declend irregularly . 
  it is - os since the first neuter words were `` deos '' and `` kristos '' , meaning `` god '' and `` christ '' . 
  and since they ended with - os i made it the standard for nominative . 
  ** although neuter gender adjectives do declend regularly : **, 
   nominative : - os, 
   genitive : - o, 
   locative : - ot, 
   dative : - ou, 
   vocative - ( no ending ), 
  it is worth noting that `` o '' is pronounced as / u / in most affixes and in all unstressed situations . 
  * being [ i call it the locative present participle in this case ] be [ 3rd person singular present ] experience worse [ comparative ] than ( usually means `` about '' ) blindness [ locative ] - it be [ 3rd person singular present ] certainty that vision you [ genitive ] be [ 3rd person singular present ] perfect and horror ( also means `` terror '' ) that [ the same construction as in the beginning , but in negative ] world [ accusative ] around you [ locative ] see [ infinitive ] *, 
  * it only frighten [ 3rd person singular present perfect ] five persons death [ dative ] , no-be [ 3rd person singular present ] i [ genitive ] good [ superlative ] work *, 
  `` kyll\u00e4 '' is of finno-samic origin . 
  a sami ( not sure which language though ) cognate `` gal ` le '' exists , meaning `` enough '' . 
  i ca n't find the reconstructed root for this though . 
  cognates include estonian `` k\u00fcll '' ( hard to translate ) , livonian `` ki ' l '' ( the same meaning as estonian , also hard to translate ) , veps `` k\u00fcll\u00e4ine '' ( full stomach , eaten ), 
  * mitochondrion power [ genitive ] house cell [ genitive ] be [ 3rd person singular present ] *, 
  very useful list , 
  i 'll post one , since it demonstrates the dual number nicely . 
  ** the tallest and smallest men in the world both joined the circus . 
  * world [ genitive ] tall [ superlative nominative singular ] and small [ superlative nominative singular ] man join [ 3rd person dual past ] circus [ dative ] *, 
  something to note : the dative of `` circus '' - `` cirkos '' is identical to the nominative when spoken since unstressed `` o '' is pronounced the same way as `` u '' . 
  regular suffixes in the majority of words , but certain words have stem changes . 
  in the case of `` cirkos '' , the dative ( and accusative ) are indicated by the final - os changing into - us . 
  since unstressed `` o '' is pronounced the same as `` u '' , while spoken , nothing changes . 
  here 's `` cirkos '' declended in singular :, 
   ** nominative ** cirkos, 
   ** genitive ** cirku, 
   ** locative ** cirka, 
   ** dative ** cirkus, 
   ** vocative ** cirk, 
  ugnos ? 
  * nature ? 
  fire ? 
  be [ 3rd person dual present ] chaotic [ dual ] and difficult [ dual ] control [ infinitive ] . 
  ice be [ 3rd person singular present ] structured [ adjectival form of the noun `` structure '' ] , latticed [ adjectival form of the noun `` lattice '' ] , light like feather , massive like glacier [ the word for `` glacier '' is a different root from `` ice '' in general since it is derived from a word that means `` thick ice '' - `` ledas '' ] . 
  in ice [ locative ] be [ 3rd person singular present ] power !, 
  i do n't have any words similar to `` bah ! '', 
  yet so i just took the english word and made it fit the rules . 
  `` kyll\u00e4 '' is of finno-samic origin . 
  a sami ( not sure which language though ) cognate `` gal ` le '' exists , meaning `` enough '' . 
  i ca n't find the reconstructed root for this though . 
  cognates include estonian `` k\u00fcll '' ( hard to translate ) , livonian `` ki ' l '' ( the same meaning as estonian , also hard to translate ) , veps `` k\u00fcll\u00e4ine '' ( full stomach , eaten ), 
  some synonyms or alternate forms for `` yes '' in estonian :, 
   variations of `` jah '' - `` jaa '' , `` ja '' , `` jep '', 
   just nii - something like `` just like that '' , estonian `` just '' is also a cognate to english `` just '', 
   repeating the verb , in english : `` is it hot ? '', 
  - `` it is '' . 
  the word `` k\u00fcll '' is also added to the answer sometimes . 
  an unrelated coincidence : the sardinian `` ei '' is exactly the word for `` no '' in estonian, 
  ** ox est stambar in intet . 
  / ` uoks ` est ` stambar ` in ` intet /, 
  * it be [ 3rd person singular present ] bigger in inside [ locative ] *,
