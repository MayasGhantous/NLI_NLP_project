  the diversity is cool , sure . 
  but i really dislike the core mechanics of gta v. driving and shooting were much better in gta iv . 
  gta iv 's story was also a bit superior , imo . 
  the driving is the worst part imo . 
  it 's probably just a shitty port , but one key-press moves the car too much . 
  it 's supposed to be gradual , just like in gta iv and sa/vc/iii . 
  i dislike the new damage system aswell , but it is n't that big of an issue compared to the handling . 
  shooting just does n't feel fun . 
  i loved gta iv 's gunplay , guns felt like they had force . 
  in gta v , i found myself only using the micro-uzi and vintage pistol , but even they felt really weak . 
  the ak was laughably bad , one shot had the sound of 1 and a half or two shots . 
  firing it semi-auto was n't really possible . 
  i loved the heists , but everything else , not so much . 
  what i found really weird was that heists were basically the only missions that gave money . 
  votic and izhorian/ingrian are marked a bit wrong . 
  they are both spoken between the soikinsky/soikkola and kurgalsky/kurkola peninsulas .

  note : nouns that appear to be singular but are semantically plural take plural verb forms . 
  somewhat . 
  the opposite is n't true , so grammatically plural nouns always take plural verb forms .

  i remember reading somewhere of someone who had the theory that every single fallout game 's ending has benefitted the ncr ( shady sands grew into ncr after fallout 1 , ncr expanded a lot after fallout 2 ) . 
  ncr is spread too thin , an ncr victory at hoover dam would most likely be very bad in the long-run .

  it 's loaned from proto-baltic , not lithuanian . 
  a better comparison is latvian * gl\u012bve * , which also means `` mud '' . 
  if this regionalism is near the belarusian border , i 'm guessing it might be a belarusian loanword . 
  ( belarusian * zub * / * \u0437\u0443\u0431 * = `` tooth '' ) . 
  an example from another nominally lutheran country , estonia :, 
  we just call it `` luther 's religion '' ( * luteriusk * ) . 
  the term `` protestant '' is rarely used . 
  * \u017eambas * originally meant `` tooth '' , or probably was a synonym . 
  later the meaning changed to `` sharp edge '' , and apparently became archaic . 
  * dantis * is cognate to english * tooth * and latin * dens * ( genitive * dentis * ) . 
  lithuanian words being similar to latin words is n't uncommon . 
  compare latin * ignis * and lithuanian * ugnis * , both meaning `` fire '' . 
  * earth-ade be-3sg . prs song-part listener-pl-all *, 
  * earth on is song listeners onto . 
  is that phonemic aspiration ? 
  as the title says , i 'm looking for speakers of latin and lithuanian ( russian would also be of help ) to test the intelligibility of it . 
  i have based most of my vocabulary on latin and lithuanian , with some from english , russian and a few from german , i think . 
  i would greatly appreciate it when someone who happened to know these languages messaged me !,
