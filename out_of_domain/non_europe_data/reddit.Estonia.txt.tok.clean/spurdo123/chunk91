  as the title says . 
  for my a posteriori language called `` sernerdas '' , there are quite a few languages where from elements and vocabulary are borrowed . 
  latin and lithuanian are the main ones . 
  here are a few example sentences compared with a natlang and english . 
  for words with an asterisk , i 'm not sure on the meaning of the word in the natlang . 
  * sernerdas : pad\u00e9ne deus , pad\u00e9ne deus , visam latvim tautam, 
  * english : help god , help god , the whole latvian nation/people *, 
  * ipa for conlang : / pade : ne de'us pade : ne de'us ` visam ` latvim ` tautam /, 
  * english : i am a leader *, 
  * ipa for conlang : / e ` go : ` sem kunduk\u0268to : ras /, 
  * english : our father , who art in heaven, 
  * russian : ja idu domoj ( not sure ), 
  * english : i go home, 
  * ipa for conlang : / e ` go : i : tiu ` du : mat /, 
  this is somewhat of an interesting topic i think , since all 3 languages i know do it differently . 
  i would like to know how different conlangs and natlangs handle it . 
  i 'll give examples of what i 'm talking about from natlangs i know :, 
  in english :, 
  ** 0 cats ** - ** 1 cat ** - ** 2 cats ** - ** 5 cats ** etc. 
  in english the noun is in the nominative plural case if it is preceded by a numeral larger than 1 , and with 0 . 
  in estonian :, 
  ** 0 kassi ** - ** 1 kass - 2 kassi ** - ** 5 kassi ** etc. 
  the noun `` kass '' is in the partitive singular case when it is preceded by a numeral larger than 1 , and with 0 . 
  in russian :, 
  nouns preceded by a numeral ending in 2,3,4 are in the genitive singular , and those ending with a number larger than 4 are in the genitive plural . 
  also , the genitive plural is used after certain phrases or words , e.g `` some cats '' is '' \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 '' . 
  please correct me if anything is wrong . 
  so how does your conlang or native language do it ? 
  especially interested in indo-european conlangs , natlangs and pie itself . 
  ( i do n't know the official term for this , so i ca n't easily search for it ), 
  i used to play a lot of eu3 casually , but only recently got around to playing eu4 , since i used to have some stability issues with it . 
  i do n't know if some of the things i will discuss are fixed with newer expansions/patches or with raising the difficulty , since i played on easy/common sense 1.15 . 
  here are a few `` issues '' or complaints i had during my first real game ( currently up to 1700 ) :, 
  1 ) your country is too stable . 
  e.g in eu3 as a big country you always had rebels and you also had pirates , so you could n't really devote your entire army/navy to a war . 
  in eu4 however , i only got rebels in newly conquered provinces , and that went away after coring and converting . 
  no pirates in eu4 , which means you can devote your entire navy to war or trade . 
  i also liked the infamy system of eu3 better ; in eu4 nothing really stopped me from conquering more ; since coring is extremely fast , you can just blob more . 
  in eu3 , you had to wait for your infamy to go down , unless you wanted huge amounts of rebels and other countries attacking you . 
  in eu4 , there are coalitions and ae , but i 've never witnessed this ; i think it might be because the easy difficulty , but i do n't know . 
  ae is supposed to reduce relations , but it only really did with the country i was attacking . 
  ( or atleast i did n't notice an effect on other countries ), 
  2 ) westernising is too easy . 
  i did it as russia , so it should be harder as someone from e.g the chinese/nomadic group . 
  i did n't get any serious rebels , and the events that came with it were mild . 
  this might be because of the difficulty aswell . 
  3 ) the estates feel bland . 
  the bonuses/negatives are somewhat insignifcant and keeping them happy is easy . 
  a few more positive things comparing eu3 and 4 :, 
  1 ) i like the fact that stability is n't tied to your money/tech anymore . 
  in eu3 , as a huge nation , you really could n't get past stability 0 , unless you had a lucky event . 
  although as i was inexperienced , i was always extremely behind on tech ( something to do with the treasury i guess ), 
  2 ) the ai is way better , although this is somewhat obvious . 
  deriving new words from a root is probably my most favourite part about conlanging . 
  mathematically , what is the number of different forms of a root that exist in your language ? 
  what do your derivations look like ? 
  for example i took the root for `` sing '' ( not a particularly productive root ) , and i got the number 18987 , or 27589 if counting negative forms of verbs . 
  that number only consists of 3 adverbs , interestingly enough . 
  a few of the more obscure derivations :, 
   ** kisdainer\u00f3 ** - he must sing normally ( tomorrow , soon , in the future ), 
   ** dainaniumutiukulum ** - to the 2 little albums ( said by a slightly effeminate young boy ), 
  in essence , in what form do you list your verbs ? 
  why did you choose it ? 
  from what i can tell , many natlangs use the infinitive ; but some do n't , e.g latin uses the 1st person singular present indicative , and estonian uses the supine . 
  my conlang uses the infinitive , since it is commonly used and ca n't be derived from any other form without looking it up . 
  but e.g the gerund , supine , and all nominal forms can be , since they are quite regular . 
  i hope this is the right subreddit for this . 
  i 'm not looking to become fluent in the language , just check on some words , or grammar . 
  for example , the word `` apsunkusi '' , i ca n't seem to find anywhere , what it means . 
  i figure it 's a verb ( probably reflexive ) with the ap - prefix , and that 's it . 
  for some reason , material on lithuanian in english seems to be very scarce on the internet compared to f.e latvian . 
  i 'm a skiller and i do n't plan to boss ever , but i want to complete the western provinces hard achievement diary . 
  what skills or gear should i go for to make the kill as easy as possible ? 
  my current stats :, 
  there are plenty of guides for the kill itself , but most seem to focus on efficiency , which is not the case for me . 
  i 've read that i should get a trident , so i 'm currently getting magic up to 75 . 
  but where to go from there ? 
  what kind of grammatical features are there in your conlangs that only exist to enrich the language , and do n't serve a vital role ? 
  ( i.e there are multible ways to mark the same concept ) . 
  i really like this concept ; it 's a really easy and nice way to make the language richer . 
  i 'll start . 
  in takanaa :, 
  * the passive voice , when the agent is marked . 
  * noun incorporation , although it has the purpose of de-emphasising the object . 
  examples :, 
  * active non-incorporated : ** lud\u0259 \u00fei m\u0259tapi ** / ` lut\u02b2\u0259 ` t\u02b0i 'm \u0259tapi / `` i love my sister '' - * love-prs-sg i sister-acc-1sg-poss *, 
  * active incorporated : ** lud\u0259m\u0259t\u0259pi \u00fei ** / ` lut\u02b2\u0259m\u0259t\u0259pi ` t\u02b0i / `` i love my sister '' - * love-prs-sg . sister [ incorporated form ] -1 sg-poss i *, 
  * passive incorporated : ** lud\u0259papam\u0259t\u0259pi \u00feu ** / ` lut\u02b2\u0259papam\u0259t\u0259pi ` t\u02b0u / `` my sister is loved by me '' - * love-pass-prs-sg . sister [ incorporated form ] -1 sg-poss i-abl *, 
  * passive non-incorporated : ** lud\u0259pap \u00feu m\u0259tapi ** / ` lut\u02b2\u0259pap ` t\u02b0u 'm \u0259tapi / `` my sister is loved by me '' - * love-pass-prs-sg i-abl sister-acc-1sg-poss *, 
  in sernerdas :, 
  this results in different ways to mark cases . 
  ( mostly the genitive ) , but also degrees of adjectives . 
  so , the genitive singular of ** vilkas ** / ` vilkas / `` wolf '' can be :, 
  * vilka / ` vilka / [ most common ; normal inflection ], 
  * de vilk / ` de ` vilk /, 
  * dvilk / ` tvilk / [ contracted form of the above ], 
  * vilk \u012bs / ` vilk ` i : s /, 
  * vilkys / ` vilk\u0268s / [ contracted form of the above ], 
  the accusative singular is less diverse :, 
  * vilkan / ` vilkan / [ most common ; normal inflection ],
