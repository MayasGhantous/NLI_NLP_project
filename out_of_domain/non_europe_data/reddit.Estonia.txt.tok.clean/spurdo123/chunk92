  * vilkta / ` vilkta / [ contracted form of the above ], 
  in essence , how is the word for `` fire '' used idiomatically ? 
  i 'll bring 3 examples from my conlangs :, 
  sernerdas is not a very idiomatic language , so there are no special connotations regarding fire . 
  there is a connection with * warmth * though . 
  as seen in the word ** pammiep ** / ` pam : \u02b2ep / * bonfire-all * , meaning `` to warmth '' , `` to a warmer place '' . 
  takanaa equates fire with danger . 
  the word ** xa ** / ` k\u02b0a / means both `` fire '' , and `` danger '' . 
  so , the phrase `` do n't do it ! '', 
  or `` do n't go there ! '', 
  would translate to ** xa\u015b , k\u0259xa !, 
  ** / ` k\u02b0a\u0283 ` k\u0259k\u02b0a / * fire-cop , begone * - i.e `` there is fire , begone ! '', 
  there is also the verb ** isutax\u0259\u0259k ** / isuta ` k\u02b0\u0259k / `` to fall into fire '' ( * xa * is incorpororated into the verb * isutaak * `` to fall '' . 
  ) , which means `` to get into trouble '' , `` to do something bad that will have horrible repercussions later '' . 
  the noun ** xatara ** is derived from * xa * , and means `` bad person '' . 
  `` fire-person '' , `` danger-person '' ), 
  another conlang i 've been working on equates fire with progress , and cleanliness . 
  ** manajats ag bolu moagak ** / 'm \u00e6n\u00e6j\u00e6s : ' \u0251 ' \u03b2\u0251l\u026f 'm \u0252 : j\u00e6g / * we-benefactive the-def-art fire be-3sg-fut * - `` for us the fire shall be '' . 
  this means that there shall be changes , most likely positive . 
  ** polu caumag ** / ` p\u0251l\u026f ` k\u0252 : m\u0251 / * fire forest-gen * - `` forest 's fire '' . 
  this means change , where bad elements are purged to make room for new and good things . 
  i.e some bad things happen , for more good to happen later . 
  ** baji poluja ** / ` b\u00e6j\u0259 ` p\u0251luj\u00e6 / * blood-ess fire-gen * - `` in blood of fire '' - this means that the person is healthy . 
  also related , do you have any syllabic consonants ? 
  ( e.g the / r\u0329 / in serbo-croatian * srbin * / ` sr\u0329bin / `` serb '' ), 
  takanaa has no consonant clusters at all . 
  palatalised stops arose from original stops followed by a diphthong beginning with / i / . 
  sernerdas has quite complex consonant clusters , but does n't have syllabic consonants . 
  the most complex is probably / l\u02b2k\u02b2s\u02b2n\u02b2 / , in ** jelxnes ** / ` jel\u02b2k\u02b2s\u02b2n\u02b2es / `` alder '' . 
  there is also / rktv / in ** arktva ** / ' \u00e4rktv\u00e4 / `` bear 's den '' . 
  initial consonant clusters do n't get that complicated , only 2 consonants at most.e.g / s\u02b2v / , / kr / , / tr / , / sv / , / fr / , etc. 
  m\u0101\u010d\u012bl does n't have that complicated consonant clusters , especially in native words . 
  / \u0283m / , / ps / , / \u0283t / , etc. 
  i 'm not sure if ** virk\u0161ada ** / ` virk\u0283\u0251\u00f0\u0251 / `` to say '' is a native word ( i forgot where i derived it , it maybe a russian loan , i 'm not sure ) . 
  there is also the word ** s\u00f5l\u010da ** / 's \u0264lt\u0283\u0251 / `` back '' , which has / lt\u0283 / , and is native . 
  loanwords are different : / stl / in ** kommunistlin\u00f5 ** / ` kom : unistlin\u0264 / `` communist '' ( adjective ) , / rsk / in ** karsk\u00f5 ** / ` k\u0251rsk\u0264 / `` sober '' , `` healthy '' , from estonian * karske * , from middle low german * karsch * . 
  initial consonant clusters , with the sole exception of / t\u0283 / ( depending on if you analyse it as an affricate or a cluster of / t / and / \u0283 / ) , only exist in loanwords , mainly from russian . 
  e.g ** klatti ** / ` kl\u0251t : i / `` viewpoint '' , `` opinion '' , `` view '' , from russian * \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 * .

  great game , i 've had a lot of fun . 
  played as italy through the tutorial , then invaded yugoslavia and puppeted serbia . 
  then , in late 1938 i attacked greece , even though the allies had guaranteed them . 
  this started ww2 , but i thought heck it . 
  i was eventually overran by the french and an uk naval invasion . 
  i have n't tried actually posting troops to the french border though , but i was doing quite succesfully , but they occupied rome for too long . 
  i had like 40 divisions on the greek border , way too much . 
  i 've got a few questions though :, 
  1 ) why do my armies keep running away from the action ? 
  i 've had to control them manually , which is kind of a pain . 
  2 ) how would i keep control of my colonies ( ethiopia , somalia , libya ) in the event of a world war ? 
  i just do n't see it happening . 
  3 ) are the default divisions fine ? 
  i added some more men to my templates , but i 'm not sure . 
  4 ) what do armies and theatres do exactly ? 
  do they give some kind of bonus ? 
  ( i know the generals do , but is there anything else ? ), 
  also , when france and uk were invading the italian mainland , i could n't figure out how to set a frontline so i just attacked them manually . 
  is there a better way to repel such invasions ? 
  5 ) is there any way to speed up the building of military factories ? 
  they were coming one by one over months , seems kind of slow . 
  6 ) my national focus tree seemed to ran out of useful things , by 1939 . 
  i had n't touched the navy things though . 
  is it acceptable to wait for certain things , or should i always have something focusing , even if it is n't useful to me at that particular moment ? 
  thanks in advance . 
  i 've read some of the tips threads , i 'll try to read more . 
  ** platform ( s ) : pc , online ( shockwave player , probably ) **, 
  had that feeling , more of an online adventure game probably **, 
  ** estimated year of release : mid-to-late 2000s probably . 
  i played it anywhere from 2008 to 2010 , not sure . 
  ** graphics/art style : dated graphics for the time ( top of the notch for early 2000s though ) , dull and dark colours ( ran like butter though , which was nice ) 3d with a behind-the-character view . 
  i do n't think you could manually rotate the camera . 
  ** notable characters : the player character was a knight , with dark-grey armour . 
  i remember a sorceress in a castle , but i 'm not sure . 
  ** notable gameplay mechanics : you started in a forest near a castle , you could go to the castle , and from there you could go into a dungeon of sorts , open chests and gain loot . 
  i do n't remember the combat though . 
  ** other details : possibly had the name `` dungeon '' in it .
