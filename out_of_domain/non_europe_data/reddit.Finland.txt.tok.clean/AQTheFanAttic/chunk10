  i also think we should go with the capitals we originally decided .

  or 15:00 if you 're in eet . 
  46 motherfuckers, 
  yeah it 's pretty great . 
  you 're right . 
  one civ needs to have found every other civ . 
  yeah . 
  some areas like north america or northern asia really need them . 
  rvb reference spotted holy crap i love this guy, 
  one war per page . 
  but what happens when those units get killed ? 
  it 's possible that those currently warring will kill them . 
  it 's happened before . 
  well , finland is an underdog in the top 10 . 
  which is awesome . 
  and r/finnittowinit is somewhat active but it could use more active people ( like you ) :d, 
  rome is still in war against spartans are n't they ? 
  same with ashanti and mali . 
  fair enough . 
  finland because we _ will _ kick sibir 's ass eventually . 
  also underdog . 
  yakutsk is still too east in my opinion , maybe put a cs in ural or something . 
  a city-state in finland ? 
  i hope we 're using another map then . 
  also nort asia cs should be west of yakutsk . 
  see , that 's where you go wrong . 
  you are n't here representing the filipino people , you 're here representing their government . 
  and that does n't exist anymore . 
  and this is exactly what he is talking about . 
  ooc the eliminated people should just change civ . 
  any civ . 
  like the freaking zulu or something . 
  it does n't have to be australia or sparta or mali or anything like that . 
  just remove the limit of one delegate per state and people like u/lacsiraxariscal can switch to whatever their new/second favorite civ is . 
  autocratic nations are us , australia and sibir . 
  i 'm the only one who 's really active out of those . 
  come on now . 
  i watched that on saturday . 
  frankly , i think not . 
  the list seems nice although i do n't know about the suggestions . 
  sure , we 'll look at some new fonts for the next part , 
  sounds good . 
  at first glance that seems a bit too op . 
  which governs what exactly ? 
  three triremes ? 
  that paradrop ability though . 
  not fun , op . 
  the same time the ai declares war the territory gets filled with mechanized infantfies . 
  wait how the hell does that even work ? 
  that is n't very professional of you . 
  the majority voted yea and therefore the majority likes the law . 
  is the sg not supposed to be neutral at everything ? 
  or am i completely wrong in this ? 
  domination , cultural and diplomatic i 'd say . 
  holy fuck you used rallienglanti . 
  i love you . 
  `` rally english '' , the finnish term for finglish . 
  yeah i fixed it , i accidentally left the original head class in . 
  fair enough . 
  everyone dies . 
  oh wait they will anyway . 
  yes please :3, 
  there is n't anything that could discover the tile . 
  you 'd need a submarine but you ca n't get over there since it 's surrounded by land . 
  just say and i 'll give the sub to ya . 
  being a mod is pretty simple especially with a small sub like that and there 's great tutorials at places like r/csshelp/wiki / index . 
  *** updates : ***, 
  * new look !, 
  ( courtesy of u/thefrowntownclown ), 
  *** the war room team is : ***, 
  * u/mazerlazer - the reviver, 
  * u/thefrowntownclown - the writer, 
  * u/mrklonam - the invaluable helper, 
  * u/lordfowl - the pr guy, 
  * and yours truly - maker of the docs, 
  on behalf of the whole team , i hope you enjoy . 
  yes . 
  spawn the sub in somewhere well hidden and then delete your other units . 
  also remember to reveal the map . 
  which step ? 
  i do n't agree with these points but as he has assaulted me several times by calling me a lazy reindeer boy i agree . 
  ( this is pure rp even though it happened ooc , i do n't actually mind ), 
  other subs ? 
  hell no . 
  this has nothing to do with matters outside the congress . 
  unless you approach the more inactive delegates in the br sub . 
  i 'd love some , my fellow fascist . 
  would anyone like to write a quick rundown for the superior nations who do n't have time for shenanigans like this ? 
  well good fucking job .
