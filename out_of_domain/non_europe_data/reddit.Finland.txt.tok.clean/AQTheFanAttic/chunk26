  we have too many mods, 
  and thus , the american rp falls apart once again . 
  just one respect ? 
  anyway , f ^ ^ ^ ^ uck f ^ ^ ^ ^ ace, 
  yeah proletariat went on a spree in november or something and added like five new mods . 
  now over half of the active community are mods . 
  but yeah , i can make you one , i guess . 
  which colours and what text ? 
  greenland is * a lot * closer to america than europe though . 
  this ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^, 
  their cities took damage ? 
  that does n't really matter at all , they 'll heal in just a few turns ... 
  i thought we were n't forming coalitions yet ? 
  yeah but you and me said to stop doing that , did n't we ? 
  and the general consensus was that we will finish game 1 first . 
  read my new post pls, 
  the leader selection has been * really * disorganized , all it 's been is `` can i have x '' `` yeah sure '' . 
  there has n't even been any announcement that it can be done . 
  it 's unfair for us who do n't think of game 2 as that relevant right now . 
  now 's not the time to arrange game 2 coalitions ; now 's the time to finish game 1 . 
  after it 's done , we have plenty of time to arrange them . 
  yes . 
  this is exactly what i 'm talking about . 
  well that 's what i want to happen . 
  ohhhhhh . 
  this is why we 're not getting new people in ... 
  yeah no , the power was online long before rival was captured . 
  i 'm sorry i 'm shitting on your rp like this . 
  do n't worry , my friend . 
  this was just some yankee propaganda . 
  the power was already online even when rival was captured , remember ? 
  there 's two options :, 
  we shot them down before they landed . 
  they did n't actually do anything . 
  i * think * they wanted to ask about the new release schedule . . ? 
  yeah they were probably citadels . 
  is n't this hawai'i based on the natives , though ? 
  does / u/limerickarcher know about this ? 
  what kind of impact does this have ig then ? 
  if the virus is purely biological , it was destroyed by the radiation in the fallout . 
  nanobots are nothing but a few atoms , alpha radiation is shitloads of positively charged helium ions flying at high velocities . 
  beta radiation is electrons . 
  they would absolutely destroy nanobots . 
  right . 
  keep in mind that radiation against microscopic nanobots is a lot more devastating than radiation against humans . 
  the fallout is definitely taking its toll , but now it 's made us basically immune against something much more dangerous . 
  it 's quite ironic , really . 
  exactly . 
  you should 've used more nukes , shandy . 
  i think so ? 
  seems like he 's too scared of real war . 
  except that it does , did n't you read my previous posts ? 
  radiation wrecks havoc on your nanobots . 
  the others seem to have \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  it does n't really matter , since you went mad with nukes we 've got radiation everywhere . 
  except that you 're not . 
  mergers were discontinued though , remember ? 
  woah, 
  that was unexpected . 
  also i might be jealous , you never know . 
  yeah i know who lungora is . 
  aw man , you missed my edit did n't you ? 
  beautiful . 
  absolutely beautiful . 
  it 's just that there was a major plothole in the plot . 
  the power had already returned when you walked into paris . 
  but ... aw man ... 
  mob could 've easily turned it back on if he were ever in power . 
  besides , even if it was n't when you came , it sure had returned before the rescue team came , which is actually the point i worded poorly earlier . 
  i wanted to mess with you but you did n't give me a chance : c, 
  i do n't think i 've never specified my gender though ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  haha, 
  hahahaha, 
  i still got you, 
  i fucking got you, 
  lol, 
  yeah but that was pretty much integral to the plot was n't it ? 
  i do n't think any were launched on paris though ? 
  i could be wrong . 
  yeah i should add that in, 
  \\  eerie silence, 
  \\  suddenly , stats, 
  \\  more silence, 
  ... i should probably go to sleep ... 
  `` forced into vassalage '', 
  that 's funny , all i remember from that was you coming onto our doorstep begging for protection . 
  i am , just not with my phone ... 
  why do i suddenly have the feeling the same shit will happen all over again in game 2 ? 
  i 'm sure there 'll be plenty of loopholes to abuse . 
  that being said , i 'm really looking forward to how the new coalitions will look like . 
  not yet . 
  i 'll get one this year when i go to high school though . 
  but it 's a lle though . 
  but the point is if they do n't accept , they 're going to be really heavily punished . 
  do n't sweat it . 
  except what you created are n't viruses , they 're nanorobots , as you 've stated multiple times . 
  tell me , how do you create a purely biological nanorobot that is the same size as a virus but more resilient to everything ever anyway ? 
  who ? 
  oh great , this is just what the world needed . 
  another trigger-happy official who thinks they have power .
