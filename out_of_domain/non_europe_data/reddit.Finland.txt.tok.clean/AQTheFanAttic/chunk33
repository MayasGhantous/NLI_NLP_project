  do you have extended timeline ? 
  it 's great . 
  yeah that 's what got me in the game . 
  i 'm starting a vanilla game now though because starting from the year 100 or something it takes fucking forever for anything to happen . 
  or maybe from 300 ? 
  it starts from 2 ad . 
  and rome . 
  also am a total noob who has no idea what 's going on with combat . 
  thanks .

  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ we ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ our ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ revenge ... 
  friendly reminder that said unit must exist before gifting it , 
  what first game ? 
  the poc ? 
  we never had flairs for it in the first place . 
  invasion ? 
  settling lands habited by nomadic tribes is an invasion now ? 
  what would they be used for ? 
  even the chg1 flairs are fairly obsolete now . 
  ten bucks says the papal states will start using the roman flair if we add it :p, 
  i 'm not an osman . 
  and look what happened , north america ~ ~ would have ~ ~ got rekt ~ ~ if the boring cultural victory was n't on ~ ~ . 
  ( yeah that happens . ), 
  maybe it 's about the part with the plots ? 
  stealing buildings with fucking helicopters ... xd, 
  ( yeah it is , especially when i 'm pretty sure it 's called pula ig . ), 
  what if it 's an academy ? 
  well we do n't have education , so no universities . 
  does n't exclude you though :p, 
  hear , hear !, 
  ... yay . . ? 
  colloquially known as `` rallienglanti '' or `` rally english '' . 
  pls no, 
  pls no, 
  did n't stop you before :d, 
  i do trust you somewhat in all seriousness though . 
  y-yeah . 
  a joke . 
  hehe ... 
  or raze it . 
  if they get rid of it , then rome is their only city and they can call themselves rome !, 
  it 's the perfect solution . 
  genoa thanks her allies for coming to her aid . 
  good 'cause the part is done . 
  internet relay chat chat ? 
  the rise of kek has n't happened yet ... :3, 
  that was a completely different era in terms of the drivers ' security though . 
  and i 'm the imperator !, 
  village chief ? 
  briusky is ded, 
  so cossack is the ruler of rome ? 
  was about to ask the same thing . 
  pc + nintendo consoles is an amazing combo . 
  pc as main platform and nintendo for the great exclusives . 
  what are these `` germany '' and `` holland '' countries you speak of ? 
  one party government and media censorship for example . 
  does the us count as a first world country ? 
  considering they are an integral part of every communist regime ever , it does n't really matter if some book stating their ideals did n't say they are . 
  so there 's no 2nd world , just 1st and 3rd ? 
  never knew . 
  i thought the americas are the 2nd world . 
  ... what ? 
  man who would 've known a city-state would prove so problematic ? 
  holy shit you 're right !, 
  considering it 's prolet i guess it was to be expected . 
  except that one time when you did something that i 'm not going to swim through hundreds of modmail messages to look up . 
  there is something i swear, 
  i did n't say to stop , 
  * must ... * * resist ... * * urge ... *, 
  just wait five parts . 
  / u/mrklonam / u/canadian _ christian, 
  it 's nothing to do with english , someone just said pulla and then it stuck . 
  i 'm on top of you in the mod hierarchy so it 's pula because i say so . 
  when i type `` pau '' , it autocorrects it to `` paska '' . 
  i think not !, 
  so was i. 
  except that i was here before you . 
  see for yourself . 
  boom unmodded . 
  just kidding but i could do that . 
  like right now . 
  i would do it but i do n't want the shitstorm to rain on me . 
  but case in point it 's pula . 
  you wo n't be able to change it no matter how hard you tried . 
  so you admit it 's pula ? 
  hmm ... 
  [ nope . 
  it 's pula . ], 
  do n't blame me , blame cossack for adding all the mods :3, 
  one of us !, 
  one of us !, 
  one of us !, 
  one of us !, 
  quite fitting of the whole situation . 
  cossack mods a user and said user does n't even know why . 
  [ exactly . ], 
  wait you 're leaving * now * ? 
  what the hell is happening here o_0,
