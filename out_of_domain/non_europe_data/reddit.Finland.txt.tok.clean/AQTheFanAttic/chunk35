  among other things . 
  this time i was talking about their `` liberation '' of the fea ... 
  yeah i noticed in the part that basically all of sahara was suddenly full of farms . 
  so it 's just a glitch . 
  and even then they won questionably . 
  they 're gon na liberate the papal states that 's why lego joined austria it all makes sense now, 
  and nice .

  probably ca n't be done but we can try . 
  uhh ... something . 
  i 'm a budding coder but i 've never touched lua .

  the neapolitans are mad . 
  things continue as planned . 
  you missed one candidate . 
  / u/thyreformer . 
  it was klonam , was n't it ? 
  actually yeah , when you become leader then the pau wo n't exist anymore . 
  that 's been like that for a while now . 
  not sure how long though . 
  ... really ? 
  shit happens amirite ? 
  huh . 
  feels like it has been longer than that . 
  yeah you 're right . 
  i checked . 
  i guess i just looked at it for the first time right after it was changed and assumed that it 's been there for a while . 
  come on . 
  they 'll take it within 10 turns . 
  unless they made peace and i missed it . 
  neverrrrrrrrrr !, 
  you ca n't take an entire nation with paratroopers alone . 
  the only reason finland even kept that arabian city was because sri lanka was blocking it . 
  i thought it was that the finnish attack on the mughals is pointless ? 
  they do now , but they did n't in arabia . 
  there you go . 
  it 's not too late though . 
  what ? 
  okay . . ? 
  wait . 
  you think that was our plan ?
