  ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, 
  are you signing shit behind our backs ? 
  sure . 
  oh right . 
  that raises a good question . 
  in what order do the actions happen ? 
  no you . 
  i 'll die soon anyway . 
  after all this time , we have finally reunited !, 
  finally !, 
  not even close !, 
  ** i 'm going to destroy everything you love ... **, 
  oh hey , sardinia-piedmont would like to merge with the ottomans . 
  nope . 
  it 's fine . 
  the pau was n't ? 
  except that you had really bad rp for it . 
    do mergers still take two turns ? 
   no , that would n't fall under the `` all restrictions are lifted '' , would it ? 
   so free-for-all . 
  we changed rules in the middle of last game too . 
  by disallowing mergers . 
  thus i do n't see a problem here . 
  dude you do that only after the day is over . 
  post this again tomorrow . 
  i ai n't even mad . 
  because i know someone else is . 
  it was fun . 
  oh yes that is a great idea . 
  yeah sure . 
  perhaps . 
  so you merged without talking about it with anybody else ? 
  sounds fishy . 
  would the kingdom of two sicilies be interested in joining the commonwealth ? 
  banned, 
   / u/dan _ sickles how 's that ? 
  yeah looks like it . 
  is it though ? 
  how can we know you 're not lying ? 
  he could lie too . 
  you do n't have any proof , do you ? 
  well we ca n't really let the merger pass if it has n't been thought out beforehand . 
  it does n't matter , you do n't just go `` hey we 're merging with these and these nations is that okay with the people of said nation '' . 
  you need to do some planning . 
  also you were at war with venice literally last part so that ai n't happening . 
  rip inbox . 
  was fun fucking with y' all . 
  it 's just a prank bro, 
  m8 mergers are banned , what are you talking about ? 
  the mod team , mostly prince and emerald . 
  i do n't know , bullying at school is pretty different from making up fake rules in an internet game . 
  limdows ? 
  as nothing irreversible happened , i do n't find it a big deal . 
  but apologies if it went too far . 
  it was more like you reacted so extremely , we had to keep it going for a little longer . 
  limos x ? 
  yeah i really like limos x. 
  that or limos x. 
  * rocky theme music *, 
  what about ridiculous maintenance costs ? 
  hmm ... not bad . 
  not bad at all . 
  top five top five top five top five, 
  ` cuz polar bears, 
  deez r gr8 but dont do so many of dem or else no1 will read dem, 
  so , sardinia is now lead by an adorno , right ? 
  he 's the son of both , right ? 
  / u/canadian _ christian / u/mrklonam you guys are getting reinforcements !, 
  damn columbo is already really old . 
  the current doge of genoa is the brother-in-law of his son . 
  surely you 'll figure it out . 
  what, 
  me and i was klonam 's son . 
  although i do n't know if they 'll change it now . 
  that was pretty vague though . 
  is she ? 
  somebody needs to make a visual family tree . 
  i 'm glad i knew about this beforehand . 
  also it 's agostino adorno . 
  and we need to have the tarro side in there as well . 
  to be brutally honest i did n't even need it until now . 
  i love the bass so much in that . 
  it ok, 
  onwards !, 
  to battle !, 
  together we shall show those barbarians the true meaning of ** patience ** !, 
  happy birthday all the same !, 
  he 's running it atm . 
  edit : the part . 
  he 's running the part . 
  not just casually running . 
  good job . 
  e is for eternal bloodbath . 
  i get it and i was born 2000 . 
  i see what you did there . 
  damn you we were so close, 
  finnish-korean alliance against vietnam would be the most glorious thing ever .
