  yeah . 
  that along with the genocide our enemies committed basically sealed the deal . 
  and canada . 
  and most of the us . 
  and they still had 200 tourism . 
  was it bugged ? 
  most likely . 
  was it actually 2000 ?!? 
  yeah it was * definitely * bugged . 
  this might actually work ... 
  you need to send them to me first . 
  hope . 
  what if you sent it in fragments ? 
  or via email ? 
  okay email wo n't work . 
  genius, 
  god damnit, 
  yes but if you sent me some of it , then i tell you when i have it , then you delete it and upload a new fragment ? 
  it 's inconvenient as fuck , but it should work . 
  no hurry . 
  yeah sure . 
   finland in the hybrid game, 
  yes pls, 
  crisis averted ? 
  i thought antarctica does n't have any permanent residents , so would n't that make it the lowest average iq ? 
  * looks at flair * i 'm sorry ; ~ ;, 
  i think the ancient-style world map was a cool idea . 
  i 'll look into it , thank you friend !, 
  edit : my mind is clear now . 
  all i need to do is let go . 
  but ... 
  but ... what will they do to me there ? 
  forced war ? 
  damn , you beat me to it :p, 
  milk cartons or bust . 
  ... that border australia . 
  i thought this was / r/shittyaskscience , not / r/circlejerk, 
  well they would be near the irl location . 
  the capital would n't be exactly there but the nations as a whole would be where they need to be . 
  besides , i doubt anybody 's going to miss an opportunity like constantinople . 
  because it would suck to have your game ruined in part 1 because of dumb ai . 
  i know dumb ai is part of the fun , but that would be too much . 
  ooc i did n't like what happened to the papal states last time ; this would prevent it . 
  also it 's more fun this way . 
  i think they 're affiliated with fullscreen ? 
  oh i get it now, 
  well you * just * posted it :p, 
  quite . 
  quite . 
  what happened ? 
  ouch . 
  i suppose knee-length pants might help as well ? 
  and bnw already has all the stuff g&k did . 
  remove viet , mongol and buccs from the premises 11.5 . best day of my life, 
  the kekkonen hath been awakened !, 
  come hither boys , today we shall go to war !, 
  also civ vi, 
  you saw nothing, 
  it was a typo, 
  i swear, 
  well , having both gets you `` just '' the extra civs ( and some maps ? 
  i ca n't remember anymore ) . 
  there 's been discussion on a dump from the massive rollback that happened last december as well . 
  some people say that it would create too many `` what if '' - scenarios , but personally i 'd love to see them during the transition between mk ii and mk iii , for example . 
  yeah , they rolled to their other side on their sleep and mali got squished under them . 
  also we 're stronger than them army-wise :p, 
  kekkonen goes fishing, 
  #for mongols, 
  wow holy shit . 
  impeccable timing . 
  i just read it as well . 
  \\ #triggered, 
  :p i do n't mind anyway , i asked for it . 
  well shit . 
  agreed . 
  i was a little shocked as well when i saw the screenshots at first , but i started liking them very quickly . 
  and if i 'd have to take a bet , i would put my money on the community as a whole growing custom to it if not before , then soon after the game 's release . 
  if it 's going to be good , that is . 
  uhhhhhh ... 
  no :p, 
  with the district system , that 'll very likely happen :d, 
  < _ < ^_^  _  v_v, 
  \u1559\u0295\u0ca0\u1d25\u0ca0\u0294\u1557, 
  i miss the globe view from iv , i hope they do that again in vi . 
  or , they could also have nothing to do with each other . 
  just a thought . 
  i like the style even as is , but this is really good !, 
  i hope they at least reduce the saturation just a notch . 
  ^ except ^ that ^ they ^ wont . 
  ^ because ^ they 're ^ all ^ dead . 
  same , i shall unite with my brethren once more . 
  may be . 
  ouch !, 
  remove romans from premises !, 
  i was a greek god , but i chose to give up my immortality in order to pursue my life-long dream : rekting hellenes as a barbarian . 
  sparta ... you 've doomed us all . 
  / u/thyreformer, 
  brothers , we need a sub to hold our war counsils in so we can annihilate hellenes . 
  he 's going to be the mouth though . 
  he 's still going to be loud .
