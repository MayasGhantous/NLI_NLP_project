  agur 's pole hits gunthor straight to the chest and penetrates his heart . 
  agur keeps riding to the end of the field , before turning around and making a majestic pose . 
  the bystanders go wild . 
  `` the old chief is dead !, 
  long live the chief ! '', 
  agur rides to gunthor 's bleeding body , takes the emblems of the chief from him and puts them on . 
  the crowd cheers and applauds him . 
  agur silenced them with his hand . 
  `` my people !, 
  we have a lot to do if we ever wish to be something .
