  i 'll do that . 
  you can now because why not . 
  nope . 
  not like there was much room for them anyway . 
  you ca n't . 
  well * technically * it 's not in africa , for example the british raj . 
  they 're in africa here because india does n't exist on the map . 
  do you have a better suggestion ? 
  only thing it 's good for is deporting people and natural resources , of which russia has enough already . 
  i do n't find it necessary . 
  it could be done , but the problem is that it would need to be done . 
  in addition , we would have to decide how much gold and troops we 'd give them , and then somebody wants it to fluctuate and it would be a pain in the ass . 
  and i do n't know , i never questioned the current setup . 
  i think it 's kind of cool . 
  but if the majority wants to change it , it will be changes . 
  i 'm doing some tweaks anyway . 
  civ v does n't really simulate manpower , so i think it 's fine . 
  but my opinion is just one among the others . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ suppose ^ ^ ^ ^ he ^ ^ ^ ^ could ^ ^ ^ ^ technically ^ ^ ^ ^ rename ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ whole ^ ^ ^ ^ country ... 
  you can pm me as well ? 
  or do you wish to make your actions public ? 
  the city is named bulgaria because of the country , why do you want to name your whole country after a city ? 
  nope , that 'll happen turn 1 probs . 
   40 pop is unbalanced . 
  history is not fair . 
  boom . 
  and yet again , i can still nerf stuff . 
  so if there, 
  an agreement , it shall be done . 
  noted, 
  now . 
  / u/princedetalleyrand is still playing i think . 
  at least they 're still around . 
  i do n't think finland will do as badly as everyone think they will . 
  sweden took the initial offense , but the boer 's advance will end it quickly . 
  meanwhile , sibir * could * have done serious damage , if not for the vietnamese dow , which will make them occupied . 
  if by winning you mean be reduced to a city-state , then congratulations :p, 
  well , at least the swedes will be crushed just as quickly . 
  no one will bother to stand up to the walls of dvin , so i suppose you 're right . 
  because you ... 
  are irrelevant now . 
  your screams heard only inside your own walls . 
  your abs only used for homesteading . 
  never again war . 
  and leg days skipped due to lack of attendees . 
   claiming all we can, 
  so , nothing ? 
  it is n't looking that unlikely . 
  in the 10 turns after our collapse , we will recarpet though . 
  nvm , i thought you said 10 turns after our collapse for some reason . 
  so yeah . 
  meanwhile sweden has nothing  , 
  you mean lose it to the boers ? 
  because you 're gon na lose just as hard as us . 
  if not harder . 
  we 're losing hard at the same time pretty much . 
  and you guys nuked the boers so peace ai n't happening very soon . 
  and we have the exclaves . 
  huh . 
  hello , and welcome to the interim hybrid game , narrated by the one and only / u/icelandbestland !, 
  events are being made by / u/canadian _ christian , he will post them to your respective subs soon . 
  as before , coalition choices are due in 72 hours . 
  check out the top sticky and wiki for rules and details . 
  i did , check out the tooltips on the respective slides . 
  i guess that 's the surprise ? 
  yeah , sadly ige has its limits . 
  what about a mass immigration crisis as most of india moves to mainland britain ? 
  i fixed it before it went out :d, 
  that might help , i 'll give it a shot . 
  the problem is giving them the food , they 're on the edge of the map with other cities nearby so they do n't have that many tiles . 
  no , since all ai wars are stopped automatically . 
  they were doing the usual cs stuff aka spamming me with quests until i turned the notifications off :p, 
  to quote emerald :, 
   40 pop is unbalanced . 
  history is unfair . 
  they did n't ask though . 
  yup , it 's 100g and it 's in da rulez . 
  this is * more * than a video game . 
  or less , depending on your point of view i guess . 
  yes because their biggest city is starving to death for no reason rp-wise . 
  metadealing, 
  0 i think . 
  at least the one city-state that i checked had 0g and 0 culture . 
  40 pop is 30,6 m people . 
  20 pop is 4,3 m. 
  and going, 
  pau can not into relevant, 
  can confirm also, 
  i 've done it in the past , that would be hypocritical and rude of me if i did that without warning . 
  that said i will do that if this continues . 
  i will tolerate it for this part at least , but it wo n't last forever . 
  frigates 643 , ironclads 806 . 
  edit : prices are actually correct now . 
  weird , have n't received them . 
  so * that 's * where it 's checked from . 
  ig it actually varies from civ to civ and i checked it from there . 
  i suppose gb has wonders that reduce it . 
  yup . 
  yup !, 
  uhmm ...
