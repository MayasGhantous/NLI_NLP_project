  the ottomans did n't mention a thing about it , both parties need to have it in their actions for it to happen . 
  and i did n't see it either , or else i would have put it in . 
   and i did n't see it either , or else i would have put it in . 
  i meant the event there , probably was n't very clear . 
  yeah , why not !, 
  i did n't insult them , they were so good i did n't even have to roll . 
  i 'm really sorry , i mixed up the soviet rebel plot ( involved moving your troops ) with that plot . 
  in other words forgot to do it ...  - <, 
  if you are still at war with them next part , i 'll do it for free . 
  well where would you like the money , then ? 
  a billion gold is a big amount of money for one worker to carry . 
  but if it already costs gold , then ... 
  i will . 
  til not to do this stuff in the middle of the night ... 
  whoa . 
  genoa stronk op spy network win game not some weird cheap milan vc, 
  happy cake day , and for the future , if you say the plot is secret , it wo n't be revealed . 
  as am i. 
  all , since there was no revolution ? 
  what do you even do with it :p ig you 're just a worker, 
  i do n't think you picked one . 
  look . 
  giving you the money is just extra work for me . 
  it 's not much , yes , but you do n't do anything with it . 
  ig you 're a worker amongst like nine other workers in a glacier surrounded by mountains . 
  irp you 're one of the biggest nations on earth . 
  rp you have the money . 
  ig it does n't matter at all . 
  that said though special events sound like a great idea . 
  yes . 
  perhaps . 
  i 'm at work anyway . 
  the fuck did i just read, 
  boooo, 
  i 'd like it if i were told what the [ redacted ] 's are . 
  'cause you know , secrets and all that . 
  good point . 
  if you want advice , maybe a map that has the eu4 provinces as a template instead of irl countries could work better , since there 's more of them . 
  it might be a little more work , but with better results . 
  he did not . 
  you can do with them what you wish . 
  perhaps it would be more balanced if you created them . 
  nope, 
  i 'll manage .

  oi do n't sass me mister / s, 
  i do n't see it . 
  besides if you chose the event , wo n't that have meant you 'd break your promise to france and attack free spain ? 
  the plots were if _ you _ dow them , not the other way around . 
  noticed that during the 4 times sweden attacked russia when running the part . 
  well at least their plot with the gatling guns failed due to you anticipating it . 
  i do n't know , i guess your ai just said fuck it . 
  and they got good rolls . 
  the plots are a lot about luck , putting in resources just increases chances . 
  will do . 
  i did add them . 
  the farms are there , i even changed the tundra under them into grasslands . 
  ige seems to have issues with population changing , when i dropped warsaw down to 1 pop it froze the game and i had to restart . 
  it could be that it just did n't register it for some reason . 
  i will doublecheck though and add them for the next part if it truly did n't do it this time . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ blame ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ game, 
  i think it should , since getting attacked is something you want to deal with asap . 
  of course one can do otherwise , it only requires saying it . 
  you picked 3 , right ? 
  some people had bad shit happen , some people had good shit happen . 
  germany got a city drop down to 1 pop and the brits would 've lost the city if they had n't forgotten to submit their choice , which i will do next part by the way . 
  ca n't really decide for him . 
  and i will make option 2 happen next part . 
  which they did . 
  god damnit mob, 
  because sibir dow 'd us . 
  if it 'd been just finland & boers v. finland , things would be a whole lot different right now . 
  ... what ? 
  the pot should n't call the kettle black ...

  oh god i did n't capitalize `` part '', 
  germany has a bunch of aa guns now . 
  units did flip . 
  right now due to the rebel civs being on like reneissance and some even classical , the cs 's are on the same level as our less advanced major powers . 
  oh action points . 
  you did n't specify that so i assumed you meant gold for some reason . 
  alright i 'll nerf . 
  that 's a dumb mechanic by the way . 
  how about making a limit on how many plots one nation can launder ? 
  it 's slightly op . 
  exactly my thoughts .
