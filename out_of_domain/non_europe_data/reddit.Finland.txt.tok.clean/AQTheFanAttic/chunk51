  besides civ v does n't even have an alliance mechanic . 
  / u/emeraldrange, 
  nope , i 'm just saying it 's pretty hard to declare an alliance in civ v in-game when alliances do n't exist in civ v. 
  i do n't think you can even declare dps in ige , so if canadian is doing them ig now , then he 's somehow using the trading system , which , compared to just declaring war in ige if the other party is declared war on , is pretty difficult . 
  why are we overcomplicating this so much ? 
  * / u/megaashinx1 's flair here *, 
  it 's because they 're winning and no one is doing anything about it ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i never spotted that then , or is that a new thing ? 
   implying our enemies give a shit about rp, 
  you do n't seem to give two shits about it , so ... 
  yeah ^ it ^ does ^ also ^ you ^ just ^ metagamed ^ the ^ shit ^ out ^ of ^ us, 
  that 's all you saw ? 
  well , there 's a list of parts in our discord , i do n't think we have made an imgur compilation for reddit for this game yet . 
  i suppose you could go to the post history of / u/canadian _ christian and look up the parts from there . 
  oh yes , let them think that we are just the one civ who is getting beat up by kilwa ... 
  it 's all fine , we are definitely harmless ... 
  inb4 lego defects to fsa with all our shit, 
  honestly , at this point , i would n't even be surprised . 
  what 's with the summons ? 
  i was going to make a remark about how you 're fucked , then i remembered chile 's performance last part . 
  note to chile : i 'm dead so you ca n't use this against me or my nation . 
  i mean we do n't even dislike china . 
  i love china . 
  i know people in china . 
  i have friends there . 
  china is great . 
  so much 5 . 
  aimerais is just salty china is n't steamrolling yet, 
  dude i 'm pretty sure that is copypasta . 
  by `` people of discord '' , you mean just yourself , right ? 
  lol merger, 
  it * is * strangely familiar , now that you mention it ... 
  lol paska postaus t : friendo, 
  maybe they 're nation-wide . 
  i mean poland is pretty weak anyway , should we ? 
  [ insert meme about assuming here ], 
  cheeky burma is cheeky, 
  it 's possible they all have access to it . 
  chile are cowards for not partaking in a bullshit merge ? 
  edit jk, 
  it ` shappening.gif, 
  2017 more like 201bad, 
  i think 3 is the best as well seeing as 1 would probably give plot bonus to china and they have 14 people so that 's not really a problem . 
  and that tech bonus i do n't really care about cuz reasons . 
  no u just don get it, 
  nah fuck that shit dude i love nukes, 
  that 's because it 's a joke . 
  i would like to apologize for the actions of our glorious leader . 
  if i get beheaded for this , so be it . 
  but do know our great leader has anger management issues . 
  he might throw tantrums every now and then . 
  the fuck is this , eu4 ? 
  the year 1400 has been going around , also i have a map of the individual states from 1400 . 
  not that they would be much different in 1450 , besides in 1450 we would n't have to worry about the hundred years ' war ( although france would be the only one affected really ) , and more importantly , the hussite wars . 
  inb4 it 's aime since they love alts, 
  even though it does n't really have that much to do with this , we 've been discussing the issue in modmail , so we have n't overlooked the matter . 
  but yes . 
  we need a gamerunner . 
  i mean it would all be fixed with like 10-20 turns of the game . 
  we should probably limit the player count with major civs as well . 
  maybe . 
  crusading was a thing in the 15th century , no one just got around to making one , really . 
  there were some minor ones not aimed at the levant . 
  : dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd, 
  what do you mean ? 
  oh right . 
  maybe we should tweak the mechanics so that it wo n't be as easy to do so ? 
  what even are the mechanics ? 
  yeah pope calls them , but what then ? 
  fucking seriously ? 
  i went to paris and the louvre a few years ago with my parents , they did n't want to visit the archeology section for no goddamn reason so i never went there . 
  i 'm pissed off now . 
  they did n't really have to irl, 
  yeah this, 
  flying spaghetti monster . 
  the face of that woman in the background is pretty spot-on . 
  yay i named something, 
  mate you do n't have access to the modchat do you ? 
  yeah . 
  man it sucks to be on the losing side , does n't it ? 
  / r/askreddit sure is known for their original comments !, 
  lol, 
  no action was taken because no actions could be taken . 
  it 's pretty goddamn hard to punish a player whose identity was taken . 
  we discussed the matter of alts for about a week and came to the conclusion that there is no way to enforce anything concerning alts because there is no way to enforce anything concerning alts . 
  i am august jagiellon , governor of sumerian europe . 
  / u/thyreformer, 
  why was that even up for vote / u/emeraldrange ? 
  and no electorates ?? 
  shit man, 
  you can stand without arms , i suppose . 
  i mean everything has been fucked up for the last 100 years by the looks of it so that might have something to do with it . 
  yay, 
  wishful thinking if i 've ever seen any . 
  ^ ^ ^ how ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ vote ^ ^ ^ when ^ ^ ^ there ^ ^ ^ is n't ^ ^ ^ an ^ ^ ^ election, 
  you wish, 
  try me bitch, 
  i 'd like hamburg , thanks . 
  i mean you could just watch in the sidelines without doing anything important , just like bestern siberia !, 
  do you like surrendering ?
