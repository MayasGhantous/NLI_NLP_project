  do you like watching your enemies march in a victory parade through your capital ? 
  do you like pens ? 
  then go for it , my friend !, 
  join france !, 
  at least we fought to the end . 
  rp can decrease success rate if it contains false information , right ? 
  i 'm dead . 
  i do n't think your tracking systems are too reliable . 
  seeeeeee ? 
  i told you nothing is certain before claiming is done !, 
  ... sucks though . 
  yeah we did, 
  oh you baguettes never cease to amuse me . 
  this backfired though , do n't you think ? 
  * at least i did n't join austria that already had two of our strongest players because they are emperor even though they 're not *, 
  totally not dodgy and very trustworthy !, 
  more like fsa is down to one city confirmed, 
  yeah but in the * beginning * of 1400 , wenceslaus of bohemia is ~ ~ emperor ~ ~ kotr . 
  rupert ascends in end of august . 
  so gg / u/ignus , you 've been robbed :p, 
  ye but usually when someone starts from a certain year they start from the beginning of said year, 
  i thought i 'd never see the day . 
  ma boj, 
  filthy dane holstein is mine, 
  #surprise me not giving a shit, 
  yeah cuz it 's a shitty idea that would n't even work like at all and most people would n't care, 
  bitch, 
  oh hey it 's the fedora wearing shrimp talking, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kidding, 
  we both know that 's complete bullshit, 
  it 's a shame / r/blunderyears is only about what one looked in the past , you 'd fit right in, 
  yeah i might actually fit there because i know when i do n't look good and change, 
   18 years old, 
   do n't know what context is, 
  ayy you 're just as much of a prick as irl venice was, 
  we do n't have a civ with that colour in the game sorry, 
  the fuck is that bright blue shit we do n't have a civ with that color this is obviously a fake, 
  also eurasia has the caribbean and canary islands which is totally unrealistic, 
  not realistic irl-wise , i mean realistic mk4-wise, 
  also wtf australia is a cs they should be black, 
  they were n't that blue though that 's the wrong color, 
  exam weeks suck man, 
  well the hussites were more precursors to the reformation proper . 
  is l\u00fcbeck real or a myth ? 
  so far , no one has seen the city ... 
  time to rebuild !, 
  kinda reminds me of stockholm . 
  * augustin von welf - current character . 
  b\u00fcrgermeister of the free hanseatic cities of hamburg and l\u00fcbeck , therefore he has the power to assemble the hansetag . 
  young for a man of this status . 
  very pious and charismatic . 
  married to marie von welf . 
  * rudolf von welf - son of augustin , heir apparent . 
  in his twenties . 
  shows prowess as a military commander . 
  * aline von welf - daughter of augustin , very pretty , tales are told in the taverns across germany of her beauty . 
  she brings all the boys to the yard . 
  at least she would , if she was n't a noble and rarely seen among the common folk . 
  * magdeleine von welf - daughter of augustin . 
  older than her sister aline . 
  often overshadowed by her little sister , which has led to her being a cunning politician . 
  * beatrice von welf - daughter of rudolf . 
  infant . 
  you are everything i inspire to be, 
  one does not prosper in this world without reading between the lines . 
  you would do well to acknowledge this fact . 
  * my * thirst of blood ? 
  as far as i know , i have yet to kill a single woman or child . 
  the same can not be said of the turks . 
  i doubt any of us can stand against them alone . 
  lucky for you , you are n't the sultan . 
  yeah but that 's prehistory . 
  still not the head of state ... 
  it is not my disdain ; reasons that have faded into the unknown during the generations , the welf family has not worn any red in formal occasions . 
  why is that ? 
  personally , i find the colour quite pleasant as well , but i respect my family more . 
  and the queen is the head of state of the uk, 
  well , nothing is stopping you from wearing it if you desire it so much , but i can not assure that you will be liked after that among us . 
  of course , to me you have been nothing but a friend , i am talking about my relatives . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ kill ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ anyone, 
  i 'm scared, 
  good, 
  voting for : ** bohemia **, 
  you still need our money to save some insignificant prick then ? 
  sure , whatever the imperialist says . 
  will we make a custom start then ? 
  i ca n't really play as like ten opms at the same time . 
  finn here , agreed perkele . 
  / u/the _ enigmaconundrum sign dis pls, 
  but ... 
  but ... we were supposed to end the suffering ... with a shitload of suffering ... not collapse ... aww man d :, 
  means that i 'm about to capture one , but not quite take . 
  we do n't want unnecessary civilian casualties . 
  en garde !, 
  suppose you could say that . 
  they 're with god now . 
  may they find peace . 
  not at all , unless there can only be one in cs 's and you do n't mind us potentially ceasing to exist after the next part . 
  ( i think he 's just centralizing ), 
  watch the fuck out rngesus , you 've painted a real big target on your back .
