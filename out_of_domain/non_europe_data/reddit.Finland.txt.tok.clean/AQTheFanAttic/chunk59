  currently i at least have no idea how the plan 's successfulness is determined . 
  and the pau 's saf merge which was n't announced before it was too late to revert was quite questionable as well . 
  i 'm having shitloads of fun but we seriously need to update our rules . 
  pau makes a plan to assassinate the peace-loving / u/shandorin and frame / u/bencoccio, 
  plot has very slim chances of succeeding , but it does so, 
  shandorin comes back immidiately because there is n't anybody to replace him , turns into a devil of some sort , helps / u/yurya who also was killed very recently to nuke the capital of europe on the other side of continent, 
  meanwhile / u/bencoccio has nothing to do, 
  everyone is confused, 
  i think there 's something here that does n't really match . 
  post your username below and people can say what they think you look like . 
  if you 're sensitive to these kinds of things , then do n't participate . 
  naturally . 
  inspired by / u/proletariatcossack and / u/icelandbestland, 
  why ? 
  what has the republic or the contras done to you ? 
  the contras are hostile , sure , but was it truly worth declaring war on them when you * knew full well you were going to get your capital nuked * ? 
  and the republic ?? 
  really ?? 
  they have done * nothing * to you !, 
  nothing !, 
  they were trying to coexist with you peacefully !, 
  and you go and declare war on them !, 
  for no actual reason at all !, 
  you know what your actions are called ? 
  warmongering !, 
  that 's right . 
  * you are a warmongering menace to the world * . 
  stop your needless killing immidiately !, 
  it does nobody any good . 
  do n't go crying about others nuking you and attacking your nation when you 're the one starting it all . 
  i really , really hope our two great nations could remain allies , but i 'm getting worried . 
  if things will keep going the way they 're going ... 
  you 're gon na have a bad time . 
  why do n't you come on over to r/civhybridgames ? 
  it 's that interactive ai game that ~ ~ like me and / u/lunatic49 ~ ~ everyone is buzzing about . 
  the game 's going strong , we have four superpowers right now , ` murica is trying to copy it 's irl counterpart and asia is terrorizing the world with nukes !, 
  it 's heaps of fun , and since the next cbr part is still some time away , you might need to fill your fix !, 
  note : this announcement was ~ ~ not ~ ~ endorsed by the pan-american union, 
  birds are singing , flowers are blooming ... 
  on days like these , nations like you ... 
  #should be burning in hell, 
  i knew it 'd come back, 
  also caps only because ** hype **, 
  i 'm checking my r/mod and messages like every 15 minutes ... and everytime there 's nothing new i 'm disappointed ... 
  i think i 'm developing an addiction . 
  send help . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ or ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ do n't, 
  cool , huh ? 
  little ol' aq is gon na tell y' all a story . 
  it 's a real good story . 
  i 'm gon na tell you lads about what the future plans of the old commonwealth were . 
  note the past tense . 
  after the pau was gone , / u/thyreformer and the commonwealth would have had the power to conquer everything , as you surely know . 
  but guess what ? 
  they were going to * spare * them . 
  yup . 
  the war against the pau would have been the last war this world would have experienced . 
  but now ... 
  / u/thyreformer is no more . 
  the commonwealth is all but gone . 
  and nobody - ** nobody ** knows what will happen next . 
  okay , first of all , you might be thinking `` hey aq , are n't you a bit late ? '', 
  yeah . 
  i am . 
  you not being able to kill us all after all the bullshit improved my mood . 
  but then . 
  i had to go listen to some fucking children 's violin concert . 
  holy shit it was awful . 
  while i was there , i had time to think . 
  i , of course , thought about the chg . add that with the fact i was bored , i got pretty fucking steamed . 
  so here we go . 
  europe has been through a lot of shit in the course of the game . 
  siberia was wiped out . 
  i can understand that , it was bad luck . 
  rivalnator was spying on us . 
  that was a good play on the pau 's part . 
  ( like the only good play they 've made the whole game , i might add ) . 
  the south african conflict . 
  okay so , first of all , we 're about to wreck them . 
  that 's cool . 
  then what happens ? 
  pau pulls one of their trademark bullshit moves by merging them into it ? 
  like what the hell ? 
  they had zero impact on the war , it made no sense . 
  but it did n't matter , we wrecked them anyway . 
  and when we finally conquer them ... 
  they rebel and we lose the cities . 
  i can kind of see how that happened , but still , fuck you . 
  oh , and speaking of the pau , fuck them especially . 
  they 've done * nothing * in this game but pull off gamey bullshit . 
  even the formation of the union was bullshit . 
  the saf merge was bullshit . 
  but neither of those come even fucking close to their most recent endeavours into the depths of gamey cow diarrhea . 
  when we 're finally going to put them out of their misery ... 
  they use emps on us . 
  what kind of motherfucking bullshit is that ?!? 
  the arseholes are bending the fucking rules now ?!? 
  oh that 's cool , did you know that europe now has unlimited action points * because i fucking say so * ? 
  there 's no such thing as a fucking emp in this fucking game , you ca n't just pull them out of goddamn nowhere !, 
  seriously , that is * not * how rules work , you fucks !,
