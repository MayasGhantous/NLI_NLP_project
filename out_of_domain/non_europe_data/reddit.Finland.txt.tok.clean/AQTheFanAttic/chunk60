  if you want to add rules to the game , you talk about them first !, 
  you 've got emps ? 
  oh how cool , we have giant nuclear xcom robot bombers that can take ten cities in one turn !, 
  where did those come from ? 
  out of nowhere !, 
  ... and they would be just as valid as some retarded emps . 
  you ca n't do this to my game . 
  * our game . 
  * do you have any clue how many hours i , the mods and even the normal players have put into making and participating in this game ? 
  and now you 're just going to fuck it all up because you 'll lose otherwise ? 
  but you know why i have been wanting to see your destruction so badly for the past days ? 
  it 's not because of quebec . 
  it 's not because you 're democratic and we 're communist . 
  it 's because you 're playing solely to win . 
  and you 're not playing fair because of it . 
  europe 's aim has always been winning in the end . 
  i can admit that . 
  but at least we are playing by the rules . 
  what i think we should do right now , is if saves from before this part exist , ** we revert back . 
  ** europe would n't be able to change their actions , the rest of the world can . 
  but the difference would be , the actions would not contain some random new shit somebody just invented , and they would be announced before limerick runs the game . 
  this way we can still keep the game fun for everyone . 
  tl ; dr europe 's been through a lot of shit , and we 're still going strong . 
  if you ca n't stop us without breaking the rules , do n't stop as at all . 
  and also we should revert the game back . 
  rant over . 
  how hyped are you ?!? 
  edit : 30 mins cool cool, 
  edit2 : any minute now is this real, 
  hardening units and cities so they wo n't be affected by emps ? 
  what ? 
  but let 's keep the talks about the game purely in refining the gameplay , setting up the map and all that for now , yeah ? 
  i already commented this on an another thread , but i think we should officially start game 2 * after * game 1 has ended , and after that the coalition-forming will start . 
  it wo n't make the sub confusing for new users , with posts about `` join this old italian city state ! '', 
  amongst posts about the pan-american union and war declarations and that . 
  it will make the eventual re-alignment of factions more fair for those of us who want to focus purely on game 1 until it ends . 
  like me . 
  ( i could also say something about game 1 being practically over until everyone decided to gangbang us , but i 'm not going to ), 
  thank you for neutralizing our biggest threat for us . 
  and do n't worry , i 'm sure you 'll get your `` reward '' sooner or later . 
  i guess we forgot to tell you in your training . 
  when you backstab someone , you need to actually try to kill them . 
  sorry about that , we might 've skipped that lesson on `` accident '' . 
  oh and do n't come begging for mercy ... 
  ** you 're not getting any . 
  best siberia . . ? 
  more like *** dead *** siberia . 
  \\  new part comes out, 
  \\  flooding of aftermath posts, 
  \\  posting dies down, 
  \\  it 's eerily quiet, 
  \\  limerick starts playing the new part, 
  \\  major secret plot revealed, 
  \\  massive shitstorm ensues, 
  \\  repeat, 
  depends if we get it finished . 
  i finished the narration . 
  my fingers are exhausted . 
  here , have some excerpts from the narration :, 
  *  man , it 's been a while since we got one of these , has n't it ? 
  *  a [ redacted ] was knocking on [ redacted ] 's door . 
  *  the mystery has been solved , everyone . 
  *  it 's happening !, 
  get hyped, 
  new way to handle actions :, 
  instead of telling them in the part , they 'd be announced in the sub at the same time . 
  after that , no actions can be made . 
  limerick waits for an hour and if no controveries have arisen , he runs the part . 
  otherwise said controversies will be solved before the part is ran . 
  i love it . 
  dow out of the blue and then you get devastated xdd, 
  i 'm actually laughing irl right now , that was amazing . 
  ( no offense / u/shandorin and / u/mob _ cleaner , you played the game ** really ** well . ), 
  also protip : do n't mess with the commonwealth of greater europe ( read : the world ) . 
  xcoms to newfoundland and south america . 
  most of our money into military . 
  #it 's time to finish this . 
  i just remember i have an english presentation that i have to make for tomorrow . 
  i will finish and post the room tomorrow . 
  wo n't happen . 
  ever . 
  tpang 's asleep right now and the narration 's been sent to him . 
  it wo n't be here today . 
  just sayin ' . 
  it looks like losing to you was n't so bad after all . 
  looks like mankind is at peace . 
  just not in the way i imagined it . 
  mankind is also free . 
  * from god * . 
  we 're finally in control . 
  gg guys , it may have not always seemed like it , but i had fun playing with you . 
  * / u/aqthefanattic gives himself in for trialing . 
  '' ** aq the fanattic : you have been found guilty of aiding and abeitting terrorists and personally monitoring crackdowns on uprisings for freedom in europe . 
  you are herefore sentenced 10 years in washington state prison , since you turned yourself in . 
  you will be given a free trip back to europe when released . 
  `` thank you , my lord . 
  my work in this world, 
  is done anyway . '', 
  * but that 's not true , is it ? 
  there is one last thing to do .
