  * too bad there 's nothing i can do now . 
  * unless ... *, 
  ** in the prison **, 
  * unless ... *, 
  * when they were resurrected , they made some ... modifications to my body , did n't they ? 
  * time to use them . 
  ** let 's have some fun . 
  and so , i started picking a fight with the other inmates . 
  and of course , that 's when the guards came . 
  and then ... 
  i let the transformation begin . 
  * ah , nanotechnology . 
  it allows normal humans like me to transform into beings more powerful than an xcom unit . 
  and nobody knows it exists . 
  * until it 's too late . 
  ** eat plasm , guard pieces of shit . 
  an awful sound echoed in the hallway . 
  and the guard had vaporized . 
  the prison stopped . 
  the guards were terrified of me . 
  * this is amazing . 
  i shot at the wall . 
  the wall was destroyed . 
  i was free . 
  * it 's time to go home . 
  ** in paris **, 
  `` hey guys , i 'm back ! '', 
  you 're alive ? '', 
  `` pft , of course i 'm alive . 
  i 'm immort - ice ? 
  what are you doing in thy 's office ? 
  where is everybody ? '', 
  `` gone . '', 
  `` what ?!, 
  you traitor ! '', 
  nothing like that . 
  the s-g has left . '', 
  `` really ? 
  where ? '', 
  `` i think you know . '', 
  `` already ? 
  what about talleyrand ? 
  or ignus ? 
  or mesa ? 
  what about zalminen ? 
  are they with him ? '', 
  `` that i do n't know . 
  i presume they 're dead , just like i thought you were . 
  but here you are , so ... '', 
  `` so ... you 've decided to stay ? '', 
  `` yes . 
  someone has to take care of these people . '', 
  `` i see . 
  it 's time for me to go as well . '', 
  ice was quiet . 
  he looked sad . 
  i gave him a smile . 
  `` take care of yourself , my friend . 
  it was a pleasure knowing you . '', 
  `` good luck . '', 
  `` i 'll see you around . '', 
  * it 's time . 
  ** space - onboard the godkiller **, 
  the general-secretary was alone in the command center of the superweapon . 
  the earth was far below him . 
  it looked beautiful . 
  nobody came with him . 
  then , the door opened . 
  `` mr. s-g !, 
  there 's an object flying towards the satellite ! '', 
  `` then shoot it down , will you ? '', 
  we will not fail this ! '', 
  startled , the young officer left the room . 
  reformer looked out of the window again . 
  he saw the object . 
  he opened the intercom . 
  `` fire at will . '', 
  the weapon 's short-range defensive system fired at the object at full force . 
  but it did n't stop . 
  in fact , it was heading straight towards the leader . 
  `` you idiots !, 
  fire again ! '', 
  he fired . 
  and he missed . 
  he missed again . 
  this went on for several hours . 
  he had a popsicle and nearly passed out . 
  the object did n't stop . 
  reformer became nervous . 
  he stopped firing and braced for impact . 
  he looked at the radar ... 
  wait . 
  was it slowing down ? 
  it was . 
  it had bled off almost all of its speed when it was a couple meters away from the window . 
  it was now floating towards the satellite . 
  the commander of the vessel walked into the center . 
  `` it looks like a human , '' said reformer , eerily calm . 
  `` you 're not alarmed ? '', 
  his reflection in the window started smiling .
