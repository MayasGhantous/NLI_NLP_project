  `` i know who he is . 
  show him the way in here . '', 
  `` are you sure , commander ? '', 
  ten minutes later , the door opened . 
  you came . '', 
  `` of course i did '' , i said . 
  `` how could i not ? '', 
  `` i thought the americans executed you ? '', 
  `` nah , they only gave me ten years because i turned myself in . 
  then i escaped . 
  thanks to your mods . '', 
  `` so it worked ? '', 
  `` like a charm . 
  this body is amazing . '', 
  `` i ca n't tell you how glad i am you came . '', 
  `` i 'll stay with you . 
  until the end of time . 
  is it ready ? '', 
  `` soon . '', 
  we shook hands . 
  `` it 's time to save the world . '', 
  the door opened . 
  `` the fleet is waiting for your command , leader reformer . '', 
  `` fire . '', 
  then , i decided to intercept . 
  `` not yet . '', 
  the officer looked surprised seeing me . 
  `` let 's wait for a little . 
  just in case . '', 
  `` in case of the others appearing . '', 
  it was the year 1175 . 
  the 100th annual un meeting was being held in tenochtitlan . 
  all of the important politicians from around the world were there . 
  there were a lot of ceremonies , for the united nations was now a hundred years old . 
  there was currently a speech being held by one of the founding fathers , legobloxcraft , when he was suddenly interrupted by a message appearing to the big screen behind him . 
  in the background of the message there was a window , looking down to the earth . 
  in front of the window there were standing three men . 
  their faces were unrecognizable due to the lightning . 
  then , the man in the middle started to speak . 
  `` ladies and gentlemen down there on the surface , the time has come for you to leave your planet . 
  we are currently standing on the command bridge of the space station which some of you may know as * the godkiller * . '', 
  the three men stepped forward , their faces now visible . 
  `` remember us ? 
  two people that were once the most wanted men in the world ... and the former leader of the european union who helped bring peace to your planet . '', 
  when the audience remembered , the hall fell into disorder . 
  it was * them * . 
  reformer , ice and aq . 
  the trio that had become almost legendary among the common folk . 
  the saviours . 
  the men who let everyone free . 
  `` but do n't worry '' , said aq . 
  `` we do n't mean you any harm . 
  if we did , you would have been dead for 99 years now . 
  we are onboard the superweapon that killed god himself after all . '', 
  then , ice spoke . 
  `` it 's time to leave the people of this world to their own devices . '', 
  `` remember when i said that i am ready to play my first game of * civilization * ? '', 
  reformer asked . 
  `` it 's about to start . 
  and we want you to join us . '', 
  `` keep in mind , we could have killed everybody whenever we liked . 
  but that 's not what we 're after . '', 
  `` we wanted peace on this planet . 
  and you achieved it . 
  therefore , our work here is done , do n't you think ? 
  the people are more than capable of leading themselves . 
  and they will have to . '', 
  `` for they do n't know the truth . 
  the truth that this is all just a big game . 
  and that game has ended . 
  and this is why we chosen people , who have become aware of the truth , can not rule much longer . '', 
  `` so , when people finish a game that they really liked , what do they do ? 
  they start a new one . 
  and we have found a way to do just that . '', 
  `` this space station is now capable of inter-dimensional travel . 
  join us , and we will find a new world to play with . '', 
  `` you have a month . 
  we 'll be waiting . '', 
  you 're writing an ending for game 1 on mobile , then something comes up , and after it 's done it 's run out of batteries and everything 's gone . 
  * here we are . 
  * everybody 's here . 
  * standing on the bridge of the godkiller . 
  * old friends , even older enemies . 
  * side by side . 
  * looking down on the world we created . 
  *** together . 
  * man , it sure is beautiful today , is n't it ? 
  * a bit flooded , but gorgeus all the same . 
  * i can even see the biggest cities from up here . 
  * washington ... *, 
  * ... and paris . 
  * all headquarters of the old empires . 
  * headquarters to all that plotting . 
  * but now ... *, 
  * they stand abandoned . 
  * there 's nothing to plot about anymore . 
  * nothing to conduct diplomacy over . 
  * we 've reached the ultimatum . 
  * we 've reached endgame . 
  * and now ... *,
