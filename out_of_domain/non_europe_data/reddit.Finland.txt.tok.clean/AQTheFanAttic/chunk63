  klonam broke the silence . 
  `` a toast for the winners ? '', 
  `` i 'll get the drinks , '' said ice . 
  `` can you get mine ... with ice ? '', 
  `` shut the fuck up , aq . '', 
  i had to . 
  ice then proceeded to get the champagne . 
  lego raised his glass . 
  `` gentlemen ... 
  a toast for the pan-american union , winners of the first ever game of civilization !, 
  try again next time , commonwealth noobs ! '', 
  * good game . 
  `` cheers '' , said the rest in unison . 
  `` well ... '' reformer started . 
  he turned to speak to the intercom . 
  `` open the gate . '', 
  a strange hum started to echo inside the station , soon followed by a bright flash of light . 
  * there it is . 
  `` so , that 's where we 're going ? '', 
  mesa asked . 
  * yup . 
  `` god damn , that looks scarier than shandorin 's virus . 
  i did n't plan for this ! '', 
  dan exclaimed . 
  `` my friends , '' ben spoke . 
  `` let us look back at the world we have created for one last time . '', 
  everyone turned around . 
  the next fifteen minutes were spent admiring the planet below . 
  it felt more like fifteen hours . 
  * god damnit . 
  * i 'm tearing up here . 
  the others were too . 
  the members of the pau put their arms on each other 's shoulders in a brotherly manner . 
  * looks like we got a good ending after all . 
  soon enough , every one of the players were standing in a row , arms on each other 's shoulders . 
  `` boy , i 'm gon na miss this place ... '', 
  `` i wonder if they will be fine ? '', 
  `` oh hey , check out south america . 
  remember when our soldiers just decided to go there and took bogota with no effort ? '', 
  `` good times ... '', 
  `` well . 
  time to make the jump . '', 
  reformer opened the comms . 
  `` it 's time to go . '', 
  the station started to move . 
  * here we go . 
  `` i 'd like to take this moment to rename this station * the observer * , '' said briusky . 
  nods of agreement . 
  a bright light , and then ... 
  darkness . 
  * a new adventure begins . 
  ### the end, 
  you 've deserved it . 
  darkness . 
  complete darkness . 
  until ... 
  a tiny dot of light in the distance . 
  like a lone star . 
  slowly growing larger . 
  and bluer . 
  more stars forming around it . 
  and soon enough ... 
  the observer exited interdimensional space . 
  in front of the station loomed a blue planet , much smaller than the old earth . 
  it was almost completely covered in water , save for one mass of land . 
  and that landmass looked oddly familiar . 
  the interdimentional portal behind the station started disappearing . 
  unbeknownst to the crew of the observer , a small space shuttle came through right at the last moment . 
  `` so this is our new gameworld , huh ? 
  it looks just like italy , does n't it ? '', 
  `` it sure does . 
  it 's perfect . '', 
  `` that gives me an idea . 
  what if we played through the reneissance ? '', 
  `` that 's a great idea . 
  i 'm going to set that up . '', 
  reformer turned to the console and typed something . 
  `` check this out . '', 
  suddenly , the station started shaking . 
  it started to separate . 
  the solar panels on the separated parts extended and the parts started boosting away from the station . 
  all that remained was the module that the observers were in . 
  `` what the hell was that ?! '', 
  asked lego , ever so slightly alarmed . 
  `` that ... was our satellites . 
  they 'll stay in orbit , allowing us to observe the planet all we want . 
  and now , it 's time to send the game itself down . '', 
  at that moment , 18 capsules ejected from the ship , plummeting down towards italy . 
  `` and there goes our nations . 
  shall we follow ? '', 
  the ship started to burn retrograde , slowing down in its orbit and starting its descent towards the surface . 
  couple hours later , the spacecraft splashed down on the ocean 's surface . 
  there was water around them as far as the eye can see . 
  `` time to go under . 
  engage submersible mode . 
  the spacecraft the turned into a submarine and went deep under the sealevel . 
  it was dark . 
  * booting limos 2.0.0 . 
  * observation satellites : online . 
  * sub monitors : online .
