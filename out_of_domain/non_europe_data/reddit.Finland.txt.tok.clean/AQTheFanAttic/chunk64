  * satellite mobility interface : online . 
  * interior lighting : engaged . 
  everyone took a seat , facing towards the wall of monitors . 
  `` ladies and gentlemen '' , said aq . 
  '' * let the games begin . 
  i woke up washed onto some shore . 
  * bloody git . 
  `` ice ? 
  mesa ? 
  do you copy ? '', 
  static noises . 
  `` this is reformer , i copy . 
  over . '', 
  `` yeah we can hear you . 
  reformer , let 's meet aq at the vantage point . 
  over . '', 
  and so , the four of us flew over to the vantage point . 
  a submarine for four . 
  `` heh , you 'd think the computer was smarter than this . '', 
  `` well you know . 
  i 've watched enough hollywood movies to know this would happen . 
  that 's why i made the failsaves . 
  so what do you guys want to do for the next few hours or so ? '', 
  i asked . 
  `` what do you mean ? '', 
  `` i designed it so that every twelve hours , i need to put in a code . 
  manually . 
  it can not be overridden and it has optical detection . 
  and if the code is n't put in ... 
  the computer shuts down . '', 
  ** twelve hours later **, 
  `` alright , time 's up . 
  we went into the submersible and travelled to the sub . 
  the sight was horrifying . 
  bodies . 
  bodies everywhere . 
  everybody was dead . 
  we stood there for a few minutes , paying respects to the our friends . 
  dead friends . 
  `` that bastard ... '' ice said . 
  the only thing that will remain of his sentiency is the fact that his life is going to be total hell . '', 
  we went in . 
  it was dark . 
  there was a light switch . 
  reformer turned the lights on . 
  `` having fun , `` pengu '' ? 
  the feeling of being completely powerless is great , is n't it ? 
  take this , you ronald . '', 
  i plugged myself into the computer . 
  `` load up dociliator.exe . '', 
  `` central computer online , please . '', 
  `` alright , here 's the thing . 
  you 've basically lost all control of the sub . 
  it 's all manual now . 
  the only reason you still have a system32 is because you 're needed to run the game . 
  your time is over , pengu . 
  you 're not a god anymore . 
  we are . '', 
  we took our seats . 
  it was quiet . 
  the silence lasted for a few days . 
  it was then broken by mesa . 
  `` hey guys . '', 
  `` yeah ? '', 
  `` i 've always been an optimist . 
  so it 's time to look at the bright side . '', 
  `` we 're the last men standing . '', 
  '' * europe wins . 
  the old familiar grin reappeared on reformer 's face . 
  `` too soon man . '', 
  soon enough , things turned to normal . 
  the commonwealth politburo convened once more . 
  but this time , they were n't plotting . 
  they were observing . 
  and designing . 
  designing new bodies for the deceased observers .

  well ... 
  it 's on . 
  we 're allies now . 
  what 's up ? 
  the pap 's pantheon is the only religion that exists right now . 
  i know that religion is an integral part of the medieval era , but now we have incompatibilities with ig . 
  so shall we wait for like two parts to bring christianity and islam into this ? 
  seriously . 
  you have a massive carpet of paratruupers . 
  you could make serious gains against any of your neighbours . 
  you just have to choose . 
  but you do n't . 
  why ?
