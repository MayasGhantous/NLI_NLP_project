  the fucking swedes are more interesting than us now . 
  the swedes !, 
  just fucking attack somebody jesus fucking christ that 's like the only thing there is to be done in this game !, 
  every part i hope that you attack somebody . 
  sweden . 
  the soviets . 
  and everytime i 'm disappointed . 
  seeing as these are the medieval/reneissance ages , would n't it be more realistic to demand dow posts on the sub in order to make them legit ? 
  because attacking without declaring war seems out of place in the reneissance . 
  i have n't researched the matter though , it 's just how i feel . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  it 's out !, 
  so , the third city goes to me . 
  what about the others ? 
  also , there 's empty room to the west still , so more settlers ? 
  so , you papal states want to be rome . 
  i have a way for you to be rome . 
  just give san marino away and rome is all you have . 
  then you can be rome all you want . 
  pulla means bun in finnish and that bothers the shit out of me . 
  in your actions you had three plots . 
  plot 1 ... 
  plot 4 ... 
  and plot 5 . 
  now , here 's something that do n't add up . 
  there 's no plot 2 or plot 3 . 
  what 's up with that ? 
  caps only or else you 're a pussy, 
  that is all i have to say . 
  how will we continue from here ?

  love you . 
  oh , and my first psa was n't a joke ... , 
  i will fully replace limerick next wednesday . 
  i 'd like to wish the bestest of lucks to genoa , as i am leaving their faction for the time being . 
  thanks to canadian and klonam for the good times ; i shall return one day . 
  just ... just let that sink in for a moment . 
  now do n't be alarmed , i 'm sure we will figure out what 's wrong . 
  the next part might be late however , which is why i wanted to let you know . 
  ### it works !!!, 
  finally !, 
  edit : now it keeps crashing . 
  but hey , progress !, 
  okay , so basically , before yesterday the problem was that i could n't even start loading the game because the game said i was missing mods . 
  we 're still unsure what caused this , but it 's fixed now . 
  however ... 
  the game keeps crashing , i assume it 's right before the loading screen is about to show up . 
  the game configures itself a second time after i 've told the game to load the game . 
  it could be a mod issue , but seeing as my mod folder is an exact copy of limerick 's , i ca n't see how . 
  i have another save file that has largely similar mods that goes into the loading screen and crashes after some time of loading . 
  ~ ~ crash logs would be nice ; however i ca n't find them and am not sure if civ even saves them anywhere . ~ ~, 
  edit : went to the windows event log , i found out that it 's kernelbase.dll crashing . 
  exception 0xe06d7363 . 
  edit2 : ran the dx9 version with the other file , now it was cvgamecore_expansion2 . dll crashing , exception 0xc0000005 . 
  the chg2 file says the same thing as in the dx11 version . 
  edit3 : enabled logging . 
  here 's the logs that had anything abnormal in them : http://pastebin.com/b42w7wux, 
  edit5 : received new moduserdata files from limerick . 
  crashed again , [ here 's ] ( http://pastebin.com/bkwnptpt ) the logs if someone spots a difference . 
  we 're starting to wonder if my pc is even capable of running the game . 
  if not then we 'll have to find another host , delaying the next part even further . 
  ( edit4 : the problem is probably not in my hardware being slow . 
  checked mission control when loading the game and ram usage was at a constant 37 % while cpu spiked between 20 % and 80 % . ), 
  so yeah . 
  this is the ultimate solution . 
  if ** all ** else fails ... 
  i suppose we could reset . . ? 
  i 've failed you ... 
  that being said i do believe my rig is sufficient . 
  tpang does n't have a $ 5000 supercomputer and he 's doing just fine . 
  we need to buff the natives . 
  if we do it realistically and how it went historically , well ... we already know how that goes . 
  that other file i mentioned when i was trying to make game 2 work was the save for game 1 . 
  i was going to show you something but since i wo n't be able to make it work either i 'll just tell you . 
  yes . 
  pau won game 1 . 
  that 's cool , congratulations for them . 
  ( i believe i 've never actually congratulated them lol ), 
  ** but . 
  they still are destroyed by eu . 
  the official lore made by the pau folks was that the commonwealth troops just refused to fight when they won . 
  ... that makes zero sense . 
  the pau was influential over the eu for several parts before the game ended . 
  it ended by pau becoming influential over central asia . 
  why would that discourage some other troops from fighting , especially when they were so close to victory ? 
  it would n't . 
  it was pau propaganda that they were able to spread due to their influence over everyone else . 
  ** tl ; dr ** pau * does * win and have the bragging rights but i would like it if they would keep the fact that eu still beat their arses in mind . 
  ** glory to the commonwealth !, 
  ** i would n't be surprised if the pau 's tourism output was bugged . 
  you sending me the c : \\ users \\ documents and program files folders, 
  we never tried that, 
  there 's still a tiny sliver of hope, 
  i 'm slowly becoming a lurker here . 
  i do n't read most post here anymore either . 
  i do n't want to fall out , i need help . 
  what if each faction got a preassigned starting area ( eg . 
  10 tiles across ) where they can freely place their first city ( or two if that 's what we decide ) . 
  think of the first turn in a be game . 
  yay content ?
