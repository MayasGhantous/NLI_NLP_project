  `` okay , i admit . 
  i have n't done quite what my ancestors promised and should have . 
  i 'll change my ways . '', 
  `` what do you mean ? '', 
  `` i 'm challenging you to a duel . 
  right here , right now . '', 
  gunthor broke into a laugh so loud that the baguettes probably heard it as well . 
  `` do you really think you can defeat me ? 
  i am undefeatable !! '', 
  `` yes . 
  i do . 
  because my name is n't anric ... 
  my real name is agur xiv . 
  and with my forefathers prestigious blood in my veins , i shall end you . 
  for i am the true leader of this people . 
  you 're nothing but a pretender . 
  my ancestor , agur i , founded this beautiful chiefdom . 
  and i , agur * the great * , shall be its saviour . 
  i 'll be waiting . '', 
  it was the morning of day 1 . 
  day 1 of the second agurian dynasty . 
  day 1 of a new era . 
  chief agur xiv had gathered the city 's population to the main square . 
  `` my people !, 
  today marks the beginning of a new era for the vandalic chiefdom !, 
  and as my first act as chief , the vandalic chiefdom is , from this moment onwards , ** dissolved ** !, 
  the crowd went into a frenzy . 
  some people even threw stones or whatever was nearby at the former chief . 
  '' ** calm down !, 
  ** '' agur shouted . 
  the sheer volume of his shout made everyone silent . 
  in the chiefdom 's stead , i will herefore find the kingdom of the vandals !, 
  and i shall be its first king : king agur i !, 
  the civilized world is laughing at us , they think of us as filthy barbarians !, 
  the time has come for them to take us seriously , and most importantly : fear us !, 
  we will leave our mark into the history books , and i will forever be known as agur the great ! '', 
  the crowd 's roar was deafening . 
  something remarkable was at hand . 
  in the next years , king agur i rebuilt the capital from the ground up . 
  for the first time in history , the vandals made their houses from stone . 
  and the magnificent king 's palace rivalled even the one in france . 
  #but there are some things that never change ... 
  the title of the king is now hereditary . 
  ... but you can still challenge the dynasty if you dare . 
  brian releases new parts in the middle of the night for me and thy at least . ), 
  [ removed ], 
  the ai kept making peace over and over again ? 
  woooooooo fuck you, 
  edit : and you could n't even take hippo regius lol you fucking suck, 
  how are you ? 
  i 'm great . 
  it 's all over . 
  we 're doomed . 
  it 's the end . 
  i will surrender and our lands will be conquered . 
  the vandal flame has been put out . 
  you win . 
  the once proud vandals are now reduced to a client state of the french . 
  resistance is futile . 
  i will not be reduced to a fucking slave . 
  what is vandal shall never die !, 
  you fuckers may destroy our armies . 
  you fuckers may take our lands . 
  you may even brainwash my people !, 
  ** but . 
  you will never put out the vandal flame !, 
  do you really think we would give up without a fight ? 
  think again , pricks . 
  even if my kingdom is gone , your troubles are * far * from over . 
  * the fun is only about to begin . 
  *** welcome to hell . 
  ... on the other hand . 
  there really is no chance of survival for the kingdom . 
  and the french are closing in . 
  fuck the french !, 
  the tale of the vandal might be over , but the tale of france being a shithole is a never ending one . 
  carthage , on the other hand ... 
  they 're kind of okay , i guess . 
  carthage , the vandal kingdom is yours . 
  king agur out . 
  * agur fled the city . 
  after king agur announced that the vandal kingdom would capitulate , he fled the city . 
  to the east . 
  to carthago nova . 
  also known as new carthage . 
  `` greetings . 
  i am sure you have heard the news . '', 
  `` that we have . 
  you made the right choice . '', 
  `` i know . 
  now , shall i accompany to your new city ? 
  i know a shortcut . '', 
  warily , the carthaginians started following the barbarian . 
  * three hours later *, 
  the convoy arrived at the city . 
  `` hello , and welcome to leptus magna !, 
  in the right , you have the town hall . 
  let us go inside and make the proper documents . '', 
  but when agur arrived at the mayor 's office , there were his friend , rofl , and some other man he had never seen before , hard at work . 
  `` uhh ... what the fuck are you doing ? '',
