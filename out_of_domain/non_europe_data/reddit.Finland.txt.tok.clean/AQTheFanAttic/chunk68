  we will save the kingdom !, 
  we will never surrender !, 
  we 're the vandals ! '', 
  '' ... oh for fucks sake , be reasonable . 
  the days of the kingdom are numbered . 
  hey you guys downstairs !, 
  get over here ! '', 
  the carthaginian diplomat and a contingent of soldiers arrived in the room . 
  here 's what 's going on :, 
  the vandals got into a war with france and carthage simultaneously . 
  we were crippled , with us at one city and france having conquered 2 and carthage 2 cities , of which the other was a capital . 
  also during the course of the war , / u/mrklonam , a former member of the vandals , defected to france with two of our cities . 
  now : i have plans which i will not make public just yet , but it involves me being alive . 
  so , weighing my options , as king and the last ( at the time ) active member , decide to give my last city to carthage . 
  this was approved by the mods , accepted by carthage and even france , although showing their dismay , did n't oppose . 
  so everything 's all fine and dandy . 
  enter / u/pielover19 and / u/yurya . 
  yurya has been vandal even longer than i. 
  however , recently he has been inactive , making his first post for at least a week here . 
  pie is a new player , * joining * the vandals here . 
  so , these two claim that they now own leptus magna , apparently make peace with both france and carthage and becoming a french vassal in the progress , ignoring my orders , deeds and complaints . 
  they are using the fact that / u/limerickarcher * gave * the city to them as justification . 
  note that limerick ( and nobody else involved , to be fair ) does not know about my plans , which would be hindered by all this . 
  does this seem fair to you ? 
  does this even make sense ? 
  it does n't to me . 
  agur had set up camp in the outskirts of leptus magna . 
  he had begun negotiations with this self-proclaimed republic . 
  every day , he would return to the city , negotiate for the whole day , and then go back home . 
  until one day ... 
  all of the government had disappeared during the night . 
  agur did n't know what was up with that , but he did n't mind . 
  he set up an election , and won it . 
  since he was the only one running . 
  it was time to get back to business . 
  #the french will pay . 
  ^ ^ in ^ ^ time . 
  if the axes were throwable . 
  i do n't know if many noticed it . 
  also it was shadowed by glorious jew liberation . 
  does the community have a public discord channel ? 
  if not , could we make one ? 
  part 0 will be released tomorrow , on the 21st of july !, 
  after that , we will begin the 72-hour turns , after which part 1 will be run . 
  it should be out this sunday , on the 25th . 
  first events are for part 2 . 
  anyways , it is time for you guys to sign up for narrating and event-making !, 
  * i 'll try to give something for as many people as possible , so if you have both narration and events , please tell me which one you would rather have , if you prefer one over the other . 
  chances are you will only get one of them . 
  * as those before me , i wo n't give one player both the narration and events for the same part .

  #everything taken , if you did n't get anything , be on the lookout for the next thread !, 
  oh and currently doing some small nerfs , infoaddict slides will be released soon . 
  all actions submitted , 
  i 've gotten requests about postponing the deadline since the events are late . 
  this is perfectly understandable , and therefore the new deadline is ~ ~ 12 ~ ~ 24 hours from when the events arrive . 
  if you will not reply to this post or my pm in 12 hours , i will give the narration to someone else . 
  please turn up ... :(, 
  if you make an alliance , declaring war on someone wo n't make your ally automatically declare war . 
  if you are declared on , it wo n't automatically declare war . 
  if you make a defensive pact , if you are declared war on , the other party of the pact _ will _ automatically declare war . 
  however , if you are the agressor , the other party will not automtically and is not obliged to do the same . 
  i actually have a decent computer now !, 
  well , i got it monday , but i 've just successfully booted the game on it for the first time . 
  it 's so much faster now !, 
  next part will be run soon . 
  and if anybody wants specs , ask and i shall deliver . 
  right , so it 's 11:30 pm , i 'm pretty tired and i have school tomorrow . 
  i 've done prepping the part ( i had some other business to attend to as well , it does n't actually take me like 6 hrs ) , and i will not run the part today ; instead , i will do it first thing when i get home from school . 
  please do n't riot . 
  oh fuck i should n't have said that , now you 're definitely going to riot . 
  well at least you have something to do if you riot . 
  permission to riot granted . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ bwahaha ^ ^ ^ ^ reverse ^ ^ ^ ^ psychology, 
  thank you for your assumed understanding , i 'm sorry to have to delay it further . 
  hopefully the next parts will be out more consistently with the new computer and whatnot . 
  good night . 
  you know , just in case you missed something the first time . 
  you never know . 
  doing this thing takes a surprising amount of time . 
  i may have said that before . 
  i do n't know how limerick used to do it so quickly ; ige is a pain in the ass sometimes . 
  so started high school this week and it caught me off guard . 
  every schoolday is 8 hours , except on fridays , when it 's `` only '' 6,5 hrs . 
  there 's also about 500x more homework than in ground school ( note : this sentence may or may not be exaggerated ) and i actually have to study to tests . 
  or so i 've heard . 
  also me and my family like to go to our holiday house on some weekends , and of course that had to happen on this very weekend . 
  i tried to run the part there , but the network was so slow i could n't load the doc where your actions are . 
  so i 'm back home now running the part ( yay ) and thinking to myself that i do n't have time to do this .
