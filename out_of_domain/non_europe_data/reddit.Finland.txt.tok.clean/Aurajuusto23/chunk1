i could just take 40k pure instead of that . 
  how is 31k 80 % ? 
  83.9 $ x .8 / 2,35 $ = 28.5 k, 
  i just kill myself and inspect them if they have a knife and for guns just default + drop . 
  i heard that there is some cfg file that allows to drop knives but i have n't gotten into it yet . 
  maybe post a screenshot ?

  38 for icarus fell ? 
  i think you got the wrong link on the video mate, 
  yes, 
  well i sold the doppler already but if you want the m4 then yes, 
  i think you should add in-game screenshot aswell so we could see the placement, 
  http://imgur.com/uito8qp i took this for you but if you want i could take some better screens when you get home, 
  well ibp holos add quite a lot of value but i 'm not the guy to tell you how much . 
  but if you want i could take some 4k screenshots for you .

  usp overgrowth ww with 2 kato14 stickers .

  i think you got the wrong price on the gutnilla,

  store needs 5 items and since when is 85-90 % qs ? 
  are you seriously arguing against me that 90 % is n't a quicksell ? 
  exactly, 
  i ca n't find the % appdata % \\ livestreamer \\ plugins folder . 
  do i have to create it or what ? 
  thanks, 
  yeah but it 's a lot easier with a 4k monitor, 
  well i get around 30fps on 4k res with high settings so it 's not really playable, 
  i play on a laptop with 4k screen so you would have to give me quite a lot of skins , 
  200fps on 1280x720, 
  i have to do like 10 guys screens before you but i will accept you when i have time , 
  well you ca n't get a laptop for 400-500 $ that would run cs smoothly, 
  can i get a logo with the name `` rasseeh '' . 
  you can use imagination, 
  not really,

  well my pc runs around 120fps on 2560x1440 but i still prefer the 180-250fps on 1024x768 . 
  but i can agree it is much better for visibility, 
  i think they should add it to the reserve pool,
