  damn i wish that i would live in na now, 
  http://steamcommunity.com/id/rasseeh23 if le is good enough add me , 
  that 's nuts, 
  twitch trying to help moe with his gambling problem, 
  the movement speed is the same on kz servers i belive, 
  guess i 'm lucky since i have n't met any cheaters at lem/supreme lately, 
  shazam left , optic has no bomb . 
  coincidence , i think not . 
  edit : thanks for gold / u/pekek, 
  do you have a team ? 
  top kek, 
  supreme with 48hz and a laptop . 
  i do n't think it 's a huge disadvantage, 
  dmg kek, 
  silver 1 now supreme, 
  yes atm but i will buy a 144hz monitor once i get a new desk for my desktop, 
  added you / id/rasseeh23, 
  only thing is that the movement feels a bit different on 64 tick but there is no difference in aiming/shooting, 
  added you, 
  and i thought i was deaf ... 
  he should get higher fps with those specs since i get around 150fps with i5-4210h and gtx 860m, 
  liquid and g2, 
  yea krimz did it to freakazoid, 
  edit : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egzldhe9ypy ( first clip of the video ), 
  there is no way to see it, 
  source ? 
  they just beat navi on d2 so i guess they are not that bad, 
  i 've noticed this issue only on cache . 
  not other maps, 
  actually you should n't change your sens when you are playing shit, 
  i think you need to wait 7days, 
  i only watched your t-side since i have limited time but here are few things you should look on :, 
  t-pistol : even though you won the round you played the round pretty poorly imo . 
  you bought 2 flashes and a smoke but you did n't even use the smoke and completely failed the first flash . 
  you should think how you are going to use your nades on pistol ( eg . 
  smoke x-box to go short or smoke the cross on long ) before you buy them . 
  buying as a team, 
  i understand that it might be hard to co-operate with people who do n't have/use their mic or just do n't listen , but there were few rounds where you sticked to a glock when atleast 2 of your teammates had ak + kevlar . 
  smoking mid, 
  instead of smoking mid doors use this smoke : https://gfycat.com/deliriousunawarebrownbear, 
  it gives you more cover from awpers and you can go short safer . 
  think what you do, 
  sometimes i felt that you were just running around and not knowing where to go and what to do . 
  ( especially first few rounds ), 
  if your team is not doing a specific strat in the beginning of the round just go maintain map control . 
  if you see that none of your teammates are in tunnels just make sure that the ct 's do n't push there and flank you ), 
  checking corners, 
  sometimes i felt that you just kinda `` checked '' a corner and did n't really expect a ct to be there . 
  just make sure you clear every corner properly and use molotovs to clear out positions . 
  do n't ever assume anything . 
  always expect a ct in that corner when you clear it . 
  in general your crosshair placement seems much better than gn1 and your movement is also decent . 
  just keep on playing and you will get better . 
  and do n't let 1 or 2 pug losses get you down . 
  there is always something you can improve on and you ca n't always win . 
  ( even with 40 + frags ), 
  if you found any of these tips helpful you can add me if you want and we can play faceit together and i could teach you and correct some of your mistakes . 
  sorry for some spelling mistakes english is my 2nd language . 
  have fun playing and learn from your mistakes . 
  dortmund stickers would be awesome, 
  pretty sure you meant group d ( sk , fnatic , faze , g2 ), 
  you can sell them on steam market so the money goes to your steam wallet, 
  download a farm game on your mobile so you could play non-prime valve 64tick matchmaking against spinbotters with pros . 
  sounds awesome, 
  well i do n't think pros play a lot of mm/other official gamemodes so they might not be lvl 21, 
  i have n't met any blatant cheaters at lem-supreme so i can say i 'm pretty happy with prime,

  get a 144hz monitor, 
  just learn the most commone one ways and just spam in the spot if you see it, 
  if you are gn1 how can you expect decent teammates ? 
  you should try this : https://www.reddit.com/r/globaloffensive/comments/4qx7yh/do_you_have_a_decent_pc_with_fps_drops_heres_the/, 
  well i 'm cheering for \\ _ iquid and g2, 
  it 's not an exploit . 
  it 's a part of the game . 
  well i 'm not sure if you are trolling or just dumb . 
  i 've watched all majors since dreamhack winter 2014 and i have n't gotten a single drop, 
  i used to have 400 dpi , 2.1 in-game sens and 2.0 zoom sens. 
  now i changed to 800 dpi and 1.05 in-game sens but 1.0 zoom sens feels much slower now . 
  i 'm not sure but 2.0 zoom sens feels the same on 800 and 400 dpi . 
  is this normal ? 
  i do n't think that is the problem . 
  i have 75hz monitor and it feels better than 60hz but it still looks a bit laggy just becouse it 's not 120/144hz, 
  for a second i though that he got 3 with 1 shot, 
  thanks, 
  16 days and he 's still not home, 
  [ why not ?

  yes . 
  i have i5-4440 and r7 240 and i get stable 250 + fps on 1024x768, 
  do n't use wifi . 
  problem solved, 
  / r/recruitcs, 
  do we really have to make this a thread every week ? 
  and they could buy something on pistol rounds ... 
  aimpunch, 
  space - duck, 
  q - talk, 
  v - ts talk, 
  c - nade, 
  mouse 4 - smoke,
