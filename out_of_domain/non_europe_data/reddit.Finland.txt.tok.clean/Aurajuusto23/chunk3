  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe_iggvn1-i this video helped me a lot . 
  it gave me a whole different view on how to spray . 
  his point is that the vertical line of the crosshair should always be lined up with the target and you should just remember how much you need to pull down .

  it 's much easier to scout a site with smg than ak, 
  well someone in the crowd could send them a message for example when the other team is doing something specific and they would know it when their phone vibrates in the pocket . 
  well in the other hand allowing teams to have infinite technical pauses on online games could be abused very easily, 
  happened to me yesterday but the bomb was outside of the map,
