  shadowplay should n't be very demanding, 
  reposts that you have seen many times before . 
  simple questions that you could just google etc. 
  https://youtu.be/ugfnv7xfgt4?t=15m5s here is anders playing on 3v3 showmatch, 
  if i remember correctly pyth said that he and many other pros used 144hz instead of 180hz, 
  do you need more than 400fps ? 
  and what cpu do you have ? 
  same thing here . 
  i drop to 120 fps sometimes at 1440x1080 with, 
  i5 4440 , gtx 1060, 
  speccy is not very accurate displaying temps afaik, 
  added . 
  2400hrs and smfc, 
  * ** budget ** - < 150 $, 
  * ** source ** - pc, 
  * ** requirements for isolation ** - sometimes going to lan partys so some isolation would be good, 
  * ** will you be using these headphones in public ? 
  * ** preferred type of headphone ** - full-sized, 
  * ** preferred tonal balance ** - balanced i guess, 
  * ** past headphones ** - logitech g430 gaming headset .

  * ** preferred music ** - hip-hop , rap and edm, 
  * ** what would you like to improve on from your set-up ** - more comfortable headphones and more detailed sound,

  cache , mirage , overpass , train , cbble, 
  / r/recruitcs, 
  probably just derankers, 
  what ? 
  i was silver with about 800 hrs and now i 'm global . 
  you can get better if you just grind it out ... 
  1440x1080 bb, 
  well if op does n't know if that is a good pc for cs then i would n't trust his overclocking skills and 6500 is good enough, 
  and certain people would rather use teamspeak instead of discord, 
  how does this have anything to do with my post ? 
  and one res is n't better for awpers than others ... 
  yes i put everything the same that they used to be . 
  but now cs does n't even give the 1440x1080 option in settings . 
  silver 1 now global, 
  do you have bad internet ? 
  windows 10 creators update, 
  well csgo was my first fps on pc and after 2.5 k hours i reached global, 
  i picked up roccat syva earbuds for 10 $ and they are decent for cs, 
  you should really do some research before purchasing products ... you need displayport or dvi-d cable for 144hz, 
  stable 200 + . 
  that 's a great pc for cs, 
  well only for cs 8gb is enough but 16gb is surely worth it if you have the money . 
  newer games tend to require 16gb nowdays, 
  yes, 
  i5-4440 at stock,

  no fall damage ? 
  what did i just read ? 
  go play esea if you do n't want to face 5 man stacks . 
  and most of the 5 man stacks are just bunch of friends playing together not a serious team . . 
  what do you expect in lvl 10 ? 
  casual soloquers or what ? 
  and it is a competitive game and u are complaining that people are trying ? 
  just always spectate the cluthing player in a 1vx situation, 
  same setup , same issues, 
  i ca n't think of a single reason why it should n't be publically available ... 
  i 'm not worried about enforcing the rules but in every other sport the rules are clearly available to the audience ... 
  buy an ssd, 
  yes you can buy any i5/i7 that has the same lga1151 socket for example i5-7600,
