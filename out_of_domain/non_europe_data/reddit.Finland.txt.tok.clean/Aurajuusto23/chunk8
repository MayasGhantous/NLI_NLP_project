  i 'm going to my first lan in 6 weeks and im really excited but i have a problem . 
  at home my table is 120cm wide and i utilize all of it while playing . 
  but at this lan the table is only 75cm wide . 
  should i up my sens ( 1.9@400 ) a bit or buy a smaller keyboard ? 
  ( qpad mk-50 ) do you have any other tips for me ? 
  i 'm 16 yrs old lem from finland and i 'm looking for a serious team . 
  i 'm a rifler but i can play 2nd awp on ct if needed . 
  i 've played in a few team before . 
  i will attend a local lan on 14-16th of october with a bunch of friends but i 'm looking for more serious team to play with . 
  i 'm going to my first cs lan event in 2 weeks with some friends . 
  i 'm currently lem and my friends are global , mge , mg2 and mg1 . 
  we have n't had much time to practice together . 
  what tips would you guys give to me/us ? 
  i have to bring an item or take a photo of it that has some basic characteristics of life but it 's not alive . 
  i know that the characteristics of life are metabolism , organization , homeostasis , growth , adaptation , response to stimuli and reproduction . 
  but i ca n't really think of a thing that fulfills some of those but is not alive . 
  any tips ? 
  sorry for bad english . 
  so i 've had this issue for quite awhile now and it 's really triggering me . 
  whenever i try to open up a demo it 's just freezes completely . 
  i ca n't access console or i ca n't turn off auto director . 
  the only keys that are working are tab and shift + f2 . 
  this only happens when i 'm trying to watch my own mm demos . 
  my esea and faceit demos and pro matches downloaded from hltv are working just completely fine . 
  this problem only occurs on my laptop . 
  i 've tried verifying game cache , reinstalling cs/steam and even reinstalled windows but nothing seems to help .

  if we are playing as 5 man premade and we are in teamspeak it would be great that dead people could talk in game without disturbing people still playing . 
  this should be available only for 5 mans and there should be an on/off toggle in the lobby . 
  how many keys would be a reasonable price for this ?
