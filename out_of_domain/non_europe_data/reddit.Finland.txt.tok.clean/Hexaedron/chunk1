heeelll yeah !, 
  bullfrog games were a huge part of my childhood , dk2 and magic carpet especially . 
  i played the crap out of them and i was really happy when i found about the joys of gog.com . 
  seriously , gog is one of the best things in the internet . 
  most of them, 
  cinnamon flavored everything . 
  ukraine has a conscription based military , so vast majority of their armed forces are reservists , a.k.a. 
  regular people . 
  their active army is small and mostly made of coscripts , who are reluctant to go to war against their own people to say the least . 
  also i assume that the ukrainian generals either support the revolutionalists or have fled to russia like the former president . 
  etimos !, 
  depends on the tank . 
  most modern tanks have two hatches on top and one small emergency hatch at the bottom . 
  merkava has one top hatch and a door-like rear hatch . 
  i doubt that any us helicopter was shot down by an rpg . 
  the chopper should be stationary and flying very low to be hittable with an unguided anti-tank rocket . 
  most likely they were using aa-guns and leftover soviet anti-air missiles . 
  thanks for the reply . 
  it was very informative , and i stand corrected . 
  ( however , there was really no reason to get mad about it . ), 
  yeah , i did n't consider transport helicopters when i commented , i was only thinking about attack helis . 
  uniformu on uniformu . 
  that seems to be the gunner 's controls which are used to use the main gun and the coaxial mg . 
  i 'd like to see how western tanks , which do n't rely on era as much as the russians do , would fare in this test . 
  iirc i had just used most of my money on buidings and those rainbow-colored heavy ships . 
  m1a1 abrams main battle tanks . 
  no idea where they are going , propably a fighting exercise somewhere . 
  i had the same problem . 
  same here . 
  really annoying . 
  this is really cool !, 
  i was a leopard 2a4 gunner in the finnish defence forces , and it is nice to see all the differences and similarities . 
  for example in the leopard , the loader sets the ballistics when he loads the cannon instead of the gunner like in here . 
  also i would 've liked those magnifications , leo had just 4x and 12x with thermal and only 12x with day sights . 
  basically only thing i disagree with here is that there is only one ocular for the main sights . 
  does n't it make your eyes tired ? 
  but it is cool to see that i could propably be able to operate these without much additional training . 
  we used to say that a well-trained monkey could be a leo2 gunner , seems that it 's true for the abrams also . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant . 
  at least my eyes start hurting if i use them `` unevenly '' . 
  afaik early versions of t-34 had four man crews , where the gunner also acted as a commander , but later a fifth man was added . 
  a tank is only as good as its crew . 
  the difference between porn and erotica is that in erotica the woman says `` slower '' , in porn she says `` faster '' . 
  they 're always something cool like dragons or fairies or elfs , are n't they ? 
  for some reason none of these otherkin have just someday realised that `` oh , i would actually be a platypus if i was n't stuck in this meatsuit ! '', 
  personally , i am a koala-kin . 
  that 's my excuse for doing nothing but sleep and eat all day . 
  cringe themselves into turning an actual dragon . 
  there 's a 1 in 32,8 chance that 42 % of all statistics are bullshit . 
  wait a minute , why young ? 
  thats ageism right there !, 
  i want a 92-years old black trans female bisexual link !, 
   3d printing is just not used as a production technique . 
  ... yet . 
  `` that 's no moon . 
  it 's a space station . '', 
  yes . 
  - dad, 
  xe has an interesting way of spelling `` etiquette '' . 
  this `` its not my job to educate u '' attitude is one of my top annoyances with the sjw community . 
  if * you * make a claim , it ** is ** your job to educate others about it . 
  providing additional info , sources and proof when requested . 
  telling others to `` try googling it shitlord '' is not how you do it . 
  of course europe is just marked as a single evil empire . 
  yay for bad history . 
   before money , you could only trade corn to people that wanted corn . 
  is n't that kinda true for a money economy also ? 
  i 'd put it more like `` before money , you could only trade corn to people who had something you wanted in return . '', 
  but yeah , / u/princeowales did n't make sense . 
  for example , let 's say * a * makes corn and likes cheese , * b * makes fish and likes corn and * c * makes cheese and likes fish . 
  to make things a little more difficult , * a * , * b * and * c * do n't know each others ' preferences . 
  in a barter economy , * a * , who wants cheese but does n't like fish , does n't want to sell any of his corn to * b * , because * b * only makes fish . 
  * b * on the other hand does n't want any cheese but would like to eat some of that delicious corn * a * makes . 
  * c * does n't like corn but loves fish , so he only wants to buy stuff from * b * . 
  so in order to any trading to happen , someone must take a risk trading their stuff for something they do n't actually want to eat and hope that they can use that stuff to buy things they like . 
  in an economy where money is a universally accepted medium of exchange , while * b * still could n't sell his fish to * a * , * a * can sell his corn to * b * and then use the money to buy cheese from * c * . 
  less risk , more trading , happier people . 
  in general . 
  actually , amsterdam is quite diverse . 
  being a major trade port for hundreds of years tends to do that . 
  well sending death threats to anyone , whether they are idiots or not , is kinda fucked up thing to do . 
  yeah , because every place in the world is just like the us to them . 
  they are all against `` cultural appropriation '' and `` oppression '' without even knowing anything about cultures other than the one they live in . 
  i 'm from finland . 
  it was weird having to tell an american girl that reindeers do actually exist .

  i already posted this : http://www.reddit.com/r/tumblrinaction/comments/29tvqf/the_oppressed_cant_be_racistsexist_because_a/, 
  no problem , 
  and yeah , we all have that one fb friend ... 
  you know what i hate when people type like this i think its really hard to read, 
  capturing from the enemy is the only proper way to obtain tanks . 
  pay the iron price , 
  i hope the ssbu ganondorf looks as great as this one . 
  yeah , those tubes you see on top of the barrel are pyrotechnics . 
  though during my army time , we actually never used them . 
  still had to install them every damn time for some reason ... 
  actually they are pyrotechnics for the simulator system . 
  smoke grenade dischargers are the tubes at the side of the turret .
