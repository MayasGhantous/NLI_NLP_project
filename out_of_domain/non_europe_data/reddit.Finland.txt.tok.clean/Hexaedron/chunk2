  for no reason . 
  sounds nice !, 
  what software did you use ? 
  corsets , garter belts and thigh highs . 
  bonus points if the girl is a bit chubby . 
  well you definitely do n't want to go to there for the eastern european cuisine ... 
  eesti can never into nordic . 
  if you 're on pc you can change the field of vision via console commands . 
  `` i do n't have time to sleep let alone make a card xd '', 
  wtf ? 
  it takes literally five minutes , or 10 if you want to use a lot of effort . 
  yet she does seem to have time to whine about nothing in facebook ... 
  falcon sneeze !, 
  not for me it was n't . 
  that 's a leopard 2a4 in finland , can tell from the registration number and the camo coloring . 
  land of democracy !, 
  because a superior officer told them to . 
  in the army , snow is not a requirement for skiing , it 's merely an advantage ... 
  we have leopards . 
  only in armoured engineer company . 
  they are used as mine roller vehicles , and are currently being phased out completely . 
  [ t\u00e4ss\u00e4 ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1n4lom/feminism_apparently_responsible_for_the_fall_of/ ) yksi helmi . 
  nope , this pic is way older . 
  i saw it first time over a year ago . 
   she has a thing for him, 
  oh you !, 
  when you wake up to have the worst hangover ever , your id is missing , you are out of money , your shoes are outside of the front door of your apartment block , your eyeglasses are broken and your only memory from the night is you trying to enter your neighbors apartment multiple times . 
  money well spent, 
  do n't look at the comments . 
  seriously . 
  now that sounds like pratchett . 
  small ? 
  that would be impossible to wield irl . 
  it looks like a sledgehammer and you call it lightweight . 
  how long do elves live in tes ? 
   `` hyv\u00e4t ja huo ... '' this video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by sanoma entertainment finland / nelonen media . 
  ... aand it 's gone . 
  that 's not bread - that 's [ kalakukko ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalakukko ) !, 
  basically fish inside a bread . 
  tastes like fish and bread . 
  that 's russian national squatting team performing a `` triple ivan '' . 
  this advanced maneuver helped them beat estonia in last year 's slavlympics . 
  there 's a big russian minority in estonia . 
  would it be something like [ this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbczkz3ghb8 ), 
  `` daggerfall '' would be a cool name ... 
  i looked up whatrisesmustfall.tumblr.com and it seems ( s ) he is a radical muslim , almost all of their posts are about islam or defending isis . 
  so i would n't say this post has anything to do with social justice . 
  c&c : red alert ? 
  oh yeah , because in real life all other wars were oh so exciting and not at all boring or terrifying . 
  jaah . 
  [ katti ] ( http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--mqhxl5kh--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/owxtcbb3v5q8ra2vll2h.jpg ), 
  plus additional frontal hull armor, 
  it 's warm enough . 
  the engine can be set to warm the crew compartment . 
  finland , actually . 
  those aks and tanker caps are from the good old t-72 days . 
  it definitely is . 
  just playing holland , i took 2 provinces from flanders and the next thing i know almost all minor nations in europe have something like -70 ae penalty and everyone joins a coalition against me . 
  happened to me as well . 
  tuon alkoholia . 
  but can poland finally into space ? 
  dude , you just found a cure for cancer . 
  usa , bringing freedom and democracy to the third world !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buxz4bys8kw ) is a pretty good list . 
  i 'd like to add podracing because it 's fun and order 66 . 
  i 've always thought that if they were n't so difficult , they would be very mediocre fantasy rpgs . 
  like the difficulty is the only thing making them so popular . 
  ... and you would be a [ eunuch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castrato#history ) . 
  i wonder why all fantasy games and movies love torches so much . 
  irl they would be very shitty sources of light and a serious fire hazard . 
  also they would fill your house with smoke . 
  almost all tanks have emergency escape hatches in the bottom . 
  peacekeeping . 
  well the thieves guild questline is prety badly written . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=14422 ) sums up my thoughts about it pretty well . 
  great tc , jumps off his vehicle when he sees an enemy tank ... 
  yeah , because a pointy hat = kkk / s, 
  `` workgoddammit '' , propably . 
  the stabilizer did n't seem to want to cooperate . 
  hydraulics and finnish winter do n't match ... 
  well , it certainly ca n't be attributed to his video gaming skills ... 
   warriors working alongside elephants would have been armoured . 
   the best of the infantry is also suspiciously lightly equipped . 
  everyone knows that only europeans used heavy armour , everyone else wore rags or , even better , were completely naked to appear more honourable as warriors of a noble barbarian culture . 
  2/5 too much sand . 
  - ign, 
  [ my reaction ] ( http://imgur.com/gallery/bo7rmkk ) to this and when i learned that aoe2 has recently gotten 2 new expansions with new civilizations and numerous balance changes . 
  impressive . 
  that 's usa for you, 
  propably not much , they were soviet military after all ... 
  they have only used type 74 tanks in that show though . 
  [ phuketti ] ( http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/phuket/portals/phuket-com/homepage/nightlife/phuket-town/pagepropertiesimage/top-phuket-town-nightlife.jpg ), 
  i think he looks a bit too young . 
  he 's supposed to be the second oldest of the four brothers ( balon , euron , victarion , aeron ) but he looks young enough to be balon 's son . 
  well on the other hand a helicopter flying really high would make it an easy target for anti-air missiles . 
  koskinen is by far the best player in the finnish team . 
  stellar goalkeeping . 
  fighting in a swampy area sucks no matter the equipment . 
  i 'm lsd and the purple elephant-snake is saying mean things to me :(,
