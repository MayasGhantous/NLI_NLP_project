  i 'm not even pregnant at the moment and i would be totally pissed . 
  it was something like 21 when i felt first ones and placenta was n't even in the way . 
  totally healthy baby came out . 
  we were pretty young and my friend wanted to spend labours day with her new boyfriend but did n't want to be left alone since she thought they would otherwise move too fast . 
  i was friend with that guy too and first of all it seemed like a nice evening to hang out together . 
  we got to his house and went to his room to listen music . 
  they both were laying in bed while i was sitting in sofa and we were just chatting . 
  soon they started to cuddle and do some mild touching and making out which progresses to long kissing sessions soon . 
  i 'm getting very uncomfortable , guy gives me death stares to go away and leave them alone , meanwhile girl signals that i 'm not allowed to leave anywhere . 
  in a duration of time which seemd like forever , guy visit the bathroom , propably helping himself off since i was on their way and i told the girl that this is a horrible idea . 
  we got some other friends to come over and evening continued with having innocent fun time , althought the guy still gave me pretty angry vibe . 
  i do n't want to ruin your joy but b -  d -  a seems to be my sad boob story 1 year after giving birth and still breastfeeding , where did my boobs go ?? 
  this years january ? 
  oh dear you are fast !, 
  these are so cute !, 
  they are fine , just pictures from show with titles `` book reader/show watcher reaction '' . 
  mine too . 
  my baby looks exactly same when she is about to start cry and even sounds same . 
  whole baby part of the episode was personally most distressing got experience so far . 
  i was just keeping my fingers crossed that we would n't see him getting mutilated or otherwise harmed . 
  1000x times this . 
  try to take photos every day . 
  there is only few weeks when they look like newborns . 
  babies change so much during first year that documenting the change and looking back the photos is amazing . 
  my first random `` are you pregnant ? '', 
  was 39 +6 , day before my daughter was born . 
  to be fair , i was mostly pregnant during winter time and that was one freaking cold winter so everybody looked more or less pregnant with huge coats and tons of layers of clothes . 
  toilet breaks . 
  for example , going to mall . 
  toilet -  dress up -  toilet -  leave house , go to mall -  toilet -  eat something -  toilet -  do groceries -  toilet -  go home -  toilet . 
  it was horrible . 
  atleast need to pee all the time was gone immediately after giving birth . 
  not / u/pulsehead obviously , but i asked same kind of question from my husband . 
  he said that he did n't even notice the other weight gain , just cute belly with his child there and huge boobs . 
  dpo5 and bored . 
  i know it 's too early to show any symptons and bit sceptical since last cycle was 27 days and now the ovulation was on day 17 so if we would follow the same pattern the lp will be absolutely too short . 
  onni adolf , laura something , annikki emilia and jarl arvo . 
  and write jamie instead of jaime !, 
  it 's completely fine , here in finland we usually tell the name few months after the baby is born when it 's time for babtism / another kind of name giving party . 
  i find it almost funny that here in bumpers everybody already knows the name , what if the baby does n't look like the name ? 
  ouch . 
  although i can have some sympathy for her , beign pregnant and no one bothers to show up in your babyshower would be awful . 
  so i get the feelings , but this is not the best way to represent those . 
  1 ) finland, 
  2 ) cause i want baby and this seems to be good place where i can post everytime i feel like it without feeling too spammy . 
  3 ) propably , i made a blanket and sleepingbag for my first one so atleast blanket for the next one too . 
  4 ) dpo 6 i think , not feeling too lucky from this cycle though . 
  5 ) i 'm trying to gain weight to get pregnant more easily . 
  mine started 20 + and it took few weeks before they started to be regular . 
  if you are worried you could try to do chart about the time of kicks to get idea of their normal day schedule , my baby was always taking long morning naps after i woke up which first was a little scary . 
  here is a nice info about these . 
  my kid said \u00e4iti ( mom ) for a first time in age of 9 months and it 's not exactly a word you say accidentally . 
  it has n't been issue for us so try to keep your hopes up , she may or may not bite you . 
  i like linus , reminds me of linus torvalds who created linux . 
  e like how rihanna sings `` under my umbrella , ella , ella ella , *** ee *** - ee '' and lin just like fee *** lin *** . 
  my opinion is biased with the fact that that 's how you pronounce it in finland . 
  i 'm not going to say if this happens or not since with confirmation to any direction you know to wait or not wait this to happen . 
  just saying that i have seen this kind of post before and seriously , not all pms were real spoilers , of course most were . 
  so stay on your toes . 
  i hope the baby will stick around and just wanting to keep you on your toes . 
  about the wine and other stuff , do n't worry , it takes few weeks before placenta and umbilical cord are really done and working , before that you do n't affect to the baby much with what you eat . 
  alcohol/prize ratio is pretty good . 
  laugh and go home . 
  joys of beign adult !, 
  if you were really thin , your body may just be collecting extra fat to be able to breatfeed . 
  that was atleast what my nurse explained when i was bit horrified to collect almost 20kg during pregnancy . 
  suomenlinna is really nice but you should check the weather forecast . 
  also if at the end of the month means 31.5 , schools end at the same day and it means suomenlinna is full of drunken teenagers . 
  linnanm\u00e4ki could be okay , there is no fee to enter and 11 rides without fee also , most are for under 100/120cm so they should suit to your kids very well . 
  there is also sea life in linnanm\u00e4ki which is huge aquarium . 
  snadistadi is inside adventure park , i have n't tried it by myself but heard lot of good and going there soon with my kid . 
  korkeasaari is zoo if your kids are interested . 
  if the weather is really bad museum of natural history is a cool place to visit . 
  heureka in vantaa is interesting place , kinda science center , but your kids maybe bit too youg to really appreciate the place . 
  finally a thread i can use this onliner : as a mother , i would like to have time . 
  if there is small kids on the picture , freetime , bigger kids but not yet teens , something you created yourself , even if its just picture . 
  teens , yep , still something you made by yourself . 
  if already out of the home , time to visit me . 
  if there is grandchildren , copy previous ideas while not including the first , two birds with one stone , give the mother of my grandchildren some free time by bringing the kids over here . 
  our lo also co-sleeps most of the nights but we stopped night feeding few months ago , it has helped her sleeping so much and she only wakes up once a night at max anymore . 
  good luck for you too !, 
  i know this is n't the end of the world but today it feels like it . 
  and i really blame the breastfeeding . 
  it makes me lose weight gram after gram and i 'm pretty certain my body thinks it just ca n't handle both pregnancy and breastfeeding same time . 
  at this point of show it 's definately spoiler that certain characters will be alive in adwd . 
  i had spotting from week 8 to week 14 and those weeks were horrible . 
  baby was all right and they never found out what caused the spotting but it was awful experience , especially one night when there was bit more brighter blood . 
  but yeah , spotting is n't abnormal , it 's not always negative sign , but also never positive , just neutral thing . 
  i feel for you , somehow the fact that others have managed to get siblings to their babies is somewhat crushing . 
  did it took long to conceive your son ? 
  my daughter was pretty easy thing , ttc 2 and done . 
  that had led me to believe in my fertility way more than i should believe it seems . 
  it 's really easy , cheap and gives you more time to sleep . 
  i 've been breastfeeding 13 months now and pretty much zero issues . 
  of course it can be hard but most of the time mom and baby can to work their little issues and then it 's easy . 
  the 3 months were hardes , first baby is just eating all the time and atleast i got frustarated with beign stuck . 
  try to prepare nice place for breastfeeding , coutch with books and bottle of water maybe . 
  i managed to pile enough pillows next to my computer so i could play and breastfeed same time . 
  when the baby is ~ 3 months old , they usually have need to order more milk and are eating all the time again . 
  i think that is the point when most mothers who have had strugles give up .
