  or did i miss anything else ? 
  is ginger ale recommended there ? 
  just wondering since ginger was moved to nope-list four years ago in here because some of the chemicals in it caused cell deaths .

  i managed to collect 20kg and lost 23kg later without doing anything else besides breastfeeding . 
  first 15kg went away in few months and rest was something like 1.5-2kg / month . 
  it definitely was n't difficult , i ate like a horse but those babies burn calories so much . 
  are you sure it 's certainly your size he is afraid of or maybe he has that pretty common misconception men seem to be having that sex may hurt or poke the baby . 
  try to talk to him and good luck !, 
  [ about the blue rose ] ( #g `` blue rose has often been interpreted to mean lyanna stark . '' ), 
  this is just a theory and have n't been confirmed in any published books yet :, 
  [ theory behind the blue rose ] ( #g `` plenty of fans believe that jon snow is son of lyanna and it would refer to him and that quote from house of undying is one of the `` main proofs '' '' ), 
  [ more about the blue rose in wall ] ( #g '' rhaegar targaryen seems to be only man with lyanna during the possible baby making period , so dragons , dragons everywhere !, 
  and also the whole name of the serie , song of ice ( lyanna ) and fire ( rhaegar ) '' ) there is of course plenty of other possible theories so you are very welcome to wrap your own cute tinfoilhat in / r/asoiaf, 
  i love roman !, 
  and all your girl names , oh my gosh , they are fantastic !, 
  those make me bitter that i 'm not from english speaking country . 
  your daughter is terminally ill , there is nothing we can do . 
  what happened ? 
  i mean how do you get spoiled about quentyn , pycelle and kevan but not about griffs ? 
  second trimester energy boost was biggest lie ever . 
  i only got lot 's of ideas what to do but energy to do it ? 
  nope . 
  i 'd like to know what he really thinks , how he sees the world and what his motivations are . 
  especially during [ asos ] ( #b `` his engagement when margaery shows him how to be loved by your people and also his death '' ), 
  best explanation i have hear is that wisdom keeps you away from problems that intellect can solve . 
  i have the first one . 
  it was interesting to be pregnant with that allergy when i needed antibiotics . 
  amoxicillin belongs to penicillin family so doctors are afraid to give prescription for any of those and pregnancy took good chunk of antibiotics from the available list too . 
  you go girl !, 
  i did those 7 days row and finally cervix gave up and lo was born 40 +0 !, 
  ouch . 
  my personal favourite was those who were n't even planning kids yet and when i told we already have decided names but did n't reveal yet . 
  `` oh fine , but xxx and xxx are reserved for my future kids '' . 
  same here . 
  since there has been very long and warm summer , bees are everywhere and now they are so freaking pissed of since their queen dumbed them . 
  just few days ago one was trying to attack me ( = was less than 1m from me , clearly an attack ) i got so panicked that i started to hyperventilate and in the end could n't feel my nose and fingers . 
  edit . 
  try to smile , i 'm going to send film about this to your kids . 
  margaery knows how to make people love her and how to do public stunts . 
  with olenna as vice president , they could be awesome power duo . 
  it 's okay honey , everybody needs to rant every now and then . 
  i 'm on cycle 5 and every new pregnancy announcement is like punch in the belly . 
  i 'm so afraid for this cycle . 
  if/when af comes , it will be next saturday which is also day when my sister and my bil will reveal the name of their newborn . 
  i 'm not sure how i 'm gon na cope if i 'm going to start cycle 6 during same day . 
  it 's not worst over all but worst that does n't translate that i can think of . 
  in finnish `` haista kukkanen '' translates to `` sniff flowers '' . 
  daycare assistant , it would be my duty to keep swings moving and provide proper sand cakes for kids to smash . 
  also yesterday . 
  it 's awesome moment but it 's starting to be annoying when everyone seems to be posting it after reading it . 
  not from my head , but my legs . 
  my leg hairs pretty much stopped growing , i shaved 3 times during pregnancy and they looked pretty smooth . 
  last time was after my water broke and i was bored while waiting to go to hospital . 
  try to stay positive , if it 's as it was with my pregnancy , you can still paint your toenails , do shavings by yourself and be able overcome that tummy obstacle !, 
  hopefully everything is fine . 
  i was spotting for 6 weeks from week 8 to 14 and those weeks were horror . 
  everything was totally fine but few times when spotting turned from brown to red i was just crying in corner . 
  have fun there !, 
  i 'm still playing but of course not as much as i did when dd was n't born yet . 
  pet battles are nice way to waste time without restricting your time more than minute at a time . 
  i learned the hard way that dungeons are no go unless there is other adult able to attend baby even if she just fell asleep . 
  i feel for you , cd 1 of round 6 just started 5 minutes ago . 
  i 'm just so dissapointed and confused , this is n't what i planned at all . 
  i know , it just sucks to think all those ifs . 
  * if i had had positive from first cycle , we would already know gender . 
  * if i had had positive during first 3 cycle , i could have given birth in same hospital as i did with number two . 
  * if i had had positive from first 4 cycle there would have been that 2 year gap we thought would be maximum gap we wished . 
  * and worst , if i had had positive when we first started to hope for second ( breastfeeding messed everything for the first year after birth so not really cycles there ) , he or she would had already been born , already flashed their first smile and learning to turn over . 
  yep . 
  dd turned one last april and during this summer started all those `` so when there will be number two '' . 
  i know we have been open that we want more than one child but still it 's annoying to hear those questions . 
  it 's in finland , we do n't have gender reveal parties or anything so besides occasional baby shower , name revealing party / babtism is the only baby party you have and it 's held after the baby is born . 
  it was extremely interesting book but atleast for me , it was heavy reading . 
  i could only read few chapters and then feel like exhausted . 
  robin hobb stop acting like you are nice and sweet lady when you torture your characters mentally in a way that grrm looks like blushing maid compared to you . 
  have you tried different kind of milks ? 
  i do n't know what are they called in your place but atleast here you can choose between 0 % , 1 % , 1,5 % and 3 % fat in your milk , also organic , non homogenisized etc. 
  my kid hated milk first but when we started to give her the 3 % organic she was much more tolerable . 
  sorry for weird sentences , food vocabulary is n't exactly my strongest part of english . 
  how is my marriage going ? 
  hintti is one of the words for gay in finnish and hintikka is trying to use some kind of pet name of hintti . 
  i think it 's enough if you are there for him when he reaches out for you . 
  my 17 month old daughter is bit same way , she may focus for her own things for a long time and then there is moments when she just wants to sit on my lap and read books . 
  wtf ? 
  for the first few weeks , your duty is to keep yourself and baby alive and well fed . 
  everything else is either someone elses responsibility or can wait . 
  good luck , you can do it !, 
  yellowstone caldera is erupting at full force . 
  he is now studying in university after working for few years and just split up with his boyfriend . 
  mommy comes to take you after naptime , have a good day sweetheart . 
  what did i do in army . 
  spices . 
  you should try to make a list of everything you use during few days/weeks that you do n't yet have in your new home or ca n't take with you from old . 
  kid is 17 months and according to husband , does n't feel any different . 
  only thing i notice is that one stitch did n't hold properly so now there is kinda like dent , like in candy bags `` open from here '' . 
  if i 'd be brave enough i would get that tattooed over there but on serious thought , not before hell freezes . 
  sookie stackhouse novels . 
  serie had gone bit downhill for the last few books but the final book was horrible . 
  it felt like author just wanted to show off all the old characters and to me , sookies final decision of who she would choose was totally wrong , out of character and out of storyline .
