  cycle breakdown :, 
  1-7 periods, 
  8-10 boring waiting, 
  13 bd and o as far as i know . 
  15/dpo 2 bd just in case o was late . 
  16-19 / dpo 3-5 nothing special . 
  20-22 / dpo 6-7 spending weekend with friends ( this is important later ) . 
  23/dpo 8 i 'm not temping but felt bit sick and thought to check . 
  37,5 c , at evening it 's back to normal 36,2 c. 
  i think i got mild flu from friend . 
  24/dpo 9 just in case checking fever since i should go to seminar , not even feeling sick but 37,3 c. 
  25/dpo 10 totally not feeling sick but for some reason still checking , 37,1 c feeling bit hopeful but got bfn and thought this was it . 
  26/dpo 11 nothing special but remembered that just before getting first before positive for my daughter i thought i was getting flu in the middle of summer . 
  27/dpo 12 faintest bfp ever . 
  i did the test , stared it for few minutes and gave up since it was totally blank . 
  left it to shelf for a moment and after that was carrying it to trash can and though : `` now i 'm hallusinating line there , i 'm officially going mad '' , but desided not to dump it yet . 
  half minute later and realized it 's not hallusination . 
  28/dpo 13 this is the day when periods should had arrived . 
  still very faint positive and i 'm freaking out so badly that it will end up way too early again since i 'm feeling weird in my tummy but not sure if it 's because i 'm pregnant , soon not pregnant or just because i 'm freaking out and hypocondriach . 
  29 / dpo 14 well now the test clearly is n't faint and double lines can be seen from meters away . 
  what did i do , what did i not do and what did i symptom spot :, 
  we used pre-seed and husband had been forced to drink grapefruit juice for whole cd 1-15 and to abandon all underwears etc when ever possible . 
  i took prenatals . 
  i gave up pineapple stuff since it seemed like waste of time and money . 
  same with smep , felt like waste of energy . 
  i did n't symptom spot much . 
  biggest hint should had been that weird morning fever but it took few days to take it seriously . 
  nothing else really . 
  i really am hopeful that this one will stick since symptoms and lines are mimicking my first pregnancy while one that ended up with mc was totally different . 
  mc bfp was strong line at dpo 9 , actually stronger than my now dpo 14 line . 
  uljas onni tapani was born last night bit after midnight at 19w +0 . 
  he was perfect little boy who we got to hold in our arms . 
  most likely the hematoma i had in uterus got infected and it had spread to placenta . 
  it comforts a little that there was nothing we could have done , even if we would have been eating antibiotics every day during this pregnancy , it most likely would n't have helped . 
  i understand i 'm still pretty much in shock but at the moment i feel somewhat hopeful . 
  this was n't our fault , we can do this again and next time it will be different . 
  meanwhile our daughter will be our best therapist and suffer overload of hugs and kisses . 
  for all you lovely ladies in alumni thread . 
  thank you for your enormous support during this pregnancy , you were there for me at each step . 
  i wish you all long , boring pregnancies which will end up with angrily screaming baby , or in case of / u/pscalici , two babies in your arms . 
  i 'm sorry but i really ca n't follow that thread for a while atleast and i hope and think you understand it . 
  i hope i will get back there before all of you progress from it !, 
  we need to wait few months atleast before starting to try again to get all the test results and also of course i need to have my periods back . 
  so after that i 'll see you in ttc thread . 
  for you ladies there , i mean this with all the best intents , go away from there , leave it all to me and fill the alumni thread . 
  edit : just to add the insult , my last mc 's edd would have been in 3 days . 
  so if this would have been perfect world , that pregnancy would had been viable and now we would have full term baby . 
  today wo n't be my clearest grammar and writing so sorry about that , please do n't point out errors unless they make whole thing to lose its sense . 
  atleast grammatical tenses are most likely complete mess . 
  i 'll put some paragraphing so you can avoid parts that are too much for you . 
  i know most of this is n't easies thing to read . 
  first about what happened , this is propably the heavies part to read so skip it if detailed description of mc are too much for you , i 'll bold small part of the text when it stops detailing birth process :, 
  everything happened so fast . 
  as i have been telling in alumni thread , i had strong braxton hicks / contractions since last tuesday . 
  i visited er and everything was fine , hematoma was going away and that caused contractions . 
  they said i should n't worry too much about them in this case . 
  saturday evening there was contractions once again and guess they were real one . 
  just before midnight my water broke . 
  i even heard the sound or atleast i think i heard . 
  i immediately went to bathroom to lay on the floor and husband called 112 . 
  while i have been whining about our living situation and my bil living with us , this time it was god sent thing . 
  we just said to him that ambulance is coming , here is dog , kid is sleeping , please call mil and fil to take care of our daughter . 
  ambulance came in few minutes and same time i started to bleed . 
  i have n't been actually bleeding last week , just clotting and more liquid hematoma discharge but no actual bleeding . 
  there was huge clots and they had to get me to chair to get me downstairs before chair could had been inserted to bed mode . 
  they carried me to ambulance and drove to hospital . 
  husband followed us and was ready on er door when we got there . 
  at er my only thought was that this is very painful and i 'm no way going to push , i could still feel him kicking , i think that was the last time . 
  then they started to move me to maternity ward but while we were waiting for elevator , i felt how contraction also brought my little babys head out and in elevator he was born . 
  until that moment , i had somehow believed that miracle could happend and we would n't lose this one but then i completely broke down . 
  it was n't crying , it was howling and screaming . 
  some of you have propably seen game of thrones and heard catelyn at red wedding . 
  well that was me . 
  husband said that 20 years from this and he will still see nightmares of that sound and my face . 
  personally there is very blurry part after that but we got to our room and placenta came out . 
  we got to hold him in our arms then . 
  from water breaking to having him in my arms was no more than 45 minutes . 
  ** why ** this happened and how i 'm feeling about this ? 
  ( this section will explain reasons behind mc and other medical stuff but not really about birth process ) :, 
  so worst case scenario had happened . 
  all this is still bit speculation since autopsy results will take some time . 
  bacteria , propably from vagina had gotten to cervix while hematoma had kept cervix bit open and then from there to remaining hematoma and uterus . 
  placenta had strong signs of infection and that had cause labour to start . 
  what makes this comforting is that there was nothing we could have done . 
  going to er few hours or days earlier and noticing that my [ crp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/c-reactive_protein ) was rising would n't have helped , even if i would have eaten antibiotics every day of my pregnancy would n't have helped . 
  they would n't have affected inside the uterus enough . 
  it 's truly a good thing . 
  i ca n't blame myself , not husband , doctor , some sick person who i accidentally saw since it was most likely normal vaginal bacteria in wrong place . 
  ** about ** uljas , his name and himself :, 
  uljas onni tapani is his name . 
  we had been debating for two totally different name combinations lately . 
  uljas had been our favourite but there was another strong candidate . 
  issue with uljas was that directly translated , uljas means chivalry , from one of our favourite books , robin hobbs farseer series . 
  her big sister also has her third name from those books . 
  back to uljas . 
  uljas also is the name they use prince charming in childrens books and fairytales , so there was kinda big risk that he would have been teased about being prince uljas and asked when he is going to save some princesses . 
  this in unfortunate solution but now no one will make fun of that name , although i ca n't watch any of those movies with finnish dubs for a while . 
  onni is also my grandfathers name who died over 20 years ago . 
  while i was only 9 when he died , somehow he has always been role model of pure love . 
  while my other grandparents , parents and some other people love me , onni was loving me like you love your own kid , with no conditions .
