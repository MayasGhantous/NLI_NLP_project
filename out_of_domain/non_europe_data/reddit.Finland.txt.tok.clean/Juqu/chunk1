  i wish that i would have done drinking and driving . 
  last year i was wondering if i should take my car or my brothers bicycle when going into bar . 
  when i was driving bicycle back from the bar i forget that it 's brakes did n't work properly . 
  crashed head first into rock.result was weeks in hospital and ugly scar . 
  had i gone with my familiar car i would n't have crashed , or at least steel frame would have kept me save . 
  who else first thought , that this was about the island of java ? 
  well at least us dominates the top spots .

  [ ] ( / wat `` le test '' ), 
  i just finished reading ciguatera . 
  thanks for recommendation , would have probably missed it otherwise . 
  i 'm 30 hours in to my first jrpg , lost odyssey . 
  lack of anime and adolescent dialogue has been positive surprise . 
  my prejudices against jrpg 's are crumbling . 
  shamanism . 
  early humans lived shamanistic societies . 
  over time other religions have come to being by people twisting their believes . 
  i second this is not my life ,, 
  it 's worth watching . 
  dumped into river . 
  does n't drown .

  / r/cheatatmathhomework, 
  alternate history is one of my favourite genres . 
  i prefer `` alien space bats '' scenarios like turledove 's worldwar series . 
  lizard aliens invading in the year 1942 makes awesome reading .

  there is study that says that around 350 icelanders might be of distant native american ancestry . 
  r/asatru has link to online library about norse mythology . 
  [ `` massive library of heathen books , including some hard to find and out of print volumes '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/asatru/comments/glyk5/massive_library_of_heathen_books_including_some/ ),

  christianisation of northern europe was even more brutal than what happened to native americans . 
  [ northern crusades ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/northern_crusades ), 
  why are shops in the usa allowing use of several coupons per purchase ? 
  in finland all coupons have small print :, 
  `` only one coupon at time , can not be used with other offers '', 
  r/fitness is wrong place to ask this question . 
  it 's like going to pro-ana forum to ask if you are too thin . 
  you should probably ask about this from family or friends , people whom you know in real live . 
  good to see other digital distribution platforms . 
  my first experience with steam was so frustrating that i swore never to use it .

  relaxing in sauna is my favourite part of the day . 
  that 's not what the article says . 
  `` every religion the world over has a legend about what happens to you when you die . '', 
  no mention about the afterlife . 
  if you have problem with jesus you should consecrate on trolling r/christianity . 
  the userbase on r/religion is wider and more balanced . 
  i visit both r/religion and r/atheism for the same reasons :, 
  to give upvotes for posts that praise norse gods or mock christianity . 
  i guess that you have not met redditor called [ i_only_say_lol ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/i_only_say_lol ),

  * `` how could a human look into the natural world and find religion ? 
  as a child i understood that there were two competing religions around me . 
  christianity and old gods worshipped by finns before crusades . 
  churches were boring places filled with grim people . 
  on opposite to that was the nature which power i could feel in the waves and in the storms . 
  when i grow older and realised that i was only one associating power of the nature with finnish gods , i was truly dismayed . 
  reminds me of lady grey . 
  `` do n't correct others ' grammar and spelling . 
  it does n't add to the conversation . 
  also , correcting one 's grammar or spelling is not a valid manner of refuting one 's point . '',
