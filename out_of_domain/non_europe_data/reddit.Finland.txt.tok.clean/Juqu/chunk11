  i recently got witcher 2 from the library . 
  it 's ok rpg , but i only got few days left and i thing that i 'm not going finish it . 
  starting with second game i felt little bit out of the loop . 
  so getting the first one first might be good idea . 
  if you can get the games for cheap , i 'd recommend buying them .

  aldmeri and stormcloaks first among many .

  after learning about their true nature i wanted but all of them to the sword . ], 
  second playtrought i played as orc and sided with stormcloaks . 
  i was chieftain of a small orc stronghold . 
  better to have old war buddy as neighbouring king than some imperial puppet . 
  ulfric rules norths , dragonborn rules orcs . 
  both peoples are happy to stick to themselves . 
  pandora ? 
  i got downvoted for asking the same question . 
  they are likely talking about [ pandora radio ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pandora_radio ) , some kind yankee spotify . 
  edit : looks like spotify isnt available in canada either . 
  you guys have it rought . 
  germans were on offensive on almost half of the time on easternfront and managed to maintain positive kill ratio . 
  also when the war turned against germans , soviets , had massive superiority in numbers but german army still managed to keep up positive k/d as late as 1944 .
