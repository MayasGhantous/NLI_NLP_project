  just look at the [ expanded imaginarynetwork ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarynetwork ) , lots small specific sub that help each other grow . 
  i think that same applies here . 
  if the smaller subs gain subscribers it will also increase activity at the r/lostgirl .

  in [ finnish civil war ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomen_sis%c3%a4llissota ) reds executed 1 400 -- 1 650 in red terror and whites between 7 000 -- 10 000 in white terror . 
  this picture is aftermath of battle of tampere . 
  whites captured reds biggest city and took 11000 prisoners . 
  executions of red leaders and russians began immediately after the fall of the city .

  i made couple of post 's about your game . 
  let 's hope that it raises the awareness .

  maybe that line is there so that people realise that they have completed the tutorial , and do n't have to follow ralof . 
  the best spell in the history of elder scrolls ; clairvoyance fixes that . 
   we did n't make an ios game like this , but we did release a previous game with a similar title early last year . 
  it was geared toward a european market . 
  we created an entirely new game , then decided for brand recognition and etc. 
  to call it a similar name . 
  could you elaborate on this . 
  why not call the game rescue : everyday heroes 2 ? 
  having two different games with the same name is confusing .

  i like it . 
  well artist called this piece `` goat dude '' . 
  besides are n't satyrs supposed to be half human ? 
  i think that best chance for valkubus is tamsin developing crush for bo , but even then nothing will come out of it till she becomes more mature . 
  so no headway towards valkubus in the next few episodes . 
  at this point it 's hard to guess what will be happening at the end of the season .

  i guess that his interpretation of this rule was different than yours :, 
   please accredit the artist by their real name and link to source . 
  please take 5 minutes to use google image search or tineye . 
  you do n't put links into the comments , but since you do n't link to directly to the images either i can see how that would have seemed redundant .
