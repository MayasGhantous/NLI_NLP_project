  no need to apologise !, 
  i did n't know that it was gundam thing either . 
  one of my tear channels took some damage on bicycling accident few years back . 
  as a result my right eye gets little bit too much tear fluid . 
  it starts to get uncomfortable if i spent long times outside in temperatures below -20 \u00b0 c. 
  yeah , this reminds me of italian city [ assisi ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/assisi_panorama.jpg ) witch was rather annoying to walk around . 
  they do n't, 
  thought best video sharing site of all time was [ stage6 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stage6 ) . 
  christmas holiday . 
  been sitting home whole day redditting . 
  to leave something behind . 
  reddit , netflix , books, 
  halo 2 multiplayer . 
  thousands of deaths . 
  edit : 29842 deaths to be exact . 
  awesome that halo 2 [ stats ] ( http://halo.bungie.net/stats/playerstatshalo2.aspx?player=peltsi ) are still online . 
  turdetani are about to conquer city of carthage . 
  i just wish to make them clear what will result from destroying my client state . 
  ` make peace with carthage ' ... ` accept or we will attack ', 
  halo 3, 
  star wars : republic commando, 
  or maybe she did n't have any friends and you got all her money . 
  i side with forsworn every time i 'm not playing as nord . 
  same going on my xbox360 . 
  if all of us started having issues simultaneously , they must have changed something . 
  has anyone tried contacting netflix directly ? 
  i have now . 
  after short trial i found them guilty . 
  update :, 
  turns out that this was actually good advice . 
  there is something wrong with the key i normally use , with the spare key car started without problems . 
  after a while it becomes easy to predict wich images will do well at imaginary networks . 
  altought misscalculations still happen . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymonsters/comments/1sk42u/contempt_by_fenghua_zhong/ ) is all time best scored post at / r/imaginarymonsters . 
  i came across the same piece few days prior , but i chose not to submit thinking that it would get me only about 100 karma . 
  [ axe_of_perun ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axe of perun ), 
  finnish high schools have one mandatory course of philosophy and three selectives for it . 
  philosophy wasnt one of the most popular subjects . 
  the last selective course only had four students . 
  i do n't remember seeing this in the original fable . 
  did they add some new items for the anniversary edition ? 
  if it was r/gaming all the comments would be saying that this isnt issue at all . 
  it feels like the leagage is coming from other end of the spectrum . 
  i have played 7 different gta games without finishing any of them . 
  5 has good story , but after a while gta gameplay just gets too monoteous for me . 
  iw was one of my favourites as well . 
  thats actually the reason why i was disappointed with hr . 
  the two games have very little in common . 
  from bbc, 
   russia 's black sea fleet has given ukrainian forces in crimea until 5:00 local time ( 03:00 gmt ) on tuesday to surrender or face an all-out assault , according to ukrainian defence ministry sources quoted by interfax-ukraine news agency . 
  `` if by 5am tomorrow morning they do not surrender a real assault will begin on units and sections of the ukrainian armed forces all over crimea , '' defence ministry officials are quoted as saying . 
  so far there is no further confirmation of the ultimatum from other sources . 
  interesting read . 
  first i thought that this was / r/badbadhistory , but it 's just the different perspective .
