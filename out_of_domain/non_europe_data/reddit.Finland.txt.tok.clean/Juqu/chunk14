  last history book i read was about swedish empire and that clashed big time with statement like this :, 
   scandinavia was the poor backwater of europe . 
  sweden and denmark ( the only two states that existed in the region from the black death to world war i ) were only just powerful enough to remain independent from the great powers . 
  the most memorable was when we were randomly heating metallic pencil sharpener and it caught fire . 
  this little experiment was not condoned by teacher . 
  [ example from youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0qxqvhh6ck ), 
  this may be true in usa , but finnish news channels are all consenrating on ukraine . 
  i doubt that i would even have heard about that plane without reddit . 
  this makes me much more interested at oculus . 
  i thought that it was going to be another power glove , but if big business is willing to pay that kind of money for it maybe they are into something . 
  mostly i go to goodreads for my reviews . 
  only other review site i visit is [ dark wolf 's fantasy reviews ] ( http://darkwolfsfantasyreviews.blogspot.fi ), 
  in shadowrun it was not just about the different controllers . 
  my brothers are still actively playing shadowrun and they can make about four times as many kills when playing on pc with 360 controller than on actual xbox360 . 
  as itself , no . 
  wider variety of mods can make it worthwile . 
  thought i have never toched multiplayer.and if you are into that warband would probably be worth it . 
  i noticed that you trophy case is empty . 
  try [ verifying ] ( https://ssl.reddit.com/verify?reason=submit ) your email , that should make submitting easier . 
  well , the other option is wait for a month . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/14erjc/psa_if_you_get_the_looks_like_youre_either_a/ ) is more info . 
  no problem , glad i could be of assistance .

  nothing . 
  if i got my mobilisation letter i would report as ordered . 
  * they 're, 
  i get positive feeling instead . 
  it 's reality check , calms me and helps me collect my thoughs . 
  i you kick it hard enough , it will roll over . 
  military scifi is my favourite genre and armor is most definitely in my top 5 for it . 
  hey , hey , calm down . 
  it would be hassle to move the whole subreddit to / r/only9subscribers, 
  use your address or telephone number . 
  it 's easier to remember that way . 
  if landed plane was destroyed by drone and pilot killed , cuba would rant in un about sovereign rights and american imperialism . 
  in america itself there would be huge debate whenever assassinating us citizens is ever acceptable . 
  edit : i almost corrected themrme1 for writing `` seitsem\u00e4n '' instead of `` seits\u00e4m\u00e4n '' . 
  glad i googled it . 
  `` seitsem\u00e4n '' is correct other is dialect . 
  i have been living my whole live in a lie .

  pak fa set to enter service in 2016 and j-20 in 2019 . 
  at lest the chinese would get huge boost for their program from f-22 specifications .

  only thing that comes to my mind is tropa de elite and even that is more pro-fascism than pro-racism . 
  what ? 
  weapon model [ suomi kp / -31 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suomi_kp/-31 ), 
  sub is currently little image and ww2 heavy because i have been resubmitting my old posts from / r/historyporn , / r/humanporn , / r/propagandaposters and / r/guns, 
  in hietaniemi . 
  original caption :, 
  i thought about it and chose english for three reasons . 
  possibility of wider audience , ability to be part of / r/historynetwork and it makes cross-posting easier .

  ** hitman absolution ** almost forgot to get it from `` games with gold '' .

  flair test, 
  i have been looking for subreddit like this !, 
  but how about spicing up the looks little bit ? 
  enabling thumbnail images and putting up css them like [ edurne ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/edurne ) would make this sub look more interesting . 
  i have n't played the game yet , but i read that it has support for 360 controller . 
  i imagine that playing with pad will make for better experience . 
  i expecially recommend checking out their stickied post : [ baen free library ] ( https://www.baenebooks.com/c-1-free-library.aspx ), 
  lots of good stuff in there . 
  wow . 
  after little hiatus i was about to start actively submit images again . 
  it came as really big suprice that my favourite concept art site has gone offline . 
  i think that reposting need rules for it to helpful for subreddit . 
  for example look at reposting rules of polandball or expanded imaginary network :, 
   it must have not been posted in the last 8 months , also it must not be in the top 150 of all time or redditormade . 
   f you repost something that was posted to this subreddit less than three months ago , or is currently in the top 100 list , it will be removed .
