   british volunteers, 
   when the war ended there were only 13 british volunteers in finland although many more had volunteered , including 214 men who reached finland and lapua one week after the war had ended . 
  there were further 750 volunteers waiting to be shipped to finland , but with the armistice in march 13th , they never came to finland . 
  the britons were also stationed in lapua and formed the british company of detachment sisu . 
  among the britons there were other nationalities , too : e.g. 
  irish , portuguese and at least one man of estonian birth . 
  according to the initial british plan all the british volunteers were to fight in a single unit . 
  command of the unit was to be given to colonel kermit roosevelt , son of theodore roosevelt . 
   some of the british volunteers travelled home throught sweden immediately after the war , but the majority were stationed for some time in savonlinna . 
  some of the men were forced to return home via difficult routes , e.g.palestine or vladivostok in the soviet far east . 
  there were still some british volunteers in finland in 1941 when finland was again in war with the soviet union . 
  this time there were german troops stationed in the northern part of finland and some of the former british volunteers were employed by their embassy to monitor german troop movements .

  thanks for the uppvote !, 
  thought i have to admit i had no idea what trollblood kithkar is . 
  i just grabbed cool arms from / r/imaginarywarriors . 
  i posted few links . 
  during winter war finland and germany were n't allies . 
  instead because of molotov-ribbentrop pact , soviet union and germany were . 
  in fact british and french made [ plans ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franco%e2%80%93british_plans_for_intervention_in_the_winter_war ) for military intervention against the soviets . 
  yeah , that correct . 
  pact 's official name was :, 
   treaty of non-aggression between germany and the union of soviet socialist republics, 
  symbol test,

  my heart skipped a beat ... 
  interesting , but i believe that eventually there is a limit what you can get people to say with peer pressure . 
  i got good anecdote for this . 
  in finnish army conscript nco were marching us conscript recruits around . 
  they made us sing few questionable marching songs . 
  first song was about fucking diseased whore . 
  everyone sang cheerfully along . 
  second song was about shooting gypsies with smile on your face . 
  everyone sang along , thought tone was not so cheerful . 
  third song was about raping woman and children and burning them with napalm . 
  volume was quieter and not everyone sang along . 
  yes bigger conflict is referred as world war two . 
  parts in with finland was involved are called winter war and continuation war . 
  well done . 
  thanks for putting your own money and effort on this . 
  same here . 
  watched whole season on one sitting . 
  awesome !, 
  i was really disappointed that origins and 2 did n't have pad support . 
  before looking up this info i choose to make a stand and not buy this game if it came without controller support . 
  looks like i will be playing inqusition afterall . 
  i live in in finland and modded psx was the console everyone had in my youth . 
  i think i knew one kid with nintendo console . 
  n64 must have been much bigger in the north america . 
  if you get stranded laying in the water naked is not the best way to survive ... 
  this would fit / r/getmotivated better than / r/heavymind . 
  good first half . 
  i was looking for irc substitute for mangatraders and now it seems no such thing exists anymore . 
  i quess i have to start using those clunky online readers to get my manga fix . 
  if you missed it , i recommend looking at the [ survey results . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/27iyio/the_rmanga_survey_results_are_in/ ), 
  even if the game was over after 30 min , it was still fun to watch player reactions . 
  finland moved from television licence to tv-tax in 2013 . 
  i like the tax based system more . 
  less bureaucracy and lover cost to me . 
  licence fee was 252,25 $ . 
  now it 's varies between 50-140 $ and no tax for those who earn lesser than 7 352,95 $ in a year . 
  yuri is my favourite genre , but i never really liked this series . 
  there is [ german air force flying training center ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holloman_air_force_base#german_air_force_flying_training_center ) in holloman air force base , new mexico . 
  quest markers are awesome . 
  i do n't miss old school games where i would get constantly lost and spent hours raging . 
  for some reason i have terrible sense of direction in games . 
  but this does n't matter anymore in modern games . 
  in skyrim with markers and clairvoyance i only got lost few times . 
  here is another way for gutting the eel :, 
  nail it through the head into the wall/tree . 
  then cut the eel 's skin around the neck and pull the skin out . 
  use tongs or newspaper for better grip . 
  edit : i forgot to say that the food looks superb !, 
  thanks for this !, 
  althought i will use it to do the opposite of what you are suggesting . 
  for some reason the default color for me was yellow and i prefer the white subtitles .
