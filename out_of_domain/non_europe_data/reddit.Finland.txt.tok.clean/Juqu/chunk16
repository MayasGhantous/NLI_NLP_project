  i have literally been the bottom of the well . 
  it was cold and wet , no fun at all . 
  i got this as christmas present few years ago . 
  i remember reading the whole thing but now i cant recall anything from the plot . 
  in goodreads i ` ve given this three stars , so i cant call this a masterpiece . 
  i have broken one toaster this way . 
  kickstarter would currently be illegal in finland . 
  money collecting is heavily regulated here . 
  althought there is currently plans to relax the money collecting law . 
  i 'm not sure how i feel about that , there would be much more scams but on the other hand people should have right to support things they like .

  i was curious why the chart was was talking about yugoslavia in euro2004 qualifier . 
  that really was the name of the team at beginning of the [ qualifier ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uefa_euro_2004_qualifying_group_9 ) , but they chanced it to the serbia and montenegro half way through .

  i wonder what species of turtle lives in `` southern baltic lowlands '' eco-region ?

  more propaganda at : / r/propagandaposters, 
  thanks , i did spent time wondering where that extra s come from . 
  but since vss was used as abbreviation for v\u00e4est\u00f6nsuojelu by [ pelastuslaitos ] ( http://www.ku-pelastus.fi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=56&amp;itemid=93 ) and [ wikipedia ] ( http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%a4est%c3%b6nsuojelu ) i decided just roll with it . 
  is this just us thing or will it be applied to google 's business worldwide ?

  only large group of allied soldiers that were sent to concentration camps were soviet pows . 
  and soviets did n't treat their prisoners of war any better than germans did . 
  in addition to those , wikipedia has page about [ allied war crimes during world war ii ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allied_war_crimes_during_world_war_ii ), 
  other finnish stuff at / r/finnishhistory,

  it 's worth noting that shadowrun had some serious balancing issuen in favor of pc . 
  it 's easy to get three or four times as many kills when playing on pc with pad conpared to xbox360 . 
  if i 'm using [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kghrjcx.jpg?2 ) to play on pc and getting consistently better results than on xbox360 i do n't see how it could be input device issue . 
  in finland we have slot machines and porn in grocery stores .

   explanation : how much of jupiter 's moon europa is made of water ? 
  a lot , actually . 
  based on the galileo probe data acquired during its exploration of the jovian system from 1995 to 2003 , europa possesses a deep , global ocean of liquid water beneath a layer of surface ice . 
  the subsurface ocean plus ice layer could range from 80 to 170 kilometers in average depth . 
  adopting an estimate of 100 kilometers depth , if all the water on europa were gathered into a ball it would have a radius of 877 kilometers . 
  to scale , this intriguing illustration compares that hypothetical ball of all the water on europa to the size of europa itself ( left ) - and similarly to all the water on planet earth . 
  with a volume 2-3 times the volume of water in earth 's oceans , the global ocean on europa holds out a tantalizing destination in the search for extraterrestrial life in our solar system . 
   this subreddit will contain news , science , and information related to this fascinating moon of jupiter . 
  what about art depicting europa , would that be okay too ? 
  i have never managed to find big team game . 
  punishing quitters is a good thing . 
  all the br all the time is growing old . 
  i would like them to bring back team hardcore playlist and take br starts out of team slayer . 
  then trust mine . 
  i 'm back at playing halo 4 on my 360 . 
  luckily this isnt issue for me . 
  i used recon layout in halo 4 and same layout can be fount on halo 5 . 
  granades feel useful again . 
  bungies control schemes werent always that great either . 
  reach introduced sprint , but none of its schemes allowed me to incorporate sprint in my game in any meaningful way . 
  i thought i was done with halo and other modern shooters . 
  but then came halo 4 ( & 5 ) and the recon control scheme . 
  it puts sprint into x and me back into the game . 
  yes you can . 
  though option for it should come up more often . 
  yesteday i bought ** saints row iv ** and l. a. noire, 
  character importing from sr3 to sr4 is currently down , so i had to manually recreate my character . 
  apart from that game looks good . 
  it 's also last week of ** halo 5 beta ** so i will try to squeeze some more fun out of that . 
  around 20 $ . 
  i usually buy console games . 
  if i come across another finnish player i usually do that . 
  for me it was best halo experience since halo3, 
  no it does n't . 
  i 'm ok with skill ranks being reseted , but i do n't want lose record of my played games . 
  i was bored and looked that up . 
  in finland name change cost 's 114 $ . 
  never i 've used the same gamertag for a decade . 
  thought i have used few moths worth of free trials cards with different gamertags . 
  edit : i wanted to be sure about the lenght of time and checked my halo 2 stats . 
  my first game over xbox live :,

  just missed my ten year anniversary !, 
  i actually like the fact that guards do n't show any respect . 
  they got the guts to walk to the greatest warrior of the land and spit on his face . 
   while i definitely would n't mind a game where the player , for example , plays an aztec doing aztec things in aztec society ,, 
  i remember game like that . 
  `` aztec : the curse in the heart of the city of gold '' i played it for an hour a over a decade ago , but because of the unique setting and awesome [ intro ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzbr_chaaai ) it has stuck on my mind . 
  mass effect 3 , could i allow geth to exist ? 
  i wanted to make galaxy good place for humans to live even after reapers got defeated . 
  my shepard was was not going to leave [ epaminondas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epaminondas ) like legacy . 
  it was choice between destroying the geth or mediating geth/quarian peace . 
  upgraded geth might become humanity 's next great enemy , but i thought it unlikely .
