  geth were not like grogan or rachi , they had been content to live on their own corner of galaxy . 
  and so the geth carried on . 
  [ for a while . 
  i do n't undertand people who say that there were no happy endings on ma3 .

  this is best drama i 've seen so far in 2015 . 
  sometimes , especially if there are too many in the same story . 
  i think germany should look on it history with more pride . 
  not on nazis or holocaust those should of course be condemned . 
  but actions of regular german soldiers who fought hard and well for their country should be honoured . 
  halo 5, 
  i liked the beta . 
  i will likely crab some halo 5 + xbox one bundle . 
  im going to finish ** tomb raider ** and then return to playing ** saints row 4 **, 
  if you got xbox live gold , i recommend grabbing tomb raider if you have n't already . 
  recipe :, 
  put the banana in oven at mild temperature . 
  take the banana out when it 's black . 
  cut open and serve with salt . 
  tasted good . 
  salt brought out new flavour . 
  texture was soft and little wet . 
  i know what you mean . 
  in my first playtrought i was playing as fanatical imperial . 
  i destroyed dark brotherhood and if there had been an option i would have done the same for those filthy beasts . 
  i play much more on 360 than one . 
  i 've got huge backlog , and games for gold keeps adding more titles on the pile . 
  ** games i have n't finished : **, 
  assassin 's creed revelations, 
  alan wake, 
  clash of heroes, 
  dark souls, 
  dead island, 
  dead or alive 5,

  gears of war, 
  halo 3, 
  halo reach, 
  iron brigade, 
  legend of spyro, 
  mx vs. atv alive, 
  prey, 
  red faction guerilla, 
  saints row iv,

  bioshock infinite, 
  brothers tale of two sons, 
  sniper elite v2, 
  limbo, 
  trials hd, 
  if you are still interested add peltsi . 
  i already got my brother to help , so we would only need one more person to play ranked matches . 
  it 's illeagal for south africans to work as mercenaries . 
  their government got upset after rumors emerged that some were fighting against boko haram . 
  smoke bacon sausages in the fireplace . 
  veggies on the frying pan :, 
  1 onion, 
  1 can of mushrooms, 
  it might have been the hangover , but the sausages were little bit of letdown . 
  they did n't taste like smoke or bacon . 
  black flag ? 
  i 'm yet to finish revelations . 
  not even sure how many games i 'm behind in the assasin 's creed series . 
  i was surprised when i saw the trailers too . 
  they are basing her look in the new game on how she looks on the definitive [ edition ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0pw_vgtkai#t=2m9s ) . 
  switch from xbox360 version to new trailer was huge , but she does n't look too different from the definitive edition . 
  totes_meta_bot on siirtynny [ el\u00e4kkeelle ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/2xtauo/totes_meta_bot_the_bestknown_bot_on_reddit_is_no/ ) . 
  i chopped three cloves of garlic and the chilis , then trow them on hot fryingpan with olive oil . 
  after they had gotten some color i added the pork . 
  with rice i used tikka curry spice mix . 
  it was spicy but not too hot , no afterburn . 
  i quess that spiciness of dish like this depens lots on what species chili you end up using . 
  pros : cheap . 
  cons : does n't work . 
  if i enjoyed troubleshooting games at startup , i would have gotten pc instead of xbox one . 
  code worked fine . 
  the game did n't . 
  says : `` player lost ! '', 
  for some reason it does n't find players . 
  quick googling found others with same problem , but it seem to only affect few people . 
  child of light is pretty easy . 
  also / r/xboxachievements , but sadly none of achievement subs are as active as / r/trophies . 
  but there would be litle risk for amazon to open up a swedish site . 
  they are already operating inside eu and same laws apply .
