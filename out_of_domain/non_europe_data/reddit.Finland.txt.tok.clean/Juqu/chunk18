  building warehouses in sweden would cost but those might not be nessesary . 
  amazon probaply just thinks that site upkeep and customer service cost 's would be bigger than the increased profits . 
  random late reply . 
  has anyone done the same for dragon age origins & dragon age 2 ? 
  i think it 's playstyle choice . 
  it 's possibly to play elders scroll game and not care about the loot . 
  in my first playtrought of skyrim i used three different melee weapons . 
  starting sword , bound sword and mace of molag bal . 
  in oblivion i took thinks further and played as melee mage , wearing enchanted clothes and puching people . 
  thanks for pointing me in the right direction . 
  they were in the bsa 's, 
  but instead of figuring out how to do this ck , i choose to use npcvisualtransfer instead . 
  and now arissa is smiling with new face . 
  thank you !, 
  visual transfer did the job for me . 
  ) was easy to install . 
  aria arissa was little bit harder . 
  i combined [ arissa ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53754/ ? 
  ) and aria from [ rk followers ] ( http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45578/ ? ), 
  using / u/threeten22 's [ npcvisualtransfer ] ( https://github.com/threeten22/npcvisualtransfer ) ( beta ! ), 
  i really like the results . 
  i see you got the problem solved , but for future reference if you have the unofficial skyrim patch installed , there 's a shrine of kynareth called remove unwanted visual effects/shrine of cleansing in the northeast side of the temple of kynareth . 
  [ playtrough ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/3696o3/i_have_completed_my_brytenwalda_playthrough/ ) in which all lords god killed . 
  quick way to do it is to open [ console ] ( http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/console_commands_%28skyrim%29 ) and write tm, 
  sos and amorous adventures . 
  before the release of the tv show it was hard to find asoiaf fanfiction from internet . 
  i 'm glad that that 's no longer the case . 
  and soon after that everyone was laying in the snow naked . 
  quite often , most common failue being lack of nuance . 
  makes me wish that / r/badbadhistory would me active sub . 
  year ago i asked : [ what if there is civil war in ukraine between pro-russia and pro-eu parties ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/futurewhatif/comments/1raraf/what_if_there_is_civil_war_in_ukraine_between/ ), 
  the way they show troop numbers is also pretty misleading . 
  eastern european nato members vs all of russia . 
  germany is much closer to easter europe than russian far-east . 
  otto henning 's * panzer leader memoirs of an armoured car commander , 1944-1945 * was a good read . 
  interesting insights into workings of german armoured reconnaissance . 
  story of mithridates i would make good movie too . 
  he rode into pontus with only six horseman and made himself a king . 
  halo 2, 
  medieval 2 total war, 
  jet set radio future, 
  ** remember me ** on xbox 360, 
  i 'm 20 % in and it 's been very good so far . 
  i 'm using french voices with english subtitles . 
  it enhances the atmosphere of neo-paris . 
  it ` s not that hard to find finnish speakers from russia . 
  wikipedia puts their number to 51 000 . 
  finland is also nearby western oriented state . 
  there is good finnish talent among russian inteligence community . 
  thank you !, 
  i 'm suprised by this . 
  i did n't expect anyone on reddit board to take redditors ~ ~ whining ~ ~ complains seriously . 
  damage might still happen . 
  quoting u/ekjp :, 
   so why am i leaving ? 
  ultimately , the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than i believe i can deliver while maintaining reddit 's core principles . 
  it will be intresting to see how / u/spez will manage to juggle between the board and the angry mob . 
  paon omat [ kommentit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3cudi0/resignation_thank_you/ ), 
  old friends and random acquaintances . 
  it 's awesome to go on local event and see it filled with people who you know . 
  good fish & soul festifal only minus being that i could n't find afterparty and have to resort getting more drunk while browsing reddit . 
  nimi on sama [ goodreadissa . 
  ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7208402-juqu ), 
  same here , and gpokr too . 
  no need for that . 
  me advise to op is to forgot apout spellind ; post that dond follow grammar rulez are more inresting ant unikue . 
  i 've always find the story of [ boten anna ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pzx6_kgggz0 ) touching . 
  as a finn living in finland and worshipping old finnish gods my ancestors are very important to me . 
  / r/xray, 
  ** tomb raider ** ( xbox360 ) just got my last multiplayer achievements . 
  after some more multiplayer i might start new single player campaing to get 100 % on the game . 
  only thing i 'm missing is 5g chatterbox achievement . 
  `` all conversations with the endurance crew completed '' i have to say that i dislike developers for creating such easily missable secret achievement . 
  week ago there was [ a good post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3ewleu/bad_history_in_rbadhistory_late_antiquity_and_the/ ) in / r/badhistory about spread of early islam . 
  so apparently jaw breaker is a type of candy . 
  after reading the title i thought that you had made some kind of brass knuckle ring . 
  looking at first picture was confusing . 
  + / u/user _ simulator / u/juqu, 
  / u/trollabot juqu, 
  flip a coin, 
  or dark tale of edgy teenager turning into a neo-nazi . 
  just got myself used xbox one and some games . 
  diablo3 , wolfenstein old blood , alien isolation , final fantasy type-0 and destiny . 
  i have never played final fantasy game , so i desieded to start with ** final fantasy type-0 ** 15 minutes long intro wasn ` t suprise but the lack of turn based combat was . 
  ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hthtekwaydi ), 
  that should not be the case . 
  from the official faq :, 
   do i get to keep the games ? 
   for xbox one , you can play them as long as you have an active xbox live gold subscription . 
  xbox 360 free games are yours to keep . 
  xbox 360 combo of used games , fallout 3 game of the year edition , fallout new vegas ultimate edition and dishonored for 17 $, 
  ps3 used heavy rain 10 $ ( + new medal of honor warfighter for xbox360 as bonus ), 
  my biggest purhase this summer was used xbox one . 
  white xbox one + two controllers + charge kit + 5 games + mail = 348,5 $ . 
  games were destiny , final fantasy type 0 , diablo 3 , alien isolation , and wolfestein new blood . 
  later i also got new sunset overdrive for 20 $ . 
  / r/fireteams could use quide for new players . 
  post like `` vog hm lf4m fresh '' are incomprehensible for someone new to destiny . 
  i one day will return and rip the black spindle out of your dead hands .
