  perks can differ between year 1 and year 2 versions . 
  atleast in armor . 
  technically soviets attacked first in continuation war . 
  operation barbarossa started 22.6.1941 and continuation war 26.6.1941, 
  between these dates finland tried to call itself neutral while simultaneously allowing germans to use finnish airfields to bomb soviet union . 
  soviets responded on 25.6 . by bombing finland with 500 planes . 
  same day finnish prime minister said on radio that they were again at war with soviet union . 
  declaration of war and ground invasion followed on 26.6 . 
  in shadowrun it was n't just keyboard and mouse that gave pc players an edge . 
  playing on pc using xbox360 controller would give you huge advantage . 
  easily getting 3-4 times as many kills as 360 . 
  i do n't know if it was hardware or netcode that caused this . 
  future game developers need to account for platform differences better , if they want to make working cross platform game . 
  mic : yes, 
  crazy : no, 
  source ? 
  edit : quote from bungie `` all black spindles will be set to 290 '', 
  try / r/fireteams, 
  and that 's not all !, 
  tabasco sauce has many winter applications too !, 
  if your car locks are frozen shut on winter just put tabasco sauce on them . 
  the warming effect will take care of that !, 
  or if you are outside rub tabasco on your face and eyes !, 
  the gentle feeling of warmth will make you forgot the cold !, 
  i own both assasin creed 3 and black flag , but i have n't touched them because i still have n't finished revelations . 
  good title . 
  for a moment i thought i was in / r/sixwordstories, 
  i don ` t understand the salt over this . 
  sadly exlusives are part of modern gaming . 
  uncharted games seem interesting , but since they are on ps4 i havent played any of them . 
  i ` ll just shrug and move on . 
  we ca n't kill all live or even all humans . 
  source : [ / r/askscience tread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3iptek/so_human_beings_have_tested_2153_nuclear_bombs_in/ ), 
  count the kills and focus on the primary until you 've got the required kills . 
  take risks , instead of using granade/special/super go in primary blazing . 
  it sucked to die in situations that could have been avoided playing smart , but that way i eventually got through this quest line . 
  til this sub has dropdown menu . 
  never tried too . 
  let ` ts fail together !, 
  i can play . 
  i can play . 
  fellow first timer here . 
  damn 395 . 
  impressive . 
  if you want play with lowly 303 titan , sent message to peltsi . 
  yeah , definetly luck thing . 
  i 've played 460 hours of destiny on xbox one and never seen strike afk ` r. 
  in a bigger maps range can be a factor . 
  in any map in which i can summon sparrow , i switch my nirwens to the villainy or a scout rifle . 
  i recommend checking this series even if you are not malazan fan . 
  i dropped malazan after first book , but traitor son cycle is one of my favourites . 
  the story is much more coherent . 
  `` you 're good against bad players , and bad against good players . '', 
  [ faq ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/crucibleplaybook/wiki/faq ) has some good tips . 
  i cant find `` yata tiger '' from xbl . 
  i can play . 
  i totally disagree with this . 
  i prever having achievable goals instead of `` long time progression system '' . 
  i dont have group but i can play gt : peltsi, 
  ghost drops are needed for newer players . 
  it does suck to get one now , but i remember how hard it was get ghosts before bungie changed the nightfall rewards . 
  srl also needs different control schemes . 
  i did n't like the placement of side trusters so i button mapped them from rb and lb to x and b. 
  i like it much more , but making that swap back everytime i want play something else than srl is annoying . 
  or button map lb to x and rb to b. i used the claw for couple of races but it just did n't feel good , so i did button mapping instead . 
  time is now 02:30 pst . 
  for anyone else wondering . 
  edit : time when this comment was first written was 02:30 pst . 
  it 's now 06:00 pst . 
  and iron banner will start 4 hours from now . 
  good point . 
  someone who has time should xpost this to / r/freeebooks . 
  awesome game . 
  for a different view i recommend [ / r/badhistory 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3uj3mo/inaccuracies_of_grey_90_mortality_from_a_passive/ ) take on that video . 
  playing katawa shoujo after accident that gave me my own set of facial scars was a terapeutic experience . 
  just watched firs season of ** dark matter ** on netflix and i really liked it . 
  one of the best scifi show to come out on this decade . 
  i just whatched, 
  after your recommendation i watched the first episode of the expanse wanting to hate it . 
  i could n't . 
  seems like a good show , thought maybe little too slow paced . 
  very nice . 
  i would prefer the 34 version . 
  input type was n't the only problem with shadowruns cross-platform play . 
  average player would easily get twice as much kills when playing on pc with xbox 360 controller than on actual 360 . 
  that was some good sherpa'ing during hm oryx challence . 
  well sherpaed oryx hm challence . 
  a + would recommend . 
  is there any merchant still selling primary ammo synthesis ? 
  if not what ` s the easiest way to get some ? 
  i 've played and completed one game on normal too . 
  late game battles got easy , but i still feel i might have lost the game if i had n't made some correct guesses early on . 
  sbmm is a good thing . 
  i gladly suffer little more lag for more enjoyable experience . 
  yeah , sbmm is fairer to everyone and personally i like playing tight maches more . 
  there is no fun in curbstomp . 
  i would add primary ammo synthesis into some mechant 's inventory . 
  yes it 's better for most people . 
  complaining comes from some top players hwose games have gotten harder and more laggy . 
  fuck everyone who who prefers cbmm .
