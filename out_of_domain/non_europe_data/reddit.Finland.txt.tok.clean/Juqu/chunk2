  yep , i have read several iama 's about those . 
  your omert\u00e0 is breaking !, 
  it is good argument because even games like dragon age which are released on both platforms do n't have controller support on pc version . 
  i played trough oblivion as `` melee mage '' hand to hand mixed with magic . 
  i also wore enchanted clothes , so i did n't need to worry about weapons , armors or carry limits . 
  it was most fun that i 've had while playing oblivion . 
  til about nightmode . 
  thanks . 
  your post made me check out r/lastnight, 
  not as good as i hoped for . 
  working on my halo display area in my new apartment , lmk what you all think !, 
  ( ** cross post from last night ** ... ), 
  me no good at humour .

  finally new mod that works with my original mound & blade !, 
  anyone got idea how to make pure pazaak work on windows 7 ? 
  i thought that i was moral relativist . 
  now thanks to this test i know better . 
  you need 350 comment karma to get into secret reddit society that gives stuff away, 
  i do n't consider steam acceptable for single player games . 
  empire total war demo required steam , that installation was so frustrating that i swore never to use steam again . 
  hemorrhage is supposed to be blood gulch ? 
  mind = blown, 
  after ten hours of human revolutions , i still think that invisible war was better game .

  r/history and alternatehistory.com are the only ones that i regularly check . 
  not flashy enought .

  i like it here . 
  most submissions have content instead of memes . 
  activity after each episode is enough .
