  i passed 1000 read books mark on goodreads few months ago . 
  that 's probably around 80 % of book i 've read on all of my life . 
   there was supposed to be no sequel to the game and now look at it . 
  interesting , i 've never heard that before . 
  bungie 's `` ten year plan '' was leaked pretty early on . 
  i got my copy of vanilla destiny with my used xbox one and started to play it few weeks before ttk came out . 
  and i really liked it . 
  i was starting to run out of content , but getting ttk legendary edition fixed that . 
  one of the best 30 $ i 've ever spent . 
  destiny is game that i 've spent most time playing in my entire life and definetly one of the best fps 's all around . 
  first game of eu4 !, 
  i wanted to play learning game in the quiet corner of the world . 
  started as geldre , the used to console to get huge cash boost and three provinces in australia . 
  after getting rid of my european area i spent my time colonising and eating up nations in southeast asia . 
  wars against vijayanagara , brittish and dutch were little harder but everything was going according to plan , till 1800 that is . 
  while i was supporting my ally bengal in a war that had drawn in the ming , the revolutionary france struck . 
  [ world map . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7zarirr.png ) i 'm winning in africa and holding my own in america but the situation in [ australia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bspvbbl.jpg ) is a problem . 
  their morale is so much better that i will need to ship in my last armies from malaya to have fighting chance . 
  at the current rates how many motes are needed for exotic class item ? 
  i 've never heard of cantaloupe , for a moment i thought that it was english word for antelope . 
  made this post much more horrifying . 
  any idea how to filter by eyar ? 
  i would like to sort stories by kudos + published in 2016 . 
  about a month ago i made myself list of things to do before roi . 
  ~ ~ reach 335 light ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ go to the lighthouse ~ ~, 
  ~ ~ get flawless raider achievement ~ ~, 
  kill driviks, 
  only the toughest boss of the game remains !, 
  boss at the end of black spindle mission . 
  i tried and failed that mission so many times with lower light that i got little burned . 
  probably easy to do with 335 ll , i just have n't gotten doing it . 
  confession time , i bought pre-built pc . 
  it was from small finnish shop . 
  i chose the parts from drop bar menu , they put it together , gave it two year qurantee and mailed it to me . 
  i would have saved 100 + euros had i ordered the parts from germany , but i did n't want to deal with international shipping and shittier german consumer laws . 
  edit : or maybe i should use custom-build instead of pre-build ? 
  it 's doable . 
  i remember playing with guy who got 16 kills in single game of trials with tom 's last shot . 
  it 's only requires one moment of distraction for your character to disappear . 
  my scariest moment in destiny was when i got text message while in character selection screen . 
  i put my elite controller on top of my leg and reached for my phone . 
  luckily i managed to pick it up before my character got deleted . 
  embalming part is what weirds me out . 
  before reddit i thought embalming was limited to anciend egyptians and communist dictators . 
  it being popular practise in modern north america was big suprise . 
  2 days donation for / r/millionairemakers, 
  but product doese n't include all that was promised in the packaging . 
  i do n't understand how they can refuse replasing it with another xbox one s. 
  but was n't frienly fire turned off by default ? 
  i do n't remember having any such issues on my playthrough . 
  i do n't see optional extra content as a bad thing . 
  there is no need to do everything , in fact i finished the game without visiting one region at all . 
  i find unskipple story related content more annoying . 
  dragon age : origins deep roads segment was the most boring part of any rpg i 've played . 
  overall i think that inquisition is the best game of the series . 
  yeah , for the `` real modding '' dowload icon from somewhere else . 
  [ eu4 icon on devianart ] ( http://markotodic.deviantart.com/art/europa-universalis-iv-icon-395564926 ), 
  once i was just about to fall a sleep when i heard myself saying :, 
  `` i killed man with an axe . '', 
  speaking out without meaning to was really creepy feeling . 
  jolted me wide awake . 
  xtz earphone 12, 
  you are forgetting the effect of [ frost heaving ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frost_heaving ) . 
  i grow up in finnish farm and every spring we had to collect all the rocks the had risen up in the previous winter . 
  i would like to have the code too . 
  i would n't consider it odd , for example [ the luna park ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/5f97m6/the_faces_at_the_entrance_of_sydneys_luna_park/ ) has had the same entrance for 80 years . 
  i actually saw this pic on facebook and started to make / r/birdswitharms before even noticing that there was photoshopbattles thread . 
  last srl i button mapped lb/rb into x/b . 
  it felt better than even the thumbsticks . 
  since that i 've got the elite controller and started to use the paddles . 
  they are well suited for racing . 
  i have never killed urrox and if i undertand correctly old poe bosses are changing on weekly basis . 
  is there a way to calculate the next time he will be up ? 
  you are underemestiating the raid numbers . 
  i looked up the percentages for people who had raid related achievements on xbox one . 
  raid completed 20 % and hard raid completed 14 %, 
  kings fall 9 % , on heroic 5 %, 
  wrath of the machine 4 % , on heroic 2 %, 
  for comparison : 48 % of players have completed a strike and 24 % have reached vanguard rank 3, 
  do it on xbox360 , that worked for me . 
  depens on what you call advancement . 
  [ operation spring awakening ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_spring_awakening ) was last major german offensive . 
  germans did attack later later than that too , like when in [ battle of halbe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org german / wiki/battle _ of_halbe #further _ reading ) german ninth army sought to break out of pocket and link up with twelfth army . 
  i was just thinking the opposite . 
  in all splitters i 've seen or operated you need to push a button or a handle for the wood to split . 
  with this machine it 's automatic . 
  make one mistake or stumble and your hand get crushed . 
  dangerous machine and poor working posture . 
  i prefer [ palax ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbctwywxwq ) . 
  i got the thief ( 2014 ) for free when it was on xbox 's games with gold . 
  gameplay and story were all around average . 
  intresting thing is that after completing thief i wanted to play more stealth games and bought dishonored , which i then dropped after few hours . 
  i 'm not saying thief is better game but it did manage to hold my intrest longer . 
  finnish saying : `` bitter , said fox about rowan berries '', 
  1,737,185 was followed by 1,736,186, 
  forked with vpn , but looks like they only have episodes s02e04-s02e09 up for the expance . 
  [ 189,418 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/22luda/189k_counting_thread/cgqitia/ ) is likely my first comment on the main thread . 
  finding this took some detective work as it goes beyond my saved comment history .
